What in the hell made me think organizing a hunt, here at our hotel, would be a good idea? Over a dozen supernatural predators are flying in from all over the world; ones who've paid an exorbitant price for the privilege of removing their everyday masks and killing one of their own kind. I must be crazy.</p><p>I have a feeling this week is going to turn out to be more than any of us bargained for. Self-doubt plagues me as I rise from the warmth of the bed and stroll, naked, to my closet. The glow of the artificial landscape lighting beams in through the windows. The changing gradient indicates it's probably midday here above the Arctic Circle.</p><p>Part of my nervous edge could be associated with learning to trust the new members of our seethe. While the vampires appear upfront and honest-as much as a pack of bloodsuckers can be-my old habits of distrust have served me well over the years.</p> <p>The two months since November's tracking and killing of Ivan have been a trial for me. This upcoming hunt week has been a long time in the planning, but I don't have to like it. Having anyone from the Tribunal of Ancients on our property sucks, especially when I have no idea who they're sending.</p><p>Grabbing the clothes I set out in the wee hours of the morning, I head to the shower in our private suite.</p><p>The hot water cascading over me fills my mind with horrible memories of my own first hunt. My seethe wore cloth-lined, silver skullcaps to thwart my unique vamp-to-vamp mind-control abilities. They orchestrated the hunt to rid themselves of their \"pet\" manipulator. What started for the group as demented undead fun, ended with a young, redheaded vampire surprising them all with her ability to kill ruthlessly and without remorse.</p><p>The blood of my seethe-mates once covered my body, as the water does now. Later, I stacked their headless corpses in our old farmhouse before setting the structure on fire. Killing that sick group was the least I could do to avenge the murders of my first and second husbands. Considering all I'd been through under their rule for twenty-six years, I let the bastards off easy. Thankfully, even a semi-mortal vampire can only die once-if it's done right.</p><p>The sound of Rafe stirring in the next room pulls me out of my dark thoughts and tells me he's getting up as well.</p> <p>\"Good morning, sleepyhead,\" I call out over the noise of the water. \"Get enough rest?\"</p><p>\"You mean after you ravaged me for hours? Oh yeah, I slept pretty damn sound.\"</p><p>I turn the water off, wring out my long hair, and then leave the shower to reach for a towel. Rafe puts one in my hand before I have a chance to connect with the rack on the wall.</p><p>Smiling my thanks, I dry myself quickly. \"We're meeting with everyone in about a half hour. Want me to call the kitchen to send you in something to eat?\"</p><p>\"Isn't Paul on cooking duty?\" Rafe grimaces. \"No thanks. I've got leftovers in our fridge. I'm good.\"</p><p>\"His cooking will get better. Give him some time. It's been a hard adjustment since he's turned and can't eat solid foods anymore.\"</p> <p>\"Yeah, but it's a painful process waiting for him to re-learn.\"</p><p>\"That's the easy part,\" I snort. \"The real challenge since he became a vampire is in helping him control the desire to drain his family whenever he sees them.\"</p><p>Rafe strips for his own shower, patting me on the bottom as he heads inside the enclosure. \"'With great power comes great responsibility.'\"</p><p>\"Don't get all philosophical on me. I may not have wanted four new members in our seethe, but I'll manipulate and train the buggers as best I can.\"</p><p>The water hisses back on. Steam fills the room once more, as a muted ringing comes from the bedroom, and I head in to answer it.</p><p>\"Yes?\"</p><p>Asa's clipped tones greet me on the other end of the line, \"Hey, Vivian.\" He addresses me, like most everyone at The V V Inn, by my nickname. \"I heard water in the pipes. You almost ready for the meeting?\"</p><p>The ex-military munitions expert, and fledgling vampire, really enjoyed creating the Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility underground. Our new command center is set up with video feeds and surveillance of the entire property, all fifteen square miles of it.</p> <p>\"I'll be ready in ten minutes. Have you checked on the others?\" I'm not too thrilled the SCIF is in this wing of the T-shaped hotel-right below our apartment-but I wasn't willing to give up any guest rooms for it either.</p><p>\"Drew is down here with me. Paul's finished his shift in the kitchen and went to change clothes, Joanna's still in her suite, and Jonathan's already waiting for us in the conference room.\"</p><p>Jonathan, our head groundskeeper, is the only werewolf we have on the property as a permanent resident. The thought of his tasty, powerful blood sends a shiver of want through me.</p><p>\"Have we heard from any of the pilots yet?\"</p><p>\"Affirmative. We're staggering the landings. Passengers should begin arriving at five this evening. A new batch will land every twenty minutes or so.\"</p><p>\"Have all the dossiers finally come in on the prospective hunters?\"</p><p>\"Cy emailed the last of his findings a few hours ago.\"</p><p>Cy's a vampire contact of mine from New York and is married to Asa's werewolf Aunt Cali. He's also the person responsible for sending Asa here to help us out this past fall.</p><p>\"Good. Have the folders ready and call the kitchen for pots of blood coffee and regular coffee to be brought down. Great work, Asa.\"</p><p>When we hang up, I pull on my undergarments then my clothes for the day: an emerald-green silk pantsuit. To add that little hint of sex appeal our guests have grown accustomed to I forgo a blouse, buttoning up the jacket to form a plunging neckline. I pair the ensemble with four-inch spiked heels, putting me a little closer to Rafe's six-foot-two height.</p><p>Speak of the devil; the scrumptious man walks out of the bathroom without even a towel on. The tight muscles of his lower torso all seem to angle in a slight v-pattern, drawing my eyes down to the glorious perfection I worshipped so lovingly last night. Saliva fills my mouth at the memory of the acrobatics my tongue performed on certain parts of my husband's anatomy.</p><p>\"Dria? Darling? My eyes are up here, love.\"</p><p>I break my stare from his nakedness and sure enough, there are his bright blue eyes.</p><p>\"You look at me like that for too long and my pants will fit me funny when we meet the others.\"</p><p>I glance longingly at the bed. \"I'd much rather skip it all and stay in bed with you today.\"</p><p>Rafe laughs. \"And miss the crazies showing up for this circus? Not on your life.\"</p><p>By half past four, we're all gathered around the sleek new conference room down the hall from the command center in the basement. The extensive space spans the entire footprint of the large hotel. We're under the west wing, which holds not only our apartment, but the hotel kitchen and the small adjacent dining room as well. The human companions, servants and bonded mates who usually vacation with the vampire masters during their stay need to eat somewhere.</p><p>\"I love that color on you,\" Joanna gushes to me from her close proximity in the next chair. \"It's such a gorgeous contrast to your skin and copper-colored hair.\"</p><p>As my lips thin in frustration, I try to school my outer countenance not to betray my annoyance. During the trap to catch Ivan, I held her mind in my control for hours and the after-effects still sway her conscious and unconscious behaviors.</p><p>Easy, darling. Rafe's mental voice conveys telepathically to me. She'll get over her blood lust infatuation. Give her time.</p><p>I know, but it's taking much longer than I'd like. Does he think calling me darling right now and telling me to be patient are going to help?</p><p>Well, you did possess her for hours, did you not? Rafe adds.</p><p>You know damn well I did. Why bring it up again?</p><p>Perhaps to get you to see two months is still too soon to expect results.</p><p>How come sometimes you're so smart and sometimes you're so not?</p><p>Humor colors his next response. Uh... 'cause I'm a guy?</p><p>\"Vivian? Does the green silk match your eyes?\" Joanna's voice pulls me out of the private moment I'm sharing with Rafe-bringing me crashing back to reality.</p><p>This time, I'm able to meet her blond beauty and saturnine face with a calm and friendly smile. \"I think it might. Thank you for noticing.\" I turn my focus to the men surrounding the table, effectively broadcasting with my body language that it's time to start and Joanna shouldn't expect more chitchat.</p><p>\"Good afternoon, everyone. Have you all had a chance to pour yourselves some coffee and look over the contents in your folders?\"</p><p>I look to Jonathan first; he's always the one I check with after Rafe. His blue plaid flannel shirt looks like a cousin to the one I saw him in yesterday. Reading the papers in front of him, the stocky werewolf doesn't notice my glance, so I move around the table.</p><p>Drew's capable brown eyes and amiable features smile over at me. Besides his burning desire this fall to avenge his wife's murder, I still don't know much about this quiet, unassuming man. His gaze and raised eyebrows indicate he has a question. I nod for him to continue.</p><p>\"The one here on Donald has me worried-it looks like Cy dug up a link to his past indicating he may have been involved with a string of gruesome murders in Europe a few decades back.\"</p><p>\"Correct,\" Asa interjects, \"but if you read on, you'll see there was no hint of his otherworldliness in the old police files. The Tribunal saw no need to charge him for his crimes once he agreed to stop his public killings.\"</p><p>I shudder at the thought of the justice the Tribunal of Ancients doled out in the past. If they had eliminated Ivan eight years ago, as promised when I turned him in, we would've never had the sadistic son-of-a-bitch sabotaging our property, raping a guest, killing an innocent man, and nearly draining Paul to death.</p><p>Rafe nods. \"Asa's right.\" Sensing my deep-seated anger, his solid thigh touches mine under the table. \"The Tribunal doesn't always make decisions that protect humanity. They look out for the vampire community-their prime directive is to ensure it stays secret.\"</p><p>\"I knew a vampire they proclaimed rogue about two decades ago,\" Joanna adds. \"He really went off the deep end one night, and decimated a five-screen movie theater full of people. I was new to the seethe, but all of us came in and helped burn the place down to hide the state of the corpses.\" She stares off in the distance, as if the visions from that night have come back alive for her to witness.</p><p>\"He left while we were covering his tracks and started to indiscriminately attack people he passed in the street,\" she continues. \"The news reporters had a field day with the wounds on the trail of bodies he left. I understood why they declared him rogue. He had to be stopped.\"</p><p>I clear my throat to get us back on track. The last thing I want is the next part of the conversation to dwell on the Tribunal enforcer sent to hunt down her seethe-mate. Having filled that role myself centuries ago, talking about it usually opens the door to a barrage of questions I prefer not to answer.</p><p>\"Well, we may not always agree with the Tribunal,\" I say, \"but as Joanna's story points out, sometimes they are necessary. Let's focus on the fact they are bringing us a convicted rogue to let the guests hunt down for fun.</p><p>\"Half a million dollars turned out to be the right price for action-starved vampires after all, despite my original trepidation when we'd first discussed this idea after Thanksgiving.\"</p><p>\"What about this Stanislaus dude?\" Jon asks, scanning a page from his dossier. \"He looks clean as a whistle.\"</p><p>Asa flips some pages in his folder. \"According to the file, he goes by Stan now. Yeah, I remember reading this one. Cy couldn't find a thing on him.\"</p><p>\"That means you fear him more,\" I add. \"He hasn't made a mistake yet.\"</p><p>A soft touch lands on my left arm, pulling my attention to Joanna, again.</p><p>\"How can you be so sure, Vivian?\"</p><p>\"All two-hundred-year-old vampires have killed-and killed often. Mark my words. If no record can be found surrounding his name, the only reason is because he's hidden the deaths extremely well.\"</p><p>Joanna shifts her attention to Drew. \"Would you agree with that, Drew?\"</p><p>The brown-haired man, appearing to be in his early twenties but has been dead for over one-hundred-and-fifty years, glances in the blond vampire's direction and a mask slips over his unremarkable features. \"I plead the fifth.\"</p><p>He's a hard nut to crack, that one. A smile strains at my lips and I allow a trace of it to peek through. \"Moving on. Any others stand out?\"</p><p>Paul, the youngest vampire of the seethe, finally speaks up. \"Sanji? This one caught my eye. She's bringing a lower vampire member of her seethe with her on this trip but states he won't be part of the hunt. Why?\"</p><p>\"I know her from my travels in India years ago,\" I answer. \"She's a good leader in her seethe, but hasn't had a human mate-bond in decades. I'm betting he's her current vampire lover and does not share her bloodthirsty pursuits. Look over her extensive file well-Sanji prefers to be subtle in her slaughter, but in three hundred years, she's left a lot of bodies behind her. She likes to keep more passive vampires with her to help balance her inner rage.\"</p><p>I let the information sink in then take a look around the table. \"Questions on the remaining hunters?\"</p><p>I'm answered by a shake of heads and Jonathan's trademark werewolf smirk.</p><p>\"Okay, let's discuss the plan of attack.\" I motion with a nod toward the muscle-bound, shaven-head vamp. \"Asa?\"</p><p>\"Thanks, Viv.\" Asa takes out a clipboard from under his dossier and scans it. \"Okay, all cameras are in place and operational. Rafe, Drew, and I are familiar with the control boards and equipment. Drew and I will work in shifts to monitor all the hunters continuously and utilize Rafe as a backup, if needed. Paul and Joanna will be out on the property watching as well. Seethe members will be carrying closed-circuit communicators at all times,\" he says, waiving one of the tricked out cell phones.</p><p>\"Jon will be with the werewolf guests.\" I add. \"How big is the pack that's coming?\"</p><p>The rugged, outdoorsy-looking man perks up at my question. \"I spoke with my old pack alpha, Romeo, earlier today.\" He checks some hand-written notes on the inside of his folder. \"He confirmed they have six coming and we've also got a lone werewolf from England, Melvyn, on the roster as well. Jet Natsuhara, our one vampire-master who prefers to be in his wolf form when hunting, may team up with the loner. The pack won't welcome either wolf to join them out in the woods, but they won't pick a fight either.\"</p><p>\"That's good to hear,\" Rafe says. \"You spent a lot of time with Jet when we hunted Ivan. Think he'll do okay with this unknown wolf?\"</p><p>\"I can't see why not. The dossier on Melvyn appears sound. Typical wolf who needed to strike out on his own because of differing pack attitudes-or perhaps he had no desire to challenge the current alpha.\"</p><p>Asa points out a detail Jon misses. \"Yeah, well, it says here his old pack leader was his father. No wonder he wouldn't fight him.\"</p><p>\"The primitive animal way of you dogs always makes my head spin,\" Joanna quips to Jon.</p><p>A pin could drop, and sound as loud as a gong, in the ensuing pregnant silence. I thought for a fifty-year-old vamp, she'd have developed more grace by now.</p><p>\"Joanna,\" I begin while my blood slowly boils. \"I would prefer to be the one to insult my servant, if it's required. Not have a junior member of my seethe do so.\"</p><p>She whips around to face me, wearing a stunned and horrified expression.</p><p>\"Please apologize to him now, before I get ugly,\" I say.</p><p>With a contrite expression, she looks at the handsome man sitting across from her, \"S-s-sorry, Jon. I meant it as a joke.\"</p><p>She's a child, love. Let it go. Rafe coos softly in my mind at the edge of my building anger.</p><p>You're the only one I know who'd categorize a being who's been walking the planet for seventy-three years as a child.</p><p>I call 'em like I see 'em. She's a kid to me.</p><p>Over thirty when we married, Rafe hasn't aged since our mate-bond ceremony sixty-five years ago. Most of our seethe seem like kids to him.</p><p>\"I'll let it slide this time, blondie,\" Jon smiles at Joanna. \"But keep the claws in, would you? Not all wolves act with brains first.\"</p><p>\"But,\" I can't help but add, \"if you slip up like that in front of one of our Were guests, I will not be happy. Got it?\"</p><p>Joanna looks down at the table, \"Yes.\"</p><p>\"Good. Moving on. Paul, do you have any questions about what is expected of you during the next week?\"</p><p>\"Um... \" The once-plump chef has slimmed down with his new all-liquid diet, he looks like a completely new man since his turning. \"I wondered about my cooking duties.\"</p><p>A groan goes up from Jon's side of the table.</p><p>\"Hey-I'm getting better at choosing the right amount for spices,\" Paul says. \"I'll be back to my old self in no time.\"</p><p>\"Uh-huh, sure.\" Jon's wry expression pins the two-month-old vampire. \"Do me a favor and don't attempt your Bolognese sauce again until you're sure you remember the recipe right, okay?\"</p><p>\"Focus, people!\" My hand slams onto the table as my words snap out over the small space. \"I'll have you on rotation a few times in the kitchen during the week, Paul, but not like your normal shifts. We need you reporting to Asa and Drew this week and letting them direct where they need you on the property to monitor the hunt, okay?\"</p><p>Paul's face seems to clear with a direct assignment. \"Yeah, that's fine.\"</p><p>\"Vivian, will we be using Jerry's help at all this week?\" Asa asks. \"The canny old guy earned sniper status back in Vietnam.\" The young vampire's voice takes on a hint of awe as he continues. \"I heard from one of the employees, Jerry's father was part of a special forces team during World War II known as Castner's Cutthroats. Have you ever researched those guys?\" Asa looks excitedly around the table to see if anyone else shares his passion for history.</p><p>Jerry, the salt-n-pepper haired engineer, has worked here since The V V Inn opened back in the early '90s. The cagey old bastard also maintains a supply of silver bullets he casts himself.</p><p>I hide rolling my eyes at his enthusiasm, but just barely. If I were to offer any encouragement, he'd tell us everything he's found out, I'm sure. \"Thanks, Asa. I am aware of all the workers' pasts. Jerry will be stationed at the employee apartments, just like last time. Obviously, at his age, he won't be on guard the whole time, but he's organized some excellent big-game hunters from the employee force to rotate shifts. They'll watch over everyone during the mandatory curfew.\"</p><p>Drew clears his throat, drawing eyes with the sound. \"How are the employees handling the 'stay at home unless it's your shift' regulation? Did you pull a vamp-whammy on them all?\"</p><p>\"Doing so was tedious,\" I answer, \"but necessary.\" Implanting an urge in all one hundred and forty of them to follow the instructions of the curfew took about two weeks, but had to be done. All vampires can mind-control humans, but only Rafe's aware of my master-manipulator abilities with other vampires.</p><p>Rafe presents a big, toothy salesman-grin. \"There's a big bonus for them if they listen and a refusal to pay death benefits if they don't.\"</p><p>I smile at the ingeniousness of the encouragement. \"Clever suggestion you had, hon. Positively wicked.\" Pushing my thigh up against his under the table, I give him a loving nudge. \"Here's to hoping it works.\"</p><p>Manipulating people to do something for their own safety doesn't twinge my conscience as much as some of the other things I've done over my long, undead existence-that's for damn sure.</p><p>\"Okay, so far we've covered: One-some of the whackos participating.\" I raise my hand, starting to count each item off on my fingers. \"Two-the major jobs you all will be doing. Three-employee safety.\" My last finger comes up, \"And the wolves. So that leaves...\" I check my notebook lying open on my file folder, aware that all eyes are on me and it's obvious what we haven't spoken of yet.</p><p>\"Ah... yes. The rogue vampire.\" A wave of excitement ripples around the table with the mention of the soon-to-be-hunted criminal. \"Any news yet from the Tribunal, Asa?\"</p><p>\"Nothing. They're holding their cards close to their chest with the identity. Do you think they're going to make us wait until they arrive to find out?\"</p><p>I snort inelegantly at his last question. \"The Tribunal answers to no one. They'll do as they damn well please, and yes, I have a feeling they plan on surprising us at the last possible moment.\"</p><p>\"Be sure to contact Cy as soon as we get a name,\" Rafe instructs Asa. \"He'll be able to do a thorough check without any of the Tribunal members aware of what we're doing.\"</p><p>\"Why all the subterfuge?\" Joanna asks.</p><p>Innocent thing, she hasn't been around long enough to see even close to as much as I have during my nearly six centuries on earth. \"Because, darling, you should never trust an ancient vampire, let alone a ruling class of them.\"</p><p>Before anyone has a chance to fire questions at my daring closing salvo, my cell phone vibrates on my hip. Caller ID indicates it's Bob, one of the ground crew working the airstrip to maintain its clearance for the arrivals today.</p><p>\"Yes?\"</p><p>\"The first plane landed. We've got a group of six on their way up to the main building.\"</p><p>\"Thanks, Bob. Let me know when more arrive.\"</p><p>\"Will do.\"</p><p>And so it begins. The hunters have come. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Rafe</p><p>As the others file out, I lay my hand on the sleeve of Dria's jacket. Wait, my love. Let them all go ahead.</p><p>What's on your mind?</p><p>Joanna worries me. Are you sure her obsession is connected only to the blood lust?</p> <p>All young vamps want the blood of master vamps to increase their own power. What else could it be?</p><p>Has her mind been damaged permanently by your prolonged occupation and control?</p><p>No, Dria's voice comes through loud and firm. Angie suffered worse for a full year before I rescued her from Ivan's sadistic dual raping of her mind and body. She came out fine.</p><p>She did not come out fine, I gently remind her. Best not to anger her before greeting the guests. Your considerable skills repaired her mind and you saved her.</p><p>Are you suggesting I go back in and try to fix Joanna more?</p> <p>I back off from the topic; happy I've planted the seed. No liebling, it was just a thought. Give her more time before you take such a risk at exposing yourself.</p><p>Reaching out, I pull her forward with a gentle tug on her glorious long hair. My mouth molds to her fuller one and lingers over a kiss. Snaking my tongue between her lips, I graze the sharp peaks of her canines, deliberately urging the involuntary reaction of her predatory nature.</p><p>Dria's hand comes forward, her fingers run through my short hair grasping it to pull me closer and deepen the kiss. In return, she draws a base reaction from me. Blood rushes from every portion of my body to my cock. It never fails to amaze me that no matter how often we make love, she can still pull a reaction from me at any time.</p><p>I break off the exchange-despite my growing physical discomfort, this is not a good time. \"Later. We've got work to do.\"</p><p>The pout underneath her cute button nose is almost comical. \"Fine. For now. But you know I'd make them all wait for a chance to break in the new conference room.\"</p><p>The urge to satisfy the lust in her eyes makes me almost give in. \"How about we do so when this week ends and no one is manning the control room, like they are now?\"</p> <p>\"Good point. You win.\"</p><p>As we rise to leave, I reach down to readjust myself before moving on. Goddamn dress pants; they never look good with an erection. Why does she make me wear this shit?</p><p>I heard that. And it's because you look damn good in it.</p><p>\"Yeah, yeah, whatever. Lead on, dear. Let's get this show on the road.\"</p><p>Dria heads down the hall past a holding room for Paul-designed for a young vampire's darker moments while learning to control the blood lust-and a few other empty rooms that haven't been assigned yet. The work Asa and Drew have done down here, and in such a short time, really has been miraculous. The dingy, concrete-block basement with hidden escape tunnels and ladders leading up to guestroom closets now looks like a modern office building-but one with no windows.</p><p>I follow Dria's silk-covered ass, barely registering the many flat screens and keyboards set up in the large command center at the end of the hall.</p><p>\"Come on, boys. Let's go greet the new guests,\" she calls out, walking by.</p><p>Asa and Drew look up from their posts as we pass, exchanging a look.</p> <p>\"Both of us?\" Asa asks.</p><p>\"Yes,\" comes Dria's reply from halfway across the old basement workroom. \"You'll learn a lot more from observing the arrivals than you will from their pretty dossiers. Trust me.\"</p><p>The four of us head up the stairs leading into our personal suite. I'm not happy with this current entrance to the basement. Expanding the seethe was my idea, but when I first suggested it, I hadn't bargained on a bunch of vamps coming and going through my personal space at all hours of the day. I'm seriously considering Asa's expensive idea to cut a hole in the hotel kitchen's floor and put in a secret spiral staircase.</p><p>Dria's energy feels even and low key. She seems like she's in a good frame of mind to meet the newcomers. I wonder... You don't plan on touching these hunters to read them, do you?</p><p>Hell no! Not if I can help it. They can keep their freaky-ass desires-to maim, rip-apart, kill, and drink the blood of a rogue-all to themselves, thank you very much. Ugh. Why did we do this again?</p><p>We pass through the small-scale commercial kitchen of the hotel and cross into the dining room.</p><p>Not only to earn our new members some huge pocket change, but hopefully to track down which member of the Tribunal wants you dead.</p><p>The list of vampires who want me dead is way too long, my dear. I made a lot of enemies during the two decades I was an enforcer.</p><p>I've always wondered exactly how much of Dria's life she's hidden from me. At times, I see a lot when she rests from the sun-her emotions and thoughts roiling close to the surface. The disturbing images I do see make me wish I could take all of the pain away from her and take it on myself.</p><p>Well then, I assure her, rest easy that no matter who you face in the future, you will always have me by your side to help defeat them.</p><p>With my own Wolf Killer at my side, I know I'll be fine.</p><p>I stumble but catch myself easily. You haven't referred to me by that nickname in ages. Any reason to bring up my slaughter of those heartless Nazis now?</p><p>The horrible part of my life when I became a crazed man bent on revenge-stalking down the men responsible for my daughter and first wife's death-seems like a lifetime ago. One thing I love about Dria: She knows all my demons and accepts them fully.</p><p>Dria's voice, sounding cold and detached, comes through my mind, Facing anyone from the Tribunal always makes me think of slaughter.</p><p>I think she's still worried there are parts of her past so horrific, I would be repulsed to learn of them. Nothing could keep me from loving her, no matter what.</p><p>Our private conversation comes to an end as we enter the lobby. The entire seethe lounges in deceptively calm poses around the large space. Each one positioned to watch the interchange between Dria and the hunters as they arrive.</p><p>This is one time I wish Dria had a telepathic bond open with all of the seethe vampires. It would be a good way for all impressions to be shared instantaneously. But I doubt I could stand more than five minutes of hearing that damn werewolf lust after my wife - and no doubt opening a communal bond would include the furball too.</p><p>From outside the main entrance comes a screeching metal-on-wheels sound of the van door sliding open to release our new guests. A moment later the front doors burst open; the chill Arctic temperatures flood the area like a tidal wave of frost.</p><p>\"Good afternoon,\" Dria addresses the arrivals. \"Thank you for coming to share a unique week with us at The V V Inn. My name is Vivian and I'm one of the owners.\"</p><p>I notice Dria's habit to shake hands is omitted. Her stance appears welcoming, but her hands gesture the guests forward rather than to her. The six people shuffle into the vaulted three-story space toward the front desk as the door behind them closes.</p><p>A man who reminds me of Ricardo Montalban from the Wrath of Kahn, minus the mullet and clothed in a sleek suit, stands closest to Dria. He extends his hand to her in greeting.</p><p>Damn! Jumping forward from my spot next to her, I quickly grasp his hand while Dria pretends to not see his offer.</p><p>A flicker of surprise crosses his face as the warmth from my human hand encounters the slight chill of his vampiric one. As we shake, a tingle of power sparks between the two of us.</p><p>\"Thanks for staying with us. I'm Rafe, Vivian's mate, and co-owner of the inn.\"</p><p>\"I'm Donald Swanson. I've heard a lot about your previous properties and this one as well. I'm looking forward to this trip.\"</p><p>Nearly two centuries ago, Dria started running vacation properties for the undead. She realized it was a great way to use her power as a master manipulator without exposing herself to her fellow vampires. Manipulators are still captured, hooded in silver, and put to death when discovered to ensure no vampire can ever mind-control another.</p><p>\"Ah, yes, Mr. Swanson,\" I say, using a respectful address of the master vampire hailing from Bath, England. If I remember correctly from the dossier, he's the one connected to the string of murders spanning five decades. \"How was your flight from across the pond?\"</p><p>\"Good, thank you. I must admit I didn't expect you to have power with such an average mate.\" I know he's referring to the spark when we shook.</p><p>Dria's head whips around while greeting the next guest in line. Hiding her true age from the guests comes second nature to her-but my own shielding skills are lacking. The small amount of blood I drink from her not only keeps me from aging, but infuses me with some of her extensive power as well.</p><p>\"Yes, well,\" I wink into the killer's eyes with a calmness I can't completely claim, \"I never said she was my first vampire.\"</p><p>Donald nods his head, accepting my lie over sensing there might be more to my curvy wife, and then proceeds to move past me to check in.</p><p>Dria throws me a quick look before turning away, Whew! That one was close. Perhaps you shouldn't touch some of the guests either, studly, eh? My wife's shock colors her mental voice, but her outward appearance is calm and refined as she pretends she didn't hear the entire exchange.</p><p>Yes. Agreed.</p><p>\"Rafe, darling. I'd like you to meet Stephen and Stan as well.\"</p><p>Christ. These two appear to be average guys, until you look into their eyes. There's no way that mask of crazy stays hidden all the time. I guess they're letting it all hang out on vacation because the average neighbor must surely be able to see what I see, right?</p><p>Nodding my hello to Stephen, I'm surprised the Johnnie Depp look-alike from Sweeney Todd, The Demon Barber of Fleet Street, didn't have a thicker dossier. Despite his skinny frame and the fact that I outweigh him by seventy pounds, he scares the shit out of me. Wow, Dria is right. This is going to be one odd week.</p><p>Stan, the next vampire, breaks into a good ol' boy grin. His relaxed I'm-your-friend expression makes him look safe at first glance. He stands shorter than me, a little stouter, and has a receding hairline. Stan is the one with a squeaky clean, no-info-found dossier. I can see why-the insanity lurks in his eyes, but you could honestly think it's part of his act.</p><p>Nodding hello is my only required action in our greeting, thankfully. I'm not even sure what to say to either of them. \"Hi, glad you whack-jobs paid half-a-million to visit our hotel to hunt a fellow vampire?\" This is not a normal setup for us, to say the least. I can only imagine what hell is going to break loose over the next five days. It won't be anything like the sexcapades we normally get from the vampire guests. Those I can handle fine. Dria runs a great show with her master illusions, mental projections, and subtle manipulation of their minds.</p><p>Once they walk past me, I'm able to take in the next two vampires. The woman stands slightly in front of her male companion. Both are Indian and so good-looking, they could have walked off the set of the latest Bollywood flick, which is one area my film knowledge is sadly lacking.</p><p>\"Pleasure to meet you both,\" she says. \"I'm Sanji and this is my companion, Vikram. He will not be participating in the hunt, but has come to relax instead.\"</p><p>At the mention of his name, Vikram steps forward with an offer to shake my hand in greeting. The calm expression of the man triggers an automatic response of manners and before I know it my hand is in his. There's something about him-he has charisma.</p><p>Instead of a spark, his peaceful energy flows up my arm in an almost subtle flare of warmth. I can see why the bloodthirsty Sanji keeps him by her side. When she can no longer control her urges, he could bring her back from the edge of darkness - just like I sometimes do for Dria.</p><p>\"Welcome, Vikram.\" Our hands drop. \"The inn was designed as a retreat for relaxation and decadence. I'm sure you will enjoy yourself while Sanji is on the hunt.\"</p><p>As the pair moves past us, the last hunter by the door shrugs off her floor-length fur coat. She's a stunning woman, nearly as tall as me. Her dark Brazilian good looks, palm-sized breasts, and round, fuckable ass make me think of an Amazonian porn goddess. I quickly slam my mental guards up into place.</p><p>No need for Dria to know what I'm thinking all the time.</p><p>Approaching us both, the woman does the absolute worst thing she ever could have done. She ignores Dria and offers her hand to me.</p><p>\"I'm Bebe.\" She pronounces it like Beh-beh. \"And I want to know if the redhead shares.\"</p><p>Dria's control remains in place and the freaky calm she sometimes gets before she explodes into violence spreads across her face. She grasps the younger vampire's hand in what looks like quite a firm grip-that is if I'm reading the flare of annoyance over Bebe's face correctly.</p><p>Dria stares into the woman's irritated eyes. I can tell the moment my wife slips into the exotic beauty's mind. Bebe's haughty expression slackens and a timid smile replaces her earlier predatory look.</p><p>\"Welcome, Bebe,\" Dria's strong voice carries out across the room. \"What an amusing thought. I never would have pegged you as one with such an amazing sense of humor. Please check in, the gentleman at the front desk will be going over the house rules for feeding shortly.\"</p><p>Bebe walks past me, as if she wasn't about to tear my clothes off and offer to suck me off just a moment ago.</p><p>Is it safe to bet you're going to picture me as that tall, ignorant slut next time I'm on my knees?</p><p>Dria's voice holds no trace of anger; only amusement at what could have been a fatal mistake for the aforementioned ignorant slut.</p><p>Now, why would I do that when I have your perfection to gaze upon?</p><p>Puh-lease! Amazonian porn goddess? You need to work on your shielding, babe.</p><p>I'm going to remain silent and not dig my hole any deeper.</p><p>Good for you, hon. You do that. But I will tell you one thing to rock your little fantasy world.</p><p>Hmm? Do I dare even wonder at what she's hinting at?</p><p>Bebe prefers women. But she does like to pin her male victims down, while in a sixty-nine position, rip their cocks off with her teeth, and then drink them dry from the wound.</p><p>I think I'm going to be sick at the image her words paint. My body gives an involuntary shudder.</p><p>Dria looks over at what I'm sure is a horrible expression on my face and says, Hope that doesn't mess up your musings too much, my love.</p><p>Ah, the joys of being married to a woman who knows your every thought and can read the desires of everyone she touches. It's not always conducive to enjoying an active imagination.</p><p>Have I told you lately you're a freak? I can't resist one last jab. I love you, but damn, sometimes your extra sharing is harsh.</p><p>Her mental laughter sounds loud and clear as she gently closes the link between us. The phone vibrates again at her waist, just as the next van pulls up.</p><p>Liam and Francesca, guests who were here during the Ivan incident, stroll in. Liam looks stoic as always. He's like a movie extra from Braveheart, with a similar intensity and Scottish lilt. Francesca could pass for a Raquel Welch double, she's so beautiful.</p><p>\"Good to see you both again so soon,\" Dria says as her phone clicks shut. She reaches out to give Francesca a hug. \"Your help on the last visit was invaluable.\"</p><p>Liam cracks a small grin. \"We had to come back for one of your dungeon rooms upstairs, if nothing else.\"</p><p>Francesca giggles musically in shared remembrance. \"Now hush, Liam. I bet we won't get a tour like that ever again.\"</p><p>\"I'm sure,\" Dria diplomatically interjects, \"that you're here not only for the fun rooms on the third floor but also for the excitement the upcoming hunt promises.\"</p><p>Jet Natsuhara, who traveled with his mate Matt in the van as well, chooses that moment to introduce hearty back slaps and hand shaking into the mix.</p><p>\"Not going to mist around the property this time are you, Liam?\" asks the tall Asian vampire with a slight grin. \"I bet this hunt will be more on the ground.\"</p><p>\"No, not this time. But I did bring my broad-handled axe so I wouldn't have to use the resort's inferior sparring-quality choices.\"</p><p>\"I'll have you know,\" I feel inclined to point out, \"Asa has remedied the weapons problem. We are now equipped with a plethora of items to choose from.\"</p><p>\"All of the highest quality, I assure you,\" adds my smiling wife.</p><p>Nods of approval come from the vampires, as the group of four head to the front desk to get their room keys.</p><p>Who was on the call you received? I ask, referring to the vibration on her cell a little while ago.</p><p>It was Bob. Dria answers while leaning in to give me soft kiss on the mouth. The Tribunal has arrived with the rogue. He's driving them up.</p><p>Ah... goody. We'll finally find out whom the guests get to hunt.</p><p>Heading up to their rooms on the second floor's north and east wings, the hunters and their companions leave the gleaming wooden lobby area via the dual winding staircases. We don't have long to wait for the final batch of undead. Within minutes, the sound of snow-chained tires is distinct on the driveway outside. The moment has arrived for us to see who decided to deliver this criminal all the way from Argentina for two million dollars in the Tribunal's coffers.</p><p>Dria's face freezes into a mask. She must know one of the minds exiting the van from a previous encounter because as far as I know, she can't see through walls.</p><p>The door opens and a small woman with curly, blond hair walks in.</p><p>Venom drips from my wife's tone as she utters one word.</p><p>\"You.\" </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Asa</p><p>From my vantage point in the lobby, I have a clear view of Vivian and Rafe. The entrance of the small, curly-haired woman in a black leather duster causes the tension level to skyrocket and an angry buzz of power washes over me. Wonder what has Vivian's panties up her butt?</p><p>\"Well hello, 'Alexandria the Great',\" the blonde sneers to Vivian. \"You don't know how happy I was to escort our criminal up here.\"</p><p>Vivian looks pissed off, but before she can form a response the Tribunal member pushes past her.</p> <p>\"You've certainly done a lot to this little frozen corner of hell.\"</p><p>The psychic energy level increases, and I realize it's not coming from Vivian, but from the newcomer. Hmmm.... She appears to be leading with a show of strength, which usually indicates an underlying fear when displayed at a first encounter with an enemy.</p><p>\"Would you mind pulling your power back in, Coraline?\" Vivian states more than asks. \"If you're here to represent the Ancients, as one of their trusted Inner Circle, you should try to show a little class.\"</p><p>Coraline touches a light blue pin on her jacket lapel, while anger colors her expression. She pushes out farther at the verbal slap from Vivian, the agitated energy feels like a nest of bees pulsing against my aura. My stomach starts to turn. God, I hope I don't puke. The others will razz me about it for weeks.</p><p>\"What's the problem, Alexandria, darling? Afraid to have one of your elders embarrass you in front of your brand-new seethe?\"</p> <p>I'm not sure if the woman shields any portion of her strength or not. But, even an inexperienced vampire, like me, could see her power signature isn't as high as Vivian's-that is, if they've ever had a taste of the innkeeper's wrath. Boss lady pitched me to my knees one time and almost made me pee myself, a fact I will never admit to, even under torture. Not something I care to repeat anytime soon. Judging from their interaction, Vivian can successfully shield her power even from vamps older than herself.</p><p>Shit. I'm going to need to find a garbage can soon. Glancing around I note Joanna looks equally green. What's up with this crazy Tribunal bitch?</p><p>Paul shoots up from his spot on the couch and races to the front desk. He barely makes it to the trashcan in time. The lobby fills with the pitiful sounds of his retching, followed closely by the smell of regurgitated blood.</p><p>\"Enough!\" Vivian's face betrays her first hint of irritation.</p><p>Quick as a wink, the buzz shuts down and the nausea leaves me. Whew. I would have tossed my cookies next.</p><p>Coraline's face registers shock, but I'm not sure over what. Did she not expect us to get sick, or did Vivian somehow make her stop and take the older vampire by surprise?</p> <p>\"You insult yourself and those you represent with your childish display, Coraline. Put our differences behind us for the week, please.\" Smoothing her hair behind one ear, Vivian stares the newcomer down.</p><p>Any response from the other woman is cut off by the main door opening. Three large male vampires enter with a much smaller figure bracketed between them. I'd like to say I could take the men individually in a fight-and if we'd still been human, I probably could. But I seriously doubt it now. This power and vampire age shit is humbling.</p><p>I pat the Smith and Wesson 500 at my side, reassured at least these fuckers can't outrun my silver.</p><p>Glancing over to Drew's post near the pool entrance, I motion to him with a series of subtle hand movements, conveying my intent to move closer to the front of the foyer. He nods in understanding. I don't like having so many unknown forces near Vivian and Rafe.</p><p>I slip in behind the four new arrivals as the doors whisk closed against the frigid air. Rafe looks up, meeting my eyes, but gives no other outward indication to reveal my presence. The bodyguard vamps stand about ten feet from me and they're facing away. Obviously, the older vampires can hear me; I never intended this to be a covert movement. More in line with letting them know we aren't slackers and are watching them.</p><p>Coraline moves near the foursome. \"I'll refrain from slinging barbs for the moment,\" she says casually, \"but don't think this is over, Alexandria.\"</p><p>The three guards are dressed all in black and wear hooded masks. I know most fellow vampires love drama, but what's the point of the hood? It's got to impair their vision in a fight.</p><p>Long, dark hair falls past the shoulders of the slight frame of the silver-chained woman the men surround. She can't weigh much more than a hundred pounds. This is the badass vamp criminal? She's the size of a child.</p> <p>I alter my opinion when I gaze upon her delicate, almond-shaped brown eyes and linger on her tiny waist. Maybe more of a curvy, petite eighteen-year-old with classic china doll good looks.</p><p>I always did like the exotic Asian beauties.</p><p>\"Tell me her name, Cora.\" Vivian says.</p><p>\"You always were one for business first, weren't you? I'm enjoying this little moment. After all, it was a long flight.\"</p><p>The old blond must have recovered from her shock because she decides to pace around Vivian and Rafe in a show of arrogance.</p><p>\"I always wondered what made you such a successful enforcer. You came on board almost a hundred years after me, and they still haven't had another one like you.\"</p><p>A small gasp from Joanna across the room sends Cora's head whipping around.</p><p>\"Haven't told them how old you are? Or what you did before you set up shop as a veritable madame for the undead?\"</p><p>\"Does this pretty speech have a point, Cora?\" Vivian glances at her wrist in what looks like a show of annoyance or possibly boredom, I can't tell.</p><p>\"No, not really. I volunteered to stoop to the level of delivery girl specifically to come up here to torment you. You've still got a lot of enemies in the Tribunal, myself included.\" She says the last with a grin on her face.</p><p>\"Pity.\" Vivian looks away and then pointedly back at Cora. \"They wouldn't need my money so badly if the Ancients had invested more wisely in the stock market back in the late nineties.\"</p><p>Cora's disgust shows clearly on her face. Man, she's one nasty bitch. Wonder what Vivian did to her in the past. Vivian watches her with a clear sociopathic detachment, which makes me change that thought real quick.</p><p>Nope, on closer consideration, I've got no desire to know what happened between these two. All I know is I'd rather be on Vivian's good side than any other place else on Earth.</p><p>\"Enjoy this hunt you all have planned. I'm sure it will be the last,\" Coraline says.</p><p>\"Can we get on with this please?\" Without waiting for an answer, my master turns her attention back to business. \"The theater room in the north wing,\" Vivian indicates the hall past the front desk with a sweep of her arm, \"will be where you can introduce the felon to the hunters, go over her crimes, and state the rules.\"</p><p>Vivian walks up to the men near the rogue. With one searing look from her intense green eyes they take a small step to the side, giving her access to the prisoner. \"Have you eaten lately?\"</p><p>The smoking-hot Asian vampire shakes her head.</p><p>\"Paul? You okay?\" Vivian asks, turning toward him.</p><p>His voice reveals no indication of his earlier puking. \"Yup.\"</p><p>\"Good. Whip her up a pot of blood coffee. Heavy on the blood.\"</p><p>Without a backward glance, Paul heads off in the direction of the kitchen to fulfill the order.</p><p>\"Drew,\" Vivian continues, \"lead the enforcers and their charge to the theater. Asa, follow up and stand guard.\"</p><p>As we head down the hallway, I hear Vivian issue a few more commands.</p><p>\"Joanna, personally call every hunter and inform them the briefing starts in thirty minutes.\"</p><p>The sound of Joanna's steps, rushing to obey, follows us down the hall.</p><p>\"Coraline,\" Vivian's voice sounds sickly sweet this time. \"Could we speak privately, please?\"</p><p>The doors ahead swing open at Drew's push and we usher the four inside before I can hear a response from the Tribunal's representative in the lobby.</p><p>Damn.</p><p>Forty-five minutes later, the theater has less than a quarter of its seats filled with our seven vampire hunters. I sent a text to Cy once the name Emiko was announced by Coraline two minutes ago. Hopefully, he'll pull up some info on the fugitive soon. The quiet guards continue to stand at attention near the movie screen, but have not removed their hoods. Drew informed me earlier, in a whispered tone, that the hood protects their identity on this mission while they remain active enforcers for the Tribunal. Not being recognized would give them the element of surprise when tracking a rogue sentenced for death.</p><p>He made it sound like being chosen as an enforcer was an honor, but I'm not so sure. To be a solider in a war is different from being an assassin on retainer. But maybe that's just me.</p><p>The wacky Tribunal chick looks like she's finally going to share some more details. I'm happy to see she's managed to be in the room with Viv for more than five minutes and not started to spout a bunch of hate. I wonder how Vivian managed such a feat from the woman.</p><p>\"Vivian informs me the werewolves, who will also attend this hunt, have been caught flying in some bad weather but will be landing within the hour. Since the wolves hunt mainly by smell, they have agreed we can do this portion without them.\" She paces in front of the small group, clearly loving the attention. \"We'll wait until they're settled in and ready to go before officially starting the hunt.\"</p><p>At this point, Coraline elaborately gestures to the Asian woman standing among the hulking men. As if everyone hadn't already been checking out the felon.</p><p>\"Behold, your very own chance to be an enforcer and hunt a fellow vampire.\"</p><p>The small, round-faced vampire lifts her face defiantly to the group.</p><p>\"Emiko was once an enforcer herself. She served the Tribunal for five years before deciding she would rather expose our kind in a bloodthirsty killing spree-where six drained bodies of Argentine government officials were left virtually on the Tribunal's doorstep.</p><p>\"For the trouble she caused with our relations in Buenos Aires and in murdering key humans collaborating with the Tribunal, she has been sentenced to twelve years of starvation while wearing silver chains. Emiko chose this hunt instead.\" Cora's showmanship has come screaming to the surface, she seems to be thriving on the drama in this pretty little speech. \"Since maintaining one's sanity past ten years in silver has never been achieved, I think she made a wise choice.</p><p>\"If she can elude capture for five days she will gain her freedom and be allowed to pay the Tribunal a high yearly stipend for her release.\"</p><p>Nods from the master vampires gathered indicate their understanding.</p><p>\"If you happen to catch Emiko and can kill her before she kills you, she is yours to drain.\" At the surge of excitement this brings in the room, Coraline raises her voice in a dramatic flourish. \"Beware. She is over two hundred and fifty years old and highly skilled as an enforcer. She will not be easy prey and she will be hunting you-even as you hunt her.\"</p><p>The following silence feels charged. I know from our briefing, Vivian plans to announce some hotel guidelines next.</p><p>\"Thank you, Coraline. Please send our collective thanks to the Tribunal of Ancients for allowing this hunt to take place. There are a few guidelines I'd like to point out.\"</p><p>Vivian raises two small silver manacles and affixes one to Emiko's right wrist. She moves the heavy silver chains confining the woman to do so, but manages it quickly enough with the help of thick gloves protecting her hands. The second one clicks into position and the chains slide back into place.</p><p>\"These bracelets hold a liquid silver poison and a needle to inject it into your bloodstream,\" she says looking Emiko directly in the eyes. \"It will not kill, but will incapacitate you if you try and leave the fifteen square mile compound. The paralyzation will allow any hunter who finds you to kill you easily.\"</p><p>Vivian turns to face the rest of the room. \"There will be no killing of my employees, on either side-mistake or otherwise. To do so means the hunt is called off, no money is returned, I send your asses home, and Emiko goes back to Brazil in chains.</p><p>\"I know you all agreed to this ahead of time, but I want to make sure we're clear. Are we?\"</p><p>Vivian takes a moment to meet the eyes of each hunter and Emiko's as well. Everyone nods.</p><p>\"Oh yes, we wouldn't want to set 'Alexandria the Great' loose on the guests now, would we?\" chimes in Coraline.</p><p>Damn, I guess it was too much to hope she'd hold her venom in for long. I first heard the title in a conversation a few months ago. Unfortunately, I couldn't turn up anything from my private research on what this Alexandria the Great, may have done.</p><p>A gasp goes up in the crowd from half the vampire masters. It's safe to assume the older ones have heard of my master's exploits in her old role, even if they didn't know it was her. Wonder if I can discreetly pump some of them for info or whether that's not a wise move.</p><p>Emiko's reaction is unexpected. She tilts her head at Vivian, examining the older vampire with an expression I can't decipher. Sometimes, I really hate being the young one and the low man on the totem pole. Like there's so much the generals are keeping from the enlisted men. I hated it in the military and I hate it now.</p><p>One thing I learned from the Army-there's a time and a place for questions. And if a person wants answers, they need to determine when the best time is to ask those questions.</p><p>Rafe comes forward to remove the silver chains from Emiko. Of everyone in the room, he's the only one immune to the painful effects of the metal.</p><p>Coraline holds off from any more parting shots at Vivian and announces, \"Emiko will have a head start of three hours. The rest of you should rest, feed, meditate-prepare yourself however you choose. The vampires and the werewolves will all start out at the same time.\"</p><p>Rafe discreetly hands Emiko a map and a small flashlight with which to read it. It will help her to know where the sensors for the silver poison have been placed. He whispers to her while opening the door, but all of the undead hear him, \"Heed the warning about killing the employees or it won't be the chains you need to fear. It will be Alexandria.\"</p><p>No reply comes from Emiko as she slips into the darkness.</p><p>As the hunters file out of the room, Drew and I trail them down the hall.</p><p>\"I'm heading to the command center to make sure everything is in place,\" I tell him.</p><p>\"Good. I'm going to check with Jon and see if the wolves have landed yet.\"</p><p>He heads off through the lobby toward the front doors, and I turn right to enter the dining room. The guests of the hunters are hanging out sipping hot drinks. By the scent, it appears the humans have coffee and the Indian vampire has some blood mixed in spiced hot tea with milk. Ugh, even I wouldn't drink that.</p><p>I use my master key card to swipe the locked door in the kitchen, which allows me access to the owners' suite. Plastic cases, from Rafe's most recent movie marathon, litter the coffee table. The basement door lies in the hall beyond their compact kitchen. I head down, trigger the secret door, and pause a moment when I detect another vampire.</p><p>Surprisingly, it's Joanna who awaits me downstairs in the command center. \"Hey, Joanna. What do you need?\"</p><p>\"You.\"</p><p>\"Excuse me?\"</p><p>Joanna walks behind me and locks the sliding wall-door separating the old cinderblock basement workroom from the hidden complex of basement rooms.</p><p>\"I have a need and I want you to scratch it.\"</p><p>Does she mean what I think she means? Is this my lucky day?</p><p>Joanna starts to unbutton her blouse. It is my lucky day-hot damn! Before I know it, she's throwing the shirt across the room to land on a chair and I'm left staring at a gorgeous set of tits in a black bra.</p><p>\"Um, okay.\" Never one to pass up an opportunity, that's me. \"Here or in one of the side rooms?\"</p><p>\"Anywhere is fine.\" She starts in on her belt and my eyes are drawn away from her chest. \"Wasn't that info on Vivian odd? Can you believe she was an enforcer before?\"</p><p>\"Hmm.\" There, that seems like a safe answer.</p><p>\"That angry cheerleader-looking bitch from the Tribunal was really old.\"</p><p>\"Hmm?\" Blood is hightailing to my crotch in a pounding rush, words seem beyond my scope right now.</p><p>\"I've gotten pretty good at reading the age of older vamps in the past decade. I'd say Coraline's power signature felt over seven hundred or close to it.\"</p><p>\"Hmm.\" Man, she talks too much. When will she be naked? Maybe I can help. Moving closer, I run my hand down her side and around the back. I've got my hand on the bra clasp, about to spring her breasts free when she stoops to lower her pants over her hips.</p><p>She's only wearing a tiny black thong and the sight paralyzes me for an instant. Now that I look at her awesome body, it occurs to me I've never been with a vampire lover before. I wonder what it will be like? Geez, I need to turn my brain off and focus on getting my dick in her.</p><p>\"Have you ever had vampire blood before?\"</p><p>I raise my eyebrows in question. Obviously I've had Vivian's, we all have.</p><p>She looks down and away. \"No, I mean from a lover?\"</p><p>She knows I'm under two years old, so I guess it's a reasonable question. \"No.\"</p><p>Joanna's gaze returns to mine. \"We're going to have loads of fun then.\" Her eyes fill with heat as she reaches for my shirt.</p><p>I quickly move to help; pulling it over my head, tossing it in the same direction hers went.</p><p>\"I'm going to bite you...\" she says, \"and I'm going to let you bite me... and then I'm going to...\"</p><p>God, she's got to stop talking. I think I know what will shut her up. I unzip my pants and heft my erection out for her to see.</p><p>\"Oh... But first, I'm going to pay some special attention down here...\" With that last comment, she sinks to her knees.</p><p>Her hot, moist mouth engulfs the head of my cock and I have one last thought before the pleasurable sensations overtake me: Ahh, blessed silence... </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Joanna</p><p>Men are so damn easy. I'm glad I thought to come downstairs and seduce this newbie. As the skin of his cock slowly passes between my lips, I gradually get into the moment. The scent of clean Ivory soap with an undercurrent of strong, male muskiness assails my nose.</p><p>Losing myself in the rhythm of pumping back and forth over his thick, meaty erection, I try to decide on how to next introduce the topic. I need Asa on my side in regard to getting Vivian's blood. That bitch keeps refusing me and I'm going out of my mind with need.</p><p>Pulling off the young vampire, I lean back a bit and stare up at him through my eyelashes, my hand still wrapped firmly around his hardness.</p> <p>\"How's that, baby? Do you like it?\"</p><p>His answer is a grunt and a thrust of hips toward my face.</p><p>\"I'll take that as a 'yes'.\"</p><p>Slipping his silky head between my lips, I resume my attentions. The presence of vampire blood below the surface of his skin carries a rich undertone of power. Rare in one so newly made. Instinct and desire cause my canines to lengthen, and on a backward motion I nick the side of his cock.</p><p>A groan sounding like half-pleasure, half-pain reaches my ears as the scent of copper pennies fills the air. Not one to waste, I push down on his prick, covering the small cut so every drop can trickle into my mouth. Increasing my suction grants me a taste of pre-cum mixed with his delicious, potent blood.</p> <p>I can taste her! She is in the very blood rushing through his veins. The desire to have more of her urges me on in my speed. My quickening attentions must be too much for the young man, because he pulls out of my mouth. Sitting back on my haunches, I pout up at him. I really was enjoying the blood.</p><p>\"Too close,\" Asa whispers.</p><p>He pulls me up and into his arms, angling me for a kiss. The touch of his lips feels soft and enticing. Semi-warm hands run down my back and fumble for my bra release. Reaching back to help, I pull the fabric forward, allowing my breasts to spill free.</p><p>\"Nice,\" he coos as his hands grasp my newly-revealed skin.</p><p>\"Why don't you suck on one and give it a bite as well?\"</p><p>\"You mean to feed?\"</p> <p>My slim thong is already soaked from giving him attention; if he has enough sense to... ahhh... his finger pushes aside the fabric and delves into my wet folds.</p><p>\"Yes... like that.\"</p><p>Asa bends down, tentatively taking one pert nipple into his mouth. With a twist of his mouth, a sharp fang breaks the skin. The slight puncture barely stings. Pressure and warmth increase as his mouth works to pull blood from the wound.</p><p>One hard digit pumps deep inside me, while another strokes my already-aroused nub. The wound on my breast heals all too quickly and I want to go over while he pulls blood from me.</p><p>\"Bite me again... please,\" I choke out between ragged breaths.</p><p>This time, I feel two nicks, one on either side of my nipple. I grab the back of Asa's head, thrusting my whole body toward him. His free arm whips up to support my back as I arch over backward, pulling his muscular frame with me.</p><p>His hot mouth locks on, sucking and swallowing, while his busy fingers drive me ruthlessly to a peak. Warmth cascades through me and my skin prickles as the subtle shudders of release overcome me.</p><p>Not too shabby for a young guy. He may have potential.</p> <p>The cuts heal and I straighten up, drawing his head away.</p><p>\"Not bad. But I want more.\" I smile and kiss his mouth, tugging his bottom lip out for a little nibble. Hands reach up to cradle my face, gently caressing my cheeks.</p><p>\"You got it.\"</p><p>No sooner do I have a chance to piece together what he means than I bounce up onto the desk and my thong rips away. Pale, strong hands push my thighs apart and his eager, seeking lips latch onto my wetness.</p><p>A pointed firmness circles my clit, pushing me back up again with the promise of a higher ride.</p><p>\"Have you ever done this with Vivian?\"</p><p>Good God, did that just come out of my mouth? Even now, I can't get her out of my head.</p><p>Asa hesitates in his ministrations, peering up at me, raising one eyebrow.</p><p>\"Um... no. Vivian is mated to Rafe. I think he'd try to kill me.\" His face scrunches up as he thinks more on my question. \"And she scares me.\"</p><p>\"Sorry, I don't know what came over me.\" Understatement of the year. Why don't you just admit that you crave her with every cell of your body, even though you never had true lesbian tendencies before you fed from her?</p><p>Stupid! Stupid!</p><p>It's like the one small taste from the drop on Asa's cock has got me all riled up again. I can't get the feel of her power out of my mind. I want it. I want to have it, and her, every damn day for the rest of my undead life.</p><p>And Asa will help me.</p><p>\"She's pretty,\" I say, \"don't you think?\"</p><p>\"Yeah, like a tiger.\" He kisses the inside of my thigh. \"Let's get back on track here, okay?\"</p><p>With that, he slides two fingers deep into my pussy. The slick sensations and his pumping motion drive thoughts of Vivian from my mind. Soft, butterfly kisses creep slowly higher on my leg until Asa perches over my femoral artery.</p><p>\"How about right here, baby?\" The warmth from his breath tickles my leg. \"I bet I can get quite a bit right here...\" His tongue traces the crease where my thigh meets my torso.</p><p>Asa's fingers tease and tantalize, pushing me closer to my second peak.</p><p>\"Yes. Do it!\"</p><p>Searing pain grips me as he bites voraciously into my skin. Wetness trickles down my inner thigh, as a sloppy, sucking noise greets my ears. The pain once again tangles with the pleasure and the flow of my blood into Asa's mouth sends me racing toward a second crest.</p><p>I throw my head back and shout my release to the room. The soundproof walls swallow the noise.</p><p>Gasping, I sag against the desk. \"Whew, that one was much better. For a young guy, you're definitely good.\"</p><p>Asa looks up at me with the seductive promise of more in his eyes. He stands, showing me once again his hairless and well-muscled chest. God, he looks good enough to eat. Pushing his pants down his slim hips, he reveals more muscles and a full view of his long, thick, lightly haired member. I bet he shaves. Then again, that means less hair to get stuck in my teeth, so I have to admit it's smart. He takes himself in his hand and steps closer to my position on the desk.</p><p>\"How about we try for number three? And this time you bite me.\"</p><p>The thought of sinking my own sharp fangs into the corded strength of his neck makes me shudder. I nod my assent and sit up a bit, watching as he places a palm on the desk next to my hip. He guides his cock into my opening, which causes a soft sigh to escape his lips as he slides deep into me on the first stroke.</p><p>My legs snake around his hips, locking him loosely in place. Strong arms reach around to support my back, bringing that gorgeous chest forward to rub against my aroused nipples. Male musk, clean sweat and another, more subtle scent reach me through the haze of sensations.</p><p>\"You smell so good...\" I murmur against his supple skin.</p><p>Something, something... just out of reach...</p><p>Running my tongue along his collarbone, I work my way up his neck while he pumps smoothly in and out of me. The firm planes of his hips feel amazing between my clasped thighs.</p><p>Tilting my head along his neck, I open a small gash with one tooth. The slight pain, paired with the anticipation of what comes next, causes Asa to pump a little deeper and a little faster.</p><p>Rich, sweet blood spills slowly onto my waiting tongue. Memories rush forward to claim me. I'm transported back to two months ago when I locked onto Vivian's wrist in the dining room.</p><p>Her power poured into me in one brief, delirious moment and I saw everything. All of life became clear. Somehow I was as strong as her-I want that again.</p><p>The small wound heals easily and I'm left licking every trace of Asa's blood from his skin.</p><p>\"You... you taste like her.\" My voice sounds like I'm in a tunnel, even to my own ears.</p><p>Asa pauses in his movements. He leans back slightly to peer into my eyes, looking like he's trying to focus on what I've said.</p><p>\"What?\"</p><p>\"You taste like Vivian.\" Even as I say the words I know I want more. No way was that my last taste of Asa tonight.</p><p>I pull him close, nuzzling his neck again, searching for a good place to latch on. Using my feet, I nudge his ass to remind him of what he needs to be doing, driving me to my next orgasm.</p><p>\"Oh,\" he whispers in my ear. \"I fed from her last night. To prepare for the hunt.\"</p><p>An insane pain rips through my chest. She chose to feed him and not me! I've been all but begging that bitch and she keeps putting me off!</p><p>I'll get what I can from her favorite if that's the way it must be.</p><p>This time, I'm ruthless as I bite down with both fangs. Blood rushes in to coat my mouth and I greedily gulp it down as more pours in.</p><p>Vivian! I have her here in the blood of this young vampire. Her power will be mine again, if I have to drain this fool to get it.</p><p>\"God! Yes!\" Asa cries out as his hips piston faster and faster against me.</p><p>Images of her beauty and our time together cascade in a flurry with each pull on his neck. She and I were so close once and now she acts like I'm nothing. I want to bask in the warmth of her approval and love again.</p><p>I pull deep on the wound and swallow-my rhythm soon matches one pull for every two strokes from Asa.</p><p>\"Let go, Joanna, that's enough.\"</p><p>I have no intention of letting go. He tastes too good. I bite again to reopen the wound and Asa tries to shrug me off.</p><p>\"I said that's enough.\"</p><p>The pumping has slowed down-both the blood into my mouth and his hips against my body. Strong hands come up to pry my jaws off the wound and slam me down on to the desk.</p><p>\"What the fuck is wrong with you?\"</p><p>\"I want more! I need more! Give it to me!\"</p><p>A red haze fills my mind and all I can think of is getting more of that delicious blood back into me. I reach up to wrap my arms around him again, but only grasp air as he ducks away.</p><p>My hips are grabbed roughly and I'm twisted face down on the desk. Once my feet hit the ground, I thrash to get away, pushing back onto his thick, meaty cock. Raking my fingers against the desk, I'm consumed by the overwhelming need to bite him again.</p><p>\"More!\"</p><p>\"You got it, honey.\"</p><p>Mistaking my demand, he pushes back into me. An arm reaches under me and pressure tickles my engorged clit. The blood I've consumed has every nerve ending on high alert, and fast and furious, I'm pushed for that last peak while Asa spurts deep inside me.</p><p>I scream out my largest release yet at the top of my lungs.</p><p>\"Ahh!!!\"</p><p>\"That's it, baby.\" Asa coos softly while still pumping slowly. \"I knew you had one more in you.\"</p><p>Despite my release, I'm filled with a burning heat of rage. I want more blood. I have to have it.</p><p>I buck out with my hips and push him away. Asa takes another step back and I twist to stand up and face him. He looks at me with confusion in his eyes while reaching to pull his pants up.</p><p>\"What's come over you, Joanna?\"</p><p>\"Let's say I know exactly what I want and you're going to give it to me.\"</p><p>Without giving him a chance to see what's coming, I launch myself at him. Pinning him to the concrete wall is only a taste of what I can do to him. He might be bigger, but I'm older.</p><p>\"I want Vivian's blood.\" His face pales at my declaration. \"You're going to help me get it.\"</p><p>\"Look,\" his voice comes out, soothing and low, \"you need to slow down and take a deep breath, hon.\"</p><p>\"Don't patronize me!\" I thump him hard against the concrete wall to punctuate my statement. \"She's keeping her power from me and I won't have it!\"</p><p>I let him go, turning to pace back to the desk.</p><p>\"If I have to drain her when she rests, then I will!\"</p><p>\"That's crazy talk, Joanna. Listen to yourself.\"</p><p>\"I'm not crazy!\" And I'm not. I'm hungry. I want her blood flowing through my veins again. I want that sheer raw power to be all mine.</p><p>\"There's a gaping hole in me. Don't you understand?\"</p><p>The look of confusion on his face means he doesn't. Maybe I need to try a different tack.</p><p>\"You're young, right?\" Asa nods. \"You've never tasted anything as strong as Vivian's blood, have you?\" He nods again.</p><p>Good, this is working.</p><p>\"Think of it - if we could somehow trap Vivian when she least expects it and drain her, we'd grow stronger.\" I start to pace in my desire to get the words out quickly. \"We could become our own masters. We'd be like Vivian, all-powerful.\"</p><p>I turn to look at Asa to see what impact my words are having on him. He looks pensive. Good. He gets it; he really gets it.</p><p>\"And you think draining Vivian is the answer?\" His voice sounds calm.</p><p>\"If we didn't drain her completely-but held her captive we could feed from her for years until we no longer needed her... Hey! What are you doing with that g-?\" </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Drew</p><p>A muffled pop sounds as I head down the stairs into the basement to check in with Asa. Racing to the old hammer above the worktable, I grab the antique and tilt it away from the peg-board to trip the sliding wall in the corner. The wall doesn't move.</p><p>Another pop sounds.</p><p>What the hell?</p> <p>Walking over to the hidden door in the corner, I bang on the concrete.</p><p>\"Hey? You in there? What's going on?\"</p><p>A minute goes by and the panel finally slides open. Asa stands shirtless, holding a long knife dripping blood. The smell of vampire blood and cordite hits me in the face like a stumbling drunk hitting the floor-hard and fast.</p><p>I push past him into the room and see what's left of Joanna sprawled next to the opening. Her naked body lies against the concrete with a huge hole in her chest with her partially-destroyed head lying a foot away.</p><p>\"Holy fucking shit, man! What the hell did you do?\"</p> <p>\"I can explain.\"</p><p>\"Explain? Are you out of your ever-loving mind? Vivian's going to kill you!\"</p><p>\"Joanna tried to get me to help her drain Vivian.\"</p><p>Whoa. Never expected that. It certainly puts a new spin on things.</p><p>\"Huh. You don't say?\" I venture into the room a bit. \"And why is she naked?\"</p><p>Asa has the grace to look uncomfortable at my question. \"Well... she, um... came down here and we had some fun...\" He looks off in the distance and runs a hand over his clean-shaven head.</p> <p>\"Yeah, I'm listening... keep going.\"</p><p>\"She flipped out, man. That's all I can say. I'm not sure when it happened-somewhere near the end I think.\"</p><p>I must look incredulous; he rushes on to explain without any verbal encouragement from me.</p><p>\"First, she tried to drink me dry-I swear. She was talking about Vivian a lot and wanting her blood. And then she started yammering about how powerful we could be if we figured out a way to trap Vivian and drain her slowly.\"</p><p>A snort sounds from me before I can contain it. \"Trap Vivian? Yeah, right.\" I shake my head at the ridiculous thought. \"And come out alive? She must have been insane.\"</p><p>\"It was the craziest thing I've ever seen. I mean, she's been acting freaky toward Vivian for a while. But plotting to drain her? I had no choice.\"</p><p>My look speaks volumes-and I'm sure he can see it. What a dumb ass. Vivian will be pissed.</p><p>\"Seriously, dude,\" he continues to ramble. \"I had to protect the seethe. It was the right thing to do.\"</p> <p>\"You trying to convince yourself or me?\" I shake my head and walk away, back into the basement workroom, through the concealed opening. \"You should have told Vivian. That's what you should have done. You're fucked.\"</p><p>\"Wait!\" Asa's panicked voice reaches me. \"Can you help me clean this up?\"</p><p>My laugh rings out as I take the stairs three at a time. \"No fucking way. This mess is all yours, boy.\"</p><p>I slam the basement door behind me, putting as much distance between myself and that train wreck as possible. There are times I wish I could be a fly on the wall. To listen in and see how things really work when I'm not there.</p><p>This is one time when I can honestly say that's not how I feel. Vivian's going to flip out; I wish to even in the state of Alaska when the shit hits the fan on this one.</p><p>I grab the cell clipped to my waist and call in my intentions to the command center. Which is much safer than heading back and actually having to talk to Asa in that bloody room.</p><p>\"Drew to command center. No need to pick up,\" I add, hoping he's busy with clean up and will listen to me rather than responding. \"I'm heading over to the lobby to check in on the new werewolf arrivals. We've got less than two hours left until the hunters are released.\"</p><p>\"Roger,\" comes Asa's short reply.</p><p>Would I have acted as Asa did, had I been in his shoes? It's convenient for me to play Monday-morning quarterback and say he should have called Vivian, but would I have? I guess it would have to be pretty damn serious for me to pull the trigger. Patting the side holster carrying the Colt 45 I'm wearing for the hunt, I can't help but wonder if I would have even reached for it. Guns, and using them, don't come second-nature to me.</p><p>The sounds from the lobby greet me before I can clear the dining room-loud, raucous hellos and shouts of welcome. The first thing I see is a smiling Vivian, as a short man with a powerful build spins her around.</p><p>\"Romeo! Put me down, you old devil!\"</p><p>He does as she asks and a tiny, athletic woman with short hair swats him playfully on the arm. \"Careful, dear, no need to rile Jon up right when you walk in the door.\"</p><p>When I look over at the younger werewolf, I can see hints of strain around his eyes.</p><p>\"He knows I mean no harm, Elsa. Don't you, boy?\"</p><p>\"Yes, sir,\" comes Jonathan's smooth reply. \"But don't do it again or I might return the favor,\" he adds with a lecherous grin toward Elsa, his old female alpha.</p><p>The moment breaks when more of Jon's old pack comes barreling through the doors, like a bunch of kids playing in the first snow of the year. The fluffy white stuff is shaken off parkas and knocked out of hair, as handfuls of ice are dropped down shirtfronts.</p><p>\"Children!\" Elsa's voice carries out over the four roughhousing werewolves. \"We're here to hunt a vampire, not frolic in the snow drifts.\"</p><p>The good nature prevails, despite the admonishment, and the pack members all clamor in to shake hands with Vivian and Rafe before heading over to the front desk to check in.</p><p>\"Drew,\" Vivian nods in my direction, \"will bring you all to the theater, where you can catch the scent of Emiko. She was released onto the property about an hour ago.\"</p><p>As I walk over to escort the group, Jon catches my arm. \"The loner wolf, Melvyn, hasn't checked in yet. His flight landed around the same time, but he hung back at the hangar to avoid coming in with the pack. I'll wait for him and bring him by after this group leaves, okay?\"</p><p>\"Sounds good. Sure you don't want to switch with me so you can spend time with your old pack?\"</p><p>Jon's smile doesn't reach his eyes when he answers, \"I've had my fill for now, but thanks.\"</p><p>I head over to the two alphas, bowing over Elsa's hand while introducing myself. \"Charmed. Please follow me to the last place Emiko was in our custody.\"</p><p>The pack trails after me as I head down the hall.</p><p>\"Have you been informed of all the pertinent information about the criminal?\" I enquire to the two alphas.</p><p>\"Yes,\" Romeo answers, \"Jon met us at the hangar and drove up in the van to brief us.\"</p><p>\"Vivian looks as lovely as ever-doesn't she, dear?\" Elsa asks him.</p><p>Before he can answer, a soft female voice from the back snarkily whispers, \"Bitch should keep her fangs off Jonathan.\"</p><p>I swing open the double doors to the theater and pause for a moment. Not sure if I should respond to this insult to my master or ignore it, I hear a male voice whisper back in a sing-song tone, \"Still jealous, Lor-lor?\"</p><p>Motioning with one arm for the pack to move inside, I stand aside and watch the group filter in. One beautiful young woman with long, brown hair glares at me with hate burning in her pretty green eyes. \"Can't wait to get me some vampire meat.\" Her voice matches that of the woman referred to as Lor-Lor.</p><p>I meet her stare with one of my own, letting my true nature come close to the surface. My civil mask slips a bit, \"Anytime you want to tango, puppy, give me a call.\"</p><p>A growl starts to bubble deep in her throat as one of her pack-mates, a young man with a tight end's build, pulls her in with a none-too-gentle jerk of her long hair.</p><p>\"Enough, Lori. He's not the vamp we're here to hunt. We're his guests.\"</p><p>\"Hmmph.\" Her brattish response flows up to me from the sloping path down into the media room.</p><p>These younger wolves do act like children; I'm not surprised Jon didn't want to continue his time with them. It must have been hard for him to bear any comments about his master. Not a weak man by nature, he's been instructed, as we all have, to make sure we offer no blatant insults to any of the hunters this week.</p><p>Polite-host mask firmly back in place, I step deeper into the large room and close the doors behind me.</p><p>\"Drew?\" Romeo calls out, \"Where can we find the best trail?\"</p><p>\"The scent of Emiko is unmistakable in the front left corner of the room. She was surrounded by three male vampires, but you should be able to discern her easily.\" I maintain my position near the door. \"Rafe escorted her to the exit door on the right, where she was released onto the property.\"</p><p>The wolves crowd around the area I've indicated and sniff like, well... like a pack of dogs. Very unseemly, the poor buggers.</p><p>\"We'll need to come back here in wolf form to start the hunt.\" Romeo calls out.</p><p>\"Yes, that's fine.\" I answer. \"You won't need to enter the building but can pick up her trail from the hot tub grotto outside. It's where all of the hunters will start from.\"</p><p>Romeo nods, motioning for the pack to come back up the aisle. \"We'll head to our cabins now and get ready for the hunt.\"</p><p>He wisely does not attempt to leave by the emergency exit door. Having all his wolves walk through it would dull the scent of their prey. I lead them back out to the hall, taking a left to bring them to an exit at the end of the wing.</p><p>\"There is a lighted asphalt path outside that winds around to the cabins. Your bags should be inside waiting for you when you arrive. Please call the front desk if you need anything.\"</p><p>I hang a polite, innocuous smile on my face as I usher the pack out the door. The one named Lori can't seem to stop shooting daggers at me with her eyes as she leaves. That one is a true bitch, no doubt about it.</p><p>My smile becomes genuine as I glance after their departing forms into the darkness. Nice to be able to say the word \"bitch\" and mean it literally.</p><p>Closing the door, I turn and head back down the way I came. I grab the phone secured at my waist and call Jonathan.</p><p>\"The pack is out. You can bring Melvyn down now.\"</p><p>\"Thanks. Will do when we arrive.\"</p><p>Noting there's under an hour until the start of the hunt, I head over to the dining room. Most all of the vampire hunters are gathered, looking eager to get out into the cold. Fools. Two months up here has certainly taught me to never underestimate the damage the cold can do to one of our kind.</p><p>Paul hands out last-minute pots of blood coffee to each table. By the smell, I'd say they are heavier on the blood than the caffeine.</p><p>Vivian and Rafe work the crowd, as only they can. I don't have the patience yet for the constant politeness, but I've found if I hang back in a corner, I can jump in when I'm needed. The sounds drifting to me from the lobby indicate Jonathan and Melvyn, the new wolf, have arrived and are at the front desk.</p><p>Everything seems to be going according to Viv's carefully constructed plan. How she managed to pull this off is anyone's guess. The why I understand only a little more clearly. She and Rafe may have come clean two months ago about a possible threat within the Tribunal against Vivian, but any other details not associated to Ivan's original crimes eight years ago were left out.</p><p>That woman has a lot of history and I find it fascinating to see things unfold around her. I haven't had this much fun in years. My life has been dark since Angie's death. The chance to kill her murderer was a gift from Vivian; one I'll always be grateful for. At the time, not so much, but now, yes. It gave me a closure I hadn't known I needed.</p><p>Vivian slowly works her way over to my spot by the entrance to the lobby.</p><p>\"Would you please start the rounds on the property?\" I nod, ready to take my leave. \"Asa's on duty in the command center for another nine hours or so, right?\" She's looking right at me. Crap.</p><p>\"Yeah, I think so.\" My eyes dart away before I can stop them. Oh, I so don't want to talk about Asa right now. Or the command center. Run away! \"I'll head out now.\"</p><p>As she nods her gratitude, I push off the wall and head for the east wing, intending to leave through the exit in the poolroom. Jon and the loner wolf are just finishing up, when I wave them down.</p><p>\"Hey, Melvyn, right?\" I offer my hand to the scruffy man in a beat-up bomber jacket. \"I'm Drew, one of the organizers for the hunt.\"</p><p>\"Good ta meetcha, mate.\" This new werewolf's rough cockney accent brings me back to the streets of London I left behind over a hundred years ago. It took me years to lose my own distinct speech patterns and blend in more fully here in the States.</p><p>I drop his hand. \"Has Jon told you the news about a possible wolf to run with on the hunt?\"</p><p>\"Yea, on the ride up, 'e has. Not a real one, though, eh?\"</p><p>\"Better than by yourself,\" Jon quips with a roll of his eyes my way.</p><p>The shaggy-haired, older Were shrugs. \"If you say so, mate.\"</p><p>I say my goodbyes as they head into the north wing to get Emiko's scent. Continuing on to my original destination, I stride across the lobby. My heavy coat hangs in the pool area where it's a constant eighty-five degrees. The double doors open at my touch and the humidity of the space rushes out to greet me.</p><p>The exotic smell of green palms, healthy plants, and tropical flowers things makes this one of the guest's favorite spots. The lighting and island music give the whole glassed-in, two-story-high room in this wing the feeling of being transported to another world.</p><p>\"Brrackkk! Watch out! Drew's got a sword!\"</p><p>Mikey, one of the green parrots who call this room home, screeches from his perch in a tall palm wrapped with Christmas lights. I smile in response to what has become his usual greeting. The first time he saw me here at the pool was when I chopped off the head of my wife's killer, so the greeting is accurate.</p><p>\"Hey, Mikey. No sword today. No fruit either. I'll bring you some later.\"</p><p>\"Grapes! Don't forget. Grapes. Braaacck!\"</p><p>The area surrounding the emergency exit door has been set up as a makeshift receiving area for the hunters coming in from the cold. Coat racks, a table with coffee urns and mugs, hand and foot warmers ready for wear litter the tightly-organized space. After being out in the Arctic temps for a long period of time, the pool water is a great spot to bring a vampire's body temp up to at least eighty-two. The connected spa, set at a hundred-and-one, does the rest.</p><p>Grabbing my heavy, sub-zero parka from a rack, I bundle up and head out into the biting cold. The phone in my coat goes off and I fumble for it through all my layers. \"Drew here. Go ahead.\"</p><p>\"Spotted some activity in the greenhouse. Go check it out, we've got an employee on duty there.\"</p><p>\"Roger.\" I resist the urge to ask Asa how things are going in the basement room with Joanna's corpse. If I stay out of it, I'll have plausible deniability when Vivian finds out.</p><p>I pick up my pace as the wind howls in my ears. In a minute, the greenhouse looms into view. Because we don't get any direct sunlight in the winter, the entire outside is covered in a thick, seasonal insulation. It looks like a long, puffy semi-circle shape looming above the snow.</p><p>The heavy door opens with a swipe of my key card and I step into the lush combination of fertile soil and ripening vegetation. The artificial UV lights cause my eyes to squint after my short trek through the darkness.</p><p>Something feels off in the energy of the room. As the door closes behind me I take a deep breath in to scent the air for anything odd.</p><p>There.</p><p>Just a hint...</p><p>A whisper of blood in the air.</p><p>A scraping sound ahead and to the left indicates the direction I need to investigate first. Opening the door certainly announced my presence to whomever is in the room, so I don't believe stealth will work.</p><p>\"Hello?\" I call out. On a hunch I continue, \"Emiko, is that you?\"</p><p>A petite figure dressed all in black steps out into the center aisle, not twenty feet from me. Her long hair is tied back and a black mask covers most of her face.</p><p>\"The hunt has not begun yet,\" she answers. \"You're one of Vivian's seethe, aren't you?\"</p><p>\"Yes, I am. What are you doing in here?\"</p><p>\"Topping off with a full stomach,\" she says, motioning her head back the way she'd come. \"Before the race begins in earnest. Don't worry; I didn't take too much from the gardener. She'll be fine.\"</p><p>I nod, not sure what I should say or ask of the rogue standing before me.</p><p>\"The charges against me are false you know.\"</p><p>\"Excuse me?\" I certainly didn't expect to hear that.</p><p>\"Do I look like I've survived this long, to do something as stupid as draining five government officials in the very city the Tribunal of Ancients calls home?\"</p><p>\"Umm...\"</p><p>\"I think this is all about Vivian. Or as Coraline calls her, 'Alexandria the Great'.\"</p><p>She's piqued my interest now, I'm sure she knows it, but I'll be damned if I show it.</p><p>\"Ever wonder about your new master and her mysterious background?\" She lifts her mask, pushing it to her forehead, and gives me a small, sardonic smile. \"The enforcers still talk about her kill record. Even four hundred years later.</p><p>\"Did you know she never lost a single one? Not one! Never had to have back-up called in, and never required a partner-no matter how crazy the other vampire was.\"</p><p>I wasn't aware of the details, but I had heard some things about Vivian's time as an enforcer. Like that she was one a long time ago. Okay, maybe that's about all I've heard.</p><p>\"She pissed-off a lot of the Inner Circle, including Coraline, spouting her opinions on the hypocrisy within the Tribunal.\" Emiko moves down the aisle toward me, her measured steps slow and careful. \"Even having served only five years, I easily saw what she meant. Yet, the eleven Ancients always keep silent on the matter of 'Alexandria the Great'. I've often wondered why.\"</p><p>\"Can't help you there. Loyalty to Vivian and all.\" I smile a lopsided grin at her. Does she really think I'm going fall for this? Not that I have any information to share, but still, she's got some gall.</p><p>\"How did she kill her marks so easily? What weapons did she favor? Who trained her to kill so efficiently?\" Her voice trails off as she stares into the lush vegetation surrounding us. \"These questions, and more, have been pondered by every enforcer that has come after her for centuries.\"</p><p>Since I don't have any answers to those questions, I can see I won't learn anything more from her on Vivian. \"Why should I believe you didn't drain those officials?\" I switch topics, hopefully, to entice different information from her.</p><p>Her soft laugh tinkles softly in the humid air. A black blur of motion follows the sound. My head is wrenched painfully to the side, and a loud sickening crack follows me to the floor.</p><p>I land on the hard concrete, in a daze as the agonizing pain subsides.</p><p>Bitch broke my neck!</p><p>Reaching up, I carefully twist my head back to the front and lie still for the bones to re-knit.</p><p>\"Because I've never done anything that stupid in my whole, long life,\" Emiko whispers close to my ear.</p><p>In the next instant, she's past me and at the door.</p><p>\"Don't get up. I'll see myself out.\" The door whooshes shut behind her.</p><p>Christ! Don't think I'll be sharing this last bit with the others any time soon. Man, that bitch is fast. Wonder to what I owe that parting gift. Afraid I'd try and stop her for the hunters?</p><p>In a minute or so, my body heals and I push myself off the floor. A soft mewling sound reaches my ears from deeper in the greenhouse. As I head toward it, the rasp of fabric on concrete pinpoints exactly where the gardener lies.</p><p>Rounding a corner, I spot Helena struggling to sit up. She's holding a hand to her head and has a glazed look in her eyes.</p><p>\"Drew, honey, would you help me up?\"</p><p>I reach down and assist the forty-something woman to her feet. \"What happened, Helena?\"</p><p>\"Oh, I slipped and fell off that damn thing,\" she says, motioning to the black rubber, non-slip stool.</p><p>Uh-huh. Safe to say Emiko covered her tracks here well.</p><p>\"Want me to call Dr. Cook for you?\" Our resident physician doesn't have normal hours, because she's on call 24/7. The good news is she isn't needed too often.</p><p>Helena tests her weight on both ankles, appearing to do an overall mental check of her body. \"Nah, I feel fine. Just a little tired.\"</p><p>\"You're working later than the curfew dictates,\" I gently remind her. \"And today is the first day. Why don't you head on home and call it a night?\"</p><p>\"Good thinking. I could have sworn I was cleaning up a bit ago to head out on time. Don't know what's come over me.\"</p><p>I help her close up the greenhouse and put away her last remaining items. The job takes a little while and by the time we're done, I realize the hunters have already been let loose. Looks like Emiko got out with some time to spare.</p><p>Helena waits by the door for Greg, one of the grounds-keeping crew, to come pick her up. The walk back to the employee apartments is only feasible in the summer during the off-season. The building is a couple of miles away, tucked onto the northwest corner of the property, and she'd never make it back in this cold.</p><p>\"I'll report your fall to Vivian so your bonus isn't at stake, okay?\"</p><p>\"You're a gem, Drew, thanks.\"</p><p>I wait with her about twenty minutes until her ride shows up. Before I can step back into the frigid darkness and decide where to go next, my phone buzzes again.</p><p>It's Asa.</p><p>\"Some info has come in from Cy on Emiko. Turns out the hot, little Asian chick was trained as a female ninja over two hundred and fifty years ago.\"</p><p>Huh, that explains the broken neck move.</p><p>\"They're called kunoichi,\" I tell him.</p><p>\"Yeah, that's what the report says. How'd you know that?\"</p><p>\"I've been around, grasshopper.\" A grunt reaches me on the end of the line. \"Were you on deck when the hunters scattered?\"</p><p>\"Nope. They left about thirty minutes ago and I was, er... um... still busy.\"</p><p>I'm sure that answers things about Joanna in a roundabout way, but I'm not touching that pile with a ten-foot pole.</p><p>\"Oh wait, hold on, dude. I got a call coming in from cabin two's landline.\"</p><p>Asa must have kept the channel open on speaker function while he hit the speakerphone button on the landline because Paul's frantic voice fills the airwaves next.</p><p>\"Asa! I need help! There's blood everywhere. And this guy's dead!\" </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Paul</p><p>\"Calm down, man. Tell me what you did,\" comes Asa's gruff reply.</p><p>\"I didn't do anything, you arrogant grunt! I smelled blood and followed it to this cabin.\" My hand shakes as I grip the phone. \"Someone came in and tore this guy to shreds.\"</p><p>\"Go stand outside, Paul.\" Asa's calm voice feels like a kick in the teeth; knocking away what little control I have, like mice scurrying from a light. \"Get away from the scene for now and I'll send everyone available to you.\"</p> <p>It's as if he thinks I'm too stupid to handle myself in the cabin and he's afraid I'll mess it up somehow. Competent jerk. He forgets he was a newbie only a year ago.</p><p>Before he hangs up on me I hear, \"Drew, did you catch that? He's out at...\"</p><p>The dial tone sounds in my ear and I stare at the receiver another moment in silence. Absolute quiet, punctuated by the irresistible and overpowering scent of fresh werewolf blood, washes over me. Who would have thought it could smell so much better than regular human blood? The desire to get down on my knees next to the mangled body and lick what I can makes me think Asa had a good idea-maybe I will go stand outside for a bit.</p><p>I'm still in my parka, having done no more than enter the cabin, take in the destruction, and stagger to the phone to call Asa. When I open the door the sub-zero temp smacks me in the face, like it does every time. A harsh reminder that even though I can take more abuse from the cold, I can still feel it and suffer its effects. The urge to go back inside to taste the blood splatter on the walls, or pick up the drained corpse and check for leavings, racks my body like a hard shiver of frost creeping up my spine.</p><p>Not to be able to rein in these desires leaves me scared and slightly lost. Things are so much clearer when Vivian stands near me. How much longer until I have Asa's control? When will I get to go home to my family? Not seeing them on a daily basis, after work or before we start our day, takes its toll. The kids are getting bigger and missing Christmas with them sucked.</p> <p>Thinking of them distracts me from the dead werewolf inside the cabin. He's not an employee, but a hunter, so technically Emiko didn't break any rules by killing him. I hadn't expected her to act so fast, or be so harsh.</p><p>The faint sound of feet hitting asphalt gradually becomes stronger and Drew's distinct orange coat comes into view.</p><p>\"How you holding up, Paul?\" he asks.</p><p>\"Not bad. I've got it together.\" Barely, but he doesn't need to know that.</p><p>\"What happened in there?\"</p><p>\"I'm not sure. Viv asked me come to check on the loner wolf, Melvyn, to let him know Jet was out scouting ahead and would meet up with him in thirty minutes.\" I gulp at the thought of the remembered blood on the pathway. \"When I rounded the last bend in the path,\" motioning with my arm toward the main building and the hot tub grotto, \"I smelled a trace of blood-and followed it here.\"</p> <p>\"Let's wait for the others before we go in. Asa was calling the rest of the seethe while I ran over, they should be here soon.\"</p><p>The silence between us doesn't last long. I'm dying to slake my curiosity somehow. \"Drew?\"</p><p>\"Yup?\"</p><p>\"You ever drink werewolf blood?\"</p><p>Drew's head whips around from where he was staring at the dimly-lit path. \"Umm... yeah. Why?\"</p><p>\"Just wondering what it's like.\"</p><p>\"Considering Jonathan is the only one that lives here you won't have a chance to find out any time soon, that's for damn sure.\" He looks pensive for a moment, like he's deciding on how much to say. \"What was something you really enjoyed eating as a human?\"</p><p>Interesting question when posed to a new vampire who made his living as a professional chef for over a decade, with the belly to prove it. I pat my slimming middle-the liquid diet is working wonders-and respond, \"I'm not sure if I could narrow that down to ten items without some serious contemplation. Why?\"</p> <p>\"Vampires find werewolf blood delicious. For me, it was as if the lifeblood running through their veins was more alive. More meaty-for lack of a better descriptor. Reminded me of a good steak, at times it was damn hard to resist going back for seconds.\"</p><p>I think about his words and wonder what it would taste like for me. My canines start to elongate, pushing painfully through my gums. The sensation still unnerves and embarrasses me, like I'm a high school kid walking around with a boner.</p><p>\"You do know a lot of vampires become addicted to Were-blood, right?\"</p><p>That puts a new spin on things. \"No. I hadn't known. Really?\"</p><p>\"Oh yeah. The power goes to their heads and the taste keeps them craving more and more. Best you avoid tasting it 'til you're older.\"</p><p>Vivian and Rafe round the bend on the same pathway where I smelled the blood. Jonathan lopes a step or two behind the couple.</p><p>\"Where's Joanna?\" Vivian calls out.</p><p>Drew becomes a little stiff, but answers quickly enough. \"I haven't seen her in a while. Do you want to wait?\"</p><p>\"No, we'll fill her in later. Thanks for not going in yet. Everyone stay by the door upon entry and let Jonathan see if he can identify the killer by scent.\"</p><p>We all filter inside, following Vivian's instructions. This cabin looks like all the others and has a large, open living area. The kill occurred in the connected bedroom, so we have plenty of room.</p><p>\"It was one of the vampires in the theater, that's for sure.\" Jon doesn't even need to go into the bedroom to announce his findings. Damn, he's good. \"I wasn't at the meet and greet in the lobby, so I don't know which one.\"</p><p>\"Are you implying it could be someone else and not Emiko?\" Rafe asks.</p><p>Drew trailed over to peer in the bedroom doorway and interjects before the werewolf can answer, \"Cy reported to Asa that Emiko was trained as a ninja.\"</p><p>\"Really?\" Vivian raises an eyebrow. \"I haven't spoken with Asa since the hunter's arrival in the lobby. Nice to know Cy got some info on her quickly.\"</p><p>Vivian also walks to the bedroom, but doesn't stop at the doorway; she heads straight in. My urges are back and I don't want to embarrass myself. I think I'll stay here by the front door.</p><p>\"Good God,\" she says. \"What a mess. I wouldn't have expected this from an older vampire.\"</p><p>I know what they are seeing, I close my eyes to help prevent the images from spilling back in, but it doesn't help. The cold, lifeless form of the once vital werewolf, his neck broken and head at an unnatural angle... his throat ripped open in Emiko's rush to get to his blood. The arterial spray splashed against the headboard and the wall. Her obvious displeasure when the blood ran out - she threw the drained body into the closet door.</p><p>Once again, my teeth push down and my slow heartbeat kicks up a few notches. What would the blood taste like for me? Would I get to enjoy my Bolognese sauce again? Would it remind me of the cheesecake Bunny made me for my last birthday? The pounding blood arouses other instincts as well and dammit, I can feel a woody starting in my pants.</p><p>\"I don't think this was Emiko,\" Drew says.</p><p>\"Why is that?\" my beautiful master asks.</p><p>Drew coughs, clearing his throat. \"I ran into Emiko at the greenhouse. She just fed from Helena. She wasn't covered in blood, as this spray suggests, and I doubt she would have hightailed it back this way, only minutes before the hunters set loose.\"</p><p>\"The blood trail started in the hot tub grotto,\" Jon adds. \"I smelled it on our way up. The killer could have headed back toward the main house.\"</p><p>\"Without knowing the exact timing, it could have happened either slightly prior to the hunters' release or just after, correct?\" Rafe asks of the room at large. At least I think he does, but I can't tell for sure because my eyes are still shut. I can still imagine all the red and the aroma wafting through the entire cabin reminds me of cooking my favorite dishes. If I take a taste, which one will it be?</p><p>The aching pit in my stomach burns with hunger. My desire roils over itself like a living beast with sharp talons-eager to claw its way to the surface to get what it craves.</p><p>\"It doesn't completely rule out Emiko,\" Vivian says. \"She could have hightailed it here before the hunt to get a power surge of Were-blood.\"</p><p>\"She seemed too smart to take such a risk so close to the start...\" Drew's voice trails off, like he wants to add more. \"And she was still at the greenhouse before the hunters' release and after. That's a lot of ground to cover quickly.\"</p><p>\"And what were you doing with Emiko that whole time?\" comes Vivian's deadly purr.</p><p>Wow, I'd hate to be in Drew's shoes right now. I pry my eyes open to focus on my seethe-mate. This little segue makes a good distraction from my powerful hunger.</p><p>He scoffs a little with a small laugh, \"She tried to tell me she wasn't guilty of the crimes they're charging her with.\"</p><p>\"Really?\" Jon says. \"And because she's a tiny, little Asian woman, you figured she's got to be telling the truth?\"</p><p>\"No. But the fact that she snapped my neck in the fastest move I've ever seen and strolled past me into the night helps to reaffirm my thoughts.\"</p><p>Whoa! Where'd that come from? Drew's face looks heated and slightly chagrined. Bet he hadn't intended to share that tid bit in front of us all.</p><p>Rafe holds up a hand to both of them, stopping what looked like a seriously smart-ass remark from Jonathan-that is, if the shit-eating grin on his face is anything to go by.</p><p>\"Let me get this straight,\" Rafe begins. \"She chatted with you calmly in the greenhouse?\" Drew nods. \"She had just fed from the gardener?\" Drew nods again. \"By the way, is Helena okay?\"</p><p>\"Yes. Emiko did not overfeed and was careful with her. She wiped only a minute or two from her mind and left no physical evidence or damage to her.\"</p><p>\"Okay, good.\" Rafe's rumbling, soothing tone rolls over me in a gentle wave and I'm proud to report my boner has finally faded. Bet that voice has brought the vicious and vivacious Vivian back from the edge a time or two. \"Now how did she get close enough to break your neck?\"</p><p>\"Well, she kind of walked up nice and slow while telling me she never would have done something so stupid, meaning the killings they said she did. Then, quick as a wink, I see a flash of black, my head is looking the wrong way, and I'm on the floor.\"</p><p>A snort flows from Jonathan.</p><p>\"Quiet,\" comes the reprimand from our feisty redhead. \"You may not have fared much better, Jon. Ninjas are incredibly well-trained and add that to the increased strength and speed of a vampire....\"</p><p>\"They weren't the most prized spies and assassins of their emperors for no reason,\" adds Rafe.</p><p>\"Now I ask you-does all of that add up to the messy kill you see in the bedroom?\" comes Drew's calm voice.</p><p>Vivian notices me huddled next to the door. Damn, I had hoped to avoid detection.</p><p>\"Paul? You feeling okay?\"</p><p>My voice croaks out a bit raspier than normal, \"I've been better.\"</p><p>Her swift stride brings the master vampire to my side before I can brace myself. A gentle touch on my cheek tilts my face down to hers.</p><p>\"When did you feed last?\"</p><p>I rack my scattered thoughts, searching for the answer. \"I don't know for certain.\"</p><p>\"Well that's a sure sign it's been too long.\" Her gorgeous green eyes lock onto mine and a moment of calm comes over me. Her voice whispers in my mind, You'll be fine, my pet. You must rest and collect yourself before you feed. Meditate and look within for strength. Wait for me and I'll help you through this.</p><p>\"Drew,\" she says in a brisk tone, \"go with Paul back to the command center and brief Asa with what we've got so far. Paul? Wait in your room for me, okay?\"</p><p>\"Yes, Vivian. I will.\" I know I've got a puppy dog look on my face. I can feel it. But it feels so much better than the raging desires from before, I don't give a shit how stupid I must look.</p><p>\"Jon and I will go inform the other wolves next door.\" My master continues, \"I know they are still in their cabins. Something about giving the vamps a chance to disperse before they set out. Maybe with luck they heard something.\"</p><p>\"Yeah, they didn't want to tempt the undead crazies while the buggers are on an adrenaline high,\" Jon adds.</p><p>\"I agree. It was a smart thing to do.\" Rafe shakes his head as we head out the door. \"It's just a shame that Melvyn didn't have the foresight to stay out of their way.\"</p><p>\"You know what this means don't you?\" Vivian points out as she and Jon head next door. \"We've got two killers loose on the property.\"</p><p>\"No dear,\" Rafe interjects gently, \"we've way more than that. Not counting Cora, her guards, Vikram or Emiko we've got seven vampires and six werewolves. We just have to narrow it down to who has killed today.\"</p><p>Drew and I head back to the main building with Rafe. As we round the bend in the path, I hear the greeting that follows Jon's knock from the wolves next door.</p><p>\"Well, if it isn't the 'mistress' and her servant.\" </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Jonathan</p><p>Lori would have to be the bitch to open the door. She never got over me leaving the pack and choosing Dria over her. Some things aren't worth explaining-you either get it, or you don't.</p><p>\"Not now, Lori. We need to talk to the pack.\"</p><p>I push past her slight form into the cabin, giving her the choice of stepping back or having me knock her over. She retreats from my path-wisely I might add. I'm not in the mood for her shit.</p> <p>Following me in, Dria doesn't spare the pretty wolf a glance. Without Vivian and me exchanging a word, I know she'll let me take the lead. She's damn smart-and we've danced this dance with wolves in the past.</p><p>The scent of barely cooked steak vies for dominance over the muskiness filling the cramped space. Six members from my old pack, half of whom I don't know, loiter in the main room of the cabin. Vivian stays by the door, her presence cocooning me with a calm surety. Romeo, Elsa and two younger males I met in the van, Eric and Pat, sit at the small table finishing up their meal. Spike, the one who keeps watching me but didn't speak much on the ride up from the airport, leans against the kitchen counter.</p><p>\"What's up, Jon?\" Romeo asks.</p><p>\"There's been a murder next door.\" The level of excitement in the room skyrockets at my announcement.</p><p>\"What?\" Elsa cries. \"Already? They caught Emiko in the cabin next door?\"</p> <p>\"Of all the shit luck,\" says Pat, earning himself a swat from Elsa.</p><p>\"No,\" I correct. \"It was the non-pack wolf. And he was drained by a vampire hunter.\"</p><p>Everyone takes a moment to digest the information and Lori slinks closer to my side. Her arousal coats the air around me, even through her tight leather pants. She always was like a dog in heat, ready to go anytime I looked her way. Can't seem to decide if she wants me or hates me. Typical, crazy werewolf-bitch.</p><p>Eric, seated next to Pat, chimes in, \"How can you be so sure it was a hunter and not the rogue vamp?\"</p><p>Good question. Surprised he voiced it before Romeo did.</p><p>\"There's no trace of Emiko in the cabin or outside of it. I recognize one of the hunters' trail from a scent in the lobby.\"</p> <p>Female sex pheromones push out into the room, flooding my senses. A light touch skims down my jacketed back. I step forward, closer to the table and out of Lori's reach.</p><p>\"That's enough, Lori,\" Elsa's tone sounds firm, allowing no room for debate. \"We need to focus on this new development, not on ripping our clothes off.\"</p><p>\"I can't stand the thought of that vampire controlling him!\" Lori screeches from behind me.</p><p>Oh shit. She would have to drag Dria into this.</p><p>One glance at the vamp in question has me relaxing my shoulders, releasing a tension I didn't know I was holding. Dria leans against the wall next to the door, examining her nails and ignoring the outburst. My heart swells with pride at the stronger woman's show of support. She knows I can handle this, and handle it I will.</p><p>I hold up a hand to my old pack leaders, Romeo rising from his seat at Lori's insult to their hostess. Turning to face the dark-haired beauty, I let my true dislike shine through my eyes.</p><p>\"You are nothing compared to her.\" A small gasp comes from young woman and her hand flies to her mouth. \"And if you keep up this show of immaturity, you will be nothing for the rest of your long life.\" Without realizing it, my blood pressure has risen and I'm feeling the first strains of anger. There is no way I will let the anger out in this group, so I lock it down tight. \"Vivian never took my will-a fact you continually delude yourself from accepting.\"</p><p>I turn to face the other five, giving her my back in a show of what I really think of her-that she is beneath me in the eyes of the pack. Spike, dressed in black, watches the exchange with interest. He gives me a nod. That is one strange dude. Smells a little funny, too. Elsa crowds near Romeo, slipping an arm around his waist. The other two, who look to be in their early twenties, remain seated at the table.</p> <p>\"I choose to be with the vampire. Does anyone else have a problem with that?\" My anger pulses off me in waves, despite my earlier control, crackling in the air.</p><p>Romeo comes forward, hands in a placating gesture. \"We never should have honored Lori's request to join us, Jon. I'm sorry for my lapse.\"</p><p>With one look, he sends the young woman bursting into tears. The desire to please the alpha is strongly ingrained; lower members of the pack will often grovel and debase themselves after angering their leader. She runs to the connecting bedroom. Eric looks to his buddy seated next to him and partially rises in his seat.</p><p>\"Let her go, man,\" his pack-mate says. \"She'll cool down on her own.\"</p><p>\"Pat's right,\" says the stinky guy in the kitchen, his voice oddly lyrical. \"You go in now and you'll just be reinforcing the bad behavior.\"</p><p>The young man nods before lowering back to his chair, a haunted look in his eyes.</p><p>Ugh, the drama of it all reminds me of why I left in the first place. I can't take this shit on a daily basis. Another glance at Dria and the anger leaves me. The desire to hold her in my arms feels almost painful. If she can rise above this pettiness then so can I. I'd rather be by her side, unable to touch her for the rest of my life, than back involved in a pack.</p><p>A smile splits my face as I reach my hand out to Romeo. \"No worries.\" He clasps my hand in his own, pumping it up and down. \"You're a strong leader. Someday Lori will find a man to be her match. It will just never be me.\"</p><p>The wolves in the room are all controlling their pheromones now and the sexual tension dissolves. Romeo and I break off our handshake and the shorter man moves to stand by his mate. \"I'm glad you're happy here, Jon. I know the pack was never good for you.\"</p><p>Romeo found me on the first full moon after I was attacked by a crazed Were in college. The days ran together after my change-they still remain dark and confusing when I try to remember them. He prevented me from doing anything rash by bringing me into his pack. When the transformation comes on you, scared and alone, it would be easy to bite someone by mistake.</p><p>\"Not true. Just not right for me.\" I glance around at the remaining wolves. \"You seem to have taken on quite a few strays since I left.\" I say the last with a smile, trying to diffuse the situation even more.</p><p>Romeo puffs with pride at the mention of the newcomers. \"Eric and Pat are fitting in nicely. They're our newest pack members.\" I'm surprised he's brought them here, but I'm sure he has a reason, one which I can't question him on in front of the others or it would appear like I was challenging his good sense. \"And Spike might be quiet most of the time, but he can hold his own in a fight pretty damn good.\"</p><p>Whatever. All I know is Spike is watching me a little too closely for my comfort. If I didn't know better, I might say he had an interest in me. Then again, I don't know anything about the man. Awkwardness blooms inside me and Vivian turns a small laugh into a cough.</p><p>\"Well? Let's get it started now.\" I say the last in my best Black Eyed Peas impersonation. My humor has the desired effect. The others look to Romeo, who nods and the excitement level rises again, but this time for a different reason.</p><p>Elsa heads in after Lori, presumably to tell her to grow up and come join in on the fun.</p><p>Not waiting for the others, I toss my coat on the couch near the door and pull off my shirt. The rustle of clothing behind me indicates the others are following my lead. I catch Spike eyeing me once more, and I push the thought out of my head before Vivain loses her aplomb and starts laughing out loud. Once my pants and shoes land on the floor the first tingle of transformation seeps into my mind and races across my skin.</p><p>The magic rushes forward and the force hunches me to the floor. Pain washes through my veins as my limbs elongate and sprout fur. In less than five seconds I'm in my wolf form; cloaked in a thick coat of hair and muscle.</p><p>It takes the others a little longer, all except for Romeo and Elsa who can change as fast as I do. I turn my golden eyes up to my master, to see the vampire staring at me.</p><p>\"God, you're gorgeous.\" By the twinkle in her eye, I'm betting she means when I'm naked, and not as a wolf.</p><p>\"Nope, both ways.\"</p><p>Damn, is she in my head again and I don't know it?</p><p>\"How about I get the door and you all get started on the hunt?\"</p><p>The cold smells clean, with only the barest hint of blood on the air. My muscles tremble in their eagerness to run. With a playful yip, I bound out the door and the six wolves barrel through to follow. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Vivian</p><p>Something doesn't feel right in my head. I can't quite place what it is, but I know something is off. It's a crappy feeling and after trying to examine it while listening to a pack of hormone-crazy wolves, I'm still no closer to discerning what it could be.</p><p>The cold wraps its steely arms around me as I head back to the main building. The baying and yipping of the wolves recedes into the darkness behind me. Ah, death is in the air. Most vampires might think that was just peachy, but I've had enough of it lately.</p><p>I think when this week ends, I'll need a vacation myself. Grab Rafe, head down to our island off the southern coast of Argentina... the darkness won't be as long, like it is in the summer when we visit, but it will be a nice escape from the current challenges of managing a seethe larger than two.</p> <p>I pass through the hot tub grotto and head into the now silent dining room. The hunters should be out for a few hours before needing to refresh from the cold. The scent of blood coffee still lingers in the air and I'm grateful for the small moment of solitude.</p><p>The images in the cabin race back as I lower myself onto a leather chair near a window. Who could have killed Melvyn? The blood in the room indicates it was a violent death, but the draining of the Were's corpse means it certainly wasn't one of Romeo's pack.</p><p>There! A black spot on my radar.</p><p>What the hell is going on?</p><p>I stand and close my eyes. My senses drift out and down into the very building itself. The bright, cheery atmosphere of the eating area fades away and I'm left examining a series of electrical impulses in a cloud within my mind. Something hangs over one of my seethe and brings them closer to the dangerous pit within each of the undead.</p> <p>The only thing I know for certain is it can't be Joanna. I haven't exchanged blood with her since our first time because of the extended time I spent in her mind. I learned the hard way what playing too long in another vamp's head can do after a blood exchange. Severing the mental connection afterward was the only way I've found to give them a chance to survive with their sanity intact.</p><p>The heavy feelings of despair I'm sensing seem to be coming from the direction of our suite. Heading back to the locked door near the kitchen's walk-in refrigerator, I nod to the employee sitting behind the counter with a cookbook, whiling away the time until needed by a guest.</p><p>The lights are off in our living room and a soft glow comes from the light over the stove in the connected kitchen. The emotions I'm sensing are coming from below me now, so I know it's got to be from the command center. Judging by the time, Asa should still be on duty.</p><p>The heavy basement door swings back easily at my touch and the scent of vampire blood spills up out of the darkness. Leaping down the stairs in one bound, the scent pounds through my head as I identify the smell of recent gunfire as well. I trigger the locking mechanism and the concrete wall in the corner slides slowly open.</p><p>Before it can fully slide to allow a normal stride, I turn sideways and squeeze myself through into the computer room beyond. Asa whirls around on his swivel chair and at the sight of me, his face crumbles into fear.</p><p>\"I can explain,\" he says.</p> <p>\"What the hell happened down here? Are you okay?\"</p><p>His face smoothes out and reveals nothing. Blood stains, hastily cleaned, mar the concrete floor and walls. His clothes look clean, but his body smells unwashed. Traces of sex, cordite, silver, and blood radiate from him in a miasma of guilt.</p><p>\"I shot Joanna and beheaded her.\"</p><p>Did I just fucking hear that right? \"Excuse me?\"</p><p>\"Joanna was not loyal to the seethe. She plotted to capture and drain you and tried to enlist my help.\"</p><p>Shock courses through my body, only to be quickly replaced by anger.</p><p>Thought instantly becomes action, as I leap across the room and backhand the younger vampire into the control panel. The sound of glass breaking and plastic crunching doesn't slow me down. I wrap my hands in his shirt and slam his head repeatedly into the console table until the creak of wood threatens to break under my wrath.</p><p>The blackness within creeps up to overwhelm me in my rage and my voice comes out harsh and broken. \"Who gave you the right to end a life that is mine?\"</p> <p>Asa moves to grab my wrists in an attempt to get me to stop shaking him like a dog with a rat. His defensive touch has an aggravating effect and my fist flies repeatedly at his face, until I feel some small satisfaction in seeing it covered in red. I open my hand and deliver loud resounding smacks, splattering blood over the desk and myself.</p><p>\"You fool!\" Over and over I backhand the fledgling, the inner rage still unsatisfied. \"What have you done?\" The young vampire slumps in my hold, no longer attempting to stop me.</p><p>Warm hands grab my shoulders from behind.</p><p>\"Dria! That's enough! Get a hold of yourself!\"</p><p>Rafe's voice holds a twinge of real fear, triggering me to back slowly away from my inner abyss. I reach down, curling my hands into Asa's bloody shirt and fling his body across the room where it hits the wall and slides to the floor.</p><p>\"You should have called me, you fool! She was healing from a blood addiction and I was doing what had to be done.\"</p><p>The wounds on Asa's face have already started to heal as he pulls himself into a seated position. \"She was crazy, Vivian. I swear! She tried to drain me. There was no time to call and I made a split-second decision.\"</p><p>\"Idiot! You could have incapacitated her instead of cutting her head off.\"</p><p>Asa hangs his head, resting it on his pulled-up knees. \"She was stronger than me. She couldn't be trusted and was a threat to the seethe. I acted on the knowledge I had.\" His voice comes out low and tinged with regret. \"I didn't know about her addiction. If I had, I wouldn't have killed her.\"</p><p>The betrayal burning through my gut feels like a cigarette placed against skin-white-hot and focused.</p><p>\"You did not need to know about her addiction! I am the master here. Not you.\"</p><p>Anger outweighs common sense and I move forward to kick him. A hand grabs my long hair, yanking my head back. I whirl around to face my calm husband, standing next to the ruins of the computer table with a fistful of copper strands.</p><p>\"Not so fast, love. What's done is done. Beating the poor boy won't bring her back.\"</p><p>\"It will teach him his place!\"</p><p>\"Like you were beaten when you were his age? What did it teach you?\"</p><p>Dammit! I hate it when he's right. It taught me to hate and prompted me to plot their death. But it also taught me to try to keep a low profile; something killing Joanna certainly was not.</p><p>\"His actions warrant punishment. I will have to report this death to the Tribunal and I don't need more eyes on us right now.\"</p><p>A groan comes from Asa. \"I'm sorry. My training as a soldier kicked in and I did what I thought was right. I took out the enemy.\"</p><p>\"She was your seethe-mate,\" I bark out, \"and you had just fucked her.\"</p><p>Rafe pulls in a sharp breath. \"Wow, I bet that had to be interesting.\"</p><p>\"I'll soon find out.\" Without further ado, I push my way, none-too-gently, into Asa's scattered thoughts. Images of destruction in Afghanistan come hurtling to the surface to obscure most of what I need to see. Within a few moments, I have an eyewitness account of all that happened here in the basement.</p><p>I release his mind with more compassion than I'm feeling. No need to damage him in my quest for truth. I would've liked to erase some of the Afghan memories for him, but those experiences make him who he is, so they are best left alone.</p><p>The anger and hurt coiling deep inside don't allow me to offer him soothing words or forgiveness. He shouldn't have chopped her head off and that's that. The fact he drank her blood at the end only reinforces he truly did think of her as an enemy. Asa's own perceived age in his energy aura will appear slightly older than he really is now because of consuming most of Joanna's death blood.</p><p>It makes me wonder if that could be why he killed her. He's been learning about our culture little by little since he arrived, having practically survived for eighteen months with almost no knowledge of the way things are done. Could he have wanted more power because Joanna and Drew were older and stronger?</p><p>Not many vampires, young or old, make numerous kills of other vampires. Unless, of course, they become enforcers. He clearly has it in him.</p><p>I turn away in disgust and storm out into the connecting basement workroom. \"Clean it up! I want the blood gone, the body on ice, and the equipment replaced within the hour.\"</p><p>I head up the stairs to the kitchen and pause a moment. The sanctuary of our personal suite feels tainted by the energies of all who tromp through these rooms to get to the command center and basement rooms. Once this hunt is over, I'm approving work on another entrance to the area. I need to reclaim our peaceful space and give us back the haven we created.</p><p>The smell of fresh coffee penetrates the thick fog of emotions churning within me. Hearing Rafe come up the stairs, I automatically move to pour him a cup.</p><p>I turn to give it to him and he gently takes it from my hand and puts it on the counter. Strong arms embrace me in a tight hug and some of the tension pours out of me.</p><p>\"Leibling, he did not know.\" Rafe uses the German endearment, meaning darling, while running his hand up and down my back. \"Let's get the blood off you before anything else.\"</p><p>Pulling back and looking down, I see that not only is my right hand covered in the younger vampire's blood, but splatters of it also stain my silk suit.</p><p>\"Damn. That's not going to come out, is it?\"</p><p>Rafe gives me a half-smile. \"I doubt it.\"</p><p>Ignoring the blood for a moment, I snuggle back into my husband's embrace. A sigh escapes me as I tighten my arms around him, carefully so as not to get my bloody hand on him.</p><p>\"I had no choice but to cut her off from my blood. This has happened before. Either they get past the craving and settle in, or I have to kill them.\"</p><p>\"Perhaps Asa saved you the trouble?\"</p><p>My head whips up. \"No! It was still too early to tell. We wouldn't have been at that point for another six months or so.\"</p><p>The semi-darkness of the kitchen soothes, but my recent actions still leave me pumped and jittery.</p><p>\"I need to shower. Give me a few minutes.\"</p><p>Rafe nods and takes the bloody mug from the counter and pours its contents into a clean one. The man hates to waste coffee.</p><p>I shake my head at his normal behavior, which seems highlighted in this bizarre moment. Does nothing faze the man anymore? Incredible.</p><p>The water of the shower mixes with the blood to pool briefly below me before swirling down the drain. What should I do about Asa's transgression? What the hell am I going to tell the Tribunal about it? I can't very well tell them she was addicted to me because I controlled her mind for hours, basically making her a passenger in her own body.</p><p>I didn't have a seethe over the centuries for various reasons. I don't like to lead a large group-too many issues always going on in the background, too many people wanting a say. Being a solitary person doesn't mean I don't like the company of others. I do, or I wouldn't be so social and run an inn. But I've always preferred to work alone. No other vampires to account for. No vampires to discuss things with. My way, my mistakes, and I take things as they come-with Rafe by my side, as I'd always dreamed.</p><p>I leave the shower and dry off, contemplating what to wear for the rest of the evening. Will the hunters be reporting back in to warm up soon? I check my watch. It's only half past eleven. Hard to believe the hunt has barely been underway for two hours and we've had two deaths so far.</p><p>I still have to figure out what happened to Melvyn and hope the hunters aren't killed by Emiko before the week ends. Or vice versa. I'm beginning to think this whole scheme was not such a good idea after all.</p><p>I stroll naked into the bedroom and see Rafe waiting for me. He stands up when I enter and starts to unbutton his shirt.</p><p>\"What are you doing? You didn't get blood on you. What you're wearing looks fine.\"</p><p>He slowly takes his shirt off; his eyes not leaving mine the whole time. \"I'm not changing clothes. I think I know what you need to get your mind off of this.\"</p><p>I'm not in the mood for sex. One of my vampires was just killed by another vampire in my care and I just beat on him for a few minutes in frustration. If I were the type that got off on violence that would be one thing, but I'm not.</p><p>\"How about later, hon? I'm not feeling it.\"</p><p>He ignores me and pulls off his undershirt next. The sculpted planes of his torso ripple when he tosses his clothing on a nearby chair. I think he might be flexing to entice me. Rafe starts to work on his pants next. The belt comes off in a fluid motion and my eyes follow its whip-like movements through the air.</p><p>He slowly works the button and zipper, while back-stepping out of his shoes. My attention to his every move has the usual effect on him. He's hard and ready behind his fly, and his full magnificence comes into view once his zipper lowers. He went commando again, knowing how much it turns me on. It also helps when we want a quickie somewhere to not have him bound up by my favorite boxer briefs.</p><p>He steps out of his lowered trousers, one leg at a time, hooking his thumb in each sock and peeling it off on the way. His thighs are slightly hairy and solid in their strength. God, just looking at him is enough to make me want to forget the cares of the world and hop into bed with him.</p><p>Rafe reaches for a small paring knife I hadn't noticed before, sitting on the round table beside him.</p><p>\"What are you planning with the knife?\" He's never held one before when naked and I have to say it's a striking image, even if the knife is small.</p><p>Without answering me, he takes his meaty cock in his other hand, holding it to one side, while placing the knife at the base of his erection. Before I have a chance to realize what he's doing, he nicks himself in a shallow one-inch slit and the delicious aroma of my lover's blood fills the air.</p><p>\"I seem to have cut myself,\" he says with a smoldering look on his face. \"Would you come lick it for me so it heals?\"</p><p>Desire coils in my gut, as my canines descend at his offer. A tiny sliver of blood wells up in the wound and threatens to drip down onto his hairless sack. I'm on my knees before him in an instant, replacing my hand with his own and pulling his cock to the side so I can access the cut.</p><p>My tongue snakes out to lick the beads of crimson that settle at the base while my other hand fondles his balls gently. I latch onto the small injury and suck in a slow draw of pressure. Rafe's moan of pleasure sounds from above as I start to stroke his hardness in time to my suction.</p><p>Wetness gathers at my opening and if I had a third hand, I'd be stroking my own clit. I tug on his sack and draw it gently from his body, all the while kneading the sensitive globes within. It doesn't take long before the cut seals. My appetite has been aroused and it won't go quietly back into hiding.</p><p>The desire to have him take me wars with the desire to use my teeth to carefully open up a new wound. A glistening bead of pre-cum on his tip makes the decision for me. Lapping delicately with my tongue, the salty fluid contrasts nicely with the richness of his blood. Rafe's hand cups the back of my head in a silent plea to continue.</p><p>I circle his wide head slowly, ensuring enough moisture from my mouth coats the top portion of his shaft. Once it shines like a well-oiled tool, I open my mouth wide to take as much of his thickness in as I can. In his haste to have me go deeper, Rafe moves forward a bit, forcing one of my sharp peaks onto his sensitive skin.</p><p>The pain causes him to jerk back slightly, but nothing can stop the trickle of blood from entering my mouth and urging me to suck. Clamping my mouth securely around his shaft-never one to waste a drop-I will my canines to recede so as to not cause him further damage. Sometimes a little pain in lovemaking can be good and it certainly proves true in this instance.</p><p>Skirting the line between pleasure and pain, I can feel Rafe's thigh muscles tighten as he struggles to stay in place. I snake one hand around his hips to grasp a firm cheek and encourage him to press forward into my mouth more. With a slow push, he thrusts his hips toward me, gaining an inch deeper into my wet mouth.</p><p>His rhythm is slow and smooth, pulling back only a little before reseating as deep as I can take him. I release his balls and reach under them to the tight pucker of his ass. The tip of my finger grazes the opening and Rafe gasps at the sensation. Easing my finger in about a half-inch, I stimulate all the nerve endings, which I know are sending electrical jolts to his genitals.</p><p>I increase my suction and quicken his thrusts with my hand pressing his ass cheek. Rafe's breathing sounds ragged and harsh-beautiful music to any lover's ears.</p><p>\"I can't hold off much longer,\" he says.</p><p>Not one to miss the opportunity for mutual gratification, I pull all my attentions away. The strain of holding off has tightened the muscles in his abdomen and when I look up I see delectable ripples in his mid-section. Running my hands up his thighs to his stomach causes a shudder to run through his body.</p><p>\"Come catch me,\" I say as I launch myself into flight. I make it to the door before a heavy weight slams into me from behind, pinning me to the carpet runner in the hall. I buck back with my hips, dislodging him before he has a chance to wrap his arms around me in an attempt to hold me in place.</p><p>I'm up again, only to be pushed into the door leading to our office. The door hinges give under the combined force of our bodies. We crash through the opening, into the room beyond.</p><p>The life pulsing through my veins sings with excitement. Rafe may not be the natural predator I am, but he sure as hell makes up for it in sheer determination.</p><p>\"You want to play, do you?\" He says, pressing his full length against me on the carpet with his cock nestling my buttocks.</p><p>Not any more. Put it inside me.</p><p>Should I tease you for a bit? They way you did me?</p><p>Before I have a chance to respond, he takes my wrists in one hand, extending my arms above my head. My face presses sideways against the rug and he can see the desire shining in my eyes. I wiggle my hips in answer, trying to entice him to take me now.</p><p>A light touch skims the side of my breast, curving inward to cup my fullness. Fingers tweak and pinch my nipple, as I buck to angle myself for penetration. The head of Rafe's cock slips down to nestle under my cheeks, but still refuses to enter my dripping wetness.</p><p>It would be easy to overpower him right now and take what I want, but that is never the point with a little fun like this. It's the illusion of being trapped and the trust you have in your partner that makes submitting, even if only briefly in love-play, so enticing.</p><p>You sexy little thing, Rafe says in my mind. If I had a crop right now, I'd turn your ass pink.</p><p>Shivers run down my spine and a slight chill makes me shudder. The mere thought of the sturdy tool hitting my backside sends me into a spiral of desperation to have his dick in me immediately.</p><p>Rafe's hand leaves my breast and in a moment, a soft chenille fabric touches my hip.</p><p>\"Lift up so I can put this pillow under you.\"</p><p>I comply and the added support tips me, allowing the perfect angle for entry. My arms, stretched above me, add a subtle tension to the muscles in my body, exaggerating the pull of penetration as he presses forward.</p><p>An audible sigh escapes me, \"Ahh...\"</p><p>Rafe's longer body curves over mine, pushing me into the rug. He releases my wrists from one hand, instead taking my arms, one in each hand, and spreads them out above my head. The anger inside me over Asa, and Joanna's death, starts to fade at my husband's light dominance.</p><p>Stop thinking about them and think about this... he punctuates his mental communication with a hard shove of his hips, seating himself deep. Added weight on my upper body and arms is a result of him taking the leverage he needs... and the extra heaviness, pinning me to the floor, adds to my excitement.</p><p>Over and over he thrusts within me, building a slow pressure inside with each minute that passes.</p><p>\"More,\" I say. \"Give me more.\"</p><p>Hot breath warms the side of my neck and one of my wrists is set free. Rafe's hand snakes underneath us and over the pillow, to settle at my hard clit. Wet lips lock onto the area below my ear in a deep, sucking kiss. Closing the toned walls inside me on each inward stroke of his dick brings an excited grunt from my husband.</p><p>Pain explodes in my neck as my lover bites down. The skin doesn't break, but it's exactly what I need to push me over the edge. I thrash on the floor, into the pillow, and against his questing fingers.</p><p>I push the pleasure out of my body to encase my partner in the intensity of the release he's giving me. The hips pistoning back and forth become erratic as a shout rips from Rafe, pulling his mouth away from my neck.</p><p>Shudders rack both our bodies as our orgasms continue on. The thrusts become slower, but his stiffness remains. My weight shifts to the side, off the pillow, as my husband pulls me back against the length of him to lay us together on the rug.</p><p>A warm whisper reaches my ear. \"You never cease to amaze me, liebling.\"</p><p>I snuggle back into his strong arms to cherish our stolen moment. I know we need to get up and figure out what to do and how to handle the recent events, but they'll still be there in a few minutes and damned if his dick isn't still hard.</p><p>\"Feel up for round two?\" I ask, as I turn in his arms and press him down into the floor. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Rafe</p><p>The sweat dripping down the side of my face into my hair feels good. I don't think we've had such an intense lovemaking session in quite a while. And Lord knows, Dria needed it with the stress the next few hours are bound to bring.</p><p>\"Don't shower,\" I say to her as she disappears back into the hall. I want my scent to stay on her as long as possible with all the randy wolves on the property.</p><p>\"You staking a claim, caveman?\"</p> <p>I rise and follow my delectable wife to our bedroom. \"Humor me, okay? You may not think it matters, but I know it does.\"</p><p>She turns back to give me a deep smoldering kiss, as if we hadn't just done the deed twice. \"No worries, love. I think you smell divine.\"</p><p>Dria saunters off to her walk-in closet, which I swear looks like a mini-Nordstrom, to pick some new clothes. She emerges dressed in sturdy jeans, layered over silk long-johns and topped by a black cashmere, body-hugging sweater. I pick something similar for myself-meaning a sweater and jeans, minus the cashmere. We'll be outside and this is not the season for skimpy.</p><p>\"We need to chat and plan-you up for it?\" she asks.</p><p>\"No time like the present.\" I don't need to add I always think more clearly after sex-that is, as long as I'm not tired. She knows both after sixty-five years. \"Want some coffee?\"</p> <p>She nods in response and settles at the round scarred-up table in our galley kitchen, while I pour us some joe.</p><p>\"Do you think Emiko killed Melvyn?\" she asks, accepting the offered cup.</p><p>I take a long sip from my mug before answering. \"Based on what we learned, I wouldn't think so, but I don't know her well enough to judge.\"</p><p>Dria's look becomes pensive while she gazes out the window over the sink, her mug untouched in front of her. \"It doesn't match what we know of her so far. Too messy. And her scent wasn't there.\"</p><p>\"Well, that's the kicker isn't it? Jon said he smelled a trace of the vamp from the earlier occupants in the lobby, right?\"</p><p>\"Yeah, which means it could be any one of our vampire hunters.\"</p> <p>\"Any of them seem crazy enough to deviate from the hunt so soon?\" I ask.</p><p>\"Ah, no. Not that I can figure.\"</p><p>Time to bring up the difficult topic. \"You plan on calling the Tribunal about Joanna now or telling this Coraline chick while she's here?\"</p><p>\"No on both counts, if I can manage it. I know I have to inform them, but I'd rather wait until the week is out.\" A sigh escapes her as she slumps back into her chair. \"This freakin' sucks.\"</p><p>I don't like seeing my wife down. She's such a force to be reckoned with, seeing her doubt herself for even a moment makes me want to leap in and fix whatever I can. The only things stopping me are the knowledge she wouldn't appreciate it and she'd ask if she needs help. That's not to say I can't help in small ways.</p><p>\"I'll head back to the basement in a bit and see what Asa did with her remains.\"</p><p>She nods, while tapping her foot in agitation. \"I think we need to question Emiko.\"</p><p>\"You mean face to face?\"</p> <p>\"Yeah.\"</p><p>\"And how do you suppose we do that?\"</p><p>She picks up her mug and cups the warmth in her hands a moment before taking a small sip. \"I was thinking we could track her movements on the property while waiting for more info to come in.\" Her eyes start to light with the mischievous glint I know so well. \"I'd bet my fortune that things are not what they seem in regard to the charges against her.\"</p><p>Now I'll see if I can get her to reach out to friends she doesn't admit to herself she has. \"Would you consider calling Rolando?\"</p><p>\"Do you really think he'd tell me anything of value?\"</p><p>\"He might. You won't know unless you try.\" The scowl on her face makes me realize I need to back off and let her come to the decision on her own.</p><p>The opening bars of \"I Drink Alone\", by George Thorogood, chime from my discarded cell phone on the counter. Tipping my chair back on two legs, I reach out and snag it off the counter. I flip it open as the chair legs touch back down to the tile.</p><p>\"Yello?\" Two recent orgasms have put me in a mellow mood, to say the least, despite the trouble we're facing.</p><p>Asa's hesitant voice reaches me from the other end. \"Sightings of Emiko have come in from Bebe, Don, and Stephen. All separately over the past thirty minutes. No contact was made with the fugitive. The others haven't reported in yet. The cameras showed Stan was out by the apartments with Sanji about fifteen minutes ago. No report from the wolves yet.\"</p><p>\"Have you heard from Cy?\"</p><p>\"No, but the sun is up in New York. We may not hear from him 'til later.\"</p><p>\"Has the equipment on the control desk been replaced?\"</p><p>\"Yes, sir.\"</p><p>\"Good, I'll be down in a few.\" I snap the phone closed and look over at Dria. \"You know, I think he meant to do good. Try not to judge him too harshly.\"</p><p>Her face sets in a frozen mask, devoid of emotion. \"Time will tell, won't it?\"</p><p>Without another word, she sets her mug back down and rises from the table. She grabs her big, fur-lined coat hanging by the backdoor, steps into her waiting boots, opens the door, and slips out into the frigid air.</p><p>I need some time to think before I call Rolando. I'll be back in a few minutes.</p><p>I want to be here when you call him.</p><p>Yeah, okay.</p><p>And with that, she melts into the darkness. There isn't as much anger whirling around in her head as there was prior to our romp in the office. She seems to be doing okay, but I'll have to watch her around Asa for a bit. When under pressure, she has a tendency to lash out and ask questions later.</p><p>She keeps me on my toes-that's for damn sure. Like herding a lion. Never kid yourself into believing the lion isn't going where it wants, which just happens to coincide with where you want it to go for a brief moment.</p><p>Taking another gulp, I move to top off my coffee before heading out to the front desk. I'll put off going downstairs until Dria comes back.</p><p>The clattering of pots and pans from the commercial kitchen greets me as I open the security door from our suite. Our back-up chef stands behind a stainless-steel counter.</p><p>\"How's it going, Stephanie?\"</p><p>She jumps a bit at my voice. \"Sorry, sir. I didn't hear you come in. Things could be better.\" Her eyes dart away while she adjusts the white apron covering her ample hips. \"We're going through a lot of food with Paul experimenting on his shift.\"</p><p>\"Do you think a sous-chef, to help him as a taster, might be a good idea?\"</p><p>Her face brightens and loses its pinched, worried expression. \"Yes, I think that might work.\"</p><p>\"Anyone you have in mind suitable for the job?\"</p><p>\"How about Diane?\"</p><p>I picture Dr. Cook's daughter, who joined the staff last year: pretty, curvy... a wild, sexy streak in her a mile wide. Not a good choice around Paul right now. Hmm... I hate how cold and calculating I am right now-but who would be a better choice not to encourage him to snap and possibly cheat on his wife? My mind settles on one of the single men.</p><p>\"I think Diane is an asset where she is right now. How about Bob?\"</p><p>She chokes back her surprise. \"The big guy from the ground crew?\"</p><p>\"Yeah. Set things up with him. Now that I think about it, we really just need a taster for a few hours a week, not a true sous-chef. Paul can handle the rest of the work on his own.\"</p><p>\"Okay, sir. I'll set it up.\"</p><p>Nodding my thanks, I head for the lobby. There's a slight figure leaning against the front desk, with his back to me. As I approach, the man turns and I see that it's Sanji's companion... the calm one. Damn... his name was...?</p><p>\"Vikram,\" he says, reaching his hand out to shake my own.</p><p>\"Yes, thank you for reminding me. There have been a lot of new faces recently. Is there something we can do for you?\"</p><p>\"No. I'm good.\" He radiates good will and a surge of energy. \"Just checking to see if there has been any news from Sanji.\" He shifts his weight from side to side, like he has to pee or something.</p><p>\"Nothing so far. They should be good for a few more hours and then will come in to feed and warm up.\"</p><p>\"Fine. I'm off to the game room,\" he nods his goodbye and turns to head toward the north wing.</p><p>Tommy's behind the front desk and I raise my eyebrows at him in question, \"Anything else come up?\"</p><p>\"Nope, it's been pretty quiet, mate,\" he looks down at some pink slips scattered across his workstation. \"Wait, a message did come in from cabin two.\"</p><p>My ears perk up. That's where the dead English werewolf was found. Now if that doesn't sound like a movie plot, then I don't know what does. \"Yes?\"</p><p>\"He was checking to see if Jet was ready to head out.\"</p><p>\"Did you relay the message to Jet?\"</p><p>\"I haven't seen him. I activated the message light on his and Matt's room, but they haven't checked with me yet.\"</p><p>Interesting. I wonder if Jet stopped by Melvyn's cabin to get a wolf snack and got carried away? Or maybe he made sexual advances on the lone wolf and Melvyn wasn't game? Considering Jet brought Matt with him and never seems to want for a plaything, that scenario seems unlikely.</p><p>\"Thanks, Tommy.\" His crooked smile flashes at me from under a poorly-set broken nose.</p><p>Dria abruptly breaks into my thoughts, Hey, I'm back and I'm about to call.</p><p>Would it kill you to wait for me? I project my agitation at her statement.</p><p>Afraid you might miss some good gossip?</p><p>Don't push me away like the others while you work through your distrust issues. I snap back at her. I won't allow it.</p><p>Fine, Mister Complainer. Then hurry up.</p><p>I know her anger isn't directed at me, so I refrain from lashing back. It's hard, but I've had years of experience dealing with the walls she erects around herself. The connection between us cuts off and I glance down at the pink paper in the young Aussie's hand.</p><p>\"Hey Tommy, don't worry about the message. Give it to me and I'll take care of it.\"</p><p>\"Sure thing, boss.\" He hands it to me and I turn back the way I came.</p><p>Taking a deep breath, I try to push out the irritation Dria stirred in me. At times, the powerful vamp acts more like a paranoid general-one who sees those in her command as spies and disloyal. Her past experience in Mikov's seethe as a young woman, and then as a young vampire, certainly taught her those instincts the hard way.</p><p>This recent issue with Asa could set her off for the whole week. Defusing her anger and redirecting her focus will be my biggest challenge over the next few days. Perhaps some more hot, sweaty sex will be on the agenda.</p><p>A small grin forms on my face as I wander back through the dining room and kitchen to our suite. More sex and no more dead bodies-that should do the trick.</p><p>The peace from our darkened living room is marred by my wife's pacing, the cordless phone clutched firmly in one hand.</p><p>\"Took you long enough.\" I ignore her taunt, knowing its true source.</p><p>\"I have only a few hours before the sun comes up in Buenos Aires.\"</p><p>I nod and walk past her to the kitchen. I think the carafe still has some coffee left. Pouring myself the last cup, I add some creamer as Dria finally succumbs and calls.</p><p>\"This is Dria McAndrews, I'd like to speak with Rolando.\"</p><p>There is a pause for a few minutes while the current gofer answering the phones tracks down the member from the Inner Circle. Rolando isn't an Ancient yet, but his spot close to them as an advisor is a much-coveted one.</p><p>My enhanced human senses, thanks to sharing Dria's blood, range pretty close to those of a vampire. I can easily hear both ends of a phone conversation, a great skill to have when you have a pacing wife on your hands.</p><p>Rolando's smooth voice comes on the line. \"Why Dria, what a pleasant surprise. I take it you're enjoying Coraline's presence?\"</p><p>\"Can it, you hack. A phone call of warning would have been nice.\"</p><p>Rich laughter floats across the line before he settles down enough to respond. \"There were orders no one should reveal plans-to anyone, not just you. The choice of who got to go wasn't even announced until an hour prior to take-off.\"</p><p>\"Hmph.\"</p><p>\"Whatever did you do to earn the hateful gleam I saw in Cora's eye before she boarded the plane?\"</p><p>Dria waves a hand dismissively, \"Bygones. Let's just say it's professional jealousy and leave it at that. What can you tell me about Emiko?\"</p><p>\"Let me first ask-what do you know already?\"</p><p>\"A contact did some research for me and uncovered she was trained in ninjutsu before being turned over two centuries ago, but that's it so far.\"</p><p>\"Good, so you have some idea of who you're dealing with. She's highly skilled. I wouldn't doubt it if most of your hunters are killed before the end of the week.\"</p><p>Dria winces at his last statement. \"That would not be good for business.\"</p><p>Rolando's humor comes through loud and clear. \"No, I bet it wouldn't.\"</p><p>\"What can you tell me from her time serving the Ancients?\"</p><p>\"She's a skilled enforcer, her success ratio was almost as high as yours.\" My wife rolls her eyes at his statement, but it makes me wonder if there couldn't have been some \"professional jealousy\" from others brewing against the slight, Asian vamp as well. \"She served about five years before she snapped.\"</p><p>\"Snapped?\"</p><p>\"Quite shocking really. She tore apart five officials in one night and then placed the remains of their bodies near one of our hidden street entrances. The news and media had a field day.\"</p><p>\"But why? Did anyone think to ask?\"</p><p>\"Her claim of innocence could not be corroborated.\"</p><p>\"Wait-so she's essentially guilty until proven innocent?\"</p><p>\"This is not the U.S. judicial system we're dealing with, you know.\" The rounded tones of Rolando's Latino accent reveal a slight reprimand in his rejoinder. \"Her scent was on the bodies, they were killed by shuriken and chopped up with a katana-her chosen weapons.\"</p><p>\"Was there a trial?\"</p><p>\"Kind of. That's where things started to get a little weird...\"</p><p>Dria stops dead in her tracks and locks eyes with me. \"What are you getting at?\"</p><p>\"I don't have any proof. Just my own conjecture and gut telling me something isn't right. But I will say one thing before I get off the phone-all of this started after you reported Ivan's death this past fall.\"</p><p>\"Then I was right, she was the vampire who released Ivan under orders and sent him after Angie?\"</p><p>A click sounds from the cordless, indicating Rolando has ended the call before going into more detail.</p><p>\"Dammit!\" she says before slamming the phone onto the counter. \"What do you think?\"</p><p>\"I think something is up. But I have no idea what,\" I say.</p><p>\"Why is Emiko being used as a fall guy? Or is she complicit in this whole scenario?\"</p><p>Whoa. That's one I hadn't thought of. \"So she could be guilty, innocent, or involved in the conspiracy brewing around you?\" My cell phone chirps out Thorogood at my waist again, and I note it's Asa, calling from the basement. \"I need to go check on some things downstairs, see if any more info on the hunt has trickled in. Why don't you try to relax?\"</p><p>\"Relax? Are you out of your ever-loving mind?\"</p><p>I stand and approach her slowly. I wrap my larger body around hers in a fierce hug. \"You need to find your center. You will not solve anything if you're agitated. Exercise. Go through some sparring moves in the dojo. Try some yoga. Do something before you check on Paul.\"</p><p>Criminey. I almost forgot about him. Where is he?</p><p>He's sleeping, in his safe room below.</p><p>Oh, yeah. She sighs out a deep breath while relaxing a bit in my embrace. Okay, you're right. I need to chill for a bit before I attempt to help him. You've got things covered?</p><p>Yes, my love. I say in her mind as I step back releasing her. Go. I can handle things.</p><p>\"Let me go get some exercise clothes on and I'll head right out. Thanks, hon.\"</p><p>My glorious, but high-strung, wife heads down the hall and a bit of my own tension leaves me. I chug back the rest of my coffee and head down to the basement.</p><p>I trigger the hidden locking mechanism and wait for the wall to slide open. The smell of bleach wafts out of the opening, while my first view into the room reveals a bunch of broken-down cardboard boxes. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Asa</p><p>I swivel in my chair as the sliding wall comes to a halt. Tension coils every muscle in my body as I mentally prepare myself for another beating. I know Vivian was within her rights and she could have done much worse to me, but it goes against all my training to take another punishment without defending myself. Fighting back against your master could have deadly consequences-that much, I'm sure of.</p><p>Rafe strides through the opening alone. The fear I wasn't ready to admit to slowly drains away.</p><p>\"Clean up looks like it went well,\" he says by way of greeting.</p> <p>\"Yeah. We had replacements for the equipment in one of the new storage rooms down the hall.\"</p><p>\"Good.\" Rafe looks around. \"Where did you put Joanna?\"</p><p>I cringe inwardly at the reminder of what happened. I still stand by what I did at the time, but I can admit, too, it might not have been the only option. \"I wrapped her in plastic,\" I motion down the hall, deeper under the inn, \"and placed her in an unfinished portion of the basement-under the north wing. Where we haven't run any heat.\"</p><p>Rafe grunts his acknowledgment. \"I know you meant well. But it will take some time for you to earn back trust in Vivian's eyes. You know that, right?\"</p><p>\"I do now.\" I run my hand over my head. Think I feel some stubble. Damn. \"I really wasn't sure what in the hell to expect.\"</p> <p>\"Call Drew to replace you in here. I want you out on the property tracking Emiko.\"</p><p>I sit up straighter at the prospect of this new assignment. \"Really? Am I hunting her?\"</p><p>\"No. I want you to track her only-and try to manage it without getting caught. Vivian wants to talk to her, but she's not in the best frame of mind to do so right now. Once we get more data in from Cy we can decide what to do, but keeping tabs on the rogue will be in our best interest.\"</p><p>I nod in understanding before putting the call in to Drew, then head upstairs to the east wing. The lush tropical plants paired with the steel-drum island music, makes this one of my favorite spots. Today, Matt and Francesca are lounging by the water.</p><p>I bob my head in greeting, but don't hesitate or attempt to engage them in conversation. It will slow me down. I don't want to waste a moment on what could be an opportunity to redeem myself with Vivian.</p><p>The energy coursing through my body since I ingested Joanna's blood, makes me slightly jumpy and paranoid. But at the same time, I'm infused with enough power to ensure precision in every movement, with added strength to boot. It's a rush, that's for sure.</p> <p>Not anything like consuming Vivian's blood, but a rush all the same.</p><p>I pat my thigh, ensuring my gun is still strapped firmly in place. A touch at my hip confirms my back-up clips are stocked. I don the white, fur-lined parka Vivian ordered for those of us going out on patrol during the hunt, and the rest of my cold weather gear as well.</p><p>Slipping my ski mask down into place, I use my hip to open the emergency release bar on the sturdy exterior door and push out into the wind-howling darkness. At times, the cold barrenness reminds me of my winter tours in Afghanistan, but at others, like now, it reinforces the harshness of this region as unique unto itself.</p><p>Before I've had a chance to clear fifty feet from the door, my phone rings. Unzipping a bit, I reach into the neck of my parka and snag the cell in my shirt pocket. I fumble a bit and the phone clicks on before I bring it to my ear.</p><p>\"Asa? Asa, can you hear me?\" Drew's calm, confident tone reaches through the dark.</p><p>\"Go ahead, Drew. I'm here.\"</p><p>\"We've had some separate reports of Emiko sightings from Jet and Stephen come in. Looks like she was last seen over by the family cabins.\"</p><p>A coldness, beyond what I feel outdoors, grips my heart and for a moment I wonder if this ninja vampire is truly crazy. Would she risk snacking on one of the families and draw out Vivian's wrath? I don't think she could be that stupid and have survived as long as she has. So what does this information tell me? Who or what could she be after? Hmmm....</p> <p>\"Where were the werewolves spotted last?\" I ask.</p><p>\"Last report was from when you were still on duty.\"</p><p>Which reveals something interesting-the wolves were around the cabins right before Rafe came down. I wonder if she could be tracking the wolves in the hopes of cornering one for its more-powerful blood? Unless she can split one away from the pack, she'd be taking on a huge risk. I certainly wouldn't face down six full-grown werewolves on purpose.</p><p>\"The closest building beyond the cabins would be the bowling alley. I'll head there to see if I can spot her. Out for now.\" Placing the phone inside my inner jacket pocket this time, not my shirt one, I hope it will be easier to retrieve next time. I head the way my gut tells me-near the werewolves.</p><p>Running through the darkness has an almost eerie affect on one's perceptions. Christmas lights festoon not only the stone statues carved in various sexual poses, but all the small evergreens as well. The marble garden between the east and north wings blurs by as I weave along the paved walkway in haste.</p><p>Once I pass the guest cabins, I avoid the turn-off for the family ones and head deeper along the trail to the low-slung building used as a bowling alley. Vivian had a huge master plan in place when she designed this place, that's for damn sure. Between bowling, to skiing, tubing, and skating there doesn't seem to be a lack of activities for the undead, or their human companions.</p><p>Entering the locked front doors of the bowling alley with the help of my master key, I stop just inside the vestibule. The sounds of banging and splitting wood put my senses on high alert as I creep forward, shedding my coat in the process. I crouch down low to peer around the corner, staying out of the line of sight in case someone has a weapon aimed at the entrance.</p><p>A naked Jonathan struggling with our fully-clothed criminal is certainly not what I thought I'd see. I stifle a laugh when I see the desperation on the Were's face as he tries to hold the stronger vampire off.</p><p>\"You're not listening, bitch! She'll kill you.\" Jon punctuates his meaning with a double kick to the woman's chest, pushing her back only a few inches.</p><p>\"I'm cold and hungry-you'll do fine to warm me up, wolf boy.\"</p><p>The expression on Emiko indicates she's past the point of rational thought. I'm betting she has a slight Were-blood addiction and she's not hearing what he's saying anymore.</p><p>The darkened seating area is littered with the remains of broken chairs and tables. The slight vampire drags the Were by his ankles to a clear spot near the empty lanes.</p><p>\"Vivian does not share!\" Jon turns to scramble away but she's on him in an instant.</p><p>Realizing the truth in his words, I can't stand by and idly watch while she bites him. She'd be signing her own irrevocable death warrant. I leap across the space between us, tackling and ripping her body from his before she can plunge her fangs into the Were's neck.</p><p>The momentum takes us ten feet away, to land in one of the slick bowling lanes.</p><p>\"Run, Jon!\" I don't look to see if he's listening, my attention pinpointed on the black-haired fugitive now standing before me.</p><p>\"Well, well, well... If it's not another member of Vivian's seethe. You're the second one I've run into since this hunt started. Makes me wonder how fair this arrangement really is if you two found me so easily. Maybe you placed a tracker on me in the guise of these silver poison bracelets?\"</p><p>I'm pretty sure she's referring to meeting Drew in the green house, but I don't have a chance to ponder it as she turns to pursue the naked wolf. Jon pulls part of a broken chair leg out of his thigh while crawling into the area by the door. I slip a bit on the waxed wood before getting enough purchase to jump at her again, in a tackling attempt.</p><p>If I can get her down and subdue her, Jon might be able to change back into a wolf and make a break for it. I land on her squarely, covering her with my body while she lies prone on the floor.</p><p>\"Take a moment to think this through, Emiko.\"</p><p>\"I have. And I want the wolf.\"</p><p>She pushes back with her hips, thrusts off the floor with her hands and I fly through the air to land on a rack of bowling balls. She turns to run after Jon and I hurl one of the heavy black globes at her head. My shot lands low, plowing into her back and sending her reeling from the wolf. I stand with my legs apart, braced for her anger when she turns to face me.</p><p>\"He is Vivian's only servant, you fool!\" I'm not sure if my words are sinking in, but she's got a clearer look in her eyes. \"Do you think Alexandria the Great will share her sole vampire servant? Rethink what you're doing here or the hunt could be over before you've lasted a day.\"</p><p>A flash of black whizzes by and the thigh holster is torn from my leg.</p><p>\"Now that we've got your pesky silver out of the way, let's chat,\" she says.</p><p>Jon is nowhere to be seen and I can only assume he's left or gone into hiding. The lithe creature starts to circle me in a sideways step to the left.</p><p>\"Do you know what's more powerful than Were-blood?\" she asks.</p><p>\"No, I...\" I trail off as the answer hits me. She intends to feed on me since Jon is gone. I don't plan on going down without a fight, that's for damn sure.</p><p>Little by little, the tiny warrior gets closer, occasionally darting in to hit me or tear my clothing in passing. It occurs somewhere in the back of my brain, while I try to land an offensive strike and fail, I'm outclassed as a fighter and slower than the older vamp despite the copious amount of blood I drank from Joanna.</p><p>A passing blow lands on my shoulder, spinning me to the right. Pain explodes in my temple as I crash headfirst into the ball return. I stay down longer than needed in a feint to draw her closer.</p><p>It works and I turn to land a punch on her. Quick as a wink, she dances out of reach and I'm left struggling to form a strategy against a smaller, faster, and stronger opponent. Throwing the balls worked, but she's now standing between them and me.</p><p>\"I'm pretty sure killing me wouldn't be such a good idea,\" I say.</p><p>She throws back her head and laughs. \"I'm not stupid. I don't plan on killing you.\" She leaps at me in a swiftness I did not see coming and pins me to the wall. \"I plan on feeding from you.\" I pick up my arm to deliver a punch to the side of her head and she catches my larger fist in her petite hand. \"And I'd like to now.\"</p><p>The tearing of clothes she did earlier has left my chest exposed and part of my thighs as well. I strain with exertion, pushing myself against the wall and away from her open, sharp-toothed maw. She presses her chest to mine, leaving me nowhere to run.</p><p>All of our physical actions have taken an unexpected turn, and through no desire of my own, my cock begins to swell in my pants. Perhaps the traitorous body part will not catch her attention and I'll get out of this with only a loss of blood. Turning my head to the side, I brace myself, every muscle tense for the savage bite I expect to land.</p><p>The tiny woman rises up on her tiptoes, hands on my shoulders to boost closer to my neck. \"You smell good. Have you fed recently?\"</p><p>I don't answer. Squeezing my eyes shut, I try to lock down my mind from what's about to happen. I've heard some vampires feed delicately on a fellow undead; others do not, and go for a more vicious, subjugating experience. After my one and only blood-sharing experience during sex with Joanna, I really don't know what to expect.</p><p>\"How old are you, muscle-man with the silver bullets?\" She sniffs deep near the opening of my shirt, at the neckline. \"Hmm... I'd say you're over five, but under ten years changed. Am I right?\"</p><p>She gives me a hard shake, but I still refuse to answer. I guess the blood I drained from Joanna's fifty-year-old corpse has altered my own power signature slightly. Good to know.</p><p>If this bitch gets much closer she's gonna feel...</p><p>\"Oh! What is it we have here? Does the young vamp like to play rough?\" She cups my stiff cock through the tattered cargo pants. \"I'm betting with your face turned away, you were hoping this would go quickly and quietly, weren't you?\" She throws me to the slick floor and straddles my hips, feet on the polished wood. Leaning down, she fumbles at my crotch. A rasp of metal on metal and a release of pressure indicate she's lowering my zipper.</p><p>Crap! How in the hell do I get out of this one? She's hot and I am aroused, but I don't think I'm supposed to be fucking the enemy and enjoying it.</p><p>\"I smell another woman on you. You must be a bit of a playboy, hmm?\"</p><p>Since this evening was the first time I'd been laid in six months, I don't think the term applies, but I see no reason to answer her question. \"Don't.\"</p><p>She ignores me, pulling me out of my pants, testing the weight of my cock in one hand. \"Very nice,\" she says while kneading it. \"I think this will be an excellent addition while I feed.\"</p><p>Without further ado, she steps back and removes her pants. I tense to make a break for it, but she gives me a sharp look, effectively halting me. \"Want me to make it rougher? You run and I'll hurt you-we can do this with you screaming or with you enjoying it. 'Cause it's happening either way.\"</p><p>After the two beatings I've taken so far today, I'm inclined to lie still. Guess I'll have to take one for the home team. Damn.</p><p>She plants her feet again on either side of my still-clothed hips and squats down while leaning toward my exposed neck. The sharp pierce of her canine cuts the skin above my jugular, sending an electric shock wave coursing through me to my hard, waiting dick. Tight wetness enfolds my erection at the same time Emiko draws her first pull of blood from my throat.</p><p>Pleasure seeps into my brain despite my not wanting it. The mutual sensations of her sucking, eager mouth at my neck and her clasping, strong pussy on my cock, breaks what little control I have. I reach out to grab her hips and thrust her more firmly on me, impaling her deep.</p><p>\"Mmmm...,\" moans the suckling vampire. But she doesn't stop feeding.</p><p>Her firm, smooth skin beneath my hands marks a sharp contrast to my partially-clothed body while I pump. The energy pouring from my wound doesn't seem to slow me or affect my sensations; the opposite seems to happen.</p><p>The compulsion to pump faster and harder into her while she's locked on my vein drives out all rational thought. I curve my hands behind her hips to her tiny little ass, urging her faster and faster against me. If I cannot control what's happening to me then I will do my damnedest to finish it sooner.</p><p>The end comes crashing on me like a steam train, forcing the release from my body in a long jet of pleasure. The inner walls of my captor spasm slightly around me. She hesitates at my neck, perhaps on a sigh or in response to her own peak, I'm not sure, but I take advantage of it and rip the Asian vamp from my body, tossing her across the room.</p><p>\"That's enough,\" I say.</p><p>She catches herself in the momentum of my throw, turning the force into a graceful landing. Swiping the back of one hand across her bloody mouth, she stalks back to my spot on the floor.</p><p>\"It will do. For now.\" She bends to retrieve her pants, never taking her eyes off me the entire time. \"You have power within you, young one. More than you should, I think.\"</p><p>Like I'm going to spill my guts to this bitch just because she made me come? I snort. Yeah, like that'll happen anytime soon. I tuck my semi-erect dick back in my pants and scramble up to leave.</p><p>\"No chatting in our afterglow together? You'd rather pretend you hated it?\" In a dismissive gesture, she puts her back to me and cockily stalks away with her pants on. \"I have a feeling this week is going to be pretty easy. International Hunters - pah!\" She turns to me with a flourish while swinging her coat on. \"And now I know whom to stalk when I get hungry again.\"</p><p>A small pit of something forms in my stomach. An emotion I'm not comfortable with settles itself in deep while she heads casually for the exit.</p><p>Fear.</p><p>I was sent to track her and yet she's made it painfully clear she can best me whenever she desires. This certainly puts a crimp on my orders from Rafe.</p><p>The deadly woman slips into the darkness outside. A moment later, Jonathan enters from the men's room in the hall.</p><p>\"You never left?\" I ask. He's wearing my parka, naked beneath it.</p><p>\"It wouldn't have been right, man. She could have killed you and I don't think Vivian would have wanted that-or have been happy to hear I'd skipped out if it did happen.\"</p><p>I hang my head in shame. It was bad enough when I knew of Emiko's treatment of me, but to have it witnessed feels much worse.</p><p>\"Dude, you didn't have a choice. I also stayed to jump in if she tried to finish you off. I may not be a vampire, but I can still deliver a good ass-kicking when needed.\"</p><p>I don't want to talk about what happened. It's still too fresh. The experience borders the line between I wanted it and I didn't want it way too closely for me to examine right now.</p><p>The phone in my coat starts to ring and Jon fishes it out and flips it open.</p><p>\"Hey Drew, it's me Jon.\"</p><p>\"Why are you answering Asa's phone? Is he okay?\" Jon looks me over and turns away.</p><p>\"He got the shit kicked out of him by Emiko, but he's healing fast.\"</p><p>\"Emiko was there?\"</p><p>\"No, I'm making stuff up to confuse you.\" </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Drew</p><p>I don't know Jon all that well yet, he keeps to himself a lot.

She fed from me and fled back into the darkness.\"</p> <p>Considering I caught her in the green house before the hunt she sure is eating a lot today. \"I wonder what's making her so hungry.\"</p><p>\"It's got to be the cold and constant activity,\" he replies. \"It takes a lot out of a vamp and she's been in a warmer climate for years now.\"</p><p>\"I suppose,\" I say, though I'm not entirely convinced.</p><p>\"How are things on your end? Any news yet?\" Asa asks.</p><p>\"Nope. You think you can keep tracking the rogue or did she take too much blood from you?\"</p> <p>A slight hesitation and then, \"I'm okay. I'll head out now.\"</p><p>We end the call and I focus again on the map in front of me. Yes, I could easily use the one on the computer Asa has uploaded and marked, but having the tactile map laid out helps me to think strategically.</p><p>Large, flat pink erasers with names indicate the last report of the hunter's positions, and yellow highlighted areas indicate where Emiko attacked. She hasn't been stupid enough to go after the employees in their homes, so we're doing pretty well, all things considered.</p><p>Except for the dead wolf in cabin two. Poor chap. He seemed solid enough when we spoke in the lobby. I wonder which vampire he crossed paths with after he checked in? Vivian and Rafe said they're looking into things, maybe Jon too, but I haven't heard any news yet.</p><p>I shake my head at the thought of Asa getting a sound beating from Emiko. As a tracker, he never should have been in her line of sight, so he screwed something up there. Perhaps the army doesn't make 'em like they used to. I'll have to treat him to drinks in the bar after all this and see if I can coax the details out of him.</p><p>He's a tight-lipped bastard most of the time. Despite his recent rash behavior in killing Joanna, he seems to have a good head on his shoulders. He told me once, the hardest part of turning was not being able to contact his younger brother, Eric, whom he heard later followed in his footsteps and joined the Army, too. When you take into account his oldest brother was abducted by their mom when they were kids and left the country, well... I can see why not being able to connect with the younger brother he grew up with hurts so much.</p> <p>Best he learns the hard lessons now. Watching from the alleys and doorways in London while my own fair sister aged and died alone was certainly no fun. When she refused to marry the sixty-year-old man our uncle picked out for her, the rebellious action condemned her to spinsterhood.</p><p>The muted ring of the phone pulls me out of my musings.</p><p>\"This is Drew.\" My new name still sounds odd, even after twenty years. Lipshultz on a vampire? What was I thinking? The poor dead sod who had the name happened to look an awful lot like me. Eh, it works.</p><p>\"This is Cali. I don't believe we've met yet, have we?\" The lilting female voice reaches across the trans-continental line to me.</p><p>\"No ma'am, we have not. My master speaks highly of you.\"</p><p>\"Ah, you're one of the new seethe members. But of course, who else would be answering the bat phone, right?\" Before I can formulate an answer, she continues. \"How is Asa working out?\"</p><p>I'm sure I'm not supposed to mention her nephew's recent killing, so I'll stick to the basics. \"He seems to be adjusting well to the inn.\"</p><p>\"Which tells me squat. I'll have to call and badger him on how he's doing.\" I hear a rustling of paperwork over the line. \"The rogue, Emiko, is an interesting character to say the least.\"</p> <p>\"What have you found out?\"</p><p>\"I'll send the bulk of it over in an email. The newest info is what stuck out the most. It looks like she had a residence in Buenos Aires recently seized by the authorities.\"</p><p>Which makes sense if they suspect her of the killings, but I'm not sure what the local law knows of her recent alleged crimes. \"Was she renting or did she own it?\"</p><p>\"Excellent question, my good vamp. Glad to see you're on the ball. She owned it and it happened to fall in a block up for re-zoning right now.\"</p><p>\"Are you suggesting this has something to do with the Tribunal or the charges against her?\"</p><p>\"I'm not sure what it means, but I don't believe in coincidence,\" Cali says.</p><p>\"Can you find out who is behind the re-zoning and who will benefit from her property being seized?\"</p><p>\"Already on it. I'll get back to you with details when I have them. Oh, and check out the email, there is some good gossip in there too.\"</p><p>\"Such as?\" But she's gone-the line is dead. Rather odd. Couldn't quite place her accent, either. I heard she runs a nightclub in Manhattan with Cy, the vamp Vivian turned a few decades ago. A shiver steals up my spine at my own memories of the city. It's not a bad place by any means, just too many people and too loud for my taste. Which says a lot coming from a former Londoner.</p><p>Before I have a chance to open the email and review what Cali sent, the phone rings. It's the line programmed in to all the hunters' cells.</p><p>\"Drew here.\"</p><p>\"This is Don.\" An image of the slightly gray-haired, dapper vamp comes to mind. \"I'm up by the northwest corner of the property, near the windmills. I've seen no sight of our prey. Over.\"</p><p>I smile inwardly at the older vamp's military affectations. \"I'll mark it on the map. Thanks.\"</p><p>\"No hint on where she was last? Over.\"</p><p>\"Considering its been over half an hour I doubt it will do you any good. But she was last seen at the bowling alley, due south of you and slightly east.\"</p><p>A sigh comes over the connection. \"No, I suppose you're right. I'll keep trudging through the cold. Over and out.\"</p><p>As we end the call, I can't help but think his obvious discomfort is rather funny. The debonair vampire may have wanted the challenge, and paid dearly for it, but I bet all of the hunters are feeling the effects of the cold by now, at six hours into the hunt. Perhaps they would have enjoyed it more if it were a club-med type of experience-warm, sandy beaches, locked inside all day...dark, sultry nights where they hunt in a jungle.</p><p>I chuckle at the image. I wonder if the rest of the group is faring like Don, or if they truly understand what they got themselves into when they signed on for this frozen week of fun and adventure. Hell, should we gift wrap the damn rogue for them and give them her GPS locator information?</p><p>The two vamps hunting together, Stan and Stephen, seemed like they were crazy enough to be in this for the long hall. Sanji comes from a very warm climate; I bet she's going to need to come in out of the elements to refuel soon. The wolves are from Canada, more than likely they are the best-suited for this terrain and weather.</p><p>And the tall Amazonian-vamp, Bebe? She went out on her own and hasn't reported in for a while. We'll have to see how she's doing. Maybe I should detour Asa to check where she was last seen? Better to be safe than sorry. Wonder if the woman wandered off the property.</p><p>A quick glance at the blips on the screen reveals the Brazilian is indeed still on the resort's land. A cluster of dots by the employee apartments indicates the wolves, who agreed to wear trackers in a slim collar, have congregated for the moment. As I watch, the dots race toward the south, angling to the right side of the property.</p><p>I spin my chair, back to the map, and make some quick adjustments with the erasers. The werewolves either heard something or smelled something to make them dart off like that. When the vampires come in to warm up, maybe the wolves will stay out a bit longer and we can avoid having all the hunters back in the main building at once.</p><p>Tempers could be high and we still don't know which vampire has a Were-blood addiction and killed Melvyn. Best to avoid a bad scenario by not having both groups here together.</p><p>Checking the GPS locator numbers on the clipboard, I match up the signal numbers for Stan and Stephen. Placing their markers in new spots, I note the two are no longer hunting side-by-side, but have about a quarter of a mile between them. Could they be trying to set up a trap for their elusive prey?</p><p>The whole map looks like a stunted version of Risk, with advancing troops and retreating lines. I never fought on a battlefield with a unified force, but managed to survive on the streets and in the rural countryside alone, using sheer cunning.</p><p>A ringing breaks into my thoughts and I punch the speaker function on the hunters' line. A smooth, mellow voice greets me, \"Is anyone listening?\"</p><p>\"Drew here, go ahead.\"</p><p>\"This is Sanji. I'm calling to report a death.\"</p><p>Adrenaline seeps into my body, causing my already-heightened awareness to spike. I swing back to the blips on the screen and see she stands virtually on top of another signal. \"Continue.\"</p><p>\"It looks as if the rogue had an altercation with Bebe and the Brazilian woman did not survive.\"</p><p>Shit! This was always a possibility the hunters knew going in, but it's still shocking nonetheless. \"Is the corpse drained as well?\"</p><p>\"It wasn't, but it is now,\" Sanji says with satisfied lilt to her tone.</p><p>I think back to my own draining of Ivan when I beheaded him and my gut reels a bit at the thought of this one calmly mentioning how she recently drank from a beheaded vampire. Ugh. \"Um, okay then. Where are her remains?\"</p><p>\"I'm outside of a small building connected to a bunch of cables-facing the main building, it's to the left, but back about a mile of so. Oh-and the door has a big number one painted on it.\"</p><p>\"Got it.\" I know from the computer screen that she's standing near Gen One, the location for our primary generator. I wanted to know if the body was near her or perhaps she's carrying Bebe's cell, but I'll leave it for now and send someone to check.</p><p>\"Someone is approaching out of the woods.\" She goes quiet for a moment and then comes back on the line. \"It's one of your seethe-mates, the one with the shaved head.\"</p><p>Asa. \"Okay, he'll take care of things from here on out. Thanks for calling in.\"</p><p>We disconnect right as the landline rings and I sense movement behind me. I turn while grabbing the handset to see Vivian leaning on the door jamb.</p><p>\"Man,\" Asa says over the phone, \"that was one bitch of a fight. I watched from the woods.\"</p><p>\"You can fill me in later. Can you take care of the body?\"</p><p>A snort of disbelief comes over the line. \"Oh yeah, after the Indian vamp had her fun, the pieces should fit easily into a sturdy garbage bag, no problem.\"</p><p>The bloodthirstiness shown and reveled in for the past twelve hours disturbs me. I don't think I want to be here for the next hunt, that is, if there is another.</p><p>\"All right then, I'll leave you to it.\" I replace the phone in the cradle and give attention to my mistress. \"You heard it all?\"</p><p>\"Yes. We knew it was a possibility, but I still regret it.\" She stalks into the room wearing snug jeans and a tight sweater. \"Should we start placing bets on how long the hunt lasts? I have a feeling it's not going to go the whole week.\"</p><p>\"You may be right.\"</p><p>\"Paul hasn't come out yet, right?\"</p><p>\"Not to my knowledge.\"</p><p>\"Fine. I'm going to go see him and get him back in the game.\"</p><p>And with that parting remark, she sashays down the hall past the conference room to the bolted door farther along the hallway. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Paul</p><p>The locked door swings inward to reveal the redheaded temptress. The scent of her entices and beguiles at the same time. She is not my mate, but she would be suitable for a snack. Pushing my hungry body upright on the twin sized bed, I focus my attention on the black fuzz covering her neck. What is it and why is it blocking the slow pulse I sense beneath her skin?</p><p>\"Paul! Snap out of it or I'm going to slap you.\"</p><p>The voice holds a note of command I cannot ignore. My body freezes in place while I struggle to make it do as I wish-to leap upon the curvy one and drink to my heart's content.</p> <p>Smack!</p><p>My head whips to the side and the force of the blow carries me to the wall at the head of the mattress.</p><p>\"Paul. Look at me.\"</p><p>Cool fingers rest gently against the side of my face and turn me slowly to stare into emerald-green eyes. The hunger recedes and my vision clears. A calming sense washes through my limbs and tucks the hunger back into its weak-walled cage. The image before me re-forms and I'm faced with my old boss, Vivian-the one who hired me and brought me to Alaska all those years ago.</p><p>\"Vivian? What happened?\"</p> <p>She releases my face and steps back a bit. \"Nothing, Paul. You did nothing wrong. You're safe here in the basement. Still getting your legs under you, so to speak.\"</p><p>Fear clutches me as the memories come raging back. \"My family? Are they okay?\"</p><p>The bed dips as Vivian takes a seat next to me. \"Shush-they're fine, Paul. You haven't been home since before your shift in the kitchen yesterday.\" Her hand runs up and down my back soothingly. \"You're okay and so are they.\"</p><p>\"How much longer will I be like this, Vivian? When will I be able to sleep at home again?\"</p><p>\"I can't answer that. But, I can tell you you're doing great.\"</p><p>\"Really?\" I bet she's lying just to make me feel better.</p> <p>\"Let's look at this another way-have you killed anyone yet?\"</p><p>A girly gasp escapes my lips before I can stop it. \"No!\"</p><p>\"Have you drained anyone to near death? Or beaten anyone in an uncontrollable rage?\"</p><p>I see where she's going with this and I feel kind of sheepish at my initial outburst. \"No,\" I say, pulling my shoulders back and sitting a little taller.</p><p>\"Has the hunger overtaken you so completely that you bit someone, unable to stop yourself?\"</p><p>I hesitate for a moment, because there were times I almost did...</p><p>\"Thinking about it doesn't count, mind you, actually doing it.\"</p><p>\"No.\"</p> <p>\"You're doing much better than I did.\"</p><p>The surprise coloring my voice is not forced, \"Really?\"</p><p>She throws her head back in a delicate, but somehow full-bellied laugh. \"Oh yeah! And how,\" she says, once she stops for a breath. \"It was not a good point in my life. I was filled with rage and finally had the strength to do something about it.\" Her composure comes back and she stares straight ahead at the wall, rather than at me. \"Trust me, you're doing better than fine.\"</p><p>\"I miss Bunny and the kids.\"</p><p>\"You see them every day, right?\"</p><p>\"Yeah, but not being in the house with them day in and day out makes a huge difference.\"</p><p>\"Would you rather be dead, Paul?\"</p><p>There's a stillness to my boss now. I have a feeling how I answer this could be very important to my continued well-being.</p><p>\"At times, I miss my old way of life. I have no idea what the future holds. Cooking is hard. I can't seem to do anything right. Every human who used to be my friend now smells like a walking buffet.\" I let out a deep sigh I hadn't known I held in me. \"But, no. It's better than being dead.\"</p><p>She thumps me hard on the back and stands. \"That's what you need to keep in mind. Dead is gone. There is no coming back from it-just maybe another life waiting for you; one complete with no memories and an entirely new beginning. That is, if the whole reincarnation thing is real and not just some hookam fluke.\" She turns to me with a small smile, \"But we'll never know for sure will we?\"</p><p>I don't know what I should be saying right now. If we were talking about food or the best pans to buy, then yeah, I'd have a lot to say. But metaphysical life after death stuff? It's not something I thought about much in my happy little raising-kids-and-working lifestyle before.</p><p>\"You need to feed, Paul. Let me call someone down.\" She turns to the phone next to the door-after all it's not a cell I'm in, just a really strong room for me to stay in if I were to flip out. That's a little comforting, but not much.</p><p>\"Can it be Michelle?\" I ask, hope ringing in my tone.</p><p>She turns back with the phone held next to her ear. \"Are you for real? Like I'm going to send you a delectable blond?\" She shakes her head and turns back to the phone, \"I don't think you and Bunny have worked out you being with other women, have you?\" Before I have a chance to answer her, the line is picked up on the other end. \"Tommy? What male is next on the donor list? Uh-huh. Okay. Send Bob to my suite please.\"</p><p>She hangs up and once again the weight of her piercing eyes skewers me in place. \"Well?\" she asks while raising one eyebrow.</p><p>\"Um, no. We haven't discussed me feeding from a woman yet.\"</p><p>\"Then you'll be keeping your dick in your pants when you eat until you do clear it up with her. I'll be damned if I let you cheat on the mother of your children on my watch.\"</p><p>\"It is possible for vampires to feed without sex, you know.\"</p><p>\"You're preaching to the choir here, mister. Do I need to remind you how old I am?\"</p><p>I look away, annoyed that she's right and still feeling slightly petulant that I don't get to lead the glamorous sex-filled lifestyle I thought was so common in being one of the undead.</p><p>She laughs again, and this time there's no mistaking she's laughing at me, but damn, I hoped I wasn't obvious in my thoughts.</p><p>You aren't, Paul. We are connected because I made you.</p><p>My head whips up and back to the statuesque woman before me. \"Did you just speak inside my head or did I imagine it?\"</p><p>She taps her finger to her mouth, drawing my attention to the fact that her lips are not moving. I've done it before, in times of need. You were too far gone to notice. You can speak back to me, if you concentrate.</p><p>I'm not sure exactly what she wants me to do. Is it like thinking, only with more oomph behind it? I look to her and her face remains blank, so obviously my question didn't get through. I gather myself, like I'm trying to bend a spoon with my mind as if I were a sideshow magician, but staring at her forehead instead. Is this how you do it?</p><p>Yes, but calm down. You look like you're going to crap your pants or bust a vein in your brain.</p><p>Her comment has the desired effect; I laugh and try again. Is it still working?</p><p>Yes, you've got it. To stop projecting, you picture a door closing between us and then you're safely in your own head alone.</p><p>I do as she instructs, feeling slightly stupid to be picturing a fake door closing, but she is the master, after all.</p><p>Yes, Paul. I am. You'd be wise to listen.</p><p>I picture a huge, steel-reinforced wooden gate from a castle entrance, slamming down in place, shaking the ground with its force.</p><p>\"Very good, Paul. You'll go far.\"</p><p>Vivian moves gracefully to sit at the table and chair set across from my slim bed. \"Do you have any questions so far about the change?\"</p><p>The first thing that pops into my mind is Yeah, when will I get to fuck my wife again? Thankfully, I have enough sense not to just blurt it out.</p><p>\"Oh, you don't have to worry, Paul. You fairly shouted it.\" At my horrified look, she laughs yet again. \"I'd have the same sentiment, so trust me I feel for you.\"</p><p>\"I'm s-s-orry about that. I thought the door was closed.\"</p><p>\"You'll get the hang of it the more you practice. You ingested over half my blood, much more than the mouthful the rest of the seethe takes. That kind of exchange, combined with the natural bond of maker, will be hard to overcome. It will diminish little by little over the years, but it evolved to be like this so I could keep track of you and any danger that might befall you.\"</p><p>\"Or danger to others around me, right?\"</p><p>She nods in agreement and a twinkle comes into her eyes. \"Do you think after a full feeding today, you might be ready to test yourself with Bunny naked?\"</p><p>\"Yes! What the hell kind of question is that? How many men would turn down the chance to sleep with their wife for the first time in two months?\"</p><p>She smiles a toothy, wicked grin at me, \"I doubt there'll be any sleeping going on.\"</p><p>A knock at the door interrupts us, which is good because I'd rather not talk to my boss about having sex with my wife. The mere thought of finally getting to see her luscious curves and hold her in my arms again is making my pants a tad bit tight.</p><p>Vivian opens the door to the broad, solid form of Bob from the ground crew. Thankfully, his bearded face and shy grin are just the ticket to deflate my growing enthusiasm.</p><p>\"Hey Bob, thanks for coming. I'm going to stay because Paul is still getting the hang of things and I don't want any issues.\"</p><p>\"No problem, boss. This place is cool; I never knew it was under the hotel.\" He turns eager eyes my way, \"Did you hear the news yet?\"</p><p>\"What's that?\" I say.</p><p>\"Stephanie told me I've been selected to come in as a taster for you during part of your shift.\"</p><p>Joy leaps inside me at the thought of cooking like I used to. Maybe I will get more parts of my old life back than I thought. \"That's great! I wish we'd thought of it sooner.\"</p><p>\"Rafe mentioned it to Stephanie and I passed her on my way here. I'm pretty stoked to earn the overtime, too.\" He approaches me on the bed and... things get a little funny.</p><p>I've never thought about Bob in a sexual way, or any guy for that matter, but the recent good news-getting to make love to my wife and assigned help in the kitchen-has made me slightly aroused again. It could also be that he smells really tasty. Like steak, mashed potatoes, green beans, and peach cobbler for dessert all rolled into one. My canines descend. I have to hold myself back from leaping on him, tearing his clothes off, and pinning him down...</p><p>To drink his blood.</p><p>Obviously.</p><p>\"Bob, roll up your left sleeve,\" Vivian says.</p><p>\"Huh? Oh, from the wrist. Okay, boss.\"</p><p>Relief pours through me and I don't risk looking up at Vivian. I'm not sure if she knows of the conflictions coursing through me right now, but I'd prefer to deny any homosexual sparks and lock them away deep.</p><p>Bob offers his pale wrist to me, and a waft of lye soap reaches up to tickle my nostrils. The steak meal scent lingers more on my palate, almost like I can taste him without breaking his skin. I take his wrist in both hands and lower my head.</p><p>The pulsations under the skin beat his excitement, tempting me to bite savagely and drink my fill. A coolness enters my brain and clarity rushes back before I sink my fangs into his flesh.</p><p>A small sound escapes Bob as I latch on and start to draw his life force into my mouth. The first swallow goes down smoothly, soothing the beast within, granting me a temporary respite from its grasping claws. Bob's moans turn slightly sexual in nature and his body relaxes back against the wall.</p><p>At this point, his whole mind opens to me like a book, I can shift through to take, or change, what I wish. The craving to feed is so strong, I spare no time to rummage through his fascinating mind. Holding back the inner animal, the one encouraging me to keep drinking and not stop, takes all of my concentration.</p><p>The exquisite taste entices me to continue, but the calmness I felt when Vivian first entered the room settles back over my emotions, helping me to remain myself through the feeding.</p><p>\"That's enough, Paul,\" Vivian says.</p><p>With reluctance, I let go, but not before my tongue slips out to remove every last trace of red and seal the small punctures.</p><p>\"Very well done. Bob? Can you stand?\"</p><p>\"Yeah, in a second. Damn that felt good.\"</p><p>Vivian approaches the bed, extending the large man a helping hand to stand. \"Alley-oop. Let's get you upstairs and you can rest on my couch.\"</p><p>Bob nods his agreement and slings an arm around the woman's slight frame.</p><p>In case the topic comes up later, he'll think this happened upstairs in my living room, okay? She says to me.</p><p>Smart idea. Okay.</p><p>As she moves effortlessly to the door, she calls back over her shoulder, \"Call Bunny now. I'm giving you a few hours-but no biting. I'll be down here listening if you get carried away. And I will beat your ass, so don't mess this up.\"</p><p>Satiation fills me on the basic need of food, and my body surges to respond with the promise of the next need being fulfilled. \"Yes, ma'am!\"</p><p>I whip out a salute she doesn't see and scramble to the phone to call my wife. The blood pounds to my cock in a screaming rush and I think I may have to jerk off before she gets here so I don't disappoint her. The phone rings and the love of my life picks up. \"Bunny, come to the boss's apartment in the main building, quick. Vivian says I'm finally ready to be alone with you.\"</p><p>\"Yee-haw, cowboy! I'll call Debi to come stay with the kids and be there as fast as I can!\" Her excited squeal as she hangs up the phone is more than enough to take me over the edge. I unzip my fly to occupy the time and prepare for her arrival. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Jonathan</p><p>My laughter, over some comment from Drew, dies when Vivian comes down the hall with Bob draped over her shoulder. \"Is he okay?\"</p><p>Bob seems to catch himself leaning on a woman, his manliness kicks in, and he straightens, pulling away. \"I'm fine, just had some trouble gaining my feet at first.\"</p><p>Vivian turns her gorgeous green eyes on the man and says clearly, \"You're going to go up and lay down to rest on our living room couch for a bit, you will not remember being in the basement.\"</p> <p>\"No problem,\" Bob says and heads up the stairs.</p><p>\"What's going on?\" I ask.</p><p>\"Paul needed some alone time, and blood, after the scene in the cabin. He's so young I was impressed he didn't lick the walls when we were there.\" The look on my face must be pure disgust, because she shrugs and continues. \"Hey, don't judge. I bet when you were a new wolf you needed help to make sure you didn't eat your neighbors.\"</p><p>Her observation may be true, but I don't have to admit it. She smiles one of her all-knowing smiles at me. I can't help but wonder if she's reading my mind right now and, of course, already knows just how bad I was when I first changed. Sneaky bitch.</p><p>She walks over to Drew's position near the map and glances down.</p> <p>I cringe inwardly, waiting for her anger. I never know what she knows. She doesn't look my way, so it's a safe bet she wasn't in my head. This mind-to-mind shit is freaking me out a bit. I need to learn how to build some walls to protect my thoughts all the time.</p><p>Maybe the doctor's daughter, Diane, will be able to give me some advice. I heard she practices some of the local witchcraft, among other things. I can't deny the existence of magic, even if I can't see it like I can shifters and vampires. Hell, when I was in college I would have said all of it was crap.</p><p>\"You're having way too much fun with the map aren't you, Drew?\" Vivian asks while reaching out to pick up an eraser with the name Stan scrawled across it.</p><p>\"I prefer to keep track of them using a live visual, rather than the computer screen,\" he says. \"And I thought this was better than the little Army soldiers Asa suggested.\"</p><p>\"Now that would have been a hoot,\" I say.</p><p>Vivian tilts her head my way, looking at me where I'm leaning against the wall on the far right of the L-shaped desk. She stares and really sees me for the first time since she came into the room. Before I can blink, she's in front of me, tilting my face to the side.</p> <p>\"What happened to you?\" Her voice sounds calm. A deathly type of calm, if you ask me.</p><p>\"Umm... I had an altercation with Emiko.\"</p><p>\"Report.\"</p><p>I glance away, trying to break my face from her hold, but she turns me back, forcing me to stare directly into her eyes. \"Tell me everything.\"</p><p>Her beauty excites and scares me all at the same time-it's always the same. I'm torn between wanting to lick her head to toe, beg at her feet for love, or run screaming into the woods. Not a good combination most days, but one I'm addicted to nonetheless. She just simply is.</p><p>\"I broke from the pack after a few hours. I'd had enough of running with them and knew I should be heading back to talk to you about investigating Melvyn's death. I sensed I was being followed back from the west end of the property and detoured to the bowling alley to change back in case I needed to confront my tail.\" I take a deep breath and relax into her hold. Her grip loosens until she's gently caressing the side of my face, like a lover after a sweaty romp. \"It was Emiko and she attacked me. She was determined to have some wolf blood and I couldn't get her to see reason.\"</p><p>Vivian releases my face, leaning in to sniff near my neck. The lack of emotion on her face only confirms what I knew in the bowling alley: if Emiko had bitten me, she'd be dead with no one ever knowing the truth behind the allegations in Argentina or who may be behind the orchestration on the Tribunal. Light hands rest on my shoulders before moving slowly to my back.</p><p>Vivian presses herself to me in a soft hug, barely skimming the front of my body while leaning in to whisper, \"You are mine.\" The possessiveness in her tone is surprising; this is a side she doesn't normally share with me. \"If she, or anyone, touches you-I will kill them. You know that, right?\"</p> <p>The hair on my body stands at attention, the nearness of the object of my desire is almost more than I can handle. I want so badly to wrap myself around her and rub in her scent. But I know I can't. She may be my pack, but she is not my lover. Lingering traces of Rafe cling to her skin.</p><p>A shaky breath leaves me as she steps back, taking her delectable fragrance away as well. \"Yes, I know.\"</p><p>Her head tilts curiously to the side, \"How did you elude her?\"</p><p>\"Asa.\"</p><p>Her features sharpen a bit and close down at his name. I wonder what brought the reaction on. \"Go on.\"</p><p>\"He came in when she had me pinned, and trust me, no matter what I said, she wasn't going to stop. It was like she didn't hear or care.\"</p><p>\"She could have an old addiction she's recovering from. It happens a lot.\"</p><p>Which I knew well, it was one of the reasons I steered clear of the main building as much as possible.</p><p>\"Does this put her back on as a suspect with Melvyn?\" Drew asks.</p><p>\"I don't think so, but we'll discuss it with the whole group.\" Another thought occurs to her and she looks me square in the face again. \"Are you telling me Asa beat her in a fair fight?\"</p><p>\"Umm... no, not exactly.\"</p><p>She whirls and turns away, moving to sit in a chair in front of the monitors. Raising one elegant eyebrow, she silently urges me to keep going.</p><p>\"They fought. He told me to run while he took a beating. I hid, in case things went south for him and he needed help, but she had other ideas.\" I break away from her gaze and look over to Drew. He's listening, but not jumping in, which is good. \"She toyed with him for a while and then drank from him instead.\"</p><p>My look away must have been my \"tell\" because she doesn't let the subject drop. \"You're not sharing everything.\"</p><p>Know-it-all vamp. Damn, is she in my head again? I sneak a look back at her, but again, her expression reveals nothing. \"She forced him to have sex, but after the first minute or so I don't think it was forced anymore.\"</p><p>Her eyes seem to darken to the deep green of pines, \"Rape is rape. Men can't help their body's natural reaction to stimulus.\" She crushes the chair arms in a tight grip; the plastic gives in a resounding crack before she lets go. \"Where is he now?\"</p><p>\"Rafe gave him an assignment to track her on the property and he's following through.\"</p><p>She grunts and stands. \"Fine. I'll talk to him later.\" Vivian begins her customary angry pacing back and forth in the tight area. It's one of the signs she's trying to regain control of her inner demons and if it works, then hey, I sure as hell don't plan to stop her.</p><p>\"We need to get a handle on the slaughter of the loner wolf in cabin two before the hunters come back to refuel. They'll sniff out his death, as well as Bebe's, on their return and I bet their tempers will be high.\" She stops to pin me with her gaze. \"Jon, you need to head out and investigate the area surrounding the cabin and the hotel before they tromp through all the scent trails, okay?\"</p><p>\"Your wish is my command, oh curvy-sexy-one.\"</p><p>\"Drew-you rustle up the locations of the rest of the hunters via the GPS in their phones and call me with a report.\"</p><p>\"Yes, master,\" Drew replies. Kind of freaks me out when he calls her that. I shoot him a look that asks what are you, a dork and he ignores me with dead eyes.</p><p>She storms up the stairs, almost flying in her pent-up rage and energy.</p><p>\"Does she scare you sometimes, too?\" I ask.</p><p>He shakes his head and scoots his chair back to the monitors, pushing the broken one out of his way. \"Why do you think I call her 'master'? For shits-n-giggles?\"</p><p>Can't argue with that, so I gather my hunting coat and head up to the apartment. Vivian is already gone; the scent of her lingers in the kitchen by the table where Rafe sits alone. \"Can I change here and you'll open the door for me? Viv wants me scouting for clues and my wolf nose will do the job better.\"</p><p>\"Sure thing, man. You can use the office.\"</p><p>I turn to the broken door in the hall, \"What happened here?\"</p><p>\"Nothing you need to worry about.\"</p><p>Fucking prick. \"Okay.\"</p><p>I head in and strip, tossing my clothes on the leather couch. With a flexing of will I call my beast. A spine-tingling rush of energy starts the change rolling over me, bowing my spine, forcing me to the floor. Fur ripples across my skin and the pain of my bones realigning feels excruciating, but the process ends quickly.</p><p>The recent sexual activities in the room from the married couple come crashing into my sensitive senses with the subtlety of a beer burp at frat party. Vivian's essence is heavy in the room, its perfection marred only by the tainted human she's married to. I lower my nose to the Persian rug and my lip peels back from my teeth in derision.</p><p>She should be mine!</p><p>A growl sounds deep in my chest, rumbling to the surface and breaking the silence in the room. The thought comes from my wolf half, and I struggle to maintain control and push the basic alpha tendencies deep inside. They don't apply here and my inner wolf still has trouble accepting it.</p><p>Some day soon he'll run free with his mate, but that mate will never be the sultry redheaded vamp.</p><p>I pad quietly into the kitchen and use every ounce of strength within me not to bite the son-of-a-bitch at the table. On a human level he's okay enough, but he isn't a wolf and my instincts call out that he shouldn't be a pack member and above me in rank as well. The desire to make him submit and show me his throat in surrender almost overwhelms my inner need to follow Vivian's requests... but in the end, I am victor and I don't spare Rafe a second glance as I head for the door.</p><p>\"That was quick. Let me get the door.\"</p><p>I step back as the large man opens the exit for me, bolting past him and away from the smells of their recent lovemaking as fast as I can. The blackness of the night isn't nearly as deep here as it is out at my cabin. The landscaping lights show the first glimmer of an artificial dawn, and decorative twinkling lights festoon the pergolas and shrubbery throughout the hot tub area.</p><p>My long legs and four paws eat up the distance to cabin number two, and in a moment, I'm standing outside where the seethe gathered a few hours ago. After a few minutes, I pick out an undead scent that doesn't match anyone in our group who came to investigate. Following the trail, I'm led back the way I came.</p><p>A meandering path leads me to one of the tucked-away spas, farthest from any of the doors in the west and north wings, and used the least by guests and employees for this reason. The trail ends at the tub itself. Whether the killer jumped in to wash the blood off or not can't be determined until the lid is lifted and the water tested.</p><p>Do I change here and check by lifting the lid in my human form or do I go inside, change and come back fully clothed to do the job? Nose to the ground, I decide to look for the trail leading from the tub back to one of the doors before deciding.</p><p>A bromine-covered vampire scent leads away from the hot tub and to an exit at the end of the north wing. The entrance requires a key card to get in. The vampire must not have had one, because the scent leads around the north wing, through the stone garden to the pool entrance in the east wing-the entrance where the lock has been disabled because it's set up as the designated spot for the hunters to enter and exit through.</p><p>I've sensed this vampire before, but I can't place a face to him or her. You can bet I'll know it when I run into them again. Nose to the ground, I follow the fading trail.</p><p>A blur of motion through the two-story insulated glass of the pool wing draws my eye. A flash of copper hair and toned white arms cut the surface of the water in a one-man race down the length of the pool. Vivian looks to be burning off some of her anger, which is a good thing, I know.</p><p>Her hourglass body rises from the surface at the end of the lap to stand next to the water. She reaches for a towel and I have a moment to admire her naked form before she covers it with a towel. A whine escapes me, the wolf wanting to be near his pack-mate and making himself heard. Her head whips around to the glass wall and I bolt into the darkness.</p><p>Not wanting to face Rafe again, or the sex scene in the office, I head back to my cabin to get fresh clothes. There is much to report to the loving couple. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Vivian</p><p>The flash of fur reveals one of the wolves stood outside watching while I swam. A gentle reach of my mind confirms who: Jon.</p><p>We need to find him a mate and fast. The seven years he's been here are starting to take their toll. This past winter he tried ramping up the sexual pheromone levels he sends out, in a last-ditch effort to try and seduce both of us. Its been hard, each of us wanting to give in to Jon's call and invite him into our bed.</p><p>I love the werewolf and want him, but I will not risk my relationship with Rafe for anyone. Rafe is not comfortable with the emotions Jon stirs up and has pleaded with me time and again to find the sexy Were a mate. The time has come. If I don't do it soon, I risk hurting Jon beyond repair. Or ripping his clothes off and mounting him like a dog in heat.</p> <p>Which, come to think of it, sounds like a lot of fun, so I know I'm in trouble.</p><p>I finish drying off and go to the locker room to put on some yoga clothes. I knew with the hunters out, and the early hour, our human guests would not be around and it was safe to swim au natural, like I prefer.</p><p>The birds remain in the safety of the large potted palms, having done their dive-bomb on me when I first arrived to enjoy the water.</p><p>\"Braaack! Oh! That's it Dria, fuck me hard, you randy bitch!\"</p><p>\"Yeah, keep it up pea-brain. You may sound like Rafe now, but those phrases won't do you any good when I set you free this spring.\"</p> <p>\"Suck me dry!\"</p><p>Geez, he sounds awful. I'll have to have another talk with Rafe about Mikey, the winged, green menace. I want the birds out and can't understand why the guests all like the Amazon parrots. Oh wait, maybe it's because I'm the only one they attack?</p><p>I ignore the bird's last comment, secretly relieved no one is here to witness his latest learned phrase. That will be the last time we make love in this room, that's for damned sure.</p><p>The lower temperature of the lobby hits me like a blast of air-conditioning after the pleasant eighty-five degrees of the east wing. Miranda sits at the front desk. Tommy's shift ended at seven, so she hasn't been here long.</p><p>\"Any messages for me?\" I ask.</p><p>\"Nope.\"</p> <p>\"Okay, I'll be in the gym.\"</p><p>I head to the real gym, not the play-gym up on the third floor. That one is equipped more for sexual fun than working out, although, both activities do lead to sweating if done with enough gusto. Besides the dungeon rooms being used by Liam and his mate, I doubt the theme rooms will get much use this week. Wonder if I should let the employees have a turn in them for a break. After all, with the added curfews in place during the hunt, they could use a bit of extra fun.</p><p>Opening the door in the north wing to the gym, I push inside with the only goal in mind to erase the past few hours from my mind. A buzzing washes over my skin, alerting me to the presence of another undead in the room. A slight form, dressed all in white, appears hunched, rather than relaxed, in front of my eternal flame focus. The pale, olive-skinned man, who accompanied Sanji, looks deep in thought.</p><p>The door shuts behind me, with an audible whoosh of air, and breaks into Vikram's peace. He starts slightly and turns to face me.</p><p>\"So sorry, I didn't mean to disturb you,\" I say.</p><p>\"Hmph. Damage is done. I must start my chants from the beginning.\"</p><p>Arrogant jerk. It's not like it's a church, for crying out loud. Oh and wait, it is my freakin' inn. Best to keep my nastiness inside. Man, I do need to calm down. The swim didn't do as much as I'd hoped.</p><p>\"I'll leave you in peace and place a 'Do Not Disturb sign on the door.\"</p> <p>He ignores me. I rifle through the magazine basket by the entrance, looking for the sign Miranda made up one day, after she walked in on Rafe and me using the weight bench inappropriately. I can't find it and give up searching before I annoy our guest any longer with my scrounging. A heavy sigh reaches me as I leave. Sounds like I bugged him despite my best intentions.</p><p>I cross the hall to the dojo, debating on working out with some weapons before returning to my suite. Hopefully, Jon will be back with some news soon and maybe Drew will have a report. I glance at my watch. It's seven-thirty in the morning and the hunters have been out since ten last night. They're way past due for needing to come in and heat up. Sounds like the one-upmanship has already started, with none of them willing to come in until another breaks.</p><p>The peace and calm of the sparring room wraps around me as I enter. Well-oiled, blunt, wooden weapons glisten from their spots on the wall. Grabbing a hardwood bo staff, I head to the middle of the rubber-matted space. The end of the staff rests on the floor, near my foot, while I stretch into a standing mountain pose.</p><p>Running through a series of movements, in ever-increasing speed, helps to loosen my muscles and drive some on the tension out. The staff thrusts forward in what would be a blow to the chest or trachea of an opponent, then I spin it one hundred and eighty degrees for the opposite end to connect in a secondary hit to an enemy's head.</p><p>Solidly planting the leading end of the weapon into the floor, I thrust myself into the air, mimicking a pole-vaulter over a high bar. A soft touch to my mind brings me whirling back to the door, staff raised in a defensive posture.</p><p>\"Looks like you could use a good thrashing,\" Rafe says from his spot, casually leaning against the doorframe. He's dressed in a tight t-shirt that hugs every curve of his wide, sculpted chest and a pair of tiny running shorts.</p><p>I raise one eyebrow at his ensemble. Normally he wears baggy clothes to spar, so I'm wondering at his revealing choices. \"You up for doling one out?\" I ask.</p><p>He pushes away from the door and saunters toward me. His solid thighs flex with each movement, effectively distracting me from my thoughts of a mock fight. Rafe walks past me, much to my surprise, and grabs a matching bo staff from the weapons rack. I stare a little too long at his tight, well-rounded ass, and almost miss the quiet calming of his thought.</p><p>In a blur of motion, my husband whips his staff out, while still faced away, and knocks my own staff from my hands. A thump hits me on the side of the head, spinning me the opposite direction of my staff. Pain spikes in my skull and quickly dies. I turn back the way I was facing to see my husband in a defensive crouch.</p><p>\"Wake up, Dria. Or I'm going to trounce you good.\"</p><p>My pulse picks up and I can't tell if it's from the excitement of the challenge or a response to taking the first hit. And I don't care. The increased hammering in my chest reminds me I didn't die with my turning five centuries ago, but evolved into something more.</p><p>I take a quick double-step and throw myself into the air, executing a front flip in an attempt to avoid my lover's quick offensive strike. I scoop up my staff and face one of the best fighters I've ever had the joy to practice with.</p><p>My God, he's beautiful to watch. The precision and placement of not only his feet for a move, but his stance and rippling strength behind each slice or thrust through the air, is akin to a kind of poetry of the body. My gaze lingers a little too long and Rafe comes at me again. In a flurry of strike and counter-strikes we dance around the room, our heavy breathing echoing back in the vast space.</p><p>Within minutes, Rafe's sweat permeates the air. His color is high and a sheen of wetness covers his exposed skin. The strong scent of his natural muskiness fills my head and distracts me from moving in for a body blow. He removes one hand from his weapon and reaches up to rip the t-shirt from his body.</p><p>The tearing of the fabric draws my eyes to his lightly-haired chest and my canines start to elongate with my increasing desire. The warmth from my exertions has not created the same sweat response as it has in him, but it makes me aware of all of my body parts, especially the ones longing to writhe against all the hard muscle on display.</p><p>Rafe's face sets as he advances on me. His seriousness snaps me out of the moment, but not fast enough. After a sweep to my legs, I'm airborne for a split second and then crash down onto the mat to face the ceiling.</p><p>\"You're allowing your base needs to distract you,\" he pants from above me.</p><p>\"Well, what do you expect when you start ripping your clothes off?\"</p><p>He smiles and locks eyes with me as the end of his staff comes sailing down at my face. I roll to the side and push up off the ground to regain my stance.</p><p>\"I was taught to use everything against an opponent.\"</p><p>Since I was the one who taught him the strategy, I can't exactly complain. He's landed quite a few blows on me this session, and while none of them caused me damage, they have made me more aware of my lack of concentration.</p><p>A smack with the length of his bo against my shoulder pushes me up against the room's back wall. In a quick move, Rafe pins his weapon horizontally across my chest, holding me in place. He presses his body up against mine, showing me quite clearly he is not unaffected sexually by our sparring either.</p><p>\"Is this what you want?\" he asks in a soft voice. A mewl deep in my throat sounds at the feel of his hardness bearing into me. \"Or is this what you need?\" He holds the staff to my chest with one hand and drops his other to rub against the moist juncture between my thighs. \"Is the pretty vamp randy?\"</p><p>His teasing hand pulls away and his knee launches up to plant a solid hit to my middle. While the pain reels through me, Rafe steps back and lands a hard open-handed smack to my face.</p><p>\"Get in the game! You need to focus!\"</p><p>The shock coursing through me settles in the pit of my stomach. He's right. While we do have sparring sessions that often turn into lovemaking trysts here on the rubber mats, this is not the time for such an encounter. I need to work out my anger and tension. I won't be able to do so if I keep lusting after my hot husband.</p><p>Geez, it's not like I didn't just make love to him a few hours ago. I allow my inner anger to come to the front, not something I normally do. Asa killing Joanna. Melvyn murdered before the hunt starts. Emiko almost feeding from Jon and semi-raping Asa. Bebe ripped apart by the rogue and another hunter draining her dry. The seemingly total loss of control in under twelve hours.</p><p>I push off the wall, dropping my weapon, and attack the man in front of me with bare hands. Punches to the head and body, kicks to his torso and legs, all rapid-fire and most not landing on target. My opponent matches my every move, almost anticipating how I'll strike next.</p><p>Frustration fuels my movements, instinct and years of practice taking over, rather than a carefully planned attack. Grunts of pain and exhalations of breath result, enticing me to continue. Blows to my head send sparks flying through my mind, but don't slow me down.</p><p>\"Is that all you've got?\" Rafe yells, while grabbing a knife hanging from a sheath mounted to the wall.</p><p>His longer reach is now accentuated by the blade-forcing me to alter my attack and weave around this new threat. My focus narrows down to the pulse beating at his throat. It calls to me on a deeper level and no matter my perceived danger, I'm aware of the blood coursing under the surface of his skin.</p><p>Hot and thick - the most perfect elixir on the planet.</p><p>A ribbon of pain down my left arm jolts me out the intense longing and draws my eye to the red on his knife. He raises the edge to his mouth and licks off my blood, staring at my face for a sign to betray my next move.</p><p>\"Better. You're allowing the anger out. Don't let desire redirect you yet. You need this.\" With that last comment, he throws the knife at my heart.</p><p>I dodge to the side and it sails past me. As I regain my stance to advance, multiple glints of metal come racing at my torso-he's picked up a bag of throwing stars and is doing his damnedest to sink one into me.</p><p>\"Hey!\" I croak. \"Are those silver?\"</p><p>\"Don't worry. They won't hurt unless they hit you.\" He grins in a sick kind of way and launches the rest in quick succession.</p><p>He knows I can only spar really well when there is some actual danger present, and I have been hurt before when we practice. True fighting involves pain, and if your sparring doesn't hold some hint, then you will never know how to work through the pain and focus.</p><p>Liquid fire spreads across my side as one of the blades skims through my shirt and causes a flesh wound. \"Dammit!\"</p><p>\"Tsk, tsk... Better get a move on, babe.\"</p><p>As the blood trickles down my side to soak the waistband of my pants, I force a bit of my will to the wound. Normally an injury will heal on its own pretty fast, but one made from silver either requires more time or a conscious effort on the vamp's part to push life energy to the damage.</p><p>\"You will repay in kind,\" I whisper as I advance on him, feeling the stitch in my side ease, and for the first time deciding to attack with determination.</p><p>The next few minutes become a blur of cat and mouse, with Rafe retreating and attacking when an opportunity presents itself. Sweat now drips freely from his face and the entire room reeks of vampire blood and human musk. At some point, I unconsciously switched from fighting to hunting and I'm now stalking my tiring prey around the room.</p><p>Rafe hesitates in his step, deciding to change his direction at the last moment. I sweep my leg out to take him down. A resounding thump reverberates through the floor when his thick form hits, cascading up my planted leg like a trumpet blast of victory on a noisy battlefield.</p><p>I'm on him in an instant, straddling his wide, flat waist and pinning his head to the side with a firm hand to his forehead. I sink my fangs into the pounding pulse at his neck and drink down the spoils of my win. A sharp tang coats my mouth as the rich, full flavor of his life pours down my throat.</p><p>\"Good move. I was tiring anyway,\" he rasps.</p><p>I pull back, only wanting to take a taste and not drain too much of his strength, but it's hard. I want to keep going and rip his tiny shorts off. Licking the puncture holes to help heal them, I sigh and collapse against his chest.</p><p>\"Can I convince you to get naked and continue our workout?\" I ask.</p><p>He runs his hands up my bloody t-shirt to cup my full breasts through my athletic bra. \"I don't need much convincing,\" he replies while thrusting up with his hips to show me he's ready.</p><p>The phone I always have clipped to me starts to ring. We both groan, knowing our interlude will have to wait. I push forward and grind my crotch over his thick cock. \"Damn, and you riled me up good.\"</p><p>His hands lift me off, setting me to the side. \"That was the point. But duty calls. You going to answer it?\"</p><p>I grab the ringing bit of plastic, and flip it open.</p><p>\"Yes?\"</p><p>\"One of the hunters, Stephen, has just come back in from the cold.\" Miranda informs me. \"And he's hungry.\"</p><p>\"Direct him to the dining room. I'll be there in a moment.\" We click off and I turn back to my lover. \"Meet you in our suite in a few?\"</p><p>His eyes smolder with pent up desire. \"Yup. I'll be there.\"</p><p>Smiling and less tense, I head to the dining room to greet Stephen.</p><p>\"Is O-positive, okay?\" I ask while fishing a blood bag out of the specialized fridge.</p><p>\"No preference,\" answers the slight, black-eyed vampire with the blank expression. \"I've never experienced such cold in my entire existence.\" A shiver wracks his frame.</p><p>Such a lingering physical reaction speaks volumes, and I can tell by the chemical scent wafting off him that he's come from the much warmer east wing. From his damp hair, I'd guess he took a dip in the pool as well.</p><p>I heat up his sustenance and mix it in a large insulated coffee mug with a generous portion of coffee. \"Here,\" I say, handing him the lidded container. \"Why don't you go back to the pool and slip into the sauna while enjoying this? It will bring your core temp up much faster than blood alone.\"</p><p>\"Yeah, in a minute. Am I the first one back?\"</p><p>I hide a smile at what is, obviously, a point of pride amongst the undead. \"The others are on their way, difference of only a few minutes.\"</p><p>\"Nice place you've got here. I'm sorry I didn't come for a purely pleasure visit.\"</p><p>Stephanie, one of our chefs, stops by his table to enquire if he would like anything else and he eyes her with hunger.</p><p>\"No thanks, Stephanie,\" I say, not liking the look in the crazy bastard's eye. \"Take a twenty minute break and leave the kitchen.\" She nods and scurries off. I'd rather have the place free of temptation when the exhausted vampires come in to congregate.</p><p>He grins a sick little smile at me; aware I've taken her out of his reach on purpose. \"Guess she's not on the menu?\"</p><p>I allow a fraction of my power to come to the surface, and push it out at the dark-haired, skinny killer. \"No, she's not. And you'd do best to remember that.\"</p><p>Stephen waves a hand in the air and changes his demeanor in an instant. Calm, cool and collected appear etched into his expression and look equally personified in the relaxed drape of his frame in the chair. \"I'd never want to end this little party sooner than is absolutely necessary.\"</p><p>He takes a long sip from his mug, making disgusting slurping sounds. I rein my power back in, unsure if I made my point and make a mental note to keep an eye on him.</p><p>\"You said the sauna would help warm me up?\"</p><p>I nod. \"Yes, ten or fifteen minutes should do the trick. You'll find the entrance near the changing rooms.\"</p><p>With a grunt, Stephen rises and shuffles off in the indicated direction. \"Fucking cold.\"</p><p>Odd man, but then all of the hunters seem strange. Did they think this hunt would be a piece of cake? Since no more hunters have come in yet, I sneak into our suite in the hopes of picking up with Rafe where we left off.</p><p>Jon lounges at our kitchen table and my husband is nowhere to be seen. A quick mental scan finds him in our bedroom, getting dressed. Damn work. I'm not happy when it interrupts sex.</p><p>\"Hey, Jon. What do you need?\"</p><p>The pain in the werewolf's eyes crushes part of my heart. I'd do anything to save him hurt, but not at the expense of harming my husband. \"Rafe called me when the first hunter came back in to warm up. The mean-looking, skinny dude in the dining room doesn't match the scent of Melvyn's killer.\"</p><p>A sigh escapes me. \"Yeah, that would have been too easy.\"</p><p>Rafe comes in wearing jeans and a turtleneck. The brief look he gives me shows his equal frustration at having to handle the hunters coming in right now. We seriously need a long vacation from the inn and all the cares of a seethe; preferably a trip with no clothing.</p><p>\"Jon told me what happened between Asa and Emiko and then the fledgling's subsequent clean up of Bebe's remains,\" he says. \"Don't you think his recent actions prove his loyalty to you?\"</p><p>\"I didn't doubt his loyalty. He's bound to me and unable to harm me. I'm not sure I trust his judgment when in a crisis.\"</p><p>Jon gets to his feet. \"The man put up a good fight and he did it to save me. I think his judgment in a split second was spot on. She acted like a Were-blood addict and could have easily drained me dry.\"</p><p>\"Which makes me wonder if she could have gone batty and drained Melvyn, too.\" Rafe says.</p><p>\"No, I already told you her scent wasn't in the cabin,\" grumbles the wolf. \"Why not assign me a useful task like hanging out in the dining room to see if the killer comes in?\" </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Rafe</p><p>\"As much as it pains me to admit,\" I say once the furry fucker shuts up, \"I agree with Jon. He has a smart suggestion and I think you can trust Asa to make good decisions.\" Dria's expression reveals some sexual frustration, which is clearly much better than her earlier deadly anger-I'm glad to see our sparring did her some good. \"Drew filled me in on Asa's latest field report.\"</p><p>\"And?\" my oh-so-patient wife demands.</p><p>\"Emiko tracks the hunters while they look for her. She's damn good and Asa thinks she knows he's watching her,\" I answer.</p> <p>\"I found a trail leading from Melvyn's cabin to the hot tubs and then to the pool wing,\" says Jon.</p><p>Vivian taps her nails on the table, which is a much less stressful habit than her angry pacing. \"So the killer came in the way the hunters have been instructed?\"</p><p>\"Yeah.\" Jon nods. \"Want to have Drew call the others in and bring them up to speed? Like I said, it would give me a chance to sniff out who may have killed the loner.\"</p><p>\"Alright, it's as good a plan as any,\" Dria replies.</p><p>My wife heads down to the basement as Jon and I depart for the dining room.</p> <p>Stan leans back in his chair, a cunning look on his face, staring off into the lobby. He sips casually from a cut-glass tumbler filled with blood. The sight is a little disconcerting; most of the guests drink from mugs or straight from a vein. I shake off my repugnance at his glass selection and put on my host face. \"How are you feeling, Stan?\"</p><p>The crazy bastard's gaze swings my way, making me glad I'm not Emiko. \"Not bad. This terrain is a challenge. Very hard to determine the criminal's whereabouts.\"</p><p>\"Weren't you paired with Stephen?\" I ask as Jon moves from behind me to the entrance near the lobby, positioning himself to scent the hunters as they trickle in.</p><p>\"Yes, I was. But the tiny bugger couldn't keep up and I left him about an hour ago.\"</p><p>Liam and Jet enter from the lobby, wrapped in huge terrycloth robes and big smiles on their faces.</p><p>\"Hot damn! I haven't felt this alive since we were last here,\" says the normally stoic Scotsman.</p> <p>Jet heads behind the counter, already familiar with where we keep the blood bags. \"And that's one hell of a battle axe you brought with you,\" the Asian vampire adds while loading the microwave with two pouches.</p><p>Sanji trails in while the two guzzle their meals mixed with coffee, the perennial vampire favorite. The petite Indian vampire has a rosy glow to her skin. The cold may have affected her, but she's ingested such a large amount of vampire blood from Bebe she appears content.</p><p>A smug smile forms on her face, \"Did you three hear about Bebe yet?\"</p><p>\"No,\" I say. \"I was waiting until everyone arrived to tell them.\"</p><p>Stan perks up, slamming the tilted chair back to the floor. He dabs blood from his mouth with a napkin. \"What happened to her?\"</p><p>\"She caught Emiko and they fought.\" Sanji stares out the window, serene as she recalls the memory. \"Unfortunately for her, but fortunately for me, Emiko won.\"</p><p>The others sit in silence a moment, whether from shock or out of respect, I'm not sure. I glance over at Jon to see what he thinks about the four undead in regard to Melvyn and he shakes his head. Crap. Could mean it was Bebe or Donald. Jon will have to venture out to where Asa cleaned up her body to rule her out.</p><p>\"We can't let this ex-enforcer get the best of us,\" Stan says quietly.</p> <p>\"What do you suggest?\" asks Jet. \"We do something other than what we have been doing-which is hunting her to the best of our abilities?\"</p><p>\"Is it truly the best you can do?\" comes his sociopathic response. \"Are you out there having fun or are you hunting to kill and drink her blood?\" A sneer forms on the man's good ol' boy features. \"You both sit there in your fluffy robes like you've just come from the showers after a hard squash match.\"</p><p>As the tension in the area rises, Jon wisely slips out of the room. It's never a good idea for a delectable werewolf to be too close when the shit hits the fan with angry vampires.</p><p>\"Hey now,\" I say in my most diplomatic and soothing tones, \"each person here came for their own reasons. Do you think it's wise to pick fights amongst yourselves or better to focus your energy on the prize?\"</p><p>Liam gives me a nod of respect. Jet picks up his mug, leaving with a parting shot to Stan, \"Shut up, you crazy fuck. I don't need to prove myself to you.\"</p><p>Sanji still sits calmly, with a cat-that-ate-the-canary grin on her face, obviously not affronted by the words of her fellow vampires. \"Where's my Vikram?\"</p><p>The possessive tones in her question rings clear; she really does treat him more like a bonded mate than a member of her seethe. \"Vivian saw him in the gym meditating and let him be,\" I say.</p><p>\"Then I shall do the same,\" she says in her clipped, old-fashioned accent. \"Perhaps I'll try relations with a human for a change of pace...\" and as she trails off she locks eyes with me.</p><p>Crap! Does she think I'd go for a roll in the hay just because she's feeling high on vampire blood and wants a human? \"Umm... er... ah...\"</p><p>Liam saves me from forming a coherent response. \"You touch him and our hostess won't be happy.\"</p><p>Sanji giggles, \"Look how uncomfortable he is... isn't it cute?\"</p><p>\"Oh, yes,\" Stan chimes in. \"I can see I'm surrounded by vicious killers eager to hunt one of their own. You people are pathetic.\" He rises from the table, takes his half-full glass with him, and ventures out into the lobby.</p><p>A commotion near the front doors brings me to my feet and I follow the innocuous- looking killer. Asa knocks the snow off his boots on the mat near the door and nods in my direction.</p><p>\"Any news?\" I ask. Much to my dismay, Sanji has trailed after me as well. Liam brings up the rear, so I don't think I'm in immediate danger of her trying to jump my bones.</p><p>\"I think another hunter is missing. Who has come in so far to warm up?\"</p><p>\"Missing?\" Stan booms from his perch on the sofa in the lobby's conversation area. \"How the fuck does a hunter go missing with a GPS?\" He waves one of the cell phones we handed out last night.</p><p>Asa digs in his outer coat pocket, producing a similar phone \"By dropping this in the snow. I found it near the employee apartments on the northern edge of the property.\"</p><p>By now, Jet has heard the conversation and joined the small group forming in the lobby. Stephen wanders in from the pool and watches the proceedings with interest.</p><p>\"Who hasn't come in yet?'\" Jet asks me.</p><p>\"None of the wolves or Donald.\"</p><p>Asa takes off his coat and hangs it on the wall. \"Did you tell them about Melvyn, boss?\"</p><p>Sanji's liquid tones draw all eyes to her. \"I don't remember a Melvyn in the theater at our briefing.\"</p><p>\"He's a wolf,\" I reply. \"And he was murdered right after the release of the hunters.\"</p><p>\"Murdered?\" Liam exclaims. \"Are you sure?\"</p><p>I look over to Jon who shakes his head and shrugs his shoulders; indicating he doesn't think the killer is among the vampires in the room. \"Oh yeah, there was no mistaking the blood bath.\"</p><p>Stephen takes a loud slurp from his mug, \"Why are we just hearing of this now?\"</p><p>\"We had to be sure it wasn't one of you,\" I say in my most diplomatic voice.</p><p>The good ol' boy vamp lumbers to his feet. \"What the fuck? You don't think Emiko did it, but one of us?\"</p><p>I raise my hands in a placating gesture as Asa crosses the room to stand by my side. \"Settle down.\" Jon pushes off the wall and moves near the front desk, directly to my left. \"We're not accusing you, but facts are facts. Emiko's scent was not at the scene.\"</p><p>A rustling above turns all faces upward. Coraline leans over the railing in the balcony loft space above the lobby. \"Trouble in Paradise?\" she asks with unmistakable humor in her tone. \"I see Alexandria's men forming a united front. So soon?\"</p><p>Dria strolls in from the dining room, pent up strength fairly boiling below her mental shields. \"What seems to be the problem?\" she asks, knowing full well all that's taken place in here the last few minutes. \"Did you all not pay to come up here and remove your civilized masks-to hunt with your true nature?\" She heads past me and walks over to the enraged vampire holding an empty crystal glass. \"Was there a part of you that thought this was going to be easy?\"</p><p>Stan shakes his head.</p><p>\"Then be advised: there are two killers on the property. One we know of and one we don't. Your numbers have already been cut by two-Bebe and Melvyn. Trust no one. Rely on your own skills... and you just may come out of this week alive.\"</p><p>With a dramatic flourish she turns back, throws me a wink only Asa and Jon can see, and tilts her head up at the blond looking down on us all. \"We promised excitement and adventure. We warned of death and danger. Now the rest is up to them.\"</p><p>She then aims her gaze at every hunter, pausing individually on each one-Sanji, Liam, Stephen, Jet and Stan, \"You can bow out and enjoy the rest of your week inside the inn, or you can warm up and head back out into the cold to match your wits against two killers. Which will it be?\"</p><p>As the vampires talk amongst themselves, slowly building the fire Dria started, Asa and I follow my wife's subtle head tilt to join her in the dining room.</p><p>\"Let me handle these guys,\" she says. \"I can get them back outside in a little bit and we can figure out what to do next.\"</p><p>Raised voices from the lobby bounce off the walls and the three-story-high lofted ceiling. Heated tones convey their passion and excitement over the recent updates. I shake my head at the sheer madness of this endeavor. Excited killers make me uneasy, go figure.</p><p>Turning to the shaved vamp I say, \"Asa, you need to find Emiko before the hunters do. See if she's the reason Donald is missing.\" I pass a hand tiredly over my face.</p><p>\"Darling,\" my wife says, \"go, get some rest. Even a couple of hours are better than nothing. Asa, report back when you find something.\"</p><p>Nodding my agreement, I plant a light kiss on her lips and head through the kitchen to our suite. Dria's voice reaches me as I open the door, \"If either one of you sees Sanji go near him again you need to step in. It would be bad if I started killing the guests, yes?\" </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Asa</p><p>We watch Rafe disappear through the kitchen and a quiet tension fills the air between the master, Jon, and me.</p><p>\"Stephanie?\" Vivian calls to the chef just returning on duty in the kitchen.</p><p>\"Yes?\"</p> <p>\"Prepare pots of blood coffee and bring them into the lobby, please.\"</p><p>\"Yes, ma'am.\"</p><p>The bustle of the mocha-skinned cook snaps a bit of the strain swirling around the three of us, which allows the heated voices in the lobby to press in upon us again.</p><p>\"You warm enough, Asa? Or do you need a few minutes in the sauna?\" Vivian asks. Her face looks calm and she doesn't appear to be as angry as when I saw her last. Of course, she was beating me at the time so anything else is a step in the right direction.</p><p>\"I'm good. I haven't been outside all that long.\" Joanna's energy still sings through my veins, even with the feeding Emiko took. Pointing this out to Vivian would be akin to a death wish, so I wisely keep my mouth shut.</p> <p>\"Okay. Head back out and search for Donald. Call Drew to see if he can give you his last known location.\"</p><p>I nod and remove my cell. Jon and Vivian wander back into the lobby to join in the heated debate the vampires are having regarding Emiko and the hunt.</p><p>The phone rings twice and the line picks up. \"Drew?\" I ask.</p><p>\"Yup?\"</p><p>\"When did Donald last report?\"</p><p>\"About forty minutes ago. He was near the apartments.\"</p> <p>\"Where does the GPS locator say Emiko is?\"</p><p>\"About five hundred yards southeast of the first apartment building.\"</p><p>\"Thanks. Call me if Donald checks in via another route. I'm pretty sure it's his cell I have.\"</p><p>Storing the phone, I zip up and prepare to go back out into the howling winds. I pull a black, high-tech fabric down over my face and shove my hands into sturdy gloves. Slipping past the arguing vampires as they discuss the best course of action, I ease the lobby door shut and head into the frosty darkness. You'd never know it was after eight in the morning with the lack of light being so complete. Living up here in the winter feels like being on another planet.</p><p>The all-consuming cold snakes past my facemask, biting my skin and shaking me to my core. Heading to the right, I make my way past the west wing, following the plowed one-lane road deep into the resort property. The morning shift has reported for work already and with any luck, no one from the previous shift plans to disregard the mandatory curfew.</p><p>It takes about a ten-minute jog to make it within a quarter mile of the apartments. An inhuman screech ricochets from deep in the trees and pulls me up short. Changing direction, I angle toward the noise and click on my flashlight.</p><p>A black form comes hurtling through the darkness toward me, crashing into a bush on my left. A flash of the beam stuns the vampire and possibly dulls his night vision for a moment.</p><p>A vicious hiss escapes the grey-haired hunter as he turns his face away. \"Bastard! Do you mind? She's kicking my ass-I don't need another disadvantage.\"</p> <p>The scent of vampire blood seeps into the air, sweet and enticing.</p><p>\"Then let's make it fair,\" I say, sweeping the light around the trampled clearing to land on the Asian vamp's fine-boned, broad features. Her pupils shift while I watch and her arm moves in a lightning-fast gesture. The beam cuts off and their fight circle falls into blackness.</p><p>The clean-cut Donald shakes his head before jumping to his feet and barreling back the way he came.</p><p>My eyes adjust quickly, but I still can't see much. I fumble with the Maglight to see what the hell happened to it and find a frozen stick protruding from the lens. Damn. Without a working bulb the black canister is nothing more than a makeshift club.</p><p>Even with acute vampire eyesight, it looks like I'll have to rely on my hearing for this fight. The lighting near the Gen One building allowed me to watch Emiko kick Bebe's ass earlier, but here we're far from any structure and the shadows wrap around us in a suffocating hold.</p><p>\"Can you see her?\" Donald murmurs into the blackness.</p><p>I'll be damned if I call any more attention to myself on purpose by speaking.</p><p>\"He won't help you,\" comes an answering female whisper.</p><p>I close my eyes, hoping to place her by reaching out with my other senses. There. Up above and straight ahead. I feel her waiting. Her strong energy appears coiled, barely harnessed.</p><p>The sound of splintering wood and crunching branches follows for the next few heartbeats. Male grunts of exertion reach me, but Emiko fights in silence.</p><p>Donald comes flying through the air twice more, crushing bushes and widening their clearing even more. Each time he shakes himself, brushes off the snow, and approaches the direction he flew via a different path. By the sounds of it, Emiko predicts his attacks and meets him head on.</p><p>Watching the grace of her movements as she executed a complex series of strikes on Bebe was eye opening to say the least. It revealed she was toying with me in the bowling alley from the very start. I've never seen such precision and perfection in fighting, and if I play my cards right, I hope I'll never have it directed toward me again.</p><p>The minutes go by and I worry the damage to the hardy, but scant, vegetation around us continues to grow.</p><p>\"Would you honor it if I cried 'uncle'?\" says Donald.</p><p>The stillness encourages me to creep forward, as silent as I can, through the thick crust of snow beneath my boots. Ten feet in, darker shadow forms appear, almost outlined against the inky surroundings, exposing the two vampires locked in battle.</p><p>Emiko stands with a raised, sharpened stake, which looks like a broken tree branch, poising it directly over her opponent's heart. \"You're good, I'll give you that. But you are not trained as I am in the art of war.\"</p><p>\"It was a rousing, good fight. Why have it end on a bad note?\" A smile spreads across the pale skin of his face, visible only because of my close proximity.</p><p>His blase attitude has the desired effect; it pulls a laugh from Emiko. \"You're a charmer all right. Is this you're way of asking me to spare your life?\"</p><p>\"I'm not old enough to add to your power signature,\" he says while she grips his coat tighter. \"Why not let me bow out with honor and you continue with the others? I'll retire to the inn for the remainder of the week and won't track you any longer.\"</p><p>This guy must have the slipperiest silver tongue I've ever heard. If he'd caught her and managed to kill her, he'd be gladly sucking the blood from her corpse right now. The same woman, who mounted me like a freakin' stallion in heat, looks like she's considering his request.</p><p>\"I'll admit-it was fun tearing apart Bebe. She asked for it with her sharp tongue.\" Her grip loosens and she drops the polished, gray-haired vamp to the ground. \"Keep your word or I'll cut out your tongue and shove it up your ass-before I carve out your heart and drink you dry.\"</p><p>Donald rises, brushes off the snow once more and gives the black-haired beauty a solemn bow. \"Never fear. I'll stay indoors, nice and toasty. I owe you.\"</p><p>Emiko shakes her head at the man's easy acceptance. \"But first,\" she raises her face mask and steps toward him with barely controlled malice wafting across the chilly air, \"I will enjoy the spoils of the victor. Do you truly yield?\"</p><p>Donald goes to his knees and tilts his head to the side, exposing his throat. The Asian leans in and latches on to his exposed, pale skin.</p><p>I've never seen this type of behavior before, but then again, I've never been in a fight to the death with another vampire, either. Will she stop? I imagine if this were simply another way to die, Donald would be fighting.</p><p>Emiko sups at his neck for a minute or so before releasing him. \"You are older than you let on.\"</p><p>\"Maybe,\" he says while rising. \"Maybe I've had my share of powerful lovers... or kills.\" He winks.</p><p>Donald doesn't wait for her to question his suave answer; he turns and blends seamlessly into the trees, heading back toward the main building. He's a survivor. I wouldn't doubt if he were older than he's been letting on just to discourage her.</p><p>\"You've become my watcher, haven't you?\" she asks while turning to my position within their cleared patch.</p><p>A touch of fear zips up my spine and I lock it down. This new sensation is disconcerting and I need to squash any reaction from showing in front of Emiko. It's a little humbling to be afraid of such a tiny woman. Perhaps what she did to me in the bowling alley is weighing on me more than I'd care to admit. \"I've been assigned to keep tabs, yes.\"</p><p>\"But not interfere?\" She stalks closer, pushing right up into my personal space.</p><p>\"No.\" I glance away to avoid meeting her intense gaze. \"Strict orders not to.\"</p><p>\"Hmmph,\" she says, while grabbing my chin and forcing me to look her in the eyes.</p><p>\"Vivian wants to talk to you.\" I manage to keep my tone steady, but not by much.</p><p>\"I bet she does.\"</p><p>I raise an eyebrow, before remembering I have a facemask on and she can't see the gesture. I shrug instead.</p><p>\"Your boss made a lot of enemies in Argentina.\" Her voice travels through my skull like an exotic whisper of death. \"Do you have any idea why?\"</p><p>\"No.\" I wrench my chin from her grasp and take a few steps back. \"It's not my place to question my master.\"</p><p>Emiko's snort sounds across the space between us; the skin along my back prickles with the need to defend my words. Doing so would be stupid, so I keep quiet.</p><p>\"The corruption within the ranks of those who care for the Tribunal spreads deep. Coraline is only the tip of it.\" Emiko saunters up to me, her face uncovered in the cold and seemingly unaffected by it. Her delicate porcelain features look perfect. One would never suspect the strength and skill behind her visage. \"I think there were more material gains involved with trying to pin the officials' deaths on me.\"</p><p>Vivian mentioned the Tribunal was in financial difficulties. It was the whole reason they accepted the offer to let a criminal loose on the resort. Could the depth of the deceptions be as simple as mere monetary gain?</p><p>\"Who told you of Ivan's wife's whereabouts?\" I ask.</p><p>My unexpected question surprises her; her face reveals it before she can shut the reaction down. \"I received my instructions in writing. I don't know who gave the direct order.\"</p><p>\"Why do you think you were set up with the Argentine officials?\"</p><p>Her face darkens and anger cracks her calm appearance. \"I think it was for a few reasons, but I can't prove them while I'm in these.\" She holds up her wrists, gesturing to the bracelets laced with liquid silver.</p><p>I shake my head and look away. \"And you thought after you fed from me and forced a happy ending on me, I'd be willing to take off the only thing keeping you on the property?\"</p><p>She smiles and tilts her head at me. \"You didn't seem to mind when you grabbed my hips and let all that pent-up aggression out.\"</p><p>I stare back, refusing to show her any fear. The rogue waggles the wrist cuffs at me and I shake my head once. \"It was worth a shot.\" She turns and lopes off into the darkness \"Tell your master I'll talk with her. Alone.\"</p><p>My phone chirps before I can formulate a response. I take a step toward where she stood last and see no trace of her between the trees. Digging in my coat, I pull out the phone and fumble with my gloves to answer it.</p><p>\"Head back to the main building.\" Drew's voice pours out, low and controlled. \"One of the wolves was attacked.\" </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Drew</p><p>\"What?\" Asa barks through my earpiece.</p><p>\"The bitch,\" I say with a smile on the words, \"Lori.\" The sweet smell of her delectable blood still wafts in the air of the command center. \"The pack came in to warm up, but the vampires hadn't left the building yet. She was attacked in an empty hallway and didn't get a look at her attacker, but she knows his scent.\"</p><p>\"She's sure it's a guy? That narrows the list down a bit.\"</p> <p>\"Considering Bebe is dead and we know it wasn't Vivian, no, it really doesn't. It just cuts off Sanji as a suspect.\"</p><p>\"Hey, one is still better than nothing.\"</p><p>I grunt in response, my mind whirling with the thoughts of sinking my teeth into the brown-haired bitch's neck.</p><p>\"Where is Lori now?\"</p><p>\"She's in one of the rooms in the basement, on a cot. Dr. Cook is stitching her up to speed the healing along. I think she'll be going back to one of the pack's cabins afterward to mend.\"</p> <p>\"Can't we use her to confirm whether the scent at Melvyn's cabin is the same attacker?\"</p><p>\"Yes,\" I say, \"but she'll need a few hours. Her shoulder was torn up pretty good.\" My cock starts to stir in my pants at the reminder of her aromatic, and messy, injury. Looks like I might be overdue for a feeding.</p><p>We sign off as the sound of Lori's complaining enters the hallway.</p><p>\"Fuck! That was my injured shoulder, Pat!\"</p><p>A mumbled sorry from the rangy young wolf bounces down the corridor. \"Here, Eric, you take her. I'm obviously doing something wrong.\"</p><p>The larger, young Were with the dark blue eyes and crew cut comes into view, carrying the beautiful, but surly, young woman in his arms.</p> <p>I smirk when I see the conniving expression on her face. She apparently wanted Eric to carry her all along. \"I thought the injury was to your shoulder, not your legs?\"</p><p>She shoots me a mean look. \"I'm a little weak from the blood lost to one of your blood-sucking buddies.\"</p><p>I don't bother to hide my smile; it's fun goading the manipulative young wolf. \"Yes, of course I know who did it, right? Because we all plot together in one big group of the undead?\"</p><p>The one who must be Pat, snorts-but quickly turns it into a cough when Lori's ire turns his way.</p><p>\"I know his smell,\" she says. \"I can find him.\"</p><p>\"Good,\" I stand and trip the sliding wall door while advancing on the group. \"We're counting on you to see if it's the same vamp who killed the loner wolf, Melvyn. When you're feeling stronger call the main building and one of the seethe will meet you at his cabin.\"</p><p>I lock eyes with each one- the tall, broad-shouldered Eric; the more compact, wiry Pat; and the sky-blue eyed, bitch Lori-and slip into their minds, in a group mind-control. The distinction being most vamps must work on individuals one at a time when trying to mesmerize Weres or humans.</p><p>\"You will not remember being in the basement. When you get upstairs you will think you were in a guest room in the owner's suite.\"</p> <p>I lead the way, continuing my hold on the group, while we travel through the workroom and ascend the tight stairwell to the main level. I release my mind-control when we reach the kitchen. Their coats and belongings are strewn in a heap on the scarred wooden table.</p><p>\"Do you have a blanket I can use to wrap Lori in?\" Eric asks. \"Her coat shouldn't be forced over the healing wound. Could ruin the doc's stitches.\"</p><p>\"Not one handy. How about you drape the coat over her exposed torso?\"</p><p>Pat grabs her bright pink parka and arranges it as best he can. \"How's that?\"</p><p>Lori is silent during our whole conversation; her head lolls against the chest of the young Were holding her. Her blood loss must be catching up-finally overcoming the jolt of her angry adrenaline. Her eyes droop a bit and she appears ready to nod off.</p><p>\"Looks good enough for government work,\" says Eric. The two Weres exchange a look indicating an inside joke and Eric bumbles toward the door. \"Damn, she's heavier than she looks.\"</p><p>Pat gathers up the rest of their things, not bothering with donning a coat, and opens the back entrance leading to the hot tub grotto. He motions Eric through. \"I told that bitch to stop eating so many burgers.\" Their laughter rings out into the dark as the young Were slams the door behind them.</p><p>Dr. Cook emerges from the hall leading to the basement entrance. \"They get out okay?\"</p><p>\"Yeah. Looked like Lori finally ran out of steam.\"</p><p>\"She's a strong one. Has to be to keep up with those two young boys. She'll do fine.\"</p><p>\"Shall I clean up down there now?\"</p><p>\"Thanks, Drew,\" she says while running a hand over her auburn hair, checking to make sure her bun is in place. \"You're a sweetheart.\" The genteel woman pats my cheek lightly as she goes by. \"I took care of all the medical equipment. If you could just strip all the linens from the bed and haul them up to laundry I'd appreciate it.\"</p><p>\"No problem, Dr. Cook.\"</p><p>She exits via the back door as well and I take a few minutes to set the kitchen to rights-drying the floor and straightening up. I know Vivian hates us all traipsing through their personal space. The least I can do is try to minimize the damage and her subsequent annoyance. Keeping Vivian happy and stable seems to be Rafe's main goal day-to-day, and the rest of us have followed suit.</p><p>Heading back down the way I came, my senses are flooded again by the aroma of fresh werewolf blood. The pull of hunger fills my middle and pressure forms in my pants. I reach for the phone to call for a donor. No need to ignore my needs when the inn is packed with ready volunteers.</p><p>In about forty-five minutes, Chelly shows up. The statuesque, full-bodied woman in her late-thirties has become my favorite over the past two months. She's dressed in a simple blouse and flowing skirt. No doubt, the skirt is to ensure I do more than I did last time, which was pleasure her over her jeans with my hand while I fed.</p><p>\"You rang, Drew?\"</p><p>A smile blooms on my face, responding to the wicked grin and heat coming from the blond woman's gaze. She's sexy and hot. I've been aching to get inside her. I may look like I'm in my mid-twenties, but I'm not. After many decades, I've found I prefer a woman who's past the giggly I-don't-know-what-I-want-in-bed years of their youth.</p><p>\"How are you feeling?\" I ask.</p><p>\"Good. No complaints.\" Her smile becomes feral as she unbuttons the top of her blouse. \"Are we going to take the next step, Drew? Are you ready?\"</p><p>I love Chelly's boldness, but the loss of my wife has made me hesitant to bed another, hence my reluctance even though I'm greatly attracted to her. \"We'll take a small step in the right direction. How's that?\"</p><p>She runs the tip of one creamy finger into her cleavage, tracing it back up along her slender neck. \"I'm game for... whatever.\"</p><p>I hit a switch on the control panel to slide the concrete wall in place, closing us off from the cares of the inn. The solitude of the basement, where I've spent more hours the past two weeks than I'd care to think about, feels welcoming in it's familiarity. Rising from my place by the desk, I move to stand before the lush woman resting against the wall. I lean in-catching a hint of her now-familiar exotic bath gel, which creates a delicious mix when combined with her general scent of good health.</p><p>\"You smell divine,\" I say while nuzzling her neck.</p><p>She arches up, skimming full breasts along my shirtfront. Her arms twine around my neck as she tilts her head to the side. The heat and warmth pulsing beneath her skin fills my head, triggering images of me thrusting between her hips.</p><p>My cock hardens, demanding contact with her luscious curves. In a quick decision, I press her into the concrete wall, running kisses along her neck and trailing up to her mouth.</p><p>\"Oh, yes,\" she sighs. A moan escapes before I claim her mouth, her desire and longing spilling into the quiet room. Moist warmth and a teasing tongue dance with my own, meeting me thrust for thrust. A gentle flick of her exploring tip over my sharp fangs brings a shudder from her lush body. Pushing forward, I press my erection into her softness.</p><p>She matches my advances with her own, grinding her hips in a silent entreaty for more. \"God. My pussy is so wet. Touch me, Drew.\"</p><p>My heart lurches in a painful crush. What man could resist such passion? Undoing the remaining buttons, I reach in to cup her large breasts and tease the aroused peaks with my thumbs. Their weight and softness sends a jolt to my cock, causing another need to surface.</p><p>Before I can decide on how far I want this to proceed, Chelly slips her hand down and palms me through my trousers. She runs a tentative touch up and down, exploring the hard outline. \"My, you've got a long one, don't you?\"</p><p>Instead of answering, I bend to suck the thin skin at her neck. She clutches my prick in response, the heat of her little hand branding my desire. I break off my suction and lick the freshly bruised and darkening skin. Her pulse beats in invitation just below the surface, calling out to my hunger.</p><p>The slight pain heralding my fangs descent feels insubstantial next to my longing to fuck this lush woman, but I need to take things slow to fulfill my plan.</p><p>Chelly grabs at my waistband, fumbling with the belt. Her eagerness to get to my cock sends a sharp pang of desire through my body, reminding me this experienced woman knows exactly what she wants from a lover. I still her hand with a gentle touch while whispering against her skin, \"Not yet. Save it for next time.\"</p><p>Her frustration comes out in a huff, \"Why? Don't you want me?\"</p><p>\"You can tell I do.\" I say with a thrust of my hips. Before she can respond, I distract her by pulling up her skirt and reaching for the heat between her legs. The minx left off panties! \"You're a naughty woman, Chelly. Tempting a hungry vampire with your smooth, shaved pussy.\"</p><p>A shudder courses through her as I slip a finger along her swollen slit. She changes her stance, spreading her legs for better access. Slick heat coats my questing hand as I stroke back and forth, massaging her outer lips open. \"You tease,\" she chokes out, \"put those fingers inside me.\"</p><p>Nibbling at her neck, aching to break the taut surface and feed, I do as she bids, plunging two digits in deep. The shock of their entrance causes her to moan and writhe. The strong walls of her pussy grasp at my fingers, drawing them in, encouraging me to pump faster.</p><p>I circle my thumb against her clit, driving her higher. Sensing the timing is right, I pierce the skin of her neck along one bulging vein. Her blood rushes forward to fill my mouth. Latching on around the wound, I suck down her life force while I continue to tease her higher.</p><p>\"Yes! God, Drew, that feels so fucking good.\"</p><p>The smell of her arousal fills the air in the small command center, causing my cock to twitch painfully behind my pants. I want more than a feeding, I want a whole night with her-pleasuring her, making her scream, thrusting into her for hours. After almost two centuries walking this earth, I've certainly learned enough restraint that we can wait a little while longer.</p><p>I slip a third finger into her hot hole, stretching her walls a little more. Chelly clings to my shoulders, lifting up onto her tiptoes to rub more forcefully on my hand. A low moan spills from her, shudders wrack her frame as her orgasm crashes over her. I draw deep at her neck, knowing the extra pull will push her even higher.</p><p>\"Drew! Ahhh-\" Her release continues, even after I've stopped taking blood from the small punctures. Chelly's hips buck and her legs go soft. She sags in my arms as I lap the last traces of blood from the closing wound.</p><p>\"If it feels this good without you inside me, I can only imagine what it's going to feel like when we finally do the deed.\"</p><p>Her words please me. I know she's been with other vampires, but I'm sure it was a feeding fuck and nothing more. My hope is to build a rapport with her so it could be something more for us both.</p><p>\"It will be good, my sweet. You'll see.\"</p><p>\"You make me feel like I'm back in high school, Drew. Dragging it out and making me wait.\"</p><p>\"And that's such a bad thing?\" I hold both her cheeks in my hands, before kissing her lightly on the mouth. \"I bet you think of me when we're not together.\"</p><p>A blush colors her flushed cheeks. \"Maybe.\"</p><p>Her response emboldens me, and my secret wants spill out into the snapping energy between us. \"Can I see you? I mean outside of our bi-monthly blood donation?\"</p><p>Surprise coats her features and a smile crosses her face. \"You mean like a date?\"</p><p>I chuckle at her happy tone. \"Yeah, like a date. We could go skiing or bowling on the property...\"</p><p>\"I like the sound of that. Okay.\"</p><p>\"It'll have to be next week after things get back to normal and this batch of guests leave.\"</p><p>\"Yeah, things are crazy right now with the mandatory leashes Vivian has ordered with the curfew.\"</p><p>My brow furrows at her annoyed tone. \"Promise me you'll listen and follow her demands? We've got some dangerous characters on the resort and it really is for the best.\"</p><p>She glances away, but not before I can detect her accelerated heart beat. The idea of my caring for her well-being excites her.</p><p>\"Sure. Besides, I love my job and don't intend to mess it up over some normal winter stir-craziness.\"</p><p>We say our goodbyes and she asks if she can text me later. Text me? God, I thought for sure I'd be able to avoid this latest intrusive advance in technology. I feel my head nodding in response right as I sense eagerness blooming in my stomach. I'd better Google the texting thing so I don't screw up.</p><p>The constant adaptation our species must adhere to just to blend into society can be mind-boggling. Right when I get used to women voting they start burning bras... although, the sixties were so much bloody fun I can't complain.</p><p>About an hour later, hidden door slides open and my master enters. \"Latest report?\"</p><p>\"Asa tracked Emiko down. She fought with Donald.\"</p><p>\"Shit! Is he dead too? Why didn't you call me?\"</p><p>\"He's not dead. He asked for leniency if he bowed out of the hunt and she granted it.\"</p><p>\"Did she?\" Vivian's face freezes as she focuses the full intensity of her emerald eyes on me. \"What were her demands?\"</p><p>\"Err... she only asked for a taste of victory.\"</p><p>\"Hmm... Now are you going to tell me about the werewolf and human blood I smell down here?\" I fill her in on the rest of the morning down here in the permafrost-level basement. \"What are your intentions toward Chelly?\" she asks while raising one elegantly-shaped eyebrow.</p><p>She can smell the events as clear as I can relate them, so I refrain from denying my personal activities with her employee. \"I'd like to exchange blood with her and take her as a companion.\"</p><p>Vivian walks over, perching one rounded hip on the desk before gazing down on me. \"I think your timing is good.\" Inside, I bristle at her high-handed assumption that my private life is open for discussion. But, Vivian is just looking out for her own. \"I approve the new tie-if she is willing.\"</p><p>I tilt my head in acknowledgment of her requirement and in thanks for her largess. The politics involved in a seethe are complex, to say the least.</p><p>\"Now,\" she continues, in deeper thought. \"We need to arrange a meeting and discuss Emiko. Her role in this hunt changes hour-by-hour and I fear members of the Tribunal, in some deeper scheme, are using us. Call your seethe-mates and arrange things, please? Let's aim for one o'clock.\"</p><p>Vivian's entire demeanor changes in a split second. Her expression reflects a fierceness I don't often see, and if I'm honest, one I'd rather not see directed at me for any reason.</p><p>\"Yes, ma'am. Consider it done.\"</p><p>I do as bid, telling everyone to meet here, and finish up by placing my last call to Paul. He was happier than I've seen him in months when he and his wife emerged from the back room over an hour ago. He headed up to cook, stating something about getting his mojo back.</p><p>\"Paul the magnificent, here.\"</p><p>I snort before I can stifle the urge. \"Meeting in the conference room in two hours.\"</p><p>\"Gotcha, big guy.\"</p><p>Bob moans low in the background, \"Damn that's good.\" </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Paul</p><p>\"See you then,\" I say with a smile as I click the phone off. \"Really? It tastes okay? You wouldn't lie?\"</p><p>\"Nope. No reason to. It's the best sauce I've had in months. Stephanie can't quite get the same combination of flavors as you do.\"</p><p>Inside, I feel elation. I'm following the same tried-and-true recipes I'd memorized years ago while working in Los Angeles. For some odd reason, they all taste as they should now, and not how they have been since my change. \"Interesting,\" I say while sniffing the jar of crushed red peppers in my hand. \"These smell slightly different than the ones in my collection.\"</p> <p>\"Your collection?\" Bob asks between dipping yet another chunk of bread into the simmering pot.</p><p>\"Yeah. Chefs often have their own spices-some of them even pre-mixed in private. You recall that 'Bam!' guy a few years back, right?\" He nods and I continue, \"Lots of famous chefs do it. Sell the formula to their combinations and launch their own line of products.\"</p><p>\"You ever dream of that?\" the husky groundskeeper asks while grabbing another dinner roll.</p><p>I shake my head in the negative, as I stir the pasta in a large pot of boiling water. \"Nah, the spotlight isn't for me. Especially now after...\"</p><p>Understanding dawns on Bob's face. \"After you became a dad?\"</p> <p>I laugh, slapping the grounds keeper on the back. \"Gotta love you, man.\"</p><p>Bob shrugs. The timer sounds on the microwave and the pot-bellied man rummages on the metal shelf behind us for a colander. \"The pasta's done. I'm having a bowl.\"</p><p>The urge to give in and taste the sauce overwhelms me, the rich smell of tomatoes blends seamlessly with the heady bouquet of fresh Italian seasonings. Before thinking too much about it, I scoop a small amount onto a clean spoon and sample my endeavors.</p><p>\"Perfect,\" I say.</p><p>Bob looks at me with a note of alarm crossing his features. \"Should you have done that?\"</p><p>Spasms ripple across my middle and my stomach heaves. \"Probably not.\" I rush to the nearest trash can in anticipation. Trying to still my clenching organs, I take a deep breath and attempt to think of something else other than puking. It lasts for a moment before I hurl the sauce back up.</p> <p>The retching wracks my frame, engraving, yet again, a very important lesson on my brain: No solid food. Thankfully, the spasms subside when the sauce is expelled, my earlier blood meal already digested.</p><p>\"Dude man, I don't think that was a good idea.\"</p><p>I wipe a shaking hand across the back of my mouth. \"Gee, Bob, you think?\"</p><p>He laughs and slaps me on the shoulder; my momentary indignity of heaving turns into a bonding moment among buds.</p><p>\"But seriously, this sauce is excellent. What do you think the difference is?\"</p><p>\"Having not sampled my earlier attempts, it's hard to say. How about we try another dish?\"</p><p>While preparing the ingredients for a hearty meat lasagna, hoping to use some of the big cauldron of sauce I didn't eff up, I notice movement beyond the counter. A newcomer has entered the dining room. It's the only vampire not out on the hunt - Vikram.</p><p>\"Can I get you anything, sir?\" I call from my place behind the serving island.</p> <p>His slight frame jerks and he whips around in his seat. The distinct waft of incense and strong spices assails my nose. \"Oh, yes. Thank you. I'll take a masala chai if you have it, with sweetened condensed milk?\"</p><p>My gut clenches at his request for spiced tea. Guess over the years you build up the ability to digest anything remotely resembling a solid, and condensed milk lies right on the border in my opinion. While the thought of mixing sustenance into the tea and creating a god-awful drink revolts me, I do my duty and ask, \"With blood, sir?\"</p><p>The question seems to agitate him and he shakes his head sharply.</p><p>\"Yes, sir. I'll have it ready for you in ten.\"</p><p>He nods and then stares out the window into the hot tub grotto, lost in his thoughts.</p><p>After the kettle boils, I steep the tea and pour the thickened milk into a tiny creamer carafe. The sickly sweet aroma of the milk clogs my nasal passages, threatening to bring another heave from my stomach. I clamp down on my senses, trying to rein in my reactions so I don't embarrass myself and puke all over a guest. I'm betting it might get me removed from kitchen duty faster than my recent bad cooking will.</p><p>\"Here you are, sir,\" I say with smile, hoping I don't look as green as I feel.</p><p>Vikram doesn't even spare a glance my way, just nods while I place the tray on his table. Quirky fellow. I take my leave and head back to the kitchen, eager to get back to making my lasagna.</p><p>Bob sits in a stool near my workstation, a scrap of paper held in his meaty hands with a blunt pencil poised above. \"Mind if I take notes on what you add? I'd like to learn how to make it.\"</p><p>My heart swells at the compliment he's unknowingly given me. \"I'd be honored. Just don't sell it and take all the credit.\" I toss him a wink to show I'm joking and set to work.</p><p>Performing the task of layering the boiled noodles, cheeses, various cooked ground meats and sauce, brings me back to the simple joy of cooking. The spices fly as I get into a groove, calling each step out in turn to the rapt Bob. Maybe I can balance all the things from my past with this freaky new undead existence-well, all except for the normal sampling of dishes.</p><p>\"Smells good,\" a gravelly voice sounds from the direction of the dining room. I look up and meet the hazel-eyed good nature of Vivian's servant, Jon. \"I think you may have finally got it right, you blood-sucking fool.\" He grins from ear to ear. \"Good job, Paul.\"</p><p>The cascade of pride I feel has me hoping I don't eff up my next time on shift. \"Thanks.\"</p><p>\"What's with the creepy thin guy?\" he whispers, possibly attempting to not offend the guest with his observations. \"Smells like he bathed in a vat of patchouli.\"</p><p>I smile, realizing he's nailed the same scent I picked up before. \"Meditation?\" I raise my shoulder, \"I don't know.\" Vikram must hear us, but he's still staring out the window, his tea untouched.</p><p>\"Save me some of the sauce you're making, okay?\" He cranes his head over the counter and spies the lasagna, too. \"Oh, and a dish of that as well?\" Jon doesn't head into the main building much to eat and on the occasions when his visits used to coincide with my shift he would usually request a take-away serving.</p><p>\"It's the least I can do when you lent two of your dogs to Bunny and the kids for the week. They love the company and I'm grateful for the added security while the rogue is loose.\"</p><p>\"No problem, man. You'd do the same for me if the situation were reversed.\"</p><p>I nod, not sure what protection I could have offered him when I was an overweight cook, except maybe save him from getting drunk in the resort bar by drinking his beers for him. Now that I'm undead, there are a slew of new possibilities on how I could help him if he ever needed it.</p><p>Jon leans his neck to one side and series of pops sounds in the room. \"Damn. I'm stiff. I need to get some rest soon.\" He glances at his watch. \"Shit, it's still well over an hour 'til we meet.\" He cracks his neck on the other side. \"I'm off to try and chill for a bit.\"</p><p>The powerful man lopes off with a farewell nod of his head and meanders back through the dining room.</p><p>\"So how long do I cook it in the oven and at what temp?\" Bob asks, as if Jon never even stopped by. He's studious in his note taking; I'll give him that.</p><p>\"Cover in foil first. Then fifty minutes at 350 degrees. Take the foil off and let it brown a little near the end.\"</p><p>Out if the corner of my eye, I notice our guest staring in a new direction. Something appears off with him, but I can't tell what. I think I'll mention it to Vivian when the seethe gathers. Vikram slinks from his table and heads out after Jon. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Jonathan</p><p>The calm of the empty gym engulfs me as the door swings shut. The heavy scent of patchouli fills my head, effectively closing my sensitive nose down. This must be where Vikram spent most of the past day. Can I do this? Can I try and calm the longings I feel for Vivian with a little peaceful chanting and meditation?</p><p>A snort escapes me before I reach the eternal flame positioned on the far side of the room. Centuries of monks and entire nations do this-it can't be too hard, right?</p><p>I settle cross-legged at the edge of the exercise mat in front of the flickering lick of fire. The view out the windows of the snowy grotto enhances the feeling of isolation amidst the bustle of the hotel. I search in vain for some posted directions or such; Vivian has a penchant for writing exact instructions down for every piece of equipment on the property.</p> <p>I find nothing and assume this meditating gig has somehow escaped her meticulous cataloging of data. Closing my eyes, I focus on my breathing. The luscious image of Vivian fills my thoughts and I steer them away to something more base. The green forest leaps front and center, the memory of lush earth and wild plant growth swirls through my mind.</p><p>Running through the woods with my pack encompasses my entire being. The stray hint of a buck, the musk of a bear, smaller vermin crisscrossing the trails.... The sheer joy of running full tilt into a setting sun with the knowledge we have all night ahead of us, wraps around my heart and elevates it from the stress of this week.</p><p>My pulse slows and a sense of peace fills me.</p><p>Huh, if this is all meditating is about then I can do it at home. Must be my greater mind ability combined with the wolf making me a natural. I chuckle before realizing this is probably not what true meditating is. How in the hell do you turn your mind off? Where is my happy, woodsy feeling of a moment ago?</p><p>Smooth hands latch onto my neck from behind and I'm pulled roughly against a cooler body. Instinct kicks in and I twist to the side, narrowly missing the open maw aimed at my throat.</p> <p>\"The pup wants to play, does he?\" The words rasp past saliva-tipped fangs. Vikram absent-mindedly wipes his chin with the back of a hand while stalking toward me.</p><p>The small Indian man has the strength of the undead behind him, and judging by the glint in his eye, I'd say a new addiction to Were-blood to contend with as well.</p><p>\"Hold on there, little buddy,\" I say with my palms out in a halting gesture. \"You know who I am, right?\" He doesn't seem to register my words and lunges to grab me.</p><p>Air whisks by as I shift to the left, throwing my weight forward into a roll. Coming out of the move, I turn to face the vampire. His expression looks like no one is home.</p><p>\"Dude, if you're hungry let's get you some blood in the kitchen. I'm Vivian's servant and she doesn't share, trust me.\" I don't include that I'd sooner rip his throat out than let him feed from me-no need to be rude.</p><p>His perfect, bronzed features transform as he closes his dark eyes slightly and inhales deep. An eerie calmness descends over him for a moment and it looks like he's snapping out of the crazy haze he's in.</p> <p>I take a deep breath and relax my stance a bit. Holy shit, that was close. I can't believe I've had to fend off two Were-blood loony vamps in less than twenty-four hours.</p><p>Vikram's eyes snap open and he dives through the air at my legs. The skin pulls back from his once-calm visage and his mouth drops open in a deadly hiss. I lash out with one booted foot and clip him mid-air, sending him off track and crashing into some gym equipment.</p><p>The old vampire rights himself and locks eyes on my throat. \"You smell good, wolf. I can't resist.\" He stalks closer and I move to my right, putting the Universal machine between us.</p><p>\"It's the blood addiction, man. You're not yourself. Shake it off!\"</p><p>He ignores me, charging with his head down. I dart to the right, but he reaches out with one hand and grabs my plaid shirt. A loud rip sounds through the gym as the material gives under the force. Nails rake my side and the smell of werewolf blood fills the room.</p><p>Diving to the ground, I slide under a weight bench and come up near the dumbbell stand. I grab a ten-pounder and spin around, anticipating the frenzied vampire will be right behind me. The force of my turn gathers momentum and the weight slams the slight figure in the shoulder, sending a sickening crunch of bone through the air.</p><p>Vikram hunches to the side and uses his right hand to push the injured shoulder back into place. \"You'll pay for that, dog. I'll drain you while you live, squirming beneath me as you beg for your life.\"</p><p>Lashing out with my fists, I land a series of blows to his head and torso. The vampire takes it, cackling the whole time. In a last-ditch effort to get past him to the door, I grab the front of his shirt and throw him bodily across the room. I don't stop to see where he lands, but dodge through the exercise machines as fast as I can for the exit to the hall.</p> <p>Where is Vivian? Can she sense I'm in danger? What the fuck is up with that mind link shit? Open a door in my head? I never did learn how to do it. I mentally scream her name through my mind, not sure if I'm doing it right and not caring.</p><p>Vikram lands on my back, taking me down to the rubber mats in one fell swoop. The stink of patchouli fills my head as the sting of pain slices down my back.</p><p>\"How about we try flaying this one first? Maybe I can suck the strips later to get out the last of the juicy blood.\"</p><p>\"Vivian!\" Pushing back with my hands, I gain some space off the floor and manage to roll in an attempt to dislodge the bloodsucking maniac. The space between the machines is not enough room and I wind up trapping the vampire between my back and the cables and weights of the leg press.</p><p>Hands latch around my throat as I stretch to reach one of the metal cables. \"You're more trouble than I'd like, doggie. Perhaps losing some air for a bit will slow you down and let me enjoy this experience.\"</p><p>His hands lock around my throat. As my airwave constricts and I feel the blood pounding in my face, my hand closes over a sturdy metal cable and I wrench it loose. The room grows darker as I sling the line behind me, looping it over the crazed vampire's neck. His grip loosens on my throat and precious oxygen fills my lungs, hopefully staving off unconsciousness for a bit longer.</p><p>I close the loop by bringing the end into one hand and tug with all my strength. A wet hiss issues next to my ears right before the pressure on my neck vanishes. Nails rake the flesh on my hand as I flip over and straddle the small vampire.</p><p>\"Enough, you crazy fuck!\" Clasping tighter to the cable, I twist while watching his eyes bulge. \"Don't make me kill you.\" I scream for Vivian once more in my mind. Where is she? Can she hear me at all?</p><p>A sick smile blooms on his enraged visage. Sharp fangs protrude over his bottom lip, casting a demented darkness to his once handsome face. \"I've lived longer than you for a reason,\" he rasps. Vikram stops clawing at the cable and grabs the shredded flannel covering my chest, heaving me over his head toward the open mats in front of the windows.</p><p>The breath whooshes from my body on impact, and I hear the sound of the cable whipping back over the machine. This time, the vampire straddles me and starts beating me about the head with closed fists.</p><p>Crap! I should have popped the head off the fucker when I had the chance.</p><p>Raising my arms to cover my face and neck, the realization hits me that Vivian may not come and neither may anyone else. If I don't handle this vamp on my own I may not live much longer. I've delivered my share of ass-kicking over the years, but I've never killed a vampire on my own, nor fought with one so blinded by addiction.</p><p>The punches turn into open-handed tearing, and my forearms and chest alight with the fiery pain of deep, bleeding gashes. Blood drips, landing on my face and the man shows no signs of stopping.</p><p>Bringing my knee up, I slam it into his lower back, which throws his rhythm off. One hesitation is all I need. Another hit to his back pushes him forward a bit. I lower one hand and grab his cock and balls through his loose pants. Squeezing with every once of strength I have, I feel a stomach-churning squish in my palm, while a scream rips the air above me.</p><p>Vikram's new distraction allows me to throw him off and roll to the side. The energy burned up in this short fight combines with my blood loss to take its toll. My legs give out as I try to rise, forcing me to crawl in the direction of safety. If I can just make it to the door, I can raise an alarm by shouting for help.</p><p>Hands latch onto my sides, digging deep furrows into the already-damaged flesh. \"You think any injury you dole out can stop me for long?\" Without waiting for an answer, the slight man whips me across the room to slam into the wall near the door.</p><p>I slide down, stunned. Pain spreads from every part of my body as I struggle to fill my lungs with air. I can now say with utter surety I know what it feels like to be a squeaky toy for a dog.</p><p>I raise my hands in one last attempt to ward him off. \"Don't do it man,\" I say as he stalks to my prone position. \"She'll kill you.\" Vivian! I need you!</p><p>\"Let the bitch try.\" </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Vivian</p><p>\"You're sure, Lori?

I think the sounds of others racing toward us is the only thing that made him run.\"</p><p>\"Interesting.\" I walk through the cabin and back toward the door. \"Notice anything else?\"</p><p>\"He smelled like the scent trail in this cabin, but also with some spices mixed in.\"</p><p>\"Cologne perhaps?\"</p><p>\"No. More like what I smelled at college when the guys tried to cover up pot in the dorms.\"</p> <p>\"Incense?\"</p><p>\"Yeah, a little bit of that.\"</p><p>I thank the brash young woman and lead her back to her cabin. Realizing Rafe is still sleeping, I decide to head back to the main building and fill him in when he wakes up. A glance at my watch reveals it's close to eleven. Maybe three hours asleep is enough for a mid-morning nap?</p><p>Pain rips through my mind, causing me to stumble on the well-lit path and go down on one knee. Opening up my senses, I find a well of terror pouring through my connection with Jon. I feel the pierce in my own neck as a vampire clamps down on my servant's throat.</p><p>Anger and rage spiral up out of the abyss within me. Who would dare try to claim what is mine? Power escapes my careful shielding, cracking it first and then tearing it down with my increasing wrath. A metaphysical candle of energy encases me as I lunge to my feet and race toward Jon. The invisible tether of consciousness connecting me to everyone on the property is thicker and broader with Jon and Rafe, allowing the werewolf's full agony to pour through. Every debilitating ounce of terror and pain he's experiencing fills my mind, ripping a scream of rage from my throat.</p><p>I can see the Indian vampire as he leans over a beaten and bloody Jon, sucking down his life force, like a greedy child does candy. Fury colors my mind red as I run, leaving a film over my vision and tinting the night with a hint of blood. At one point, my feet cease to touch the ground as I sprint through the hot tub grotto. Raising my arms in a diving motion, I plunge through the gym window. The glass shatters, raining upon the blue exercise mats.</p> <p>My dive turns into a roll and I come to standing mere inches from the two entwined bodies. Reaching down, I place my hands on either side of Vikram's head. Without a thought besides getting him away from what is mine-I twist and pull, tearing his mouth from Jon's neck and tossing the vampire's severed head back over my shoulder in one smooth move.</p><p>\"Jon!\" I pick up the now headless vampire corpse and throw it away from the beaten werewolf. \"Can you hear me?\" I kneel down and pull his limp body into my arms. Blood pumps from an open artery and spills down the tattered flesh of his chest. His eyes roll back before fluttering closed.</p><p>\"Damn you! Don't you dare die on me!\" Biting my wrist, I tear a jagged wound and force it to Jon's cool lips. \"Swallow! You need my blood to heal.\"</p><p>Jon is unconscious and can't respond to my orders. I plunge deep into his mind and seize control of his movements, something I've sworn to never do to either him or Rafe. Forcing his mouth to function, I coerce him to ingest several mouthfuls before the wound on my arm heals.</p><p>\"More!\" I scream while slashing my teeth across the pink flesh. This larger gouge causes the blood to flow steadily down my arm, dripping onto the open wounds of his chest as well. Positioning my wrist back at his lips, I once again compel his body to drink.</p><p>I can feel the power coursing through him and witness the artery close before my eyes. Soon, the torn skin starts to mend and I sense Jon's mind stir. I pull out and allow control to flow back to him. The wound on my wrist knits shut and his body warms beneath me. I hug him close, rocking his ragged form in my arms.</p><p>\"Jon, you're going to be okay.\" I repeat the phrase over and over, not sure if I say it for his benefit or mine.</p><p>\"What took you so long?\" Jon croaks out after I subside in my chant.</p> <p>Stunned, I look down at his healing face, running my fingers over the fading bruises and cuts. \"What do you mean?\"</p><p>\"I tried calling you... maybe I didn't do it right?\"</p><p>Shame courses through me as I realize I'd shielded so hard to protect him and Rafe from each other that I effectively cut my servant off from reaching me in his time of need. I settle on the floor and haul him over, leaning his head against my chest. \"Oh God, I'm so sorry. It's my fault you couldn't get through.\"</p><p>\"Ow... still healing here, Dria.\"</p><p>\"Oh,\" I say while altering my death grip. His use of my real name is so infrequent he shocks me a bit using it now. Good God, I almost lost him.</p><p>Jon's arms come up to wrap around my middle, gently pulling me to a more reclined position. Before I know it, the injured wolf is half-draped over my middle, hugging me close and breathing deep.</p><p>\"Why did you cut me off? I liked having you in my thoughts.\"</p><p>Pain stabs deep in my heart at his words. I've kept him at arm's length for so many years it's become second nature. I need to take the next steps with him as my servant and allow him in more. Balancing his needs with Rafe's will be tricky, but as I run my hands down his back, I find that I can't bear the thought of losing him forever.</p><p>\"We'll find a way to make it work, Jon. I promise. I won't shut you out anymore.\"</p><p>He nuzzles my parka, scooting up against me like a pet on a long winter's night. \"The heat's off,\" he mumbles. \"It's cold in here.\"</p><p>I chuckle with relief while glancing around at the wreckage surrounding us. The gym lies in ruins and the winter temps from outdoors rushed in when I broke the window. A strong wind has whipped in some loose snow and a small pile forms around the decapitated remains of Vikram.</p><p>\"Well,\" I say. \"I guess that solves the mystery of who killed Melvyn.\"</p><p>Jon tilts his head against my abdomen, snuggling in but freeing his mouth to speak, \"Man, it's been a rough week so far. What are we on, day two?\"</p><p>\"Almost. Hard to believe, isn't it?\" I start to stroke his hair, shaken at how close I came to almost losing the son of a bitch. Why is it, we don't see what we have until it's gone? The soft strands of his brown hair slip through my fingers, I've found a spot that's amazingly gore-free. \"Can you move yet? I'm thinking we need to get you cleaned up.\"</p><p>\"You worried about the fallout from Sanji?\" He asks weakly, once again, putting my needs and concerns before his own.</p><p>\"Shush, darling.\" I say with a gentle pat to the back of his skull. \"Don't you worry your pummeled little noggin. He attacked my servant-no way I can get in trouble for ripping his head off.\" A shudder passes through me at the ease with which I'm able to slip my monster on and off, when the situation warrants it. Some things never change; it's best to learn to accept and adapt.</p><p>\"Come on,\" I nudge him gently.</p><p>His arms tighten around me once more before he lets go. \"I may need some help cleaning up.\"</p><p>The worst of his injuries have stopped bleeding, but I know from experience they will take some time to close internally and even more to fully heal. He'll be out of duty rotation for a few days, missing most of the rest of the hunt.</p><p>The powerful man stumbles when he tries to rise and I rush to support him. \"Lean on me, Jon. No one is around to see you need my help.\" Pain crosses his face, but he nods and allows me to take some of his weight. \"Let's get you to one of the showers.\"</p><p>We make our way slowly to the bathroom connected to the gym. The lights flicker on with our motion and the spa-like tones of the co-ed facility jump into view. I ease Jon over to a bench and lower him to a sitting position.</p><p>\"I need to call to have the window boarded up and the body taken care of. Just give me a second.\"</p><p>I strip off my coat, revealing a sweater and jeans. Flipping open my cell, I place a quick call to Drew and have him make the needed arrangements. When I turn back to Jon, pain grabs my heart and squeezes. His shredded clothing exposes deep furrows in his skin, and that's only what I can see so far.</p><p>I grab scissors from a first-aid kit under the counter, determining the best way to remove his clothes is to cut them from his body. \"Jon,\" I say. Hazel eyes filled with emotion swing my way. \"I'm going to need you to sit very still while I remove the fabric from the wounds, okay?\"</p><p>He nods and appears to brace himself. \"Hell, it can't be worse than getting chewed up by the addict to begin with, right?\"</p><p>Starting at his feet, I take off his boots and socks. The underlying skin looks to be the only place on his body free of damage. \"What were you doing in here anyway? It's not like you to work out in the middle of the day-and with boots on.\"</p><p>The mind connection I promised to keep open blooms forth a vision of me kissing Rafe, followed quickly by one of me rising nude from the pool. \"I was trying to meditate,\" the usually teasing man admits in a solemn tone.</p><p>Guilt descends, shrouded with the knowledge he was trying to get me out of his mind. The feeling of the proverbial dagger twisting in my chest is not an unknown sensation for me, just one I haven't experienced in years. I ease back a tiny bit, not closing our connection, but distancing myself from his surface thoughts while I attend to his wounds. This is not the time to dwell on past slights or current heartache; it's a time requiring action.</p><p>I lift his thick denim jeans away from his skin, slide the blunt-tipped end of the first-aid scissors beneath and begin cutting. \"Well,\" I clear my throat, \"looks like you might want to lock the gym door, or try it in a more secluded place next time.\"</p><p>Jon winces as the material pulls away from a gash on his thigh. \"We don't normally have a crazed vampire out for wolf blood running around, but thanks,\" he says, a touch of his sarcasm returning. \"I'll keep that in mind.\"</p><p>I snip all the way up through his waistband, with him helping by maneuvering into a prone position on the bench, and then continue with the other leg. His thick, well-muscled thighs come into view. The fuzz of hair covering his skin is matted in some areas with blood, and distinct angular-shaped contusions seem to cover almost every inch of flesh. The greenish bruises, which are fresh but look to be a few days old, fade a tiny bit as I concentrate on my task.</p><p>\"Surface injuries are healing well,\" I say.</p><p>\"God, it fucking hurts.\"</p><p>\"Shh... just lean back and let me get the rest of these rags off you.\" Unbuttoning the remains of his flannel shirt reveals a blood soaked thermal undershirt. Matching gashes in both show where Vikram raked his side and chest during their fight. I cut carefully up his torso and sleeves until his whole magnificent body lies naked before me, with the many wounds on display.</p><p>Jon lunges to sit up, perhaps in an attempt to get up for the shower, and a cry of pain escapes him. Blood trickles down his side and I see a line of four unsealed, deep gouges. \"Settle back,\" I say with a gentle hand to one shoulder. \"Let me take a look.\"</p><p>With a shaking hand, I probe the largest tear. One sharp vampire nail lodges in Jon's flesh, hindering the repair his ingestion of my blood triggered. A sharp intake of breath greets me as I dig out the offending item. \"Sorry, Jon. Looks like Vikram left a piece of himself behind in this one.\" I toss the nail into a nearby garbage can and bend to re-examine the rest of the torn skin.</p><p>Jon's labored breathing bounces off the tile walls and the scent of his blood mixed with mine teases my senses. My tongue snakes out to lick the open wound before I have a chance to think my action through. Vampire saliva can heal the punctures we make to feed, and I know from experience it will help here as well. I rest one hand lightly on an uninjured portion of his stomach, the other on his thigh, while I trail my tongue up and down the deep furrow.</p><p>Sexual pheromones spill into the air between us, a werewolf's natural reaction to stimulation. \"Jesus, Dria. You would pick now to bust a move.\"</p><p>I don't respond, but remain fixed on my new goal of closing this last weeping injury. Jon's emotions and desires trickle in to me from his blood, allowing me to read the depth of his love. Ignoring the clench I feel and the craving within me to return his wants, I try my best to stay the course.</p><p>The muscle in his leg jumps beneath my light touch, sending a jolt of energy up my hand. \"Relax, Jon,\" my voice comes out raspier than before, my own hidden wishes pushing to the forefront of my mind. \"I'm not making a move on you...\" I trail off as I lick the now sealed gash, hesitating on the firm skin longer than I should. I lean my forehead against his side, hiding my face from view while emotions flash unchecked across my features.</p><p>I came so close to losing him. To never smell his woodsy, wild scent again; to never drink his tasty, dark chocolate laced blood; to never have his solid loyalty by my side... when did I fall in love with him? When did I begin to long to press my lips to his and never let go? Have I betrayed my husband with my thoughts? My eyes tear and a shuddering breath escapes me.</p><p>\"Dria? You okay?\"</p><p>I blink quickly before rising, averting my gaze from his knowing eyes. \"Just shaken. We came close to losing you.\"</p><p>Jon reaches up and weakly grasps my upper arm. \"You're shielding me again, why?\" Before I can answer, Jon's hand drops and I look to his face. His eyes have drifted shut and his head lolls to the side.</p><p>Panic squeezes my heart-I fear the worst. \"Jon!\"</p><p>\"Don't worry,\" Rafe's voice sounds from the door behind me, \"I only put him to sleep. This time.\" </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Rafe</p><p>My wife whips around, guilt and anxiety playing across her face.</p><p>\"You mind telling me what the hell is going on?\" I ask, while trying my damnedest to rein in the urge to rip Jon's head off; like Dria did to the headless Vikram I just passed in the gym.</p><p>\"I...\" She hangs her head a bit; appearing to be searching for the right words to tell me she almost succumbed to the urge to kiss her servant. She can't shut me out of her thoughts as easily as she thinks. \"I'm sorry.\"</p> <p>She rushes forward and throws her arms around me. Dria nestles her head near my neck and takes a deep breath, coating her nostrils with my scent. \"I have no excuse for what I almost did.\"</p><p>I can smell the sickly-sweet power of Jon's pheromones in the cramped space. Whether he pushed them out on purpose to seduce Dria or not remains to be seen, but being tied closely with him makes it especially hard for either one of us to resist the Were. Running my hands up and down her back, I debate on our course of action. Do I want to share my wife with Jon?</p><p>The black pit of hate coiling in my head is not my finest attribute, that's for sure. But I can't say for certain where I stand on the topic while the scent of sex pheromones and blood swirls heavily through the air. Being Dria's bonded mate has me craving her blood, and when so much of it courses through Jon, it's a fine line for my conflicted emotions.</p><p>A heavy sigh escapes me as I tighten my arms in a fierce hug. \"Jon and I have an LLH relationship at best.\"</p><p>\"LLH?\"</p> <p>\"Like, Love, Hate. Some days I like him, a few rare occasions I think I love him and might be open to the idea of a threesome-usually those are the days he's really working us both hard with his sexy vibe-and then the rest of the time I barely tolerate him and it skitters close to hate.\"</p><p>Dria reaches up on her toes to plant a soft kiss right below my ear. \"I know exactly what you mean. And I'm sorry there are ever bad times.\"</p><p>I lean away, breaking our embrace and look my wife in the eye. \"The past seven years have had difficult moments, yes, but I wouldn't change it.\" I look over at the unclothed frame of my rival and friend. \"Damn, he's a mess. Let's get him in the shower and hose the bugger down.\"</p><p>With the two of us working together, we make quick work of gently cleansing the blood from the werewolf's battered body. He must have been close to death when Dria dove through the window. A slight tingle of fear skitters through my mind. I hate to admit, even to myself, but I might miss the damn furball if something were to happen to him.</p><p>\"He needs a mate, love,\" I say, as I help to shove one pink-skinned arm into a terrycloth robe. \"And quick.\"</p><p>\"Yes,\" my wife replies as she brushes wet hair back from his forehead. \"But who? I couldn't bear to have that self-centered, immature woman from Romeo's pack here. And it looked like Jon didn't want her anyway.\"</p> <p>\"How can he want anyone else with you so near?\"</p><p>\"What do you mean?\"</p><p>\"Darling,\" I try to think of a tactful way to say she's an intimidating being. \"You are gorgeous and strong. Without meaning to, you eclipse any other candidate who comes near him.\" She preens a bit at my compliment, but can also see beyond my words.</p><p>\"You're trying nicely to say I scare his opportunities away, aren't you?\"</p><p>\"Well... to be fair, he hasn't had a lot of suitable mates present themselves up here in the Arctic.\" Dria closes the sash on his robe, easily able to resist the lure of his toned flesh when I'm standing by her side and Jon is not pushing out sex from every pore. \"And then when he comes with us to the island off Argentina in the summer...\"</p><p>\"That's it!\" she says.</p><p>\"What?\"</p><p>\"Why not have him stay here this time? We could open the inn up for the summer months to Weres of all breeds and leave Jon in charge. Maybe he'll find a suitable candidate then.\"</p> <p>I bend to scoop Jon up over my shoulder in a fireman's carry. \"And what about the rest of the seethe? Would they stay here and live in the basement for months or tag along with us to Argentina?\"</p><p>Dria shrugs, for once appearing to no longer worry about the future. \"They can decide what they want to do and go where they want.\"</p><p>Judging by her lack of reaction, I'm guessing I've successfully masked my surprise over her response. My control freak of a wife has come a long way in two months. Granting her new members freedom from her watchful eye is a huge step in the right direction.</p><p>\"Oh, except maybe for Paul. I don't think his control will be ready by then. But we can wait and see.\" We head out into the frigid gym and step through the remains of the room carefully. \"And then of course, there's Asa's recent killing to consider...\"</p><p>Ahh... and there it is. I knew she couldn't hold back with worrying about the others for long. I clear my throat, \"Um... liebling?\"</p><p>\"Yes?\"</p><p>\"How about calling up someone from maintenance to bring plywood for the broken window?\" Drifts of snow have blown in and the room looks surreal. Loose white powder swirls in the corners and partially covers the equipment. \"Where's the body?\"</p><p>\"I called Drew before, he's on it. Must have removed it while we were in the shower. Smart to do it before the crew arrives to fix the window.\" She grabs the phone at her waist and starts to dial. \"But we need someone to finish the task by cutting out Vikram's heart and burning it.\"</p><p>By the time we cut through the hot tub grotto, and enter the backdoor into our private kitchen, the deed has been done. Drew heads up from the basement with a bloody bag in one hand and jolts when he sees me carrying Jon.</p><p>\"Christ! Is he going to be okay?\"</p><p>\"It was close,\" Dria says. \"We're going to keep him here on our sofa in the living room 'til he's better.\"</p><p>\"There are plenty of beds down below...\" Drew trails off when he catches the sharp eye of my wife. \"Or not. I'll be leaving now.\" A burst of cold air hits my back as the vampire heads into the darkness with Vikram's heart.</p><p>We traipse into the living room and Dria pulls the seat cushions off the main sofa section and draws out the hide-a-bed. The mattress doesn't quite lay flat, but curls up a little at the top and bottom edges. She grabs a throw from over the back and spreads the soft blanket across the mattress. My withering glance over the annoyance he's going to be recuperating right next to my spot, the chaise section of the couch, is lost on my loving partner in her haste to make up a bed for the furry fucker.</p><p>I resist the urge to toss the bastard onto the bed and settle the injured werewolf gently on the blanket. \"Two days, max. Agreed?\"</p><p>Dria looks up at my pinched expression and nods. \"Thanks, honey. I'm sure he'll be strong enough to leave before then.\"</p><p>Before I can respond, a scratching at the door has me turning to investigate. That furry fucker will be out in two days or I'll be dragging his ass back to his cabin and paying Dr. Cook all the overtime she wants to play nursemaid to the son of a bitch. A quick glance out the window in the door reveals a soft gray coat and two dark eyes. Whining joins the next scrape as I close my hand over the knob.</p><p>\"One of Jon's dogs must have smelled his blood on the wind,\" I call to Dria. \"You okay if I let his visitor in? Might help him stay warm.\"</p><p>She shudders, but nods. The large wolf dog comes in cautiously when I open the door. It holds its head down, ears pinned back, tail loose, and doesn't make eye contact. The canine walks slowly to where Jon is on the sofa bed and nudges his hand with its nose.</p><p>\"I think he named this one Amy,\" Dria says. \"Go on, girl,\" she motions with her hand to encourage her, \"You can jump up next to him.\" A dramatic sigh issues from my wife when the dog shakes all over; scattering chunks of snow, and then compling with her command. \"There's going to be fur everywhere, dammit.\"</p><p>Amy snuggles up next to Jon, resting her head on his chest, and closes her eyes.</p><p>\"Weres heal better with their pack-mates around them, don't they?\" I ask.</p><p>\"Yes. That's why I wanted him up here with us. Besides his dogs, we're all the pack he has.\"</p><p>\"As long as I'm not expected to curl up and put my head on his chest, then I'm okay with him here. For a little while.\" I head back to the kitchen and start a pot of coffee. Waking up to the images swirling around in my wife's head certainly jolted me to full consciousness, but I prefer caffeine over adrenaline any day of the week.</p><p>The rich aroma of brewing coffee fills the suite. Dria wanders in once the two on the couch seem sound asleep and sits at the table. She runs a tired hand across her pale features, pausing a moment over her eyes to squeeze her temples.</p><p>\"When did you last have a restorative sleep?\" I ask.</p><p>\"Hmm?\"</p><p>\"Down time, Dria? You may think you can stay up round-the-clock in the darkness, but you know you need to give your body a break every now and then, too.\"</p><p>She looks up, but appears unclear on a response. \"Umm... Maybe three weeks? I have meditated each day. We've been plotting and planning this crazy adventure for a while now and there were a lot of last minute details I needed to tend to.\"</p><p>\"And you didn't think it would be beneficial to rest before the big day? You think sitting and collecting yourself is the same as allowing your body to shut down and rest?\" I shake my head, annoyed she's pushed herself and put us all at risk. \"Is that why you missed Jon's need for help until it was almost too late?\"</p><p>She shoots up from the table and starts to pace. \"No, that was my fault, but for a different reason. I tried my best to shut him out to keep the bond between you and me pure.\"</p><p>\"You can't protect us all. Not all the time.\"</p><p>Dria's head whips around and she narrows her gaze. \"Yes, I can! What is the point to having all this power if I can't protect those I love?\"</p><p>I take my wife in my arms, forcing an embrace on her when she tries to shrug me off. Running my hands down her hair I whisper, \"Shh... it's okay, love. One person isn't meant to protect so many. You need to trust that we can protect ourselves and will call you when we need you.\" I lean back to cradle a porcelain cheek in one calloused hand. \"You need to find a balance between controlling the voices and managing the mind-links. Or you won't be there when we call.\"</p><p>Tension spills out of her tiny form and a sigh escapes. \"Why is it so hard? This is why I didn't want a seethe in the first place. All these lives counting on me. If I had handled things with Joanna better, she might not have gone off the deep end like she did.\"</p><p>I reach down and give her a gentle smack on the ass. \"Enough of that kind of talk. You can't predict an alternate future, so there is no need to dwell on it. You said occupying another vamp's mind for a long time can have unforeseeable consequences. Chalk this up to one of them.\"</p><p>She breaks from my hold, returning to her seat, and stares into the living room. The coffee is half-brewed, so I grab a mug and pour myself some from the pot. \"Want some?\" I ask. Dria shakes her head and watches the sleeping pair. \"He'll be fine, don't fret.\"</p><p>I sit across from her, blocking her view of the injured Were and his dog sleeping on the couch. \"Care to fill me in on what I missed between when I took a nap and you ripped off one of the guest's head?\" I smile to soften my teasing, hoping she won't take it the wrong way and start shrieking. With Dria, one never knows.</p><p>\"Ummm... let's see. Asa tracked Emiko into the woods and came across her fighting with Donald. Donald yielded and she let him live. Drew told me what happened and said Mr. Swanson has retired to his room for the rest of the day.\"</p><p>\"Anything else?\"</p><p>\"I checked in on Lori in one of the wolves' cabins. She seems to be healing well. She confirmed it was the same vampire scent from Melvyn's cabin... but I guess that's a moot point now that Vikram is dead....\"</p><p>\"What do you think happened with him? Do you think he came here with an addiction or if it manifested while here?\"</p><p>\"I don't know for sure. I plan to ask Sanji when she comes in and we break the news to her. There aren't a lot of Weres in India.\" Dria reaches for my mug, takes a small sip and returns it. \"Depending on who she keeps in her seethe, it could very well have been his first exposure to them and he couldn't resist.\"</p><p>\"Does it happen often like that? One taste and a vampire can lose control?\"</p><p>She looks pensive for a moment, \"I wouldn't say 'often'. But I have seen it happen in the past. Addiction can hit different people at different times, even undead ones. Maybe his weaker character, which allowed Sanji to treat him like a bonded mate and use him to calm her sociopathic desires, also opened him up to chemical dependency? Or maybe he had the traits in him from when he was a human?\" My wife slumps back in her chair, in an atypical lazy pose.</p><p>I reach across the dinged wood surface and take one of her hands in mine, \"Why don't you get some rest, and I mean real rest, before we meet with the seethe?\"</p><p>\"Good God, what time is that supposed to be?\"</p><p>\"Don't you worry. How about you go lie down and I'll reschedule it for three hours from now. Should give you a chance to take a catnap at least.\"</p><p>\"Are we going to talk about the elephant in the room?\"</p><p>\"You mean your shower incident with Jon?\" I squeeze her hand in reassurance. \"I know you wouldn't have done anything willingly. If something happens because of the pheromones playing havoc in your body when you think someone close to you is about to die, don't fret. I know you and I are solid and a kiss or a stolen caress won't destroy what we have.\"</p><p>\"Good to know. And I knew as much already,\" she says with a mischievous glint in her eyes. \"But I meant with you and Jon.\"</p><p>\"Uh?\"</p><p>\"You slipped into his mind and put him to sleep. How long have you been able to control the Were?\"</p><p>\"Oh. That.\" I look away, not meeting her penetrating gaze. \"I'm not sure I really can slip into his mind at will. I've been practicing with the employees in small things for months, but have never been able to get through his thicker shielding when I attempted it. Maybe it was because he was so weak from injuries and close to death?\"</p><p>\"Or maybe you didn't really try hard enough until then.\" Dria's look becomes contemplative. \"What kind of things have you willed the employees to do?\"</p><p>\"I've been careful, I swear. Once or twice I encouraged an off-duty employee to stop partying in the bar after consuming more alcohol than they could handle...\" At her encouraging look I continue, \"I've also compelled two to get me a drink when I hadn't asked for it. I figured their inhibitions were lowered by the alcohol and I could try with less risk.\"</p><p>\"Don't ever forget the risk, Rafe. You could mess up their heads if you go beyond their surface thoughts.\"</p><p>\"I know, and you're right.\" I shift in my chair, a bit uncomfortable to have been called on the carpet with my experimenting. \"I have to learn somehow, correct?\"</p><p>\"Yes, but it might be best if your first attempts were supervised. Just in case.\"</p><p>I bristle at the insinuation that I would callously fuck up someone's life by playing around in their head. \"I'm not Asa, nor am I Paul.\"</p><p>\"I never said you were, but I drove two people insane when I was 'learning' and I'd hate for you to bear the same guilt. Not to mention,\" she leans forward and kisses me lightly on the lips, \"how pissed off I'd be if you hurt one of our employees.\"</p><p>\"Uh-uh,\" I say while grabbing the back of her head, intent on deepening the kiss. \"You say 'our' but I think you mean 'your'.\"</p><p>\"Everything I have,\" she whispers when I come up for air, \"is yours.\"</p><p>\"Then how about you listen to my advice and try to get some rest?\"</p><p>She flounces back in her chair like a petulant child. \"Oh, all right. You're not going to let up until I do, are you?\"</p><p>\"Nope.\" I stand and gesture to our houseguest, \"Why don't you lie down on the chaise lounge next to the pull-out and hold his hand?\"</p><p>Shock crosses her face, \"Really? Why?\"</p><p>\"Didn't you say he'd heal faster with his pack around him and touching?\" At her nod I continue, \"Like it our not, until he gets more real werewolves by his side the two of us and his wolf dogs are all the bastard has.\"</p><p>\"Okay, I'll give it a shot.\"</p><p>\"Good, because I have no intention of curling up with him even if he needs it to heal.\"</p><p>Dria kicks off her boots and unclips her phone. As she goes to lay it on the table it chirps with an incoming call. I snatch the phone before she has a chance to answer it.</p><p>\"Go. Get some sleep. No matter what it is I can handle it.\"</p><p>She gives me one last, lingering kiss. \"Yes, I know you can.\"</p><p>Dria heads over and spreads out on the chaise. Jon has one arm flung to the side in his sleep. She grasps his hand loosely while settling, crosses her legs at the knee and closes her eyes.</p><p>I flick open the phone and head into the office to take the call.</p><p>\"Rafe here.\"</p><p>\"Rafe?\" Comes Asa's shocked voice. \"Don't tell me something happened to Vivian? Or did I dial the wrong phone?\"</p><p>\"No and no. She's resting. What do you need?\"</p><p>\"I'm standing over the body of another hunter. And it ain't pretty.\" </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Asa</p><p>\"Shit,\" comes Rafe's voice over the line. \"What happened?\"</p><p>The wind howls, making him sound faint. \"I was following orders to track Emiko and not interfere. Sanji tracked her down and they battled for quite a while.\"</p><p>\"Where are you?\"</p> <p>\"Near the ski area.\" The long shadows cast by the chair lift add a spooky, scary-movie feel to the kill scene. Thanks to the nearby fluorescent lights, the splashes and pools of blood look like ink against the white background.</p><p>\"You told me about Bebe and how Sanji drank from Emiko's discarded kill. Did the rogue walk away from this kill, too?\"</p><p>\"Yes and no.\" I look around at the huge circle of tramped-down snow splattered with black. \"They sliced each other up with swords and Emiko took some blood to heal. As far as I could tell, she sustained minimal surface wounds throughout the entire encounter. The rogue didn't drain the corpse nor did she finish decapitating Sanji or cut out her heart. She ran off right before I called you.\"</p><p>\"Holy fucking hell,\" sounds off to my right and I whirl around to face Liam and Jet heading over from behind the small ski lodge.</p><p>\"You've got visitors, Asa?\" Rafe says.</p> <p>\"Yeah, must have been why Emiko split before the task was done.\"</p><p>\"You know what to do-finish the kill and store the corpse where you put Bebe. Call me back when you're alone. I have some more details to fill you in on.\" With that he ends the call, leaving me staring at the two stoic vampires.</p><p>\"Savage,\" says Jet while checking out the blood pools, \"wouldn't you say?\"</p><p>Liam walks over and examines the Indian vampire's remains. \"Looks like she almost hacked through the right arm at the shoulder. And her head is barely attached.\" He turns his attention to me briefly before going back to the corpse, \"Did you witness the fight?\"</p><p>\"Yes.\"</p><p>Jet walks around the forty-foot clearing. The nearby light on a pole dimly illuminates the ground, making most of the details discernible with our enhanced vision. \"Lots of prints. How long did the encounter last?\"</p> <p>\"Over thirty minutes.\"</p><p>Liam gives a low whistle, \"Long time for a sword fight.\"</p><p>Images of the whirling blades, driving fists, and flying feet fill my mind. \"They didn't just stick to swords.\"</p><p>\"What's your impression of Emiko, lad?\" Liam's brogue comes through in his excitement.</p><p>\"She's highly skilled and tends to play with her opponents.\" Jet raises an eyebrow at my assessment. Of course, I'm not going to tell him about how she played with me in the bowling alley and stripped me of my weapons like I was a child. \"She's silent when she fights. From what I witnessed, she could have ended Sanji's life much sooner-like twenty-eight minutes sooner.\"</p><p>Liam shifts his battle-axe to his other shoulder. \"I wonder if it's worth it.\"</p><p>\"You mean this hunt?\" Jet asks.</p><p>\"Yeah.\"</p> <p>\"Donald didn't think so,\" I say.</p><p>\"What do you mean?\" Jet crosses the circle to stand over the body.</p><p>\"He bowed out when he knew he was outclassed as a fighter. Offered to end his participation in the hunt if she spared his life.\"</p><p>\"And she honored such a request?\" he asks.</p><p>\"Yup. And took a nice snack at his neck to seal the deal.\"</p><p>\"'Spoils to the victor',\" Liam says. \"Standard for submitting to a more powerful opponent.\"</p><p>Jet grunts and continues to examine Sanji's remains. \"Look at this crisscrossing of slash marks.\" He pokes a finger and the shredded coat falls away, revealing blood soaked clothing. \"It looks like a pattern.\"</p><p>\"I'm sorry to spoil your fun,\" I say while removing a long, silver knife from a sheath strapped to my left thigh. \"But I have a job to finish.\" Both vampires take a small step back; eager to watch when I cut out their fallen comrade's heart.</p><p>I push the ferocity of my actions to the back of my head. Following orders to correctly dispose of a dangerous corpse is not the same as being a trained soldier. Rarely were we ever required to do anything even remotely as brutal as what I've been exposed to in my new undead existence.</p><p>I slide the blade under her shirt and cut the material away to provide better access. The marks on her chest are numerous, reinforcing what I said earlier in my observations-Emiko was obviously toying with her.</p><p>\"Is that a word?\" Liam asks.</p><p>One glance at the cuts and I realize he's right. They do make a word. \"Looks like 'N-O-T',\" I say. Reaching down, I push more fabric aside to reveal her abdomen. Hacked, shallow cuts clearly spell out the word 'GUILTY'.</p><p>\"Well, if that don't beat all,\" Jet says. \"Talk about making a statement.\"</p><p>\"Could it be true?\" the Scotsman asks.</p><p>\"What criminal do you know ever admits they're guilty?\" I say.</p><p>\"True,\" he replies. \"But I think I'm going to head back to the inn and think on this for a bit. It took a long time to deliver this message-not to mention skill. And one has to wonder why.\"</p><p>I shrug and bend to my task. The silver cuts like a hot knife through butter. In a moment the first step to my job is complete and the Indian vampire's heart lays in a paper bag-ready for burning.</p><p>\"Can I borrow your axe?\" I ask of Liam.</p><p>He shrugs before handing me the heavy weapon. \"Knock yourself out.\"</p><p>One strike is all it takes for the olive-toned skin and long black hair of the old vampire to roll away into the snow. I hand back the bloody axe, for a moment or two it looks as if Jet and Liam are contemplating drinking from the body.</p><p>\"It's not your kill,\" I say.</p><p>\"From what I heard, it didn't stop Sanji with Bebe,\" Jet replies.</p><p>\"And did it do her any good?\"</p><p>\"No honor in it,\" says Liam. \"I'll pass.\"</p><p>The two hunters slink off into the darkness, in the direction of the inn and not the fleeing footprints of the rogue. I heft the headless body over my shoulder, grab the bag containing the heart, and snag the head by its long, trailing hair. I carry my burdens to the storage shed near Gen One, where I stowed the garbage bag with Bebe's many severed parts. In very little time I've got her head and quickly freezing body lodged next to the Brazilian's bagged remains.</p><p>It occurs to me, as I reach for my phone to call Rafe back, that Emiko wrote that message for me. She knew I was watching and would be the one to clean up her latest kill. I doubt it was intended to make the other hunters rethink their position in this game. Why focus on me? You'd think if she wanted to clear her name she might not have jumped me at the bowling alley like she did. Then again, from what I've seen of her abilities, she meant me no permanent harm.</p><p>When Rafe answers, I tell him of the words found carved on the body and my completion of the assigned task. The blood darkens the bag I'm holding, dripping onto the snow as I walk. I can't wait to dispose of it and get it out of my possession.</p><p>\"Don't bring the heart inside the inn. It makes an awful stench when you burn it. Use the fire pit in the stone garden. Should be some dry wood in the kindling box.\"</p><p>\"Got it. Want me to track Emiko when I'm done?\"</p><p>\"No, go check in with the wolves in cabin number three. Drew reports, via the GPS locators, that there are two more wolves back in the cabin. I want to make sure none of them are injured. A pack can be pretty stubborn when it comes to asking for outside help.\"</p><p>\"Didn't you have something you wanted to tell me before?\"</p><p>\"Yeah, but I'll fill you in when you come back to the main building. The seethe meeting at one has been pushed to two.\"</p><p>\"Okay.\"</p><p>We end the call and I head west to get back to the main building and the stone fire pit. The statues, wrapped in rope lights, twinkle in the false twilight of the garden. Numerous landscape bulbs brighten the courtyard in a simulation of daylight and help to preclude shadows from forming between the carved sexual antics on display.</p><p>Near the glass wall of the pool wing lies a gathering of benches. The smooth paver stones from the path branch out here and form a large, round clearing. An indentation in the middle indicates where the fire pit is.</p><p>A large cedar box, mounded with snow, stands behind a bench. Logically, it has got to be where the wood is kept. Brushing off the snow, I uncover a small, ash-coated shovel leaning against the back. In a few minutes, I dig out the pit, load it up with some dry wood, and set the small pile ablaze.</p><p>I sit and watch the dance of fire, enjoying the exuberant lick of flames before I have to toss the heart in. A weight bears down on me, stifling the enthusiasm I had when coming to the inn just two months ago. This was to be a new beginning away from the undead life I'd come to hate.</p><p>Is this what I want? Did I join the Army to serve our country only to get infected with an incurable disease that has effectively ended my life forever? Where is the honor in arranging a hunt for a bunch of blood-sucking serial killers?</p><p>I toss the bloody bag into the flames and the waft of the sickly sweet smell rises up to choke me. The natural tones of the fire illuminate the colors hidden previously by the dim fluorescent lights, causing the dark red stains to leap into focus. My gut clenches. More so then it did when I had to do this for Joanna's heart, and then Bebe's, earlier today.</p><p>Is my new \"family\" the family I want? Can I repair the damage I've done with killing Joanna? Hell, she was a crazy bitch and had to go, but am I up for the rebuild into Vivian's good graces?</p><p>A sigh escapes me as I stare into the sputtering fire. The wetness of the heart dampens the roaring flames. I toss a few more pieces of kindling on and build it back up to finish the job.</p><p>Essentially, isn't this what I must do with my life? Build it back up and make something of my new undead existence? It will never be the same as my old life. I miss my father and my brother, having lost my mother and other brother ages ago.</p><p>A resolves grips me as I sit and watch the fire until it dies. Vivian is a worthy leader to follow. I've pledged my allegiance to her and to break my vow trying to leave is a fate worse than losing honor-it is a fate filled with fear.</p><p>This existence is all I have left. I don't want to die, so I intend to make the best of it. \"Adapt or die\" is Vivian's favorite saying, and one I'm only now starting to fully understand.</p><p>Pushing the ashes around with the shovel, I spread out the remains to ensure the job is done. A check of my cell phone indicates the time is one-fifteen. With one last glance at the stone pit, I head out to the guest cabins to complete my next task-checking on the stinky werewolves. Why hasn't anyone told them they reek of wet dog? There's got to be soap or something to cover that stench up.</p><p>I'll be glad when the week is over. It's still hard to believe we haven't even made it through the second day and we've lost two hunters already-three if you count Melvyn. I see why Vivian asked for the money upfront.</p><p>The paths leading to the guest cabins smell much more doggy-like than they did my last trip through here. The musky trail has hints of femininity in it, but male pheromones overlay those traces for the most part.</p><p>I haven't met this group yet, I was on duty in the command center when they arrived and Drew showed them around. Hopefully, they'll give me a chance to explain who am I before they jump to the conclusion I'm one of the vampire hunters. I went over the dossiers of the wolf pack so two of the male werewolves I sense inside must be Romeo, Spike, Eric or Patrick. Don't know much else besides their first names. Jon said Weres tend to take the last name of the pack they're a part of.</p><p>I knock on the door and wait. The heavy wood door is pulled open by a bulky young wolf looking a lot like my younger brother. Is my wishful thinking from earlier about family playing tricks with my mind?</p><p>\"Asa?\" The young man's mouth hangs open in shock. \"It can't be you, right? Because my brother died in Afghanistan.\"</p><p>Shock spirals through me and grips my heart in a death vise. \"Eric?\" My voice comes out in a croak. \"How the hell did you get here?\"</p><p>Eric reaches out and grabs me by the shoulder, hauling me into the cabin and slams the door shut. He takes hold of me in a big bear hug while his stink of werewolf musk wafts around me.</p><p>In one split second the moment is over and he pulls back and slams me into the door. \"Dude!\" The smack against the solid wood reverberates through my spine. \"What the fuck, man? You're a vampire now?\"</p><p>\"I could say the same to you,\" I grumble while my heart sings with the fact I'm reunited with the brother I never thought I'd see again.</p><p>\"So you didn't die overseas, but got turned?\"</p><p>\"Yeah, that about sums it up in a nutshell.\"</p><p>\"Why didn't you contact us?\" he says while shaking his head. \"Dad was beside himself with grief. Hell, I grieved for you right alongside him.\"</p><p>I look away, unable to meet his pain-filled eyes. Wandering in, still in shock, I sit on the couch. \"I couldn't. There was no way to control the bloodlust going through me... I would have drained you both.\"</p><p>Eric dismisses my fears with a snort and waves it off. \"Yeah, whatever. You keep telling yourself that. It was shitty and you should have at least called.\"</p><p>The heat of anger fills me, reflecting the confused emotions spilling through my body. \"And said what? 'I'm a vampire now and have killed innocent people while the bloodlust rides me?'\"</p><p>My brother sobers and sits across from me. \"Okay, good point. But surely sometime in almost two years you could have reached out?\"</p><p>I shake my head at his obvious acceptance of my new existence. \"Like you two would have believed me? Give me a break. No one believes in this paranormal crap, unless they've experienced it firsthand. Speaking of which-how did you wind up a werewolf?\"</p><p>\"Pat and I were hanging out at camp, you know, our old favorite partying spot in West Milford?\" I nod and he keeps going. \"We had one too many, like usual, and this mangy-looking big dog wanders into the firelight.\" He stares off in the direction of the fireplace, his broad shoulders hunching forward while he retells the details. \"We didn't have any food to entice it, but tried to call it over so we could pet it.\" He shakes his head. \"Idiots. We were such dumbasses. Back from a tour overseas, feeling no pain. The big dog growled and lunged. Pat shouted, 'Run!' We stumbled through the woods, screaming like morons, and the thing took us down in minutes.\"</p><p>\"Did it just bite or were you both mauled?\"</p><p>\"Both of us were torn up pretty good. Maybe all those damn shots and vaccines the government forced on us gave us a fighting chance, I don't know. We both woke up in the hospital. Pat had to be strapped down and medicated for a while. The uncontrollable rage from the transformation rode him the moment he came to.\"</p><p>A smile creases my face as I remember my brother's obnoxious best friend; he always did have a hair trigger. \"Did the bastard survive?\"</p><p>Eric motions with his head at the closed bedroom door. \"Yup, he's in there right now, trying to seduce the pants off our injured pack-mate. I don't think he'll get far. Lori is a bit of a bitch.\" He laughs at his own joke. \"In every sense of the word.\"</p><p>\"How did you find out what you were?\"</p><p>\"Some guy came to visit us in the hospital. Claimed we'd been changed into werewolves and bitten by a junior member of his 'pack'. Pat laughed his ass off. I just kind of sat there in shock. The man was Romeo, our alpha. A group of them were vacationing down in warmer weather during the fall,\" he pauses in his speech, looking to see if I'm listening. At a nod from me he continues, \"He told us one member wandered off right when they were scheduled to leave before the full moon. The full moon happened and the loner wolf attacked. Romeo only brought us along on this hunt because we're the newest pups and he didn't trust us alone with the pack.\"</p><p>\"Yeah, but to bring you out to hunt a rogue vampire?\" I shake my head. The incredulity of my brother being a werewolf still hasn't sunk in. It's easier to just examine the facts. \"That doesn't seem like a good choice, either.\"</p><p>Eric shrugs. \"Which is why we're mostly here in the cabin. We went out initially when the hunt started, but at four months as werewolves, we're not really up to snuff yet. Both of us can follow orders and hunt in the pack at home, but here is different. Once Lori was attacked in the main building, Elsa wanted us safe and sound in here.\"</p><p>Pat saunters out of the bedroom, gets a look at me, and stops dead. \"I thought you had the TV on. Am I seeing things or is that your brother, Asa, looking like a pasty-assed version of himself and fuckin' reeking of a dead guy?\"</p><p>I rise from the couch to greet my old friend. Quick as a wink, Pat launches across the space and bitch slaps me. My head whips around and the skin of my lip splits. I turn back to face the enraged Were as the small bit of blood on my mouth disappears and the wound seals shut.</p><p>\"What the fuck was that for?\" I ask, trying to keep my temper in check.</p><p>\"Do you know what we went through thinking you were dead? Be thankful I only smacked you once, you inconsiderate bastard.\" Anger gone, Pat pulls me into a hug and thumps me on the back.</p><p>I shake my head as he lets go and plops down on the couch next to where I sat earlier. \"You're crazy, you know that?\"</p><p>\"Yup, and an asshole. Tell me something I don't know,\" Pat replies with a good-natured grin on his face. \"How'd you wind up with a liquid diet, anyway?\"</p><p>I settle back on the couch, still feeling a bit like this moment is surreal, and try to explain. \"We were out in the field for a few weeks, tail end of winter in Afghanistan. Came across a local-pale, skinny guy who looked delirious. I was bringing him back for medical assistance when he jumped me.\" I look away, the memory lurching up to life. \"I found out later he must have drained me dry, and then gave me some of his blood in return. Maybe he felt bad for almost killing me?\" I shrug and finally meet my brother's concerned eyes. \"I dunno. I didn't know what happened to me until I tried to snack on my buddies. After that, I went AWOL and staged my death.\"</p><p>\"How did you get back to the States?\" Eric asks.</p><p>\"Yeah, and did you forget your family's fuckin' phone numbers, too?\" says Pat.</p><p>\"Took me a few months to figure out how to get home. The first person I called was Aunt Cali.\"</p><p>\"Aunt Cali?\" Eric says. \"We haven't seen her in years. Since she went overboard and started acting weird.\"</p><p>\"I remember hearing about that,\" says Pat. \"Your whole family cut her off, right?\"</p><p>\"You guys don't recall what she was acting weird about, do you?\" He shakes his head. \"You weren't paying attention much, Eric. Think you were eleven or so at the time. She started talking about other worlds and supernatural beings. The family kind of wrote her off like she was a nut. Little by little everyone distanced themselves from her until we just stopped talking about her.\"</p><p>\"So you called her?\" Eric says.</p><p>\"I figured maybe she wasn't so crazy. After all, I had to drink blood to live and the sun burned my skin... Turns out, she was bitten by a werewolf over a decade ago. Lives in Manhattan now.\"</p><p>\"No shit?\"</p><p>\"Her husband is a vampire. I lived with their group for over a year.\"</p><p>Pat leans forward and lifts up his hand, in a mock strike. \"Don't tell me you were only an hour away for all that time and still didn't reach out?\"</p><p>I put two hands out in a placating gesture, \"Relax, fuckhead. By that point, I couldn't contact you. The vampire family, or seethe, forbade it. If I wanted to keep you all safe, I had to play by their rules. Over time, I realized the rules were made for a good reason.\"</p><p>\"'Good reason' my ass,\" Pat sneers. \"It was just wrong. And you know it.\"</p><p>I stand, not wanting to get into an argument with the volatile young man. \"I'm not going to rehash why I didn't contact my brother and father when I could have killed them the moment I got too hungry. It's done. If you two hadn't been bitten I doubt I'd have ever been able to tell you and have you believe me.\"</p><p>My phone rings and I grab it.</p><p>\"Yup?\"</p><p>\"Meeting is about to convene,\" Rafe's smooth tones come over the airwaves. \"You might want to hightail it over.\"</p><p>\"Yes, boss. Be right there.\" I extend a hand to my brother, who ignores it and hugs me again. \"I'll be back as soon as I can and we'll talk some more.\" He thumps me on the back before stepping away. \"Duty calls.\" I flip off Pat, like I used to do back home years ago. He smiles and returns the one-finger salute.</p><p>\"You work at this place?\" Eric asks. \"You're not here as part of the hunt?\"</p><p>\"Nope, not a hunter. I joined this family about two months ago.\" I stride to the door and turn back with my hand on the knob. \"Be back when I can.\"</p><p>\"You better, I don't plan on losing you twice.\"</p><p>Moving quickly down the lit paths, I cross into the grotto and see a panel of wood over one of the windows to the gym. I bet it's one of the things Rafe wanted to talk to me about.</p><p>The stillness and peace I usually feel when stepping through the back door into Rafe and Viv's suite is missing. The unmistakable odor of wet dog, not werewolf, fills the space. A glance into the living room reveals two big wolf-dogs stretched out on the pull-out couch, staring intently my way.</p><p>\"Nice doggies,\" I say.</p><p>The lip of one half-breed pulls back, showing long, pristine white teeth. A low rumble sounds through the quiet and the creature's muscles tense to leap. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Drew</p><p>A slam sounds from the direction of the workroom and Asa skitters to a halt inside the command center. \"What's with the big mutts upstairs?\"</p><p>A smile tugs my lips at his obvious haste and discomfort. \"Amy and Kujo-two of Jon's wolf-dogs.\"</p><p>\"Why are they camped out in the living room on a hide-a-bed?\"</p> <p>\"Jon was hurt and recovering under Vivian's eye. The dogs came to lend healing strength with their presence.\"</p><p>\"Well, he's going to have to introduce me to them and assure the mutts I'm not on the menu.\" He turns to show me a rip in his coat. \"The big reddish-brown one was damn fast.\"</p><p>\"Yup, that would be Kujo. Think he might be part Dogue de Bordeaux mixed with a wolf.\"</p><p>\"A what?\"</p><p>\"French Mastiff.\" At Asa's blank look, I continue, \"Big-ass dog.\"</p> <p>He nods and heads down the hall, seemingly preoccupied and uninterested now that the dog in question is no longer an immediate threat.</p><p>Vivian strolls casually into the underground SCIF facility, cool and collected. She has a relaxed air about her, which has been missing for a while now. A smile curves her Cupid's bow mouth when she glances my way, \"Ready to begin?\"</p><p>I grab my paperwork off the desk and rise to follow. \"Yes, ma'am.\"</p><p>We settle in, with Vivian taking a spot between Rafe and Jon-who is still looking a little worse for wear. Asa's earlier chattiness is gone and he looks pale sitting next to Paul, but, then again, he did just come in from the cold.</p><p>\"Did you fill everyone in on the latest kill reported by Asa?\" Vivian asks her husband.</p><p>\"Yes, but they aren't aware of what happened in the gym yet.\"</p> <p>A light frown mars Vivian's smooth forehead and quickly disappears. \"Vikram turned out to be the vampire who killed Melvyn and attacked Lori in the hall. His involvement, and new werewolf blood addiction, were confirmed when he tried to drain Jon.\"</p><p>Paul gasps and turns to the healing Were. \"Damn, Jonathan. You were able to take down a crazed vamp on your own? Impressive.\"</p><p>A wry smile crosses the man's face. \"Not exactly. Vivian dove through a window and ripped his head off.\"</p><p>A choking sound comes from Paul, but other than that, the table takes the news of our boss's ruthlessness in relative silence.</p><p>\"Wasn't he Sanji's mate?\" the chef says after he collects himself. \"At least we won't have any retribution coming from her people, right?\"</p><p>\"Not exactly,\" Vivian says while tapping her fingers on the small notebook in front of her. \"I'll have to report what happened to the council... but I'd really rather not have to tell Coraline about Vikram.\"</p><p>\"Maybe she'll focus on the hunters being killed,\" I suggest, \"and you can call the council about Vikram when she's gone?\"</p><p>\"We'll see.\" Vivian says. \"I haven't decided yet. But I'd like to discuss what you've found out from Cy and what we need to do to get this hunt back on track.\"</p> <p>I flip open my folder and hand out copies of the email information I received. \"Emiko's name was added to a large parcel of property right in the heart of Buenos Aires about ten years ago.\"</p><p>\"Before she became an enforcer?\" Rafe asks.</p><p>\"Yes. Looks like she married a very wealthy connected old man who died mysteriously within their first year of marriage. All of his estate was left to her and his six middle-aged children didn't like it. \"</p><p>\"Amateur,\" snorts Vivian. \"Never go after the ones with large families or lots of political connections. Too many people to question the union.\"</p><p>\"There were several court battles,\" I continue, \"but his video-will stating his wishes was witnessed being recorded by a judge and two medical examiners to ensure he was of the right state of mind when he made the switch to cut out his children.</p><p>\"Over the past five years, half of her former husband's children died of apparent natural causes.\" I pause for a moment before asking, \"What do you think the chances are she didn't mind control the old guy during the recording?\"</p><p>Rafe snorts, \"Slim to none.\" Only Paul seems to be fascinated, the rest of the table looks nonplused by the revelations.</p><p>\"How does this tie in with the recent killings she's accused of?\" Paul asks.</p><p>Vivian runs one finger down the page. \"Look about three quarters of the way down. The judge and one doctor who witnessed the testimony were two of the bodies drained and left on the Tribunal's doorstep.\"</p><p>Rafe reaches for his mug of coffee, \"Are you saying you think she killed the people who could back up the video as legitimate or you think one of the old guy's kids did it?\"</p><p>\"Keep reading,\" Vivian says. \"The judge sat on a prominent board discussing the revitalization of older parts of the city and the doctor lived on the lot bordering Emiko's.\"</p><p>I finally ask a question that's been niggling the back of my mind since I read all the data an hour ago, \"Who benefits with inheriting the property if Emiko dies?\"</p><p>\"Depends,\" my boss says with a speculative look on her face. \"If she dies while in the service of the council as an enforcer, then they get her property. Same thing if she dies as a criminal.\"</p><p>Jon perks up, speaking in a rough voice. \"Who gets the property of the hunters who die here? The rogue?\"</p><p>\"Good question,\" Rafe says. \"I believe one of the stipulations they had to sign for the hunt was their seethe would get half and the council would get half. Not bad, considering whoever normally kills a vampire inherits everything they own by default.\"</p><p>The brutal logic of a seethe being only as strong as who leads it sinks in to those of us new to the inn. I stand by my decision to leave the Maggio clan in Chicago; Vivian is still stronger and has a more defensible position here on the resort.</p><p>Asa sits quiet through the entire debate. He appears to be listening, but something must have shaken him recently. He's more withdrawn and reserved than I've ever seen.</p><p>\"It's not just the killing of a vampire that guarantees inheritance to the killer,\" Vivian says. \"They have to be willing to claim it. Possibly fighting other members of the master's seethe or traveling a great distance and uprooting their own lives to stake claim.\" Her eyes take on a faraway gleam, \"It's not always what it's cracked up to be.\"</p><p>\"But the council has far reaching power,\" I say. \"And the ability to back up a claim of ownership, right?\"</p><p>Paul looks confused, \"So this could all very well have been about money and property and never the dead Argentine officials?\"</p><p>\"Exactly,\" Vivian answers. She looks to Asa and her eyes narrow. \"Are you okay? You haven't said a word.\"</p><p>\"I just met my brother, Eric,\" he says in a hollow tone. \"He's part of Romeo's pack.\"</p><p>I slap the bald vampire on the back, \"That's incredible news!\"</p><p>Rafe smiles, offering his congrats and Paul blusters like a fool, mumbling about how important family is.</p><p>\"He's a werewolf?\" Jon laughs. \"Aww, too bad man. You'll never get the dog stink out of your nose now.\"</p><p>Vivian's face shuts down, a mask of indifference slipping over her features. \"We'll talk more about this development later,\" she says directly to Asa. \"Get your head back in the game, alright?\"</p><p>\"Yes, boss.\" Asa glances down at the sheet, proving with his next question he's been listening the whole time. \"Would the council go through so much- killing those officials and charging a trusted enforcer with their deaths-just for money?\"</p><p>\"Never forget,\" Vivian says in a solemn tone, \"money is power. I don't think the Ancients are involved in such a mundane play for advancement, but I wouldn't put it past members of the Inner Circle.\"</p><p>Coraline's blond-haired nastiness leaps to mind, I wonder if she volunteered for this trip to keep an eye on how things unfolded. We haven't seen her much since yesterday, but I received a text from Chelly before noon, saying she saw the council member enter the orgy room with her hooded guards. Good to know the sexual aspects of the inn can crack her mean shell.</p><p>Paul clears his throat, drawing attention to himself. \"So, we should talk to this Emiko chick, one-on-one, right?\" His eyes dart around the circle, as if he's checking to see he didn't speak out of turn.</p><p>Most newbies wouldn't even be involved in a seethe meeting at this point in their undead existence, proving Vivian is certainly the most different kind of master I've ever served under. My first one, James, the one who turned me over a century and a half ago, was as nutty as they come-and sadistic to boot. A shiver steals over me at the remembered exploits of the infamous \"Gentleman Jack\". Killing him took the work of all ten members of the family. I doubt any of my old seethe-mates, if they are still around, has forgotten the horrible night.</p><p>\"It's not hard to find her,\" Asa says, breaking into my ruminations. \"The tracking device in her silver bracelets has held up under the cold with no reported blank spots on the property.\"</p><p>The slimmed-down chef responds before anyone else can, \"We need to set a trap.\"</p><p>Jon shakes his head, \"Dude, why would we need to set a trap when we can find her anytime we want? Maybe you need to stick to cooking.\"</p><p>Paul's face pinks a little, revealing he's fed recently or he wouldn't have the ability to color at all. \"No, I meant with the council member.\"</p><p>\"Hurting Coraline is a bad idea,\" Vivian says. \"She's powerful and crafty-I'm sure she's here with another purpose. I don't want to walk into a trap she may have set for us.\"</p><p>\"Don't you mean 'you', Vivian?\" I say rashly. My heart feels lodged in my throat. I just called my boss out on the carpet for not being open with us. Good thing there are no swords in the room or I might be headless right now.</p><p>Rafe reaches out and squeezes her hand. The ancient vampire betrays no sign of even hearing me, but the glares I'm getting around the table assure me I did indeed speak aloud.</p><p>\"Yes, Drew,\" Vivian says in a deadly calm. \"She is here for me. But if I go down, it won't be without a fight.\"</p><p>Rafe's voice cuts like ice, \"Do you forget your place, Drew? Do you forget your pledge?\"</p><p>I shake my head, \"No, I just want to know what I'm up against and why.\" I can't believe the thoughts and fears I've had are spilling out of me in a rush like this. Am I signing my own death warrant by speaking so recklessly to my new master? Or am I eager to live, and fear the happiness I'm discovering with Chelly will be destroyed over an old fight my new, arrogant leader had decades ago?</p><p>Vivian stares off across the table, over Asa's head. Her red-lacquered nails drum a beat on the tabletop and she remains quiet.</p><p>\"Were you there, Rafe?\" I ask when it appears Vivian won't answer.</p><p>He turns his head and shoots me a look of warning. \"It was before my time with my wife.\"</p><p>\"And you don't know?\" I say.</p><p>Rafe slams a fist down on the table. \"What I know and what I will share are two very different things.\" His anger radiates out, for the first time I notice a power signature coming off the human. It's subtle and different from a vampire one, but it's there nonetheless.</p><p>Right before my eyes, the walls in the conference room shimmer and disappear. A light surrounds us and trees form-thick trunks covered in moss circle the group about twenty feet away. The wood table in front of us melts into the floor and a spongy moss soon covers what has become a dark soil.</p><p>Our chairs don't feel like we're sitting in them anymore, rather, when I look down, I'm sitting cross-legged on a forest floor. The lush smells of the earth and growing vegetation fill my nose and warmth heats my skin. I look up to see the sun shining clearly on me, at high noon, and yet I feel no pain. A bird tweets in the distance and a breeze touches my skin, cooling it from the sun's rays.</p><p>\"Oh my god,\" Paul screeches falling forward onto his hands. \"Someone help me. I think I'm having an LSD flashback.\" </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Paul</p><p>I grasp soft moss and my fingernails dig into the moist soil beneath. \"Holy shit, people! Can no one else see this?\"</p><p>The frantic thumping in my chest must be my heart, but damned if it's beat like this since I turned two months ago. A quick scan of the faces surrounding me reveals they are seeing what I'm seeing. Drew's mouth hangs open and he's staring around in wonder. Jon sits cradling an arm to his injured side with an amused look on his face, aware, but not scared. Asa observes it all, silent; surprise etching his features but he remains composed. Rafe looks concerned and has eyes only for his wife.</p><p>They are all showing a reaction of some kind. Except for Vivian. She's looking right at me with a calculating look on her cold and beautiful face.</p> <p>Relax, Paul, she says in my mind. You're not tripping. It's me.</p><p>\"But how? I don't understand.\" I sit back on my ass, examining the black dirt under my nails. My heart slows in its frantic tempo and the emerald of my master's eyes seems to blend with the greenery encircling us.</p><p>\"It's an illusion,\" Rafe says.</p><p>The presence I felt with Vivian speaking to me grows in my head, and all of a sudden I can hear everyone in the grove.</p><p>Can she project like this to everyone or only those she's connected to through blood?</p> <p>God, the sun feels good. Two years is too long.</p><p>Man, they look fuckin' funny. At least Drew finally shut his gaping mouth.</p><p>Drew whips around and stares at me. It wasn't me, I swear. Think that was Jon. I say in a mental projection, the same way I spoke to Vivian earlier when she was in my head. The easygoing man looks to the werewolf and flips him the bird.</p><p>Slowly, as everyone quiets their minds and relaxes, I can discern whose mental signature is whose. \"I'm not so sure I'm digging this,\" I say. My stomach gives a lurch, confirming what I voiced. Calmness I'm not so sure is my own fills me, and my stomach settles.</p><p>Drew's boldness of today is apparently not over, \"Will you answer my unspoken question about to whom you can project? Or leave us in the dark?\"</p><p>The illusion starts to slowly fade. First, I'm back up in my chair and then the round conference table emerges from the forest floor. As the trees fade to the industrial white walls and the heat of the sun winks out, replaced by the indirect lighting of the covered bulbs in the chandelier, a gentle sigh escapes Jon.</p> <p>A hush settles over the small group as we all turn to the fiery redhead. \"I can broadcast to anyone at anytime on the property,\" she answers. \"My connection here is strongest. Outside the resort I can project within a two hundred foot radius... to anyone.\"</p><p>The dramatic pause at the end must have sunk in with everyone else to mean something. Asa looks intrigued and Drew looks worried. I feel like I'm still holding the bag and waiting for candy when the lights are out in the house. Is this a big deal? Should I be scared?</p><p>\"How long have you had this advanced glamour ability?\" Drew asks.</p><p>\"Since I turned. It started with being able to alter my appearance. I built it up over the years. \"</p><p>\"I'll say,\" laughs Jon. \"I think I smelled deer in that last one.\"</p><p>Drew turns to the Were. \"You've known all along?\"</p><p>\"I am her servant.\" A self-satisfied smile creases the werewolf's features. \"Not much we don't share.\" A dark expression crosses Rafe's face; this time it's Vivian who reaches out a soothing hand to her husband. Is there tension between the three we're unaware of? Are they all one big happy threesome? I'm thinking if they were, then Jon wouldn't be walking around with a hard-on for her half the time... so maybe there is some trouble in paradise.</p><p>\"Is this why Coraline hates you?\" Asa asks. \"Is this what they are after?\"</p> <p>\"Coraline hates me because she thinks I had something to do with an Ancient who died years ago, while on her watch... and a vampire lover who favored me over her.\"</p><p>\"So she doesn't know of your illusion abilities? Are you sure?\" he says while staring intently at Vivian.</p><p>Vivian looks away, unable to meet his gaze. \"I'm not sure. I've been careful to hide it and use the gift sparingly.\"</p><p>\"Why not use it in a trap?\" I say. \"You said you can do it really well on the property, right?\"</p><p>A slow smile tilts the corner of her full lips, \"That's an understatement.\"</p><p>\"What do you suggest, Paul?\" Rafe asks.</p><p>All eyes turn to me and now I'm not so sure my idea is a good one. \"Can you get super-detailed with the illusions, like other people and stuff?\" Just then, a movement catches my eye from the doorway. Coraline stands at the door in the long black coat she arrived in, the one with the bright turquoise pendant pinned at a jaunty angle, and cascading curly blond hair frames her angelic face.</p><p>She peels back her top lip to expose one bloody fang and reveals an object she held behind her back. Dangling from her petite hand is the severed head of my wife, Bunny. A blood-curdling girly scream rips from my throat and I launch out of my chair... only to have the council member-and the head-disappear.</p><p>I land on the carpeted floor in an inglorious heap, amid the raucous laughter of my seethe-mates. \"Paul!\" Jon calls. \"You should have seen your face! Priceless.\" At a sharp look from Rafe he quiets. \"But hey, I bet that answered your question, eh?\"</p><p>A tingle of fear slides through my body as the magnitude of this \"gift\" really hits me. I hope there are not many masters who hold this power. Or of they do, they don't have quite such a mean streak in them as Vivian does.</p><p>You wanted proof on how real it could be. Vivian says inside my head. Was that good enough for you?</p><p>As the rage slowly subsides and I'm able to pick myself up off the floor with relative dignity, I answer, \"I get it. Thanks.\" If she made Bunny look dead, and I mean really dead, could she do the same with Emiko?</p><p>\"How is it the ability works on vampires?\" Asa says with a glint of interest in his eye. \"I thought glamour was only supposed to work on humans?\"</p><p>\"With enough practice,\" Vivian begins, \"a vampire can push a subtle physical glamour to surround their body. Like making their skin less pale or enhancing their looks. His or her fellow undead may not notice because it takes concentration to break the glamour.\"</p><p>\"Is this your way of telling them you're not a natural redhead?\" Jon winks at me while talking to Vivian. \"Cuffs and collar don't match?\"</p><p>She smiles and relaxes a bit, \"Sorry to disappoint, but no, this is all me. I don't use small glamours on myself. Waste of energy.\"</p><p>Drew waves his arm around the room, \"This show you put on was not so little. And I bet it uses a lot of power.\"</p><p>Vivian shrugs one delicate shoulder, \"Depends on how much you have to start with. And how much practice you have.\" At Drew's look of incredulity she adds, \"But yes, I couldn't do an elaborate one like that for twenty-four hours, it does drain me.\"</p><p>I take a deep breath and forge ahead with my thoughts. \"But could you do a more detailed one for, say, fifteen or twenty minutes?\" At her quick nod and no elaboration, I decide to spill my idea. \"Could we stage Emiko's death and trick Coraline into leaving, thinking the hunt was over?\"</p><p>\"What if she did kill her husband and his kids? Doesn't she deserve whatever punishment she gets?\" Asa asks. I sense a little dissension below the surface there; maybe he doesn't like the Asian vampire too much. Then again, I think I heard them talking about her beating the crap out of him earlier.</p><p>Surprisingly, it's Rafe who answers him, \"You're still thinking like a human, Asa. The justice and laws in the vampire world aren't the same as what you're used to. You're a predator now.</p><p>\"Whether she preyed on that man or not isn't what we're here discussing. Has she been used as a pawn to get to Vivian? Is she being used by the Inner Circle because of her property and their desire to own it?\" His soothing tones make sense, drawing us back on track in spite of the shock of Vivian's power revelations. \"Do we intervene and try and talk with her and if yes, what do we plan to do to change the fate of this week?\"</p><p>Asa says, \"Will talking to her help? Won't she just tell us what we want to hear?\" The married couple exchanges a look.</p><p>\"Let me question her alone and we'll see where we are.\" Vivian says. \"We'd have to convince her to go along with the plan, first.\"</p><p>\"How about we arrange the whole thing in the woods,\" Asa says, getting into the idea now, \"where the other killings have taken place. Then bring Coraline in after we set the stage?\"</p><p>\"Jon?\" Rafe leans around Vivian to look at the Were. \"Think you'd be up to planting seeds... luring Coraline out where we need her?\"</p><p>An expression of uncertainty cross Vivian's features, but Jon answers without looking at her, \"Sure, as long as she's not an addict, I think I can handle a little conversation.\"</p><p>\"I'm not sure I like it,\" she says. \"Too many variables we can't control.\"</p><p>Rafe opens a notebook and slides it across the table to his lovely wife, clicking a pen and holding it out for her. \"Let's write a plan and work it out together. Sound good?\" </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Jonathan</p><p>The surface wounds have all healed; pink, puckered flesh coats my side as I change into a warm set of clothes. I'm still moving a bit slow and I'm not back to normal yet, but I'm still well enough to help. Charlie, the bartender on duty, told me Coraline is in the bar enjoying a drink alone. I intend on hightailing it over there as quick as I can.</p><p>It's past midnight and the seethe plotted for hours trying to work out a viable plan. Step one is talking to the Tribunal member and setting her on the predetermined trail. When I arrive at the Irish pub located in the east wing of the third floor, Coraline is examining the special drink menu, the one offering cocktails mixed with blood. Spike, one of the werewolves traveling with Romeo's pack, sits at the far end. Must be taking a break for the night and not hunting. Unlike the vamps, the wolves can't keep up the pace of around-the-clock day after day.</p><p>He looks my way and I swear I see interest blooming in his gaze. Something about his unique pheromone combination confuses my senses and makes me return his smile. Jesus. Am I that hard up for a werewolf mate I'm ready to hit on some odd-smelling guy?</p> <p>I slide onto the stool next to Cora, steadfastly refusing to look in the Were's direction again, and nod to Charlie. \"Pint of Yuengling.\"</p><p>\"Coming right up, Jon. You okay? You don't look yourself.\"</p><p>I'm freshly-showered, in clean clothes, and not wearing flannel-I wonder which one is throwing him off? \"I'm good,\" I smile my same old crooked grin, trying to reassure the bartender. \"Took a beating from a vampire earlier.\"</p><p>He nods and cleans a glass. \"That explains the fading bruises.\"</p><p>\"Trouble in paradise?\" Coraline says when she turns her attention to me. \"Aren't you Vivian's servant?\" Her eyes narrow while she checks me out. \"Did our hostess get a little rough with one of her toys?\" A smile creases her wholesome-looking face and a dimple winks into view.</p> <p>\"No, but one of the guests did.\"</p><p>\"Really?\" She turns on her stool, giving me her full attention. \"One of the hunters?\"</p><p>I shake my head and lean in, keeping my voice low. \"It was one of their guests. Did you see the Indian vampires?\" At her nod I continue, \"The male one, Vikram, came after me.\"</p><p>\"Now that's surprising. From what I'd read of Sanji, she's the unstable one.\"</p><p>I shrug, hiding my elation over what she's confirmed-she checked out the hunters and knew who all the players were before she arrived. Could one of them be in on her plans to get to Vivian? This underhanded political crap annoys me. Wolves would just fight it out face-to-face and be done with it.</p><p>The blond vamp eyes me critically, \"How did you get away? Even being younger than Sanji, he still would have been enough to take down one werewolf.\"</p> <p>\"Vivian heard my distress call and came to my aide.\"</p><p>Her lush red lip lifts in disgust, \"I suppose any vampire would do the same for their servant.\"</p><p>\"Don't speak from experience?\" I smile, hoping my good nature can charm her. \"You don't have a handsome man at home ready to do your bidding?\"</p><p>Her eyes narrow and she purses her lips, \"Not for a few decades.\" Coraline turns her attention back to the specialized drink menu. \"Sometimes they're more work than they're worth.\" One French-tipped nail settles on a printed listing. \"Barkeep?\"</p><p>The large, brown-haired man behind the counter comes over. \"Charlie.\"</p><p>\"What?\"</p><p>\"My name is Charlie.\"</p><p>\"Like I care? Get me some of this old blood, I want to give it a try.\"</p> <p>Without glancing at me, Charlie remembers his instructions from before the hunt started. \"Sorry, we're all out. Supplier might have some for us by next week, though.\"</p><p>\"That certainly does me no good now, does it?\" She flips the menu over and glances through the list of fresh blood choices used as mixers. \"I'll take a Cosmo with some A-neg.\"</p><p>Man, she's got a winning disposition. I'm starting to doubt my role in being the one to get her started on the trail. \"Charlie, did you hear the latest?\"</p><p>\"Hmm? On what, the hunt?\"</p><p>\"Yeah, Drew will be sending an email out to the employees soon, I think. One more down and two have dropped out of the hunt.\"</p><p>He delivers a low whistle while shaking the drink in a metal mixing cup. \"So that makes the body count two, right?\"</p><p>\"If you count the werewolf, it's three hunters.\"</p><p>\"Three hunters are dead already?\" Coraline sputters her indignation. \"Why wasn't I informed?\"</p><p>I shrug my shoulders as I glance in the long mirror behind the bar. Rafe slips in the room and stays close to an empty booth seat. \"I'm not the one in charge. Couldn't tell you.\"</p><p>\"Where is your master? I need to speak with her.\"</p><p>\"Not sure.\" I angle my head in Rafe's direction, \"But her husband is right over there if you'd care to ask.\"</p><p>The council member grabs her drink off the counter and stomps over to Rafe's spot at one of the corner booths. I nod my thanks to Charlie and leave my beer on the counter, untouched. Avoiding alcohol while I'm still healing seems like a wise thing to do.</p><p>Rafe meets my eye as I open the heavy door leading into the gentleman's lounge. Coraline's voice is the last thing I hear as the wood whisks shut behind me, \"Tell me what the hell has happened so far and maybe I won't go so hard on your wife when I see her.\"</p><p>I head through the lounge and out onto the landing surrounding the open foyer on the main floor. A throat clears off to my left and I catch a glimpse of familiar strawberry-blond hair in the shadows of the darkened reading parlor.</p><p>\"Diane?\" I ask, while changing direction to met her. \"Is that you?\" She's Dr. Cook's daughter and the one I was hoping to talk to about a mind protection charm. \"Did you get my message?\"</p><p>The randy thirty-year-old is dressed in a tight sweater with a plunging neckline. Tousled, spiral curls hang to her ass, begging to be touched. Her jeans look painted on and everything about her screams to be fucked.</p><p>Her full mouth tilts up in a knowing smile as she runs a hand up my chest. I grab it to halt her progress. \"I was hoping you'd call to get together,\" she says in a throaty whisper.</p><p>\"It's not what you think, sorry.\"</p><p>Diane's other hand snakes down to cup my balls. \"Didn't you enjoy it last time?\" She leans in, placing her full breasts against my chest.</p><p>I step back, breaking her hold on my expanding cock and remove her lush curves and perky nipples from temptation. I lock down my pheromones and try to will my thoughts away from plunging my cock into her. This is not the time for a quick jaunt with the sexy witch. \"You know I did. But I'm in the middle of something right now and need your help.\"</p><p>Her face clears, the sultry, sleepy look replaced by interest. \"Go on,\" she says while removing her hand from my grasp and folding her arms over her chest.</p><p>\"Is there an amulet you can make to help shield my thoughts? Or help me strengthen my mental walls?\"</p><p>She tilts her head, opening her mouth slightly and closing it. I bet she's itching to ask me what for and is debating on whether it's a sound idea or not. \"There isn't any local lore I could apply. But, most of my teachings occurred in the lower states. I might be able to whip you up something.\" A mischievous smile crosses her face. \"It'll cost you.\"</p><p>I have a pretty good idea what kind of payment the sex-crazed woman will ask me for. Stepping closer, I take her face in my hands and kiss her deeply. Her hot tongue battles with mine as her passion rises. A small whimper escapes as the muscles in her body relax.</p><p>I walk her back to a leather chair until her legs hit and she's forced to sit down. I go down to one knee, and with one hand I open her pants and unzip them. As I force my fingers down into the constricted space of her tight jeans, she coils her arms around my neck and grinds her pelvis forward. Sliding over her slippery, wet folds, I carefully explore to find the hard nub of her desire. A few gentle strokes and she's bowing against me, raising her ass off the seat. \"Take me here, Jon,\" she says as she breaks our kiss for air. \"I don't mind if we attract an audience.\"</p><p>While I enjoy her whenever I'm horny, I don't have any desire to broadcast my private moments to anyone in the inn. \"That's not very becoming for the doctor's daughter, now is it?\" I chuckle.</p><p>\"Like I care what anyone thinks of me, the resident witch?\" She reaches once more for my cock, but I pull my hips back. \"They all come to me when they want a love charm or staying power that beats Viagra.\"</p><p>The passion she's instilled in me with such charms overrides everything, even my obsession with Vivian. If I can push the redheaded temptress out of my head long enough, I can find release in the arms of another. Although, I now try to avoid long, drawn-out encounters. I learned the hard way that women can fall for me, while I feel nothing in return.</p><p>\"Please, Jon.\" She nibbles along my ear while I plunge my fingers deep into her wet opening. \"You're working me up good.\" Diane clutches my shirtfront while I steadily build her toward release.</p><p>\"You make that charm for me and we'll see.\" I know it's cruel to use her, but I've been honest in my lack of feelings for her. If she still wants a tumble sometimes, then I'm more than happy to oblige.</p><p>Her eyes fly to mine and her breathing sounds rough, \"You're going to leave me hanging?\"</p><p>A tenderness grabs hold of my heart as I lean down to plant kisses along her neck. I wish I could love her. She's sweet and responds to my touch at a moment's notice. \"No, I'd never do that to a lady,\" I say while grinding the heel of my palm into her sensitive mound. \"I can't be with you now. I've got some internal wounds healing.\" Soft mewling sounds come from deep in her throat. \"But that's not to say I won't satisfy you.\"</p><p>Despite my intentions, my sexual musk starts to leak out, coating the air with the arousal I refuse to acknowledge. Diane's pale coloring reminds me so much of my heart's desire. I bite her taut, ivory skin, drawing a slight bit of pain into the experience as she's about to peak. Biting Dria, even mildly, would allow me to mark her as mine, undoubtedly sending Rafe into a rage.</p><p>I'd love to give the human a run for his money and my cock starts to lengthen at the thought of having him equally desire me. The feel of Dria's flesh under my mouth combines with the image of Rafe taking her from behind while I tease her front. My fingers rubbing expertly at her clit while her husband's cock slides into her pussy.</p><p>A throaty \"Jon\" issues from my lover and a pulse beats in my prick. I pull back to examine the teeth marks I've made in her skin. When I see the freckles dotting Diane's complexion, I'm pulled rudely out of my fantasy. A clench in my chest reminds me it can never be. Maybe... if I can convince Rafe I'm not a threat to their bond... but doing so would be a stretch since I very much desire to be the vampire's true mate.</p><p>Diane's moans get louder and I clamp my mouth on hers to capture the sounds. My slow and steady rhythm plunging deep inside builds to a faster pace and I lighten the force of my palm. Her hips circle as she unconsciously seeks more pressure to reach orgasm.</p><p>Shudders wrack Diane's frame as I push her higher, reapplying pressure with the heel of my hand on her erect pearl. Her hands clasp my shoulders as she digs her nails into my faded denim shirt. The orgasm hits her hard, forcing convulsions around my fingers as her inner walls tighten. I slow my hand and the passionate little vixen rises up in her seat then plummets back to the leather, pumping on my hand, milking her release for all it's worth.</p><p>She breaks our kiss and I ease my hand out of the tight confines of her jeans. \"Let me please you, Jon.\" Diane runs a hand along the straining bulge in my pants. \"Please.\"</p><p>The look on my face gives her a hint of my coming answer, but before I open my mouth she rises and pushes me roughly backward into an alcove between bookcases. The strawberry blond fumbles at my waistband and drops to her knees. \"This time it will work without the charm, I know it. Injury or not,\" she says while wrapping a hand around my hardness and wrestling with my pants, \"you haven't felt this stiff in ages.\"</p><p>I look down at the golden red of her hair; even in the dim light I can tell she's not Dria. I lean my head back against the wood paneling, closing my eyes, drifting in the sensations of her moist heat encircling the tip. In my mind I see my master taking my cock deep into her throat while Rafe watches, heat burning in his gaze instead of anger. One hand pumps the base and the other kneads my balls, a gently coaxing stimulation of the soft globes to drive me higher.</p><p>What would he do? Would he join in? Take her doggie style while she works me? The images flash through my brain and I pump my hips in excitement. The wet pressure leaves my shaft and a soft voice breaks the spell, \"That's it, Jonny. Let go.\"</p><p>Jesus. Why did she have to talk? Reality crashes back around me and I'm very aware it's my sometimes lover, Diane, sucking my cock and not Dria. As she lowers her head to engulf me once more, I stop her. The blood starts to rush out of my dick and I don't feel up to trying to force the moment. \"Don't, please.\"</p><p>Hurt flashes across her face then deepens to sadness in her eyes.</p><p>\"It's not you, Diane. It's me.\" I lift her to her feet and wrap my arms around her in an embrace. \"I know you want more than I can give, and I'm truly sorry for that.\" I lean back to look in her deep blue eyes again, seeing some of her good humor replace the pain I saw a moment ago. \"It's past time I found werewolf mate. This seems to be my body's way of forcing the issue.\"</p><p>She reaches up and plants a tender kiss on my mouth. \"It's getting worse. The aphrodisiac seems to be the only thing allowing you to let loose these days.\"</p><p>I rest my forehead against hers, \"I know.\"</p><p>Diane steps back and does up her pants. \"How about I mix some up while I work on the protection amulet?\" Her no-nonsense approach makes me feel even more of a shit-heel. \"Hey now, lose the guilty look. I knew when you needed the passion charm this was not a long-term relationship.\" She gives me a saucy wink as I zip up. \"But I intend to ride it out for as long as it lasts.\"</p><p>\"Is it worth it?\" I ask in a soft whisper. \"I don't want you hurt.\"</p><p>The bold young woman reaches out a hand and touches my arm. \"Eventually I'll want kids and stuff, which isn't an option with you... but that's years away. Wild, uncontrollably passionate sex with a friend?\" She winks at me as she turns to leave. \"It's good enough for now.\" Halfway across the landing, she looks back over her shoulder, tossing her spiral curls out of the way. \"Don't worry about tonight. You can make it up to me when I mix up a fresh batch of passion.\"</p><p>Once she's gone, I push away from the wall and a twinge of pain issues from my ribs. Despite resting earlier, I'm drained. Healing from the beating I took will take some time. The failed intimate encounter only reinforces how much I'm not up to par. Six months ago I could have ignored her voice in the heat of the moment and plowed through with my fantasy, but it's becoming more and more difficult to find release lately.</p><p>My thoughts drift back to the man in the bar, Spike. His dark good looks and intense brown eyes watched my every move earlier. While I admit, the idea of being with Dria and Rafe consumes me, I've not thought of being solely with a man. Good God, could I be gay and not know it? I shake my head, confused, and try my best to knock loose the strange scent of the new werewolf from my head.</p><p>The solace of the warm makeshift bed in Dria and Rafe's suite calls to me. I head back there, knowing I've got a few hours to kill before the next stage in the plan, which is setting the fake kill scene.</p><p>The dogs welcome me and we curl up together on the thin mattress. The rare peace of being with my pack cocoons me and I quickly drop off into a light sleep. Sometime later, voices crash into my awareness and I'm pulled from a doze. People mill about the space and Kujo grows restless beside me.</p><p>\"Are you sure it was just one bracelet, Drew?\" I crack open my eyes to see Dria stuffing her arms into a white, fur-lined parka.</p><p>\"Yes, ma'am. She's at the property perimeter, about a mile due west from the apartments.\"</p><p>With a nod in my direction, she pulls on gloves and an insulated hat. \"Let's hope I get to her first and not Stan. The silver in just one of those will render her immobile and defenseless.\" Grabbing a small GPS unit she heads out into the cold. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Vivian</p><p>The shock of the outdoors sends a spike of pain through my forehead. The first inhalalation freezes my nasal passages and tightens my facial skin. Ignoring the happy twinkle of the Christmas lights adorning every bush, statue, and pergola, I race into the deep twilight.</p><p>Soon, the well-traveled asphalt pathway ends and I'm heading over hard-packed snow that's been plowed. The employees don't often walk all the way to the main building, especially this time of year, and the semi-cleared roads work well enough for vehicles. It's close to high noon and the sky is painted with the lingering colors of sunset.</p><p>The fierce beauty of this harsh land is breathtaking, and despite how this dreaded week turns out, I'm still thrilled to be here even after two decades. Once I veer off from the collection of employee buildings, the trek proves more difficult. After a quarter mile, the plowing stops and huge snow banks tower in three directions.</p> <p>I climb to the top of the far one and take out the GPS to orient where I need to go. The air burns in my lungs as I note two blips on the screen. Crap, Stan must have been tracking her pretty close when she skirted the property line.</p><p>Slipping the tracker in my coat, I leap off the snow bank, grasp a nearby branch and drop softly to the ground. The quiet presses in from all sides as I walk and only the sound of my boots crunching through the crust of the snow can be heard. In a matter of minutes, I pass one of the signs indicating the resort's property will come to an end and guests should turn around soon. Did Emiko not see it? They are placed pretty far apart. Were her map markings off or perhaps she lost it?</p><p>I sense a presence and whip around to find Stan walking silently in my footprints. \"Vivian? Is that you?\"</p><p>\"Yes.\"</p><p>\"What are you doing out here?\" His face looks dark in the low light; he really should have worn a facemask like most of the others. \"Joining in the fun?\"</p> <p>Shit. I can't believe I didn't think up a viable excuse on my way here. \"No, I... umm... thought you might have made a kill and was coming to check. Drew reported your and Emiko's signals coming from the same small area.\"</p><p>\"Yeah, I thought I had her.\" He stops in front of me and the skin of his cheeks appears cracked and sore. \"But it's like she's disappeared.\"</p><p>\"I doubt she'd come out this way for long, the triggers to her bracelets start on those trees.\" I point across a small clearing of snow-buried scrub bushes to some trunks in the distance.</p><p>\"If she got too close she'd be stuck in one spot right now, right?\"</p><p>I nod. \"That's the idea.\" She's here somewhere but I need to lead Stan away. \"You haven't come across her lying helpless?\"</p><p>He smiles his big crazy-ass grin, \"Now if I had don't you think I'd be looking a bit bloody? I plan on drinking that bitch dry.\" He laughs at his own joke then shudders from the cold. \"Fuck, it's bad out here.\"</p> <p>\"Look, if you've been scouring the area for a while then she must not have triggered the silver poison in the manacles and she's long gone.\"</p><p>He raises one eyebrow in hope, \"You feel like calling in to confirm that theory so I can search elsewhere?\"</p><p>\"Are you asking me to cheat for you, Stan?\" I say in a sweet, you-don't-really-mean-that tone.</p><p>\"Christ, every time I feel like I get close, she gets away.\"</p><p>I pat him on the back and turn him around, walking side by side with him the way I came. \"At least you're still in the game. You, Stephen, Jet and three of the wolves are all that's left.\"</p><p>\"You'd think with most of us leaving footprints we'd have found her by now.\"</p><p>\"Yeah, but two days with lots of feet and paws running off the trails can make it much harder to discern.\"</p><p>A howling wind whips through the trees. \"Well, if it was easy, it wouldn't be worth it, right?\" he says.</p> <p>I nod my agreement and take my leave when we reach the snow banks at the end of the plowed trail. With a gentle mental push, he buys my excuse that I plan on checking the sensors north of here and we part ways. He's heading back to warm up and plans to head back out when total darkness descends again this afternoon.</p><p>Stan's mention of the footprints has given me an idea. Who would stick to the ground when off a trail and have their whereabouts revealed so easily? If I were hunting, I'd be checking the trees more than anything else. With that thought in mind, I leap up and pull myself into the nearest one. A few steadfast evergreen branches block me from being able to see too far, so I jump to the next tree and start to weave my way back to where I last saw Emiko's blip on the GPS.</p><p>The dark thrill of tracking prey fills me. Sure, it's not a fair rendition of a sanctioned execution when she's paralyzed by silver and I have a tracker on her, but my killer instincts don't care. My pulse quickens as excitement sings through my veins. The challenge of being an enforcer brought the creature within me too close to the surface for my liking. Reveling in the power of taking a semi-immortal life and doling out savage justice can quickly entice even the most stalwart vampire to embrace their inner beast and not look back.</p><p>For every vampire, always locking one's baser nature away becomes harder and harder through the years. A few decide to no longer fight it... those are the minority an enforcer stalks and destroys. Like a rabid dog too far gone for medical help, the best thing to do is put them down.</p><p>With each leap through the faded light, I push myself harder. Each calculated landing becomes whisper soft, barely rustling the branches. Every few jumps I stop and listen, searching for a sound of the poisoned vamp. Then again, what do I expect to hear when she's paralyzed?</p><p>I take out the GPS to verify her location and see I'm pretty much on top of her. An orange hue paints the forest and up ahead I make out a wider shadow on a trunk, mid-way off the ground. A few more hops and I'm standing behind the black-clad enforcer. The branch sags under the additional weight and I step to a lower one to prevent it from snapping.</p><p>Emiko sits with her chest snug against the trunk and her arms wrapped around the trunk in a hug. Wondering how she stayed upright with her arms not dangling, I lean to peer around the other side. Her wrists are bound together, ensuring she won't slide off and plummet to the snow beneath.</p><p>\"Clever,\" I say. \"Or maybe more accurate would be 'innovative'.\" Emiko's face remains hidden behind her black ski mask, but her eyes are open. \"Cat got your tongue? Oh, yes. You tried to flee the property and got zapped? Must not be your first time being silver-poisoned because you had enough sense to climb the tree and bind your hands around the trunk before full paralysis set in.\"</p><p>Not waiting for a response, I slip a folding Spyderco knife out of my pocket and cut the strip of cloth tying her hands. One small push is all it takes to send the petite vampire crashing to the ground. Her body bounces off several smaller limbs in its descent and lands in an ungraceful heap in the snow.</p><p>\"Whoops.\" I don't try to hide the humor in my voice. I like to think of this as two pros meeting face-to-face on the job, where one messes up and gets caught by the cops. Classic idiot move.</p><p>I descend the tree and stand by the assassin face-down in the snow. \"You're lucky it's me and not Stan who found you. He's got a serious hard-on for cutting your heart out and drinking you dry.</p><p>\"I can't be sure, but I think one of the perimeter sensors may have been more sensitive than the others. Perhaps you got too close and it triggered only one bracelet?\" I shake my head. \"Whatever it was, you were lucky.\"</p><p>Reaching down, I drag the limp form up and toss her over my shoulder like a sack of potatoes. \"Personally,\" I begin while trudging through the snow, back toward the apartments, \"I don't think you were trying to escape. You've been running these hunters ragged the whole damn week. Only two and a half more days to go? You don't seem like the type to bolt unless there's no other choice.\"</p><p>I pick up my pace and start to move as fast as the crusted surface will allow. \"I'm taking you to see Margery Cook, our resident doctor. She's got plasma we can use to flush the silver out of your system and get you up and running again.\"</p><p>\"I know you can hear me, so I'm going to tell you what we found out. We know about your husband and his six kids, three of whom are still alive and have wisely pulled back on the court case against you.\" A gentle probe of my mind to hers reveals nothing. I can't discern her thoughts or emotions. Damn, must be the silver blocking me.</p><p>\"We also uncovered the connection between the property, the video will, and two of the drained bodies left on the Tribunal's doorstep. Makes no sense you'd kill off the two key witnesses supporting your claims to your former husband's extensive holdings.</p><p>\"So it got us to thinking-who stands to gain the most with you out of the picture?\"</p><p>I let her stew on this information and continue the rest of the trip in silence. In a little while the six-story, brick apartment building comes into view. The lobby is mercifully empty as I make my way down to the clinic next to the doctor's apartment. The waiting room is unlocked; so I dump the unresisting vampire on the couch and head next door to have the doctor open the exam room.</p><p>A ring of the buzzer brings the auburn-haired physician to the entrance. \"Vivian? What are you doing here? I never see you in the building.\"</p><p>\"I need access to the exam room, plasma, and fresh blood. One of the rogue's manacles was triggered and she's been poisoned with silver.\"</p><p>\"Oh, dear.\" The bespectacled older woman nods, \"I'll open from in here and meet you.\"</p><p>I head back the way I came and wait. In a brief moment, the doctor's head peeps around a metal door leading deeper into the clinic. \"Come on back while I get things ready.\"</p><p>\"Alley-oop,\" I say while hoisting the limp woman into my arms. I don't like that I can't read her mind. There are still unanswered questions regarding how deeply she's involved in the plot. I could kick myself for thinking my enemies in Argentina could let an opportunity pass to dig up dirt on me. The past is the past; I wish they'd realize that. No need harping over what can't be changed. Best to move forward and make the best of things.</p><p>I lay Emiko down on an examination table with the back end raised. With her head and heart elevated, a flush should work well.</p><p>\"How much silver is in her system?\" the doctor asks.</p><p>\"Ten CC's.\"</p><p>\"Double that and she'd be in a coma. Even five flushes might not have helped.\"</p><p>\"That was the idea.\" At the doctor's shocked expression I shrug, \"She's dangerous, Margery. We couldn't take a chance.\"</p><p>\"Let's start with the plasma and see how she progresses.\" The doctor hangs a full, pale yellow bag on an IV pole and gets the drip started in Emiko's left arm. Outgoing tubing is inserted in her right arm and drains into a very large, empty pouch.</p><p>How much do I reveal to the motionless vampire? Should I tell her of our plan to stage her death or keep her here out of the way while we try to save her from the Tribunal's corruption?</p><p>\"How much human blood do you have on hand here?\" I ask.</p><p>\"Quite a bit. Since the seethe has grown, we've been taking pints from employees like you instructed. Let me check the fridge.\" She bustles over to see and a thought occurs to me-I can't leave Emiko here as she is while she's recovering. She could hurt the doctor or any of the employees for that matter. \"Twenty units. We're good to go.\"</p><p>I nod while stepping away for a moment. I open up a mental connection with my husband. Rafe, can you grab a set of the cloth-covered silver chains we've got in the dungeon room?</p><p>Planning a little fun I don't know about?</p><p>Nah, I want to secure Emiko while she's getting the poison flushed out. I don't trust her here while she's healing.</p><p>I take it you made it safely to the doctor's with her? No problems?</p><p>I ran into Stan, but other than that, no. I told him Emiko was nowhere in the vicinity and he went off in another direction.</p><p>Okay. I'll have Paul bring the chains up.</p><p>Thanks, my love.</p><p>A glance back over my shoulder reveals the Asian vampire still hasn't moved. The bag to the right is slowly filling with her tainted blood and the first pint of plasma looks half-gone already. \"Dr. Cook, she'll need to be restrained.\"</p><p>\"This one? She's not going to be able to move for hours.\"</p><p>\"I'm not taking any chances. The chains go on whether you like it or not.\"</p><p>A sigh comes from the fifty-something physician, \"Fine. You going to tell me how to do my job next, too?\"</p><p>I smile at the woman's brashness; she's the one of the few humans on the property who would even think of giving me attitude. \"You mean I might know something more about vampire physiology than a human?\" Her head whips around and she shoots me a glare. \"I wouldn't dream of it.\"</p><p>\"I'll be back in ten. I left some tea to steep.\" As she leaves through the connecting door, she mumbles something close to \"redheaded smart ass\" under her breath. I'm alone with Emiko and the drip of the plasma and her infected blood is the only sound in the tight space of the examining room.</p><p>\"For the record, I really don't think you were trying to escape. Like I said, it makes no sense when you were clearly ahead of the game against the hunters.\" I lean over the prone form of the rogue and peel up her ski mask. Smooth, pale gold skin stretched across a broad face with delicate features comes into view. Her dark-brown, almond-shaped eyes are no longer locked in place, but fixed on my face. \"The full paralysis could take hours to wear off, but it looks like your eyes are able to track.\"</p><p>I settle on the edge of the table so she can still see me while I talk. \"I've got things I need to do and I'm going to have to restrain you for the safety of my employees. Not that I think you'll launch off the table and suck them dry, but I'm not willing to take a chance.</p><p>\"I heard about you carving up Sanji. Interesting method you chose in which to communicate. Did you know the same technique of thirteen strokes for 'guilty' was used on an Ancient several centuries ago? Although, from the story I heard, there was only the one word carved and not two. It was never proven-the body turned to ash in the sun.\"</p><p>I let that little detail sink in, seeing her eyes widen slightly in understanding. Yes, I just admitted in a round-about way to killing an Ancient and carving into his flesh first, but it's her word against mine if it ever were to come out. Besides, if I play this right she might wind up here in our seethe after this whole debacle ends.</p><p>\"Asa said you wanted to talk with me, but I fear this whole adventure will be over before you have a chance. Could it be you are truly a pawn in this whole setup? That the crimes were charged against you conveniently when we put our request in to 'buy' a rogue for this expedition?\"</p><p>I stare off in the distance, trying once again to reach into her mind. The silver still repulses me and I can't break through. \"Or could it be that someone in the Inner Circle really wants your valuable property for their own gain?\" I tap a finger to my lip. \"I don't know. And it's driving me crazy.\"</p><p>I leave my perch and pace back and forth in her field of vision, her eyes tracking me the whole time. \"If you are innocent, at least of the crimes they're charging you with, I would love to thwart their plans for inheriting your holdings.</p><p>\"Interesting loophole in vampiric society, isn't it? The one to kill you drinks your blood and inherits your wealth.\" The room's dimensions only allow for three paces before I have to turn, hindering my preference of walking and talking out my thoughts. \"Certainly paints a target on the back of any vampire master with no seethe to stand behind them... especially one so close to a crumbling governing body in desperate need of funds.\"</p><p>I pause in my pacing and note the plasma bag is almost empty. Foregoing sterile alcohol wipes or sanitary gloves, I wait 'til it's done and change it out for a fresh one. \"You worked so hard to get to where you were, didn't you?\" I glance to her eyes for answer; they still remain locked on me, no hint of emotion in the dark depths. \"Why try to draw out my man, Asa, with the sword display and sliced words? Did you think the forced sex in the bowling alley would make him susceptible to your pleas?\"</p><p>The minutes tick by in silence and I swap out the bag once more, waving the good doctor back into her suite twice to finish her tea and relax. I don't want her privy to what's being said and make her a possible target later because of the knowledge.</p><p>\"Twelve years in silver was your sentence, yes?\" I'm getting annoyed I can't read her. \"Blink once for 'yes' and twice for 'no'.\" Emiko blinks once. \"Any idea what would have happened to your accumulated wealth while imprisoned?\" Two blinks. I smile. \"Without a seethe, the Tribunal appoints someone to 'manage' it in your absence. Convenient, huh?\" No response, but it was rhetorical anyway.</p><p>\"Bet you can figure out that if the Tribunal had a need, your estate would be 'donating for the cause' on your behalf.\" Worry and tension plague me. To think some stupid little hunt planned at the urging of guests and my seethe could turn into such a mess. I pace again, the conflict boiling up inside me. Coraline, of all people, sent to deliver the fugitive? It can't be a coincidence. The woman has hated me for centuries and would do anything to dig up dirt on me.</p><p>What has she been doing while the hunt is going on? Has she truly been occupied with her guards in the fun rooms or has she been picking through the brains of my staff looking for angles against me? Fear grips my heart as I start to think back. How many of the employees have ever been involved with one of my projected illusions? As far as I can recall, it's been very few. I've only used the glamour-induced sex fantasies on the clientele. The anxiety I felt when Ivan threatened the individual safety of the people I protect is nothing compared to what I feel right now. Everything could crumble around me in a tangle of body parts and lies.</p><p>Coraline could trigger a domino effect within the council, exposing every secret I've kept hidden from my kind. The last manipulator? Try the biggest organized hunt across the globe our kind has ever seen. I'd be hunted like a damn dog and nothing would ever be the same again.</p><p>The anger within rises and I try to calm down. The Tribunal corruption started slowly from the bottom, creeping up little by little over the decades, until I'm not even sure if the eleven Ancients were aware there were two factions in their midst-those who skitter close to the black pit within their souls and those who have already fallen prey to the monster, but hide it well.</p><p>There's a knock behind me. I sense Paul in the hall, no doubt with the chains in his possession. Opening the metal door, I usher the chef in. I speak to Emiko like the last minute wasn't filled with silence, \"What it really comes down to is trust,\" I say to her. Taking the cloth covered silver chains from Paul's gloved hands, I turn back to the immobile vampire. \"And I'm not the trusting sort.\"</p><p>Her face is still paralyzed, but her eyes reveal more expression than when I first uncovered her in the snow. It's hard to discern if it's fear I see swirling in their depths, or cold detachment and calculation. Am I being paranoid? Would a healing vampire, fully infused with fresh human blood, turn on the people under my care?</p><p>As I drape a thin chain over her chest, I find I can't be bothered with arguing the point within myself. This week has turned out to be much more than I bargained for, more than any of us could have foreseen. Trust the facts or follow your instincts? Until I can confirm exactly what is going on with this woman and her setup with the Tribunal, I'm happy remaining on the side of extreme caution.</p><p>Not having a lock to secure the chains under the table, I rummage around in the medical drawers looking for something to attach them. Long plastic zip strips, used for God knows what in a clinic, will work nicely. Sliding back the black fabric at the end of the chain, I slip the sturdy plastic through a link, careful to avoid contact with the draining metal.</p><p>\"Want me to get under the table and attach them?\" Paul asks.</p><p>I shake my head before crouching down and repeating the steps on the dangling portion hanging past the other side of the elevated end of the table. One slight touch and a painful burn slides up my right index finger. I jerk away, cursing myself for not at least wearing latex gloves.</p><p>\"You okay down there? Something smells bad.\"</p><p>\"Fine,\" I grind out through gritted teeth. The plastic threads through the intended link and I secure the chain tightly under the table. I scramble out and take the next strand of silver from Paul. This one I loop first around the left wrist, then the right, wrapping the length over and over before binding the ends with another plastic tie.</p><p>I continue with the same method on her feet. When I'm done, she looks like something out of an old Spy vs Spy comic. The black-wearing spy trussed up with black cord, but in this case it's with silver hidden under the fabric.</p><p>\"Good job,\" says Paul. \"Think it will hold her?\"</p><p>\"It should.\"</p><p>\"Would it hold you?\"</p><p>Odd he would ask me that. Is he curious or still learning the bounds of what we can do as vampires?</p><p>I project to his mind, preferring not to answer aloud in front of Emiko. It would hold me physically, if you get my drift. No vampire is strong enough to break that much silver.</p><p>He bobs his head once in understanding and looks across the room. Dr. Cook comes back in. She examines the full drainage bag and pulls gloves on to swap it for a fresh one.</p><p>\"This flush will take all the plasma we've got and still might not be enough,\" she says.</p><p>\"Switch to blood when you run out,\" I say. \"Ten pints in the average body, right?\"</p><p>She nods. \"But from my experience, your breed takes more.\"</p><p>\"Really?\" says Paul. \"Like how much more?\"</p><p>Margery looks to me and I answer, \"About thirty to forty percent. We've got enough blood on hand. We might as well use some to flush the poison as well.\"</p><p>A tingle of sensation heralds my husband's mental voice piping into my thoughts, Hon, we're about to start staging the scene. You need to be here for this, right?</p><p>Yeah, I check the time to see it's close to three. I'll be there in a few.</p><p>\"Dr. Cook?\" I ask. \"You can handle the rest from here?\"</p><p>\"Yes, dear. I'll call you if I encounter any problems.\"</p><p>Paul and I leave the clinic with the full bag of poisoned blood, and I inform him the group is ready to prepare the fight scene.</p><p>\"What will I be doing?\" he asks.</p><p>\"Why, you'll be the dead Emiko, of course.\" The smile on my face must look gruesome because he turns about two shades of green. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Rafe</p><p>The SCIF room in the basement is currently unmanned while Drew and Asa help to prepare the fake kill spot. We've scouted locations and settled on the northern-most point on the property, near the windmill field. A dozen self-heated windmills churn in the Arctic air, gathering power for the vast resort.</p><p>After a brief connection with Dria to let her and Paul know where to find us, I decide to throw myself into this part of the plan with some fun. I deserve to let off a little steam after having to endure the sickly-sweet and stabbing comments from Coraline in the bar. God, that woman is annoying.</p><p>Drew and Asa stand close together, examining the spot we picked. Asa drops the bag with the weapons in it at his feet. Without warning, I run full tilt at their unsuspecting backs and knock them face-first into the ice-crusted snow. A full belly laugh rips from my throat and I spring off them, awaiting retaliation.</p> <p>\"Come on, you two. Lighten up. We have to make it look like an actual fight took place-\"</p><p>Asa barrels into me and launches us both back several feet to land on a snow-mounded, scrub bush. His features are hidden behind a white ski mask, but mirth dances in his dark blue eyes. \"You mean like that, boss?\"</p><p>I laugh again and put two feet between us to shove the vampire off. \"Here, Drew-catch!\" I push as hard as I can and Asa's muscled form sails through the air. Instead of catching him, Drew decides to side step and let's his seethe-mate crash in a heap.</p><p>\"Won't it look suspicious if we'll all caked in snow when the Tribunal member shows up?\" Drew asks, a faint trace of annoyance in his voice as tries to brush the snow off himself.</p><p>Asa stands up. \"Who put the stick up your ass? We're supposed to look like we fought her.\"</p> <p>The little bit of sunset light we had earlier is gone and the patch of field we picked lies at the farthest reach of the security lights close to the last windmill. The bite of the cold and the tackling brings a carefree moment to the week and I don't intend to let lanky, big-nosed Drew ruin it for me. I nod my head at Asa, who takes up a spot behind the other vampire.</p><p>\"Lighten up, Drew,\" I say while extended an open hand to him in an offer to shake. \"Life doesn't always have to be so serious.\" He reaches for my hand as Asa silently kneels down behind his legs. I reverse my hand right before Drew clasps it and push him square in the chest. He tumbles back over Asa's bent form to land flat on his back.</p><p>Our combined laughter rings out across the half-lit space, to be quickly swallowed by the howling wind. \"Oh my God, dude,\" Asa begins when Drew gets back to his feet. \"You looked like such an ass.\"</p><p>Pouring on the vamp speed, Drew lunges upright and races at me like a small, agile receiver-turned-lineman and I'm the quarterback holding the ball. The force of his impact sends us farther than before and I have no doubt we're successfully making the area look like it's seen a battle.</p><p>Back and forth, we knock each other over and more than once I get a dousing of snow down my back. In a few minutes, Dria and Paul step into the picture and I'm sure they heard our laughter way before they reached us.</p><p>Dria looks dashing as always in her white, fur-lined long coat, red hair billowing under her facemask and past her shoulders. Paul stands slightly dejected at missing all the fun. Asa rams him for good measure and the chef soon lies stunned, on top of another squished bush. He comes up smiling and whips an ice ball at the other vamp's head.</p> <p>My wife surveys the scene with a critical eye. \"Looks good. Now we just need to add some blood,\" she says while holding a dark medical-type pouch high, \"and a severed head.\"</p><p>Paul's laughter at being included in the fun quickly dies out mid-chuckle. \"Where are we getting a head?\"</p><p>\"Illusion, remember?\" Vivian motions to the base surrounding the nearest windmill. \"Go grab a head-sized brick. I'll do the rest.\"</p><p>Paul removes himself from the bush and goes to find a suitable 'head'. Asa rips off his facemask and begins flapping it to shake the snow from the surface. \"Is Coraline really going to buy that I could be the one to kill Emiko?\"</p><p>I clear my throat. \"I let it slip that she raped you after we discussed Vivian's rightful killing of Vikram.\"</p><p>Asa voice comes out heated and high-pitched, \"I never said she raped me.\"</p><p>Dria pats the younger vampire on the cheek. \"You never said 'yes', did you?\"</p><p>\"Well, no, of course I wouldn't have agreed to have her mount me like monkey in the damn bowling alley.\"</p> <p>\"She didn't give you much choice, did she?\" Dria asks.</p><p>Asa's face shuts down and he slips his ski mask back on. \"Whatever.\"</p><p>Surprisingly, it's Drew who comments next. \"You can't control your body's reaction to stimulus. Just be thankful she wasn't a man.\"</p><p>\"I bet he would have fought harder if it was a man,\" Paul says. Dria shoots him a look and Drew punches him in the arm. \"What? It's obvious, right?\"</p><p>Asa stalks to the edge of the clearing and faces away from us, clearly unwilling to have the conversation continue.</p><p>Drew says in a quiet voice, \"Paul, it wouldn't have made a difference. Don't you get it?\" The wavy-haired vampire shakes his head and looks toward Asa. \"It just would have been much worse if it were a man.\"</p><p>\"Can we get back on track, please?\" I say. \"Tommy called me a little bit ago. Stan, Jet, and all the Weres left in the hunt are in the dining room right now warming up. Coraline was last seen talking to Stan.</p><p>\"With the way she was drilling me for information, she's got to know by now that Vivian went out in the cold to check the silver sensors. I'm sure-given the right encouragement-Stan will tell Cora anything she wants to know. The whole point to telling the council member about Asa was so she could have a reason to believe he's the one who beheads Emiko.\"</p><p>Asa whips back around to join in the conversation, \"Yeah, I get it now. But let's face the facts-could I really have been capable of killing her on my own? Will Coraline buy it?\" He snorts. \"Hell, I'm not so sure I would.\"</p><p>\"Which is why,\" Dria says, \"you'll be paired up in the killing with Drew.\"</p><p>Drew straightens a bit. \"Good addition. After all, I did kill Ivan.\"</p><p>I dart a glance at my wife, certain she might betray a slip of a smile at the boldness he's showing. She had to practically push him into the act, now he makes it sound like he was into it all along. Her practiced calm is in place and through our connection I feel she's amused.</p><p>Dria whips out the folding knife she keeps handy and slices the top of the blood bag open. The coppery smell of fresh pennies wafts up through the cold air. \"Let's start tossing this around to make the site look more legit.\"</p><p>Paul's teeth lengthen and he clamps a gloved hand over his mouth. His eyes close briefly in shame and he takes a moment to collect himself. \"I'm sorry,\" he mutters from under his glove. \"That smells really good.\"</p><p>\"The silver isn't detectable by scent, but it is by taste. This stuff has so much silver in it, one drop in your mouth and you'd know instantly something was off.\" She hands the bag to Drew. \"Put some on both of you as well, and tear your coats. She wouldn't go down without a fight.\"</p><p>I pull my wife to the side while the three vampires take out weapons from the bag Asa brought, pour blood on the blades and fling the droplets across the tramped snow. I'm sensing some discord in your mind. Are you having second thoughts?</p><p>The plan is sound. I just feel like there are too many things still unspoken.</p><p>All the evidence points to Emiko being set up, correct?</p><p>Yes.</p><p>Well then, what is it?</p><p>I couldn't read her because of the silver poison. I anticipated we'd talk and I'd find out what was truly going on.</p><p>You're assuming she'd have something more to add to what we already know. My wife nods. But what if there is nothing else to know? She could be just as blind as to why she's been dragged into this as we initially were.</p><p>Dria begins to pace across the clearing. Since it tamps some of the spilled blood in place and makes the scene look better, I don't bother to stop her. I can sense tension coiling in her, reminding me of a cobra about to strike. Don't you need to calm down if you plan to cast an illusion this big?</p><p>She whips back to face me. My wife's expression is hidden behind her ski mask, but her green eyes snap with anger. \"Paul, lay down in the snow. Be very still.\"</p><p>\"What?\" he stammers. \"Right now?\" One cold look from Dria has him scrambling to obey. \"Is this spot good?\"</p><p>She doesn't answer him. \"Asa, bury his head in snow. Drew pour some more of the blood on that brick and then dribble some all over the snow where his neck is. Paul, don't swallow any or you'll get sick.\"</p><p>Lie still and don't swallow? Paul flays his arms and grunts. Sounds like direction in a badly-filmed porn.</p><p>We all laugh at his observation, except for my wife. Dria has opened the link between the seethe members once again, and those of us who can focus enough to build up a thin personal wall, do.</p><p>Dria paces to the edge of the clearing and goes still. I can tell by reading her mind she's starting to lay the glamour in her thoughts. Once she's ready, she'll project it to the scene and hold it in place with her concentration.</p><p>In an instant, the stench of death fills the clearing. The unglamorous side not often revealed in movie and TV shows. Blood, urine, feces, and the stench of meat gone slightly bad wafts upward... it's enough to make one lose their appetite for hours. The rank smells cling to the insides of my nasal passages, forcing me to breathe through parted lips.</p><p>Asa's voice cracks across the clearing, shattering some of the hold the spell has on me, \"You might be overdoing it a bit, Vivian. Sanji's death scene didn't smell this bad.\"</p><p>The cloud of death lessens a bit and the layered image of destruction fleshes out. The cleanly-sliced skin near Paul's neck transforms before our eyes to take on a more feminine size. His body shrinks in appearance and changes to the slim, black-cloaked, tiny frame of the deadly ex-enforcer.</p><p>The brick-like paver stone covered in blood turns into Emiko's severed head, complete with the face mask pulled up to reveal her delicate, smooth features frozen in death. The stub of her neck lies in a bloody patch of snow and long black hair trails behind, resting limp on the trampled ground.</p><p>\"How does it look?\" Dria asks.</p><p>\"Scarily real,\" Asa says with a shake of his head.</p><p>\"Excellent,\" says Drew, a note of awe in his voice.</p><p>\"How do you plan on dealing with the heart removal part?\" I say while gesturing to Paul's chest. The young vampire twitches, drawing a smile from me.</p><p>\"Make a small snowball using some red snow. When it comes time for Asa to finish the kill, he'll use the handle of his silver knife and motion like he's cutting her heart out.\" Dria says it all so matter-of-factly it all seems to make perfect sense.</p><p>The tension and fear I have coiling in my gut over whether this illusion is the best thing to do shrinks a little. But it's still there. We're taking a huge risk. And all for what? Some Asian assassin we don't know well, but who has been used as a pawn by those she trusted? Dria's end game, when Cora and her crew leave, is to offer Emiko a chance to join our seethe. It might work as a viable option to the ex-enforcer. Or it might be tossed back in our faces and then what the hell do we do with Emiko?</p><p>Dria ends the illusion and touches my arm, strengthening our connection and effectively cutting out the others for a brief moment. She can always refuse and change her identity. It's a big world and as long as she avoids the Tribunal she'll be fine.</p><p>And that worked for you so well, right?</p><p>Hey, I managed to avoid them for a few hundred years.</p><p>Yes, but they always knew you lived... and were out there somewhere.</p><p>Good point. But they never connected me with Ceara, the young vampire killed in Mikov's seethe centuries ago. The fire that swept the whole compound remains one of many unsolved large executions throughout the recorded history of my kind.</p><p>You're too recognizable now, I say. There is no way you could pull such a disappearing act again.</p><p>Dria turns to look at the mock battle scene. Let's hope we never have to find out. \"Asa, place the call to Jon. It's time to lead Coraline to the scene.\" </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Asa</p><p>\"Jon. We're ready,\" I say into the black receiver.</p><p>\"Good. I'll be there with her in exactly twenty minutes.\"</p><p>Curiosity gets the best of me, \"How can you be so sure?\"</p> <p>\"Apparently, these old bitches really like Were-blood. And one thing I can do is turn on the charm when I have to.\"</p><p>Grateful for the military precision, I'm not going to question his faulty logic any further. If the werewolf thinks he can get her here on time, then I'll take his word for it. I click off and shove the phone into my pocket. \"Jon says they'll be here in twenty minutes.\"</p><p>\"Good,\" my boss says as she turns to examine the setup once more. I'm not ashamed to admit her illusions scare the ever-loving crap out of me. I would swear in a court of law, what I saw earlier was real. Unless she was to pull it away mid-way through, I can't see how anyone could see through such detail.</p><p>Anxiety roils in my gut as the minutes tick by. In an attempt to shut out Paul's endless stream of mental complaints, my guarded thoughts drift back to Eric. Seeing my brother gave me a sense of purpose again. I wonder if lesser seethe members can go on trips away from the 'family'? Does Eric even see our dad anymore? Could I risk it now that Brett knows about the supernatural side of the world?</p><p>Now is not the time to ask, but the money I've earned this week will be more than enough to help me travel back and forth to the east coast in safety several dozen times. Where the hell did his wolf pack hail from again? Wasn't it some remote location in Canada? Images of hanging out with Pat and Eric, drinking beer, and shooting the shit fill me. Tension flows out of my body as I realize I can do this.</p> <p>It may not be the Army, it may not be serving our country for the greater good, but it's all I have and I might as well make the best of it. A smile curves my lips as I think of my balding father barking out an old favorite bit of advice, \"How's bitching about it going to help? Shut up and do something.\"</p><p>\"Two minutes,\" calls out Drew.</p><p>\"Rafe,\" Vivian says in a soft voice, \"stand off to the side and out of the direct scene. She'll want to get up-close and personal with the corpse. Drew, move into position by Asa with your bloody sword drawn.\"</p><p>My boss projects the illusion; soon the partially-destroyed clearing takes on the vibe and very real feel of death again. Every sense in my body screams it's true, even though my mind knows different. Can other vampires cast complex glamours like this or is it rare? Before I have a chance to dwell any longer on the horrifying thought, Vivian motions me to take up position next to Paul's transformed body.</p><p>In a moment, Jon and Coraline enter the semi-darkness surrounding our group. \"One of your seethe killed her?\" the blond says while stalking closer to the criminal. \"I think this breaks the rules. The idea wasn't for your happy little snow-bound group armed with GPS locators to kill the rogue.\" She snorts in disapproval. \"Seems rather unsportsmanlike, all things considered.\"</p><p>\"I had no choice,\" I say. \"She attacked me again and I wasn't in the mood to be another snack.\" The small woman smirks while her eyes travel over me head to foot. The all-too-new tingle of fear skitters up my back, putting my senses on high alert. I will not be another random victim to some old vamp with a taste for blood from their own kind.</p> <p>Rafe's voice breaks into my thoughts, She's messing with you. Chill.</p><p>I take a deep breath and rest a hand on the butt of my revolver.</p><p>\"We were scouting together,\" Drew adds. \"When she leaped on him I couldn't stand by and... watch it happen.\"</p><p>Cora kneels in the bloody snow next to the body, her long leather coat fanning out behind her. \"I still don't like it. We may have to talk with the Tribunal to determine a fair outcome.\" She glances over her shoulder at me. \"Why haven't you cut out her heart yet?\"</p><p>Vivian answers, \"I thought you might want to bear witness for the last step.\"</p><p>The tiny blond woman stands and shakes out her coat. \"True.\" She nods my way. \"The body looks drained already, might as well finish the job.\"</p><p>I whip out my silver dagger, brushing the thigh holster for my Smith and Wesson 500 on the way. Kneeling down over the headless body, I turn the blade at the last moment, hiding it along my forearm, and mimic the strokes of cutting out the undead heart with the handle. Gaping flesh appears beneath the blunt end and I mime cutting through the rib cage. Paul has thankfully quieted his previous ongoing mental litany and remains perfectly still throughout the procedure.</p><p>\"Will you be bringing the body home with you via the plane or leaving it here for us to dispose of?\" Vivian effectively distracts Cora from watching at the crucial point where I slip the red snow ball into my fist to mimic the removed heart.</p> <p>\"Do you have any idea of how long we're in that little plane and how many times we must stop to refuel?\" The council member shudders and shakes her head. \"No thanks. Burn her heart and bury the body whenever this frozen hell will allow you.\"</p><p>A collective sigh of relief goes through the seethe's mental connection. We'd all worried what to do if she chose to bring the body back with her; unlikely though it was, it was still a risk. I suggested packing the mutilated Sanji and it was agreed she was the only viable option if we had to provide a corpse.</p><p>Cora watches as I slip the heart into a pre-bloodied brown bag, which appears clean at the moment. Blood slowly blooms across the paper; the effects of the illusion are fascinating to behold even when I know they're false. Vivian doesn't leave even the smallest detail unaccounted for. Rafe's phone rings and he steps off to the side to answer it.</p><p>Dr. Cook's raised voice can unmistakably be heard coming through the connection by every undead in the clearing, \"She slipped the chains like Houdini while the last bag was attached.\"</p><p>Just then, a soft electric whir brings me around and I see a black shadow at the edge of the clearing, bordering the woods. Recognizing the sound of a digital camera lens retracting and realizing it's got to be Emiko taking pictures of our staged scene, I reach for my gun. Logically, it makes sense that no telepathic illusion can be picked up on camera. Our staged scene will appear in the image exactly as it is-fake.</p><p>My 500 clears the holster in the best vampiric imitation of Bob Munden the world will never see and I squeeze off two shots in rapid succession. The first lands its mark as the reflexes of the ninja prove no match for my increased accuracy since turning. The report from the gunfire distracts Vivian and her detailed illusion wavers.</p><p>For a split-second, it's Paul's decidedly masculine form lying in the snow and not the petite fugitive. Cora's face mottles with rage while Vivian struggles to maintain the glamour. \"I knew it!\" she screams while launching across his body toward my boss.</p><p>Her power lashes out and our trampled patch of snow fills with energy. My gut roils and my knees go weak. Paul shrieks as Cora yells, \"You're a manipulator! No one else could cast such an illusion to another vampire!\" The blond council member tackles Vivian and Rafe lunges to his wife's aid.</p><p>I'm not sure what a manipulator is, but I intend to find out later. Time seems to freeze for an instant as the fight drains out of Cora and she slumps to the side. Vivian's mental shields drop for a few seconds, and through our connection I'm able to see directly into her mind. A twisting path of shapes, like the colored tubes of a Habitrail, writhe together over a gaping abyss of something... something that feels very evil.</p><p>Flashes of brutal slayings and barely-leashed serial-killer thoughts sear into my brain. Headless corpses stacked up and burning like kindling in an old barn. The twisted bodies of drained children, a dripping blade held over a hacked up, and dead male vampire. Shock reverberates through my soul as I try to wrap my mind around what I'm seeing.</p><p>Run! Screams my inner voice of reason. Get the hell away from her!</p><p>A calming energy pours over the concentrated darkness and I recognize Rafe's mental signature as the flow of access to Vivian's mind closes. The redhead's extreme focus arrows in on the other woman as she stares intently at Coraline's face. Right before our eyes the bright blue pin attached to the council member's leather lapel turns black.</p><p>\"Did you see that?\" asks Drew.</p><p>\"It's a detection charm,\" says Jon. \"I've seen charms like it before for other things.\"</p><p>\"No, I meant the other stuff,\" he says, his voice hollow.</p><p>Paul brushes the snow and frozen blood from his face. \"Why isn't Coraline moving? What did you do to her?\"</p><p>\"Christ! Don't stand around like fools!\" screams Rafe. \"After Emiko!\" He rips the brooch off the woman's coat, breaking the backing in his haste.</p><p>Paul scrambles up and darts off with Drew into the darkness after the rogue. I take out my GPS to save time by tracking her before running off blind.</p><p>\"I can handle Coraline,\" Vivian says to her husband.</p><p>Dr. Cook calls out to Rafe and he looks at the forgotten phone in his hand. He places it back to his ear and she tells him the two silver manacles are also lying in her exam room. \"Nothing is cut or broken,\" her shaky voice relates. \"I don't know how she did it.\"</p><p>He ends the call and looks to me. \"The GPS will be useless.\"</p><p>\"Shit,\" I say. \"Where do you think she'd go?\"</p><p>Vivian's steady voice issues from her position staring into the council member's mesmerized eyes, \"Same place I'd go when surrounded by a vast frozen tundra with no way out on foot-the airstrip.\" </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Drew</p><p>I knew ninjas were tricky bastards, notorious for eluding capture and executing heroic escapes, but I never would have thought a poisoned one could wiggle out of silver chains. I bet Vivian didn't bargain on it, either.</p><p>My mind reels in turmoil as we race through the dark. A few random footprints where Emiko took our picture were all we had to start the trail. Drops of her blood litter the base of a tree here and there, but the trail appears random. The pines are dense in this area, requiring us to slow our speed so we don't run into them.</p><p>Is Vivian a manipulator? I'd heard stories from my old seethe about a mutation in the bloodline that allowed a vampire to control another vampire. The mutations supposedly occurred frequently many centuries before my time. I wasn't sure I believed the elders, taking the repeated tales for the powerful undead as myth and exaggeration. One person even likened it to a human born with a necromancer gene and that perhaps the virus, which makes us semi-immortal, mutates when it combines with the dormant trait.</p> <p>But, they also said every manipulator has been killed upon discovery; the trackers wore cloth-lined silver caps to thwart the dangerous ability of their prey.</p><p>The trees whiz by as both Paul and I silently scan the darkness for traces of blood. Footprints in the snow appear every now and then; but not enough to indicate she's running. Could she be jumping from trunk to trunk and hanging onto the trees to prevent a visible trail? We trudge on, as fast as we can, not knowing where the injured vampire might be headed.</p><p>What does this new development with my master mean for me? Will she confirm my suspicions or deny them? Could she alter my memories and I wouldn't know it? The idea of a detection charm was clever, but it can't be the only fail-safe idea Coraline's inner group came up with. Taking the charm from the Tribunal member and convincing her she never had it will only keep suspicion off Vivian until the curly-haired vamp reports back to her co-conspirators.</p><p>They will surely know what a missing charm and a spotty recollection will mean. What's next? Will our haven in the Arctic and my new relationship with Chelly be ruined before I've had even a few months to enjoy either?</p><p>Rage starts to spill into my blood, increasing my slow pulse to a pounding in my ears. It wasn't enough to lose Angie? I might lose my new home and what I'm building with Chelly, too? The adrenaline in a vampire magnifies the fight-or-flight human instinct to dangerous proportions. I welcome the shaky focus it gives me and embrace the desire coursing through my veins to kill in order to protect what is mine. I wandered for eighteen months before I found this place, I don't intend to run any more.</p> <p>The blood trail angles toward the apartments and soon dies away to nothing. We pace back and forth through the woods, scanning for a trace of Emiko. With nothing to guide our way, Paul and I are left to continue on instinct.</p><p>\"Do you think she's dumb enough to head back to the apartments for fresh blood?\" Paul asks.</p><p>\"It looks like the last blood drop in the snow confirms if she was intending to go back there, it certainly wasn't direct.\"</p><p>\"Would she try and take a circuitous route to confuse us?\"</p><p>\"Can't say. Up ahead,\" I point. \"Do you see those indentations in the snow?\" We jog forward and see a series of footprints. \"She seems to be running flat out now, wherever she's going.\" Just then it hits me. She's heading for the damn planes. Safe to assume when you've lived 250 years you've probably had time to master how to fly a plane.</p><p>\"What do you think that thing Vivian did back in the clearing was?\" The fear in Paul's voice too closely resembles the emotion I've got brewing in the pit of my stomach. \"Did you see the dead children in her head?\"</p> <p>\"She didn't kill them,\" I say quickly. \"She killed their predator.\" The images crawl back into my mind and the rage she felt in the moment engulfs my senses. So much anger and hate. I push it back as best I can, determined to focus on the here and now and not some distant past swirling around in my master's brain. \"Let's talk about it later and stay on task. I think Emiko's headed for the airstrip.\" I grab my phone to notify the others and find the screen blank. \"Dammit, battery's dead. Is your cell working?\"</p><p>Paul pats his pockets. \"Shit. Must have fallen out be back in the clearing. I can't find it.\"</p><p>I reach out with my mind....</p><p>And touch no one, not even Paul.</p><p>The mental shield Rafe threw in place must be blocking us all while Vivian plays in Coraline's head. Once again, the implications of what she's doing and what she can do scare the hell out of me. Will they come for her? Will the council hunt us all down for being in the seethe of a manipulator?</p><p>Paul nudges my shoulder and motions down the trail, \"Let's go.\"</p><p>We quicken our pace and see a few large patches of flattened snow. \"She must be weak,\" I say in a cloud of vapor, my breath freezing in the air before us. \"This marks the fourth time she's stumbled.\" In a hundred yards, the footprints disappear altogether.</p><p>\"She'll be slower while she's still trying to hide her trail,\" Paul says.</p> <p>\"Let's get there as fast as we can and try to come up with a way to slow her down. Maybe one of us can get to a phone in the hangar and call the rest of the seethe.\"</p><p>The airstrip lies about a mile north and to the east. We race through the darkness with only the puffs from our infrequent breaths giving us away. I'd rather not be paired up with Paul when facing down Emiko, I doubt he can fight... but two has got to be better than one.</p><p>The sound of my neck breaking in the peace of the greenhouse still haunts me. This woman is deadlier than anyone I've ever fought. Will the two of us be enough to take her?</p><p>My own past leaves my fight skills wanting. Sure, I was trained in fencing while growing up, but that didn't prepare me for much when I changed. My first master, the Whitechapel serial killer, liked his prey weak and vulnerable, getting off on their fear. With his superior strength and position of rank, his victims never fought back. He told me he avoided encounters with other vampires and when he turned me I noted quickly that his fight skills were mediocre at best-not much help in training me to defend against my fellow undead.</p><p>However, he did master the element of surprise, which might be our only way to slow Emiko down. The large dark mound of the corrugated steel hangar comes into view. I raise a hand to indicate a halt and, thankfully, the inexperienced vampire sees it and understands.</p><p>Security lights dot the corners of the building, their glow a welcome respite from the woods. Two other structures lie farther away and a rope links a far door of the hangar to a nearby low building with lights on. The ropes are used to navigate short paths by hand during storms. What may seem like a straight walk between two buildings can become a death trap in the right weather conditions.</p><p>Paul shivers in the cold, wrapping an arm around his middle. \"There should only be a skeleton crew up here, right?\"</p><p>\"Yes,\" I answer, recalling the change in the normal weekly schedule. \"We weren't planning on anyone landing during the expedition, so there should be just two in there right now.\"</p><p>\"Do you think she'd go in for blood because of the injury or head straight for the planes?\"</p><p>\"We didn't find a bullet dug out on the way.\" I stomp some circulation back into my feet. \"I'm guessing the shot was a through-and-through. Either way, I'd run first.\"</p><p>Paul scans the area around the two closest buildings. \"We don't even know if we beat her here or not. I'm thinking the best spot to ambush her would be in the hangar.\"</p><p>\"Yeah, me too.\" A screech of metal rolling on metal rends the air and we both strain to see the leading edge of the building. \"Shit. She's already here.\" </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Paul</p><p>\"Is that the door going up?\"</p><p>\"Yup,\" Drew says while hustling across the open space between our location and the cleared airstrip. Ignoring the stitch in my side, I hurry to keep up. \"I don't hear an engine yet,\" he says. \"She must be planning on pushing the plane into position on the runway to remain undetected as long as possible.\"</p><p>Adrenaline spikes through me as I sprint alongside Drew. What the hell are we doing? Shouldn't we be waiting for backup or something? I sure as hell don't know how to fight my way out of a paper bag.</p> <p>Strength courses through my frame, along with gut-wrenching fear. Despite never being in shape and never being good at sports, with each pounding step we took through the forest I felt more alive than ever in my life. We race around the corner just as the propellers come into view. Drew uses his momentum to slide under the body of the plane in a perfect imitation of a runner forced from third closing in on home plate, to come at the slight, black-clothed figure on the opposite side.</p><p>I stutter to a stop and look around for a weapon of some kind. Drew must have engaged her already because I can hear blows landing on flesh and the plane has stopped moving forward.</p><p>Gasoline and engine oil coat the cold air, leaving a faint metallic taste in the back of my throat. A few expelled breaths and curses reach me as I scramble for a weapon.</p><p>Come on. Come on. There's got to be something here near the doors I can use. There! I latch onto a crowbar and head around the tail to the far side of the plane. I rush in to join, barreling at the slight figure with the make-shift weapon raised.</p><p>Despite her blood loss and weakened state, she steps nimbly to the side and grabs my coat. My own momentum is used against me and I go sailing across the hangar. Pain spikes through my spine as I crash into some shelving and metal parts. I fall to the concrete, and large pieces of plane fall on me. Jesus, was that landing gear?</p> <p>The agony in my back crests; it threatens to overwhelm my mind and drive me to lose consciousness-and then winks out. My vision clouds and I reach out through my bond, hoping I can open the link back up that Rafe closed in the clearing.</p><p>I push hard, screaming with my mental energy for all I can, She's at the air strip!</p><p>Judging by the grunts and muffled sounds of more landed strikes, it appears Drew is holding steady, for now. The hangar springs back into clarity and I see my seethe-mate keeps the quiet woman occupied with a long rusted pole, brandishing it like a sword.</p><p>They dance back and forth; she's weaponless and weak, but still able to defend herself. She stumbles and Drew closes in. With just her bare fists and flying feet, she keeps the younger vampire at bay.</p><p>The crowbar is no longer in my possession, having clattered out of my grip when I was unceremoniously tossed by the ninja-vamp. Ninja-vamp? I shake my head while dragging my ass off the concrete. God, that sounds like a cheesy Saturday morning double feature. I grab a long screwdriver lying nearby on the floor. Maybe if he keeps her distracted, I can come at her from behind. Unwilling to examine the implausibility of me sneaking up successfully on a ninja, I step out from behind a dissected engine, determined to help.</p><p>Drew's repeated thrust and parry with the skilled fighter never wavers. His eyes focus on her black-clad limbs and no words break the concentration they have on one another. A wound in Emiko's side, whether old or new, I can't tell, leaves a trail of blood to trickle down and land on the floor.</p> <p>Their footing becomes slick in the patches of red and once or twice they both falter, but catch themselves before they go down. I ease out, stepping as silently as I can, and inch my way across the expanse of the hangar.</p><p>Please, don't look my way. Please, don't look my way, tumbles through my mind over and over again as I creep closer to the two. Not once does Drew glance in my direction to reveal my advancing position on Emiko's unprotected back.</p><p>Ten feet now separates me from them. Quiet as a mouse. No one can hear you. I slink up as close as I can, waiting for the perfect moment to strike. At one point, their positions change slightly and Emiko's back is no longer to me. Her head never moves, but stays fixed on Drew. I can't tell if she's seen me out of the corner of her eye or not.</p><p>Drew starts to tire as the ex-enforcer presses forward, driving him with pummeling hands and feet toward a dark corner of the hangar where the curved wall will hinder his movements.</p><p>Quiet. Each step like air. Can't see me.</p><p>Her slim back stills for a moment as she locks both hands onto the rusted pole, trying to wrest it from Drew's grasp. She pulls it free, overpowering him despite still recovering from the silver poison and being shot, executes one fluid motion, intending to turn the weapon on Drew. Now! I scream in my own mind. Thrusting with all my might, I aim at the edge of her left shoulder blade.</p><p>The long, flat-headed screwdriver pierces flesh and bone. It sinks in deep, the hilt halting its progress. The scent of fresh blood spills into the dimly lit air. The rogue crashes to her knees and I follow her down, keeping the thin piece of metal lodged in her heart.</p><p>\"Where the hell did you come from?\" Drew rasps while drawing the pole out of her hands. Using it like a bat, he sends it flying at her skull, bashing in the bone and splattering blood all over the two of us.</p> <p>Shaking like a leaf, I don't answer. I watch as Emiko lists to the side and falls on the concrete floor. Drew reaches behind his back and takes out a compact hunting knife. Tossing it at me, hilt first he says, \"Here, cut out her heart before she can heal.\"</p><p>I catch the knife and stare at it in horror. \"What?\" My gut roils and terror fills me. I just stabbed someone and now I'm expected to cut out their heart? \"You want me to do what?\"</p><p>\"I don't know how you did it, but it was an honorable kill. At the end, she had me and she knew it.\" At my panicked look he continues, \"Look, I know it's hard, but you've got to move fast or she'll be like the Terminator and come back to kill us both.\"</p><p>My limbs feel heavy, like I'm swimming through sludge. I pull the screwdriver out and push the damaged vampire onto her back. Her blood-covered eyes lock on me and I cringe.</p><p>\"Don't think about it, Paul. Just act. If it makes you feel any better, think of dressing a deer.\"</p><p>My stomach lurches and I fight to keep from spewing. Oh, God. Is this what I signed up for? Can I be ruthless and live like this? The image Vivian projected of Coraline holding Bunny's head aloft in the conference room snaps into my head. My wife's face frozen in terror while blood dripped from her severed neck.</p><p>What would I do to protect my family?</p><p>The answer is simple: I'd do anything.</p><p>As I bend to complete the task, Emiko reaches up to wrap a hand around my throat. Pressure tightens as I fumble with the knife. Sliding the well-honed blade through fabric, I slice deep into her flesh.</p><p>In a final push of will, determined to finish the job, I close my mind off from the screams pounding inside my skull. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Jonathan</p><p>Howls fill the night as I dodge bushes and trees. The smaller wolf dogs brush against my fur as we run through the darkness. Retching sounds reach our ears as the low group of airport buildings comes into view. We slow down, half of the pack breaking off to flank around the other side of the hangar.</p><p>Outside the entrance, we encounter Paul's hunched form kneeling over a pool of blood in the snow.</p><p>\"Oh God, Drew,\" he says between gulps of air. \"Something tasted bad in her blood.\"</p> <p>\"Sorry, I made you do it. Must have been the silver bullet.\" The vamp shrugs, a bulging sack dripping vampire blood held in one hand. \"Or some of the silver poison was still in her organs. I bet that shit takes a while to flush out completely.\"</p><p>\"That makes sense,\" Paul replies while wiping his mouth, he leans against the corrugated metal. \"I doubt we could have taken her in a fair fight.\"</p><p>\"Speaking of which-how in the hell did you sneak up on her?\"</p><p>I glance back at the dogs and dip my muzzle to convey my wishes to have them hang back. Sometimes I think they're smarter than people. I edge into the small circle of light from the safety lights and Paul jerks with a start. \"Christ, is that one of the werewolf hunters?\" he lurches to his feet, stumbles. \"Don't let them touch the body, they'll get sick, too.\"</p><p>\"No,\" Drew says while walking closer, examining me. \"I think it's Jon.\" I cough and drop my head down and up. A smile splits his face and he moves as if to pet me. A low growl issues from my throat and the vampire steps back, hands out in a placating gesture. \"Yeah,\" he laughs, \"I'm pretty sure that's him.\"</p> <p>Asa strolls out of the darkness, coming from deep within the hangar. \"We left the windmills together, but once his pack joined us I gave them some space.\"</p><p>Paul clutches his middle and turns to hurl once more. Once the spasm stops, he wipes a hand across his bloody mouth and glares at Asa. \"Dude, would it fucking kill you to knock or something? Scared the blood out of me, literally.\"</p><p>Asa pulls off his facemask and runs a hand over his shaven head. A smile splits his normal stern expression and he chuckles. \"Do you mean to tell me you tried to drink her silver tainted blood? You're lucky all you're doing is puking.\"</p><p>\"It's Drew's fault. He made me sound like the biggest pussy in the world if I didn't do it. 'Drink from her neck-be a true vampire.' Fucking prick.\"</p><p>Drew scrunches up his face. \"I'm not apologizing twice. It was a mistake. Get over it.\"</p><p>Asa looks over at the wreckage on the right side of the hanger. \"Damn, looks like I missed a good fight.\" He saunters over to the corpse and pats it down to find the camera. He lifts it up and angles it in the dim light to read the back. \"One time being up in the Arctic has its advantages.\"</p> <p>Drew steps closer to examine the camera. \"What do you mean?\"</p><p>\"This camera can upload direct to the net.\" He smiles. \"But not if there's no wi-fi signal.\" He ejects the memory card and destroys it on the spot, crushing it on the concrete beneath a boot heel. At Drew's raised eyebrow he says, \"Not worth taking a chance.\"</p><p>\"Weren't you curious to see the picture?\"</p><p>\"Why?\" Asa stares at the older vampire intently. \"So I could see Paul's head buried in the snow?\"</p><p>\"Nah, just saying.\"</p><p>Asa locks eyes with me and then looks back at Drew. \"You weren't thinking about keeping it were you?\"</p><p>It's apparent to me, by the expression on Drew's face, he didn't intend anything with his question, but he clearly understands where Asa is going with his assumptions. \"Do I look like I have a death wish?\"</p><p>Asa relaxes and the two start to push the plane back into the building. I head to the bathroom in the far corner, transform out of my wolf form, grab a set of clean, mechanics' overalls and slip them on. The physical intensity of the change keeps the worst of the cold away, but it won't last for long.</p> <p>I pad barefoot back to the garage opening to see the dogs standing at the ready, far away from Paul and his pool of regurgitated blood. Ten sets of eyes wait for my command. \"Home,\" I say, following it with a loud clap of my hands. The half-breeds race off, playful yips filling the air as they disappear. They'll make their way back to my cabin and their heated kennels in no time.</p><p>Drew's voice comes from behind me. \"Should we burn the heart here or burn it back at the inn?\" Paul begins to retch again at the mention, while I stifle a laugh and reach for a rolled up mound of dirty fabric on a shelf.</p><p>Asa shakes his head at Paul's poor luck and grabs one end of my bundle. \"There's a great spot near the pool wing. I used it for the others.\"</p><p>\"Yeah,\" I say while we spread out the old, oily tarp. \"The fire pit is nice. Too bad you undead bastards never get to use it in the summer.\" I roll the body up and a slight pain shoots through my healing side.</p><p>\"What do Vivian and Rafe do during that time of year?\" Drew asks.</p><p>\"The three of us, and maybe a few of the other employees, usually go to a tiny island they own off the southern tip of Argentina. It's winter down there then.\"</p><p>\"'Usually?' Not this year?\" Drew asks.</p><p>Pain and joy war for dominance in my middle, showing my conflictions over the new plan I discussed with Rafe earlier. \"Most years the resort closes, and the employees do what they want. Some leave and visit with their families... others enjoy hunting the big game that migrates north.\" Not willing to risk a tear internally, I motion to the vampire to pick up the body before I turn for the door. \"You grab her and I'll drive, okay?\" I call back over my shoulder, expecting the others to follow.</p><p>A shuffling and murmur of voices trail behind me. I smack the \"down\" button on the wall as I walk past. The metal door starts its slow descent as Asa hustles past me to dump the tarp in the back of a nearby four-door pickup.</p><p>I throw open the squealing door and climb behind the wheel. Paul looks a little shaky still and Drew and Asa stand outside the truck while he tries to pull himself together. They don't seem to know what to say to him. \"You bloodsuckers coming or you plan on sitting with you thumbs up your asses all damn day?\"</p><p>The three climb in, Paul still looking a little green. I start the engine and shut off the vents so we aren't blasted with frigid air. We drive away from the air strip in silence, the headlights illuminating our way over the rough, but plowed, narrow road.</p><p>Overall, the general good vibe of surviving the ninja permeates the atmosphere of the truck cab. Weakened though she may have been, we all walked away-what more could anyone ask?</p><p>\"You still didn't answer my question,\" Drew reminds me.</p><p>Excitement bubbles under my breastbone as a steel hand clamps around my heart. \"Rafe suggested I stay here this season and keep the inn open.\"</p><p>\"Open to whom?\" Asa asks. \"It's not like vampires will be coming up here when the sun shines 24/7.\"</p><p>\"No, but werewolves and other supernatural critters will.\"</p><p>Paul shoots forward and grabs my shoulder, \"Pull ov-\"</p><p>I slam on the breaks before he even finishes his sentence. He thumps into the back of the passenger side seat and shoots me a glare. Cracking open the door, the chef leans out and spews.</p><p>\"Push his ass out,\" I say.</p><p>Asa looks at me in the rearview mirror. \"Don't you think that's a little harsh?\"</p><p>\"You feel like cleaning poisoned vampire blood out of the floor mats and upholstery?\"</p><p>With one shove, Asa sends Paul flying to the snow-covered pavement below. \"Sorry, man.\" A yelp reaches us as he pulls the door shut.</p><p>\"Wait.\" Drew says as I start to pull away. \"He can ride in the bed of the truck.\" He powers down his window and calls back to the pissed-off vampire. \"Climb in the back, Paul.\"</p><p>\"Next to the body?\" he says while scrambling his way over the truck's side. \"You guys are gems. Let me tell you.\"</p><p>Drew closes his window to muffle the angry litany Paul shouts between retching.</p><p>I grin at some of the colorful insults he throws at his seethe-mates, \"Am I understanding things right-Paul dealt the killing blow?\"</p><p>Drew shakes his head. \"I'm still not sure how he did it. He bumbled his first attack and then I never saw him again. I honestly thought he'd fled.\"</p><p>From the backseat, Asa clears his throat. \"Could he have been there and you just didn't see him?\"</p><p>\"You mean like an illusion?\" I ask.</p><p>Silence fills the cab, none of us wanting to answer the obvious question. I continue back to the main building, each of us lost in our own thoughts. Rafe approached me about his summer idea while Dria tracked Emiko. In hindsight, she should have killed the woman in the woods, when she had the chance.</p><p>The elaborate setup fooled us all. They knew we'd check out the rogue independently the moment she arrived. They must have planted the evidence to lead us down a trap of our own making.</p><p>I shake my head while pulling into the wide circular drive. Every light is on in the inn and the twinkle of the twisted blown-glass chandelier can be seen through the transom above the door. People mill about in the oversized foyer. A few partiers can be seen hanging over the third floor railing, dressed in leather and showing a lot of flesh.</p><p>I turn off the engine and let out a sigh. \"Do any of us know what the story is regarding Coraline? Is she in there thinking Asa and Drew killed Emiko or what?\"</p><p>\"Vivian would have told us if she changed the plan, right?\" Concern colors Drew's tone.</p><p>\"Let me call them,\" Asa says, \"and report what's happened.\"</p><p>I snort and look at him in the mirror. \"Probably should have done that back at the air strip.\" I pull the release handle to open the pickup's door, and the screech sounds like a whisper compared to the blaring classic rock coming from the building. Asa stays in the cab while Drew and I lean together against the driver's side fender.</p><p>Paul falls over the edge of the truck bed. \"Whoo! I missed the party last time. Glad I'll get to be at this one.\"</p><p>I laugh. \"Dude, you're so fucked. You really think Vivian wants you puking on her wood floors and antique rugs?\" I shake my head at his bewildered expression.</p><p>Drew pushes off the side of the truck. \"I'll take him round the kitchen entrance to the basement.\"</p><p>\"Noooo....\" Paul yells while running hellbent into the dark, away from the pursuing Drew.</p><p>\"You really think you can outrun me, Paul?\" Drew calls, humor ringing out in his tone. \"Think this through, man.\" He leans down to scoop up some snow and sends it sailing after Paul's head. \"We can't go in looking like this-we're both covered in blood and you reek of vomit.\"</p><p>I shake my head and glance back toward the inn, catching sight of one of Romeo's werewolves, Spike, through the window. He's the one with the penchant for wearing black and staring at me. One slender hip leans on a windowsill as his heavy-lidded gaze watches me through the glass.</p><p>A slight shimmer encases him for a moment and an athletic looking woman in men's clothes with long, mahogany hair cascading past her shoulders winks at me. I straighten away from the door and wonder at what in the hell I'm seeing. In a flash, the form of the woman is gone and Spike smiles quick and winks before turning his back on me.</p><p>\"What the fuck was that?\"</p><p>Asa's door creaks open and he slides out. \"You talking to me?\"</p><p>Confusion, hope, and despair run amok through my mind. Did I imagine he was a woman because I'm drawn to him? Is something else going on?</p><p>\"Jon?\" Asa pushes my shoulder. \"You okay? You look like you just saw a ghost.\"</p><p>A nervous laugh escapes me. \"Nah. How crazy would that sound?\"</p><p>\"Come on, man. Let's get inside. I've had enough of the cold to last me for days.\"</p><p>Uncomfortable in party settings, and not ready to face Rafe and Dria's coziness or awkward attempts to pretend there's nothing wrong between us, I shake my head. \"You go ahead. Someone's got to take care of burning the heart.\" With that, I grab the soggy bag he tossed in the truck bed and head around the right side of the building, taking the long way to the fire pit in the stone garden.</p><p>I plan on getting rip-roaring drunk tonight and indulging in some self-pleasure. I've got to get this freaky shit out of my head. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Vivian</p><p>\"Bad Moon Rising\" pounds out of the sound system and a few of the werewolves gyrate on the parquet wood floor in wanton abandon. The party seems to encase all three levels of the vaulted foyer. Supernatural guests lean over the railings, whooping loudly and gesticulating wildly, while others, human included, try their best to slide down the dual curving banisters in a drunken race to the next landing.</p><p>Lori's arm rests in a sling but she still manages to entice Eric and Pat into a three-person hip grind amongst the other dancers. Romeo and Elsa dance together, oblivious of anyone else. Spike, whom I don't recall speaking to this whole trip, leans near the front door and sees me surveying the crowd. He raises his glass slightly and tilts his head in acknowledgement.</p><p>This party has a different feel to it than the one after Ivan was killed. That day, fear gripped us all and electricity was still down on some parts of the resort. The roaring bonfire on the front drive seemed surreal and the stench of burning flesh filled the lobby for days after.</p> <p>I'm glad nothing like that is happening tonight. The free drinks and music have loosened everyone up and I think even the most stalwart participants this week, like Stan, will go away happy they came and tried their skills against Emiko.</p><p>Across the lobby, near the fireplace, the remaining vampire hunters-Liam, Jet, Donald and Stan-crowd around Stephen, pumping him for information on his \"kill\". His face is alight with sharing every \"remembered\" detail.</p><p>Back by the windmills, I had no choice but to take control of Coraline's mind. The entire plan fell apart in a matter of seconds, requiring me to act quickly. It was a simple matter to replace her memories to make her think Stephen, and not Asa, carved out her heart. Erasing traces of the end, when the gunfire shattered my control, was an easy task. Rafe's idea of inserting the knowledge she lost her charmed broach at one of their refueling spots on the way up, will buy us some time when she gets back to Argentina, but not much.</p><p>I couldn't delve too deeply in her mind; it risked having her become consciously aware of my actions-like possibly leaving gaping holes in her memories or a sense that something was \"off\". I know there are other members involved in the witch-hunt against me, but I'm still not sure who.</p><p>We ran into Stephen, wandering near the bowling alley, half-frozen, and unsure of exactly when he last ventured to the main building to warm up. I slipped into his head and planted memories of a long, noble sword fight before Rafe threw blood on the vampire and roughed him up a bit. Mesmerized and still under my control, Cora stood to the side, unaware of the proceedings. By the time we got back to the hotel, she was clapping Stephen on the back and congratulating him on the kill.</p> <p>It actually turned out better we used one of the hunters instead of Asa. I'd seen in Cora's mind how that previous detail sent alarm bells off in her head.</p><p>Rafe comes in to sit with me at small table in the dining room. His smile is warm and affectionate, with the added bonus of some lingering lusty heat simmering in his eyes. It'll be nice to curl up in his arms when the Tribunal vampires leave and we can pretend, at least for a little while, there is no danger waiting for us.</p><p>The chef, Stephanie, is on duty and she bustles over to our table with a fresh carafe of Rafe's favorite coffee. \"More?\" she says to me, indicating my empty mug.</p><p>\"Yes, please.\" I raise my mug and our fingers touch as she steadies the ceramic while pouring. A flash of her tampering with Paul's spices fills my mind. She smiles at me before placing the carafe on the table, and then heads back to the kitchen.</p><p>\"Damn,\" I say when she's out of earshot.</p><p>\"What?\"</p> <p>\"Stephanie is the reason Paul's cooking has sucked since he turned.\"</p><p>\"Really?\"</p><p>\"Yeah, she's feeling a little guilty and I saw her actions in her surface thoughts when we touched. She was angling to take his job and figured if he couldn't taste the spices or food he was preparing he wouldn't know his personal collection was compromised.\"</p><p>\"Pink slip?\" Rafe asks, always ready to do the difficult jobs when required.</p><p>\"Nah. How about I talk with her,\" I say with a wiggle of my eyebrows, \"and we see how things go?\"</p><p>He nods, eyes trailing over the guests in the lobby.</p><p>Wrapping my hands around my warm mug, I take a small sip of black coffee. The familiar aroma relaxes me in the midst of the vibrant party energy.</p><p>Rafe sets his empty cup on the wood surface and pours more from the fresh pot. \"Asa stressed several times during our call that Drew claims he never saw Paul,\" he says, low voice not reaching far. \"Almost like he appeared out of nowhere.\"</p> <p>\"I heard him.\"</p><p>\"So are we going to talk about it?\"</p><p>A sigh escapes me as I place my coffee next to his. \"It's still too soon to tell. Paul could be like Antonio, able to wrap small glamours around himself.\"</p><p>\"Are you sure?\"</p><p>\"No,\" I say, while meeting his concerned, bright-blue gaze. \"He could be a 'child' of my bloodline.\"</p><p>\"What are the chances?\"</p><p>\"I've turned dozens over the centuries. He'd be my first true descendant.\"</p><p>Rafe stares past me, into the twinkling peacefulness of the quiet hot tub grotto beyond the window. \"How long until your true powers started to emerge?\"</p><p>\"A few years. But it took me two decades 'til I was strong enough to overcome the whole seethe.\"</p><p>Pain fills my husband's expression. \"I'm so sorry I wasn't there to help you when you needed it.\"</p><p>A smile softens my face. \"I'm not.\" At his look of confusion, I add, \"You'd be dead. They used everyone I loved to control me.\" My voice trails off to a whisper, \"Until I finally had to set us free.\" Rafe reaches across the table and grabs my hand, squeezing it hard.</p><p>He knows I was alone when I left the burning barn five centuries ago. He understands why I had to kill the man I loved, to free him from torture... and to release myself from the unending tyranny and abuse I endured under my master to keep my lover alive.</p><p>A vampiric presence enters the dining room and we both turn to see Asa exiting our suite through the steel door. \"How's Paul?\" I call out.</p><p>\"Better. The vomiting has stopped.\" He pulls out one of the chairs near us and sits. \"I think.\" He shakes his head while pouring a cup of coffee. \"Strange things happening today, huh?\"</p><p>I look at Rafe and grin. I'm guessing this is the young man's segue way into asking about what he witnessed in the clearing. \"Yup,\" I answer, enjoying his awkwardness.</p><p>Asa takes a gulp of brew and grimaces. \"Ugh, why bother to drink it if it's not mixed with blood? Shit's nasty.\" He wipes his mouth on a napkin. \"And to think I used to love the stuff.\"</p><p>Rafe leans on the back legs of his chair and grabs a carafe off the table behind him. \"Here, this one might be more to your liking.\"</p><p>The young vampire mixes some of the blood coffee into his mug and stares down at the table. \"Are we going to have a debriefing to discuss the... er... umm... new ending?\"</p><p>Laughter bubbles up and out, from both Rafe and me. \"What?\" I say. \"You have questions regarding my handling of the situation?\"</p><p>\"No! No. I meant... well... what really happened back there? How did you control Coraline like she was a human?\"</p><p>I smile and pat him on the forearm. \"Let's talk about it tomorrow, everyone at once. Okay?\"</p><p>Tension pours out of the young man and he visibly relaxes, \"Yeah, that sounds great.\" He clears his throat and rubs a hand over his stubble-covered head. \"Jon mentioned something about this summer. Maybe opening the resort up to Weres?\"</p><p>\"We've been talking about it,\" Rafe says.</p><p>\"I'd like to stay here during that time,\" Asa says. \"If I may.\"</p><p>I lean in and look him dead in the eye, \"You realize you can't go outdoors, and coming up on the main level of the inn could be dangerous, too, right?\"</p><p>\"Yeah, I know. Thought I could get from place to place via those escape tunnels you designed.\" At my not-so-happy look he hastily adds, \"Uh... if there was a need.\"</p><p>I look to Rafe, who nods. \"I think it's a distinct possibility.\" The young vamp breaks into a smile and looks across the lobby to where his brother and Pat dance with Lori. \"There'd be rules, of course.\" His head bobs up and down; eager to concur with anything I say to get what he wants.</p><p>\"You want to tell him the other good news, or should I?\" Rafe smiles now, happy to have something terrific to share after this exhausting week.</p><p>\"Go for it.\"</p><p>\"What?\" Asa asks. We're beaming, happy with the new development, and he starts to look annoyed. \"Don't leave me hanging here.\"</p><p>\"We had a talk with Romeo and Elsa while you guys were at the airport.\"</p><p>\"So?\"</p><p>\"They've agreed to leave Eric and Pat here in Jon's care, for them to become a part of his pack-if Jon agrees.\"</p><p>Asa's whoop of joy draws a few glances our way. He leaps from the chair and knocks mine back an inch or so in his haste to hug me. Muscular arms wrap around me and squeeze tight. \"Thank you, Vivian! You have no idea what this means to me.\" My arms are pinned to my side so I halfheartedly pat his side in response.</p><p>Once the young vampire catches himself in his uncharacteristic show of affection, he releases me and the moment is over as quickly as it occurred. \"Why don't you go share the news with Eric and Pat?\" I offer. He moves around the table, without a backward glance, purpose in his step and excitement radiating off him. As he heads into the lobby, I lift a thought from his mind. I call behind him, \"Just be sure to mix the Jager with some blood or you'll feel like crap tomorrow!\"</p><p>\"That's a good thing you did, babe,\" Rafe whispers, leaning over the table to kiss me. I shrug, uncomfortable accepting the kudos for what is ultimately a sound decision toward Jon's happiness with having a pack of his own.</p><p>Raucous shouting from the young men and intense shoving proceeds. The three run up the two winding flights to the bar in a mad dash, chanting \"Jager\" every few steps. Soon the whole lobby clears out, following the exuberant trio.</p><p>In a moment, it's almost peaceful in here, that is, if you don't mind the blaring music.</p><p>Rafe takes my hand in his and plants a soft kiss on my fingertips. \"Now what do you want to do about Cora and her cronies?\"</p><p>God, you would have to mention her and kill my buzz of happiness. Last I heard, she was upstairs in the Roman bath with one of her hooded guards. I slip a foot out of one backless shoe and run my toes up the side of my husband's leg.</p><p>\"That's not what I meant and you know it.\" He drops a hand under the table to cup my foot, drawing it closer to his crotch. \"When do we leave?\"</p><p>I'm not surprised Rafe would assume the next logical step. I smile, thankful I have my very own Wolf Killer by my side no matter what the future holds. \"We beard the lion in his den before he has a chance to come after us.\" I rise, pulling my foot from his grasp, and stretch, pressing my breasts against my shirt and drawing my husband's hungry eye. \"This time, we'll be the ones hunting big game.\" </p> </body></html>"]
