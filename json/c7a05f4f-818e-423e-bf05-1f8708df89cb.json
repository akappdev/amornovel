She loved Christmas\u2014always had and always would, regardless of her circumstances. It was a bit early yet, a few days before Thanksgiving, but some Christmas cheer was exactly what she needed to get her mind off her problems. The grief that had been hounding her since the divorce five years ago...The financial uncertainty she now faced...The betrayal she still felt...</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said aloud, refusing to allow herself to step closer to that swamp of regrets. It often happened like this. She\u2019d start thinking about everything she\u2019d lost, and before she knew it, she\u2019d collapse emotionally, drowning in pain.</p><p>Carrying the plastic container down the hallway, she glanced inside her art room and let her gaze drift over to her easel and her latest project. The bold colors of the setting sun against the backdrop of the Pacific Ocean pleased her. Yes, she was divorced, but there\u2019d been compensations, too. Her art had fulfilled her in ways she hadn\u2019t even realized were possible.</p> <p>How different her life was at fifty-nine than she would\u2019ve imagined even five years ago\u2014before the divorce. What Burton had done was unforgivable. He\u2019d hurt her, and he\u2019d cheated her out of funds that were rightfully hers.</p><p>Once again she stopped herself, not wanting to indulge those bitter memories and regrets. She\u2019d done plenty of that in the beginning, when she\u2019d first learned he\u2019d found someone else and wanted out of their thirty-year marriage. It was a fling, or so she\u2019d managed to convince herself. A midlife crisis. Lots of men had them. Any day Burton would come to his senses and see what he was doing to her and to Roy, their son.</p><p>Only he hadn\u2019t, and Anne walked out of divorce court numb with shock and disbelief. Not until the judge\u2019s gavel echoed through the room had she fully believed her husband was capable of such treachery. She should\u2019ve known, should\u2019ve been prepared. Burton was a top-notch divorce attorney, a persuasive man who knew all the ploys. But despite everything, she\u2019d trusted him....</p><p>Her friends had been stunned, too\u2014less by Burton\u2019s deception than by Anne\u2019s apparent acceptance of what he\u2019d done to her. It wasn\u2019t in her to fight, to drag her marriage and her life through the courts. Burton had recommended an attorney, whom she\u2019d obediently retained, never suspecting that the man who\u2019d represented her in court would apply to Burton\u2019s law firm as soon as the divorce was final. Of course, he\u2019d been hired....</p><p>Burton had promised to treat her fairly. Because she was convinced that he\u2019d soon recognize what a terrible mistake he was making, she\u2019d blindly followed his lead. Without a quibble and on her attorney\u2019s advice, she\u2019d accepted the settlement offer\u2014one that had turned out to be grossly unfair. Although she hadn\u2019t been aware of it at the time, Anne was cheated out of at least two hundred and fifty thousand dollars\u2019 worth of assets.</p> <p>Burton\u2019s ploy in this particular case had been simple: he\u2019d strung her along. Twice he\u2019d come to her in tears, begging her forgiveness, talking about reconciliation, and all the while he\u2019d been shifting their assets to offshore accounts. All the while, he\u2019d been lying, stealing and cheating. She\u2019d loved him and she\u2019d believed him, and so had taken her husband at his word. Never had she dreamed he could betray her like this. After thirty years, she\u2019d walked away with only a pittance. And, needless to say, no alimony.</p><p>Yes, Anne could fight him, could take him back to court and expose him for the thief he was, but to what end? It was best, she\u2019d decided long ago, to preserve her dignity. She\u2019d always felt that life had a symmetry to it, a way of righting wrongs, and that somehow, eventually, God would restore to her the things she\u2019d lost. It was this belief that had gotten her past the bitterness and indignation.</p><p>Admittedly she couldn\u2019t help lapsing sometimes, but Anne tried not to feel bitter. At this point, she couldn\u2019t see how anger, even righteous anger, could possibly benefit her. She\u2019d adjusted. Taking the little she\u2019d managed to salvage from her marriage, she\u2019d purchased a small cottage on St. Gabriel, a tiny San Juan island in Puget Sound. In college all those years ago, when she\u2019d met Burton, she\u2019d been an art student. She had a flair for art and enjoyed it. Given the demands of being married to a prominent divorce lawyer, she\u2019d put aside her own pursuits to assist Burton. Her husband\u2019s ambitions had become her own, and Anne was the perfect wife and hostess.</p><p>It\u2019d been a disappointment to her to have only one child, a son they\u2019d named after Anne\u2019s father. Young Roy was the light of her life, her ray of sunshine through the years. When she wasn\u2019t hostessing social events on her husband\u2019s behalf, Anne spent her time with Roy, raising him with limitless love and motherly devotion.</p><p>If she felt any bitterness about the way Burton had treated her, it was because of what he\u2019d done to Roy. Unfortunately, Roy was the one who\u2019d introduced Burton to Aimee. He\u2019d never forgiven himself for that, despite Anne\u2019s reassurances. Still, Roy assumed responsibility for what had happened. He couldn\u2019t seem to forgive himself for his role in the divorce, no matter how innocent that role had been.</p><p>To complicate the situation even more, he refused to forgive his father, not only for betraying Anne but for stealing Aimee, the woman he himself had loved and planned to marry. Roy\u2019s anger was constantly with him. The anger had become part of him, tainting his life, as though he wore smudged, dark glasses that revealed a bleak, drab world. All Roy cared about now was his business, his drive for more and more, and while he\u2019d achieved greater success than most men twice his age, Roy wasn\u2019t happy.</p> <p>Her son\u2019s cynicism troubled Anne deeply\u2014even more than the divorce itself. She\u2019d put that behind her, as much as she was able, and built a comfortable life for herself, doing what she loved best\u2014painting. Mainly through word of mouth, her work had begun to sell at the local farmers\u2019 market and then at a couple of galleries in the area; it now provided her with a small income.</p><p>Anne would\u2019ve given anything to help her son. Regardless of how much money he made or how many accolades he received, he remained lonely and embittered. She desperately wanted him to find happiness.</p><p>In the five years since the divorce, Roy had not spoken to his father once, despite Burton\u2019s repeated efforts. Yet Roy was so like Burton. He shared his father\u2019s talents, his ambition. They shared another trait, too, the one that concerned Anne the most. He possessed his father\u2019s ability to be ruthless about marriage and relationships. He was thirty-three, and in Anne\u2019s view, he should get married. However, her son resolutely refused to discuss it. His attitude toward love and commitment had been completely warped. He no longer dated, no longer sought out relationships.</p><p>The only thing that mattered to Roy was the bottom line. He\u2019d grown cold and uncaring; little outside of Fletcher Industries seemed to affect him. Anne realized her son was in trouble. He was hurting badly, although he seemed incapable of recognizing his own pain. Roy needed someone to teach him the power of forgiveness and love. She\u2019d wanted to be that person, to show him that forgiveness was possible, but in his zeal to succeed, Roy had started to block her out of his life. It was unintentional, she knew, but nonetheless, it hurt.</p><p>Roy had established Fletcher Industries, his own computer security company, in Seattle, shortly after he graduated from college. His innovative, cutting-edge software led the competition in the field. Recent contracts with the government and several banks had given Fletcher Industries a solid position as one of the top companies of its type.</p><p>Those first years after he\u2019d formed his business, Roy spent far too many hours at work. It wasn\u2019t uncommon for him to stay in the office for two or three days at a time, living on fast food and catnaps. That all changed after he met Aimee. Her son had fallen in love and he\u2019d fallen hard. Anne had been thrilled and Burton was, too. Then Roy had brought Aimee to his parents\u2019 home in Southern California to introduce her...and all their lives had exploded.</p><p>Following his parents\u2019 divorce, Roy had quickly reverted to his old habit of working long hours. Only now a callousness had entered into his business dealings. Anne was aware of this, but she was helpless to change her son, and her heart ached with her inability to reach him. Time and again, she\u2019d tried to tell him what he was doing to himself\u2014that he was damaging his life and his future\u2014but he couldn\u2019t or wouldn\u2019t hear.</p><p>The kettle whistled, and leaving the Christmas box in the hall, Anne moved into the kitchen. She took the blue ceramic teapot from the cupboard and filled it with boiling water, then added a tea bag\u2014Earl Grey, her favorite\u2014and left it to steep. After a moment, she poured herself a cup and took a first sip of the aromatic tea. She frowned, berating herself for allowing her thoughts to follow the path they\u2019d taken. Just when she assumed she was free of Burton, she\u2019d wallow in the pain all over again and realize how far she had yet to go. There was only one cure for this bout of self-pity and for the worry that consumed her. Setting down the china cup, Anne bowed her head and prayed. Sometimes it was difficult to find the words to express what was in her heart, but not today. The prayer flew from her lips.</p> <p>\u201cDear Lord, send my son a woman to love. One who\u2019ll help him heal, who\u2019ll teach him about forgiveness. A woman who\u2019ll open his heart and wake him up to the kind of man he\u2019s becoming.\u201d</p><p>Slowly, as if weighed down by her doubts, Anne\u2019s prayer circled the room. Gradually it ascended, rising with the steam from the teapot, spiraling upward out of the simple cottage and toward the leaden sky. It rose higher and higher until it reached the clouds and then sped toward the heavens. There, it landed on the desk of the Archangel Gabriel, the same Archangel who\u2019d delivered the good news of God\u2019s love to a humble Jewish maiden more than two thousand years ago.</p><p>Gabriel, however, was away from his desk.</p><p>Shirley, Goodness and Mercy, three Prayer Ambassadors who had a reputation for employing unorthodox means to achieve their ends, stood just inside the Archangel\u2019s quarters. Together the three of them watched as the prayer made its way onto his desk. Only the most difficult prayer requests went to the mighty Gabriel\u2014the prayers that came from those who were most in need, from the desperate and discouraged.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t read it,\u201d Shirley cried when Goodness, unable to resist, bent to pick up the wispy sheet.</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d Goodness had always had more curiosity than was good for her. She knew that peeking at a prayer request before Gabriel had a chance to view it was asking for trouble, but that didn\u2019t stop her. Mercy was the one most easily swayed by things on Earth, and Shirley, well, Shirley was nearly perfect. At one time she\u2019d been a Guardian Angel but had transferred to the ranks of the Prayer Ambassadors. That had happened under suspicious circumstances, so Shirley\u2019s perfection was a little compromised. Shirley never mentioned the incident, though, and Goodness dared not inquire. She knew that some things were better left unknown\u2014despite her desire to hear all the sordid details. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cGoodness,\u201d Shirley warned again.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just going to glance at the name,\u201d Goodness muttered, carefully lifting the edge of the folded sheet.</p><p>\u201cIs it anyone we know?\u201d Mercy demanded, drawing closer.</p><p>Goodness eyed Shirley, who was trying not to reveal her own interest. \u201cWell, is it?\u201d Shirley finally asked.</p> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d Goodness said. \u201cI\u2019ve never heard of Anne Fletcher, have you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnne Fletcher?\u201d Shirley echoed, and then as if her knees had gone out from under her, she sank into the chair reserved for Gabriel. \u201cAnne Fletcher from California,\u201d the former Guardian Angel repeated slowly.</p><p>Goodness looked again, lifting the edge of the sheet just a bit higher this time. \u201cFormerly of California,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cOh, no!\u201d Shirley cried. \u201cShe moved. I wonder why. Tell me where she\u2019s gone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe San Juan Islands,\u201d Mercy said, leaning over Goodness to take a look for herself.</p> <p>\u201cShe\u2019s in the Caribbean?\u201d Shirley said, sounding distraught.</p><p>\u201cNo, in Puget Sound\u2014Washington State,\u201d Goodness told her.</p><p>\u201cI remember it well,\u201d Mercy said with a dreamy smile. \u201cDon\u2019t you remember the Bremerton Shipyard? We had so much fun there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat I remember,\u201d Goodness informed her fellow angel, \u201cwas all the trouble we got in when you started shifting aircraft carriers and destroyers around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know how many times you want me to apologize for that,\u201d Mercy muttered, crossing her arms defiantly. \u201cIt was a fluke. Nothing like that\u2019s happened since, and frankly I think you\u2019re...\u201d</p><p>Her words faded as she saw Goodness studying Shirley. \u201cHow do you know Anne Fletcher?\u201d Goodness asked softly.</p> <p>\u201cPoor, poor Anne,\u201d Shirley murmured, seemingly lost in thought. \u201cI knew her mother\u2014I was her Guardian Angel. I was with her mother, Beth, when she gave birth to Anne.\u201d</p><p>So Shirley had a connection to Anne Fletcher. \u201cI didn\u2019t read the request,\u201d Goodness said, more eager than ever to throw caution to the winds and take a second, longer look.</p><p>\u201cMaybe there\u2019s something we can do,\u201d Mercy said. It sounded as if she was encouraging Goodness to flout protocol, and Goodness was happy to go along with the implied suggestion. She quickly scooped up the prayer request, then almost dropped it when a voice boomed behind them.</p><p>\u201cDo for whom?\u201d it asked.</p><p>Gabriel. The Archangel Gabriel.</p><p>Goodness spun around and backed against the side of the huge desk, crushing her wings in her attempt to hide. Oh, this wasn\u2019t good. Gabriel was their friend, but he wouldn\u2019t tolerate their snooping around his desk.</p><p>\u201cNothing.\u201d Mercy moved closer to Goodness until they stood shoulder to shoulder, wing to wing.</p><p>Shirley was lost in her own thoughts, sitting in Gabriel\u2019s chair, apparently oblivious to their dire circumstances.</p> <p>\u201cDo?\u201d Goodness choked out. \u201cAre we supposed to be doing something for someone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Anne Fletcher,\u201d Shirley whispered, peering up at Gabriel, apparently still in a stupor. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to help her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnne Fletcher?\u201d Gabriel\u2019s brow furrowed with concern.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s said a prayer for Roy,\u201d Goodness explained, and boldly handed Gabriel the request, as much as admitting it had been read. \u201cShe wants to believe. But she\u2019s worried about her son and has given up hope that anyone can reach him. We can\u2019t let her lose faith\u2014we just can\u2019t!\u201d She gazed up at Gabriel with large, pleading eyes. Her wings were folded back and she hung her head as though she felt the same sense of despair Anne Fletcher did.</p><p>Goodness had never seen Shirley so upset. Clearly this Anne person was someone she cared about.</p><p>Gabriel made a grumbling sound. Shirley glanced up and with a look of panic realized she was sitting in his chair. She bolted upright, then leaped to one side.</p><p>It was such a rare sight to see Shirley ruffled that, had she not felt so worried about her friend, Goodness would\u2019ve been amused.</p><p>Once his chair was vacant, Gabriel sat down, ignoring the prayer request. Instead, he removed the massive book from the shelf behind him. With a soft grunt, he set it on his desk. He opened it to the section marked F, and ran his finger down a long list of names inscribed there.</p><p>Goodness wasn\u2019t going to risk standing on tiptoe and taking a look. Even she understood when it was best to restrain her curiosity.</p><p>\u201cAnne Fletcher,\u201d Gabriel said thoughtfully. \u201cIt\u2019s been five years since the divorce.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnne\u2019s divorced?\u201d Shirley whispered. \u201cOh, my, I didn\u2019t know. How\u2019s she doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, quite well,\u201d Gabriel told her. \u201cShe\u2019s adjusted far better than we\u2019d expected.\u201d He nodded, smiling gently. \u201cShe\u2019s gone back to her art and that\u2019s helped her. It says here that she\u2019s living in Washington State, on a small island in Puget Sound.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBurton always discounted her talent,\u201d Shirley said, and leaned on her palms against the desk, daring to read the huge volume that documented human lives. \u201cShe could\u2019ve been a successful artist had she continued her studies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStill might,\u201d Goodness threw in, implying that she was in the know. She hated being left in the dark when it came to earthly matters. Humans intrigued her. They were the very pinnacle of God\u2019s creation, fearfully and wonderfully made, yet so obtuse. It was hard to believe free will could cause such problems.</p><p>\u201cAnne Fletcher is indeed talented,\u201d Gabriel said, \u201cbut fame and fortune were never important to her. She\u2019s had to deal with various losses, but as you already know, for every loss there is an equal or greater gain. Often humans have to search for it, though.\u201d</p><p>Goodness nodded in full agreement, although she couldn\u2019t begin to guess what God had in store for the fifty-nine-year-old divorced woman. \u201cGod has another man for her, doesn\u2019t He?\u201d she ventured.</p><p>Gabriel frowned as if Goodness\u2019s comments were starting to irritate him. \u201cNo, Goodness, not another man. Frankly, Anne isn\u2019t interested.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t blame her for that,\u201d Mercy added. \u201cAfter what Burton did to her, she\u2019d find it very difficult to trust again, and who could blame her?\u201d She seemed to think that was all anyone needed to say on that subject.</p><p>\u201cThe prayer is for her son,\u201d Gabriel pointed out as he read the request.</p><p>\u201cRoy,\u201d Shirley said. \u201cYou remember Roy, don\u2019t you?\u201d she asked mournfully. \u201cHe was such a sweet child, so willing to please, so anxious to follow in his father\u2019s footsteps.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBurton never forgave him for not pursuing a law degree,\u201d Gabriel commented absently. \u201cRoy is gifted, but he works too hard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure Anne would like grandchildren,\u201d Shirley said, studying the prayer request.</p><p>\u201cOf course she would,\u201d Mercy agreed.</p><p>For the first time since they\u2019d entered the room, Shirley smiled. \u201cGod provides,\u201d she whispered, and then said in a louder voice, \u201cIsn\u2019t that what you were just saying?\u201d</p><p>Gabriel glanced up. \u201cRoy isn\u2019t interested in marriage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot now he isn\u2019t,\u201d Goodness chimed in. The possibility of romance rose before her\u2014it was such fun to steer humans toward one another! Creating romance was by far her favorite duty on Earth. \u201cWe want in on this,\u201d she announced.</p><p>Gabriel leveled a fierce gaze on her, and she swallowed hard and took a step back.</p><p>\u201cBut only if you feel it\u2019s for the best,\u201d she mumbled.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s for Anne,\u201d Shirley pleaded. \u201cBeth\u2019s little Annie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you saying the three of you want to return to Earth?\u201d</p><p>Shirley, Goodness and Mercy all nodded simultaneously.</p><p>\u201cI was afraid of that.\u201d Gabriel stroked his chin. \u201cI\u2019m not sure Earth has recovered from your last visit yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll be exceptionally good this time,\u201d Mercy promised, folding her hands prayerfully. \u201cI swear I won\u2019t even think about going near an escalator.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t moving staircases that worry me,\u201d Gabriel said. \u201cIt\u2019s everything else.\u201d</p><p>Goodness stepped forward again. She could tell by the look in his eyes that Gabriel was weakening. \u201cWe can help her, Gabe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGabe?\u201d he bellowed.</p><p>\u201cGabriel,\u201d she corrected swiftly. \u201cI know we can. Besides, I have this romance thing down pat. Humans are eager to fall in love. All we have to do is lead them in the right dir\u2014\u201d She stopped when she saw Gabriel\u2019s expression.</p><p>For a moment, no one spoke and then in a low whisper, Shirley said, \u201cPlease?\u201d</p><p>Gabriel took his time answering while Goodness waited, holding her breath in anticipation. She wanted to visit Earth again. They\u2019d been away far too long\u2014several Earth years at least.</p><p>Oh, Gabriel, make up your mind, she muttered to herself. Say yes!</p><p>Two</p><p>Roy Fletcher hated doing job interviews. He warily regarded the older man sitting on the other side of his desk. Dean Wilcoff had to be close to sixty and retirement. His thinning gray hair was brushed away from his face and his dark eyes met Roy\u2019s squarely. He was big, an inch or two over six feet, broad-shouldered and muscular. He\u2019d obviously maintained himself physically, which was good. As head of building security, it was unlikely he\u2019d be chasing intruders, but he should at least be capable of it if the need arose. Roy glanced over Wilcoff\u2019s r\u00e9sum\u00e9 a second time. The man had an impressive work history.</p><p>\u201cYou were with Boeing\u2019s security force for twenty-six years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was,\u201d Dean answered without elaborating. There\u2019d been some downsizing at the airplane manufacturer, but Roy guessed that Dean Wilcoff had left or been let go for another reason. Still, his Human Resources department had selected this candidate for him to interview.</p><p>The dates on Wilcoff\u2019s r\u00e9sum\u00e9 showed that he\u2019d last worked nine months ago, yet Roy didn\u2019t sense any desperation in the man. Wilcoff should be worried. By now, his unemployment benefits would\u2019ve expired and at his age, obtaining another job wouldn\u2019t be easy.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you know about computers?\u201d</p><p>For the first time Roy noticed hesitation in the other man. \u201cOnly enough to get around on the Internet. My daughter\u2019s been after me to take one of those courses, but frankly I don\u2019t see the need. I work security. It\u2019s what I know and what I do best. If you hire me, Mr. Fletcher, you can rest assured that no one\u2019s going to break into your offices, day or night.\u201d</p><p>Roy raised a skeptical eyebrow. Life didn\u2019t come with guarantees. Everything was suspect. Everything and everyone. This was a lesson he\u2019d learned the hard way, but learn it he had.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get back to you,\u201d he said, dismissing the man. He\u2019d finished the round of interviews and although all the candidates were qualified, there hadn\u2019t been a single one he especially liked. The day before, he\u2019d talked to three applicants, and three more today. No one had really impressed him. Unfortunately he needed to make his decision soon if he didn\u2019t want hourly phone calls from his HR director. Well, fine. He\u2019d put the names in a hat and simply draw one. At this point, that was as logical as anything else. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHow\u2019d it go?\u201d Julie Wilcoff asked her father as she set the salad on the dinner table. She hated to ask, but he hadn\u2019t exactly been free with details since his return from the long-awaited interview. Julie was afraid that meant bad news, and he\u2019d already had enough disappointments. After nine months without a job, her father had grown restless and discouraged. She knew he was worried, especially with the holidays so close. He\u2019d wanted to have a new job lined up by New Year\u2019s, and he\u2019d had such hope for this one, which seemed perfect for him. Yet he\u2019d barely said a word since he\u2019d come home from the interview.</p><p>\u201cWhy hire an old man like me?\u201d he muttered as he walked to the table.</p><p>\u201cBecause you\u2019re highly qualified, dependable and intelligent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not even sure I want to work for Roy Fletcher,\u201d her father complained. He pulled out his chair and sat down.</p> <p>Julie frowned. After weeks of searching, of making dozens of unsuccessful applications, after talking about this interview for days on end, his attitude came as a shock. But if her father, a man who never exaggerated or jumped to conclusions, made such a statement, there was a reason.</p><p>Roy Fletcher\u2019s name had appeared in the media for years. He was one of the geniuses in the security software business, the man entrusted by the government to keep out hackers. Fletcher Industries had prospered as doing business online had become increasingly prone to theft\u2014of credit-card numbers, private information, financial records and more. Her father was in security, too, only a different kind. While Roy Fletcher made sure no one could break into computer files, her father prevented intruders from breaking into the doors and windows of buildings.</p><p>Julie sat down at the table and handed her father the meat loaf. It\u2019d been her mother\u2019s recipe and was one of his favorite meals. Julie had hoped this would be a celebration dinner, but apparently not. Still, she wondered what had prompted her father\u2019s comment. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with Mr. Fletcher?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t much care for him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMr. Fletcher interviewed you himself?\u201d Dad hadn\u2019t mentioned that earlier.</p> <p>Her father nodded. \u201cAfter I talked to a nice gal in what they call Human Resources.\u201d He paused a moment. \u201cShe sent me to see him.\u201d Another pause. \u201cHe isn\u2019t a pleasant man.\u201d</p><p>Julie scooped up a serving of scalloped potatoes and put them on her plate. Toward the end of her mother\u2019s final bout with cancer, Julie had moved out of her apartment and back in with her parents. Her father had quit his job and stayed home to nurse her mother. His company benefits had paid most of the medical bills; Julie\u2019s salary as a junior-high physical-education teacher covered the rest. It had been a time of sacrifice for them all. Emily, Julie\u2019s fraternal twin, had helped, financially and emotionally, as much as possible, although she no longer lived in Seattle.</p><p>After six months of this arrangement, Julie\u2019s beautiful, petite mother had died. That was four months ago. From the beginning, the doctors had given them little hope. Julie, Emily and their father knew and were prepared for the eventuality of Darlene Wilcoff\u2019s death. Or so they\u2019d assumed. What Julie had learned, and her sister, too, was that it didn\u2019t matter how ready you thought you were to face the death of a loved one; even when death is expected, it hits hard. Julie, her sister and their father had been left reeling. Julie felt her life would never be the same\u2014and it wouldn\u2019t. The world had lost a graceful, charming soul; she and Emily had lost a loving mother; Dean had been deprived of the woman he adored.</p><p>Julie waited until their plates were filled before she questioned him again. \u201cWhat didn\u2019t you like about Roy Fletcher?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s cold.\u201d Dean hesitated and his brows drew together. \u201cIt\u2019s as if nothing touches him, nothing affects him. From what I\u2019ve heard, people don\u2019t mean much to Fletcher. In fact, the whole time I was with him, I had the feeling there wasn\u2019t a single person in this world who meant a damn thing to him. I doubt he\u2019s an easy man to know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeople usually have a reason for acting the way they do,\u201d Julie said, hoping that would encourage her father to continue the conversation. She couldn\u2019t help being curious. The job offered an employment package that was far above anything he would have received with another employer.</p> <p>\u201cWell, whatever the reason, I got the impression that Fletcher thinks everything comes down to money, but there are some things that can\u2019t be bought.\u201d</p><p>Julie nodded.</p><p>Her father sampled the meat loaf, then set down his fork. \u201cIt\u2019s time, you know.\u201d</p><p>Julie pretended she didn\u2019t understand, but this was a discussion they\u2019d had more than once. Her father seemed to believe Julie should move back into an apartment of her own, now that her mother was gone. She disagreed. First, her father needed her. Oh, he\u2019d muddle through with meals and housework; Julie wasn\u2019t concerned about that. But she knew he was lonely and struggling with an all-consuming grief. As well, finances were tight since he was on a significantly reduced pension, and it went against his pride to let someone, even his daughter, pay the bills.</p><p>What he didn\u2019t grasp\u2014and she could find no way to explain\u2014was how badly she needed to be with him. They\u2019d suffered the biggest loss of their lives, and being together seemed to help. She wasn\u2019t ready to move out. Eventually she would, but not yet. For her, it was too soon.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve already been through this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd your point is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow, Dad, Emily and I think\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou should have your own life, instead of taking care of your old man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do have my own life,\u201d she insisted. \u201cI\u2019ll stay here until we\u2019re both back on our feet. Then you can kick me out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe thing is, I might never get back on my feet, especially financially,\u201d he said, his gaze dark and brooding. \u201cIt\u2019s time we faced facts here. I should sell the house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Julie cried, the thought unbearable. Losing the family home so soon after her mother\u2019s death was more than she could cope with emotionally. Not if there was any way to stop it. \u201cEmily and I refuse to let that happen.\u201d</p><p>Emily wanted to help more, but she was a young navy wife, living in Florida with two small children. Her husband was periodically at sea, sometimes for months at a time. Although twins, Julie and Emily were about as different as two sisters could be. Emily was like their mother, small and delicate, with blue eyes and wavy blond hair. A classic beauty. Julie took after her father\u2019s side of the family. Her hair and eyes were a deep shade of brown. Tall, strong and solidly built, she was a natural athlete. She\u2019d played center in basketball, pitcher in softball and was a track star all through high school and college.</p><p>While boys had flocked around Emily, they\u2019d mostly ignored her sister. Emily had brains, as well as looks, and although Julie had brains, too, she wasn\u2019t pretty the way her sister was. It had never bothered her until recently, when she\u2019d turned thirty. Her sister was married, and so were most of her friends. Sure, she dated, but the number of eligible men had dwindled as the years went on. With her mother growing increasingly ill, Julie hadn\u2019t worried about it much. But now...She sighed. Like her father in his job search, Julie had given up hope of meeting the right man. For a woman over thirty, the pickings were slim.</p><p>The phone rang, and Julie and her father both turned to stare at it.</p><p>\u201cLet the machine pick it up,\u201d he said. That had been a hard and fast rule during her teenage years\u2014no telephone call was worth disrupting family time at the dinner table.</p><p>\u201cYou sure?\u201d Julie asked.</p><p>Her father nodded and continued eating. \u201cYou did a good job on the meat loaf.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Mom\u2019s recipe, remember?\u201d</p><p>Her father grinned. \u201cIt might surprise you to learn she got it from a \u2018Dear Abby\u2019 column.\u201d</p><p>The phone rang again. \u201cNo way!\u201d This was news to Julie.</p><p>Her father chuckled. \u201cThat broccoli salad I like came out of the paper, too.\u201d</p><p>Her mother had never told her this, but then it was Emily who usually hung around the kitchen. Julie was always at basketball practice or some sporting event. There\u2019d been so many things her mother had never had the opportunity to tell her. Unimportant things, like this, and other things\u2014revelations, advice\u2014that really mattered. How Julie wished she could go back and recapture all those precious hours with her mother. If only she\u2019d known...</p><p>The answering machine clicked on and they heard a disgruntled male voice. \u201cThis is Roy Fletcher.\u201d</p><p>Without thinking, Julie launched herself toward the phone, whipping the receiver off the cradle before Fletcher could end the call. \u201cHello,\u201d she gasped. \u201cI assume you want to speak to my father?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, if your father is Dean Wilcoff.\u201d</p><p>Her dad was right; the man\u2019s voice was devoid of the slightest warmth.</p><p>\u201cJust a moment,\u201d she said, handing him the receiver.</p><p>\u201cDean Wilcoff,\u201d he said gruffly, frowning at Julie. His look said that if it\u2019d been up to him, he would\u2019ve left Roy Fletcher cooling his heels. Fortunately Julie had been closest to the phone.</p><p>She bit her lower lip as she studied her father. This had to be good news. Roy Fletcher wouldn\u2019t phone to tell a man he\u2019d chosen another candidate for the job.</p><p>Her father\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cBefore I accept the position, I have a few questions.\u201d</p><p>Julie wanted to wave her arms over her head and scream. Her father needed this job and not only for financial reasons. Oh, Dad, don\u2019t blow this now. It was too important.</p><p>After what seemed like an hour but was probably five minutes, her father replaced the receiver.</p><p>Julie could barely contain her anxiety. \u201cWell?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m seeing Mr. Fletcher in the morning to discuss my questions.\u201d The smallest hint of a smile touched his mouth. \u201cFor better or worse, it looks like I\u2019ve got the job if I want it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Dad! That\u2019s terrific news.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat, my dear Julie, remains to be seen.\u201d</p><p>Three</p><p>\u201cWould you care to meet Anne Fletcher for yourselves?\u201d Gabriel asked, eyeing the trio.</p><p>Goodness couldn\u2019t believe their good fortune. She nodded and smiled as Mercy eagerly agreed. It\u2019d been so long since they\u2019d visited Earth with its manifold delights. The place was definitely interesting\u2014and appealing\u2014but completely unlike Heaven. Earth was also dangerous, full of exotic allures and various temptations. Heaven, on the other hand...well, eyes hadn\u2019t seen or ears heard all that awaited those in glory.</p><p>Shirley\u2019s face brightened. \u201cCould we visit Anne for just a little while? I haven\u2019t seen her in years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt one time she routinely prayed for her son,\u201d Gabriel explained as he guided them out of his quarters and to a convenient location to view Anne\u2019s little spot on Earth. \u201cFor quite a while after the divorce, she brought Roy\u2019s hardened heart to God\u2019s attention, but when she didn\u2019t see results, her faith weakened. Now only an infrequent prayer comes our way.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t surprise me,\u201d Shirley whispered. \u201cWhen I was assigned to her mother...\u201d She paused and looked up guiltily, as if afraid she\u2019d said more than permissible. \u201cI\u2019m sure all Anne really wants is for her son to be happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut happiness is a condition of the mind, not of circumstances,\u201d Gabriel reminded them. \u201cThat appears to be a most difficult lesson for humans. They expect to find happiness in things, which we all know is impossible.\u201d Sadly he shook his head. \u201cThey repeatedly fail to see what should be perfectly logical.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHumans require a lot of patience,\u201d Goodness said, trying hard to sound knowledgeable.</p><p>Gabriel studied the trio, as though gauging how much he could trust them if he did grant them passage back to Earth. Goodness did her utmost to look serene and confident. She fully intended to be good, but she couldn\u2019t count on Mercy. Shirley was iffy, too. Her friend seemed to have a special fondness for Anne, and there was no telling what she\u2019d do once they arrived on Earth.</p> <p>Goodness didn\u2019t begrudge Gabriel his doubts. The trio always left Heaven with the best intentions, but when they began to mingle with humans, their powers to resist grew increasingly weak. They found it impossible not to interfere in situations that hadn\u2019t been assigned to them\u2014which inevitably got them into trouble.</p><p>Gabriel\u2019s gaze was drawn back to the big blue sphere, the view of Earth from Heaven.</p><p>Goodness peered closer but couldn\u2019t make out anything yet. Gabriel would need to bring everything into focus.</p><p>\u201cYes, I\u2019m afraid that where her son is concerned, Anne\u2019s lost hope,\u201d the Archangel murmured sadly. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t understand that some things need to be believed in order to be seen.\u201d</p><p>Goodness was impressed. \u201cThat\u2019s so wise.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPoor Anne,\u201d Shirley whispered, her brow wrinkled in worry.</p><p>\u201cWe can help her, I\u2019m sure,\u201d Mercy insisted, sidling next to Shirley. \u201cAnne needs us.\u201d She glanced from Gabriel to Shirley, looking for confirmation.</p><p>Goodness bit her tongue to keep from chastising her friend. They couldn\u2019t act too eager, otherwise Gabriel might become suspicious. He might wonder if they had ulterior motives for wanting to visit Earth. As unobtrusively as possible, she made a small waving motion with her hand, hoping Mercy would get the message.</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Mercy added with an exaggerated sigh, \u201cthere are any number of angels more qualified than the three of us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, there are,\u201d Gabriel said bluntly.</p><p>\u201cI thought you said we could see her from here,\u201d Shirley said, squinting through the thick cloud cover.</p> <p>For a moment Gabriel seemed to be having second thoughts. His expression became more severe as he stared at them. Little wonder humans were terrified of Gabriel, Goodness reflected. His imposing stature was enough to intimidate the bravest men. That was one reason, she supposed, that he was only sent from Heaven on the most serious of missions.</p><p>Slowly he raised his massive arms and with one sweeping motion the clouds cleared and the mist gradually thinned, revealing the cottage surrounded by tall fir trees. Then Anne came into view. She stood in her art room, a paintbrush in her hand. A few Christmas decorations hung here and there, as if a halfhearted effort had been made to display them.</p><p>Once more Shirley leaned forward, peering downward. \u201cAnne\u2019s painting,\u201d she said, and pointed to the scene below.</p><p>Once the mist faded completely, Goodness stepped closer to her friends to get a better look. Just as Shirley had declared, Anne Fletcher stood in front of an easel, apparently deep in thought.</p><p>Goodness examined the painting and was pleasantly surprised. Shirley had been right; the woman was a talented artist. She used bold, distinctive colors and strong, confident lines. But despite the beauty of her landscape, Anne was obviously dissatisfied. She seemed about to paint over the canvas and destroy her work. Instead, she set her brush and palette aside and slumped into a chair. Tilting her chin, Anne stared at the ceiling, blinking back tears.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Shirley asked, turning to Gabriel for an explanation. \u201cShe looks like she\u2019s going to cry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s worrying about her son,\u201d Gabriel said. \u201cShe\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut she\u2019s prayed for him,\u201d Shirley broke in. \u201cAnne knows to leave matters with God. Her mother taught her the importance of trusting in God,\u201d she said, adding, \u201cBut that was so long ago....\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShe spoke to her son a little while ago, and things are even worse than she realized. She\u2019s given up hope.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut she prayed\u2014how can you say that?\u201d Shirley demanded. \u201cAfter everything she\u2019s been through, after all she\u2019s suffered. Look,\u201d she cried, gesturing at the weeping woman, \u201cthere\u2019s no bitterness or hatred in her, no ill will toward Burton and his new wife.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s true,\u201d Gabriel agreed, and he seemed truly astonished by the simple human act of forgiveness. \u201cAnne has forgiven her husband for what he did to her, but she feels helpless to influence her son.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy is God taking so long to answer?\u201d Shirley asked, pacing restlessly.</p><p>\u201cHe has His reasons. It\u2019s not for us to second-guess the Creator of the Universe.\u201d</p><p>For an instant, Shirley seemed about to argue, but Goodness intervened. \u201cPerhaps God knows that the right woman\u2019s going to come along. A woman who\u2019ll open Roy\u2019s eyes\u2014and his heart. It can\u2019t be an ordinary woman, but one strong-willed enough to stand up to his arrogance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho could that be?\u201d Mercy asked, looking wide-eyed at Gabriel.</p><p>\u201cThis woman is waiting to be found, and I\u2019m sending you to Earth to find her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going back?\u201d Goodness hadn\u2019t been convinced that Gabriel would actually agree, since he so obviously had reservations about their dependability. She was thrilled. And just before Christmas, too! Oh yes, this was excellent news, the best yet.</p><p>\u201cYou may go,\u201d Gabriel said in a guarded voice, \u201cbut with a few stipulations. You have less than a month\u2014the prayer request must be answered before Christmas Eve, and in the process your goal is to teach these humans a lesson. Can you do it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can,\u201d Shirley promised.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll be better than ever,\u201d Mercy said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll keep an eye on them both,\u201d Goodness assured the Archangel.</p><p>\u201cBut who\u2019ll watch you?\u201d he asked, cocking one dark brow.</p><p>Goodness sputtered, hardly knowing how to respond, then straightened. She recited her mission statement. \u201cI...I will faithfully fulfill my duties as an Ambassador of the Almighty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell said.\u201d Gabriel nodded with approval, but Goodness wasn\u2019t fooled. One wrong move, and they\u2019d be immediately jerked back from Earth with its multitude of fascinating distractions.</p><p>A short while later, the three of them were gathered in Anne Fletcher\u2019s art room. It was a small area with plenty of light. Canvasses were stacked against the wall, some painted, others a pristine white, waiting to come to life. Anne sat near a phone, and after a long moment, picked it up.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s she calling?\u201d Mercy asked.</p><p>\u201cShh,\u201d Goodness warned. Thankfully, Anne wasn\u2019t aware of their presence nor could she hear their voices, unless special arrangements had been made well in advance. They were required to go to Gabriel for permission to reveal themselves\u2014not that there weren\u2019t inventive ways around that.</p><p>\u201cListen,\u201d Shirley said, hushing them all.</p><p>Anne punched out the private number to Roy\u2019s office. There was no guarantee that he\u2019d speak to her. She didn\u2019t doubt that he loved her, but her son was avoiding her these days. Anne wasn\u2019t fooled; she knew why he was doing this. While she tried not to nag him, Anne realized she must sound like a distant echo, repeating the same message over and over. No wonder he looked for ways to sidetrack her\u2014or avoid her altogether.</p><p>\u201cRoy Fletcher,\u201d came his gruff, disembodied voice.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s your mother,\u201d she said with a cheerful lilt. \u201cI haven\u2019t heard from you in ages.\u201d She wanted to bite her tongue. This wasn\u2019t how she\u2019d intended to start their conversation. Why, oh, why had she said that? It must have seemed like a chastisement, and that was the last thing she wanted Roy to think. \u201cBut I know how busy you are,\u201d she said, faltering a little.</p><p>\u201cDo you need anything?\u201d he asked, already sounding bored. He\u2019d be quick to write a check, and had on several occasions, although she\u2019d never cashed one. She wondered if he\u2019d noticed. It wasn\u2019t Roy\u2019s money she wanted, it was his happiness. No amount of money he gave or received, no matter how generous, could buy that.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine, Roy. And you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBusy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you telling me you can\u2019t talk now?\u201d Or any other time, she thought, disheartened.</p><p>He hesitated. \u201cI have five minutes.\u201d</p><p>Anne almost had the feeling he was setting a timer. \u201cI called to tell you I\u2019m coming into Seattle next Thursday.\u201d The trip required a ferry crossing and a half-hour drive; it often took a couple of hours to make the journey across Puget Sound.</p><p>\u201cAny particular reason?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m meeting Marta Rosenberg for dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShould I know the name?\u201d Roy asked.</p><p>Anne sighed, resigned now to his lack of interest and enthusiasm. Except for his work, everything in life seemed to be an effort for Roy.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no reason you should remember the name,\u201d she told him. \u201cMarta and I were good friends in college. We\u2019ve kept in touch through the years\u2014Christmas cards, that sort of thing. She\u2019s made a real name for herself in New York as an art dealer and gallery owner.\u201d</p><p>Surprisingly, that piqued his interest. \u201cIs she going to sell your paintings?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, hardly,\u201d Anne said, embarrassed at the idea. Anne would never approach her friend with such a request. Her paintings were amateurish compared to the work Marta sold, work by big names. Revered artists. \u201cI was hoping you and I could meet beforehand,\u201d Anne suggested. She wanted to get to her main reason for calling before her allotted time elapsed.</p><p>\u201cI have a half hour open at lunchtime,\u201d Roy murmured.</p><p>Anne\u2019s spirits lifted. \u201cThat would be lovely. I\u2019m meeting Marta at seven and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll pencil you in for noon. I have a meeting and I might be a few minutes late, so don\u2019t be upset if you\u2019re left twiddling your thumbs for a while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was thinking I might decorate the windows at your office building before Christmas,\u201d she hurriedly added.</p><p>Her remark was followed by a lengthy pause. \u201cYou want to do what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPaint your windows, you know, for Christmas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs this a joke, Mother?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019ll give a festive air to the complex. I was thinking of those big windows in the front lobby. In case you hadn\u2019t noticed, \u2019tis the season, Roy. Don\u2019t you remember how we used to paint the windows at the house every year?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Again his response was slow and edged with sadness. \u201cOf course I remember, but I was a kid then. I\u2019ve outgrown things like that.\u201d</p><p>Anne didn\u2019t feel that way in the least. She wanted to do whatever she could to resurrect happy memories for him. \u201cYou won\u2019t mind, though, will you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf it pleases you, then by all means paint.\u201d His voice softened slightly. \u201cI have to go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d Her five minutes was up.</p> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t promise you lunch, but I\u2019ll do my best to squeeze you in.\u201d With that, the phone line went dead.</p><p>Anne set the receiver back in its cradle as if it weighed thirty pounds.</p><p>\u201cSqueeze her in!\u201d Mercy cried, outraged. \u201cThis is worse than I thought. Anne\u2019s his mother! How are we ever going to find a woman willing to put up with that kind of behavior?\u201d</p><p>Actually, Roy Fletcher was in worse shape than anyone had thought, Goodness mused. They had their work cut out for them.</p><p>\u201cOh, dear, look,\u201d Shirley whispered.</p> <p>Anne Fletcher\u2019s hand remained on the telephone, as if she was trying to maintain an illusion of contact with her son. Her head fell forward and her shoulders slouched. Suddenly, before the other angels could react, Shirley slipped into the middle of the room.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Goodness asked, reaching out unsuccessfully to stop her.</p><p>\u201cAnne needs encouragement,\u201d Shirley insisted. \u201cShe can\u2019t continue like this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to get us pulled off this assignment,\u201d Mercy warned. \u201cWe haven\u2019t been on Earth five minutes. That\u2019s a record even for us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you remember what Gabriel said?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDarn right I do! One wrong move and we\u2019re out of here.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d Shirley countered, \u201che said some things had to be believed in order to be seen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut he didn\u2019t say for us to leap in and do something we know isn\u2019t allowed.\u201d</p><p>Mercy\u2019s warning, however, went unheeded. \u201cWhat\u2019s Shirley going to do?\u201d she asked Goodness.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid to find out,\u201d Goodness replied.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to prove to Anne that she should believe,\u201d Shirley announced grandly.</p><p>\u201cBut that\u2019s the opposite of what Gabriel meant,\u201d Mercy argued.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m doing it,\u201d Shirley said.</p><p>Sure enough, she stepped through the thin layer of truth that separated angels from humans. For a moment she did nothing but soak in the earthly environment. Then, in a display of heavenly grace, the angel unfolded her wings, extending them to their complete and glorious length. With the full splendor of the Lord reflecting upon her, she revealed herself to Anne.</p> <p>Anne Fletcher gasped and placed her hand over her mouth. To her credit, the human seemed suitably impressed. Slowly Anne dropped her hand and stared hard at Shirley, as if she expected her to disappear. She blinked once and then again, obviously testing to see if this could possibly be her imagination. Anne shaded her eyes from the light. Then, still staring, she reached for a pad and pencil and started to sketch.</p><p>\u201cOh, no.\u201d</p><p>Mercy looked around, certain they were about to lose all visitation rights until the next millennium. Nothing happened.</p><p>Seconds later, Shirley was back. Goodness forced herself to keep quiet and not reprimand her friend. Mercy had no such restraint.</p><p>\u201cHow could you?\u201d she wailed.</p><p>\u201cAnne needed a sign,\u201d Shirley said, \u201cand I gave it to her. God is working, and I wanted her to know that\u2014to believe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut look what she\u2019s doing!\u201d Mercy cried, watching as Anne worked on the sketch, her fingers moving at a furious pace as if she was struggling to get everything she\u2019d seen down on paper before it faded from memory.</p><p>Goodness could hardly wait until Gabriel heard about this.</p><p>Four</p><p>Julie was proud of her father, and so pleased that he\u2019d been granted this opportunity. Abraham Lincoln Junior High where she taught was only a short distance from Fletcher Industries. The first day he was scheduled to work, she suggested she ride in with him and then take her bike from the complex to the school. She planned to do the same thing in reverse every afternoon, unless there was a late meeting scheduled or one of her teams had a practice or a game. It was hard to find opportunities to exercise, and this seemed a good solution, in addition to giving her extra time with her father. Folding a change of clothes into her backpack, she dressed in her spandex pants and nylon shirt. She attached her bicycle to the carrier on the rear of the Ford, then joined her father in the front seat.</p><p>\u201cAre you excited?\u201d she asked. If he wasn\u2019t, she certainly was. Her father could use a psychological boost. It\u2019d been a long dry spell for both of them.</p><p>He shrugged.</p><p>\u201cWell, I am.\u201d It felt, in some strange, inexplicable way, as if they could finally begin to heal\u2014as if their time of grieving was about to end. Not that either of them would forget Darlene Wilcoff. She was alive in their hearts and would forever remain a part of them. Now, four months following her death, this crisp, clear late-November morning seemed filled with renewed promise.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sure about this bicycle business?\u201d her father muttered as he started the engine. \u201cI don\u2019t like the idea of you riding back in the dark.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s perfectly safe, Dad,\u201d she said, half-tempted to say that at thirty, she was well beyond the age of needing parental supervision. \u201cI\u2019m wearing a helmet and a vest that reflects in the dark, plus the bike has a flashing light in the front and the back.\u201d</p><p>He grunted, obviously still disapproving, but didn\u2019t argue further. As they reached Fletcher Industries, her father slowed. \u201cYou\u2019ll need to be here at five this afternoon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will.\u201d That would allow her time to finish up some paperwork and cycle back to the complex. \u201cWhere would you like me to meet you?\u201d</p><p>He frowned as if he hadn\u2019t considered this earlier. \u201cIn front of the building would probably be best. The parking lot is a secure area and I don\u2019t want you going in there without me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. I\u2019ll see you at five.\u201d</p><p>Her father pulled up close to the tall office building and put his car in Park while Julie climbed out. Other cars had already started to arrive, and a delivery truck circled toward the back of the complex.</p><p>Julie walked to the rear of the Ford and removed her ten-speed. Her father drove off once he\u2019d pointed out where they should meet. His taillights disappeared as he turned the corner and drove toward the employees\u2019 designated parking area, joining a line of other vehicles.</p><p>Julie had just finished snapping the helmet strap under her chin when a sharp male voice spoke from somewhere behind her. She whirled around.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your business here?\u201d Oh, great, her father\u2019s first day and she was going to have a confrontation with a security guard.</p><p>\u201cHello,\u201d she said, smiling warmly. \u201cI\u2019m Julie Wilcoff. My father\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI asked you to state your business.\u201d</p><p>The man was no guard, Julie could now see. He was tall, an inch or two more than her five foot eleven, and dressed in a dark suit, expensive, judging by the cut, although she didn\u2019t have a discerning eye when it came to fashion. He might have been handsome, but scowling as he was, he appeared intimidating and in no mood for excuses.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m on my way to school.\u201d</p><p>His expression implied that she was lying.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not a student.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m a teacher. My father dropped me off here to show me where I should meet him tonight when he\u2019s finished work. Are you Roy Fletcher?\u201d This could be the man her father had described; his attitude certainly resembled that of the company owner.</p><p>The man ignored her question. \u201cYour father is Dean Wilcoff?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d She had to bite back the urge to call him sir. It\u2019d been a long time since any man had intimidated her, and she wasn\u2019t about to let it show. \u201cI didn\u2019t realize there were rules against riding bicycles in this complex.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere aren\u2019t. Be on your way,\u201d he ordered, starting toward the front door.</p><p>Julie planted one hand on her hip and glared at him. \u201cI beg your pardon,\u201d she said in her best schoolteacher voice. How dare he speak to her like this!</p><p>He paused, and then with exaggerated patience, said, \u201cYou\u2019re free to go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn case you\u2019re unaware of it, I was entitled to do so before.\u201d No wonder her father had taken a dislike to Mr. High-and-Mighty. He was, without exception, the most disagreeable person she\u2019d ever met. His arrogance was absolutely staggering.</p><p>He turned his back on her and walked into the building.</p><p>Fuming, Julie climbed on her bike and locked her cleats into the pedals. She rode hard, her anger driving her faster and faster as she left the complex and then merged with traffic on the main thoroughfare outside Fletcher Industries. She arrived at Abraham Lincoln a good ten minutes earlier than she\u2019d estimated. She parked her bicycle, still muttering to herself, and carefully took off her helmet.</p><p>\u201cMornin\u2019,\u201d Penny Angelo, who taught English, said cheerfully as she passed the bicycle rack, briefcase in hand.</p><p>Julie managed a halfhearted greeting and then added, her outrage flaring back to life, \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t believe what just happened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you cross paths with a rude driver?\u201d Penny guessed, eyeing her ten-speed.</p><p>\u201cNo, a tyrant!\u201d Julie waited for her heart to stop pounding and exhaled slowly in an effort to regain perspective. She refused to let the encounter affect the rest of her day. \u201cIt\u2019s behind me now,\u201d she said, making a determined effort to put Roy Fletcher out of her mind. If it had been him. He hadn\u2019t answered her question, but from his demeanor and attitude she could only assume she\u2019d run headlong into the company\u2019s owner.</p><p>Despite her rough start that morning, Julie had a good day. She enjoyed teaching; she was strict but fair, and her students understood that and respected her for it. After her last class, Julie changed out of her work clothes and back into her cycling gear and pedaled the five miles to Fletcher Industries.</p><p>Invigorated, she arrived at the spot her father had suggested. She hadn\u2019t been there more than a few minutes when a uniformed guard approached. It seemed she was destined for trouble. Probably Mr. Nose-in-the-Air had ordered him to chase her off. Well, if that was the case, she was ready. She had every right to be there, and she intended to point that out.</p><p>\u201cMs. Wilcoff?\u201d the young man asked politely. His name tag read Jason.</p><p>She relaxed her stance. \u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour father said he\u2019d be a bit late and asked that you meet him in his office.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll show you up.\u201d</p><p>What a difference from the way she\u2019d been greeted that morning! The guard indicated where she could park her bike and then led her into the building. Entering the elevator, dressed as she was, Julie felt a bit self-conscious. She smiled shyly at a couple of women and decided that perhaps this bike-riding business wasn\u2019t the best idea, after all, especially if she was going to be meeting people. She\u2019d give it a week and see how it went. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Her father\u2019s office was on the third floor. He looked up and smiled when she came into the room. \u201cHow was your day?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat,\u201d she said, dropping into a chair. \u201cHow about yours?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine, fine. I won\u2019t be long.\u201d He returned to the computer screen, which he studied intently. \u201cJust checking some employee records,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m getting the hang of this computer stuff now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake your time, I\u2019m in no hurry.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWilcoff.\u201d The same unfriendly voice that had almost ruined her morning sounded from the doorway.</p><p>Julie turned her head to find the same unfriendly man\u2014presumably Roy Fletcher. His eyes narrowed when he saw her.</p><p>\u201cYou again?\u201d he said.</p><p>Her father rose and cast a glance from his employer to Julie. \u201cThis is my daughter, Julie. You\u2019ve met?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had the pleasure this morning.\u201d Fletcher held out his hand.</p> <p>They exchanged brief handshakes. \u201cPleasure isn\u2019t exactly the word I\u2019d use,\u201d Julie primly informed him.</p><p>\u201cYou teach English?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said in a clipped voice. \u201cEtiquette.\u201d</p><p>The merest hint of a smile touched his mouth. \u201cI see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJulie teaches physical education, Mr. Fletcher,\u201d her father corrected, apparently surprised she\u2019d claim otherwise.</p><p>Fletcher focused his attention on Dean. \u201cI wanted to let you know my mother\u2019s stopping by in the next couple of weeks to paint a Christmas scene on the lobby windows.\u201d He frowned. \u201cShe seems to think some Christmas cheer will put me in the holiday mood,\u201d he said with heavy sarcasm.</p> <p>Julie doubted he was interested in goodwill, now or at any other time of the year.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll make sure no one bothers Mrs. Fletcher,\u201d her father assured him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d appreciate it.\u201d He turned to go, then changed his mind. \u201cHow was your first day?\u201d</p><p>Her father hesitated. \u201cChallenging.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood, glad to hear it.\u201d With that, Fletcher was gone as fast as he\u2019d appeared.</p><p>\u201cGood, glad to hear it,\u201d Julie repeated, and rolled her eyes. \u201cIs that the most unpleasant man you\u2019ve ever met in your life or what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s my employer, Julie, and he has more important matters on his mind than either you or me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow can you defend him?\u201d she cried. \u201cYou said he was cold, but I had no idea he was this cold.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe has a lot of responsibilities,\u201d her father said. \u201cI\u2019ve only been with the company one day, but I can see that people respect him, which says a great deal. There has to be a reason the staff feels like that about him.\u201d</p><p>If her father wanted to defend the tyrant, fine. She wasn\u2019t going to argue with him.</p><p>\u201cI wonder what made him like this,\u201d she murmured while her father cleared off his desk. She didn\u2019t expect an answer and he didn\u2019t give her one. Perhaps eventually she\u2019d learn more about Roy Fletcher. Then again, perhaps she wouldn\u2019t. Because Julie didn\u2019t care if she ever saw him again.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s her,\u201d Mercy shouted joyously, clapping her hands with delight. \u201cShe\u2019s the woman we\u2019ve been sent to find for Anne\u2019s son.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d Shirley asked, looking around the empty office.</p><p>\u201cJulie, of course,\u201d Mercy said irritably. \u201cDean Wilcoff\u2019s daughter.\u201d Mercy seemed disappointed that they didn\u2019t see things as plainly as she did.</p><p>\u201cJulie? This Julie?\u201d Goodness repeated, incredulous. \u201cGet out of here!\u201d Julie Wilcoff wasn\u2019t at all the kind of woman she had in mind. Besides, anyone could see those two had started off on the wrong foot. Julie openly disliked the man. Roy\u2019s feelings were harder to read, but she wouldn\u2019t be surprised if he\u2019d had trouble remembering Julie\u2019s name two minutes after they\u2019d met.</p><p>\u201cOpen your eyes,\u201d Mercy said, sitting on the file cabinet in Wilcoff\u2019s darkened office. \u201cThey\u2019re perfect for each other.\u201d</p><p>Shirley remained skeptical. \u201cSorry, I just can\u2019t picture it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, neither,\u201d Goodness concurred. She tried to imagine them as a couple. They didn\u2019t fit together, somehow. They both had strong personalities that would constantly collide. Goodness thought a gentle, loving woman would be better suited to the likes of Roy Fletcher. Someone soft and quiet. Someone less opinionated, more compromising. They hadn\u2019t found this paragon yet, but give them time and they would. Of course, they didn\u2019t have a lot of time. Their assignment on Earth was limited to a short three weeks.</p><p>\u201cAm I the only one here with a brain?\u201d Mercy groaned. \u201cJulie\u2019s the right woman because she isn\u2019t going to let him intimidate her. She\u2019s got the strength of will to stand up to him, and he\u2019ll respect her for that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue,\u201d Shirley reluctantly agreed. \u201cI don\u2019t mean to be unkind here, but have you noticed that...well, Julie\u2019s a very sweet girl, but...\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s a woman with all the right qualifications.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, of course, but, well, she\u2019s rather...large.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI believe the term Shirley is looking for,\u201d Goodness said, stepping forward, \u201cis big-boned.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s tall and she\u2019s...solid,\u201d Mercy said forcefully. \u201cDon\u2019t forget, she played sports all those years. She\u2019s not some skinny little size-two model type.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you mean well,\u201d Goodness said, not wanting any more distractions, \u201cbut Anne\u2019s son is handsome and wealthy, and frankly, he can have any woman he wants.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s well aware of that,\u201d Mercy declared, \u201cand he doesn\u2019t care.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAimee was blond and beautiful,\u201d Shirley said.</p><p>\u201cHow do you know that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...peeked at the file on Gabriel\u2019s desk when no one was around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did what?\u201d Goodness burst out.</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter what Aimee looks like,\u201d Mercy insisted. \u201cOkay, so she was blond and cute. Didn\u2019t work out, though, did it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cObviously not,\u201d Goodness said grudgingly.</p><p>\u201cDo you think he\u2019s still in love with her?\u201d Shirley asked.</p><p>\u201cI doubt it.\u201d Although Goodness couldn\u2019t know for sure, she suspected that Roy had put Aimee completely out of his mind\u2014her and every other woman in the universe.</p><p>This was what made their mission so difficult. It was up to the three of them to find Roy a woman who would warm his cold, empty heart and teach him about love. No wonder Gabriel had warned them. This was perhaps their most difficult assignment to date.</p><p>\u201cI like Julie,\u201d Mercy whispered.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s apple pandowdy and Fletcher wants cheesecake,\u201d Goodness said, proud of her analogy.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s had cheesecake.\u201d Shirley shot upward to join Mercy, crowding next to her on the filing cabinet. \u201cI\u2019m beginning to think Mercy\u2019s right. Roy\u2019s lost his taste for the exotic. He needs a woman with substance, a woman who\u2019s truly his equal.\u201d</p><p>Goodness thought perhaps her fellow Prayer Ambassadors had a point, but convincing Roy wouldn\u2019t be easy. \u201cJust how are we going to persuade him to give Julie a second look?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what about Julie?\u201d Shirley demanded. \u201cShe didn\u2019t exactly fall for him at first sight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you\u2019re right,\u201d Goodness said. \u201cRoy might need a bit of angelic assistance, but Julie\u2019s going to be even harder to convince.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, dear, I hadn\u2019t thought of that,\u201d Mercy muttered. \u201cShe\u2019s taken a rather keen dislike to him, hasn\u2019t she.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat can be fixed, too.\u201d</p><p>Goodness and Mercy turned to look at their friend. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>Shirley chortled happily. \u201cWhy don\u2019t I show you, instead?\u201d</p><p>Five</p><p>\u201cI hate the idea of you having to work on a Saturday,\u201d Julie said as her father prepared to walk out the door. He\u2019d explained that it was because of the Thanksgiving holiday that had just passed.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t mind. There\u2019s a lot to do.\u201d She watched him go and realized it\u2019d been a very long time since she\u2019d seen her father content. After only a few days, she was aware of what this new job had done for him. Once again, Julie was grateful that he\u2019d been given this chance to prove himself. Despite her personal feelings about Fletcher, whom she considered both rude and egotistical, she appreciated the faith he\u2019d placed in her father. Her sister agreed. They exchanged daily e-mails; Emily had told Julie she was encouraged by the changes she already saw in their father and suggested Julie make an effort to get along with the \u201cbig boss\u201d if she saw him again\u2014which she probably wouldn\u2019t.</p><p>Julie leaned against the door and sighed once her father had left for work. A sigh of relief, of satisfaction. Looking heavenward, she whispered, \u201cWe\u2019re going to be all right, Mom. We\u2019re moving ahead with our lives.\u201d Deep in her heart, she knew her mother heard her and approved.</p><p>The surprising thing Julie had learned in the past year was that life does go on. Despite her loss, despite her pain, she\u2019d come to understand that. Clich\u00e9d though it sounded, it was true. Gradually, as she resumed her routines and her habits, it became easier. This didn\u2019t mean she missed her mother any less or had stopped thinking about her\u2014that would\u2019ve been impossible\u2014but life continued.</p><p>After showering and doing a few housecleaning tasks, Julie tackled the kitchen. It was when she opened the refrigerator that she noticed her father\u2019s lunch. He\u2019d forgotten it. Knowing he\u2019d go without rather than pick up something at a restaurant, she called his work number. When he wasn\u2019t available, she asked the man who answered to please let her father know she\u2019d deliver his lunch later that morning.</p><p>As she left the house, Julie decided this was the perfect opportunity to get in some exercise. Soon she\u2019d start training for the STP, the annual two-hundred-mile bicycle ride between Seattle and Portland, Oregon. The two-day event was held every July and she\u2019d participated faithfully until her mother\u2019s illness. Julie had skipped the past two years, but was eager to get back into a regular training program.</p><p>Dressed in her biking gear, she wheeled her ten-speed out of the garage and tucked her father\u2019s lunch in one of the paniers over the rear wheels. Then she headed for Fletcher Industries. It felt good to work hard, to pump her legs and exercise her lungs. At top speed she turned off the busy road and into the long driveway that led to the office complex. In the small mirror attached to her helmet, she saw a black sedan turning in behind her. The driveway was narrow and there wasn\u2019t room for her to move over or allow the vehicle to pass. Leaning forward as far as she could, her arms braced against the handlebars, Julie reached maximum speed, forcing her legs to pedal even faster.</p><p>Obviously the sedan\u2019s driver hadn\u2019t seen her. Julie gasped as the black vehicle hit her rear tire. The collision sent her hurtling through the air, arms flailing. Her heart stopped when she realized there was no way to avoid missing a fir tree. A scream froze in her throat. If her head slammed against the tree at this speed, helmet or not, she\u2019d be a goner. The last thought she had before impact was a fervent hope that her father not be the one to identify her body. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Then she landed.</p><p>It was as though she\u2019d collided with a pile of pillows. Following impact with the tree, she fell on her backside with a solid thump. Too stunned to react, Julie sat there. By any law of nature, she should be badly injured.</p><p>Only, she wasn\u2019t. In fact, she seemed to be unscathed. Surely that was impossible!</p><p>\u201cAre you all right?\u201d</p> <p>A pale, shaken Roy Fletcher stood above her. Equally shaken, Julie looked up at him and blinked several times, unable to find her tongue.</p><p>\u201cI should be dead,\u201d she whispered, and thrust out her hand, assuming he\u2019d help her up.</p><p>\u201cYou should be arrested for pulling a stunt like that,\u201d he said angrily, ignoring her hand. \u201cStay put until I can get an ambulance and the police.\u201d He took out his cell phone and started frantically punching numbers.</p><p>He wanted her arrested. Of all the nerve! \u201cListen here,\u201d she cried, still in a sitting position. \u201cYou were the one who ran into me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re insane!\u201d He was shouting now. \u201cNot you,\u201d he said into the tiny cell phone and clicked it off. \u201cI didn\u2019t touch you.\u201d He stared down at her, a puzzled look on his face. \u201cI can\u2019t believe you\u2019re not hurt.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m fine...I think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was the most idiotic stunt I\u2019ve ever seen. Why did you do it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe?\u201d He\u2019d run into her. And here he was yelling at her when the entire accident had been his fault. \u201cDo you honestly think I voluntarily flew through the air and collided with a tree?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head and rubbed his eyes as though to clear his vision. \u201cI don\u2019t know what the hell happened, but I didn\u2019t hit you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. Whatever. Just help me up.\u201d She extended her arm to him a second time. Unsteady as she felt, she needed the assistance.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d He raised both hands. \u201cStay put,\u201d he said again. \u201cYou could\u2019ve broken something and don\u2019t know it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019d know it,\u201d she muttered. While she admitted to being shaken, she wasn\u2019t about to let him bully her. Although the trip to her feet lacked grace, she was soon upright.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t move,\u201d he said. \u201cWait for the paramedics.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m perfectly all right,\u201d she insisted, removing her helmet.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t be sure of that. Now do as I say and stay where you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you kindly be quiet and stop giving me orders?\u201d Disgruntled, she brushed the dirt from her backside. So far, so good. Nothing even ached. She could see no scrapes or bruises.</p><p>Fletcher shook his head again, his expression one of hopelessness. \u201cAre you always this unreasonable?\u201d</p><p>Examining her ten-speed, Julie wanted to weep. It was ruined. \u201cIf you didn\u2019t hit me, how did this happen?\u201d Maybe he planned to claim his car hadn\u2019t touched her bike, but she had evidence that said otherwise.</p><p>\u201cIf you hit that tree, why aren\u2019t you injured?\u201d he snapped.</p> <p>Julie didn\u2019t have an answer for him anymore than he did for her. They stood glaring at each other, both unwilling to back down, when the ambulance, siren blaring, rounded the corner.</p><p>Before she could protest, two paramedics had her sitting down. While Fletcher explained what had happened, Julie, under protest, was placed on a stretcher. \u201cWould someone please listen to me,\u201d she said as she struggled to sit up. \u201cI\u2019m fine. I don\u2019t even have any bruises. I\u2019m not hurt.\u201d</p><p>The taller of the two paramedics picked up her dented helmet. \u201cYou hit that tree?\u201d he asked incredulously.</p><p>\u201cI saw it with my own eyes,\u201d Fletcher confirmed.</p><p>\u201cHe saw it because he ran into me,\u201d Julie immediately said. He wasn\u2019t an innocent bystander in this accident. He\u2019d caused it.</p><p>\u201cMy car didn\u2019t touch her bike.\u201d</p><p>By this time, the police had arrived, and a cruiser pulled up behind the ambulance. Fletcher scowled at her as if to say this was all her fault, but he\u2019d contacted the authorities. She hadn\u2019t wanted to. While the police officer talked to Fletcher, Julie answered the paramedics\u2019 questions. When they suggested she be checked out at the hospital, she refused.</p><p>\u201cLook,\u201d she said, dismissing their concern, \u201cI\u2019m none the worse for wear.\u201d The last thing she wanted was to show up at the hospital in an ambulance when she wasn\u2019t even hurt.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll have your own doctor examine you?\u201d the second man asked.</p><p>\u201cI will,\u201d she promised.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see that she does,\u201d Fletcher added.</p><p>The policeman knelt down in front of Fletcher\u2019s sedan. \u201cI don\u2019t see any marks here.\u201d</p><p>Fletcher looked at Julie, his eyes full of suspicion. \u201cI don\u2019t know how to explain what happened, but I swear I didn\u2019t hit you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you stop telling me how innocent you are?\u201d Then it dawned on her that he was afraid she was going to sue him. As a man with deep pockets, he\u2019d be worried about lawsuits.</p><p>\u201cNope, I don\u2019t see any evidence here at all,\u201d the police officer said, frowning in puzzlement.</p><p>Men always stick together, Julie thought irritably. Well, if that was what the police had decided, so be it.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll leave it for you two to settle,\u201d the officer said.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Roy told him.</p><p>The paramedics climbed back into their vehicle and drove off, and shortly afterward the police car followed.</p><p>\u201cLook at my bike!\u201d Julie studied the damage to her ten-speed. The entire back wheel was bent and twisted; the frame had buckled beyond repair.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll buy you another,\u201d Fletcher said as he loaded her crumpled bike into the trunk of his car.</p><p>\u201cSo you are admitting responsibility,\u201d she challenged, hands on her hips.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said in a flat, businesslike tone.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to worry. I have no intention of suing you.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t respond as he opened the passenger door. \u201cGet in,\u201d he said curtly.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you taking me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo my personal physician.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI said I\u2019m not hurt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know what you said. Now are you going to do as I ask, or do I have to put you inside this car myself?\u201d</p><p>Julie could see it was pointless to argue; he was determined to do things his way. \u201cOh, all right,\u201d she said with a complete lack of graciousness.</p><p>He slipped into the driver\u2019s seat and exhaled slowly. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>Julie crossed her arms and tried to stifle a laugh.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s so funny?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing.\u201d But then she couldn\u2019t help it and burst out laughing.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s you,\u201d she said between peals of laughter. \u201cYou said \u2018thank you.\u2019 Were you thanking me for sparing you the effort of having to physically lift me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He apparently lacked even the most rudimentary sense of humor. \u201cI was thanking you for not putting up any more of a fuss than you already have.\u201d</p><p>He started the engine. \u201cWhat are you doing here, anyway?\u201d</p><p>Until he asked, she\u2019d totally forgotten. \u201cDad\u2019s lunch. It\u2019s on the bike. He forgot it this morning and I was taking it to him.\u201d She turned around and looked behind her, wondering if his lunch had somehow survived the collision. \u201cI need to get it to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour father can go without lunch\u2014getting you to a doctor is more important at the moment.\u201d</p><p>She glared at him, and he groaned audibly.</p><p>\u201cOh, all right.\u201d Without her having to say another word, he drove up to the main entrance and parked. \u201cStay where you are,\u201d Fletcher ordered.</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t dream of doing anything else,\u201d she said with exaggerated sweetness.</p><p>He looked as though he doubted her, then quickly leaped out of the car. Removing her sorely bent and abused ten-speed, he leaned it against the building. She couldn\u2019t see what he was doing, but a moment later, the side mirror on the passenger door gave her a brief view of him on his cell phone.</p><p>\u201cDid you tell my dad I wasn\u2019t hurt?\u201d she asked when he got back in the car.</p><p>\u201cNo, I was talking to Dr. Wilbur.\u201d</p><p>Great, just great. Her father would find her bike, a crumpled mess, and assume the worst. \u201cGive me that phone.\u201d</p><p>He stared at her as if no one ever spoke to him like that. \u201cPlease,\u201d she added, realizing how rude she must sound. \u201cI\u2019ve got to tell Dad I\u2019m all right. He won\u2019t know what to think if he finds that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy the way,\u201d he said wryly, \u201chis lunch did not sustain any mishap. The sandwich isn\u2019t smashed at all. I thought you\u2019d want to know.\u201d He reached inside his jacket and handed her the cell, which was the tiniest phone she\u2019d ever seen. It took Julie a few minutes to figure out how it worked.</p><p>Her father was away from his desk and once again she had to leave a message with someone else. She explained the situation and said he should collect his lunch from her bike.</p><p>\u201cAre you happy now?\u201d Fletcher asked when she\u2019d finished her call and returned his phone.</p><p>\u201cEcstatic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. Now sit back and relax.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be so bossy,\u201d she muttered.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be so stubborn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis really isn\u2019t necessary. I have no intention of suing,\u201d she said, not for the first time.</p><p>\u201cGood thing, because you\u2019d lose.\u201d</p><p>Julie thought she saw a hint of a smile. She looked again, certain she must be wrong. The high-and-mighty computer whiz was actually amused. Now this was something to write home about.</p><p>Anne Fletcher pulled the blanket around her shoulders as she attempted to fall to sleep. Opening one eye, she peered at the clock. Two in the morning. She should\u2019ve been asleep hours ago. For no reason she could discern, she\u2019d been having trouble sleeping. No matter what she did\u2014read, drank warm milk, swallowed nighttime aspirin\u2014she remained fully awake.</p><p>With a disgusted sigh, she tossed back the covers and reached for the switch on her lamp. She was wide-awake and any effort to sleep would be a waste of time. Her mind drifted to the memory of the angel who\u2019d appeared to her. She leaned over to get her sketchbook from the bedside table and flipped the pages until she found what she wanted.</p><p>Anne was sure she\u2019d imagined the visitation, and yet it had seemed so real. But none of this made sense. Why would an angel appear to her? Not a word had been spoken, not a sound uttered. But an angel had stood directly in front of her. So strong was the impression that even now Anne could feel the love emanating from the heavenly being.</p><p>To further confuse her, the image had lasted for several minutes, long enough for Anne to grab her sketchbook. Almost as if she was posing, the angel had stood perfectly still while Anne quickly outlined what was before her, unbelievable though it was.</p><p>\u201cShe was so beautiful,\u201d Anne whispered as she studied the drawing with fresh eyes.</p><p>The urge to paint the image onto canvas suddenly gripped her. After a long day in her studio, she should be exhausted; instead, she was filled with excitement. Anne got out of bed. Dressed in her nightgown and slippers, she decided she\u2019d paint until she felt tired. She\u2019d get started and see how things went. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The studio was cold and dark, and she turned on the light, then hurried into the kitchen to make a pot of tea. Taking a pristine canvas from the pile stacked against the wall, she set it on the easel and stepped back. No, bigger. The angel who\u2019d visited her couldn\u2019t be displayed on such a small space. Searching through her supplies, Anne looked for the largest canvas she had.</p><p>She found one in a closet, bigger than anything she\u2019d ever used before, and began to work. Thinking she\u2019d soon grow tired, she didn\u2019t pause. She painted through the night and didn\u2019t stop until daylight. To her amazement, she noticed sunshine pouring in around her. She glanced at the clock on the wall. Almost eight! For the first time in her life she\u2019d worked straight through the night.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll just take a quick break,\u201d she told herself as she went back to bed. Exhausted, she climbed between the sheets and closed her eyes. Seven hours later, around three, she woke feeling refreshed and revitalized.</p><p>After showering and changing clothes, Anne resumed her painting. The next time she looked up, it was dark again. Shocked, she realized she hadn\u2019t eaten in nearly thirty hours. The refrigerator provided a chunk of cheddar and a small cluster of seedless grapes, which she munched on hungrily. She made another pot of tea. Then it was back to work.</p> <p>When she\u2019d finished the painting, she saw daylight again; for the second night in a row, she\u2019d worked without sleep. Stepping back, Anne examined her creation with a critical eye.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she whispered, awed by the painting before her.</p><p>This was her best work to date. She\u2019d call it...Visitation. Smiling, she studied the painting from several angles.</p><p>The phone rang, startling her, and she hurried to answer it.</p><p>\u201cAnne, it\u2019s Marta.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, Marta, hello.\u201d Her mind raced frantically as she tried to remember what day it was. Anne had a terrible feeling she\u2019d missed their dinner appointment\u2014not to mention her lunch with Roy\u2014and sincerely hoped she hadn\u2019t. She thought for a minute; as far as she could calculate, it was Thursday morning. Never had she worked on a project in such a frenzied fashion\u2014to the point that she no longer knew what day of the week it was.</p><p>\u201cI just called to ask if you\u2019d let me see one of your paintings.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Marta, are you sure?\u201d Anne would never presume to ask her friend for this kind of favor.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been hearing good things about your landscapes. A colleague of mine was on the island last summer\u2014Kathy Gruber\u2014and met you. She saw your work at a local exhibit. You remember her, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, of course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSince I\u2019m in town this week, I\u2019d like to take a look at some of your pieces.\u201d</p> <p>Anne glanced at her angel. \u201cI\u2019ll let you see one, but it isn\u2019t a landscape. As it happens, I just finished it.\u201d Eyeing the canvas, she frowned. The painting was too big; she couldn\u2019t bring it into town with her. \u201cIt won\u2019t fit in my car,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI can make a trip out to your place tomorrow, if that\u2019s convenient.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course it is, but we\u2019re still meeting for dinner tonight, aren\u2019t we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t miss it for the world,\u201d Marta assured her.</p><p>\u201cMe, neither,\u201d Anne said.</p><p>They spoke for a few minutes longer. When Anne replaced the receiver, she saw by the clock that she had just enough time for a short nap and a shower before heading into Seattle to meet her son.</p><p>Six</p><p>\u201cNot bad,\u201d Goodness said as she studied the painting. She cocked her head to one side and decided that, as a portrait, it was uncannily accurate. \u201cIt certainly looks like Shirley.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI had no idea I was so lovely,\u201d Shirley said, clasping her hands. \u201cIs that truly the way Anne sees me?\u201d She gazed expectantly at her two friends.</p><p>\u201cSo it seems,\u201d Goodness replied.</p><p>\u201cWhat I want to know,\u201d Mercy began, making herself at home in Anne\u2019s studio, \u201cis why we haven\u2019t been dragged back to Heaven in disgrace.\u201d She glanced pointedly at Shirley. \u201cBy all rights, we should be standing guard at the Pearly Gates after what she did.\u201d</p><p>Mercy was the one more accustomed to causing trouble on Earth. It used to be Shirley who made them tread the straight and narrow, but apparently the job had\u2014unfairly\u2014fallen to Goodness. For this assignment, anyway.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t give Mercy an answer. The Archangel clearly had his own reasons for keeping them on Earth.</p><p>\u201cWe have an important task,\u201d Shirley explained as if that should be obvious. \u201cAnne and Roy need us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeems to me Julie could use a hand, too,\u201d Goodness muttered. She didn\u2019t want to be judgmental, but the woman Mercy considered the answer to Anne\u2019s prayer was being less than cooperative.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Mercy asked. \u201cI thought the accident was a brilliant idea! It got Roy and Julie together, didn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll they did was snipe at each other.\u201d Goodness wasn\u2019t disparaging her friend\u2019s effort, but it simply hadn\u2019t worked.</p><p>\u201cI think I was more optimistic than I should\u2019ve been,\u201d Mercy said when Shirley came and sat next to her.</p><p>\u201cI thought everything went very well.\u201d Shirley seemed undeterred by Julie\u2019s lack of cooperation\u2014or Roy\u2019s. She continued to stare at her portrait with an appreciative eye.</p><p>\u201cHow can you say that?\u201d Goodness cried. In her opinion, Julie wasn\u2019t the only one who needed instruction in romance. It was evident that Shirley had difficulty recognizing what worked and what didn\u2019t. That staged accident certainly hadn\u2019t.</p><p>Shirley sighed. \u201cI had real hope when Roy took her to his own physician.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut then he dumped her there.\u201d</p><p>Mercy nodded vigorously. \u201cThe least he could\u2019ve done was wait long enough to make sure she wasn\u2019t injured.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe did pay for her taxi ride home,\u201d Shirley said. \u201cThey were getting along so well, too.\u201d</p><p>Goodness gaped at her friend and wondered if Shirley had lost all touch with reality. \u201cThey did nothing but argue!\u201d She\u2019d witnessed courtroom battles with less antagonism. Roy Fletcher and Julie Wilcoff were completely unsuited as a couple, but no one wanted to listen to her. As far as she could see, the two of them didn\u2019t even like each other.</p><p>Goodness might never have been in love\u2014romance was for earthly beings\u2014but she had an instinct for matchmaking, if she did say so herself. She\u2019d successfully guided men and women toward each other a time or two, but none of that seemed to matter.</p><p>\u201cYes, they were arguing, but I was well aware even if you weren\u2019t that they like each other,\u201d Mercy insisted.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d Goodness hated to discourage her friends, but she didn\u2019t see it. The spark just wasn\u2019t there. She suspected Julie had become so discouraged about her prospects of finding a husband that she\u2019d lost the ability to attract one. Goodness had wanted to shake the young woman for joking about her weight. A lady never discussed such things! Julie should know better. And Roy\u2014he was one of the walking wounded. He didn\u2019t seem capable of feeling anything, except bitterness and cynicism.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you suggesting?\u201d Mercy asked.</p><p>Goodness knew it was one thing to criticize and another to offer an alternative. But she figured they\u2019d better face up to the truth sooner rather than later. \u201cWe should give it up and search elsewhere.\u201d</p><p>Mercy folded her wings tightly, a sure sign she wasn\u2019t pleased.</p><p>\u201cWe did our part. Now it\u2019s up to the two of them. Agreed?\u201d Goodness gave her friends a stern look.</p><p>\u201cJust who do you think would interest Roy?\u201d Shirley asked.</p><p>\u201cJust who?\u201d Mercy parroted.</p><p>They had Goodness there. \u201cI don\u2019t know\u2014yet,\u201d she said. \u201cBut we\u2019ve done our part. Agreed?\u201d she said again.</p><p>The other two nodded with unmistakable reluctance.</p><p>\u201cNow I say we leave them alone, and if it\u2019s meant to be, it\u2019ll happen without any help from the three of us.\u201d</p><p>Mercy seemed about to argue, but then she sighed loudly. \u201cOh, all right, but I still have a strong feeling that Julie\u2019s the answer to Anne\u2019s prayer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnne,\u201d Shirley whispered. As if she\u2019d suddenly remembered something, the former Guardian Angel announced, \u201cI\u2019ll be right back.\u201d</p><p>Goodness was having none of this. \u201cWhere are you going?\u201d</p><p>Shirley glanced over her shoulder. \u201cI\u2019ll only be a minute.\u201d</p><p>Goodness exchanged a look with Mercy and both of them followed Shirley. The other Ambassador didn\u2019t go far. She crept into Anne\u2019s bedroom and saw that the older woman was in bed, eyes closed.</p><p>\u201cIs she asleep?\u201d Mercy asked, floating above the bed.</p><p>\u201cNot quite,\u201d Shirley answered with confidence.</p><p>Goodness peered closer, but couldn\u2019t tell. After working two consecutive nights on the portrait of Shirley, Anne must be exhausted.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s meeting her son later this morning,\u201d Mercy said. \u201cShe won\u2019t sleep long.\u201d</p><p>Goodness checked the clock radio. \u201cThe alarm is set.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe thinks she only needs an hour or two.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe poor thing,\u201d Shirley said. To Goodness\u2019s surprise, she moved to stand over the older woman. Gently pressing her hand to Anne\u2019s forehead, Shirley leaned forward to whisper, \u201cYou did a beautiful job.\u201d Then she lifted her hand and eased away.</p><p>\u201cLook,\u201d Mercy said, pointing at Anne.</p><p>The softest of smiles touched the woman\u2019s lips, almost as if she\u2019d heard Shirley speak.</p><p>\u201cRoy?\u201d</p><p>Roy glanced up at George Williams, his high-priced corporate attorney. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, did I miss something?\u201d Judging by the pained expression on the other man\u2019s face, apparently he had. Williams had been discussing the profit-and-loss statement for Griffin Plastics, a company Roy was interested in purchasing. He\u2019d half heard Williams drone on about \u201csynergies\u201d\u2014which, as far as he could determine, just meant that Griffin would be able to make the cases for his security software. Sighing, he directed his attention to the papers on his desk. \u201cLet me look these over and get back to you this afternoon.\u201d</p><p>The attorney frowned, gathered his files together and stuffed them in his briefcase.</p><p>\u201cBefore you leave I have a question,\u201d Roy said.</p><p>\u201cAbout the Griffin figures?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Roy reached for a pen and made a few scribbles on a clean sheet of paper while he collected his thoughts. \u201cLate last week, I had a minor...altercation with a bicycle rider.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAltercation?\u201d George Williams repeated.</p><p>\u201cShe fell\u2014\u201d he chose the word carefully \u201c\u2014off her ten-speed and hit a tree.\u201d</p><p>The attorney\u2019s eyes widened and he pulled a blank pad of paper toward him.</p><p>\u201cShe was unhurt,\u201d Roy rushed to add. \u201cAs an innocent bystander, I immediately phoned the paramedics and notified the police.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSo, you\u2019re telling me that you were in no way responsible for her...fall?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s correct.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn other words, you happened along shortly after the accident, and out of consideration for this biker you stopped your vehicle and saw to her welfare?\u201d</p><p>The attorney was describing a rather different scene than the one that had actually occurred, but Roy let him. \u201cYes,\u201d he said slowly, thoughtfully.</p> <p>\u201cYour concern is?\u201d Williams asked.</p><p>\u201cThe woman claims I caused her accident.\u201d Just thinking about it irritated Roy. Although there was no evidence to validate her accusation, Julie Wilcoff had insisted he\u2019d run into the rear of her bike. But he hadn\u2019t even seen her until the last second and had instantly slammed on his brakes. In mentally reviewing the incident, Roy had decided that the sound of his car behind her must have startled Julie; she\u2019d lost focus and hit something in the road, which was the reason she\u2019d catapulted off the bicycle and into the tree.</p><p>That, however, didn\u2019t explain the damage to her ten-speed. The bicycle clearly showed there\u2019d been an impact from the rear. The back wheel was destroyed, the metal twisted and crumpled. Anyone looking at the bike would believe he\u2019d hit Julie. But Roy knew otherwise, and there was no evidence on his car to suggest he\u2019d collided with her.</p><p>\u201cWhat injuries did she sustain?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone. She was unhurt. In fact, she refused medical treatment from the paramedics.\u201d</p> <p>Williams frowned.</p><p>\u201cI took her to my personal physician and he couldn\u2019t find any injuries, either.\u201d</p><p>The attorney scribbled furiously. \u201cWhat have you heard from her since?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing.\u201d That concerned him the most. With his name and his money, he was a natural target for frivolous lawsuits. However, any suit Julie filed might find a sympathetic jury. She could have a case, innocent though he was. It certainly wasn\u2019t unheard of for a jury to award a huge settlement for a minor infraction, depending on how effectively the case was presented.</p><p>\u201cI did feel bad,\u201d Roy said cautiously. \u201cThe accident occurred on company property and I replaced her bicycle.\u201d The new one was twice the machine her old ten-speed had been.</p><p>Again Williams made a notation. Roy worried that replacing Julie\u2019s ten-speed might be seen as an acknowledgment of guilt. He should\u2019ve thought of that earlier.</p> <p>\u201cDid she have a reason for being on company property?\u201d Williams asked.</p><p>\u201cI employ her father.\u201d</p><p>The frown was back, creasing his brow. \u201cI see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWilcoff was only recently hired.\u201d Roy had let chance make the decision. He\u2019d studied the applications, chosen the top three and written the candidates\u2019 names on slips of paper, which he\u2019d placed in an empty coffee mug. He\u2019d drawn one name\u2014Dean\u2019s. So perhaps all of this was fated....</p><p>\u201cHave you spoken to the father since the incident?\u201d</p><p>Roy hadn\u2019t. \u201cAny suggestions on what I should do now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish you\u2019d said something sooner,\u201d the attorney murmured, his expression darkening.</p><p>Roy probably should have, but until now he hadn\u2019t seen the need. It hadn\u2019t been a serious accident. By her own admission and confirmed by his doctor, Julie was perfectly fine. This sort of situation had never occurred before. Williams was probably right; Roy should\u2019ve consulted a lawyer immediately.</p> <p>\u201cTrouble?\u201d he asked, unwilling to borrow any. He had problems enough.</p><p>Williams nodded abruptly. \u201cEven if you haven\u2019t heard from this woman, that doesn\u2019t mean she isn\u2019t filing a lawsuit against you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe hasn\u2019t got a case,\u201d Roy argued. But she did have the damaged bicycle....</p><p>\u201cYou and I know that, but didn\u2019t you say she claims you were responsible for the accident?\u201d</p><p>More times than Roy cared to count. Julie had accused him of running her down. It had become her mantra on their ride to Dr. Wilbur\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cThat tells me there\u2019s a good possibility of a nuisance suit.\u201d</p><p>Roy should have known, should have guessed. \u201cWhat do you think I should do next?\u201d he asked, tension tightening his jaw. The thought of paying this money-grubber a dime went against his principles.</p><p>\u201cOffer her a settlement.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t want to do that, not in the least, but he knew it was better to take care of such unpleasantness quickly. Otherwise he might end up dealing with her in court. She had the damaged bike in her possession. A long, drawn-out trial would drain him emotionally and threaten him financially. And, needless to say, it could destroy his reputation.</p><p>\u201cHow much?\u201d he asked bluntly.</p><p>The attorney hesitated, then said, \u201cMy expertise is corporate law, so perhaps we should let a litigation expert answer that question.\u201d</p><p>Roy refused to waste another minute on this. \u201cHow much would you suggest?\u201d</p><p>Williams shrugged. \u201cTwenty-five thousand should more than compensate her for any pain and suffering.\u201d</p><p>As far as Roy was concerned, that was twenty-five thousand too much. But gritting his teeth, he agreed. He\u2019d order the check cut right away.</p><p>\u201cAnything else?\u201d Williams asked, picking up his briefcase.</p><p>\u201cNo, that should be all.\u201d</p><p>The attorney gestured at the Griffin papers in front of Roy. \u201cYou\u2019ll get back to me this afternoon?\u201d</p><p>Roy nodded. He\u2019d read over the figures and make a decision by the end of the workday. He stood, and the two men shook hands. Williams saw himself out as Roy returned to his chair.</p><p>He leaned back and steepled his fingers, his mind spinning in various directions. Shaking his head, he opened the Griffin file. Try as he might to focus on the facts and figures regarding the buyout, his thoughts wandered to Julie Wilcoff. Part of him wanted to take her at her word\u2014to believe she had no intention of suing him. But his experience with women said otherwise.</p><p>\u201cYou know by now you can\u2019t trust a woman.\u201d Until he heard the words, Roy didn\u2019t realize he\u2019d spoken aloud.</p><p>Hoping to get a better feel for the situation, he called his executive assistant, Eleanor Johnson, and asked her to have Dean Wilcoff sent to his office. This potential lawsuit would bother him until he had some sense of what was likely to happen. The best way to find that out was through Julie\u2019s father.</p><p>Within minutes, his new head of security was shown into his office.</p><p>\u201cGood morning, Dean.\u201d The older man stood by his desk, shoulders squared in military fashion.</p><p>\u201cSit down.\u201d Roy motioned toward the chair recently vacated by his attorney. \u201cI asked to see you on a personal matter.\u201d</p><p>The other man didn\u2019t react at all. That was good. \u201cI assume you heard about your daughter\u2019s bicycle accident.\u201d</p><p>Dean nodded. \u201cShe told me about it herself. I want you to know how much I appreciate the way you took care of her.\u201d</p><p>Roy dismissed his thanks. \u201cShe received the new ten-speed?\u201d He\u2019d had it delivered on Monday.</p><p>\u201cShe did, and I\u2019m sure she\u2019ll want to thank you personally for your generosity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat isn\u2019t necessary.\u201d Roy paused, uncertain how to phrase the next question. \u201cUh, how is Julie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow is she?\u201d the other man repeated as if he didn\u2019t understand. \u201cOh, do you mean does she have any lingering aches and such from the fall?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Roy said without elaborating. He didn\u2019t want to tip Wilcoff off about his fear of a lawsuit. Sure as anything, Julie was talking to some fancy lawyer who\u2019d promise her millions. Roy\u2019s millions. The tension gathered in his shoulder blades, tightening his muscles.</p><p>\u201cJulie\u2019s tough,\u201d Dean answered, seeming to relax for the first time since entering the office. \u201cAs a kid, she had more scraped knees and bruises than any boy in the neighborhood. I will admit that when I saw her bike, I was a bit concerned, but she doesn\u2019t seem to have any ill effects from the accident.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad to hear it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike I said, Julie\u2019s tough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s been able to work all week, then?\u201d That was another important question. If she was badly hurt, as she might claim, her showing up at work would be evidence that those claims were only an effort to bilk him out of as much money as possible.</p><p>\u201cOh, sure. She went to school every day this week.\u201d</p><p>This was sounding better all the time, but it was no guarantee that she wasn\u2019t planning legal action at some later point. No, it was best to deal with this once and for all.</p><p>\u201cYour daughter\u2019s convinced I caused the collision.\u201d There, he\u2019d said it. He watched the other man closely, wondering how he\u2019d respond.</p><p>Wilcoff dropped his gaze. \u201cYes, she did mention that.\u201d</p><p>Aha! Roy knew it. This was exactly what Williams had warned him about. Not hearing from Julie didn\u2019t mean he wasn\u2019t being set up for a multimillion-dollar lawsuit.</p><p>\u201cI feel bad about the accident,\u201d he said, selecting his words with care. \u201cWhile Julie and I have a disagreement as to the cause, I\u2019d like to remind you she was riding on company grounds.\u201d</p><p>Wilcoff heard the censure in Roy\u2019s voice and reacted accordingly. \u201cI\u2019ll make sure she doesn\u2019t do that again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d appreciate it.\u201d He shuddered at the thought of another accident on his property.</p><p>\u201cConsider it done,\u201d Wilcoff said. He seemed eager to leave. \u201cWas that all, Mr. Fletcher?\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, no,\u201d Roy said slowly. This next part nearly stuck in his throat, but he had no option. \u201cI\u2019d like to offer Julie a small settlement to compensate for her pain and suffering.\u201d</p><p>Shocked, his head of security held up both hands. \u201cThat isn\u2019t necessary. In fact, I think Julie would be upset\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI insist. I\u2019ll have my attorney draw up the papers and we\u2019ll consider the matter closed.\u201d</p><p>Wilcoff shook his head. \u201cNone of this is necessary. Anyway, you should talk to Julie about it, not me. But I know she\u2019ll feel the same way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps,\u201d Roy said, although he didn\u2019t believe it. He was a prime candidate for a lawsuit. He\u2019d behaved stupidly in not getting his lawyer involved earlier. That oversight was a rarity for him; he hadn\u2019t come this far in the business world by ignoring the obvious.</p><p>\u201cWhatever you decide, Mr. Fletcher, is between you and my daughter, but I\u2019m certain Julie isn\u2019t interested in a settlement.\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s what they all say, Roy thought cynically. Julie Wilcoff was no different from any other woman he\u2019d ever met\u2014or any man in the same situation.</p><p>He was worried, but he didn\u2019t dare let it show.</p><p>Wilcoff left, and Roy started to read over the Griffin paperwork, but he still couldn\u2019t concentrate. The truth of it was, he\u2019d quite enjoyed his exchanges with Julie Wilcoff. True, she wasn\u2019t the most attractive woman he\u2019d encountered, but she possessed a quick wit and a quirky sense of humor. He couldn\u2019t recall the last time any woman had joked with him about her size or weight. He had to admit he found it refreshing. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>His phone rang and he answered it. \u201cI\u2019m sorry to bother you, Mr. Fletcher,\u201d Eleanor Johnson said, \u201cbut your mother is here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy mother?\u201d Oh, yes, now he remembered. He\u2019d even put it in his daily planner. She\u2019d asked about meeting him on Thursday and he\u2019d suggested lunchtime. In his current frame of mind, he had no interest in food, but he couldn\u2019t slight his mother. He sighed, then said with obvious reluctance, \u201cSend her in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMerry Christmas, Roy.\u201d Disregarding his mood, his mother came into the office and hugged him.</p><p>\u201cHow are you, Mother? And isn\u2019t it a little early for Christmas greetings?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot at all,\u201d she said, smiling at him with sparkling blue eyes. \u201cOnce December arrives, it\u2019s never too early to say Merry Christmas.\u201d Roy smiled in return. He sincerely loved his mother. She often frustrated him, but he did love and admire her\u2014although he didn\u2019t understand her. She\u2019d allowed his father to swindle her out of a huge amount. Roy had wanted her to fight, had urged her to drag his father back into court and make him pay. Roy wanted his father\u2019s reputation destroyed, which was what Burton Fletcher deserved, but his mother had refused to do it. His father seemed to have some regrets, if his efforts to contact Roy were any indication, but so far Roy had adamantly rejected any kind of relationship.</p><p>Instead of fighting, his mother had apparently forgiven Burton and become a hermit, living in a ridiculously small cottage on a tiny San Juan island. What really upset him was that she claimed to be \u201creasonably happy.\u201d She\u2019d been cheated, dumped and cast aside like yesterday\u2019s junk mail and she was happy? Roy just didn\u2019t get it.</p><p>\u201cAre you ready for lunch?\u201d</p><p>Roy couldn\u2019t think of a way to tell her he didn\u2019t feel like having lunch without disappointing her. He checked his watch.</p><p>\u201cIs your meeting over?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYup, I have half an hour.\u201d His problem was that he couldn\u2019t be around his mother and ignore the past. When he was with her, his heart ached for a life that was dead to him. He grieved for the innocents they\u2019d once been, he and his mother. She\u2019d taken one path since the divorce and he\u2019d taken another. Hatred for his father and for Aimee consumed him. He wanted them to suffer, wanted them to rot in hell for all the pain they\u2019d caused.</p><p>While his mother chose to forgive and forget, he chose to remember every detail, every incident, every minute of their treachery. In retrospect, he realized Aimee had been interested in his father all along. He\u2019d never been anything more than the means to an end.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take whatever time you have for me,\u201d his mother said in the complacent voice that always perturbed him. \u201cOh,\u201d she said, slipping her arm around his waist. \u201cI have a painting I want you to look at one day soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnother landscape?\u201d Without her knowledge, he\u2019d purchased several of her pieces, displayed under whatever name she used. Mary Something? He couldn\u2019t remember at the moment. She refused his financial help, but what she didn\u2019t know wouldn\u2019t hurt her.</p><p>\u201cNot this time,\u201d she said, then softly added, \u201cThis time I painted something entirely different.\u201d</p><p>Seven</p> <p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know how good it is to see you!\u201d Marta Rosenberg greeted Anne, throwing her arms wide. The hotel foyer was dominated by a fifteen-foot-tall Christmas tree decorated with huge shiny red balls and large gold bows. Plush leather chairs and mahogany tables created an intimate atmosphere despite the openness of the room.</p><p>Anne hugged her friend. It\u2019d been years since they\u2019d last visited. Nearly ten if she recalled correctly. Burton had taken a business trip to New York and Anne had accompanied him. They\u2019d gone to a show on Broadway, gotten together with old friends and strolled through Central Park holding hands. She and Marta had met for drinks one afternoon, gossiping and laughing like the college girls they\u2019d once been. That was long before Aimee, long before the divorce.</p><p>A familiar ache stabbed Anne close to her heart. She made an effort to ignore it; she wouldn\u2019t allow her loss to taint this reunion.</p><p>\u201cYou look marvelous,\u201d Marta said, stepping back to get a better view. \u201cWhat have you been up to?\u201d</p><p>Anne laughed off her old friend\u2019s praise. \u201cI spent most of the afternoon buying Christmas cards and wrap\u2014after I had lunch with Roy. I swear Scrooge has more Christmas spirit than my son.\u201d Her elegant white suit was left over from her old life. These days, she was most comfortable in jeans and an oil-smeared cotton shirt.</p><p>Marta was blond and tanned and she dressed strictly in black, no matter what the season. It was a New York thing, Anne figured. Her friend\u2019s hair haphazardly framed her face, but Anne knew there was nothing haphazard about it. She looked chic, rich, sophisticated, and her world seemed a million miles from the one that had become Anne\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cSpeaking of Roy,\u201d Marta said as she led the way into the dining room. \u201cI understand he\u2019s making quite a name for himself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m very proud of what he\u2019s accomplished, but I worry about him.\u201d She didn\u2019t elaborate and thankfully Marta didn\u2019t question her. Despite her determination to enjoy this evening, Anne\u2019s thoughts went back to the lunch with Roy. He seemed preoccupied, but when she\u2019d asked him about it, he\u2019d brushed aside her concern. He so rarely permitted her any glimpses into his life; he\u2019d closed himself off from her, the same way he\u2019d shut out everyone else.</p> <p>Marta announced her name to the ma\u00eetre d\u2019, and they were immediately seated. The man handed Anne a leather-encased menu, and with more ceremony than necessary, draped the white linen napkin on her lap.</p><p>A waiter came for their drink order, and both Anne and Marta requested a glass of white wine.</p><p>\u201cWhat brings you to Seattle?\u201d Anne asked her. \u201cBusiness, I assume.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat else? At one time I had a life, but now it\u2019s art. You wouldn\u2019t believe some of the pieces I\u2019ve found. And\u2014as I mentioned before\u2014I really would like to see your work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve only been painting for the last five years, Marta. My work is amateurish compared to the artists you represent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me decide that. You were the most talented girl in our class and I don\u2019t expect that\u2019s changed.\u201d</p><p>But it had. So much had changed in the forty years since Marta had first known her.</p><p>Their wine arrived, and they paused to sample it. Anne welcomed the break in conversation.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d Marta said as she set her wineglass aside. \u201cLet\u2019s get the subject of Burton out of the way. What happened?\u201d</p><p>Anne gazed sightlessly into the distance. \u201cWhat always happens?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnother woman.\u201d Marta scowled as she added, \u201cYounger, no doubt.\u201d</p><p>Anne nodded. \u201cThirty years younger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope he paid through the nose for this.\u201d</p><p>Anne didn\u2019t answer. How could she? \u201cActually, no.\u201d The details weren\u2019t anyone\u2019s business but her own. \u201cIt depresses me to discuss it, so let\u2019s not, all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe jerk,\u201d Marta muttered, and said something else under her breath, something Anne wouldn\u2019t ask her to repeat.</p><p>\u201cShall we toast to independence?\u201d Marta asked, tears filling her eyes.</p><p>\u201cMarta?\u201d Anne leaned forward and touched her friend\u2019s hand. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s always wrong?\u201d she murmured, echoing Anne\u2019s earlier statement.</p><p>\u201cJack?\u201d</p><p>Marta nodded, lowering her eyes. \u201cHe\u2019s got a girlfriend. Naturally, he still thinks I have no idea, but a blind woman could\u2019ve figured it out.\u201d</p><p>So this was the reason Marta had sought her out. \u201cWhat are you going to do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwenty-seven years with a man, and you assume you know him. Silly me.\u201d She made a gallant effort to smile through her tears. Raising the wineglass to her lips, she took a long and appreciative swallow.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re considering a divorce?\u201d</p><p>Marta shrugged. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine the rest of my life without Jack, but I can\u2019t tolerate the thought of him with another woman\u2014especially while he\u2019s married to me! I don\u2019t know what to do.\u201d</p><p>Anne noticed that her friend\u2019s hand trembled as she put down her wineglass. \u201cHalf the time I want to bash his head in for hurting me like this and the rest of the time I cry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sure he\u2019s having an affair?\u201d</p><p>Marta reached for her wine and took another large swallow. \u201cVery sure.\u201d Tears glistened in her eyes again. \u201cAll right, my wise friend, advise me.\u201d</p><p>Anne felt in no position to be giving her advice, although she supposed she could tell Marta what not to do. She\u2019d been cheated and misled, and all because she\u2019d been naive. The waiter appeared at their table, and Anne realized they hadn\u2019t even looked at their menus. They did so quickly, both deciding on the salmon entr\u00e9e.</p><p>Resuming the conversation, Anne called on her own experience. The first thing she suggested was that Marta talk to an attorney, and not one her husband recommended. From this point forward, everything Jack said was suspect, since he\u2019d lied to her already. Marta needed facts and information. Anne might have saved herself a lot of grief had she hired an attorney of her own choosing\u2014and done so earlier.</p><p>Their dinners arrived. They chatted, they ate, they laughed and cried, and then laughed again.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t tell you how wonderful it is to talk with someone openly and honestly,\u201d Marta said after their second glass of wine and two cups of strong coffee. \u201cI didn\u2019t know where else to turn. Lots of our friends have split up over the years, but...this just can\u2019t be happening. Not to Jack and me, and yet it is, and I don\u2019t know what to do about it.\u201d</p><p>Anne squeezed Marta\u2019s hand. \u201cI hoped Burton would come to his senses. I prayed and pleaded with God to give me my husband back. My entire identity was tied up with his.\u201d</p><p>Marta grew tearful again. \u201cI\u2019m beginning to wonder if God really answers our prayers.\u201d</p><p>Anne believed He did. \u201cWhile it\u2019s true God didn\u2019t give me the answer I wanted, He did answer me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have my own identity now, and it isn\u2019t that of Burton\u2019s ex-wife. I\u2019m Anne Fletcher\u2014and I\u2019m also Mary Fleming, artist.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy did you decide to use a pseudonym?\u201d</p><p>It was a well-kept secret. Only a few people knew. Her fear was that friends, out of pity and concern, would purchase her landscapes in a desire to support her. Anne didn\u2019t want their sympathy. Come hell or high water, she was determined to make it on her own.</p><p>\u201cMary Fleming is business-savvy, smart and talented. Anne Fletcher is meek, mild and a victim, in the eyes of the world.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love it,\u201d Marta said, reaching for the tab and signing it to her room. \u201cSpeaking of Mary,\u201d she said, \u201cI\u2019m really looking forward to seeing her work.\u201d</p><p>Anne hesitated. \u201cYou\u2019re sure about this?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIs that Anne or Mary speaking?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnne,\u201d she confessed with a laugh.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I thought.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, come to my car with me. I brought a sketch.\u201d</p> <p>They left the hotel, and Anne handed the valet her claim check. He brought her car around, and at Anne\u2019s instruction, parked it by the outside curb to avoid delaying anyone who was pulling into the portico. The Cadillac was one of the few things she\u2019d gotten as part of the divorce settlement. Roy said that was because Burton had wanted it to look as if he\u2019d been fair.</p><p>\u201cAs I explained, this isn\u2019t one of my landscapes,\u201d Anne said, opening the door. Because of the size of the painting, she\u2019d brought along her sketchbook. It lay on the passenger seat, and Anne picked it up and opened it to the sketch of the angel.</p><p>For a long moment Marta didn\u2019t say anything. \u201cThis is the sketch you painted from?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, in a huge rush.\u201d She told her the size of the canvas. While on the ferry, she\u2019d shaded in the sketch, using pencils. \u201cLike I said this morning, I just finished the painting. I\u2019m sure the oil is still wet.\u201d Then, because she regretted showing her art to such a renowned professional, Anne quickly added, \u201cListen, it\u2019s all right if you don\u2019t like it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike it?\u201d Marta said, meeting her gaze. \u201cI love it. This is incredible. I realize it\u2019s only a sketch, but if the painting\u2019s anything like this, you have a real winner on your hands. Maybe it\u2019s my state of mind, I don\u2019t know,\u201d she said, staring down at the pad, \u201cbut I feel like...like I\u2019ve been touched by God just looking at it.\u201d</p> <p>Anne could hardly believe Marta had said that....</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m stopping by your place first thing tomorrow, and if this painting is half as good as I think it\u2019ll be, I\u2019m taking it back to New York. Agreed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...of course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can get eight or nine for this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHundred?\u201d</p><p>Marta grinned. \u201cThousand.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cEight or nine thousand?\u201d Anne knew she had to be dreaming.</p><p>\u201cMaybe more. Now, I have to tell you that as the dealer, I take a percentage, but you could still end up with four or five thousand dollars.\u201d</p><p>Anne wanted to throw her arms in the air and scream for joy. Instead, she clasped both hands over her mouth and silently said a prayer of gratitude.</p><p>Eight</p><p>Now that her father was working, Julie always stopped at the mailbox on her way home. For obvious reasons, she no longer accompanied him or rode her bicycle\u2014her brand-new bicycle\u2014to and from school. As she strolled toward the house on Monday, she shuffled through the day\u2019s collection of bills, notices, Christmas cards and the usual junk mail\u2014and paused at the thick manila envelope addressed to her. Julie hesitated in midstep. The return address was that of a well-known Seattle law firm.</p><p>Tearing it open, Julie juggled the house keys, the rest of the mail and her backpack as she extracted a letter and a thick wad of paper. Using her shoulder to open the door, she nearly fell into the house when she realized what she was reading.</p><p>A settlement offer.</p><p>From Roy Fletcher.</p> <p>Julie scanned the details and by the time she\u2019d finished she could hardly breathe. Mr. High-and-Mighty wanted to buy her off. He was willing to spend twenty-five thousand dollars to shut her up. Julie couldn\u2019t believe it, couldn\u2019t comprehend why anyone would go to such outlandish lengths to get rid of her, especially when she\u2019d assured him she had no intention of suing.</p><p>She didn\u2019t want his money. She didn\u2019t want anything from him. His offer was the biggest insult of her life.</p><p>Pacing now, she stomped from one end of the living room to the other. She knew it wasn\u2019t a good idea to try to reason with Fletcher, especially when she felt like this, but she couldn\u2019t stand still and she couldn\u2019t stay home. She had to do something before she exploded with indignation. This pent-up energy had to go somewhere.</p><p>Her thoughts continued to churn as she tossed her car keys in the air and deftly caught them. Good idea or not, her mind was made up. She was going to tell Mr. Big Bucks exactly what he could do with his \u201csettlement offer.\u201d</p><p>Julie was so angry she barely noticed the ten-mile drive in heavy traffic. Naturally there wasn\u2019t a single parking space available anywhere at Fletcher Industries. With no other option, she pulled into a handicapped spot.</p><p>Arms swinging at her sides, every step filled with determination, Julie headed for the company\u2019s headquarters. In the back of her mind a small voice whispered that this was probably a mistake. She didn\u2019t care. She was beyond caring.</p><p>She stormed into the building, past the security guard, a young man with impressive biceps. Jason, she recalled. She\u2019d met him last week. \u201cMiss,\u201d he said, stopping her. \u201cYou have to check in here first.\u201d</p><p>Julie waved her hand at him as he moved out from behind his desk. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to mess with me just now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMa\u2019am, I\u2019m sorry, but I can\u2019t let you onto the elevator until you\u2019ve been cleared by security.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, man, that\u2019s Mr. Wilcoff\u2019s daughter,\u201d a second guard said, coming around the corner. \u201cHow you doin\u2019?\u201d he asked, as if they were the best of friends.</p><p>Julie vaguely remembered him from the day of her accident. Roy Fletcher had spoken to him briefly when he\u2019d dropped off her bike at the office complex.</p><p>Julie smiled at the first guard. \u201cYou remember me, don\u2019t you, Jason?\u201d she said. \u201cI came here with my dad about a week ago. How\u2019s it going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, I guess,\u201d he said, eyeing her skeptically.</p><p>For once Julie was grateful for the family resemblance.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I remember you now,\u201d he said after a moment. \u201cDo you have an appointment with your father?\u201d</p><p>Julie smiled\u2014and lied through her teeth. She had an appointment, all right, an appointment with justice. \u201cI do. I apologize if I was rude earlier.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo problem.\u201d Eager to please his boss, the guard returned to his desk and reached for his phone. \u201cI\u2019ll let him know you\u2019re coming.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d Julie said, and swallowed a plea not to call him, after all. She stopped briefly at the company directory to find the location of Fletcher\u2019s office. Just as she\u2019d suspected\u2014top floor. Rushing, she pressed the elevator button and glanced at her watch, trying to gauge how much time she had before she was found out. Once her father knew she was in the building, he\u2019d wonder where she was\u2014and what she was doing.</p><p>At the top floor she stepped out of the elevator and faced a large desk. An efficient-looking middle-aged woman glanced up, her expression surprised.</p><p>\u201cMay I help you?\u201d she asked politely.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here to see Mr. Fletcher.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you have an appointment?\u201d</p><p>This paragon who guarded the lion\u2019s den knew exactly when Fletcher\u2019s appointments were scheduled, and Julie wasn\u2019t on any list.</p><p>\u201cOh, yes,\u201d she muttered, and without wasting another second, Julie bolted for the huge floor-to-ceiling double doors. Without bothering to knock, she turned the knob and barreled inside.</p><p>Fletcher was on the phone. Startled, he looked up. His gaze met hers and he didn\u2019t so much as blink. She gave him credit for that. Tall as she was, angry as she was, Julie knew she made an intimidating sight.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll need to call you back,\u201d Fletcher said smoothly. \u201cMy office has been invaded and I have a feeling this is going to take longer than you\u2019ll want to wait.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMr. Fletcher, I\u2019m sorry, she just...came in.\u201d Ms. Johnson entered the office seconds after Julie. The older woman was clearly flustered; presumably nothing like this had ever happened before. \u201cI\u2019ve contacted security\u2014they\u2019re on their way up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood plan.\u201d Fletcher rose from his seat, leaning forward on his desk, his eyes never leaving Julie.</p><p>\u201cShould I stay with you?\u201d his assistant asked nervously.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be fine, Ms. Johnson.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t count on that,\u201d Julie muttered.</p><p>Fletcher waved his assistant out of the room and returned his attention to Julie. \u201cYou had something you wanted to say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour settlement offer arrived!\u201d she said. \u201cWhy would you do such a thing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d He cocked one brow as if to suggest it should be obvious.</p><p>\u201cI told you I wasn\u2019t going to sue!\u201d</p><p>He snickered.</p><p>\u201cAre you so cynical that you don\u2019t trust anyone? So cynical you think you can buy your way out of everything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMoney is the universal language.\u201d</p><p>Julie folded her arms. \u201cListen to me, Fletcher, and listen hard. I don\u2019t want your money.\u201d She spoke slowly and emphatically so that even a man as emotionally obtuse as this one would get the point.</p><p>He angled his head sideways and stared at the ceiling. \u201cWhere have I heard that before?\u201d Then, as though he was bored and ready to end the conversation, he said, \u201cYou want the money. Everyone wants the money. Just sign the agreement and cash the check. You can be outraged all over again\u2014and twenty-five thousand dollars richer.\u201d</p><p>Julie\u2019s mouth sagged open. \u201cYou don\u2019t get it, do you? I\u2019m not cashing the check. I\u2019m not signing the settlement.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course you\u2019re not signing the settlement,\u201d he snapped, his eyes so cold that for an instant she actually shivered.</p><p>She caught her breath and stepped back. \u201cIt isn\u2019t just me you distrust,\u201d she whispered. He wasn\u2019t capable of trusting a single, solitary person. Some elemental betrayal had waylaid him in the past, and he\u2019d never recovered, never moved beyond it. She didn\u2019t know what had happened; in fact, she didn\u2019t want to know. But right now they were at an impasse unless she could think of some way to settle this, some way that suited them both.</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d Julie said. \u201cTell you what I\u2019ll do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, the bargaining begins. Are you sure you don\u2019t want your attorney here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have an attorney. Now listen, because I\u2019m only going to say this once.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe schoolteacher speaks.\u201d He\u2019d folded his arms and she relaxed hers.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll sign your stupid agreement.\u201d</p><p>He flashed her a knowing, sarcastic grin. \u201cI thought you\u2019d come to your senses sooner or later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith one stipulation.\u201d</p><p>His smile vanished.</p><p>\u201cI want a signed statement from you in which you concede that you caused the accident and\u2014\u201d she wagged her finger at his Cross pen \u201c\u2014I\u2019d like a written apology.\u201d</p><p>His eyes narrowed and, if possible, grew even colder. Hands pressed on the top of his desk, he leaned forward again. \u201cI didn\u2019t cause the accident and there\u2019s no way I\u2019ll apologize for something I didn\u2019t do.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d figured that would make him mad. Good. Maybe he\u2019d understand how she felt. \u201cExplain the damage to my bike, then,\u201d she said, forcing her voice to remain calm. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>His lips thinned. \u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does it matter?

He spread his arms between the two of them, trying to assess the situation.</p> <p>He looked at his boss first. \u201cMr. Fletcher, I apologize that my daughter burst into your office.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDad, you\u2019d better hear me out before you apologize to that man.\u201d She gestured wildly at Fletcher. \u201cHe tried to buy me off with a settlement offer!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, honey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know?\u201d</p><p>Her father nodded. \u201cMr. Fletcher told me it was in the works, but it\u2019s none of my affair, so I didn\u2019t say anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou involved my father in this?\u201d Julie hissed at Fletcher.</p> <p>\u201cSweetheart,\u201d her father said in the gentlest of tones, \u201cperhaps it would be best if you left now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet.\u201d Julie was going to stand her ground. As far as she was concerned, this conversation was a long way from over.</p><p>Her father glanced apologetically at his employer. \u201cI\u2019m afraid Julie\u2019s got a temper, sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDad!\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe takes after her mother in that.\u201d</p><p>Julie was horrified to hear her father saying such a thing to a man who\u2019d insulted her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Jules,\u201d her father continued, \u201cbut you don\u2019t leave me any other choice.\u201d That said, he attempted to hoist her fireman-style over his shoulder and forcibly remove her from the office. Julie didn\u2019t try to fight him, but she was too heavy for him to carry. He did manage to lift her several inches off the ground.</p><p>\u201cDad! Put me down!\u201d</p> <p>Either she weighed more than he\u2019d assumed or he was willing to listen, because he set her down on the carpet.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cJulie, get out of this office,\u201d he said in a low, irate voice. \u201cNow.\u201d</p><p>She could only imagine how amused Fletcher must be. \u201cNot until this is settled,\u201d she said, glaring at her father\u2019s employer.</p><p>Suddenly her father walked behind her and wrapped his arms around her waist. The shock of it caught her unawares and she toppled back against him. Satisfied, he started to drag her out of the room, the heels of her shoes making tracks in the plush carpeting.</p><p>\u201cLet me go!\u201d she cried. When she looked up, she saw Roy Fletcher grinning widely. \u201cDon\u2019t you dare laugh,\u201d she warned, stretching out her arm and pointing at him.</p><p>\u201cBye-bye, Ms. Wilcoff.\u201d He waved and had the audacity to laugh outright.</p><p>\u201cWe aren\u2019t finished!\u201d she shouted. \u201cDaddy, for the love of heaven, let go of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot until we\u2019re in the elevator,\u201d her father said. He dragged her through the large double doors.</p><p>Fletcher walked around his desk. Julie wanted it understood that he hadn\u2019t heard the last of her. \u201cFurthermore, you owe me an apology!\u201d</p><p>Fletcher\u2019s assistant stood at her own desk, eyes twinkling. \u201cNice to have met you, Ms. Wilcoff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou, too,\u201d Julie said, smiling weakly.</p><p>The elevator arrived. \u201cThis is your last chance, Fletcher!\u201d she yelled.</p><p>\u201cNo, Julie,\u201d her father said as he entered the elevator car. The doors slid closed. \u201cThis is your last chance. I don\u2019t want you ever pulling anything like this again. Is that clear?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. It was ridiculous to be chastised by her father at the age of thirty, but at the moment she felt more like twelve.</p><p>It seemed to take two lifetimes for the elevator to descend to the lobby. The silence was so tense it almost crackled\u2014like static electricity. One glance at her father, who was the calmest man she\u2019d ever known, told her he was furious.</p><p>\u201cYou will apologize,\u201d he said just before the doors slid open.</p><p>She\u2019d need to think about that.</p><p>\u201cYour car\u2019s going to be towed,\u201d he announced without inflection. \u201cYou took a handicapped parking space and you know better.\u201d</p><p>She resisted stamping her foot. Yes, she did know better.</p><p>\u201cYou can either wait for me to get off work to drive you home or you can take the bus. There\u2019s one every half hour.\u201d</p><p>Staying on Fletcher Industries property one second longer was intolerable. \u201cI\u2019d rather walk,\u201d she muttered. It would help her work off some of her anger.</p><p>\u201cI thought you might decide that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s an unreasonable man, Dad.\u201d</p><p>Her father didn\u2019t answer. \u201cJason,\u201d he said to the guard who\u2019d first questioned her. \u201cUntil you hear otherwise, my daughter is banned from the building.\u201d</p><p>Jason nodded grimly, as if to suggest she\u2019d better not enter this lobby again, not on his watch. \u201cYes, sir!\u201d</p><p>Great. If her father had anything to say about it, the next time she set foot on Fletcher property she\u2019d likely be shot on sight.</p><p>Nine</p><p>Roy sat back down at his desk and for the first time in months\u2014years\u2014he burst out laughing. He laughed without restraint. Then he returned to work, stared at his computer screen and started to laugh all over again.</p><p>The phone rang and Ms. Johnson interrupted his laugh-fest. \u201cYour mother\u2019s on line one.\u201d</p><p>His mother? Not until Roy picked up the receiver did he recall that he\u2019d just seen her the week before. He generally heard from her once a month; any more often was unusual. She\u2019d said something about wanting him to see one of her paintings, but he\u2019d told her he\u2019d do that on Christmas Day.</p><p>\u201cHello, Mom.\u201d</p><p>The line was silent.</p><p>\u201cMom?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRoy, is that you? You don\u2019t sound like yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s me,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you...\u201d She paused, apparently searching for the right word. \u201cYou\u2019re not laughing, are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLaughing?\u201d he repeated, trying to sober his voice. \u201cI was earlier.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA joke?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cActually, it was a woman. Her father\u2019s employed here and she stormed into my office filled with righteous indignation about some nonsense or other. I have to tell you, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever seen anything funnier.\u201d Humor overtook him again and he burst into waves of laughter as he described Julie\u2019s outrage. Soon his mother was laughing, too. She seemed to find the scene as hilarious as he did.</p><p>\u201cWhat can I do for you?\u201d Roy asked as he wiped his eyes.</p><p>\u201cI wanted to make arrangements to come and paint,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI thought you wanted me to come to your house\u2014to look at one of your paintings.\u201d</p><p>She had him completely confused now. Did his mother believe he was going to let her do custodial work? \u201cWhat do you want to paint?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe lobby windows,\u201d she said as if it should be perfectly obvious. \u201cRemember? We talked about this a couple of weeks ago. I\u2019m going to paint a holiday scene on the lobby windows.\u201d</p><p>In Roy\u2019s opinion, Christmas wasn\u2019t all that different from any other day of the year. He\u2019d do his duty and spend it with his mother; they\u2019d exchange gifts against a background of decorations that brought back painful memories for him\u2014painful because they were good. The truth was, he no longer cared much for Christmas. The holidays didn\u2019t even resemble what he\u2019d once known, those warm, happy times, joking with his parents, feeling their love for him and for each other. That had been a fa\u00e7ade, he now realized. His father had become cynical and jaded as the years passed. Roy hadn\u2019t seen that until it was too late. Far too late.</p><p>\u201cOh, yes. Now that you\u2019ve reminded me, I do remember. You can paint whatever you want, Mother,\u201d he told her. \u201cI\u2019ve already let the security people know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have a wonderful idea.\u201d</p><p>She started to detail her plans\u2014something about angels\u2014but he cut her off. \u201cMother, this isn\u2019t the Sistine Chapel. Don\u2019t worry about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, but...well, I was thinking I\u2019d paint a religious scene with angels similar to the one in this painting I was telling you about. You wouldn\u2019t mind that, would you?\u201d</p><p>There was no point in arguing with her even if he did object. \u201cAll right, paint your angels. I\u2019ll have the windows cleaned.\u201d</p><p>Her appreciative sigh came over the telephone line. \u201cThank you, Roy. I\u2019ll be there Wednesday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to bother you,\u201d she assured him. \u201cYou won\u2019t even know I\u2019m there.\u201d</p><p>This seemed to be his day for dealing with irrational women. He could hear the determination in his mother\u2019s voice. For whatever reason, she felt it was important to paint a Christmas scene, and not just any scene, either. But if painting angels on his windows made her happy, then he guessed there was no harm in it.</p><p>\u201cFine, Mother, come and do as you wish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI promise you\u2019re going to love my Christmas angels.\u201d</p><p>Roy rolled his eyes. \u201cI\u2019m sure I will, Mother.\u201d</p><p>She seemed to be in a chatty mood and went on about dinner with her college friend. \u201cI\u2019m not keeping you from anything, am I?\u201d she asked after talking nonstop for several minutes. \u201cI know how busy you are.\u201d</p><p>For the first time in a very long while, Roy found he actually liked speaking to his mother\u2014as much as he was capable of liking anything other than business. \u201cIt\u2019s fine, Mom.\u201d</p><p>For some reason, she seemed to get choked up over that and quickly ended the conversation. He replaced the receiver and stared down at his phone, hardly knowing what to make of his mother. Women. He\u2019d never understand them.</p><p>Roy worked for another half hour and then realized he wasn\u2019t in the mood. He wasn\u2019t sure what he wanted to do, but he was leaving the office. Any file he needed could be accessed from the computer at his condo\u2014a sprawling five-thousand-square-foot penthouse suite overlooking Lake Washington.</p><p>As Roy left the elevator and walked into the lobby, he saw a truck towing a vehicle away from the handicapped parking slot.</p><p>Jason, the security guard, wore a satisfied grin. \u201cMs. Wilcoff\u2019s car,\u201d he said, answering Roy\u2019s unspoken question. \u201cIn her rush to get in to see you, she parked illegally. Her father wasn\u2019t willing to make allowances.\u201d</p><p>He was enjoying this more all the time. \u201cWhere is she?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHer father said she could either take the bus or wait until he was available to give her a ride. She decided to walk.\u201d</p><p>That was exactly what Roy would have expected. \u201cAny idea how much of a hike that is?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Jason nodded. Grinning, he glanced down at the polished marble floor. \u201cI think it\u2019s about ten miles.\u201d</p><p>A smile tempted Roy. \u201cI see.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou can rest assured she won\u2019t make it past me a second time, Mr. Fletcher. Her father\u2019s banned her from the building, too, so you don\u2019t have anything to worry about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI appreciate that,\u201d Roy said, pushing through the glass doors, but as he walked out of the building, he realized that wasn\u2019t true. Despite everything, he\u2019d enjoyed his encounter with Julie, reveled in it. He felt alive in ways he\u2019d forgotten.</p><p>Roy turned back. \u201cDo you know which direction she was headed?\u201d he asked the guard.</p><p>Jason looked surprised. \u201cNorth, I\u2019d guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d Roy was going south himself, but a small detour wouldn\u2019t be amiss. He didn\u2019t think she\u2019d accept a ride, but he\u2019d ask. Perhaps a brisk walk would help her vent her anger and make her a little more amenable to reaching some kind of agreement.</p> <p>Roy drove a black Lincoln Continental with tinted glass. He could see out but no one could see in, which was precisely the way he wanted it. He exited onto the main street heading north and stayed in the right-hand lane. He drove a couple of miles, mildly impressed by how far she\u2019d gotten. She\u2019d made good time. Perhaps she\u2019d grown tired and taken a bus. Or perhaps she\u2019d hailed a taxi.</p><p>Then he saw her, walking at a quick pace, arms swinging at her sides. Roy reduced his speed to a crawl as he approached her. Traffic wove around him, some cars honking with irritation, but he ignored them and pulled up alongside Julie. With the touch of a button, the passenger-side window glided down.</p><p>She glanced in his direction and her eyes widened when she recognized him.</p><p>\u201cGet in,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cWhy should I?\u201d</p><p>Time to play nice, he figured. \u201cPlease.\u201d</p> <p>She hesitated, then walked to the curb and leaned down to talk to him. \u201cGive me one reason I should do anything you say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll drive you home.\u201d</p><p>That didn\u2019t appear to influence her. \u201cI\u2019m halfway there already.\u201d</p><p>Horns blared behind him. \u201cIf you don\u2019t hurry up and decide, I\u2019ll get a traffic ticket.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. It\u2019s what you deserve.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJulie, come on, be reasonable. I said please.\u201d</p><p>She looked away and then capitulated. \u201cOh, all right.\u201d</p><p>She certainly wasn\u2019t gracious about it, but he felt thankful that she opened the passenger door without further ado and slid into the car. As he hit the gas, she fastened her seat belt.</p> <p>\u201cGive me your address,\u201d he said.</p><p>Obediently she rattled off the street and house number.</p><p>Now that she was in the car, Roy couldn\u2019t think of the right conversational gambit. He had no intention of meeting her demands and she apparently wasn\u2019t interested in complying with his. Silly woman. With the stroke of a pen, she could be twenty-five thousand dollars richer, but she was too stubborn to do it. Perhaps she was looking for more.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have anything to say?\u201d she asked him after a moment.</p><p>\u201cNope. What about you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a thing,\u201d she returned testily.</p><p>He eased off the main thoroughfare and onto a quiet side street. It was a middle-class neighborhood of older homes, mostly small ramblers with a few brick houses interspersed among them, just enough to keep the neighborhood from being termed a development.</p><p>\u201cAre you ready to listen to reason yet?\u201d he asked as if he possessed limitless patience and was more than willing to wait her out.</p><p>\u201cAre you ready to accept responsibility and write me an apology?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot on your life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not signing that settlement offer, either,\u201d she said, tossing him a saccharine smile. She exhaled sharply. \u201cYou can rest easy about one thing, however.\u201d</p><p>He looked away from the road to glance at her.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t afford an attorney.\u201d</p><p>Far be it from Roy to point out that in liability cases lawyers were more than happy to accept a chunk of the settlement. Generally it was a big chunk. \u201cSorry to hear that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019ll bet you are.\u201d She closed her eyes and leaned back.</p><p>Roy didn\u2019t completely understand why, but he found himself not wanting to drop her off at her house; he wanted to continue driving so they could talk. \u201cWe should discuss it further. Perhaps we could reach a compromise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike what? I take twelve thousand five hundred dollars and you just apologize and don\u2019t accept responsibility?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething like that. Why don\u2019t we have coffee and talk it over?\u201d</p><p>Julie\u2019s head snapped up. \u201cYou\u2019re joking, right? Did I hear you invite me to coffee?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA gesture of peace and goodwill,\u201d he said in a conciliatory tone. \u201cI hear this is the season for it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, puh-leeze.\u201d She crossed her arms. \u201cThanks but no thanks.\u201d</p><p>Roy shrugged off her rejection, although he had to admit he was disappointed. \u201cI was only trying to be helpful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWere you?\u201d Her eyes narrowed with suspicion.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s no big deal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sincere?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he said simply. He felt her scrutiny as he drove.</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d she agreed, \u201cbut I\u2019d like to suggest we have coffee at my house.\u201d</p><p>Roy pulled to a stop in front of the address she\u2019d given him. It was a small, well-kept house, probably two bedrooms. Green shutters bordered the windows and a rocking chair sat on the front porch. Christmas lights were strung along the roofline.</p><p>\u201cYou have coffee on?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cNo, but I\u2019ll make a pot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not a restaurant? Neutral territory.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause,\u201d she said, and sighed heavily. \u201cI\u2019d feel more comfortable on home turf.\u201d</p><p>He considered that. \u201cShould I worry about being poisoned?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm.\u201d A smile teased the edges of her mouth. \u201cThat\u2019s an interesting possibility.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps we can use this as a lesson in compromise,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cCompromise? How do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I come onto your turf, we\u2019ll order dinner and I\u2019ll buy\u2014\u201d</p><p>Julie didn\u2019t allow him to finish. \u201cDinner? I thought we were having coffee.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m hungry,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we\u2019ll eat in the security and comfort of your home.\u201d</p><p>For a moment he was sure she was going to reject the idea; then she turned to him with a tentative smile. \u201cAll right. We\u2019ll order pizza and I like anchovies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPizza it is. I like anchovies, too.\u201d He\u2019d never met a woman who did; once again she\u2019d surprised him.</p><p>From the expression on her face, he wasn\u2019t convinced she believed him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just a regular guy, Julie.\u201d</p><p>Muttering, \u201cThat\u2019s what Benedict Arnold used to say,\u201d she climbed out of the car and closed the door.</p><p>Roy joined her on the concrete walkway that led to the front steps. \u201cI\u2019m really not so bad, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat remains to be seen, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>He chuckled. \u201cI guess it does. Friends?\u201d He held out his hand.</p><p>She looked at his extended hand, sighed and gave him her own. \u201cDon\u2019t think this means I\u2019m going to change my mind about the settlement check.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll see about that,\u201d he said as she inserted the key into the lock.</p><p>\u201cYes, we will,\u201d she responded with equal determination.</p><p>Roy grinned. This might not be so bad. A girl who liked anchovies on her pizza was obviously reasonable some of the time.</p><p>Ten</p><p>Exhausted, Mercy flung herself onto a passing cloud. \u201cThis romance business is hard work,\u201d she complained.</p><p>\u201cBut Julie\u2019s having dinner with him.\u201d For her part, Goodness felt encouraged. She had to give Dean Wilcoff\u2019s daughter credit; Julie had spunk, which was something Goodness admired.</p><p>The young woman hadn\u2019t been willing to accept Roy\u2019s settlement because money wasn\u2019t important to her. That was a rare human trait. The issue of earthly wealth confused Goodness. Money couldn\u2019t buy the things that were truly important. Roy owned a fabulous condo on prime waterfront real estate. The three of them had gone to it and investigated, needing to learn what they could about him. Goodness had hardly ever visited a more beautifully decorated place, but it wasn\u2019t a home. By the same token, Roy was surrounded by all kinds of people, employees and yes-men, but he had few friends. Those he\u2019d once considered friends had drifted away out of neglect. While Roy was looked upon as rich, he was one of the poorest humans Goodness had ever seen.</p><p>\u201cHe likes Julie,\u201d Shirley said with a rather smug smile.</p><p>\u201cShe amuses him.\u201d Goodness wasn\u2019t fooled. Roy had no real feelings for Julie. She wasn\u2019t typical of the women he\u2019d known and he wasn\u2019t quite sure what to make of her. The laughter had been good for him. It had felt good, too, and that feeling had left him with the urge to laugh more. She suspected it was the reason he\u2019d pursued Julie during her long walk home. Their shared pizza dinner had come about unexpectedly, and yet he was enjoying himself. They both were.</p><p>\u201cHer stubbornness intrigues him,\u201d Goodness added. \u201cHe can\u2019t understand why she isn\u2019t interested in the settlement.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJulie has principles,\u201d Shirley announced, \u201cand Roy hasn\u2019t seen that in a woman in quite a while. Since before Aimee.\u201d</p><p>Mercy agreed. \u201cWhat should happen next?\u201d</p><p>The other angels looked at Goodness as if she was the one with the answers. \u201cHow should I know?\u201d She shrugged, as much at a loss as her friends. This relationship was a flyby-the-seat-of-your-pants affair. \u201cI\u2019m making this up as we go along.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but you\u2019ve done such good work so far.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe?\u201d Goodness cried. \u201cThis is a team effort.\u201d She peered down through the cloud cover and stared into the house below. \u201cThey\u2019re eating their pizza now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd talking,\u201d Mercy noted with delight.</p><p>\u201cNo one seems to be yelling, either,\u201d Shirley said. \u201cThat\u2019s a good sign, don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p><p>Goodness nodded. \u201cHe should ask her out next,\u201d she told the others, suddenly inspired. That seemed to be the most logical step. Not that she was convinced this relationship had much of a future.</p><p>\u201cOut?\u201d Mercy repeated. \u201cYou mean like on a date?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, a date. He implied that he was interested in getting her on neutral turf, remember?\u201d That was the way humans generally did those things, Goodness reasoned, because then no one had an unfair advantage. She gave a rueful grin. Humans tended to be so competitive....</p><p>\u201cRoy doesn\u2019t date,\u201d Mercy pointed out. \u201cNot in years. He\u2019s forgotten how. Besides, he\u2019s got this thing about women.\u201d From the exasperated look she wore, one might think Goodness had suggested Roy propose marriage as his next move. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThen he has to believe it isn\u2019t a date.\u201d Goodness\u2019s head was spinning. Surely there was some social event he was obliged to attend. December was the month for that sort of function.</p><p>\u201cThink,\u201d Mercy demanded.</p><p>Suddenly the air brightened and with a sound like thunder the Archangel Gabriel joined them. He held a massive volume in his hands. The Book of Lives. \u201cHow\u2019s it going, ladies?\u201d he inquired.</p><p>The three of them rushed to give him brief updates. \u201cGreat,\u201d Goodness said cheerfully.</p> <p>\u201cYes\u2014very good,\u201d Mercy seconded.</p><p>\u201cWe think Julie Wilcoff is the answer to Anne\u2019s prayer,\u201d Shirley told him. \u201cThey\u2019re together now.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel seemed impressed. \u201cAnd you three arranged that?\u201d</p><p>Goodness swallowed hard. If she admitted their role in the bike accident, it could mean trouble. Much better if Gabriel didn\u2019t know about their little scheme. \u201cNot entirely,\u201d she said\u2014which was the truth. Still, it sounded becomingly modest.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s Anne?\u201d Gabriel surprised her by asking.</p> <p>Shirley, Goodness and Mercy froze. If he found out that Shirley had appeared to Anne, they could forget ever coming to Earth again. \u201cFine,\u201d Goodness said, and to her horror her voice squeaked. \u201cShe\u2019s painting Roy\u2019s office windows on Wednesday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAn angel scene, if I remember correctly,\u201d Gabriel said, studying them carefully.</p><p>\u201cWhat a nice idea.\u201d Mercy looked frantically to her friends for help.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t imagine where she came up with that idea.\u201d Gabriel\u2019s eyes seemed to bore straight through them.</p><p>The three of them huddled close together. \u201cIt\u2019s that time of year, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Goodness asked. \u201cI mean, humans seem to associate Christmas with angels.\u201d</p><p>Mercy spread her wings and stepped forward. \u201cGlory to God in the Highest,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cGlory to God,\u201d Shirley echoed.</p><p>\u201cExactly,\u201d Goodness said. \u201cWe were there to announce the good news to the shepherds that night. Well, not us, exactly, but angels like us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know all about that night, Goodness.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course you do,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cNow, back to the matter of Anne\u2019s prayer request.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Your Archangelness,\u201d Mercy said.</p><p>Her friend didn\u2019t play the role of innocent well, Goodness thought. She resisted the urge to elbow Mercy, since she couldn\u2019t do it without being obvious.</p><p>\u201cWhat are your plans?\u201d Gabriel asked, scrutinizing them.</p> <p>\u201cFunny you should ask,\u201d Goodness said. \u201cWe were just discussing that. I don\u2019t think Roy\u2019s going to come right out and ask Julie for a date. He wouldn\u2019t be comfortable with such a direct approach.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe enjoys watching the parade of boats,\u201d Gabriel said, flipping through the pages of the book. He looked up again. \u201cWere you aware of that?\u201d</p><p>It was all Goodness could do not to sidle over and take a peek.</p><p>Gabriel\u2019s attention returned to the page. \u201cThe last couple of Decembers, he\u2019s stood on his balcony alone and watched the decorated watercraft float by.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd he\u2019s wished there was someone with him to share the experience,\u201d Shirley said. Goodness figured she was just guessing, but she\u2019d probably guessed right.</p><p>Gabriel confirmed it. \u201cThat wish has been fleeting, but it is one he\u2019s entertained.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJulie\u2019s so athletic, I\u2019ll bet she\u2019s a great sailor. She loves the water,\u201d Mercy ventured.</p><p>\u201cSo does Roy,\u201d Gabriel said. \u201cOr he did at one time. Unfortunately, he hasn\u2019t sailed in years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAimee used to sail with him, didn\u2019t she?\u201d Goodness asked, although she was fairly sure she knew the answer.</p><p>\u201cRoy sold his sailboat after they split up. He hasn\u2019t been out on Puget Sound since.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow sad for him.\u201d Shirley sighed as she said it.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps we could\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cCarry on,\u201d Gabriel said. He seemed to be in a hurry now. \u201cYou\u2019re doing a fine job so far.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe are?\u201d Goodness couldn\u2019t keep herself from saying. \u201cI mean, yes, I know. We\u2019re working very hard on this request.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d Then as quickly as he\u2019d come, the Archangel vanished.</p><p>Goodness relaxed. Gabriel had yet to recall them from an assignment, but there was always a chance he would, especially with Shirley disobeying the angels\u2019 number one rule: no revelations to humans.</p><p>Perhaps they were safe, for now anyway. She certainly hoped so.</p><p>Roy slept better on Monday night than he had in months. He always fell asleep easily enough but then he\u2019d wake up two or three hours later. Often he roamed around his condo for much of the night, unable to get back to sleep. During the past few years, he\u2019d tried any number of remedies, all of them useless.</p><p>As the alarm sounded, he rolled over and stared at the clock, astonished that he\u2019d slept the entire night uninterrupted. That never happened, at least not anymore.</p><p>Roy felt rested and refreshed as he got into the shower. He stopped short when he realized he was humming a Christmas carol. Christmas music? Him? Something was going on, and he wasn\u2019t sure what. Thrusting his face under the spray, he let the water hit him full force. It occurred to him that his good night\u2019s sleep was because of the evening spent with Julie. He liked her. Julie Wilcoff was different from any woman he\u2019d ever known. His money didn\u2019t impress her, that was for sure. And she didn\u2019t seem to care about his position in the business world. If any other woman had behaved this way, he would\u2019ve assumed she was pretending, but Julie was genuine. Even a cynic like him could recognize that much.</p><p>Roy had often been the target of women looking for a free ride. He saw himself as reasonably wealthy and reasonably attractive; he knew he could date just about anyone he wanted. However, the idea of dating any woman after Aimee had become repugnant to him. Until Julie. He wasn\u2019t convinced he liked this, wasn\u2019t convinced he was making the right move or that he was interested in making any move at all.</p><p>When Roy arrived at the office, it seemed his whole staff was watching him. He felt their eyes on him as he strode through the lobby and toward the elevator. People turned and stared, and he heard a few hushed and badly disguised whispers. He resisted the urge to stop and ask, \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>Once inside his office, he followed his normal routine. Ms. Johnson phoned to remind him of a meeting. The Griffin Plastics file was still on his desk and he picked it up reluctantly. He decided he needed more information before making a final decision.</p><p>\u201cCould you ask Dean Wilcoff to be available after my meeting?\u201d Roy asked. \u201cI\u2019d like to talk to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see to it right away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>She hesitated as if she\u2019d never heard him express his appreciation before. \u201cWill that be all, Mr. Fletcher?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d He hung up the phone and leaned back in his soft leather chair, folding his hands. Something was in the air, something he couldn\u2019t explain. He didn\u2019t know what was different, but there was definitely a change, and it wasn\u2019t just him.</p><p>The meeting, concerning the launch of a new line of security software for home computers, ran smoothly. Roy hurried back to his office when it ended, and Dean Wilcoff came a few minutes later. \u201cYou asked to see me?\u201d the man said as Ms. Johnson showed him in. He certainly didn\u2019t waste any time, Roy observed. He got right to the point.</p><p>\u201cI did. Sit down.\u201d Roy gestured to the chair across from his desk. He wanted to talk to Wilcoff, but the matter wasn\u2019t business-related. Julie had been on his mind from the moment he\u2019d left her last night, and he realized he knew very little about her. They\u2019d talked, but she wasn\u2019t one to dwell on herself, unlike a lot of women he\u2019d known. Most wanted to impress him. Julie had surprised him in that way, too.</p><p>Dean sat close to the edge of the chair, apparently ill at ease.</p><p>\u201cDid Julie mention we had dinner together last night?\u201d Dean had called Julie to say he\u2019d be home late, and Roy had left before Dean\u2019s return.</p><p>\u201cShe did,\u201d Roy\u2019s head of security answered stiffly.</p><p>\u201cHow old is Julie?\u201d Roy had never thought to inquire, not that it was important.</p><p>Dean stiffened. \u201cYou should ask my daughter that, sir.\u201d</p><p>Ever respectful, Roy noted, and unwilling to mingle his personal life with his professional one. He tried another tactic. \u201cWhile we were having pizza, Julie told me she\u2019s a twin.\u201d</p><p>Dean nodded but volunteered no additional information.</p><p>\u201cI gave her a ride home from the office last night,\u201d Roy said, testing the waters, wading in a little deeper this time.</p><p>\u201cSo she said.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI tried to get her to accept my settlement offer.\u201d</p><p>Dean didn\u2019t respond.</p><p>\u201cShe refused.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy daughter\u2019s over twenty-one and makes her own decisions,\u201d Dean informed him.</p><p>\u201cAs she should,\u201d Roy murmured.</p><p>Dean met his eyes. \u201cI\u2019ve asked her to apologize for her behavior yesterday.\u201d</p><p>This should be interesting. \u201cAnd she agreed?\u201d Frankly, Roy would be surprised if she did. He\u2019d tried to talk sense into her over pizza and she\u2019d been as stubborn as ever. Judging by her dogged refusal, Roy didn\u2019t expect her to change her mind about his offer anytime soon.</p><p>\u201cJulie said she\u2019d give the matter of an apology some thought.\u201d</p><p>Roy smiled. So she hadn\u2019t ruled it out altogether. He admired her for that.</p><p>\u201cIs there anything else?\u201d Wilcoff asked, transparently eager to leave.</p><p>\u201cYes. Did I tell you my mother will be here at some point on Wednesday?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did.\u201d Dean stood. \u201cYou said she\u2019d be painting the lobby windows.\u201d</p><p>Roy stood, too. \u201cI\u2019ll check in with you later about Julie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about her?\u201d</p><p>Roy saw that he\u2019d spoken out of turn. \u201cAbout...whether she decides to apologize or not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s up to my daughter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, of course. No reflection on your job performance, Dean, which to this point has been excellent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>Roy nodded, dismissing the other man.</p><p>Dean moved to the door, then turned and met Roy\u2019s gaze. \u201cAre you romantically interested in my daughter?\u201d</p><p>Roy\u2019s throat went dry. Romantically interested in Julie? Instinct told him to deny it immediately, but he wasn\u2019t sure. \u201cWould it bother you if I was?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgain, that\u2019s my daughter\u2019s business. And yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, it is,\u201d Roy said. Theirs and nobody else\u2019s.</p><p>Shirley and Goodness, hovering above the office, nudged each other. Mercy gave them a thumbs-up and a big grin.</p><p>Kudos to Dean, they all decided, for having the nerve to ask.</p><p>Romantically interested? Yes!</p><p>Eleven</p><p>Anne was enjoying herself. Paintbrush in hand, she stood in the large lobby of her son\u2019s office building and spread the bright colors across the smooth glass, creating a festive greeting for all to see. She\u2019d drawn the outlines with a felt-tip pen and was now filling in the figures, using acrylic paints. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>This was the first Christmas season since the divorce that she\u2019d felt like celebrating. It wasn\u2019t an effort; nothing felt forced, least of all her happiness. She thanked the angel for that. The one who\u2019d appeared to her. Everything had changed for the better that day. Her heart felt lighter, less burdened, and life suddenly seemed good and right again.</p><p>After all these years, her prayer request had apparently been heard. Even now, Anne couldn\u2019t get over the glorious, wonderful sound of her son\u2019s laughter. Such a minor joy had felt forever lost to both of them. Even more wonderful, a woman\u2014the first one her son had mentioned in five years\u2014had caused this spark of excitement.</p><p>\u201cHow does that look, Jason?\u201d Anne asked the security guard. The young man certainly took his duties seriously. The entire time she\u2019d been painting, Jason had watched her. He must\u2019ve been told that no one was to bother her, and he made sure no one did.</p><p>Jason didn\u2019t answer and Anne turned around to see him studying the parking lot.</p> <p>\u201cTrouble?\u201d Anne asked.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps it\u2019d be best if you left the area, ma\u2019am.\u201d</p><p>Anne peered outside; the only person she could see was a young woman wearing what appeared to be a soccer uniform. She was walking toward the building. \u201cWho\u2019s that?\u201d Anne asked.</p><p>\u201cJulie Wilcoff,\u201d Jason answered in a low voice. He moved from behind the desk and stood directly in front of the glass doors, his posture a warning in itself.</p><p>Anne watched as the woman paused outside the door and smiled at the security guard. \u201cJason, I\u2019m here to talk to my father.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not falling for that a second time,\u201d he said. \u201cYour father told me to keep you out of this building and he hasn\u2019t told me anything different, so I\u2019m keeping you out.\u201d</p><p>The woman glanced impatiently at Anne and then back at the security guard. \u201cJason, please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019ve got a problem with that,\u201d the guard said matter-of-factly, \u201cthen I suggest you take it up with your father.\u201d</p><p>Ms. Wilcoff promptly pulled a cell phone out of her pocket, punched a few numbers and held it to her ear.</p><p>Jason stood exactly where he was.</p><p>\u201cIs this the girl who gave my son such a talking-to the other day?\u201d Anne asked. If so, Anne was eager to meet her.</p> <p>\u201cYes, ma\u2019am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHer father banned her from the building?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI believe Mr. Fletcher gave his approval, ma\u2019am.\u201d</p><p>Anne\u2019s spirits did an abrupt dive. \u201cI\u2019m sure he\u2019s had a change of heart,\u201d she said, praying she was right.</p><p>\u201cThen he\u2019ll need to tell me that himself, ma\u2019am.\u201d The guard wasn\u2019t budging, not an inch. That much was obvious.</p><p>Julie Wilcoff seemed to have difficulty reaching her father. With an air of frustration, she clicked off the cell phone. \u201cMy father isn\u2019t answering,\u201d she called from the other side of the door.</p><p>\u201cThat isn\u2019t my concern.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe asked to see me,\u201d she insisted.</p> <p>For a moment it seemed Jason might waver, but he held his ground. \u201cHe didn\u2019t say anything to me about that. I don\u2019t have any alternative but to do as I\u2019ve been instructed. You aren\u2019t allowed in this building. I\u2019m sorry, Ms. Wilcoff, but I have my orders.\u201d</p><p>Julie nodded. \u201cI understand. Will you tell my father I was by?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I see him,\u201d Jason said.</p><p>Julie nodded again and turned around. She started back toward the parking lot.</p><p>Anne refused to let this woman leave.</p><p>Jason moved from his post and Anne rushed to the door. \u201cMs. Wilcoff?\u201d she called. \u201cJulie?\u201d</p><p>Julie glanced over her shoulder.</p><p>Anne stood in the doorway and gave her a quick wave. \u201cI\u2019m Anne Fletcher, Roy\u2019s mother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, hi,\u201d she said. Turning again, she halted in her progress toward the visitors\u2019 parking lot. \u201cIt\u2019s a pleasure to meet you. I guess you heard about your son\u2019s and my disagreement.\u201d The wind whipped the hair about her face, and Julie swept it away with a stroke of her hand. \u201cI actually came to see Roy, but I needed to talk to my dad first. I can see that\u2019s impossible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it isn\u2019t.\u201d Anne raised her index finger. \u201cWait just a minute.\u201d She closed the door and discovered Jason frowning at her. \u201cI can\u2019t let her in here, Mrs. Fletcher,\u201d he said, \u201cso don\u2019t go asking me to make allowances.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had no intention of doing that.\u201d She planned to take another approach altogether. \u201cThe best thing would be to contact my son and get this settled once and for all.\u201d</p><p>Jason said nothing.</p><p>\u201cCan I use the phone on your desk?\u201d She didn\u2019t have a cell phone; it was an expense she couldn\u2019t afford.</p><p>\u201cGo ahead.\u201d He kept his gaze pinned to the door as if he half feared Julie might try to dash in while he wasn\u2019t looking.</p><p>Anne walked over to the desk and called Ms. Johnson, her son\u2019s assistant. \u201cHello, Eleanor,\u201d she said. \u201cCould I speak to my son?\u201d</p><p>The woman hesitated. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Mrs. Fletcher, he\u2019s in a meeting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA meeting,\u201d Anne repeated. She\u2019d long suspected that was the excuse Roy used when he wasn\u2019t in the mood to deal with her. \u201cDid he ask you to say that?\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cNot this time,\u201d his assistant admitted, confirming Anne\u2019s suspicions. \u201cHe actually is in a meeting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, dear,\u201d Anne said, breathing a sigh.</p><p>\u201cIs there anything I can do?\u201d</p><p>Anne chewed her lip. \u201cDo you happen to know Julie Wilcoff?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do.\u201d Eleanor\u2019s voice grew warm and excited.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn the building?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, the security guard won\u2019t let her inside. Apparently there\u2019s some edict her father gave and she\u2019s forbidden to come in. Is that true?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid it must be, but we all like Ms. Wilcoff.\u201d</p><p>Unfortunately, Jason hadn\u2019t gotten that memo. \u201cAny idea on how we can get her inside to see my son?\u201d</p><p>After another second\u2019s hesitation, Roy\u2019s assistant said, \u201cI\u2019ll be down directly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, thank you.\u201d Anne looked up and saw Jason frowning at her. Julie hadn\u2019t moved from her position outside the doors.</p><p>\u201cWhat did he say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t speak to my son, but Ms. Johnson is on her way down.\u201d</p><p>Jason frowned even more fiercely and shook his head. \u201cThat isn\u2019t good enough. It\u2019s got to be Mr. Wilcoff or Mr. Fletcher himself. No one else. As I explained earlier, I have my orders.\u201d</p><p>Anne ignored him and went back to the glass entrance doors. She opened one and said, \u201cI phoned Roy, but he\u2019s in a meeting. His assistant is coming down to see what she can do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right, Mrs. Fletcher. I\u2019ll just do this another time.\u201d</p><p>Anne shoved one arm out the door. \u201cNo! Stay where you are. I\u2019ll be right back.\u201d She turned away and then immediately turned around. \u201cPromise me you won\u2019t leave!\u201d If she was going to make a fool of herself, she wanted to be sure it was worth her while.</p><p>Julie grinned. \u201cI won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>Anne addressed Jason next. \u201cWhen Ms. Johnson arrives, tell her I\u2019ve gone to get my son.\u201d She refused to let this opportunity\u2014or this woman\u2014disappear from Roy\u2019s life. With a determination that astonished even her, Anne marched over to the elevators and pushed the button. When a car didn\u2019t come fast enough to suit her, she pushed it again.</p><p>A high-tech buzzing finally announced an elevator. To her relief, it was empty, and she shot to the top floor in what felt like seconds. Stepping off, she hurried into the foyer, glancing around. Ms. Johnson, as Anne knew, wasn\u2019t at her desk. Anne thought she heard voices at the end of the hallway and headed in that direction.</p><p>Sure enough, there was a meeting taking place in the conference room. Anne remembered seeing it when Roy had given her a tour shortly after moving into the building.</p><p>She hated to barge in, but there was nothing else she could do. Knocking politely at the door, Anne walked inside, her smock smeared with paint and her hair a mess. The room, which had been lively with conversation, went silent. Twenty or so men and women, all important-looking, sat around a long, rectangular table. Every one of them turned to stare at her. Anne smiled weakly and noticed that Roy was standing at the front of the room.</p><p>\u201cMother?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCould I speak to you a moment?\u201d</p><p>He raised his eyebrows. \u201cNow?\u201d</p><p>Anne held her breath. \u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>Roy gestured apologetically at his associates. \u201cIf you\u2019ll excuse me?\u201d</p><p>They all nodded and Roy walked to the back of the room. \u201cWhat is it, Mother?\u201d</p><p>From the way his eyes flared and the even, unemotional tone of his voice, Anne could tell he wasn\u2019t pleased. He guided her, none too gently, into the hallway.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry to interrupt you,\u201d she said, clasping her hands tightly.</p><p>\u201cIf this has to do with the Christmas scene on the windows, then\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no,\u201d she insisted, \u201cit\u2019s not about that.\u201d Her throat felt dry and it was difficult to concentrate. \u201cThis has to do with Jason...\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd who is Jason?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe security guard downstairs. He tells me Julie Wilcoff has been banned from the building. I know it was her father\u2019s doing, but Jason seems to believe you supported that decision. Did you?\u201d</p><p>His demeanor changed, and his mouth and eyes softened. \u201cI might have. Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow?\u201d</p><p>Anne nodded. \u201cJason won\u2019t let her in to speak to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe came to see me, did she?\u201d He folded his arms and seemed to consider this information with some amusement. Then the humor left his eyes. \u201cDid she give you any indication why she wanted to speak to me?\u201d</p><p>Anne shook her head. \u201cNot really.\u201d</p><p>His mouth twitched. Was that a smile trying to emerge? \u201cMs. Johnson did her best to talk Jason into letting her in, but he won\u2019t budge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll call him myself,\u201d Roy promised. \u201cGo ahead and have Ms. Johnson bring Julie up to my office. Tell her I\u2019ll be there in fifteen minutes.\u201d He glanced at his watch. \u201cMake that twenty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope I did the right thing,\u201d Anne said.</p><p>\u201cYou did exactly the right thing,\u201d he said, and to her complete shock, he took her by the shoulders and kissed her cheek.</p><p>Anne hurried downstairs. Jason was on the phone when she got off the elevator. He muttered something that sounded like \u201cyessir,\u201d replaced the receiver and walked over to the glass door, holding it open for Julie.</p><p>\u201cYou can come in now,\u201d he told the young woman, who stood outside.</p><p>Julie walked into the building slowly, as if she expected alarms to ring the instant she stepped over the threshold.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she said to Anne. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMr. Fletcher would like you to wait in his office,\u201d Ms. Johnson told her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be up in a moment,\u201d Julie said. She turned to Anne and the Christmas scene she\u2019d started painting on the windows. \u201cYou painted these angels?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh...yes.\u201d Anne had almost forgotten the reason she was in the lobby at all. She\u2019d painted three angels this time, floating on a cloud and looking down at Bethlehem and the manger scene. The angels dominated the painting, their joy at the Savior\u2019s birth evident.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re absolutely lovely,\u201d Julie said.</p> <p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had plenty of time to look at them while I was waiting, and they seem almost real to me.\u201d</p><p>Anne blushed with pleasure. \u201cHow kind you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRoy said you were an artist. You\u2019re obviously very talented.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRoy mentioned me?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, although I don\u2019t know him well.\u201d Julie shrugged. \u201cWe definitely got off on the wrong foot. I\u2019m here to talk to him and, well, I hope we can start again.\u201d</p><p>Anne clasped Julie\u2019s hand in both of hers. \u201cI hope you can, too. Could\u2014could you and I talk sometime?\u201d</p><p>Julie smiled. \u201cI\u2019d like that very much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo would I,\u201d Anne said. \u201cI\u2019ll be in touch.\u201d</p><p>Twelve</p><p>Julie was waiting in his office when Roy returned from the meeting, which he\u2019d adjourned rather quickly. She sat in the chair across from his desk, looking unusually demure. His mood had improved from the moment he learned she\u2019d come here to see him. He\u2019d been thinking of her ever since their pizza dinner, and he\u2019d wondered if he\u2019d see her again soon. He had his answer now and frankly, it was one he liked.</p> <p>\u201cJulie.\u201d He greeted her warmly, walking over to his desk and sitting behind it. \u201cThis is a pleasant surprise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope I\u2019m not disturbing you.\u201d She\u2019d apparently come to his office immediately after school, not bothering to change into street clothes first. Despite the weather, she wore shorts and a sports jersey, and a whistle dangled like a long necklace around her neck.</p><p>\u201cNot at all. What can I do for you?\u201d</p><p>He assumed she was there to accept his settlement; she didn\u2019t need to show up in person, but he was delighted she had. So she was like everyone else\u2014willing to take easy money. Yes, he was a little disillusioned, but he still liked her. He couldn\u2019t blame Julie Wilcoff for a quality shared by practically every other person on Earth. Greed was part of human nature, and he\u2019d long since reconciled himself to that.</p><p>\u201cI came to talk about what happened on Monday,\u201d she said simply. \u201cMy father felt I was out of line bursting in here the way I did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were angry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAngry,\u201d she repeated, and with a soft chuckle added, \u201cYou have no idea. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever been more insulted than\u2014\u201d She bit off the rest of her thought. \u201cAt any rate, Dad\u2019s right. I should never have reacted like that. I made a fool of myself.\u201d</p><p>Roy was quite enjoying this. \u201cSo you\u2019ve come around. Somehow, I knew you would.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCome around? To what?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t know why she insisted on denying the obvious. Certainly, the settlement was foremost in her mind; it had to be. \u201cI\u2019m talking about the money.\u201d</p><p>Julie frowned and shook her head. \u201cThis has nothing to do with money. It has to do with an apology.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not here because of the settlement?\u201d He wasn\u2019t fooled, but decided to play along for the time being.</p><p>\u201cI came to apologize for storming into your office and for the things I said. I\u2019m not here about that stupid, insulting settlement offer, which I have repeatedly rejected. I\u2019d think that by now you\u2019d get the message.\u201d With a visible effort, she managed to keep her anger in check.</p><p>Roy\u2019s own anger was rising. \u201cEveryone\u2019s interested in money, Julie, so don\u2019t even bother pretending otherwise. Let\u2019s both be honest, shall we? You aren\u2019t going to get a better offer, so just sign the papers my attorney mailed you and be done with it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI believe I already told you what I think of that,\u201d she muttered. She slid closer to the edge of the upholstered chair. Soon she was barely perched on the cushion at all. He thought she might be in danger of slipping onto the floor.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re holding out for more money, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>She bolted to her feet as if someone had pinched her. \u201cYou\u2019re impossible, you know that? I came here in good faith\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood faith?\u201d Roy didn\u2019t see it that way. Not when she said one thing and wanted another. But ultimately, human nature at its most basic couldn\u2019t be defeated.</p><p>\u201cI thought we\u2019d made some progress, you and I, and...well, I can see you\u2019re hopeless.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe?\u201d he shouted. \u201cYou\u2019re the one who\u2019s got her eye on the almighty dollar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want any of your stupid money! Why can\u2019t you get that through your head?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you\u2019re just like every other woman.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes seemed to grow wider. \u201cNow you\u2019re insulting not only me but every woman alive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, well, if the shoe fits.\u201d</p><p>Hands on her hips, Julie glared at him. \u201cThen I guess you know what you can do with your shoe.\u201d</p><p>He glared right back. Standing, he reached for his phone and punched in the number for security. \u201cPlease send somebody to escort Ms. Wilcoff from the building.\u201d</p><p>Julie\u2019s mouth sagged open in what appeared to be shock. \u201cThank you very much, but I can see myself out.\u201d She started for the open door, every step filled with indignation. She got halfway across the room before she swung around and said, \u201cI really tried, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJulie, just sign the settlement.\u201d They would put an end to this, once and for all. Then they could move on, maybe explore the possibilities between them. He\u2019d be willing to overlook this flaw; no doubt he had flaws of his own. Naivet\u00e9 about the motives of others didn\u2019t happen to be one of them. \u201cJust sign, okay?\u201d he said wearily.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d</p><p>Well, that answered that.</p><p>\u201cFurthermore, I think you\u2019re\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-uh,\u201d Roy said, holding up his finger. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to say something you\u2019ll regret.\u201d</p><p>The elevator doors opened before Julie had a chance to insult him. Jason, the guard from downstairs, loomed in the doorway. \u201cYou asked for security, Mr. Fletcher?\u201d</p><p>If looks could kill, Roy would be six feet under. As best he could, he ignored Julie\u2019s death-dealing glare. \u201cI did.\u201d</p><p>Jason gripped Julie by the elbow. \u201cOnce she\u2019s gone, is she allowed back in the building?\u201d</p><p>Julie closed her eyes. Roy looked at her curiously\u2014was she grinding her teeth? For whatever reason, the anger seemed to drain from her.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s play that by ear,\u201d Roy told the guard. When she saw that she had no choice but to sign, then and only then would Roy be willing to see her. He insisted on at least that much honesty.</p><p>Julie lifted her shoulders in a shrug. \u201cI\u2019ve destroyed the papers your attorney mailed, and I will destroy any replacement papers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is my final offer.\u201d</p><p>She grinned. \u201cI should hope so.\u201d Still in Jason\u2019s firm grip, she turned and walked away. \u201cGoodbye,\u201d she said over her shoulder. \u201cAnd I mean that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see that she leaves the building,\u201d Jason told Roy as he hustled her out the door.</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d Roy reclaimed his chair. Their conversation hadn\u2019t gone the way he\u2019d wanted. He\u2019d hoped they could find some common ground. His problem was that he genuinely liked her. Okay, so Julie was a little stubborn and clearly unreasonable. But now he was afraid he might never see her again, judging by that final goodbye. She\u2019d probably just mail the signed attorney\u2019s contract, disgruntled that her ploy to get more hadn\u2019t succeeded. She\u2019d settle for twenty-five thousand and she\u2019d avoid him from this moment on.</p><p>The thought depressed him. Besides, he was in the right. It was Julie who\u2019d been unreasonable, not him.</p><p>He returned to a number of pressing business matters, determined to put Julie out of his mind. Fifteen minutes later, he began to pace, unable to concentrate. Fifteen minutes after that, he called Ms. Johnson into his office.</p><p>\u201cSit down,\u201d he instructed his assistant when she entered the room. \u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>Watching him as he walked from one end of his office to the other, Ms. Johnson slowly lowered herself into the chair opposite his desk. \u201cIs everything all right, Mr. Fletcher?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat makes you ask?\u201d he muttered irritably.</p><p>She looked embarrassed now and her gaze followed him. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever seen you so...agitated.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not agitated,\u201d he barked.</p><p>She dropped her eyes. \u201cAs you say.\u201d</p><p>Roy resisted the inclination to argue with her to prove his point. He sank down in his chair, tempted to explain that he was the same as ever. But why bother? Women always stuck together.</p><p>\u201cYou wanted to see me?\u201d Ms. Johnson asked.</p><p>Roy nodded and steepled his fingers as he leaned forward, resting his elbows on his desk. \u201cI have a question and I\u2019d appreciate your honesty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir.\u201d</p><p>Again Roy felt her hesitation. She probably wasn\u2019t the best person to ask, but his options were limited. \u201cAm I an unreasonable man?\u201d He didn\u2019t know why he was questioning his own behavior, his own perceptions. Was there the slightest chance he was wrong in his beliefs about Julie?</p><p>Ms. Johnson\u2019s shoulders rose and then fell in a soundless sigh. \u201cYou can be at times,\u201d she said, obviously uncomfortable meeting his gaze.</p><p>\u201cI see,\u201d he said. \u201cCan you give me an example?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cJust now with Julie Wilcoff.\u201d</p><p>Roy was afraid she was going to say that. \u201cYou think I\u2019m the unreasonable one?\u201d Women stick together, he reminded himself.</p><p>\u201cMr. Fletcher, perhaps it would be better if you discussed this with someone else, someone more...appropriate.\u201d</p><p>Roy frowned, unable to imagine who else he could approach. \u201cI asked you.\u201d</p><p>His assistant edged forward. \u201cI had a chance to talk to Ms. Wilcoff while you were finishing up the Griffin meeting, and she seemed sincere to me. I know it was difficult for her to come, but out of respect for her father, she felt it was the right thing to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe had a rotten attitude,\u201d he snapped.</p><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t mind my saying so, it appears you\u2019re the one with the attitude problem.\u201d</p><p>His irritation flared briefly and then died.</p><p>\u201cNot once did she mention the settlement,\u201d Ms. Johnson continued. \u201cIf I were to guess, I\u2019d say she completely forgot about it. I believe she came here for precisely the reason she said\u2014to apologize for bursting into the office. She admitted there were better ways of handling the situation and she felt badly about it. I think she was afraid she\u2019d embarrassed her father.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThe only person she embarrassed was herself,\u201d Roy said.</p><p>\u201cAt least she was woman enough to admit it.\u201d</p><p>Roy looked thoughtfully at his executive assistant. She\u2019d spoken frankly in a way he\u2019d never expected. \u201cWhat are you suggesting?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m saying that perhaps it\u2019s time...\u201d She hesitated.</p> <p>\u201cGo on,\u201d he urged. He might as well hear it all.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps,\u201d she said, \u201cyou should talk to Julie about this.\u201d</p><p>Roy nodded, swallowing hard. Perhaps she was right.</p><p>When she was this angry, the best thing for Julie to do was run\u2014as if a pack of wolves was after her. The minute she got home, she tossed aside her shorts and changed into running gear. After a few perfunctory warm-up exercises, she took off. As her shoes hit the pavement, her thoughts chased each other around and around. Six miles passed, six pounding, breathless miles, before she found some measure of serenity. By then, her calves ached and her lungs burned. It was pitch-dark as she ran back to her neighborhood, cheered by the bright display of Christmas lights on the homes along her route.</p><p>As she rounded the corner to her house, she noticed a dark sedan parked in front. Her father was home, too; she saw his light blue car in the garage beside hers.</p> <p>Instead of waiting for her inside the house, Roy Fletcher sat on the top porch step. She came up the walkway, bent over and braced her hands against her knees as she caught her breath. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d she asked between gasps. If he wanted to resume their argument, she\u2019d walk into the house and slam the door.</p><p>Roy stood and brushed his hands against his sides. \u201cI don\u2019t know. It seemed like a nice afternoon for a drive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure it did,\u201d she said sarcastically, still breathing hard.</p><p>\u201cWould you believe I just happened to be in the neighborhood?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head.</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d he said. \u201cMs. Johnson suggested the two of us talk.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTalk...\u201d Julie straightened, not hiding her shock. The great Mr. Roy Fletcher was here to make peace.</p><p>\u201cThis time I was the one out of line.\u201d Apologies didn\u2019t come naturally to this man; he seemed to have trouble saying the words.</p><p>Julie stared into his eyes to see if she could judge his sincerity. As far as she could tell, he meant it. She smiled and offered him her hand. He took it, then smiled back\u2014a smile that was warm and lazy and completely sexy.</p><p>\u201cFurthermore, I\u2019m willing to make up for my rudeness,\u201d he told her.</p><p>\u201cReally? And how do you intend to do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDinner?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen?\u201d</p><p>He pulled a BlackBerry out of his pocket and looked up, meeting her eyes. \u201cWhat about tonight?\u201d</p> <p>Although tempted, Julie already had dinner in the Crock-Pot and test papers to grade. \u201cAnother night would be better.\u201d</p><p>He frowned, then suggested, \u201cFriday? That works for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry, I\u2019ve got a game.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat sort of game?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m the girls\u2019 soccer coach.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d He scrolled down his appointment calendar. \u201cSaturday evening is free from seven o\u2019clock on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but...\u201d Julie paused. \u201cIsn\u2019t that the parade of ships?\u201d This was one of her favorite Christmas traditions. Last year, she and her father had managed to get her mother down to the waterfront. It had been a highlight of the season for so many years, and she hated to miss it. Especially now, when the event held such a significant memory for her.</p><p>Roy glanced up. \u201cYes, I believe Saturday night is the annual Christmas parade of ships.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t suppose you\u2019d care to see that, would you?\u201d she asked hesitantly.</p><p>\u201cActually I would. I have a good view of Lake Washington if you\u2019d like to see it from my condo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDinner, too?\u201d</p><p>Grinning, he nodded.</p><p>\u201cWonderful.\u201d Julie was thrilled not only with the opportunity to view the boats festooned with their Christmas lights but to know Roy better. His coming here was encouraging. Then a thought sobered her. They continued to trip over the matter of that settlement again and again. \u201cYou have to agree to one thing first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine, let\u2019s hear it.\u201d</p><p>She threw back her shoulders. \u201cIf you say a word about the settlement or mention money even once, I\u2019m out of there.\u201d</p><p>He seemed about to argue. \u201cIf you insist,\u201d he finally said.</p><p>\u201cI do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I guess I have to agree.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d She smiled and raised both hands, palms up. \u201cSee? That wasn\u2019t so hard now, was it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs a matter of fact,\u201d he said with another grin, \u201cit was.\u201d</p><p>Julie laughed, walking past him and into the house. She opened the front door and looked over her shoulder, silently inviting him inside. \u201cI should ask my father to escort you from the house, just so you know how it feels.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, well\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever mind.\u201d Her father sat in the living room reading the evening paper. He lowered it as Julie walked in, Roy Fletcher a few steps behind.</p><p>\u201cDad, make Mr. Fletcher welcome while I shower, okay?\u201d</p><p>Her father\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe made peace,\u201d Julie explained.</p><p>Dean turned to Julie and then his employer. \u201cSomehow, I knew you would.\u201d He set his newspaper aside. \u201cDo you play poker, Mr. Fletcher?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow and then. I might be a little rusty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, that\u2019s not a problem.\u201d Her father rubbed his hands together and gave a stagy wink. \u201cI\u2019ll get a deck.\u201d</p><p>Thirteen</p><p>Anne couldn\u2019t stop smiling. Everything was working out so well between her son and Julie Wilcoff. With Eleanor Johnson, Roy\u2019s assistant, feeding her information, Anne had learned that he\u2019d gone to Julie\u2019s yesterday afternoon\u2014even though he\u2019d thrown her out of his office. Her son had actually sought out this delightful and strong-willed young woman.</p><p>That alone was enough to make Anne weak with joy, but then she\u2019d found out that Roy had gone a step further and asked Julie for a date. He\u2019d invited her to his home on Saturday! Ms. Johnson was busy contacting caterers. He was having Julie over for dinner, and then they were going to watch the Christmas parade of ships.</p><p>This was almost more than Anne had dared to hope, the best early Christmas gift she could ever receive.</p><p>Although Anne had only met Julie briefly, she\u2019d taken an instant liking to the young woman. Julie wasn\u2019t at all what she\u2019d expected, although that didn\u2019t matter. Julie was nearly as tall as her son and solidly built, but as Anne had learned a long time ago, it was character and not appearance that counted. Roy had fallen for a pretty face and an empty heart once, and he\u2019d suffered the consequences. So had Anne....</p><p>\u201cOh, my,\u201d she murmured aloud, irritated with herself. Describing Julie as \u201csolid\u201d made her sound dumpy and unattractive, and nothing could be further from the truth. She just wasn\u2019t Aimee, who was petite and blond and delicate. Julie was none of those things, and that was all to the good. Besides, solid applied to her character, solid and direct, unlike Aimee\u2019s wispy charm.</p><p>Anne had spent a second day at the office, finishing her angels. Home now, her spirits soaring, she stood barefoot in the kitchen chopping vegetables for a huge salad when the phone rang. She automatically checked her caller ID and noticed the New York area code.</p><p>It could only be Marta.</p><p>\u201cHello,\u201d Anne said, pleased to hear from her friend. The possibility that the angel painting might sell for an astronomical eight thousand dollars\u2014or more\u2014had set her heart racing with hope and excitement.</p><p>\u201cAnne, it\u2019s Marta. How are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFabulous! It was so nice to see you. I\u2019ve been feeling great ever since.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad,\u201d Marta said.</p><p>\u201cHow are you?\u201d Anne was concerned about her friend\u2019s marital situation.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m doing fine.\u201d</p><p>Somehow Anne doubted that. \u201cAnd Jack?\u201d</p><p>Marta hesitated. \u201cHe\u2019s still being Jack.\u201d</p><p>Anne knew then. Marta hadn\u2019t confronted her husband, because the potential aftermath of bringing the truth into the open outweighed the pain. Anne didn\u2019t blame Marta. Not so long ago she\u2019d faced a similar situation; she understood and sympathized.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m calling about the painting,\u201d Marta said brightly. A little too brightly.</p><p>Anne held her breath. \u201cDid my angel sell?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not for sale,\u201d Marta said flatly.</p><p>Taken aback, Anne said nothing.</p><p>\u201cPaintings are always more attractive when the artist refuses to sell, my dear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d To Anne\u2019s way of thinking, that was dishonest.</p><p>\u201cIt is your personal favorite, isn\u2019t that correct?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but...\u201d Four thousand dollars was half a year\u2019s worth of mortgage payments. Anne had begun to hope, to do something she\u2019d told herself she never would, and that was to count on selling one of her paintings. \u201cI would like to sell the angel....\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut only if the price is right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, yes...\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I told her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMrs. Gould. She\u2019s one of the Berkshire Goulds. She\u2019s got oodles and oodles of money.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe likes my angel?\u201d Anne was almost afraid to hope.</p><p>\u201cLikes her?\u201d Marta asked, laughing. \u201cEvelyn is determined to have her, but I wouldn\u2019t sell. I explained the situation and told her I needed to discuss it with you first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHas she offered eight thousand dollars?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Anne\u2019s heart fell. If an extremely wealthy woman hadn\u2019t offered that much for a painting she supposedly wanted, then perhaps she wasn\u2019t interested, after all.</p><p>\u201cShe offered more.\u201d Marta giggled.</p><p>\u201cTen thousand?\u201d Anne whispered.</p><p>\u201cMore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you turned her down?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I did. I had to confer with you. Besides, if we cave too easily, she might suspect you really want to sell it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Marta, I don\u2019t know if we\u2019re doing the right thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrust me, Anne. I\u2019ve been in this business for years. I know how to work this buyer. Furthermore, my commission from this sale is my Christmas gift to you.\u201d</p><p>Anne was astonished. \u201cI can\u2019t let you do that!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you can and you will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I want to make it on my own, Marta.\u201d This was one of the very reasons Anne had chosen to paint under the name of Mary Fleming. She didn\u2019t want her friends\u2019 charity.</p><p>\u201cIf you knew Mrs. Gould, you\u2019d know that she\u2019s\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m talking about the commission.\u201d</p><p>The line went quiet for a moment. \u201cActually,\u201d Marta confessed, \u201cI might end up moving in with you at some point, and I was hoping to pave the way in case that happened.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re serious?\u201d Sometimes with Marta it was hard to tell.</p><p>\u201cVery.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you haven\u2019t confronted Jack?\u201d</p><p>Anne heard Marta\u2019s sigh. \u201cI\u2019ve tried, and every time I broach the subject, it\u2019s as if Jack knows what\u2019s coming and starts talking about something else. Once he simply got up and left the room. I\u2019m so emotional about it. All I seem to do is cry and then I get so angry with Jack and with myself that I\u2019m a worthless mess.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOf course you\u2019re emotional!\u201d Anne said. \u201cYou have every right to be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI trusted Jack.\u201d</p><p>Anne had trusted Burton, too. Although she was reluctant to mention it, Anne felt she\u2019d be doing her friend a disservice if she didn\u2019t share the painful lessons she\u2019d learned. \u201cKeep an eye on your finances.\u201d She hated to give her more to worry about, but this was the trap Anne had fallen into, at great cost to herself.</p><p>\u201cJack would never\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI said the same thing about Burton,\u201d Anne told her. \u201cWhat you need to remember is that if Jack\u2019s untrustworthy in one area, he could be untrustworthy in others.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLike Burton?\u201d</p><p>Anne swallowed around the lump blocking her throat. \u201cLike Burton,\u201d she repeated.</p><p>\u201cHow much did he cheat you out of?\u201d</p><p>Anne didn\u2019t want to think about it, didn\u2019t want to confess how blind and foolish she\u2019d been. \u201cA quarter of a million dollars is my best estimate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, my,\u201d Marta breathed. \u201cThat much?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m past the anger now.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut how can you be?\u201d she demanded, outraged on Anne\u2019s behalf.</p><p>\u201cWhat else can I do? Hate him? Do you honestly think Burton cares how I feel about him?\u201d Anne had gone through all of this after the divorce, gone through it over and over again. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t matter. The only person I\u2019d be hurting is myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you must\u2019ve been an emotional wreck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I was. In the beginning I was angry, and then I was so hurt I couldn\u2019t stop crying. For a while, I wondered if it was even worth living.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Anne.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d never told anyone about those dark, ugly thoughts. Anne wondered if she should be confessing how bleak everything had seemed during those first dreadful months. When she\u2019d discovered how bad her financial situation was, she\u2019d sunk to her lowest depths. Once she\u2019d learned she could cope with even that, her sense of self had begun to reassert itself.</p><p>\u201cFrankly, I would\u2019ve wanted to kill him.\u201d</p><p>Anne laughed. \u201cI considered that, but I preferred not to spend the rest of my life in jail.\u201d</p> <p>Marta laughed, too, but there was little humor in it.</p><p>\u201cYou want advice?\u201d Anne had been in the same position Marta was now. She knew that her friend probably hadn\u2019t been ready to hear her suggestions when they\u2019d spoken the week before. She also knew how difficult it was to make decisions and think clearly during any kind of crisis.</p><p>\u201cPlease.\u201d Marta\u2019s voice was as soft as a whisper.</p><p>\u201cIf I were going through it again, the first thing I\u2019d do is see an attorney and have our joint assets frozen.\u201d</p><p>Marta\u2019s breath came in a rush. \u201cYou told me to see one when I met you in Seattle, but now? So soon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe sooner the better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Marta said, her voice gaining conviction. \u201cI can do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA good one, but not one you both know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right.\u201d Marta hesitated. \u201cShould I tell Jack what I\u2019ve done?\u201d</p><p>To be fair to both parties, Anne felt she should. \u201cI would. In your own time. It doesn\u2019t have to be confrontational.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI should keep it simple, in other words, like...like, I know what you\u2019re doing and I\u2019ve seen an attorney. Period. End of story.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do it.\u201d Marta sounded determined now.</p><p>Anne longed to put her arms around her friend and offer her reassurance and comfort. Marta, so experienced and sophisticated, was as emotionally vulnerable as Anne had been.</p><p>\u201cCall me the minute you know anything,\u201d Anne said, trying to encourage her.</p><p>\u201cAbout the painting?\u201d</p><p>Anne had forgotten about her angel. \u201cThat, too, but right now I\u2019m more concerned that you take care of yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...I think I\u2019ll wait until after the holidays,\u201d Marta said. \u201cTo see an attorney, I mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d Anne warned. \u201cDo it today, before you lose your nerve.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right, you\u2019re right. I will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd stay in touch,\u201d Anne said.</p><p>\u201cI will,\u201d Marta promised.</p><p>Anne hoped she would. But there was nothing more she could say or do. It was Marta\u2019s decision.</p><p>Fourteen</p><p>Things were working out nicely, Goodness thought. Despite their differences, Julie and Roy had knocked down some of the roadblocks that stood between them. Although she hadn\u2019t admitted it yet, Julie was attracted to Roy. They were having their first official date on Saturday, and the relationship was starting to take shape. Mercy was right, after all. Goodness gave her friend credit; Julie might very well be the answer to Anne\u2019s prayer request for her son.</p><p>This was the second evening the three angels had hovered over the Wilcoffs\u2019 living room while Dean and Roy played two-handed poker. Granted, Dean and not Julie had invited him tonight, since they\u2019d both enjoyed the previous poker game. But Julie hadn\u2019t objected. And she\u2019d even made dinner again\u2014black-bean soup, corn bread and a salad. Chatting as he dealt, Dean picked up his two cards for Texas Hold\u2019em and set the deck on the coffee table between them.</p><p>Roy looked over his cards and quickly placed his bet. Mercy, a serious student of cards, peered down at his hand.</p><p>\u201cShould I help him with the deal?\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Goodness cried. It was exactly this sort of intervention that got them in trouble. \u201cRoy can win or lose this game on his own. Besides, I think it would do him good if Dean beat him again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, come on,\u201d Mercy pleaded. \u201cDon\u2019t be such a spoilsport.\u201d</p><p>Shirley sat atop the light fixture and sighed expressively. \u201cHave you ever noticed how the game of poker is a lot like Roy\u2019s life just now?\u201d</p><p>Goodness and Mercy stared at her. Sometimes Shirley came up with the most bizarre pronouncements.</p><p>\u201cIn what way?\u201d Goodness was already certain she was going to regret asking.</p><p>\u201cNotice how willing Roy is to fold,\u201d Shirley said, pointing to the six and the three, one a spade and the other a heart.</p><p>\u201cWell, yes, but if I was dealt those cards in Texas Hold\u2019em, I\u2019d fold, too,\u201d Mercy told her. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t have much opportunity to make anything of it, and Dean has something better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRoy\u2019s done the same in life,\u201d Shirley said. \u201cHe\u2019s cast his father and Aimee aside. His inability to forgive them, as Anne has done, is a blight on his soul.\u201d She shook her head. \u201cForgiveness is hard, and most people tend to hold on to their hurts, to take some kind of perverse satisfaction in them. I don\u2019t understand, but it\u2019s the way of humans.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRoy needs more time,\u201d Goodness murmured. Angry and bitter as he was, any positive relationship with his father was impossible. Every effort Burton had made toward reconciliation with his son, Roy had rejected. He wasn\u2019t anywhere close to finding forgiveness for either his father or Aimee.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps,\u201d Shirley agreed, but reluctantly.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll get a better hand next time,\u201d Mercy said, watching as Roy shuffled the deck.</p><p>\u201cHe needs what humans call luck, and we both know there\u2019s no such thing as luck, only God,\u201d Goodness reminded them both, but no one seemed to be listening. Both her fellow Prayer Ambassadors were intent on the game.</p><p>\u201cRoy needs all the help he can get,\u201d Shirley said. \u201cThat\u2019s why we\u2019re here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you lend him a little heavenly assistance?\u201d Goodness asked when Roy came up with a pair of kings.</p><p>First Mercy and now Shirley. The two of them were out of control. Goodness was the only one with a sense of mission, a sense of purpose. They had important work to accomplish, and her fellow Ambassadors weren\u2019t taking it seriously. They seemed more interested in this card game. Not that Goodness was averse to poker, of course, but unlike her colleagues, she did have her priorities straight. Pouting, she folded her wings, crossed her arms and tapped her foot.</p><p>Mercy looked up, surprised at this uncharacteristic display of temper. \u201cI didn\u2019t have anything to do with him getting that pair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, neither,\u201d Shirley said with an expression of such innocence that Goodness had no choice but to believe her. \u201cI\u2019m just saying Roy could do with a good turn of the cards, but I wasn\u2019t responsible for that one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, all right,\u201d Goodness muttered. She was tired of policing her friends. And at least they seemed to be realigning their priorities....</p><p>The phone rang. \u201cWho\u2019s that?\u201d Mercy asked.</p><p>\u201cQuiet,\u201d Goodness said. \u201cJulie\u2019s answering it.\u201d</p><p>Both Shirley and Mercy flew around while Goodness hovered in the kitchen doorway, listening in on the conversation. \u201cIt\u2019s Anne,\u201d she said excitedly.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d she get Julie\u2019s phone number?\u201d Shirley asked.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably the phone book,\u201d Mercy suggested.</p><p>\u201cWhat does she want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShh,\u201d Goodness cautioned. This was wonderful! She beamed at her friends. \u201cAnne\u2019s inviting her to lunch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSaturday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s having dinner with Roy on Saturday,\u201d Mercy said with a worried frown.</p><p>Goodness motioned for them to be quiet, fast losing her patience. This was hard enough without the two of them pestering her. Mercy held both hands over her mouth, while Shirley whirled about the room like a hamster on a treadmill.</p><p>\u201cWell?\u201d Shirley said when Goodness left the kitchen doorway.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re meeting on the Seattle waterfront.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love the waterfront,\u201d Mercy said.</p><p>Goodness looked at her. \u201cPromise me you won\u2019t start throwing those salmon again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not making any such promise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeed I remind you that we\u2019re on a mission?\u201d</p><p>Shirley nodded sternly. \u201cA very important mission.\u201d</p><p>Goodness noticed how Mercy glanced longingly at the deck of cards and the piles of chips. She found it far too easy to get distracted. Maybe her priorities weren\u2019t quite in order yet.</p><p>Julie gathered the team of junior-high girls around her. Huddling close together to ward off the December-afternoon cold, her soccer team radiated energy and enthusiasm. Each girl thrust her right arm into the center of the huddle and gave a loud cheer.</p><p>The first string raced onto the field for the opening kick, and the others returned to the bench. As Julie started down the sideline, she glanced into the stadium. A number of parents had already arrived. More would come later in the game, depending on work schedules. The girls appreciated the support and so did Julie. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She had several talented players. Most of the girls had been involved with soccer from the age of five, and they knew how to play as a team. At halftime, they were ahead three to two.</p><p>Their audience had grown, Julie saw as she sent her girls back onto the field for the second half of the game. Darkness descended earlier and earlier these days, and the field lights came on automatically. As they did, she saw a lone figure standing by the chain-link fence at the far end of the field. It couldn\u2019t be. Roy Fletcher? Surely she was mistaken. Why would he attend one of her games?</p><p>Julie felt the blood rush to her face and then just as quickly drain away. He\u2019d been to the house for dinner two nights in a row, and played cards with her father both times. He\u2019d apparently enjoyed the meals, although she\u2019d never thought of Roy Fletcher as the kind of man who\u2019d appreciate a bowl of black-bean soup and buttery corn bread. He\u2019d surprised her by accepting and then eating two big bowlfuls, all the while praising her cooking skills. He\u2019d been equally enthusiastic about Wednesday\u2019s Crock-Pot stew. Now he\u2019d shown up at her soccer game.</p><p>The two teams were tied in the third quarter, but Abraham Lincoln managed to pull off a win with a last-second goal, ending the match with a score of four to three. Julie went into the locker room with the team, but she didn\u2019t expect Roy to be waiting for her when she finished nearly an hour later, after the girls had showered, changed and cleaned up.</p> <p>Locking the room, she carried the soccer balls to the equipment area, then headed toward the faculty parking lot. As she stepped from the building and into the darkness of late afternoon, she saw Roy silhouetted against one of the lights. He\u2019d pulled his vehicle around to where she\u2019d parked and leaned casually against the fender as if he had nothing better to do.</p><p>\u201cI wondered if you\u2019d gotten lost in there.\u201d He straightened as she approached and moved toward her.</p><p>\u201cHi.\u201d His being here flustered Julie. Roy Fletcher was a very important man, far too important to spend valuable time watching her coach a soccer game. \u201cI thought I saw you.\u201d That wasn\u2019t the most intelligent comment she\u2019d ever made, but she couldn\u2019t think of anything better.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t get here until halftime.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t need to come. I certainly didn\u2019t expect you to.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t expect to come, either,\u201d he confessed. His hands were plunged deep in his overcoat pockets. \u201cIt\u2019s been years since I attended a soccer match. This afternoon, a business associate sent me a report about our overseas sales, and I suddenly started thinking about European soccer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey take it very seriously over there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeems to me your girls do, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue.\u201d She nodded slowly. \u201cMy team works hard and winning is important, but it\u2019s about far more than that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI disagree,\u201d he countered. \u201cWinning is everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps in your line of work.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIn every line of work. In everything. Look at soccer. Each game counts and\u2014\u201d</p><p>Julie held up her hand. Life and business were intense for Roy. Or maybe life was business in his view. \u201cNow isn\u2019t the time to be having this conversation,\u201d she said briskly. Julie was tired and cold and in no state to reason with Roy Fletcher. If he wanted to argue, she\u2019d prefer to be at her best, and currently she was far from it.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d he murmured as he walked her to her car.</p><p>\u201cYou came, and I\u2019d like to thank you for that,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the weird part,\u201d Roy went on. \u201cI got sidetracked there for a moment. As I said, I was looking at European sales figures, and I started thinking about soccer. Then I remembered that you were coaching a game this afternoon and I had this strange urge to come and watch.\u201d</p><p>She noticed the urge hadn\u2019t been to come and see her. \u201cStrange urge or not, I\u2019m honored you were here.\u201d She told herself it was ludicrous to feel disappointed that she hadn\u2019t been the reason.</p><p>\u201cIt was an excellent game.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you on behalf of my team.\u201d She inserted the key into her lock, anxious now to get home and under a hot shower.</p> <p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re an excellent coach.\u201d</p><p>Again she smiled her appreciation. She tossed her backpack on the passenger seat. She didn\u2019t want to be rude by climbing into her car and driving away, but Roy didn\u2019t seem to have anything else to say.</p><p>As it turned out, Julie was wrong about that.</p><p>\u201cDo you enjoy clam chowder?\u201d he asked unexpectedly.</p><p>\u201cYes, I do.\u201d It was one of her favorite soups.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a little hole-in-the-wall caf\u00e9 not far from here. They used to serve the most incredible clam chowder. I don\u2019t even know if the caf\u00e9\u2019s still open. I haven\u2019t been there in years, but I\u2019m willing to look if you are.\u201d</p><p>Julie wanted to be sure she understood what he was asking her. \u201cAre you inviting me to dinner?\u201d He seemed nervous about this, but she must be misreading him. Roy Fletcher had nothing to be nervous about.</p><p>\u201cYes, I guess I am asking you to dinner.\u201d He brushed a hand across his face. \u201cLike I said, I don\u2019t know if the caf\u00e9\u2019s still open. I ate there in college quite a lot. The food was cheap and good.\u201d</p><p>Money certainly wasn\u2019t something he needed to worry about now.</p><p>The differences between them\u2014between his fame and wealth and her middle-class obscurity\u2014would probably be a factor if they were to continue seeing each other. In a flash Julie understood; it was more than dinner he was asking her about. He did want to see her, get to know her, and he was asking if she felt the same way about him.</p><p>The look in his eyes was intense. \u201cI like what I know about you, Julie.\u201d</p><p>She was bewildered and a little shaken. Roy Fletcher was interested in dating her, a thirty-year-old teacher with few marriage prospects. \u201cOther than your tendency to be arrogant, I like you, too.\u201d</p><p>He grinned. \u201cYou have your faults.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe word stubborn comes to mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m stubborn when I happen to be right.\u201d She wasn\u2019t letting that one pass.</p><p>He smiled. \u201cI think that\u2019s a conversation we should reserve for another time,\u201d he said, echoing her earlier remark. \u201cAgreed?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cI can go to dinner dressed like this?\u201d She had on a nylon blue-and-white running suit\u2014the Abraham Lincoln school colors. Her name was printed across the back with the silkscreen of a wolf, the team symbol.</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d he said. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you come with me and then I\u2019ll drive you back here to pick up your car when we\u2019re finished.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds good.\u201d</p><p>Once they were in the neighborhood, it took Roy fifteen minutes to find the caf\u00e9. The restaurant had moved in the eight years since he\u2019d last eaten there. They sat in a booth in a far corner, ordered clam chowder and coffee and discussed movies, politics, the stock market, the state of the economy and a thousand other things. Before she realized it, the caf\u00e9 was closing.</p><p>As Julie undressed for bed that night, she could hardly believe they\u2019d had so much to talk about. For three hours, they\u2019d chatted nonstop, as if they\u2019d known each other their entire lives. She felt genuinely comfortable with him, enjoying his warmth and wit, qualities she wouldn\u2019t have guessed he had a couple of weeks ago. After a quick e-mail to Emily, she went to bed.</p><p>If anything surprised her, it was the fact that Roy didn\u2019t kiss her when he dropped her off at the school to get her car. He wanted to\u2014she was sure of it\u2014and she wanted him to, but...</p><p>\u201cAre we still on for tomorrow night?\u201d he\u2019d asked.</p><p>Julie was looking forward to it more than ever. \u201cYes. As far as I\u2019m concerned. What about you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes.\u201d</p><p>That was when she thought he might kiss her. He didn\u2019t, but she had the distinct impression he intended to make up for it while they watched the Christmas ships.</p><p>Fifteen</p><p>Anne Fletcher strolled leisurely along the Seattle waterfront on her way to Pike Place Market. Julie Wilcoff was meeting her at the seafood stand at noon. Christmas was only two weeks away, and the city was festive with holiday decorations and full of contagious excitement. Even the leaden sky couldn\u2019t dampen Anne\u2019s spirits. Despite being alone, she felt the goodwill and joy of others as they went about their business.</p><p>Walking up the tiered stairway called Hill Climb from the waterfront area to the market, Anne paused to look back over Elliot Bay, watching as the green-and-white Washington State Ferry glided toward the pier. On a clear day she\u2019d be able to see the snow-crested tops of the Olympic Mountains to the east and the Cascade Mountains to the west. Until the divorce, California had been Anne\u2019s only home. She\u2019d loved living on the ocean; her daily routine had included long walks on the beach. That was a habit she\u2019d continued when she came to Washington.</p><p>The move north had been a financial necessity, as well as a practical choice. Roy lived close by, and while she treasured her independence, she needed the security of having her only child near at hand. It was a plus that property values in the more sparsely populated San Juan Islands were low enough to allow her to purchase a small cottage. The contentment she derived from her daily walks had rejuvenated her spirits and helped her recover in those first dreadful months after the divorce.</p><p>Seattle and the Puget Sound area were beginning to feel like home. Anne had told Roy she was reasonably happy, and it was true. She\u2019d found satisfaction in her art, and seeing her son fall in love again brought renewed hope for the future.</p><p>As Anne made her way through the tide of shoppers and tourists, she discovered Julie waiting for her. The girl was as tall as her father, whom Anne had met the afternoon she\u2019d painted the company window. She\u2019d be a good match for Roy, physically and mentally. She smiled as she recalled her first meeting with Julie, a memory inextricably connected with her painting on the window. That painting had created something of a stir, according to Eleanor Johnson, Roy\u2019s assistant. Fletcher Industries employees had reacted to the angels over Bethlehem the same way Marta had responded to her portrait of the angel. Ms. Johnson claimed the artwork was the talk of the building. Everyone loved it, she said. Knowing her art pleased others filled Anne with a sense of joy.</p><p>\u201cMerry Christmas, Mrs. Fletcher.\u201d</p><p>The greeting caught Anne unawares, involved in her thoughts as she was. \u201cJulie, hello!\u201d Anne leaned forward to kiss Julie on the cheek. \u201cCall me Anne, please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right.\u201d</p><p>She slipped her arm through Julie\u2019s, and they strolled into the market. \u201cI can\u2019t resist taking a peek, can you?\u201d The aisles between the vendors\u2019 stalls were crowded with customers buying seafood, vegetables and flowers, both fresh and dried. Arts and crafts shops were located downstairs.</p><p>\u201cI love it here,\u201d Julie told her. \u201cMy mother used to bring my sister and me to the market on special occasions when we were little. She\u2019d purchase a fresh salmon just so we could see the young men toss them back and forth.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou must have a wonderful mother,\u201d Anne said.</p><p>\u201cI did. She died earlier this year.\u201d Julie paused as though it was difficult to speak of her mother. \u201cDad and I miss her so much.\u201d</p><p>Anne gave the girl\u2019s arm a gentle squeeze. \u201cIt\u2019s harder around Christmas, isn\u2019t it? Especially the first Christmas.\u201d</p><p>Julie nodded. \u201cDad and I don\u2019t have the tree up yet. We just can\u2019t seem to muster the spirit. I\u2019m hoping we can do it this weekend.\u201d</p> <p>Anne tried to think of a way to introduce her son into the conversation. \u201cRoy isn\u2019t much for celebrating Christmas. He\u2019ll come to my place for the day, but only because he knows I want him to. If it was up to him, he\u2019d be just as happy to go to the office and appreciate the fact that he isn\u2019t likely to be interrupted.\u201d It hurt a little to admit that, but it was the truth.</p><p>\u201cEbenezer Scrooge, is he?\u201d</p><p>Anne smiled and matched her steps to Julie\u2019s. \u201cYes, I do believe he is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, my!\u201d Julie exclaimed, stopping abruptly. \u201cDid you see that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee what?\u201d Anne looked around and didn\u2019t see anything out of the ordinary.</p> <p>\u201cA fish just flew!\u201d</p><p>\u201cA fish flew,\u201d Anne repeated, certain she\u2019d misunderstood. \u201cThese young men throw them back and forth,\u201d she reminded Julie.</p><p>\u201cYes, I know, but one just took off on its own\u2014no one was standing next to it.\u201d She shook her head uncertainly. \u201cI must\u2019ve missed something. Oh, there goes another one!\u201d</p><p>Anne looked at the fresh seafood nestled on a bed of crushed ice. Sure enough, a huge coho salmon was spread across a display of large prawns. Just as she noticed it was out of place, the salmon sprang straight up in the air and started to spin tail over fins, as if someone had caught it on a line. Anne rubbed her eyes, convinced she was hallucinating.</p><p>\u201cDid you see that?\u201d Julie whispered.</p><p>\u201cI did,\u201d Anne said. \u201cI think we should get out of here. There\u2019s something strange going on.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t agree with you more.\u201d</p><p>Arms linked, the two women walked quickly out of the crowded market. Anne couldn\u2019t believe other people hadn\u2019t seen this startling phenomenon. But no one else had reacted at all, let alone with awe or astonishment.</p><p>Fifteen minutes later, they were in an Italian eatery off a side street. They sat at a small table with a red-checkered tablecloth; a half-melted candle stuck in an empty wine bottle served as the centerpiece. It reminded Anne of the inexpensive restaurants, usually situated in basements, that she and Burton used to frequent when he was in law school.... She cast off the nostalgia before it could trap her.</p><p>Anne and Julie both ordered a glass of Chianti with their spinach salads.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m seeing Roy again tonight,\u201d Julie said after her first sip of wine. \u201cWe...had dinner last night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd on Wednesday and Thursday.\u201d Anne had found this out quite by accident when she\u2019d phoned the house to arrange her luncheon date with Julie. It had given Anne such hope, such encouragement. Julie had made a point of letting her know that her father had invited him on Thursday\u2014but that didn\u2019t explain Wednesday. Or Friday.</p><p>\u201cWe talked for a long time last night.\u201d</p><p>Anne noticed that Julie\u2019s hand tightened around the stem of her wineglass. She had to restrain herself from leaping up and shouting for joy. She wondered how much of their story Julie knew, so she asked, \u201cDid he mention Aimee?\u201d</p> <p>Julie\u2019s eyes held hers. \u201cNo. Is she the reason you suggested lunch?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really.\u201d Anne shrugged. \u201cI hope you don\u2019t think I\u2019m a busybody.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so glad Roy\u2019s finally met someone he can love.\u201d Julie abruptly dropped her gaze and Anne realized she\u2019d spoken out of turn. \u201cOh, dear, forgive me. I shouldn\u2019t have said that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know if Roy loves me\u2014and it\u2019s far too soon to know how I feel about him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry. Please forget I said anything. I\u2019m just a meddling mother who\u2019s eager for grandchildren.\u201d The instant those words were out, Anne realized she\u2019d done it again.</p><p>\u201cGrandchildren?\u201d Julie\u2019s eyes grew huge.</p><p>\u201cOh, dear,\u201d Anne gasped. \u201cI do seem to be having trouble keeping my foot out of my mouth.\u201d She set her wineglass down, determined not to take another sip until she\u2019d fully recovered from whatever had loosened her tongue. Every word embarrassed her more.</p><p>\u201cI take it Roy was once in love with Aimee,\u201d Julie said as the waiter brought their salads.</p><p>\u201cHe wanted to marry her, but she chose...someone else.\u201d Anne hoped to avoid the more sordid details.</p><p>\u201cSeeing how successful Roy is now, I imagine she\u2019s sorry.\u201d Suddenly Julie looked chagrined and lowered her fork. \u201cForgive me. That was a dreadful thing to say.\u201d</p><p>Immersed in her own thoughts, Anne was confused. \u201cDreadful? How?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean to imply that the only reason Aimee or any woman would love Roy is because he\u2019s successful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you didn\u2019t mean anything disparaging,\u201d Anne assured her. \u201cBesides, you\u2019re wrong.\u201d</p><p>Julie looked puzzled, and Anne felt obliged to explain. \u201cAimee doesn\u2019t appear to have any regrets.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen she\u2019s happy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t know. You see\u2014\u201d Anne took a deep breath \u201c\u2014she\u2019s married to my husband.\u201d Although she tried hard to keep her emotions out of it, Anne heard the hint of bitterness in her voice. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Julie, I meant my ex-husband.\u201d</p><p>The linen napkin on Julie\u2019s lap slipped unnoticed to the floor. \u201cNo wonder Roy has a problem with trust,\u201d she whispered. \u201cHis fianc\u00e9e, his father...\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow you know,\u201d Anne said softly. \u201cRoy wouldn\u2019t appreciate my telling you, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t say anything.\u201d</p><p>Anne appreciated that. \u201cActually, digging up the skeletons in our family\u2019s sad history isn\u2019t why I asked you to lunch,\u201d she said. \u201cI want to get to know you better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI feel the same way. I loved the picture you painted on the window. Dad says everyone\u2019s talking about it, and Roy speaks so fondly of you and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did he say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d Julie said, beaming Anne a bright smile, \u201che brags about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy son brags about me?\u201d Anne hated to sound shocked\u2014but she was. Half the time, she felt as though she was nothing more than an obligation in her son\u2019s life. He only tolerated her concern and seldom sought out her company.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s very impressed with your work. He told me about several of your pieces he\u2019s displayed in the building. He promised to show them to me on my next visit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you can get in,\u201d Anne teased. It\u2019d been a source of amusement, the trouble Julie had getting past the security guard.</p><p>\u201cAh, yes, Jason, protector of the gate.\u201d Julie rolled her eyes.</p><p>Anne had witnessed for herself how committed the young man was to keeping the poor girl on the other side of the company doors. She stabbed at a piece of spinach, suddenly realizing what Julie had said. \u201cLet me make sure I understood you correctly. Did you really say Roy has my artwork hanging in his office building?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what he told me.\u201d</p><p>This was news.</p><p>\u201cFive landscapes, I think he said. You didn\u2019t know that?\u201d</p><p>Anne shook her head. \u201cI never told him my pseudonym.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe must\u2019ve found it out on his own,\u201d Julie said evenly.</p><p>\u201cI...I don\u2019t know what to say. Part of me is pleased and another part is irritated.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut why? He\u2019s proud of your talent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve told him a dozen times that I refuse to let him support me. I want my paintings to sell on their own merit. The last thing I want or need, especially from my own son, is charity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI doubt Roy would display work he didn\u2019t genuinely like.\u201d</p><p>Julie meant she was overreacting, Anne thought. \u201cYou\u2019re right of course.\u201d To cover her embarrassment, she dug into her salad.</p><p>Julie reached for a warm sourdough roll. \u201cI\u2019m glad you asked me to lunch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs I said, I want to get to know you\u2014and I want to thank you for being so patient with my son.\u201d</p><p>Julie lowered her head and struggled to hide a grin. \u201cWe\u2019ve certainly had our ups and downs. He\u2019s surprised me more than once.\u201d</p><p>Anne found this curious. \u201cIn what way?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDinner on Thursday night\u2014to take one example. I made a pot of black-bean soup and he seemed to really enjoy it. Plain ol\u2019 black-bean soup.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou cook?\u201d</p><p>Julie nodded. \u201cA little. My twin sister is the real chef in the family, but I\u2019m learning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you close to your sister?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery. She lives in Florida, but we talk almost every day via e-mail. I\u2019ve told her about Roy.\u201d Julie glanced down, as if she regretted telling Anne that.</p><p>Anne tried unsuccessfully to keep her tears at bay.</p><p>\u201cAnne, is everything all right?\u201d Julie leaned across the table and squeezed her hand.</p><p>\u201cOf course it is,\u201d Anne whispered, smiling through her tears. \u201cIt\u2019s just that...I\u2019d given up hope, you see. I\u2019d convinced myself that Roy had completely closed himself off from love, and now he\u2019s met you and the whole world looks brighter. Thank you, Julie, thank you so much.\u201d</p><p>Julie shook her head. \u201cYou don\u2019t have anything to thank me for.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I do,\u201d Anne countered. \u201cDon\u2019t you see, my dear Julie? You\u2019re the answer to my prayers.\u201d</p><p>Sixteen</p><p>The caterer\u2019s staff delivered dinner and skillfully set the dining room table in his condo, adding candles and flowers to create a romantic mood. Before they left, Roy paid them handsomely and inspected their work, admiring the small touches.</p><p>He\u2019d been looking forward to this evening with Julie all day. He\u2019d longed to kiss her the night before and hadn\u2019t. He berated himself for the missed opportunity. He\u2019d sensed the disappointment in her and felt it himself.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t experienced these primal emotions, these deep erotic urges, in years. They were a distant memory now. But with Julie...</p><p>The table was covered with an off-white linen cloth that had elegant gold edging. It wouldn\u2019t have been his choice, but the caterer had brought it with her. A large candle inside a glass hurricane lamp, surrounded by poinsettias and sprigs of holly, adorned the center of the table. Again, that had been part of the dinner package. When he\u2019d explained his requirements to Ms. Johnson and the caterer\u2019s staff, he\u2019d been assured that they\u2019d be able to create the mood he desired. His trust had been well-placed; his home had never looked better.</p><p>Everything about the condo spoke of romance. The lights were dimmed and lit candles were arranged in strategic spots around the room. In the background, Christmas carols played softly. The stage was set. Roy, dressed in dark slacks and a gray cashmere sweater, checked his watch. Julie was due any minute. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>While he waited, he poured himself a glass of chardonnay. To his surprise, he was nervous. He couldn\u2019t imagine why\u2014or could he? His mind flitted from the past to the present and back again. The past was painful and the present was unpredictable...and the future? Well, who knew about the future?</p><p>Initially this relationship hadn\u2019t been too promising, but it had gained momentum in the last few days. Even now he wasn\u2019t entirely convinced that Julie was for real, that the settlement offer truly didn\u2019t interest her.</p><p>Gradually Roy could feel himself being drawn toward her, almost against his will. He\u2019d decided never to fall in love again, but Julie Wilcoff made him crave the experience of love, the sensations and the feelings and the hope. This sense of wanting to be part of life again frightened him; so did the eagerness that surged through him at the prospect. Love eventually brought pain and betrayal. Yet all day he\u2019d thought of little else but this dinner with Julie and the kisses they were bound to share.</p><p>His phone rang and he reached for the receiver, already knowing it was her. \u201cHello.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m here.\u201d Even the sound of her voice was sultry.</p><p>He hit the numbers that automatically opened the electronic gates to grant her entrance. He couldn\u2019t resist taking his private elevator to the lobby so he could escort her up to his suite.</p><p>Standing by the glass doors that opened into the beautifully decorated lobby, Roy watched as Julie walked from her car to the building. Her head was bent against the cold. She had on a long wool coat, which she\u2019d left unbuttoned. Beneath it, he saw the sleek black skirt and matching jacket with a silky white blouse. He was struck by her loveliness. Every time he saw her, she seemed to look more beautiful. Was that just a matter of perception or was he finally seeing what had always been there?</p><p>He held the door and stepped back to let her enter. Once she was inside, he made a leisurely appraisal and sucked in his breath. He could think of only one word. \u201cWow!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou like?\u201d Holding open her coat, she slowly pivoted to give him a better look.</p> <p>\u201cI like a lot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t act so surprised,\u201d she muttered. \u201cI clean up good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll say.\u201d With his hand at her elbow, he steered her toward the elevator, which took them directly to the suite, the doors opening into his living room, with the large picture windows that overlooked Lake Washington. He\u2019d grown accustomed to the spectacular sight and it no longer astonished him as it once had. But the view captured Julie\u2019s attention the instant she stepped out of the elevator. An uninterrupted panorama of Lake Washington and the sparkling Seattle lights stretched before her like some kind of Christmas fantasy.</p><p>\u201cOh, Roy,\u201d she whispered, \u201cthis takes my breath away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s what sold me on the place.\u201d To his chagrin, she remained rooted to the spot. Seemingly without her noticing, he took off her coat, one sleeve at a time, and hung it in the hall closet. When he returned, she still hadn\u2019t moved.</p><p>\u201cThe parade of ships is supposed to start in less than thirty minutes.\u201d</p> <p>She walked close to the window and, standing next to her, Roy pointed out some of the sights. \u201cNaturally, the view is even more spectacular in daylight,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI can hardly imagine anything more beautiful than this.\u201d She hadn\u2019t even glanced around his condo, but Roy didn\u2019t care. Although it was a showpiece, he rarely had anyone up to visit. He\u2019d heard that people were curious about his home, but Julie was obviously more intrigued by the view.</p><p>Without asking, Roy poured her a glass of wine. Joining her once again, he handed it to her. \u201cShall we have a drink before we eat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d She accepted the glass, then turned back to stare out the window. \u201cI can\u2019t bear to look away. This is just so beautiful.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d thought he\u2019d wait to kiss her, but realized that delaying it another moment was beyond him. Taking the wineglass from her hand, placing it on the wide windowsill, he gently turned her toward him. \u201cWhat you need is a distraction.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t know a woman of thirty could blush, but blush she did. For long seconds her eyes searched his, telling him she wanted his kiss.</p><p>Bringing her into his arms, he watched as her eyes drifted closed and she leaned into his embrace. Then they were kissing with the familiarity and ease of longtime lovers. Roy felt a small tremor go through her, or perhaps he was the one who trembled; he no longer knew. What he did know was how good it felt to hold her.</p><p>She was taller than any other woman he\u2019d kissed, broader through the shoulders, too, but he liked that. In fact, he liked everything about Julie. He immediately wanted to kiss her again. She opened to him a little more, parting her lips, as her arms slid upward and around his neck.</p> <p>A voice in his mind started shouting that kissing her was too wonderful to continue without consequences. He hadn\u2019t intended to let things go this far, this fast, but there was no stopping either of them. Not yet. A few more kisses and then he\u2019d pull away and they could go back to enjoying their wine.</p><p>Another kiss. Then he\u2019d stop. Then he\u2019d pause long enough to clear his head.</p><p>But already his hands, which had been innocently stroking her back, had worked their way down her waist. He loved the feel of her, loved the gentle contours of her utterly feminine body. As their kissing went on, it was hard to keep from touching more and more of her.</p><p>It\u2019d been a long time since anything had felt so good.</p><p>\u201cNice,\u201d he whispered, reluctantly easing his mouth from hers. He could barely think, barely focus on anything but the woman in his arms.</p><p>\u201cVery nice,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>Their eyes held. Her hands remained on his shoulders and his stayed on her waist. \u201cAre you ready for dinner?\u201d</p><p>She gave him the softest smile. \u201cNo.\u201d Her voice was a mere wisp of sound.</p><p>\u201cMe, neither.\u201d He kissed her again, his mouth coaxing hers. Her lips were pliant, warm, moist. He didn\u2019t know how long they went on like that, lost in each other.</p><p>\u201cJulie, listen...\u201d Even to his own ears his voice was hoarse. He braced his forehead against hers.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m listening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re getting a little hot and heavy here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes...I\u2019d noticed.\u201d She kissed the side of his neck and shivers raced down his spine.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to be so agreeable.\u201d</p><p>He splayed his fingers through her hair, thinking that would bring her to her senses. In his experience, women didn\u2019t want their hair disheveled. Julie hardly seemed aware of it. He should have known....</p><p>He purposely pulled away, thinking that too much of a good thing would soon bore him. But he wasn\u2019t bored. In this, as in everything else, Julie had the opposite effect on him.</p><p>\u201cWe should have dinner now.\u201d With a superhuman effort he dropped his arms and took a step back. Julie reached for her wineglass and Roy saw that her hands trembled.</p><p>He spent a few moments regaining his composure in the kitchen. Dinner, a chicken dish\u2014he couldn\u2019t remember what the caterer had called it\u2014was warming in the oven. The salad sat on the top shelf of the refrigerator. Roy opened the door and stood directly in the blast of cold air with his eyes closed, hoping it would shock him into reality.</p><p>\u201cIt looks like the parade\u2019s about to start,\u201d Julie called from the other room.</p><p>Roy grinned. She was at the window again. \u201cI\u2019ll be a couple of minutes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t rush on my account.\u201d</p><p>The meal now seemed a necessary nuisance. The truth was, Roy had no appetite for anything but Julie. For days he\u2019d been conscious of how badly he wanted to kiss her, but he hadn\u2019t known what to expect once he did.</p><p>\u201cCan I do anything to help?\u201d Julie asked, coming into the kitchen. She sounded far more like herself.</p><p>\u201cNot a thing. All I have to do is bring these dishes into the dining room.\u201d He carried the salad out and set it on the table.</p><p>Julie walked over to the fireplace and once again her back was to him. \u201cYour home is lovely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you like a tour before we eat?\u201d</p><p>She turned around, then surprised him by shaking her head. \u201cI\u2019m afraid we might not make it out of the bedroom.\u201d</p><p>Roy had always found her honesty refreshing and never more than at that moment. He chuckled. \u201cI\u2019m feeling the same way myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...we haven\u2019t known each other long enough for that kind of commitment.\u201d</p><p>Now, that was a word Roy tended to avoid. Instead of commenting, he chose to ignore it. \u201cThe salad is served.\u201d He stood behind her chair and held it for her.</p><p>Once Julie was seated, he took his own place across from her; they both had a full view of the parade of Christmas ships as they sailed or motored past. Julie remarked every now and then on a certain theme or design. After a second glass of wine, she declined another.</p><p>Rejecting caution, Roy poured himself a third. He needed something to fortify him if he was going to battle temptation. And Julie tempted him, all right. It wasn\u2019t easy to admit that, since Roy was a man who enjoyed being in control. And yet all through dinner\u2014the chicken-and-mushroom dish, new potatoes and saut\u00e9ed spinach\u2014it wasn\u2019t the food so expertly prepared or even their conversation that engaged him. No, what was foremost in Roy\u2019s mind was the desire he felt for Julie. This weakness distressed him and yet...he hadn\u2019t felt so alive in years.</p><p>\u201cDessert?\u201d Julie asked.</p><p>The question startled Roy and he suddenly realized she\u2019d carried the dinner plates into the kitchen and returned with two dessert plates. Cheesecake, if he recalled correctly.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d For emphasis he shook his head. \u201cOn second thought...\u201d He caught her around the waist and pulled her onto his lap.</p><p>She set the plates on the table, her face near his. Her eyes, dark and intense, were wide and so very expressive. They told him she wanted to kiss him again. Her throat was flushed, her skin warm. If her feelings were this easy to decipher, he could only imagine what she could read in his face.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re supposed to be watching the ships, remember?\u201d Her voice trembled.</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>She sighed and asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s happening to us?\u201d</p><p>Roy knew, but he didn\u2019t like the answer any more than he welcomed the question. \u201cI don\u2019t think we need to figure that out just yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy head\u2019s spinning\u2014and it doesn\u2019t have anything to do with the wine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMine, too,\u201d he told her. The alcohol was only partially responsible for the dizziness he was feeling.</p><p>\u201cI...I saw a fish fly this afternoon,\u201d she whispered. Her mouth was close to his ear.</p><p>Roy frowned, not understanding.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s true,\u201d she said, her voice still low. \u201cI was at the Pike Place Market, and it seemed to leap off the crushed ice and fly of its own accord.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat isn\u2019t possible,\u201d Roy said impatiently. Either it was a trick of the eye or sleight of hand.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I thought,\u201d Julie told him. \u201cThen it happened again and someone else saw it, too.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMy guess is there\u2019s a reason you\u2019re telling me this.\u201d</p><p>In response, she kissed the side of his neck. \u201cThe way I feel now is the same way I felt earlier when I saw that fish fly. I didn\u2019t believe it, although I saw it with my own eyes. I felt a little ridiculous. And I wanted to deny it, pretend it hadn\u2019t happened. Then, as I said, someone else confirmed what I\u2019d seen and I realized I hadn\u2019t imagined it, after all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo...\u201d Perhaps it was the scent of her perfume that clogged his brain. But for the life of him, Roy didn\u2019t know what she was talking about or where this rather unusual story was taking him.</p><p>\u201cI left quickly because I had to get away to think about it.\u201d</p> <p>Ah, Roy was beginning to understand, and his hold on her tightened. \u201cYou want to leave?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI should.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if I asked you to stay?\u201d Now he was the one kissing her, dropping light kisses along the side of her neck, hoping to lure her into spending the night. They were both adults who knew what they wanted, and he wasn\u2019t interested in pretending otherwise.</p><p>Her answer was a long time in coming and held a pleading quality. \u201cDon\u2019t ask.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right.\u201d Difficult as it was, he relaxed his grip.</p> <p>She stood up from his lap and Roy immediately missed the closeness. He got to his feet, ready to protest when she retrieved her coat from the closet.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want you to go.\u201d</p><p>She smiled, walked over to where he stood and kissed him on the mouth. \u201cI don\u2019t want to go, either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen stay.\u201d He bit his tongue before he made the mistake of saying more. This decision had to be hers.</p><p>For just a moment, Roy thought he\u2019d succeeded, but then he watched a renewed determination settle over her. \u201cI can\u2019t. I just saw a fish fly through the air.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t know what it was about that stupid fish, but it appeared to have some significance for her.</p> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t quite believe what\u2019s happened,\u201d she said, \u201cbut I\u2019m afraid I\u2019m falling in love with you.\u201d</p><p>Love? Roy\u2019s heart fell. That was the last thing he wanted to hear.</p><p>Seventeen</p><p>Julie stepped back from the freshly cut Christmas tree her father had grudgingly set up in a corner of the living room. This was probably the most difficult part of the Christmas season for him.</p><p>And for her.</p><p>Her mother had particularly loved their little tree-trimming ceremony. Just a year ago, the three of them had decorated the tree together. Andy Williams\u2019s Christmas album had played in the background and the smell of popped corn had permeated the air.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s perfect,\u201d Julie announced.</p><p>Her father shrugged. \u201cIf you say so. I brought the decorations up from the basement.\u201d He studied the tree, and Julie had the feeling that if she hadn\u2019t made the effort this year, he\u2019d be willing to forgo Christmas altogether.</p> <p>\u201cDid you find the Christmas CDs?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d</p><p>Julie suspected he hadn\u2019t looked. They were no doubt packed away with the decorations.</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019ll see how the Huskies are doing.\u201d He picked up the remote. The University of Washington football team was her father\u2019s favorite.</p><p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t going to help decorate?\u201d Julie hated the thought of doing it all by herself, but she didn\u2019t want to force her father to participate. Lectures from her wouldn\u2019t do any good, as Emily\u2019s e-mail had reminded her that morning.</p><p>Her father\u2019s eyes grew sad. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Kitten, but I just don\u2019t have the heart for it this year.\u201d</p><p>He hardly ever called her Kitten, a name from her childhood, and she blinked away tears. After everything they\u2019d endured, Julie couldn\u2019t complain about his unwillingness to take part in an activity that brought back memories he might not be ready to face. \u201cThat\u2019s okay,\u201d she told him, although her heart was breaking. This was hard, so much harder than she\u2019d realized it would be.</p><p>\u201cI can do it,\u201d Julie said more to convince herself than her father. Maybe it wouldn\u2019t be as painful if he stayed in the room. \u201cYou can be my adviser.\u201d</p><p>He acquiesced with a reluctant nod. Settling down in his usual chair, he flipped through several channels, then found the Huskies game.</p><p>Humming \u201cDeck the Halls\u201d to herself, Julie located the string of lights and began to weave it around the base of the evergreen, working her way upward. This task had always been reserved for her father. Afterward, Julie and Emily\u2014before her twin sister\u2019s marriage\u2014along with their mother, took over the task of hanging the decorations. It had been an important tradition, representing a time of family fun, laughter and music. Now it seemed bleak and sad....</p><p>\u201cDid you check those lights before you started putting them on the tree?\u201d her father asked during the first commercial break.</p><p>\u201cUh...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can see that you didn\u2019t.\u201d He clambered out of his chair. \u201cOh, all right, I\u2019ll do the lights, but that\u2019s it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Dad!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI should\u2019ve known,\u201d he muttered. \u201cAll you wanted me to do was put up the tree, you said. Well, I did that. Next thing you know, I\u2019m stringing the lights. Are you plotting against me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould I do that?\u201d she asked in a singsong voice that didn\u2019t conceal her amusement.</p><p>Since there wasn\u2019t much she could do while he strung the lights, Julie went into the kitchen and put a package of popcorn in the microwave. It was cheating, she supposed; her mother had done it the old-fashioned way. Still, popcorn was popcorn.</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re going to be popping corn, I want the buttered kind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Dad.\u201d</p><p>He was almost finished with the lights by the time she returned to the living room, carrying a large bowl filled to overflowing with popcorn. She set it in the center of the coffee table and got down on all fours to sort through the boxes he\u2019d brought up from the basement. Pulling out the small stack of CDs held together by a rubber band, she placed it conspicuously beside the bowl.</p><p>\u201cOh, go ahead, then. Put one on.\u201d</p><p>She smiled and did exactly that, choosing a selection of instrumental Christmas classics.</p><p>Her father plugged in the lights. \u201cI\u2019ll probably be hanging the ornaments, too,\u201d he grumbled. He paused long enough to grab a handful of popcorn. \u201cDid I ever tell you about Christmas the first year your mother and I were married? We were too poor to afford a tree. A friend gave your mother a poinsettia, and we put our gifts under that.\u201d He smiled at the memory. \u201cIt was the most pitiful-looking thing, but you\u2019d have thought it was as grand as a fifteen-foot tree.\u201d</p><p>Of all the gifts Julie had received through the years, perhaps the best was the fact that her parents had loved each other deeply.</p><p>\u201cWhat I remember was all of us attending Christmas Eve services and then coming home and opening one gift each.\u201d Julie and Emily were eight years old before they realized that the one gift they were allowed to open always turned out to be pajamas.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to miss Mom\u2019s turkey stuffing,\u201d Julie said, sitting back on her heels. For both Thanksgiving and Christmas, her mother had prepared the traditional turkey. Every year she fretted over her stuffing and every year she outdid herself.</p><p>\u201cYours wasn\u2019t bad,\u201d her father assured her.</p><p>Like her mother, Julie had worried excessively over her first attempt at cooking the Thanksgiving turkey. \u201cThanks, Dad. I guess I must\u2019ve picked up something all those years I spent helping Mom.\u201d It felt good to be able to talk freely about her mother. Her father seemed to revel in it, too, although she knew he\u2019d felt wary about reliving the past. Sharing memories made missing her less painful, and Julie knew that these memories would get them through the Christmas season. There would be poignant, tearful moments, but happy ones, too.</p><p>\u201cAre you cooking a turkey for Christmas?\u201d her father asked.</p><p>Julie hadn\u2019t given the matter much thought. Christmas was still two weeks away, and it seemed a bit early to be thinking about what she\u2019d serve. \u201cI suppose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeems to me we had leftover turkey for at least a week after Thanksgiving.\u201d</p><p>Julie took out the ornaments, examining each one. \u201cWould you rather I made something else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no, I like my turkey. It just seems a waste to buy a big bird for the two of us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could find a smaller one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr...maybe we should invite a few guests.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGuests? Who?\u201d All their family was on the East Coast. Emily was in Florida, and longtime friends had their own families.</p><p>\u201cWhat about Roy and his mother?\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d led into that suggestion with such ease Julie hadn\u2019t seen it coming. For a moment, she was too surprised to respond.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d he asked, watching her.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d she said cautiously, \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>Her father brought the stepladder from the kitchen as he continued his task. \u201cI met Anne this week, and she\u2019s a sensible woman.\u201d</p><p>Julie had liked Roy\u2019s mother immensely\u2014and she\u2019d been given real insight into Anne\u2019s son. On Saturday evening, she\u2019d gone to his home with a new awareness of him, an appreciation for the man he was. Consequently her guard had been down. She\u2019d felt as if her heart would shatter with joy when he kissed her. More than that, she\u2019d sensed there could be a profound connection between them. But she had no way of knowing if Roy felt the same things she did. She believed he did, but that could be just wishful thinking.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not saying anything.\u201d Her father frowned at her over the top of his reading glasses as he stood on the stepladder by the tree.</p><p>\u201cThat might be nice, but I\u2019m not sure they\u2019ll accept.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt won\u2019t do any harm to ask.\u201d</p><p>She agreed. This suggestion was unlike her father\u2014but then it dawned on Julie that he might be saying something else. \u201cYou like Mrs. Fletcher, Dad?\u201d It was logical; after all, he was alone, and so was Roy\u2019s mother.</p><p>Her father paused, the string of lights dangling between his hands. \u201cI know what you\u2019re thinking, Julie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDad, Mrs. Fletcher is a wonderful woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know she is, but I want to make something clear right now, and this is important. Anne Fletcher could never interest me romantically. No woman could replace your mother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDad, I didn\u2019t mean\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you didn\u2019t,\u201d he said, cutting her off. \u201cBut it\u2019s best to tell you that I don\u2019t plan to remarry, ever. I loved your mother, and frankly, there\u2019s no room in my heart for anyone else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou might feel differently down the road. Mom wouldn\u2019t want you to be lonely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t be. I have every intention of working as long as I can and living a productive life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI certainly hope so,\u201d she teased.</p><p>\u201cBut I\u2019ll live the rest of my life alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat decision is yours.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI appreciate your understanding, Julie. At some point, you and your sister might feel inclined to match me up, but it\u2019s not what I want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, Dad.\u201d</p><p>He nodded, apparently relieved.</p><p>Julie scooped up a handful of popcorn and had just started to chew when her father glanced up again. \u201cYou were home earlier than I expected last night. Was everything okay between you and Roy?\u201d</p> <p>She swallowed quickly. \u201cIt went really well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you going out with him again?\u201d</p><p>Roy hadn\u2019t asked, but she\u2019d come to the conclusion that he would. \u201cI think so,\u201d and then she added, because it was true, \u201cI hope so. Does that bother you?\u201d</p><p>Her father grinned. \u201cIt\u2019s a little late to be asking me that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I suppose it is. I like him, Dad.\u201d</p> <p>Her father\u2019s grin broadened. \u201cI guessed as much. You\u2019ve been walking on air for the last few days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it that noticeable?\u201d</p><p>Her father chuckled and was about to say something else when the doorbell rang.</p><p>Julie stood, brushed off her jeans and hurried to the door. Roy Fletcher stood on the other side. She felt a surge of joy at the sight of him.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d he said a bit sheepishly.</p><p>\u201cHi, yourself.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDoing anything special?\u201d</p><p>She nodded and reached for his hand, pulling him into the foyer. \u201cWant to help?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d He wrapped his arms around her waist. Nuzzling her neck with his cold nose, he whispered, \u201cI woke up this morning and realized I missed you. By the way\u2014\u201d he dropped a kiss on her forehead \u201c\u2014I bought tickets for a Christmas concert, if you\u2019re interested.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d love it.\u201d Happy chills raced down Julie\u2019s back and she sighed as he kissed her jaw, moving toward her lips. They were deeply involved in a kiss when Julie heard her father behind her.</p><p>\u201cYup,\u201d he said gleefully. \u201cI\u2019d say my Julie likes Mr. Roy Fletcher.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d say she does, too,\u201d Mercy shouted, and exchanged a high five with Goodness. \u201cJust look at the two of them.\u201d</p><p>Frowning, Shirley stood back, arms crossed. \u201cIt was too easy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Mercy demanded. \u201cI don\u2019t know about you, but I\u2019ve been working hard to bring these two humans together. And I think I did a very good job.\u201d</p> <p>Shirley shook her head. \u201cThere\u2019s trouble in the making, I can feel it. I\u2019m telling you something\u2019s going to happen that none of us will like.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, don\u2019t go looking for it,\u201d Goodness warned.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not,\u201d the oldest of the trio insisted, \u201cbut I can sense it coming.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t say that,\u201d Mercy cried, covering both ears. \u201cRoy and Julie are perfect together. They\u2019re falling in love, exactly like we planned.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish I could agree,\u201d Shirley said. \u201cBut experience tells me it was too easy. Mark my words, they\u2019re about to hit a major snag.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re just upset about that salmon,\u201d Mercy pouted.</p><p>Goodness wasn\u2019t thrilled about the fish free-for-all in Pike Place Market, but any chastisement would only encourage Mercy to misbehave. After Julie and Anne had left, Mercy had gone amok. Fish had been flying in all directions. Staff and customers were shouting and shrieking; chaos was rampant. It\u2019d taken both Shirley and Goodness to get her out of the fish market.</p><p>\u201cWhat could go wrong?\u201d Goodness asked.</p><p>\u201cYes, just look at them,\u201d Mercy said. Roy and Julie had started to place the ornaments on the tree. Between each carefully hung bauble, they\u2019d pause and exchange kisses and munch popcorn. \u201cHe\u2019s even telling her about Christmases he had as a boy. We all know he doesn\u2019t often talk about his parents.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpeaking of parents,\u201d Goodness said, glancing around. \u201cWhere\u2019s Dean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe made an excuse to leave and give them privacy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s very considerate.\u201d</p><p>Shirley continued to frown. \u201cI wish I had a better feeling about all of this.\u201d</p><p>So did Goodness, but she\u2019d come to respect her friend\u2019s premonitions. She could only wonder what would happen next.</p><p>Eighteen</p><p>It was beginning to look and feel like Christmas, Anne thought as she walked out to her rural mailbox. The neighbors, whose house could barely be seen in the distance, had strung a multicolored strand of outside lights along their roofline. A six-foot-tall Frosty the Snowman stood forlornly in their front yard. Snow was a rare commodity in the Pacific Northwest, and a fake snowman was all there was likely to be.</p><p>As Anne strolled back up the meandering driveway that led to her cottage, she browsed through the assortment of holiday cards, bills and sale flyers. She\u2019d been so busy with her artwork and traveling into Seattle that the mail had sat forgotten in her box for three days. Pouring herself a cup of tea, she settled at the small round table in her cozy kitchen and opened the top envelope.</p><p>It was clearly a Christmas card, an expensive one, judging by the large vellum envelope. Anne opened it and slid out the card. The scene was of snow and geese and a decorated Christmas tree in the middle of a pristine meadow. Curious now, she looked inside and gasped as she read the embossed name. A sharp pain slashed through her and she held her breath, closing her eyes at such blatant cruelty.</p><p>Burton and Aimee Fletcher</p><p>This Christmas card was obviously Burton\u2019s way of reminding Anne of what he\u2019d done to her. Not that she needed reminders...She didn\u2019t know why her ex-husband hated her so much. Perhaps it was because, thanks to Aimee and the divorce, Burton had lost his son. Was he blaming her for that?</p><p>Refusing to dwell on the reasons for such unkindness, she tossed the card aside and reached for the rest of her mail. Her hands shook as she struggled to regain her composure. How sad that five years after their divorce, her ex-husband was still trying to upset her. Well, Anne wasn\u2019t going to let him. Then it occurred to her that perhaps it hadn\u2019t been Burton at all, but Aimee. If so, Anne couldn\u2019t begin to figure out why the other woman would want to hurt her.</p><p>Although she tried not to let the Christmas card bother her, Anne couldn\u2019t stop thinking about it. The fact that she hadn\u2019t recognized the return address told her Burton and Aimee had moved from the oceanfront home Anne had loved so much. She could just imagine the new house. No expense would have been spared; Burton was all too willing to spend his money on Aimee. It thrilled him to have a beautiful young woman on his arm. A woman dressed in designer clothes, wearing lavish jewelry that spoke of her husband\u2019s success. He\u2019d done exceptionally well over the years. Twice now, she\u2019d heard his name in conjunction with famous Hollywood stars and their very public divorces.</p><p>The phone rang. Anne wasn\u2019t in the mood to talk, and decided to let the answering machine pick up. Out of curiosity, she glanced at caller ID. When she saw it was Marta\u2019s New York number, she jerked up the receiver.</p><p>Anne had been waiting anxiously ever since their last conversation. The temptation to contact her had been almost overwhelming, but she hadn\u2019t given in. If Marta had sold the angel painting\u2014or wanted to discuss her marriage\u2014she would\u2019ve called.</p><p>\u201cHi, Marta,\u201d Anne said, rushing her words together.</p><p>\u201cMerry Christmas, Anne.\u201d</p><p>Anne so wanted this to be good news. She needed it after that dreadful Christmas card.</p><p>\u201cHow are you?\u201d Anne asked.</p><p>Marta hesitated. \u201cOkay, I think. Do you have a few minutes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I do.\u201d From the tone of her friend\u2019s voice Anne suspected the call had to do with Marta\u2019s husband and not the painting.</p><p>Marta sighed, a despairing sound. \u201cI confronted Jack. I tried to follow your advice and casually mention that I knew about the affair. Unfortunately it didn\u2019t work. I came unglued.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Anne asked softly.</p><p>\u201cYou suggested I simply tell Jack I knew what he was doing and that I was protecting myself financially. That seemed so reasonable at the time, and I thought I could do it. I really did. But when the moment came, I burst into tears and called him every foul name in the book. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever been so angry. I\u2019ve never been one to say those kinds of things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is your life and your marriage, and your heart\u2019s breaking.\u201d Anne had struggled with this same vicious anger herself. Her self-esteem had been destroyed; she\u2019d come to the end of her composure, no longer the complacent wife. Her self-recrimination had been as bitter as her resentment and her fury.</p><p>\u201cI had no idea I was so furious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t, either, when it happened to me,\u201d Anne consoled her. She hadn\u2019t turned on Burton, though. Instead, she\u2019d wept until there were no more tears left and all that remained was her anger.</p><p>\u201cOn the other hand,\u201d Marta said with strained cheerfulness, \u201cI took your advice and had everything planned before I spoke to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI saw an attorney and had our joint assets frozen right away.\u201d</p><p>Anne approved. \u201cThat was smart\u2014and practical.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy attorney advised me to wait a week until he had everything in place. Then Jack came home smelling of her perfume and I went ballistic.\u201d</p><p>This was so unlike Marta that Anne could scarcely picture her friend in that kind of state. \u201cHow did he react?\u201d</p><p>Marta\u2019s laugh was short. \u201cOf course he denied everything.\u201d</p><p>Just like Burton had, accusing Anne of having a filthy mind, of being insecure and ridiculous. In the beginning, she\u2019d felt dreadful for suspecting such terrible things about her husband. Burton had insisted on an apology and in her innocence, Anne had given him one. Her face burned with mortification at the memory.</p><p>\u201cBurton denied everything, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I told him about seeing an attorney,\u201d Marta said, her voice quavering, \u201cand...and then I threw him out.\u201d</p><p>In every likelihood, Jack had immediately gone to the other woman, but Anne didn\u2019t mention that.</p><p>\u201cHe...he didn\u2019t want to leave. He kept trying to reason with me but I wouldn\u2019t listen. He said I was imagining things\u2014and this is the crazy part\u2014for a moment I actually believed him. Here he was, hours late, smelling of perfume and denying everything, and because I so badly wanted to believe him, I...I almost did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course you wanted to believe him. Jack\u2019s your husband.\u201d</p><p>Marta paused. \u201cThat first night was so dreadful. Jack called the apartment ten times. I wouldn\u2019t answer the phone and he left messages for me, pleading with me to hear him out.\u201d She released a soft hiccuping sob.</p><p>\u201cWhen was that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThree days ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long has it been since you talked to him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSince that night...I just can\u2019t. I thought maybe I\u2019d blown everything out of proportion and, Anne, I\u2019m no longer sure what to believe. I know he\u2019s involved with someone else, but I so desperately want him back that I\u2019ve decided I can\u2019t trust my own feelings. If I talk to him, I\u2019m afraid he\u2019ll manage to convince me that this is all nonsense and I\u2019ll take him back.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat are you going to do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight now, nothing.

You\u2019re the only person I\u2019d admit this to, but I\u2019m paying a man outrageous fees to follow my husband around and photograph him with another woman. Is that sick or what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Marta. Of course it isn\u2019t. A detective might be the only means you have of learning the truth.\u201d Early on, before the breakup of her own marriage, Anne had considered the same thing. In retrospect she wished she\u2019d done it. Photographic evidence might have opened her eyes to what Burton was doing.</p><p>\u201cAll I want is for this to go away. I think now I should\u2019ve waited until after Christmas, but, Anne, I couldn\u2019t. I couldn\u2019t endure this for another second. I couldn\u2019t pretend and look the other way anymore.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry, Marta,\u201d Anne told her friend. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have wished this on you for anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Anne, I don\u2019t know what to do. Christmas is only a week away. I can\u2019t deal with this and the holidays, too. What am I going to tell our friends? How can I possibly face everyone?\u201d The questions came between deep sobs.</p><p>\u201cOh, Marta, I\u2019m so sorry,\u201d she said again.</p><p>\u201cWhy is this happening to me?\u201d</p><p>Anne had asked herself the same question hundreds of times. \u201cWould you like to fly out to Seattle? Stay with me and take a few days to collect your thoughts. Let your attorney know you\u2019re coming and just get on a plane.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe you\u2019d do that for me,\u201d Marta said, and continued to sob.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve walked in your shoes. I know how hard this is. What do you want to do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you mind terribly coming to New York? I\u2019d pay for your ticket. I just need someone with me\u2014someone who understands.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I wouldn\u2019t mind! I\u2019ll check on flights the minute we get off the phone.\u201d Roy wouldn\u2019t care; Anne was sure of that. Her son would be just as happy to spend Christmas Day at Julie\u2019s. With Anne in New York, he\u2019d be free to do so.</p><p>\u201cThank you. Oh, thank you, Anne. I\u2019d fly out and join you, but I don\u2019t want to leave. There\u2019s no telling what Jack would do if I were to vacate the house.\u201d</p><p>Naturally her friend was right. \u201cThat\u2019s fine, Marta. I\u2019ll come to New York for Christmas and be your moral support.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThank you,\u201d her friend whispered again. \u201cI don\u2019t know how I\u2019d cope if it wasn\u2019t for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll have a wonderful Christmas,\u201d Anne tried to assure her, although she knew what Marta was experiencing. The pain and shock...</p><p>\u201cOh, Anne, I\u2019m just shocked that Jack would be so stupid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe might come to his senses yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not counting on it,\u201d Marta said. \u201cHe seemed so sincere, so horrified. He kept insisting I was wrong. I never knew he was capable of such lies.\u201d</p><p>It hurt just to listen to her friend\u2019s agony. Anne didn\u2019t have the heart to tell her that the pain, even when dulled by time, had a way of resurfacing when you least expected it. Anne had felt its sting only moments earlier when she\u2019d opened her mail.</p><p>Marta grew quiet, as if she was composing herself. She took a deep, audible breath. \u201cI\u2019ve been so caught up in my own troubles I forgot to mention what\u2019s been going on with your painting.\u201d</p><p>Although she was dying to know, Anne was prepared to put it off. \u201cThat\u2019s not important now.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut it is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid Mrs. Gould decide against it?\u201d Anne asked. She\u2019d never been comfortable with letting the buyer assume she had no intention of selling her angel.</p><p>\u201cNo, she\u2019s more interested than ever, but now there\u2019s another prospective buyer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s wonderful,\u201d Anne said excitedly.</p><p>\u201cThis one claims she\u2019ll match or beat anything Mrs. Gould offers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you saying that two customers have gotten into a bidding war?\u201d Anne was almost afraid to guess what this could mean financially.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s exactly what I\u2019m saying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow...how much?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure you want to know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d she cried. \u201cTell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, first of all,\u201d Marta teased, \u201cI\u2019m not positive the artist\u2019s willing to sell it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Marta.\u201d Anne couldn\u2019t help it; she giggled.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s an incredible painting, and everyone who sees it is drawn to it. Your angel has become the most talked-about piece in our gallery. She\u2019s aroused more interest than anything else on display, and of course, the fact that it\u2019s December is a plus. You couldn\u2019t have painted her at a more appropriate time.\u201d</p><p>Anne\u2019s heart swelled with pride. \u201cOh, you\u2019re making me feel so good!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what the painting does, you know. People look at your angel and they feel better about life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHas she helped you?\u201d Anne asked.</p><p>\u201cOh, yes,\u201d Marta replied. \u201cI don\u2019t know what it is, but there\u2019s a soothing quality about your angel. It\u2019s...almost as if I were standing close to God.\u201d</p><p>Anne regretted having given the angel up so quickly. Even now, she didn\u2019t know if she\u2019d imagined the vision or it had actually happened. She chose to believe the angel had been real, but who was to know?</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t tell me you\u2019re having second thoughts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...I\u2019m not sure,\u201d Anne admitted.</p><p>\u201cWell, let me know before I make a deal.\u201d</p><p>While Anne loved the angel, ten thousand dollars or more for one of her pieces would go a long way toward establishing her credibility in the art world\u2014and paying her mortgage.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been offered twenty-five thousand for it,\u201d Marta announced.</p><p>Anne felt faint. \u201cHow much?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou heard me right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014I can\u2019t believe it! You\u2019ve got to be making this up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, and the bid is climbing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMarta, I have no idea what to say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust call and tell me when your flight\u2019s coming in and I\u2019ll be there to pick you up, check in hand. We do want to sell this painting, don\u2019t we?\u201d</p><p>Because she knew it was the right thing, Anne said, \u201cYes, we do.\u201d Burton would probably never hear about her success, but that didn\u2019t matter. Anne Fletcher was an artist and an unusual one at that. She could support herself with what she made on her paintings.</p><p>Nineteen</p><p>Roy caught himself whistling as he dressed for work Monday morning. He took a long look at himself in the mirror and saw something he hadn\u2019t seen in years. Happiness. It had sneaked up on him and could only be attributed to his relationship with Julie. He liked the way she made him feel, the way she challenged him and made him laugh. He liked her warmth and honesty. He\u2019d discovered that he wanted to be with her more and more\u2014all the time, in fact. And this had happened in only a few weeks. He often found himself impatient when they were apart, eager to be with her again. Suddenly he wanted\u2014no, needed\u2014to hear the sound of her voice.</p><p>Without further thought he picked up the phone.</p><p>Julie answered on the second ring.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d he asked, keeping his voice low.</p><p>\u201cRoy, it\u2019s six o\u2019clock in the morning. I\u2019m getting ready for school. What do you suppose I\u2019m doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was hoping you were thinking of me.\u201d He straddled a kitchen chair, grabbing his coffee mug. The best Colombian coffee and conversation with Julie\u2014not a bad way to start his day.</p><p>\u201cI was thinking of you,\u201d she admitted reluctantly.</p><p>\u201cWill you have dinner with me tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got a game.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfter the game?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d love to.\u201d</p><p>His heart soared at her excitement. Then again, it could be an echo of his own joy. He shook his head. This was crazy. He knew better than to let himself be swayed by feelings, especially feelings for a woman. Hadn\u2019t he learned that by now? Yet here he was, falling head over heels for Julie and he was doing it with his eyes wide open. A rational voice in his mind urged him to resist before he made another costly mistake. But a louder and more persistent voice promised him Julie was different....</p><p>\u201cWhere do you want to go?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cDo we have to go anywhere?\u201d she asked. \u201cDad\u2019s meeting some friends tonight. I can cook.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfter teaching all day and coaching a soccer game, you won\u2019t feel like cooking. Let me take you out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNonsense. I\u2019ll start a stew in the Crock-Pot and it\u2019ll be ready when I get home from school.\u201d</p><p>Roy hadn\u2019t had regular home-cooked meals since he was a teenager. His mother, no matter how busy she was, had insisted on dinners together as a family. More often than not, his father had business to attend to, but Roy had always eaten with his mother, at least until he left for college in Seattle.</p><p>\u201cUnless you don\u2019t want stew? I just thought it was a great wintertime meal and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour stew\u2019s wonderful,\u201d he assured her. She could serve dill pickles and he wouldn\u2019t have cared. All Roy wanted was to spend time with Julie. He had no idea where this was going and for the moment contented himself with the thrill of the ride.</p><p>They agreed to meet at her house at seven. Roy found himself watching the clock all day. The morning seemed to crawl by, and his mind wasn\u2019t on his various meetings or the decisions he had to make. Even Ms. Johnson commented.</p><p>Roy brushed away her concern. He didn\u2019t admit it was Julie Wilcoff who occupied his thoughts, but he suspected Ms. Johnson had guessed as much.</p><p>That evening, at one minute to seven, Roy stood on Julie\u2019s front porch, clutching a bottle of excellent wine, and rang the doorbell. She answered immediately, her hair still wet from the shower. She\u2019d combed it away from her face, and he noticed again how lovely she was, even without makeup. Her skin was smooth and healthy, her eyes bright, and her lips, with only the slightest color, looked as if they ached to be kissed. He knew he ached to kiss her. She wore slacks and a green sweater, and just seeing her turned his blood to steam. This was what he\u2019d been fantasizing about all day, what he\u2019d wanted from the moment he\u2019d climbed out of bed that morning.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right on time,\u201d she said, reaching for his free hand. With a slight tug she brought him into the house.</p><p>Roy saw that he\u2019d been standing on the porch like a schoolboy, simply staring at her. He knew he should wait before he kissed her, but he couldn\u2019t stop himself. He set the wine on a hallway table crowded with gloves and unopened mail and, without removing his coat, brought her into his arms.</p><p>Julie went to him willingly and when their lips met, it was the first time that day he\u2019d felt completely relaxed. She melted against him and he felt the soft fullness of her breasts against his chest. His head swam. The sensation their kisses evoked in him nearly sent him over the edge. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>After several minutes, Julie pulled her mouth from his. \u201cI...I\u2019ve got bread under the broiler.\u201d</p><p>Only then did Roy smell the burning bread. He released her and, because his knees felt weak, walked into the living room and sat down. Shrugging off his coat, he struggled to regain his equilibrium. A minute later, he carried his overcoat to the hall closet and collected the wine, which he placed on the coffee table.</p><p>Julie returned just as he sat down again. \u201cThankfully I picked up two loaves,\u201d she said. Offering him a shy smile, she started to walk past him to the chair opposite his.</p><p>Roy grabbed her hand, weaving his fingers through hers. \u201cI want to talk.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAll right.\u201d Her dark eyes were solemn.</p><p>He drew her into his lap and resumed the kissing they\u2019d begun in the hallway. Cradling her, he slipped his hand beneath her sweater and groaned as he encountered her breasts. His kisses turned greedy and urgent and\u2014</p><p>A loud ding startled him and he broke off the kiss.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the oven timer,\u201d Julie explained, and gazed at him, her eyes warm. \u201cDon\u2019t let it interrupt you.\u201d She frowned playfully. \u201cOn the other hand, I don\u2019t want to burn my last loaf of bread.\u201d She slid off his lap and hurried to the kitchen. \u201cHold that kiss\u2014I mean thought,\u201d she called over her shoulder.</p><p>Roy grinned when she came back and returned to her position on his lap. \u201cI was serious about wanting to talk,\u201d he said after a quick kiss.</p> <p>\u201cI can see that,\u201d she teased.</p><p>\u201cThe problem is, you\u2019re way too tempting.\u201d</p><p>She rolled her eyes, but the smile didn\u2019t leave her lips. \u201cWhat do you want to talk about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t think when we\u2019re this close.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you like me to move?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo...yes.\u201d</p> <p>She slid off his lap a second time and sat on the sofa across from him.</p><p>\u201cHow long do you intend to live with your father?\u201d he asked, leaning forward.</p><p>The question appeared to surprise her. \u201cI...I was thinking of renting an apartment after the first of the year.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d he said.</p><p>Her eyes narrowed. \u201cWhy not? Dad needs to make his own life now and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMove in with me.\u201d He hadn\u2019t broached the subject with much finesse, but he saw no reason to wait.</p><p>Julie didn\u2019t answer and her silence unnerved him.</p><p>\u201cI take it you\u2019re not looking for a roommate to share expenses,\u201d she finally said in what was presumably an effort at humor.</p> <p>\u201cWe both know what I\u2019m asking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes...well.\u201d She took a breath and then slowly exhaled. \u201cWe...only met a few weeks ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe know how we feel\u2014what we want.\u201d</p><p>She lowered her gaze rather than confess the truth.</p><p>\u201cJulie,\u201d he said, \u201cwe\u2019re adults.\u201d</p><p>Slowly she raised her eyes to meet his, and he read her indecision. Hoping to persuade her, he stood up and crossed to the sofa, sitting beside her. Clasping Julie\u2019s hands, he brushed his mouth over hers. \u201cWe\u2019d be good together,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>\u201cI think so, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why the hesitation?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head.</p><p>\u201cCome on,\u201d he urged. \u201cTell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d hate to disappoint my father\u2014I don\u2019t know how he\u2019d feel about this.\u201d</p><p>Roy wanted to remind her that she was thirty years old and fully capable of making decisions without consulting her father. In any event, based on what he knew of Dean Wilcoff, the man wouldn\u2019t stand in their way.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid he\u2019d do something rash,\u201d Julie said.</p><p>\u201cLike what?\u201d Roy couldn\u2019t imagine him doing any such thing. Dean was a sensible man. He wouldn\u2019t intrude on his daughter\u2019s life. He\u2019d accept whatever Julie wanted and keep his mouth shut\u2014as he should.</p><p>\u201cHe wouldn\u2019t approve.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d she continued, \u201cI suspect he\u2019d quit his job.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat decision is his, don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she agreed after a lengthy pause. \u201cBut he needs this job and for more than the money. It\u2019s been wonderful for him, Roy. I\u2019m so grateful you gave Dad a chance to feel productive again. It\u2019s been exactly what he needed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeave your father to me,\u201d he told her. Roy would square the situation with Dean and make sure he had no objections.</p><p>Still Julie hesitated.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need to decide right this minute. Take a few days, think it over. I\u2019m not going to withdraw the offer.\u201d</p><p>A tremulous smile lifted the corners of her mouth. Roy was disappointed by her lack of excitement, although he wouldn\u2019t admit it. He\u2019d hoped Julie would show as much enthusiasm for his idea as he felt himself.</p><p>Then it hit him. Naturally she was hesitant. She wanted it all, especially that ring on her finger, before she moved in with him.</p><p>\u201cYou want me to marry you first, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the way it\u2019s generally done,\u201d she said. \u201cSo...yes, I guess I do.\u201d</p><p>He appreciated her honesty and felt he couldn\u2019t be any less honest with her. \u201cSorry, Julie, it isn\u2019t going to happen. I\u2019m not interested in marriage.\u201d</p><p>She took the news easily enough.</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d she said, her voice just a bit unsteady. \u201cBut what are you offering me?\u201d</p><p>Roy shrugged. \u201cI\u2019m offering you a place in my life and in my home. I\u2019ll be generous and attentive.\u201d He couldn\u2019t think of anything else she\u2019d want. Although he hadn\u2019t spelled it out, he intended to give her all the things women craved. She could buy whatever she wanted: jewels, clothes, cars. It was up to her.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t doubt that you\u2019d be good to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what\u2019s the problem?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor how long?\u201d</p><p>His patience was slipping. \u201cYou want guarantees?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSix weeks? Three months? A year?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow am I supposed to know? For however long the two of us last.\u201d That should satisfy her. The way he felt just then, it could be a very long time, but she was right\u2014maybe it wouldn\u2019t. Who could tell?</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve done contracts with other businesses, haven\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Roy had the feeling she was thinking out loud. \u201cYes\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were ready to make a commitment to them, weren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you aren\u2019t willing to make a commitment to me.\u201d</p><p>Ah, he was beginning to understand. \u201cI can break a contract for a price. Is that what you\u2019re talking about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you suggesting payment?\u201d</p><p>He should have wised up by now, but she\u2019d had him fooled. Still, he didn\u2019t care. He was a man accustomed to paying for what he wanted. At the moment that was Julie, and he wanted her badly.</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d he said. \u201cWe can draw up a financial agreement.\u201d</p><p>She pulled her hands free of his. \u201cThat wasn\u2019t what I meant. I don\u2019t think you realize how insulting that is, Roy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cInsulting? I thought it was what you wanted. Okay,\u201d he said, doing his best to figure her out. \u201cJust tell me what it would take\u2014other than marrying you\u2014to get you to move in with me.\u201d He couldn\u2019t make it any plainer than that. Aimee had moved in without a moment\u2019s hesitation. He couldn\u2019t understand why Julie needed all this discussion.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know...I want to think this through.\u201d As if in a daze, she stood and walked slowly back to the kitchen.</p><p>Roy followed her. This night wasn\u2019t going the way he\u2019d anticipated. He\u2019d never been much good with relationships, and his experience with Aimee hadn\u2019t helped.</p><p>\u201cWhat about love?\u201d she asked, suddenly turning around.</p><p>Roy had come to detest the word. He didn\u2019t know what it was anymore. \u201cJulie, you\u2019re searching for an excuse, and I\u2019m not going to give it to you. You\u2019re looking for ways to talk yourself out of something we both want. This would be an agreement between two mature people who are strongly attracted to each other. Nothing more and nothing less.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about your mother?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about her? She\u2019d be thrilled. She\u2019s been saying for a long time that I work too hard, and she\u2019s right. Knowing her, she\u2019ll kiss you on both cheeks and thank you.\u201d</p><p>Julie didn\u2019t seem to believe him.</p><p>\u201cIf it\u2019s any consolation, you should know I\u2019ve only had one other woman live with me.\u201d Aimee. And whatever happened with Julie, it couldn\u2019t possibly end as badly as that relationship.</p><p>Taking two bowls and two wineglasses from the cupboard, Julie set them on the counter. \u201cI want to think this through,\u201d she said again. She gave him a weak smile. \u201cLike you said, this offer is good for more than twenty-four hours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake all the time you need.\u201d But he wanted her in his home and in his bed. The sooner the better.</p><p>Twenty</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know about anyone else,\u201d Goodness said, still in a huff, pacing inside Roy\u2019s office. \u201cBut I\u2019m outraged.\u201d She fluttered her wings so her friends would know she wasn\u2019t kidding.</p><p>Papers slid off Roy\u2019s desk and he looked up, clearly puzzled by the sudden draft.</p><p>\u201cRoy\u2019s a man,\u201d Mercy chided her, far too willing to overlook his weaknesses. \u201cWhat do you expect?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019m an angel,\u201d Goodness said right back. \u201cWhat do you expect?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThese are human matters,\u201d Shirley insisted, lurking behind Roy\u2019s chair. \u201cWe can\u2019t interfere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJulie knows better. Mark my words\u2014she\u2019ll refuse to do it.\u201d</p><p>Mercy sighed and sat on the corner of Roy\u2019s fancy desk, protecting his files from further disruption. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be so sure if I were you. She\u2019s tempted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen we\u2019ll untempt her.\u201d</p><p>Shirley shook her head. \u201cThat\u2019s not our department. They send in the Warrior Angels to deal with temptations.\u201d</p><p>True, but Goodness had intense feelings when it came to the humans involved in her prayer requests. Shirley, Goodness and Mercy had worked hard to bring these two together. She no longer felt any uncertainty about their choice; Julie was the woman Anne had prayed for. After all their efforts, the least Roy could do was marry her! Time was running out. They had to think of something quickly if he was going to propose by Christmas Eve. After that, they were off the case. Oh, dear, this could turn into a real disaster and of course Gabriel would blame the three of them.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got to make Julie see sense,\u201d Goodness said urgently. If Mercy was right, then Julie might indeed give in to temptation. The prayer request was ambiguous; Anne hadn\u2019t stated that Roy needed to marry this woman, although it was implied.</p><p>\u201cHe hasn\u2019t heard from her in two days.\u201d Mercy flipped the pages of Roy\u2019s desktop calendar.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t do that,\u201d Goodness cried, slapping Mercy\u2019s hand. \u201cHe might see you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Mercy tilted her head and stared at Roy Fletcher. \u201cHe\u2019s deep in thought.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s wondering how long it\u2019ll take to hear from Julie,\u201d Shirley suggested. \u201cHe\u2019s growing impatient.\u201d</p><p>Goodness had noticed that, but she also knew he\u2019d made no effort to get in touch with Julie. She suspected this was a ploy on his part\u2014his way of telling Julie that if she chose to reject his offer, she wouldn\u2019t be hearing from him again. That was just plain wrong! Goodness intended to do everything within her power to make sure Roy\u2019s head was filled with thoughts of Julie every minute of every day. The man would be sorry he\u2019d messed with the angels\u2019 plans to answer his mother\u2019s prayer.</p><p>\u201cYou know how cold he can be,\u201d Shirley commented, studying Roy intently. She shivered and wrapped her arms around herself.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s all an act,\u201d Goodness told them. \u201cHe loves his mother and Julie, only he\u2019s too stubborn to admit it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI say we get in there and do something,\u201d Mercy proclaimed.</p><p>\u201cLike what?\u201d Goodness was almost afraid to ask.</p><p>\u201cWhat we always do.\u201d Mercy folded her hands prayerfully and fluttered her long, curly eyelashes.</p><p>\u201cHeaven help us,\u201d Goodness muttered.</p> <p>\u201cNo, you\u2019ve got it all wrong,\u201d Mercy said. \u201cWe\u2019re the ones helping Heaven. Gabriel needs us. Otherwise, we\u2019d be long gone by now. I for one feel that drastic times call for drastic measures.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDrastic measures,\u201d Goodness repeated. \u201cWhat\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cStand back everyone.\u201d Mercy threw open her wings.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s she going to do?\u201d Goodness asked Shirley. \u201cToss a fish at him?\u201d</p><p>Shirley giggled.</p><p>Just when Mercy was getting ready to make her move, Ms. Johnson entered Roy\u2019s office. The three angels glided out of the way as his assistant handed him a sheaf of papers that required his signature.</p> <p>\u201cMs. Johnson,\u201d he said as the woman was about to leave, \u201cwould you mind if I asked you a couple of questions?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre they personal questions?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot exactly personal. Didn\u2019t you tell me you have a daughter in her twenties?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do. Janice. She recently turned twenty-three. What makes you ask?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was just wondering if\u2014\u201d He was interrupted by someone knocking on the partially opened door.</p><p>Shirley gasped.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s that?\u201d Goodness wanted to know.</p><p>\u201cI think it might be Aimee,\u201d Mercy told her in a hushed whisper.</p> <p>Indeed it was. The woman who\u2019d dumped Roy for his father. She stepped into the office wearing a full-length mink coat and high-heel shoes. She was sleek, petite and very blond. They didn\u2019t call it platinum blond for nothing, Goodness thought spitefully.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s she doing here?\u201d No one answered, and Goodness suspected her friends were as surprised as Roy obviously was.</p><p>He slowly stood. \u201cThat will be all, Ms. Johnson.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir.\u201d His assistant hurried out of the room.</p><p>\u201cHello, Roy.\u201d Aimee smiled seductively and walked up to his desk. \u201cIt\u2019s good to see you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did you get into the building?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I have my ways.\u201d</p><p>Roy snickered. \u201cI\u2019ll just bet you do.\u201d He made a mental note to talk to Dean Wilcoff about this.</p><p>\u201cI think it\u2019s time we talked, don\u2019t you?\u201d Without waiting for an invitation, she sat down and crossed her shapely legs.</p><p>Roy remained standing. \u201cActually, I think it\u2019s time you left.\u201d</p><p>Aimee sighed. \u201cThere\u2019s no need to be nasty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mean it, Aimee.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head, her long, blond hair swinging softly from side to side. \u201cRoy, this is ridiculous! You refuse to have anything to do with your father\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have nothing to say to him or to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s sad, because we both want to reconcile with you.\u201d</p><p>His gaze narrowed. \u201cI don\u2019t think I can bring myself to call you Mother.\u201d</p><p>She laughed, shrugging off his sarcasm. \u201cI don\u2019t think you should. Tell me, how are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. Now leave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve come all this way, and I\u2019m not going until you talk to me.\u201d</p><p>Roy lowered himself stiffly into his chair. \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d</p><p>Aimee\u2019s expression became petulant. \u201cI always hated it when you used that tone of voice with me.\u201d As if she suddenly felt hot, she unfastened the buttons of her coat and slipped her arms free.</p><p>Roy stared at the mink and at the silk suit beneath, set off by a stunning emerald brooch. \u201cI see Daddy\u2019s buying you lots of gifts.\u201d</p><p>Aimee raised one elegant shoulder. \u201cYou might not believe this, but I happen to love your father.\u201d</p><p>Roy raised his eyes to the ceiling. \u201cYeah, and I\u2019ll bet you love his bank balance even more.\u201d He\u2019d understood long ago that Aimee had set her sights on his father from the beginning of their so-called relationship. He\u2019d been used, and it wasn\u2019t going to happen again.</p><p>Her lips thinned. \u201cYou can insult me all you want, but I will not take offense. I came because I want to build a bridge between you and your father.\u201d</p><p>Roy laughed outright. \u201cThe woman who blew up the bridge now wants to build one? I find that interesting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s true, Roy. It\u2019s been five years. Your father and I have a very good life, but he misses you.\u201d She pouted ever so slightly.</p><p>\u201cWhy am I having trouble believing that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s true,\u201d Aimee said a second time, even more insistently. \u201cTalk to your father, okay? It\u2019s what he wants. Me, too. I\u2019d like us all to be friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like world peace myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBurton\u2019s your father!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe made his choice and I\u2019ve made mine.\u201d</p><p>Aimee reached for her purse and removed a gold cigarette case. \u201cDo you mind if I smoke?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you quit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am quitting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were quitting five years ago.\u201d</p><p>She tapped the cigarette against the case, then inserted it between her lips. \u201cIt isn\u2019t easy,\u201d she muttered.</p><p>\u201cSorry, there\u2019s a no-smoking law.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever.\u201d She returned the cigarette to the case, which she thrust back in her purse.</p><p>\u201cJust finish saying what you came to say and get out.\u201d</p><p>She looked hurt. \u201cBurton wants to see you.\u201d</p><p>Roy didn\u2019t consider the request. \u201cWhat for?\u201d he asked scornfully.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re his son. He loves you.\u201d</p><p>Roy frowned. \u201cHe has a unique way of showing his love. Let me see...I love my son. I wonder how I can best show him that love? I know! I\u2019ll divorce my wife, destroy my family and steal his fianc\u00e9e. That should do the trick. Well, guess what, it didn\u2019t work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRoy, don\u2019t you understand that what happened between me and your father just happened? Neither of us asked to fall in love with the other.\u201d</p><p>Roy\u2019s hand shot up. \u201cSpare me. I don\u2019t buy that for a second. You no more love my father than you loved me. When I think of what a fool I was, I get sick to my stomach. It was never me you wanted. I see that now. You were always interested in my father and you used me to get to him.\u201d</p><p>Aimee flew to her feet. \u201cThat\u2019s where you\u2019re wrong. I do love Burton and he loves me. I love him enough to swallow my pride and approach you. Just talk to him, that\u2019s all I ask.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry, but I\u2019m not interested.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d hoped your mother\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeave my mother out of this!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI sent her a Christmas card,\u201d Aimee said. \u201cI thought the best way to reach you was through her.\u201d</p><p>Roy stood up and leaned against his desk. \u201cYou sent my mother a Christmas card? Why would you do such a thing? How was she supposed to take that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t write anything in it. I just wanted her to know I don\u2019t bear her any ill will.\u201d</p><p>Roy stared at Aimee, completely stupefied. \u201cDid it ever occur to you that she might be the one who bears ill will?\u201d</p><p>Aimee bit her pouting lower lip. Collagen injections? he wondered indifferently. \u201cNot really.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank God you never wanted to be her friend. I\u2019d hate to think what you might have done if you\u2019d actually liked her.\u201d</p><p>Aimee gave a little cry of dismay. \u201cI didn\u2019t do anything to her!\u201d</p><p>Despite his effort not to reveal his emotions, Roy felt himself clenching his jaw. \u201cYou stole her husband.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t,\u201d Aimee insisted. \u201cBurton hadn\u2019t been happy in years.\u201d</p><p>Roy ignored that. \u201cThen my father cheated my mother in the divorce settlement. He took what should\u2019ve been hers by hiding the money in offshore accounts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBurton would never do that,\u201d Aimee said, shaking her head. The shimmering pale blond hair swung gently. Roy figured she was well aware of the effect.</p><p>\u201cStay married to him,\u201d he advised. \u201cNow you know what he\u2019ll do if a younger, sexier replacement comes along.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBurton and I are deeply in love,\u201d Aimee said. \u201cDo you think it was easy coming here today? Well, it wasn\u2019t. I thought\u2014I hoped you\u2019d at least listen to me, but I can see I was wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can tell my father one thing,\u201d Roy said angrily. \u201cTell him to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to listen,\u201d Shirley cried, and covered both her ears.</p><p>\u201cMe, neither.\u201d Goodness followed suit. She hummed a special hymn to blot out the terse, angry words. When she felt it was safe, she lifted her hands from her ears.</p><p>Mercy\u2019s eyes were wide. \u201cThat boy has quite the vocabulary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou listened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure, why not? Aimee had it coming. That woman has some nerve, arriving out of the blue like that.\u201d</p><p>Shirley walked over to the door and peered out. \u201cShe\u2019s gone now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood riddance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat a mess,\u201d Goodness said with a sigh. \u201cI think she must genuinely love Roy\u2019s father, otherwise she\u2019d never have shown up at the office.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe lacks discretion,\u201d Shirley said sadly. \u201cHow could she possibly think that mailing Anne a Christmas card would help her cause?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s feeling guilty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs well she should.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe weren\u2019t sent here to deal with Aimee,\u201d Goodness reminded her friends. \u201cThat woman is going to require an entire legion of angels. Our concern is Roy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, brother!\u201d Mercy threw herself against the wall. \u201cYou won\u2019t believe this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Shirley tried to peek but Mercy stopped her. \u201cOh, look at Roy.\u201d</p><p>Goodness studied him. Roy was in an agitated state, pacing back and forth across the room. Although she was unable to read his thoughts, one glance told her that those thoughts were dark and angry. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Mercy pointed toward the other room. \u201cYou\u2019ll never guess who just arrived.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot Anne,\u201d Shirley cried.</p><p>\u201cNo, worse,\u201d Mercy said. \u201cIt\u2019s Julie.\u201d</p><p>Twenty-One</p> <p>Julie stepped off the elevator and strolled toward Ms. Johnson, the guardian of Roy\u2019s office. For two days, she\u2019d wrestled with the question of what she should do. She dreaded giving him her answer, but now that she was here, she was more convinced than ever that she\u2019d made the right decision.</p><p>Her natural inclination was to accept Roy\u2019s invitation and move in with him. He was correct about one thing: it was what they both wanted. Deep down, she clung to the hope that one day he\u2019d love her. She suspected he already did, or had begun to, anyway, but refused to acknowledge his feelings. Moving in with him had been easy to rationalize. In the end, however, after a lengthy talk with her sister, Julie had to admit that she wanted more out of their relationship. The hard part would be convincing Roy that they both needed more time.</p><p>\u201cMs. Wilcoff.\u201d His assistant looked up, startled. \u201cDid I know you were coming?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no, I stopped here on my way home from school. Is Roy busy?\u201d</p><p>The woman, who was rarely flustered, seemed so now. \u201cLet me check.\u201d Rather than use the intercom, she scurried away from her desk and disappeared behind Roy\u2019s office door.</p> <p>When Jason, the downstairs security guard, had let Julie into the building without so much as a raised eyebrow, she should\u2019ve realized there was a problem. The guard had worn a funny look, as if he knew something she didn\u2019t. Julie had wanted to ask him, but decided against it. Now Ms. Johnson was behaving in a peculiar manner, too.</p><p>A moment later, she reappeared. \u201cHe asked me to show you right in, but...\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut?\u201d Julie prompted when the woman hesitated. \u201cIs Roy having a bad day?\u201d</p><p>The older woman nodded. \u201cYou could say that. On second thought, seeing you might be exactly what he needs.\u201d</p><p>Now that Julie had arrived at her decision, she felt an urgency to get this conversation over with as quickly as possible. Delaying it might give her just enough time to change her mind.</p><p>Roy was sitting at his desk when she entered his office. He looked up and smiled, but she noticed that the warmth she\u2019d grown to expect was missing.</p> <p>\u201cShould I come back later?\u201d she asked uncertainly.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He motioned for her to take a seat.</p><p>\u201cI probably should\u2019ve phoned first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably,\u201d he agreed. He relaxed in his chair and folded his hands over his stomach. And waited.</p><p>\u201cI thought I should let you know what I\u2019ve decided.\u201d</p><p>He nodded, his expression unchanged.</p><p>The tightness in Julie\u2019s throat increased. She leaned forward just a little and tucked her hands beneath her thighs, something she did when she was nervous. \u201cI guess there\u2019s only one way to say this...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not accepting my invitation,\u201d he finished for her.</p> <p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAny particular reason?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeveral, but I do want you to know how tempted I was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s neither here nor there, is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, no\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnless, of course, you\u2019re figuring I\u2019ll up the ante.\u201d</p><p>Anger flared instantly, but Julie mentally counted to ten before responding. \u201cNo, Roy, I\u2019m not figuring you\u2019ll up the ante.\u201d She stood. \u201cI think it\u2019d be best if we talked about this another time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow\u2019s as good as any,\u201d he said.</p><p>She leaned closer to his desk, desperately searching his face for the reason he\u2019d changed. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe?\u201d he demanded.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re looking at me like...like I\u2019ve sprouted horns or something.\u201d</p><p>He laughed, but even his laughter sounded sarcastic. \u201cAll right, I\u2019ll play your little game. What would it take to get you into my condo? A monthly allowance? Jewelry? Just tell me and I\u2019ll arrange it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t insult me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs a thousand a week enough? You can quit teaching, live a life of luxury.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like my job!\u201d</p><p>He snorted. \u201cDon\u2019t give up teaching, then. Why should I care as long as you\u2019re there when I want you?\u201d</p><p>Julie was beginning to feel sick. \u201cI think I\u2019d better leave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t go,\u201d he said, although he didn\u2019t offer her a reason to stay.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d she asked, and made a sweeping gesture with her right arm. \u201cSomething must have happened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean other than an unexpected visit from my stepmother?\u201d He dragged out the last word, as if even saying it was repugnant.</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d He was talking about Aimee\u2014which explained a great deal. \u201cSo you\u2019re back to that.\u201d</p><p>He arched one brow. \u201cThat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll women are users and manipulators and not to be trusted, and therefore you ridicule every female you meet.\u201d She\u2019d had enough. When Roy was in this frame of mind, there was no reasoning with him, as she knew from experience. She turned to leave.</p><p>Roy bolted out of his chair. \u201cWhere are you going?\u201d</p><p>She ignored the question. \u201cPerhaps we can talk when you\u2019re feeling less...angry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I want this settled today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen it\u2019s settled. You have my answer.\u201d She started toward the door.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t accept that.\u201d</p><p>Julie faced him and slowly shook her head. \u201cYou know what? There are some things you can\u2019t buy, and I\u2019m one of them.\u201d</p><p>He scoffed. \u201cYou\u2019ll change your mind.\u201d</p><p>Rather than argue with him, she simply walked away. She was so furious her head felt about to explode. Mingled with the anger was a profound hurt. Roy didn\u2019t respect her, let alone love her. He viewed her as an object he could control\u2014and then discard when he\u2019d finished.</p><p>\u201cJulie?\u201d Ms. Johnson stood as Julie walked by.</p><p>Numb now, she only half heard the other woman. All Julie wanted was to escape. She hurried toward the elevators, hitting the down button.</p><p>\u201cI shouldn\u2019t have let you see him,\u201d Ms. Johnson said anxiously. \u201cHe hasn\u2019t had a good afternoon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t make excuses for him,\u201d Julie told her, stepping into the elevator. As soon as the doors closed, she slumped against the wall. Everything had become clear. She knew that some people were unable to move past the pain inflicted by others. They carried it with them for the rest of their lives, and everyone they met, everything they accomplished, was blighted by that pain. Roy, sadly, was one of those people.</p><p>When the elevator reached the lobby, Julie straightened, eager to get away from Fletcher Industries\u2014and Fletcher. When the doors slid open, Jason stood directly in front of her, legs braced apart, hands on his hips.</p><p>\u201cMr. Fletcher would like to see you,\u201d he announced.</p><p>\u201cTell him another time would be better,\u201d Julie said, attempting to get past him.</p><p>\u201cHe insisted. I\u2019m sorry, Ms. Wilcoff, but I have my orders.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich are what? Shoot me on sight if I refuse to talk to your boss? This is illegal confinement, in case you weren\u2019t aware of it.\u201d</p><p>A smile cracked Jason\u2019s tight lips. \u201cJust talk to him, all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m supposed to take the elevator up to his office?\u201d</p><p>Jason nodded.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t do that.\u201d</p><p>Jason\u2019s eyes pleaded with her. \u201cAs a personal favor to me, would you just do it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry, no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMs. Wilcoff, he called down here himself and asked me to keep you in the building.\u201d</p><p>Despite her anguish, Julie laughed. \u201cThat\u2019s quite a contrast to his earlier commands, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t help that.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cI will say this\u2014you\u2019ve certainly made my job interesting.\u201d</p><p>Julie gave an exasperated sigh. Talking to Roy, especially now, wasn\u2019t going to solve anything. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I can\u2019t.\u201d When it looked as if Jason was about to detain her, Julie leaped agilely to the right and then just as quickly to the left. To her astonishment, without the least bit of effort, she sprinted past the guard.</p><p>Jason appeared stunned. \u201cHow\u2019d you do that?\u201d he asked, chasing after her.</p><p>She was at the door, pushing it open, when he reached her. He stretched out his arms, lunged forward\u2014and froze in place. \u201cI can\u2019t move,\u201d he cried. \u201cSomething\u2019s holding me back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood try, Jason,\u201d she said as she walked outside, taking a moment to admire Anne\u2019s angel windows. Too bad Roy didn\u2019t understand the spirit of Christmas\u2014or the nature of faith and love\u2014the way his mother did.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not joking!\u201d</p><p>The door closed behind her as she bolted toward the visitor parking lot. She glanced over her shoulder once to find Jason still in that odd position, one leg stretched out as if stepping forward to grab her. When he noticed her watching him, he called out for help. Smiling, Julie simply shook her head. He certainly had an inventive approach to getting her sympathy.</p><p>After she drove away from Fletcher Industries, Julie headed toward the school. It was almost dark now, but she needed to vent her frustration, so she changed into running gear and jogged toward the track. After doing a couple of quick laps, she left the field and took one of her usual routes in a friendly neighborhood near the school. Generally she avoided running in the dark, but her gear had reflective tape so she could be seen by oncoming traffic.</p><p>Her feet hit the pavement in a rhythm that matched the pounding of her heart. Her thoughts, however, flew at a far greater speed. Anger was soon replaced by sadness. Sadness became regret...and resignation. As she approached the five-mile marker, she became aware of a car driving behind her.</p><p>It could only be Roy.</p><p>He eased his car alongside her and lowered the passenger window. \u201cYou have a hard time following directions, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot at all.\u201d She slowed to a clipped walk, her arms swinging. \u201cWhy would you say that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did you do to Jason?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t do a thing to him.\u201d</p><p>Roy brought his sedan to a stop, parked it by the curb and then jumped out. Jogging around the front of the vehicle, he joined her. \u201cThat\u2019s not what he told me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBelieve what you want.\u201d She tried to hide how hard she was breathing\u2014and how pleased she was to see him. Because, in spite of everything, she was. But that wasn\u2019t going to change the situation.</p><p>\u201cCome on, Julie, be reasonable. If you want an apology, you\u2019ve got one. I was rude and arrogant.\u201d He paced his walk to hers.</p><p>\u201cYes, you were.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you for being so gracious,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019ve got anything left to discuss. You have my answer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want you to reconsider.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t work,\u201d she said, and she meant it. She stopped walking, and at the risk of letting down her guard, raised her hand to his cheek. \u201cIn the beginning, living together would\u2019ve been wonderful\u2014\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt still can be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it wouldn\u2019t last.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing lasts forever, and we\u2019d be foolish to think otherwise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy parents\u2019 love for each other did.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMine didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Julie shrugged. \u201cI\u2019m sorry for you, sorry for them, but I can\u2019t let what happened between your mother and father taint my life. I\u2019m falling in love with you, Roy, and I want it all.\u201d</p><p>With an angry sigh of frustration, he threw back his head to stare at the dark sky. \u201cJulie, come on! I\u2019m willing to give you whatever you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut that\u2019s just the point\u2014you aren\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>He placed his hand over hers and brought it to his lips, kissing the tender skin of her palm. \u201cWe could have something good. Who cares if it doesn\u2019t last a lifetime?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI care, Roy. I\u2019m sorry, I really am. It would be so easy to let you persuade me, but in the end I\u2019d have nothing left except a broken heart.\u201d He couldn\u2019t possibly know how much she already loved him.</p><p>Roy released her hand. \u201cYou\u2019re like all the rest, aren\u2019t you? You want to control me, get your hands on my success and make it your own. Naturally, your term for this is love. I\u2019m supposed to marry you and promise to spend the rest of my life with you? Well, you can forget that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah, the old marriage trap. It\u2019s worked for thousands of years, but it\u2019s not good enough for you. Silly me\u2014refusing to settle for anything less than love and commitment.\u201d She gestured wildly with one hand.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t do it, Julie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen there\u2019s nothing more to say.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cObviously not.\u201d Her throat constricted with sadness.</p><p>Neither moved. Neither wanted to be the first to turn away, Julie suspected, or to acknowledge that this relationship was over almost before it had begun.</p><p>Finally she was the one who turned and, with tears burning her eyes, ran in the opposite direction.</p><p>Twenty-Two</p><p>Saturday afternoon, Christmas music played softly in the background as Anne pulled her suitcase from the closet and laid it on her bed. She sang along with her favorite carols as she started to take sweaters from her dresser drawers. Since Marta had sent her the airline ticket online, she\u2019d had two additional phone conversations with her. Things seemed to be looking up. Jack had made numerous attempts to speak to her and she\u2019d agreed to meet with him\u2014after she got the report from the private investigator. Needless to say, she didn\u2019t tell him that part; Jack had no idea his wife was having him followed. Their conversation would depend on what the investigator discovered. Still, Jack\u2019s willingness\u2014indeed frantic desire\u2014to get his wife back boded well, Anne thought. She was grateful Marta could benefit from her experience.</p><p>Marta hadn\u2019t given Anne any new details regarding the sale of her angel portrait. However, from everything her friend had told her, the news was good. The painting would definitely sell, and for a high price, too.</p><p>A noise in the living room startled Anne, and she paused to listen again. Someone was in her home. \u201cWho\u2019s there?\u201d she called out, a little nervous. She tried to remember where she\u2019d left her portable phone.</p><p>\u201cMother?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cRoy?\u201d She hurried out of the bedroom. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d Her son\u2019s appearance shocked her. He hadn\u2019t shaved in a day or two and looked as if he\u2019d slept in his clothes.</p><p>\u201cFrankly, I don\u2019t know,\u201d he said, not meeting her eyes. \u201cI started driving and then all of a sudden I was on a ferry, headed to your place. I guess I just need to talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy goodness, what\u2019s happened?\u201d she asked, resisting the urge to take him in her arms.</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t sure if you\u2019d already left for New York or not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI fly out in the morning. Now, sit down and tell me what\u2019s wrong.\u201d For once he didn\u2019t argue. She directed him into her kitchen, sat him down at the small table and immediately started cooking. At times like this, food could be a wonderful comfort. She put on a pot of coffee, then took out a pan and set it on the stove. After that, she retrieved two eggs from the refrigerator. When she saw that she was paying more attention to creating the perfect omelet than to her son, she stopped. She pulled out a chair and sat across from Roy.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d she asked gently.</p><p>\u201cI asked Julie to move in with me,\u201d he mumbled.</p><p>Anne sighed heavily. That wasn\u2019t what she wanted for her son; in fact, she saw it as a mistake for both of them, but young people always thought they knew best.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t approve. Julie knew her father wouldn\u2019t, either, not that it matters, anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe turned you down?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLock, stock and barrel. I guess I should be grateful.\u201d</p><p>He certainly didn\u2019t look grateful. If anything, Roy seemed distraught. Immediate questions came to mind, but Anne avoided asking, knowing Roy would explain everything in his own time. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo am I. Julie insists on what she calls love and, of course, marriage.\u201d He spit out the words as if they tasted foul.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve had setbacks before,\u201d Anne said, hardly able to credit this kind of reaction to a simple rejection. Privately Anne was cheering Julie for having the courage to hold out for what she wanted. It couldn\u2019t have been easy to turn him down. When Roy went after something, he did it with a determination that was difficult to ignore.</p><p>\u201cThis is more than a setback.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you mean?\u201d</p><p>Roy rubbed a hand tiredly down his face and shook his head. \u201cI was foolish enough to believe she was different.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJulie is different. She\u2019s special. I know you think every woman\u2019s like Aimee, but you\u2019re wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Mother, in Julie\u2019s case I\u2019m right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJulie isn\u2019t anything like Aimee,\u201d she said adamantly.</p><p>\u201cShe just proved to me she is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d He\u2019d have to show her the evidence before Anne would believe him. Although she didn\u2019t know Julie well, Anne had sensed genuine goodness in her. She felt, too, that Julie had attained the spiritual and emotional insights that only someone who\u2019d suffered could fully understand.</p><p>Roy reached inside his jacket and pulled out a wad of folded papers. \u201cRead this.\u201d</p><p>Anne took the papers, opening them on the table. She put on her reading glasses and quickly scanned the contents. As far as she could see, it was a bunch of legal mumbo jumbo. \u201cIt\u2019s some sort of settlement offer,\u201d she said. \u201cOh, here\u2019s Julie\u2019s name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know what it is,\u201d Roy barked, then cast her an apologetic glance. \u201cRemember when I ran into her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, of course, your car collided with her bike. It\u2019s a miracle she wasn\u2019t hurt.\u201d</p><p>He gave an unpleasant laugh. \u201cCorrection, Mother. She was hurt twenty-five-thousand dollars\u2019 worth.\u201d</p><p>Anne snatched up the papers and skimmed them again.</p><p>\u201cShe signed the settlement offer,\u201d he pointed out. \u201cA check\u2019s already been issued to her in the amount stated.\u201d</p><p>Anne knew that wasn\u2019t possible. Yet there was Julie\u2019s signature, plain as day.</p><p>Roy focused his gaze on the kitchen wall. \u201cI pressured her at first, believing it was best to deal with the incident quickly rather than have her come back and bite me later. She repeatedly refused, and after a while I started to trust her.</p><p>\u201cI finally decided she wasn\u2019t a gold digger. She had me convinced that money didn\u2019t mean a thing to her\u2014and now this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRoy, I don\u2019t think\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re holding the evidence in your hand,\u201d he countered, his voice raised in anger.</p><p>Only he wasn\u2019t really angry, Anne realized; he was hurt and disillusioned and growing more so by the minute. Oh, this was dreadful. It was as if God had broken a promise. Anne had felt so sure that Julie was the woman she\u2019d been praying for all these years and now this...this betrayal.</p><p>\u201cAll along, Julie was holding out for more money.\u201d He rubbed his eyes as if he was exhausted. \u201cI forgot about the settlement when we started dating.\u201d He expelled a shaky breath. \u201cThen she declined to move in with me, and that was the end of our fine romance. Except that I remembered we hadn\u2019t settled her so-called accident and I contacted her again.\u201d</p><p>Anne didn\u2019t say anything, waiting for him to continue his story.</p><p>\u201cShe wouldn\u2019t talk to me about it.\u201d</p><p>Anne silently applauded; perhaps everything wasn\u2019t lost, after all.</p><p>\u201cThe thing is, Mother, I thought she was different, that I could trust her.\u201d</p><p>Anne reached across the table and patted his hand.</p><p>\u201cThen she proved I can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRoy, let\u2019s not be hasty here. Yes, it looks bad, but let\u2019s face it\u2014if Julie was interested in your money, she would\u2019ve moved in with you. Don\u2019t make the mistake of judging her too harshly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHarshly?\u201d he snapped. \u201cIt isn\u2019t just about the money. I went over to her place to see her, to talk to her. I hoped we could find a way to compromise.... All I wanted was for the two of us to be together.\u201d</p><p>Anne bit her lower lip, afraid of what he\u2019d say next.</p><p>\u201cI told her if she didn\u2019t want to move in with me, I\u2019d be willing to set her up in her own apartment.\u201d</p><p>After a moment, Anne managed to speak. \u201cShe wasn\u2019t interested in that, either, I take it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot at all.\u201d</p><p>Anne smiled to herself. Perhaps, just perhaps, Julie was everything she\u2019d hoped for. Surely God wouldn\u2019t be so cruel as to send another Aimee into Roy\u2019s life.</p><p>\u201cI reminded her that I wasn\u2019t offering marriage, but she could have the next-best thing. I made it clear that this was my final offer. If she said no, I was walking out that door once and for all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was willing to accept that?\u201d</p><p>He hung his head. \u201cApparently so. Then I brought up the settlement. I told her I wasn\u2019t upping the ante. If she was going to get anything out of me, she\u2019d better sign.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou left the papers with her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he said bitterly. \u201cI had my attorney contact her. This afternoon I got the signed papers by messenger, with the attorney\u2019s notice that the check had been mailed.\u201d</p><p>Roy looked so disheartened Anne ached once again to take him in her arms the way she had when he was small. He\u2019d come to her for solace, but there was nothing she could do or say to ease this pain. Julie hadn\u2019t turned out to be the woman Anne had hoped, after all.</p><p>\u201cShe has her money, then?\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cIt\u2019s what she always wanted. Twenty-five thousand\u2014no strings. I\u2019ll say one thing for her,\u201d he muttered cynically. \u201cShe was good.\u201d</p><p>Anne\u2019s shoulders sagged with disappointment. \u201cLive and learn,\u201d she said under her breath.</p><p>\u201cShe came in right after Aimee that afternoon,\u201d Roy said, speaking almost to himself. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Anne leaned closer, certain she\u2019d misunderstood. \u201cAimee was five years ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Aimee was three days ago.\u201d</p><p>Anne thought her heart had stopped beating. She needed a couple of minutes to calm herself before she asked, \u201cAimee came to see you? Recently?\u201d</p><p>Roy\u2019s gaze darted to hers. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to say anything\u2014I shouldn\u2019t have. I apologize, Mom, for bringing up unpleasant memories.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTell me,\u201d Anne insisted.</p><p>Roy tilted back his chair, staring at the ceiling. \u201cShe stopped by the office, unannounced and unwelcome.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy does Aimee do anything?\u201d Roy said sarcastically. \u201cShe wanted something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p> <p>Roy shook his head as if to say he still didn\u2019t really believe it. \u201cShe came with some ridiculous story about my father loving me and wanting to see me again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know Burton\u2019s tried to contact you,\u201d Anne said.</p><p>\u201cWho told you that?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t want to get his assistant in trouble, but Ms. Johnson had volunteered the information. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t do you any harm to talk to him, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have anything to say to the man,\u201d Roy said bluntly.</p><p>Anne felt herself go rigid. \u201cIt\u2019s been five years since you last talked to your father. I know you don\u2019t want to hear this, but I think it\u2019s time you two called a truce.\u201d As difficult as it was, she gave Aimee credit for supporting Burton\u2019s desire to make peace with his son.</p> <p>\u201cWe don\u2019t have anything in common.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s your father.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe betrayed us both.\u201d</p><p>Anne didn\u2019t have a response to that. She wasn\u2019t in any position to defend Burton, and wouldn\u2019t. \u201cAt least Aimee tried to help.\u201d</p><p>Roy snickered. \u201cDon\u2019t go painting her in any chivalrous light. She had her own agenda. She always has. I should\u2019ve recognized it at the time, but fool that I am, I took her at face value.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>Roy looked away, as if he\u2019d said more than he intended. \u201cI called Dad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Roy, I\u2019m so glad you did.\u201d Part of that was a lie, but for Roy\u2019s sake she was grateful. A son, no matter what his age, needed his father.</p> <p>He shook his head. \u201cThe conversation didn\u2019t go well, but I did learn an important piece of information.\u201d</p><p>Anne waited for him to explain.</p><p>\u201cAimee wants something big and expensive for Christmas, and Dad told her if he was going to plunk down thousands of dollars, she could do something for him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe got what he wanted,\u201d Roy murmured. \u201cI phoned him, just like she knew I would.\u201d</p><p>Aimee\u2019s manipulativeness had left Roy deeply cynical toward women; Julie\u2019s actions, unfortunately, had only confirmed that cynicism.</p><p>\u201cHow is your father?\u201d Anne asked despite herself.</p><p>\u201cYou honestly care?\u201d Roy\u2019s eyes were skeptical. \u201cThe man betrayed you, cheated you, and now you\u2019re concerned about his well-being? Don\u2019t be, Mother. Dad is getting exactly what he deserves.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cAimee. She\u2019s spending money faster than he can earn it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry to hear that.\u201d</p><p>He cast her a doubting look.</p><p>Anne grinned. \u201cOkay, that\u2019s not entirely true. But I really don\u2019t harbor any ill will toward your father. I\u2019ve gotten on with my life. After the divorce, I felt used up and old, but now...\u201d She got to her feet, still talking, and poured them each a coffee. \u201cWell, the thing is, I found a whole new part of myself. I believe that our world was created with a sense of order. For every loss, there\u2019s a gain. Sometimes we\u2019re so blinded by the loss that we don\u2019t see the gain, don\u2019t recognize the gift.\u201d She paused, handing him his cup. \u201cThere\u2019s a wonderful gift for you in Aimee\u2019s betrayal, and one day you\u2019ll discover it.\u201d</p><p>Roy gazed at her with puzzlement and what seemed to be renewed respect. \u201cYou\u2019re a better person than I\u2019ll ever be.\u201d</p><p>Anne hated to ask again, but she was curious about her ex-husband. \u201cIs your father...well?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat you really mean is, does he have any regrets?\u201d Roy supplied for her.</p><p>There was some truth in that. \u201cI don\u2019t think your father would admit any regrets to you, would he?\u201d</p><p>Roy agreed. \u201cNot in so many words, but it was easy enough to read between the lines.\u201d</p><p>Anne held her breath. So often she\u2019d speculated about Burton and his new life. \u201cOther than financially, is everything as it should be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so. My guess is that Dad\u2019s having trouble keeping up with Aimee, uh, physically. Now that he\u2019s in his sixties, his work pace is taking its toll. He didn\u2019t sound happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did he sound?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTired, exasperated, overworked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought your father would\u2019ve retired by now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe can\u2019t,\u201d Roy said, \u201cnot with the speed at which Aimee is spending his money, and that\u2019s only the half of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>Roy shrugged and she thought for a moment that he wasn\u2019t going to tell her. \u201cIt also seems that Aimee\u2019s taken a liking to some of his clients\u2014men who are seeking comfort after their divorces.\u201d</p><p>Anne was shocked. \u201cYour father actually told you that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot exactly, but close.\u201d He shook his head in disgust. \u201cShe spouted all these platitudes about loving my father and building a bridge between us, and it was all lies.\u201d A muscle leaped in the side of his jaw. \u201cShe came with a purpose, which she advanced with her lies. She wanted something from me, just the same as Julie did.\u201d</p><p>Obviously, it was Julie who was on his mind. \u201cNo matter what papers Julie signed,\u201d Anne said, \u201cI still don\u2019t think she\u2019s anything like Aimee.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been fooled before, and I\u2019m not going to let it happen again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d It broke her heart to admit that. \u201cI wish I wasn\u2019t leaving you over Christmas.\u201d</p><p>He frowned, and then smiled. \u201cDo you honestly think it bothers me? Christmas doesn\u2019t mean a thing to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut, Roy, it should.\u201d Her heart ached for her only child. Nothing had worked out as she\u2019d hoped. Her prayers, like so many before, had gone unanswered. Roy would be alone on Christmas Day.</p><p>Twenty-Three</p><p>Three days before Christmas, Julie knew this was destined to be the worst one of her life. She was already dealing with the loss of her mother and now she\u2019d lost Roy, too.</p><p>Even her twin sister\u2019s call hadn\u2019t raised her spirits. Julie ended the conversation and then wandered into the living room, where her father sat watching the evening news.</p><p>One look at her, and Dean grabbed the remote control and muted the volume. \u201cThat bad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI feel just awful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause of Fletcher?\u201d</p><p>Slumping into the chair next to him, Julie nodded. \u201cI don\u2019t know what happened. I went to see him on Wednesday afternoon, and it was as if he\u2019d shut me out of his life.\u201d Julie still didn\u2019t understand it. He\u2019d been so cold and defensive; nothing she said had reached him. And their second meeting, a day later, was even worse.</p><p>\u201cIs it the settlement money?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. She\u2019d never intended to accept a dime of that settlement, but Roy had angered her so much she\u2019d agreed to his terms out of pure frustration. He seemed to believe all women were greedy for money and power.</p><p>\u201cI was tired of fighting with him,\u201d she said in a subdued voice.</p><p>\u201cI know. Fletcher\u2019s gone far in the business world by the sheer strength of his determination.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly in this instance, he\u2019s wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, Kitten.\u201d</p><p>Her last angry exchange with Roy lingered in her mind. Furious, she\u2019d signed those stupid papers. It was what he\u2019d expected, what he\u2019d demanded she do\u2014and so she had. But oh, how she regretted it. She hated to end their relationship on such a negative note, but what choice did she have? Roy had cast her from his life as if she meant nothing.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know if he\u2019s capable of love,\u201d she murmured, hoping her father had some consolation to offer.</p><p>\u201cEvery human has the capacity to love,\u201d he said with such confidence that her heart surged with hope. \u201cBut a person\u2019s ability to love is only equal to his or her openness in receiving it.\u201d</p><p>Julie valued her father\u2019s wisdom. He was right; nothing she could say or do at this point had the potential to reach Roy. He had certain beliefs about her and about all women, and he\u2019d made certain assumptions as a result.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like one last opportunity to talk to him,\u201d she said. Not because she expected to change his mind. That seemed doubtful. All she wanted was an opportunity to undo the damage they\u2019d inflicted on each other.</p><p>Her father seemed to weigh her words. \u201cDo you think seeing him again is wise?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...don\u2019t know. Probably not,\u201d she said, but the need still burned within her. \u201cI just feel so bad about the way we ended everything....\u201d</p><p>\u201cFletcher\u2019s been out of the office for a few days, but he\u2019s back now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s almost Christmas and...in the spirit of the holidays I thought...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou thought he might listen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt least long enough to understand my reasons.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want to do this for you or for Fletcher?\u201d her father asked.</p><p>The question was a valid one. Julie mulled it over, then answered as honestly as she could. \u201cI don\u2019t know. I guess it\u2019s for me. I don\u2019t feel right leaving things the way they are. I can\u2019t imagine he\u2019ll see me, but I have to try.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen write him a letter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA letter,\u201d Julie repeated. \u201cI doubt he\u2019d read it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes that matter?\u201d her father asked. \u201cYou\u2019ll have said what you feel is necessary. Then you can let him go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue,\u201d she admitted, the idea taking shape. The more she thought about it, the more she realized how much had been left unsaid.</p><p>\u201cWhether Fletcher reads it or not is up to him,\u201d her father said. \u201cWhen feelings run this strong, sometimes letters are the best form of communication. There\u2019s less room for misunderstanding or argument.\u201d</p><p>Julie immediately felt relieved. Writing Roy, explaining her thoughts and emotions, was a solution she hadn\u2019t considered before. She might never learn if he\u2019d read her letter, but she\u2019d have the satisfaction of knowing she\u2019d done everything she could. If he responded, good; that would mean there was still a chance. If, as she expected, she never heard from him again, she could find peace in the knowledge that she\u2019d tried.</p><p>\u201cOh, Dad, I don\u2019t think I appreciate you nearly enough.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Dean merely grinned and picked up the television remote.</p><p>Composing the letter took all evening. Julie read it over repeatedly before she was satisfied. In the first paragraph, she thanked Roy for the good times they\u2019d shared, for opening his home and his life to her for even this short while.</p><p>That had been the easy part of the letter. More difficult was discussing his utter rejection of her. Then she related her father\u2019s observation, telling Roy he could only trust her as much as he allowed himself to trust. In the last third of the letter, she apologized for her own angry response to his lack of faith.</p><p>It was midnight when she finished. Although she\u2019d had trouble sleeping since their breakup, she experienced no such difficulty that night. Once again, she marveled at her father\u2019s wisdom. It really didn\u2019t matter whether Roy ever read her letter. In the process of articulating her reactions she\u2019d found the peace she sought.</p> <p>The next morning, the last day of school before winter break, Julie took the letter with her, planning to drop it off at the post office. School ended at noon, but after she\u2019d had a festive lunch with the other teachers and straightened up her classroom, it was nearly three. If she posted the letter as she\u2019d originally intended, he might not receive it until after Christmas. She had no idea what his Christmas plans were; maybe he\u2019d already left for a Caribbean cruise or a country inn in Vermont, she thought whimsically. At one time, she\u2019d hoped to invite him and his mother to join her and her father. She hadn\u2019t even had a chance to broach the subject.</p><p>Nor had she spoken to his mother since Saturday. Anne hadn\u2019t called her, and Julie didn\u2019t feel comfortable putting his mother in the middle of this awkward situation.</p><p>Although it meant facing Jason, the guard at the entrance, she decided to deliver the letter personally.</p><p>Julie felt his gaze on her the moment she pulled into the parking lot. His eyes didn\u2019t leave her until she\u2019d parked in an empty slot and then climbed out of her car. Julie half expected the security guard to block the entrance. But Jason sat at his desk, one hand on the phone, obviously ready to call for reinforcements.</p><p>He got warily to his feet when she walked in, but remained solidly behind his desk, as if it afforded him protection.</p> <p>\u201cStay away from me,\u201d Jason warned.</p><p>Startled, Julie glanced over her shoulder. No one else was there. She couldn\u2019t imagine why the burly guard would be afraid of her.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what you did to me, lady, but I don\u2019t want a repeat of it, understand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJason,\u201d she said in her most conciliatory voice, \u201cwhat in heaven\u2019s name are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know.\u201d He gestured theatrically. \u201cJust stay right where you are. You\u2019re not allowed in this building.\u201d</p><p>Actually she\u2019d expected that. \u201cNot to worry, I don\u2019t have any intention of storming into Mr. Fletcher\u2019s office. I have a letter for him.\u201d She advanced slowly toward Jason\u2019s desk, not wanting to intimidate him any more than she already had, although how she\u2019d done that was a mystery.</p> <p>He backed away until he bumped into the wall behind him.</p><p>\u201cAll I ask is that you give Mr. Fletcher this letter,\u201d she said, careful to enunciate every word. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to deliver it yourself,\u201d she assured him, in case it was the prospect of an encounter with Roy that had unsettled him. \u201cI\u2019m sure Ms. Johnson will be more than happy to see that Mr. Fletcher receives it.\u201d</p><p>Jason\u2019s eyes moved past her and a chagrined expression appeared on his face.</p><p>Julie looked over her shoulder again to find Roy standing there. He\u2019d clearly just stepped out of the elevator. Her first instinct, absurdly enough, was to turn tail and run. A second later, she seemed completely incapable of moving. Or breathing. Or anything else.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s Ms. Wilcoff doing in the building?\u201d Roy asked the security guard as if Julie wasn\u2019t standing directly in front of him.</p><p>\u201cShe has a letter for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. I wrote you a letter.\u201d She hated the way her voice trembled, but she hadn\u2019t been prepared to see Roy. It wasn\u2019t supposed to happen like this!</p><p>Jason handed Roy the envelope, which he reluctantly accepted.</p> <p>Julie\u2019s heart pounded in her ears. She had to escape as quickly as possible. \u201cI\u2019ll leave now,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cThat would be best,\u201d Jason boomed. With his employer close at hand, he\u2019d apparently regained his nerve. He escorted Julie to the front door, going so far as to push it open for her.</p><p>Julie felt Roy\u2019s eyes burning holes in her back as she exited the building. She walked at twice her normal speed, intent on getting away.</p><p>Then she heard footsteps behind her.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s in the letter?\u201d Roy demanded, following her into the parking lot.</p><p>Julie fumbled for her car keys. \u201cI suggest you read it.\u201d She stood by the driver\u2019s door, while Roy waited at the rear bumper.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll bet you declared your love and described how anguished you are by our parting.\u201d</p><p>Julie wasn\u2019t taking the bait. Everything she wanted to say was in the letter; she had no intention of repeating it and then arguing over the points she\u2019d made.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not interested in the account of your undying love.\u201d</p><p>Her hand shook so badly she had trouble pressing the button to automatically unlock her car door.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re no different from Aimee.\u201d He seemed to want to provoke her into losing her temper. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter? Don\u2019t you have anything to say?\u201d</p><p>A painful breath worked its way through her lungs. \u201cMost everything is in the letter, Roy, but I realize now that there are a few things I left out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. You can say them to my face.\u201d</p><p>She studied him then, really looked at him, and saw how unhappy he was. This was the most joyous season of the year, and Roy was miserable.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t say I loved you,\u201d she said, her voice gaining strength and control. \u201cAs you\u2019ll discover if you read my letter.\u201d</p><p>He arched his brow in that all-too-familiar sarcastic way.</p><p>\u201cBut the truth is, I do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpare me, please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s foolish, I suppose, but I always did like a challenge, and you, Roy Fletcher, are definitely that.\u201d She even managed a brief smile.</p><p>Again the sardonic arched brow.</p><p>\u201cThe thing is,\u201d she continued, determined not to let his cynicism destroy her, \u201cI do love you and it\u2019s up to you to accept that love or reject it.\u201d</p><p>He said nothing.</p><p>\u201cWe haven\u2019t known each other long, but in that time, I\u2019ve learned a great deal about the kind of man you are. You have a tremendous capacity to give of yourself, a tremendous capacity to love.\u201d She thought of the fact that he\u2019d hired her father and that, unknown to his mother, he\u2019d bought her paintings. She recalled the afternoon he\u2019d come to her soccer game\u2014and so much more. His unpretentious enjoyment of her simple meals. The loyalty his staff felt toward him...</p><p>He held up his hand. \u201cNot interested.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, and that saddens me, because I\u2019m going to get in my car and drive away. I didn\u2019t come here to argue with you\u2014I didn\u2019t even expect to see you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt seems to me you planned it perfectly so you would.\u201d</p><p>Did he honestly believe she\u2019d somehow manipulated their simultaneous presence in the company foyer? \u201cI didn\u2019t. But whether I did or not is of little concern.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. Julie knew he must have some feelings for her, otherwise he wouldn\u2019t be standing here now, wouldn\u2019t be listening to her. If this was her only chance to get through to him, then she might as well give it her best shot.</p><p>\u201cYou have the ability to decide what you want out of life, Roy. You can go on living behind your hard exterior, blocking out anyone who has the potential to teach you about love, or you can\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI already said I wasn\u2019t interested in love. I made that clear from the beginning,\u201d he snapped. \u201cWhat is it with you? Every other word out of your mouth is something about love. Yeah, right! Well, I can\u2019t help wondering how much love you\u2019d really feel if I wasn\u2019t who I am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho are you, Roy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know what I mean.\u201d He gestured toward the building that stood as evidence of his prosperity.</p><p>\u201cAre you the rich and successful entrepreneur?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know what I mean,\u201d he said again.</p><p>\u201cUnfortunately, I don\u2019t,\u201d she told him, opening her car door. \u201cI thought I knew who you were, but I guess I was wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought I knew who you were,\u201d he retorted, his eyes blazing, \u201cbut you proved me wrong. All you care about is the size of my checking account and what you can get out of me.\u201d</p><p>She refused to listen to any more. With a heavy heart, she climbed inside the car.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re\u2014\u201d</p><p>She closed the door to drown out his words, then inserted the key into the ignition. When she glanced in her rearview mirror, Roy was gone.</p><p>Julie exited the parking lot, and as soon as she was out of sight, she pulled to the curb and wept tears of pain and grief.</p><p>Leaning her forehead against the steering wheel, she knew she\u2019d never see Roy Fletcher again.</p><p>Twenty-Four</p><p>\u201cThis is absolutely terrible,\u201d Goodness lamented. All afternoon, they\u2019d watched Julie put on a good front for her father\u2019s sake. She could just picture the scene in Heaven when they returned only seven hours from now. It was Christmas Eve, their deadline. Soon they\u2019d be required to stand with the angelic host singing praises to the newborn King. Except this year, Shirley, Goodness and Mercy would arrive from Earth without having fulfilled their mission. Goodness wouldn\u2019t be able to look a single friend in the face. Well, she wasn\u2019t accepting defeat that easily.</p><p>\u201cIt can\u2019t get much worse,\u201d Mercy agreed.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got to do something.\u201d Shirley was back to her pacing in front of the Wilcoffs\u2019 Christmas tree. The living room was empty, with Julie in her room and Dean overseeing a last-minute security check of the Fletcher building.</p><p>\u201cThis is your fault,\u201d Goodness said, glaring at Mercy. \u201cIf you hadn\u2019t been so busy tossing salmon in Pike Place Market and holding security guards by the knees, we might\u2019ve made some headway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGive it up,\u201d Mercy growled. \u201cBesides, we both know you had a hand on Jason, too. I couldn\u2019t have held him back all by myself. That guy has muscles.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop.\u201d Shirley planted herself between the other two and shook her head. \u201cWe don\u2019t have time to play the blame game.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re telling me,\u201d Goodness moaned. \u201cIt\u2019s already five o\u2019clock.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat means we have seven paltry hours,\u201d Shirley said, glancing at the old-fashioned clock on the fireplace mantel.</p><p>\u201cWoe is we.\u201d Goodness couldn\u2019t believe that a prayer request could go so wrong. They\u2019d worked harder on this one than on any previous request. In years past, they\u2019d each received separate assignments, but she\u2019d assumed that with their combined efforts this one would\u2019ve been simplicity itself. Not so. And if there was anything Goodness hated, it was having to admit she\u2019d failed. \u201cWe\u2019ve just got to do something.\u201d They had a few hours left. Just a few. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBut what?\u201d Mercy cried.</p><p>\u201cThink,\u201d Shirley ordered. \u201cThere\u2019s a way. There\u2019s always a way.\u201d</p><p>Defeated and depressed, Goodness walked into the darkened kitchen and threw open the refrigerator door. For a long moment, she studied the contents. It was easy to understand why so many humans turned to food for comfort. A pan of something dipped in chocolate was bound to improve any situation.</p><p>\u201cI had hope until Roy threw out her letter,\u201d Mercy said. \u201cWithout reading it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHow could he?\u201d Shirley asked, although the question was rhetorical. \u201cI thought humans were curious about things.\u201d That was a characteristic they shared with angels.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure he was tempted,\u201d Shirley said, sadness weighting her words. \u201cHowever, his fear was even stronger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was afraid?\u201d Goodness was unable to decipher human reasoning. \u201cOf what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf changing his mind,\u201d Shirley explained. \u201cHe knew if he read Julie\u2019s letter, he might be swayed. He couldn\u2019t let that happen. He couldn\u2019t hold on to his anger if he allowed himself to feel her love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut love is what he needs!\u201d</p> <p>Goodness wanted to weep with frustration. Shirley was right. Roy had closed himself off from love, even though he needed it, even though he wanted it. He equated love with pain. Opening his heart made him vulnerable, and he couldn\u2019t risk that after what his father and Aimee had done.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d so hoped for a better outcome,\u201d Shirley murmured forlornly, \u201cespecially for Anne\u2019s sake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnne,\u201d Goodness repeated, remembering Shirley\u2019s previous connection to Roy\u2019s mother. She studied the former Guardian Angel and detected a suspicious smile in her eyes. Quickly Shirley looked away.</p><p>\u201cShirley,\u201d Goodness pressed, certain now that her friend was up to something, \u201cyou\u2019re holding out on us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShirley?\u201d Mercy joined in. \u201cWhat did you do?\u201d</p><p>A giggle escaped, followed by another. \u201cI made a quick trip to New York, and...well, you\u2019ll see soon enough.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTell us!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd ruin the surprise?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes it have to do with Roy and Julie?\u201d</p><p>The laughter in Shirley\u2019s eyes faded. \u201cSorry, no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith Anne?\u201d</p><p>The humor was back and she nodded. \u201cAll in good time, my friends, all in good time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut what are we going to do about Roy and Julie?\u201d Even with the clock ticking away the last hours, Goodness refused to give up. Somehow or other, they had to accomplish their goal.</p><p>\u201cThat letter could always find its way back into his life,\u201d Goodness suggested. Of course, that might entail a bit of detective work...</p> <p>\u201cI will serve the Lord with my whole heart,\u201d Mercy said, \u201cbut I am not digging around in someone\u2019s garbage. That just isn\u2019t me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou would if it meant we could answer this prayer request, wouldn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Mercy looked uncertain. With her arms crossed, she cocked her head to one side and shrugged. \u201cWell...maybe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen let\u2019s get to it,\u201d Goodness said with renewed hope. \u201cWe\u2019ll find the letter, and we\u2019ll make sure he reads it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow are we going to do that?\u201d Shirley asked.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll figure it out when the time comes,\u201d Mercy assured her. \u201cYou can\u2019t expect us to have all the answers, can you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t expect all the answers,\u201d Goodness said, \u201cbut one answer would be nice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy make things easy?\u201d Mercy asked pertly.</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d</p><p>With renewed purpose the three hurried to Roy\u2019s condo. This was their last chance, and they had to make it work.</p><p>Roy picked up the remote control and automatically flipped through the channels. He didn\u2019t stay on any one for more than a few seconds. His patience was nonexistent, and his irritation mounted by the minute. Roy didn\u2019t understand why he felt like this. He should be thrilled. His company had just had its best year to date. When any number of dot-com businesses were fast becoming dot-gone businesses, his own was thriving. Money and happiness, however, didn\u2019t seem to be connected.</p><p>Roy had dreaded spending Christmas with his mother. Being continually reminded of everything she\u2019d lost in the divorce was too much for him, especially during the holiday season. Pretending was beyond him. Now she was in New York with her college friend and he could do as he pleased.</p><p>Only nothing pleased him.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you do in other years?\u201d he asked himself out loud.</p><p>Work had dominated his life for so long that he had no idea how to relax. Christmas Eve should be special in some way, except it wasn\u2019t. If he was with Julie, it would be...He refused to think about Julie. She was out of his life and he was out of hers. Good. That was exactly how he wanted it.</p><p>With nothing on television to intrigue him, Roy sat down at his computer. Because he felt he should know what was going on in the world, he left the local news channel playing in the background. He decided to surf the Internet. Maybe he\u2019d get so absorbed investigating Web sites that the evening would vanish without his realizing where all those hours had gone; it had happened often enough before. Then he could forget that it was Christmas Eve, forget he was alone.</p><p>That didn\u2019t seem to work, either.</p><p>No Web site interested him for more than a few minutes.</p><p>\u201cA Christmas story of generosity that\u2019s guaranteed to touch everyone\u2019s heart,\u201d the newscaster said from behind him. \u201cDetails after a word from our sponsors.\u201d</p><p>Roy was in no mood to be cheered by anyone\u2019s generosity. He turned around to reach for the remote so he could switch off the TV. Love and goodwill were not in keeping with his current mood.</p><p>The remote was missing.</p><p>It had been on the coffee table just a moment ago and now it was nowhere in sight. He started lifting papers and cushions in his search, but he always kept it in the same place on the coffee table. It was gone.</p><p>A sentimental commercial about a college student arriving home on Christmas Eve began to play. It was a sappy ad, meant to tug at the heartstrings. Roy had never liked it. He groaned and renewed his search for the remote.</p><p>Then the female newscaster was back. \u201cTonight we have the story of a single gift of twenty-five thousand dollars donated anonymously at a Salvation Army bell station.\u201d</p><p>The scene changed to one outside a local shopping mall. Cars whizzed past as the camera zoomed toward a lone figure standing in front of a big red pot. Dressed in his overcoat and muffler, a scarf tied around his neck, the volunteer diligently rang his bell, reminding everyone that there were others less fortunate this Christmas.</p><p>Roy continued his search with one eye on the television screen. He knew he should simply lean over and hit the power switch, but for some reason, he didn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cAn anonymous donor came up to Gary Wilson yesterday afternoon and slipped a cashier\u2019s check for twenty-five thousand dollars into his collection canister. This is the largest single donation a Salvation Army bell ringer has ever received in our area.\u201d</p><p>Roy froze, rooted to the spot, his quest for the TV remote forgotten.</p><p>\u201cGary, can you tell us anything about the person who gave you that check?\u201d the reporter asked, shoving a microphone in front of the volunteer\u2019s face.</p><p>The poor man looked like a deer caught on the freeway, lights coming at him from every direction. \u201cNo,\u201d he finally blurted. \u201cI didn\u2019t notice anyone who seemed rich enough to give away that kind of money.\u201d</p><p>The reporter spoke into the microphone again. \u201cThat money will go a long way toward making this Christmas a happy one for a lot of community families, won\u2019t it?\u201d Once more she thrust the microphone at the Salvation Army volunteer.</p><p>\u201cI think it was a woman,\u201d Gary Wilson said. \u201cIt was about the middle of my shift, I\u2019d say. Things were moving pretty briskly and then this tall gal came up.\u201d He paused. \u201cShe said Merry Christmas, and she smiled. But I don\u2019t know if it was her or not. It could\u2019ve been.\u201d He punctuated his comments with a shrug. \u201cOr maybe not. Could\u2019ve been that short fellow who wouldn\u2019t look me in the eye. Real short, he was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cElf-size?\u201d the reporter asked with a grin.</p><p>Gary nodded. \u201cYup, elf-size.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, it looks like Santa won\u2019t have to work nearly as hard in the Seattle area this year. Back to you, Jean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, Tracy,\u201d the female announcer said.</p><p>Roy sank onto the edge of his plush leather sofa. It was Julie; she had to be the \u201ctall gal\u201d the volunteer had mentioned. This was a calculated move on her part. She\u2019d...</p><p>His thoughts ground to a halt. Julie hadn\u2019t done it for the publicity. With a cashier\u2019s check, she wasn\u2019t expecting to be honored for the donation. The truth was, Roy couldn\u2019t prove it\u2019d been her. But it seemed more than a coincidence that the donation was the same amount as the check he\u2019d given her.</p><p>Leaning back, he rubbed his face, then glanced at the coffee table. To his utter astonishment, there sat the remote control. He looked again, harder. Nah, couldn\u2019t be. He leaned forward again. It hadn\u2019t been there a moment ago. That wasn\u2019t the only thing on the coffee table, either.</p><p>Julie\u2019s letter lay there, right in front of him.</p><p>This was the envelope he\u2019d recently discarded. The envelope with his name carefully written on the front in Julie\u2019s smooth and even cursive hand.</p><p>Roy gasped, leaped up and quickly looked around. Something very strange was happening.</p><p>He\u2019d been working too hard, he decided, brushing the hair away from his forehead. He left his hand there as he tried to reason this out in his troubled mind.</p><p>The pressure had become too much for him. That was it. What hadn\u2019t made sense a few minutes ago now seemed perfectly logical.</p><p>The envelope almost glowed, daring him to open it. When he\u2019d originally received the letter, the temptation to read it had been almost overwhelming. But instead, Roy had tossed it in the garbage as soon as he got home. Then, because he couldn\u2019t get it out of his mind, he\u2019d carried the garbage from his kitchen to the chute in the utility room. The chute deposited all garbage in a Dumpster in the basement.</p><p>Yet here was the letter, back in his possession.</p><p>\u201cObviously I should read it,\u201d he muttered to himself, wondering if he should look for the phone number of a psychiatrist first. This couldn\u2019t be happening. But it was.</p><p>Sinking back onto the couch, he picked up the letter. He didn\u2019t want to read it, yet from the first word on, he felt compelled to continue. His cynicism gradually eroded as he recognized her sincerity with every sentence. He understood her exasperation with him and respected the honesty and integrity that underlined her actions, her beliefs. The most powerful of all the emotions that flowed through him as he read her letter was love. Her love.</p><p>Earlier, she\u2019d told him she hadn\u2019t written that she loved him, but he felt it in every word.</p><p>After reading the letter once, he set it aside and tried to take in everything she\u2019d said. Then he read it again, more slowly this time, sometimes rereading a sentence twice. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cShe\u2019s right,\u201d he whispered. \u201cShe\u2019s so right.\u201d He\u2019d been given this chance. The most wonderful gift of his life was within his grasp and he was rejecting it. He could allow what Aimee had done to taint the rest of his days, or he could move forward.</p><p>Christmas Eve, and he was alone. But he didn\u2019t have to be.</p><p>He could spend Christmas with Julie.</p><p>Christmas and every other day.</p> <p>A surge of joy rushed through him. He wasn\u2019t waiting a moment longer.</p><p>Twenty-Five</p><p>For her father\u2019s sake, Julie was trying to make this first Christmas without her mother as cheerful as she could. For dinner on Christmas Eve, she served the meal Darlene had always prepared. A big pot of homemade clam chowder simmered on the stove and a loaf of freshly baked bread waited on the counter. Although she didn\u2019t have much of an appetite, Julie was determined to sit down, smile and enjoy their evening together. Emily had phoned earlier, and Julie had done her best to sound optimistic. She didn\u2019t know how well she\u2019d succeeded.</p><p>\u201cSomething smells mighty good,\u201d her father said as he stepped into the kitchen. He lifted the lid from the large pot and gave Julie a smile. \u201cYour mother\u2019s recipe?\u201d</p><p>She nodded.</p> <p>Her father closed his eyes and breathed in the scent of the chowder. \u201cI feel that she\u2019s with us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do, too, Dad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor the first time since she died, I feel her presence more profoundly than I do her absence. I\u2019m sure it has to do with Christmas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure it does, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was such a Christmas person.\u201d</p><p>Her father wasn\u2019t telling Julie anything she didn\u2019t know. The house was always beautifully decorated for the holidays. Her mother spent endless hours seeing to every detail. Even her Christmas cards were special\u2014because she wrote individual messages to each person. She baked and cooked for weeks beforehand, and every December she presented their neighbors with gifts of homemade cookies and candies. Julie had made an attempt to do the same, but she didn\u2019t have the time, the patience or the skill to match her mother\u2019s efforts. Her lone batch of fudge was a humbling experience and she ditched it before her father got home to see what a mess she\u2019d made.</p> <p>\u201cEverything\u2019s ready,\u201d she announced. Instead of eating in the kitchen as they routinely did at night, they were using the dining room. After dinner and the dishes, they\u2019d leave for Christmas Eve services at church.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll bring out the chowder,\u201d her father said as the doorbell rang.</p><p>Julie frowned. \u201cAre you expecting anyone?\u201d</p><p>Her father shook his head. \u201cI\u2019ll get it.\u201d</p><p>While her father dealt with whoever was at the door, Julie ladled soup into the tureen her mother had saved for special occasions. The bread, a recipe handed down for more than three generations, was a holiday tradition, too. Julie remembered how her mother had called Emily and Julie to the kitchen table and taught them the importance of kneading the dough. They\u2019d loved doing it.</p><p>\u201cIt appears we have company,\u201d her father said from behind her.</p><p>Julie turned around. Had there been anything in her hands, it would have crashed to the floor.</p><p>Roy Fletcher stood beside her father, his arms full of gifts, which he arranged under the tree.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll set an extra place at the table,\u201d Dean said as though it was a foregone conclusion that Roy would be joining them.</p><p>Julie was cemented to the floor. Had her life depended on it, she couldn\u2019t have moved. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d she choked out.</p><p>\u201cI read your letter.\u201d</p><p>Better late than never, she wanted to tell him, but speaking had become rather difficult.</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was a beautiful letter.\u201d</p><p>Her father walked past Julie. \u201cThe two of you can sort everything out after dinner. You will stay, won\u2019t you, Roy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Thank you, Dean....\u201d He nodded, although the entire time he was speaking, his eyes were on Julie.</p><p>\u201cCome on.\u201d Her father urged them toward the dining room.</p><p>As if in a dream, Julie left the kitchen. Roy held out her chair for her, and her father set the soup tureen in the middle of the table, moving aside the centerpiece of fir branches and silver bells Julie had created. He hurried back to the kitchen for the bread. When they were all gathered at the table, they joined hands for grace.</p><p>Julie bowed her head and closed her eyes. She\u2019d prayed for this, prayed Roy would feel her love, prayed he\u2019d know she was sincere. Still, there was a sense of unreality about tonight. Her father\u2019s words, asking God to bless their meal, barely registered in her mind. At the sound of his \u201cAmen,\u201d she lifted her head to discover Roy watching her. Her breathing stopped at the unmistakable love she saw in his eyes. She didn\u2019t understand what had happened to him, but whatever it was had completely changed him. Or, more accurately, made him the person he was meant to be. The person he really was.</p><p>\u201cYour coming by is a pleasant surprise,\u201d her father said conversationally as he stood and reached for Roy\u2019s bowl.</p><p>\u201cI should\u2019ve called first,\u201d Roy said, and his gaze, which had been on Julie, moved to her father. \u201cI hope it isn\u2019t an imposition.\u201d His eyes returned to her.</p><p>\u201cNot at all. Julie made plenty. You do like clam chowder, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, very much.\u201d Again his eyes briefly left her. \u201cJulie and I had clam chowder the first time we went to dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt an old college hangout of Roy\u2019s,\u201d she added.</p><p>Roy smiled.</p><p>\u201cJulie baked the bread this evening,\u201d her father said proudly as he reached for Julie\u2019s soup bowl next. \u201cIt\u2019s her mother\u2019s recipe. She did an excellent job of it, too.\u201d</p><p>Julie passed the bread basket to Roy.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s an old German recipe. Her mother was of German ancestry,\u201d Dean went on to explain.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure it\u2019s excellent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is,\u201d her father said. \u201cJulie\u2019s mother was an exceptional woman.\u201d He ladled soup into his own bowl and then sat down.</p><p>Her hands shaking, Julie offered Roy the butter.</p><p>Her father apparently wasn\u2019t finished. \u201cDarlene used to say it was a couple\u2019s duty to keep their eyes open, their ears open, their hearts open and their mouths shut.\u201d He laughed robustly.</p><p>Roy grinned.</p><p>Julie was following that bit of advice at the moment. She couldn\u2019t possibly have carried on a civil conversation. All she could think about was the fact that Roy was in her home, having Christmas Eve dinner with her father and her. As far as she was concerned, this was nothing short of a miracle.</p><p>\u201cI hope you\u2019ll attend church services with us later.\u201d Her father turned to Roy.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d be delighted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy wife had a lot of wonderful sayings,\u201d he murmured, reverting to his previous topic. \u201cShe said interruptions were simply God\u2019s appointments.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI interrupted you this evening,\u201d Roy said.</p><p>\u201cNow, Dad...\u201d All this talk about her mother and God would probably confuse Roy. Christmas Eve was not the time to eulogize her mother. Then it occurred to Julie that her father needed to do this, that he wanted to remember and honor her by sharing her favorite expressions.</p><p>\u201cPlease go on,\u201d Roy said. \u201cI\u2019d like to hear some of the other things your wife said.\u201d</p><p>Her father grinned and put down his spoon. \u201cMy wife firmly believed that God sends pain into our lives for a reason.\u201d</p><p>Roy frowned. \u201cThat\u2019s an interesting thought. Most people don\u2019t think of God in terms of pain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Dean said. \u201cNow, Roy, I realize from what Julie\u2019s told me that you\u2019ve seen more than your fair share of emotional turmoil. I don\u2019t mean to discount that, but my wife always said we should lean into the pain, instead of running away from it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike driving into a skid in order to correct it?\u201d Roy suggested.</p><p>\u201cExactly,\u201d Dean crowed. \u201cWe have to use the experience. We can become either bitter or better.\u201d</p><p>Julie wasn\u2019t sure where her father was going with this conversation. \u201cDaddy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe only calls me that when she\u2019s upset.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, Julie. I want to hear this,\u201d Roy said.</p><p>\u201cGood, because I think it\u2019s something you need to hear.\u201d Her father had given up all pretense of eating. \u201cNow it seems to me that you\u2019re interested in my little girl.\u201d</p><p>Julie knew her cheeks must be flaming. All this spiritual talk wasn\u2019t like her father, who kept his faith private. She couldn\u2019t imagine why he was saying the things he was.</p><p>\u201cI care a great deal for Julie,\u201d Roy confessed.</p><p>Julie nearly dropped her spoon. As it was, the utensil clattered against the china bowl.</p><p>Roy glanced at her. \u201cUnfortunately, it took me a while to understand what I was doing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo it seems.\u201d Her father gestured grandly with a piece of bread. \u201cBut all\u2019s well that ends well, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d He turned to meet Julie\u2019s eyes. \u201cYou\u2019re the one who anonymously donated that twenty-five thousand dollars to the Salvation Army, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Julie went very still. \u201cIs that why you\u2019re here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but it was a catalyst. The bell\u2014so to speak\u2014that woke me up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did you know?\u201d She\u2019d done it anonymously for a reason.</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t seen the news, have you?\u201d</p><p>Julie was aghast. \u201cIt was on the evening news?\u201d</p><p>\u201cChannel Four.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI watched Channel Four earlier and didn\u2019t see anything about it,\u201d her father said.</p><p>\u201cIt was there,\u201d Roy insisted. \u201cThey interviewed a man by the name of Gary Wilson, a volunteer stationed at the Alderwood Mall.\u201d He looked at Julie. \u201cIt was you who gave that check to the Salvation Army, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>For a second, she considered misleading him, then decided against it. \u201cWould it matter?\u201d</p><p>Roy thought for a moment, then shook his head. \u201cNo. I don\u2019t care what you did with the money because I know in my heart that you love me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThose are mighty sweet words,\u201d her father said, grinning from ear to ear.</p><p>\u201cDad!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow, Roy, you say you care for Julie. Does that mean you love her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDad!\u201d she cried again. She couldn\u2019t believe that her father would ask such a thing, especially with her sitting there.</p><p>\u201cI love her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d her father said nonchalantly, as if men regularly talked this way at the dining room table.</p><p>Roy chuckled, but Julie spoke before he could say anything else. \u201cWould you two kindly involve me in this conversation?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s right,\u201d Roy said.</p><p>\u201cNow I\u2019ll be the one to say those are some mighty sweet words,\u201d Julie muttered. It was the first time she could remember Roy admitting she was right about anything.</p><p>\u201cI should warn you,\u201d her father said, leaning toward him. \u201cShe\u2019s got a stubborn streak.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI know all about it,\u201d Roy whispered back.</p><p>Julie rolled her eyes. \u201cWho are you calling stubborn?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d her father said. \u201cEnough squabbling. Now if you two will excuse me, I\u2019ll get ready for church.\u201d</p><p>Julie didn\u2019t stop him although there was at least an hour before they needed to leave. She heard him turn on the radio in his room, presumably to give them greater privacy.</p> <p>All of a sudden Julie and Roy were sitting at the dining room table alone. She wanted to remind him of his claim that he wasn\u2019t interested in love\u2014and then remembered her mother\u2019s saying about keeping her ears open and her mouth shut. Good advice, and once again she planned on taking it.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have anything you want to say?\u201d Roy asked, sounding uncharacteristically hesitant.</p><p>\u201cI was about to ask you the same thing.\u201d</p><p>Roy took her hand and clasped it tightly. \u201cThis might not make a whole lot of sense, but I feel as though I got specific orders to come here tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOrders from whom? Your mother?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo...I have no idea who sent me, but I know beyond a doubt that I was supposed to be here.\u201d</p><p>Her heart began to beat faster. \u201cDid you want to come?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore than anything, Julie, only I didn\u2019t realize it. I was doing what your mother said\u2014running away from the pain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, how I wish you\u2019d known her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I already do,\u201d he said. \u201cI know you, Julie, and I know your heart is good and that you have a gift for reaching out to others.\u201d</p><p>She looked away, uncomfortable with his compliments.</p> <p>\u201cI know you aren\u2019t influenced by money and that I can trust you with my heart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour heart?\u201d she repeated, her voice low and unsteady.</p><p>\u201cI once asked you to move in with me.\u201d</p><p>Her throat started to close again, and she found it almost impossible to speak. \u201cIs that why you\u2019re here?\u201d she managed.</p><p>\u201cNo. I can say that was a mistake. I want to make you a permanent part of my life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre...are you asking me to marry you?\u201d</p><p>His fingers tightened around hers. \u201cThat would be a good place to start.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean there\u2019s more?\u201d</p> <p>He chuckled. \u201cAbout fifty years more, I\u2019d say. Longer, if we\u2019re lucky. I\u2019d like to begin our new life soon. Is that all right by you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cChildren?\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cA dozen, at least.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRoy, be serious!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, two or three, whatever we decide when the time comes. My mother\u2019s anxious for grandchildren and I wouldn\u2019t dream of disappointing her.\u201d</p><p>This was all happening so fast Julie couldn\u2019t keep up.</p><p>A strangled ringing sound startled her, and she looked around.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s my cell,\u201d Roy said, removing it from his pocket. He flipped the tiny phone open and glanced at the number. \u201cMy mother. I wonder why she\u2019s calling me so late. It\u2019s after eleven in New York.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnswer it,\u201d Julie said. \u201cWe have some great news.\u201d</p><p>He looked at her expectantly.</p><p>Julie smiled. \u201cYou can tell her I\u2019ve accepted your marriage proposal.\u201d</p><p>Roy\u2019s eyes were warm and loving as he reached for her with one hand, pushing the talk button on his cell phone with the other.</p><p>This was the most wonderful Christmas Eve of her life, and Julie gave silent thanks.</p><p>Was it a coincidence that \u201cHark the Herald Angels Sing\u201d began to play on the radio at that very moment?</p><p>Twenty-Six</p><p>\u201cRoy! Oh, Roy!\u201d Anne was so excited she could hardly speak. \u201cIn a million years you won\u2019t believe what\u2019s happened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have some pretty incredible news, too,\u201d he said.</p><p>Despite her preoccupation with her own joy, Anne could hear the happiness in her son\u2019s voice. \u201cTell me,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cJulie has agreed to be my wife.\u201d</p><p>Tears of joy instantly pricked Anne\u2019s eyes. This was much more wonderful than she\u2019d dared dream. \u201cThat\u2019s marvelous!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe haven\u2019t set a date, but I know it\u2019ll be soon. I\u2019ve been waiting my entire life for her, Mom. I can\u2019t believe what a fool I was all this time. You must have wanted to throw up your hands.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI prayed that God would send a special woman into your life,\u201d she whispered. Her prayer had been heartfelt, but she\u2019d almost given up hope. Coping with her own problems, struggling to keep her head above water financially, Anne had tried hard to help her son. It had seemed hopeless for so long, she\u2019d lost confidence that any woman was capable of touching his heart. And then he\u2019d met Julie....</p><p>\u201cLet me put her on the phone,\u201d Roy said.</p><p>\u201cYes, please.\u201d Anne felt so full of happiness she was practically overwhelmed. So much good news, and all at once.</p><p>\u201cAnne...\u201d Julie\u2019s tentative voice came over Anne\u2019s cell phone.</p><p>\u201cJulie, Merry Christmas!\u201d Anne burst out. \u201cRoy gave me this phone for Christmas, and you\u2019re the first call I\u2019ve made on it. I always thought of them as a nuisance, but tonight it\u2019s worth its weight in gold. I understand my son\u2019s finally come to his senses and asked you to marry him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe did and it didn\u2019t take me long to answer him, either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to be a beautiful bride and exactly the wife he needs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you\u2014I certainly plan to try. I feel so blessed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, me, too,\u201d Anne said fervently.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll give the phone back to Roy now.\u201d</p><p>Anne could hear soft, loving sounds as the phone was transferred back to her son. \u201cAll right, Mother,\u201d Roy said, \u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re using your new cell. Now what\u2019s your news?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t believe this,\u201d she said again, and because she couldn\u2019t help it, she broke into giggles.</p><p>\u201cThen tell me,\u201d Roy said.</p><p>\u201cMy painting of the angel sold.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCongratulations! From the excitement in your voice, it must\u2019ve been for a lot of money. The last I heard, you thought it might go for as much as twenty-five thousand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTry a hundred and fifty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA bidding war drove up the price, but that\u2019s not the best part.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the best part? What could possibly be better than that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Roy, just you wait until I tell you who bought the painting.\u201d She paused, relishing the justice of it. \u201cThe check was written by Burton Fletcher. Your father.\u201d</p><p>Her announcement was followed by shocked silence.</p><p>\u201cWhy would Dad write you a check for that amount of money?\u201d Roy finally asked.</p><p>\u201cFirst,\u201d Anne explained, \u201che didn\u2019t know it was me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSince I paint under the name of Mary Fleming, your father had no way of knowing that the woman who painted the angel was his ex-wife. Marta knew, of course, and she already had someone else interested, so she was able to use the other party to drive up the price.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo back to the beginning,\u201d Roy said.</p><p>\u201cMarta\u2014you remember my college friend who runs an art gallery here in New York?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, yes, of course I remember her. You\u2019re staying at her place. Go on with your story.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, when she shipped the painting to New York and hung it in the gallery, she put up a sign that said it wasn\u2019t for sale. But then Aimee came into the gallery and fell in love with it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAimee,\u201d Roy repeated. \u201cWhen she stopped by the office, she\u2019d obviously been on a recent shopping spree. And, of course, there was her bargain with Dad\u2014a phone call from me in exchange for...your painting, as it turns out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe wanted my angel in the worst way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Dad actually forked out that kind of money to buy it for her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe did,\u201d Anne said, unable to keep the laughter from her voice. \u201cBut he had no idea he was giving me a big chunk of what I should\u2019ve gotten in the first place. He cheated me with the divorce settlement and now...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou always did say that what goes around comes around,\u201d Roy said, sounding as satisfied as she was. \u201cI think that painting must be very special.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, Roy. I do, too, but I never dreamed it would sell for such an outrageous amount of money.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes Dad know yet?\u201d her son asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not telling him.\u201d Although it was tempting to do so, Anne had resisted. \u201cI suspect that sooner or later he\u2019ll discover it on his own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I suppose he will. I\u2019d love to be a fly on the wall when he figures it out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s more good news,\u201d Anne said, unable to contain herself. \u201cMarta said she could sell as many angel paintings as I want to paint. There seems to be a real demand for them now. I think I\u2019ve finally found my niche.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s great, Mom.\u201d</p><p>Her son seemed genuinely pleased for her. \u201cI\u2019m planning to paint one for you and Julie as a wedding gift. It seems to me that we\u2019ve all had angels watching over us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019d like that very much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMarta and her husband\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought they\u2019d separated.\u201d</p><p>Anne had nearly forgotten. With so much else going on, her friend\u2019s news had slipped her mind. \u201cJack and Marta are back together. Jack was seeing someone else, but apparently it wasn\u2019t as serious as Marta assumed. They\u2019re going to a counselor and are determined to work on their marriage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad for them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLife just seems to get better and better,\u201d Anne said, sighing softly, tired now and elated at the same time.</p><p>\u201cYes, it does,\u201d her son agreed. \u201cBetter and better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe did it!\u201d Goodness was thrilled. Leaping up and down in the choir loft at the First Christian Church of North Seattle, she didn\u2019t even try to sit still. The church was rapidly filling as families streamed in from the vestibule.</p><p>Roy, Julie and Dean walked into the crowded sanctuary and found seats near the front. They were too late to find a pew in the back, where Dean preferred to sit.</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t the altar lovely?\u201d Shirley said with a sigh, pointing toward the poinsettias arranged around the table that held the Advent wreath. All four candles were lit, their flames flickering, little dances of delight.</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t believe it if I hadn\u2019t seen Roy propose to Julie with my own eyes,\u201d Mercy said contentedly. \u201cI have to tell you, scenes like this always get to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo they now,\u201d Gabriel said from behind them.</p><p>Shirley, Goodness and Mercy whirled around to face the Archangel. Goodness held her breath, convinced that Gabriel was going to chastise them for their earthly manipulations. They\u2019d become far more involved in the things of the world than ever before, but surely Gabriel had made allowances on their behalf, knowing the challenge they\u2019d had with Roy. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDid you see Roy and Julie?\u201d Goodness pointed. The proof of their success was sitting directly below.</p><p>\u201cI did,\u201d Gabriel said, and nodded approvingly. \u201cI must say you three used some unconventional methods to fulfill your mission. Tell me, what did Roy learn from all this?\u201d</p><p>A prayer couldn\u2019t be answered unless there was a lesson learned.</p><p>\u201cHis lesson was about love,\u201d Shirley answered. \u201cHis mother\u2019s love touched him. Her prayers for her son were heard by all of Heaven, and God sent us to show Roy that he could find love.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cVery good,\u201d Gabriel said. \u201cBut then, you always knew that, didn\u2019t you, Shirley?\u201d</p><p>The former Guardian Angel nodded. \u201cI did. Anne was such a special child. I knew she\u2019d grow up to be a special woman, and I was right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you give us a peek into the future?\u201d Mercy asked, crowding between Goodness and Shirley in an effort to gain Gabriel\u2019s attention.</p><p>\u201cYes, please.\u201d Goodness added her request.</p><p>Only a few were granted the privilege of gazing into the future, and Gabriel was one.</p> <p>\u201cTell me about Anne,\u201d Shirley pleaded.</p><p>\u201cYour Anne will continue to paint for a number of productive years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAngels?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, and landscapes. The fees she earns from the angel paintings will support her far and above what she ever imagined. She\u2019ll become well-known for her work. In the years ahead, she\u2019ll be recognized as a fine and talented artist. People will pay high prices to own one of Mary Fleming\u2019s paintings.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so pleased,\u201d Shirley said happily.</p><p>\u201cAnd to think it all started with you,\u201d Goodness said to her. The instant the words were out, she realized what she\u2019d done\u2014alerted Gabriel to the fact that Shirley had appeared to Anne. She clapped both hands over her mouth.</p> <p>Gabriel, fortunately, didn\u2019t seem to notice her slip.</p><p>\u201cWhat about Burton and Aimee?\u201d Mercy asked.</p><p>Gabriel\u2019s sigh was heavy. \u201cThey\u2019ll divorce in two years when she leaves him for another man. Burton will be stunned and hurt. He\u2019ll become something of a recluse after that. Over time, Roy and his father will reconcile and the greatest joy of his life will be his grandchildren.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry to hear his marriage to Aimee didn\u2019t turn out the way he expected.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBurton was a man who brokered misery,\u201d Gabriel reminded them. \u201cHe brought about his own unhappiness.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe never gave Anne the credit she deserved,\u201d Shirley said. \u201cHow ironic that because of him, she\u2019ll become a famous artist.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about Roy and Julie? Will they be happy?\u201d Goodness asked.</p><p>\u201cVery much so,\u201d Gabriel said, brightening. \u201cTheir marriage will be a good one. In the next five years, Julie will give birth to three children, two boys and a girl. All three will be athletic and intelligent. Their daughter, named Anne Darlene after her two grandmothers, will go on to be an Olympic swimmer. The boys will take after their father and eventually assume leadership of Fletcher Enterprises.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat about Dean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll retire soon, and then, at the age of eighty, he\u2019ll die peacefully in his sleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo he\u2019ll be joining his wife in Heaven twenty Earth-years from now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Gabriel replied. \u201cAre you satisfied now?\u201d</p><p>Shirley, Goodness and Mercy nodded.</p><p>\u201cReady?\u201d he asked. In the distance, Goodness heard the strains of the heavenly choir as the angels gathered together to sing praise to the newborn King. But before she left Earth, Goodness had to know about Anne\u2019s mother. She just had to know.</p><p>Shirley stepped close to her side. \u201cShe was an artist, too, and a wonderful mother. I always had a soft spot in my heart for Anne and wanted to work with her after her mother\u2019s death. God had other purposes for me, but He allowed me back into Anne\u2019s life for just this short time. I\u2019m very grateful.\u201d</p><p>So was Goodness.</p><p>The strains of the heavenly choir were richer and more distinct as the four of them drew closer. Ah, but this was a special night on Earth, one filled with glory and goodwill toward mankind. A night that came only once a year when God smiled down on those He loved and sent His angels to shout out the glad news.</p><p>WHERE ANGELS GO</p><p>One</p><p>The sights and sounds of Christmas were all around him. At home, the scent of evergreen mingled with ginger and spice, and multicolored lights glittered throughout the house. This was Harry Alderwood\u2019s favorite time of year. He\u2019d settled in Leavenworth, Washington, more than five decades ago, and he loved the way this town celebrated Christmas. Despite his eighty-six years and failing health, nothing could dampen his love of the season. Even sitting in Dr. Snellgrove\u2019s office, with its spindly artificial Christmas tree, waiting for what he was sure would be bad news, Harry didn\u2019t feel depressed. This appointment would probably drain him for the rest of the day, and yet it seemed pointless. He doubted there was anything left for Dr. Snellgrove to do. His heart was giving out; it was as simple as that.</p><p>Harry wasn\u2019t afraid of death. He often thought about it, especially with so many of his friends dying. He\u2019d seen death, witnessed it countless times on the beaches of Normandy and the battlefields of Europe in World War II. He\u2019d grieved when his own parents and his older brother, Ted, had passed away. He wasn\u2019t afraid, though. Maybe he should be, but why worry about the inevitable?</p><p>An exhausted young mother sat across the room, keeping her little girl entertained by reading to her. Looking at them, he found it hard to tell who needed the doctor most, mother or child. Both seemed to be suffering from bad colds. Harry was grateful for the distance between them, since his own immune system was so weak.</p><p>Harry knew this would almost certainly be his last Christmas, and that saddened him. He\u2019d always been a man of faith, and that faith had grown stronger as he grew older. Which was a natural progression, he supposed. He wondered if the angels celebrated Christmas in Heaven; he suspected they did. Harry figured he\u2019d find out soon enough. Meanwhile, he was determined to make his last Christmas on Earth as special as he could for Rosalie. Already he was thinking of what he might do to show his wife of sixty-five years how much he loved her. Leaving Rosalie. That was his one regret....</p><p>\u201cHarry Alderwood.\u201d</p><p>He was caught up in his thoughts, and the nurse had to repeat his name before he heard her. She was a young woman named Kelly Shannon\u2014or was it Shannon Kelly?\u2014but he affectionately called her Nurse Ratched. She didn\u2019t seem to mind.</p><p>\u201cHarry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cComing.\u201d He needed a moment to clamber to his feet. Sometimes he forgot that his legs weren\u2019t as steady as they used to be. Not long ago, he didn\u2019t have a problem getting out of a chair, but these days he got so winded just standing, he could barely walk. Growing old wasn\u2019t for sissies, that was for sure.</p><p>Using his cane for leverage, he slowly pulled himself upright, smiled at the young mother across from him and carefully placed one foot in front of the other. More and more, walking even a few yards was a chore. Still, he waved off Nurse Ratched\u2019s offer of assistance. He took several deep breaths and winked as he walked past her. She smiled, adjusting the holly brooch she wore on her crisp white uniform.</p><p>He liked her attention to Christmas. And he was grateful that she didn\u2019t rush him. That was the problem with people these days. They all seemed to be in a hurry, stepping around him, practically pushing him aside, in an effort to get ahead in the grocery store or the parking lot. Didn\u2019t these folks realize he was moving as fast as he could? A few years ago, he used to be just like them, trying to get someplace quickly and then, once he arrived, wondering why he\u2019d been in such a hurry.</p><p>\u201cYour color\u2019s good this morning,\u201d Nurse Ratched said as she held open the door of the examining room and waited for Harry to move inside. \u201cYou must be feeling better.\u201d</p><p>Harry never did understand why other people made assumptions about how he felt. No one really wanted the truth. Well, okay...maybe doctors and nurses did. But when it came to friends and acquaintances, he wasn\u2019t interested in discussing his health. He accepted the likelihood of illness and the certainty of death, although he didn\u2019t want to get there any sooner than necessary.</p><p>\u201cHave a chair.\u201d Dr. Snellgrove\u2019s nurse pointed to the one against the wall.</p><p>It took Harry a long time to reach that chair and sit down again.</p><p>The nurse, chattering in a friendly manner, checked his blood pressure, which was normal, took his temperature, which was also normal, and then after asking the usual questions, left the room, closing the door behind her.</p><p>Five minutes later, Dr. Snellgrove appeared. Harry still found it a bit disconcerting to have such a young doctor; Paul Snellgrove barely looked old enough to shave, let alone make life-and-death decisions. Harry had met a number of young physicians lately, both men and women. That was a good thing, in his opinion\u2014even though their youth reminded Harry of his own age. But these newly minted doctors tended to be idealistic, which he approved of, and they were up on all the latest technology, treatments and medications. The only problem was that they could be a bit unrealistic, seeing death as the enemy when sometimes, at the end of a long life or debilitating illness, it was a friend. Dr. Snellgrove wasn\u2019t like that, though. Three or four years ago, he\u2019d bought out Harry\u2019s longtime physician\u2019s practice. Harry admired the kid.</p><p>\u201cWhat can I do for you?\u201d Dr. Snellgrove asked, sitting on a stool and sliding it over so he was eye to eye with Harry.</p><p>Harry rested both hands on his cane, one on top of the other. \u201cI\u2019m having trouble breathing again.\u201d This wasn\u2019t a new complaint. It\u2019d gotten worse, though. Twice in the past week, he\u2019d woken in the middle of the night, unable to catch his breath. Both times he\u2019d thought he was dying. He hoped to go gentle and easy, in his sleep or something like that, not sitting up in bed gasping for air and frightening poor Rosalie into a panic.</p><p>The young doctor asked him a few more questions. Harry already knew the problem. His heart was tired, which might not be medical terminology but seemed pretty accurate, and sometimes it just took a brief pause. The pacemaker was supposed to help and it\u2019d worked fine for the most part...until recently.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s not much I can do for you, Mr. Alderwood, much as I hate to admit it,\u201d the physician told him. His eyes were serious as they met Harry\u2019s.</p><p>Harry appreciated that the other man didn\u2019t look away and was willing to tell him the truth. He was ready to release his hold on life. Almost ready. There was one thing he still had to accomplish, one arrangement he still had to make, and he needed enough time to do it. \u201cNo new pill?\u201d He\u2019d swallowed an entire pharmacy full now. Twenty-six prescriptions at last count\u2014not all at once, of course. Thankfully, due to his years of military service, the government helped pay the cost of those many expensive drugs.</p><p>\u201cNo, Harry, I\u2019m sorry. No miracle pills this week.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Harry sighed. He hadn\u2019t really expected there would be.</p><p>\u201cYour heart\u2019s failing,\u201d Dr. Snellgrove said. \u201cYou know that.\u201d Then he frowned. \u201cI see you\u2019re using the cane instead of the walker.\u201d</p><p>Harry hated that blasted walker. \u201cIt\u2019s at the house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHarry, it\u2019s December.\u201d The physician looked exasperated. \u201cThe last thing you need is a fracture.\u201d</p> <p>Harry dismissed Snellgrove\u2019s concern.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m well aware that I\u2019m dying,\u201d he said, leaning toward the other man. \u201cWhat I\u2019d like is your best guess of how much time I\u2019ve got.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy is it so important to know?\u201d the doctor asked.</p><p>\u201cBecause of Rosalie,\u201d Harry murmured. \u201cShe\u2019s forgetful and gets confused now and then, and I don\u2019t think she\u2019ll do well living on her own.\u201d Harry worried about his wife constantly. Even their children didn\u2019t realize how bad Rosalie\u2019s memory had gotten in the last few years.</p><p>Paul Snellgrove reached for Harry\u2019s chart and glanced at the top page. \u201cYou\u2019re still in your own home, right?\u201d</p> <p>Harry nodded. He and Rosalie had raised their two beautiful daughters in that house on Walnut Avenue. Lorraine and Donna now lived and worked in Seattle and had raised their families there. One or the other came home at least once a month, sometimes more often; his sons-in-law were frequent visitors, as well. Kenny, Lorraine\u2019s husband, had strung all their Christmas lights last week and brought him and Rosalie a tree. Oh, yes, Harry knew how fortunate he was in his family, how blessed.</p><p>And his grandkids...The four grandkids were adults themselves now and making their own way in life. Being around his grandchildren did Harry\u2019s heart more good than any of those pills he gulped down every morning.</p><p>\u201cI want to move Rosalie into Liberty Orchard, that new assisted-living complex, before I die,\u201d he explained. \u201cIt\u2019s the best solution for her. For everyone.\u201d</p><p>The physician nodded. \u201cAnything stopping you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean other than Rosalie?\u201d Harry joked. \u201cI just need to convince her. That might take some doing, so I have to know how much time you think I\u2019ve got.\u201d</p><p>The young physician calmly appraised him.</p> <p>His daughters agreed their mother would need help sooner or later, but didn\u2019t feel the urgency Harry did. They didn\u2019t understand that he couldn\u2019t leave this life comfortably unless he knew Rosalie would be properly looked after.</p><p>\u201cTell me straight up,\u201d Harry insisted. \u201cIt shouldn\u2019t be that difficult to tell an old man how much time he\u2019s got left.\u201d He let the challenge hang between them.</p><p>The physician rolled the stool back a couple of inches and made a gesture that was more revealing than anything he might have said. \u201cHarry, I\u2019m not God, so I don\u2019t know for sure,\u201d he murmured, \u201cbut I\u2019ll be honest if that\u2019s what you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do,\u201d he confirmed.</p><p>Dr. Snellgrove slowly exhaled. \u201cThe truth is, you could go at any time.\u201d</p><p>The words rattled Harry. That wasn\u2019t what he\u2019d expected to hear. He\u2019d assumed he had a couple of months, possibly until spring. Maybe he\u2019d even last until summer. He took a minute to absorb the reality of his situation, then nodded and said, \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>As if he feared he might have said too much, the physician launched into a lengthy explanation of cardiac rhythms and stenosis and congestive heart failure.</p><p>Most of his words slid off Harry; instead, the thought of dying reverberated in his head. When would it happen? Would he have time to arrange for Rosalie\u2019s care?</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t overtax yourself. Use your walker,\u201d Dr. Snellgrove was telling him.</p><p>\u201cI will,\u201d Harry promised.</p><p>\u201cRest as much as you can,\u201d the doctor went on. \u201cAnd, Mr. Alderwood\u2014Harry\u2014you\u2019ll have to stop driving. It\u2019s increasingly unsafe.\u201d</p><p>Harry nodded; he\u2019d already accepted that. More arrangements to make...</p><p>No problem there. Harry didn\u2019t have the energy to do much more than take the simplest outing. Most days were spent in front of the television. He liked those court shows best, and the Weather Channel, too. The older he got, the more important the weather seemed to be.</p><p>In Leavenworth this time of year, it was mostly cold and snowy. The stores around town counted on that snow for their tourist business, especially this close to the holidays. The entire month of December was a Christmas extravaganza here. Every weekend, there was a parade featuring an old-fashioned Father Christmas, a chubby Santa and even the Grinch, followed by a tree-lighting ceremony.</p><p>\u201cIs there anything else I can do for you?\u201d the doctor asked as Harry rose awkwardly to his feet.</p><p>\u201cYou got a new heart for me?\u201d Harry managed a grin.</p><p>The other man\u2019s face saddened. \u201cSorry.\u201d</p><p>Harry thrust out his hand. He wanted to convey his thanks for everything the doctor had done and for his honesty. \u201cMerry Christmas, Doc. And in case I don\u2019t see you again, Happy New Year.\u201d</p><p>Snellgrove shook his hand warmly. \u201cAll the best, Harry. To you and your wife.\u201d</p><p>In the waiting area the nurse handed him his coat, which hung on a peg on the wall. He wrapped the scarf Rosalie had knit him twenty-five years ago around his neck. He still wore it every winter. Rosalie was no longer knitting, which was a shame; she\u2019d been an accomplished knitter. Their kids and grandkids had been the recipients of sweaters and mittens and hats, all kinds of beautifully made things.</p><p>Time was...He paused and smiled as he placed his hat on his head. Time was...That phrase came to him more and more often these days. He waited a moment, then slipped his arms into the sleeves of his thick wool coat. It felt heavy on his shoulders, heavier than it had when he\u2019d put it on earlier that morning.</p><p>He wished Nurse Ratched a courteous \u201cMerry Christmas\u201d and prepared to leave.</p><p>Leaning on his cane, he opened the door and steeled himself against the cold before he made the short trek to his car. Like the doctor, his daughters didn\u2019t want him driving anymore or going out on his own. They were right. He\u2019d talk to them about selling the car; maybe he\u2019d call them tonight. In the meanwhile, he\u2019d drive very, very carefully.</p><p>The skies were dark and overcast, and the cold cut right through him. He climbed into the driver\u2019s seat, then started the engine. A blast of cold air hit him as he turned on the defroster. He shivered; it seemed he was always cold. According to the doctor, being cold indicated poor circulation. In other words, Harry\u2019s heart was giving out, and this was just another symptom.</p><p>With his gloved hands on the steering wheel, he waited for the windshield to defrost.</p><p>He could die anytime.</p><p>With that, another realization hit him. He had to convince Rosalie to move as soon as possible. But his wife could be a stubborn woman, and Harry knew he was going to need help.</p><p>Bowing his head, he closed his eyes. Harry believed more fervently now than ever, although he hadn\u2019t been as faithful about attending church and reading his Bible. But when he did go to Sunday services, he walked away with something he could use in his life\u2014a sense of God\u2019s benevolence and a desire to be right-minded and honorable. The Bible was filled with wisdom\u2014and some darn good stories, too. Rosalie generally went to services. The church was only a few blocks away, and every Sunday morning, his wife was there. Their next-door neighbor drove her or one of the girls did, if either happened to be visiting.</p><p>Another thing Harry didn\u2019t make a regular practice of was prayer. He regretted that because he believed God answered prayers. He didn\u2019t want to bother the Almighty with his own paltry concerns. Seeing that God was dealing with the big stuff like global warming and the problems in the Middle East, it didn\u2019t make sense to Harry that He\u2019d have time to worry about one old man. An old man afraid of what would happen to his wife after he died...Only Harry didn\u2019t know where else to turn.</p><p>The inside of the car became his church. With his head bowed and his eyes closed, he whispered, \u201cOkay, Lord, my time\u2019s getting short. I want you to know I accept that. I understand you\u2019ve got much bigger problems on this earth than mine, and better things to do than listen to an old man like me. Nevertheless, I hope you won\u2019t mind if I ask for your help.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s about Rosalie, Lord. The house is too much for her all by herself. Without me there to look after her, I\u2019m afraid she\u2019ll burn the place down because she\u2019ll forget to turn off a burner or start a flood because she forgot the bathwater was running. I know you love her even more than I do and that\u2019s a comfort. Show me how to convince her to move into that fancy new complex. Let me warn you, though, Lord, my Rosalie can be stubborn. But then, I guess you\u2019ve noticed that.</p><p>\u201cLord, when I\u2019m gone, you\u2019ll have to take care of her for me.\u201d He paused and decided he was taking up too much of God\u2019s time, so he added, \u201cAmen.\u201d</p><p>When he glanced up, the cloud cover had broken and sunshine burst upon the snow, making it shimmer with light. Harry watched it for a long moment, feeling good. The problem now rested in God\u2019s hands.</p><p>Two</p><p>Harry\u2019s prayer rose upward, higher and higher through the snow-laden branches of the evergreens. His petition to God whisked its way past the thick white clouds, carried by the warm winds of his love to the very desk of the Archangel Gabriel. There it landed.</p><p>\u201cHarry Alderwood,\u201d Gabriel muttered, turning the pages of the massive book that detailed the prayers and lives of the faithful. \u201cAh, yes, Harry.\u201d Gabriel remembered the older man. Harry didn\u2019t pray often and seemed to believe he shouldn\u2019t bother God with his petty concerns. Little did the old man know how much God liked to talk to His children, how He longed to listen to them.</p><p>Having the ear of God and sharing His love for humans, Gabriel felt tenderness for this man who was so close to making the journey from life into death. In many cases when death was imminent, the veil between Heaven and Earth was especially thin. Harry accepted that he was dying but he clung to life, fearful of leaving behind those he loved\u2014especially his wife, Rosalie.</p><p>Harry\u2019s days were few, even fewer than the old man realized, and that brought a certain urgency to his prayer. Unfortunately, Christmas was only eight days away, and Gabriel was swamped with requests.</p><p>Two prayers had now reached him, almost simultaneously, from the small Washington town of Leavenworth. The second was from Carter Jackson, a small boy who felt he could trust God more than Santa.</p><p>Carter\u2019s prayer wouldn\u2019t be any easier to answer than Harry Alderwood\u2019s. Requests like this got even more complicated at Christmastime. Heaven was busy, busy, busy. There was work to be done, prayers to be answered, angels to be assigned.</p><p>Gabriel studied the list of available Prayer Ambassadors and saw that his three favorite angels were indeed free. Shirley, Goodness and Mercy were close to his heart, but there\u2019d been problems with them in the past.</p><p>Lots of problems.</p><p>Mercy, for example, tended to become too engrossed with the things of Earth. Gabriel shook his head in a mixture of amusement and irritation. No matter how short-handed he was, he dared not let those three visit Earth again. Giving Mercy the opportunity to be around forklifts and escalators was asking for trouble. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Not once could Gabriel remember assigning her a prayer request without regretting it afterward. Okay, perhaps regret was too strong a word. Mercy always managed to straighten everything out at the last second and he had to admit, she did make him laugh. But Mercy with Harry Alderwood...</p><p>\u201cPoor Harry,\u201d Gabriel whispered.</p><p>\u201cHarry,\u201d Mercy repeated from behind him.</p><p>She had a bad habit of sneaking up on him and Gabriel did his best not to leap back in surprise. Controlling his reaction, he turned to face the Prayer Ambassador. She was the picture of innocence, wide-eyed and hopeful.</p> <p>\u201cDid I hear you mention Harry Alderwood?\u201d she asked, as her wings made small rustling sounds. This happened whenever she was excited. The mere prospect of returning to Earth had Mercy nearly breathless with anticipation.</p><p>\u201cYou did,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cIf there\u2019s any way I could be of service,\u201d Mercy volunteered, \u201cI\u2019d be more than happy to help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure you would, but there\u2019s the small matter of\u2014\u201d</p><p>Mercy interrupted him, raising her hand. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to bring up that unfortunate incident with the aircraft carrier, I want to point out that I\u2019ve repented.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cActually,\u201d Gabriel said, clearing his throat. \u201cI was thinking about the time you rerouted that 747.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>Mercy\u2019s cheeks colored, as well they should. That had been the final straw as far as Gabriel was concerned. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I can trust you back on Earth,\u201d he said pensively. But the number of available Prayer Ambassadors was limited....</p><p>\u201cPlease, please, please, give me another chance,\u201d Mercy begged, hands folded.</p><p>For all the trouble she caused, Mercy did have a certain knack for getting prayers answered. What humans didn\u2019t always grasp was that prayer requests usually required participation on their end. God liked it when His children trusted Him with their needs, but the Almighty Father welcomed human cooperation, too.</p><p>\u201cHarry\u2019s prayer just arrived,\u201d Gabriel said with some hesitation. \u201cHe knows his remaining time on Earth is brief.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t he realize he\u2019ll receive a new body once he gets to Heaven?\u201d Mercy asked, seeming surprised by the older man\u2019s reluctance to leave Earth. \u201cIt\u2019s so much better here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe knows,\u201d Gabriel said. Perhaps it would be best if he allowed her a view of Harry and Rosalie. \u201cCome and meet Harry,\u201d the Archangel invited and with one wide sweep of his arm, he whisked away the veil between Heaven and Earth. A moment later the two of them were able to look down upon the town of Leavenworth.</p><p>\u201cHarry, is that you?\u201d Rosalie called when he stepped into the house and closed the door against the bitter December wind.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s me,\u201d Harry replied in a strained voice. He felt short of breath, and his mind was full of what Dr. Snellgrove had told him. He knew Rosalie couldn\u2019t cope without him; he also knew he\u2019d have to trust that God would answer his prayer.</p><p>\u201cI have lunch ready,\u201d his wife said as he entered the kitchen.</p><p>He had little appetite, but Harry couldn\u2019t disappoint Rosalie, since she\u2019d made the effort of preparing their meal. At this stage, she only remembered a few of her favorite recipes. Almost always, they had canned soup for dinner. No doubt that was what she\u2019d made for lunch, too.</p><p>Food didn\u2019t interest Harry much anymore. He ate because it was necessary but without any real enjoyment.</p><p>Coming into the kitchen, he saw that he\u2019d guessed correctly. Rosalie had heated up soup. Two steaming bowls filled with bright red tomato soup sat on the kitchen table. What was left in the small saucepan was boiling madly on the stove. When Rosalie turned her back to bring the silverware to the table, Harry reached over and switched off the burner.</p> <p>Soon he joined his wife at the round oak table in the small alcove. They bowed their heads, and Harry murmured grace. When he finished, Rosalie smiled softly, her eyes brimming with love. \u201cHow did everything go at the doctor\u2019s, sweetheart?\u201d</p><p>Rather than worry her, Harry simply nodded. \u201cI\u2019m as fit as can be expected for a man of my age.\u201d</p><p>Rosalie looked back at him with concern. She seemed about to ask him more but changed her mind. He\u2019d told her what she wanted to hear.</p><p>\u201cIs soup all right?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s perfect.\u201d Not sure how to broach the subject of moving, Harry swallowed three spoonfuls of his lunch, then paused. This wouldn\u2019t be the first time he\u2019d brought it up\u2014far from it. He carefully set his spoon on the place mat.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s that nice Dr. Snellgrove?\u201d Rosalie asked, shakily lifting a spoonful of soup to her mouth. She helped herself to crackers from the box and crumbled them in her bowl, one cracker at a time.</p><p>\u201cI like him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do, too. Did he give you another prescription?\u201d</p><p>Harry shook his head. As it was, the visiting nurse, who stopped by the house every second day, had to use a chart to keep his medications straight.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to be fine, aren\u2019t you?\u201d his wife asked.</p><p>Harry saw that her face had tightened with fear. \u201cOf course I am. It\u2019s...it\u2019s just a matter of getting the proper rest.\u201d</p><p>She instantly relaxed. \u201cGood. I don\u2019t know what I\u2019d do without you.\u201d</p><p>Harry didn\u2019t, either. He sighed. Perhaps he should take this opportunity to introduce the subject\u2014again. \u201cI was thinking that the upkeep on the house is too much for me.\u201d Harry felt that if he described the idea of moving to assisted living as something he needed, he might have a better chance of convincing her.</p><p>Rosalie ignored the comment. Although her face had wrinkled with age, Harry saw her as he had that first time, sixty-six years ago. She\u2019d worked at the lunch counter at a Woolworth\u2019s store in Seattle. Harry had gone over from Yakima to take a short training course, shortly after he\u2019d gotten an underwriting position with the insurance company. He\u2019d worked for the same company for more than forty years.</p><p>It had been his first trip to the big city, and the crowds and noise had overwhelmed him. A friend had suggested they stop at the lunch counter for a bite to eat. One look at Rosalie, and he was completely smitten. Until then, he would\u2019ve scoffed at the very thought of love at first sight. He never did again. One look and he\u2019d fallen head over heels for his beautiful Rosalie.</p><p>\u201cHarry?\u201d</p><p>He blinked, surprised at the way he\u2019d become immersed in his memories.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re finished your lunch?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he murmured. \u201cI\u2019m not very hungry.\u201d She didn\u2019t seem to be eating much herself, he noticed.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll fix you something later,\u201d Rosalie suggested.</p><p>\u201cThat would be good.\u201d He lingered at the table. \u201cDr. Snellgrove wants me to use my walker.\u201d</p><p>Rosalie pinched her lips together. \u201cHaven\u2019t I been saying the same thing? If you fall down again, I won\u2019t be able to help you up, sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>This was a problem. A week ago, he\u2019d fallen and, struggle as he might, he couldn\u2019t get back on his feet. Rosalie had tried to help and soon they were both exhausted. As a last resort, she\u2019d phoned the fire station. They\u2019d sent out an entire crew, embarrassing Harry no end, although the firefighters couldn\u2019t have been nicer. He purposely hadn\u2019t mentioned the incident to Dr. Snellgrove. No reason to. He was fine, a bit chagrined, but no worse for wear.</p><p>With careful movements, Harry shuffled into the family room and settled down in front of the television. Rosalie carried their soup bowls to the sink and after rinsing them out, sat in her own chair, beside his.</p><p>\u201cOprah will be on soon,\u201d she informed him.</p><p>This was her way of letting him know she\u2019d be watching the talk show. Rosie liked Oprah and Dr. Phil, and while she\u2019d grown forgetful in some areas, she had no trouble remembering when her favorite shows were on. Harry hated to admit it, but he\u2019d come to enjoy them, too. The complete lack of common sense exhibited by some of the folks on those programs continued to astonish him, and he was always heartened by the occasional portrayals of heroism.</p><p>\u201cWe might think about visiting Liberty Orchard one of these days,\u201d he said, reclining in his chair. He reached for the afghan Rosalie had knit him years earlier and spread it on his lap. The cold never seemed to leave him.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t see any rush, do you?\u201d Rosalie asked.</p><p>Rather than go into what Dr. Snellgrove had told him, Harry said, \u201cLike I was saying earlier, this house is too much for me now. I don\u2019t see any reason to delay. We could put our name in, anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can, I suppose,\u201d Rosalie reluctantly agreed. \u201cBut I\u2019d rather wait until summer.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t want to alarm her and decided to put the discussion off until later. Perhaps after he\u2019d rested...</p><p>Gabriel studied Mercy. Her deep-blue eyes brimmed with compassion as she turned to him. \u201cHe\u2019s very weak.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel nodded.</p><p>\u201cHow much longer does he have?\u201d she asked, watching the tender look Rosalie sent her husband as she left her own recliner and walked over to where Harry slept. Rosalie gently tucked the hand-knit blanket around Harry\u2019s shoulders and pressed her lips against his brow.</p><p>\u201cNot long,\u201d Gabriel responded.</p><p>\u201cSurely God won\u2019t take him until after Christmas?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnfortunately, Harry will leave Earth before then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, dear. So his prayer request is urgent. Someone has to convince Rosalie to move, and quickly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut Christmas is only about a week away!\u201d</p><p>No one needed to tell Gabriel that. \u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, my.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you still interested in taking on this request?\u201d he asked, certain she\u2019d change her mind.</p><p>Mercy bit her lip, mulling over the situation. This was the most difficult request he\u2019d ever proposed.</p><p>\u201cThere can be no shenanigans this time,\u201d he warned.</p><p>\u201cNone,\u201d she said solemnly. Her gaze remained on the old couple, and the warmth and love that flowed between them.</p><p>\u201cDo you think you can help Harry?\u201d Gabriel asked, still unsure. Mercy was so easily distracted....</p><p>\u201cI can,\u201d she said confidently. She turned again to look at him and Gabriel was shocked to see tears in her eyes. Harry Alderwood had touched Mercy\u2019s heart. Gabriel couldn\u2019t hope for anything more. Mercy would do everything in her power to prepare both Harry and his wife for a life apart, for death.</p><p>Three</p><p>Beth Fischer couldn\u2019t wait to get home from her Seattle job as a paralegal for Barney, Blackburn and Buckley, one of the most prestigious law firms in the state.</p><p>The minute she walked into her small downtown condo, she logged on to the computer. As soon as she was on the Internet, she hit the key to bring up the computer game that had enthralled her for months. World of Warcraft had quickly become addictive. Six months ago, one of the attorneys at the office had casually mentioned it; he\u2019d laughingly advised his colleagues to stay away from it because of its enticing qualities. Beth should\u2019ve listened\u2014but on the other hand, she was glad she hadn\u2019t. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>While the game loaded, she hurriedly made herself a peanut-butter-and-jelly sandwich and carried it into the small office that served as a guest bedroom on rare occasions. Directly off her kitchen, it was a perfect computer room.</p><p>She sank into her comfortable office chair, tucked her shoeless feet beneath her and signed on. Her name was Borincana and she was a hunter. Her pet wolf was called Spot, not the most original name, but it had attracted the attention of a priest named Timixie, who had since teamed up with her. Both were Night Elves and together had risen to level forty.</p><p>They were unbeatable and unstoppable, a legend in the annals of online computer games\u2014in their own minds, anyway. Both of them were addicted to the game and met every evening to play, sometimes for hours. They didn\u2019t need to be online at the same time but often were.</p><p>When Lloyd, the attorney, had commented on this game, Beth had been looking for a mindless way to fill her evenings. She needed something to relax her\u2014and distract her from the fact that all her friends were getting married, one by one.</p> <p>So far, Beth had served as a bridesmaid in ten weddings. Ten. Already three of her friends were parents, and another two were pregnant. If she\u2019d enjoyed crafts, she would\u2019ve learned to knit or crochet. The truth was, Beth couldn\u2019t bear the thought of spending her evenings sitting in front of the television, creating little blankets for all those babies, when the likelihood of her marrying and having a child of her own hovered around zero.</p><p>Marriage terrified her. Been there, done that\u2014and failed miserably. Fortunately she was smart enough to realize her mistake. Some people were meant to fall in love, marry and produce the requisite two children, preferably a boy and a girl. Her younger sister, Angela, had done so in record time.</p><p>For a while, the pressure was off Beth. Recently, however, her mother had taken up the old refrain. \u201cMeet someone. Try again.\u201d Joyce Fischer hadn\u2019t been subtle about it, either.</p><p>No, thank you, Mom. Beth wasn\u2019t interested and that was all there was to it.</p><p>The World of Warcraft was the best alternative she\u2019d found to lonely nights\u2014and the best diversion from talk of marriage and babies. She\u2019d been grateful to find something that was so much fun and so involving. The bonus, of course, was Peter, her Internet partner\u2014the priest Timixie. They chatted by instant message every now and then, congratulating each other on their successes. Like her, Peter seemed to make a point of avoiding relationships.</p> <p>During the game they teamed up and traveled together, roaming the World of Warcraft landscape, and generally made a great couple\u2014in strictly virtual terms, of course. As far as Beth was concerned, her relationship with Peter via the game was as close as she was willing to get to another man.</p><p>Just when life in the alternate universe was getting interesting and another battle seemed imminent, Beth\u2019s phone rang. Groaning, she glanced at caller ID and saw that it was her mother. She ignored it and after five rings, the machine picked up.</p><p>\u201cMarybeth, I know you\u2019re there. Are you playing that blasted computer game again? This is important\u2014we need to discuss Christmas. Call me back within the hour, otherwise I\u2019ll drive over to your condo and I don\u2019t want to have to do that.\u201d</p><p>Beth cringed at the sound of her name as much as the message. She\u2019d grown up as Marybeth and had always hated it. For some reason, it reminded her of those girls on reruns of Hee Haw. Nevertheless, her mother refused to call her anything else. Beth could see she wouldn\u2019t be able to ignore the call. With a sigh, she started to log off.</p><p>Right away, Peter instant-messaged her. Where are you going?</p><p>She typed back. Sorry. My mother phoned about Christmas and I need to be the dutiful daughter.</p> <p>Peter\u2019s reply came right away. I hear you. I\u2019m being pressured, too. My parents are after me to get a life.</p><p>Beth read his comment and nearly laughed out loud. My mother said almost exactly the same thing to me.</p><p>Where do you live?</p><p>This was the most personal question he\u2019d ever asked and she hesitated before replying. Seattle.</p><p>Get out of here! I do, too.</p><p>No way! It was hard to believe they\u2019d been playing this game for nearly six months and yet they\u2019d just discovered they lived in the same city. Gotta go, she typed quickly. I\u2019ll be back in half an hour.</p><p>See you then, Peter wrote.</p><p>Beth put Borincana and Spot, her animal companion, in hiding, where they\u2019d be safe from attack, and reluctantly reached for the phone. Even as she punched the speed-dial button, she knew that the conversation would have little to do with Christmas. Her mother was trying to find out if Beth was seeing anyone.</p> <p>As if she\u2019d been sitting by the phone waiting for her call, Joyce answered on the first ring.</p><p>\u201cNo, Mother, I\u2019m not dating.\u201d Beth figured she\u2019d get to the point immediately. That way, she could bypass all the coy questions about coworkers.</p><p>\u201cWhat makes you think I\u2019d ask you something like that?\u201d her mother returned, obviously offended by her directness.</p><p>\u201cBecause you always do,\u201d Beth countered. She loved her parents and envied them their marriage. If her own had gone half as well, she wouldn\u2019t be in this predicament. She and John, her college boyfriend, had been young, barely twenty-one, and immature. Everyone had advised them to wait, but they\u2019d been too impatient, too much in love.</p><p>Within six months of the wedding, they\u2019d hated each other. Beth couldn\u2019t leave fast enough, and John felt the same. He was as eager to escape their disaster of a marriage as she was.</p><p>It was supposed to be a painless and amicable divorce. Everything had gone smoothly; she\u2019d filed because John seemed incapable of doing anything without her pestering him. If something needed to be done, she had to take responsibility because John was utterly helpless.</p><p>They couldn\u2019t afford attorneys, so they\u2019d gone through the legal documents with the assistance of a law student on campus. They had no material goods to speak of. He\u2019d kept the television and she took the bed. Still had it, in fact, but she\u2019d purchased a new mattress a couple of years ago.</p><p>What surprised Beth, what had caught her completely unawares, was the unexpected pain caused by the divorce. This wasn\u2019t like breaking up with a boyfriend, which was how she\u2019d assumed it would feel. This was failure with a capital F.</p><p>Following the divorce, she\u2019d gone to see a counselor, who\u2019d described her emotions as grief. At the time she\u2019d scoffed. She was happy to be rid of John and the marriage, she\u2019d said. Nonetheless, she had grieved and in some ways still did. It was perhaps the most intense pain she\u2019d ever experienced. It\u2019d left her emotionally depleted. Nine years later, she was unable to put her failed marriage behind her.</p><p>Twice during the divorce proceedings she\u2019d hesitated. Twice she\u2019d considered going to John and making one last effort to work it out. The problem wasn\u2019t that she\u2019d found him in bed with another woman or that he\u2019d been abusive, physically or mentally. He wasn\u2019t an addict or an alcoholic\u2014just completely irresponsible and immature. She\u2019d had enough, and in the end she\u2019d walked away. Her failure to try again was one of the things that still haunted her.</p><p>\u201cMarybeth, I was asking you about Christmas,\u201d her mother was saying.</p><p>\u201cOh, sorry, I wasn\u2019t paying attention.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI noticed,\u201d Joyce said sarcastically. \u201cYour father and I thought that instead of the big fancy dinner we do every year, we\u2019d have a potluck.\u201d</p><p>A potluck on Christmas Day? Beth didn\u2019t like the sound of that, although she understood the reasoning. Her mother spent most of the day in the kitchen and that couldn\u2019t be much fun for her. Beth decided she\u2019d do her share without begrudging the time or expense.</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you going to complain?\u201d her mother asked as if taken aback by her lack of response.</p><p>\u201cNo. Actually I was thinking I\u2019d bring the turkey and stuffing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can cook.\u201d Beth thought the question in her mother\u2019s voice bordered on insulting.</p><p>\u201cIs that so?\u201d Joyce Fischer asked. \u201cWhen did you last eat anything that didn\u2019t come from a pizza delivery place or the frozen food section at the grocery store?\u201d</p><p>Living alone, Beth didn\u2019t have much reason to stand over a stove. Not when it was convenient and easy to order takeout or grab something from the deli. Her microwave got far more use than her stove.</p><p>\u201cOkay, okay, I\u2019ll order a cooked turkey. We have to have turkey, Mom. It\u2019s tradition.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to begin a new tradition,\u201d her mother said. \u201cI want to enjoy the day with my grandkids\u2014speaking of which, when can I expect more?\u201d</p><p>Beth was amused by the transition from dinner to her absent love life in one easy breath. \u201cProbably never.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMarybeth!\u201d She seemed horrified at the prospect. \u201cYou\u2019re a beautiful woman. You need to put your divorce behind you and move on with your life. You know John has, and more power to him.\u201d</p><p>Mentioning the fact that her ex-husband had remarried was a low blow.</p><p>Lisa Carroll, a college friend of Beth\u2019s\u2014correction, acquaintance, and an unfriendly one at that\u2014had gleefully shared the news of John\u2019s marriage a couple of summers ago. Beth had taken it hard, although they\u2019d been divorced for seven years by then. John was perfectly free to try his hand at married life a second time. She was happy for him. Thrilled, even.</p><p>That was what she\u2019d tried to tell herself, but it didn\u2019t explain the depression she\u2019d sunk into afterward. For weeks she was weepy and miserable. In the back of her mind, she\u2019d held out hope that one day John would return to her. It was an utterly outlandish notion, wholly unrealistic.</p><p>\u201cI should never have told you John got married again,\u201d she said, unable to disguise the pain of her mother\u2019s words.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, dear. But you do need to move on. I was in church this week and I lit a candle for you. I asked God to send someone special into your life and I feel sure He\u2019ll answer my prayer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou lit a candle on my behalf?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI always do when I have a special prayer.\u201d</p><p>Beth rolled her eyes. \u201cYou asked God to send me a husband?\u201d She couldn\u2019t believe her mother would do this.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t make it sound like I signed you up for a dating service.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not what I meant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t there anyone who interests you?\u201d Joyce pleaded.</p><p>The desperation in her mother\u2019s voice made Beth uncomfortable. \u201cNot really,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>\u201cSomeone at work?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Beth most emphatically did not want an office romance. She\u2019d seen a couple of those go sour. After the last one, between a legal secretary and one of the partners, the law firm had set a policy against the practice of dating within the office. Which was fine with Beth, since she happened to enjoy her job and had no intention of risking dismissal.</p><p>Her gaze drifted toward the computer screen. \u201cWell, there\u2019s someone I met recently....\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is?\u201d Hope flared instantly. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>You\u2019d think Beth had just announced that she\u2019d set her wedding date.</p><p>\u201cWe met on WoW.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat ridiculous game?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Mom. I found out he lives in Seattle.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s his name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cInvite him to Christmas dinner,\u201d Joyce said promptly. \u201cI\u2019ll do the full meal.

Now, don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll downplay the fact that you don\u2019t cook. Leave everything to me.\u201d Her mother didn\u2019t even attempt to hide her delight.</p> <p>\u201cMother, no!\u201d Good grief, for all she knew, Peter was married. She didn\u2019t dare ask for fear he\u2019d assume she was interested. All right, she was interested, but only because her mother had forced her into it.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got one week to ask him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMother!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI insist.\u201d</p><p>Beth closed her eyes and before she could protest further, Joyce disconnected the line. Sighing, Beth hung up the phone. It was either arrive on Christmas Day with a man or disappoint her mother. She sighed again as she recalled that Joyce had resorted to prayer in order to find her a husband.</p><p>Beth loved her sister and she treasured little James and Bella, her nephew and niece, but Angela hadn\u2019t done her any favors by marrying the exemplary Brian and then quickly producing two perfect grandchildren.</p> <p>Trying to forget her woes, she logged back on to the game and was pleased to see that her partner was still online. She joined Peter and soon afterward he sent her a message.</p><p>How\u2019d the conversation with your mother go?</p><p>Okay. She wished she hadn\u2019t mentioned that she\u2019d be talking to her family. She was more concerned with what had happened while she was Away From the Keyboard. Did I miss anything exciting when I was AFK?</p><p>Yeah. I teamed up with level 41 Dwarf Warrior and defeated the last two Warmongers to complete the Crush-ridge quest.</p><p>Beth sat up straighter. Wow. Great going.</p><p>You should\u2019ve been here. I started pounding my chest.</p><p>You Tarzan? she joked.</p><p>Only if you\u2019re Jane, came his reply.</p> <p>Beth read the line a second time. He almost seemed to be flirting with her. Nah, he was just teasing, which they often did, bantering back and forth and congratulating each other. It would be easy to misread his intentions, and she didn\u2019t want to make more of this than warranted.</p><p>When she didn\u2019t respond to his comment, they returned to the game. Only later, when she\u2019d logged off and headed for the shower, did Beth pause to reconsider.</p><p>If Peter had been flirting, and that was a huge if, perhaps she should make an effort to learn more about him.</p><p>Beth turned on the shower. These were the thoughts of a desperate woman, she told herself grimly. Signs of someone who\u2019d sunk to a new low\u2014finding a date for Christmas Day through an online computer game.</p><p>Four</p><p>Gabriel gazed at Joyce Fischer\u2019s prayer request, which had appeared in the Book of Prayers a few days earlier. The book rested on his desk, spread open, filling up almost as quickly as he could make assignments. Joyce had prayed countless times that her daughter would finally meet the right man. Gabriel shook his head as he tapped his finger against the page. It would help if Beth was amenable to a new relationship. After her divorce, Joyce Fischer\u2019s daughter had completely closed herself off from men; this Peter, however, might be an interesting prospect.</p><p>\u201cGabriel?\u201d He heard the timid voice of Goodness behind him. Gabriel knew the minute he\u2019d assigned Mercy to Harry Alderwood\u2019s request, Mercy\u2019s usual companions wouldn\u2019t be far behind. It would be just like Shirley and Goodness to want a piece of the action, too. Far be it from them to remain in Heaven while Mercy got an assignment on Earth.</p><p>\u201cAbout Beth?\u201d Goodness pressed.</p><p>The Prayer Ambassador regarded him with imploring eyes. Eyes so blue they seemed to glow. Gabriel wasn\u2019t surprised to discover that Goodness had been reading over his shoulder. Apparently she was interested in the Beth Fischer assignment.</p><p>\u201cWhat about her?\u201d Gabriel asked, ignoring the plea in her eyes.</p><p>\u201cShe could use some help, don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll humans have fallen short,\u201d Gabriel explained, and while it was true, he took no pleasure in saying so.</p><p>\u201cWhich is why God assigned us to help.\u201d</p><p>He couldn\u2019t disagree with that.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on with Beth?\u201d Goodness asked, stepping closer to Gabriel\u2019s desk and eyeing the huge Book of Prayers.</p><p>The Archangel stepped aside so Goodness could read Joyce Fischer\u2019s entire request. He pictured Joyce in St. Alphonsus Catholic Church, kneeling by the altar rail and lighting a candle as she bowed her head and prayed for her daughter. Although Joyce had referred to grandchildren, the real desire of her heart was to see Beth happy. Joyce believed that a relationship, a marriage and family, was the way to make that happen for her daughter. Gabriel felt reasonably sure she was right.</p><p>\u201cWhat about Kevin Goodwin?\u201d Goodness asked.</p><p>Gabriel was impressed. Clearly Goodness had already done her research on Beth.</p><p>\u201cThey work together. Kevin is unattached,\u201d Goodness continued.</p><p>\u201cTrue,\u201d Gabriel murmured. He\u2019d considered Kevin himself, but apparently God had other plans for the young attorney\u2014plans that didn\u2019t include a relationship with Beth. Plus, there was the small matter of her company\u2019s policy on workplace romance, which created a further complication. \u201cPersonally, I like Peter,\u201d he said.</p><p>Goodness gave him an incredulous look. \u201cFrom that computer game Beth\u2019s hooked on? That Peter?\u201d</p><p>Gabriel nodded.</p><p>Goodness thought about it and when she spoke again, she betrayed her reservations. \u201cHe\u2019s a possibility, I guess.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel arched one of his heavy white brows. \u201cYou guess?\u201d As endearing as Goodness was, he wouldn\u2019t accept insubordination from her or any of the other Prayer Ambassadors.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t misunderstand me, I like Peter quite a bit,\u201d Goodness added hurriedly, obviously realizing she\u2019d overstepped some invisible line. She should know by now, Gabriel grumbled to himself, that he took Prayer request protocol seriously.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just that I\u2019m afraid the only way they\u2019ll ever be able to communicate is as Night Elves,\u201d she said after a moment\u2019s pause.</p><p>This produced a smile. \u201cYes, well, the computer game\u2019s a concern, but a minor one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeth likes Peter\u2014doesn\u2019t she?\u201d Goodness asked.</p><p>Gabriel had to reflect on that question carefully. \u201cShe\u2019s comfortable with him. With what she knows of him, anyway,\u201d he finally said.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a start,\u201d Goodness murmured in an uncertain voice.</p><p>\u201cYou have a problem with it?\u201d Gabriel asked, genuinely interested in her reply.</p><p>\u201cNot a problem...\u201d Goodness hesitated. \u201cI think it\u2019s a sad state of affairs that humans are resorting to relationships through the computer. There\u2019s no real intimacy\u2014but I could be wrong. I\u2019ll admit that\u2019s happened before.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel shrugged. \u201cFor some, it\u2019s simply an easier way to meet people. In fact, a person\u2019s character can be revealed in these role-playing games.\u201d He nodded sagely, pleased with his up-to-date observation. \u201cThe way Beth and Peter are able to work together as partners, for example.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose,\u201d Goodness agreed with evident reluctance. \u201cI still think it\u2019s rather sad.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel studied her. With her current attitude, he had to wonder if Goodness was the right choice for Beth.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s she doing now?\u201d Goodness asked.</p><p>\u201cShall we take a look?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease.\u201d Goodness sidled closer to the Archangel. \u201cYou are going to send me to Earth, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Those same blue eyes gazed at him expectantly. Goodness wasn\u2019t his first choice and he feared this request was too difficult for her. Another Prayer Ambassador, one with a little more experience in complicated situations, might serve better. One who wouldn\u2019t be as tempted by things of the earth. Unfortunately\u2014like Mercy\u2014Goodness had a somewhat blemished reputation when it came to her prayer assignments. But even knowing that, Gabriel found he couldn\u2019t refuse her. \u201cYou can join Mercy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, thank you,\u201d Goodness trilled, clasping her hands together. Her wings fluttered rapidly with excitement, dropping a feather or two. \u201cI won\u2019t disappoint you, Gabriel. You have my word.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m counting on that.\u201d He meant it, too. This was too important an assignment for her to bungle; it needed a delicate hand. He caught himself before warning Goodness. No, Gabriel decided, he\u2019d let her unravel the revelations about Beth all on her own. This presented a growth opportunity for Goodness\u2014and for Beth Fischer, too.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s she doing now?\u201d Goodness asked, crowding close to Gabriel in her eagerness to see Beth.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s lunchtime,\u201d Gabriel said. \u201cShe\u2019s at a small waterfront restaurant with a friend.\u201d With one sweep of his arms, Gabriel parted the veil of clouds that obscured the Earth below. At first, the view was hazy, but a few seconds later, the air cleared. Then, as though they were gazing through glass, Gabriel and Goodness saw Beth. She and her friend were seated at a table in a busy restaurant. A wreath in the nearby window was decorated with sprigs of holly and red Christmas balls.</p><p>Beth\u2019s long dark hair was parted in the middle, and she wore a soft pink cashmere sweater with gray wool pants.</p><p>\u201cShe looks very pretty,\u201d Goodness whispered.</p><p>Gabriel could only agree.</p><p>\u201cSo, what are your plans for Christmas?\u201d Heidi asked as she picked up half of the tuna-salad sandwich they were sharing.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll spend it with my parents,\u201d Beth said without any real enthusiasm. Already she was worried. Her mother had suggested\u2014no, insisted\u2014that Beth invite Peter to join them on Christmas Day. It was an unlikely scenario. After six months of impersonal conversation, she had no idea how they were going to make the transition from being WoW partners to friends to...well, dating each other. Sort of. A Christmas Day blind date\u2014with her family, yet. She grimaced.</p><p>How could she possibly convince someone she\u2019d never even seen to accompany her to one of the most important holiday functions of the year? She might as well ask for a miracle.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve drifted off again.\u201d</p><p>Beth didn\u2019t need to ask what her friend meant. She often grew quiet when something troubled her. \u201cCan I ask you a question?\u201d Beth asked, setting down her sandwich and leaning toward Heidi.</p><p>\u201cSure, anything. You know that.\u201d</p><p>Beth considered the other woman one of her best friends. She\u2019d been a member of Heidi\u2019s wedding party and was godmother to her son, Adam.</p><p>\u201cWhen you first met Sam...\u201d she began. Heidi and Sam had just begun seeing each other when Beth met her; they\u2019d now been married four years. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhen I first met Sam,\u201d Heidi repeated. \u201cDid I know I was going to fall in love with him? Is that what you want to ask?\u201d</p><p>Beth blinked. That wasn\u2019t exactly it, but close enough. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe answer is no. In fact, I thought he was a total nerd. I mean, could you imagine me married to an accountant? I found him so fussy and detail-oriented, I couldn\u2019t picture the two of us together.\u201d</p><p>It was remarkable. Heidi, her fun-loving, easygoing friend attracted to a bean counter. Yet as far as Beth could tell, they were completely happy in their relationship. They were so different; Heidi was slapdash and impulsive and, as she\u2019d said, Sam was the opposite. But where it truly mattered\u2014their feelings about marriage and family, for instance\u2014their values were the same. Recently, with Heidi\u2019s encouragement, Sam had joined a couple of his friends in a new business venture. Their firm, specializing in forensic accounting, was doing well.</p> <p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t like that with John and me,\u201d Beth murmured. \u201cWhen we first met, I was sure we were the perfect match.\u201d She swallowed hard. She didn\u2019t know why she continued to do this\u2014torturing herself with the details of her failed marriage. All it did was remind her that she simply wasn\u2019t any good at relationships.</p><p>\u201cJohn was a long time ago.\u201d</p><p>This was Heidi\u2019s gentle way of urging her to stop dragging the past into the present, and she was right. Sitting up straighter, Beth squared her shoulders. \u201cI think I might have met someone.\u201d</p><p>That immediately sparked Heidi\u2019s interest. In the last five years, she\u2019d frequently tried to introduce Beth to available men, mostly colleagues of Sam\u2019s. Beth had declined each and every time. \u201cWho did you meet? Where? When?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe met online.\u201d</p> <p>Her friend instantly brightened. \u201cYou signed up with one of those Internet dating services?\u201d Heidi had suggested this approach months earlier\u2014advice Beth had strongly rejected.</p><p>\u201cNo, we met...I mean, we haven\u2019t really met. We\u2019re partners in an online computer game.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat war thing?\u201d Heidi wrinkled her nose in distaste.</p><p>Beth nodded. \u201cWe teamed up in World of Warcraft last June. But I know next to nothing about him, other than the fact that he lives in Seattle.\u201d Even as she explained this, Beth realized it wasn\u2019t true. Peter was decisive, a characteristic she admired in a man. He was thoughtful, too. The two of them worked well together in the landscape of the game, anticipating and complementing each other\u2019s moves.</p><p>\u201cThen find out more,\u201d Heidi urged. \u201cContact him outside the game. Meet him for coffee or something.\u201d</p><p>Beth shook her head. \u201cI couldn\u2019t do that,\u201d she said automatically. And yet she had to, didn\u2019t she? Unless she was prepared to disappoint her mother for the thousandth time.</p> <p>\u201cWhy couldn\u2019t you?\u201d Heidi asked, genuinely perplexed. \u201cYou said you\u2019ve been partners for...what? Six months. Make up an excuse. Tell him you want to discuss battle strategy and you\u2019d prefer to do it in the real world.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut...he might think I\u2019m hitting on him.\u201d</p><p>Heidi smiled. \u201cWell, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Her friend had a point. \u201cNot really,\u201d Beth mumbled but it was a weak rejoinder.</p><p>\u201cYou want him to meet your family, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>That was a nerve-racking subject. She decided to tell Heidi the whole story, how all of this had started with her mother\u2019s phone call. As she spoke, she concluded hopelessly that inviting him to Christmas dinner was impossible. Actually bringing him would be worse. Then again...it might work if there was an understanding between them. But she couldn\u2019t figure out why Peter would agree to such an arrangement. He had his own family, his own obligations without taking on hers. No, she couldn\u2019t ask him.</p><p>On second thought, he might understand. He\u2019d said his family was after him to get a life. Perhaps they could join forces the way they had in World of Warcraft. Combine their efforts.</p><p>Still...</p> <p>\u201cFor all I know he could be fifty, living at home and unemployed.\u201d There, it was out\u2014Beth\u2019s biggest fear. Of course, Peter could be wondering the same thing about her. \u201cOr\u2014\u201d an even bigger fear \u201c\u2014he could be married.\u201d</p><p>Chewing her sandwich, Heidi didn\u2019t respond for a moment. \u201cThe only way to find out is to ask,\u201d she said reasonably.</p><p>\u201cHe might think I\u2019m\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? Available? Beth, you are available! Okay, so you made a mistake in judgment. It happens, it\u2019s too bad, but it isn\u2019t the end of the world!\u201d</p><p>\u201cShould I tell Peter right off?\u201d she asked uncertainly. \u201cAbout my divorce?\u201d This was her other worry\u2014how much to say and when. She was afraid that once they did talk, she\u2019d compulsively blurt out her entire relationship history. After two minutes, her prospective Christmas date would flee for the border.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t lie,\u201d Heidi advised.</p><p>\u201cShould I be evasive?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t overload him with details in the beginning. That\u2019s all I\u2019m saying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d It seemed ridiculous to be discussing this when Peter hadn\u2019t even agreed to meet her yet.</p><p>\u201cYou do like what you know about him, right?\u201d</p><p>Beth considered the question, then nodded. \u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the important thing,\u201d Heidi assured her.</p><p>Beth nodded again. All she needed to do now was take that first step.</p><p>Goodness sighed as the veil between Heaven and Earth slowly closed, blocking the angel\u2019s view. She turned to Gabriel, and he could see that she was waiting for him to comment.</p><p>\u201cBeth\u2019s ready,\u201d he said emphatically.</p><p>\u201cAnd Peter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s ready, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe isn\u2019t fifty, living with his parents and unemployed, is he? Or...married?\u201d</p><p>Gabriel shook his head. \u201cNo, he\u2019s single and he has a good position at the home office of Starbucks. He\u2019s doing well financially and is popular with his peers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust like Beth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeth\u2019s resisted opening herself to love,\u201d Gabriel said. As for this new relationship\u2014well, there were a few facts yet to be uncovered, facts Goodness would have to learn on her own.</p><p>\u201cBeth needs to be taught that she\u2019s capable of falling in love again,\u201d Goodness murmured.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Gabriel said, encouraging her as much as he dared.</p><p>\u201cPeter might not be the one, though.\u201d</p><p>He wasn\u2019t sure what Goodness had against the young man. \u201cThat\u2019s not up to us,\u201d he said sternly.</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d Goodness folded her hands. \u201cI\u2019ll do my best to steer them toward each other. After that, they\u2019ll have to work it out for themselves.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel squinted at her. She sounded as though she was reciting something she\u2019d memorized. \u201cI\u2019m relying on you,\u201d he reminded her. \u201cYou need to be very clear about your own boundaries. You\u2019re there to help them, Goodness, to give them a nudge\u2014not to push them into each other\u2019s arms.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t let you down,\u201d she promised.</p><p>Gabriel sincerely hoped that was true. Just as he was about to expand on his concerns, another urgent prayer request whisked past him, landing on his desk.</p><p>Gabriel sighed as he bent to read this one. It came from nine-year-old Carter Jackson. Ah, yes. This wasn\u2019t the first time he\u2019d heard from the young man. Carter wanted a dog. He decided to assign Shirley to this request, since she had a particular affinity for children.</p><p>Shirley, Goodness and Mercy back on Earth. If his hair wasn\u2019t already white, that would\u2019ve done it.</p><p>Five</p><p>Carter Jackson pressed his ear as hard as he could against his bedroom door. If he shut his eyes and concentrated he could hear his parents\u2019 conversation.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, honey. I know how much Carter wants a dog, but we can\u2019t afford one right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut, David, we promised.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t promise him any such thing, Laurie. I said maybe he could have a dog for Christmas.\u201d</p><p>Carter\u2019s mother sounded sad. \u201cIt\u2019ll break his heart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBelieve me, I know that. I don\u2019t like this any better than you do.\u201d</p><p>Although he was only nine, Carter understood that his father wanted him to have a dog, just as he had when he was Carter\u2019s age. Carter had already decided to give his dog the same name as his father\u2019s\u2014Rusty. Rusty was a good name for a dog.</p><p>\u201cWe could get a dog from the shelter,\u201d his mom was saying. \u201cA rescue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not the cost of the dog. It\u2019s the vet bills, the food, everything else.\u201d</p><p>His mother didn\u2019t respond.</p><p>\u201cYou looked at the budget, didn\u2019t you? If there was any way we could make it happen, we would. But you know as well as I do that we can\u2019t afford a dog. We can barely afford a Christmas tree!\u201d</p><p>Carter wasn\u2019t sure what a budget was, but he knew it must have something to do with money. Money always seemed to be a problem. His mother used to work at a dress shop in downtown Leavenworth, but the shop closed and she hadn\u2019t been able to find another job.</p><p>That was all right with Carter. He liked having her at home, and so did his little sister, Bailey. After school they both liked being able to go home rather than to the day care lady down the street. Their mother usually had a snack or a small surprise waiting for them. She seemed happier, too, not to be working such long hours, but Carter knew there were problems with the budget...whatever that was.</p><p>\u201cOur health insurance rates just went up,\u201d his father said.</p><p>\u201cI saw that,\u201d his mother murmured. Her voice was quiet, making it difficult for Carter to hear everything she said. \u201cI try to keep the heat as low as I can while the kids are in school, not that it\u2019s helped all that much.\u201d</p><p>That explained why his mother was always wearing a sweater when Carter got home from school.</p><p>\u201cThe oil prices are killing us,\u201d his father said. He sounded angry.</p><p>\u201cI know. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d This came from his mother.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not your fault, Laurie.\u201d</p><p>Carter risked opening the door a crack, to see what he could. It took a moment for his eyes to adjust to the light, but then he saw his parents. They sat on the sofa and his mother\u2019s head rested on his father\u2019s shoulder. His father had one arm around his mother, and they seemed to be leaning against each other.</p><p>\u201cShould we tell Carter now or wait until Christmas morning?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Carter bit his lip. They\u2019d promised him a dog. His father said he hadn\u2019t, but he had. He just didn\u2019t remember. He\u2019d said it this summer, and ever since then Carter had hung on to that promise\u2014he could have a dog at Christmas.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t fair and he struggled not to break into tears. Turning his head, he buried his face in his arms and breathed deeply. He couldn\u2019t let them see him standing there\u2014or hear him cry.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019ll be able to buy the kids any gifts this year,\u201d his father continued. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right, honey,\u201d his mother reassured him. \u201cThere\u2019ll be plenty of presents from your parents and mine. The gifts from your family are already here. The kids will have something to open. Besides, we don\u2019t want to spoil Carter and Bailey. It\u2019s more important that they know the true meaning of Christmas.\u201d</p><p>His father seemed to agree.</p><p>Carter couldn\u2019t listen to any more of their conversation. His sister was sound asleep in the bed across from his own. Bailey was in first grade and he was in fourth. Bailey wanted her own room. But if he couldn\u2019t have a dog, then Bailey wasn\u2019t going to get a bedroom all to herself, either. That was what Bailey had asked Santa for in her letter.</p><p>The kids at school told Bailey she was stupid to believe in Santa. Carter didn\u2019t believe anymore, but he didn\u2019t want to say anything, especially to his little sister. She still believed. When he was her age, he\u2019d wanted to believe, too.</p> <p>Santa was like his grandparents who lived in Wenatchee. His mother\u2019s family didn\u2019t have a budget, or at least he didn\u2019t think so. It never seemed hard for them to buy presents the way it was for his parents. Maybe...</p><p>Carter decided he\u2019d mention the possibility to his mother in the morning and see what she said. If his own mom and dad couldn\u2019t afford a dog, then maybe they\u2019d let his grandparents buy him one. Or perhaps Grandma and Grandpa could pay the vet bills his dad was so worried about.</p><p>Feeling better now, Carter pulled back his sheets and slipped into bed. He\u2019d just closed his eyes when a backup plan came to mind. Santa might be make-believe but God was real, and Christmas was Jesus\u2019s birthday. Remembering that, he got out of bed and knelt down. He\u2019d already said his bedtime prayers, but this was extra. He hoped God wouldn\u2019t mind hearing from him again.</p><p>\u201cDear God,\u201d he whispered. \u201cThank You for Your birthday. I think it\u2019s great that because You were born we get presents. I\u2019m really glad You arranged it like that. Um, God, I asked about getting a dog before and my parents said I had to wait. I waited. It was hard, too.</p><p>\u201cThey said I had to be nine years old before I was responsible enough to take care of a dog. Well, I\u2019m nine and I do all my chores and I do my homework and I don\u2019t cheat on tests or anything.\u201d</p> <p>He hesitated, thinking he\u2019d better tell the whole truth. God knew anyway. \u201cSometimes Mom has to remind me about my chores. But I try to be good.\u201d</p><p>Carter paused, wondering if God might say something back. He listened intently, his eyes closed, but no matter how hard he concentrated he couldn\u2019t hear anything. That didn\u2019t mean God wasn\u2019t listening, though; Carter understood that.</p><p>\u201cIf You could find a way to get me a dog for Christmas, God, I\u2019d really like it. I promise to take care of Rusty and train him right. I\u2019ll make sure he\u2019s loved. Thank you.\u201d</p><p>Finished now, Carter lowered his head and whispered, \u201cAmen.\u201d He stayed on his knees a few minutes longer, in case God wanted to talk to him, after all. Eventually he climbed back into bed.</p><p>God had a dog for him, a special one. Carter was sure of it. He didn\u2019t know how the dog would arrive. Maybe his grandparents would give him one for Christmas, maybe not. He\u2019d just wait and see. He might not believe in Santa anymore, but Carter believed God answered prayers. All he had to do now was be patient.</p><p>\u201cYou heard?\u201d Gabriel asked Shirley. The Prayer Ambassador had once worked as a guardian angel and her love for children was the reason he usually assigned Shirley the prayer requests from boys and girls.</p> <p>\u201cA dog,\u201d Shirley repeated.</p><p>\u201cThere are more important requests, if you prefer,\u201d Gabriel said.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d came her immediate reply. \u201cI want to help Carter get his dog.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you would.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just that...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just that I could probably take on two or three such requests while I\u2019m on Earth,\u201d the angel said with utter confidence. \u201cBut I know why you haven\u2019t given me more than one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do?\u201d Gabriel asked. \u201cAnd why would that be?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMy real assignment is to keep watch over Goodness and Mercy. Heaven knows, and I don\u2019t mean that as a pun\u2014\u201d she paused and gave him a smug smile \u201c\u2014those two need looking after.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIndeed they do,\u201d Gabriel agreed. \u201cBut it seems to me that you\u2019ve taken part in their schemes a number of times.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnder protest,\u201d Shirley rushed to explain. \u201cI knew they were headed for trouble and I tried to warn them, but they wouldn\u2019t listen to me. So what choice did I have?\u201d She shook her head ruefully. \u201cYou can\u2019t imagine the trouble I\u2019ve saved you on other assignments. But I\u2019m only one angel and there\u2019s only so much I can do on my own.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel didn\u2019t need a reminder of the problems these three had caused. Yes, he did expect Shirley to be a supervisor of sorts for the other two, but as often as not they\u2019d led her into temptation. Still...</p><p>\u201cAs the most responsible of the trio\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat would be me,\u201d Shirley said, cutting him off. She folded her wings close to her back without revealing any degree of eagerness as Goodness and Mercy had done. Shirley was the picture of calm serenity, of unquestionable confidence.</p><p>\u201cLet me point out the time limitations involved,\u201d Gabriel said. \u201cAll three of you need to return to Heaven on Christmas Eve.\u201d This shouldn\u2019t come as any surprise, since it was one of the terms always set upon them during visits to Earth at this time of year.</p><p>A look of panic flashed into Shirley\u2019s eyes. \u201cThat means we have barely a week by the earthly calendar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t forget, we need you back for the festivities,\u201d Gabriel told her.</p><p>\u201cYes, of course.\u201d She did seem unusually concerned with the temporal constraints, which he found odd, considering that they\u2019d answered prayer requests in less time than that.</p><p>\u201cIf there are problems, I can come directly to you?\u201d Shirley asked.</p><p>It went without saying that with Goodness and Mercy, there were bound to be problems. \u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>On second thought, Gabriel wasn\u2019t so sure of that. He\u2019d seen compassion and a new depth in Mercy; she understood the seriousness of her assignment. Harry Alderwood\u2019s days on Earth were few, and Mercy would have to convince Rosalie to move and at the same time prepare Harry for the crossing. Heaven awaited his arrival.</p><p>As far as Goodness went...That was an entirely different story. Beth Fischer had lessons to learn, obstacles to negotiate\u2014obstacles of her own making. It might not be as easy as Goodness assumed to steer her toward the future. Gabriel would keep a close eye on this assignment.</p><p>And young Carter Jackson\u2014this wasn\u2019t an easy prayer request, either, despite what Shirley seemed to think. She might be a relatively senior angel, but she had a few lessons to learn herself.</p><p>\u201cCan I see Carter?\u201d Shirley asked.</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d As he\u2019d done with the others, Gabriel parted the veil between the two realms and offered Shirley a chance to assess the situation.</p><p>Sitting at the breakfast table, Carter watched his parents closely.</p><p>\u201cYou remember this summer you said I could have a dog when I\u2019m nine, Dad?\u201d he asked, braving the subject dearest to his heart.</p><p>His dad exchanged a look with his mother. \u201cI remember.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m nine now.\u201d</p><p>His father put down his fork, and the careful way he laid it on the table told Carter this was going to be an important discussion. \u201cSon, it hurts me to tell you this, but we can\u2019t afford a dog.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDad...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I know you\u2019ve been hoping to get a dog, but we can\u2019t manage it financially, Carter.\u201d</p><p>Despite his efforts, Carter\u2019s eyes filled with tears and everything in the room went blurry. His mother came to stand behind him. Embarrassed to be caught crying, Carter wiped his face with his sleeve and gulped several times.</p><p>\u201cAs soon as we can afford one, we\u2019ll get you a dog,\u201d she whispered, placing her hands on his shoulders. \u201cWe promise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you promised before,\u201d Carter challenged. \u201cYou said I could have a dog when I turned nine. And then you said I had to wait until Christmas. And now...\u201d</p><p>His father looked as sad as Carter had ever seen him. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Carter. I\u2019m doing the best I can, and so is your mother.\u201d</p><p>Bailey had started to cry, too. Carter tried to stop, but all he could do was sniffle back the tears. He felt like running away from the table. He couldn\u2019t eat.</p><p>\u201cWhat about Grandma and Grandpa Parker?\u201d he asked, clinging to the dream that his grandparents would give him the dog he so badly wanted.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve spoken to them,\u201d his father said.</p><p>Carter felt hope spring to life as he held his breath, waiting to hear the verdict.</p><p>\u201cIf your grandparents buy you a dog, that\u2019s just the beginning of what it\u2019ll cost. There\u2019s a whole lot more that goes along with owning a dog.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe could eat my food,\u201d Carter insisted. He\u2019d already considered this. \u201cI don\u2019t mind sharing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen there are shots.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take them,\u201d Carter said. It didn\u2019t matter how much they hurt, either.</p><p>\u201cThe shots are for the dog, Carter, and they\u2019re expensive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s the license and obedience school and neutering and a dozen other costs. All of that would drain the family budget. It won\u2019t be long, though. Okay?\u201d</p><p>Carter wasn\u2019t sure he should believe his father. \u201cHow long?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDavid.\u201d His mother\u2019s voice was soft and filled with warning, almost as if she feared his father would make another promise he couldn\u2019t keep.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, but I promise that as soon as we can afford it, you\u2019ll get your dog.\u201d</p><p>That was the same thing his mother had said. Carter swallowed hard. He couldn\u2019t ask his father\u2019s parents. They lived back east and they mailed their gifts, which had arrived last week. The gaily wrapped presents were arranged on the coffee table with a miniature Christmas tree his mother had bought at the grocery store for five dollars. His one hope had been Grandma and Grandpa Parker\u2014his mom\u2019s parents\u2014and according to his father, it wasn\u2019t going to happen.</p><p>His last chance, his only chance now, was God. And with everything inside him, Carter believed God would send him a dog.</p><p>Six</p><p>Rosalie Alderwood was humming \u201cO Come, All Ye Faithful\u201d in the kitchen while Harry watched the news on TV. This was Wednesday, their traditional shopping day, and the advertised grocery specials were in the morning paper. Soup was on special, tomato, his favorite, two cans for a dollar. So was ice cream\u2014three half-gallons for only six dollars. The brand wasn\u2019t his favorite but ice cream was ice cream, and Harry had always had a weakness for it. He didn\u2019t have much appetite anymore, but the thought of chocolate ice cream was appealing. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>For years\u2014ever since his retirement\u2014Harry and Rosalie had done their grocery-shopping in the middle of the week.</p><p>\u201cShould I get the car warmed up?\u201d Harry asked. He\u2019d put off the conversation with his daughters about selling it; maybe he\u2019d call them tonight.</p><p>\u201cGood idea.\u201d Rosalie came to stand in front of him, a dish towel in her hand, and glanced at the advertisements in the paper, spread out on the coffee table.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll want to get a few cans of the tomato soup that\u2019s on special,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cYes,\u201d she agreed.</p><p>Because Rosalie had gotten so absentminded, Harry had begun compiling lists of items they needed to pick up at the store. This morning they were out of both milk and bread. He didn\u2019t want to miss that ice cream, either. He planned to arrive early enough to have his selection of fresh flowers, too. Maybe a potted poinsettia in honor of the season...His pleasures were few.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get my coat,\u201d Rosalie told him.</p><p>Harry nodded and reached for his car keys hanging on the peg by the door. She left, and knowing Rosalie, it would take her ten minutes to get ready. And that was after telling him to start the car. Early on in their marriage, that habit used to irritate him, but not anymore. This tendency to dawdle was part of Rosalie\u2019s personality and Harry had learned to accept it.</p><p>Before he went out to the car, he checked the refrigerator.</p> <p>Another of Rosalie\u2019s longtime habits was her inability to discard things, even rotting food. He didn\u2019t understand it but had realized years ago that he was the one who\u2019d have to toss the leftovers. Thankfully, with her cooking so little, there wasn\u2019t much. A quick inspection of the contents revealed several odd items. Frankly Harry had no idea why they needed anchovy paste or five varieties of mustard. Good grief, he hadn\u2019t even known they made that many.</p><p>Sure enough, it was ten minutes before Rosalie appeared. She\u2019d put on fresh lipstick and combed her hair. \u201cI\u2019m ready, Harry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, too.\u201d Rosalie didn\u2019t drive. His own abilities were severely limited now and he took to the road only when necessary. In fact, he hadn\u2019t driven since he\u2019d gone to see the doctor on Monday. The days of Sunday-afternoon excursions into the country had long since passed.</p><p>One of the advantages of shopping on Wednesday mornings was the lack of crowds. Mostly it was a few folks like Rosalie and him. Recently the store had gotten motorized carts for handicapped and elderly patrons, which made the whole experience a lot more pleasant.</p><p>Harry drove the motorized cart while his wife strolled by his side, filling the basket. Not once in the past year had Rosalie complained about the fact that he was the one who wrote their grocery lists, a chore she used to do.</p><p>They\u2019d just turned down the soup and canned vegetable aisle when Lucy Menard entered from the other end. Her face brightened as soon as she saw them.</p> <p>\u201cRosalie,\u201d Lucy called out. She left her own cart and hurried toward her friend, arms wide open.</p><p>The two women hugged for an extra-long moment. During World War II, after Rosalie and Harry were married and while he was off fighting in Europe, she and Lucy had roomed together while working in the Portland, Oregon, shipyards. At one time, they\u2019d been as close as sisters. In fact, Lucy was godmother to their oldest daughter, Lorraine. Ever since Jake, Lucy\u2019s husband, had died, they hadn\u2019t seen much of her, which was sad. Mostly Harry blamed himself. Getting out and about was so difficult these days....</p><p>\u201cI swear it\u2019s been a month of Sundays since I saw you two,\u201d Lucy said, stepping back. She looked good, better than the last time Harry had seen her, which was...well, no wonder. It\u2019d been at Jake\u2019s funeral.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been meaning to let you know I\u2019ve moved,\u201d Lucy said excitedly.</p><p>\u201cMoved?\u201d Rosalie seemed to find that hard to believe.</p><p>Lucy beamed. \u201cThe kids finally convinced me that with Jake gone, I shouldn\u2019t be living on my own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m surprised you\u2019d leave your home,\u201d Rosalie murmured. She glanced at Harry, then looked away. If it was up to Rosalie she\u2019d delay moving as long as possible.</p><p>\u201cI got a place at Liberty Orchard, the new assisted-living complex off Frontier Street.\u201d</p> <p>That caught Harry\u2019s attention and he instantly straightened.</p><p>\u201cHarry\u2019s been saying we need to do something like that, too, but I don\u2019t think I can,\u201d Rosalie admitted sheepishly.</p><p>\u201cI said the same thing.\u201d Lucy nodded. \u201cI figured after living in the same house for thirty years, I was too old to make that drastic a change. I told my children they were handing me a death sentence, moving me out of my home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s how I feel,\u201d Rosalie said, once again avoiding Harry\u2019s gaze.</p><p>\u201cBut you did move,\u201d Harry broke in. \u201cAnd you\u2019re happy now, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes.\u201d Lucy smiled contentedly. \u201cI always assumed it would take a forklift to get me out of that house. The thought of sorting through and packing up all those years of living just overwhelmed me.\u201d</p><p>Harry knew that was part of Rosalie\u2019s problem, too.</p><p>\u201cThank goodness the kids came in and made all the decisions for me. They went through each room, packing what I needed and dividing up what I didn\u2019t. One day I was in my home and the next I was making friends at Liberty Orchard. It\u2019s the best thing that\u2019s happened to me in ten years.\u201d</p><p>Frowning, Rosalie regarded her friend. \u201cDon\u2019t they serve meals there?\u201d she muttered. \u201cWhy are you shopping?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe meals are great, but a few times a week I don\u2019t feel like being sociable. That\u2019s my choice, you know. I fix myself something to eat. I\u2019ve got my own refrigerator and microwave and that\u2019s all I need.\u201d She held up a box of microwave popcorn and giggled like a schoolgirl. \u201cI love this stuff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt sounds like the ideal setup,\u201d Harry said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not ready,\u201d his wife murmured.</p><p>Because Harry recognized her fears, he hoped to reassure her and gently urge her along. \u201cMaybe Rosalie and I could come and see you at your new digs,\u201d he suggested jauntily, as though he was proposing a casual visit.</p><p>His hope was that once Rosalie saw the facilities for herself, she\u2019d have a change of heart. If he couldn\u2019t get her to tour Liberty Orchard, perhaps Lucy could.</p><p>\u201cHow about tomorrow afternoon?\u201d Lucy said. \u201cAround three o\u2019clock? We have a book club meeting at two and there\u2019s an exercise class before that. I wouldn\u2019t want to miss either one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey have exercise classes?\u201d Rosalie sounded impressed.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s something to do every day. Before the move, it was a big deal just to step outside the house.\u201d</p><p>Rosalie shared a surprised glance with Harry. \u201cI know what you mean. We\u2019d love to come by, Lucy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see you tomorrow, then,\u201d Lucy said, looking pleased.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t nearly as pleased as Harry, though. This couldn\u2019t have worked out better had he planned it. Lucy\u2019s opportune appearance had led to the next day\u2019s visit in the most natural possible way. It was exactly what he\u2019d prayed would happen.</p><p>They finished collecting their purchases and by the time they returned to the house Harry needed a nap. The doc had insisted he couldn\u2019t carry anything heavier than five pounds, so his wife brought in the groceries from the garage. He made it to his recliner and was asleep almost before he elevated his feet.</p><p>Mercy was delighted at how well the meeting with Lucy Menard had gone. She sat in the motorized cart Harry had recently vacated, flushed with pleasure.</p><p>\u201cHow did you manage that?\u201d Goodness asked, sitting on the handlebars of the same cart. \u201cDid you know about Lucy?\u201d</p><p>Hands behind her head, Mercy leaned back, gleeful with joy. \u201cI did some research and discovered that Lucy and Rosalie had once been best friends. Then I noticed that she\u2019d recently moved into Liberty Orchard. After that, all I had to do was arrange a coincidental meeting in the grocery.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd, pray tell, how did this \u2018coincidental\u2019 meeting come about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI simply absconded with her remaining package of microwave popcorn. I also shuffled around her collection of DVDs and put It\u2019s a Wonderful Life on top. Which reminded her it\u2019s time for her annual viewing\u2014and that, of course, means she needs popcorn.\u201d Mercy chortled. \u201cPiece of cake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid someone mention the bakery?\u201d Shirley asked, fluttering down from above, her wings stirring up flyers in the store\u2019s foyer. A youngster chased after them, then disappeared into the store.</p><p>When Shirley caught sight of Mercy on the motorized cart, her eyes widened. \u201cDon\u2019t even think about it,\u201d she warned. \u201cGabriel asked me to keep an eye on the two of you. He knows, as I do, that you aren\u2019t to be trusted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t going to take the cart for a spin or anything,\u201d Mercy protested.</p><p>\u201cBut you did think about it.\u201d</p><p>Shirley knew her all too well. \u201cI considered it.\u201d Mercy sighed heavily. \u201cBut I\u2019m older and wiser now, and no longer given to flights of fancy.\u201d This thing was almost as good as a golf cart (there\u2019d been that unfortunate incident at the Augusta golf course) but if Shirley wasn\u2019t going to say anything, Mercy certainly wouldn\u2019t, either.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not to encourage her,\u201d Shirley warned Goodness.</p><p>\u201cMoi?\u201d The other angel brought her hand to her heart with an expression of pure innocence.</p><p>Shirley claimed the seat on a second cart. \u201cI thought we should confer before we start our assignments,\u201d she said.</p><p>Mercy didn\u2019t know when Shirley had been put in charge or begun sounding so self-important. She obviously saw herself as their boss; this didn\u2019t sit right with Mercy, but she\u2019d do whatever it took to finish her assignment.</p><p>\u201cWe each have an important task set before us,\u201d Shirley announced as if standing at a podium and addressing a huge crowd. She tilted her chin upward and spoke in deep, resounding tones. \u201cThis is our opportunity to prove ourselves once and for all to Gabriel and\u2014\u201d she paused, seemingly for effect \u201c\u2014to God.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGabriel and God,\u201d Mercy and Goodness dutifully repeated, their eyes meeting.</p><p>\u201cIt is our task,\u201d Shirley continued righteously, \u201cno, our duty, to teach these humans a lesson from our heavenly Father before we answer their prayer requests.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOur duty,\u201d Mercy and Goodness echoed.</p><p>At that point, Shirley deigned to actually face them. \u201cYou\u2019ve got that look,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cWhat look?\u201d Mercy demanded.</p><p>\u201cThe guilty look that tells me you did something you shouldn\u2019t have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t,\u201d Mercy insisted. \u201cNot that it\u2019s any of your business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m working with Beth Fischer,\u201d Goodness said, getting in between the other two. \u201cThis isn\u2019t an easy assignment. I could use some advice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the problem?\u201d Shirley\u2019s tone was, in Mercy\u2019s opinion, more than a bit condescending. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Goodness frowned meaningfully before she explained. \u201cIt appears that Beth\u2019s confidence in her ability to choose a life partner has been badly shaken. She doesn\u2019t trust her heart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy is that?\u201d Shirley asked.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know for sure. I\u2019ve been watching and studying Beth, and she\u2019s a wonderful woman. It\u2019s just that...that...\u201d She hesitated. \u201cIt\u2019s just that I\u2019m afraid she\u2019s still in love with her ex-husband. How am I supposed to help her get over him and involved with someone else in only one week? It\u2019s impossible.\u201d</p><p>Mercy could understand her friend\u2019s dilemma. \u201cDidn\u2019t you tell me her ex has remarried?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you need to teach her to let go,\u201d Shirley said unequivocally. \u201cThis happens all the time. It\u2019s been almost ten years and she has to move on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI agree, but it\u2019s going to be difficult to convince Beth of that. Thanks for the advice, though.\u201d To Mercy\u2019s ear, Goodness sounded a little\u2014just a little\u2014sarcastic.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll help you,\u201d Shirley said.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Goodness returned immediately. \u201cI appreciate the offer, but I can handle Beth on my own. She\u2019ll be in Leavenworth this weekend.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cReally?\u201d Shirley moved her hand to her chin in a thoughtful gesture.</p><p>\u201cHer friend Heidi invited her to come here for the Christmas festivities. No town does it better than Leavenworth\u2014or so I\u2019ve heard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about your assignment?\u201d Mercy asked, directing the question to Shirley.</p><p>For the first time, the other angel seemed unsettled. \u201cYes, well, my assignment is deceptively simple\u2014on the outside.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe you mentioned whose request you\u2019ve been sent to answer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a boy named Carter,\u201d Shirley mumbled. \u201cHe wants a dog for Christmas.\u201d</p> <p>Mercy swallowed a protest. She was dealing with a dying old man who had pressing concerns for his family. Goodness had to guide a young woman with a broken heart. And all Shirley had to do was find a little boy a dog! Talk about easy! Mercy could manage that with one wing tied behind her back.</p><p>\u201cAs I explained, my assignment is deceptively simple, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, deceptively.\u201d Mercy looked at Goodness. \u201cListen, I\u2019d love to stay and chat awhile, but I\u2019ve got work to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, too,\u201d Goodness said.</p><p>\u201cYes, well, Carter and his sister are in school, so I\u2019ve got a few minutes to spare,\u201d Shirley informed her friends.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure you do,\u201d Mercy said and promptly disappeared. Goodness followed, leaving Shirley sitting alone in the grocery foyer.</p><p>A minute later, Mercy returned, hovering behind Shirley, who hadn\u2019t moved from her position on the motorized grocery cart. Shirley seemed to assume the other two had left the premises, and Mercy let her think that. She studied the cart for a moment. These little numbers were a breeze to operate. Not that Shirley, so righteous and well-behaved, would know that.... With the lightest touch of her finger, Mercy fired the cart\u2019s engine to life.</p><p>Stunned, Shirley glanced around, obviously wondering what had changed and why. Mercy wasn\u2019t about to tell her. The cart took off into the store with Shirley on board.</p> <p>Shoppers gasped and leaped out of the way. Several people reached for their cell phones to snap pictures of the runaway cart, careering through the store minus a rider.</p><p>Mercy covered her mouth to hold back a laugh. Goodness joined her, laughing, too. Shirley wasn\u2019t nearly so calm.</p><p>\u201cMercy!\u201d she screamed. \u201cHelp! Do something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI believe she already did.\u201d Goodness chuckled and disappeared once again. Mercy did, too. Since Shirley had time on her hands, she could use it figuring out how to turn off the cart.</p><p>Seven</p><p>Beth wasn\u2019t imagining it. The relationship between her and Peter had shifted since the night of her mother\u2019s call. That\u2019d been two days ago, and whenever they logged on to the game she lowered her guard a fraction more. So did Peter.</p><p>The biggest difference was that they chatted far more than strictly necessary. And their messaging didn\u2019t concern the game as much as it did each other.</p><p>You\u2019re right on time, I notice, he wrote when she logged on.</p><p>Beth kicked off her shoes as she settled into the chair by her desk. She set aside the soda she was drinking in order to respond. You\u2019re ahead of schedule.</p><p>I was anxious.</p><p>Beth read his words and leaned away from her desk. She wasn\u2019t sure how to decipher that comment. Did Peter mean he was anticipating her arrival? Or was he implying that he was worried she\u2019d be late? It was hard to tell.</p><p>Anxious why? she asked, preferring the direct approach.</p><p>To talk to you.</p><p>Now that they\u2019d reached level forty in World of Warcraft, the option to purchase a mount had been offered to them. It was a big advantage and one they\u2019d been considering. Any particular reason? she asked, wondering if that was what he wanted to discuss.</p><p>Yeah.</p><p>That didn\u2019t tell her anything. Would you care to explain?</p><p>His reply didn\u2019t come for a couple of minutes, as if he needed to think about it first. So this obviously wasn\u2019t about the possibility of adding a mount to their list of resources.</p><p>We\u2019ve been partners\u2014how long? he asked instead.</p><p>Six months.</p><p>It seems longer.</p><p>Again Beth didn\u2019t know what to make of that. Really?</p><p>I trust you.</p><p>She laughed. As well you should. I\u2019ve covered your butt often enough, oh mighty Timixie.</p><p>I\u2019ve covered yours, too.</p><p>For which I\u2019m most grateful.</p><p>That\u2019s only appropriate.</p><p>Beth laughed, enjoying the light, teasing quality of their exchange. She typed quickly. Are you going to chatter all night or are we going to play?</p><p>Can\u2019t we do both?</p><p>Beth felt a rush of warmth. It was a pleasant sensation and one she\u2019d almost forgotten. Talking with the opposite sex was awkward for her, except in situations that didn\u2019t involve potentially romantic expectations\u2014with family, for instance, or male colleagues or friends like Sam. She felt comfortable with Peter, at ease. Although they hadn\u2019t even spoken on the phone, let alone face-to-face, it was the first time she\u2019d had that kind of reaction to a man since John.</p><p>Despite what her mother said, Beth had dated after her divorce; she just hadn\u2019t done it successfully. Most social conversations with men felt stilted. She struggled with how much to say or not to say.</p><p>Her record was three dates with the same man. Luke Whitcomb. He\u2019d been a nice guy, entertaining and funny. His sense of humor had carried her for the three dates.</p><p>She probably would\u2019ve accepted a fourth except that he\u2019d admitted their relationship wasn\u2019t working for him. He\u2019d been sincere when he said they should call it quits before either of them got hurt.</p><p>Well, surprise, surprise. Luke\u2019s rejection had cut deep and served, once again, to convince Beth that she was incapable of ever attracting another man. Afterward she\u2019d steered away from dating at all and a couple of weeks later, she\u2019d found the World of Warcraft and since then, almost her entire social life had been as a Night Elf and hunter.</p><p>Now there was Peter, a man she\u2019d never actually met. His family had suggested he \u201cget a life,\u201d so it was highly probably that he was single, too. Beth wanted to ask him, only she couldn\u2019t figure out how to do it without being obvious. A straightforward question about his marital status seemed out of line at this stage.</p><p>They\u2019d been into the game for about ten minutes when Peter sent her another message. This might be a stupid question but are you...single, married, whatever?</p><p>He\u2019d asked her.</p><p>Beth\u2019s relief was instantaneous. Single.</p><p>Me, too. Age?</p><p>Is this an interrogation? she typed back.</p><p>Sort of. Do you mind?</p><p>Not really. She didn\u2019t, because in the process she was learning more about him.</p><p>I\u2019ll tell if you will.</p><p>All right.</p><p>I\u2019m edging toward thirty, he typed. Which is one reason my family is after me to meet someone.</p><p>Me, too. Her heart really started to pound then. Perhaps that candle her mother had lit in church was working. Perhaps, in some quirky way, her prayer had taken effect.</p><p>Peter was single; she was single.</p><p>He lived in Seattle and she lived in Seattle.</p><p>He was close to her age and a professional, just as she was.</p><p>This almost sounded too good to be true.</p><p>My family says it\u2019s time I met someone, she typed next.</p><p>They do? He seemed as astonished as she felt\u2014as if he, too, was finding this a bit too coincidental. Eerie, even.</p><p>A moment later, he typed, What\u2019s wrong with you?</p><p>Well, he was direct enough, but she\u2019d been pretty honest with him, too. She toyed with the idea of telling him she\u2019d been married and divorced, and then remembered Heidi\u2019s advice. It wasn\u2019t necessary to blurt out everything on the first date\u2014even if this wasn\u2019t exactly a date.</p><p>I spend too much time playing computer games. She smiled as her fingers skipped effortlessly over the keyboard.</p><p>I\u2019ve got the same problem, came his reply.</p><p>Silly though it was, Beth felt sure they were both smiling. Their conversation went on for another hour, and she was shocked to realize the game had become secondary.</p><p>That night when Beth crawled into bed and drew the blanket over her shoulders, she fell into an easy, peaceful sleep. She woke with a feeling of expectation, as if something wonderful was about to happen. Keeping her eyes closed, she tried to hang on to that sensation for as long as she could, afraid reality would chase it away.</p><p>The phone rang while she dressed for work. Call display told her it was her mother.</p><p>\u201cHi, Mom,\u201d she said, answering the phone while fastening an earring.</p><p>\u201cYou sound happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am\u2014well, kind of.\u201d</p><p>Her mother\u2019s hesitation was brief. \u201cDoes this have anything to do with the man you met on that computer game you\u2019re always playing?\u201d</p><p>Beth found it hard to believe she\u2019d actually mentioned Peter to her mother. She\u2019d done it on impulse\u2014a bad impulse\u2014hoping to shut down a barrage of veiled criticism and heavy-handed encouragement. Normally her mother would be the last person she\u2019d tell. \u201cWe haven\u2019t even met, Mom,\u201d she finally confessed. \u201cAt least not in the flesh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the holdup?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe hasn\u2019t suggested we meet outside the game,\u201d Beth said, which in her opinion was a perfectly logical explanation. In her mother\u2019s generation, the men always did the asking. She figured this was an excuse even her marriage-obsessed mother would accept.</p><p>\u201cThen you suggest it.\u201d</p><p>So much for that. \u201cMother!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m serious,\u201d Joyce said. \u201cWhy beat around the bush? You\u2019re a woman who knows what she wants. Now go and get it.\u201d</p><p>Beth thought about asking Peter. Why not? One of them had to break the ice. \u201cI\u2019d like to meet him but I don\u2019t want to appear forward.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMarybeth, you don\u2019t have much time. Maybe he\u2019s shy. Maybe he\u2019s waiting for you to bring it up. Show a bit of initiative, will you? It\u2019s later than you think.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cTrust me, Mother, Peter isn\u2019t shy.\u201d She knew this from the way he attacked their enemies on WoW.</p><p>\u201cThen why wait?\u201d</p><p>Beth nibbled on her lower lip. \u201cI don\u2019t want to rush into anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it\u2019s already December twentieth. Christmas is right around the corner.\u201d</p> <p>This wasn\u2019t making sense. \u201cWhy is it so important that Peter join us for Christmas?\u201d Beth asked, beginning to have some suspicions.</p><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t important...Well, in a manner of speaking it is. Your father and I have this wager.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMother!\u201d Her parents constantly made small bets with each other. Most of the time Beth found this habit of theirs amusing. Not now, though. Not when their wager was about her. \u201cYou\u2019d better tell me everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay...\u201d Her mother inhaled deeply. \u201cLast Christmas, your father said that at the rate you were going you\u2019d never remarry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you disagreed with him.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOf course I did! Marybeth, you have no idea what an attractive young woman you are. You should be happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am happy,\u201d she insisted.</p><p>\u201cI disagree. You just think you are.\u201d</p><p>Beth rolled her eyes, knowing it wouldn\u2019t do any good to argue.</p><p>\u201cYou should be dating,\u201d her mother continued.</p><p>\u201cAnd getting married and becoming a mother.\u201d The litany was a familiar one.</p> <p>\u201cYes,\u201d Joyce Fischer said. \u201cI hate the idea that you\u2019ve got nothing more pressing to go home to than that darned computer game.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t understand, Mom. Peter and I are at level forty and\u2014\u201d She stopped. There was no point in explaining further.</p><p>\u201cI beg your pardon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes this have anything to do with bringing Peter to dinner on Christmas Day?\u201d her mother wanted to know.</p><p>\u201cNothing whatsoever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut that\u2019s the important thing here. Otherwise your father...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d Beth murmured.</p> <p>\u201cOtherwise I\u2019ll be hauling the garbage out to the curb every Wednesday for the next six months.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA fate worse than death,\u201d Beth muttered sarcastically.</p><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t that I mind dealing with the garbage,\u201d her mother went on, \u201cbut I do mind losing another bet to your father, especially when you\u2019re so close to actually having a date for Christmas.\u201d</p><p>Beth didn\u2019t consider herself close at all. In her desperation to win this bet, Joyce was being completely unreasonable.</p><p>\u201cPromise me you\u2019ll ask Peter,\u201d her mother pleaded.</p><p>This had gone on long enough. \u201cI\u2019ll do no such thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf not for my sake, then your own, Marybeth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d That was final, too.</p><p>The silence that followed weakened her resolve. \u201cDon\u2019t you realize how ridiculous you\u2019re being?\u201d Beth said. \u201cPeter\u2019s practically a stranger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust meet him,\u201d Joyce wheedled. \u201cThat\u2019s all I ask. Whether he comes to Christmas dinner or not is entirely up to you. All I ask is that the two of you connect. Promise me that much.\u201d</p><p>While she\u2019d never openly admit it, Beth was curious about her online partner. She couldn\u2019t help it. She wondered if he was being pressured by his family about meeting her, too. It was worth asking.</p><p>She ended the conversation with her mother by booking a lunch date for later in the week.</p><p>That evening, as soon as Beth got home from work, she logged on to the game. Peter came on ten minutes after that. The first thing he did was ask about the amount of gold they\u2019d accumulated toward their purchase of a mount. The fact that he avoided the kind of personal comment they\u2019d exchanged the night before was telling. She suspected he was uncomfortable with the way their conversation had turned toward the personal. It had unsettled her, too, and at the same time excited her.</p><p>Beth took his cue and simply answered his question.</p><p>They played for an hour, but neither one seemed focused on the game.</p><p>I need to leave early, she typed in.</p><p>Do you have a hot date?</p><p>It wasn\u2019t a date at all. Beth was meeting Heidi to go over the details of their weekend in Leavenworth. An appointment, she told him.</p><p>Business or pleasure?</p><p>He was getting mighty inquisitive. Pleasure, she answered.</p><p>There was a slight pause. Have fun.</p><p>You, too.</p><p>No problem meeting tomorrow night?</p><p>He\u2019d never asked before. None.</p><p>Good. Talk to you then.</p><p>Beth put Borincana safely away and exited the game. The happy feeling that had greeted her that morning had completely evaporated. She didn\u2019t understand what had happened with Peter or why. Was he backing off, losing interest? He\u2019d been eager to confirm that she\u2019d be playing tomorrow, though, so he might just prefer his romance virtual. He might be afraid of taking their relationship into the realms of reality.</p><p>What a sorry lot they were, both of them more comfortable in the guise of a fantasy character than dealing with real life. They were two sad, lonely people reaching out at Christmas, wanting to connect and too afraid to try.</p><p>Eight</p><p>Carter waited at the bus stop with his sister and stamped his feet to ward off the cold. With only two school days\u2014including today\u2014left before winter break, everyone was talking about Christmas and what they expected to find under the tree. Carter knew that his parents couldn\u2019t afford gifts. Still, there were several wrapped ones from his grandparents that his mother had already set out. Their Christmas tree was pitiful, but he didn\u2019t care as long as there were presents. He just hoped all of his weren\u2019t socks or underwear.</p><p>As the big yellow bus belched to a stop, Carter grabbed his sister\u2019s hand. His mother had instructed him to look out for Bailey, and Carter took his duties seriously.</p><p>The bus doors slid open and Carter pushed Bailey ahead of him. As he climbed the steps and felt the warm air on his face, he pulled off his woolen mittens, stuffing them in his pockets. Bailey raced down the aisle toward her friend, Maddy. Ignoring her now, Carter took a seat next to his best friend, Timmy Anderson.</p><p>\u201cWant to trade lunches?\u201d Timmy asked. Carter tried to remember what his mother had packed in his Pirates of the Caribbean lunch pail. She\u2019d baked cookies the night before and there was the usual peanut-butter-and-jelly sandwich, plus an apple. He had an apple every day, no matter what. Timmy did, too.</p><p>\u201cWhat you got?\u201d Carter asked.</p><p>Timmy opened his Spider-Man lunch box. \u201cPotato chips, a Twinkie, a pudding cup and an apple.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo sandwich?\u201d</p><p>Timmy shook his head.</p><p>Timmy\u2019s lunch was filled with all the treats Carter only got if he traded. He loved Twinkies, but his mother baked really good chocolate chip cookies.</p><p>\u201cWell?\u201d Timmy pressed. \u201cWanna trade or not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>The two boys switched lunch pails. Timmy seemed to like Carter\u2019s lunches better than his own. He wanted to trade almost every day.</p><p>The bus made another stop and three more students got on. Cameron and Isaiah Benedict came aboard, scrambling into the seat in front of Timmy and Carter.</p><p>Cameron twisted around and excitedly announced, \u201cI\u2019m getting an Xbox 360 for Christmas!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo way,\u201d Timmy said, eyes wide with envy and awe. \u201cI put one on my list, but my parents said it was too expensive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you know for sure?\u201d Carter asked. He\u2019d thought he was getting a dog like his parents had promised, and that wasn\u2019t going to happen. He\u2019d bet Cameron only thought he was getting the Xbox.</p><p>\u201cYeah, because Mom said if that\u2019s what I wanted, I wouldn\u2019t get anything else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Cameron\u2019s just got one gift under the tree,\u201d his younger brother, Isaiah, explained.</p><p>\u201cIt could be underwear.\u201d</p><p>Cameron glared at Carter. \u201cThat\u2019s not funny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m getting a PSP,\u201d Timmy said.</p><p>Carter knew that was a PlayStation Portable, a handheld game everyone wanted. \u201cThat\u2019s great.\u201d</p><p>The other boys looked at Carter. \u201cWhat are you getting for Christmas?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged, reluctant to tell his friends that his parents had told him he couldn\u2019t have the one and only gift he\u2019d ever truly wanted.</p><p>\u201cWell, what did you ask for?\u201d Isaiah leaned over the back of his seat.</p><p>Carter would\u2019ve liked a computer and an Xbox, too, but his family couldn\u2019t afford those things. He hung his head and whispered, \u201cI asked for a dog.\u201d Instantly a lump filled his throat.</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of dog?\u201d</p><p>Carter wasn\u2019t picky. \u201cA red dog,\u201d he said. If he was going to name him Rusty, then he figured the dog should have reddish fur. \u201cMedium size so he can run and fetch and do stuff like that.\u201d</p><p>His Grandma Parker had a small, yappy dog, a miniature poodle. Suzette was a good pet for his grandmother, but that wasn\u2019t the kind of dog Carter had in mind. His dog would play outside with him during the day, after school and on weekends. At night he could sleep in Carter\u2019s room on the rug next to his bed. That was what dogs did. They slept by their masters. Rusty would sleep in the very same spot where Carter had gotten down on his knees and prayed.</p><p>If he closed his eyes, Carter could picture his dog with big, floppy ears and a tongue that hung out the side of his mouth when he\u2019d been running. Oh, and Carter wanted a boy dog. A girl dog would be all right, too, but he preferred a boy.</p><p>\u201cAre you going to get one?\u201d Cameron asked.</p><p>Carter hesitated. \u201cI won\u2019t know until Christmas,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>\u201cYour parents are gonna make you wait?\u201d</p><p>He nodded rather than admit the truth.</p><p>\u201cI wish I\u2019d asked for a dog,\u201d Timmy said, sitting dejectedly back in his seat.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll share Rusty with you,\u201d Carter offered, and then remembered there wasn\u2019t going to be a Rusty.</p><p>\u201cYou will?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d Carter assured his friend.</p><p>Timmy gave Carter a gap-toothed grin, and when the bus arrived at school, the two boys hurried off together.</p><p>Their teacher stood in the hallway outside their classroom. As they approached, Timmy burst out, \u201cMs. Jensen, Ms. Jensen! Guess what? Carter\u2019s getting a dog for Christmas.\u201d</p><p>Their teacher\u2019s eyes lit up at the news. \u201cWhy, Carter, that\u2019s wonderful. Do you have a name for him yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRusty.\u201d</p><p>She nodded approvingly. \u201cThat\u2019s a great name for a dog.\u201d</p><p>Carter tried to smile but a funny feeling in the pit of his stomach started to bother him. He didn\u2019t know what he was going to do once his friends discovered he didn\u2019t get Rusty, after all. He should never have said anything to Timmy.</p><p>\u201cCarter said he\u2019d let me play with his dog.\u201d</p><p>Ms. Jensen beamed at him. \u201cIt\u2019s good to share. I\u2019m proud of you, Carter.\u201d With that, she turned into the classroom and left the two of them waiting in the hallway.</p><p>All during their arithmetic lesson, Carter\u2019s thoughts wandered to what his friends would say after Christmas when he didn\u2019t have his dog. He never should\u2019ve lied. His stomach hurt the way it always did when he hadn\u2019t told the truth. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>At recess, Carter walked up to his teacher\u2019s desk, holding his stomach. He rarely missed school. In fact, he hadn\u2019t stayed home a single day.</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you feeling well, Carter?\u201d Ms. Jensen asked in a soft caring voice that reminded him of his mother\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cI have a stomachache.\u201d</p><p>She pressed the back of her hand against his forehead, then took him down to the nurse\u2019s office. Mrs. Weaver was about the same age as his grandmother and had hair that was completely white. She spoke soothingly as she took his temperature. After she\u2019d finished looking at the thermometer, she said he didn\u2019t have a fever and suggested he lie down on the couch for a little while.</p> <p>Carter tried to sleep but he couldn\u2019t stop thinking. After a few minutes he sat up, gazing idly out the office window\u2014and that was when he saw it.</p><p>A dog.</p><p>Outside in the schoolyard was a dog just like the one Carter had imagined. A dog with big, floppy ears. He was exactly the right size, and he jumped and leaped at the students and then chased after a ball. He was skinny and dirty, but Carter could tell that he was a good dog.</p><p>He was exactly the kind of dog Carter wanted, although this one didn\u2019t have red fur. It was dark and his plumy tail was clumped with mud, but that didn\u2019t stop him from wagging it furiously. Watching the other kids play with him made Carter\u2019s stomach stop hurting.</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t reach your mother,\u201d Mrs. Weaver told him when she returned.</p> <p>\u201cI feel better now,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>\u201cWould you like to go back to your classroom?\u201d</p><p>Carter nodded just as the bell ending recess rang. If the dog was still on the playground at lunchtime, Carter would play with him. A sense of exhilaration filled him and he could hardly wait for the midday break.</p><p>Carter ate his lunch in record time, then raced outside to the playground without bothering to button up his coat. He\u2019d left Timmy discussing Christmas plans with Isaiah\u2014and enjoying his chocolate chip cookies. The cold, sharp air hit him right in the face, but he didn\u2019t care. There weren\u2019t many kids outside, but the mutt was there, walking around the yard, sniffing, his nose to the ground. When he saw Carter, the dog instantly ran toward him, looking up with dark pleading eyes.</p><p>\u201cHi, boy,\u201d Carter said and dropped to one knee. He withdrew the Twinkie from his pocket, pulled it from its wrapper and fed it to the dog.</p><p>The mutt ate the Twinkie in two bites. The poor thing was starved. Now Carter wished he hadn\u2019t eaten any of his lunch. He wished he had more food to give his new friend. Thinking quickly, he hurried back into the school. His sister had complained that morning about another peanut-butter-and-jelly sandwich. If she didn\u2019t want it, Carter did. Not for himself but for the stray.</p> <p>As he\u2019d expected, his sister was with her friends. She\u2019d eaten everything in her lunch but the sandwich.</p><p>\u201cBailey,\u201d he said, breathless now. \u201cCan I have your sandwich?\u201d</p><p>Bailey squinted up at him. \u201cWhat did you do with yours?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI gave it to Timmy.\u201d</p><p>Bailey hesitated. \u201cI was going to eat mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you weren\u2019t. Come on, Bailey, I need that sandwich.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019ll you trade me for it?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Carter didn\u2019t have a lot of time. If he didn\u2019t hurry back outside, some other kid would make friends with the dog. He might even leave the schoolyard. \u201cYou can watch whatever you want on TV Saturday morning.\u201d</p> <p>His sister\u2019s eyes widened. It was a generous offer and she knew it. They only had one television set and their mother made them take turns choosing what to see. Bailey liked sissy stuff, while Carter liked action heroes.</p><p>\u201cAll Saturday morning?\u201d</p><p>Carter nodded. With a smug look, Bailey handed over her peanut-butter-and-jelly sandwich.</p><p>Grabbing it, Carter hurried back outside. The playground was crowded with kids by then, but as soon as the mutt saw Carter, he bounded across the playground toward him.</p><p>Once again, Carter got down on one knee. He wiped the muddy hair from the dog\u2019s eyes; his own hands got grimy in the process but Carter didn\u2019t care. Taking the sandwich out of his pocket, he tore off the plastic and held it out to the mutt. The bread disappeared as quickly as the Twinkie had.</p><p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t be feeding that dog.\u201d</p><p>Carter glanced up to find Mr. Nicholson, the sixth-grade teacher, who was on schoolyard duty during lunch, scowling down at him. \u201cI\u2019ve already called Animal Control about this dog once.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d An automatic protest came from Carter. He didn\u2019t want this friendly dog to go to a shelter.</p><p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t belong on the playground.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a nice dog.\u201d</p><p>Mr. Nicholson didn\u2019t agree or disagree. \u201cI don\u2019t want to see you feeding him again. Is that understood?\u201d</p><p>Carter nodded. The teacher didn\u2019t exactly say Carter couldn\u2019t feed the stray. What he\u2019d said was that he didn\u2019t want to see Carter do it.</p><p>The teacher went off to intervene in an argument between some sixth-grade kids, and Carter petted the dog\u2019s face. \u201cIt\u2019s all right, boy, I\u2019ll bring you food. Will you be here tomorrow?\u201d</p><p>The mutt looked back at him with intense brown eyes, as if to say he\u2019d be waiting for Carter.</p><p>On his way back to class, Carter washed his hands. He wondered how long the dog had been lost. He sure was dirty, and he seemed lonely, too. Carter\u2019s heart ached for him. What the stray needed was a good home and a family, just like everyone did. Carter hoped the Animal Control people didn\u2019t catch him before Carter figured out how to bring him to his house.</p><p>First he had to explain to his father that this dog wasn\u2019t a puppy but a grown-up dog that needed a home. This wasn\u2019t an expensive dog, either. He was a plain ordinary dog. He\u2019d probably already had his shots.</p><p>That night Carter couldn\u2019t keep still at the dinner table. All he could think about was the dog in the schoolyard, out in the cold and dark by himself. He wanted to bring him home right then and there. He was worried the dog might not be safe, or that the people from Animal Control would take him to a shelter. That might not be such a bad thing, because he might be adopted by a family. Except that Carter wanted the dog for himself.</p><p>\u201cCarter, eat your dinner,\u201d his father said.</p><p>Carter stared down at his plate. Spaghetti was one of his favorite meals. His mother had made it specially for him, and all he could do was swirl the noodles around with his fork. He needed to figure out how to smuggle the meatballs off his plate and hide them until morning.</p><p>\u201cHow were your classes?\u201d his mother asked. It was the same question she asked every night.</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d Carter murmured. \u201cI had a tummy ache but it went away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCarter fed a dog in the schoolyard and got in trouble.\u201d Bailey could hardly wait to tattle on him.</p><p>From across the table, Carter glared at his sister.</p><p>His father frowned. \u201cWhose dog was it?\u201d</p><p>Carter shrugged. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t belong to anyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a stray?\u201d</p><p>Carter stared at his plate again. \u201cI guess so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was real dirty and had mud all over him and Carter gave him a sandwich and petted him until Mr. Nicholson made him stop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Carter,\u201d his mother whispered.</p><p>His father shook his head. \u201cI don\u2019t want you bringing that dog home, Carter. Is that understood?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mean it,\u201d he said sternly.</p><p>Carter swallowed hard as he tried not to cry. \u201cMay I be excused, please?\u201d he asked.</p><p>His mother gently rested her hand on his. \u201cYes, you may.\u201d</p><p>Carter went into the bedroom he shared with his sister and fell, fully dressed, across his bed. He buried his face in his pillow, praying the dog would still be there the following day.</p><p>Nine</p><p>Mercy regarded Shirley suspiciously, her arms folded, her foot tapping. \u201cYou brought that dog to the schoolyard, didn\u2019t you?\u201d She pointed at the animal, who lay in the sandbox, head resting on his outstretched paws as he slept.</p><p>Shirley sat on the swing at the farthest reaches of the yard and shook her head adamantly. \u201cI most certainly did not. I don\u2019t have a clue where that dog came from. Trust me, if I brought a dog into Carter\u2019s life, it wouldn\u2019t be that mangy mutt.\u201d</p><p>Mercy didn\u2019t believe her. \u201cI, for one, find it mighty convenient that a stray dog should show up in the schoolyard today.\u201d And besides, she knew Shirley loved animals\u2014despite the scornful way she\u2019d spoken about this dog.</p><p>\u201cI agree with Mercy.\u201d Goodness came to stand at her side, her foot tapping in an identical tempo.</p><p>\u201cStop looking at me like that,\u201d Shirley muttered. \u201cCarter can\u2019t have a dog. That decision\u2019s already been made. You both know I can\u2019t interfere with the chain of command. Carter\u2019s father feels bad enough as it is, but he\u2019s said in no uncertain terms that his son can\u2019t have a dog. Why would I complicate matters?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would she?\u201d Goodness turned to Mercy.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, but like I said, I find this entire situation a little too convenient.\u201d</p><p>Shirley stepped free of the swing and brushed the snow from her hands. \u201cSpeaking of convenient, I think it\u2019s very interesting that Beth and Peter appear to be so well-matched.\u201d</p><p>Goodness raised both arms. \u201cDon\u2019t look at me. I didn\u2019t have a thing to do with that. They met online six months ago, remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cQuite right,\u201d Mercy confirmed. \u201cAnd before you mention Harry and Rosalie running into Lucy Menard, I\u2019ve explained that.\u201d</p><p>A wistful expression came over Goodness. \u201cI do hope everything works out for Beth and Peter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy shouldn\u2019t it?\u201d Shirley asked.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re both so stubborn\u2014and so scared. What they need is a good shove in the right direction.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGoodness!\u201d Shirley\u2019s expression was scandalized. \u201cDon\u2019t even think like that. Our job is to teach these humans a lesson. They have to make their own decisions, find their own way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFind their own way?\u201d Mercy didn\u2019t mean to sound sarcastic, but she couldn\u2019t help it. The evidence was overwhelming; humans were a pathetic bunch. \u201cMay I remind you that humans wandered in the desert for forty years on a trip that should\u2019ve taken three months, tops?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJoshua had them march around Jericho seven times, looking for the main gate to the city,\u201d Goodness added, shaking her head.</p><p>Shirley frowned. \u201cYou both know there were very good reasons for those incidents.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue, but you have to admit humans don\u2019t exactly have an impressive track record.\u201d</p><p>With a disgruntled look, Shirley was forced to admit the truth.</p><p>\u201cHumans need help,\u201d Mercy reiterated.</p><p>\u201cOur help.\u201d</p><p>Still Shirley didn\u2019t seem convinced. \u201cBut Gabriel\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill never find out,\u201d Mercy assured her. \u201cWe won\u2019t be blatant about it\u2014just a nudge or two where it\u2019s warranted. If Gabriel\u2019s going to place us under earthly time constraints, we need to be inventive.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cInventive,\u201d Goodness echoed. \u201cHow do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, for one thing, it\u2019s obvious that you\u2019ll have to step in with Beth and Peter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Mercy didn\u2019t understand why she had to clarify everything for her fellow Prayer Ambassadors. \u201cDidn\u2019t you tell me they still haven\u2019t set a time to meet?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell, yes...\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the reason is?\u201d</p><p>Goodness shifted uncomfortably. \u201cWell, like I said, they\u2019re afraid....\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfraid of what?\u201d Mercy asked. \u201cDo you suppose maybe they\u2019re afraid of being disillusioned?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey could be,\u201d Goodness said. \u201cAnd I agree\u2014they need help. The last time I looked, Beth was depressed. Everything was going so well between her and Peter, and then he closed down for no apparent reason.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIs there anything you can do about it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...Yes, of course there is.\u201d Her eyes darted from side to side. \u201cUnfortunately, I can\u2019t think what it would be at this precise moment, but it\u2019ll come to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShirley.\u201d Mercy focused her gaze on the former guardian angel.</p><p>\u201cReporting for duty.\u201d She stood military straight, wings neatly folded, feet together. Mercy wondered if Shirley was making fun of her.</p><p>\u201cHow do you plan to help Carter?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Shirley\u2019s shoulders sagged with defeat. \u201cI\u2019ll make sure the dog\u2019s nowhere to be seen when he arrives for school tomorrow.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re sure that\u2019s the right thing for Carter?\u201d Mercy asked, her own heart aching for the little boy.</p><p>Reluctantly Shirley nodded. \u201cHis father said he couldn\u2019t have a dog, no matter what. I don\u2019t have any choice.\u201d</p><p>All three considered this unfortunate set of circumstances.</p><p>\u201cMaybe I could steer Carter\u2019s father toward a better-paying job,\u201d Shirley suggested.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s an idea.\u201d</p><p>Goodness turned to her. \u201cWhat\u2019s happening with Harry?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Ah, yes, Harry and Rosalie. \u201cThey visited Lucy Menard earlier this afternoon and got a tour of the assisted-living complex.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what happened?\u201d Shirley asked.</p> <p>\u201cCome with me and let\u2019s find out,\u201d Mercy invited. Together with her two friends, she descended on the house at 23 Walnut Avenue, where Rosalie and Harry sat across from each other at the dinner table.</p><p>\u201cI was surprised at how many of our friends have moved to Liberty Orchard,\u201d Rosalie murmured, gazing down at her bowl of canned chicken stew.</p><p>She seemed deep in thought, and that encouraged Harry. The visit had gone even better than he could\u2019ve expected. Rosalie had met three good friends she\u2019d lost contact with in the last few years. Each one had urged them to make the change and become part of the community at Liberty Orchard.</p><p>\u201cDid you notice how most people said they were sorry they hadn\u2019t moved into assisted living sooner?\u201d Harry waited for his wife to protest. She hadn\u2019t wanted him to know, but he could see that she\u2019d been impressed with the facility.</p><p>\u201cWhat I liked was all the social activities,\u201d Rosalie murmured.</p><p>Harry agreed. He\u2019d been impressed himself, glad, too, because he felt that after he died Rosalie would have the social contact she needed. A wave of sadness washed over him at the thought of leaving his wife behind. He tried not to dwell on the subject of death, but knowing it was imminent, he couldn\u2019t stop thinking about it.</p><p>Trying not to appear too enthusiastic about the assisted-living complex, Harry nodded.</p><p>\u201cMy goodness,\u201d Rosalie said happily, \u201cthose folks have something going on every day of the week.\u201d</p><p>Harry nodded again, taking a bite of his stew.</p><p>\u201cDid you read the dinner menu?\u201d Rosalie asked him. She\u2019d found it posted outside the dining room and gone over it three or four times. She\u2019d had all kinds of questions for Lucy, too. The midday meal was the main one of the day, with a lighter one served at about five. \u201cWhy, they had a choice of two soups and a salad, plus fish, chicken or meat loaf. And Lucy said it\u2019s different every day!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI took a look at it myself,\u201d Harry said gently. One thing was certain; the residents at Liberty Orchard weren\u2019t eating any of their meals out of a can\u2014unless they chose to. He didn\u2019t need to point out the obvious, however.</p><p>His wife set down her spoon. \u201cHarry,\u201d she began shyly, \u201cI\u2019m not sure if you\u2019ve noticed, but I\u2019m starting to forget things now and then.\u201d The admission came with some hesitation. \u201cI\u2019ve begun to wonder if one of the reasons is that my mind isn\u2019t as active as it used to be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLucy said the same thing happened to her,\u201d Harry pointed out, reminding his wife of the conversation earlier in the day. \u201cDo you recall how she said that as soon as she spent time with other people again, she wasn\u2019t nearly as forgetful?\u201d</p><p>Rosalie thought about this for a moment. \u201cShe did, didn\u2019t she?\u201d</p><p>Harry was cautious about saying too much too soon. Rosalie\u2019s eyes had been opened when she\u2019d seen the facility, and it didn\u2019t hurt that a number of their friends had already made the move.</p><p>\u201cLucy also said the unit closest to hers is available.\u201d He said this casually and waited for a response. While his wife had been chatting with her friends, Harry had met with the administrator to see if they could secure that particular unit. Naturally, he wouldn\u2019t make a decision like this without discussing it with Rosalie first, but he was beginning to feel confident that she saw the wisdom of such a move.</p><p>Rosalie looked at him the same way she had all those years ago, when they\u2019d considered purchasing this very house. She loved this place and Harry loved her. He would\u2019ve moved heaven and earth to buy the house she wanted.</p><p>\u201cDo you honestly think we should give up our home, Harry?\u201d</p><p>He hated that it had come to this. \u201cLike I said, this old place is getting to be too much for me.\u201d</p><p>Slowly Rosalie lowered her gaze and conceded. \u201cAnd me.\u201d</p><p>This was the first time she\u2019d been willing to admit that age had taken a toll on her, too. As far as Harry was concerned, it was a giant leap forward.</p><p>\u201cWe should ask the girls,\u201d she said tentatively.</p><p>\u201cGood idea.\u201d Their youngest daughter was coming to spend Christmas with them, and Lorraine and family would arrive the day after. Both his daughters agreed with Harry. Like him, they recognized the necessity of this change, even if they hadn\u2019t quite grasped its urgency.</p><p>Harry knew that if Rosalie discussed the situation with either Lorraine or Donna, their daughters would reassure her in ways he couldn\u2019t. He felt it was only a matter of time. God willing, everything would fall into place....</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to discuss it again until after Christmas, though,\u201d Rosalie insisted. \u201cI won\u2019t even talk about moving until the holidays are over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut, Rosalie, there\u2019s only the one unit,\u201d he blurted out. \u201cUnless we give the administrator a security check, someone else might take it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen so be it,\u201d she said, missing the point that he\u2019d talked to the administrator without her knowledge.</p><p>\u201cMrs. Goldsmith told me there\u2019s another party interested.\u201d A sense of dread almost overwhelmed him. If they didn\u2019t act quickly, the unit would go to some other couple.</p><p>\u201cOf course she told you that,\u201d Rosalie said with unshakable confidence. \u201cThat\u2019s what she\u2019s supposed to say. It\u2019s a tactic, Harry. You, of all people, should know the things people will say when they\u2019re after a sale.\u201d</p><p>Frustration beat hard against his chest. \u201cBut, Rosalie....\u201d</p><p>\u201cHarry, sweetheart, don\u2019t be so concerned. If we lose this unit, another will come up later.\u201d</p><p>Without telling her what Dr. Snellgrove had said, Harry had no choice but to agree. \u201cPersonally, I\u2019d like this all settled before the holidays.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you mind if we wait?\u201d Rosalie asked. \u201cIt won\u2019t make any difference, will it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose you\u2019re right,\u201d he said reluctantly. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t really matter.\u201d Only it did, but Harry couldn\u2019t find it in his heart to tell her why.</p><p>Harry left the table and as much as he hated his walker, he reached for it. The damn thing was a nuisance, but at this stage it was a necessary one.</p><p>\u201cThe girls could help us move while they\u2019re here.\u201d He made the suggestion as he settled back into his recliner.</p><p>\u201cNot over Christmas, Harry. Please, sweetheart, I don\u2019t want to ask that of them.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. He wouldn\u2019t mention it again. Not tonight.</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t look good,\u201d Shirley had the audacity to say.</p><p>\u201cRosalie wants to wait until after Christmas.\u201d</p><p>Mercy didn\u2019t know what to do. \u201cThat won\u2019t work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d Both her friends turned to face her.</p><p>Mercy sighed, more burdened now than ever. \u201cBecause Harry will be in Heaven by then.\u201d</p><p>Ten</p><p>Joyce Fischer had found a table at the ultra-busy Nordstrom Caf\u00e9 by the time Beth got to the store. As soon as she appeared, her mother waved to catch her attention.</p><p>Beth felt wonderful and couldn\u2019t have disguised her mood had she tried.</p><p>\u201cHello, Mom,\u201d she said, giving her mother a quick hug.</p><p>\u201cI took the liberty of ordering for you, dear. I just got two of what we usually order.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s fine.\u201d Beth only had an hour for lunch and although she would\u2019ve liked to try something new rather than her standard soup du jour and turkey sandwich, she didn\u2019t object.</p><p>Taking off her coat, Beth draped it over her chair.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re positively glowing. What\u2019s going on?\u201d Her mother looked like she was about to rub her hands together in glee. \u201cIs it that young man from the computer game?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to meet.\u201d Beth wasn\u2019t sure how and why the situation had changed. Just as she was losing hope that they\u2019d ever take a chance, Peter had stepped forward. Without understanding why it had happened, she realized that a transformation had taken place.</p><p>They\u2019d logged on to play World of Warcraft last night and after a while had started exchanging messages again. In the beginning it wasn\u2019t anything special, just their normal chitchat. Then out of the blue Peter had made a startling admission.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s divorced,\u201d Beth informed her mother.</p><p>\u201cWell, dear, so are you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know...That\u2019s not the point. Peter and I were talking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn the phone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no, online. That\u2019s the only way we\u2019ve communicated so far.\u201d</p><p>Her mother frowned, then decided not to make whatever comment hovered on the tip of her tongue. \u201cGo on,\u201d she urged instead. \u201cI want to hear everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d Beth said, eager now. \u201cHe told me that it\u2019s taken him some time to get over the divorce, but he thinks he\u2019s ready to move on.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHow long has it been?\u201d her mother asked. \u201cI mean, since his divorce was final.\u201d</p><p>Beth frowned. Her mother was right; that was an important question. \u201cI didn\u2019t ask him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should, dear. If it\u2019s been less than a year, it might be best to move slowly and carefully in this relationship.\u201d Then, as if she regretted having given advice, she shook her head. \u201cFollow your heart. Don\u2019t listen to a thing I say.\u201d</p><p>Beth thought cynically that this was all part of the wager her parents had. Her mother didn\u2019t care if Peter was the brother of Frankenstein\u2019s monster as long as he showed up. \u201cYou really want him there for Christmas, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p> <p>Her mother\u2019s eyes brightened. \u201cIs there any possibility that might happen?\u201d</p><p>Beth shrugged. Despite her mother\u2019s bet\u2014and personally she felt Joyce deserved to lose\u2014she\u2019d like it if Peter could spend Christmas with her. She wanted to invite him, but it was a lot to ask of someone she hadn\u2019t even met. Everything depended on this weekend.</p><p>Her mother waved one hand impatiently. \u201cSo you told him you\u2019re divorced, too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, of course, and then we both started talking so fast it was hard for my fingers to keep up with my thoughts.\u201d Peter had been deeply hurt by his wife, who\u2019d more or less kicked him out of the house and excluded him from her life. It\u2019d been painful and harsh, and he\u2019d taken the breakup of his marriage hard.</p><p>Beth understood. She\u2019d experienced the same grief over the death of her own marriage. In the course of their conversation, they\u2019d talked about regrets and all the things they might\u2019ve done to save their marriages. Based on the few details Peter had divulged, Beth regarded his ex-wife as cold and calculating.</p> <p>She talked about John in ways she never had with anyone else, including her parents. It was as though a festering blister had burst inside her and she spewed out the devastating pain of her own divorce.</p><p>The game was forgotten as they continued talking. It was after midnight when Peter reminded her that they both needed to be at work in the morning. Reluctantly Beth had signed off.</p><p>\u201cWhat else did he say?\u201d her mother asked. \u201cDid you tell him your real name is Marybeth?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHardly,\u201d she cried, annoyed that her mother would ask such an inane question. \u201cAnd don\u2019t you tell him, either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you did invite him for Christmas?\u201d Her mother looked pleased beyond measure.</p><p>\u201cNo...not yet.\u201d The optimism Beth felt was a sign of her excitement about the way their relationship was developing. No man had interested her this much since college, when she\u2019d first met John. Peter gave her hope. Maybe this wouldn\u2019t go anywhere, but at least she was finally taking a risk. Finally willing to try again.</p> <p>The server brought their lunches, giving Beth a respite from her mother\u2019s relentless questioning. She tasted her cream of broccoli soup, and it took a few minutes for the conversation to return to Peter.</p><p>\u201cYou do expect to introduce him to your family, don\u2019t you?\u201d Her mother smiled expectantly at Beth, the turkey sandwich poised in front of her mouth.</p><p>\u201cIf things go well.\u201d She nodded. \u201cWe have a lot in common, Peter and me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s wonderful, dear.\u201d</p><p>Beth felt the giddy sensation of everything coming together at last. \u201cI never dreamed that after all these months we\u2019d connect the way we have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell?\u201d Her mother paused. \u201cWhen are you going to meet?\u201d Before Beth could answer, she added, \u201cSoon, I hope.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs tomorrow soon enough for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSaturday? But I thought you were going to Leavenworth with Heidi.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re meeting Peter there?\u201d</p><p>Beth nodded. Peter seemed to be a closet romantic, although she suspected he\u2019d never admit it. He was the one who\u2019d wanted to have this initial meeting right away. He\u2019d mentioned getting together on Saturday for lunch, and Beth had said she\u2019d be in Leavenworth. Undeterred, Peter had suggested meeting there.</p><p>\u201cBut how will that work when you don\u2019t know what he looks like? Good grief, Beth, do you have any idea how crowded that town can get, especially this time of year?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got it all figured out. Heidi and Sam and I are taking the train with the kids and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeter will meet you on the train?\u201d her mother broke in.</p><p>\u201cNot exactly. The train sold out weeks ago, so Peter\u2019s taking the bus. We arrive at eleven and, depending on the weather, he should get in around noon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe train\u2019s always late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, ye of little faith.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have a lot of faith,\u201d her mother said. \u201cBut I happen to be practical, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe took that into consideration, Mother. The bus could be late, too, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, of course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re meeting by the gazebo in the center of town at four o\u2019clock.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not earlier?\u201d her mother demanded.</p><p>Beth sighed. \u201cI\u2019m there to spend the day with Heidi, remember? Besides, if this doesn\u2019t work out...\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d Joyce said dismissively. \u201cBut how will you recognize each other?\u201d</p><p>Beth described their plan. Peter would be carrying a single long-stemmed red rose and wearing a baseball cap with a Seahawks emblem. She, meanwhile, would be wearing a full-length navy wool coat and a red knit hat and muffler.</p><p>They should be able to find each other without difficulty. Then they\u2019d watch the tree-lighting ceremony together. The train was scheduled to depart at six-thirty; his bus would leave shortly after that. They\u2019d spend just a couple of hours in each other\u2019s company\u2014a safe length of time whether the meeting went well or not. He hadn\u2019t said so, but Beth had the distinct feeling that if this meeting did go well, Peter would ask to see her again on Sunday.</p><p>\u201cYou sound so hopeful,\u201d her mother said.</p><p>\u201cI am.\u201d Beth had a positive feeling about this.</p><p>\u201cWhat if...what if Peter isn\u2019t as good-looking as you expect?\u201d She seemed genuinely concerned that this might be a possibility.</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d John had been drop-dead gorgeous. She\u2019d been the envy of all her friends, and what she\u2019d discovered was that good looks made very little difference. Most important was character. Moral fiber, sense of honor and kindness were far more compelling qualities in Beth\u2019s eyes.</p><p>\u201cYou say that now,\u201d her mother warned, \u201cbut you might change your mind once you meet him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps.\u201d But even as she said it, Beth was convinced that her feelings wouldn\u2019t change. If there was anything she\u2019d learned from her divorce, it was that looks could be deceiving. John had been completely self-absorbed, selfish, irresponsible.... It was pointless to rehash his shortcomings, of which there\u2019d been plenty.</p><p>They finished their lunch and because she had a few minutes to spare, Beth and her mother did some window-shopping. Seattle was a magical city at Christmastime. Beth loved the festive air\u2014the decorations everywhere, the cheerful crowds, the music. Entertainers sang and played instruments. She and Joyce stopped to listen to a violinist whose rendition of \u201cSilent Night\u201d was exquisite as people bustled to and from stores with their bags and packages. The cold wind stung her face and she glanced up at the sky for any sign of snow. Her step was lighter and for the first time in years she felt a rush of joyful anticipation about Christmas.</p><p>Her mother wasn\u2019t the only one to notice her improved mood. Lloyd, the attorney who\u2019d introduced her to the World of Warcraft, commented on it when she returned from lunch.</p><p>\u201cYou seem to be mighty happy about something,\u201d he said, smiling at her.</p><p>\u201cI am,\u201d she responded cryptically.</p><p>At closing time, she hurried home. As soon as she was back in her condo, Beth logged online, hoping Peter would be there.</p><p>He was.</p><p>Did you have a good day? he typed.</p><p>Great. What about you?</p><p>He didn\u2019t reply immediately. It couldn\u2019t have been better, he eventually wrote. Thank you for listening while I poured out my woes about my marriage last night. I don\u2019t often talk about it. I wouldn\u2019t have with you, but in all fairness I felt you needed to know.</p><p>Peter, thank you, she hurriedly typed back. I can\u2019t tell you how freeing it was for me to tell you about my divorce. It\u2019s not a subject I bring up lightly. I felt like such a failure when we split up and that feeling never went away.</p><p>I know. That\u2019s how I felt when my marriage ended, too.</p><p>It seems we have even more in common than we realized, she told him.</p><p>I was thinking the same thing.</p><p>They chatted for most of an hour until Beth\u2019s stomach growled, reminding her that she hadn\u2019t eaten dinner. Peter couldn\u2019t stay online long because he was seeing a friend, so they ended their conversation.</p><p>It was just as well, because Beth had to call Heidi and let her friend know there\u2019d been a small change in plans.</p><p>After she reached her, Beth explained that she\u2019d be seeing Peter in Leavenworth and said she hoped Heidi didn\u2019t mind.</p><p>\u201cMind? Of course I don\u2019t mind,\u201d Heidi told her. \u201cI think it\u2019s so romantic that you two will meet up there. All we need now is some snow for the day to be absolutely perfect.\u201d</p><p>Snow in Santa\u2019s Village\u2014that would indeed be marvelous.</p><p>\u201cI wonder if I\u2019m expecting too much,\u201d she said, suddenly anxious.</p><p>\u201cHow can you help it?\u201d Heidi asked. \u201cHe does seem too good to be true.\u201d</p><p>No dating service could have set her up with a more suitable candidate. They agreed on practically everything they\u2019d discussed. In the past week, Beth had learned that they both read the same books, liked the same kinds of food\u2014Mexican and Chinese\u2014and adored anchovies on Caesar salad but not pizza. Granted, those might be superficial similarities, but unlike John, Peter was responsible and dedicated, both qualities she admired. She knew this from his loyalty to his friends, his seriousness about his career\u2014as a coffee buyer at Starbucks\u2014his affection toward his parents and many other examples she\u2019d gleaned.</p><p>Maybe he was too good to be true, as Heidi had said. But Beth\u2019s instincts told her that Peter was a man she wanted to know better, a man worth knowing better. Not that her instincts had been what you\u2019d call reliable in the past. So, before things went any further, she had to learn if this could become a viable relationship\u2014and there was only one way to find out.</p><p>In other words, Beth was counting on their face-to-face meeting to tell her whether these feelings for Peter were real\u2014or just a fantasy concocted during their online adventures.</p><p>Eleven</p><p>Carter could hardly wait to get to school. As soon as the bus dropped him off he headed for the playground, instead of running into the classroom with Timmy and his other friends. Behind the building, he looked carefully around.</p><p>Rusty was nowhere to be seen. His heart sank.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing out here?\u201d Timmy asked, chasing after him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNothing,\u201d Carter murmured, his shoulders slumping. All night he could barely sleep thinking about the stray. The more he thought about it, the more he realized this wasn\u2019t just any dog. This was his dog. His Rusty. God had sent him this dog. Rusty was the answer to Carter\u2019s prayer.</p><p>\u201cWanna play soccer?\u201d Timmy asked. \u201cI can get Cameron and Isaiah and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, thanks.\u201d</p><p>Timmy looked as dejected as Carter felt. \u201cIt\u2019s cold out here. Let\u2019s go inside.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAll right.\u201d Timmy followed him off the playground and into the building.</p><p>When classes started, he had trouble paying attention to Ms. Jensen. Carter kept wondering what had happened to Rusty. He worried that Animal Control had picked him up, and then worried that they hadn\u2019t.</p><p>Deep down, Carter knew that if Rusty was at a shelter, he\u2019d at least be out of the cold. And there\u2019d be plenty of food for him. But Carter had brought an extra-big lunch today, just in case.</p><p>After the recess bell rang, his friends dashed out the door, eager to put on their winter clothes and get onto the playground.</p><p>\u201cCarter.\u201d Ms. Jensen stopped him.</p> <p>Carter trudged over to his teacher. \u201cYes, Ms. Jensen?\u201d He thought about asking if she\u2019d seen the stray dog recently, but then he remembered Mr. Nicholson\u2019s warning.</p><p>\u201cIs everything all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Ms. Jensen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt home, I mean.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. He wanted to tell her that his family wasn\u2019t getting Christmas presents this year and that he\u2019d lied to his friends. He still felt bad about misleading Timmy. But he didn\u2019t want the other kids to know that the only gift under the tree would be underwear from his grandmother.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t seem yourself. Are you feeling well?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m fine, Ms. Jensen. Can I go outside now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right. Oh, and thank your mother for the cookies she sent me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will,\u201d Carter promised.</p><p>As he hurried onto the playground, Carter noticed that his teacher was still watching him. No sooner was he outside with his friends than he saw Rusty. Carter could hardly breathe, he was so excited.</p><p>Rusty saw Carter, too, and even though one of the third-grade girls was offering him a cracker, the dog shot across the schoolyard. Carter knelt down to greet his friend. Rusty licked his face and seemed as happy to see Carter as Carter was to see him. Carter dug inside his pocket for a meatball he\u2019d managed to smuggle out of the refrigerator early that morning. Rusty gobbled it up and looked to Carter for more.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Carter told him, and then because he was so ecstatic, he wrapped his arms around the dog. He didn\u2019t care that Rusty was filthy or that the sleeves of his winter jacket came away all muddy. His mother would be upset, but even her displeasure was worth the enjoyment Carter received from this special dog.</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t let Mr. Nicholson see you,\u201d Carter warned, then ran over to where his friends were playing.</p><p>Rusty followed Carter wherever he went. When Mr. Nicholson stepped into the yard, the stray quickly and quietly disappeared, just as if he understood.</p> <p>Carter turned around and looked for him, but Rusty was nowhere in sight. Then he saw that the dog had gone into the trees that separated the schoolyard from the nearby houses.</p><p>\u201cGood boy,\u201d Carter whispered. Rusty was no dummy. He knew who his friends were\u2014and his enemies.</p><p>At lunchtime, Carter only ate his apple. The rest he saved for Rusty. Once again the mutt gobbled the food and gazed up at Carter with bright, shining eyes that revealed his gratitude.</p><p>Carter petted Rusty\u2019s head, although his hand got really dirty. What would happen to the dog over the holidays, when there was no one at the school? Who\u2019d feed Rusty then? Who\u2019d watch out for him? Carter already knew the answer. No one. After today, school was over for the year, and the yard would remain empty until the first week of January. Rusty could starve by then.</p><p>Holding the dog\u2019s muddy face between his hands, Carter peered into his deep brown eyes. Disregarding what his father had said, Carter whispered, \u201cRusty, listen, I need you to follow me home.\u201d</p><p>The dog blinked and stared back at him intently.</p><p>\u201cI take bus number seven. Follow that bus, okay?\u201d</p><p>Rusty cocked his head to one side.</p><p>Carter didn\u2019t know what more he could do. Disconsolate, he tried to accept that the dog wouldn\u2019t understand him, no matter how many times he repeated the information. After today, when the bus delivered Carter to his home, it was unlikely he\u2019d ever see Rusty again. Carter couldn\u2019t bear to have that happen, but he had to prepare himself for disappointment.</p><p>Because it was the last day before winter break, school was dismissed an hour early. While Carter lined up with his friends for bus number seven, he scanned the area for Rusty. Again the dog was nowhere to be seen, and once again Carter\u2019s heart fell.</p><p>\u201cYou wanna come to my house and play video games?\u201d Timmy asked, plopping down on the seat next to Carter.</p><p>\u201cNo, thanks.\u201d</p><p>His friend seemed dejected.</p><p>\u201cCan I come on Monday?\u201d Carter asked.</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d Timmy perked up right away. \u201cI\u2019ll show you all my presents under the tree.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Carter tried to smile but it was hard. He was glad that his friend was getting lots of gifts. He wanted gifts, too\u2014stacks and stacks of them. But Carter would give up every single one for Rusty.</p><p>God had answered his prayer, Carter told himself, struggling to believe. Rusty would find him. God had sent Rusty to that schoolyard and now God would figure out a way to bring him to Carter\u2019s house.</p><p>The bus stopped, and Cameron and Isaiah got off and ran to their home at the end of the street. Their house was the biggest and nicest in the neighborhood.</p><p>The next stop was for Carter and Bailey\u2019s block. Grabbing his backpack, Carter felt his heart beating hard. He hoped with all his might that Rusty would find his way. Bus number seven. He\u2019d told Rusty to follow bus number seven. Carter knew it would be a miracle if the dog had understood him, but God was in charge of miracles, and He\u2019d already worked one. If He could do one miracle and send him a dog, then God should be able to accomplish two.</p><p>When the doors of the bus opened, Carter stepped down and looked in both directions. Rusty wasn\u2019t there. His heart felt about as heavy as...as a two-ton truck.</p><p>\u201cMove,\u201d Bailey said, coming down the steps and shoving him in the back.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d Carter complained.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re blocking the exit,\u201d Bailey informed him in that prim tattletale voice she sometimes used.</p><p>Carter got completely off the bus then and started slowly down the sidewalk to their house. Bailey walked beside him.</p><p>\u201cI saw you with that dog on the playground again,\u201d his sister said, matching her steps to his. She held her backpack with both hands, leaning into the cold wind.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not gonna tell Mom and Dad, are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. He\u2019s a nice dog.\u201d</p><p>Carter nodded. \u201cHe\u2019s smart, too.\u201d But not smart enough to follow bus seven. Not smart enough to know that winter break had begun and there\u2019d be no one at the school to feed him or play with him or anything else. Sooner or later, he\u2019d be picked up by Animal Control.</p><p>\u201cYou should wash off your coat before Mom sees it,\u201d his sister warned.</p><p>Carter had forgotten about the mud on his sleeves. \u201cI will. You go in the house first, all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>True to her word, Bailey went into the house and while she distracted their mother, Carter removed his coat in their bedroom, then entered the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cMs. Jensen thanked you for the cookies,\u201d Carter told his mother. She was folding towels fresh from the dryer on the kitchen table and nodded absently. \u201cYour father\u2019s working late this evening,\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019s getting overtime pay, and that\u2019s good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe said we should have dinner without him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan we have macaroni and cheese out of a box?\u201d Carter asked. That was one of his favorites, and he knew it must not cost very much because his mother never objected when he asked for it.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI wanted hot dogs,\u201d Bailey whined.</p><p>His mother smiled. \u201cWe\u2019ll have both.\u201d</p><p>While his sister helped their mother put away the towels, Carter loped into the bathroom for a clean washcloth and soaked it. Then he wrung it out and took it into the bedroom where he\u2019d put his coat. He wiped off the sleeves. The washcloth got muddy, but his coat looked a lot better.</p><p>\u201cMom said we could watch television,\u201d Bailey said, coming into the room.</p><p>Since his sister would choose sissy programs, Carter wasn\u2019t interested.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m gonna go read.\u201d</p><p>That was an activity his parents always approved of. The only reason he decided on it now was that he didn\u2019t feel like doing anything else. He didn\u2019t want to visit his friends or watch television or even play with his toys. He just wanted to forget Rusty. Apparently God only did one miracle at a time. Carter had been wrong.</p><p>Slumping down on the floor, he opened his book, but he could hardly concentrate on the story. About fifteen minutes later, his sister barreled into the bedroom. \u201cCarter, come and look!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust come,\u201d she insisted, annoying him with every word.</p><p>\u201cOh, all right,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>She led him to the living room, where the television was situated. She pointed out the front window.</p><p>There was Rusty, walking up and down the sidewalk, looking this way and that.</p><p>Carter nearly screamed with happiness. \u201cIt\u2019s Rusty!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d His sister\u2019s eyes were huge.</p><p>Without bothering to get his coat, Carter burst out the door. \u201cRusty!\u201d he cried. \u201cRusty.\u201d</p><p>As soon as the dog heard Carter, he turned and bolted toward him. Carter dared not hug him now because his mother would see all the mud. But how could she be angry? God had sent them this dog. Carter had proof that Rusty was the answer to his prayer.</p><p>\u201cThis way, boy,\u201d Carter said and led him to the back of the house. Because their mother had told them their dad would be late, Carter put Rusty in the garage. By the time he\u2019d finished, his teeth were chattering with cold and excitement.</p><p>\u201cAre you going to tell Mom?\u201d Bailey asked, meeting him in the hallway.</p><p>\u201cNot yet.\u201d A plan was taking shape in Carter\u2019s mind. \u201cIf Mom asks where I am, tell her I\u2019m taking a bath.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you?\u201d Bailey wanted to know.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He shouldn\u2019t have to spell everything out to his sister. \u201cI\u2019m going to give Rusty one. When he\u2019s all cleaned up, Mom will see what a good dog he is and talk Dad into letting me keep him.\u201d</p><p>Bailey\u2019s eyes widened and she nodded conspiratorially.</p><p>Carter filled the bathtub with warm water and then at an opportune moment, went into the garage and scooped up Rusty. He was heavier than Carter had thought but it was important that he not leave dog tracks on the floor. Once inside the house, Carter glanced around to make sure his mother wasn\u2019t looking. Then he hurried down the hall to the bathroom and shut the door with his foot. He gently set the dog in the bath, then turned quickly to lock the door. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>It didn\u2019t take Carter long to make a startling discovery about Rusty. When he did, tears sprang to his eyes. Beneath all the caked mud and dirt, Rusty had auburn-colored fur. This really was the dog God had sent. He was perfect in every way.</p><p>Rusty loved the water. He stood still while Carter lathered him with the shampoo their mother had bought for him and Bailey. Then he rinsed him off with the cup that was by the sink. Rusty didn\u2019t bark even once. Using the towel still warm from the dryer, Carter had just lifted Rusty out of the tub to dry him when Rusty began to shake himself like crazy, spraying water in every direction.</p><p>\u201cRusty!\u201d Carter protested, raising his hands to his face to wipe off the water.</p><p>\u201cCarter,\u201d his mother called from the other side of the bathroom door. \u201cWho\u2019s in there with you?\u201d</p> <p>He wanted to lie and answer no one, but he remembered what his stomach had felt like when he\u2019d lied. \u201cA friend,\u201d Carter called back. That was true. Rusty was his friend.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing in there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh...\u201d</p><p>The door handle twisted and then his mother called again. \u201cCarter, unlock the door this minute!\u201d</p><p>Carter bit his lip as Rusty gazed back at him trustingly. \u201cOkay, boy,\u201d he whispered. \u201cIt\u2019s showtime.\u201d</p> <p>Carter unlatched the bathroom door and opened it for his mother. She stood there, hands on her hips. The moment she saw Rusty, her eyes went soft\u2014and then immediately went hard again.</p><p>\u201cOh, Carter, a dog.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut this is my dog, Rusty. God sent him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCarter...\u201d His mother was almost crying. \u201cLook at the bathtub. It\u2019s filthy.\u201d Sure enough, there was dirt on the bottom of the tub and the ring around the sides was pretty bad, too.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll clean it up,\u201d Carter promised. He would\u2019ve done so earlier, but his mother had interrupted him.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a really good dog, Mom,\u201d Carter felt obliged to tell her.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sure he is, honey. It\u2019s just that I don\u2019t know what we\u2019re going to tell your father.\u201d</p><p>Carter looked at Rusty and then at the worried expression on his mother\u2019s face. He didn\u2019t know what they\u2019d tell his dad, either.</p><p>Twelve</p><p>Harry woke with a start. His eyes flew open as panic overtook him. He gasped for air, unable to get his breath. No matter how hard he struggled, he couldn\u2019t breathe. The pain intensified, suffocating him.</p><p>Blindly reaching for the small bottle he kept at his bedside, he popped a nitro pill under his tongue and waited. This had happened before in the early hours of the morning. It felt as though he was immersed in water and couldn\u2019t get any air.</p><p>Could this be his time?</p><p>It almost seemed that God intended to take him right then and there. Quelling the panic, Harry surrendered his life to God and then all at once, the ache lessened and his lungs filled with glorious air. The relief was instantaneous. He dragged in a second deep breath and realized he\u2019d had a narrow escape yet again.</p><p>Wide awake now, Harry watched the jerky movements of the second hand on the old-fashioned alarm clock by his bedside. Rosalie had a clock radio, but he continued to use the one he\u2019d always had. It needed winding every couple of days, but had served him well through the years and he could see no reason to change. The ticking was a familiar comfort.</p> <p>Two minutes passed and he was still breathing normally.</p><p>His close call reminded him that he wouldn\u2019t be around for Rosalie much longer; naturally he wanted to get her settled before he left her. She was determined to spend Christmas in this old house. Harry couldn\u2019t deny his wife that. But while he sympathized with her feelings, Harry didn\u2019t have that kind of time. His fear was that when he was gone, Rosalie would just keep putting off the move. Harry couldn\u2019t let that happen.</p><p>First thing after New Year\u2019s, he\u2019d make the arrangements, he decided, praying God would give him that long.</p><p>Harry sat up in bed.</p><p>\u201cHarry?\u201d Rosalie was instantly awake. The slightest movement on his part seemed to alert her. Similarly, when their girls were small, she\u2019d wakened at the tiniest sound. Harry had never understood it because his wife was usually a sound sleeper. Not when their daughters were young, though, and not with him now.</p><p>He\u2019d disturbed her sleep far too many times. After the full day they\u2019d had touring the assisted-living complex Rosalie was exhausted, and Harry didn\u2019t want to interrupt her rest tonight.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine, sweetheart,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>Her eyes drifted closed and she went back to sleep. Harry lay very still and listened to the regular cadence of her breathing. Twice his own went shallow and then regained an even consistency.</p><p>It went without saying that God had granted him yet another reprieve. Death would come. Not now, but soon\u2014sooner than he would\u2019ve liked.</p><p>When it became apparent that he wasn\u2019t going to fall asleep immediately, Harry slowly shifted the covers aside. He might as well empty his bladder, which he needed to do two or three times a night. Darn nuisance it was, but that was another symptom of age and his body\u2019s growing demands.</p><p>Once he\u2019d finished, he started back to bed and remembered that he\u2019d left his walker in the other room. Since he hated having to use the contraption, he sometimes forgot it. He knew he was in trouble; the short trip to the bathroom had depleted his strength and without the walker, he couldn\u2019t manage even the few steps back to his bed. Weak as he was, he leaned his shoulder against the wall, considering his options. There weren\u2019t any. He needed help and he needed it now.</p><p>\u201cRosalie,\u201d he called. His voice was barely a whisper. As soon as he\u2019d reassured her that he was all right, she\u2019d gone back to sleep. So much for the highly sensitized hearing he\u2019d credited her with a few minutes earlier.</p><p>Despite all his resolve, all his determination, Harry began to slide toward the floor. Rosalie wasn\u2019t strong enough to help him up. If he fell, he\u2019d stay that way until morning. If he survived until morning....</p><p>\u201cIs this it?\u201d Mercy cried, wringing her hands. \u201cIs Harry going to die now?\u201d She needed direction. Her initial response was to hold him upright, to help him. Angels routinely made physical appearances on Earth, but it was important to go through the proper channels, to get permission first. She didn\u2019t have time for that. She\u2019d certainly bent the rules on occasion, but she couldn\u2019t risk interfering with God\u2019s plan for Harry.</p><p>\u201cGabriel,\u201d she shouted helplessly toward the heavens. \u201cI don\u2019t know what to do.\u201d</p><p>A second later, the Archangel was at her side.</p><p>\u201cIs it Harry\u2019s time to come to Heaven?\u201d She pleaded for an answer before daring to take matters into her own hands.</p><p>The Archangel seemed strangely calm; Mercy was anything but. She hovered close to Harry, anxious to do what she could, awaiting word from Gabriel.</p><p>She could tell that Harry\u2019s strength was draining away. As she watched, the old man\u2019s eyes widened and he placed one hand over his heart.</p><p>\u201cGabriel,\u201d Mercy shouted. \u201cDo something.\u201d Hurriedly she revised her request. \u201cCan I help Harry?\u201d And because she\u2019d come to genuinely love this old man, she added, \u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel nodded. \u201cTake him back to bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Mercy whispered, greatly relieved.</p><p>Harry\u2019s eyes widened again. Only this time it wasn\u2019t his heart that worried him. Standing directly in front of him in plain view was a woman dressed in white. A woman with...wings. An angel? She regarded him with a gentle, loving look.</p><p>\u201cI could use some help here,\u201d he said. In other circumstances Harry might think he\u2019d died. The continuing ache in his chest told him otherwise. The pain intensified with every beat of his heart.</p><p>The beautiful angel stepped toward him and silently slipped her arm around his waist. She didn\u2019t seem to have any trouble handling his bulk. The next thing Harry knew, he was in bed and his rescuer was gone. Vanished. She\u2019d disappeared as quickly as she\u2019d come.</p><p>Grateful to have averted a catastrophe, or what had seemed like one a few minutes ago, Harry tried to figure out what had just happened. The angel might\u2019ve been a figment of his imagination except for one thing. He\u2019d been slumped against the wall with no strength left, no ability to stand upright. His walker rested next to his chest of drawers, where it had been all along. But now he was safely tucked into bed, next to Rosalie.</p><p>Harry blinked to clear his eyesight and picked up his glasses. Maybe then he\u2019d be able to see the angel a second time. He peered into the darkness, resisting the urge to turn on the light.</p><p>She was gone. Truly gone.</p><p>Still, Harry was convinced she\u2019d been there. She\u2019d helped him back to bed. What a beauty she\u2019d been, too. He\u2019d always wondered about angels, and now he knew with certainty that they were real.</p><p>\u201cWill he be all right now?\u201d Mercy asked, leaning over the slumbering Harry.</p><p>\u201cHarry will sleep comfortably for the rest of the night,\u201d Gabriel told her.</p><p>\u201cIn the morning will he remember any of this?\u201d Part of her felt it might be best if the incident was erased from Harry\u2019s mind. Then again, she wanted him to know that God was looking down on him, and that he was deeply loved. The mighty angel Gabriel himself had come to Harry\u2019s aid.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll remember. This close to death, the separation between Heaven and Earth is only partially veiled,\u201d Gabriel explained.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s almost as if Harry has one foot in Heaven and one still on Earth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly.\u201d The Archangel began to leave, then paused. \u201cI\u2019m proud of you, Mercy,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cYou are?\u201d She beamed, but she wasn\u2019t sure what she\u2019d done to warrant such high praise. Gabriel didn\u2019t issue praise often. He was a strict taskmaster but a fair one.</p><p>Apparently reading her mind, Gabriel elaborated. \u201cYou didn\u2019t take it upon yourself to make a decision on the matter. You turned to Heaven and to me for help. That shows a new maturity.\u201d</p><p>Bubbling with pleasure at his words, Mercy fluttered her wings. Thankfully the Archangel hadn\u2019t been around when she\u2019d sent Shirley scrambling in the electric cart.</p><p>\u201cYou did give me cause for concern at the Safeway store, however.\u201d</p><p>So Gabriel knew.</p><p>As if his words had summoned her, Shirley appeared.</p><p>\u201cI knew Mercy was responsible for that unfortunate event,\u201d she cried, glaring at her friend.</p><p>\u201cIt w-was all in jest,\u201d Mercy stammered, embarrassed now. At times, especially while on Earth, she adopted a more human nature than an angelic one. As a human might have said, Shirley had been asking for it.</p><p>\u201cShall we discuss this elsewhere?\u201d Gabriel said, gesturing down at the sleeping Harry and Rosalie.</p><p>\u201cBy all means.\u201d</p><p>The three of them moved to the living room. When they got there, Mercy saw Goodness on top of the Christmas tree Harry and Rosalie\u2019s son-in-law had set up in a corner of the living room.</p><p>\u201cActually, I\u2019m glad to see you, Gabriel,\u201d Shirley said. \u201cI\u2019m having the worst time with my assignment.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAre you, now?\u201d Gabriel asked, eyebrows raised. Mercy and Goodness exchanged a sly glance. They had both agreed that Shirley\u2019s was by far the least complicated of the assignments.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Carter,\u201d Shirley said after a moment\u2019s hesitation. \u201cHe\u2019s found a stray dog.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the problem is?\u201d</p><p>Shirley shrugged uncomfortably. \u201cThe problem is that his father still insists the family can\u2019t afford a dog. I was trying to work around that.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHow?\u201d Gabriel asked.</p><p>\u201cHis father worked overtime this evening and that money will come in handy for Christmas.\u201d Shirley rubbed her hands together nervously. \u201cOnly...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d Gabriel pressed.</p><p>Mercy had to admit she was curious, too, and apparently so was Goodness, because she\u2019d left the Christmas tree to join them.</p><p>\u201cRusty, that\u2019s the dog, followed bus number seven home, just like Carter instructed him to.\u201d</p> <p>Gabriel frowned. \u201cDo earthly canines generally understand such detailed instructions?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Shirley cried. \u201cThat\u2019s just the point! I was afraid you\u2019d think I had something to do with it and I promise you I didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t?\u201d Goodness asked skeptically.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m innocent,\u201d Shirley said.</p><p>Actually, Mercy would\u2019ve thought better of her friend if she had been involved.</p><p>\u201cEvery bit of information I\u2019ve received indicates that Carter is not supposed to have this dog.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re sure about that?\u201d Gabriel murmured, and his brow furrowed. \u201cWhere\u2019s the stray now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is another problem,\u201d Shirley said. \u201cCarter and his mother have put Rusty in the laundry room. Like I told you, David\u2014that\u2019s his father\u2014worked late on Friday night and Carter convinced his mother to keep Rusty hidden until morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo the dog\u2019s inside the house?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor now,\u201d Shirley said. \u201cI didn\u2019t think Laurie would let him keep the dog for another minute but I was wrong.\u201d Shirley shook her head. \u201cI don\u2019t know what to tell you about this dog. Not only is he able to read\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe reads?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe knew which bus was number seven, didn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you think he might have seen which bus Carter boarded?\u201d Mercy suggested.</p><p>\u201cMay I please get on with my story?\u201d Shirley asked in dignified tones.</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t let me stop you,\u201d Mercy muttered. Gabriel sent her a quelling look.</p><p>\u201cNot only that, this dog instinctively seems to know who\u2019s his friend and who isn\u2019t, and he has an uncanny way of making himself scarce when necessary. It\u2019s almost as if...as if he has heavenly qualities.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI find that interesting,\u201d Gabriel murmured. \u201cReport back to me on any further developments, will you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, of course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGoodness?\u201d Gabriel said, turning to the third angel. \u201cHow are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat! Beth and Peter are about to meet. Isn\u2019t it wonderful?\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcellent work.\u201d And with that, Gabriel returned to Heaven.</p><p>Harry woke and saw that Rosalie was awake. \u201cThe most astounding thing happened last night,\u201d he rushed to tell his wife.</p><p>Still sleepy, Rosalie blinked several times. \u201cDid you have another of your attacks?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but that isn\u2019t what I want to tell you about.\u201d</p><p>His wife raised herself up on one elbow. \u201cFor heaven\u2019s sake, Harry, what\u2019s got you so excited?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI saw an angel!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow, Harry...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know what you\u2019re thinking, Rosalie, but it\u2019s true.\u201d</p><p>His wife frowned, and Harry sensed that she wanted to believe what he\u2019d told her but had difficulty accepting it as the truth.</p><p>Later that morning, Harry heard his wife chatting on the phone with their youngest daughter. \u201cI\u2019m not sure what to think, Donna. Your father\u2019s telling me he saw...Well, he swears he saw an angel.\u201d</p><p>Harry was sorry now that he\u2019d mentioned this event to Rosalie. She\u2019d apparently concluded that he was losing his mind.</p><p>\u201cYes, yes, I agree,\u201d Rosalie said, keeping her voice low. \u201cPlease do.\u201d</p><p>A few minutes later, she hung up and then joined Harry in front of the television. \u201cI was on the phone with Donna,\u201d she said conversationally, as if he hadn\u2019t noticed. Harry knew exactly who was on the other end of the line.</p><p>Nevertheless he didn\u2019t comment one way or the other.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s going to come early for Christmas. Isn\u2019t that nice?\u201d</p><p>If the story about the angel had made his youngest daughter decide to come home early, then all the better. His angel had done him even more good than he\u2019d realized.</p><p>Thirteen</p><p>Leavenworth was everything Beth had imagined it would be. When the train pulled in, the sun was shining, and the freshly fallen snow glistened brightly. The entire town was a Christmas wonderland, unlike anything she\u2019d ever seen. Main Street was closed to cars, and in the center of the wide street, burn barrels had been set up, where people could gather to warm their hands. Children were sledding down the short slope next to the gazebo, while a group of costumed carolers entertained the crowd.</p><p>It was at this gazebo that Beth Fischer would be meeting Peter in a few hours.</p><p>Once they were off the train, Heidi, Sam, two-year-old Adam and Beth toured the area. Adam wanted to go sledding, so Sam quickly purchased a round plastic sled. Soon father and son were gliding down the incline while Heidi took photographs.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll put one of these in our Christmas letter,\u201d she told Beth excitedly.</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t it a little late to be mailing out cards?\u201d Beth teased. Heidi was always late. In fact, last year\u2019s Christmas cards had arrived in mid-January. Heidi had said that Beth should either consider them very late or exceptionally early.</p><p>Beth had been too nervous to eat all day and seeing a vendor selling roasted chestnuts, she purchased a small bag to share with her friend.</p><p>Heidi bit into one. \u201cHey, these aren\u2019t bad. They\u2019re kind of sweet.\u201d</p><p>Beth tried one, too, and then another. Now she could say she\u2019d tasted chestnuts roasting on an open fire, just like the Christmas song said.</p><p>As they strolled down the street taking in the sights and smells and sounds of Christmas, Beth found herself studying faces. She wondered if Peter\u2019s bus had come in yet. Could that tall, handsome man be him? When a little girl leaped into his arms, Beth decided it probably wasn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cAre you sorry you agreed to meet Peter so late in the day?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said tersely.</p><p>Soon after that, Sam caught up with them. Adam, bundled from head to foot, was asleep in his father\u2019s arms, exhausted from their outing in the snow.</p><p>\u201cWe were just talking about Beth\u2019s appointment,\u201d Heidi told her husband.</p><p>\u201cI hope you and your WoW partner have a way to connect if something goes wrong,\u201d the ever-practical Sam said. \u201cThere must be a thousand people here this afternoon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeter e-mailed me his cell phone number.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you give him yours?\u201d Heidi asked.</p><p>\u201cNo, I didn\u2019t think of it.\u201d That wasn\u2019t completely accurate. \u201cActually, I meant to, but we started talking and I forgot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not a good sign,\u201d Sam began. \u201cWhat if\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSam,\u201d Heidi interrupted. \u201cEverything\u2019s going to work out fine.\u201d</p><p>Beth hoped her friend was right. \u201cYou\u2019ll come with me, won\u2019t you?\u201d she asked Heidi. The time was growing closer. At three o\u2019clock, it started to snow. Clouds obscured the sky as dusk fell over the town; by four-thirty it would be completely dark.</p><p>\u201cCome with you?\u201d Heidi repeated. \u201cYou\u2019re kidding, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHeidi, please. I\u2019m so nervous I\u2019m about to throw up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis should be interesting. All you\u2019ve had to eat is a couple of roasted chestnuts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t joke,\u201d Beth muttered. \u201cI\u2019m serious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Heidi said. \u201cI\u2019ll come if you really want me to, but I\u2019m only going to stay long enough for the two of you to meet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if we don\u2019t like each other?\u201d Beth asked, feeling a sense of dread. She was bringing so many hopes, so much yearning, to this encounter that she was afraid she\u2019d set herself up for failure.</p><p>The night before, as they exchanged instant messages, Peter was the one who\u2019d seemed anxious.</p><p>They\u2019d tried to reassure each other. That was when he\u2019d given her his phone number. Online they had so much to talk about, and Beth sincerely hoped the chemistry that seemed to spark between them on the screen translated into real life.</p><p>At ten minutes to four, Beth and Heidi made their way toward the gazebo, where Peter would be waiting for her. She\u2019d know him by the long-stemmed red rose and his Seahawks hat.</p><p>\u201cThis is the most romantic date I\u2019ve ever heard about,\u201d Heidi said dreamily.</p><p>Beth slipped her arm through Heidi\u2019s. \u201cI\u2019m so grateful you\u2019re here.\u201d</p><p>They stood in the background because Beth was feeling shy and a bit shaky, which could\u2019ve been low blood sugar, Heidi told her. In any event, her plan was to wait for him and then casually walk up and introduce herself.</p><p>\u201cThere he is!\u201d Heidi said, pointing toward a cluster of people near the gazebo.</p><p>\u201cWhere? Where? I don\u2019t see him.\u201d And then she did.</p><p>\u201cBeth, oh my goodness, look at him! He\u2019s gorgeous.\u201d</p><p>Beth froze and her heart sank to her knees. Her stomach pitched wildly. \u201cHe\u2019s that, all right,\u201d she whispered numbly.</p><p>\u201cHow did you get so lucky?\u201d Heidi was too excited to notice Beth\u2019s complete lack of enthusiasm.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Beth said, her voice low and emotionless.</p><p>Heidi turned to stare at her. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter with you? Peter looks like he stepped off the pages of a romance novel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe does, doesn\u2019t he?\u201d Beth murmured. Then she covered her face with both hands and turned away. Whipping the red hat off her head, she quickly unwrapped the telltale scarf from around her neck, as well.</p><p>\u201cBeth, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d Heidi asked.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Beth repeated. \u201cYou want me to tell you what\u2019s wrong? That Peter is an imposter!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow can he be an imposter when you\u2019ve never met him before?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis name isn\u2019t Peter,\u201d she choked out. \u201cIt\u2019s John Nicodemus and he\u2019s my ex-husband.\u201d</p><p>That news seemed to shock her friend. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get out of here before he sees me,\u201d Beth urged. Heidi couldn\u2019t possibly have known what John looked like, because she and Heidi hadn\u2019t met until five years ago\u2014and she certainly didn\u2019t keep wedding photos at her desk or in her condo.</p><p>Together they hurried around the corner and Beth flattened herself against the side of a building. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat are you going to do?\u201d Heidi asked curiously.</p><p>Beth needed to think. At first she\u2019d been numb with shock, but now she was angry. \u201cHe planned this. He knew all along.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeth, that\u2019s not fair. How could he have?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe never exchanged last names. And he changed his first name, didn\u2019t he? He tricked me.\u201d</p> <p>Heidi shook her head. \u201cDidn\u2019t you tell me you shortened your name to Beth after your divorce?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did,\u201d she admitted. \u201cI wanted to make a fresh start, so I decided that from then on, I\u2019d just use Beth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps John did the same thing,\u201d Heidi suggested.</p><p>Beth wasn\u2019t willing to concede the point. \u201cHis middle name is Peter,\u201d she said grudgingly. \u201cIt never occured to me...\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe is gorgeous, though.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHis good looks are the only thing he has going for him,\u201d Beth mumbled.</p><p>\u201cThat isn\u2019t what you told me earlier.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Heidi wasn\u2019t usually this argumentative. Clearly, she was taking Peter/John\u2019s side, and that infuriated Beth.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you remember what you said last week?\u201d Heidi asked. \u201cYou told me Peter is everything your first husband wasn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI said that?\u201d What an idiot she\u2019d been. What an imbecile. She\u2019d allowed John to make a fool of her. He knew who she was. He had to have known. How could he not? But maybe...just maybe, he didn\u2019t. Could they have found each other online? No one would believe something this random could actually happen. It was more than bizarre. It was completely and totally implausible...wasn\u2019t it?</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t leave him standing there waiting for you like that,\u201d Heidi insisted. \u201cThat would be cruel.\u201d</p> <p>Beth didn\u2019t respond, still trying to figure out how this had happened. It dawned on her that he couldn\u2019t have known, since he\u2019d been the one to suggest she meet him outside the gazebo. If he\u2019d known, he would never have given her the opportunity to see him first and then walk away. Unlikely though it seemed, she had to conclude that he was as much in the dark as she was.</p><p>\u201cDid you hear me?\u201d Heidi demanded. \u201cYou have to call him on his cell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you have to,\u201d Beth said frantically.</p><p>\u201cI beg your pardon?\u201d Heidi looked confused.</p><p>\u201cUse my phone.\u201d She thrust it at her friend.</p><p>\u201cWhy me? Beth, you\u2019re the one who should talk to him, not me.\u201d She refused to accept the phone.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t...He\u2019ll recognize my voice.\u201d He would, too. It might\u2019ve been almost ten years since the divorce, but that wouldn\u2019t matter. John would know her voice the same way she would his.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t want him to find out it\u2019s you?\u201d Heidi asked, sounding even more confused.</p> <p>\u201cNo. Not yet. I need to think.\u201d This awkward situation had to be handled delicately or John might assume she\u2019d tricked him\u2014which was what she\u2019d suspected about him.</p><p>\u201cHere\u2014I\u2019ll do it,\u201d Heidi said and snatched the phone away from her. \u201cWhat should I tell him?\u201d</p><p>Beth hadn\u2019t thought that far ahead. \u201cI\u2014I\u2019m not sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShould I say something came up at the last minute and you had to leave?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut if he asks what it is...\u201d Beth was growing desperate.</p><p>\u201cHe won\u2019t,\u201d Heidi said. \u201cAnyway, something did come up, so it isn\u2019t like you\u2019re lying.\u201d</p><p>Beth shrugged helplessly.</p><p>\u201cGive me his cell phone number.\u201d Heidi held out her hand.</p><p>Digging through her purse, Beth nearly dumped the entire contents in the snow.</p><p>\u201cRelax,\u201d Heidi said in an annoyingly calm voice. \u201cRe-e-lax.\u201d</p><p>Beth scowled at her, and as soon as she found the crumpled slip of paper with his phone number, she slapped it in Heidi\u2019s hand.</p><p>Heidi punched out the number, holding the phone close to Beth\u2019s ear.</p><p>Peter/John answered on the first ring. \u201cHello.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs this Peter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeth? Where are you?\u201d</p><p>Heidi glanced at Beth, who gestured for her to continue speaking. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry, Peter, but I can\u2019t make it. Something, uh, came up\u2014at the last minute and I can\u2019t keep our appointment. I\u2019m so disappointed.\u201d This last part was said with feeling.</p><p>\u201cI am, too,\u201d Peter responded. \u201cI didn\u2019t know what to think when you didn\u2019t show up at four.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to meet you. I really would\u2014just not now. Can we arrange another time?\u201d</p><p>Beth glared at her friend. She made a frenzied cutting motion with one hand but Heidi ignored her, turning her back on Beth.</p><p>Beth hurried around in order to face her. Once more, she made exaggerated cutting motions, using both hands to emphasize the point.</p><p>\u201cNext Friday, after Christmas, would be perfect,\u201d Heidi went on to say. \u201cSince I was the one who let you down, please come to my place. Yes, yes, I\u2019m sure.\u201d</p><p>Beth\u2019s mouth fell open. Her friend had really crossed the line with that one. Before she could stop her, Heidi rattled off Beth\u2019s address.</p><p>A moment later, Heidi clicked the cell phone shut and returned it to Beth.</p><p>\u201cHave you gone insane?\u201d Beth cried. \u201cYou gave him my address!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, yes, that\u2019s what you wanted me to do, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo...yes. Oh, I don\u2019t know.\u201d Beth\u2019s ears felt frozen and she covered them with her hands. She didn\u2019t dare put on her hat until they were far from the gazebo.</p><p>\u201cThat gives you six days to prepare him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re worried about John?\u201d Some friend Heidi had turned out to be!</p><p>\u201cNot John,\u201d Heidi explained patiently. \u201cI\u2019m concerned about Peter, the man you fell in love with over the last six months.\u201d</p><p>Then it hit Beth, something she\u2019d completely forgotten. \u201cHe\u2019s married.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean, he\u2019s married?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA friend told me she\u2019d heard John remarried and if that\u2019s the case, he\u2019s either divorced a second time or cheating on his wife.\u201d A sick feeling attacked her stomach.</p><p>\u201cMy guess is that your friend was talking about some other John.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt can\u2019t be...\u201d Or could it? Beth no longer knew. All she did know was that she had six days to sort this out before she confronted Peter/John with the truth.</p><p>Fourteen</p><p>Early Saturday morning, Carter tiptoed down to the laundry room as quietly as he could. After working late at the pizza place he managed, his father hadn\u2019t come home until way past Carter\u2019s bedtime. Carter had lain awake, worrying that his father would somehow discover Rusty in the house. If he did, he just might take the dog away in the middle of the night.</p><p>When Carter heard the garage door close, he\u2019d prayed really hard that Rusty wouldn\u2019t bark at the strange noise. The dog seemed to have a sixth sense about things like that, because he stayed quiet all night.</p><p>Carter could hear his parents talking, and even though he\u2019d had his ear against the door, he couldn\u2019t make out their words. All he knew was that after about ten minutes they went to bed. Then and only then was Carter able to sleep.</p><p>In the morning, he sneaked down the hallway and freed Rusty from the laundry room. Rusty wanted outside, and Carter let him into the backyard to do his business. As soon as he\u2019d finished, Rusty hurried back onto the porch, where Carter waited for him.</p><p>\u201cAre you hungry, boy?\u201d Carter asked softly. No one else in the house was awake. He bent down and stroked the rich auburn fur of his new best friend. Then he led Rusty back into the laundry room and filled his water dish. He gave him a bowl of Wheaties with milk because they didn\u2019t have any dog food.</p><p>Rusty seemed to like the cereal and when he\u2019d licked the bowl clean, Carter returned to his bedroom. The dog walked politely beside him. Without being asked, Carter made his bed, dressed and brushed his teeth, too. All the while, Rusty lay on his bedroom rug, his eyes never leaving Carter.</p><p>When he heard his parents stir, Carter was ready. He knew it would take a lot of fast talking to convince his father to let him keep Rusty. His one hope was that once he heard Rusty had followed him home, he\u2019d understand that this was a special dog. This was the dog God had sent Carter.</p><p>Through his partially open door, he could hear his father step into the kitchen and immediately start making coffee. Rusty dashed out of the bedroom before Carter could stop him. He raced after the dog but it was too late. Rusty skidded into the kitchen, his long tail wagging excitedly.</p><p>His father caught sight of Rusty and bent down to pet him. \u201cWhere did you come from, boy?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cHi, Dad,\u201d Carter said tentatively.</p><p>\u201cDo you have a friend spending the night?\u201d David asked, glancing at his son.</p><p>Carter swallowed hard. \u201cRusty\u2019s my friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRusty?\u201d his father repeated.</p><p>\u201cI named him after the dog you had when you were a kid. You told me about him, remember?\u201d</p><p>Slowly his father nodded. \u201cWhere did you get the dog, Carter?\u201d</p><p>Carter\u2019s mother came into the kitchen just then, tying the sash on her housecoat. She looked uneasily from Carter to his father. \u201cI meant to tell you about Rusty last night, David,\u201d she said, pouring them each a cup of coffee.</p><p>\u201cI suppose it slipped your mind,\u201d David commented, frowning.</p><p>\u201cNo. I decided you were too tired and didn\u2019t need to deal with another problem. We couldn\u2019t do anything until morning anyway.\u201d</p><p>His father turned to Carter. \u201cWhere did you get the dog?\u201d he asked a second time.</p><p>\u201cHe was in the schoolyard, but Dad, this is a special dog. Really special. Out of all the kids there, Rusty came to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you feed him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was starving, Dad! And his coat was all muddy and...he needs a family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou gave him something to eat, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Carter bit his lip. \u201cI fed him a Twinkie and then Bailey let me have her peanut-butter-and-jelly sandwich.\u201d Because he wanted his father to know his sister hadn\u2019t willingly donated her sandwich, he explained. \u201cI traded my Saturday TV privileges, though, so Bailey would give me her sandwich.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCarter,\u201d his father said gently. \u201cRusty came to you because he thought you\u2019d feed him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot at first,\u201d Carter insisted. \u201cHe didn\u2019t know about the Twinkie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe could probably smell it in your pocket. Dogs have a keen sense of smell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs for him following you home?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, he...Rusty\u2019s not just any dog. He\u2019s smart and he listens and he understands, too.\u201d</p><p>His father crouched down so they were eye to eye. \u201cDid you encourage him to follow you?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cHe followed the bus! I told you, Dad\u2014he\u2019s smart.\u201d</p><p>Reaching out, his father rested a hand on Carter\u2019s shoulder. \u201cRusty could see that you liked him.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s more than that!\u201d Carter cried. \u201cI prayed really hard and God sent me Rusty. He was so muddy I...I didn\u2019t even know his fur was red until I gave him a bath.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn our tub?\u201d his father asked.</p><p>Carter nodded reluctantly.</p><p>His father stood and cast him a disapproving look.</p> <p>\u201cDid he make a mess?\u201d The question was directed at Carter\u2019s mother.</p><p>\u201cI cleaned it up,\u201d Carter inserted. \u201cTell him, Mom, tell Dad that I washed out the bathtub and everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe did,\u201d she confirmed, handing his father a mug of fresh coffee.</p><p>David accepted it, closing his eyes as he took his first sip. \u201cI\u2019m glad you cleaned up after the dog.\u201d</p><p>Relieved, Carter offered his father a hopeful smile. \u201cIt was like God was telling me this dog was for me because he had red fur.\u201d</p> <p>A pained look appeared on his father\u2019s face. \u201cDid you stop to think that Rusty might belong to another little boy?\u201d</p><p>The thought had never entered Carter\u2019s mind. \u201cRusty might have another family?\u201d</p><p>His father set the mug aside and put his hand on Carter\u2019s shoulder once again. \u201cThere could be a little boy out there who\u2019s lost his dog.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot Rusty,\u201d Carter said with certainty.</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t be sure of anything when it comes to a stray.\u201d</p><p>Carter shook his head. \u201cRusty needs a family,\u201d he stated boldly. \u201cOur family. He adopted us.\u201d</p> <p>The same sad look came over his father. \u201cI wish we could keep him. He seems like a nice dog.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a wonderful dog, and he\u2019s housebroken and he doesn\u2019t eat much. He can have my food.\u201d</p><p>David drew one hand across his face. \u201cIf it was just a matter of food, we could deal with that, but it isn\u2019t. I already explained this to you, Carter. There are the vet\u2019s fees for one thing. Since Rusty\u2019s been on the streets for a while, he should be checked out by a veterinarian.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll pay for it with my allowance,\u201d Carter said. \u201cI have thirty dollars and seventy-six cents.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDavid,\u201d his mother murmured in a soft, pleading voice.</p><p>\u201cThat wouldn\u2019t begin to cover the cost of a checkup and shots. And what if he needs some kind of treatment? Then there\u2019s the license and heaven knows what else. We can\u2019t keep him, Carter. I don\u2019t want to sound heartless but we\u2019d be doing Rusty a disservice, too.\u201d</p><p>Carter didn\u2019t want to cry but his eyes filled with tears before he could hold them back.</p><p>His mother wrapped her arms around him and held him close. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry, honey,\u201d she whispered.</p> <p>\u201cWhere will you take him?\u201d Carter sobbed, looking up at his father.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll have to go to the animal shelter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Daddy, please!\u201d Bailey came into the kitchen, dragging her stuffed Winnie the Pooh bear on the linoleum. She was still in her pajamas and her hair was all frizzy because she\u2019d gone to bed with it wet.</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t Rusty stay until Christmas?\u201d Carter begged.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019ll just make it harder to give him up,\u201d his father said. \u201cBesides, we don\u2019t know if he\u2019s picked up any parasites, and the sooner he\u2019s checked out, the better.\u201d</p><p>Rusty lay down on the small rug in front of the kitchen sink and rested his head on his paws. Bailey sat on the floor next to him.</p><p>\u201cGet up, Bailey. He probably has fleas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, he doesn\u2019t, Dad,\u201d Carter said. \u201cI washed him real good. Ask Mom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll take him down to the shelter this afternoon,\u201d his father said, not waiting to see if Bailey obeyed him. He walked out of the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cMom?\u201d Carter could feel the tears running down his face.</p><p>\u201cYou heard your father.\u201d She looked like she wanted to cry, too.</p><p>\u201cBut...\u201d</p><p>\u201cRemember what Dad said about some other little boy losing Rusty? Can you imagine how happy he\u2019ll be to find him?\u201d</p><p>Carter tried to imagine what it would be like to lose his dog and how awful he\u2019d feel. Sniffling, he wiped his cheeks with one sleeve.</p><p>\u201cIf we take Rusty to the animal shelter, that little boy will get him back,\u201d his mother went on in a reassuring voice.</p><p>Being brave was hard, but Carter did his best. His lower lip quivered and he sat down on the floor and buried his face in the dog\u2019s fur. Bailey sat on Rusty\u2019s other side, clutching her bear and murmuring sweetly. As if seeking a way to comfort him, Rusty licked Carter\u2019s hand.</p><p>\u201cYou might have another family that loves you even more than I do.\u201d Carter\u2019s voice broke as he spoke to the dog.</p><p>\u201cCarter,\u201d his mother said softly. \u201cAs soon as we can afford it, you\u2019ll have your dog. I talked to Mrs. Smith at the school, and she said there\u2019ll be an opening at the cafeteria in February. I\u2019m going to apply for it and if I get the job, then you can have a dog.\u201d</p><p>Hope flared and then just as quickly died. \u201cBut it won\u2019t be Rusty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d his mother agreed, \u201cit won\u2019t be Rusty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want any dog except Rusty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Carter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mean it, Mom. Rusty\u2019s the only dog I want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI should never have let you bring him in the house,\u201d his mother said, and she sounded angry with herself. \u201cIt just makes this more difficult. I\u2019m so sorry, honey, but your dad\u2019s right. We can\u2019t give Rusty the kind of home he needs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRusty is Carter\u2019s dog,\u201d Bailey wailed. She held her Pooh bear tight against her chest, as if she was afraid their father would take her stuffed friend to the animal shelter, too.</p><p>\u201cCan I call Grandma?\u201d Carter asked. His grandparents were his last hope. If he explained everything to them, maybe they\u2019d be willing to pay for the checkup, the dog license and whatever else Rusty needed.</p><p>\u201cYour grandparents are gone this weekend,\u201d his mother said.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t call them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Carter, they\u2019re visiting friends in Seattle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>Carter knew he didn\u2019t have any choice. He had to give up his dog. He spent all morning with Rusty, talking to him. Bailey used her own hairbrush to comb the dog\u2019s fur until it was shiny and bright. Rusty stood still and even seemed to enjoy Bailey\u2019s ministrations.</p><p>Midafternoon, his father came into Carter and Bailey\u2019s bedroom. \u201cYou ready, son?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Carter wouldn\u2019t ever be ready. He hugged Rusty around the neck, face buried in his fur, and nodded.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to come with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to,\u201d Carter said stubbornly.</p><p>His father sighed. \u201cOkay, then. Let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>Rusty seemed to think they were going to a fun place, because the instant David opened the car door, he leaped inside and lay down in the backseat next to Carter.</p><p>His father didn\u2019t say a single word on the ride to the shelter in Wenatchee.</p><p>Neither did Carter. He stroked Rusty\u2019s head and struggled not to cry.</p><p>The county animal shelter was busy. Lots of people had come by to choose dogs and cats during the Christmas holidays. Some other family would be getting Rusty. Some other little boy would get Carter\u2019s special dog.</p><p>\u201cYou can stay in the car if you want,\u201d his father told him.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Carter was determined to be with his dog as long as he possibly could.</p><p>His father went inside the shelter and came back with a woman who was carrying a collar and leash. Carter listened as his father spoke to the lady.</p><p>\u201cMy son found Rusty in the schoolyard, and the dog followed him home. According to my wife, the poor thing was caked in mud. He seems to be a gentle dog, and he\u2019s obviously had some training, so I assume he\u2019s lost.\u201d</p><p>His father opened the passenger door and Rusty raised his head expectantly.</p><p>The woman reached into the car and stroked Rusty\u2019s head. \u201cOh, what an attractive dog he is. Probably part Irish setter\u2014they\u2019re a nice breed. We could\u2019ve adopted him out a dozen times over earlier in the day.\u201d</p><p>This wasn\u2019t news Carter wanted to hear. \u201cWhat about his other family? My dad said there might be other people who owned Rusty.\u201d That was his one comfort\u2014that bringing Rusty to the shelter might help the dog locate his original owner.</p><p>The lady from the shelter sighed. \u201cHis other family didn\u2019t take very good care of him, though, did they?\u201d she said. \u201cRusty didn\u2019t have any identification on him, did he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Carter admitted.</p><p>She examined the insides of Rusty\u2019s ears. \u201cNo tattoos, either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow will you figure out who owns him, then?\u201d Carter asked.</p><p>\u201cWe can check for a microchip, but I doubt we\u2019ll find one. Without that, there\u2019s no way of knowing where his family is,\u201d she explained. \u201cStill, this is the best time of year to guarantee him a good home. I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll be adopted quickly. That\u2019s what you want for him, isn\u2019t it?\u201d She looked directly at Carter.</p><p>Hard though it was to agree, Carter nodded. With his heart breaking, he threw his arms around Rusty for one last hug.</p><p>Fifteen</p><p>All day Rosalie had been fluttering about the house, getting ready for their daughters\u2019 arrival. Harry was exhausted by all the activity around him. She\u2019d changed the sheets on the beds and while he wanted to help her with the guest room, he couldn\u2019t. Without his saying a word, his wife seemed to realize how much he hated his physical limitations. Twice she made a special trip into the family room, where Harry sat watching television, to give him a kiss on the forehead.</p><p>\u201cDonna will get here tomorrow afternoon,\u201d Rosalie announced for about the tenth time that morning. \u201cDonna and Richard are coming first, and Lorraine and Kenny will drive over on Christmas Eve. The grandkids are coming then, too. Did I tell you that already?\u201d</p><p>He nodded. Her memory wasn\u2019t the problem in this instance; Rosalie was just plain excited. Chattering incessantly was something Rosalie did when she was happy. And although Harry wasn\u2019t constantly talking about his daughters\u2019 visit, he felt the same joy. It\u2019d been a lot of years since their two girls had spent Christmas with them. The whole family would be together. According to Dr. Snellgrove, this would be his last Christmas on Earth, and for Rosalie\u2019s sake, he wanted it to be a good one; having their daughters with them would ensure that.</p><p>\u201cThe girls don\u2019t want you to worry about cooking,\u201d Harry reminded his wife. There\u2019d been two or three conversations that very day between his daughters and Rosalie. Lorraine had insisted on ordering a special ham for their Christmas dinner and would be bringing it with her. Donna had a scalloped potato recipe she planned to make. As for the other side dishes, apparently their daughters were taking care of those, as well. And Rosalie was baking the family\u2019s favorite pie for Christmas Day dessert.</p><p>Although the menu had long been determined, his wife spent hours poring over cookbooks. Harry didn\u2019t know why. But seeing her this involved raised his own spirits. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She hadn\u2019t mentioned the appearance of the angel. Not since he\u2019d told her about it. Afterward, Harry had done quite a bit of thinking. That angel had been real. As real as Rosalie. Most important, she\u2019d been there, at his side. Harry would never have made it back to bed without her.</p><p>That led him to remember again what the young doctor had told him. Anytime, Dr. Snellgrove had said. Death was getting close. Harry could feel it. Every day he seemed to grow weaker. Every day it became more difficult to accomplish even the simplest and most mundane tasks, such as dressing and shaving. When he\u2019d finished brushing his teeth, he was nearly too weak to stand.</p><p>\u201cI thought I\u2019d bake cinnamon rolls for breakfast Christmas morning,\u201d Rosalie was saying as she stalked through the family room, a feather duster in one hand. She swiped the thing every which way, swirling up dust left and right.</p><p>\u201cRosalie,\u201d Harry protested.</p> <p>\u201cSorry, sweetheart, but I want the house to look its best for the girls.\u201d</p><p>In a blur, his wife dashed past him and into the next room. Where she found the energy, Harry couldn\u2019t even imagine. Next he caught sight of her fluffing up the sofa pillow, squeezing it hard, then pounding it into place. Harry couldn\u2019t help smiling.</p><p>\u201cRosalie,\u201d he called out. \u201cSit down a minute, would you? I\u2019m getting tired just watching you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have time to sit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need to talk to you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAll right, all right.\u201d The way she breezed into the room reminded him of Loretta Young\u2019s entrance on her television show in the fifties. He\u2019d seen that moment hundreds of times, and it lingered in his mind to this day. Rosalie had been every bit as beautiful as Loretta Young back then. Still was, in his opinion.</p><p>\u201cSit.\u201d Harry pointed to her chair, which stood next to his own. They shared an end table and a lamp.</p><p>\u201cYes, sweetheart?\u201d She sat on the very edge of her seat, signaling her impatience to get on with her work.</p><p>\u201cI was thinking we should talk about Liberty Orchard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHarry Alderwood, I told you\u2014I don\u2019t have time to talk about this now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease?\u201d he asked quietly. It had been weighing on him all day.</p> <p>Rosalie released a gusty sigh that the neighbors could probably have heard if they\u2019d been listening. \u201cMust we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt would put my mind at rest,\u201d he told her.</p><p>She sighed again, accepting that he wasn\u2019t going to let this drop. \u201cFine. If you feel it\u2019s that important, then let\u2019s talk.\u201d</p><p>Harry was grateful. If possible, he\u2019d like Rosalie\u2019s future settled before the girls arrived. He knew it was necessary to set things in motion, which meant they had to secure the unit. Harry felt an urgency that his recent heavenly visitation had only heightened. He might have mere days to live. Mere days to arrange all of this.</p><p>\u201cYou said you didn\u2019t want to think about moving until after the holidays,\u201d he began, \u201cbut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t,\u201d Rosalie broke in. \u201cI\u2019ve got enough to do with the girls and their husbands coming here for Christmas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI agree.\u201d</p><p>She seemed surprised by that.</p> <p>\u201cBut,\u201d he added before she could crow at her apparent victory, \u201cI\u2019d be more comfortable if we told the administrator we\u2019ve decided to take the unit.\u201d</p><p>Rosalie hesitated. \u201cDo you really think a few more days will make that much difference?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Harry said firmly. \u201cIt\u2019d give me peace of mind.\u201d</p><p>Rosalie folded her hands in her lap. \u201cI don\u2019t know, Harry...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s to know?\u201d Dear heaven, Rosalie couldn\u2019t have changed her mind already, could she?</p><p>\u201cHarry, we\u2019ve been in this house for so many years. To give it up like this...I don\u2019t think I\u2019m ready.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said\u2014\u201d</p><p>She held up her hand. \u201cI know what I said. Yes, we had a good time at Liberty Orchard. Lucy\u2019s always been a persuasive person. And at first I was excited to see my friends again, but now...\u201d She let the words fade and refused to meet his eyes.</p><p>\u201cBut now?\u201d Harry prodded.</p><p>\u201cNow I\u2019m not sure we should be in such a rush. Let\u2019s talk to the girls about it some more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ll agree with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI agree with you, too, Harry. But why do we have to do it right this minute? It\u2019s going to be hard on me to leave this house, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. For me, too.\u201d It would be even harder for him to leave Rosalie and his family.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to call the administrator,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cHarry!\u201d Rosalie gasped.</p><p>\u201cIf we change our minds, we\u2019ll only be out a few hundred dollars.\u201d Despite what Rosalie thought, Harry was convinced Mrs. Goldsmith hadn\u2019t been lying. He believed someone else was interested in that unit. So he wanted to make the deposit immediately.</p><p>\u201cA few hundred dollars?\u201d Rosalie repeated in a stunned voice. \u201cSince when have we ever had money to burn, Harry Alderwood?\u201d</p><p>As children of the Depression, Harry and Rosalie had lived frugally. They\u2019d budgeted their entire lives and saved ten percent of every dollar earned. Neither one wasted anything. Rosalie even kept those plastic bags from the grocery store. Young people these days didn\u2019t know the value of a dollar. And credit cards! He\u2019d seen more people get into financial trouble because of those cards.</p><p>\u201cThis will be money well invested,\u201d Harry assured his wife.</p><p>Rosalie continued to look uncertain. \u201cIf you\u2019re positive this is what you want\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is,\u201d Harry said, cutting her off. \u201cYou know, Rosalie, that angel was real.\u201d</p><p>She frowned.</p><p>\u201cI needed help. I collapsed and I couldn\u2019t get up. I wouldn\u2019t have managed without her.\u201d</p><p>Her frown deepened. \u201cYou\u2019re on a lot of medication.\u201d</p><p>He realized this was the rationale Donna must have offered her mother when he\u2019d heard the two of them discussing the incident. In fact, that conversation was what had prompted his youngest daughter to visit a day early. \u201cAll I know is that I was in trouble and I didn\u2019t have my walker and then...I was back in bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you call me? If you needed help, I would\u2019ve come right away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would have if I\u2019d had the strength.\u201d As he recalled, Harry had made an effort to rouse his wife, to no avail. Not that she could\u2019ve helped him up or supported him on the walk into the bedroom.</p><p>Rosalie got to her feet. \u201cI can see you\u2019re determined, so go ahead and make that phone call,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019ll both adjust. You\u2019re right, Harry. If it was up to me, I\u2019d put off the move indefinitely. We need to start making plans.\u201d</p><p>Relief washed over him. As soon as his wife went back to her fussing and cleaning, Harry removed his wallet from his hip pocket\u2014a procedure that left him short of breath\u2014and took out the business card the administrator had given him.</p><p>Elizabeth Goldsmith.</p><p>He reached for the portable phone. They had three phones in the house, thanks to Lorraine. One in the bedroom, another in the kitchen and the third next to his recliner on the small end table.</p><p>Although it was a Saturday, the administrator had promised him she\u2019d be available.</p><p>A woman with a pleasant voice answered the phone. \u201cLiberty Orchard,\u201d she said brightly. \u201cHow might I direct your call?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to speak with Elizabeth Goldsmith.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne moment, please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d Harry closed his eyes, afraid that if Rosalie looked his way, she might try to talk him into waiting, despite the fact that he\u2019d made the best decision. The only decision.</p><p>\u201cElizabeth Goldsmith,\u201d he heard half a minute later.</p><p>\u201cHarry Alderwood,\u201d he returned. He didn\u2019t understand why people felt they had to announce their names when they answered the phone. He knew whom he\u2019d called and presumably Elizabeth knew who she was. He\u2019d noticed that it had become a common business practice in the last few years.</p><p>\u201cAh, yes, we spoke recently, didn\u2019t we?\u201d Elizabeth said.</p><p>\u201cMy wife, Rosalie, and I were by to see the facility a few days ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, yes. You\u2019re friends of Lucy Menard\u2019s, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Harry got right to the point. \u201cWhen we spoke, you confirmed that you had one unit open.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Elizabeth paused. \u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>He continued to speak, eager to get this done. \u201cWe discussed my giving you a check to secure that unit,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cYes, I do recall that I urged you to make the deposit right away.\u201d</p><p>He was well aware of that and had thought of little else since their meeting.</p><p>\u201cI mentioned that there was only one unit open, didn\u2019t I?\u201d she went on.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Harry was beginning to worry just a bit.</p><p>\u201cAnd I did mention that someone else had shown an interest?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m afraid, Mr. Alderwood, that the first party came back the following day with a check.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean...the unit\u2019s already been taken?\u201d He could hear the stunned disbelief in his own voice.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid so. And unfortunately there was only the one.\u201d</p><p>He wished she\u2019d quit reminding him of that.</p><p>\u201cHow soon will you have another unit available?\u201d Harry asked, still in shock.</p><p>Elizabeth considered her answer. \u201cThat\u2019s difficult to say. It could be three months but it might be as long as six.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Mr. Alderwood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo...no, I\u2019m the one who\u2019s sorry. You suggested we decide quickly and I thought we had.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf there\u2019s anything else I can do for you, please let me know. Oh, and in the meantime, Merry Christmas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you. Merry Christmas to you.\u201d He put back the phone and released a deep sigh of regret, knowing he should have taken action that very day.</p><p>Now it was too late.</p><p>Too late for him.</p><p>In three months\u2019 time he wouldn\u2019t be here. In three months\u2019 time Rosalie would be a widow.</p><p>Sixteen</p><p>Beth slept fitfully all night. She couldn\u2019t escape the thoughts tumbling crazily through her mind, but every once in a while exhaustion overtook her, and she\u2019d slip into a light sleep. Then she\u2019d dream\u2014dreams filled with John. And the shock of what she\u2019d discovered would jerk her awake. Before long, the whole process would start all over again.</p><p>In the morning, she was blurry-eyed and her temples were throbbing with the beginnings of a headache. Despite how she felt, she had no choice but to attend Mass. James and Bella, her nephew and niece, were participating in a special Christmas program. Not to show up would disappoint them. Besides, her entire family would be there; it was easier to make the effort and go now than to offer excuses later.</p><p>Before she left, Beth swallowed two aspirin with a glass of orange juice. Her mother had planned a large brunch afterward. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>By the time Beth arrived at the church, the parking lot was almost full. She hoped her mother had saved her a place.</p><p>Joyce was lying in wait just inside the church vestibule, which meant she had something on her mind\u2014and Beth could easily guess what it was.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re late and it\u2019s time for Mass,\u201d her mother said, slipping her arm around Beth, as if she was afraid her daughter might make a run for it at the last minute. \u201cYour father saved us two places, but I don\u2019t think he\u2019ll be able to hold on to them much longer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry, Mom, I got a slow start.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI want to hear every detail about Leavenworth.\u201d Joyce narrowed her eyes. \u201cEvery detail,\u201d she repeated ominously.</p><p>\u201cYes, well...I\u2019ll explain later.\u201d She wouldn\u2019t tell her family everything, though. She felt overwhelmed by the events of the day before. Heidi\u2019s arrangement with Peter\u2014John\u2014on her behalf was a further complication, one she didn\u2019t need. But the immediate problem was how much to say to her parents.</p><p>As soon as Mass began, Beth\u2019s problems seemed to lift from her shoulders. The beauty of the church, with its decorations of poinsettia and evergreen boughs, the joyful music and the sermon\u2019s message\u2014about forgiving yourself and not allowing past mistakes to hold you back\u2014seemed to be just for her. The Christmas pageant was delightful and when she joined in the carol-singing, her heart felt free.</p><p>That morning, her entire life had felt like a disaster. By the end of Mass, Beth had begun to feel a new sense of hope. Maybe this bizarre coincidence involving John was meant to be. Maybe...maybe they\u2019d have a second chance, despite all the bitterness and grief.</p><p>The family brunch at her parents\u2019 home was her only remaining hurdle today. Everyone wanted to know about Peter.</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t keep us in suspense,\u201d her mother said as she passed the platter of scrambled eggs to Beth.</p><p>\u201cMom, please.\u201d Foolishly she\u2019d hoped to avoid lengthy explanations and at first she\u2019d thought that might actually happen, since everyone\u2019s attention was focused on her niece and nephew, who\u2019d played minor roles in today\u2019s program. But she should\u2019ve known it wouldn\u2019t be that easy. At Joyce\u2019s comment, everyone stopped eating and stared at Beth.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re just curious,\u201d her sister added. \u201cIf you tell us to mind our own business, we will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAngela,\u201d their mother said. \u201cDon\u2019t even suggest Marybeth keep this to herself!\u201d</p><p>Groaning, Beth could see that it was useless to resist. Her mother felt entitled to an answer\u2014and it had better be the right answer, too. Joyce had lit a candle, after all.</p><p>\u201cYesterday I\u2014\u201d Beth thought about telling the truth. The direct approach had its benefits. But the thought of explaining that Peter wasn\u2019t Peter but John Nicodemus, her ex-husband, was more than she could handle. As her mental debate continued, Beth hesitated, leaving her sentence unfinished.</p> <p>\u201cMarybeth, please,\u201d her mother implored.</p><p>\u201cWe didn\u2019t meet,\u201d she blurted out.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t meet?\u201d The question echoed around the table.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t tell me you chickened out,\u201d her mother cried. The horrified look was back, as if Beth had, once again, been a disappointment to the family.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t tell them the real reason she hadn\u2019t met Peter, so she just sat and gazed blankly at the wall.</p><p>After a moment, her parents\u2019 eyes met. Her father cleared his throat. \u201cActually, your mother and I suspected this might happen. We feel it\u2019s time, Beth, for you to consider counseling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Beth couldn\u2019t believe what she was hearing.</p><p>\u201cYour father and I are willing to pay for it,\u201d her mother put in.</p> <p>There was no point in arguing. Beth could see they weren\u2019t going to budge from their decision. \u201cI don\u2019t object to counseling,\u201d she murmured. \u201cIn theory, that is. I just don\u2019t think I need it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou need it,\u201d her mother said grimly.</p><p>\u201cCan we talk about this after Christmas?\u201d Beth asked, wanting to delay any further discussion until she\u2019d had time to analyze her own reactions to the Peter/John confusion.</p><p>\u201cOf course we can,\u201d her sister assured her sympathetically.</p><p>So her sister was in on this, as well. That loving, compassionate look was a dead giveaway.</p><p>Beth left her parents\u2019 home shortly after the brunch dishes had been washed and put away. As she drove back to her own place, she deliberated on what to say to Peter. Despite the fact that he was really John, she\u2019d come to think of him as Peter\u2014a new man. A different man.</p><p>Once home, she shed her coat and purse and logged on to the Internet. The moment she did, Peter sent her an instant message.</p><p>I wondered when you\u2019d get here.</p><p>His comment indicated that he\u2019d been waiting for her to come online.</p><p>I\u2019m here now, she typed back. I want to talk to you about meeting later this week.</p><p>Are you having second thoughts?</p><p>She mulled over her answer. Yes. You see, I\u2019ve already made one disastrous mistake in my life when it comes to relationships and I\u2019m not eager to make another.</p><p>In other words, you\u2019re gun-shy.</p><p>Frankly, yes.</p><p>This might surprise you, Peter wrote back, but I am, too.</p><p>Really? Then because she couldn\u2019t resist, she asked, Was your marriage that horrible?</p><p>I guess not. We were both young and immature.</p><p>Beth couldn\u2019t leave it at that. This was a perfect opportunity to discover exactly what Peter thought of her. Do you have any regrets?</p><p>He didn\u2019t reply right away. Some.</p><p>Me, too, she told him. More than I realized.</p><p>Has your ex remarried? Peter typed.</p><p>This was a tricky question. I heard he did.</p><p>So you don\u2019t keep tabs on him?</p><p>No. What about your ex-wife?</p><p>I have no idea. We went our separate ways. I don\u2019t harbor any ill will toward her. I couldn\u2019t tell you if she\u2019s remarried or not.</p><p>Did you love her? For one long heartbeat, Beth\u2019s finger was poised above the key that would submit her question. Her mind raced; she was afraid this was one she shouldn\u2019t be asking. She sent it anyway.</p><p>His answer came in the form of another question. Did you love your ex?</p><p>Her reply was simple. Yes. I guess I still do in some ways. And you?</p><p>Yes. A short pause and then he added, Is that the real problem? Are you so in love with your ex that you aren\u2019t ready to fall in love a second time?</p><p>Peter deserved the truth\u2014but not yet. He admitted he\u2019d loved her once, maybe still did, but preferred not to discuss her.</p><p>What Peter couldn\u2019t know was that she had information he didn\u2019t....</p><p>Listen, let\u2019s put the matter of our former marriages to rest. His next words flashed across the screen. My wife and I behaved badly. We were both at fault and I\u2019ve accepted that our problems were complex. I\u2019ve moved on and apparently so has she. Although painful, the divorce was for the best.</p><p>The best? Beth read those words and her throat tightened.</p><p>I wish her well and I\u2019m sure you don\u2019t begrudge your ex-husband happiness. Am I right?</p><p>Yes, she typed back.</p><p>Good. Then let\u2019s drop the subject. Agreed?</p><p>Beth read his words, then pressed her fingers to her lips as she wondered how to respond. Agreed...only I\u2019m not sure the timing is right for the two of us.</p><p>In what way?</p><p>It\u2019s Christmas, and I have enough family pressures without worrying about what will happen once we meet.</p><p>I know what you mean.</p><p>Shall we put this off? she asked.</p><p>For how long?</p><p>Why don\u2019t we wait until after New Year\u2019s.</p><p>Okay.</p><p>His clipped reply implied that he was disappointed. Well, she was, too, but she couldn\u2019t spring the news on Peter like this, two days before the biggest holiday of the year.</p><p>You aren\u2019t going to duck out on me again, are you? Peter asked.</p><p>Beth appreciated his directness. No, she typed. I\u2019d just like a little more time.</p><p>Whatever you say. But I believe it\u2019s important for both of us to put the past behind us.</p><p>\u201cBehind us,\u201d Beth repeated aloud. Little did Peter know how impossible that would be.</p><p>\u201cAfter New Year\u2019s?\u201d Goodness gasped, leaning over Beth\u2019s shoulder to read her messages.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Mercy asked.</p><p>As far as Goodness was concerned, everything was wrong. Nothing was going the way she\u2019d planned. She\u2019d worked so hard, too, trying to bring these two lonely humans together.</p><p>\u201cThey have to meet before Christmas Eve,\u201d she muttered.</p><p>Mercy nodded. \u201cSo what are you going to do about it?\u201d</p><p>Goodness smiled; a plan was already taking shape in her mind. She didn\u2019t want to intervene in human events; strictly speaking, that was against the rules. However, Beth and Peter weren\u2019t giving her much of an alternative. Either she acted on their behalf or Gabriel would have to report that she\u2019d failed. No one would blame her for a small intervention, least of all Gabriel, but so far her track record had been exceptional\u2014if she did say so herself\u2014and she wanted to keep it that way.</p><p>Everyone in Heaven knew that humans were difficult subjects. At times they required a clear and unambiguous sign, or a bit of coaxing. Or both. And some people needed more help than others. In Goodness\u2019s opinion, Beth was one of those.</p><p>\u201cWell, you have to admit we all had a shock,\u201d Mercy said, reminding Goodness of the scene in Leavenworth the day before.</p><p>\u201cI agree.\u201d Goodness frowned as she contemplated her next move. Letting Peter and Beth stumble into each other on the street would be too convenient\u2014and too subtle. No, whatever Goodness arranged would have to be dramatic. Personally she\u2019d prefer a car crash, involving a massive explosion\u2014no deaths, of course. The possibility of a SWAT team thrilled her and if she could manage it, a helicopter rescue. That would make her day. Those boys in black always did get her adrenaline going.</p><p>\u201cGoodness,\u201d Mercy prodded gently. \u201cI recognize that look in your eyes and I don\u2019t like the way your wings are fluttering.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think it might be best if you left now,\u201d she said primly.</p><p>\u201cGoodness!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want you to get in trouble, too.\u201d</p><p>Mercy\u2019s wings lifted her off the ground. \u201cWhat are you going to do?\u201d</p><p>Goodness pressed her lips together and shook her head. \u201cIt\u2019s better for you not to know.\u201d</p><p>That was when Shirley arrived. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on here?\u201d she demanded.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got a few problems,\u201d Goodness said.</p><p>\u201cYou do?\u201d Shirley muttered. \u201cWell, you aren\u2019t the only one. My assignment\u2019s not working out the way it\u2019s supposed to.\u201d</p><p>Mercy frowned, and her gaze swung back to Goodness and then to Shirley again. \u201cDo either of you have the feeling we might\u2019ve been set up?\u201d</p><p>Goodness sent her a puzzled glance. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThink about it,\u201d Mercy said. \u201cShirley gets what would usually be a dream assignment. Just how hard can it be to give a boy a dog?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, actually, this prayer request is one of the most difficult ones I\u2019ve ever received.\u201d She sighed. \u201cNot only do we have the issue with Carter\u2019s father, there\u2019s this one dog that refuses to go away.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut under normal conditions, it wouldn\u2019t be difficult, would it?\u201d</p><p>Shirley lifted one shoulder in a halfhearted shrug. \u201cNot really. The thing that troubles me most is this dog. He doesn\u2019t seem...ordinary. And he simply won\u2019t leave. I think that problem\u2019s finally been solved, though. He\u2019s at the animal shelter and he\u2019ll probably be adopted soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d</p> <p>Shirley wore a sad frown. \u201cWell, there\u2019s nothing I can do right now, so I\u2019ve put the matter out of my mind. I\u2019m here to help you two.\u201d</p><p>Mercy looked crestfallen. \u201cMy assignment\u2019s also failing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t happen to need a SWAT team, do you?\u201d Goodness asked excitedly. It seemed a shame not to call out the big guns when they might be able to help her friends, too.</p><p>Mercy\u2019s expression was horrified. \u201cGoodness, what are you thinking?\u201d</p><p>She held up her hands. \u201cImagine this: helicopters descending, ropes dropping to the ground and men\u2014young, handsome men\u2014sliding down to the rooftops.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTo do what?\u201d Mercy cried. \u201cYou\u2019ll ruin everything. I\u2019ve got enough troubles with Harry and Rosalie as it is. I don\u2019t need that kind of help. Just the sound of those helicopters would send him into cardiac arrest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what can we do?\u201d Goodness asked. \u201cWe\u2019ve got three unfinished assignments on our hands.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt this point,\u201d Mercy suggested, \u201cmaybe we should let these situations play out and see what happens.\u201d</p><p>It seemed so little. But perhaps Mercy and Shirley were right. She\u2019d done her best to bring Peter and Beth together, and her efforts, such as they were, had resulted in shock and confusion. Perhaps she should step aside and see what these humans could figure out for themselves.</p><p>Still, she was disappointed.</p><p>Seventeen</p> <p>Carter had been weepy and sad ever since his father had driven him to the animal shelter where they\u2019d left Rusty. All night long, he\u2019d lain awake, thinking about his dog. He knew how bad his parents felt, so Carter tried not to show how miserable he was.</p><p>He realized his parents didn\u2019t have any extra money, and even the allowance he\u2019d saved up wasn\u2019t enough.</p><p>\u201cCarter,\u201d his mother called from the living room. \u201cCome and see what your father brought home.\u201d</p><p>Hoping against hope that it was Rusty, Carter ran into the room. It wasn\u2019t. Instead, his mother stood in front of an artificial Christmas tree. The tree they had was dinky. So small, in fact, that it sat on the coffee table. It was in a flower pot and it was decorated with tiny glass balls. This one was real. Well, not exactly real because he could tell that the branches weren\u2019t like those of a live tree and it didn\u2019t have that nice Christmas smell. But it was real in size. And it came complete with strings of lights.</p><p>\u201cA Christmas tree,\u201d his sister squealed with delight as she joined him in the living room. \u201cWhere did you get it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour father found it,\u201d his mother said. \u201cOn his way to work this morning, he caught a glimpse of something in an alley. He stopped, and there was the tree. Someone must\u2019ve gotten a new tree because this one was propped up against a Dumpster. So your father brought it home for us.\u201d</p><p>That explained why Carter had heard his father return to the house shortly after he\u2019d left for work.</p><p>Bailey clapped her hands. Even Carter smiled. It was an old Christmas tree, a little worn and raggedy, but a whole lot better than the miniature one they had now. That one was more like a plant than a tree.</p> <p>His first thought was that he wanted to show it to Rusty, except he couldn\u2019t because Rusty wasn\u2019t with him anymore. It hurt to remember his dog, but Carter couldn\u2019t think about anything else. He hoped Rusty would go to a good home and that someone in his new family would love him as much as Carter did.</p><p>\u201cDo the lights work?\u201d Bailey asked.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll have to see,\u201d his mother said. She got down on the floor, crawled behind the tree and plugged in the cord. The lights flickered for a moment and then went out.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s probably why it was in the garbage,\u201d Carter told his mother.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just a pretend tree,\u201d Bailey whined.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s pathetic-looking,\u201d Carter muttered. \u201cBut...it\u2019s okay.\u201d He tried to pretend he was happy about the Christmas tree, and he was, only...only it was old and the lights didn\u2019t work and no one else wanted it. That made him think of Rusty again. No one else had wanted him, either, but Carter did, in the worst way.</p><p>\u201cWe can make it look pretty,\u201d Bailey said, rebounding from her disappointment. \u201cI have some colored paper from school and I could make an angel for the top,\u201d she said excitedly.</p><p>\u201cWe could string popcorn and cranberries, too,\u201d their mother suggested.</p><p>Carter didn\u2019t say anything for a long time. \u201cI know how to cut out snowflakes,\u201d he finally told her.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Carter.\u201d As if recognizing how much effort it had taken him to offer, his mother hugged him tightly.</p><p>Carter tried to squirm out of her embrace. He was too big to have his mother hug him, but at the same time he kind of liked it. He didn\u2019t want his friends to know about it, though.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll have the tree decorated when your father gets home from work,\u201d his mother said.</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Carter was willing to do his share.</p><p>Soon the aroma of popping corn filled the house. Carter sat at the kitchen table and patiently pierced the kernels with one of his mother\u2019s big sewing needles. He strung twenty-five kernels, then added a cranberry. Bailey decided to string her own and followed his pattern.</p><p>\u201cMake it your own way,\u201d he snapped at his sister. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to do everything like me, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCarter,\u201d his mother said. \u201cShe just wants her string to match yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy can\u2019t she do her own design?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you\u2019re her big brother and she looks up to you.\u201d</p><p>Carter wanted to be angry, but he wasn\u2019t. His sister had helped him with Rusty and had loved the stray, too.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think Rusty\u2019s doing right now?\u201d he asked his mother. \u201cWill he remember me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course he will,\u201d his mother said. \u201cRusty will always remember the boy who brought him food and washed the mud off his fur.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd played catch with him.\u201d</p><p>Carter thought he might cry, but instead he smiled. Thinking about all the things he\u2019d done with Rusty seemed to ease the ache in his heart.</p><p>The phone rang and his mother answered it quickly. \u201cHi, honey.\u201d</p><p>That meant it was his father.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re decorating the tree,\u201d his mother continued.</p><p>His father must\u2019ve said something else because his mother went quiet.</p><p>Then she said, \u201cOf course. He\u2019s right here.\u201d Placing her hand over the mouthpiece, she turned to Carter. \u201cYour dad said he\u2019d like to talk to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Scooting off the chair, Carter took the phone. \u201cHi, Dad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s it going?\u201d</p><p>Carter shrugged. \u201cAll right, I guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think of the Christmas tree I found?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe lights don\u2019t work,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take a look at those when I get home.\u201d</p><p>It was unusual for his father to work on Sundays. But he must\u2019ve been putting in overtime at the restaurant. Christmas was a busy season and his father said they could use the money, so he worked as many overtime hours as he could get.</p><p>Carter wished his father was home the way he was almost every Sunday. Usually they watched football together. If he\u2019d been able to keep Rusty, then his dog would\u2019ve joined them. Carter was sure Rusty would enjoy football as much as he did.</p><p>\u201cYou still feel bad about Rusty?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo do I,\u201d his father admitted.</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s going to a good family and they\u2019ll love Rusty, too.\u201d</p><p>But Carter didn\u2019t want any other family to love Rusty. He wanted Rusty to be his. He hung his head. \u201cWhen will you be home?\u201d he asked, his voice cracking.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get there as soon as I can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBye, Dad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBye, son.\u201d</p><p>Carter handed the phone back to his mother; before she hung up, their father spoke to Bailey, too.</p><p>Then he heard it.</p><p>A dog barking.</p><p>It sounded as if Rusty was right outside the door. That wasn\u2019t possible, but it sure sounded like his dog.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that noise?\u201d his mother asked, frowning in his direction. She walked to the back door and opened it.</p><p>As Carter held his breath, he heard his mother cry out.</p><p>\u201cRusty!\u201d Bailey shrieked.</p><p>\u201cRusty.\u201d Carter flew out of his chair so fast it went crashing backward onto the kitchen floor.</p><p>His mother opened the screen door and Rusty ran in, leaping up on his hind legs and dashing around in a circle and then jumping straight up in the air.</p><p>A moment later Rusty was licking Carter\u2019s face, yelping with joy. He flopped down on his belly, right in front of Carter, tail waving madly.</p><p>When Carter looked up at his mother, he saw that she had tears in her eyes. Soon she was down on the floor with him, hugging Rusty, too, along with Bailey. Even his sister was crying.</p><p>\u201cHow did he ever get here?\u201d His mother stared at Carter.</p><p>He didn\u2019t have an answer for her. All he knew was that the animal shelter wasn\u2019t close by. It was miles and miles away.</p><p>Carter got a dish and filled it with water. Rusty lapped that up and ate every bit of popcorn on the floor.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure if popcorn\u2019s good for him or not,\u201d his mother warned.</p><p>Carter went to the cupboard for the cereal he\u2019d fed him the day before. He prepared another large bowlful, with plenty of milk. His dog certainly wasn\u2019t a picky eater.</p><p>\u201cOh, Carter.\u201d His mother sighed deeply. \u201cI don\u2019t know what your father\u2019s going to say about this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t call him at work,\u201d Carter pleaded. He was afraid his father would come home and take Rusty back to the shelter that very minute. He didn\u2019t want that to happen. Not yet. Not ever. Still, he realized his father wouldn\u2019t let Rusty stay, and he wanted to keep his dog with him as long as he could.</p><p>They finished stringing the popcorn and draping the strands on the tree. When Carter crawled underneath, Rusty came with him. With the dog at his side, Carter plugged the electrical cord in the socket again. This time the lights went on\u2014and stayed on.</p><p>\u201cCool,\u201d his sister cried and clapped her hands.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s magic,\u201d Carter said. \u201cRusty brought it with him.\u201d</p><p>When they crawled out from under the tree, Rusty lay down on the carpet and rested his head on his paws. He looked about as tired as Carter felt, and he wondered if Rusty had stayed awake all night, thinking about Carter, the way Carter had about him. Unable to stop himself, Carter yawned.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t we all lie down for a bit,\u201d his mother suggested, eyeing him. It was almost as if she knew he\u2019d hardly slept the night before. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t take naps,\u201d Carter said indignantly. Bailey sometimes did. When she got cranky, their mother would send her into their bedroom. Bailey always fell asleep.</p><p>\u201cIt looks like Rusty\u2019s tired,\u201d his mother suggested. \u201cI just thought you might want to keep him company.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>Rusty followed Carter into his bedroom and lay on the rug beside his bed. Instead of climbing onto the mattress, Carter got down on the floor next to his dog. He flung his arm over Rusty and drifted off.</p> <p>The next thing Carter heard was the sound of his father\u2019s voice.</p><p>\u201cHow is this possible?\u201d his father was asking.</p><p>\u201cDad!\u201d Carter leaped to his feet and tore into the kitchen, Rusty at his heels. \u201cDid you hear?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d his father said. \u201cWhat I don\u2019t understand is how he found the house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut he did.\u201d</p> <p>Rusty approached his father and gazed up at him.</p><p>His father bent down to pet Rusty\u2019s thick fur. \u201cWell, my son said you were a special dog.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot only that,\u201d Carter rushed to tell his father, \u201cwhen we first plugged in the tree, the lights only flickered and then they went out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd after Rusty got here, Carter plugged in the lights and they worked,\u201d Bailey said, so happy and excited that her words ran together.</p><p>Carter frowned at his sister. \u201cI wanted to tell Dad that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan he stay?\u201d Ignoring him, Bailey turned to her father, eyes wide.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, kids, we\u2019ve already been through this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDavid, here\u2019s the number for the shelter,\u201d his mother said as she came into the room.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to call and find out what happened.\u201d His father took the slip of paper and reached for the telephone. Carter stood by his side. He wanted to learn what had happened, too.</p><p>His father seemed to wait for a long time. Carter could hear the phone ringing. Holding the receiver away from his mouth, his dad muttered, \u201cThe shelter must be closed for the night.\u201d</p><p>Hope flared to life inside Carter. Maybe they\u2019d have to keep Rusty overnight. Maybe\u2014</p><p>\u201cHello,\u201d his father said, dashing Carter\u2019s hopes. \u201cYes, I understand the shelter\u2019s closed.\u201d He seemed to be listening. \u201cWe\u2019re the family who brought Rusty. He\u2019s the reddish stray that showed up in the schoolyard and followed my son home. I dropped Rusty off at the shelter yesterday afternoon. Well, Rusty\u2019s now here.\u201d</p><p>This announcement was followed by a short silence. Carter\u2019s father was shaking his head, as if the person on the other end of the line was arguing with him.</p><p>\u201cI assure you he\u2019s here.\u201d</p> <p>Another silence.</p><p>\u201cWell, you might want to go and check his cage.\u201d</p><p>The person from the shelter must\u2019ve said something else, because his father grew quiet once more. \u201cHe\u2019s going to check the cage where Rusty was put earlier,\u201d he told Carter.</p><p>The shelter employee was obviously back on the phone.</p><p>\u201cYes, he\u2019s here,\u201d his father explained for the third time. \u201cI don\u2019t have a clue how he escaped or how he managed to get back to this house, but somehow or other, he did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan he stay the night?\u201d Carter pleaded. \u201cJust one more night. Please, Dad, please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I\u2019ll bring him back in the morning,\u201d his father was saying.</p><p>Carter wrapped his arms around Rusty\u2019s neck. He had no idea how the dog had found his way across miles and miles of snow-covered roads to their house\u2014but he\u2019d always known Rusty possessed special powers.</p><p>His father hung up the phone. \u201cHe can only stay until morning, Carter.\u201d</p><p>Carter nodded. It wasn\u2019t long enough, but for this one last night, Rusty was his.</p><p>Eighteen</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re here!\u201d Rosalie shouted from the living room. Her voice rose with excitement. She\u2019d gone to look out the window every few minutes, waiting for their daughter and her husband.</p><p>\u201cIs it Donna?\u201d Harry asked. He was no less excited than his wife.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Rosalie said, letting the curtain fall back into place.</p><p>Harry struggled to get to his feet, and instantly Rosalie was at his side. She brought him the walker he hated and then slid her arm around his waist, guiding him into the hall.</p><p>\u201cHow do I look?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Harry pretended to study her, noting her carefully combed hair, a soft lovely gray, and the antique cameo she wore with her dark green dress. \u201cYou couldn\u2019t be more beautiful if you\u2019d tried.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Harry.\u201d</p><p>At his words, Harry could see the blush of pleasure that crept across her cheeks.</p><p>The door opened and in breezed his daughter, with Richard, their son-in-law, both of them laden with parcels and bags. Soon everyone was kissing and hugging. Rosalie had tears in her eyes and, for that matter, so did Harry. Seeing his daughter renewed his waning strength.</p><p>All their married life, Rosalie had been a gracious hostess, and as soon as Donna and Richard had taken their coats off, she led them to the formal living room and brought out a tray of coffee and cookies.</p><p>Donna helped serve, and before long they were all sitting together, chatting and catching up. Harry watched his daughter\u2019s animated gestures, and his heart swelled with love. In appearance, Donna resembled Rosalie\u2019s family, with her dark brown hair and eyes. Her personality, though, was all his. She was practical but enjoyed taking a risk now and then.</p><p>Donna was a teacher and had taught kindergarten and first grade for nearly thirty years. She was close to retirement, as was Richard. They\u2019d met in college and married soon after. They\u2019d presented him with two wonderful grandsons, two years apart.</p><p>\u201cTell me about Scotty,\u201d Rosalie said, eager for news of their youngest grandson. In a recent conversation, Donna had hinted that she had something special to share.</p><p>Donna and Richard smiled at each other, and Richard reached for his wife\u2019s hand.</p><p>\u201cScott\u2019s engaged!\u201d Donna said happily.</p><p>\u201cIs it Lana?\u201d Harry asked. Their grandson had stopped by to visit in September and had brought a young woman to meet them. Harry recognized the look in his eyes. The boy was in love.</p><p>\u201cYes. Everyone likes Lana,\u201d Donna said. \u201cWe\u2019re all so pleased. Rich and I recently met her parents, and they\u2019re just as thrilled as we are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen\u2019s the wedding?\u201d Rosalie asked.</p><p>\u201cFebruary,\u201d Donna told her mother.</p><p>\u201cSo soon!\u201d his wife trilled, her eyes glowing. \u201cOh, I\u2019m so glad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLana wanted to wait for June,\u201d Donna said, \u201cbut Scott said a Valentine wedding was more romantic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho would\u2019ve guessed that about Scott?\u201d Richard asked.</p><p>Rosalie glanced at Harry and they exchanged a smile. \u201cHe gets his romantic heart from his grandfather.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDad?\u201d Donna did an exaggerated double take.</p><p>\u201cYour father\u2019s sent me flowers every Valentine\u2019s Day since the year we met. Even during the war.\u201d Her eyes filled with tears as she looked at him. Pulling her lace-edged handkerchief from her sleeve, she dabbed her cheeks. \u201cThis is such good news, isn\u2019t it, dear?\u201d</p><p>Harry nodded. All his grandchildren would be married now. Although Harry had only met Lana that one time, he believed the young woman was a good match for his youngest grandson.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not our only news,\u201d Donna said. Once again she smiled at Richard. \u201cPhillip called last week and Tiffany\u2019s pregnant.\u201d</p><p>Rosalie squealed with delight.</p><p>\u201cRich and I are going to be grandparents.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, my goodness,\u201d Rosalie said, clasping her hands. \u201cThat means Harry and I will be great-grandparents.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re much too young to be a great-grandmother,\u201d Harry teased, just so he could watch Rosalie blush once more.</p><p>\u201cNonsense,\u201d his wife countered. \u201cSome of our friends are great-grandparents several times over.\u201d</p><p>That was true, and Harry didn\u2019t bother to comment. He\u2019d hoped to live long enough to meet his first great-grandchild but that wasn\u2019t to be.</p><p>Richard helped himself to another cookie. Rosalie had picked them up at the bakery on Saturday, and although he wouldn\u2019t tell her this, Harry thought they were as good as any she might have baked. Actually, he wouldn\u2019t mind a second one himself. As soon as he stretched out his arm, Rosalie immediately lifted the platter and offered it to him.</p><p>Donna was still talking about the baby. She\u2019d be the perfect grandmother, Harry knew. She\u2019d been an excellent mother, and after all those years spent teaching six- and seven-year-olds, she had a real way with kids. Donna\u2019s students loved her; it wasn\u2019t unusual for teenagers and adults to come and see her\u2014people, who at one time, had been in her class.</p><p>\u201cWhen\u2019s Tiffany due?\u201d Rosalie asked.</p><p>\u201cJuly,\u201d Donna said. \u201cWe don\u2019t know if it\u2019s a boy or a girl, although I don\u2019t think anyone really cares. The timing is certainly good.\u201d</p><p>Richard smiled. \u201cPhillip\u2019s out of graduate school now and the job he got with Microsoft seems secure. Or as secure as any corporate job is these days.\u201d He turned to Harry, who nodded. Over the years, they\u2019d often discussed the economy and related issues.</p><p>\u201cPhillip does a bit more traveling than either of them would like,\u201d Donna added, \u201cbut he\u2019s in training, so that goes with the territory.\u201d</p><p>Richard sipped his coffee. \u201cI understand the two of you are planning to sell the house,\u201d he said.</p><p>Rosalie sighed and aimed a sad smile at Harry.</p><p>\u201cUnfortunately we had some bad news regarding Liberty Orchard,\u201d Harry told him. In retrospect he\u2019d give just about anything to have handed the administrator a check for the deposit the day they\u2019d toured the facility. \u201cApparently the only available unit has already been taken.\u201d</p><p>Donna leaned forward. \u201cThat\u2019s what Mom said, so I phoned Liberty Orchard and talked to Elizabeth Goldsmith myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe can\u2019t wave a magic wand and make another unit appear.\u201d Harry didn\u2019t want to admit how much the news depressed him. This was to be his last gift to Rosalie before he died, and now it wasn\u2019t going to happen.</p><p>\u201cWhen I phoned,\u201d Donna went on to say, \u201cMs. Goldsmith said she was just about to contact you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe unit\u2019s available?\u201d Harry felt a surge of hope.</p><p>\u201cNot the one you originally saw, but another one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid someone die?\u201d Rosalie asked, frowning.</p><p>\u201cNo, it belonged to a couple. Perhaps you met them. Ralph and Daisy\u2014I can\u2019t remember their last name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMcDonald,\u201d Harry supplied. He remembered talking with the two and had quite liked them. Their children both lived in Chicago. \u201cAre they moving closer to their son and daughter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen?\u201d Rosalie asked.</p><p>\u201cThey hope to be out by the fifth of January. It\u2019ll take a couple of days to give the unit a thorough cleaning and then it\u2019ll be ready for you and Dad by the tenth.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll get them a check right after Christmas,\u201d Harry said, unable to hide his pleasure.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all taken care of, Dad,\u201d Donna said. \u201cI knew you\u2019d want the unit, so Rich and I put it on our credit card.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get the check to you then. Immediately.\u201d The fact that they\u2019d used credit bothered him; he couldn\u2019t help it.</p><p>Donna gestured magnanimously. \u201cConsider it your Christmas gift.\u201d</p> <p>Harry wouldn\u2019t allow his daughter to do that; still, the certainty of acquiring the unit afforded him real peace of mind.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s wonderful news,\u201d Rosalie agreed, nodding vigorously.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s even better than you realize,\u201d Donna said. \u201cI\u2019ll be here the entire time to help you move.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about school?\u201d Harry asked.</p><p>Donna smiled. \u201cThat\u2019s my other surprise. I\u2019m retiring. As of now.\u201d</p> <p>Harry stared at her. \u201cBut...it\u2019s the middle of the school year.\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, this is a good news/bad news situation,\u201d Rich explained. \u201cDonna needs knee-replacement surgery.\u201d</p><p>Their daughter nodded. \u201cI guess that\u2019s what I get from all those years of crawling around on the floor with my kindergarten classes. It isn\u2019t extensive surgery, but it\u2019ll require several weeks of rehab. I\u2019d already decided to retire at the end of this school year. But with the wedding, the surgery and the baby, Rich and I felt it made more sense to do it now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think this is wonderful,\u201d Rosalie said again.</p><p>Rosalie had always supported their children\u2019s decisions, even when they gave Harry pause. She was loyal to a fault; he loved that about her.</p><p>\u201cThe paperwork\u2019s been turned in and everything\u2019s a go.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou should\u2019ve told us,\u201d Rosalie chastised.</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t until I got the final word. I didn\u2019t mean to hide it from you, Mom, but I know how you worry.\u201d</p><p>While Donna claimed it was the surgery, the wedding and the baby, Harry suspected there was another reason his daughter had chosen to retire early. \u201cSo you\u2019ll help us pack up the house,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely. Lorraine, too.\u201d</p><p>This was welcome news to Harry. His prayer had been answered\u2014they had a place at Liberty Orchard now. And his daughters would both be here. If God should choose to bring him home, Harry could be assured that Rosalie would be well looked after.</p><p>This was going to be the best Christmas of his life. And the last...</p><p>Nineteen</p><p>Beth yawned. It\u2019d been a long day, beginning with church that morning and then brunch with her family. Now, at almost ten, she was tired and ready for bed. She\u2019d logged on to World of Warcraft a little while ago and was disappointed to discover that Peter wasn\u2019t online. Still, she felt relieved that they\u2019d decided to postpone their meeting until after New Year\u2019s. That gave her time to make a few decisions, time to assess the situation and consider how to deal with what she\u2019d learned.</p> <p>The doorbell chimed. Beth frowned, wondering who\u2019d stop by this late at night.</p><p>When she checked the peephole, she saw a lovely woman standing in the hallway. Whoever it was had the most incredible blue eyes. Beth didn\u2019t recognize her. But even though she didn\u2019t know who this woman was, she unlatched the door and opened it.</p><p>Instead of the woman she\u2019d seen through the peephole, a man stood there in front of her. Not just any man. John Nicodemus, her ex-husband.</p><p>Peter.</p><p>If Beth was shocked, it was nothing compared to the look on Peter\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cMarybeth?\u201d he whispered as if he couldn\u2019t seem to find his voice. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI live here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you don\u2019t,\u201d he argued.</p><p>\u201cAre you looking for Borincana?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Peter went pale.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re Timixie,\u201d she added. It was obvious that they both needed to sit down, so she stepped out of the doorway and waved him inside.</p><p>Peter moved into the living room and sank heavily onto the sofa. Elbows balanced on his knees, he thrust his fingers through his hair and stared down at the floor.</p><p>Beth understood exactly how he felt because she\u2019d experienced the very same mix of emotions when she\u2019d seen him in Leavenworth. It had felt as if the sidewalk had started to crumble beneath her feet. The shock had been followed by anger and disbelief.</p><p>Yesterday in Leavenworth, she\u2019d suspected him of somehow arranging this. As she watched his face, she could see that he was feeling doubt, incredulity, suspicion\u2014just as she had.</p><p>\u201cHow can this be?\u201d he murmured after several minutes.</p><p>\u201cI asked myself that, too.\u201d</p><p>His eyes narrowed. \u201cHow long have you known?\u201d</p><p>She wanted it understood that she hadn\u2019t arranged this, any more than he had. \u201cSince Leavenworth.\u201d</p><p>His mouth tightened. \u201cYou were there?\u201d</p><p>Beth nodded. \u201cYou were standing by the gazebo, exactly as we\u2019d agreed. Then I saw that red rose and I nearly fainted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho was on the phone?\u201d he demanded. \u201cI would\u2019ve recognized your voice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy friend Heidi. She\u2019s a new friend\u2014you never met her.\u201d</p><p>He straightened, then leaned back against the sofa as he absorbed her words.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you here?\u201d she asked. Beth studied him carefully. He was even more attractive than she remembered. The years had matured him, and his features had lost their boyish quality. He looked more serious now, more...adult. They\u2019d both been so juvenile and irrational, so quick to get out of the relationship. Beth had felt blindsided by the pain of it and she thought that John...Peter might have been, too. Certainly, his online confidences suggested as much.</p><p>\u201cI shouldn\u2019t have come,\u201d he muttered. \u201cThe whole time I was driving here, I couldn\u2019t figure out why I was doing this.\u201d</p><p>Beth didn\u2019t understand it, either. They\u2019d already said they\u2019d wait until after New Year\u2019s.</p><p>He closed his eyes for a few seconds, then opened them again and looked directly at her. \u201cThis afternoon we made our plans but all of a sudden that wasn\u2019t good enough. I couldn\u2019t stop thinking about you. I was afraid that if we delayed meeting again, neither of us would ever be ready. It was just too easy to keep putting it off.\u201d</p><p>Beth could see that was true.</p><p>\u201cOnce I made the decision, waiting even an hour seemed intolerable. I had your address from the phone call in Leavenworth\u2014thanks to your friend, as it turns out. I decided to meet you and I didn\u2019t care that it was after nine at night and I was coming uninvited.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly you had met me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I could hardly know that, could I?\u201d he snapped, then seemed to regret his outburst. \u201cHow did something like this happen?\u201d he asked helplessly.</p><p>She responded with a question of her own. \u201cWhen did John become Peter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen I began working in the corporate office at Starbucks. There were four Johns, so I decided to use my middle name and I just got used to it. The only people who call me John these days are my parents.\u201d</p><p>In other words, his name change had come about in a perfectly rational way\u2014it was certainly no attempt at subterfuge.</p><p>\u201cWhat about you, Marybeth?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMarybeth became Beth after the divorce.\u201d</p><p>He regarded her skeptically. \u201cAny particular reason?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wanted a new start, and Marybeth sounded so childish and outdated to me, so I shortened it to Beth. The only people who still call me Marybeth are my family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d He rubbed his face. \u201cI don\u2019t mean to be forward here, but I could use a cup of coffee.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. I\u2019m sorry, I should\u2019ve asked.\u201d She stood and took two steps toward the kitchen before abruptly turning back. \u201cHow\u2019d you do that, by the way?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI checked the peephole in my door before I unlocked it and there was a woman on the other side.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA woman?\u201d He wore a puzzled frown.</p><p>\u201cShe was attractive and had blond hair and striking blue eyes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cObviously.\u201d</p><p>He met her gaze head-on. \u201cI was the only one there, Beth. Maybe you should have your eyesight examined.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe you should\u2014\u201d She clamped her mouth shut. They had too many other things to discuss. An argument would be pointless; it didn\u2019t matter what or whom she\u2019d seen\u2014or thought she\u2019d seen. \u201cGive me a minute to make that coffee.\u201d</p><p>Unexpectedly, Peter followed her into the kitchen. \u201cWhat just happened back there?\u201d he asked with obvious surprise.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d She efficiently measured the grounds and poured water into the coffeemaker.</p><p>\u201cYou dropped the discussion.\u201d</p><p>Confused, Beth glanced over at him. \u201cWhat discussion?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt used to be that you absolutely had to be right,\u201d he told her. \u201cYou\u2019d go ten miles out of your way to prove how right you were and how wrong I was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did?\u201d Beth didn\u2019t remember it like that.</p><p>\u201cYou always had a point to prove.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, well, people change.\u201d</p><p>Peter didn\u2019t speak for some time. \u201cI\u2019ve changed, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure we both have.\u201d For the better, although she didn\u2019t say that. After six months of being his partner on WoW, she knew this man, knew important things about his character, and he wasn\u2019t like her ex-husband at all.</p><p>The coffee started to drip and Beth got two mugs from the cupboard. Staring down at the kitchen counter, she gathered her courage to ask him a question.</p><p>\u201cDid you mean what you said this afternoon about...still loving me?\u201d The words seemed to stick in her throat.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>She wished he\u2019d elaborate\u2014and a moment later he did.</p><p>\u201cI never stopped loving you, Marybeth. That was one of the problems. For years, the people closest to me have encouraged me to find someone else and remarry. I tried.\u201d</p><p>She jerked up her head. \u201cSo it\u2019s true?\u201d Abruptly her heart sank, and she actually felt ill. \u201cYou did marry again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he returned vehemently. \u201cWho told you that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA friend. Well, sort of a friend. Lisa Carroll. Remember her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Peter frowned. \u201cShe told you that?\u201d When Beth nodded, he pressed his palms on the kitchen counter. \u201cThat isn\u2019t even close to being true. Why would she do that?\u201d He paused. \u201cWhat about you? Have you...did you find someone else?\u201d</p><p>Beth shrugged, unwilling to disclose that she\u2019d been practically a hermit in the dating world. \u201cI went out some. No one for long.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI occasionally dated, too,\u201d he confessed. \u201cIncluding Lisa,\u201d he added in a low voice. \u201cFor about two weeks.\u201d</p><p>Well, that explains it, Beth thought\u2014but didn\u2019t say.</p><p>\u201cNo one clicked with me,\u201d she said after a brief silence.</p><p>He offered her a sad smile. \u201cNo one clicked with me, either.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMostly I was afraid.\u201d Because she needed something to do with her hands, she filled the two mugs with coffee, welcoming the distraction.</p><p>Peter reached for his mug and she automatically opened her refrigerator and took out the milk.</p><p>He smiled. \u201cYou remember that I take milk in my coffee.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow could I forget?\u201d she asked, a smile tugging at the corners of her own mouth. \u201cDon\u2019t you remember we had that huge fight over milk? I\u2019d forgotten to pick some up on my way home.\u201d</p> <p>Peter threw back his head and stared at the ceiling. \u201cI was pretty unreasonable back then.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d thought the same thing. He\u2019d accused her of intentionally forgetting the milk, apparently convinced that she\u2019d done it in retaliation, since he\u2019d been right in a silly argument they\u2019d had the day before. It\u2019d all been so stupid, so adolescent.</p><p>Peter poured a dollop of milk into his coffee, then returned the carton to the refrigerator. Beth watched in amazement. While they were married, he\u2019d driven her to the brink of insanity by leaving everything out. He left drawers open, newspapers on the floor, dirty dishes everywhere.</p><p>When she complained, he\u2019d accused her of being too fastidious and a \u201cneat freak.\u201d Beth hadn\u2019t seen herself as either; however she\u2019d considered him lazy and disorganized\u2014and had told him so.</p><p>They both sipped their coffee for a couple of minutes, leaning casually against the kitchen counters. Despite her relaxed pose, Beth felt anything but.</p> <p>\u201cDid you mean what you said?\u201d Peter gazed at her over the top of his mug.</p><p>She knew what he was asking. \u201cI always loved you. Even when I filed for divorce, I loved you. I couldn\u2019t live with you, but that didn\u2019t change how I felt about you.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled softly and nodded. \u201cIt was the same with me. You were driving me crazy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe did it to each other.\u201d Beth set her mug on the counter. \u201cSo,\u201d she said, sighing. \u201cThis afternoon you said you don\u2019t want to look back and that it\u2019s time to move forward.\u201d</p><p>He nodded again. \u201cIt\u2019s time for both of us to let go of the past, Marybeth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd...what about the future?\u201d</p> <p>He didn\u2019t answer right away. He glanced at her, his eyes uncertain, then looked away. \u201cIn other words, you\u2019re asking where we go from here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a fair question, don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI agree. Only I\u2019m not sure what to say. Is it just a coincidence that we\u2019ve been online together for the past six months and neither of us realized it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never dreamed it could be you,\u201d she said. \u201cI didn\u2019t set this up...I wouldn\u2019t know how.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI believe you. I couldn\u2019t have, either.\u201d</p><p>Suddenly she recalled the conversation she\u2019d had with her mother and the fact that Joyce had even lit a candle in church on her behalf. She took a deep breath. \u201cIt seems to me that we were brought back together for a reason.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Beth\u2019s heart pounded frantically as Peter put down his mug and walked around the counter to stand in front of her. He settled his hands on her shoulders and stared into her eyes.</p> <p>\u201cIf you\u2019re willing to give us another chance, I think we should do it,\u201d he said in an urgent voice.</p><p>Beth gave him a tentative smile. \u201cI\u2019m willing.\u201d</p><p>That was when he kissed her. As he lowered his mouth to hers, Beth closed her eyes and slipped her arms around him. His lips were soft, pliable, warm. The years fell away, and it was as if they were college students again, hungry for each other, desperately in love and ready to take on dragons and warriors and despots and worse.</p><p>Beth eased her mouth from his. \u201cDo you want to spend Christmas with me and my family?\u201d she asked, smiling up at him.</p><p>Peter laughed. \u201cIf you\u2019ll spend New Year\u2019s with mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery clever, Goodness,\u201d Mercy said, sitting on the counter in Beth Fischer\u2019s kitchen, swinging her feet.</p><p>\u201cI had to do something,\u201d Goodness told her. \u201cPeter and Beth were content to delay their meeting, so I had to put an end to that.\u201d She turned to Mercy and smiled. \u201cI\u2019ve learned men are much more suggestible than women.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve discovered the same thing,\u201d Shirley said, joining them. \u201cThat wasn\u2019t all, though. Stepping in front of Peter when he arrived at Beth\u2019s so she saw your face instead of his was brilliant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTricky, too.\u201d Mercy\u2019s voice was admiring. Goodness had to reveal herself to Beth, yet remain hidden from Peter. Not an easy task and if Gabriel ever found out, she\u2019d never hear the end of it.</p><p>\u201cGabriel will be pleased when he learns Beth and Peter are together again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think he will, too,\u201d Goodness said.</p><p>Her mission had been completed.</p><p>The candle Joyce Fischer had lit in the church flickered one last time and then went out.</p><p>Twenty</p><p>That night, knowing Rusty would have to go back to the animal shelter, Carter settled the dog on his bed. Placing both arms around him, Carter spoke softly in his ear.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the best dog any kid could have,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>As if he understood the words, Rusty licked Carter\u2019s face. He seemed to be saying that Carter was the best friend he\u2019d ever have, too.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d do anything to keep you. Well...almost anything.\u201d After his father had come home from work and explained that they\u2019d be taking Rusty back to the shelter in the morning, Carter had seriously considered running away.</p><p>If his mom and dad weren\u2019t going to let him have Rusty, then Carter decided he no longer wanted to be part of this family. He\u2019d find another family, one that could afford a dog and kept promises.</p><p>He had over thirty dollars saved from his allowance, which should be enough to get him to his grandparents\u2019 house in Wenatchee. He was sure that if they knew about Rusty, Grandma and Grandpa Parker would pay whatever it cost to keep him.</p><p>But in the end, Carter couldn\u2019t do it. He couldn\u2019t run away. He loved his mother and father and even his little sister, although she was a pest most of the time.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go back to the shelter with you,\u201d Carter assured his friend. In the morning he\u2019d ride down with his father. He was determined to speak to the lady who\u2019d taken Rusty before.</p><p>Carter wanted to make sure his dog went to a good home. Not just a regular home, either. The very best.</p><p>Carter had prayed for a dog and he\u2019d prayed hard. Although he loved Rusty, maybe\u2014despite everything\u2014this wasn\u2019t the dog God meant for him.</p><p>Tears welled up in his eyes and he tried to hold back a sniffle. He didn\u2019t want his sister to hear him crying, so he buried his face in the dog\u2019s fur.</p><p>\u201cI want to keep Rusty, too,\u201d Bailey whispered from the other side of the room.</p><p>Carter pretended not to hear.</p><p>\u201cI love Rusty just as much as you do,\u201d she said, only louder this time.</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>She sniffled once and then Carter did, too. \u201cGo to sleep,\u201d he said.</p><p>Bailey didn\u2019t answer, and Carter suspected she felt as sad as he did. Even if Rusty belonged to him, he was willing to share his dog with Bailey. Not every day; just some of the time\u2014once a week or so.</p><p>Except that Rusty wouldn\u2019t be his to share. His friend would be with him for only a few more hours. The realization was crushing.</p><p>\u201cGo to sleep,\u201d he repeated and hugged Rusty closer.</p><p>\u201cThis is a fine mess you\u2019ve gotten yourself into,\u201d Mercy muttered, glaring at Shirley. They were both inside the children\u2019s bedroom. Shirley sat on the foot of the bed, where Rusty lay tightly curled up next to Carter\u2019s feet.</p><p>\u201cMe?\u201d Shirley wore a look of innocence as she continued to pet the dog.</p><p>\u201cYes, you.\u201d Mercy pointed an accusing finger at her fellow Prayer Ambassador. Then she crossed her arms as she surveyed the sleeping children, lost in their dreams.</p><p>\u201cHow could you have let this happen?\u201d Mercy asked.</p><p>Shirley straightened defensively.</p><p>Mercy wasn\u2019t fooled. \u201cYou\u2019re the one who stopped by the animal shelter and conveniently opened the cage and set Rusty free.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh...\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat wasn\u2019t the only door you opened, either.\u201d Mercy was on to her friend\u2019s antics and she wasn\u2019t going to let Shirley squirm out of this one.</p><p>\u201cWell...\u201d Shirley shifted uncomfortably. As though aware of their presence, Rusty lifted his head and looked around.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right, boy,\u201d Shirley whispered, reassuring the dog.</p><p>Rusty put his head down on his paws and closed his eyes once more.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t bother to deny that you\u2019re the one who set him free,\u201d Mercy said in a stern voice.</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d Shirley confessed. \u201cThat was me\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t help it! Carter loves that dog, and Rusty loves him. The two of them are meant to be together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot according to what you first said.\u201d Although she made it sound like a complaint, Mercy was actually delighted with her friend. In the past, Shirley had been a real stickler for protocol during their earthly visitations. The former guardian angel always took on the role of supervisor, policing Goodness and Mercy as if that was her right. She found it gratifying that, for once, Shirley had broken the rules herself.</p><p>\u201cJust look at Carter and Rusty,\u201d Shirley urged. \u201cHow can anyone take that dog away from that little boy?\u201d</p><p>Mercy gazed down at the sleeping figures. Rusty slept peacefully close to Carter and Mercy was moved almost to tears by their mutual devotion.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going to happen now?\u201d Mercy asked.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Shirley shook her head. \u201cI pleaded Carter\u2019s case to Gabriel. That\u2019s all I can do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did?\u201d Many a time Mercy had done the same, but to no avail. She didn\u2019t think Shirley had gone to the Archangel even once to request assistance. Until now.</p><p>\u201cWhat did he say?\u201d</p><p>Shirley cleared her throat. \u201cHe said I\u2019d already interfered where I shouldn\u2019t have. That God has everything under control.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo he knew what you\u2019d done.\u201d This shouldn\u2019t surprise Mercy. Gabriel always seemed to be aware of their every move.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m to butt out.\u201d She sounded a little affronted, and Mercy couldn\u2019t blame her.</p><p>\u201cGabriel told you that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn exactly those words, too. He warned me that I\u2019m not to involve myself in any way from this point forward. He did ask me to stick around, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI should hope so.\u201d</p><p>Shirley glanced down at the floor. \u201cGabriel wasn\u2019t happy with me.\u201d</p><p>Mercy shrugged, as if to imply that should be expected. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about it. Gabriel knew what he was doing when he sent us back to Earth.\u201d</p><p>Shirley nodded morosely.</p><p>Seeing that her friend felt bad, Mercy decided to inject a bit of entertainment into their visit to Leavenworth. \u201cWant to have some fun?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>As little as a week ago, Shirley would have sharply chastised Mercy for even suggesting such a thing. This time she simply gazed at her. \u201cWhat do you have in mind?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you noticed the ornaments hanging from the streetlamps?\u201d Actually, they were pretty hard to miss. The town council had hung large wreaths, candy canes and candles, interspersed with a few unrealistic-looking angels.</p><p>\u201cI was thinking,\u201d Mercy went on, \u201cof rearranging the ornaments, mixing things up a bit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe could make all the ornaments that aren\u2019t angels disappear,\u201d Shirley said tentatively, entering into the spirit of the enterprise.</p> <p>\u201cI like it,\u201d Mercy said excitedly.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s contact Goodness and get started.\u201d</p><p>Tonight was December twenty-third, and they had one last day on Earth. Christmas Eve, they\u2019d have to return to Heaven for the celebration. Only one day left, and Mercy intended to make the most of it.</p><p>Carter was tucked warmly in his bed when Rusty began to bark. The barking became louder and more frantic and it didn\u2019t stop. At first Carter ignored it, trying to sleep. But when he finally forced open his eyes, he couldn\u2019t see. The entire bedroom was filled with fog. There was a horrible smell. Like something burning.</p><p>The fog was so thick he couldn\u2019t even see his sister\u2019s bed. He choked. Taking a breath was painful.</p> <p>Completely disoriented, he sat up.</p><p>\u201cBailey?\u201d</p><p>His sister didn\u2019t answer.</p><p>\u201cBailey!\u201d He tried again.</p><p>All at once, the bedroom door burst open and was shut with a bang. Out of the fog, his father emerged with his hand cupped over his nose and mouth.</p><p>\u201cDad? What\u2019s happening?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFire,\u201d his father said tersely. It wasn\u2019t fog then, but smoke. Carter\u2019s dad swooped him off the bed and into his arms. He stumbled across the room, carrying Carter, then set him down and reached for Bailey. Jerking open the bedroom window, he gently dropped her, bare feet and all, into the snow.</p><p>\u201cGet away from the house as fast as you can,\u201d he said. \u201cYour mother\u2019s out front waiting for you.\u201d</p><p>Carter watched his sister race through the snow.</p><p>The smoke that was now pouring out of the bedroom window made Carter\u2019s eyes smart. He was next. His father lowered him carefully into the snow, then looked over his shoulder and leaped out himself.</p><p>Father and son ran hand in hand around the side of the house.</p><p>In the distance, Carter heard the wail of a fire engine, the alarm piercing the night.</p><p>His house was on fire.</p><p>His mother cried out with relief when she saw Carter and his father. Sobbing, she held out her arms. She swept Carter into her embrace and started kissing him. He hugged her tight and felt the tears on her cheeks.</p> <p>The fire truck arrived and suddenly there were all kinds of people in front of the house. The paramedic put Carter and his family inside the aid car and checked their vital signs. His father had to breathe into an oxygen mask for a few minutes.</p><p>When Carter looked out the back of the aid car, he saw flames shooting up through the roof. The firefighters had the hoses going, and there seemed to be a dozen men and women at work.</p><p>\u201cWhat woke you up?\u201d The question came from the man who\u2019d given his father the mask.</p><p>Carter answered. \u201cRusty.\u201d All of a sudden he realized he didn\u2019t know where his dog was. Bolting to his feet, Carter screamed, \u201cWhere\u2019s Rusty?\u201d even though it hurt his throat to do that.</p><p>His father removed the mask. \u201cMy son\u2019s dog was barking,\u201d he said hoarsely. \u201cIf it hadn\u2019t been for Rusty, I would never have been able to get my family out of that house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Rusty? Where\u2019s Rusty?\u201d Carter cried, looking frantically in all directions. The thought of his dog still inside terrified him.</p><p>Then the sound of Rusty\u2019s bark cut through the night.</p><p>\u201cRusty!\u201d Carter jumped out of the aid car as the dog raced across the neighbor\u2019s yard toward him. Getting down on one knee in the snow, Carter wrapped his arms around the dog\u2019s neck and hugged him. \u201cYou saved us. You saved us,\u201d he whispered again and again.</p><p>His father joined Carter and knelt down next to him and the dog.</p><p>\u201cWell, boy,\u201d David said and his voice was shaking. \u201cWe still can\u2019t afford a dog, but you\u2019ve earned your way into our home for the rest of your life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you mean it, Dad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEvery word.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRusty,\u201d Carter choked out. Rusty was his dog, just the way he\u2019d always hoped, just the way he wanted. Tears fell from his eyes and Rusty repeatedly licked his face.</p><p>\u201cAll I can say,\u201d the man inside the aid car told them, \u201cis that you\u2019re mighty lucky you had that dog.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t luck,\u201d Carter insisted. \u201cRusty\u2019s the dog God sent me.\u201d</p><p>The medic nodded. \u201cYou\u2019ve got all the proof you need of that.\u201d</p><p>Twenty-One</p><p>Lorraine and her husband, Kenny, had arrived early on Christmas Eve. Now it was two o\u2019clock, and Rosalie was busy in the kitchen with her daughters, getting everything ready for dinner that evening. Richard and Ken sat with Harry in the family room, watching a football game on television. Two of the grandchildren would come later that afternoon.</p><p>This was all the Christmas Harry needed. With his children and two of his four grandchildren close, he was at peace.</p><p>Rising from his chair was difficult, and embarrassed by his need for it, Harry groped for the walker.</p><p>\u201cYou need any help with that, Dad?\u201d Richard asked.</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m fine. A little slow, but fine.\u201d A bit wobbly on his feet, he glanced over at the two men who\u2019d married his daughters. He loved them as much as he did Lorraine and Donna. They were the sons he\u2019d never had. It was through their children that Harry and Rosalie would live on.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you going, Dad?\u201d Lorraine asked, stepping out of the kitchen, wiping her hands on a dish towel. Harry didn\u2019t know what they were cooking in there, but it sure smelled good.</p><p>\u201cI thought I\u2019d rest for a while before dinner.\u201d</p><p>She put her arm around his waist and walked him down the hallway to the master bedroom.</p><p>Inside the room, Harry sat on the edge of his bed and Lorraine placed the walker where he could reach it once he awoke.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m grateful to have this moment alone with you,\u201d he said to his oldest daughter.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it, Dad?\u201d She sat on the bed beside him.</p><p>\u201cAfter I\u2019m gone, I\u2019ll need you to look after your mother. You and Donna.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know we will.\u201d Tears filled her eyes.</p><p>Harry took her hand and squeezed it. \u201cI don\u2019t want there to be tears when I pass, understand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Dad, of course there\u2019ll be tears. You have no idea how much you\u2019re loved. You\u2019re the very heart of our family.\u201d</p><p>Harry sighed, knowing their sadness couldn\u2019t be avoided. Death for him, though, would be freeing. \u201cDonna will be here to help your mother with the move.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKenny and I plan to come, as well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d Harry wasn\u2019t sure he\u2019d still be around by then. But everything had been set in motion, and that brought him a sense of peace. \u201cI think I\u2019d better rest for a while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood idea.\u201d When he lay down on the quilt, she kissed him on the cheek, then rearranged his pillows.</p><p>He\u2019d just closed his eyes when Rosalie came into the room. \u201cHow are you feeling, sweetheart?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m tired, that\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>She picked up the afghan at the foot of the bed and covered him gently. \u201cRest now, and I\u2019ll wake you in time for dinner.\u201d</p><p>Harry nodded, and then, as his wife of sixty-six years was about to leave the room, he reached for her hand.</p><p>Rosalie turned back expectantly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve always loved you, my Rose.\u201d</p><p>She smiled softly. \u201cI know, Harry. And you\u2019re the love of my life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis life and the next.\u201d</p><p>Rosalie bent down to kiss his cheek, and Harry closed his eyes.</p><p>\u201cHarry,\u201d Mercy whispered.</p><p>Harry Alderwood\u2019s eyes flickered open and he stared at her in astonishment. \u201cAm I dead? In Heaven?\u201d</p><p>Mercy nodded. \u201cLook,\u201d she said, with a gesture that swept from his head to his feet. \u201cYou\u2019re not old anymore. You\u2019re young again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRosalie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll see her soon,\u201d Mercy promised him. \u201cAnd when she gets here, she\u2019ll be the young woman you met all those years ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI saw you before,\u201d Harry said, pointing at Mercy. \u201cThat night I forgot my walker.\u201d</p><p>Mercy smiled. \u201cThat was me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou helped me, and I\u2019m most appreciative.\u201d</p><p>Shirley, Goodness and Mercy surrounded Harry. \u201cCome with us,\u201d Mercy said. \u201cYour parents and your brother are waiting for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom and Dad?\u201d he asked excitedly. \u201cAnd Ted, too?\u201d</p><p>Mercy smiled again. \u201cEveryone. All of Heaven has been waiting for your arrival. We\u2019re celebrating Christmas and you\u2019ll see\u2014it\u2019s nothing like it is on Earth.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel appeared before them. \u201cHarry Alderwood?\u201d</p><p>Harry, young and handsome, nodded.</p><p>\u201cWelcome to Paradise,\u201d Gabriel said. \u201cI\u2019ll take over from here.\u201d The Archangel looked at the three Prayer Ambassadors, dismissing them. \u201cI\u2019ll be joining you shortly.\u201d</p><p>Shirley, Goodness and Mercy stood in the choir loft at Leavenworth First Christian Church for the seven o\u2019clock Christmas Eve service. Once they were finished here, they\u2019d join Beth and her family at Midnight Mass in Seattle.</p><p>As the organ music swelled with the opening strains of \u201cO Holy Night,\u201d Goodness leaned over to her friends. \u201cJust wait until these humans hear the music in Heaven. Boy, are they in for a surprise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike Harry,\u201d Mercy said. She\u2019d served God as a Prayer Ambassador but she\u2019d never assisted in the crossing before now. Watching as the frail body of Harry Alderwood was transformed into that of a young man had been a moving experience. His spirit had been set free from his weak and failing heart, free from his pain and free from the restraints of the world.</p><p>\u201cLike Harry,\u201d Gabriel agreed, suddenly standing beside them. He focused his attention on Mercy. \u201cYou did well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she said humbly. \u201cI\u2019m glad I was there to escort him to Heaven.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s his family doing?\u201d Mercy asked, concerned for Rosalie and Harry\u2019s daughters. She couldn\u2019t imagine what it must\u2019ve been like for Rosalie to come into the bedroom and find that her husband had died in his sleep.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s never easy for those on Earth to lose a loved one,\u201d Gabriel told them.</p><p>\u201cThey don\u2019t understand, do they?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet,\u201d Gabriel said. \u201cFor now, they\u2019re looking through a dim glass. Soon, each one will know, each one will have his or her own experience and understand that death is not just an end but a beginning. A true beginning.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHow\u2019s Rosalie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt the moment, she\u2019s overwhelmed by grief. Her daughters are with her, though, and their love will sustain her. One or both of them will stay here until she\u2019s settled in Liberty Orchard.\u201d</p><p>That reassured Mercy.</p><p>The music came to a halt and the minister, Pastor Williams, stepped over to the podium in the front of the church.</p> <p>\u201cI have two announcements to make before we proceed with the Christmas program,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve received word that Harry Alderwood passed away this afternoon. I ask that we keep Rosalie and her family in our prayers.\u201d</p><p>Hushed murmurs rippled through the congregation.</p><p>\u201cAlso, as many of you know, the Jacksons lost their home in a fire last night. Fortunately, they have insurance. However, all their belongings have been destroyed. They\u2019re staying with relatives in Wenatchee right now, but if the people of our community could open their hearts to this young family, I know you will be blessed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s Carter\u2019s family,\u201d Shirley said, glancing at her friends.</p><p>\u201cAh, yes, Carter,\u201d Gabriel muttered, turning a suspicious look on Shirley.</p> <p>\u201cI promise you I didn\u2019t have anything to do with the house fire,\u201d she said, holding up her hands.</p><p>\u201cI know\u2014because the three of you were out rearranging the street displays.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh...\u201d Mercy stared down at her feet. It was just a little thing, something they\u2019d done for enjoyment. Surely Gabriel wouldn\u2019t mind. The residents didn\u2019t seem to.</p><p>\u201cYou knew about the fire?\u201d Shirley asked the Archangel.</p><p>\u201cI did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Clearly, curiosity was getting the better of her. \u201cHow did it start?\u201d</p> <p>Gabriel leaned against the railing in the choir loft. \u201cYou remember that Christmas tree David Jackson found by the Dumpster?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cYes...\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere was a reason it\u2019d been thrown away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt shorted out?\u201d</p><p>Gabriel nodded. \u201cCarter\u2019s mother didn\u2019t turn off the lights when they went to bed because she was afraid that once she did, they wouldn\u2019t come back on.\u201d He sighed. \u201cFoolishly they hadn\u2019t checked the batteries in their smoke alarm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, dear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe fire, while devastating, will work out well for the family. The insurance will take care of replacing their earthly possessions. David, Carter\u2019s father, will soon be offered a new job at higher pay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd his mother?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShe\u2019ll get that job with the school district and the family will be able to afford Rusty without a problem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s wonderful news,\u201d Goodness said.</p><p>\u201cWhat about Rusty?\u201d Shirley asked.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll live a good life and a long one. Rusty will be Carter\u2019s constant companion. They\u2019ll remain close until Rusty dies when he\u2019s sixteen human years old.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh-h-h,\u201d all three of them breathed.</p><p>\u201cCarter will remember his dog for the rest of his life.\u201d Gabriel touched Shirley\u2019s arm. \u201cWell done.\u201d</p><p>Shirley beamed at his praise.</p><p>\u201cTell us about Beth Fischer,\u201d Goodness said.</p><p>\u201cAh, yes, Beth and Peter. They\u2019re going to step into church right now.\u201d In the blink of an eye, it was almost midnight. The three Prayer Ambassadors and Gabriel made the transition from Leavenworth First Christian to St. Al-phonsus Catholic Church in Seattle.</p><p>The loft was crowded with members of the choir, resplendent in their long red robes. The music had just begun when Goodness saw Beth walking into the church with Peter at her side. A smile came over her as Beth and Peter entered the pew where the Fischer family was sitting.</p><p>Even from this distance, Goodness could see the surprise on Joyce Fischer\u2019s face as Beth gestured toward Peter. Soon Joyce and Peter were hugging.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019ll happen with them?\u201d Goodness asked. \u201cDo they remarry?\u201d</p><p>Gabriel grinned. \u201cYes, they\u2019ll wed just a few weeks from now. They\u2019ve both learned from their mistakes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ll have children, won\u2019t they?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThree,\u201d Gabriel said. \u201cTwo boys and a girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease tell me they won\u2019t name their children after their characters from World of Warcraft.\u201d Goodness grimaced and shook her head.</p><p>Gabriel laughed. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. The oldest boy will be John, the daughter Mary and the youngest boy\u2019s going to be named Tim.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor Timixie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll have to ask them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can?\u201d Goodness squealed excitedly.</p><p>\u201cNot for many years but in time, yes, you\u2019ll have that opportunity.\u201d</p><p>Goodness couldn\u2019t possibly have looked more pleased.</p><p>\u201cI believe we\u2019re late,\u201d Gabriel said, ushering the three toward Heaven.</p><p>\u201cSilent Night\u201d played softly at the church as Gabriel, along with Shirley, Goodness and Mercy, returned to Heaven, where the joyous celebration of the Savior\u2019s birth was about to take place.</p><p>\u201cPeace on Earth,\u201d Gabriel murmured as they ascended.</p><p>\u201cAnd goodwill to all mankind,\u201d Shirley added. \u201cDogs, too.\u201d</p><p>Goodness and Mercy laughed as the gates of Heaven opened to bring them home. </p> </body></html>"]
