Mine and Lake\u2019s year.</p> <p>The last few years have definitely not been in our favor. At the end of 2008, my parent's both passed away unexpectedly, leaving me to raise my little brother all on my own. It didn\u2019t help that Vaughn decided to end our two-year relationship on the heels of their death. To top it off, I ended up having to drop my scholarship. Leaving the University and moving back to Ypsilanti to become Caulder\u2019s guardian was one of the hardest decisions I\u2019ve ever made...but also one of the best decisions.</p><p>I spent every single day of the next year learning how to adjust. How to adjust to heartbreak, how to adjust to having no parents, how to adjust to essentially becoming a parent myself and the sole provider of a family. Looking back on it, I don't think I could have made it through 2009 without Caulder. He\u2019s the only thing that kept me going...</p><p>I don\u2019t even remember the entire first half of 2010. That year didn't start for me until September 22nd, the day I first laid eyes on Lake. Of course, 2010 turned out to be just as difficult as the previous years, but in a completely different way. I'd never felt more alive than when I was with her...but considering our circumstances, I couldn\u2019t be with her. So, I guess I didn\u2019t spend a lot of time feeling alive.</p><p>2011 was better in its own way. There was a lot of falling in love, a lot of grief, a lot of healing and even more adjusting. Julia passed away in September of that year. I didn't expect her death to be as hard on me as it was. It was almost like losing my mother all over again.</p><p>I miss my mother. And I miss Julia. Thank god I have Lake.</p> <p>Like me, my father loved to write. He always used to tell me that writing his daily thoughts down was therapeutic for his soul. Maybe one of the reasons I\u2019ve had such a difficult time adjusting during the past three years is because I didn't take his advice. I assumed slamming a few times a year was enough \u2018therapy\u2019 for me. Maybe I was wrong. I want 2012 to be everything I have planned for it to be...perfect. With all that said (or written, rather) writing is my resolution for 2012. Even if it's just one word a day, I'm going to write it down....get it out of me.</p><p>Part One</p><p>Thursday, January 5th, 2012.</p><p>I registered for classes today. I didn\u2019t get the days I wanted, but I only have two semesters left so it\u2019s getting harder to be picky about my schedule. I\u2019m thinking about applying to local schools for another teaching job after next semester. Hopefully by this time next year I\u2019ll be teaching again. For right now, though...I\u2019m still living off student loans. Luckily my grandparents have been supportive while I work on my Master\u2019s degree. I wouldn\u2019t be able to do it without them, that\u2019s for sure.</p><p>We\u2019re having dinner with Gavin and Eddie tonight. I think I\u2019ll make cheeseburgers. Cheeseburgers sound good. That\u2019s all I really have to say right now...</p><p>Chapter One</p> <p>\u201cIs Layken over here or over there?\u201d Eddie asks, peering her head in the front door.</p><p>\u201cOver there,\u201d I say from the kitchen.</p><p>Is there a sign on my house instructing people not to knock? Of course Lake never knocks anymore, but her comfort here has apparently extended to Eddie as well. Eddie heads across the street to Lake\u2019s house and Gavin walks inside, tapping his knuckles against the front door. It\u2019s not an official knock, but at least he makes an attempt.</p><p>\u201cWhat are we eating?\u201d he asks. He slips his shoes off at the door and makes his way into the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cBurgers.\u201d I hand him a spatula and point to the stove, instructing him to flip the burgers while I pull the fries out of the oven.</p><p>\u201cWill, do you ever notice how we somehow always get stuck cooking?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s probably not a bad thing,\u201d I say as I loosen the fries from the pan. \u201cRemember Eddie\u2019s alfredo?\u201d</p><p>He grimaces when he remembers the alfredo. \u201cGood point,\u201d he says.</p> <p>I call Kel and Caulder into the kitchen to have them set the table. For the past year, since Lake and I have been together, Gavin and Eddie have been eating with us at least twice a week. I finally had to invest in a dining room table because the bar was getting a little too crowded.</p><p>\u201cHey, Gavin,\u201d Kel says. He walks into the kitchen and grabs a stack of cups out of the cabinet.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d Gavin responds. \u201cYou decide where we\u2019re having your party next week?\u201d</p><p>Kel shrugs. \u201cI don\u2019t know. Maybe bowling. Or we could just do something here.\"</p><p>Caulder walks into the kitchen and starts setting places at the table. I glance behind me and notice them setting an extra place.</p><p>\u201cWe expecting company?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cKel invited Kiersten,\u201d Caulder says, teasingly.</p><p>Kiersten moved into a house on our street about a month ago, and Kel seems to have developed a slight crush on her. He won\u2019t admit it, of course. He\u2019s just now about to turn eleven, so Lake and I expected this to happen. Kiersten\u2019s a few months older than him, and a lot taller. Girls hit puberty faster than boys, so maybe he\u2019ll eventually catch up.</p><p>\u201cNext time you guys invite someone else, let me know. Now I need to make another burger.\u201d I walk to the refrigerator and take out one of the extra patties.</p><p>\u201cShe doesn\u2019t eat meat,\u201d Kel says. \u201cShe\u2019s a vegetarian.\u201d</p><p>Figures. I put the meat back inside the fridge. \u201cI don\u2019t have any fake meat. What\u2019s she gonna do? Eat bread?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBread\u2019s fine,\u201d Kiersten says as she walks through the front door...without knocking. \u201cI like bread. French fries, too. I just don\u2019t eat things that are a result of unjustified animal homicides.\u201d</p><p>Kiersten walks to the table and grabs the roll of paper towels and starts tearing them off, laying one beside each plate. Her self-assurance reminds me a little of Eddie.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s she?\u201d Gavin asks, watching Kiersten make herself at home. She\u2019s never eaten with us before, but you wouldn\u2019t know that by how she\u2019s taking command.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s the eleven-year-old neighbor I was telling you about. The one I think is an imposter based on the things that come out of her mouth. I\u2019m beginning to suspect she\u2019s really a tiny adult, posing as a little red headed child.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, the one Kel's crushing on?\u201d Gavin smiles and I can see his wheels turning. He\u2019s already thinking of ways to embarrass Kel at dinner. Tonight should be interesting.</p><p>Gavin and I have become pretty close this past year. It\u2019s good, I guess...considering how close Eddie and Lake are. Kel and Caulder really like them, too. It\u2019s nice. I like the setup we all have. I hope it stays this way.</p><p>Eddie and Lake finally walk in just as we\u2019re all sitting down at the table. Lake has her wet hair pulled up into a knot on top of her head. She\u2019s wearing house shoes, sweat pants and a t-shirt. I love that about her; the fact that she\u2019s so comfortable here. She takes the seat next to mine and leans in and kisses me on the cheek.</p><p>\u201cThanks, Babe. Sorry it took me so long. I was trying to register online for Statistics but the class is full. Guess I\u2019ll have to go sweet talk someone at the admin. office tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy are you taking statistics?\u201d Gavin asks. He grabs the ketchup and squirts it on his plate.</p><p>\u201cI took Algebra II in the Winter mini-mester. I\u2019m trying to knock out all my math in the first year since I hate it so much.\u201d Lake grabs the ketchup out of Gavin\u2019s hands and squirts some on my plate, then on her own.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your hurry? You\u2019ve already got more credits than Eddie and I put together,\u201d he says. Eddie nods in agreement as she takes a bite of her burger.</p><p>Lake nudges her head toward Kel and Caulder. \u201cI\u2019ve already got more kids than you and Eddie put together, too. That\u2019s my hurry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your major?\u201d Kiersten asks Lake.</p><p>Eddie glances toward Kiersten, finally noticing the extra person seated at the table. \u201cWho are you?\u201d</p><p>Kiersten looks at Eddie and smiles. \u201cI\u2019m Kiersten. I live diagonal to Will and Caulder, parallel to Layken and Kel. We moved here from Detroit right before Christmas. Mom says we needed to get out of the city, before the city got out of us...whatever that means. I\u2019m eleven. I\u2019ve been eleven since eleven-eleven-eleven. It was a pretty big day, you know. Not many people can say they turned eleven on eleven-eleven-eleven. I\u2019m a little bummed I was born at three o\u2019clock in the afternoon, though. If I would have been born at 11:11, I\u2019m pretty sure I could have got on the news or something. I could have recorded the segment and used it someday for my portfolio. I\u2019m gonna be an actress when I grow up.\u201d</p><p>Eddie, along with the rest of us, stare at Kiersten without responding. Kiersten is oblivious, turning to Lake to repeat her question. \u201cWhat\u2019s your major, Layken?\u201d</p><p>Lake lays her burger down on her plate and clears her throat. I know how much she hates this question. She tries to answer confidently. \u201cI haven\u2019t decided yet.\u201d</p><p>Kiersten looks at her pitifully. \u201cI see. The proverbial undecided. My oldest brother has been a Sophomore in college for three years. He\u2019s got enough credits to have five majors by now. I think he remains undecided because he\u2019d rather sleep until noon every day, sit in class for three hours and go out every night, than actually graduate and get a real job. Mom says that\u2019s not true...she says it\u2019s because he\u2019s trying to \u2018discover his full potential\u2019 by examining all of his interests. If you ask me, I think it\u2019s bullshit.\u201d</p><p>I cough when the drink I just swallowed tries to make its way back up with my laugh.</p><p>\u201cYou just said bullshit!\u201d Kel says.</p><p>\u201cKel, don\u2019t say bullshit!\u201d Lake says.</p><p>\u201cBut she said bullshit first,\u201d Caulder says, defending Kel.</p><p>\u201cCaulder, don\u2019t say bullshit!\u201d I yell.</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d Kiersten says to Lake and I. \u201cMom says the FCC is responsible for inventing cusswords just for media shock value. She says if everyone would just use them enough, they wouldn\u2019t be considered cusswords anymore and no one would ever be offended by them.\u201d</p><p>This kid is hard to keep up with!</p><p>\u201cYour mother encourages you to cuss?\u201d Gavin says.</p><p>Kiersten nods. \u201cI don\u2019t see it that way. It\u2019s more like she\u2019s encouraging us to undermine a system flawed through overuse of words that are made out to be harmful, when in fact they\u2019re just letters, mixed together like every other word. That\u2019s all they are, mixed up letters. Like, take the word \u2018butterfly\u2019 for example. What if someone decided one day that butterfly is a cussword? People would eventually start using the word butterfly as an insult, and to emphasize things in a negative way. The actual word doesn\u2019t mean anything. It\u2019s the negative association people give these words that make them cusswords. So, if we all just decided to keep saying butterfly all the time, eventually people would stop caring. The shock value would subside...and it would become just another word again. Same with every other so-called bad word. If we would all just start saying them all the time, they wouldn\u2019t be bad anymore. That\u2019s what my mom says, anyway.\u201d She smiles and takes a french fry and dips it in ketchup. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I often wonder when Kiersten\u2019s visiting, how she turned out the way she did. I have yet to actually meet Kiersten\u2019s mother, but from what I\u2019ve gathered, she\u2019s definitely not ordinary. Kiersten is obviously smarter than most kids her age...even if it is in a strange way. The things that come out of her mouth make Kel and Caulder seem somewhat normal.</p><p>\u201cKiersten?\u201d Eddie says. \u201cWill you be my new best friend?\u201d</p><p>Lake grabs a french fry off her plate and throws it at Eddie, hitting her in the face with it. \u201cThat\u2019s bullshit,\u201d Lake says.</p><p>\u201cOh, go butterfly yourself,\u201d Eddie says. She returns a fry in Lake\u2019s direction.</p> <p>I intercept the french fry, hoping this doesn\u2019t result in another food fight like last week. I\u2019m still finding broccoli everywhere. \u201cStop,\u201d I say, dropping the French fry on the table. \u201cIf you two have another food fight in my house tonight, I\u2019m kicking both of your butterflies!\u201d</p><p>Lake can see I\u2019m serious about the food fight. She squeezes my leg under the table and changes the subject. \u201cSuck and sweet time,\u201d she says.</p><p>\u201cSuck and sweet time?\u201d Kiersten asks, confused.</p><p>Kel fills her in. \u201cIt\u2019s where you have to say your suck and your sweet of the day. The good and the bad. The high and the low. We do it every night at supper.\u201d</p><p>Kiersten nods as though she understands.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll go first,\u201d Eddie says. \u201cMy suck today was registration. I got stuck in Monday, Wednesday, Friday classes. Tuesday and Thursdays were full.\u201d</p><p>Everyone wants the Tuesday/Thursday schedules. The classes are longer, but it\u2019s a fair trade only having to go twice a week, rather than three times.</p><p>\u201cMy sweet is meeting Kiersten, my new best friend,\u201d Eddie says, glaring at Lake.</p><p>Lake grabs another french fry and throws it at Eddie. Eddie ducks and the fry goes over her head. I take Lake\u2019s plate from her and scoot it to the other side of me, out of her reach.</p><p>Lake shrugs her shoulders and smiles at me. \u201cSorry.\u201d She grabs a fry off my plate and puts it in her mouth.</p><p>\u201cYour turn, Mr. Cooper,\u201d Eddie says. She stills calls me that occasionally, usually when she\u2019s trying to point out the fact that I\u2019m being a \u201cbore.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMy suck was definitely registration, too. I got Monday, Wednesday, Friday.\u201d</p><p>Lake turns to me, upset. \u201cWhat? I thought we were both doing Tuesday, Thursday classes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI tried, Babe. They don\u2019t offer my level courses on those days. I texted you.\u201d</p><p>She pouts. \u201cMan, that really is a suck,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd I didn\u2019t get your text. I can\u2019t find my phone again.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s always losing her phone.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your sweet?\u201d Eddie asks me.</p><p>That\u2019s easy. \u201cMy sweet is right now,\u201d I say as I kiss Lake on the forehead.</p><p>Kel and Caulder both groan. \u201cWill, that\u2019s your sweet every night,\u201d Caulder says, annoyed.</p> <p>\u201cMy turn,\u201d Lake says. \u201cRegistration was actually my sweet. I haven\u2019t figured out the statistics yet, but my other four classes were exactly what I wanted.\u201d She looks at Eddie and continues. \u201cMy suck was losing my best friend to an eleven-year-old.\u201d</p><p>Eddie laughs.</p><p>\u201cI wanna go,\u201d Kiersten says. No one objects. \u201cMy suck was having bread for dinner,\u201d she says, eyeing her plate.</p><p>She\u2019s ballsy. I toss another slice of bread on her plate. \u201cMaybe next time you show up uninvited to a carnivore\u2019s house, you should bring your own fake meat.\u201d</p><p>She ignores my comment. \u201cMy sweet was three o'clock.\u201d</p><p>\"What happened at three o'clock?\" Gavin asks.</p><p>Kiersten shrugs her shoulders. \"School let out. I butterflying hate school.\"</p><p>All three of the kids glance at each other, almost as if there\u2019s an unspoken agreement between them. I make a mental note to talk to Caulder about it later. Lake nudges me with her elbow and shoots me a questioning glance, letting me know she's thinking the same thing.</p><p>\u201cYour turn, whatever your name is,\u201d Kiersten says to Gavin.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Gavin. And my suck would have to be the fact that an eleven-year-old has a larger vocabulary than me,\u201d he says, smiling at Kiersten. \u201cMy sweet today is sort of a surprise.\u201d He looks at Eddie and waits for her response.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Eddie says.</p><p>\u201cYeah, what?\u201d Lake adds.</p><p>I\u2019m curious, too. Gavin just leans back in his seat with a smile on his face, waiting for us to guess.</p><p>Eddie gives him a shove. \u201cTell us!\u201d she says.</p><p>He leans forward in his chair and slaps his hands on the table. \u201cI got a job! At Getty\u2019s, delivering pizza!\u201d</p><p>He looks happy for some reason.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s your sweet? You\u2019re a pizza delivery guy?\u201d Eddie asks. \u201cThat\u2019s more like a suck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know I\u2019ve been looking for a job. And it\u2019s Getty\u2019s. We love Getty\u2019s!\u201d</p><p>Eddie rolls her eyes. \u201cWell, congratulations,\u201d she says, unconvincingly.</p><p>\u201cDo we get free pizza?\u201d Kel asks.</p><p>\u201cNo, but we get a discount,\u201d Gavin replies.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s my sweet, then,\u201d Kel says. \u201cCheap pizza!\u201d Gavin looks pleased that someone is excited for him. \u201cMy suck today was Mrs. Brill,\u201d Kel says.</p><p>\u201cOh lord, what\u2019d she do?\u201d Lake asks him. \u201cOr better yet, what did you do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t just me,\u201d Kel says.</p><p>Caulder puts his elbow on the table and tries to hide his face from my line of sight.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you do, Caulder?\u201d I ask him. He brings his hand down and looks up at Gavin. Gavin puts his elbow on the table and shields his face from my line of sight as well. He continues to eat as he ignores my glare. \u201cGavin? What prank did you tell them about this time?\u201d</p><p>Gavin grabs two fries and throws them at Kel and Caulder. \u201cNo more! I\u2019m not telling you any more stories. You two get me in trouble every time!\u201d he says. Kel and Caulder laugh and throw the fries back at him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll tell on them, I don\u2019t mind,\u201d Kiersten says. \u201cThey got in trouble at lunch. Mrs. Brill was on the other side of the cafeteria and they were thinking of a way to get her to run. Everyone says she waddles like a duck when she runs, and we wanted to see it. So Kel pretended he was choking and Caulder made a huge spectacle and got behind him and started beating on his back, pretending he was giving him the Heimlich maneuver. It freaked Mrs. Brill out! When she got to our table, Kel said he was all better. He told Mrs. Brill that Caulder saved his life. It would have been fine, but she had already told someone to call 911. Within minutes, two ambulances and a fire truck showed up to the school. One of the boys at the next table told Mrs. Brill they were faking the whole thing, so Kel got called to the office.\u201d</p><p>Lake leans forward and glares at Kel. \u201cPlease tell me this is a joke.\u201d</p><p>Kel looks up at her with an innocent look across his face. \u201cIt was a joke. I really didn\u2019t think anyone would call 911. Now I have to spend all next week in detention.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t Mrs. Brill call me?\u201d Lake asks him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m pretty sure she did,\u201d he says. \u201cYou can\u2019t find your phone, remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUgh! If she calls me in for another conference, you\u2019re grounded!\u201d</p><p>I look at Caulder and he\u2019s attempting to avoid my gaze. \u201cCaulder, what about you? Why didn\u2019t Mrs. Brill try to call me?\u201d</p><p>He turns toward me and gives me a mischievous grin. \u201cKel lied for me. He told her I really thought he was choking and that I was trying to save his life,\u201d he says. \u201cWhich brings me to my sweet for the day. I was rewarded for my heroic behavior. Mrs. Brill gave me two free study hall passes.\u201d</p><p>Only Caulder could find a way to avoid detention and get rewarded instead. \u201cYou two need to cut that crap out,\u201d I say to them. \u201cAnd Gavin, no more prank stories.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Mr. Cooper,\u201d Gavin says sarcastically. \u201cBut I have to know,\u201d he says, looking at the kids. \u201cDoes she really waddle?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Kiersten laughs. \u201cShe\u2019s a waddler, alright.\u201d She looks at Caulder. \u201cWhat was your suck, Caulder?\u201d</p><p>Caulder gets a serious look on his face. \u201cMy best friend almost choked to death today. He could have died.\u201d</p><p>We all laugh. As much as Lake and I try to do the responsible thing by them, sometimes it\u2019s hard to draw the line between being the rule enforcer and being the sibling. We choose which battles to pick with the boys, and Lake says it\u2019s important that we don\u2019t choose very many. I look at her and she\u2019s laughing, so I assume this isn\u2019t one she wants to fight tonight.</p><p>\u201cCan I finish my food now?\u201d Lake says, pointing to her plate that\u2019s still on the other side of me, out of her reach. I scoot the plate back in front of her. \u201cThank you, Mr. Cooper,\u201d she says.</p><p>I knee her under the table. She knows I hate it when she calls me that. I don\u2019t know why it still bothers me so much. Probably because when I actually was her teacher, it was absolute torture. Our connection progressed so quickly that first night I took her out. I\u2019d never met anyone I had so much fun just being myself with. I spent the entire weekend thinking about her. The moment I walked around the corner and saw her standing in the hallway in front of my classroom, it felt like my heart was ripped right out of my chest. I knew immediately what she was doing there, even though it took her a little while longer to figure it out. When she finally realized I was a teacher, the look in her eyes absolutely devastated me. She was hurt. Heartbroken. Just like me. One thing I know for sure, I never want to see that look in her eyes again.</p><p>Kiersten stands up and takes her plate to the sink. \u201cI have to go. Thanks for the bread, Will,\u201d she says sarcastically. \u201cIt was delicious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m leaving, too. I\u2019ll walk you home,\u201d Kel says. He jumps out of his seat and follows her to the door. I look at Lake and she rolls her eyes. It bothers her that Kel has developed his first crush. Lake doesn\u2019t like to think that we\u2019re about to have to deal with teenage hormones.</p><p>Caulder gets up from the table. \u201cI\u2019m gonna watch TV in my room,\u201d he says. \u201cSee you later, Kel. Bye Kiersten.\u201d They both tell him bye as they leave.</p><p>\u201cI really like that girl,\u201d Eddie says after Kiersten leaves. \u201cI hope Kel asks her to be his girlfriend. I hope they grow up and get married and have lots of weird babies. I hope she\u2019s in our family forever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up, Eddie,\u201d Lake says. \u201cHe\u2019s only ten. He\u2019s too young for a girlfriend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really, he\u2019ll be eleven in eight days,\u201d Gavin says. \u201cEleven is the prime age for first girlfriends.\u201d</p><p>Lake takes an entire handful of her fries and throws them toward Gavin\u2019s face.</p><p>I just sigh. She\u2019s impossible to control. \u201cYou\u2019re cleaning up tonight,\u201d I say to her. \u201cYou too,\u201d I say to Eddie. \u201cGavin, let\u2019s go watch some football like real men while the women do their job.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Gavin scoots his glass toward Eddie. \u201cRefill this glass, woman. I\u2019m watching some football.\u201d</p><p>While Eddie and Lake are cleaning the kitchen, I take the opportunity to ask Gavin for a favor. Lake and I haven\u2019t had any alone time in weeks due to always having the boys. I really need alone time with her.</p><p>\u201cDo you think you and Eddie could take Kel and Caulder to a movie tomorrow night?\u201d</p><p>He doesn\u2019t answer right away, which makes me feel guilty for even asking. Maybe they had plans already.</p> <p>\u201cIt depends,\u201d he finally responds. \u201cDo we have to take Kiersten, too?\u201d</p><p>I laugh. \u201cThat\u2019s up to your girl. She\u2019s her new best friend,\u201d I say.</p><p>Gavin rolls his eyes at the thought. \u201cIt\u2019s fine, we had plans to watch a movie anyway. What time? How long do you want us to keep them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t matter. We aren\u2019t going anywhere. I just need a couple of hours alone with Lake. There\u2019s something I need to give her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh... I see,\u201d he says. \u201cJust text me when you\u2019re through \u2018giving it to her,\u2019 and we\u2019ll bring the boys home.\u201d</p> <p>I shake my head at his assumption and laugh. I like Gavin. What I hate, however, is the fact that everything that happens between me and Lake, and he and Eddie...we all seem to know about. That\u2019s the drawback of dating best friends...there are no secrets.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go, Babe.\u201d Eddie says as she pulls Gavin up off the couch. \u201cThanks for supper, Will. Joel wants you guys to come over next weekend. He said he\u2019d make tamales.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t turn down tamales. \u201cWe\u2019re there,\u201d I say.</p><p>After Eddie and Gavin leave, Lake comes to the living room and sits on the couch, curling her legs up under her as she snuggles against me. I put my arm around her and pull her closer.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m bummed,\u201d she says. \u201cI was hoping we\u2019d at least get the same days this semester. We never get any alone time with all these butterflying kids running around.\u201d</p><p>You would think with us living across the street from each other that we would have all the time in the world together. That\u2019s not the case. Last semester she went to school Monday, Wednesday and Friday and I went all five days. Weekends we spent a lot of time doing homework, but mostly stayed busy with Kel and Caulder\u2019s sports. When Julia passed away in September, that put even more on Lake\u2019s plate. It\u2019s been an adjustment, to say the least. The only place we seem to be lacking is actually getting quality alone time. It\u2019s kind of awkward if the boys are at one house to just go to the other house to be alone. They almost always seem to follow us whenever we do.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ll get through it,\u201d I say. \u201cWe always do.\u201d</p><p>She pulls my face toward hers and kisses me. I\u2019ve been kissing her every day for over a year, and it somehow still gets better every time.</p><p>\u201cI better go,\u201d she finally says. \u201cI have to get up early and go to the college to finish registration. I also need to make sure Kel\u2019s not outside making out with Kiersten.\u201d</p><p>We laugh about it now, but in a matter of years it\u2019ll be our reality. We won\u2019t even be twenty-five and we\u2019ll be raising teenagers. It\u2019s a scary thought.</p><p>\u201cHold on, before you leave...what are your plans tomorrow night?\u201d</p><p>She rolls her eyes. \u201cWhat kind of question is that? You\u2019re my plan. You\u2019re always my only plan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. Eddie and Gavin are taking the boys. Meet me at seven?\u201d</p><p>She perks up and smiles. \u201cAre you asking me out on a real, live date?\u201d</p> <p>I nod my head.</p><p>\u201cWell, you suck at it, you know. You always have. Sometimes girls like to be asked and not told.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s trying to play hard to get, which is pointless. I\u2019ve already got her...but I play her game anyway. I kneel down on the floor in front of her and look into her eyes. \u201cLake, will you do me the honor of accompanying me on a date tomorrow night? \u201d</p><p>She leans back into the couch and looks away. \u201cI don\u2019t know, I\u2019m sort of busy,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019ll check my schedule and let you know.\u201d She tries to look put out, but a smile breaks out on her face. She leans forward and hugs me, but I lose my balance and we end up in the floor. I roll her onto her back and she stares up at me and laughs. \u201cFine. Pick me up at seven.\u201d</p><p>I brush her hair out of her eyes and run my finger along the edge of her face. \u201cI love you, Lake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSay it again,\u201d she says.</p><p>I kiss her forehead and repeat what I said. \u201cI love you, Lake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne more time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI.\u201d I kiss her lips. \u201cAnd love.\u201d I kiss them again. \u201cAnd you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you, too.\u201d</p><p>I ease my body on top of hers and interlock fingers with her. I bring her hands above her head and press them into the floor. I lean in as if I\u2019m going to kiss her, but I don\u2019t. I like to tease her when we're in this position. I barely touch my lips to hers until she closes her eyes, then I slowly pull away. She opens her eyes and I smile at her, then lean in again. As soon as her eyes are closed, I pull away again.</p><p>\"Dammit, Will! Butterflying kiss me already!\"</p><p>I release her hands and she grabs my face and pulls my mouth to hers. We continue kissing until we get to the \u2018point of retreat,\u2019 as Lake likes to call it. She climbs out from under me and sits up on her knees as I roll onto my back and remain in the floor. We don\u2019t like to get carried away when we aren\u2019t the only ones in the house. It\u2019s so easy to do. When we catch ourselves taking things too far, one of us always calls retreat.</p><p>Before Julia passed away, we made the mistake of taking things too far, too soon...a crucial mistake on my part. It was just two weeks after we started officially dating and Caulder was staying the night at Kel\u2019s house. Lake and I came back to my place after a movie. We started making out on the couch and one thing led to another...neither of us willing to stop it. We weren\u2019t having sex, but we would have eventually if Julia wouldn\u2019t have walked in when she did. She completely flipped out. We were mortified. She grounded Lake and wouldn\u2019t let me see her for two weeks. I probably apologized a million times in those two weeks.</p><p>She eventually sat us down together and made us swear we would wait at least a year. She made Lake get on the pill, and made me look her in the eyes and give her my word. She wasn\u2019t upset about the fact that her eighteen-year-old daughter almost had sex. Julia was fairly reasonable and knew it would happen eventually. What hurt her was that I was so willing to take that from Lake in such a short time frame, after only two weeks of dating. It made me feel incredibly guilty, so of course I agreed to the promise. She also wanted us to set a good example for Kel and Caulder and made us swear we wouldn\u2019t spend the night at each other\u2019s houses during that timeframe either. After Julia passed away, we\u2019ve stuck to our word. More out of respect for Julia, than anything. Lord knows it\u2019s more than difficult sometimes. A lot of times.</p><p>We haven\u2019t discussed it, but last week was exactly a year since we made that promise to Julia. I don\u2019t want to rush Lake into anything. I want it to be completely up to her, so I haven\u2019t brought it up. Neither has she. But then again, we haven\u2019t really been alone, either.</p><p>\u201cPoint of retreat,\u201d she says and stands up. \u201cI\u2019ll see you tomorrow night. Seven o\u2019clock. Don\u2019t be late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo find your phone and text me goodnight,\u201d I tell her.</p><p>She opens the door and faces me as she backs out of the house, slowly pulling the door shut. \u201cOne more time?\u201d she says.</p><p>\u201cI love you, Lake.\u201d</p><p>Friday, January 6th, 2012</p><p>I\u2019m giving Lake her present in a little while. I\u2019m not even sure what it is, since it\u2019s not something I picked out. I can\u2019t write any more right now, my hands are shaking. How the hell do these dates still make me nervous? I\u2019m so pathetic.</p><p>Chapter 2</p><p>\u201cBoys, no backwards tonight. You know Gavin can\u2019t keep up when you guys talk backwards.\u201d I wave goodbye and shut the door behind them.</p><p>It\u2019s almost seven. I go to the bathroom and brush my teeth, then grab my keys and jacket and head to my car. I can see her watching from the window. She probably doesn\u2019t realize this, but I could always see her watching from the window. Especially in the months before we were officially dating. Every day I would come home and I would see her shadow. It\u2019s what gave me hope that one day we would be able to be together...the fact that she still thought about me. After our fight in the laundry room though, she never watched from the window again. I thought I\u2019d screwed everything up for good.</p><p>I back out of the driveway and straight into hers. I leave the car running and walk around to open the door for her. When I get back inside the car, I get a whiff of her perfume. It\u2019s the vanilla one...my favorite.</p><p>\u201cWhere are we going?\u201d she asks.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll see. It\u2019s a surprise,\u201d I say as I pull out of her driveway. Rather than turn onto the street, I pull up right into my own driveway. I kill the ignition and run around to her side of the car and open the door.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing, Will?\u201d</p><p>I take her hand and pull her out of the car. \u201cWe\u2019re here.\u201d I love the look of confusion on her face, so I spare the details.</p><p>\u201cYou asked me out on a date to your house? I got dressed up, Will! I want to go somewhere.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s whining. I laugh and take her hand and walk her inside. \u201cNo, you made me ask you out on a date. I never said we were going anywhere. I just asked if you had plans.\u201d</p><p>I've already cooked supper so I walk into the kitchen and get our plates. Rather than sit at the table to eat, I take the plates to the coffee table in the living room. She pulls her jacket off and seems a little disappointed. I continue to elude her while I make our drinks, then take a seat in the floor with her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not trying to seem ungrateful,\u201d she says with a mouthful of pasta. \u201cIt\u2019s just that we never get to go anywhere anymore. I was looking forward to doing something different.\u201d</p><p>I take a drink and wipe my mouth. \u201cBabe, I know what you mean. But tonight has sort of already been planned out for us.\u201d I toss another breadstick on her plate.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean planned out for us? I\u2019m not following,\u201d she says.</p><p>I don\u2019t respond. I just continue eating.</p><p>\u201cWill, just tell me what\u2019s going on, your evasiveness is making me nervous.\u201d</p><p>I grin at her and take a drink. \u201cI\u2019m not trying to make you nervous. I\u2019m just doing what I was told.\u201d</p><p>She can tell I\u2019m enjoying this. She gives up trying to get anything out of me and takes another bite of her food. \u201cThe pasta\u2019s good, at least,\u201d she says.</p><p>\u201cSo is the view.\u201d</p><p>She smiles and winks at me and continues to eat.</p><p>She's wearing her hair down tonight. I love it when she wears her hair down. I also love it when she wears it up. In fact, I don't think she's ever worn it in a way that made me not love it. She\u2019s so incredibly beautiful...especially when she\u2019s not trying to be. I realize I\u2019ve been staring at her, lost in thought. I've barely eaten half my food and she's almost finished. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWill?\u201d She finishes her last bite of food then wipes her mouth with her napkin. \u201cDoes this have anything to do with my mom?\u201d she asks quietly. \u201cYou know...with our promise to her?\u201d</p><p>I know what she\u2019s asking me. I immediately feel guilty that I haven\u2019t thought about what she would think my intentions were tonight. I don\u2019t want her to feel like I expect anything at all from her.</p><p>\u201cNot in that way, Babe.\u201d I reach across and take her hand. \u201cThat\u2019s not what tonight\u2019s about. I\u2019m sorry if you thought that. That\u2019s for another time...when you\u2019re ready.\u201d</p><p>She smiles at me. \u201cWell, I wasn\u2019t gonna object if it was,\u201d she says.</p> <p>Her comment catches me off guard. I\u2019ve gotten so used to the fact that one of us always calls retreat; I haven't really entertained the possibility of the alternative tonight.</p><p>She looks embarrassed by her forwardness and diverts her attention back down to her plate. She tears off a piece of bread and dips it in the sauce. When she\u2019s finished eating, she takes a drink and looks back up at me.</p><p>\u201cBefore,\u201d she whispers unsteadily. \u201cWhen I asked if this had anything to do with my mom, you said \u2018not in that way.\u2019 What\u2019d you mean by that? Are you saying tonight has something to do with her in a different way?\u201d</p><p>I nod, then stand up and take her hand and pull her up. I wrap my arms around her and she leans against my chest and clasps her hands behind my back. \u201cIt does have to do with her, Babe.\u201d She pulls her face away from my chest and looks up at me while I explain. \u201cShe gave me something else...besides the letters.\u201d</p><p>Julia made me promise not to tell her about the letters and the gift until it was time to give them to her. They\u2019ve already opened the letters; the gift was meant for Lake and I. It was intended to be a Christmas gift for us to open together, but this is the first chance we\u2019ve had to be alone.</p> <p>\u201cCome to my bedroom.\u201d I release my hold and grab her hand. She follows behind me until we get to my room where the box Julia gave me is sitting on the bed. Lake walks over to it and runs her hand across the wrapping paper. She fingers the red velvet bow and sighs.</p><p>\u201cIs it really from her?\u201d she asks quietly.</p><p>I sit on the bed and motion for her to sit with me. We pull our legs up and sit with the gift between us. There's a card taped to the top of it with our names on it; along with clear instructions not to read the card until after we open the gift.</p><p>\u201cWill, why didn\u2019t you tell me there was something else? Is this the last one?\u201d I can see the tears forming in her eyes. She always tries so hard to conceal them. I don\u2019t know why she hates it so much when she cries. I run my finger across her cheek and wipe away a tear.</p><p>\u201cLast one, I swear,\u201d I say. \u201cShe wanted us to open it together.\u201d</p><p>She straightens up and does her best to regain her composure. \u201cDo you want to do the honors, or should I?\u201d she asks.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s a dumb question,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no such thing as a dumb question,\u201d she says. \u201cYou should know that, Mr. Cooper.\u201d She leans forward and kisses me, then pulls back and starts to loosen the edge of the package. I watch as she tears it open, revealing a cardboard box wrapped in duct tape.</p><p>\u201cMy god, there has to be six layers of duct tape on here,\u201d she says sarcastically. \u201cKind of like your car.\u201d She looks up and gives me a sly grin.</p><p>\u201cFunny,\u201d I say.</p><p>I stroke her knee and watch her poke through the tape with her thumbnail. Just when she breaks through the final edge, she pauses.</p><p>\u201cThank you for doing this for her,\u201d she says. \u201cFor keeping the gift.\u201d She looks back down at it and holds it without opening it. \u201cDo you know what it is?\u201d she asks.</p><p>\u201cNo clue. I\u2019m hoping it\u2019s not a puppy-it\u2019s been under my bed for four months.\u201d</p><p>She laughs. \u201cI\u2019m nervous,\u201d she says. \u201cI really don\u2019t want to cry again.\u201d She hesitates before she finally opens the top of the box and folds the flaps back. She pulls the contents out of the box as I pull the cardboard away from it. She tears the tissue away and reveals a clear glass vase. Inside the vase, it\u2019s full to the brim with geometrical stars in a variety of colors. It looks like origami. Hundreds of thumbnail sized 3-D paper stars.</p> <p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d I ask her.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, but it\u2019s beautiful,\u201d she says. We continue to stare at it, trying to make sense of the gift and the contents inside of it. She opens the card and looks at it. \u201cI can\u2019t read it, Will. You\u2019ll have to read it.\u201d She places it into my hands.</p><p>I open it and read it aloud.</p><p>Will and Lake,</p><p>Love is the most beautiful thing in the world. Unfortunately, it\u2019s also one of the hardest things in the world to hold on to, and one of the easiest things to throw away.</p><p>Neither of you has a mother or a father to go to for relationship advice anymore. Neither of you has anyone to go to for a shoulder to cry on when things get tough, and they will get tough. Neither of you has someone to go to when you just want to share the funny, or the happy, or the heartache. You are both at a disadvantage when it comes to this aspect of love. You both only have each other, and because of this, you will have to work harder at building a strong foundation for your future together. You are not only each other\u2019s love; you are also one another\u2019s sole confidant.</p><p>I hand wrote some things onto strips of paper and folded them into stars. It might be an inspirational quote, an inspiring lyric, or just some downright good parental advice. I don\u2019t want you to open one and read it until you truly feel you need it. If you have a bad day, if the two of you fight, or if you just need something to lift your spirits...that\u2019s what these are for. You can open one together; you can open one alone. I just want there to be something both of you can go to, if and when you ever need it.</p><p>Will...thank you. Thank you for coming into our lives. So much of the pain and worry I\u2019ve been feeling has been alleviated by the mere fact that I know my daughter is loved by you.</p><p>Lake takes my hand when I come to a pause. I wasn\u2019t expecting Julia to address me personally. She wipes away a tear from her eyes. I do my best to fight back my own tears. I take a deep breath and clear my throat, then finish reading the letter.</p><p>You are a wonderful man, and you\u2019ve been a wonderful friend to me. I thank you from the bottom of my heart for loving my daughter like you do. You respect her, you don\u2019t need to change for her, and you inspire her. You can never know how grateful I have been for you, and how much peace you have brought my soul.</p><p>And Lake; this is me-nudging your shoulder, giving you my approval. You couldn\u2019t have picked anyone better to love if I would have hand-picked him myself. Also, thank you for being so determined to keep our family together. You were right about Kel needing to be with you. Thank you for helping me see that. And remember, when things get tough for him, please teach him how to stop carving pumpkins...</p><p>I love you both and wish you a lifetime of happiness together.</p><p>-Julia</p><p>\u201cAnd all around my memories, you dance...\u201d ~The Avett Brothers</p><p>I put the card back inside the envelope and watch as Lake rubs her hands across the glass, spinning it around to view it from all angles. \u201cI saw her making these once. When I walked into her room, she was folding strips of paper up and she stopped and put it aside as we talked. I forgot about it. I forgot all about it. This must have taken her forever.\u201d</p><p>She stares at the stars and I stare at her. She wipes more tears from her eyes with the back of her hand. She\u2019s holding it together well, all things considered.</p><p>\u201cI want to read them all, but at the same time I hope we never need to read them at all,\u201d she says.</p><p>I lean forward and give her a quick kiss. \u201cYou are as amazing as your mother.\u201d I take the vase out of her hands and walk it to the dresser and set it down. Lake takes the box and shoves the wrapping paper inside and sets it on the floor. She puts the card on the table, and then lies back on the bed. I lie down beside her, turn toward her and rest my arm over her waist. \u201cYou okay?\u201d I ask her. I can\u2019t tell if she\u2019s sad.</p><p>She looks at me and smiles. \u201cI thought it would hurt to hear her words again, but it didn\u2019t. It actually made me happy,\u201d she says.</p><p>\u201cMe too,\u201d I say. \u201cI was really worried it was a puppy.\u201d</p><p>She laughs and lays her head on my arm. We lay there in silence watching each other. I run my hand up her arm and trace her face and neck with my fingertips. I love watching her think.</p><p>She eventually lifts her head off my arm and slides on top of me, placing her hands on the back of my neck. She leans in and slowly parts my lips with hers. I become quickly consumed by the taste of her lips and the feel of her warm hands. I wrap my arms around her and run my fingers through her hair as I return her kiss. It\u2019s been so long since we\u2019ve been alone together without the possibility of being interrupted. I hate being in this predicament-but then again I love being in this predicament. Her skin is so soft, her lips are perfect. It gets harder and harder to retreat every time.</p><p>She runs her hands underneath my shirt and lightly teases my neck with her mouth. She knows this drives me crazy, yet she\u2019s been doing it more and more lately. I think she likes pushing her boundaries. One of us needs to retreat...and I don't know if I can bring myself to do it. Apparently, neither can she.</p><p>\u201cHow much time do we have?\u201d she whispers. She lifts up my shirt and her lips make their way down to my chest.</p><p>\u201cTime?\u201d I say weakly.</p><p>\u201cUntil the boys get home.\u201d She slowly kisses her way back up to my neck again. \u201cHow long do we have until they get home?\u201d She brings her face back to mine and looks at me. I can see by the look in her eyes that she\u2019s telling me she\u2019s not retreating.</p><p>I bring my arm over my face and cover my eyes. I try to talk myself down. This isn\u2019t how I want it to be for her. Think about something else, Will. Think about college, homework, puppies in cardboard boxes...anything.</p><p>She pulls my arm away from my face so she can look me in the eyes. \u201cWill...it\u2019s been a year. I want to.\u201d</p><p>I roll her onto her back and prop my head up on my elbow and lean in toward her, stroking her face with my other hand. \u201cLake, believe me...I\u2019m ready, too. But not here. Not right now. You\u2019ll just have to go home in an hour when the boys get back and I don\u2019t think I could take it.\u201d I kiss her on the forehead. \u201cIn two weeks we get a three day weekend...we\u2019ll go away together. Just the two of us. I\u2019ll see if my grandparents will watch the boys and we can spend the whole weekend together.\u201d</p><p>She kicks her legs up and down on the bed, frustrated. \u201cI can\u2019t wait two more weeks! We\u2019ve been waiting fifty-seven weeks already!\u201d</p><p>I laugh at her childishness and lean in, planting a kiss on her cheek. \u201cIf I can wait, you can definitely wait,\u201d I assure her.</p><p>She rolls her eyes. \u201cGod, you\u2019re such a bore,\u201d she teases.</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m a bore?\u201d I say. \u201cYou want me to throw you in the shower again? Cool you off? I will if that\u2019s what you need.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOnly if you get in with me,\u201d she says. Her eyes grow wide and she sits up and pushes me flat on my back, leaning over me. \u201cWill!\u201d she says excitedly as a new realization dawns on her. \u201cDoes that mean we can take showers together? On our getaway?\u201d</p><p>Her eagerness surprises me. Everything she does surprises me. \u201cYou aren\u2019t nervous?\u201d I ask her.</p><p>\u201cNo, not at all.\u201d She smiles and leans in closer. \u201cI know I\u2019ll be in good hands.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou will definitely be in good hands,\u201d I say, pulling her to me. Just when I\u2019m about to kiss her again, my phone vibrates. She reaches into my pocket and pulls it out.</p> <p>\u201cGavin,\u201d she says. She hands the phone to me and rolls off.</p><p>I read the text. \u201cGreat, Kel threw up. They think he has a stomach bug so they\u2019re bringing them home.\u201d</p><p>She groans and gets off the bed. \u201cUgh! I hate vomit! Caulder\u2019s probably gonna get it too-the way they pass crap back and forth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll text him back and tell him to take Kel to your house. You go home and wait-I\u2019ll run to the store and get him some medicine.\u201d I pull my shirt back on and grab the vase that Julia made us so that I can put it on the bookshelf in the living room. We exit the bedroom in parent mode.</p><p>\u201cGet some soup, too. For tomorrow. And some sprite,\u201d she says.</p> <p>When I set the vase down in the living room, she reaches her hand inside and grabs a star. She sees me eyeing her and she grins. \u201cThere might be a good tip in here. For vomit,\u201d she says.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got a long road ahead of us, you better not waste those.\u201d When we walk outside, I grab her arm and pull her to me and hug her goodnight. \u201cYou want me to drive you home?\u201d</p><p>She laughs and hugs me back. \u201cThanks for my date. It was one of my favorites.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe best is yet to come,\u201d I say, hinting at our upcoming getaway.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m holding you to that.\u201d She backs away and starts walking toward her house. I turn to the car and open the door when she yells from across the street.</p><p>\u201cWill! One more time?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI love you, Lake!\u201d</p><p>January 7th, 2012</p><p>I butterflying hate cheeseburgers.</p><p>Chapter 3</p><p>Hell. Pure hell is the best way I can describe the last twenty-four hours. By the time Gavin and Eddie made it home with the boys, it was apparent that Kel didn\u2019t have a stomach bug after all. Gavin didn\u2019t knock when he ran through the front door and headed straight for the bathroom. Caulder was next, then Lake and Eddie. I was the last to feel the effects of the food poisoning. Caulder and I have done nothing but lay on the couch, taking turns in the bathroom since midnight last night.</p><p>I can\u2019t help but envy Kiersten. I should have just had bread, too. About the time that thought crosses my mind, there\u2019s a knock at the front door. I don\u2019t get up. I don\u2019t even speak. No one I know extends me the courtesy of knocking, so I don\u2019t know who could be at the door. I guess I won\u2019t find out, either...because I\u2019m not moving.</p><p>I\u2019m lying on the couch facing away from the door, but I hear it slowly open and can feel the cold air circulate as a female voice I don\u2019t recognize calls my name.</p><p>\u201cWill?\u201d</p> <p>I still don\u2019t care who it is. At this point, I\u2019m wishing it was someone here to finish me off...put me out of my misery. It takes all the energy I have to just raise my hand in the air to let whoever it is know that I\u2019m here.</p><p>\u201cOh, you poor thing,\u201d she says. She shuts the door behind her and walks around to the front of the couch and stares down at me. I glance up at her and realize I have absolutely no idea who this woman is. She\u2019s probably in her forties...her short black hair is traced with grey. She\u2019s petite, shorter than Lake. I try to smile, but I don\u2019t think I do. She frowns and glances over to Caulder, who is passed out on the other couch. I notice a bottle between her hands when she passes through the living room and walks into the kitchen. I hear her opening drawers, and she comes back with a spoon.</p><p>\u201cThis will help. Layken said you guys were sick, too.\u201d She pours some of the liquid into a spoon and bends down, handing the spoon to me.</p><p>I take it. I\u2019ll take anything at this point. I swallow the medicine and cough when it burns the inside of my throat. I reach for a glass of water and take a sip. I don\u2019t want to drink too much, it\u2019s just been coming right back up. \u201cWhat the hell is that?\u201d I ask.</p><p>She looks disappointed at my reaction. \u201cI made it. I make my own medicine. It\u2019ll help, I promise.\u201d She walks over to Caulder and shakes him awake. He accepts the medicine as I did without question, then closes his eyes again.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Sherry, by the way. Kiersten\u2019s mother.\u201d</p><p>That explains it.</p><p>\u201cShe said you guys ate some rancid meat.\u201d She makes a face when she says the word \u2018meat.\u2019</p><p>I don\u2019t want to think about it, so I close my eyes and try to put the thought out of my mind. I guess she sees the nausea building behind my expression, because she apologizes.</p><p>\u201cSorry. This is why we\u2019re vegetarian.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Sherry,\u201d I say, hoping she\u2019s finished. She\u2019s not.</p><p>\u201cI started a load of laundry over at Layken\u2019s house. If you want, I\u2019ll wash some of yours too.\u201d She doesn\u2019t wait for me to respond. She walks down the hallway and starts gathering clothes, then takes them into the laundry room. I hear the washer start, followed by noise in the kitchen. She\u2019s cleaning. This woman I don\u2019t know is cleaning my house. I\u2019m too tired to object. I\u2019m even too tired to be pleased about it.</p><p>\u201cWill?\u201d She walks back through the living room. I open my eyes, but barely. \u201cI\u2019ll be back in an hour to put the clothes in the dryer. I\u2019ll bring some minestrone, too.\u201d</p><p>I just nod. Or, at least I think I nod.</p><p>It hasn\u2019t been an hour yet, but whatever Sherry gave me already has me feeling a little better. Caulder manages to make it to his room and passes out on his bed. I walk to the kitchen and make myself a glass of sprite when the front door opens. It\u2019s Lake. She looks as rough as I do, but still beautiful.</p><p>\u201cHey, Babe.\u201d She shuffles into the kitchen and wraps her arms around me. She\u2019s in her pajamas and house shoes. It\u2019s not the darth vader ones, but still just as sexy.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s Caulder feeling?\u201d she says.</p><p>\u201cBetter, I guess. Whatever Sherry gave us worked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, it did.\u201d She rests her head against my chest and takes a deep breath. \u201cI wish we had enough couches in one house, so we could all be sick together.\u201d</p><p>We\u2019ve brought up the subject of living together before. It makes economic sense; our bills would be cut in half. She\u2019s only nineteen, though...and she seems to like having her alone time. The thought of taking such a huge leap makes us both a little apprehensive, so we agreed to wait on that step until we\u2019re certain about it.</p><p>\u201cI wish we did too,\u201d I say. I naturally lean in to kiss her, but she shakes her head and backs her face away from mine.</p><p>\u201cNuh-uh,\u201d she says. \u201cWe\u2019re not kissing for at least twenty-four more hours.\u201d</p><p>I laugh and kiss her on top of her head instead.</p><p>\u201cI guess I\u2019ll go back now. I just wanted to check on you.\u201d She avoids my face and kisses me on the arm instead.</p><p>\u201cYou two are so cute!\u201d Sherry says. She walks through the dining room and places a container of soup in the fridge, then turns and heads into the laundry room. I never even heard her open the front door...much less knock.</p><p>\u201cThanks for the medicine, Sherry. It really helped,\u201d Lake says.</p><p>\u201cNo problem,\u201d Sherry says. \u201cThat concoction can knock the shit out of anything. You two let me know if you need more.\u201d</p><p>Lake looks at me and rolls her eyes. \u201cSee you, Babe. Love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLove you, too. Let me know when Kel feels better, we\u2019ll come over tonight.\u201d</p><p>Lake leaves and I take a seat at the table and slowly sip my drink. I still don\u2019t trust ingesting anything at this point.</p><p>Sherry pulls out the chair across the table from me and takes a seat. \u201cSo, what\u2019s your story?\u201d she asks.</p><p>I\u2019m not sure what story she\u2019s referring to, so I raise my eyebrows at her as I take another sip and wait for her to elaborate.</p><p>\u201cWith the two of you. And Kel and Caulder. It\u2019s a little strange from a mother\u2019s point of view. I\u2019ve got an eleven year old daughter who seems to enjoy spending time with all you guys, I feel it\u2019s my duty as a mom to know your story. You and Lake are both practically children, raising children.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s very blunt. However, the way she says it comes off as appropriate, somehow. She\u2019s easy to like. I see now why Kiersten is the way she is.</p><p>I set my sprite down on the table in front of me and wipe the condensation off the glass with my thumbs. \u201cMy parents died three years ago.\u201d I continue to stare at the glass in front of me, avoiding her gaze. I don\u2019t want to see the pity in her eyes. \u201cLake\u2019s father died over a year ago...her mother passed away in September. So...here we are, raising our brothers.\u201d</p><p>Sherry leans back into her chair and folds her arms across her chest. \u201cI\u2019ll be damned.\u201d</p><p>I just nod and give her a half smile. At least she didn\u2019t say how sorry she was for us. I hate pity more than anything.</p><p>\u201cHow long have the two of you been dating?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOfficially? Since December eighteenth, a little over a year ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about unofficially?\u201d she says.</p><p>I shift in my seat. Why did I even specify officially?</p><p>\u201cDecember eighteenth, a little over a year ago,\u201d I say again and smile. I\u2019m not getting any more detailed than that. \u201cWhat\u2019s your story, Sherry?\u201d</p><p>She laughs and stands up. \u201cWill, has anyone ever told you it\u2019s rude to be nosey?\u201d She makes her way to the front door. \u201cLet me know if you need anything. You know where we live.\u201d</p><p>We spend the entire day Sunday watching movies and being sore. We're all still a little queasy, so we skip the junk food. Monday it's back to reality. I drop Kel and Caulder off at their school and head to the College. Three of my four classes are in the same building; one of the benefits of being in grad school. Once your course of study is set, all the classes are similar and are usually taught in the same area. The first of my four classes, however, is halfway across campus. It\u2019s a graduate level elective called Death and Dying. I thought it would be interesting, being as though I\u2019m more than experienced in the subject. I also didn\u2019t have a choice. There wasn\u2019t another graduate elective during the eight o\u2019clock block that I could take, so I\u2019m stuck with this one if I want all my credits to count. When I walk in, students are sporadically seated around the room. It\u2019s one of the auditorium style rooms set up with tables that hold two seats each. I walk up the stairs and take a seat in the back of the room. It\u2019s different, being the student now rather than the teacher. I got so used to being at the head of the classroom. The role reversal has taken some getting used to. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The class fills up fairly quickly. It\u2019s the first day of the semester, so it will probably be the only day people actually show up early. That\u2019s usually how it is...the newness wears off by day two. It\u2019s rare for a professor to have everyone on their entire roll show up the same day after day two.</p><p>I throw my stuff on the table and take a seat. My phone vibrates inside my pocket so I take it out and slide my finger across the screen. It\u2019s a text from Lake.</p><p>Finally found my phone. Hope you like your classes. I love you and I\u2019ll see you tonight.</p><p>I begin to text her back when the professor starts calling roll. I finish the text and press the send button and put my phone back in my pocket.</p> <p>\u201cWill Cooper?\u201d the professor says. I raise my hand and he looks up at me and nods, then marks his form.</p><p>He continues to call roll as I glance around the room to see if I recognize anyone. There were a couple of people I graduated High School with in my last semester elective. There usually aren\u2019t many people I know in my classes since I\u2019m a little ahead. Most of my high school classmates graduated college last May, and not many of them decided on Grad school. As my eyes make their way around the room, I notice a girl with blond hair in the front row turned completely around in her seat. When I meet her gaze, my heart sinks. She smiles and waves when she sees I\u2019ve recognized her. She turns back around and gathers her things, then stands up and makes her way up the stairs.</p><p>No. She\u2019s coming toward me. She\u2019s about to sit with me. Oh, god.</p><p>\u201cWill! Oh my god, what are the chances? It\u2019s been so long,\u201d she says.</p><p>I do my best to smile at her. I don\u2019t understand my reaction right now. I can\u2019t tell if it\u2019s anger, guilt, or what. \u201cHey, Vaughn.\u201d I try to sound pleased to see her.</p> <p>She takes the seat next to me and leans in and hugs me. \u201cHow are you?\u201d she whispers. \u201cHow\u2019s Caulder?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s good,\u201d I say. \u201cGrowing up. He\u2019ll be eleven in two months.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEleven? Wow,\u201d she says, shaking her head in disbelief.</p><p>We haven\u2019t seen each other in almost three years. She knows we parted on bad terms, to put it mildly; yet, she\u2019s acting like she\u2019s genuinely excited to see me. I wish I could say the same.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s Ethan?\u201d I ask her. Ethan is her older brother. We were pretty good friends while Vaughn and I dated, but we haven\u2019t spoken since the break-up.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s good. He\u2019s really good. He\u2019s married now, they\u2019ve got a baby on the way.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGood for him. Tell him I said so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will,\u201d she says.</p><p>\u201cVaughn Gibson?\u201d The professor calls.</p><p>She raises her hand. \u201cUp here,\u201d she says as he marks her on his roll. She brings her attention back to me. \u201cWhat about you? You married?\u201d</p><p>I shake my head.</p><p>\u201cMe neither,\u201d she smiles.</p><p>I don\u2019t like this. I don\u2019t like how she\u2019s looking at me-I\u2019ve seen that look from her before. We dated for over two years, I know her pretty well. And right now, her intentions aren\u2019t good for me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not married, but I am dating someone,\u201d I clarify. I can see the slight shift in her expression, but she attempts to mask it with a smile.</p> <p>\u201cGood for you,\u201d she says. \u201cIs it serious?\u201d She\u2019s digging for hints.</p><p>\u201cVery.\u201d</p><p>We both face the front of the room when the professor starts explaining the semester requirements and going over the syllabus. The rest of the hour, we don\u2019t speak much other than occasional questions from her regarding the class information. When the professor dismisses us, I quickly stand up.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s really good seeing you, Will,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m excited about this class now. We have a lot of catching up to do.\u201d</p><p>I smile at her without agreeing. She gives me another quick hug and turns away. I gather my things and head to my second class as I think of a way to break this to Lake.</p><p>Lake has never asked about my past relationships. She says there isn\u2019t anything good that can come up from discussing it, so we never have. I\u2019m not even sure she knows about Vaughn. She knows I had a pretty serious relationship in high school. She even knows I\u2019ve had sex-we talked about that. I don\u2019t know how she\u2019ll take this. I\u2019d hate to upset her, but I also don\u2019t want to hide anything either.</p><p>But what would I be hiding? Is it really necessary to tell her who all the students are in the classes I\u2019m in? We\u2019ve never discussed it before, so why do I feel the need to now? If I tell her, it will just cause her to worry unnecessarily. If I don\u2019t tell her, what harm is it doing? Lake\u2019s not in my class, she\u2019s not even in school the days I am. I\u2019ve made it clear to Vaughn that I\u2019m in a relationship...that should be good enough.</p><p>By the end of my last class, I\u2019ve successfully convinced myself that Lake doesn\u2019t need to know.</p><p>When I pull up to the elementary school, Kel and Caulder are seated outside on a bench, away from the rest of the students. Mrs. Brill is standing right behind them, waiting.</p><p>\u201cGreat,\u201d I mumble to myself. I\u2019ve heard the horror stories about her, but I\u2019ve never actually had to deal with her. I kill the engine and get out; it\u2019s obvious that\u2019s what she\u2019s expecting me to do.</p><p>\u201cYou must be Will,\u201d she says as she extends her hand. \u201cWe\u2019ve met before, just not officially I believe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood to meet you.\u201d I glance to the boys who aren't making eye contact with me. When I look back at Mrs. Brill, she nods her head to the left, indicating she would like to talk to me out of their earshot.</p><p>\u201cThere was an incident with Kel last week in the cafeteria,\u201d Mrs. Brill says as we walk down the sidewalk, away from the crowd. \u201cI\u2019m not sure what the relationship is between Kel and yourself, but I wasn\u2019t able to get in touch with his sister.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re aware of what happened,\u201d I say. \u201cLayken misplaced her phone. Do I need to let her know to contact you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, that isn\u2019t why I want to talk to you,\u201d she says. \u201cI just wanted to be sure both of you were aware of last week\u2019s incident first, and that it was handled appropriately.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was. We took care of it,\u201d I say. I don\u2019t know what she means by \u2018handled appropriately,\u2019 but I doubt she expects that their punishment was laughing about it at the dinner table. Oh, well.</p><p>\u201cI wanted to talk to you about a different matter. There\u2019s a new student here, she seems to have taken to Kel and Caulder. Kiersten?\u201d She waits on me to acknowledge that I know who she\u2019s referring to. I nod. \u201cThere was an incident today that involved her and a few of the other students,\u201d she says.</p><p>I stop walking and turn toward her, suddenly becoming more vested in our conversation. If it has anything to do with how the three kids acted at the dinner table the other night, I want to know about it.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s being picked on. Some of the other students find her personality doesn\u2019t mesh well with their own, I guess. Kel and Caulder found out about a couple of the older boys saying some things to her, so they decided to take matters into their own hands.\u201d She pauses and glances back at Kel and Caulder, who are still seated in the same positions.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019d they do?\u201d I ask nervously.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not what they did, really. It\u2019s what they said....in a note.\u201d She takes a piece of paper out of her pocket and hands it to me.</p><p>I unfold it and look at it. My mouth gapes open. It\u2019s a picture of a bloody knife with the words \u201cYou will die, asswipe!\u201d written across the top of it.</p><p>\u201cKel and Caulder wrote this?\u201d I ask, embarrassed.</p><p>She nods. \u201cThey\u2019ve already admitted to it. I understand you\u2019re a teacher, so you know the significance of these kinds of threats on campus. It can\u2019t be taken lightly, Will. I hope you understand. They\u2019ll be suspended for the rest of the week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuspended? For an entire week? But they were defending someone who was being bullied.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand that-and those boys have been punished as well. But I can\u2019t condone bad behavior in the defense of more bad behavior.\u201d</p><p>I understand where she\u2019s coming from. I look down at the note again and sigh. \u201cI\u2019ll let Lake know. Is there anything else? They\u2019re free to come back on Monday?\u201d</p><p>She nods. I tell her thank you and walk back to the car and climb inside. The boys both climb into the backseat and we drive home in silence. I\u2019m too pissed at them to say anything right now. Or at least I think I\u2019m pissed. I\u2019m supposed to be, right?</p><p>Lake is seated at the bar when I walk through her front door. Kel and Caulder walk in behind me and I sternly instruct them to take a seat. Lake shoots me a confused look when I walk through the living room and motion for her to follow me to her bedroom. I shut the door behind us for privacy and explain everything that happened, showing her the note.</p><p>She stares at it for a while, then covers her mouth and tries to hide her laugh. She thinks it\u2019s funny. I feel relieved, because this was my initial reaction, too. When we make eye contact, we both start laughing.</p><p>\u201cI know, Lake! From a sibling standpoint it\u2019s really funny,\u201d I say. \u201cBut what are we supposed to do from a parent standpoint?\u201d</p><p>She shakes her head. \u201cI don\u2019t know. I\u2019m sort of proud of them for taking up for Kiersten.\" She sits down on her bed and throws the note aside. \u201cPoor Kiersten, though.\u201d</p><p>I sit down on the bed beside her. \u201cWell, we have to act mad. They really can\u2019t do crap like this.\u201d</p><p>Lake nods in agreement. \u201cWhat do you think their punishment should be?\u201d</p><p>I shrug my shoulders. \u201cI don\u2019t know. Being suspended seems kind of like a reward. What kid wouldn\u2019t want to get a week off school?\u201d We both think for a while. Neither of us comes up with any good punishments.</p><p>\u201cI guess it\u2019s a good thing we have different schedules this semester,\u201d she says. \u201cThat way, every time they get suspended, at least one of us will be home.\u201d</p><p>I smile at her...and hope she\u2019s wrong. This better be their first and last suspension. Lake doesn\u2019t know it, but she\u2019s made things with Caulder so much easier. Before I met her, I agonized over every single parenting decision I ever had to make. Now that we make a lot of those choices together, I\u2019m not as hard on myself. We seem to agree on most aspects of how the boys should be raised. It also doesn\u2019t hurt having her maternal instincts in the picture now. It\u2019s moments like these, when we're made to join forces, that it\u2019s almost unbearable for me to take things slow. If I left my head out of it and just followed my heart, I\u2019d marry her today.</p><p>I push her back on the bed and kiss her. Due to the weekend from hell, I haven\u2019t been able to kiss her since Friday. I\u2019ve missed kissing her. From the way she kisses me back, it\u2019s obvious she\u2019s missed kissing me, too.</p><p>\u201cHave you talked to your grandparents about next weekend?\u201d she asks.</p><p>My lips move from her mouth, down her cheek and to her ear. \u201cI\u2019ll call them tonight,\u201d I whisper. \u201cHave you thought about where you want to go?\u201d Chills break out on her skin, so I continue kissing down her neck. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI could care less. We could stay here at my house for all I care. I\u2019m just looking forward to being with you for three whole days. And finally getting to spend the night together...in the same bed, at least.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m trying not to come off too eager, but next weekend is all I\u2019ve been thinking about. She doesn\u2019t need to know that I\u2019ve actually got an internal countdown going constantly. Ten days and twenty-one more hours.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t we do that?\u201d I stop kissing her neck and look at her. \u201cLet\u2019s just stay here. Kel and Caulder will be in Detroit. We can lie to Eddie and Gavin and tell them we\u2019re going away so they won\u2019t stop by. We\u2019ll pull the shades down and lock the doors and hole ourselves up for three whole days, right here in this bed. And in the shower too, of course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds bemazing,\u201d she says. She likes to smoosh words together for more emphasis. I\u2019m pretty sure bemazing is beautiful and amazing. I think it\u2019s cute.</p> <p>\u201cNow back to the punishment,\u201d she says. \u201cWhat would our parents do?\u201d</p><p>I honestly have no clue what my parents would do. If I had any clue, it wouldn\u2019t be so hard coming up with solutions to all the problems that come along with raising kids.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what they would do. But I know what I want to do,\u201d I say. \u201cLet\u2019s scare the butterfly out of them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d she says.</p><p>\u201cAct like you\u2019re trying to calm me down. Act like I\u2019m really pissed off. We can make them sit out there and sweat for a while.\u201d</p> <p>She laughs. \u201cYou\u2019re so bad.\u201d She stands up and walks closer to the door. \u201cWill! Calm down!\u201d she yells.</p><p>I walk over to the door and hit it for extra emphasis. \u201cI will not calm down! I\u2019m PISSED!\u201d</p><p>Lake throws herself onto the bed and pulls a pillow over her face to stifle her giggles before she continues yelling. \u201cNo, stop it! You can\u2019t go out there yet! You need to calm down, Will! You might KILL them!\u201d</p><p>I glare at her. \u201cKill them?\u201d I whisper. \u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>She laughs as I hop back on the bed with her. \u201cLake, you suck at this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill, NO! Not the belt!\u201d she yells dramatically.</p> <p>I clasp my hand over her mouth. \u201cShut up!\u201d I laugh.</p><p>We give ourselves a few minutes to regain our composure before we exit the bedroom. When we walk down the hallway, I do my best to look intimidating. The boys are watching us with fear in their eyes as we take our seats across the bar from them.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll talk,\u201d Lake says to them. \u201cWill is entirely too upset right now to speak to either of you.\u201d</p><p>I stare at them and don\u2019t speak, putting on my best display of anger. I wonder if this is how parenting is with real parents? A bunch of \u2018pretending\u2019 to be responsible grown-ups.</p><p>\u201cFirst of all,\u201d Lake says in a very superbly-faked, motherly tone. \u201cWe would like to commend you both for defending your friend. However, you went about it all wrong. You should have spoken to someone about it. Violence is never the answer to violence,\u201d she says.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t have said it better if I was reading from a parenting handbook.</p><p>\u201cYou are both grounded for two weeks. And don\u2019t think your suspension will be fun, either. We\u2019re giving you both a list of chores to do every day. Including Saturday and Sunday.\u201d</p><p>I tap my knee against hers under the bar, letting her know that was a nice touch.</p> <p>\u201cDo either of you have anything to say?\u201d she asks.</p><p>Kel raises his hand. \u201cWhat about my birthday Friday?\u201d</p><p>Lake looks at me and I shrug my shoulders. She turns back toward Kel.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to be grounded on your birthday. But you\u2019ll get an extra day of grounding. Anymore questions?\u201d</p><p>Neither of them says anything.</p><p>\u201cGood. Go to your room, Kel. No hanging out with Caulder or Kiersten while you\u2019re grounded. Caulder, same goes for you. Go to your house and go to your room.\u201d</p><p>The boys get up from the bar and go to their respective bedrooms. When Kel disappears down the hallway and Caulder disappears out the front door, I give Lake a high five.</p><p>\u201cWell played,\u201d I tell her. \u201cYou almost had me convinced.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou too. You really seemed pissed!\u201d she says. She walks to the living room and starts folding laundry. \u201cSo? How were your classes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d I reply. I spare her the details of first period. \u201cI do have a lot of homework I need to get started on, though. Are we eating together tonight?\u201d</p><p>She shakes her head. \u201cI promised Eddie we could have some girl time tonight. Gavin started his job at Getty\u2019s. But tomorrow I\u2019m all yours.\u201d</p><p>When I walk through the living room toward the front door, I stop and kiss her on top of the head. \u201cYou two have fun. Text me goodnight,\u201d I say. \u201cYou do know where your phone is, right?\u201d</p><p>She nods and pulls it out of her pocket to show me. \u201cLove you,\u201d she says.</p><p>\u201cLove you, too,\u201d I say as I leave.</p><p>When I shut the door behind me, it feels like I left a moment too soon. I walk back in and she\u2019s facing the other way, folding a towel. I turn her around and take the towel out of her hands. I wrap my arms around her and kiss her again, but better this time. \u201cI love you,\u201d I say again.</p><p>She sighs and leans into me. \u201cI can\u2019t wait until next weekend, Will. I wish it would just hurry up and get here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou and me both.\u201d</p><p>Tuesday, January 10th, 2012</p><p>If I were a carpenter, I would build you a window to my soul.</p><p>But I would leave that window shut and locked,</p><p>so that every time you tried to look through it...all you would see is your own reflection.</p><p>You would see that my soul</p><p>is a reflection of you...</p><p>Chapter Four</p><p>Lake has already left for school by the time I wake up the next morning. Kel is asleep on the couch. She must have sent him over before she left. It\u2019s trash day, so I slip my shoes on and head outside to take the can to the curb. I have to knock almost a foot of snow off the lid before I can get it to budge. Lake forgot, so I walk to her house and pull hers to the curb as well.</p><p>\u201cHey, Will,\u201d Sherry says. She and Kiersten are making their way outside.</p><p>\u201cMorning,\u201d I say to them.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened with Kel and Caulder yesterday? Are they in lots of trouble?\u201d Kiersten asks.</p><p>\u201cSuspended. They can\u2019t go back until Monday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuspended for what?\u201d Sherry asks. I can tell by the tone in her voice Kiersten must not have told her.</p><p>Kiersten turns toward her mother. \u201cThey threatened those boys I was telling you about. They wrote them a note, threatening their life. Called them asswipes,\u201d Kiersten says, matter-of-factly.</p><p>\u201cAwe, how sweet,\u201d Sherry says. \u201cThey defended you.\u201d Sherry turns to me before she gets in her car. \u201cWill, tell them thank you. That\u2019s too sweet, defending my baby girl like that.\u201d</p><p>I laugh and shake my head as I watch them drive away. When I get back inside, Kel and Caulder are both sitting on the couch watching TV. \u201cMorning,\u201d I say to them.</p><p>\u201cAre we allowed to watch TV, at least?\u201d Caulder asks.</p><p>I shrug. \u201cWhatever. Do what you want. Just don\u2019t threaten to kill anyone today.\u201d I know I should probably be stricter, but it\u2019s too early in the morning to care.</p><p>\u201cThey were really mean to her, Will,\u201d Kel says. \u201cThey\u2019ve been being mean to her since she moved here. She hasn\u2019t done anything to them.\u201d</p><p>I sit down on the other couch and kick my shoes off. \u201cNot everyone is gonna be nice, Kel. There are a lot of cruel people in the world, unfortunately,\u201d I say. \u201cWhat kinds of things are they doing to her?\u201d</p><p>Caulder turns to me and answers. \u201cOne of the sixth grade boys asked her to be his girlfriend about a week after she moved here but she told him no. He's kind of a bully. She said she was a vegetarian and couldn\u2019t date meatheads. It made him really mad, so he\u2019s been spreading rumors about her since then,\u201d Caulder says. \u201cA lot of kids are scared of him because he\u2019s a dickhead, so now others are being mean to her, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t say dickhead, Caulder. And I think you guys are doing the right thing by defending her. Lake and I aren\u2019t mad about that, we\u2019re actually a little proud. We just wish you would use your heads before you make some of the choices you do. This is two weeks in a row you guys have done something stupid at school. This time, you got suspended because of it. We all have enough on our plates as it is...we don\u2019t need the added stress.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d Kel says.</p><p>\u201cYeah. Sorry, Will,\u201d Caulder says.</p><p>\u201cAs for Kiersten, you two keep doing what you\u2019re doing, sticking by her. She\u2019s a nice kid and doesn\u2019t deserve to be treated like that. Is anyone being nice to her other than you two? She doesn\u2019t have any other friends?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s got Abby,\u201d Caulder says.</p><p>Kel smiles. \u201cShe\u2019s not the only one who has Abby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up, Kel!\u201d Caulder hits him in the arm.</p><p>\u201cWhoa! What\u2019s this? Who\u2019s Abby? Caulder do you have a girlfriend?\u201d I tease.</p><p>\u201cNo, she\u2019s not my girlfriend,\u201d Caulder says defensively.</p><p>\u201cOnly because he\u2019s too shy to ask her,\u201d Kel says.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re one to talk,\u201d I say to Kel. \u201cYou\u2019ve been crushing on Kiersten since the day she moved in. Why haven\u2019t you asked her to be your girlfriend?\u201d</p><p>Kel blushes and tries to hide his smile. He reminds me of Lake when he does this.</p><p>\u201cI already asked her. She is my girlfriend,\u201d he says.</p><p>I\u2019m impressed. He\u2019s got more nerve than I thought.</p><p>\u201cYou better not tell Layken!\u201d he says. \u201cShe\u2019ll embarrass me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t say anything,\u201d I say. \u201cBut your birthday party is this Friday. You better tell Kiersten not to be kissing you in front of Lake if you don\u2019t want her finding out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up, Will! I\u2019m not kissing her,\u201d Kel says with a disgusted look on his face.</p><p>\u201cCaulder, you should invite Abby to Kel\u2019s party,\u201d I say.</p><p>Caulder gets the same embarrassed look Kel had.</p><p>\u201cHe already did,\u201d Kel says. Caulder hits him on the arm again.</p><p>I stand up. It\u2019s obvious my advice isn\u2019t needed here. \u201cWell, you two have it all figured out, then. What do you need me for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomeone has to pay for the pizza,\u201d Caulder says.</p><p>I walk to the front door and grab both of their jackets and toss them in their laps.</p><p>\u201cPunishment time,\u201d I say. They both groan and roll their eyes. \u201cYou guys get to shovel driveways today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDriveways? As in plural? More than one?\u201d Caulder asks.</p><p>\u201cYep,\u201d I say. \u201cDo mine and Lakes, and when you\u2019re done do Sherry and Kiersten\u2019s, too. While you\u2019re at it, go ahead and do Bob and Melinda\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>Neither of them moves from the couch.</p><p>\u201cGo!\u201d</p><p>My stomach is in knots Wednesday morning. I really don\u2019t want to see Vaughn today. I try to leave a few minutes sooner, hoping I can make it to class early enough to pick a seat next to someone else. Unfortunately, I\u2019m the first to arrive. I take a seat in the back again, hoping she doesn\u2019t want to make the trek to the back of the room. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She does. As soon as she spots me, she smiles and runs up the steps, throwing her bag down on the table. \u201cMorning,\u201d she says. \u201cI brought you a coffee. Two sugars, no cream, just like you like it.\u201d She sets the coffee down in front of me.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d I say. She\u2019s got her hair pulled back in a bun. I know exactly what she\u2019s doing. I told her once that I loved it when she wore her hair like that. It\u2019s no coincidence that she\u2019s wearing it like that today.</p><p>\u201cSo, I was thinking we should catch up. Maybe I could come by your house sometime. I miss Caulder, I\u2019d like to see him.\u201d</p><p>Absolutely not! Hell no! That\u2019s what I really want to say.</p> <p>\u201cVaughn, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a good idea,\u201d is what I actually say.</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d she says quietly. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>I can tell I've just offended her by the way she lowers her tone. \u201cLook, I\u2019m not trying to be rude. It\u2019s just...you know, we have a lot of history. It wouldn\u2019t be fair to Lake.\u201d</p><p>She cocks her head at me. \u201cLake? Your girlfriend\u2019s name is Lake?\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t like her demeanor. \u201cHer name is Layken. I call her Lake.\u201d</p> <p>She turns toward me in her seat and puts her hand on my arm. \u201cWill, I\u2019m not trying to cause trouble. If Layken is the jealous type, just say so. It\u2019s not a big deal.\u201d</p><p>She grazes her thumb across my arm and I look down at her hand. I hate how she\u2019s trying to undermine my relationship with her snide comment. She always used to do this. She hasn\u2019t changed at all. I pull my arm away from her and face the front of the room. \u201cVaughn, stop. I know what you\u2019re doing and it\u2019s not gonna happen.\u201d</p><p>She huffs and focuses her attention back to the front of the room. She\u2019s pissed. Good, maybe she got the not so subtle hint.</p><p>I really don't understand where she's coming from. I never imagined I would see her again, much less have to practically fight her off. It's strange how I had so much love for her then, but feel nothing for her now. I don't regret what I went through with her, though. We really did have a pretty good relationship, and I honestly think I would have married her had my parents not passed away. But only because I was na\u00efve as to what a relationship should be. What love should be.</p><p>We met when we were freshmen, but didn't start dating until our junior year. We started hanging out at a party I went to with my best friend, Reece. We went out a few times, then agreed to make the relationship exclusive. We dated for about six months before we had sex for the first time. We both still lived at home with our parents, so it ended up being in the backseat of her car. It was awkward, to say the least. We were cramped, it was cold, and was probably the most unromantic atmosphere a girl could want in that moment. Of course, it got much better over the next year and a half, but I'll always regret that being her first time. Maybe that's why I want Lake's first time to be perfect. Not just another spur of the moment kind of thing like Vaughn and I had.</p><p>I was still grieving and going through a lot of emotional issues after mine and Vaughn's relationship ended. Raising Caulder and doubling up on classes didn't leave me any time to date after that. Vaughn was the last relationship I had up until the moment I met Lake. And after only one date with Lake, I knew the connection between us was something more. It was more than I'd ever had with Vaughn, and more than I ever thought I could have with anyone. For that, I'll be forever grateful to Vaughn for calling off our relationship when she did.</p> <p>Friday is much better. Vaughn doesn\u2019t show up to class, so it makes the rest of the day a lot easier. I stop by the store after my last class and grab Kel\u2019s birthday present, then head home to get ready for his party.</p><p>The only two people Kel and Caulder invited to the party tonight were Kiersten and Abby. Sherry and Kiersten went to pick Abby up while Lake and Eddie left to go get the cake. Gavin showed up with the pizza at the same time I pulled into the driveway. It\u2019s his night off but I had him go pick it up since he gets a discount now.</p><p>\u201cYou nervous?\u201d I ask Caulder as I unstack the pizzas on the counter. I know he\u2019s barely just about to turn eleven, but I remember having my first crush.</p><p>\u201cStop it, Will. You\u2019re gonna make tonight my suck if you keep it up,\u201d he says.</p><p>\u201cFair enough, I\u2019ll drop it. But first, I need to lay down some rules. No holding hands until you\u2019re at least eleven and a half. No kissing until you\u2019re thirteen. And no tongue until you\u2019re fourteen. I mean fifteen. Once you get to that point, we\u2019ll revisit the rules. Until then, you stick to those.\u201d</p><p>Caulder rolls his eyes and walks away.</p><p>That went well, I guess. Our first official \u2018sex\u2019 talk. I think the one I really need to be having the talk with is Kel, though. He seems a little bit more girl crazy than Caulder does.</p><p>\u201cWho placed the order for this cake?\u201d Lake asks as she walks through the front door carrying it in her arms. She doesn\u2019t look pleased.</p> <p>\u201cI let Kel and Caulder order it when we were grocery shopping the other day. Why? What\u2019s wrong with it?\u201d</p><p>She walks over to the bar and sets the cake down. She opens the lid and stands back so I can see it.</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d I say.</p><p>The cake is covered in white buttercream frosting. The writing across the top is done in blue.</p><p>Happy \u2018Butterflying\u2019 Birthday, Kel</p><p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s not really a bad word,\u201d I say.</p><p>Lake sighs. \u201cI really hate that they\u2019re so damn funny,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s just gonna get harder, you know. We really need to start beating them now, before it\u2019s too late.\u201d She closes the lid and walks the cake to the refrigerator.</p><p>\u201cTomorrow,\u201d I say as I wrap my arms around her from behind. \u201cWe can\u2019t beat Kel on his own birthday.\u201d I lean in and kiss her ear.</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d She leans her neck to the side, allowing me easier access. \u201cBut I get the first punch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop it!\u201d Kel yells. \u201cYou guys can\u2019t do that crap tonight. It\u2019s my birthday and I don\u2019t want to have to watch y\u2019all make out!\u201d</p><p>I let go of Lake and pick Kel up and throw him over my shoulder. \u201cThis is for the butterflying cake,\u201d I say. I turn his back toward Layken. \u201cBirthday beating, here\u2019s your chance.\u201d</p><p>Lake starts counting off birthday spankings while Kel fights to get out of my grasp. He\u2019s getting stronger.</p><p>\u201cPut me down, Will!\u201d He's punching me in the back, trying to break free.</p><p>I put him down after Lake finishes with the beating. Kel laughs and tries to shove me, but I don\u2019t budge.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t wait until I\u2019m bigger than you! I\u2019m gonna kick your butterfly!\u201d He gives up and runs down the hallway to Caulder\u2019s room.</p><p>Lake is staring down the hallway with a serious look in her eyes. \u201cShould we be letting them say that?\u201d</p><p>I laugh. \u201cLetting them say what? Butterfly?\u201d</p><p>She nods. \u201cYeah. I mean, it seems like it\u2019s already a bad word.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you rather him say ass?\u201d Kiersten says, passing between Lake and I. Again, she\u2019s here and I didn\u2019t even hear her knock.</p><p>\u201cHey Kiersten,\u201d Lake says.</p><p>There\u2019s a young girl following closely behind Kiersten. She looks at Lake and smiles.</p><p>\u201cYou must be Abby,\u201d Lake says. \"I'm Layken, this is Will.\"</p><p>Abby gives us a slight wave but doesn't say anything.</p><p>\u201cAbby\u2019s shy. Give her time, she\u2019ll warm up to you,\u201d Kiersten says. They turn and make their way to the table in the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cIs Sherry coming?\u201d Lake says.</p><p>\u201cNo, probably not. She wants me to bring her some cake, though.\u201d</p><p>Kel and Caulder run into the kitchen when they hear Abby and Kiersten.</p><p>\u201cThere they are,\u201d Kiersten says. \u201cHow was your week off school, lucky butt\u2019s?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbby, come here,\u201d Caulder says. \u201cI want to show you my room.\u201d</p><p>After Abby follows Caulder out of the room, I look at Lake, a little concerned. She sees the worry in my eyes and laughs. \u201cRelax, Will. They\u2019re only ten. I\u2019m sure he just wants to show her his toys.\u201d</p><p>Regardless, I walk down the hallway and spy.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m the guest, dork. I should get to be player one,\u201d I hear Abby say.</p><p>Sure enough, they\u2019re just being ten. I walk back into the kitchen and wink at Lake.</p><p>After the party is over, Eddie and Gavin agree to take Abby home. Kel and Caulder go to Caulder\u2019s room to play Kel\u2019s new video games. Lake and I are alone in the living room. She's laying down on the couch with her feet in my lap. I rub her feet, massaging the tension away. She's been going nonstop all day, getting everything prepared for Kel's party. She's laying with her eyes closed, enjoying the relaxation.</p><p>\u201cI have a confession to make,\u201d I say, still rubbing her feet.</p><p>She reluctantly opens her eyes. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been counting down the hours in my head until next weekend.\u201d</p><p>She grins at me, relieved that this is my confession. \u201cSo have I. One hundred and sixty three.\u201d</p><p>I lean my head back against the couch and smile at her. \u201cGood, I don\u2019t feel so pathetic now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t make you any less pathetic,\u201d she says. \u201cIt just means we\u2019re both pathetic.\u201d</p><p>She sits up and grabs my shirt, pulling me to her. Her lips brush against mine and she whispers, \u201cWhat are your plans for the next hour or so?\u201d</p><p>Her words cause my pulse to immediately race, and chills to run down my arms. She touches her cheek to mine and whispers in my ear. \u201cLet\u2019s go to my house for a little while, I\u2019ll give you a little preview of next weekend.\u201d</p><p>She doesn\u2019t have to ask twice. I pull away from her and jump over the back of the couch and run to the front door. \u201cBoys, we\u2019ll be back in a little while! Don\u2019t leave!\u201d She\u2019s still sitting on the couch so I walk over and grab her hands, pulling her up. \u201cCome on, we don\u2019t have much time!\u201d</p><p>When we get to her house, she shuts the door behind her. I don\u2019t even wait until we get to the bedroom. I shove her against the front door and start kissing her. \u201cOne hundred and sixty-two,\u201d I say between kisses.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go to the bedroom,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019ll lock the front door. That way if they come over here, they\u2019ll have to knock first.\u201d She turns around and latches the deadbolt.</p><p>\u201cGood idea,\u201d I say. We continue to kiss as we make our way down the hallway. We can\u2019t seem to make it very far without one of us ending up against a wall. By the time we get to the bedroom, my shirt\u2019s already off.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s do that thing again where the first person to call retreat is the loser,\u201d she says. She\u2019s kicking off her shoes so I do the same.</p><p>\"You\u2019re about to lose then, \u2018cause I\u2019m not retreating,\u201d I say. She knows I\u2019ll lose. I always do.</p><p>\u201cNeither am I,\u201d she says, shaking her head. She pulls her legs up and scoots back onto the bed. I stand at the edge of the bed and take in the view before I join her. Sometimes when I watch her, it seems surreal that she\u2019s mine. That she really loves me back. She blows a strand of hair out of her face, then tucks her hair behind her ears and positions herself against the pillow, waiting for me to join her. I slowly slide on top of her and slip my hand behind her neck, gently pulling her lips to mine. I move slowly as I kiss her, trying to savor every second. We hardly ever get to make out; I don\u2019t want to rush it. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI love you so much,\u201d I whisper. She wraps her legs around my waist and tightens her arms on my back in an attempt to pull me in closer.</p><p>\u201cSpend the night with me, Will. Please? You can come over after the boys go to sleep. They\u2019ll never know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLake, it\u2019s just one more week. We can make it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t mean for that. We can wait for that until next weekend. I just want you in my bed tonight, I miss you. Please?\u201d</p> <p>I continue kissing her neck without responding to her plea. I can\u2019t say no, so I just don\u2019t respond at all.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t make me beg, Will. You\u2019re so damn responsible sometimes, it makes me feel weak.\u201d</p><p>I laugh at the thought that she thinks she\u2019s weak. My lips make their way down to the collar of her shirt. \u201cIf I spend the night...what are you gonna wear?\u201d I slowly unbutton the top button of her shirt and press my lips to her skin.</p><p>\u201cOh my god,\u201d she breathes. \u201cI\u2019ll wear whatever the hell you want me to wear.\u201d</p><p>I unbutton the next button on her shirt and move my lips a little lower. \u201cI don\u2019t like this shirt. I definitely don\u2019t want you to wear this shirt,\u201d I say. \u201cIn fact, it\u2019s a really ugly shirt. I think you should take it off and throw it away.\u201d I unbutton the third button, waiting for her to call retreat. I know I\u2019m about to win.</p> <p>When she doesn\u2019t, I continue kissing lower and lower as I unbutton the fourth button, then the fifth button, then the last button. She still doesn\u2019t call retreat. She\u2019s testing me. I slowly bring my lips back to her mouth and she rolls me onto my back and straddles me, then slides her shirt off and tosses it aside.</p><p>I run my hands up her arms and over the curves of her chest. Her hair has gotten a lot longer since I met her. It\u2019s hanging loosely around her as she leans over me. I tuck it behind her ears so I can see her face better. It\u2019s dark, but I can still make out her smile, and the amazing emerald hue of her eyes. I slide my hands back up to her shoulders and trace the outline of her bra.</p><p>\u201cWear this tonight.\u201d I slide my fingers under the straps. \u201cI like this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo does that mean you\u2019re staying the night?\u201d she asks. Her tone is more serious now. Not so playful.</p><p>\u201cIf you wear this,\u201d I say, being just as serious. She presses her body against mine, our bare skin meeting for the first time in months. I\u2019m definitely not calling retreat now. I can\u2019t. I\u2019m usually not so weak; I don\u2019t know what it is about her right now that\u2019s making me so weak.</p><p>\u201cLake.\u201d I break my lips apart from hers, but she continues kissing the edges of them as I speak, short of breath. \u201cIt\u2019s just a matter of hours until next weekend. It\u2019s coming up so fast, in fact...that this weekend can be considered part of the upcoming week. And the upcoming week is part of next weekend. So technically, next weekend is sort of occurring right now...this very second.\u201d</p> <p>She grabs my face with her hands and positions it in front of her so that she can look me straight in the eyes. \u201cWill? You better not be saying this because you think I\u2019m about to call retreat, because I\u2019m not. Not this time.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s serious. I gently roll her onto her back and ease myself on top of her. I place my hand on the side of her head and stroke her cheek with my thumb, looking her straight in the eyes. \u201cYou\u2019re not? Are you positive you\u2019re ready to not call retreat? Right now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPositive,\u201d she whispers. She wraps her legs tightly around my thighs and we completely give in to our need for each other. I grab the back of her head and press her mouth into mine even harder. I can feel my pulse rushing through my entire body as we both begin to gasp for air between each kiss, like we suddenly forgot how to breathe. We\u2019re both desperate, doing our best to get past the moment one of us usually calls retreat. We pass that moment pretty quickly. I reach around to her back until my hands find the clasp on her bra and I unhook it while she frantically tugs at the button on my pants. I pull the straps of her bra down over her arms to slide it off when the worst thing in the world happens. Someone knocks on the damn door.</p><p>\u201cChrist!\u201d I say. My head is spinning so fast, I have to take a moment to calm down. I press my forehead into the pillow next to her and we both try to catch our breath. She slides out from under me and stands up.</p><p>\u201cWill, I can\u2019t find my shirt,\u201d she says with panic in her voice. I roll onto my back and pull her shirt out from beneath me and toss it to her.</p><p>\u201cHere\u2019s your ugly shirt,\u201d I tease.</p><p>The boys are beating on the door now, so I hop out of the bed and go down the hallway to find my own shirt before opening the front door for them.</p><p>\u201cWhat took you so long?\u201d Kel asks as they shove their way past me.</p> <p>\u201cWe were watching a movie,\u201d I lie. \u201cWe were at a really good part and didn\u2019t want to pause it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Lake agrees, emerging from the hallway. \u201cA really good part.\u201d</p><p>Kel and Caulder walk to the kitchen and flip the light on.</p><p>\u201cCan Caulder stay here tonight?\u201d Kel asks.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know why you guys even bother asking anymore,\u201d Lake says.</p><p>\u201cBecause we\u2019re grounded. Remember?\u201d Caulder says.</p><p>Lake looks to me for assistance.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s your birthday, Kel. The grounding can resume tomorrow night,\u201d I say.</p><p>They both go to the living room and start watching TV.</p><p>I reach my hand out to Lake. \u201cWalk me home?\u201d</p><p>Lake grabs my hand and we head out the front door.</p><p>\u201cAre you coming back over later?\u201d she asks.</p><p>Now that I\u2019ve had the chance to cool off, I can see where coming back might not be a good idea. \u201cLake, maybe I shouldn\u2019t. We got really carried away just now. How do you expect me to sleep in the same bed with you after that?\u201d</p><p>I expect her to object, but she doesn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right, like always. It\u2019ll be weird anyway with our brothers in the same house.\u201d She wraps her arms around me when we reach my front door. It\u2019s incredibly cold outside, but she doesn\u2019t seem to care as we stand there and hold each other.</p><p>\u201cOr maybe you\u2019re wrong,\u201d she says. \"Maybe you should come back in an hour. I\u2019ll wear the ugliest pajamas I can find and I won\u2019t even brush my teeth. You won\u2019t want to touch me. All we\u2019ll do is sleep.\u201d</p><p>I laugh at her absurd plan. \u201cYou could go a week without brushing your teeth or changing clothes and I still wouldn\u2019t be able to keep my hands off you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m serious, Will. Come back in an hour, I just want to cuddle with you. I\u2019ll make sure the boys are in their room and you can sneak in like we\u2019re in high school.\u201d</p><p>She doesn\u2019t have to do much convincing. \u201cFine. I\u2019ll be back in an hour. But all we\u2019re doing is sleeping, okay? No tempting me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo tempting, promise,\u201d she says with a grin.</p><p>I cup her chin in my hand and lower my voice as I speak. \u201cLake, I\u2019m serious. I want this to be perfect for you and I get really carried away when I\u2019m with you. We only have a week left. I want to stay the night with you but I need you to promise me you won't put me in that position again for at least 162 more hours. \u201d</p><p>\u201cOne hundred sixty-one and a half,\u201d she says.</p><p>I shake my head and laugh. \u201cGo put those boys to bed. I\u2019ll see you in a little while.\u201d</p><p>She kisses me goodbye and I head into the house and take a shower. A cold shower.</p><p>When I get to her house an hour later, all the lights are off. I lock the door behind me and ease my way down the hallway and into her bedroom. She left the bedside lamp on for me. She\u2019s lying in bed with her back toward me, so I climb in behind her and slide my arm under her head. I expect her to respond, but she\u2019s out. She\u2019s actually snoring. I brush her hair behind her ear and kiss the back of her head as I pull the covers around us both and close my eyes.</p><p>Saturday, January 14th, 2012</p><p>I love being with you so bad</p><p>When we aren\u2019t together, I miss you so bad</p><p>One of these days, I\u2019m going to marry you so bad</p><p>And it\u2019ll be</p><p>Chapter Five</p><p>Lake was upset when she woke up Saturday morning and I was already gone. She says it wasn\u2019t fair that she slept through our entire first sleepover. Regardless, I enjoyed it. I watched her sleep for a while before I went back home.</p><p>We didn\u2019t get into any more situations like the one in her bedroom Friday night. I think we\u2019re both surprised at how intense things got; so we\u2019re trying to avoid it happening again. Until this coming weekend, anyway. Saturday we spent the evening at Joel\u2019s with Eddie and Gavin. Sunday, Lake and I did homework together. Pretty typical weekend.</p><p>Now I\u2019m sitting here in Death and Dying, being stared down by the only person I\u2019ve ever had sex with. It\u2019s awkward. The way Vaughn is acting, I feel like I really am hiding something from Lake. But telling her about Vaughn now would just prove that I wasn\u2019t being completely honest the first week of school. The last thing I want to do before this weekend is upset Lake, so I decide to wait another week before I bring it up.</p><p>\u201cVaughn, the professor is up there,\u201d I say, pointing to the front of the room. She continues to stare at me.</p><p>\u201cWill, you\u2019re being a snob,\u201d she whispers. \u201cI don\u2019t understand why you won\u2019t just talk to me. If you were really over what happened between us, it wouldn\u2019t bother you this much.\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t believe she honestly thinks I\u2019m not over us. I\u2019ve been over us since the day I first laid eyes on Lake.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m over us, Vaughn. It\u2019s been three years. You\u2019re over us, too. You just always want what you can\u2019t have, and it\u2019s pissing you off. It\u2019s got nothing to do with me.\u201d</p><p>She folds her arms across her chest and sits back in her chair. \u201cYou think I want you?\u201d She glares at me, then turns her attention to the front of the room. \u201cHas anyone ever told you that you\u2019re an asshole?\u201d she whispers.</p><p>I laugh. \u201cAs a matter of fact, yes. More than once.\u201d</p><p>Today is Kel and Caulder\u2019s first day back to school since their suspension. They both climb in the car with defeated expressions across their faces. I eye the books spilling out of their backpacks and realize it\u2019s going to be a night full of catching up on homework for the two of them. \u201cI guess you guys learned your lesson,\u201d I say, pulling out of the parking lot.</p><p>Lake is walking out of my house when we get out of the car. It doesn\u2019t bother me at all that she\u2019s at my house when I\u2019m not home, but I'm a little curious what she was doing while she was inside. She sees the confusion on my face as she walks toward me. She holds out her hand and reveals one of the stars that her mother made, resting in her palm.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t judge me,\u201d she says. She looks down at her palm and rolls the star around in her hand. \u201cI just miss her today.\u201d</p><p>The look on her face makes me sad for her. I give her a quick hug, then watch her walk across the street and go back inside her house. She\u2019s in need of alone time, so I give it to her. \u201cKel, stay over here for a while. I\u2019ll help you guys with all your homework.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>It takes us a couple of hours to finish the weeks\u2019 worth of assignments that piled up while the boys were suspended. Gavin and Eddie are supposed to come over for dinner tonight, so I head to the kitchen to start cooking. We\u2019re not having burgers tonight. I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll never have burgers again. I debate on whether or not I want to cook basagna, but decide against it. Honestly, I don\u2019t even feel like cooking. I grab the phone and go to the fridge and slide the Chinese menu out from under the magnet.</p><p>Half an hour later, Eddie and Gavin show up, followed a minute later by Lake, then the Chinese delivery guy. I set the containers in the middle of the table and we all start filling our plates.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re in the middle of a game, can we eat in my room tonight?\u201d Caulder asks.</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d I say.</p> <p>\u201cI thought they were grounded,\u201d Gavin says.</p><p>\u201cThey are,\u201d Lake replies.</p><p>Gavin picks up his eggroll and takes a bite. \u201cThey\u2019re playing video games. What exactly are they grounded from, then?\u201d</p><p>Lake looks to me for assistance. I don\u2019t know the answer, but I try anyway.</p><p>\u201cGavin, are you questioning our parenting skills?\u201d I ask.</p> <p>\u201cNope,\u201d Gavin says. \u201cNot at all.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s a weird vibe tonight. Eddie is extremely quiet as she picks at her food. Gavin and I try to make small talk, but that doesn\u2019t last long. Lake seems to be in her own little world, not paying much attention to what\u2019s going on. I try to break the tension.</p><p>\u201cSuck and sweet time,\u201d I say. Almost simultaneously, all three of them object.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d I ask them. \u201cWhat\u2019s with all the depression tonight?\u201d No one answers me. Eddie and Gavin look at each other. Eddie looks like she\u2019s about to cry so Gavin kisses her on the forehead, but they just continue eating. I look over at Lake and she\u2019s just staring down at her plate, twirling her noodles around. \u201cWhat about you, Babe? What\u2019s wrong?\u201d I say to her.</p><p>\u201cNothing. Really, it\u2019s nothing,\u201d she says, unsuccessfully trying to convince me she\u2019s fine. She smiles at me and grabs both of our glasses and goes to the kitchen to refill them.</p><p>\u201cSorry, Will,\u201d Gavin says. \u201cEddie and I aren\u2019t trying to be rude. We\u2019ve just got a lot on our minds lately.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo problem,\u201d I say. \u201cAnything I can do to help?\u201d</p><p>They both shake their heads. \u201cYou going to the slam Thursday night?\u201d Gavin asks, changing the subject.</p><p>We haven\u2019t been in a few weeks. Since before Christmas, I think. \u201cI don\u2019t know, I guess we could.\u201d I turn to Lake. \u201cYou want to?\u201d</p><p>She shrugs. \u201cSounds fun. We\u2019ll have to see if someone can watch Kel and Caulder, though.\u201d</p><p>Eddie clears her and Gavin\u2019s spots at the table while Gavin puts his jacket on. \u201cWe\u2019ll see you there, then. Thanks for supper. We won\u2019t suck so much next time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d I say. \u201cEveryone\u2019s entitled to a bad day every now and then.\u201d</p><p>After they leave, I close the take-out containers and start placing them in the refrigerator while Lake washes our dishes in the sink. I walk over to her and hug her. \u201cYou sure you\u2019re okay?\u201d I ask.</p><p>She turns around and hugs me back, laying her head against my chest. \u201cI\u2019m fine, Will. It\u2019s just....\u201d She stops talking. I lift her face up to mine and she\u2019s trying to hold back tears.</p> <p>I place my hand on the back of her head and pull her to me. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>She quietly cries into my shirt. I can tell she\u2019s trying again to stop herself. I wish she wasn\u2019t so hard on herself when she gets sad.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just today,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s their anniversary.\u201d</p><p>I realize she\u2019s talking about her mom and dad, so I don\u2019t say anything. I just hug her tighter and kiss the top of her head.</p><p>\u201cI know it\u2019s silly that I\u2019m upset. I\u2019m mostly upset about the fact that it\u2019s making me so upset,\u201d she says.</p><p>I place my hands on her cheeks and pull her gaze to mine. \u201cIt\u2019s not silly, Lake. I don\u2019t know why you get so mad at yourself when you\u2019re sad. It\u2019s okay to cry sometimes.\u201d</p><p>She smiles and kisses me, then breaks away, still attempting to not be sad. \u201cI\u2019m going somewhere with Eddie tomorrow night. Wednesday night I have a study group, so I won\u2019t see you until Thursday. Are you getting a sitter, or should I?\u201d she asks.</p><p>\u201cDo you really think they need one? Kel\u2019s eleven now and Caulder will be eleven in two months. Don\u2019t you think they can stay home for a few hours by themselves?\u201d</p><p>She nods. \u201cI guess so. Maybe I\u2019ll ask Sherry if she\u2019ll at least feed them supper and check on them. I could give her some money.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like that idea,\u201d I say.</p><p>She calls for Kel after she gets her jacket and shoes on, then walks back to the kitchen and puts her arms around me. \u201cNinety three more hours,\" she says, planting a kiss on my neck. \u201cI love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cListen to me,\u201d I say as I look her intently in the eyes. \u201cIt\u2019s okay to be sad, Lake. Quit trying to carve so many pumpkins. And I love you, too.\u201d I kiss her one last time and lock the door behind them when they leave.</p><p>Tonight was really strange. The whole vibe seemed off. I decide since we\u2019re going to the slam to try to put my thoughts down on paper. I think I\u2019ll surprise Lake and do one for her this week. Maybe it'll help her feel better.</p><p>For reasons beyond my comprehension, Vaughn sits next to me again on Wednesday. You would think after our little tiff on Monday that she would have given up by now. I was hoping she had, anyway.</p><p>She pulls her notebook out and opens her textbook where we left off Monday. She doesn\u2019t stare at me this time. In fact, she doesn\u2019t even speak during the entire class period. I\u2019m happy she\u2019s not talking to me, but at the same time I feel a little guilty for being so rude to her. Not guilty enough to apologize about it, though. She did deserve it.</p><p>As we\u2019re packing our things up, still not speaking, she slides something across the table to me, then walks out. I debate throwing the note in the trash without reading it, but my curiosity gets the better of me. I wait until I\u2019m seated in my next class to open it.</p><p>Will,</p><p>You may not want to hear this, but I need to say it. I\u2019m really sorry. Breaking up with you is one of my biggest regrets in life so far. Especially breaking up with you when I did. It wasn\u2019t fair to you, I realize that now; but I was young and I was scared.</p><p>You can\u2019t act like what we had between us was nothing. I loved you, and I know you loved me. You at least owe me the courtesy of talking to me. I just want the chance to apologize to you in person. I can\u2019t seem to let go of how things ended between us. Let me apologize.</p><p>Vaughn</p><p>I fold the note up and put it in my pocket, then lay my head down on the desk and sigh. She\u2019s not going to let it go. I don\u2019t want to think about it right now, so I don\u2019t. I\u2019ll worry about it later.</p><p>The next night, I don\u2019t think about anything other than Lake.</p><p>I\u2019m picking her up in an hour, so I rush through my homework and head to the shower. I walk past Caulder\u2019s bedroom on my way. He and Kel are playing video games.</p><p>\u201cWhy can\u2019t we go with you? You said yourself there wasn\u2019t an age limit,\u201d Kel says.</p><p>I pause and back step to their doorway. \u201cYou guys actually want to go? You realize it\u2019s poetry, right?\u201d</p><p>They seem excited at the possibility of actually going.</p><p>\u201cFine, let me make sure it\u2019s okay with Lake first.\u201d I head out the front door and across the street. When I open the door to her house, she screams.</p><p>\u201cWill! Turn around!\u201d I turn around, but not before I see her. She must have just gotten out of the shower, because she\u2019s standing in the living room completely naked.</p><p>\u201cOh my god, I thought I locked the door. Doesn\u2019t anyone knock?\u201d</p><p>I laugh. \u201cWelcome to my world,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cYou can turn around now,\u201d she says.</p><p>When I turn around, she\u2019s wrapped in a towel. I walk over to her and wrap my arms around her waist, pick her up off the floor and spin her around. \u201cTwenty four more hours,\u201d I say as her feet touch the floor again. \u201cYou nervous yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope, not at all. Like I said before...I\u2019m in good hands.\u201d</p><p>I want to kiss her, but I don\u2019t. The towel is too much, so I back away from her and ask her what I came here to ask her. \u201cKel and Caulder want to know if it\u2019s okay if they go with us tonight. They\u2019re curious,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cReally? That\u2019s weird...but I don\u2019t care if you don\u2019t care,\u201d she says.</p><p>\u201cOkay, then. I\u2019ll tell them.\u201d I walk back toward the door. \u201cAnd Lake? Thanks for giving me another preview.\u201d</p><p>She looks slightly embarrassed so I wink at her and shut her front door behind me. This is about to be the longest twenty-four hours of my life.</p><p>We take a seat in the back of the club with Gavin and Eddie. In fact, it\u2019s the same booth Lake and I sat in on our first date. Kiersten wanted to come, too, so it\u2019s a tight fit.</p><p>Sherry must trust us a lot. She asked a lot of questions about the slam before she agreed to let Kiersten come, though. By the end of the question/answer session, Sherry was intrigued. She said it would be good for Kiersten to see a slam. Kiersten said doing a slam would be good for her portfolio, so she brought a pen and a notebook to take notes.</p><p>\u201cAlright, who\u2019s thirsty?\u201d I take drink orders and head to the bar before the sac is brought on stage to perform. I explained the rules to all the kids on the way here, so I think they have a pretty good understanding of it. I haven\u2019t told them I\u2019m performing though. I want it to be a surprise. Lake doesn\u2019t know either, so before I take the drinks back to the table, I go pay my fee.</p><p>\u201cThis is so cool,\u201d Kiersten says when I get back to the booth. \u201cYou guys are the coolest parents ever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo they aren\u2019t,\u201d Kel says. \u201cThey don\u2019t let us cuss.\u201d</p><p>Lake hushes them as the first performer steps up to the microphone. I recognize the guy; I\u2019ve seen him perform here a lot. He\u2019s really good. I put my arm around Lake and he begins his poem.</p><p>\u201cMy name is Edmund Davis-Quinn and this is a piece I wrote called Write Poorly.\u201d</p><p>Write poorly.</p><p>Suck</p><p>Write awful</p><p>Terribly</p><p>Frightfully</p><p>Don\u2019t care</p><p>Turn off the inner editor</p><p>Let yourself write</p><p>Let it flow</p><p>Let yourself fail</p><p>Do something crazy</p><p>Write fifty thousand words in the month of November.</p><p>I did it.</p><p>It was fun, it was insane it was one thousand six hundred and sixty seven words a day.</p><p>It was possible.</p><p>But, you have to turn off your inner critic.</p><p>Off completely.</p><p>Just write.</p><p>Quickly.</p><p>In Bursts.</p><p>With joy.</p><p>If you can\u2019t write, run away for a few.</p><p>Come back.</p><p>Write again.</p><p>Writing is like anything else. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>You won\u2019t get good at it immediately.</p><p>It\u2019s a craft you have to keep getting better.</p><p>You don\u2019t get to Julliard, unless you practice.</p><p>If you want to get to Carnegie Hall, practice, practice, practice.</p> <p>...or give them a lot of money.</p><p>Like anything else it takes ten thousand hours to get to mastery.</p><p>Just like Malcolm Gladwell says.</p><p>So write.</p><p>Fail.</p> <p>Get your thoughts down.</p><p>Let it rest.</p><p>Let it marinate.</p><p>Then edit.</p><p>But don\u2019t edit as you type,</p><p>that just slows the brain down.</p> <p>Find a daily practice,</p><p>for me it\u2019s blogging every day.</p><p>And it\u2019s fun.</p><p>The more you write, the easier it gets.

Make it a practice. And write poorly, write awfully, write with abandon and it may end up being</p><p>really</p><p>really</p> <p>When the crowd starts cheering I glance at the kids. They\u2019re all just staring at the stage. \u201cHoly shit,\u201d Kiersten says. \u201cThis is awesome. That was incredible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy are you just now bringing us here, Will? This is so cool!\u201d Caulder says.</p><p>I\u2019m surprised they all seem to like it as much as they do. They\u2019re relatively quiet the rest of the night as they watch the performers. Kiersten keeps writing in her notebook. I\u2019m not sure what kind of notes she\u2019s taking but I can see she\u2019s really into it. I make a mental note to give her some of my older poems later.</p><p>\u201cNext up, Will Cooper,\u201d the emcee says. Everyone at the table looks at me, surprised.</p><p>\u201cAre you doing one?\u201d Lake says. I just smile at her and nod as I stand up and walk away from the table.</p><p>I used to get nervous when I would perform. A small part of me still does, but I think it\u2019s more the adrenaline rush than anything. The first time I ever came here was with my father. He was really into the arts. Music, poetry, painting, reading, writing. All of it. I saw him perform here for the first time when I was fifteen. I\u2019ve been hooked since. I hate that Caulder never got to know that side of him. I\u2019ve kept as much of my dad\u2019s writings as I could find, even a couple of old paintings. Someday I\u2019ll give them all to Caulder. Someday when he's old enough to appreciate it.</p><p>I take the stage and walk up to the microphone, adjusting the height of it. My poem isn\u2019t going to make sense to anyone besides Lake. This one\u2019s just for her.</p><p>\u201cMy piece is called Point of Retreat,\u201d I say into the microphone. The spotlight is bright, so I can\u2019t see her from up here, but I have a pretty good idea she\u2019s smiling. I don\u2019t rush the words of the poem, I perform it slow so she can take in every word of it.</p><p>Twenty-two hours and our war begins.</p><p>Our war of limbs</p><p>The point of retreat</p><p>Is no longer a factor</p><p>When both sides of the line</p><p>Agree to surrender</p><p>I can\u2019t tell you how many times I\u2019ve lost...</p><p>Or is it how many times you\u2019ve won?</p><p>This game we\u2019ve been playing for fifty-nine weeks</p><p>I\u2019d say the score</p><p>to</p><p>Twenty-two hours and our war begins</p><p>Our war of limbs</p><p>The best part of finally</p><p>Not calling retreat?</p><p>The showers above us</p><p>Raining down on our feet</p><p>While the bombs are exploding and the guns fire their rounds. Before the two of us collapse to the ground. Before the battle, before the war...</p><p>You need to know</p><p>I\u2019d go fifty-nine more.</p><p>Whatever it takes to let you win.</p><p>I\u2019d retreat all over</p><p>and all over</p><p>and over</p><p>I back away from the microphone and find the stairs. I\u2019m not even halfway back to the booth when Lake throws her arms around my neck and kisses me. \u201cThank you,\u201d she whispers in my ear.</p><p>When I slide into the booth, Caulder rolls his eyes. \u201cYou could have warned us, Will. We would have hid in the bathroom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought it was beautiful,\u201d Kiersten says.</p><p>It\u2019s after nine when round two gets underway. \u201cCome on kids, you guys have school tomorrow. We need to go,\u201d I say. They all whine as they slide out of the booth one by one.</p><p>Once we get home, the kids head into the houses and Lake and I linger in the driveway, hugging. It's getting harder and harder to be separated from her at night, knowing she\u2019s just yards away. It's become a nightly struggle not to text her and beg her to come crawl in bed with me. Now that our promise to Julia has been fulfilled, I have a feeling nothing will stop us after tomorrow night. Well, other than the fact that we're trying to set a good example for Kel and Caulder. But there's ways to sneak around that.</p><p>I slide my hands up the back of her shirt to warm them. They\u2019re freezing. She apparently thinks so too and begins to squirm, trying to get out of my grasp.</p><p>\"Your hands are freezing!\" she laughs, still trying to pull away from me.</p><p>I just squeeze her tighter. \"I know. That's why you need to be still so I can warm them up.\" I rub them against her skin, attempting to keep the mental images of tomorrow night from overtaking my thoughts at the moment. It's so distracting. I remove my hands from underneath her shirt and wrap my arms around her.</p><p>\u201cSo. Do you want the good news or the bad news first?\u201d I ask her.</p><p>She shoots me a dirty look. \u201cDo you want me to punch you in the face or the nuts?\u201d</p><p>I laugh, but prepare to defend myself just in case. \u201cMy grandparents are worried the boys will get bored at their house, so they want to keep them at my house instead. The good news is, we can\u2019t stay at your house now so I booked us two nights in a hotel in Detroit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not bad news. Don\u2019t scare me like that,\u201d she says.</p><p>\"I just thought you would be a little apprehensive about seeing my grandmother. I know how you feel about her.\u201d</p><p>She looks at me and frowns. \u201cDon\u2019t, Will. You know good and well it\u2019s not how I feel about her. She hates me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe doesn\u2019t hate you,\u201d I say. \u201cShe\u2019s just protective of me.\u201d I wrap my arms around her tighter and try to push the thought out of her mind by kissing her ear.</p><p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s your fault she hates me anyway.\u201d</p><p>I pull back and look at her. \u201cMy fault? How is it my fault?\u201d</p><p>She rolls her eyes. \u201cYour graduation? You don\u2019t remember what you said the first night I met her?\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t remember. I don\u2019t know what she\u2019s talking about. I try to remember, but nothing comes to mind.</p><p>\u201cWill, we were all over each other. After your graduation when we all went out to eat, you could barely talk you were kissing me so much. It was making your grandmother really uncomfortable. When she asked you how long we\u2019d been dating, you told her eighteen hours! How do you think that made me look?\u201d</p><p>I remember now. That dinner was really fun. It felt great not to be ethically bound from putting my hands all over her, so that's all I did all night long.</p><p>\u201cBut it\u2019s sort of true,\u201d I say. \u201cWe were only officially dating for eighteen hours.\u201d</p><p>Lake hits me on the arm. \u201cShe thinks I\u2019m a slut, Will! It\u2019s embarrassing!\u201d</p><p>I touch my lips against her ear again. \u201cNot yet, you\u2019re not,\u201d I tease.</p><p>She pushes me away and points to herself. \u201cYou aren\u2019t getting any more of this for twenty-four hours.\u201d She laughs and starts to walk backwards up her driveway.</p><p>\u201cTwenty-one,\u201d I correct her.</p><p>She reaches the front door and turns and goes inside without so much as a goodnight kiss. What a tease! She\u2019s not getting the upper hand tonight. I run up the driveway and open her front door and pull her back outside. I push her against the brick wall of the entryway and look her in the eyes as I press my body against hers. She\u2019s trying to look mad, but I can see the corner of her mouth break out into a smile. Our hands interlock and I bring them above her head and press them against the wall. \u201cListen to me very carefully,\u201d I whisper. I continue to look her in the eyes. She listens. She likes it when I try to intimidate her. \u201cI don\u2019t want you to pack a damn thing. I want you to wear exactly what you were wearing last Friday night. Do you still have that ugly shirt?\u201d</p><p>She smiles and nods. I don\u2019t think she could speak right now if she wanted to.</p><p>\u201cGood. What you\u2019re wearing when we leave tomorrow night is the only thing you\u2019re allowed to bring. No pajamas....no extra clothes. Nothing. I want you to meet me at my house at seven o\u2019clock tomorrow night. Do you understand?\u201d</p><p>She nods again. Her pulse is racing against my chest and I can tell by the look in her eyes that she needs me to kiss her. My hands remain clasped with hers against the wall as I move my mouth closer to her lips. I hesitate at the last minute and decide not to kiss her. I slowly drop her hands and back away from her and make my way back to the house. When I reach my front door, I turn around and she\u2019s still leaning against the brick in the same position. Good. I got the upper hand this time.</p><p>Friday, January 20th, 2012</p><p>Lake will never read my journal, so I should say what\u2019s really on my mind, right? Even if she does read this, it\u2019ll be after I\u2019m dead when she\u2019s sorting through my things. So technically, maybe one day she will actually read this. But it won\u2019t matter by then, \u2018cause I\u2019ll be dead.</p><p>So, Lake...if you\u2019re reading this...I\u2019m sorry I\u2019m dead.</p><p>But for right now, in this moment...I am so alive. So very much alive. Tonight is the night. It\u2019s been worth the wait. All fifty-nine weeks of it. (Over seventy if you count from our first date)</p><p>So, I\u2019ll just say what\u2019s on my mind, okay?</p><p>Sex.</p><p>Sex, sex, sex. I\u2019m having sex tonight. Making love. Butterflying. Whatever you want to call it, we\u2019ll be doing it.</p><p>And I can\u2019t freaking wait.</p><p>Chapter Six</p><p>I want today to be perfect, so I decide to skip school, clean the house and finalize our plans before my grandparents arrive. I can\u2019t believe how nervous I am. Or maybe it\u2019s excitement. I don\u2019t know what it is; I just know I want the day to hurry the hell up.</p><p>On my way home from picking the boys up from school, we stop at the store to get a few things for dinner. We don\u2019t have plans to leave until seven so I text my grandfather and tell them I\u2019m cooking for them. I\u2019m baking basagna. Julia said to wait for a good day to bake it again...and it\u2019s definitely a good day. I\u2019m running behind when I see their headlights through the living room window. I haven\u2019t even showered yet and I still need to cook the breadsticks.</p><p>\u201cCaulder, Grandma and Grandpa are here, go open the door!\u201d</p><p>He doesn\u2019t need to, they open the door anyway. Without knocking, of course. My grandmother walks through the door first so I walk over to her and kiss her on the cheek.</p><p>\u201cHi, Sweetie,\u201d she says. \u201cWhat smells so good?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBasagna.\u201d I walk to my grandfather and give him a hug. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBasagna?\u201d she says.</p><p>I shake my head and laugh. \u201cLasagna, I mean.\u201d</p><p>My grandmother smiles at me and it reminds of my mom. They were almost identical. She and my grandfather are both tall and thin, just like my mom. A lot of people find my grandmother intimidating, but I find it hard to be intimidated by her. I\u2019ve spent so much time with her; it feels like she\u2019s my own mother sometimes.</p><p>My grandfather sets their bags down by the front door and they follow me into the kitchen. \u201cWill, have you heard of this twitter?\u201d He brings his glasses to the edge of his nose and looks down at his phone.</p> <p>My grandmother looks at me and shakes her head. \u201cHe got one of those intelligent phones. Now he\u2019s trying to twit the President.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSmart phones,\u201d I correct her. \u201cAnd it\u2019s tweet, not twit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe follows me,\u201d my grandfather says, defensively. \u201cI\u2019m not kidding, he really does! I got a message yesterday that said \u2018The President is now following you.\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s cool, Grandpa. But no, I don\u2019t tweet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you should. A young man your age needs to stay ahead of the game when it comes to the social media.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll be fine,\u201d I assure him. I put the breadsticks in the oven and start to grab plates out of the cabinet.</p><p>\u201cLet me do that, Will,\u201d my grandmother says, pulling the plates out of my hands.</p><p>\u201cHey Grandma, hey Grandpa,\u201d Caulder says, running into the kitchen to hug them. \u201cGrandpa, do you remember the game we played last time you were here?\u201d</p><p>My grandfather nods. \u201cYou mean the one where I killed twenty-six enemy soldiers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, that one. Kel got the newest one for his birthday. You want to play it with us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou bet I do!\u201d he says, following Caulder to his bedroom.</p> <p>The funny thing is, my grandfather isn\u2019t being overdramatic for Caulder\u2019s benefit. He genuinely wants to play.</p><p>My grandmother pulls a stack of glasses out of the cabinet and turns to me. \u201cHe\u2019s getting worse, you know,\u201d she says.</p><p>\u201cHow so?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe bought himself one of those game thingies. He\u2019s getting all into this technology stuff. Now he\u2019s on the twitter!\u201d She shakes her head. \u201cHe\u2019s always telling me things he twitted to people. I don\u2019t get it, Will. It\u2019s like some sort of mid-life crisis, twenty years too late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s tweeted. And I think it\u2019s cool. It gives him and Caulder a way to relate.\u201d</p><p>She finishes filling the cups with ice and walks back to the bar. \u201cShould I set a place for Layken, too?\u201d she says flatly. I can tell by her tone that she\u2019s hoping I say no.</p><p>\u201cYes, you should,\u201d I say sternly.</p><p>She darts a look in my direction. \u201cWill, I\u2019m just going to say it.\u201d</p> <p>Oh boy, here we go.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not appropriate with the two of you just running off for the weekend like this. You aren\u2019t even engaged yet, much less married. I just think you two rushed into things so quickly, it makes me nervous.\u201d</p><p>I put my hands on my grandmother\u2019s shoulders and smile reassuringly at her. \u201cGrandma, we aren\u2019t rushing into things, believe me. And you need to give her a chance, she\u2019s amazing. Now promise me you will at least pretend to like her when she gets here. And be nice!\u201d</p><p>She sighs. \u201cIt\u2019s not that I don\u2019t like her, Will. It just makes me uncomfortable, the way you two act together. It just seems like you\u2019re...I don\u2019t know... too in love.\u201d</p><p>I take the pan of basagna to the table as I respond to her. \u201cIf your only complaint about her is that we\u2019re too in love, I guess I\u2019ll take it.\u201d</p><p>She brings the extra place setting to the table and sets an extra glass down for Lake.</p><p>\u201cI still need to jump in the shower, it won\u2019t take long,\u201d I say. \u201cThe breadsticks should be done in a few minutes if you\u2019ll take them out.\u201d</p><p>She agrees and I head to my room to pack a few things before going to shower. I reach under the bed to grab my bag and set it on the comforter. When I zip it open, I notice my hands are shaking. Why the hell am I so nervous? It\u2019s not like I\u2019ve never done this before. Then again, it\u2019s Lake. I realize as I\u2019m shoving the last of my clothes into the bag that I\u2019m grinning like a complete idiot. I really need a cold shower.</p><p>I grab my change of clothes and head to the bathroom when I hear a knock on the front door. I smile. She\u2019s trying to impress my grandmother, so she knocks this time. It\u2019s cute. She\u2019s making an effort.</p><p>\u201cOh my God! Look who it is!\u201d I hear my grandmother squeal after she opens the front door. \u201cPaul! Come look who\u2019s here!\u201d</p><p>I roll my eyes. I know I asked her to be polite to Lake, but I didn\u2019t expect her to make a spectacle. I open the door and make my way into the living room. She\u2019ll be pissed if I leave her to fend for herself while I shower.</p><p>Shit! Shit, shit, shit! What the hell is she doing here?</p><p>She\u2019s hugging my grandfather when she sees me standing in the hallway. \u201cHey, Will,\u201d she smiles.</p><p>I don\u2019t smile back.</p><p>\u201cVaughn, we haven\u2019t seen you in years,\u201d my grandmother says. \u201cStay for dinner, it\u2019s almost ready. I\u2019ll make you a plate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d I yell, probably a little to angrily.</p><p>My grandmother turns toward me and frowns. \u201cWill, that\u2019s not very nice,\u201d she says.</p><p>I ignore her. \u201cVaughn? Can I talk to you please?\u201d I motion for her to join me in the bedroom. I need to get rid of her, now. She walks into my bedroom and I close the door behind me. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>She sits down on the edge of the bed. \u201cI told you, I just need to talk to you.\u201d She\u2019s got her blond hair pulled back in a bun again. She\u2019s looking at me all doe-eyed, trying to gain my sympathy.</p><p>\u201cVaughn, it\u2019s really not a good time.\u201d</p><p>She folds her arms across her chest and shakes her head. \u201cI\u2019m not leaving until you talk to me. All you\u2019ve done is avoid me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t talk right now, I\u2019m leaving in half an hour. I\u2019ve got a lot I need to get done and I won\u2019t be back until Monday. I\u2019ll talk to you after class on Wednesday. Just please, leave.\u201d</p><p>She doesn\u2019t move. She looks down at her hands and starts crying. Good god, she\u2019s crying! I throw my hands up in the air in frustration and walk over to the bed and sit beside her. This is horrible. This is so bad.</p><p>We\u2019re almost in the exact same predicament as we were three years ago. We were sitting on this very bed when she broke up with me. She said she couldn\u2019t imagine being nineteen and raising a child and having such big responsibilities. I was so upset with her for leaving me during such a low point in my life. I\u2019m almost just as upset with her now, but this time it\u2019s because she won\u2019t leave.</p><p>\u201cWill, I miss you. I miss Caulder. Since I saw you the first day of class, I\u2019ve done nothing but think about you and how we ended things. I was wrong. Please, just hear me out.\u201d</p><p>I sigh and throw myself back on the bed and cover my eyes with my arms. She could not have picked a worse time. Lake\u2019s going to be here in less than fifteen minutes. I need to get rid of her now.</p><p>\u201cFine, talk. Make it quick,\u201d I say.</p><p>She clears her throat and wipes the tears from her eyes. It\u2019s odd how I don\u2019t care that she\u2019s crying. How can I love someone so much for so long, then have absolutely no sympathy for them whatsoever?</p><p>\u201cI know you have a girlfriend. But I also know that you haven\u2019t been dating her near as long as you and I dated. And I know about her parents, and that she\u2019s raising her brother. People talk, Will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your point?\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cI think maybe you\u2019re with her for all the wrong reasons. Maybe you just feel sorry for her since she\u2019s going through what you went through with your family. It\u2019s not fair to her if that\u2019s why you\u2019re with her. I think you owe it to her to give you and I another shot. To see where your heart really is.\u201d</p><p>I sit up on the bed. I want to yell at her, but I take a deep breath and calm myself down. I feel sorry for her, really. \u201cVaughn, listen. You\u2019re right, I did love you. Did being the key word, here. I\u2019m in love with Lake. I would never do anything to hurt her. And you being here, it would hurt her. That\u2019s why I want you to leave. I\u2019m sorry, I know this isn\u2019t what you want to hear. But you made your choice, and I\u2019ve moved on from that choice. Now you need to move on, too. Please, do us both a favor and just go.\u201d</p><p>I stand up and walk to the bedroom door and wait for her to do the same. She stands up, but rather than follow me to the door she starts to cry again. I roll my head and walk over to her. \u201cVaughn, stop. Stop crying. I\u2019m sorry,\u201d I say, putting my arms around her. Maybe I\u2019ve been too hard on her. I know it took a lot for her to come here and apologize. If she really does still love me, I shouldn\u2019t be acting like such a jerk.</p><p>She pulls away. \u201cIt\u2019s fine, Will,\u201d she says, wiping her eyes. \u201cI\u2019m okay with it, really. I shouldn\u2019t be putting you in this predicament, anyway. I just hated how I hurt you and I wanted to say I\u2019m sorry in person. I\u2019ll go,\u201d she says. \"And...I really do want you to be happy. You deserve to be happy.\"</p><p>I can tell by the tone of her voice and the look in her eyes that she\u2019s being genuine. Finally. I know she\u2019s a good person, otherwise I wouldn\u2019t have spent two years of my life with her. But I also know the selfish side of her, and I\u2019m thankful that side didn\u2019t win tonight.</p><p>I brush the hair away from her face and wipe the tears from her cheeks. \u201cThank you, Vaughn.\u201d</p><p>She smiles and hugs me goodbye. I\u2019ll admit, it feels good finally having closure between us. I feel like I\u2019ve had closure for a while, but maybe this is what she needs. Maybe being in class with her won\u2019t be so unbearable now. I give her a quick peck on the forehead when we separate and I turn to the door.</p><p>And that\u2019s when it happens...my whole world comes crashing down around me.</p><p>She\u2019s standing in the doorway watching us, her mouth open like she\u2019s about to say something, but can\u2019t. Caulder brushes past her when he sees Vaughn standing behind me. \u201cVaughn!\u201d he says excitedly as he rushes to her and hugs her.</p><p>Lake looks into my eyes and I see it...I see her heart breaking.</p><p>I can\u2019t find my words. Lake slowly shakes her head, like she's trying to make sense of whatever she's seeing. She pulls her gaze away from mine and turns and leaves. I run after her, but she\u2019s already out the front door. I slip my shoes on and swing the door open.</p><p>\u201cLake!\u201d I yell as soon as I\u2019m outside. I reach her just as she makes it to the street. I grab her arm and turn her back around to face me. I don\u2019t know what to say. What do I say?</p><p>She\u2019s crying. I try to pull her to me but she fights me. She shoves me back and starts hitting me in the chest without saying a word. She just keeps hitting me. I grab her hands and pull her to me but she continues to try and fight me. I keep holding her until she grows weaker in my arms and starts to fall to the ground. Rather than hold her up, I melt to the snow-covered street with her and hold her as she cries. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cLake, it\u2019s nothing. I swear. It\u2019s nothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI saw you, Will. I saw you hugging her. It wasn\u2019t nothing,\u201d she cries. \u201cYou kissed her on the forehead! Why would you do that?\u201d She continues to cry. She\u2019s isn't trying to hold back her tears this time.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Lake. I\u2019m so sorry. It didn\u2019t mean anything. I was asking her to leave.\u201d</p><p>She pulls herself away from me and stands up and walks toward her house. I follow her. \u201cLake, let me explain. Please.\u201d</p> <p>She continues inside the house and slams the door in my face...and locks it. I place my hands on both sides of the doorframe and hang my head down. I\u2019ve screwed it up again. I\u2019ve really screwed it up this time.</p><p>\u201cWill, I\u2019m really sorry,\u201d Vaughn says from behind me. \u201cReally, I didn\u2019t mean to cause problems.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t turn around when I respond. \u201cVaughn, just go. Please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d she says. \u201cOne more thing, though. I know you don\u2019t want to hear this right now, but you weren\u2019t in class today. He assigned our first test for Wednesday. I copied my notes for you and put them on your coffee table. I\u2019ll see you on Wednesday.\u201d I hear the crunch of the snow beneath her feet fade as she walks back to her car.</p><p>The lock unlatches and Lake slowly opens her front door. She pulls it open just far enough so that I can see her face when she looks me in the eyes.</p> <p>\u201cShe\u2019s in your class?\u201d she says quietly.</p><p>I don\u2019t respond. My whole body flinches when she slams the door in my face. She doesn\u2019t just lock it this time; she deadbolts it and turns the entryway light out. I lean against the door and close my eyes, doing my best to hold back my own tears.</p><p>\u201cHoney, it\u2019s fine. We\u2019re taking the box with us, that way they won\u2019t be bored. We don\u2019t mind, really,\u201d my grandmother says as they pack their things in the car.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a box grandma, it\u2019s an x-box,\u201d Caulder says. He and Kel climb into the backseat.</p><p>\u201cNow you go get some rest. You\u2019ve had enough stress for one night,\u201d she says. She leans in and kisses me on the cheek. \u201cYou can pick them up on Monday.\u201d</p><p>My grandfather hugs me before he gets in the car. \u201cIf you need to talk, you can tweet me,\u201d he says.</p> <p>I watch as they drive away. Rather than go inside and get some rest, I walk back to Lake\u2019s and knock on the door, hoping she\u2019s ready to talk. I knock for five minutes, until I see her bedroom light turn off. I give up for the night and walk back to my house. I leave the front light on and the door unlocked, in case she changes her mind and wants to talk. I also decide to sleep on the couch instead of in my bedroom. If she knocks, I want to be able to hear it. I lay there for about half an hour, cussing myself. I can\u2019t believe this is happening right now. This isn't how I'd envisioned falling asleep tonight at all. I blame the damn basagna.</p><p>I jerk up when the front door opens and she walks in. She doesn\u2019t look at me as she continues across the living room. She stops at the bookshelf and reaches her hand inside the vase and pulls out a star, then turns and walks back to the front door.</p><p>\u201cLake, wait,\u201d I plead. She slams the door behind her. I get off the couch and run outside after her. \u201cPlease, just let me come over. Let me explain everything.\u201d We make our way across the street again. She keeps walking until she gets to her front door, then turns to face me.</p><p>\u201cHow are you going to explain it?\u201d she says. Her cheeks are streaked with mascara. She\u2019s heartbroken, and it\u2019s all my fault. \u201cThe one girl you\u2019ve had sex with has been sitting in class with you every day for over two weeks! Why haven\u2019t you explained that? And the very night I\u2019m about to leave with you...to make love to you... I find you in your bedroom with her? And you\u2019re kissing her on the freaking forehead!\u201d</p><p>She starts crying again so I hug her. I have to; I can\u2019t watch her cry and not hug her. She doesn\u2019t hug me back, though. She pulls away from me and looks up at me with pain in her eyes.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the one kiss of yours that I love the most, and you gave it to her,\u201d she says quietly. \u201cYou took that from me, and you gave it to her!\u201d she yells. \u201cThank you for allowing me to see the real you before making the biggest mistake of my life!\u201d</p><p>She slams the door in my face, then opens it again.</p><p>\u201cAnd where the hell is my brother!?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIn Detroit,\u201d I whisper. \u201cHe\u2019ll be back Monday.\u201d</p><p>She slams the door in my face again.</p><p>I turn around to head back to my house when Sherry appears out of nowhere. \u201cIs everything okay? I heard Layken yelling.\u201d</p><p>I walk past her without responding. When I get to my house, I slam my own door. I don\u2019t slam it hard enough, so I open it and slam it again. I do this two or three more times until I realize I\u2019ll just have to pay for it when it breaks. Instead, I shut the door and punch it. I am an asshole. I\u2019m an asshole, a jerk, a bastard, a dickhead...I give up and throw myself on the couch.</p><p>When she cries, it breaks my heart. I hate seeing her sad. But the fact that her tears are because of me now? That my own actions are responsible for her heart breaking? That\u2019s a whole new emotion I\u2019ve never experienced before. One I don\u2019t know how to deal with. I don\u2019t know what to do. I don\u2019t know what I can say to her. If she would just let me explain. But that wouldn\u2019t even help at this point. She\u2019s right. She didn\u2019t accuse me of anything I didn\u2019t actually do. God, I need my dad right now. I need his advice so bad.</p><p>Advice! I go to the vase and pull out one of the stars. I sit down on the couch and unfold it and read the words hand written across it.</p><p>\u201cSometimes two people have to fall apart, to realize how much they need to fall back together.\u201d</p><p>~Author Unknown</p><p>I fold the star back up and place it back inside the vase on the very top. I\u2019m hoping Lake picks this one next.</p><p>Saturday, January 21st, 2012</p><p>FML.</p><p>Chapter Seven</p><p>I didn\u2019t get any sleep at all last night. Every single noise I heard would bolt me right off the couch in hopes that it was Lake. It never was.</p><p>I put on a pot of coffee and walk to the window. Her house is quiet-the shades are all drawn. Her car is still in the driveway, so I know she\u2019s home. I\u2019m so used to seeing the gnomes line the driveway next to her car. They aren\u2019t there anymore, though. After her mother died, Lake gathered all the gnomes and threw them in the trash. She doesn\u2019t know it, but I dug one out and kept it. The one with the broken red hat.</p><p>I remember walking out of my house the morning after they moved here and seeing her dart out the front door with no jacket...in house shoes. I knew as soon as those shoes hit the pavement, she was going to bust her butt. Sure enough, she did. I couldn\u2019t help but laugh. Southerners seem to underestimate the power of cold weather.</p><p>I hated that she had cut herself when she landed on the gnome, but was so happy I had the excuse to spend those few minutes with her that morning. After I put the bandage on her and she left, I spent the entire day at work in a daze. I couldn\u2019t stop thinking about her. I was so nervous my life and the responsibilities I had would scare her off before I got the chance to know her. I didn\u2019t want to tell her about it right away, but the night of our first date I knew I had to tell her. There was something about her that was so much more than all the other girls I\u2019ve known. She had this resiliency and confidence about her.</p><p>I wanted to be sure that Lake knew what my life was about that night. I wanted her to know about my parents, about Caulder, about my passion. I needed her to know the real me, and understand who I was before we took it any further. When she watched her first performance that night, I couldn\u2019t take my eyes off of her. I saw the passion and depth in her eyes as she watched the stage, and I fell in love with her. I\u2019ve loved her every second since.</p><p>Which is why I refuse to let her give up.</p><p>I\u2019m on my fourth cup of coffee when Kiersten walks in. She doesn\u2019t check to see if Caulder\u2019s here, she just walks straight to the couch and plops down beside me.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d she says flatly.</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on with you and Layken?\u201d she asks. She looks at me like she deserves an answer.</p><p>\u201cKiersten? Hasn\u2019t your mother ever told you it\u2019s rude to be nosey?\u201d</p><p>She shakes her head. \u201cNo, she says the only way to get the facts is to ask the questions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you can ask as many questions as you want. That doesn\u2019t mean I have to answer them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d she says, standing up. \u201cI\u2019ll go ask Layken.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood luck getting her to open the door.\u201d</p><p>Kiersten leaves and I jump up and go to the window. She gets halfway down my driveway and turns around and heads back to my front door. When she passes my window, she looks at me with pity and slowly shakes her head. She opens the front door and comes back inside. \u201cIs there anything in particular you want me to ask her? I can report back to you.\u201d</p><p>I love this kid. \u201cYeah, good idea Kiersten.\u201d I think for a second. \u201cI don\u2019t know, just gauge her mood. Is she crying? Is she mad? Act like you don\u2019t know we\u2019re fighting and ask her about me...see what she says.\u201d</p><p>Kiersten nods and starts to shut the front door.</p><p>\u201cWait, one more thing. I want to know what she\u2019s wearing, too.\u201d</p><p>Kiersten eyes me curiously.</p><p>\u201cJust her shirt. I want to know what shirt she has on.\u201d</p><p>I wait by the window and watch as Kiersten walks across the street and knocks on her door. Why does she knock on Lake\u2019s door and not mine? The door opens almost immediately. Kiersten walks inside and the door shuts behind her.</p><p>I pace the living room and drink another cup of coffee, watching out the window, waiting for Kiersten to emerge from Lake's house. A half hour goes by and the front door finally opens. Kiersten walks outside and turns left and heads to her house rather than walking back across the street.</p><p>I give her a while. Maybe she had to go home to eat lunch or something. After an hour passes, I can\u2019t wait any longer. I make a beeline to Kiersten\u2019s house and knock on the door.</p><p>\u201cHey Will, come on in,\u201d Sherry says. She steps aside and I make my way into the living room. Kiersten\u2019s watching T.V. Before I bombard Kiersten, I turn to Sherry.</p><p>\u201cLast night...I\u2019m sorry. I wasn\u2019t trying to be rude.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, stop it. I was just being nosey,\u201d she says. \u201cYou want something to drink?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m good. I just need to talk to Kiersten.\u201d</p><p>Kiersten looks over at me from the couch and gives me a dirty look. \u201cYou\u2019re a jerk, Will.\u201d she says.</p><p>I guess Lake\u2019s not over it. I sit down beside her on the couch and put my hands between my knees. \u201cWill you at least tell me what she said?\u201d This is so pathetic. I\u2019m entrusting my relationship to an eleven-year-old.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure you want to know? I should probably warn you, I have an excellent memory. Mom says I\u2019ve been able to quote entire conversations verbatim since I was three years old.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cPositive. I want to know everything she said.\u201d</p><p>Kiersten sighs and pulls her legs up on the couch and turns toward me. \u201cShe thinks you\u2019re a jerk. She said you were an asshole, a dickhead, a bas-\u201d</p><p>\u201cA bastard. I know, I get it. What else did she say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe didn\u2019t tell me why she was mad at you...but she\u2019s really mad at you. I don\u2019t know what you did, but she\u2019s at her house right now cleaning like a psycho! When she opened the door, she had hundreds of index cards all over the living room floor. It looked like recipes or something.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh god, she\u2019s alphabetizing,\u201d I say. This is worse than I thought. \u201cKiersten, she won\u2019t answer the door if I go over there. Will you knock so she\u2019ll open the door? I really need to talk to her.\u201d</p><p>Kiersten presses her lips together as she thinks about my question. \u201cYou\u2019re asking me to trick her? To basically lie to her?\u201d</p><p>I shrug my shoulders and nod.</p><p>\u201cLet me get my coat.\u201d</p><p>I stand up and Sherry comes from the kitchen and holds out her hand. I hold open my palm and she puts something in it and folds my fingers over it. \u201cIf it doesn\u2019t go the way you\u2019re hoping, take these with some water. You look like shit.\u201d</p> <p>She can see the hesitation in my face and she smiles. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I made them. They\u2019re completely legal.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t really have a plan of attack. I\u2019m hiding against the wall in front of Lake's house when Kiersten knocks. My heart is beating so fast, I feel like I\u2019m about to commit a robbery or something. I take a deep breath when I hear the door open. Kiersten steps aside and I brush past her and slip inside Lake\u2019s house faster than she can realize what happened.</p><p>\u201cGet out, Will,\u201d she says as she holds the door open and points outside.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not leaving until you talk to me,\u201d I say. I back further into the living room.</p><p>\u201cGet out! Get out, get out, get out!\u201d</p><p>I do what any sane male would do in this situation; I run down the hallway and lock myself in her bedroom. I realize I still don\u2019t have a plan. I don\u2019t know how I can talk to her if I\u2019m locked up in her bedroom. But at least she can\u2019t kick me out of her house now. I\u2019ll stay here all day if I have to.</p> <p>I hear the front door slam and within seconds she\u2019s standing outside the bedroom door. I wait for her to say something or to yell at me, but she doesn\u2019t. I watch the shadow of her feet disappear as she walks away.</p><p>What now? If I open the door, she\u2019ll just try to kick me out again. Why didn\u2019t I formulate a better plan? I\u2019m an idiot. I\u2019m a freaking idiot! Think, Will. Think.</p><p>I see the shadow of her feet reappear and she pauses in front of her bedroom door again.</p><p>\u201cWill? Open the door. I\u2019ll talk to you.\u201d</p><p>She doesn\u2019t sound angry. My idiotic plan actually worked? I unlock the door to her bedroom and as soon as I open it all the way, I\u2019m completely drenched in water. She just threw water on me! She threw an entire pitcher of water in my face!</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d she says. \u201cYou look a little wet, Will. You better go home and change before you get sick.\u201d She calmly turns and walks away.</p><p>I\u2019m an idiot, and she\u2019s not ready to give in. I make the walk of shame down her hallway, out the front door and across the street to my house. It\u2019s freezing. She didn\u2019t even bother warming the water before she threw it at me. I take off my clothes and get in the shower. A hot shower this time.</p><p>The shower didn\u2019t help at all. I feel like complete crap. Five cups of coffee and no sleep on an empty stomach doesn\u2019t make for a great start to the day. It\u2019s almost two o\u2019clock in the afternoon. If I wasn\u2019t such an idiot, I wonder what Lake and I would be doing right now? Who am I kidding? I know what we\u2019d be doing right now. My reflection on our turn of events over the past twenty-four hours causes my head to hurt. I pick my pants up off the bedroom floor and reach inside the pocket, pulling out whatever it is that Sherry gave me. I walk to the kitchen and down the medicine with an entire glass of water before going to the couch.</p> <p>It\u2019s dark when I wake up. I don\u2019t even remember lying down. I sit up on the couch and spot a note on the coffee table. I reach over and snatch it up and begin to read it. My heart sinks when I realize it\u2019s not from Lake.</p><p>Will,</p><p>I was going to warn you not to drive after you take the medicine...but I see you already took it. So, never mind.</p><p>~Sherry</p><p>P.S. I had a talk with Layken today. You really should apologize, you know. That was kind of a dick move on your part. If you need any more medicine, you know where I live. \uf04a</p><p>I toss the letter back onto the table. Was the smiley face really necessary? I wince as the cramps in my stomach intensify. When was the last time I ate something? I honestly can\u2019t remember. I open the refrigerator and see the basagna from the night before. Unfortunately, it\u2019s now the perfect night for basagna. I cut a section out and throw it on a plate and toss it in the microwave. As I\u2019m filling a glass with soda, the front door swings open.</p><p>She\u2019s walking across the room, heading for the bookshelf. I dart into the living room just when she reaches it. She\u2019s still ignoring me. Rather than reaching in for a single star this time, she grabs the entire vase off the bookshelf.</p><p>She is not taking this vase with her. If she takes the vase with her, she won\u2019t have a reason to come back. I grab the vase out of her hands, but she won\u2019t let go. We tug back and forth, but I\u2019m not letting go. I\u2019m not letting her take it. She finally releases her grasp and crosses her arms across her chest as she glares at me.</p><p>\u201cGive it to me, Will. My mother made it and I want to take it home with me.\u201d</p><p>I walk back to the kitchen with the vase...she follows me. I set it in the corner of the countertop against the wall and I turn around and place my arms on either side of it so she can\u2019t reach it.</p><p>\u201cYour mother made it for both of us. I know you, Lake. If you take this home you\u2019ll open every single one of them tonight. You\u2019ll be opening stars all night just like you carve pumpkins.\u201d</p><p>She throws her hands up in the air and groans. \u201cStop saying that! Please! I don\u2019t carve pumpkins anymore!\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t believe she thinks she doesn\u2019t carve pumpkins anymore. \u201cYou don\u2019t? Really? You\u2019re carving them right now, Lake. It\u2019s been twenty-four hours and you still won\u2019t let me talk to you about it.\u201d</p><p>She wads her hands into fists and stomps her feet in frustration. \u201cUgh!\u201d she yells. She looks like she wants to hit something. Or someone. God, she\u2019s so beautiful.</p><p>\u201cStop looking at me like that!\u201d she snaps.</p><p>\u201cLike what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got that look in your eyes again. Just stop!\u201d</p><p>I have absolutely no idea what look she\u2019s talking about, but I divert my attention away from her. I don\u2019t want to do anything to piss her off even more.</p><p>\u201cHave you eaten anything today?\u201d I ask. I take my plate out of the microwave but she doesn\u2019t answer me. She just stands in the kitchen with her arms folded across her chest. I pull the pan of basagna out of the refrigerator and fold back the tinfoil.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re eating basagna? How appropriate,\u201d she says.</p><p>It\u2019s not the conversation I was hoping we would have, but it\u2019s conversation nonetheless. I cut another square of basagna and put it in the microwave. Neither of us says anything while it cooks. She just stands there, staring at the floor. I just stand here, staring at the microwave. When it\u2019s finished cooking, I put our plates on the bar and make another drink. We both sit down and eat in silence. Very uncomfortable silence.</p><p>When we\u2019re finished, I clear off the bar and sit across from her so I can see her better. I wait for her to speak first. She has her elbows resting on the bar while she stares down at her nails, picking at them, attempting to look uninterested.</p><p>\u201cSo, talk,\u201d she says evenly, without looking up at me.</p><p>I reach my hands across the bar to touch hers, but she pulls them away and leans back in her chair. I don\u2019t like the barrier of the bar between us so I get up and walk to the living room.</p><p>\u201cCome sit,\u201d I say to her. She walks to the living room and sits on the same couch as me, but at the opposite end. I rub my face with my hands, trying to sort out just how I\u2019m going to make her forgive me. I pull my leg up on the couch and turn to face her.</p><p>\u201cLake, I love you. The last thing in the world I want to do is hurt you. You know that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, congratulations,\" she says. \"You just succeeded with accomplishing the last thing in the world you wanted to do.\u201d</p><p>I lean my head back into the couch. This is going to be harder than I thought. She\u2019s tough to crack.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t tell you she was in my class. I didn\u2019t want you to worry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWorry about what, Will? Is her being in class with you something I should worry about? Because if it\u2019s nothing like you say it is, why would I need to worry?\u201d</p><p>Jesus! Am I picking the worst ways in the world to apologize or is she just that good? If she ever stops being mad at me, I\u2019ll tell her I think she\u2019s finally figured out her major; pre-law.</p><p>\u201cLake, I don\u2019t feel that way about Vaughn anymore. I was planning to tell you about her being in my class next week...I just didn\u2019t want to bring it up before our getaway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. So you wanted to make sure you got laid before you pissed me off. Good plan,\u201d she says sarcastically.</p><p>I slap my forehead with my hand and close my eyes. There isn\u2019t a fight this girl couldn\u2019t win.</p><p>\u201cThink about it, Will. Put yourself in my shoes. Let\u2019s say I had sex with a guy before I met you. Then right when you and I were about to have sex, you walk into my bedroom and I\u2019m hugging this guy. Then you see me kiss him...on the neck; your favorite place to be kissed by me. Then you find out I\u2019ve been seeing this guy every other day for weeks and I\u2019ve kept it a secret. What would you do? Huh?\u201d</p><p>She's not picking at her nails anymore. She's glaring right at me, waiting on my response.</p><p>\"Well,\" I say. \u201cI would allow you the chance to explain without interrupting you every five seconds.\u201d</p><p>She flips me off and jerks herself off the couch and starts toward the front door. I grab her arm when she passes me and I pull her back down onto the couch. When she falls into the spot next to me, I wrap my arms around her and press her head into my chest. I try not to let her go. I don\u2019t want her to go. \u201cLake, please. Just give me a chance, I\u2019ll tell you everything. Don\u2019t leave again.\u201d</p><p>She doesn\u2019t struggle to pull away. She doesn\u2019t fight me, either. She relaxes into my chest and lets me hold her while I talk.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know if you even knew about Vaughn. I know how much you hate talking about past relationships, so I thought it would be worse if I brought it up than if I didn\u2019t. That\u2019s why I didn\u2019t bring it up. Seeing her again meant nothing to me. I didn\u2019t want it to mean anything to you, either.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I run my fingers through her hair and she sighs, then starts crying into my shirt.</p><p>\u201cI want to believe you, Will. I want to believe you so bad. But why was she here last night? If she doesn\u2019t still mean something to you, why were you holding her?\u201d</p><p>I kiss her on top of the head. \u201cLake, I was asking her to leave. She was crying so I hugged her.\u201d</p><p>She pulls her face away from my chest and looks up at me, frightened. \u201cShe was crying? Why was she crying? Will, does she still love you?\u201d</p> <p>I sigh. How do I answer that without coming off like a jerk again? Nothing I\u2019m saying right now is helping my cause. Nothing at all.</p><p>She sits up and scoots away from me so she can turn towards me as she speaks. \u201cWill, you\u2019re the one that wanted to talk. I want you to tell me everything. I want to know why she was here, what you were doing in your bedroom with her, why you were hugging her, why she was crying...everything.\u201d</p><p>I reach over and take her hand but she pulls it back again. \u201cTell me,\u201d she says.</p><p>I try to think of where to begin. I inhale a deep breath and exhale slowly, preparing to be interrupted a million more times.</p><p>\u201cShe wrote me a note in class the other day and asked if we could talk. I told her no, that there was nothing to say. She just showed up last night out of the blue. I didn\u2019t let her in, Lake. I was in my bedroom when she got here. I would have never let her in.\u201d I look her in the eyes when I say that, because it\u2019s the truth.</p> <p>\u201cMy grandmother wanted her to eat with us and I told her no and said I needed to talk to her. I just wanted her to leave. She started crying and told me she hated how she ended things with me. She said she knew about you and our whole situation with our parents and us raising our brothers. She said I \u2018owed it to you\u2019 to find out where my heart really lies, and that maybe I was with you because I felt sorry for you, since I've been in your shoes before. She wanted me to give her another chance, to see if I was with you for the right reasons. I told her no. I told her I loved you, Lake. I asked her to leave and she started crying again so I hugged her. I felt like I was being a jerk, that\u2019s the only reason why I hugged her.\u201d</p><p>I watch for some sort of reaction to my confession, but she just looks down at her lap so that I'm unable to see her face. \u201cWhy did you kiss her on the forehead?\u201d she asks softly.</p><p>I sigh and stroke her cheek with the back of my hand, pulling her focus back in my direction. \u201cLake, I don\u2019t know. You\u2019ve got to understand that I dated her for over two years. There are some things that, no matter how long it\u2019s been, it\u2019s just habit. It didn\u2019t mean anything, it was just habit. I was just consoling her.\u201d</p><p>Lake lies back onto the arm of the couch and stares up at the ceiling while she thinks. All I can do is just let her think. I\u2019ve told her everything. I watch her as she lies there, not saying a word. I want so bad to lie down beside her and hold her. It\u2019s killing me that I can\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cDo you think there\u2019s a chance that she\u2019s right?\u201d she asks, still staring at the ceiling.</p><p>\u201cRight about what? That she loves me? Maybe, I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t care. It doesn\u2019t change anything.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t mean about that. It\u2019s obvious she still wants to be with you, she said it herself. I mean do you think there\u2019s a chance she could be right about the other thing? About the possibility of you being with me because of our situation? Because you feel sorry for me.\u201d</p><p>I spring forward on the couch and climb on top of her and grasp her jaw, pulling her face to mine. \u201cDon\u2019t, Lake. Don\u2019t you dare think that for a second!\u201d</p><p>She squeezes her eyes shut and tears slide down over her temples, into her hair. I kiss them. I kiss her face and her tears and her eyes and her cheeks and her lips. I need her to know that it\u2019s not true. I need her to know how much I love her.</p><p>\u201cWill, stop,\u201d she says weakly. I can hear her cry being suppressed in her throat; I can see it in her face. She doubts me.</p><p>\u201cBaby, no. Don\u2019t believe that. Please don\u2019t believe that.\u201d I press my head into the crevice between her shoulder and her neck. \u201cI love you because of you.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019ve never needed anyone to believe anything more in my entire life. I need her to believe me. When she starts to resist and push against me, I slip my arm underneath her neck and pull her closer. \u201cLake, stop this. Please don\u2019t go,\u201d I beg. I realize as I\u2019m speaking that my voice is shaking. I\u2019ve never been so scared I was about to lose something in my entire life, that I completely lose control. I start to cry.</p><p>\u201cWill, don\u2019t you see it?\u201d she says. \u201cHow do you know? How do you really know? You couldn\u2019t leave me now if you wanted to. Your heart is too good for that, you would never do that to me. So how do I know if you would really be here if our circumstances were different? If our parents were alive and we didn\u2019t have Kel and Caulder, how do you know you would even love me?\u201d</p><p>I clasp my hand over her mouth. \u201cNo! Stop saying that, Lake. Please.\u201d She closes her eyes and her tears start flowing even faster. I kiss them again. I kiss her cheek and I kiss her forehead and I kiss her lips. I grasp the back of her head and I kiss her with more desperation than I\u2019ve ever kissed her before. She puts her hands on my neck and kisses me back.</p> <p>She\u2019s kissing me back.</p><p>We\u2019re both still crying, frantically trying to hold on to the last bit of sanity between us. She pushes against me. She\u2019s still kissing me, but she wants me to sit up, so I do. I lean back into the couch and she slides onto my lap and strokes my face with her hands. We stop kissing for a brief moment and look at each other. I wipe tears away from her face and she does the same for me. I can still see the heartache in her eyes but she squeezes them shut and brings her lips back to mine. I pull her into me so close that it makes it hard to breathe. We\u2019re both gasping for air as we try to find a constant rhythm amidst our frantic struggle. I have never needed her with more intensity than I need her right now. She pulls at my shirt so I lean forward, allowing her to slip it off over my head. When her lips separate from mine, she crosses her arms and grasps the hem of her shirt and pulls it over her head. I help her. When her shirt is on top of mine in the floor, I wrap my arms around her, placing my hands on the bare skin of her back, and I pull her into me.</p><p>\u201cI love you, Lake. I\u2019m so sorry. I\u2019m so, so sorry. I love you so much.\u201d</p><p>She pulls back and looks me in the eyes. \"I want you to make love to me, Will.\"</p><p>I wrap my arms tightly around her back and stand up as she clings to my neck. She wraps her legs around my waist and I carry her to my bedroom and we collapse onto the bed. Her hands find the button of my jeans and she unbuttons them as my mouth slowly moves from her lips to her chin and down her neck. I can't believe this is actually happening. I don't allow myself time to second guess my own actions. I slide my fingers under the straps of her bra and pull them down off of her shoulders. She slides her arms out of the straps and I move my lips along the edge of her bra when she begins to struggle with the button on her own jeans. I lift up to assist her, then I guide her hands as we slide them off and toss them behind me onto the floor. She scoots further up onto the bed until her head meets the pillows. I pull the covers out from beneath her and slide on top of her, then pull the covers back on top of us. When our eyes meet, I see the heartache behind her expression and the tears still streaming down her face. She grasps at the waist of my jeans and begins to slide them down when I pull her hands away. She\u2019s hurting so much. She\u2019s still heartbroken. I can't let her do this. She still doesn't trust me.</p><p>\u201cLake, I can\u2019t.\u201d I roll off of her and try to catch my breath. \u201cNot like this. You\u2019re upset. It shouldn\u2019t be like this.\u201d</p><p>She doesn\u2019t say anything...she just continues to cry. We both lie next to one another for several minutes without saying a single word. I reach over to put my hand on top of hers but she pulls it away and slides off the bed. She picks her jeans up off the floor and walks back into the living room. I follow her and watch while she puts her shirt and pants back on. She sucks in a couple of breaths in an attempt to hold back her tears.</p><p>\u201cAre you leaving?\u201d I ask hesitantly. \"I don\u2019t want you to go. Stay with me.\u201d</p><p>She doesn\u2019t respond. She goes to the door and slips her shoes on, then her jacket. I walk over to her and wrap my arms around her. \u201cYou can\u2019t be mad at me for this. You aren\u2019t thinking clearly, Lake. If we do this while you're angry, you\u2019ll regret it tomorrow. Then you\u2019ll be mad at yourself, too. You understand that, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>She wipes tears from her eyes and steps away from me. \u201cYou\u2019ve had sex with her, Will. How do I get past that? How do I get past the fact that you\u2019ve made love to Vaughn, but you won\u2019t make love to me? You don\u2019t know how it feels to be rejected. It feels like shit. You just made me feel like shit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLake, that\u2019s absurd! I\u2019m not rejecting you. I love you too much for it not to be perfect for you. I\u2019m not about to have sex with you for the first time while you\u2019re crying. If we do this now, we\u2019ll both feel like shit.\u201d</p><p>She rubs her hands across her eyes again and looks down at the floor, attempting not to cry. We stand quietly in the living room, neither of us sure what happens next. I\u2019ve said all I can say. I just need her to believe me, so I give her time to think.</p><p>\u201cWill?\u201d She slowly brings her eyes back up to meet mine. It looks almost like it hurts her to even look at me. \u201cI\u2019m not sure I can do this,\" she says.</p><p>The look in her eyes makes my heart feel like it's come to a literal stop. I've seen this look in a girl before. She's about to break up with me.</p><p>\"I mean...I\u2019m not sure I can do us,\" she says. \"I\u2019m trying so hard, but I don\u2019t know how to get past this. How do I know this life is what you want? How do you know this is what you want? You need time, Will. We need time to think about it. We have to question everything.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t respond. I can\u2019t. Everything I say comes out wrong.</p><p>She\u2019s not crying anymore. \u201cI\u2019m going home now. I need you to let me go. Just let me go, okay?\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s the clear headedness behind her voice and the calm, reasonable expression in her eyes that rips the heart right out of my chest. She turns to leave, and all I can do is let her go. I just let her go.</p><p>After an hour of punching everything I can find to punch, cleaning everything I can find to clean and screaming every cussword I can think to scream, I knock on Sherry\u2019s door. When she opens it, she looks at me and doesn\u2019t say a word. She turns back inside and comes back a moment later and holds out her fist. I open my palm and she drops the pills in my hand and looks at me with pity. I hate pity.</p><p>When I\u2019m back inside my house, I swallow the pills and lay on the couch, wishing it all away.</p><p>\u201cWill.\u201d</p><p>I try to open my eyes, to make sense of the voice I\u2019m hearing. I try to move, but my entire body feels like concrete. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDude, wake up.\u201d</p><p>I'm discombobulated. I sit up on the couch and rub my eyes, attempting to open them...scared of the sunlight. When I finally do open them, it\u2019s not bright at all, it\u2019s still dark. I look around the room and see Gavin sitting on the couch across from me.</p><p>\u201cWhat time is it? What day is it?\u201d I ask him.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s still today. Saturday. It\u2019s after ten I think. How long have you been out?\u201d</p> <p>I think about that question. It was after seven when Lake and I had basagna. After eight when I let her go. When I just let her go. I lie back on the couch and don\u2019t answer Gavin as the scene from just two hours ago replays in my head.</p><p>\u201cYou want to talk about it?\u201d Gavin asks.</p><p>I shake my head again. I really don\u2019t want to talk about it.</p><p>\u201cEddie\u2019s over at Layken\u2019s house. She seemed pretty upset. It was a little awkward so I thought I\u2019d come hide out here. You want me to leave?\u201d</p><p>I shake my head again. \u201cThere\u2019s basagna in the fridge if you\u2019re hungry.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI am, actually,\u201d he says. He gets off the couch and walks to the kitchen. \u201cYou need something to drink?\u201d</p><p>I do. I do need a drink. I walk to the kitchen and press my hand against my forehead. My head is pounding. I reach above the refrigerator and move the boxes of cereal out of the way to get to the cabinet behind it. I pull out the bottle of tequila and grab a shot glass and pour myself a drink.</p><p>\u201cI was thinking more along the lines of a soda,\u201d Gavin says as he sits down at the bar and watches me down a shot.</p><p>\u201cGood idea.\u201d I open the refrigerator and pull out a soda. I grab an even bigger glass and mix the soda with the tequila. Not the best mix, but it helps it go down smoother.</p><p>\u201cWill? I\u2019ve never seen you like this. You sure you\u2019re okay?\u201d</p><p>I tilt my head back and finish the entire drink, then put the glass in the sink. I choose not to answer him. If I say yes, he\u2019ll know I\u2019m lying. If I say no, he\u2019ll ask me why. So I just sit down next to him while he eats, and I don\u2019t say a thing.</p> <p>\u201cEddie and I wanted to talk to you and Layken together. I guess right now that\u2019s not going to happen, so...\u201d Gavin\u2019s voice trails off and he takes another bite of basagna.</p><p>\u201cTalk to us about what?\u201d</p><p>He wipes his mouth with a napkin and sighs. He brings his right arm down to the table, gripping his fork with his hand so tight that his knuckles turn white. \u201cEddie\u2019s pregnant.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t trust my own ears at this point. My head is still pounding and the alcohol mixed with the homemade concoction Sherry gave me is causing me to see two of Gavin.</p><p>\u201cPregnant? How pregnant?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cPretty damn pregnant,\u201d he says.</p><p>\u201cShit.\u201d I stand up and grab the tequila off the counter and re-fill the shot glass. I normally don\u2019t promote underage drinking, but there are occasionally times when even I push my boundaries. I place the shot in front of him and he downs it.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the plan?\u201d I ask.</p> <p>He walks to the living room and sits back down on the third couch. When did I get a third couch? I swipe the bottle of tequila off the counter and rub my eyes as I make my way into the living room. When I open them, there are only two couches again. I hurry up and sit down before I fall.</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t have a plan. The same plan, anyway. Eddie wants to keep it. It scares the shit out of me, Will. We're only nineteen. We\u2019re not prepared for this at all. \u201d</p><p>Unfortunately, I know exactly how he feels.</p><p>\u201cDo you want to keep it?\u201d I ask.</p><p>Sunday, January 21st...I think. It might still be Saturday night. Whatever. WTF ever.</p><p>Lake...Lake, Lake, Lake, Lake. I\u2019d take a mountain and then I need another drink. But I love you so much. Yeah I think I need more tequila...and more cowbell. I love you I\u2019m so sorry. I\u2019m not thirsty. But I\u2019m not hungry, just thirsty. But I\u2019m never drinking another cheeseburger again I love you so much.</p><p>Chapter Eight</p><p>Eddie\u2019s pregnant. Gavin\u2019s scared. I let Lake go. That\u2019s all I remember about last night.</p><p>The sun is brighter than it\u2019s ever been. I throw the covers off and head to the bathroom. When I make it across the hall, I try to open the door but it\u2019s locked. Why the hell is my bathroom door locked? I knock, which feels extremely odd-knocking on my own bathroom door when I should be the only person in my house.</p><p>\u201cJust a sec!\u201d I hear someone yell. It\u2019s a guy. It\u2019s not Gavin. What the hell is going on? I walk to the living room and see a blanket and pillow on the couch. There are shoes by the front door, next to a suitcase. I\u2019m scratching my head when the bathroom door opens, so I turn around.</p><p>\u201cReece?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMornin',\u201d he says.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d I ask him.</p><p>He shoots me a confused look as he walks to the couch and sits down. \u201cAre you kidding?\u201d he asks.</p><p>Why would I be kidding? What would I be kidding about? I haven\u2019t seen him in over a year.</p><p>\u201cNo. What are you doing here? When did you get here?\u201d</p><p>He shakes his head with the same bewildered expression across his face. \u201cWill, do you not remember anything from last night?\u201d</p><p>I sit down and try to remember. Eddie\u2019s pregnant. Gavin\u2019s scared. I let Lake go. That\u2019s all I remember. He can see from the struggle in my face that I need a refresher.</p><p>\u201cI got back last Friday. My mom kicked me out? I needed a place to stay last night and you told me I could stay here. You really don\u2019t remember?\u201d</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Reece. I don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>He laughs. \u201cDude, how much did you have to drink last night?\u201d</p><p>I think back on the tequila, then remember the medicine Sherry gave me. \u201cI don\u2019t think it was just the alcohol.\u201d</p><p>He stands up and looks awkwardly around the room. \u201cWell, if you want me to leave...\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. No, I don\u2019t mind you staying here, you know that. I just don\u2019t remember. I\u2019ve never blacked out before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou weren\u2019t making much sense when I got here, that\u2019s for sure. You kept saying something about a star...and a lake. I thought you were cracked out. You\u2019re not cracked out...are you?\u201d</p><p>I laugh. \u201cNo, I\u2019m not cracked out. I\u2019m just having a really shitty weekend. The worst. And no, I don\u2019t feel like talking about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, since you don\u2019t remember anything about last night...you kind of told me I could live here? For a month or two? Does that ring a bell?\u201d Reece raises his eyebrows and waits for my reaction.</p><p>Now I know why I never drink. I always end up agreeing to things that I normally wouldn\u2019t agree to when I\u2019m sober. I can\u2019t really think of a reason not to let him stay here. We do have an extra bedroom. He practically lived here when we were growing up. Although I haven\u2019t seen him since his last break from deployment, I still consider him my best friend.</p><p>\u201cStay as long as you need to,\u201d I say. \u201cJust don't expect me to be much fun. I'm not having a very good week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cObviously.\u201d He grabs his bags and shoes and takes them down the hallway to the spare bedroom. I walk to the window and look across the street at Lake\u2019s house. Her car is gone. Where would she be? She doesn\u2019t really go anywhere on Sunday\u2019s. They\u2019re her movies and junk food days. I\u2019m still watching out the window when Reece walks back into the living room.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have shit to eat,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m hungry. You want me to grab you anything at the store?\u201d</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cI don\u2019t feel like eating,\u201d I say. \u201cJust get whatever. I\u2019ll probably go later this afternoon, anyway. I need a few things before Caulder gets back tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh yeah, where is that little twerp?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDetroit.\u201d</p><p>Reece slips his shoes and his jacket on and slips out the front door. I walk to the kitchen to make coffee, but there\u2019s already a full pot. Nice.</p><p>As soon as I step out of the shower, I hear the front door open. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s Reece or Lake, so I rush to pull my pants on to see if it\u2019s Lake. When I emerge from the hallway, she\u2019s holding the vase in her hands, making her way to the front door. When she sees me, she speeds up.</p><p>\u201cDammit, Lake!\u201d I cut her off in the living room and don\u2019t let her by. \u201cYou aren\u2019t taking it. Don\u2019t make me hide it from you.\u201d</p><p>She tries to shove her way past me but I block her again. \u201cYou have no right to keep them at your house, Will! It\u2019s just your excuse to make me keep coming over here!\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s right. She\u2019s absolutely right...but I don\u2019t care. \u201cNo, I want them over here because I don\u2019t trust that you won\u2019t open them all.\u201d</p><p>She shoots me a dirty look. \u201cWhile we\u2019re on the subject of trust, are you sabotaging these? Are you putting fake ones in here, trying to get me to forgive you?\u201d</p><p>I laugh. She must be getting some great advice from her mom if she thinks I\u2019m sabotaging the stars. \u201cMaybe you should listen to your mother\u2019s advice, Lake.\u201d</p><p>She tries to brush past me again so I grab the vase from her hands. She jerks it away harder than I expect and the vase slips and lands on the floor, spilling out dozens of tiny stars onto the carpet. She bends down and starts scooping them up. Her hands are full and I can see on her face that she doesn\u2019t know where to put them since her pants don\u2019t have pockets. She pulls the collar of her shirt out and starts shoving them inside by the handful. She\u2019s determined.</p><p>I grab her hands and pull them away from her shirt. \u201cLake, stop it! You\u2019re acting like a ten year old!\u201d I set the vase upright and start throwing the rest of them inside as fast as she\u2019s grabbing them, stuffing them inside her shirt. I do the only thing I can...I reach my hand down her shirt and start grabbing them back. She slaps at my hands and tries to crawl backwards but I grab the back of her shirt to stop her. She continues to back away as I continue holding onto her shirt until it slips over her head and it\u2019s resting in my hands. She gathers more stars and stands and heads toward the front door with her hands clasped to her bra, still trying to hold on to them.</p><p>\u201cLake, you aren\u2019t going outside without a shirt on,\u201d I say. She\u2019s relentless.</p><p>\u201cWatch me!\u201d she says. I jump up and wrap my arms around her waist and pick her up. Just as I\u2019m about to release her onto the couch, the front door swings open. I look over my shoulder and Reece walks in with a handful of groceries. He pauses and stares at us wide-eyed.</p><p>Lake is still trying to struggle to free herself from my grasp, ignoring the fact that someone she doesn't even know has a front row seat to her tantrum. The only thing I can think of is the fact that she\u2019s in her bra in front of another guy. I pick her up higher and toss her over the back of the couch. Just as fast as she\u2019s on the couch, she\u2019s back up again, trying to make her way past me. She finally notices Reece standing in the doorway.</p><p>\u201cWho the hell are you?\u201d she yells as she slaps at my arm that\u2019s holding her back. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He responds cautiously. \u201cReece? I live here?\u201d he says.</p><p>Lake stops struggling and folds her arms across her chest with an embarrassed look on her face. I take the opportunity to grab most of the stars out of her hands and I toss them back toward the vase. I reach down and pick her shirt up and shove it into her chest. \u201cPut your shirt on!\u201d I snap.</p><p>\u201cUgh!\u201d She throws the rest of the stars on the floor and turns her shirt right side out. \u201cYou\u2019re such a jerk, Will! You have no right to keep these here!\u201d She pulls her shirt over her head and turns to Reece. \u201cAnd when the hell did you get a roommate?\u201d</p><p>Reece just stares at her, still wide-eyed. He has no idea what to make of the scene going down before him. Lake walks back to the center of the room and grabs a small handful of stars, then turns and rushes toward the front door. Reece steps aside as she moves passed him and goes outside. We both watch as she crosses the street, stopping twice to pick up stars she drops in the snow. When she shuts her door behind her, Reece turns to me.</p> <p>\u201cMan, she\u2019s feisty. And cute,\u201d he says.</p><p>\u201cAnd mine,\u201d I reply.</p><p>While Reece is cooking us lunch, I crawl around the living room and pick up all the stars that scattered. After I think I have them all, I take the vase to the kitchen to hide it in the cabinet. If she can\u2019t find it, she\u2019ll have to speak to me to ask me where it is.</p><p>\u201cWhat are those, anyway?\u201d Reece asks.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re from her mother,\u201d I say. \u201cLong story.\u201d</p> <p>She might find them too easily if I hide them in such an obvious spot. I move the cereal again and place the vase right behind the tequila.</p><p>\u201cSo is this chick your girlfriend?\u201d Reece says.</p><p>I\u2019m not sure how to answer his question. I don\u2019t know how to put a label on what\u2019s going on between us. \u201cYep,\u201d I say.</p><p>He cocks his head at me. \u201cDoesn\u2019t seem like she likes you very much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe loves me. She just doesn\u2019t like me right now.\u201d</p><p>He laughs. \u201cWhat\u2019s her name?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLayken. I call her Lake,\u201d I say as I pour myself a drink. A non-alcoholic drink this time.</p><p>He laughs. \u201cThat explains your incoherent rambling last night.\u201d He spoons some pasta into our bowls and we sit at the table to eat.</p><p>\u201cSo, what\u2019d you do to piss her off so bad?\u201d</p><p>I rest my elbows on the table and drop my fork into my bowl. I guess now is as good a time as any to fill him in on the last year of my life. He\u2019s been my best friend since we were ten, minus the last couple of years or so. We kind of grew apart after he left for the army. I still trust him, though. So I tell him everything. The entire story. From the day we met, to her first day at school, to our fight about Vaughn, all the way up to last night. When I finish, he\u2019s on his second bowl of pasta and I haven\u2019t even touched mine.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d he says, stirring his pasta around in his bowl. \u201cYou think you\u2019re really over Vaughn?\u201d</p><p>Out of all the things I just told him, that\u2019s what he focuses on? I laugh. \u201cI\u2019m absolutely over Vaughn.\u201d</p><p>He shifts in his chair and looks at me. \u201cJust tell me if this isn\u2019t cool with you, but...would you care if I asked her out? If you say no, I won\u2019t man. I swear.\u201d</p><p>He hasn\u2019t changed a bit. Of course this is the one thing he would pick up on out of my entire confession. The single girl.</p> <p>\u201cReece? I could honestly care less what you do with Vaughn. Honestly. Just don\u2019t bring her here. That\u2019s one rule you can\u2019t break. She\u2019s not allowed in this house.\u201d</p><p>He smiles. \u201cI can live with that.\u201d</p><p>The next few hours are spent finishing homework and studying the notes Vaughn left for me. The first thing I do is re-write them and throw her original notes away. I hate looking at her handwriting.</p><p>I\u2019ve cut my spying down to about once an hour now. I don\u2019t want Reece to think I\u2019m crazy, so I only look out the window when he leaves the room. I\u2019m at the table studying and he\u2019s watching TV when Kiersten walks in; without knocking, of course.</p><p>\u201cWho the hell are you?\u201d she says to Reece as she walks across the living room.</p><p>\u201cAre you even old enough to talk like that?\u201d he asks.</p><p>She rolls her eyes and walks to the kitchen and takes a seat across from me. She puts her elbows on the table and rests her chin in her hands, watching me study.</p><p>\u201cYou see Lake today?\u201d I ask without looking up from my notes.</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWatching movies. And eating a lot of junk food.\u201d</p><p>Of course she is. It\u2019s Sunday. \u201cDid she say anything about me?\u201d</p><p>Kiersten folds her arms across the table and leans in closer.</p><p>\u201cYou know, Will. If I\u2019m going to be working for you, I think it\u2019s a good time to negotiate fair compensation.\u201d</p><p>I lay my notes down on the table and look at her. \u201cAre you agreeing to help me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you agreeing to pay me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think we could work out a deal,\u201d I say. \u201cNot with currency, of course. But maybe I could help you build your portfolio.\u201d</p><p>She leans back in her seat and eyes me curiously. \u201cKeep talking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got a lot of performance experience, you know. I could give you some of my poetry...help you prepare for a slam.\u201d</p><p>I can see her thoughts churning behind her expression. \u201cTake me to the slam. Every Thursday for at least a month. There's a talent show coming up at the school in a few weeks that I want to enter, so I need all the exposure I can get.\u201d</p><p>\"An entire month? No way. This reconciliation between Lake and I better happen before four weeks! I can't go through this for a whole month.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou really are an idiot, aren\u2019t you?\u201d She stands up and pushes her chair in. \u201cWithout my help, you\u2019ll be lucky if she forgives you this year.\u201d</p><p>She turns to walk away.</p><p>\u201cFine! I\u2019ll do it. I\u2019ll take you,\u201d I say.</p><p>She turns around and smiles at me. \u201cGood choice,\u201d she says. \u201cNow...is there anything you want me to plant in her head while I go to work?\u201d</p><p>I stew on this for a moment. What\u2019s the best way to win Lake back? What in the world can I possibly say to get her to see how much I really love her? What could I have Kiersten do? I jump up when it hits me. \u201cYes! Kiersten, you need to ask her to take you to the slams. Tell her I refused to take you, and that I said I\u2019m never going back. Beg her to take you if you have to. If there\u2019s one way I can get her to believe me, it\u2019s while I\u2019m on that stage.\u201d</p><p>She gives me an evil grin. \u201cDevious... I love it!\u201d Kiersten walks out and goes to work.</p><p>\u201cWho is she?\u201d Reece says.</p><p>\u201cShe is my new best friend.\u201d</p><p>Other than the fight we had over the stars today, I\u2019ve given Lake all the alone time I can possibly give her. Kiersten reported back to me and said Lake agreed to take her Thursday, after an intense bout of begging on Kiersten\u2019s part. I rewarded her with one of my old poems.</p><p>It\u2019s after ten now. I know I shouldn\u2019t, but I can\u2019t seem to go to bed without trying to talk to her at least one more time. I can\u2019t decide if me leaving her alone or me hounding her is the better choice at this point. I decide it\u2019s time for another star. I really hate that we\u2019re opening them so fast, but I consider this an emergency.</p><p>When I get to the kitchen, I\u2019m shocked to see Lake peering her head in one of the cabinets. She\u2019s getting sneakier. When I pass by her, she jumps. I don\u2019t say anything as I reach into the cabinet and pull out the vase she\u2019s looking for. I set it on the counter and take out one of the stars. She looks at me as though she\u2019s waiting on me to yell at her again. I pick the vase up and hold it out to her and she reaches inside and grabs her own star. We both lean against opposite ends of the counter while we open them and read them silently to ourselves.</p><p>Adopt the pace of nature: her secret is patience. ~Ralph Waldo Emerson</p><p>And so I do just that...I practice patience. I don\u2019t speak as she reads hers. As much as I want to run up to her and kiss her and make it all better, I decide to be patient instead. She scowls as she reads the paper in her hand. She wads it up and throws it on the counter, then walks away. And again, I let her go.</p><p>When I know she\u2019s gone, I grab her slip of paper off the counter and unfold it.</p><p>\u201cSo if you could find it in your heart</p><p>To give a man a second start</p><p>I promise things won't end the same.\u201d ~The Avett Brothers</p><p>I couldn\u2019t have said it better if I would have written it myself. \u201cThank you, Julia,\u201d I whisper.</p><p>Monday, January 23rd, 2012</p><p>I\u2019m not giving up</p><p>You\u2019re not giving in</p><p>This battle will turn into a war</p><p>Before I let it come to an end.</p><p>Chapter Nine</p><p>I know Lake doesn\u2019t like me right now, but she definitely doesn\u2019t hate me, either. I can\u2019t help but wonder if I should back off and give her the space she's asking for. Part of me wants to respect where she\u2019s coming from, but part of me is scared that if I do back off, she may decide she likes the space. I\u2019m terrified of that. So maybe I won\u2019t give her space. I wish I knew where to draw the line between desperation and suffocation.</p><p>Reece is in the kitchen drinking coffee. I haven\u2019t seen a lot of him, but the fact that he always has coffee ready is almost worth having him stay here.</p><p>\u201cWhat are your plans today?\u201d he says when I walk into the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cI have to go to Detroit to get the boys at some point. You want to go with me?\u201d</p><p>He shakes his head. \u201cCan\u2019t. I have plans with...I have plans today.\u201d He looks away nervously as he rinses out his coffee cup.</p><p>I laugh and take my own cup out of the cabinet. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to hide it. I already told you I was cool with it.\u201d</p><p>He places his cup upside down in the strainer and turns to face me. \u201cIt\u2019s still a little weird, though. I mean, I don\u2019t want you to think I was trying to get with her while you two were together. It wasn\u2019t like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop worrying about it, Reece. Really. Oddly enough, it\u2019s not weird for me at all. What is a little weird is just a few days ago she was professing her love for me, but now she's about to spend the day with you. Does that not bother you just a little bit?\u201d</p><p>He grins at me as he grabs his wallet and keys off the counter and exits the kitchen. \"Believe me, Will. I've got skills. When Vaughn's with me, you'll be the last thing on her mind.\"</p><p>Reece has never been much for modesty. He puts his jacket on and heads toward the front door to leave. As soon as the front door shuts, my phone vibrates. I pull it out of my pocket and smile. It\u2019s a text from Lake.</p><p>What time will Kel be home today? I have to go pick up a textbook on backorder and I won\u2019t be home for a while.</p><p>The text seems too impersonal. I read it a few times, trying to gain hints from any hidden meanings in it. Unfortunately, I'm pretty positive her text stated exactly what she intended to say. I text her back, hoping to somehow talk her into going with me to pick the boys up. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Where are you going to pick up textbooks?

What time will Kel be home?</p><p>She\u2019s so hard to crack. I hate her short responses.</p> <p>I\u2019m going to Detroit to pick them up later. Why don\u2019t you just ride with me? I can take you to get your book.</p><p>This could be good. Having the long drive to talk things over might really give me a chance to convince her that things need to go back to the way they were.</p><p>I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a good idea. I\u2019m sorry.</p><p>Or not. Why does she have to be so damn difficult? I throw my phone on the couch and don\u2019t even bother with texting her back. I walk to the window and pathetically stare at her house again. At first, I thought she would get over this pretty fast, but it's been days. I hate the fact that her need for space is stronger than her need for me. I really need her to go to Detroit with me today.</p><p>I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m doing this. As I\u2019m crossing the street, I double check to make sure she isn't peeking out the window. She\u2019ll be so pissed if she catches me doing this. I quickly open her car door and push the lever to pop the hood. I have to work fast. I decide the best way to disable her jeep is to disconnect the battery. It\u2019s probably the most obvious, but she would never notice considering her lack of mechanical knowledge. As soon as I succeed with my goal I glance toward her window again, then make a mad dash back home. When I shut the door behind me, I almost regret what I just did. Almost.</p> <p>I wait for her to come out of her house that afternoon before I leave. I watch as she attempts to crank her vehicle, but the car doesn't start. Obviously. She hits the steering wheel out of frustration and swings open her car door. This is my opportunity. I grab my things and head out the front door to my car, pretending not to notice her. When I back up and pull onto the street, she has her hood up. I stop in front of her driveway and roll down my window.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? Car won\u2019t start?\u201d</p><p>She peers around the front of the hood and shakes her head. I pull my car over and get out to take a look. She steps aside and allows me by without speaking. I fidget with a few wires here and there and pretend to try to crank her car a couple of times. The whole time, she\u2019s just silently standing back.</p><p>\u201cLooks like your battery is shot,\u201d I lie. \u201cIf you want, I can pick a new one up for you while I\u2019m in Detroit. Or...you could just ride with me and I\u2019ll take you to get your book.\u201d I smile at her, hoping she\u2019ll cave.</p><p>She looks back at her house, then at me. She looks torn. \u201cNo, I\u2019ll just ask Eddie. I don\u2019t think she has plans today.\u201d</p><p>This isn\u2019t what I need her to say. This isn\u2019t going how I had planned. Play it cool, Will.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m just offering you a ride. We both need to go to Detroit anyway. It\u2019s ridiculous to get Eddie involved just because you don\u2019t want to talk to me right now.\u201d I use the authoritative tone I\u2019ve perfected on her. It usually works.</p><p>She hesitates.</p><p>\"Lake, you can carve pumpkins the whole trip. Whatever you need. Just get in the car,\" I say.</p><p>She scowls at me and then turns and grabs her purse out of the jeep. \u201cFine. But don\u2019t think this means anything.\u201d She walks down the driveway and toward my car.</p><p>I\u2019m glad she\u2019s in front of me, because I can\u2019t hide my excitement as I punch at the air with my fists. An entire day together is exactly what we need.</p><p>As soon as we pull away, she turns The Avett Brothers up on the car stereo; her way of letting me know she's carving pumpkins. The first few miles to Detroit are awkward. I keep wanting to bring everything up, but I don\u2019t know how. Kel and Caulder will be with us on the way home, so I know if I want to lay it all out there, I have to do it now.</p><p>I reach over and turn the volume down. She\u2019s got her foot propped up on the dash and she\u2019s staring out the window in an attempt to avoid confrontation like she always does. When she notices I\u2019ve turned down the volume, she glances at me and sees me staring at her, then returns her attention back out the window. \u201cDon\u2019t, Will. I told you...we need time. I don\u2019t want to talk about it.\u201d</p><p>She is so damn frustrating. I sigh and shake my head, feeling another round of defeat coming on. \"Could you at least give me an estimate of how long you'll be carving pumpkins? It'd be nice to know how long I have to suffer,\" I say. I don't try and mask my aggravation. This space thing is really starting to annoy me. I can tell by her physical reaction that I said the absolute wrong thing again.</p> <p>\"I knew this was a bad idea,\" she mumbles.</p><p>My hands grip the steering wheel even tighter. You would think after a year I would have found a way to get through to her, or to manipulate her in some way. She\u2019s almost impenetrable. I have to remind myself that her indomitable will is one of the reasons I fell in love with her in the first place.</p><p>Neither of us says another word during the remainder of the drive. It doesn't help that neither of us turns the radio back up, either. The entire trip is incredibly awkward as I try my best to search for the right thing to say and she tries her best to pretend I don\u2019t exist. As soon as we arrive at the bookstore in Detroit and I pull into a parking spot, she swings open the car door and runs inside. I\u2019d like to think she\u2019s running from the cold, but I know she\u2019s running from me. From confrontation.</p><p>While she\u2019s inside, I get a text from my grandfather informing me that my grandmother is cooking us dinner. His text ended with the word \u201croast,\u201d preceded by a hashtag.</p><p>\"Great,\" I mutter to myself. I know Lake has no intentions of spending the evening with my grandparents. As soon as I text my grandfather letting him know we\u2019re almost there, she returns to the car.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re cooking dinner for us. We won't stay long,\u201d I say.</p><p>She sighs. \u201cHow convenient. Well, then take me to get a new battery first so we can get it over with.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t respond as I pull out of the bookstore and head toward my grandparent\u2019s house. She\u2019s been to their house a couple of times before, so she knows when we get closer that I have no intentions of stopping at the store.</p><p>\u201cYou've passed like three stores that sell batteries,\" she says. \"We need to get one now in case it's too late on our way back.\"</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need a battery. Your battery is fine,\u201d I say.</p><p>I avoid looking over at her but I can see her watching me, waiting for more explanation.</p><p>I don\u2019t immediately respond. I flick the blinker on and turn onto my grandparent\u2019s street. When I pull into their driveway, I turn the car off and tell her the truth. What harm could it do at this point?</p><p>\u201cI unhooked your battery cable before you tried to leave today.\u201d I don\u2019t wait for her reaction as I get out of the car and slam the door. I\u2019m not sure why I slam the car door. I\u2019m not mad at her, I\u2019m just frustrated. Frustrated that she doubts me after all this time.</p><p>\u201cYou what!?\u201d she yells. When she gets out of the car, she slams her door intentionally.</p><p>I keep walking, shielding the wind and snow with my jacket until I reach the front door. She rushes after me. I almost walk inside without knocking but remember how it feels, so I knock.</p><p>\u201cI said I unhooked your battery cable. How else was I going to convince you to ride with me?\u201d</p><p>\"That's real mature, Will.\" She huddles closer to the front door, further away from the wind. I hear footsteps nearing the entryway from inside when she turns to face me. She opens her mouth like she's about to say something else, then rolls her eyes and turns away. The front door swings open and my grandmother steps aside to let us in.</p><p>\u201cHi Sara,\u201d Lake says with a fake smile as she hugs my grandmother.</p><p>My grandmother returns her hug and I walk in behind them.</p><p>\u201cYou two got here just in time. Kel and Caulder are setting the table,\u201d she says. \u201cWill, take both your jackets and go put them in the dryer to get the snow off so they won\u2019t be so wet when you leave.\u201d</p><p>My grandmother walks back toward the kitchen and I remove my jacket and head to the laundry room without offering to take Lake\u2019s. I smile when I hear her stomping angrily after me. Being the nice guy has obviously not helped my case at all, so I guess I\u2019ll just start being the jerk. I throw my jacket into the dryer and step aside so she can do the same. After she shoves her jacket inside, she slams the dryer door shut and turns it on. She spins around to exit the laundry room but I'm blocking her way. She shoots me a dirty look and tries to ease passed me, but I don\u2019t budge. She steps back and folds her arms across her chest and looks away, giving me the silent treatment. She\u2019s going to stand here until I move out of her way. I\u2019m going to stand here until she talks to me. I guess we'll be here all night.</p><p>She tightens her ponytail and leans against the dryer, crossing her legs at the ankles. I lean against the laundry room door and stand in the same position as I stare her down, waiting for something. I'm not sure what it is I'm trying to get out of her right now; I just want her to talk to me.</p><p>She wipes snow off the shoulder of her shirt. She's wearing the Avett shirt I bought her at the concert we went to no less than a month ago. We had the best time that night; I never would have imagined then that we would be in the predicament we\u2019re in right now.</p><p>I finally give in and speak first. \"You know, for someone giving me the silent treatment like a five-year-old, you sure are quick to accuse me of being immature.\"</p><p>She cocks her eyebrows at me and laughs. \"Seriously? You have me trapped in a laundry room, Will! Who's being immature?\"</p><p>She tries to move past me again, but I continue to block her way. She's flush against me now as she pathetically tries to shove against my chest to get by. I have to fight the urge to wrap my arms around her. We're practically face to face when she finally gives up again and stops pushing me. She's inches from me now, staring at the floor, waiting for me to get out of her way. She may have her doubts about my feelings for her, but there is no way she can doubt the sexual tension between us. I take her chin in my hand and gently pull her face toward mine.</p><p>\u201cLake,\u201d I whisper. \u201cI\u2019m not sorry about what I did to your car. I\u2019m desperate. I\u2019d do anything at this point just to be with you. I miss you.\u201d</p><p>She looks away so I bring my other hand to her face and force her to look me in the eyes. She tries to pull my hands away but I refuse to let go. The tension between us increases as we hold each other's stare. I can tell she wants to hate me so bad right now, but she loves me too much. There\u2019s a struggle of emotion in her eyes. She can't decide whether or not she wants to punch me or kiss me.</p><p>I take advantage of her moment of weakness and slowly lean in and touch my lips to hers. She presses her hands against my chest and half-heartedly tries to push me away, but she doesn\u2019t pull her mouth away from mine. Rather than honor her request for \u2018space,\u2019 I lean into her even further and part her lips with mine. Her hands weaken their pressure against my chest as her stubbornness finally caves and she lets me kiss her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I place my hand on the back of her head and slowly move my lips in rhythm with hers. Our kiss is different this time. Rather than push it to the point of retreat like we've been doing, we continue to slowly kiss, pausing every few seconds to look at each other. It's almost as if neither of us believes this is happening. I feel like this kiss is my last chance to remove any doubt from her head, so I pour every single emotion I have into it. Now that I have her back in my arms, I\u2019m afraid to let her go. I take a step forward and she takes a step back until we end up against the dryer. The situation we\u2019re in reminds me of the last time we were alone together in a laundry room over a year ago.</p><p>It was the day after her kiss with Javi at Club N9NE. The moment I walked around his truck and saw his mouth on hers, I immediately felt a jealousy coupled with an intense hurt like nothing I\u2019ve ever experienced. I had never been in a physical fight before. The fact that he was my student and I was his teacher was lost on me as soon as I began to pull him off of her. I don\u2019t know what would have happened if Gavin wouldn't have shown up when he did.</p><p>The day after the fight when I heard Lake tell her version of events, I felt like such an idiot that I actually believed she had kissed him back. I knew her better than that, and hated myself for assuming the worst. As difficult as it was that day to allow her to continue to believe I had chosen my career over her, I knew it was the right thing to do at the time. That night in her laundry room though, I allowed my emotions to take control over my conscience, and I almost messed up the best thing that ever happened to me.</p><p>I push the fear of losing her again out of my mind as I continue to kiss her. She moves her hands to my neck, sending chills down my entire body. Slow and steady loses out as we simultaneously pick up the pace. When she runs her hands through my hair, it sends me over the edge. I grab her by the waist and lift her up until she's seated on the dryer. Out of every single kiss we've ever shared, this is by far the best. I place my hands on the outside of her thighs and pull her to the edge of the dryer and she wraps her legs around me. Just as my lips meet the spot directly below her ear, she gasps and shoves against my chest.</p> <p>\u201cEh hem,\u201d my grandmother says, rudely interrupting one of the best moments of my life.</p><p>Lake immediately jumps off the dryer and I step back. My grandmother is standing in the doorway with her arms crossed, glaring at us. Lake straightens her shirt out and looks down at her feet, embarrassed.</p><p>\u201cWell it\u2019s nice to see you two made up,\u201d my grandmother says, eyeing me disapprovingly. \u201cDinner is ready when you can find the time to join us at the table.\u201d She turns and walks away.</p><p>As soon as she\u2019s gone, I turn back to Lake and wrap my arms around her again. \u201cBabe, I\u2019ve missed you so bad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop,\u201d she says, pulling away from me. \"Just stop.\"</p> <p>Her sudden hostility is unexpected...and confusing. \u201cWhat do you mean stop? You were just kissing me back, Lake.\"</p><p>She looks up at me, agitated. She seems disappointed in herself. \"I guess I had a weak moment,\" she says in a mocking tone.</p><p>I recognize the phrase, and more than likely deserve her reaction.</p><p>\"Lake, quit doing this to yourself. I know you love me.\"</p><p>She lets out a sigh as though she's unsuccessfully trying to get through to a child. \u201cWill, I\u2019m not struggling with whether or not I love you. It\u2019s whether or not you really love me.\u201d She heads into the dining room, leaving me behind in yet another laundry room.</p><p>I punch the wall, frustrated at what just happened between us. I thought for a second I finally got through to her. I don't know how much longer I can take this. She's starting to piss me off.</p> <p>\u201cThis roast is delicious, Sara,\" Lake says to my grandmother. \"You'll have to give me the recipe.\"</p><p>I snatch the bowl of potatoes off the table in front of me and silently seethe at the way Lake is so casually exchanging pleasantries with my grandmother. I have no appetite, but I pile on the food anyway. I know my grandmother and if I don\u2019t eat, she\u2019ll be offended. I scoop potatoes onto my plate, then take an exaggerated spoonful and drop them onto Lake's plate, right on top of her roast. She's seated next to me, doing her best to pretend nothing is amiss as she eyes the massive mound of potatoes in front of her. I don't know if she's putting on this fake display of happiness for my grandparent's sake or for Kel and Caulder's sake. Maybe for the sake of all of them.</p><p>\"Layken, did you know Grandpaul used to be in a band?\" Kel says.</p><p>\"No, I didn\u2019t. And did you just call him Grandpaul?\" Lake says.</p><p>\"Yeah. That's my new name for him.\"</p><p>\"I like it,\" my grandfather says. \"Can I call you Grandkel?\"</p><p>Kel smiles and nods at him.</p><p>\"Will you call me Grandcaulder?\" Caulder asks.</p> <p>\"Sure thing, Grandcaulder,\" he says.</p><p>\"What was the name of your band, Grandpaul?\" Lake asks.</p><p>It's almost scary how good she is at putting up a front. I make a mental note to remember this little detail about her for future reference.</p><p>\"Well, I was in several actually,\" he replies. \"It was just a hobby when I was younger. I played the guitar.\"</p><p>\"That's neat,\" she says. She takes a bite of her food and talks with a mouthful. \"You know, Kel has always wanted to learn how to play the guitar. I've been thinking about putting him in lessons.\" She wipes her mouth and takes a sip of water.</p><p>\"Why? You should just get Will to teach him,\" Grandpaul says.</p><p>Lake turns and looks at me. \"I wasn't aware that Will knew how to play the guitar,\" she says in a somewhat accusatory tone.</p><p>I guess I've never shared this with her. It's not like I was trying to keep it from her, I just haven't played in a couple of years. Of course, I'm sure she thinks it's just another secret I've been hiding from her.</p><p>\"You've never played for her?\" he says to me.</p><p>I shrug. \"I don't own a guitar.\"</p><p>Lake is still glaring at me. \"This is really interesting, Will,\" she says sarcastically. \"There sure is a lot about you I don't know.\"</p><p>I look at her straight faced. \"Actually, Babe...there isn't. You pretty much know everything about me.\"</p><p>She shakes her head and places her elbows on the table and squints her eyes at me, putting on that fake smile I\u2019m really growing to hate. \"No, Sweetie. I don't think I do know everything about you.\u201d She says this in a tone that only I could recognize as her false enthusiasm.</p><p>\"I didn't know you played the guitar. I also didn't know you were getting a roommate. In fact, this \u2018Reece\u2019 seems to have been a pretty big part of your life, and you've never even mentioned him....along with a few other \u2018old friends\u2019 that have popped up recently.\"</p><p>I set my fork down on my plate and wipe my mouth with my napkin. Everyone at the table is staring at me, waiting for me to speak. I smile at my grandmother who seems oblivious to what's going on between Lake and I. She smiles back at me, interested in my response. I decide to raise the stakes, so I wrap my arm around Lake and pull her closer to me and kiss her on the forehead.</p><p>\"You're right, Layken.\" I say her entire first name with her same feigned enthusiasm. I know how much it pisses her off. \"I did fail to mention a few old friends from my past. I guess this means we'll just have to spend a lot more time together, getting to know every single aspect of each other's lives.\" I pinch her chin with my thumb and finger and smile at her as she narrows her eyes at me.</p><p>\"Reece is back? He's living with us?\" Caulder asks.</p><p>I nod. \"He needed a place to crash for a month or so.\"</p><p>\"Why isn't he staying with his mother?\" my grandmother asks.</p><p>\"She got remarried while he was overseas. He doesn't get along with his new step-dad, so he's looking for his own place,\" I say.</p><p>Lake leans forward in an attempt to inconspicuously remove my arm that's draped around her shoulder. Instead, I squeeze her tighter and pull my chair closer to hers. \"Lake sure made a good first impression when she met Reece,\" I say, referring to her shirtless tantrum in my living room. \"Right, Sweetie?\"</p><p>She presses the heel of her boot into the top of my foot and smiles back at me. \"Right,\" she says. She scoots her chair back and stands up. \"Excuse me. I need to go to the restroom.\" She slaps her napkin down on the table and gives me the eye as she walks away.</p><p>Everyone else at the table is oblivious to her anger.</p><p>\"You two seem to have moved past your hump from last week,\" my grandfather says after she's disappeared down the hallway.</p><p>\"Yep. Getting along great,\" I say. I shove a spoonful of potatoes in my mouth.</p><p>Lake remains in the bathroom for quite a while. When she returns, she doesn't speak much. Kel, Caulder and Grandpaul talk video games while Lake and I finish our meals in silence.</p><p>\"Will, can you help me in the kitchen?\" my grandmother says.</p><p>My grandmother is the last person that would ask for help in the kitchen. I'm either about to change a light bulb or receive a lecture. I get up from the table and grab mine and Lake's plates and follow her through the kitchen door.</p><p>\"What's that all about?\" she says as I scrape food off the plates and into the disposal.</p><p>\"What's what all about?\" I reply.</p><p>She wipes her hands on the dish towel and leans against the counter. \"She's not very happy with you, Will. I may be old, but I know a woman's scorn when I see one. Do you want to talk about it?\"</p><p>She's more observant than I give her credit for.</p><p>\"I guess it can't hurt at this point,\" I say, leaning against the kitchen counter next to her. \"She's pissed at me. The whole thing with Vaughn last week left her doubting me. Now she thinks I'm with her just because I feel sorry for her and Kel.\"</p><p>\"Why are you with her?\" my grandmother asks.</p><p>\"Because. I'm in love with her,\" I say.</p><p>\"Well, I suggest you better show her,\" she says. She takes the rag and begins wiping down the counter.</p><p>\"I have. I can't tell you how many times I've told her. I can't get it through her head. Now she wants me to leave her alone so she can think. I'm getting so frustrated; I don't know what else I can do.\"</p><p>My grandmother rolls her eyes at my perceived ignorance. \"A guy can tell a girl he's in love with her until he's blue in the face. Words don't mean anything to a woman when her head\u2019s full of doubt. You have to show her.\"</p><p>\"How? What else can I do? I disabled her car so she\u2019d have to ride here with me today. Short of stalking her, I don't know what else I can do to show her.\"</p><p>My pathetic confession prompts a disapproving look from her. \"That's more like a good way to get yourself put in jail, not win back the heart of the girl you're in love with,\" she says.</p><p>\"I know. It was stupid. I was desperate. I\u2019m out of ideas.\"</p><p>She walks to the refrigerator and pulls out a pie. She sets in on the counter next to me and starts cutting slices. \"I think the first step is for you to take some time to question just why you're in love with her, then figure out a way to relay that to her. In the meantime, you need to give her the space she needs. I'm surprised that little spectacle you just pulled at dinner didn't get you punched.\" </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\"The night is still young.\"</p><p>My grandmother laughs and places a slice of pie onto a plate, then turns around and hands it to me. \"I like her, Will. You better not screw this up. She's good for Caulder.\"</p><p>My grandmother's comment surprises me. \"Really? I didn't think you liked her very much.\"</p><p>She continues slicing sections of the pie. \"I know you think that, but I do like her. What I don't like is the way you're always all over her when you're around her. Some things are better left in private. And I'm referring to the bedroom, not the laundry room,\" she says as she whips her head around and frowns at me.</p> <p>I didn't realize how publicly I flaunted my affection toward Lake. Now that my grandmother and Lake have both brought it up, it's kind of embarrassing. I guess the laundry room incident from earlier also didn't help to dissuade the opinion Lake thinks my grandmother has of her.</p><p>\"Grandma?\" I ask as I pick at my dessert. She never gave me a fork so I tear off a piece of the crust and pop it in my mouth.</p><p>\u201cHum?\u201d She notices me eating with my hands so she reaches into the drawer, pulls out a fork and drops it on my plate.</p><p>\"She\u2019s still a virgin, you know.\"</p><p>My grandmother\u2019s eyes grow wide and she turns back toward the pie to cut another slice. \"Will, that's none of my business.\"</p> <p>\"I know,\" I say. \"I just want you to know that about her. I don't want you thinking the opposite of her.\"</p><p>She turns and hands me two more plates of dessert, then grabs two of her own and nudges her head toward the kitchen door. \"You have a good heart, Will. She'll come around. You just need to give her time.\"</p><p>Lake sits in the backseat with Kel on the way home and Caulder rides in front with me. The three of them talk the entire ride home. Kel and Caulder are droning on about everything they did with Grandpaul. I don't say a word. I tune them out and drive in silence.</p><p>After I pull into my driveway and we all get out of the car, I follow Lake and Kel as they make their way across the street. She heads inside without saying a word. I pop the hood on her jeep and reconnect the battery, then shut it and head back to my house.</p><p>It\u2019s not even ten o\u2019clock at night yet. I\u2019m not tired at all. Caulder\u2019s in bed and Reece is more than likely still out with Vaughn. I sit down on the couch and turn the T.V. on when someone knocks at the door.</p><p>Who would be coming over this late? Who would knock? I open the door and my stomach flips when I see Lake shivering on the patio. She doesn't look angry, which is a good sign. Her hands are pulling her jacket tightly around her neck. She's got her snow boots pulled on over her pajama bottoms. She looks ridiculous...and beautiful.</p> <p>\u201cHey,\u201d I say, a little too eagerly. \u201cHere for another star?\u201d I step aside and she walks in. \u201cWhy\u2019d you knock?\u201d I ask, shutting the door behind her.</p><p>I hate that she knocked on my door. She never knocks. That small gesture reveals some sort of change in our entire relationship that I can\u2019t pinpoint, but I know I don't like it.</p><p>She just shrugs her shoulders. \u201cCan I talk to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish you would talk to me,\u201d I say. We both make our way to the couch. Normally, she would curl up next to me and sit on her feet. This time, she makes sure there\u2019s plenty of space between us as she drops down on the opposite end of the couch. If I\u2019ve learned anything at all this week, it\u2019s the fact that I hate space. Space sucks.</p><p>She looks at me and attempts to muster a smile, but it doesn\u2019t come off right. It looks more like she\u2019s trying not to pity me.</p><p>\u201cPromise me you'll hear me out without arguing first,\" she says. \"I'd like to have a mature conversation with you.\"</p><p>\"Lake, you can't sit there and say I don't hear you out. It's impossible to hear you out when you're carving pumpkins all the damn time!\"</p><p>\"See? Right there. Don't do that,\" she says.</p> <p>I grab the throw pillow next to me and cover my face with it to muffle a frustrated groan. She's impossible. I bring the pillow back down and rest my elbow on it as I get comfortable and prepare for her lecture.</p><p>\"I'm listening,\" I say.</p><p>\"I don\u2019t think you understand where I\u2019m coming from at all. You have no clue why I'm having doubts, do you?\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s right, I don\u2019t. \u201cEnlighten me,\u201d I say.</p><p>She takes her jacket off and throws it over the back of the couch and gets comfortable. I was wrong, she\u2019s not here to lecture; I can tell by the way she\u2019s speaking to me. She\u2019s here to have a serious conversation, so I decide to respectfully hear her out.</p><p>\u201cI know you love me, Will. I was wrong to say that earlier. I know you do. And I love you, too.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s obvious this confession is merely just a preface to something else she\u2019s about to say. Something I don\u2019t want to hear.</p><p>\u201cBut after hearing the things Vaughn said to you, it made me look at our relationship in a different way.\" She pulls her legs up on the couch and sits Indian style, facing me. \"Think about it. I started thinking back on that night at the slam last year, when I finally told you how I felt. What if I wouldn\u2019t have shown up that night? What if I wouldn\u2019t have come to you and told you how much I loved you? You would have never even read me your slam. You would have taken the job at the junior high and we probably wouldn\u2019t even be together. So you can see where my doubt comes into play, right? It seems like you just wanted to sit back and let the chips fall where they may. You didn\u2019t fight for me. You were just going to let me go. You did let me go.\u201d</p><p>I did let her go, but not for the reasons she\u2019s telling herself. She knows this. Why does she doubt it now? I do my best to be patient when I respond, but my emotions are all jumbled up. I\u2019m frustrated, I\u2019m pissed, I\u2019m happy she\u2019s here. It\u2019s exhausting. I hate fighting.</p><p>\u201cYou know why I had to let you go, Lake. There were bigger things going on last year than just us. Your mother needed you. She didn\u2019t know how much time she had. The way we felt about each other would have interfered with your time left with her, and you would have hated yourself for it later. That\u2019s the only reason why I gave up, and you know that.\u201d</p><p>She shakes her head in disagreement. \u201cIt's more than that, Will. We\u2019ve both experienced more grief in the past couple of years than most people experience in a lifetime. Think about the effect that had on us. When we finally found each other, our grief is how we related. Then when we found out we couldn\u2019t be together, it made it even worse. Especially since Kel and Caulder were best friends by then. We had to interact constantly which made it even harder to shut off our feelings. And then to top it all off, my mom ended up having cancer and I was about to become a guardian, just like you. That's how we related. There were all these external influences at play. Almost like life was forcing us together.\u201d</p><p>I let her continue without interrupting her as she requested I do, but I just want to scream out of sheer frustration. I\u2019m not sure what point she\u2019s getting at, but it seems to me she\u2019s been thinking way too hard.</p><p>\u201cRemove all the external factors for a second,\u201d she says. \u201cImagine if things were like this: your parents are alive. My mom is alive. Kel and Caulder aren\u2019t best friends. We aren\u2019t both guardians with huge responsibilities. We have no sense of obligation to help each other out. You were never my teacher, therefore we never had to experience those months of emotional torture. We\u2019re just a young couple with absolutely no responsibilities or life experiences tying us together. Now tell me, if all that was our current reality, what is it about me that you love? Why would you want to be with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is ridiculous,\u201d I mutter. \u201cThat\u2019s not our reality, Lake. Maybe some of those things are why we\u2019re in love. What\u2019s wrong with that? Why would it matter? Love is love.\u201d</p><p>She scoots closer to me on the couch and takes my hands in hers, looking me straight in the eyes. \u201cIt matters, Will. It matters because five or ten years from now, those external factors aren\u2019t going to be at play in our relationship anymore. It\u2019ll just be you and me. My biggest fear is that you\u2019ll wake up one day and realize all the reasons you\u2019re in love with me are gone. Kel and Caulder won\u2019t be here to depend on either of us. Our parent\u2019s will be a fleeting memory. We\u2019ll both have careers that could support us individually. If these are the reasons you love me, there won\u2019t be anything left to hold you to me other than your conscience. And knowing you, you would live with it internally because you\u2019re too good of a person to break my heart. I don\u2019t want to be the reason you end up with regrets.\u201d</p><p>She stands up and puts her jacket back on. I start to protest everything she says but as soon as I open my mouth she interrupts me. \u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d she says with a serious look on her face. \u201cI want you to think about this before you object. I don\u2019t care if it takes you days or weeks or months. I don\u2019t want to hear from you again until you can be completely real with me and leave my feelings for you out of your decision. You owe this to me, Will. You owe it to me to make sure we aren\u2019t about to live a life together that someday you\u2019ll regret.\u201d</p><p>She walks out the door and calmly closes it behind her.</p><p>Months? Did she just say she didn\u2019t care if it takes months?</p><p>She did. She said months.</p><p>My god, everything she said makes sense. She\u2019s completely wrong, but it makes sense. I get it. I can see why she\u2019s questioning everything. I can see why she doubts me now.</p><p>Half an hour goes by before I even so much as move a muscle. I\u2019m completely lost in thought. When I finally break free from the trance I\u2019m in, I come to just one conclusion. My grandmother is right. Lake needs me to show her why I love her.</p><p>I start to formulate a plan when I decide to grab inspiration out of the jar first. I unfold the star and read it.</p><p>\u201cLife\u2019s hard. It\u2019s even harder when you\u2019re stupid.\u201d</p><p>\u2015 John Wayne</p><p>I sigh. I miss Julia\u2019s sense of humor.</p><p>Tuesday, January 24th, 2012</p><p>The heart of a man</p><p>is no heart at all</p><p>If his heart isn\u2019t loved by a woman.</p><p>The heart of a woman</p><p>is no heart at all</p><p>If her heart isn\u2019t loving a man.</p><p>But the heart of a man and a woman in love</p><p>Can be worse than not having a heart</p><p>Because at least if you have no heart at all</p><p>It can\u2019t die when it breaks apart.</p><p>Chapter Ten</p><p>It\u2019s Tuesday and so far I\u2019ve spent the majority of the day studying. Only a portion of it has been spent being paranoid. Paranoid that someone\u2019s going to see me sneaking into Lake\u2019s house. Once inside, I search around for everything I need and quickly head back out the front door before everyone gets home from school. I throw my satchel over my shoulder and bend down to hide Lake's key back under the pot.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?!\u201d</p><p>I jump back and nearly trip over the concrete patio rise. I control my balance on the support beam and look up. Sherry is standing in Lake\u2019s driveway with her hands on her hips. I quickly try to come up with an excuse as to why I\u2019m sneaking out of Lake's house. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI...I was just...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m kidding,\u201d she laughs, walking toward me.</p><p>I shoot her a dirty look for almost giving me a heart attack and turn back around to push the pot back into its original position. \u201cI needed some things out of her house,\u201d I say, without going into detail. \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot much,\u201d she says. She has a shovel in her hands and I glance behind her to see part of Lake\u2019s sidewalk cleared. \u201cI\u2019m just wasting time...waiting on my husband to get home. We've got errands to run.\u201d</p> <p>I cock my head at her. \u201cYou have a husband?\u201d I ask with a little too much fervor. I don\u2019t mean to sound surprised, but I am. I\u2019ve never seen him before.</p><p>She laughs at my response. \u201cNo, Will. My children are the result of immaculate conception.\u201d</p><p>I laugh. She\u2019s got a great sense of humor. It reminds me of my mother\u2019s. And Julia\u2019s. And Lake\u2019s. How was I so lucky to be surrounded by such amazing women?</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d I say. \u201cIt\u2019s just that I\u2019ve never seen him before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe works a lot. Mostly out of state...goes on business trips and the like. He\u2019s home for two weeks. I\u2019d really like you to meet him.\u201d</p> <p>I don\u2019t like that we\u2019re standing in front of Lake\u2019s house. She\u2019ll be home soon. I start walking away from the house as I respond. \u201cWell, if Kel and Kiersten get married someday, we\u2019ll technically be in-laws, so I guess I should meet him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s assuming you and Kel have a different type of relationship by then,\u201d she says. \u201cAre you planning on popping the question?\u201d She begins walking with me toward her house. I think she can sense I just want to be off of Lake\u2019s property before they return home.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d planned on it,\u201d I say. \u201cI\u2019m just not so sure now what Lake\u2019s answer would be.\u201d</p><p>Sherry turns around and tilts her head, then sighs. She\u2019s looking at me with pity again. \u201cCome inside for a sec. I want to show you something.\u201d</p><p>I continue to follow her into her house. \u201cSit down on the couch,\u201d she says. \u201cDo you have a few minutes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got more than a few.\u201d</p> <p>She walks down the hallway and returns a moment later with a DVD in her hands. After she inserts it into the DVD player, she sits down on the couch beside me and turns the television on with the remote.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cA close-up of me giving birth to Kiersten.\u201d</p><p>I jump up in protest and she rolls her eyes and laughs. \u201cSit down, Will. I\u2019m kidding.\u201d</p><p>I reluctantly sit back down. \u201cThat\u2019s not funny,\u201d I say.</p><p>She presses play on the remote and the television is interrupted by a brief second of static, then cuts to a shot of a much younger Sherry. She looks about nineteen or twenty in the footage. She\u2019s sitting on a porch swing laughing, hiding her face from the video camera with her hands. The person holding the camera is laughing, too. I assume it\u2019s her now-husband. When he walks up the porch steps, he angles the camera around and sits beside her, focusing the lens on both of them. Sherry uncovers her face and leans her head against his and smiles.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you filming us, Jim?\u201d Sherry says to the camera.</p><p>\u201cBecause. I want you to remember this moment forever,\u201d he says.</p> <p>The camera shuffles again and comes to a rest on what is probably a table. It\u2019s positioned on both of them now as he kneels down in front of her and places his hands by her side. It\u2019s obvious he\u2019s about to propose, but you can see Sherry attempt to suppress her excitement, in case that\u2019s not his intention. When he pulls a small box out of his pocket, she gasps and immediately starts to cry. He brings his hand up to her face and wipes away her tears, then briefly leans forward and kisses her.</p><p>When he settles back onto his knee, he wipes a tear away from his own eyes. \u201cSherry, until I met you I didn\u2019t know what life was. I had no clue that I wasn\u2019t even alive. It\u2019s like you came along and woke up my soul.\" He's looking straight at her as he talks. He doesn't sound nervous at all, like he's determined to prove to her how serious he is. He takes a deep breath and then continues. \"I\u2019ll never be able to give you everything you deserve, but I\u2019ll definitely spend the rest of my life trying.\u201d</p><p>He pulls the ring out of the box and slides it on her finger. \u201cI\u2019m not asking you to marry me, Sherry. I\u2019m telling you to marry me, because I can\u2019t live without you.\u201d</p><p>Sherry wraps her arms around his neck and they hold onto one another and cry. \u201cOkay,\u201d she finally says. When they begin to kiss, his hand reaches over and turns off the camera.</p><p>The television goes black.</p><p>Sherry presses the power button on the remote and she\u2019s silent for a moment. I can tell the video brought back a lot of emotions in her. \u201cWhat you saw in that video?\u201d she says. \u201cThe connection Jim and I had? That\u2019s true love, Will. I\u2019ve seen you and Layken together, and she loves you like that. She really does.\u201d</p><p>The front door to Sherry\u2019s house opens wide and a man enters, shaking the snow out of his hair. Sherry looks nervous as she hops up and hits eject on the DVD player and puts it back inside the case.</p><p>\u201cHey, Sweetie,\u201d she says to him. She motions for me to stand up, so I do. \u201cThis is Will,\u201d she says. \u201cHe\u2019s Caulder\u2019s older brother from across the street.\u201d</p><p>The man walks through the living room and I reach my hand out to him. As soon as I\u2019m eye to eye with him, Sherry\u2019s sudden nervousness is explained. This isn't Jim. This is a completely different man than whoever it was I just saw propose to Sherry on that DVD.</p><p>\u201cI'm David. Nice to meet you. Heard a lot about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLikewise,\u201d I say. I\u2019m lying.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been giving Will relationship advice,\u201d Sherry says.</p><p>\u201cOh yeah?\u201d he says. He smiles at me. \u201cHopefully you take it with a grain of salt, Will. Sherry thinks she\u2019s a real guru.\u201d He leans in and kisses Sherry on the cheek.</p><p>\u201cWell, she is pretty smart,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cThat she is,\" he says as he takes a seat on the couch. \"But take it from me...never accept any of her medicinal concoctions. You\u2019ll regret it.\u201d</p><p>Too late for that.</p><p>\u201cI better get going,\u201d I say. \u201cNice meeting you, David.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll walk you out,\u201d Sherry says.</p><p>Once we\u2019re outside, her smile fades after she shuts the door behind her.</p><p>\u201cYou need to know that I love my husband, Will. But there are very few people in this world lucky enough to experience love on the same level that I\u2019ve had in the past...on the same level that you and Layken have. I\u2019m not getting into the details of why mine didn\u2019t work out, but take it from someone who\u2019s had it before...you don\u2019t want to let it slip away. Fight for her.\u201d</p><p>She steps back inside her house and shuts the door.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m trying to do,\u201d I whisper.</p><p>\"Can we have pizza tonight?\" Caulder says as soon as he walks through the front door. \"It's Tuesday. Gavin can get us the Tuesday special that comes with the dessert pizza.\"</p><p>\"Whatever. I don't feel like cooking, anyway.\" I text Gavin and offer to buy them pizza if he'll bring it over when he gets off work.</p><p>By the time eight o'clock comes around, I've got a houseful. Kiersten and Kel showed up at some point. Gavin and Eddie walk in with the pizza and we all sit down at the table to eat. The only one missing is Lake.</p><p>\"Should you invite Lake?\" I ask Eddie as I toss a pile of paper plates onto the table.</p><p>Eddie looks at me and shakes her head. \"I just texted her. She said she's not hungry.\"</p><p>I sit down to the table and grab one of the paper plates and toss a slice onto it. I take a bite and drop the pizza back down onto the plate. I'm suddenly not hungry, either.</p><p>\"Thanks for bringing me a cheese pizza, Gavin,\" Kiersten says. \"At least someone around here respects the fact that I don't eat meat.\"</p><p>I don't have anything to throw at her or I would. I shoot her a dirty look instead.</p><p>\"What's the plan of attack for Thursday?\" Kiersten asks me.</p><p>I glance at Eddie and she's looking right at me. \"What's Thursday?\" Eddie says.</p><p>\"Nothing,\" I reply. I don't want Eddie ruining this. I'm afraid she'll go warn Lake.</p><p>\"Will, if you think I'll tell her whatever it is you're planning to do, you're wrong. No one wants you two to work things out more than I do, believe me.\" She takes a bite of her pizza. She seems genuinely serious, although I'm not sure why.</p><p>\"He's doing a slam for her,\" Kiersten blurts out.</p><p>Eddie looks back up at me. \"Seriously? How? You aren't gonna be able to talk her into going.\"</p><p>\"He didn't have to,\" Kiersten says. \"I talked her into going.\"</p><p>Eddie looks at Kiersten and grins at her. \"You're a sly little thing. And just how are you planning to keep her there?\" Eddie looks back at me. \"As soon as she sees you on that stage she'll get pissed and leave.\"</p><p>\"Not if I steal her purse and keys,\" Kel says.</p><p>\"Good idea, Kel!\" I say. As soon as I say it, the reality of the moment hits me. I'm sitting here praising eleven-year-olds for stealing and lying to my girlfriend. What kind of role model am I?</p><p>\"And we can sit in that booth we sat in last time,\" Caulder says. \"We'll make sure Lake gets in first, that way we can trap her in. Once you start doing your slam, she won't be able to get up. She'll have to watch you.\"</p><p>\"Great idea,\" I say. I may not be a role-model, but at least I'm raising smart children.</p><p>\"I want to go,\" Eddie says. She turns to Gavin. \"Can we go? Aren't you off Thursday? I want to watch Will and Layken make up.\"</p><p>\"Yeah, we can go. But how are we all getting there if she doesn't know you're going, Will? We can't all fit in Layken's car. I really don't need to be driving all the way to Detroit in mine after all the deliveries I've been making.\"</p><p>\"You can ride with me,\u201d I say. \u201cEddie can tell Lake you're working or something. Everyone else can ride with Lake.\"</p><p>Everyone seems to agree on the plans. The fact that they all seem determined to help me win her back gives me a sense of hope. If everyone in this room can see how much we need to be together, surely Lake will see it, too.</p><p>I grab another plate and throw three slices of pizza on it, then take it to the kitchen. I glance over my shoulder to make sure no one is paying attention. I reach into the cabinet and pull out a star and set it under one of the slices of pizza before I wrap it.</p><p>\"Eddie, will you take this to Lake? Make sure she eats something?\"</p><p>Eddie grabs the plate and smiles at me, then walks out the front door.</p><p>\"Kids, clean the table. Put the pizza back in the fridge,\" I say. Gavin and I walk to the living room and sit on the couch.</p><p>He lays on the couch and rests his head on the arm of it. He pinches his forehead with his hand and closes his eyes.</p><p>\"Headache?\" I say.</p><p>He shakes his head. \"Stress.\" </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\"You guys decide on anything yet?\"</p><p>He's quiet for a moment. He inhales a slow, deep breath and exhales even slower. \"I told her I was nervous about going through with it the other night. Told her I think we needed to weigh our options. She got really upset,\" he says. He sits back up on the couch and puts his elbows on his knees. \"She accused me of thinking she would make a bad mom. That's not what I think at all, Will. I think she would make a great mom. I just think she would make an even better mom if we waited until we were ready. Now she's pissed at me. We haven't talked about it since. We're both just pretending like it's not happening or something. It's weird.\"</p><p>\"So you're both carving pumpkins?\" I say.</p><p>Gavin looks at me. \"I still don't get that analogy.\"</p> <p>I guess he wouldn't. I wish I had better advice for him.</p><p>Kiersten walks into the living room and sits down next to Gavin. \"Know what I think?\" she says.</p><p>Gavin looks at her, agitated. \"You don't even know what we're talking about, Kiersten. Go play with your toys.\"</p><p>She glares at him. \"I'm going to let that insult slide because I know you're in a bad mood. But for future reference, I don't play.\" She stares at him to make sure he doesn't have a response, then she continues talking. \"Anyway, I think you should quit feeling sorry for yourself. You're acting like a little bitch. You aren't even the one pregnant, Gavin. How do you think Eddie feels? I'm sorry, but as much as the guy likes to think he's got an equal part in these kinds of situations, he's wrong. You screwed up when you got her knocked up in the first place. Now you need to shut your mouth and be there for her. For whatever she decides to do.\" She stands up and walks to the front door. \"And Gavin? Sometimes things happen in life that you didn't plan for. All you can do now is suck it up and start mapping out a new plan.\"</p><p>She shuts the door behind her, leaving Gavin and I speechless.</p> <p>\"Did you tell her Eddie was pregnant?\" I finally ask.</p><p>He shakes his head, still staring at the door. \"No,\" he says. He continues to stare at the door in deep thought.</p><p>\"Dammit!\" he yells. \"I'm such an idiot! I'm a selfish idiot!\" He jumps up from the couch and puts on his jacket. \"I'll call you Thursday, Will. I've got to go figure out how to make this right.\"</p><p>\"Good luck,\" I say. As soon as Gavin opens the front door to walk out, Reece walks in.</p><p>\"Hi-Reece-Bye-Reece,\" Gavin says as he passes Reece. Reece turns around and watches Gavin run across the street.</p><p>\"You've got strange friends,\" he says.</p> <p>I don't argue. \"There's pizza in the fridge if you want some.\"</p><p>\"Nah. I'm just here to grab some clothes. I already ate,\" he says as he walks down the hallway.</p><p>It's Tuesday. I'm pretty sure he and Vaughn went out for the first time yesterday. Not that it bothers me in the least, but things seem to be progressing a little fast with the two of them. Reece walks back through the living room toward the front door. \"You work things out with Layken yet?\" He\u2019s shoving an extra pair of pants into his bag.</p><p>\"Almost,\" I say, eyeing his overnight bag. \"You and Vaughn seem to be hitting it off pretty well.\"</p><p>He grins at me and walks backwards out the door. \"Like I said, I've got skills.\"</p><p>I sit there on the couch and ponder my situation. I've got an old best friend who's dating the girl I spent two years of my life with. My new best friend is freaking out about becoming a dad. My girlfriend isn't speaking to me. I've got class in the morning with the very reason my girlfriend isn't speaking to me. My parallel eleven-year-old neighbor gives better advice than I do. I'm feeling a tad bit defeated right now. I lie down on the couch and try to think of something going right in my life. Anything.</p><p>Kel and Caulder walk into the living room and sit on the other couch.</p><p>\"You with wrong what's?\" Kel says backwards.</p> <p>\"Wrong not what's?\" I sigh.</p><p>\"I'm too tired to talk backwards,\" Caulder says. \"I'm just gonna talk frontwards. Will...can you come to school next Thursday and sit with me at lunch? It's supposed to be Dad day, but Dad's dead so that leaves you.\"</p><p>I close my eyes. I hate that he's so casual about not having a Dad now. Or maybe I'm glad he's so casual about it. Either way, I hate it for him. \"Sure. Just let me know what time I need to be there.\"</p><p>\"Eleven,\" he says as he stands up. \"I'm going to bed now. See ya later, Kel.\"</p><p>Caulder walks toward his bedroom and Kel stands up. I watch him as he crosses the living room. He looks just as defeated as I do right now as he heads toward the front door. When the door closes behind him, I slap myself in the forehead. You're such an idiot, Will!</p><p>I jump off the couch and follow Kel outside. \"Kel!\" I yell when I open the front door. He turns around in the street and starts walking toward me. We meet in my front yard.</p><p>\"What about you?\" I say. \"Can I have lunch with you, too?\"</p><p>Kel tries to suppress a smile, just like his sister. He shrugs. \"If you want to,\" he says.</p><p>I ruffle his hair. \"I'd be honored,\" I say.</p><p>\"Thanks, Will.\" He turns and walks back to his house. As I watch him close his front door behind him, it occurs to me that if things don\u2019t work out between Lake and I, it's not just her I'm afraid of losing.</p><p>I'm not sure how today is going to go. When I get to my first class, all I can do is wait. I'm hoping she doesn\u2019t sit by me. Surely she knows that much. Most of the students arrive and the professor finally walks in and hands out the tests. It's ten minutes after the start of class and Vaughn still hasn't shown up. I finally let out a sigh of relief and begin to focus on the lecture when she bursts through the door. She never has been much for subtlety. Of course, after she grabs her test, she comes straight up the stairs and sits right next to me. Of course she does.</p><p>\"Hey,\" she whispers. She's smiling. She looks happy. I'm hoping it has everything to do with Reece and nothing to do with me.</p><p>She rolls her eyes. \"Don't worry. This is the last day I'm sitting by you,\" she says.</p><p>I guess she could see the disappointment clearly written across my face when she walked up.</p><p>\"I just wanted to say I was sorry about last week. I also wanted to say thanks for being so cool about Reece and I dating again.\" She picks her bag up from the table and starts sifting through it, then takes out a pen.</p><p>\"Again?\" I whisper.</p><p>\"Yeah. I mean, I thought you'd be pissed that we started dating right after you and I broke up last time. Before he left for the military? Actually, it kind of upset me that it didn't piss you off,\" she says with a strange look in her eyes. \"Anyway, we decided to give it another shot. But that\u2019s all I wanted to say.\"</p><p>She turns her attention to the test in front of her.</p><p>Again? I want to ask her to repeat everything she just said, but that would mean I was inviting conversation, so I don't. But again? And I could swear she just said they dated before he left for the military. Reece left for the military two months after my parents died. If he and Vaughn dated before that...that only means one thing...he was dating her right after she broke my heart. He was dating her? The entire time I was venting to him about her, he was dating her? What a jackass. Hopefully he and Vaughn have gotten to know each other pretty well the whole three days they've been 'back' together...because he's about to need a new place to live.</p><p>I expect to confront Reece about it when I get home, but he isn't here. The entire night is relatively quiet. Kel and Caulder are spending most of the evening at Lake's house. Kiersten is too, I guess. It's just me and my thoughts. I use the rest of the evening to perfect what I want to say tomorrow night.</p><p>It's Thursday morning...the day Lake forgives me. I hope. Caulder and Kel have already left with Lake. I hear Reece in the kitchen making coffee and decide now would be a good time to go have a talk with him. To thank him for being such a great friend all these years. Jackass.</p><p>When I walk into the kitchen ready to confront him, it's not Reece making coffee. It's not Lake, either. Vaughn is standing in my kitchen with her back turned to me. In her bra. Making coffee in my kitchen. Using my coffee pot. In my house. In her bra.</p><p>Why the hell is this my life?</p><p>\"What the hell are you doing here, Vaughn?\u201d</p><p>She jumps and turns around. \"I...I didn't know you were here,\" she stutters. \"Reece said you weren't here last night.\"</p><p>\"Ugh!\" I yell, frustrated. I turn my back to her and rub my face with my hands, trying to sort out how the hell to fix this whole 'roommate' situation. Just as I'm about to kick Vaughn out, Reece walks into the kitchen.</p><p>\"What the hell, Reece? I told you not to bring her here!\"</p><p>\"Chill out, Will. What's it matter? You were asleep. You didn't even know she was here.\"</p><p>He casually walks to the cabinet and grabs a coffee cup. He's wearing boxer shorts. She's in her bra. I can't imagine what Lake would think if she walked in right now and saw Vaughn in my kitchen in her bra. I'm thisclose to getting Lake to forgive me. This would derail my entire plan.</p><p>\"Get out! Both of you, get out!\" I yell.</p><p>Neither of them moves. Vaughn looks at Reece, waiting for him to say something...or do something. Reece looks at me and rolls his eyes. \"Let me give you a piece of advice, Will. Any girl that can make you as miserable as you've been this week isn't worth it. You're being an ass. You need to drop that chick. Move on. If you ask me, she ain't worth it.\"</p><p>This little piece of advice, coming from this man who could care less about anyone but himself, pushes me over the edge. I don't even know what comes over me. I don't know if it's the comment about Lake not being worth it, or the fact that I'm now aware he lied to me for months. Either way, I lunge forward and punch the shit out of him. As soon as my fist meets his face, it's agony. Vaughn is screaming at me as I back away from him, holding onto my fist with my other hand.</p><p>Jesus! In the movies it always looks like the one being hit is the only one hurt. They never show the damage it actually does to the hands doing the hitting.</p><p>\"What the hell!?\" Reece yells, holding his jaw. I expect him to try to punch me back but he doesn't. Maybe deep down, he knows he deserves it.</p><p>\"Don't tell me she isn't worth it,\" I say, turning toward the refrigerator. I reach in and grab two ice packs. I throw one to Reece and put the other one on my fist. \"And thanks, Reece....for being such a great friend. After my parents died and she broke up with me...\" I point to Vaughn when I say 'she.' \"You were the only one willing to stick around and help me through it. Too bad I didn't know you were helping her out, too.\"</p><p>Reece looks at Vaughn. \"You told him?\" he says.</p><p>Vaughn looks confused. \"I thought he knew,\" she says defensively.</p><p>When Reece realizes I now know he dated Vaughn during the lowest point of my life, he becomes flustered. \"Will, I'm sorry. I didn't mean for it to happen. It just happened.\"</p><p>I shake my head. \"Things like that don't just happen, Reece. We've been best friends since we were ten! My whole damn world collapsed around me. For an entire month you acted like you were trying to help me get her back, but instead you were screwing her!\" </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Neither of them can look me in the eyes. \"I know I said I'd let you stay here, but things are different now.\" I throw the icepack on the counter and walk toward the hallway. \"I want you both gone. Now.\"</p><p>I shut my bedroom door behind me and collapse onto the bed. I can probably count the friends I have left on one hand. Actually, I can count them on one finger. I lay there for a while longer, wondering how I could have been so blind to his selfishness. I hear Reece walk to the spare bedroom, then the bathroom, packing up his things. I don't come back out of the bedroom until I'm positive they're both gone. When I hear his car pull away, I walk to the kitchen and pour myself a cup of coffee. I guess I\u2019ll have to start making my own coffee again.</p><p>This isn\u2019t a very good start to the day. I reach into the cabinet and grab a star out of the vase and unfold it.</p><p>\"I want to have friends that I can trust, who love me for the man I've become...not the man that I was.\" -The Avett Brothers.</p> <p>As soon as I read it, I look over my shoulder...half expecting Julia to be there smiling. It's eerie sometimes how fitting these quotes have been to the situation. Almost like she's writing them as life is happening...</p><p>Thursday, January 26th, 2012.</p><p>I can only hope that the next entry I write into this journal after my performance tonight will be something like this:</p><p>Now that I have you back, I\u2019m never letting you go. That\u2019s a promise. I\u2019m not letting you go again.</p><p>Chapter Eleven</p> <p>Gavin walks through the front door right around seven o'clock. It's the first time he's walked in without knocking. It must be contagious.</p><p>He can tell I'm a nervous wreck as soon as he sees me. \"They just left. We should let them get a head start,\" he says.</p><p>\"Good idea,\" I say. I make another walk-through of the house, trying to find something to add to the satchel. I'm pretty sure I have it all. When we finally leave, I warn Gavin I'm not going to be much for conversation on the ride there. Luckily, he understands. He always understands. That's what best friends do, I guess.</p><p>During the drive, I recite everything I need to say over and over in my head. I've got the poem down. I already talked to the guys at Club N9NE...so everything is in place there. Unfortunately, I only get one shot with her...so I've got to make it count.</p><p>When we arrive, Gavin goes inside first. He texts me a minute later and ensures me the plan is in place. I walk inside with my satchel across my shoulder and wait on my cue from the entryway. I don\u2019t want her to see me. If she sees me before it\u2019s time, she\u2019ll get angry and leave.</p><p>The seconds turn into minutes, and the minutes turn into eternity. I hate this. I\u2019ve never been so nervous about performing before. I guess because when I normally perform, there\u2019s nothing on the line. This performance tonight could very well determine my path in life. I take a deep breath and focus on my nerves when the emcee takes the microphone.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got something special planned for open mic tonight. So without further ado...\u201d he walks off the stage.</p><p>This is it. Now or never.</p><p>Everyone in the audience has their eyes glued to the stage so I go unnoticed as I walk along the wall to the right of the room and make my way to the front. Right before I walk onto the stage, I glance to the booth where they\u2019re all sitting. Lake is right in the middle with nowhere to go. She\u2019s looking down at her phone. She has no clue what\u2019s about to hit her. I\u2019ve already prepared myself for her reaction...she\u2019s going to be pissed. I just need her to hear me out long enough to get through to her. She\u2019s hard headed, but she\u2019s also reasonable.</p><p>The spotlight dims and focuses on a stool on the stage, just as I had instructed the lighting tech to do. I don\u2019t like the bright lights hindering my view of the audience, so I made sure they would all be turned off. I want to see Lake\u2019s face the entire time. I need to be able to look her in the eyes, so she\u2019ll know just how serious I am.</p><p>Before I take the stairs, I stretch my neck and arms out to ease the apprehension building up inside of me. I exhale a few breaths, then take the stage.</p><p>I walk to the stool and take a seat as I place my satchel on the floor. I take the microphone out of the stand and look straight at Lake, who finally looks up from her phone. As soon as she sees me, she frowns and shakes her head. She\u2019s pissed. She says something to Caulder, who\u2019s seated at the edge of the booth, and she points to the door. He shakes his head and doesn\u2019t move. I watch as she fidgets her hands around beside her, looking for her purse. She can\u2019t find it. She points to Kiersten who is seated on the other edge of the booth and Kiersten shakes her head, too. Lake looks at Gavin and Eddie, then at Kiersten again, then she realizes they\u2019re all in on it. After accepting the fact that they aren\u2019t going to let her out of the booth, she folds her arms across her chest and returns her focus back to the stage. Back to me.</p><p>\u201cAre you finished trying to run away yet?\u201d I say into the microphone. \u201cBecause I have a few things I\u2019d like to say to you.\u201d</p><p>The audience turns and searches for the person I\u2019m speaking to. When Lake notices everyone staring at her, she buries her face in her hands.</p> <p>I bring the audience's attention back to me. \u201cI\u2019m breaking the rules tonight,\u201d I say. \u201cI know that slams can\u2019t involve props, but I\u2019ve got a few I need to use. It\u2019s an emergency.\u201d</p><p>I bend down and pick the satchel up, then stand up and place it on the stool. I put the microphone back into the stand and position it at the right height.</p><p>\u201cLake? I know you told me you wanted me to think about everything you said the other night. I know it\u2019s only been two days, but honestly, I didn\u2019t even need two seconds. So instead of spending the last two days thinking about something I already know the answer to, I decided to do this instead. It\u2019s not a traditional slam, but I have a feeling you aren't that picky. My piece tonight is called \u201cBecause of you.\u201d</p><p>I exhale and smile at her before I begin.</p><p>\"There are moments in every relationship that define when two people start to fall in love.</p><p>A first glance</p><p>A first smile</p><p>A first kiss</p><p>A first fall...\"</p><p>(I remove the Darth Vader house shoes from my satchel and look down at them.)</p><p>\"You were wearing these during one of those moments.</p><p>One of the moments I first started to fall in love with you.</p><p>The way you gave me butterflies that morning</p><p>had absolutely nothing to do with anyone else,</p><p>and everything to do with you.</p><p>I was falling in love with you that morning</p><p>because of you.\"</p><p>(I take the next item out of the satchel. When I pull it out and look up, she brings her hands to her mouth in shock.)</p><p>\"This ugly little gnome</p><p>with his smug little grin...</p><p>He's the reason I had an excuse to invite you into my house.</p><p>Into my life.</p><p>You took a lot of aggression out on him over those next few months.</p><p>I would watch from my window as you would kick him over every time you walked by him.</p><p>Poor little guy.</p><p>You were so tenacious.</p><p>That feisty, aggressive, strong-willed side of you....</p><p>the side of you that refused to take crap from this concrete gnome?</p><p>The side of you that refused to take crap</p><p>from me?</p><p>I fell in love with that side of you</p><p>because of you.\"</p><p>(I set the gnome down on the stage and grab the c.d.)</p><p>\"This is your favorite c.d.</p><p>\u2018Layken\u2019s shit.\u2019</p><p>Although now I know you intended for shit to be possessive,</p><p>rather than descriptive.</p><p>The banjo started playing through the speakers of your car</p><p>and I immediately recognized my favorite band.</p><p>Then when I realized it was your favorite band, too?</p><p>The fact that these same lyrics inspired both of us?</p><p>I fell in love with that about you.</p><p>That had absolutely nothing to do with anyone else.</p><p>I fell in love with that about you</p><p>because of you.\"</p><p>(I take a slip of paper out of the satchel and hold it up. When I look at her, I see Eddie slide her a napkin. I can\u2019t tell from up here, but that can only mean she\u2019s crying.)</p><p>\"This is a receipt I kept.</p><p>Only because the item I purchased that night was on the verge of ridiculous.</p><p>Chocolate milk on the rocks? Who orders that?</p><p>You were different, and you didn\u2019t care.</p><p>You were being you.</p><p>A piece of me fell in love with you at that moment,</p><p>because of you.\"</p><p>\"This?\" (I hold up another sheet of paper.)</p><p>\"This I didn\u2019t really like so much.</p><p>It\u2019s the poem you wrote about me.</p><p>The one you titled 'mean?'</p><p>I don\u2019t think I ever told you...</p><p>but you made a zero.</p><p>And then I kept it</p><p>to remind myself of all the things I never want to be to you.\"</p><p>(I pull her shirt from my bag. When I hold it into the light, I sigh into the microphone.)</p><p>\"This is that ugly shirt you wear.</p><p>It doesn\u2019t really have anything to do with why I fell in love with you.</p><p>I just saw it at your house and thought I\u2019d steal it.\"</p><p>(I pull the second to last item out of my bag. Her purple hair clip. She told me once how much it meant to her, and why she always keeps it.)</p><p>\"This purple hair clip?</p><p>It really is magic...just like your dad told you it was.</p><p>It\u2019s magic because, no matter how many times it lets you down...you keep having hope in it.</p><p>You keep trusting it.</p><p>No matter how many times it fails you,</p><p>You never fail it.</p><p>Just like you never fail me.</p><p>I love that about you,</p><p>because of you.\"</p><p>(I set it back down and pull out a strip of paper and unfold it.)</p><p>\"Your mother.\"</p><p>(I sigh)</p><p>\"Your mother was an amazing woman, Lake.</p><p>I'm blessed that I got to know her,</p><p>And that she was a part of my life, too.</p><p>I came to love her as my own mom...just as she came to love Caulder and I as her own.</p><p>I didn\u2019t love her because of you, Lake.</p><p>I loved her because of her.</p><p>So, thank you for sharing her with us.</p><p>She had more advice about</p><p>Life and love and happiness and heartache than anyone I've ever known.</p><p>But the best advice she ever gave me?</p><p>The best advice she ever gave us?\"</p><p>(I read the quote in my hands)</p><p>\"Sometimes two people have to fall apart, to realize how much they need to fall back together.\"</p><p>(She\u2019s definitely crying now. I place the slip back inside the satchel and take a step closer to the edge of the stage as I hold her gaze.)</p><p>\"The last item I have wouldn\u2019t fit, because you\u2019re actually sitting in it.</p><p>That booth.</p><p>You\u2019re sitting in the exact same spot you sat in when you watched your first performance on this stage.</p><p>The way you watched this stage with passion in your eyes...I'll never forget that moment.</p><p>It's the moment I knew it was too late.</p><p>I was too far gone by then.</p><p>I was in love with you.</p><p>I was in love with you because of you.</p><p>(I back up and sit down on the stool behind me, still holding her stare.)</p><p>I could go on all night, Lake.</p><p>I could go on and on and on about all the reasons I'm in love with you. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>And you know what?

I keep my eyes locked on hers and, I'm not sure because she's pretty far away, but I think she mouths, \"I love you.\" The stage lights come back up and I'm blinded. I can't see her anymore.</p><p>I gather the items and place them back inside my satchel and jump off the stage. I immediately head to the back of the room. When I get there, she's gone. Kel and Caulder are both standing up. They let her get out. They let her leave! Eddie sees the confusion on my face so she holds up Lake's purse and shakes it. \"No worries, Will. I've still got her keys. She just walked outside, said she needed air.\"</p><p>I head to the exit and shove the door open. She's in the parking lot next to my car with her back to me, staring up at the sky. She's letting the snow fall on her face as she just stands there. I watch her for a minute, wondering what she's thinking. My biggest fear is that I misread her reaction from up on the stage and that everything I just said meant nothing to her. I slide my hands in my jacket pockets and begin walking toward her. When she hears the snow crunch beneath my feet, she turns around. The look in her eyes tells me everything I need to know. Before I take another step, she rushes to me and throws her arms around my neck, almost knocking me backwards.</p><p>\"I'm so sorry, Will. I'm so, so sorry.\" She kisses me on the cheek, the neck, the lips, the nose, the chin. She keeps saying she's sorry over and over between each kiss. I wrap my arms around her and pick her up, giving her the biggest hug I've ever given her. When I plant her feet back on the ground, she takes my face in her hands and looks into my eyes. I don\u2019t see it anymore...the heartache. She\u2019s not heartbroken anymore. I feel like the weight of the world has been lifted off my shoulders and I can finally breathe again.</p><p>\"I can't believe you kept that damn gnome,\" she whispers.</p><p>\"I can't believe you threw him away,\" I say.</p> <p>We continue to stare at each other, neither of us fully trusting that the moment is real. Or that it will last.</p><p>\"Lake?\" I stroke her hair, then the side of her face. \"I'm sorry it took me so long to get it. It's my fault you had doubts. I promise, there won't be a day that goes by from now on that I won't show you how much you mean to me.\"</p><p>A tear rolls down her cheek. \"Me too,\" she says.</p><p>My heart pounds against my chest. Not because I'm nervous. Not even because I want her worse than I've ever wanted her before. It's pounding against my chest because I realize I've never been so sure about the rest of my life than I am in this moment. This girl is the rest of my life. I lean in and kiss her. Neither of us closes our eyes. I don't think we want to miss a single second of this moment.</p><p>We're two feet from my car, so I walk her backwards until she\u2019s up against it. \"I love you,\" I somehow mutter while my lips are still meshed with hers. \"I love you so much,\" I say again. \"God, I love you.\"</p><p>She pulls away from me and smiles. Her thumbs move to my cheeks and she wipes at the tears that I didn't even realize were streaming down my face. \"I love you,\" she says. \"Now that we have that out of the way, will you just shut up and kiss me?\"</p><p>And so I do.</p><p>After several minutes of making up for all the kisses we missed out on for the last week, the cold temperature begins to affect us. Lake's bottom lip starts shivering. \"You're cold,\" I say. \"Do you want to get in my car and make out with me or should we go inside?\" I'm hoping she chooses the car.</p><p>\"The car,\" she says and smiles.</p><p>I take a step toward the car door when I realize I sat my satchel on the booth where everyone's sitting. \"Crap,\" I say as I step back to Lake and wrap my arms around her. \"My keys are inside.\" Her whole body is trembling against me now as she grows colder.</p><p>\"Then break your butterflying window and unlock the door,\" she teases.</p><p>\"A broken window would defeat the purpose of trying to keep you warm,\" I say. I do my best to warm her by pressing my face against her neck.</p><p>\"I guess you'll have to try and keep me warm in other ways.\"</p><p>Her suggestion tempts me to break the damn window. Instead, I take her hand in mine and pull her toward the entrance. As soon as we walk inside, but before we pass through the entryway, I turn around to kiss her one more time before we head to our booth. I was just going in for a quick peck, but she pulls me into her and the kiss lingers.</p><p>\"Thank you,\" she says when she pulls away. \"For what you did up there tonight. And for trapping me in the booth so I couldn't leave. You know me too well.\"</p><p>\"Thank you for listening,\" I say.</p><p>We head back to the booth hand in hand. When Kiersten sees us walking in together, she starts clapping.</p><p>\"It worked!\" she squeals. They all scoot toward the center so Lake and I can slide in. \"Will, that means you owe me more poems,\" Kiersten says.</p><p>Lake looks at me and then at Kiersten. \"Wait. You mean you two were conspiring this whole time?\" she says. \"Kiersten, did he put you up to begging me to bring you here tonight?\"</p><p>Kiersten shoots me a look and we both laugh.</p><p>\"And last weekend!\" Lake says. \"Did you knock on my door just so he could get in my house?\"</p><p>Kiersten doesn't answer her as she looks back at me. \"You owe me an early return fee,\" she says. \"I think twenty bucks should do it.\" She holds out her palm.</p><p>\"We didn't agree to monetary compensation if I remember correctly,\" I say, pulling twenty dollars from my wallet. \"But I would have paid triple that.\"</p><p>She takes the money from my hand and puts it in her pocket with a satisfied look on her face. \"I would have done it for free.\"</p><p>\"I feel used,\" Lake says.</p><p>I put my arm around her and kiss her on top of the head. \"Yeah, sorry about that. You're really hard to manipulate, though. I had to rally the forces.\"</p><p>She looks up at me and I take the opportunity to give her a quick kiss on the mouth. I can't help it. Every time her lips come within a certain proximity to mine, it's impossible not to kiss them.</p><p>\"I liked it better when you two weren't speaking,\" Caulder says.</p><p>\"Same here,\" Kel says. \"I forgot how gross it was.\"</p><p>\"I think I'm gonna be sick,\" Eddie says.</p><p>I laugh because I think Eddie\u2019s making a joke about our public display of affection. She's not. She covers her mouth with her hand and her eyes get big. Lake shoves against me and I hop out of the booth, followed by Lake and Kiersten. Eddie scoots out of the booth with her hand still over her mouth and she makes a mad dash for the bathroom. Lake runs after her.</p><p>\"What's wrong with her?\" Kiersten asks. \"Is she having nausea?\"</p><p>\"Yep,\" Gavin says flatly. \"Constantly.\"</p><p>\"Well you don't look very worried about her,\" Kiersten says.</p><p>Gavin rolls his eyes and doesn't respond. We sit quietly through another performance when I notice Gavin watching the hallway with a concerned look on his face. \"Will, hop up. I need to go check on her,\" he says. Kiersten and I get back out of the booth and Gavin exits. I grab Lake's purse and my satchel and we all follow.</p><p>\"Kiersten go inside and see if she needs me,\" Gavin says. Kiersten opens the door to the women's restroom. A minute later, she returns.</p><p>\"She said she'll be fine. Layken said for all you boys to go on and head home and us three will follow you in a few minutes. Layken needs her purse, though.\"</p><p>I hand Kiersten the purse. I'm a little bummed that Lake isn't riding with me, but I guess she did bring her own car. I'm anxious to get back to Ypsilanti. Back to our houses. I'm definitely sneaking into her room tonight.</p><p>We head outside to my car. I crank it and wipe the snow from the windows then walk over to Lake's car and wipe the snow off of her windows as well. When I get back to my car, the three of them are making their way outside.</p><p>\"You okay?\" I ask Eddie. She just nods.</p><p>I walk over to Lake and give her a quick peck on the cheek as she unlocks her door. \"I'll follow you guys in case she gets sick again and you have to pull over.\"</p><p>\"Thanks, Babe,\" she says, unlocking the doors for everyone else. She turns around and gives me a hug before climbing into her car.</p><p>\"The boys are staying at my house tonight,\" I whisper in her ear. \"After they fall asleep, I'm coming over. Wear your ugly shirt, okay?\"</p><p>She smiles. \"I can't. You stole it, remember?\"</p><p>\"Oh yeah,\" I whisper. \"In that case...I guess you just shouldn't wear one at all.\" I wink at her and walk back to my car.</p><p>\"She okay?\" Gavin asks when I get back inside the car.</p><p>\"I guess so,\" I say. \"You want to go ride with them?\"</p><p>Gavin shakes his head and sighs. \"She doesn't want me to. She's still mad at me.\"</p><p>I feel bad. I hate that Lake and I just made up right in front of them. \"She'll come around,\" I say as I pull out of the parking lot.</p><p>\"Why do you two even bother with girls?\" Kel asks. \"Both of you have been miserable for days. It's pathetic.\"</p><p>\"Someday you'll see, Kel,\" Gavin says. \"You'll see.\"</p><p>He's right. Making up with Lake later tonight will make this entire week of hell worth every second. Deep down I know it'll happen tonight. We're both way beyond the point of retreat. I suddenly become nervous at the thought.</p><p>\"Kel, you want to stay at my house tonight?\" I try to act casual with my plan to corral the boys at my place. I feel like Kel can see right through me, even though I know he can't.</p><p>\"Sure,\" he says. \"But it's a school night and Lake takes us to school on Fridays. Why doesn't Caulder just stay with me?\"</p><p>I didn't think about that. I guess Lake could just sneak over to my house after they fall asleep at her house. \"Whichever,\" I say. \"Doesn't really matter where.\"</p><p>Gavin laughs. \"I see what you're up to,\" he whispers.</p><p>I just smile.</p><p>We're about half-way home when the snow begins to fall pretty heavily. Luckily, Lake is a pretty cautious driver. I'm still following behind her even though I would normally drive about ten miles an hour faster than this. It's a good thing Eddie isn't driving though; we'd all be in trouble.</p><p>\"Gavin, you awake?\" He's staring out the window and hasn't said much since we left Detroit. I can't tell if he's lost in thought or passed out. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He grumbles a response, informing me that he's still awake.</p><p>\"Have you and Eddie talked since you left my house the other night?\"</p><p>He stretches in his seat and yawns, then puts his hands behind his head and leans back. \"Not yet. I worked a double shift yesterday. We were both in school all day today and didn't even see each other until tonight, but we were with Layken. I pulled her aside earlier and told her I wanted to talk to her later. I have a feeling she thinks it's bad. She hasn't said much to me since then.\"</p><p>\"Well, she'll be-\"</p> <p>\"Will!\" Gavin yells. My first instinct is to slam on the breaks, but I'm not sure why I'm slamming on the breaks. I glance at Gavin and his eyes are glued to the oncoming traffic in the lanes to the left of us. I turn my head and see it just as the truck crosses the median and hits the car in front of us.</p><p>Lake's car.</p><p>Part Two</p><p>Thursday, January 26th, 2012</p><p>Chapter Twelve</p> <p>I open my eyes, but don't hear anything right away. It's cold, though. I feel wind. And glass. Glass is on my shirt. Then I hear Caulder.</p><p>\"Will!\" he screams.</p><p>I turn around. Caulder and Kel both look fine, but they're panicking and trying to get out of their seat belts. Kel looks terrified. He's crying and yanking on the car door.</p><p>\"Kel, don't get out of the car. Stay in the backseat.\" My hand goes up to my eye and I pull my fingers back and there's blood on them.</p><p>I'm not sure what just happened. We must have been hit. Or we ran off the road. The back windshield is busted out and there's glass all over the car. The boys don't look cut anywhere. I look at Gavin and he's swinging his door open. He tries to jump out of the car but he's stuck in his seatbelt. He's frantic, trying to unlatch. I reach over and push the button, releasing his seatbelt for him. He trips as he lunges out of the car, but catches himself with his hands and pushes himself back up and runs. What is he running from? My eyes follow him as he runs around the car next to us. He's gone. I can't see him. I lean my head back into the headrest and close my eyes. What the hell just happened?</p><p>\"Lake!\" I yell as soon as it hits me. I swing open the car door and get hung up in the seatbelt just like Gavin did. When I free myself, I run. I don't know where I'm running to. It's dark, it's snowing and there are cars everywhere. Headlights everywhere.</p> <p>\"Sir, are you okay? You need to sit down, you're hurt.\" A man grabs my arm and tries to pull me aside but I yank my arm away from him and keep running. There are pieces of glass and metal all over the highway. My eyes dart from one side of the road to the other, but I can't make anything out. I glance back to my car and to the space in front of us where Lake's car should be. My eyes follow the broken glass to the median on the right of the highway. I see it. Her car.</p><p>I break out in a run until I reach the car. Gavin is on the passenger side. He's pulling Eddie out of the car so I run around to help him. Her eyes are closed but she winces when I pull on her arm. She's okay. I glance inside the car but Lake's not there. Her driver's side door is wide open. A sense of relief washes over me when I realize she must be okay if she's able to walk away. My eyes dart to the backseat and I see Kiersten. As soon as Eddie is lying on the ground, I climb into the backseat and shake Kiersten.</p><p>\"Kiersten,\" I say. She doesn't respond. She's got blood on her, but I'm not sure where it's coming from. \"Kiersten!\" I yell. She still doesn't respond. I take her wrist and hold it between my fingers. Gavin climbs into the backseat with me and sees me checking her pulse. He looks at me with terror in his eyes.</p><p>\"She's got a pulse,\" I say. \"Help me get her out.\" He unbuckles her seatbelt as I put my hands underneath her arms and pull her over the front seat. Gavin climbs out first and grabs her legs and helps me pull her out of the car. We lay her next to Eddie. Next to an ever-growing crowd of concerned bystanders. I glance at all of them, but none of them are Lake.</p><p>\"Where the hell did she go?\" I stand up and look around. \"Stay with them,\" I tell Gavin. \"I need to find Lake. She's probably looking for Kel.\"</p><p>Gavin nods.</p><p>I walk around several vehicles and pass the truck that hit them. What's left of the truck, anyway. There are several people surrounding it, talking to the driver inside, telling him to wait for help before he gets out. I'm in the middle of the highway, calling her name. Where did she go? I run back to my car and Kel and Caulder are both still inside.</p><p>\"Is she okay?\" Kel asks. \"Is Layken okay?\" He's crying.</p> <p>\"Yeah, I think so. She walked away...I just can't find her. You guys stay here, I'll be right back.\"</p><p>I finally hear sirens as I'm making my way back to Lake's car. When the emergency vehicles come closer, their flashing lights illuminate all the chaos...almost emphasizing it. I look at Gavin. He's hovering over Kiersten checking her pulse again. The sound of the sirens fade as I watch everyone around me move in slow motion.</p><p>All I can hear is the sound of my own breath.</p><p>An ambulance pulls up beside me and the lights slowly make their way in a circle...as if their job as lights is to display the perimeter of the damage. I follow along with my eyes as one of the red lights slowly illuminates across my car, then the car next to mine, then over the top of Lake's car, then on top of the truck that hit them, then across Lake lying in the snow. Lake! As soon as the red light circles further, it's dark and I don't see her anymore. I run.</p><p>I try to scream her name, but nothing comes out. There are people in my way, but I just shove past them. I keep running and running, but it feels like the distance between us keeps getting further and further away.</p><p>\"Will!\" I hear Gavin yell. He's off the ground and running after me.</p><p>When I finally reach her, she's just lying there in the snow with her eyes closed. There's blood on her head. So much blood. I tear off my jacket and throw it in the snow and remove my shirt. I begin wiping the blood off of her face with it, trying desperately to find her injuries.</p><p>\"Lake! No, no, no. Lake, no.\" I touch her face with my hand, trying to gain some sort of reaction out of her. It\u2019s cold. She's so cold. As soon as I put my hands under her shoulders to pull her into my lap, someone pulls me back. Paramedics swarm her as I'm being pulled away from her. I can't see her anymore. I can't see her.</p><p>\"Will!\" Gavin yells. He's in my face. He's shaking me. \"Will! We need to get to the hospital. They'll take her there. We need to go.\"</p><p>He's trying to push me away from her. I can't speak, so I shake my head and push him out of my way. I start to run back to them. Back to her. He pulls me back again. \"Will, don't! Let them help her.\"</p><p>I turn around and shove him, then run back to her. They're moving her onto a gurney when I skid to a stop in the snow right next to her. \"Lake!\"</p><p>One of the paramedics pushes me back as the others lift her up and carry her to the ambulance. \"I need in there!\" I yell. \"Let me in there!\" The paramedic won't let me by as they shut the doors and tap on the glass. The ambulance pulls away. As soon as its lights fade into the distance, I fall to my knees.</p><p>I can't breathe.</p><p>I can't breathe.</p><p>I still can't breathe.</p><p>Thursday, January 26th, 2012.</p><p>Chapter Thirteen</p><p>When I open my eyes, I immediately have to close them again. It's so bright. I'm shaking. My whole body is shaking. Actually, it's not my body that's shaking at all. It's whatever I'm lying on that's shaking.</p><p>\"Will? Are you okay?\"</p><p>I hear Caulder's voice. I open my eyes and see him sitting next to me. We're in an ambulance. He's crying. I try to sit up to hug him, but someone pushes me back down.</p><p>\"Be still, Sir. You've got a pretty bad gash I'm working on here.\"</p><p>I look at the person talking to me. It's the paramedic that was holding me back. \"Is she okay?\" I feel myself succumb to the panic again. \"Where is she? Is she okay?\"</p><p>He puts his hand on my shoulder to hold me still and places gauze over my eye. \"I wish I knew something...but I don't. I\u2019m sorry. I just know I need to get this injury of yours closed. We'll get more information when we get there.\"</p><p>I look around the ambulance but I don't see Kel. \"Where's Kel?\"</p><p>\"They put him and Gavin in the other ambulance to check on them. They said we would see them at the hospital,\" Caulder says.</p><p>I lay my head back, close my eyes and pray.</p><p>As soon as the ambulance doors open and they pull me out, I jump off the gurney.</p><p>\"Sir, get back here! You need stitches!\"</p><p>I keep running. I glance back to make sure Caulder is following me. He is, so I keep running. When I get inside, Gavin and Kel are standing at the nurses' station. \"Kel!\" I yell. Kel runs up to me and hugs me. I pick him up and he wraps his arms around my neck. \"Where are they?\" I say to Gavin. \"Where'd they take them?\"</p><p>\"I can't find anyone,\" Gavin says. He looks as panicked as I do. He sees a nurse round the corner and he runs up to her. \"We're looking for three girls that were just brought here?\u201d</p><p>She glances at all four of us, then walks around the desk to her computer. \"Are you family?\"</p><p>Gavin looks at me, then back at her. \"Yes,\" he lies.</p><p>She eyes Gavin and picks up the phone. \"The family is here,\" she says. She listens. \"Yes, sir.\"</p><p>She hangs up the phone and stands up. \"Follow me,\" she says. She leads us around the corner and into a room. \"The Dr. will be with you as soon as possible.\" She turns and walks away.</p><p>I set Kel down in a chair. Caulder sits next to him. Gavin takes his jacket off and hands it to me. I look down and realize for the first time since I took it off, that I'm not even wearing a shirt. I pull the jacket on. Gavin and I pace the room. Several minutes pass and I can't take it anymore.</p><p>\"I've got to find her,\" I say. I start to walk out of the room and Gavin pulls me back. \"Just give it a minute, Will. If they try to find you, you won't be here. Just give it a minute.\"</p><p>I begin to pace again. Every now and then I lean down and hug Kel, who's still crying. He hasn\u2019t said anything. Not a single word.</p><p>She has to be okay. She has to.</p><p>I glance across the hall and see a restroom. I go inside and as soon as I shut the door behind me, I immediately get sick. I lean over the toilet as I vomit. When I think I'm finished, I wash my hands in the sink and rinse my mouth out. I grip the edges of the sink and take a deep breath, trying to calm down. I need to calm down for Kel. He doesn't need to see me like this.</p><p>When I look in the mirror, I don't even recognize myself. There's dried blood all over the side of my face. The bandage the paramedic placed on top of my eye is already saturated again. I grab a napkin and try to wipe some of the blood off. As I'm wiping, I find myself wishing I had some of Sherry's medicine.</p><p>Sherry. \"Sherry!\" I yell. I throw open the bathroom door. \"Gavin! We have to call Sherry! Where's your phone?\"</p><p>Gavin pats his pockets. \"I think it's in my jacket,\" he says. \"I need to call Joel.\"</p><p>I reach into his jacket and pull out his phone. \"Shit! I don't know her number, it's in my phone.\"</p><p>\"I know her number. Hand it to me, I'll dial it,\" Kel says. He wipes his eyes and reaches out for the phone, so I hand it to him. When he punches in the numbers and hands me the phone back, I suddenly feel sick again. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Sherry picks up on the second ring. \"Hello?\"</p><p>I can't speak. What am I supposed to say?</p><p>\"Hello?\" she says again.</p><p>\"Sherry,\" I say. My voice cracks.</p> <p>\"Will?\" she says. \"Will? What's wrong?\"</p><p>\"Sherry,\" I say again. \"We\u2019re at the hospital...they...\"</p><p>\"Will! Is she okay? Is Kiersten okay?\"</p><p>I can\u2019t respond. I\u2019m sick again. Gavin takes the phone from my hand and I run back to the bathroom.</p><p>There's a knock on the bathroom door a few minutes later. I'm sitting in the floor against the wall with my eyes closed. I don't respond to the knock. When the door opens, I look up. It's the paramedic.</p> <p>\"We've still got to get you stitched up,\" he says. \"You've got a pretty bad cut.\" He reaches down and offers his hand. I take it and he pulls me up. I follow him down the hall and into an exam room where he instructs me to lie back on the table. \"Your friend said you've had some nausea. You more than likely have a concussion. Stay here, the nurse will be here in a minute.\"</p><p>After I\u2019m stitched up and given instructions on how to care for the apparent concussion I have, I'm told to go to the nurse\u2019s station to fill out paperwork. When I get to the nurse's station, the nurse grabs a clipboard and hands it to me. \"Which patient is your wife?\" she asks. I just stare at her.</p><p>\"My wife?\" Then it dawns on me that Gavin told her we were related to them. I guess it's better if they think that. I'll get more information that way. \"Layken Cohen...Cooper. Layken Cooper.\"</p><p>\"Fill out these forms and bring them back to me. And if you don't mind, take these forms to the other gentleman with you. What about the little girl? Is she related to you?\"</p><p>I shake my head. \"She's my neighbor. Her mother\u2019s on her way.\"</p><p>I grab the paperwork and head back to the waiting room.</p> <p>\"Any news?\" I ask, handing Gavin his clipboard. Gavin just shakes his head.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve been here almost an hour! Where is everybody?\u201d I throw my clipboard in the chair and sit down. Just as I land in the chair, a man in a white lab coat rounds the corner and walks toward us, followed by a frantic Sherry. I jump back up.</p><p>\"Will!\" she yells. She's crying. \"Where is she? Where's Kiersten? Is she hurt?\"</p><p>I walk to Sherry and put my arms around her, then look at the doctor for answers since I don't have any. He looks at Sherry. \"Is the little girl who you're looking for?\" he asks. Sherry nods. \"She'll be okay. She's got a broken arm, but other than that she just got hit on the head pretty hard. We\u2019re still waiting on a few test results but you're welcome to go see her. I've just put her in room 212. If you'll head to the nurses\u2019 station she can direct you.\"</p><p>\"Oh, thank god,\" I say. Sherry lets go of me and darts around the corner.</p><p>\"Which one of you is with the other young lady?\" he asks.</p><p>Gavin and I both look at each other. The doctor's singular reference makes my heart stop.</p><p>\"There are two!\" I yell, frantic. \"There are two of them!\"</p> <p>He looks puzzled as to why I'm yelling at him. \"I'm sorry,\" he says. \"I was only brought the girl and a young lady. Sometimes when they go straight to surgery, they don't come to me first. I only have news on a young lady with the blond hair.\"</p><p>\"Eddie! Is she okay?\" Gavin asks.</p><p>\"She's stable. They're still running some tests, so you can't go back yet.\"</p><p>\"What about the baby? Is the baby okay?\"</p><p>\"That's why they're running tests, sir. I'll be back as soon as I know more.\"</p><p>He starts to walk away when I run after him and cut him off in the hallway. \"Wait!\" I say. \"What about Lake? I haven't heard anything. Is she okay? Is she in surgery? Why is she in surgery?\"</p><p>He looks at me with pity in his eyes. It makes me want to punch him.</p><p>\"I'm sorry, sir. I only treated the other two. I'll do my best to find some answers and get back with you as soon as I can.\" He walks away in a hurry.</p><p>They\u2019re not telling me anything! They aren\u2019t telling me a damn thing! I lean against the wall of the hallway and slide down to the floor. I pull my knees up and rest my elbows on them and bury my face in my hands.</p><p>\u201cWill?\u201d</p><p>I look up and Kel is looking down at me.</p><p>\u201cWhy won\u2019t they just tell us if she\u2019s okay or not?\u201d</p><p>I grab his hand and pull him to the floor with me. I put my arm around him and he hugs me back. I stroke his hair and kiss him on top of the head, because I know that\u2019s what Lake would do. \"I don't know, Kel. I don't know.\" I hold him while he cries. As much as I want to scream; as much as I want to cry; as much as my world is crashing down around me...I have to hold it all in for this little boy. I can't even begin to imagine what he's feeling. How scared he must be. Lake is the only thing he has in this world. I hold him and kiss his head until he cries himself to sleep.</p><p>\u201cWill?\u201d</p><p>I look up and Sherry is standing over me. I start to stand up but she shakes her head and points at Kel who has fallen asleep in my lap. She sits down in the floor next to me.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s Kiersten?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019ll be okay. She\u2019s asleep. They may not even keep her overnight.\u201d She reaches over and strokes Kel's hair. \u201cGavin said you guys haven\u2019t heard anything about Layken yet?\u201d</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cIt\u2019s been over an hour, Sherry.\u201d I turn my head and look at her. \u201cWhy aren\u2019t they telling me anything? They won\u2019t even tell me if she\u2019s...\u201d I can\u2019t finish the sentence. I inhale a deep breath, trying my best to maintain my composure for Kel\u2019s sake.</p><p>\u201cWill...if that were the case they would have told you so by now. It means they\u2019re doing everything they can.\u201d</p><p>I know she\u2019s just trying to help, but her statement hits me hard. I pick Kel up and carry him back to the waiting room and sit him in the chair next to Gavin.</p><p>\"I'll be back,\" I say. I run down the hallway to the nurse\u2019s station, but naturally there isn\u2019t anyone there. The doors that lead to the emergency rooms stay locked, so they don\u2019t budge when I try to open them. I look around for someone. There are a few people staring at me in the general waiting area, but no one offers to assist me. I walk to the area behind the nurses\u2019 station and look around until I find the button that opens the doors. I press the button, then jump over the desk and run through the doors just as they open.</p><p>\u201cCan I help you?\u201d a nurse asks when I pass her in the hallway. I keep running. I round a corner and see a sign that says patient rooms to the right, surgery to the left. I turn left. As soon as I see the double doors that lead to the operating rooms, I hit the button on the wall to open them. Before they're even open far enough, I try to squeeze myself through them but a man pushes me back.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t be in here,\u201d he says.</p><p>\u201cNo! I need in there!\u201d I continue to try and shove past him.</p><p>He\u2019s a lot stronger than me. He pushes me against the wall and lifts his leg, kicking the button with his foot. The doors close behind him. \u201cYou aren\u2019t allowed in there,\u201d he says calmly. \u201cNow who are you looking for?\u201d He releases his grip on my arms and stands back.</p><p>\u201cMy girlfriend,\u201d I say. I\u2019m out of breath. I lean forward and put my hands on my knees. \u201cI need to know if she\u2019s okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got a patient... a young lady who was just brought in about an hour ago. Is that who you\u2019re referring to?\u201d</p><p>I nod. \u201cIs she okay?\u201d</p><p>He walks past me and leans against the wall next to me. He slides his hands into the pockets of his white coat and pulls one of his knees up, settling his foot against the wall behind him. \u201cShe's hurt. She has an epidural hematoma that\u2019s going to require immediate surgery.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is that? What does that mean? Will she be okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe experienced severe head trauma that has caused bleeding in her brain. It\u2019s too early to give you any more information at this point. Until we get her into surgery, we won\u2019t know the extent of her injuries. I was just coming to speak to the family. Do you need me to go relay this information to her parents?\u201d</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t have any. She doesn\u2019t have anyone. I'm all she's got.\u201d</p><p>He straightens up and walks back to the doors and presses the button. He turns around just as they open. \u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d he asks.</p><p>\u201cWill.\u201d</p><p>He looks me in the eyes. \u201cI\u2019m Dr. Bradshaw,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ll do everything I can for her, Will. In the meantime, go back to the waiting room. I\u2019ll find you as soon as I know something.\u201d He turns and the doors close behind him.</p><p>I slide down to the floor. She\u2019s alive.</p><p>When I get back to the waiting room, Kel and Caulder are the only ones there.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Gavin?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\"Joel called. Gavin went outside to meet him,\" Caulder says.</p><p>\u201cDid you hear anything?\u201d Kel asks.</p><p>I nod. \u201cShe\u2019s in surgery.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo she's alive? She's alive?\u201d He jumps up and wraps his arms around me. I return his hug.</p><p>\"She's alive,\" I whisper. I sit down and gently guide him back into his chair. \u201cKel, she's hurt pretty bad. It's too soon to know anything at this point...but they'll keep us updated, okay?\u201d I reach over and grab a tissue from one of the many boxes of tissues scattered around the room and hand it to him. He wipes his nose.</p><p>We all sit there in silence. I close my eyes and think back to the conversation I just had with the doctor. Were there any hints in his expression? In his voice? I know he knows more than he\u2019s telling me, which scares the hell out of me. What if something happens to her? I can\u2019t think about it. I don\u2019t think about. She\u2019ll be okay. She has to be.</p><p>\u201cAnything?\u201d Gavin asks as he and Joel walk into the waiting room. \u201cI had Joel grab you a shirt,\u201d he says, handing it to me.</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d I give Gavin his jacket and pull the shirt on. \u201cLake\u2019s in surgery. She\u2019s got a head injury. They don\u2019t know anything yet. That\u2019s all I know.\u201d</p><p>Gavin nods.</p><p>\u201cWhat about Eddie?\u201d I ask. \u201cHave you heard anything else? Is the baby okay?\u201d</p><p>Gavin looks at me wide-eyed.</p><p>Joel jumps up. \u201cBaby?\u201d he yells. \u201cWhat the hell is he talking about, Gavin?\u201d</p><p>Gavin stands up. \u201cWe were going to tell you, Joel. It\u2019s still so early...we...we haven\u2019t had a chance.\u201d</p><p>Joel storms out and Gavin follows after him.</p><p>I\u2019m such an idiot.</p><p>\u201cCan we go see Kiersten?\u201d Kel asks.</p><p>I nod. \u201cDon\u2019t stay too long. She needs her rest.\u201d</p><p>They both leave.</p><p>I\u2019m alone. I close my eyes and lean my head against the wall. I take several deep breaths, but the pressure in my chest just keeps building and building and building. I try to keep holding it all in. I try to hold it in just like Lake does. I can't. I bring my hands to my face and break down. I don\u2019t just cry. I sob. I wail. I scream. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Thursday or Friday, January 26th or 27th, 2012</p><p>Now that I have you back, I\u2019m never letting you go. That\u2019s a promise. I\u2019m not letting you go again.</p><p>Chapter Fourteen</p><p>I\u2019m in the bathroom splashing water on my face when I hear someone talking outside the door. I swing it open to see if it\u2019s the doctor, but it\u2019s just Gavin and Joel. I start to shut the door again when Gavin reaches his hand in and stops me.</p> <p>\u201cWill, your grandparents are here. They\u2019re looking for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy grandparents? Who called them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did,\u201d he says. \u201cI thought maybe they could take Kel and Caulder for you.\u201d</p><p>I step out of the bathroom. \u201cWhere are they?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAround the corner,\u201d he says.</p> <p>I walk around the corner and see my grandparents standing in the hallway. My grandfather has his coat folded over his hands. He\u2019s saying something to my grandmother when he catches a glimpse of me.</p><p>\u201cWill!\u201d They both run toward me.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d my grandmother says, brushing her fingers against the bandages on my forehead. I pull my head away from her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d I say.</p><p>She hugs me. \u201cHave you heard anything?\u201d</p><p>I shake my head. I\u2019m getting really tired of this question.</p> <p>\u201cWhere are the boys?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re up in Kiersten\u2019s room,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cKiersten? She was involved, too?\u201d</p><p>I nod.</p><p>\u201cWill, the nurse is asking about paperwork. They need it. Have you finished filling it out yet?\u201d my grandfather says.</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cI haven't started it yet. I don\u2019t feel like doing paperwork right now.\u201d I begin walking back to the waiting room. I need to sit down.</p><p>Gavin and Joel are seated in the waiting room again. I guess Joel is temporarily carving pumpkins regarding Eddie\u2019s pregnancy. Gavin looks awful. I didn\u2019t notice before, but his arm is in a sling.</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d I ask, nudging my head in the direction of the sling.</p> <p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>I sit down and prop my legs up on the table in front of me and lean my head against the back of the chair. My grandparent\u2019s take the seats on the wall opposite of me. Everyone\u2019s staring at me. I feel like they\u2019re all waiting on me. I don\u2019t know what they\u2019re waiting on. Waiting for me to cry, maybe? To yell? To hit something?</p><p>\u201cWhat!\u201d I yell at all of them. My grandmother flinches. I immediately feel guilty, but I don\u2019t apologize. I close my eyes and inhale a deep breath, trying to figure out the order of events. I remember talking to Gavin about Eddie, and I remember Gavin yelling. I even remember slamming on the brakes, but I can\u2019t remember why. I can\u2019t remember anything after that...up to opening my eyes in the car.</p><p>I bring my legs off the table and turn to Gavin. \u201cWhat happened, Gavin? I don\u2019t remember.\u201d</p><p>He makes a face like he\u2019s tired of explaining. He explains it anyway, though. \u201cA truck crossed the median and hit their car. You slammed on your brakes, so we weren\u2019t involved in that wreck. But when you slammed on your brakes, we were hit from behind. It knocked us into the ditch. As soon as I got out of the car, I ran to Layken\u2019s car. I saw her get out so I thought she was okay...that\u2019s when I went to check on Eddie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you saw her? She got out on her own? She wasn\u2019t thrown from the car?\u201d</p><p>He shakes his head. \u201cNo, I think she was confused and must have passed out. But I saw her walking.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t know if the fact that she got out on her own even makes a difference, but it somehow eases my mind a little. My grandfather leans forward in his chair and looks at me.</p><p>\u201cWill. I know you don\u2019t want to deal with it right now, but they need as much information as you can give them. They don\u2019t even know her name. They need to know if she\u2019s allergic to anything. Does she have insurance? If you give them her social security number, they may be able to figure a lot of this out.\u201d</p><p>I sigh. \u201cI don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know if she has insurance. I don\u2019t know her social. I don\u2019t know if she\u2019s allergic to anything. She hasn\u2019t got anyone but me, and I don\u2019t know a damn thing!\u201d I lay my head in my hands, almost ashamed of the fact that Lake and I have never even discussed any of this before. Didn\u2019t we learn anything? Didn\u2019t I learn anything from my parent\u2019s death? From Julia\u2019s death? Here I am, possibly facing my past head-on again...unprepared and overwhelmed.</p><p>My grandfather walks over to me and wraps his arms around me. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Will. We\u2019ll figure it out.\u201d</p><p>Another hour passes with no word. Not even about Eddie. Joel goes with my grandparents to take Kel and Caulder to the cafeteria for food. Gavin stays with me.</p><p>I guess Gavin gets tired of sitting in the chairs because he gets up and lays down in the floor. It looks like a good idea, so I do the same thing. I put my hands under my head and raise my feet up into a chair.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m trying not to think about it, Will. But if the baby isn\u2019t okay...Eddie...\u201d</p><p>I hear the fear in his voice. He can\u2019t even finish his sentence.</p><p>\u201cGavin...stop. Stop thinking about it. Let\u2019s just think about something else for a while. We\u2019ll drive ourselves insane if we don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah...\u201d he says.</p><p>We\u2019re both silent, so I know we\u2019re both still thinking about it. I try to think about anything else.</p><p>\u201cI kicked Reece out this morning,\u201d I say, doing my best tear our minds away from reality.</p><p>\u201cWhy? I thought you guys were best friends,\u201d he says. He sounds relieved to be talking about something else, too.</p><p>\u201cWe used to be. Things change. People change. People get new best friends,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cThat they do.\u201d</p><p>We\u2019re both quiet again for a while. My mind starts drifting back to Lake, so I reel myself back in. \u201cI punched him,\u201d I say. \u201cRight in the jaw. It was beautiful. I wish you could\u2019ve seen it.\u201d</p><p>Gavin laughs. \u201cGood. I never have liked him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not so sure I did, either,\" I say. \"It\u2019s just one of those things where you feel obligated to the friendship, I guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThose are the worst kind,\u201d he says.</p><p>We're silent again. Every now and then, one of us will lift our head when we hear someone walk by. We eventually become too tired to even do that. I begin to drift off to sleep when I'm sucked back into reality.</p><p>\u201cSir?\u201d someone says from the doorway. Gavin and I both jump up.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s in a room now,\u201d the nurse says to Gavin. \u201cYou can go see her. Room 207.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s okay? Is the baby okay?\u201d</p><p>The nurse nods at him and smiles.</p><p>And he\u2019s gone. Just like that.</p><p>The nurse turns to me. \u201cDr. Bradshaw wanted me to let you know they\u2019re still in surgery. He doesn\u2019t have any updates yet, but we\u2019ll let you know as soon as we find something out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d I say.</p><p>My grandparent\u2019s eventually come back with Kel and Caulder. My grandfather and Kel are trying to fill out the paperwork for Lake as best they can. There aren\u2019t any questions on the form I could answer that Kel doesn\u2019t already know the answer to. They leave most of the questions blank. My grandfather walks the forms to the nurses\u2019 station and returns with a box.</p><p>\u201cThese are some of the personal items that were found in the vehicles,\u201d he says to me. \u201cTake what\u2019s yours and Layken\u2019s and leave the rest in the box. I\u2019ll take it back.\u201d</p><p>I lean forward and look inside the box. My satchel is on top, so I pull it out. Lake\u2019s purse is there. So are my cell phone and my jacket. I don\u2019t see her phone, though. That doesn\u2019t mean anything...she probably just lost it again. I open her purse and pull out her wallet and hand it to my grandfather.</p><p>\u201cLook in there. She might have an insurance card or something.\u201d</p><p>He takes the wallet out of my hands and opens it. They must have already given Eddie\u2019s things to Gavin, because there\u2019s nothing left in the box.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s late,\u201d my grandmother says. \u201cWe\u2019ll take the boys home with us so they can get some rest. Do you need anything before we go?\u201d she says.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to go,\u201d Kel says.</p><p>\u201cKel, sweetie. You need some rest. There isn\u2019t anywhere you can sleep here,\u201d she says.</p><p>Kel looks at me and silently pleads.</p><p>\u201cHe can stay with me,\u201d I say.</p><p>My grandmother picks up her purse and coat. I follow them out and walk down the hall with them. When we get to the end of the hallway I stop and give Caulder a hug. \u201cI\u2019ll call you as soon as I find out anything,\u201d I say to him. My grandparents hug me goodbye and they leave. My entire family leaves.</p><p>I\u2019m almost asleep when I feel someone shaking my shoulder. I jerk up and look around, hoping someone\u2019s here with some news. It\u2019s just Kel.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m thirsty,\u201d he says.</p><p>I look down at my watch. It\u2019s after midnight now. Why haven\u2019t they told me anything yet? I reach into my pocket and take out my wallet. \u201cHere,\u201d I say, handing him some cash. \u201cBring me a coffee.\u201d Kel takes the money and leaves, just as Gavin walks back into the room. He looks at me for answers, but I just shake my head letting him know I still don\u2019t know anything. He sits down in the seat next to me.</p><p>\u201cSo Eddie\u2019s okay?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cYeah. She\u2019s bruised up, but she\u2019s okay,\u201d he says.</p><p>We\u2019re both quiet for a while. I\u2019m too tired to make small talk. Gavin fills the silent void.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s further along than we thought she was,\u201d he says. \u201cShe\u2019s about sixteen weeks. They let us see the baby on a monitor. They\u2019re pretty sure it\u2019s a girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh yeah?\u201d I say. I\u2019m still not sure how Gavin feels about the whole thing, so I refrain from congratulating him. Doesn\u2019t feel like a good situation for congratulations right now, anyway.</p><p>\u201cI saw her heart beating,\u201d he says.</p><p>\u201cWhose? Eddies?\u201d</p><p>He shakes his head and smiles at me. \u201cNo. My baby girl\u2019s.\u201d His eyes tear up and he looks away.</p><p>I smile. \u201cCongratulations.\u201d</p><p>Kel walks into the room with two coffees. He hands me one and plops down in the chair and takes a sip of the other.</p><p>\u201cAre you drinking coffee?\u201d I ask him.</p><p>He nods. \u201cDon\u2019t try to take it from me, either. I\u2019ll run.\u201d</p><p>I laugh. \u201cOkay, then,\u201d I say. I bring the coffee up to my mouth but before I take a sip, Dr. Bradshaw walks in. I jump up and the coffee splashes on my shirt. Or Joel's shirt. Or Gavin\u2019s. Whoever the hell\u2019s shirt I have on, it\u2019s got coffee all over it now.</p><p>\u201cWill? Walk with me?\u201d Dr. Bradshaw nudges his head toward the hallway.</p><p>\u201cWait here Kel, I\u2019ll be right back.\u201d I set the coffee down on the table and walk out.</p><p>We walk to the end of the hallway before he says anything. I have to brace myself against the wall...I feel like I\u2019m about to collapse. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cShe made it through surgery, but we aren\u2019t close to being in the clear yet. She had a lot of bleeding. Some swelling. I did what I could without having to remove a portion of her parietal bone...now all we can do is watch and wait.\u201d</p><p>My heart is pounding against my chest. It\u2019s hard to pay attention when I have a million questions on the tip of my tongue. \u201cWhat is it we\u2019re waiting for? If she made it this far, what are the dangers?\u201d</p><p>He leans against the wall next to me. We\u2019re both staring at our feet, almost like he\u2019s trying to avoid looking me in the eyes. I know he has to hate this part of his job. I hate this part of his job. That\u2019s why I don\u2019t look him in the eyes...I feel like maybe it takes the pressure off of him.</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t exactly know the extent of the injuries. We won\u2019t know until we can run scans, but for right now, we\u2019re keeping her under anesthesia. Hopefully by morning we\u2019ll have more of an idea of what we\u2019re dealing with.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCan I see her?\u201d</p><p>He sighs. \u201cNot yet. She\u2019s in recovery throughout the night. I\u2019ll let you know as soon as they take her to ICU.\u201d He stands up and puts his hands into the pockets of his lab coat. \u201cDo you have any more questions, Will?\u201d</p><p>I look him in the eyes. \u201cA million,\u201d I reply.</p><p>He takes my response as it was rhetorically intended and he walks away.</p><p>When I walk back into the room, Gavin is still sitting with Kel. Kel jumps up and rushes to me. \u201cIs she okay?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShe\u2019s out of surgery,\u201d I say. \u201cBut they still won\u2019t know anything until tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKnow anything about what?\u201d Kel asks.</p><p>I sit down and motion for Kel to sit down next to me. I pause for a moment so I can find the right words. I want to tell him in a way he\u2019ll understand. \u201cWhen she hit her head, she hurt her brain, Kel. Until they can do scans, they won\u2019t know if there\u2019s any damage, or how bad it is.\u201d</p><p>Gavin stands up. \u201cI\u2019ll go tell Eddie. She\u2019s been hysterical,\u201d Gavin says.</p><p>When he leaves the room I soak in the moment. I feel like a weight should be lifted off of my shoulders after finally getting answers, but it doesn\u2019t feel that way at all. It feels worse. I feel so much worse. I just want to see her.</p><p>\u201cWill?\u201d Kel says.</p> <p>\u201cYeah?\u201d I reply. I\u2019m too tired to even look at him. I can\u2019t even keep my eyes open.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019ll happen to me? If....she can\u2019t take care of me? Where will I go?\u201d</p><p>I manage to open my eyes and look at him. As soon as we make eye contact, he starts crying. I lean over and wrap my arms around him and put his head against my chest. \u201cYou aren\u2019t going anywhere, Kel. We\u2019re in this together. You and me.\u201d I pull back and look him in the eyes. \u201cI mean it. No matter what happens...\u201d</p><p>Friday, January 27th, 2012</p><p>Kel,</p><p>I don\u2019t know what\u2019s about to happen in our lives. I wish I did. God, I wish I did.</p><p>I was lucky enough to be nineteen when I lost my parents; you were only nine. That\u2019s a lot of growing up left to do for a little boy without a dad.</p><p>But whatever happens...whichever road we have to take when we leave this hospital...we\u2019re taking it together.</p> <p>I\u2019ll do my best to help you finish growing up with the closest thing to a dad you can have. I\u2019ll do my absolute best.</p><p>I don\u2019t know what\u2019s about to happen in our lives. I wish I did. God, I wish I did.</p><p>But whatever happens, I\u2019ll love you. I can promise you that.</p><p>Chapter Fifteen</p><p>\u201cWill.\u201d</p><p>I try to open my eyes, but only one of them opens. I\u2019m in the floor again. I close my eye before my entire head explodes.</p><p>\u201cWill, wake up.\u201d</p><p>I sit up and run my hands along the chairs next to me, pulling myself into one by the arm. I still can\u2019t open my other eye. I shield the fluorescent lights with my hands and turn my head toward the voice.</p><p>\u201cWill, I need you to listen to me.\u201d</p><p>I finally recognize the voice as Sherry. \u201cI\u2019m listening,\u201d I whisper. It feels like if I spoke in any louder of a tone, it would be too painful. My whole head hurts. I bring my hand to the bandage over my eye, then to my eye. It\u2019s swollen. No wonder I can\u2019t open it.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m having the nurse bring you some medicine. You need to eat something. They aren\u2019t keeping Kiersten so we\u2019re going home soon. I\u2019ll be back for Kel after I get her into the car. I\u2019ll bring him back up here during the day, I just think he needs some rest. Is there anything you need from your house? Besides a change of clothes?\u201d</p><p>I shake my head. It hurts less than actually speaking.</p><p>\u201cOkay. Call me if you think of anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSherry,\u201d I say just as she exits. When I say her name, I realize nothing audible even comes out of my mouth. \u201cSherry!\u201d I say louder. When I say it, I wince. Why does my head hurt so bad?</p><p>She comes back to the door.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a vase in my cabinet. Above the fridge. I need it.\u201d</p><p>She acknowledges what I said with a nod and turns to leave again.</p><p>\u201cKel,\u201d I say, shaking him awake. \u201cI\u2019m going to get something to drink. Do you want anything?\u201d</p><p>He nods. \u201cCoffee.\u201d</p><p>He must not be a morning person...just like his sister. When I pass the nurses\u2019 station, one of the nurse\u2019s calls my name. I back step and she holds out her hand. \u201cThese will help your head,\u201d she says. \u201cYour mother said you needed them.\u201d</p><p>I laugh. My mother. I pop the pills into my mouth and swallow them and head to find coffee. The double doors in the lobby open as I pass them, sending a swarm of cold air around me. I stop and look outside, then decide some fresh air might do me some good. I take seat on a bench under the awning. Everything\u2019s so white. The snow is still falling. I wonder how bad our driveways will be by the time we get back home?</p><p>I don\u2019t know how it happens; how the thought even creeps its way into my head...but for a second I wonder what would happen to everything in Lake\u2019s house if she dies. She doesn\u2019t have any family to finalize anything for her. To finalize her banks accounts, her bills, her insurance, her possessions. We aren\u2019t related and Kel\u2019s only eleven. Would they even let me do that for her? Would I even legally be allowed? Am I even legally allowed to keep Kel? As soon as the thoughts register in my mind, I force them back. It\u2019s pointless thinking like this, because it isn\u2019t going to happen. I get pissed at myself for letting my mind get carried away, so I head back inside to get the coffee.</p><p>When I return to the waiting room, Dr. Bradshaw is sitting with Kel. They don\u2019t notice me right away. He's telling Kel a story. Kel's laughing, so I don't interrupt him. It's nice to hear Kel laugh. I stand outside the door and listen.</p><p>\u201cThen when my mother told me to go get the box to bury the cat, I told her there was no need. I\u2019d already brought him back to life,\u201d Dr. Bradshaw says. \u201cIt was that moment, after I resuscitated that kitten, I knew I wanted to be a doctor when I grew up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you saved the kitten?\u201d Kel asks him.</p><p>Dr. Bradshaw laughs. \u201cNo. He died again a few minutes later. But I had already made up my mind by then,\u201d he says.</p><p>Kel laughs. \u201cWell, at least you didn\u2019t want to be a veterinarian.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, clearly I\u2019m not cut out for animals.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAny news?\u201d I walk into the room and hand Kel his coffee. Dr. Bradshaw stands up.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve still got her under anesthesia. We were able to run some tests. I\u2019m still waiting on the results, but you can see her for a few minutes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow? We can see her? Right now?\u201d I\u2019m gathering up my things as I reply.</p><p>\u201cWill...I can\u2019t let anyone else in,\u201d he says. He looks down at Kel, then back at me. \u201cShe still hasn\u2019t been moved from recovery yet...I\u2019m not even supposed to let you in. But I\u2019m doing some rounds and thought I\u2019d let you walk with me.\u201d</p><p>I look at Kel. I want to beg Dr. Bradshaw to let me take Kel with us, but I know he\u2019s already doing me a huge favor. \u201cKel, if I\u2019m not back before you leave with Sherry, I\u2019ll call you.\u201d</p><p>He nods. I expect him to argue about not getting to go with me, but I think he understands. The fact that he\u2019s being so reasonable fills me with a sense of pride. I bend over and hug him and kiss him on top of the head. \u201cI\u2019ll call you. As soon as I hear anything, I\u2019ll call you.\u201d He nods again. I reach over and grab something from my satchel, then turn back toward the door.</p><p>I follow Dr. Bradshaw past the nurse\u2019s station, through the doors and down the hall to the double doors that lead to the surgery area. Before we go any further, he takes me into a room where we both wash our hands. When we get to her door, I can barely catch my breath. I\u2019m so nervous. My heart is about to explode through my chest.</p><p>\u201cWill...you need to know a few things first. She\u2019s on a ventilator to help her breathe, but only because we\u2019ve got her in a medically-induced coma. There\u2019s no chance of her waking up right now with the amount of medicine we\u2019re giving her. Most of her head is bandaged. She looks worse than she feels...we\u2019re keeping her comfortable. I\u2019ll allow you a few minutes with her, but that\u2019s all I can give you right now. Understand?\u201d</p><p>I nod.</p><p>He pushes open the door and lets me in.</p><p>As soon as I see her, I struggle to breathe. It\u2019s like all of the air is knocked from my lungs when the reality of the moment hits me. The ventilator sucks in a rush of air and releases it again. With each repetitive sound of the machine, it\u2019s like my hope is being pushed out of me.</p><p>I walk to her bed and take her hand. It\u2019s cold. I kiss her forehead. I kiss it a million times. I just want to lay down with her, hug her. There are too many wires and tubes and cords running everywhere. I pull the chair up next to the bed and interlock her fingers with mine. It's getting hard to see her through my tears, so I have to wipe my eyes on my shirt. She looks so peaceful...like she's just taking a nap.</p><p>\u201cI love you, Lake,\u201d I whisper. I kiss her hand.</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d I whisper again.</p><p>\u201cI love you.\u201d</p><p>The covers are pulled tightly around her and she's got a hospital gown on. Her head is wrapped in a bandage but most of her hair is hanging down around her neck. I'm relieved they didn't cut all of her hair. She'd be pissed. The ventilator tube is taped over her mouth, so all I can do is kiss her cheek. I know she can\u2019t hear me, but I talk to her anyway.</p><p>\u201cLake, you have to pull through this. You have to.\u201d I stroke her hand. \u201cI can\u2019t live without you.\u201d I turn her hand over and kiss her palm, then press it against my cheek. The feel of her skin against mine is surreal. For a moment, I wasn\u2019t sure if I\u2019d ever feel it again. I close my eyes and I kiss her palm again and again. I sit there and cry and kiss the only parts of her I can over and over.</p><p>\u201cWill,\u201d Dr. Bradshaw says. \u201cWe need to go now.\u201d</p><p>I stand up and kiss her on the forehead. I take a step back, then take a step forward again and kiss her hand. I take two steps back, then walk two steps toward her again and kiss her cheek. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Dr. Bradshaw takes my arm. \u201cWill, we need to go.\u201d</p><p>I turn around and take a few steps toward the door. \u201cWait,\u201d I say. I put my hand in my pocket. I pull out her purple hair clip and walk back to her bed. I open her hand and place it in her palm and close her fingers over it, then kiss her on the forehead again before we leave.</p><p>The rest of the morning drags by. Kel left with Sherry. Eddie was discharged. She wanted to stay with me but Gavin and Joel wouldn\u2019t let her. All I can do now is wait. Wait and think. Think and wait. That\u2019s all I can do. That\u2019s all I do.</p><p>I wander the halls for a while. I can\u2019t keep sitting in that waiting room. I\u2019ve spent way too much of my life in there....and in this hospital. I was here for six solid days after my parent\u2019s died when I stayed with Caulder. I don\u2019t remember much from those six days. We were both in a daze, not really believing what was happening. Caulder hit his head in the wreck and broke his arm. I\u2019m not sure his injuries were near extensive enough to warrant six days in the hospital, but the staff seemed like they didn\u2019t feel comfortable just letting us go. Two orphans, into the wild.</p> <p>Caulder was only seven at the time so the hardest part was all the questions he had. I couldn\u2019t get it through to him that we weren\u2019t going to see them again. I think that six day hospital stay is why I hate pity so much. Every single person that spoke to me felt sorry for me, and I could see it in their eyes. I could hear it in their voices.</p><p>I was here with Lake for two months off and on when Julia was sick. When Kel and Caulder would stay at my grandparents, Lake and I would stay here with Julia. Lake stayed most nights, in fact. When Kel wasn\u2019t with me, he was here with them. By the end of Julia\u2019s first week here, Lake and I ended up bringing a blow-up mattress. Hospital furniture is the worst. They asked us to remove the mattress from the room a few times. Instead, we would just deflate it every morning and then blow it up again every night. We noticed they weren\u2019t so quick to ask us to remove it when we were asleep on it.</p><p>Out of all the nights I\u2019ve spent here, there\u2019s something different about it this time. Something worse. Maybe it\u2019s the absence of finality...the lack of knowledge. At least after my parent\u2019s had died and Caulder was here, I didn\u2019t question anything. I knew they were dead. I knew Caulder was going to be okay. Even with Julia we knew her death was inevitable. We weren\u2019t left with questions while we waited...we knew what was happening. But this time...this time is much harder. It\u2019s so hard not knowing.</p><p>As soon as I begin to doze off, Dr. Bradshaw walks in. I sit up in my chair, but he takes a seat next to me so I don\u2019t stand.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve moved her to a room in ICU. You\u2019ll be able to visit her in an hour during visiting hours. The scans look good. We\u2019ll try easing her off the anesthesia over time and see what happens. It\u2019s still touch and go, Will. Anything can happen at this point. Getting her to respond to us is our priority now.\u201d</p> <p>I can feel the relief wash over me, but a new sense of worry creeps in just as fast. \u201cDoes...\u201d It feels like my throat is squeezed shut when I try to speak. I grab my bottle of water off the table in front of me and take a drink, then try again to speak. \u201cDoes she have a chance? At recovery?\u201d</p><p>He sighs. \u201cI can\u2019t answer that. The brain is the most delicate organ in the body. Right now the scans show normal activity, but that may not mean anything when it comes to trying to wake her up. Then again, it could mean she\u2019ll be perfectly fine. Until that moment, we won\u2019t know.\u201d He stands up. \u201cShe\u2019s in room five in ICU. Wait until one o\u2019clock before you head down there.\u201d</p><p>I nod. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>As soon as I hear him round the corner, I grab my things and run as fast as I can in the opposite direction to ICU. The nurse doesn't ask any questions when I walk in. I act like I know exactly what I\u2019m doing and head straight to room five.</p><p>There aren't as many wires this time. She's still hooked up to the ventilator and she's got an I.V. in her left wrist. I walk around to the right side of her bed and pull the rail down. I climb into the bed with her and wrap my arm around her and lay my leg over her legs. I take her hand in mine and I close my eyes...</p><p>\"Will,\" Sherry says. I jerk my eyes open and she's standing on the other side of Lake's bed.</p> <p>I stretch my arms out above my head. \"Hey,\" I whisper.</p><p>\"I brought you some clothes. And your vase. Kel was still asleep, so I just let him sleep. I hope that's okay. I'll bring him back later when he wakes up.\"</p><p>\"Yeah, that's fine. What time is it?\"</p><p>She looks at her watch. \"Almost five,\" she says. \"The nurse said you've been asleep for a couple of hours.\"</p><p>I push my elbow into the bed and lift myself up. My arm is asleep. I slide off the bed and stand up and stretch again.</p><p>\"You do realize visitors are only allowed fifteen minutes,\" she says. \"They must like you.\"</p><p>I laugh. \"I'd like to see them try to kick me out,\" I say. I walk over to the chair and sit. The worst thing about hospitals is the furniture. The beds are too small for two people. The chairs are too hard for any people. And there\u2019s never a recliner. If they would just have a recliner, I might not detest it so much.</p><p>\"Have you eaten anything today?\" she asks.</p> <p>I shake my head.</p><p>\"Come downstairs with me. I'll buy you something to eat.\"</p><p>\"I can\u2019t. I don't want to leave her,\" I say. \"They've been reducing her meds. She could wake up.\"</p><p>\"Well, you need to eat. I'll grab you something and bring it back up.\"</p><p>\"Thanks,\" I say.</p><p>\"You should at least take a shower. You've got dried blood all over you. It's gross.\" She smiles at me and starts to head out the door.</p><p>\"Sherry. Don't bring me a hamburger, okay?\"</p><p>She laughs.</p><p>After she\u2019s gone, I stand up and walk to the vase. I take out a star and crawl back in the bed with Lake. \"This one's for you, Babe.\" I unfold the star and read it.</p><p>\"Never, under any circumstances, take a sleeping pill and a laxative on the same night.\"</p><p>I roll my eyes. \"Jesus, Julia! Now's not the time to be funny!\" I reach over and grab another star, then lay back down again.</p><p>\"Let's try this again, Babe.\"</p><p>\"Strength does not come from physical capacity. It comes from an indomitable will.\"</p><p>~Mahatma Gandhi</p><p>I lean over and whisper in her ear. \"You hear that, Lake? Indomitable will. That's one of the things I love about you.\"</p><p>I must have fallen asleep again. The nurse shakes me awake. \"Sir, can you step outside for a moment?\"</p><p>\"Is everything okay?\" I stand up just when Dr. Bradshaw walks into the room. \u201cIs she okay?\u201d I ask him.</p><p>\"We're removing the ventilator now. The anesthesia is wearing off so she's not getting anything other than the pain medicine she's getting through her I.V.\" He walks over to the bed and raises the rail back up. \"Just step outside for a few minutes. I promise we'll let you back in,\" he smiles.</p><p>He's smiling. This is good. They're taking her off the ventilator. This is good. He's looking me in the eyes. This is good. I step outside and impatiently wait.</p><p>I pace the hallway for fifteen minutes before he emerges from the room. \"Her vitals look fine. She's breathing on her own. Now we wait,\" he says. He pats me on the shoulder and turns to leave.</p><p>I go back in the room and crawl back in the bed with her. I put my ear to her mouth and listen to her breathe. It's the most beautiful sound in the world. I kiss her. Of course I kiss her. I kiss her a million times.</p><p>Sherry made me take a shower when she got back with our food. Gavin and Eddie showed up around six o'clock and stayed for an hour. Eddie cried the whole time so Gavin got worried and made her leave again. Sherry came back with Kel before visiting hours were over. He didn't cry, but I think he was upset seeing her like this, so they didn't stay long. I've been giving my grandmother hourly updates, although nothing has changed.</p><p>Now it\u2019s somewhere around midnight and I'm just sitting here. Waiting. Thinking. Waiting and thinking. I keep imagining I see her toe move. Or her finger. It's driving me crazy so I just stop watching. I start thinking about everything that happened Thursday night. Our cars. Where are our cars? I should probably be calling the insurance company. What about school? I missed school today. Or was it yesterday? I don\u2019t even know if it\u2019s Saturday yet. I probably won't be in school next week, either. I should figure out who Lake's professors are and let them know she won't be there. I should probably let my professors know, too. And the elementary. What do I tell them? I don't know when the boys will go back. If Lake is still in the hospital next week, I know Kel won't want to go to school. But he just missed an entire week of school. He can't miss very many more days. And what about Caulder? Where are Kel and Caulder going to stay while Lake and I are here? I'm not leaving this hospital without Lake. I may not even leave with Lake if I don't figure out what to do about a car. My car. Where is my car?</p><p>\"Will.\"</p><p>I glance to the door. No one's there. Now I'm hearing things. Too many thoughts are jumbled up in my head right now. I wonder if Sherry left me any of her medicine? I bet she did. She probably snuck it in my bag.</p><p>\"Will.\"</p><p>I jerk up in my seat and look at Lake. Her eyes are closed. She isn't moving. I know I heard my name. I know I did! I rush to her and touch her face. \"Lake?\"</p><p>She flinches. She flinches! \"Lake!\"</p><p>Her lips part and she says it again. \"Will?\"</p><p>She squints her eyes. She's trying to open them. I flick the light switch off, then pull the string to the overhead light until it turns off. I know how much these fluorescent lights hurt.</p><p>\"Lake,\" I whisper. I pull the rail down and climb back into the bed with her. I kiss her lips. I kiss her forehead. \"Don't try to talk if it hurts. You're okay. I'm right here. You're okay.\" She moves her hand so I take it in mine. \"Can you feel my hand?\"</p><p>She nods her head. It's not much of a nod, but it's a nod.</p><p>\"You're okay,\" I say. I keep saying it over and over until I'm crying. \"You're okay.\"</p><p>The door to her room opens and a nurse walks in.</p><p>\u201cShe said my name!\u201d</p><p>She looks up at me, then rushes back out of the room to get Dr. Bradshaw.</p><p>\"Get up, Will,\u201d he says when he walks into the room. \u201cLet us run some tests. We'll let you back in soon.\"</p><p>\"She said my name,\" I say as I slide off the bed. \"She said my name!\"</p><p>He smiles at me. \"Go outside.\"</p><p>And so I do. For over half an hour. No one has left the room and no one has entered and it's been half a freakin' hour. I knock on the door and the nurse cracks it open. I try to peek past her but she doesn't open the door far enough. \"Just a few more minutes,\" she says.</p><p>I contemplate calling everyone but I don't. I just need to make sure I wasn't hearing things, but I know she heard me. She spoke to me. She moved.</p><p>Dr. Bradshaw opens the door and steps outside. The nurses follow him out the door. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\"I heard her, right?

He has no idea just how calm I'm being!</p><p>\"She's responding,\" he says. \"Her physical responses were all good. She doesn't remember what happened. She may not remember a lot of stuff right away. She needs rest, Will. I'll let you back inside, but you'll need to let her rest.\"</p> <p>\"Okay, I will. I promise. I swear.\"</p><p>\"I know. Now go,\" he says.</p><p>When I open the door, she's facing me. She smiles a really pathetic, painful-looking smile.</p><p>\"Hey,\" I whisper. I walk to her bed and stroke her cheek.</p><p>\"Hey,\" she whispers back.</p> <p>\"Hey.\"</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d she says again.</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d</p><p>\"Stop it,\" she says. She tries to laugh but it hurts her. She closes her eyes.</p><p>I pull down the rail and crawl back into the bed with her. I take her hand in mine and I bury my face in the crevice between her shoulder and her neck...and I cry.</p><p>For the next few hours she goes in and out of consciousness, just like Dr. Bradshaw said she would. Every time she wakes up she says my name. Every time she says my name I tell her to close her eyes and get some rest. Every time I tell her to close her eyes and get some rest, she does.</p> <p>Dr. Bradshaw comes in a few times to check on her. They lower the dose in the I.V. one more time so she can stay awake for longer periods. I decide not to call anyone yet. It\u2019s still too early and I don\u2019t want everyone bombarding her right now. I just want her to rest.</p><p>It\u2019s almost seven in the morning and I\u2019m walking out of the bathroom when she finally says something besides my name.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d she says.</p><p>I pull a chair up beside her bed. She\u2019s rolled over onto her left side so I rest my chin on the bedrail and stroke her arm as I face her. \u201cWe had a wreck.\u201d</p><p>She looks confused, then a look of terror washes over her. \u201cThe kids...\u201d</p><p>\u201cEveryone\u2019s fine,\u201d I reassure her. \u201cEveryone\u2019s okay.\u201d</p><p>She breathes a sigh of relief. \u201cWhen? What day was it? What day is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Saturday. It happened Thursday night. What\u2019s the last thing you remember?\u201d</p> <p>She closes her eyes. I reach up and pull the string to the light above her bed and it flicks off. I don\u2019t know why they keep turning it on. What hospital patient wants a fluorescent light three feet from their head?</p><p>\u201cI remember going to the slam, she says. \u201cI remember your poem...but that\u2019s all.. That\u2019s all I can remember.\u201d She opens her eyes again and looks at me. \u201cDid I forgive you?\u201d</p><p>I laugh. \u201cYes, you forgave me. And you love me. A bunch.\u201d</p><p>She smiles. \u201cGood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were hurt, Babe. They had to take you into surgery.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. The doctor told me that much.\u201d</p><p>I stroke her cheek with the back of my hand. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you everything that happened later, okay? Right now you need to rest. I\u2019m going outside to call everyone. Kel\u2019s worried sick. Eddie, too. I\u2019ll be back, okay?\u201d</p><p>She nods and closes her eyes again. I lean forward and kiss her on the forehead. \u201cI love you, Lake.\u201d I grab my phone off the table and stand up.</p><p>\u201cAgain,\u201d she whispers.</p><p>\u201cI love you.\u201d</p><p>Visiting hours are strictly enforced once everyone starts to arrive. They make me wait in the waiting room just like everyone else. Only one person is allowed in at a time. Eddie and Gavin got here first, so Eddie\u2019s with her right now. Kel shows up with Sherry about the same time my grandparent\u2019s show up with Caulder.</p><p>\u201cCan I go see her?\u201d Kel asks.</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely. She keeps asking for you. Eddie\u2019s with her right now. It\u2019s ICU so she can only have visitors for fifteen minutes but you're next.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo she\u2019s talking? She\u2019s okay? She remembers me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. She\u2019s perfect,\u201d I say.</p><p>Grandpaul walks over to Kel and puts his hand on his shoulder. \"Come on Grandkel, we'll get you some breakfast before you go see her.\"</p><p>My grandparent\u2019s take Kel and Caulder to the cafeteria. I tell them to bring me something back...I finally have an appetite now.</p><p>\u201cDo you need me and Eddie to stay at your house with the boys for a few days?\u201d Gavin asks.</p><p>\u201cNo. Not right now, anyway. My grandparents are keeping them for a couple of days. I don\u2019t want them to miss a lot of school, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey can stay with me,\u201d Sherry says. \u201cI\u2019m sending Kiersten back to school on Wednesday. If your grandparents have them home Tuesday they can stay with me until they discharge Layken.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, guys,\u201d I say to both of them.</p><p>Eddie walks around the corner. She\u2019s wiping at her eyes and sniffing. I sit up in my chair and Gavin stands up and grabs Eddie's arm and guides her to a seat. She looks up at him and rolls her eyes. \"Gavin, I'm four months pregnant...quit treating me like I'm an invalid.\"</p><p>Once she\u2019s seated, Gavin takes the seat next to her. \"I\u2019m sorry, Babe. I just worry about you.\" He leans forward and kisses her stomach. \"Both of you.\"</p><p>Eddie smiles and kisses him on the cheek.</p><p>It's good to see he's accepted his new role as a Dad. I know they've got a lot of hurdles ahead of them, but I have faith that they'll make it. I guess Lake and I could start recycling all the stars we open for them, just in case they need them.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s Lake feeling?\u201d I ask.</p><p>Eddie shrugs. \u201cLike shit,\u201d she says. \u201cBut she did just have her head cut open, so that\u2019s understandable. I told her all about the wreck. She felt kind of bad once she found out she was the one driving. I told her it wasn\u2019t her fault, but she still said she wishes you were driving. That way she could blame her injuries on you.\u201d</p><p>I laugh. \u201cShe can blame them on me anyway if it makes her feel better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re coming back this afternoon,\u201d Eddie says as she stands up and grabs Gavin\u2019s hand. \u201cShe really needs some TLC in the makeup department. Is two o\u2019clock okay? Does anyone have that time slot yet?\u201d</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cSee you guys at two.\u201d</p><p>Before they leave, Eddie walks over and gives me a hug. An unusually long hug.</p><p>After her and Gavin walk out, I look down at my watch. Kel will see her next, then Sherry. My grandmother may want to go see her. I guess I\u2019ll have to wait until after lunch before they\u2019ll let me back in.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got great friends,\u201d Sherry says.</p><p>I raise my eyebrows at her. \u201cYou don\u2019t think they\u2019re weird? Most people think my friends are weird.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I do. That\u2019s why they\u2019re great,\u201d she says.</p><p>I smile and scoot down in my seat until my head is resting against the back of the chair and I close my eyes. \u201cYou\u2019re pretty weird yourself, Sherry.\u201d</p><p>She laughs. \u201cYou, too.\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t get comfortable in the chair, so I resort to lying in the floor again. I stretch my arms out above my head and sigh. The floor is actually starting to feel comfortable. Now that I know Lake\u2019s okay, I\u2019m starting not to despise this hospital as much.</p><p>\u201cWill?\u201d Sherry says.</p><p>I open my eyes and look at her. She\u2019s not looking at me, though. She\u2019s got her legs crossed in the chair and she\u2019s picking at the seam of her jeans.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d I reply.</p><p>She looks at me and smiles. \u201cYou did a great job,\u201d she says quietly. \u201cI know it was hard calling me about Kiersten. And taking care of the boys during all of this. How you\u2019ve handled everything with Layken. You\u2019re too young to have so much responsibility, but you\u2019re doing a good job. I hope you know that. Your mom and dad would be proud.\u201d</p><p>I close my eyes and inhale. I didn\u2019t know how much I needed to hear that until this very second. Sometimes it feels good to have your biggest fears discounted with a simple compliment. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>She gets out of the chair and lies down next to me in the floor. I look over at her and her eyes are closed, but it looks like she\u2019s trying not to cry. I look away and don\u2019t draw attention to it. Sometimes women just need to cry.</p><p>We\u2019re quiet for a little while. She blows out a deep breath, like she's trying to choke back tears. \u201cHe was killed a year later. A year after he proposed. In a car wreck,\u201d she says.</p><p>I realize she\u2019s telling me the story about Jim. I roll over and face her, resting my head on my elbow. I don't really know what to say, so I don't say anything.</p><p>\u201cI'm okay,\u201d she says. She looks at me and smiles. This time it seems like she's trying not to pity herself. \u201cIt\u2019s been a long time. I love my family and wouldn\u2019t trade them for the world. But sometimes it\u2019s still hard. Times like these...\u201d</p><p>She pulls herself up and sits Indian style in the floor. She begins to pick at the seam of her pants again. \u201cI was so scared for you, Will. I was scared she wouldn\u2019t make it. Seeing you go through that was hard for me and it brought back a lot of memories. That\u2019s why I haven\u2019t been up here very much.\u201d</p><p>I understand the expression in her eyes, and the heartache in her voice. I understand it, and I hate it for her. \u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d I say. \u201cI didn\u2019t expect you to stay. You had Kiersten to worry about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you didn't expect me to stay. I wouldn't have even been any help. But I worry about you. I worry about all of you. Kel, Caulder, you, Layken. Now I even like your damn weird friends and I\u2019m gonna have to worry about them, too,\u201d she laughs.</p><p>I smile at her. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to be worried about, Sherry. Thank you.\u201d</p><p>Sunday, January 29th, 2012.</p><p>I\u2019ve learned something about my heart.</p><p>It can break.</p><p>It can be ripped apart.</p><p>It can harden and freeze.</p><p>It can stop. Completely.</p><p>It can shatter into a million pieces.</p><p>It can explode.</p><p>It can die.</p><p>The only thing that made it start beating again?</p><p>The moment you opened your eyes.</p><p>Chapter Sixteen</p><p>All the visits wear Lake out and she sleeps the majority of the afternoon. She slept through Eddie's second visit, which is probably good for Lake's sake. The nurse brought her soup at dinnertime and she sipped most of it. It was the first thing she ate since Thursday.</p><p>She asked more questions about everything that happened the night of the wreck. She mostly wanted to know all about her forgiving me and us making up. I told her everything that happened after I performed. For the most part I was honest, but I may have thrown in a more climactic make-out scene for added emphasis.</p><p>It\u2019s Sunday and the fact that she\u2019s in the hospital doesn\u2019t deter her from her routine. I walk into her hospital room and set the bags of movies and junk food down in the chair. Lake is sitting up on the side of the bed and the nurse is working with the IV.</p><p>\u201cOh, good. You\u2019re right in time,\u201d the nurse says. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t want a sponge bath, she wants a standard bath. I was about to assist her in the bathroom, but if you\u2019d rather do it you can.\u201d She unhooks the IV and clamps it, then tapes the end of it to Lake\u2019s hand. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Lake and I look at each other. It's not like I've never seen her naked...just not for prolonged periods of time. And with the lights on.</p><p>\u201cI....I don\u2019t know,\u201d I mutter. \u201cDo you want me to help you?\u201d I ask Lake.</p><p>Lake shrugs her shoulders. \"It wouldn't be the first time you've put me in a shower. Although, I hope you help me take my clothes off this time.\" She laughs at her own joke. She regrets the laugh as soon as she does it, though. Her hand goes up to her head and she winces.</p><p>The nurse can sense the slight awkwardness between us. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I thought you guys were married. It said on her chart that you were her husband.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah...about that,\u201d I say. \u201cNot quite yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d the nurse says. \u201cIf you\u2019ll just go back to the waiting room I\u2019ll let you know when we\u2019re finished.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Lake says. \u201cHe\u2019ll help me.\u201d Lake looks up at me. \u201cYou\u2019ll help me.\" The nurse looks up at me and I nod. She takes a few items off the tray next to Lake\u2019s bed and walks out of the room.</p><p>\u201cHave you walked any more today?\u201d I take her arm and help lift her off the bed.</p><p>She nods. \u201cYeah. They had me walk down the hall between visits again. I feel better than yesterday, just dizzy.\u201d</p> <p>The nurse walks back into the room with a towel. \u201cJust don\u2019t let her get her head wet. There\u2019s a handheld shower head in the shower or she can use the bathtub. The tub may be better for her so she can lay down.\u201d The nurse leaves the towel in the chair and walks back out.</p><p>Lake slowly stands up and I assist her into the bathroom. Once we\u2019re inside, I close the door behind us.</p><p>\u201cThis is so embarrassing,\u201d she says.</p><p>\u201cLake, you asked me to stay. If you want, I\u2019ll go back and get the nurse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I just mean because I need to pee.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Here.\u201d I walk around her and grab her other arm as she backs up. She grabs hold of the metal bar attached to the wall and pauses.</p> <p>\u201cTurn around,\u201d she says.</p><p>I turn around and face the opposite direction. \"Babe, if you\u2019re already making me look away it\u2019ll be kind of hard for me to help you in the shower. You aren\u2019t even naked yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s different. I just don\u2019t want you to watch me pee.\u201d</p><p>I laugh. And I wait. And I wait some more. Nothing happens.</p><p>\u201cMaybe you need to leave for a minute,\u201d she says.</p><p>I shake my head and walk out of the bathroom. \u201cDon\u2019t try to stand up without me.\u201d I leave the door open a few inches so I can hear her if she needs me. When she\u2019s finished, I walk back into the bathroom and help her stand up.</p><p>\u201cShower or bath?\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cBath. I don\u2019t think I can stand up long enough for a shower.\u201d</p> <p>I make sure she\u2019s holding onto the bar before I let go of her arm. I adjust the faucet on the bathtub until the water turns warm. I grab the washcloth and get it wet, then set it on the side of the tub. It\u2019s a larger tub with two steps leading up to it to make it easier to walk down into. When I stand up, I take Lake\u2019s arm again and lead her to the bathtub. I stand behind her and brush her hair over her shoulder and untie the top of her gown. When it drapes open, I have to suppress a gasp. She\u2019s got bruises all over her back. There\u2019s one more tie on her gown, so I pull the string until the gown separates.</p><p>She slides the gown forward and down her arms. I run my fingers under the stream of water to check the temperature, then reach for her arm and help her up the steps and into the bathtub. Once she\u2019s seated, she pulls her knees up to her chest and wraps her arms around them, then rests her head on them.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she says. \u201cFor not trying to put the moves on me just now.\u201d</p><p>I smile at her. \u201cDon\u2019t thank me yet. We just got started.\u201d I dip the washcloth in the water and kneel down beside the bathtub. The steps come out pretty far, so it\u2019s hard to reach her without hovering over her. She takes the washcloth out of my hand and begins washing her arm.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s weird how much energy everything takes. It feels like my arms weigh a hundred pounds.\u201d</p><p>I open the bar of soap and hand it to her, but it slips out of her grasp. She feels around in the water until she finds it, then she rubs it in the washcloth.</p><p>\u201cDo you know how long before they let me go home?\u201d she asks.</p><p>\u201cHopefully by Wednesday. He said recovery can take anywhere from a few days to two weeks depending on how the injury heals. You seem to be doing pretty well.\u201d</p><p>She frowns. \u201cI don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m doing well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re doing great,\u201d I say.</p><p>She smiles and sets the washcloth back on the side of the tub and wraps her arms around her knees again. \u201cI have to rest,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019ll get to the other arm in a minute.\u201d</p><p>She closes her eyes. She looks so tired. I reach over and turn the water off, then stand up and take off my shoes and my shirt, but leave my pants on. \u201cScoot up,\u201d I say to her.</p><p>She scoots up and I step into the bathtub and slide down into the water behind her. I put my legs on either side of her and gently lay her back onto my chest. I grab the washcloth and run it up the arm she was too tired to get to.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re crazy,\u201d she says quietly.</p><p>I kiss her on top of the head. \u201cSo are you.\u201d</p><p>We\u2019re both silent as I wash her. She rests against my chest until I tell her to lean forward so I can get her back. When she leans forward, I put more soap on the washcloth and gently touch it to her skin. It\u2019s bruised up so bad I\u2019m afraid I\u2019ll hurt her.</p><p>\u201cYou really got banged up. Does your back hurt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverything hurts.\u201d</p><p>I wash her skin as softly as I can. I don\u2019t want to make it worse. When I\u2019ve covered every inch, I lean forward and kiss her on the back, right on top of her bruise. I kiss her other bruise, and her other bruise, and her other bruise. I kiss every spot of her back that\u2019s hurt. When she leans back against my chest, I lift her arm and kiss the bruises on her arm, too. Then I do the same to the other arm. When I\u2019ve kissed all the bruises I can find, I lay her arm back down in the water. \u201cThere. Good as new,\u201d I say. I wrap my arms around her and kiss her cheek. She closes her eyes and we just sit there for a while.</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t how I pictured our first bath together,\u201d she says.</p><p>I laugh. \u201cReally? \u2018Cause this is exactly how I pictured it. Pants and all.\u201d</p><p>She takes a deep breath and exhales, then leans her head back against my chest and looks me in the eyes. \u201cI love you, Will.\u201d</p><p>I kiss her on the forehead. \u201cSay it again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you, Will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne more time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you.\u201d</p><p>Lake is finally discharged today after five days in the hospital. Luckily since yesterday was a Monday I was able to finalize reports with the insurance companies. Lake\u2019s Jeep was totaled. The damage to my car wasn\u2019t as bad so I was given a rental until it\u2019s repaired.</p><p>Dr. Bradshaw is really pleased with Lake's progress. She has to go back to see him again in two weeks. In the meantime, he's put her on bed rest. She\u2019s excited because she knows that means she gets to sleep in my comfortable bed every night. I\u2019m excited because that means I get to spend two solid weeks with her at my house.</p><p>I end up withdrawing her from all of her classes for the semester. She was upset, but she doesn\u2019t need the added stress of school right now. I told her she just needs to focus on getting well. I\u2019m taking the rest of the week off but plan on going back to school Monday depending on how she\u2019s feeling. For now, though...we\u2019ve got almost a whole week of nothing to do but watch movies and eat junk food.</p><p>Kel and Caulder bring their plates to the coffee table in the living room and set them down next to mine. Lake\u2019s lying down on the couch so we eat in the living room rather than at the table.</p><p>\u201cSuck and sweet time,\u201d Caulder says. He crosses his legs and scoots around to the opposite side of the coffee table so we\u2019re all sitting in a somewhat circle that includes Lake. \u201cMy suck is that I have to go back to school tomorrow,\u201d he says. \u201cMy sweet is that Layken\u2019s finally home.\u201d</p><p>She smiles. \u201cAwe, thanks Caulder. That is a sweet,\u201d she says.</p><p>\u201cMy turn,\u201d Kel says. \u201cMy suck is that I have to go back to school tomorrow. My sweet is that Layken\u2019s finally home.\u201d</p><p>She scrunches her nose up at Kel. \u201cCopycat.\u201d</p><p>I laugh. \u201cWell, my suck today is that my girlfriend made me rent six different Johnny Depp movies. My sweet is right now.\u201d I lean over and kiss her on the forehead. Kel and Caulder have no objection to my sweet tonight. I guess they\u2019re getting used to it.</p><p>\u201cWell, my suck is obvious. I\u2019ve got staples in my head,\u201d Lake says. She looks at me and smiles, then her eyes drift to Kel and Caulder as she watches them eat.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your sweet?\u201d Caulder says with a mouthful of food.</p><p>Lake stares at him for a moment. \u201cYou guys,\u201d she says. \u201cAll three of you.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s quiet for a minute, then Kel picks up a french fry and throws it at her. \u201cQuit being cheesy,\u201d he says.</p><p>Lake grabs the french fry and throws it back at him.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d Kiersten says as she walks through the door. \u201cSorry I\u2019m late.\u201d She heads to the kitchen and starts making herself a plate of food. She\u2019s about to be pissed again because I didn\u2019t know she was coming over. Looks like she\u2019ll have to eat bread again.</p><p>\"You need some help?\" I ask her. She's only got one good arm, but she seems to be adjusting pretty well.</p><p>\"Nope. I got it.\" She brings her plate into the living room and sits down in the floor. We all stare at her when she takes a huge bite of a chicken strip.</p><p>\u201cOh my god it\u2019s so gooood,\u201d she says. She shoves the rest of it in her mouth.</p><p>\u201cKiersten, that\u2019s meat. You\u2019re eating meat,\u201d I say.</p><p>She nods. \u201cI know. It\u2019s the weirdest thing. I\u2019ve been dying to come over here since you guys got home so I could try some.\u201d She takes another bite. \u201cIt\u2019s heaven,\u201d she says with a mouthful. She hops up and walks to the kitchen. \u201cIs it good in ketchup?\u201d She grabs the ketchup and brings it back to the living room and squirts some on her plate.</p><p>\u201cWhy the sudden change of heart?\u201d Lake asks her.</p><p>She finishes chewing and swallows her food. \u201cRight when we were about to be hit by that truck....all I could think about was how I was about to die and I\u2019ve never tasted meat before. That was my only regret in life.\u201d</p><p>We all laugh. She grabs the chicken off of my plate and throws it on her own.</p><p>\u201cWill, are you still coming to dad day Thursday?\u201d Caulder asks.</p><p>Lake looks at me. \u201cDad day?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, Caulder. I don\u2019t know if I feel comfortable leaving Lake alone yet,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cDad day? What\u2019s dad day?\u201d Lake asks again. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s father appreciation day at our school,\u201d Kiersten says. \u201cThey\u2019re having a luncheon. Kids get to eat lunch with their dad\u2019s in the gymnasium. Mom day isn\u2019t until next month.\"</p><p>\u201cBut what about the kids who don\u2019t have dads? What are they supposed to do? That\u2019s not very fair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe kids that don\u2019t have dads just go with Will,\u201d Kel says.</p><p>Lake looks at me again. She doesn\u2019t like being out of the loop.</p> <p>\u201cI asked Kel if I could eat with him, too,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cWill you eat with me, too?\u201d Kiersten asks. \u201cMy dad won\u2019t be back until Saturday.\u201d</p><p>I nod. \u201cIf I go,\u201d I say. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I need to go, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo,\u201d Lake says. \u201cI\u2019ll be fine. You need to quit babying me so much.\u201d</p><p>I lean forward and kiss her. \u201cBut you are my baby,\u201d I say.</p> <p>I\u2019m not sure which direction it comes from, maybe all three, but I\u2019m hit in the head with french fries.</p><p>I help Lake into the bed and pull the covers over her. \u201cYou want something to drink?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d she says.</p><p>I turn off the light and walk around to the other side of the bed and crawl in. I scoot closer to her and put my head on her pillow and wrap my arm around her. Her bandages come off at her next doctor\u2019s visit. She\u2019s so worried about how much hair they had to cut. I keep telling her not to worry about it. I\u2019m sure they didn\u2019t cut much, and the incision is on the back of her head so it won\u2019t be that noticeable.</p><p>It hurts if she\u2019s not lying on her side, so she\u2019s facing me. Her lips are in close proximity to mine, so of course I have to kiss them. I lay my head back down on her pillow and brush her hair behind her ear with my fingers.</p><p>This entire past week has been hell. Mentally and physically. But especially mentally. I came so close to losing her. So close. Sometimes when it\u2019s quiet, my mind wanders to the possibility of having lost her, and what I would have done. I have to keep reeling myself back in. I keep having to remind myself that she\u2019s okay. That everyone\u2019s okay.</p> <p>I didn\u2019t think it was possible, but everything Lake and I have been through this entire past month has somehow made me love her even more. I can\u2019t even begin to imagine my life without her in it. I think back to the video Sherry showed me, and to what Jim said to her.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s like you came along and woke up my soul.\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s exactly what Lake did to me. She woke up my soul.</p><p>I lean in and kiss her again; longer this time. But not too long, I just feel like she\u2019s so fragile.</p><p>\u201cThis sucks,\u201d she says. \u201cDo you realize how hard it\u2019ll be sleeping in the same bed with you? Are you sure he specified an entire month? We have to retreat for a whole month?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, technically he said four weeks,\u201d I say, stroking her arm with my hand. \u201cI guess we could stick to four weeks since it\u2019s a few days shy of a whole month.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee? You should have taken me up on the offer when you had the chance. Now we have to wait four more weeks!\" she says. \"How many weeks is that total?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be sixty-five,\u201d I quickly respond. \u201cNot that I\u2019m counting. And four weeks from today is February 28th. Not that I\u2019m counting that, either.\u201d</p> <p>She laughs. \u201cFebruary 28th? But that\u2019ll be a Tuesday. Who wants to lose their virginity on a Tuesday? Let\u2019s make it the Friday before. February 24th. We\u2019ll get Kel and Caulder to stay with your grandparent\u2019s again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope. Four weeks. Doctors\u2019 orders,\u201d I say. \u201cWe\u2019ll make a deal. I\u2019ll get my grandparent\u2019s to watch the boys again if we can make it to March 2nd. The Friday after it\u2019s been four weeks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMarch 2nd is a Thursday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a leap year.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUgh! Fine. March 2nd,\u201d she says. \u201cBut I want a suite this time. A big one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou got it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith chocolates. And flowers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou got it,\u201d I say. I lift my head off of her pillow and kiss her, then roll over.</p><p>\"And a fruit tray. With strawberries.\"</p><p>\"You got it,\" I say again. I yawn and pull the covers up over my head.</p><p>\"And I want one of those fluffy hotel robes. Both of us. That way we can wear them all weekend.\"</p><p>\"Whatever you want, Lake. Now go to sleep. You need to rest.\"</p><p>She's done nothing but sleep for five days, so I\u2019m not surprised she's wide awake. I, on the other hand, have had close to zero sleep for five days. I could barely keep my eyes open today. It feels so good to be back home, back in my bed. It especially feels good that Lake's right next to me.</p><p>\u201cWill?\u201d she whispers.</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have to pee.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure you\u2019ll be okay?\u201d I ask her for the tenth time this morning.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be fine,\u201d she says. She holds the phone up to show me she has it close by.</p><p>\u201cOkay. Sherry\u2019s at home if you need her. I\u2019ll be back in an hour, the luncheon shouldn\u2019t last that long.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBabe, I\u2019m fine. Promise.\u201d</p><p>I kiss her on the forehead. \u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>And I do know she\u2019s fine. She\u2019s more than fine. She\u2019s been so focused and determined to get better that she\u2019s doing way too much on her own now. Even things she shouldn\u2019t be doing on her own, which is why I worry. Her indomitable will that I fell in love with sometimes irritates the hell out of me, too.</p><p>When I walk into the gymnasium, I scan the area looking for the boys. Caulder is waving when I see him, so I walk to his table.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Kel and Kiersten?\u201d I say as I take my seat.</p><p>\u201cMrs. Brill wouldn\u2019t let them come,\u201d he says.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d I jerk my head around looking for Mrs. Brill.</p><p>\u201cShe said they were just using this lunch as an excuse to get out of study hall. She made them go to regular lunch at 10:45. Kel told her you\u2019d be mad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, Kel\u2019s right,\u201d I say. \u201cI\u2019ll be right back.\u201d</p><p>I walk out of the gymnasium and turn left to head to the cafeteria. When I walk inside, the noise penetrates my eardrums. I forgot how loud kids were. I also forgot how much my head still hurt. I glance at all the tables but there are so many kids, I can\u2019t spot either of them. I walk over to a lady who looks like she\u2019s monitoring the cafeteria.</p><p>\u201cCan you tell me where Kel Cohen is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s too loud, I didn\u2019t hear you.\u201d</p><p>I say it louder. \u201cKel Cohen!\u201d</p><p>She nods and points to a table at the other end of the cafeteria. Before I reach the table, Kel spots me and waves. Kiersten is seated next to him, wiping at her shirt with a wad of wet napkins. They both stand up when I reach the table.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened to your shirt?\u201d I ask Kiersten.</p><p>She looks at Kel and shakes her head. \u201cStupid boys,\u201d she says. She points to the table across from theirs. I turn and look and there are three boys that look a little older than her and Kel. They\u2019re all laughing.</p><p>\u201cDid they do something to you?\u201d I ask her.</p><p>She rolls her eyes. \u201cWhen do they not? If it\u2019s not chocolate milk, it\u2019s apple sauce. Or pudding. Or Jell-O.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, it\u2019s usually Jell-O,\u201d Kel says.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it, Will. I\u2019m used to it now. I always keep an extra change of clothes in my backpack just in case.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it?\u201d I ask. \u201cWhy the hell isn\u2019t something being done about it? Have you talked to a teacher?\u201d</p><p>She nods. \u201cThey never see it when it happens. It\u2019s gotten worse since the suspension. Now they just make sure they only throw things at me when the monitor\u2019s aren\u2019t looking. But it\u2019s fine, Will. Really. I have Abby and Kel and Caulder. That\u2019s all the friends I need.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m pissed. I can\u2019t believe she has to go through this every day! I look at Kel. \u201cWhich one\u2019s the one Caulder was telling me about? The dickhead?\u201d Kel points at the boy seated at the head of the table.</p><p>\u201cYou guys wait here.\u201d I turn around and walk toward Dickhead\u2019s table. As I get closer to them, their laughter succumbs to looks of confusion. I grab one of the empty chairs at their table and slide it out, then pull it around next to Dickhead and straddle the chair backwards, facing him.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d I say. He just looks at me confused, then looks at his friends.</p><p>\u201cCan I help you?\u201d he says sarcastically. His friends laugh.</p><p>\u201cYes. Actually you can,\u201d I say. \u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d</p><p>He laughs again. I can tell he\u2019s trying to play the part of the big, bad twelve-year-old that he is. He reminds me of Reece at that age. He can\u2019t hide the nervousness on his face, though.</p><p>\u201cMark,\u201d he says.</p><p>\u201cWell hi, Mark. I\u2019m Will.\u201d I extend my hand and he reluctantly shakes it.</p><p>\u201cNow that we\u2019ve been formally introduced, I think it\u2019s safe to say that we can be frank with one another. Can we do that, Mark? Are you tough enough to take a little bit of honesty?\u201d</p><p>He laughs a nervous laugh. \u201cYeah, I\u2019m tough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. Because you see that girl over there?\u201d I point back to Kiersten. Mark glances over my shoulder at her, then looks back at me and nods.</p><p>\u201cLet me be frank with you. That girl is very important to me. Very important. When bad things happen to important people in my life, I don\u2019t take it very well. I guess you could say I have a bit of a temper.\u201d I scoot my chair closer to his and look him straight in the eyes. \u201cNow, while we\u2019re being frank with one another...you should know that I used to be a teacher. You know why I\u2019m not a teacher anymore, Mark?\u201d</p><p>He isn\u2019t smiling anymore. He shakes his head.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t teach anymore because one of my dickhead students decided to mess with one of my important people. It didn\u2019t end well.\u201d</p><p>All three of the boys are staring at me, wide-eyed.</p><p>\u201cYou can take that as a threat if you want to, Mark. But honestly, I have no intentions of hurting you. After all, you\u2019re only twelve. When it comes to kicking someone\u2019s ass, I usually draw the line at fourteen-year-olds. But I will tell you this...the fact that you bully people? And girls, for that matter? Girls younger than you?\u201d I shake my head in disgust.</p><p>\u201cIt only goes to show what a pathetic human being you\u2019ll turn out to be. But that\u2019s not the worst of it,\u201d I say. I turn and look at his friends. \u201cThe worst of it is the people that follow you. Because anyone weak enough to let someone as pathetic as you be their leader is even worse than pathetic.\u201d</p><p>I look back at Mark and smile. \u201cIt was nice meeting you, Mark.\u201d I stand up and swing the chair back around until it\u2019s back in its place under the table, then I place my hands on the table in front of him. \u201cI\u2019ll be keeping in touch.\u201d</p><p>I look all three of them in the eyes as I back away from their table, then turn back to Kiersten and Kel. \u201cLet\u2019s go. Caulder\u2019s waiting on us.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>When the three of us get back to the gymnasium, we go to Caulder\u2019s table and take a seat. We aren\u2019t seated for two minutes when Mrs. Brill marches up with a scowl on her face. Right before she opens her mouth to say something, I stand up and reach my hand out to her. \u201cMrs. Brill,\u201d I say with a smile. \u201cIt\u2019s so good of you for letting Kiersten and the boys eat with me today. It really means a lot that you recognize the fact that there are families in this world with non-traditional situations. I love these kids like they\u2019re my own. The fact that you respect our relationship even though I\u2019m not a typical father really says a lot about your character. So I just wanted to say thank you.\u201d</p><p>Mrs. Brill lets go of my hand and steps back. She eyes Kiersten and Kel, then looks back at me. \u201cYou\u2019re welcome,\u201d she says. \u201cHope you all enjoy the luncheon.\u201d She turns and walks away without another word.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d Kel says. \u201cThat was definitely my sweet.\u201d</p><p>Thursday, February 16th, 2012</p> <p>One more day...</p><p>Chapter Seventeen</p><p>\u201cSo what\u2019s the damage?\u201d Lake asks Dr. Bradshaw.</p><p>\u201cTo what? You?\u201d He laughs as he slowly unwraps the bandage from around her head.</p><p>\u201cTo my hair,\u201d she says. \u201cHow much did you chop off?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell,\u201d he says. \u201cWe did have to cut through your skull, you know. We tried to save as much hair as we could, but we were faced with a pretty tough decision...it was either your hair or your life.\u201d</p><p>She laughs. \u201cWell I guess I\u2019ll forgive you, then.\u201d</p><p>As soon as we get home from the doctor, she heads straight for the shower to wash her hair. She\u2019s been dying to wash her hair. I\u2019m pretty comfortable with leaving her home now, so I go pick up the boys. I forgot they were staying an hour after school, so I text Lake to let her know I\u2019ll be late. The school talent show is tomorrow night and the students who signed up to perform get to stay and practice. Kiersten and Caulder both signed up, but neither of them are giving us hints as to what they\u2019re doing. I\u2019ve given Kiersten copies of all my poems. She says she needed them for research. I didn\u2019t argue. There\u2019s just something about Kiersten you don\u2019t argue with.</p><p>When the boys and I finally get home, Lake is still in the bathroom. I know she\u2019s tired of me babying her, but I check on her anyway. The fact that she\u2019s been in there so long worries me. When I knock on the door, she tells me to go away. She doesn\u2019t sound happy, which just means I\u2019m not going away.</p><p>\u201cLake open the door,\u201d I say. I jiggle the door knob but it\u2019s locked.</p><p>\u201cWill, I just need a minute,\u201d she sniffs.</p> <p>She\u2019s crying.</p><p>\u201cLake. Open the door!\u201d I\u2019m really worried now. I know how stubborn she is and if she hurt herself she\u2019s probably trying to hide it. I beat on the door and shake the door knob again.</p><p>It\u2019s quiet. She doesn\u2019t respond. \u201cLake!\u201d I yell.</p><p>The door knob turns and the door slowly opens. She\u2019s staring down at the floor, crying. \u201cI\u2019m okay,\u201d she says. She wipes at her eyes with a wad of toilet paper. \u201cYou really need to quit freaking out, Will.\u201d</p><p>I step into the bathroom and hug her. \u201cWhy are you crying?\u201d</p><p>She pulls away from me and shakes her head, then sits down on the seat in front of the bathroom mirror. \u201cIt\u2019s stupid,\u201d she says.</p><p>\u201cAre you in pain? Does your head hurt?\u201d</p><p>She shakes her head and wipes at her eyes again. She brings her arm up and pulls the rubber band out of her hair and it falls down over her shoulder. \u201cIt\u2019s my hair.\u201d</p> <p>Her hair. She\u2019s crying about her damn hair! I breathe a sigh of relief. \u201cIt\u2019ll grow back, Lake. It\u2019s okay.\u201d I walk around behind her and pull her hair away from her shoulders to her back. She\u2019s got an area on the back of her head that\u2019s been shaved. It can\u2019t be covered up, because it\u2019s smack dab in the middle of her hair. I run my fingers over it. \u201cI think you would look cute with short hair. Wait \u2018till it grows out some more and you can get it cut.\u201d</p><p>She shakes her head. \u201cThat\u2019ll take forever. I\u2019m not going anywhere like this. I\u2019m not leaving this house for another month,\u201d she says.</p><p>I know she doesn\u2019t mean it, but I still hate that she\u2019s so upset. \u201cI think it\u2019s beautiful,\u201d I say, running my fingers over her scar. \u201cIt\u2019s what saved your life.\u201d I reach around her and open the cabinet doors underneath the sink.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing? You aren\u2019t cutting the rest of my hair off, Will.\u201d</p><p>I reach inside and pull out the black box that contains my hair trimmers. \u201cI\u2019m not cutting your hair,\u201d I say. I plug in the cord and take off the guard and turn it on. I reach behind my head and press it against the back of my hair and make a quick swipe. When I bring it back around, I pull the pieces of my hair out and toss them in the trashcan.</p><p>\u201cThere. Now we match,\u201d I say.</p><p>She swings around in her seat. \u201cWill! What the hell? Why\u2019d you just do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just hair, Babe.\u201d I smile at her.</p><p>She brings her wad of toilet paper back up to her eyes and turns back around, looking at our reflection in the mirror. She shakes her head and laughs.</p><p>\u201cYou look ridiculous,\u201d she says.</p><p>\u201cSo do you.\u201d</p><p>Other than going to the doctor yesterday, tonight is Lake\u2019s first time out of the house. After the talent show, Sherry is watching the boys for a few hours so we can have a date. Of course, Lake got upset when I told her about our date. \u201cYou never ask me, you always tell me,\u201d she whined. So of course I had to get down on my knee and ask her out. And of course, I\u2019m keeping her in the dark again. She has no clue what I have planned for tonight. No clue.</p><p>Eddie and Gavin are already inside with Sherry and David when we arrive. I let Lake sit next to Eddie and I take the seat next to Sherry. Lake was able to pull her hair back into a ponytail and hide most of her scar. I\u2019m not so lucky.</p><p>\u201cUmmm...Will? Is this some sort of new trend I\u2019m not aware of?\u201d Sherry asks when she sees my hair.</p><p>Lake laughs. \u201cSee? You look ridiculous.\u201d</p><p>Sherry leans into me and whispers. \u201cCan you give me a hint as to what Kiersten\u2019s doing tonight?\u201d</p><p>I shrug. \u201cI don\u2019t know what she\u2019s doing. I\u2019m assuming it\u2019s a poem. She didn\u2019t read it to you guys?\u201d</p><p>Sherry and David both shake their heads. \u201cShe\u2019s been pretty secretive about it,\u201d David says.</p><p>\u201cSo has Caulder,\u201d I say. \u201cAnd I have no idea what he\u2019s up to. I don\u2019t even think he has a talent.\u201d</p><p>The curtain opens and Principal Brill walks up to the microphone and does her introductions to kick off the evening. With every child that performs, there\u2019s a different parent holding a video camera at the front of the audience. Why didn\u2019t I bring my camera? I\u2019m an idiot. A real parent would have brought a camera. Right when Kiersten is finally called to the stage, Lake reaches inside her purse and pulls out a camera. Of course she does.</p><p>Principal Brill introduces Kiersten, then walks off the stage. Kiersten doesn\u2019t look nervous at all. She really is a miniature version of Eddie. There\u2019s a small sack draped over her wrist with the cast. She lifts her good arm to lower the microphone.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m doing something tonight called a slam. It\u2019s a type of poetry that I was introduced to this year by a friend of mine. Thank you, Will.\u201d</p><p>I smile.</p><p>Kiersten takes a deep breath and says, \u201cMy poem tonight is called \u2018Butterfly you.\u2019\u201d</p><p>Lake and I both look at each other. I know she\u2019s thinking the same thing I\u2019m thinking, which is, \u201cOh, no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cButterfly.</p><p>What a beautiful word</p><p>What a delicate creature.</p><p>Delicate like the cruel words that flow right out of your mouths</p><p>and the food that flies right out of your hands...</p><p>Does it make you feel better?</p><p>Does it make you feel good ?</p><p>Does picking on a girl make you more of a man?</p><p>Well, I\u2019m standing up for myself</p><p>Like I should have done before</p><p>I\u2019m not putting up with your</p><p>Butterfly anymore.\u201d</p><p>(Kiersten slides the sack off her wrist and opens it, pulling out a handful of hand-made butterflies. She takes the microphone out of the stand and begins walking down the stairs as she continues speaking.)</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to extend to others what others have extended to me.\u201d</p><p>(She walks up to Mrs. Brill first and holds out a butterfly)</p><p>\u201cButterfly you, Mrs. Brill.\u201d</p><p>(Mrs. Brill smiles at her and takes the butterfly out of her hands. Lake laughs out loud and I have to nudge her to get her to be quiet. Kiersten walks around the room, passing out butterflies to several of the students, including the three from the lunchroom.)</p><p>\u201cButterfly you, Mark.</p><p>Butterfly you, Brendan.</p><p>Butterfly you, Colby.\u201d</p><p>(When she finishes passing out the butterflies, she walks back onto the stage and places the microphone back into the stand.)</p><p>\u201cI have one thing to say to you</p><p>And I\u2019m not referring to the bullies</p><p>Or the ones they pursue.</p><p>I\u2019m referring to those of you that just stand by</p><p>The ones who don\u2019t take up for those of us that cry</p><p>Those of you who just...turn a blind eye.</p><p>After all it\u2019s not you it\u2019s happening to</p><p>You aren\u2019t the one being bullied</p><p>And you aren\u2019t the one being rude</p><p>It isn\u2019t your hand that\u2019s throwing the food</p><p>But...it is your mouth not speaking up</p><p>It is your feet not taking a stand</p><p>It is your arm not lending a hand</p><p>It is your heart</p><p>Not giving a damn.</p><p>So take up for yourself</p><p>Take up for your friends</p><p>I challenge you to be someone</p><p>Who doesn\u2019t give in.</p><p>Don\u2019t give in.</p><p>Don\u2019t let them win.\u201d</p><p>As soon as \u2018damn\u2019 comes out of Kiersten\u2019s mouth, Mrs. Brill is marching onto the stage. Luckily, Kiersten finishes her poem and rushes off the stage before Mrs. Brill reaches her. The audience is in shock. Well, most of the audience. Everyone on our row is giving her a standing ovation.</p><p>As Mrs. Brill announces the next performance and we take our seats, Sherry whispers to me, \u201cI didn\u2019t get the whole \u2018butterfly\u2019 thing, but the rest of it was so good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah it was,\u201d I agree. \u201cIt was butterflying excellent.\u201d</p><p>Caulder is called onto the stage next. He looks nervous. I\u2019m nervous for him. Lake\u2019s nervous, too. I wish I knew what he was doing so I could have given him some advice before he got up there. Lake zooms the camera in and focuses it on Caulder. I take a deep breath, hoping he can get through it without cussing. Mrs. Brill already has her eye on us. Caulder walks to the microphone and introduces his talent.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Caulder. I\u2019m also doing a slam tonight. It\u2019s called \u2018Suck and sweet.\u2019\u201d</p><p>Oh no, here we go again.</p><p>I\u2019ve had a lot of sucks in life</p><p>A lot</p><p>My parents died almost four years ago, right after I turned seven </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>With every day that goes by I remember them less and less</p><p>Like my mom...I remember that she used to sing.</p><p>She was always happy,</p><p>always dancing.</p> <p>Other than what I\u2019ve seen of her in pictures, I don\u2019t really remember what she looks like.</p><p>Or what she smells like</p><p>Or what she sounds like</p><p>And my Dad</p><p>I remember more things about him, but only because I thought he was the most amazing man in the world.</p> <p>He was smart.

The kids are excited to be spending the evening with Sherry and David, so they were all in a hurry to leave. Kiersten and Caulder didn\u2019t seem to care who won, which made me a little proud. After all, I\u2019ve been drilling Allan Wolf\u2019s quote into Kiersten\u2019s head every time I give her advice about poetry. \u201cThe points are not the point; the point is poetry.\u201d</p><p>After David and Sherry drive away with the boys, Lake and I walk to the car and I open the door for her.</p><p>\u201cWhere are we eating? I\u2019m hungry,\u201d she says.</p><p>I don\u2019t answer her. I shut her door and walk around to the driver\u2019s side. I reach into the backseat and grab two sacks out of the floorboard and hand one to her. \u201cWe don\u2019t have time to stop and eat. I made us grilled cheese.\u201d</p><p>She grins when she opens her sack and pulls out her sandwich and soda. I can tell by the look on her face that she remembers. I was hoping she would remember.</p><p>\u201cWe have a pretty long drive,\u201d I say. \u201cI know a game we can play, it\u2019s called \u2018would you rather.\u2019 Have you ever played it before?\u201d</p><p>She smiles at me and nods. \u201cJust once, with this really hot guy. But it was a long time ago. Maybe you should go first to refresh my memory.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. But first, there\u2019s something I need to do.\u201d I open my console and pull out the blindfold. \u201cOur destination is sort of a surprise, so I need you to put this on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re blindfolding me? Seriously?\u201d She rolls her eyes and leans forward.</p><p>I wrap it around her head and adjust it over her eyes. \u201cThere. Don\u2019t peek.\u201d I put the car in drive and pull out of the parking lot, then ask the first question. \u201cOkay. Would you rather I looked like Hugh Jackman or George Clooney?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJohnny Depp,\u201d she says.</p><p>She answers a little too fast for my comfort. \u201cWhat the hell, Lake? You\u2019re supposed to say Will! You\u2019re supposed to say you want me to look like me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you weren\u2019t one of the options,\u201d she says.</p><p>\u201cNeither was Johnny Depp!\u201d</p><p>She laughs. \u201cMy turn. Would you rather have constant, uncontrollable belching or would you rather have to bark every time you heard the word the?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBark as in like a dog?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUncontrollable belching,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cOh gross.\" She wrinkles up her nose. \"I could live with your barking, but I don\u2019t know about the constant belching.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell in that case, I change my answer. My turn again. Would you rather be abducted by aliens or have to go on tour with Nickelback?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d rather be abducted by The Avett Brothers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWasn't an option.\"</p><p>She laughs. \u201cFine, aliens. Would you rather be an old, rich man with only one year left to live? Or a young, poor, sad man with fifty years left to live?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d rather be Johnny Depp.\u201d</p><p>She laughs. \u201cYou suck at this,\u201d she teases.</p><p>I reach over and interlock fingers with her. She\u2019s leaning back into the seat laughing without a clue in the world where we\u2019re headed. She\u2019s about to be pissed...but hopefully only for a little while. I drive around a bit longer while we continue our game. I could honestly play this game all night with her, but I don\u2019t. We eventually pull up to our destination and I hop out of the car. I open her door and help her stand up.</p><p>\u201cHold my hands. I\u2019ll lead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou're making me nervous, Will. Why do you always have to be so secretive when it comes to our dates?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not secretive, I just love surprising you. A little bit further and I\u2019ll let you take off your blindfold.\u201d We walk inside and I position her exactly where I want her. I can\u2019t help but smile, knowing how she's about to react once I take off her blindfold. \u201cI\u2019m about to take it off, but before I do...just remember how much you love me, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t make any promises,\u201d she says.</p><p>I reach behind her and untie the blindfold and remove it from her eyes. She opens them and looks around. Yep, she\u2019s pissed.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell, Will! You brought me on a date to your house again? Why do you always do this?\u201d</p><p>I laugh. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d I throw the blindfold on the coffee table and put my arms around her. \u201cIt's just that some things don't need to be done on a stage. Some things need to be private. This is one of them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is one of them?\u201d She looks nervous.</p><p>I kiss her on the forehead. \u201cSit down, I\u2019ll be right back.\u201d I motion for her to sit on the couch, so she does.</p><p>I go to my bedroom and reach into the closet and pull out her surprise. I stick it in my pocket and walk back to the living room. I turn on the stereo and set I &amp; Love &amp; You on repeat; it\u2019s her favorite song.</p><p>\u201cYou better tell me now, before I start crying again...does this have anything to do with my mom? Because you said the stars were the last thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey were the last thing, I promise.\u201d I sit down beside her on the couch and take her hand in mine, looking her straight in the eyes. \u201cLake, I have something to say and I want you to hear me out without interrupting me, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not the one that interrupts,\u201d she says, defensively.</p><p>\u201cSee? Right there. Don\u2019t do that.\u201d</p><p>She laughs. \u201cFine. Talk.\u201d</p><p>I start to say what I need to say, but something just doesn't feel right. I don't like how we're so formally seated. It's not us. I grab her leg and arm and pull her onto my lap. She straddles me, wrapping her legs around my back. She hangs her hands loosely around my neck and looks me in the eyes. I start to speak again, but I\u2019m cut off.</p><p>\"Will?\"</p><p>\"You're interrupting me, Lake.\"</p><p>She gives me a half smile and brings her hands to my face. \"I love you,\" she says. \"Thank you for taking such good care of me.\"</p><p>She's sidetracking me, but it's nice. I slowly slide my hands up her arms and rest them on her shoulders. \"You would do the same for me, Lake. It's what we do.\"</p><p>She smiles. A tear makes its way down her cheek, and she doesn't even try to hold it back. \"Yep,\" she says. \"It's what we do.\"</p><p>I take her hands in mine and bring her palms to my lips and kiss them. \u201cLake, you mean the world to me. You brought so much to my life...right when I needed it the most. I wish you could know how hopeless I was before I met you, so you would realize just how much you've changed me.\"</p><p>\"I do know, Will. I was hopeless too.\"</p><p>\"You're interrupting again.\"</p><p>She grins and shakes her head. \"I don't care.\"</p><p>I laugh and push her down onto the couch and climb on top of her. I press my hands into the couch beside her head to hold myself up. \"Do you have any idea how much you frustrate me sometimes?\"</p><p>\"Is that a rhetorical question? Because you just told me to stop interrupting you, so I'm not sure if you want me to answer it.\"</p><p>\u201cOh my god, you\u2019re impossible, Lake. I can\u2019t even get two sentences out!\u201d</p><p>She laughs and grabs the collar of my shirt. \"I'm listening,\" she whispers. \"Promise.\"</p><p>I start to believe her, but as soon as I begin to speak again she crushes her lips to mine. For a moment, I forget what my whole point to tonight is. I'm suddenly consumed by the taste of her mouth and the feel of her hands making their way up my back. I lower my body onto hers and let her sidetrack me some more. After several minutes of intense sidetracking, I'm somehow able to tear myself away from her grasp and sit back up on the couch.</p><p>\"Dammit, Lake. Are you gonna let me do this or not?\u201d I take her hands and pull her up to a sitting position, then I get off the couch and kneel down on the floor in front of her.</p><p>Until this moment, I don't think she had any clue what tonight was about. She looks at me with a mixture of emotions in her expression. Fear, hope, excitement, apprehension. I'm sharing those exact same emotions with her. I take her hands in mine and take a deep breath.</p><p>\"I told you the stars were the last gift from your mother, and technically they were.\"</p><p>\"Wait, technically?\" she says. She realizes she's interrupting me again when I glare at her. \"Oh yeah, sorry.\" She puts her finger to her mouth, indicating she isn't going to say anything else.</p><p>\"Yes, technically. I said the stars were the last thing she gave us, and they were. But she gave me one star that isn't in the vase. She wanted me to give it to you when I was ready. When you were ready. So...I hope you're ready.\"</p><p>I put my hand in my pocket and pull out the star. I slowly unfold the paper and when I do, the ring slides out and into my hand. When she sees her mother's wedding ring, her hands go up to her mouth and she sucks in a deep breath.</p><p>\"I know we\u2019re young, Lake. We've got an entire lifetime ahead of us to do things like get married. But sometimes things in people's lives don\u2019t happen in chronological order like they should. Especially in our lives. Our chronological order got mixed up a long time ago.\"</p><p>I take her hand in mine. She holds out her finger and her hands are shaking...but so are mine. I slide the ring onto her finger. It's a perfect fit. She wipes my tears away with her free hand and kisses me on the forehead. Her lips come a little too close to mine, so I have to pause what I'm saying and kiss them. She puts her hand on the back of my head and closes her lips over mine as she slides off the couch and into my lap. I lose my balance and we fall back. She doesn't let go of my head, and our lips never separate while she continues to give me the absolute best kiss she\u2019s ever given me. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\"I love you, Will,\" she mutters into my mouth. \"I love you, I love you, I love you.\"</p><p>I gently pull her face away from mine. \"I'm not finished yet,\" I laugh. \"Stop butterflying interrupting me!\" I roll her over onto her back and prop myself up on my elbow beside her.</p><p>She starts kicking her legs up and down in a fit. \"Hurry up and ask me already, I'm dying here!\"</p><p>I shake my head and laugh. \"That's just it, Lake. I'm not asking you to marry me...\"</p> <p>Before I can even get the rest of my sentence out, a look of horror washes across her face. I immediately put my finger to her lips and shush her before she interrupts me again.</p><p>\"I know how you liked to be asked and not told. But I'm not asking you to marry me.\" I roll on top of her and lean in as close as I can while still looking her in the eyes. I lower my voice to a whisper. \"I'm telling you to marry me, Lake...because I can't live without you.\"</p><p>She starts crying again...and laughing. She's laughing and crying and kissing me, all at the same time. We both are.</p><p>\"I was so wrong,\" she says between kisses. \"Sometimes a girl loves to be told.\"</p><p>\"Are you knocked up?\" Eddie asks Lake.</p> <p>\"No, Eddie. That would be you.\"</p><p>We're all sitting in the living room. Lake couldn't wait to tell Eddie so she called her immediately to tell her the news. Eddie and Gavin were here within an hour.</p><p>\"Don't get me wrong, I'm super excited for you. I just don't get it. Why so sudden? March 2nd is only two weeks away.\"</p><p>Lake looks at me and winks. She's snuggled up next to me, sitting on her feet. I lean in and kiss her lips. Like I said, I can't help it.</p><p>Lake turns back to Eddie and answers her. \"Why would I want a traditional wedding, Eddie? Nothing about our lives is traditional. None of our parents would be there. You and Gavin would be our only guests. Will's grandparents probably wouldn't even show up...his grandmother hates me.\"</p><p>\"Oh, I forgot to tell you,\" I say. \"My grandmother actually likes you. A lot. It's me she wasn't really happy with.\"</p> <p>\"Really?\" Lake says. \"How do you know?\"</p><p>\"She told me.\"</p><p>\"Huh.\" She smiles. \"That's nice to know.\"</p><p>\"See?\" Eddie says. \"They'll show up. So will Sherry and David. That's nine people right there.\"</p><p>Lake rolls her eyes at Eddie. \"Nine people? You expect us to pay for an entire wedding for nine people?\"</p><p>Eddie sighs and falls onto Gavin\u2019s lap in a defeated slump. \"I guess you're right. It's just that I was looking forward to planning a big wedding someday.\u201d</p><p>\"Well, you can still plan your own,\" she says. Lake looks at Gavin. \"How many more minutes until you propose, Gavin?\"</p><p>Gavin doesn't skip a beat. \"About three hundred thousand or so.\"</p> <p>\"See, Eddie? Besides, I still need you to do my hair and makeup,\u201d Lake says. \"We need witnesses, too. You and Gavin can come and Kel and Caulder will be there.\"</p><p>Eddie smiles. She finally seems a little more excited once she finds out she\u2019s invited.</p><p>I was hesitant at first with Lake's plan, too. But after hearing her logic...and especially after hearing how much money it would save us not having a wedding, I was easily convinced. The date of the marriage was a given.</p><p>\"What about the houses? Which one will you guys live in?\" Gavin says.</p><p>Lake looks at me and nods. We've been talking about it for two weeks now, even before the proposal tonight. After having her stay here, we both knew it would be impossible to live in separate houses again. We came up with the plan about a week ago, but tonight seems like the perfect night to share it.</p><p>\"That's one of the reasons we wanted you guys to come over,\" I say. \"I had about three years left on my mortgage and no less than two weeks after Julia passed away, the title came in the mail. She paid it off before she died. She paid the rent on Lake's house through September, that's when her lease is up. So now we'll have an empty house with six months of pre-paid rent. We know you guys are looking for a place before the baby comes...so we're offering you Lake's. Until September, anyway...then you'll have to sign your own lease.\"</p><p>Neither one of them says anything. They just look at us in shock. Gavin shakes his head and starts to protest. Eddie slaps her hand over his mouth and turns to me. \"We'll take it! We'll take it, we'll take it, we'll take it!\" She starts clapping and jumps up and hugs Lake, then hugs me. \"Oh my god you guys are the best friends ever! Aren't they Gavin?\"</p><p>He smiles, not really wanting to appear desperate, but I know how much they need a place of their own. Eddie's excitement eventually outweighs Gavin\u2019s modesty and he can no longer contain himself. He hugs Lake, then hugs me, then hugs Eddie, then hugs me again. When they finally calm down and sit back down on the couch, Gavin's smile fades.</p><p>\u201cDo you know what this means?\" he says to Eddie. \u201cKirsten's about to be our parallel neighbor.\"</p><p>Friday, March 2nd, 2012.</p><p>It\u2019s worth all the aches,</p><p>All the tears,</p><p>the mistakes...</p><p>The heart of a man and a woman in love?</p><p>It\u2019s worth all of the pain in the world.</p><p>Chapter Eighteen</p><p>I\u2019ve spent the last two weeks giving her every opportunity to opt out of doing things this way. Lake insists she doesn\u2019t want a traditional wedding, but I don\u2019t want her to regret her decision someday. Most girls spend years planning out how they want their wedding to be. But then again, Lake\u2019s not most girls.</p><p>I take a deep breath, not really understanding why I'm so jittery. I'm sort of glad it's so informal. I couldn't imagine how shot my nerves would be if we had more of an audience. My hands won't stop sweating, so I wipe them on my jeans. She insisted I wear jeans, said she didn\u2019t want to see me in a tux. I\u2019m not sure what dress she picked out for today, but she didn\u2019t want to wear a wedding dress. She didn\u2019t see the point in buying one if she was only wearing it once.</p><p>We aren\u2019t doing the traditional aisle walk, either. In fact, nothing about this is traditional. I\u2019m pretty sure her and Eddie are down the hall in the courthouse public restroom doing her makeup right now. It all seems so surreal...marrying the love of your life in the same building where you can register a car. But honestly, it wouldn\u2019t matter where we got married...I'd be just as excited...and just as nervous.</p><p>When the doors open, there isn\u2019t any music. No flower girls or ring bearers. Just Eddie. She walks in and takes a seat in one of the chairs next to Kel. The Judge walks in right after Eddie sits down and hands me another form to sign.</p><p>\u201cYou forgot to date this,\u201d he says.</p><p>He gives me a pen so I take the form and press it down on the podium in front of me and date it. March 2nd, 2012. That\u2019s our day. Mine and Lake\u2019s day. I hand the paper back to him and the door to the courtroom opens again. When I turn around, Lake\u2019s walking in, smiling. As soon as I lay eyes on her, a wave of relief washes over me. I'm immediately calm. She has that effect on me.</p><p>She looks beautiful. She\u2019s wearing blue jeans too. I laugh when I notice the shirt she has on. She\u2019s wearing that damn ugly shirt I love to hate. If I could have hand-picked myself what she would wear on our wedding day, it would be exactly this.</p><p>When she walks up to me, I wrap my arms around her, pick her up and spin her around. When I plant her feet back on the floor, she whispers in my ear.</p><p>\u201cTwo more hours.\u201d</p><p>She isn\u2019t referring to the marriage, she\u2019s referring to the honeymoon. I grab her face and kiss her. Everyone else in the room fades into the distance as we kiss...but only for a second.</p><p>\u201cEh-hem.\u201d I look up and the officiant is standing in front of us with an unamused look on his face. \u201cWe haven\u2019t quite gotten to the kissing of the bride yet,\u201d he says.</p><p>I laugh and take Lake\u2019s hand as we position ourselves in front of him. When he begins reading his wedding sermon, Lake touches her hand to my cheek and pulls my gaze toward hers, away from the officiant. I turn toward her and take her hands in mine and pull them up between us. I\u2019m pretty sure the officiant is still talking, and that I should probably be paying attention, but I can\u2019t think of anything else right now I'd rather be paying attention to. She smiles at me, and I can see she isn\u2019t paying attention to anything around us, either. It\u2019s just me and her right now. I know it isn\u2019t time yet, but I go ahead and kiss her anyway. I don\u2019t hear a single word of the wedding sermon as we continue to kiss. In less than a minute, this woman is about to become my wife. My life.</p><p>Lake laughs and says, \u201cI do\u201d without pulling away from my mouth. I didn\u2019t even realize we had gotten to that part yet. She closes her eyes again and gets right back into rhythm with me. I know weddings are pretty important to some people, but I have to fight back the urge to pick her up and carry her out of here before it\u2019s even over. After a few more seconds, she starts giggling again and says, \u201cHe does.\u201d</p><p>When I realize she just said my line, my lips separate from hers and I look over at the officiant. \u201cShe\u2019s right, I do.\u201d I turn back to her and resume where we left off.</p><p>\u201cWell, then, congratulations. I now pronounce you Husband and Wife. You may continue kissing your bride.\u201d</p><p>And so I do.</p><p>\u201cAfter you, Mrs. Cooper,\u201d I say as we exit the elevator.</p><p>She smiles. \u201cI like that. It has a nice ring to it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you think so because it\u2019s a little late to change your mind now.\u201d</p><p>When the elevator doors close behind us, I pull the room key out of my pocket and check the room number again. \u201cIt\u2019s this way,\u201d I say, pointing to the right. I take her hand in mine and begin walking down the hallway. I\u2019m forced to an abrupt stop, however, when her hand jerks me back.</p><p>\u201cWait,\u201d she says. \u201cYou\u2019re supposed to carry me over the threshold. That\u2019s what husbands do.\u201d</p><p>Before I can bend down and take her in my arms the traditional way, she puts her arms on my shoulders and jumps up, wrapping her legs around my waist. I have to grab hold of her thighs before she slips. Her lips are right in proximity to mine now, so they briefly get kissed. She grins and runs her hands through the back of my hair, forcing my mouth onto hers again. I try to grip her legs with one hand and her waist with the other, but it feels like she\u2019s slipping so I take two quick steps until she\u2019s propped up against a hotel room door. It\u2019s not our door, but it does the job. As soon as her back hits the door, she moans. I remember the bruises from a few weeks ago and think I may have just hurt her. I break apart from her with a concerned look on my face.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay? Did I just hurt your back?\u201d</p><p>She grins. \u201cNo. That was a good sound.\u201d</p><p>The intensity in her eyes is magnetic. I\u2019m unable to break our stare as I stand there, holding her up against the door. I grab the underneath of her thighs with my hands and hoist her up even higher, pressing my body against hers for more leverage. \u201cFive more minutes,\u201d I say.</p><p>I grin and lean in to kiss her again, but she\u2019s suddenly further away. As soon as I realize the hotel room door we\u2019re leaning against is opening up behind her, I do my best to catch her. Instead, I fall to the ground with her and we both end up in a heap on the floor of someone's hotel room. She still has her arms around my neck and she\u2019s laughing until she looks up and sees a man and two children staring down at us. He doesn\u2019t look very pleased. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cRun,\u201d I whisper. We both crawl out of the hotel room and pull ourselves up. I take her hand in mine and we run down the hallway until we find our room. I slide the key into the reader but before I open the door, she slips in front of me and faces me.</p><p>\u201cThree more minutes,\u201d she says. She reaches behind her and pulls down on the handle, swinging the door open. \u201cNow carry me over the threshold, Husband.\u201d</p><p>I bend down and grab her behind the knees and pick her up, throwing her over my shoulder. She squeals and I push the door open with her feet. I take a step and walk over the threshold with my wife.</p><p>The door slams behind us and I ease her down onto the bed.</p> <p>\u201cI smell chocolate. And flowers,\u201d she says. \u201cGood job, Husband.\u201d</p><p>I lift her leg up and slide her boot off. \u201cThank you, Wife.\" I lift her other leg up and slide that boot off, too. \"I also remembered the fruit. And the robes.\u201d</p><p>She winks at me and rolls over, scooting up onto the bed. When she gets settled, she leans forward and grabs my hand, pulling me toward her. \u201cCome here, Husband,\u201d she whispers.</p><p>I start to make my way up the bed, but pause when I come face to face with her shirt. \u201cI wish you\u2019d take this ugly thing off,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the one who hates it so much. You take it off.\u201d</p> <p>And so I do. I start from the bottom this time and press my lips against her skin where her stomach meets the top of her pants, causing her to squirm. She\u2019s ticklish there. Good to know. I unbutton the next button and slowly move my lips up another inch to her belly button. I kiss it. She lets out another moan, but it doesn\u2019t worry me this time. I continue kissing every inch of her until the ugly shirt is finally off and lying on the floor. When my lips find their way back to hers, I pause and look her in the eyes to ask her one last time.</p><p>\u201cWife? Are you sure you\u2019re ready to not call retreat? Right now?\u201d</p><p>She wraps her legs around me and pulls me closer. \u201cI\u2019m butterflying positive,\u201d she says.</p><p>And so we don\u2019t.</p><p>The End </p> </body></html>"]
