Dr. Emily Drake tapped a ballpoint pen against her lower lip as she listened to the vamp describe his little problem.</p><p>\u201cI just...can\u2019t drink it. I tried taking the blood straight from a source.\u201d He glanced over at her, his brown eyes wide. \u201cYa know, like from someone\u2019s neck.\u201d</p><p>Emily nodded. Yeah, she had a pretty good idea. She scribbled a quick note on her pad. Scared to take directly.</p> <p>\u201cBut the minute my teeth actually touch someone\u2019s skin\u2014\u201d He broke off, and a shudder worked the length of his too-thin body. \u201cI feel like I\u2019m gonna be sick.\u201d</p><p>Hmmm. Emily could only imagine how the guy\u2019s \u201csource\u201d had to feel. \u201cTell me, Marvin, have you tried going to a blood bank?\u201d In her experience, some vampires just couldn\u2019t take drinking warm blood from a human\u2019s veins. They needed the blood cold, ice cold, and bagged\u2014like some gruesome monster takeout.</p><p>He nodded and closed his eyes. \u201cBeen there, done that, Doctor. It just doesn\u2019t work for me.\u201d He exhaled heavily, and Emily had to fight to control the curve of her lips. Vampires didn\u2019t breathe, didn\u2019t need any air, didn\u2019t need anything but blood to live. But some habits were sure hard to break.</p><p>Even for the dead.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to die.\u201d A pause. His eyes opened, gazed at her office ceiling. \u201cAgain. \u201d His hands lifted in the air, began to gesture furiously as he announced, in a slightly shrill tone, \u201cI\u2019ve been a vampire for six days\u2014 six days! And I\u2019m going to starve to death.</p> <p>I\u2019ll be the first vampire in history to starve because he\u2019s afraid of blood! I\u2019m going to wither away, dwindle to nothing. There will be no bones left, no ashes. Just\u2014\u201d</p><p>Oh jeez, this guy was quite the drama queen. Emily leaned forward. Vamps were all alike. Always with the I\u2013I talk. You\u2019d think they were the only supernatural creatures who had any problems.</p><p>Not being able to drink blood was a pretty serious problem for a vampire. And that was why Marvin Scamps had come to see her.</p><p>She had a reputation for being able to help creatures like him.</p><p>Emily pulled off her glasses, rubbed the bridge of her nose as she thought a moment, then said, \u201cHave you tried mixing the blood with something else?\u201d</p><p>He shot off the couch, began to pace the room, his skeletal body tight, his hands knotted into fists. \u201cIt\u2019s blood! I can\u2019t drink blood! I can\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p> <p>Emily took a deep breath and lowered the shield she\u2019d erected in her mind. Slowly, carefully, she opened her thoughts up to the creature before her.</p><p>Blood. Horrible, red, sticky blood. Dripping down my throat. Gagging me. Oh, the taste. Weak, stale. I hate it, hate it\u2014</p><p>Oh yeah, the guy had a bad blood issue.</p><p>Emily probed deeper into Marvin\u2019s mind, pushing past the fear, the disgust. There had to be more to Marvin\u2019s phobia. There always was. If she could just find a memory to show her...</p><p>Emily\u2019s special gift in this world was her ability to touch the minds of others. She could peek inside their thoughts, feel the sting of their emotions, and that extrasensory ability made her the best damn psychologist in the state of Georgia. But, well, not everyone got to benefit from her little \u201cbonus\u201d power. Her gift only worked with supernatural beings\u2014the Other\u2014 and that was why Emily was known as the Monster Doctor.</p><p>Of course, that wasn\u2019t her technical title. Couldn\u2019t very well post that in gold lettering on her door.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t live this way!\u201d Marvin\u2019s voice was a full scream now. He stood in front of her window, gazing down at the street below.</p><p>His shaggy blond hair brushed against the windowpane.</p> <p>She refrained from pointing out that, technically, Marvin wasn\u2019t living. Damn. She wondered who\u2019d been the brilliant guy to transform him. Marvin really didn\u2019t seem to be cut out for being undead.</p><p>But it was her job to help him.</p><p>And she was very, very good at her job.</p><p>\u201cCome here, Marvin.\u201d She didn\u2019t like the way he was eyeing the street below. There was no way he\u2019d survive a jump from twenty-three stories. Only a level-nine demon or one very strong shifter could survive a fall like that.</p><p>His palms pressed against the glass. \u201cIf I can\u2019t drink the blood, I\u2019ll die.\u201d</p><p>Eventually. \u201cYou have a month,\u201d she told him, pitching her voice low, trying to soothe him. \u201cA vampire needs to feed only once every full moon.\u201d And when he\u2019d been transformed, he\u2019d taken blood then. That gave him about three weeks before his next feeding.</p><p>Emily opened her desk drawer and pulled out her Rolodex. She took out a gray business card and held it up. \u201cTake this.\u201d</p><p>Marvin glanced back at her, brows knitted suspiciously. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d He crept toward her, lifted his hand.</p><p>\u201cA name and a number.\u201d She handed him the card, met his gaze levelly. \u201cA very private name and number. There have been others like you, Marvin. Others who needed...help to feed.\u201d</p><p>He flinched.</p><p>\u201cWorst-case scenario\u2014you call that number when the hunger gets too much for you. Tell the guy who answers I referred you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWh-what will he do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll give you a transfusion.\u201d The alarm on her watch began to vibrate softly against her wrist.</p><p>Their session was over.</p><p>\u201cA transfusion?\u201d For the first time since he\u2019d walked into her office, hope lit his face. \u201cThe blood can be pumped into me, so I don\u2019t have to drink it?\u201d</p><p>Emily nodded. \u201cIf necessary.\u201d But that wasn\u2019t a permanent solution. \u201cMarvin, you\u2019re a vampire. It\u2019s your nature to drink blood.\u201d</p><p>He couldn\u2019t fight his basic nature forever. \u201cSooner or later, you\u2019ll have to feed.\u201d</p><p>He swallowed.</p><p>\u201cBut in the meantime, stop worrying so much.\u201d She tried a smile. \u201cYou\u2019ve got a backup plan now, so you know you aren\u2019t going to starve.\u201d</p><p>His lips lifted in a faint grin, showing the hint of his fangs. \u201cYeah, I do, don\u2019t I?\u201d His fingers curled over the card.</p><p>Her leather chair creaked softly as she pushed to her feet. \u201cYou and I are going to work through this.\u201d He just had to trust her enough to let her fully into his mind so that she could help him to fight his fear. \u201cI want you to come back next week, same time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA-all right.\u201d</p><p>Marvin grabbed his battered leather coat and headed for the door. \u201cThanks.\u201d He opened the door, heading into the empty lobby. It was after eleven P.M. and Emily\u2019s assistant, Vanessa, had left just as Marvin arrived for his appointment.</p><p>Marvin looked back over his shoulder and said, \u201cI\u2019ll see you next week.\u201d</p><p>She pushed her glasses back on her nose as she followed him into the lobby. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. Everything is going to be\u2014\u201d</p><p>A loud knock sounded on her office door.</p><p>Marvin jumped.</p><p>Emily frowned. She didn\u2019t have any other appointments scheduled for the night. No one else should have\u2014</p><p>A fist hammered against the wooden door. \u201cDr. Drake?\u201d A man\u2019s voice. Deep. Hard. Slightly annoyed. The doorknob rattled.</p><p>Good thing Vanessa always locked up when she left.</p><p>The vampire edged closer to her. \u201cDo you...know who that is?\u201d</p><p>No, she sure as hell didn\u2019t. But she was going to find out. Straightening her shoulders, Emily marched forward, flipped the lock\u2014</p><p>\u201cDr. Drake, I know you\u2019re in there!\u201d</p><p>\u2014opened the door, and found herself staring at a tall, dark stranger, a stranger with a badge clipped to the top of his faded jeans.</p><p>A cop.</p><p>Alarm bells rang in her head. Anytime a cop paid her a call this late, well, it was never good.</p><p>The cop blinked at her, blinked a pair of sky blue eyes, and lowered the hand he\u2019d raised to slam against her door.</p><p>Emily felt her stomach tighten as she stared up at him. A shiver of foreboding slid over her. This man, he was dangerous, very dangerous. Her psychic gift told her that, and every instinct she possessed as a woman screamed the same warning.</p><p>The cop was tanned a deep, dark gold. His hair was pitch black, a little too long. He had a hard, square jaw and a long blade of a nose. His cheekbones were high, glass sharp, giving him a slightly predatory look. His lips were thin and currently curved down in a frown of annoyance.</p><p>The cop was a big guy. Tall, well over six feet, with wide shoulders and thick muscles that stretched the black T-shirt he wore. He was also glowing faintly.</p><p>Shit.</p><p>She knew what that hazy, shining light around his body meant.</p><p>The cop wasn\u2019t human.</p><p>And there was only one kind of creature that carried a glow like a second skin.</p><p>The guy was a shifter.</p><p>Shit. Shit. Most people knew the legends about the shifters. Some folks called them Weres. They were creatures who could change their forms, shift into beasts.</p><p>Her empathic ability let her see their second form, allowed her to see the soft, shining glow of the beasts the shifters carried.</p><p>Sometimes those beasts took control. Shifters had been known to go mad, to attack, to kill\u2014</p><p>\u201cAre you Dr. Drake?\u201d His gaze darted over her shoulder to Marvin, narrowed.</p><p>\u201cAh, yes, yes, I am.\u201d Oh damn, but she didn\u2019t trust shifters. Never trust anything that was born with two faces...that was her motto.</p><p>What kind of shifter was the cop? She\u2019d met plenty of his kind in her time. Met shifters who could become panthers, snakes, even one who could become an owl. What was the cop?</p><p>Something fairly safe like an owl or a snake?</p><p>Or something dangerous...like a bear, a dragon, or God forbid, a wolf? The wolves were the worst. Uncontrollable, aggressive, with strong psychotic tendencies\u2014</p><p>The cop grunted, then said, \u201cI need you to come with me.\u201d He reached out his hand to her.</p><p>She stared at his hand, at the long, broad fingers that reached for her. The hair on her nape rose. Go with a shifter? What, did she have the word stupid written on her forehead? She made no move to take his hand. Instead, she asked, \u201cAnd just who might you be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDetective Colin Gyth.\u201d He withdrew his hand, used it to pull out a black wallet, flashed her an ID card for all of two seconds.</p><p>\u201cAh...I need to see that again.\u201d Oh no, never trust a shifter.</p><p>His black brows lowered and he tossed her the wallet.</p><p>Emily took a moment to study the picture and ID information. Hmmm. It all looked legitimate. But what did the detective want with her?</p><p>\u201cUh, Dr. Drake?\u201d Marvin\u2019s quiet voice.</p><p>She\u2019d almost forgotten about him. Emily stepped back from the doorway, gave him a wan smile. \u201cIt\u2019s all right. You can go now.\u201d</p><p>He eyed the cop. \u201cYou sure?\u201d</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>\u201cWell, okay, then.\u201d Colin Gyth didn\u2019t step back when Marvin approached the door, and the vampire wound up brushing against him as he crossed the threshold of the office.</p><p>Colin\u2019s nostrils flared slightly and he turned his head, watching carefully as Marvin headed toward the elevator. He didn\u2019t speak, not until the shining, mirrored doors had closed behind Marvin\u2019s pale form. \u201cHe a client?\u201d</p><p>Emily didn\u2019t answer, just stared back at him.</p><p>Colin sighed. \u201cSorry, none of my business, right?\u201d</p><p>It sure as hell wasn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cLook, Dr. Drake, my captain sent me down here to get you. We\u2019ve got a top priority case that\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour captain?\u201d Her heart began to beat faster. She knew a guy who worked on the Atlanta PD. He\u2019d been one of her first patients when she\u2019d opened her practice.</p><p>\u201cYeah, Danny McNeal. He wants you to look at a crime scene.\u201d</p><p>Danny. She kept her face expressionless. It was a skill she\u2019d perfected years ago. When you could tell a person\u2019s innermost thoughts, it helped to be able to cloak your response. Cause sometimes, the thoughts that she picked up scared her to death.</p><p>Hmmm. So Danny had sent him. That relaxed her a bit, but...\u201cI\u2019m not a forensic psychologist, I can\u2019t help with any kind of\u2014\u201d</p><p>His hand reached out, snagged hers. \u201cHe told me to come get you.\u201d</p><p>His hand was warm. Strong. Colin\u2019s scent, rich, masculine, wrapped around her, and a strange ball of heat began to form in her stomach.</p><p>His blue stare held hers. \u201cAnd, lady, I\u2019m sure as hell not leaving this building without you.\u201d</p><p>She wasn\u2019t what he\u2019d expected.</p><p>Colin Gyth glanced at Dr. Drake\u2014 Emily\u2014from the corner of his eye as he pulled his Jeep to a stop in front of the two-story house at the end of Byron Street.</p><p>He\u2019d heard of her before, of course. Heard rumors, whispers about the Monster Doctor. But rumors, in his experience, usually didn\u2019t amount to jackshit.</p><p>So, after getting the order from his captain, he\u2019d done some quick research on Emily.</p><p>According to her driver\u2019s license, Emily was thirty-one, five foot five, and weighed one hundred thirty pounds. He\u2019d learned that she\u2019d been born and bred in Atlanta. Went to college at Emory and got her degrees there. She had a Ph.D. in psychology, with a dual focus on clinical studies as well as neuroscience and animal behavior. Her mom was a teacher at a local elementary school, and her dad was deceased.</p><p>The good doctor had never been in trouble with the law. She paid her taxes, owned a house in one of the historic suburbs, and was single.</p><p>She had long, midnight black hair\u2014hair that was currently pulled back in a rather painful-looking bun. She wore black-rimmed glasses that made her wide, green eyes look even bigger.</p><p>Yeah, he knew the basic facts about her, but he hadn\u2019t known how...pretty she actually was. And pretty was a good word for her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The woman wasn\u2019t cute, she wasn\u2019t drop-dead gorgeous, but she was pretty. Nice heart-shaped face, a chin that was a little too pointed, high cheekbones and perfect bow red lips.</p><p>And her body. Very, very nice. Round, firm breasts. Long, shapely legs. When she\u2019d climbed into his Jeep, her black skirt had hiked up two inches and he\u2019d been given a glorious glimpse of her thighs. The woman had a killer pair of legs.</p><p>And he\u2019d always been a sucker for great legs.</p> <p>\u201cI-is this the place?\u201d</p><p>He stiffened at the sound of her voice. That warm, husky Southern drawl. He could imagine hearing that voice late at night, when they were in bed.</p><p>What the hell? Colin shook his head. Now was not the time to start fantasizing about the doctor. He was on a case. And really, the lady wasn\u2019t his type. He\u2019d never gone for the brainy broads. He liked the party girls. The here-today-gone-tomorrow-no-questions-asked girls.</p><p>And as for the doc, well, damn, she asked questions for a living.</p><p>Definitely not his type.</p> <p>He cleared his throat, dragged his gaze from her legs, and glanced at the brightly lit house. Teams of cops were scouring the yard, shining flashlights, interviewing neighbors. \u201cYeah, this is it.\u201d</p><p>He wasn\u2019t sure why McNeal had ordered him to pick her up. But, hey, he\u2019d been around long enough to learn that when the captain gave an order, you followed it.</p><p>He shoved open his door, started to walk around and let the doc out, but she jumped from the vehicle and headed for the house.</p><p>A uniformed cop stepped in front of her, holding up his hand as she approached the house\u2019s open front door. \u201cHey, lady, you can\u2019t go in there\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, she can.\u201d McNeal\u2019s gravelly voice. The captain tapped the cop on the shoulder as he appeared directly behind the young guy in the entranceway.</p><p>The patrol cop gulped, mumbled an apology, and seemed to slink away.</p> <p>\u201cHi, Danny.\u201d A hint of warmth crept into Emily\u2019s voice.</p><p>Colin\u2019s eyes narrowed as he stalked behind her. Just what was her relationship with the captain?</p><p>Danny McNeal was one of the toughest sonofabitches he\u2019d ever met. The guy was in his early forties, completely bald, and built like a linebacker.</p><p>And, as far as Colin knew, the guy wasn\u2019t a shifter, a demon, or any other sort of monster.</p><p>Just your average bad-ass human.</p><p>So how did the guy know the Monster Doctor?</p><p>When McNeal hugged Emily, Colin stiffened and a hot lick of something that sure as hell couldn\u2019t be jealousy ripped through him.</p><p>No, it couldn\u2019t be jealousy. He\u2019d just met the woman less than thirty minutes ago. He didn\u2019t have a claim on her.</p> <p>The captain\u2019s hands seemed to linger around Emily, and Colin got the impression that there was some genuine affection between the two. Were they lovers?</p><p>McNeal\u2019s gunmetal gray eyes met his. \u201cColin, give us a minute.\u201d</p><p>His jaw clenched as he nodded, then he stepped back a few feet. He could have stepped back twenty feet, it wouldn\u2019t have made any difference. McNeal might think he was getting some privacy, but thanks to his enhancements, Colin had hypersensitive hearing.</p><p>\u201cI need your help,\u201d McNeal murmured.</p><p>Colin turned his back on them, watched the cops searching the area.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a body inside,\u201d his captain continued, his voice little more than a whisper of sound. \u201cI need to know if he\u2019s human or...\u201d</p><p>He let his sentence trail off. There was a moment of silence, then he said, \u201cI know you can tell if someone\u2019s Other just by being near if the subject is alive, but will you be able to tell when he\u2019s dead?\u201d</p><p>Oh shit. Every muscle in Colin\u2019s body tightened. Other was the general term for any magical being, a catch-all phrase that had evolved years ago.</p><p>His eyes squeezed closed and he began to sweat. The doc could tell if you were Other just be being near you? If that were true, then he was seriously screwed.</p><p>No one on the force knew about him. And if anyone found out, if the captain were to learn\u2014</p><p>\u201cI can tell,\u201d Emily finally spoke, and her voice was just as quiet as McNeal\u2019s. \u201cIf the death is recent, some of the spirit will still be there.\u201d</p><p>Damn. Damn. Damn. His eyes snapped open. The woman could tell if a dead guy was human or Other. Then she had to know about him.</p><p>But why hadn\u2019t she said anything? She\u2019d gotten into his Jeep, as calm as you please, driven for miles, and never said a word about him being\u2014</p><p>\u201cThe guy died less than two hours ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I can tell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m also gonna need an idea of what did this.\u201d</p><p>What, not who, Colin noticed. He\u2019d seen the body earlier, and he knew exactly why his captain was suspecting that the killer hadn\u2019t necessarily been human.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do my best,\u201d Emily promised.</p><p>McNeal grunted. Then, \u201cColin, come here!\u201d</p><p>Colin glanced back over his shoulder, carefully avoiding Emily\u2019s stare. He\u2019d deal with her later.</p><p>McNeal motioned toward the door. \u201cShow her the vic.\u201d</p><p>He sauntered up the steps, brushed his body lightly against hers as he passed. \u201cHope you\u2019ve got a strong stomach.\u201d It was all the warning he\u2019d give her. He didn\u2019t think she\u2019d be able to handle the body inside too well. Colin could still smell the stench of vomit from the first two green cops who\u2019d found the victim.</p><p>He led her inside, past the gleaming parquet flooring in the foyer, past the spiral staircase, and straight to the body.</p><p>Or what was left of it.</p><p>\u201cOh my God! \u201d She sucked in a sharp breath. Stumbled to a stop near the puddle of congealed blood.</p><p>He glanced at her face then. The color had bleached away. And her eyes, so big, so wide, were full of horror.</p><p>The impulse to touch her, to comfort her, rushed through him. His hand lifted.</p><p>She fell to her knees beside the body.</p><p>His fingers balled into a fist, dropped to his side.</p><p>A faint tremble shook her. She stared at the man\u2019s body. Gazed at his face, at the eyes that were wide open, staring at the ceiling in abject terror, at the mouth that was contorted in a final, silent scream.</p><p>Then her focus shifted to his neck, to the neck that had been ripped wide open.</p><p>\u201cI-I need to see Captain McNeal.\u201d She rose to her feet, swaying for a moment.</p><p>Is the guy human? His teeth snapped together as he bit back the question. It was his damn case. He needed as much information as he could get, and he didn\u2019t want the doc and the captain keeping him in the dark.</p><p>He had a killer to find, and whether the guy was just a crazy-ass human or something more, he needed all the information about the perp he could get.</p><p>He lifted his hand, motioned for McNeal, and watched as his captain hurried across the room.</p><p>\u201cAh, Colin, can you excuse us for a minute?\u201d He reached for Emily\u2019s arm.</p><p>Colin stepped in front of him, effectively blocking his move. \u201cI wanna hear what she\u2019s got to say.\u201d His eyes met McNeal\u2019s.</p><p>A muscle flexed along McNeal\u2019s jaw. \u201cI\u2019ll let you know the doctor\u2019s opinion\u2014\u201d</p><p>Not good enough.</p><p>Emily pushed past him, stopped beside the captain.</p><p>Colin slanted a quick glance at her, then said, \u201cI wanna know what the Monster Doctor thinks.\u201d</p><p>She jerked, a slight but telling movement.</p><p>So did the captain.</p><p>McNeal\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u201cHow much do you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEnough.\u201d Most folks didn\u2019t know about the creatures that lived right next to the humans, didn\u2019t know about the dangerous world that existed in the shadows.</p><p>People thought monsters lived in horror movies. Thought that life was about birthday parties, Christmas trees, and summer vacations.</p><p>But he knew better. Hell, he\u2019d lived most of his life in the darkness that everyone else feared. He knew the smell of evil, had seen firsthand just how perverted the world could be.</p><p>Yeah, he knew about the monsters.</p><p>After all, he was one of them.</p><p>McNeal glanced around at the other cops. At least five other officers\u2014three men, two women\u2014were in the room. He jerked his thumb toward the kitchen.</p><p>Emily nodded her understanding and led the way to the white swinging door.</p><p>No cops were inside. The kitchen had already been cleared.</p><p>McNeal waited until the door swung shut behind Colin, then he growled, \u201cThis doesn\u2019t go past the three of us, got that, Gyth?\u201d</p><p>Colin nodded.</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d McNeal leveled his stare at Emily. \u201cWell?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was human.\u201d</p><p>A grunt. \u201cGood. At least I don\u2019t have to worry about the ME finding two hearts inside the guy....\u201d He blew out a hard breath.</p><p>\u201cAfter a couple of times, those explanations get harder to make.\u201d</p><p>Yeah, he just bet they did. Colin kept his attention on Emily. \u201cSo, Doc, any ideas about what might have done that to him?\u201d</p><p>She nibbled her lower lip for a moment, then said, \u201cIt could have been an animal attack, maybe a dog\u2014\u201d</p><p>But the captain was shaking his head. \u201cThe owner of the house has one of those fancy security systems with cameras trained on the doors. We\u2019ve got a picture of the perp\u2014a guy in a black hood who was smart enough to keep his damn face hidden\u2014and there\u2019s no animal with him.\u201d</p><p>Emily\u2019s eyes narrowed.</p><p>\u201cSo what do you think, Doc?\u201d Colin pressed. \u201cWhat kind of thing could have done this?\u201d</p><p>Her head cocked to the side and she studied him with that too-knowing gaze of hers. \u201cWell, Detective,\u201d she finally murmured, \u201cthe way I figure it, there are three prime suspects.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t speak, just waited for her.</p><p>She held up one finger. \u201cA vampire.\u201d</p><p>A second finger. \u201cA demon.\u201d</p><p>Third finger. \u201cOr\u201d\u2014she stared straight into his eyes\u2014\u201ca shifter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA shifter?\u201d McNeal whistled softly. \u201cWhat kind of shifter would do that?\u201d</p><p>Her shoulders lifted in a faint shrug. \u201cA bear. A panther, any kind of wildcat really, or...a wolf.\u201d Her green eyes were still on him.</p><p>Watching, weighing.</p><p>Judging.</p><p>With an effort, Colin managed not to squirm.</p><p>McNeal made a faint hmmming sound. \u201cIs there any way to tell for certain?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe ME might be able to tell if it\u2019s a shifter.\u201d She pulled off her glasses, polished them absently on her shirt.</p><p>Colin blinked. Oh, he liked her without the glasses. She looked softer, sweeter, like\u2014</p><p>\u201cHe can look for animal hairs. Compare the radius of the bite marks to let us know what we\u2019re looking at.\u201d</p><p>Colin raised his brows, impressed. The doc might specialize in mind games, but she knew a bit of forensics too.</p><p>Her gaze drifted to the white door that stood between them and the den, between them and the body. \u201cThere is so much rage here,\u201d she whispered softly. \u201cI can feel the echoes.\u201d</p><p>And just how the hell could she do that?</p><p>The doc was a bigger mystery, and a hell of a bigger threat to him, than he\u2019d originally thought.</p><p>\u201cYou have to find this guy.\u201d She swallowed, straightened her shoulders and seemed to shake off a heavy weight. \u201cBefore he does this again.\u201d</p><p>Colin stiffened. \u201cAgain?\u201d He repeated softly. So far, they just had one body. Sure, the killer had obviously been in a fury\u2014there was blood everywhere, pooled near the victim, smeared on the walls, the furniture, but that didn\u2019t mean they were dealing with a serial\u2014</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll do it again.\u201d She sounded absolutely certain.</p><p>McNeal swore beneath his breath. \u201cYou sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Colin stepped toward her, stepped right in front of her so that barely an inch separated them. \u201cAnd how do you know that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause now he\u2019s gotten a taste for the kill.\u201d Her gaze held his. Her breath blew lightly across his skin. Her scent, the light, fragrant scent of roses, filled the air around him. \u201cOnce a creature like this gets a taste, there\u2019s no going back.\u201d</p><p>The good doctor sure as hell sounded like she knew what she was talking about. But he hoped, hoped with every fiber of his being, that she was wrong.</p><p>Because if one of his kind really was off on a killing spree, then the humans were screwed.</p><p>Chapter 2</p><p>She couldn\u2019t get the dead man out of her head.</p><p>Emily stared blankly at the flickering TV screen, a bowl of Dutch chocolate ice cream in her lap, a spoon gripped tightly in her fist.</p><p>She\u2019d left the crime scene long ago. Been driven back to her office by one of the patrolmen on duty. She\u2019d thanked the fellow, very politely, then gotten into her car and traveled home. And she\u2019d been shaking the whole time.</p><p>Dammit. It wasn\u2019t as if that had been the first dead body she\u2019d ever seen.</p><p>She\u2019d found her grandmother after her heart attack, and her father after his suicide.</p><p>She stabbed the spoon down into the rapidly melting chocolate. No, it hadn\u2019t been her first dead body, but the sight had still hit her like a punch in the gut.</p><p>Jesus. There had been so much blood.</p><p>And she currently had four vamps as patients, so it wasn\u2019t as if she weren\u2019t used to dealing with blood. Every time she touched their thoughts, images of blood took center stage.</p><p>But tonight, that man...he\u2019d been different. The vamps she saw treated blood like it was sacred. To them, blood was life.</p><p>Yet when she\u2019d seen the crime scene, the blood had meant nothing more than death.</p><p>I have to stop thinking about the body. Emily took a big bite of the ice cream, feeing the cold, delicious chocolate slide over her tongue.</p><p>Her toes curled into her carpet. Oh, that was better. That was\u2014 </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>A flash of headlights lit up her living room.</p><p>What in the hell?</p><p>She pushed the bowl of ice cream onto her coffee table, rose quickly, and turned toward her window. Through the thin curtains, she could see a vehicle pulling into her driveway.</p> <p>The purring of the engine reached her ears, followed by the faint crunch of gravel beneath the tires.</p><p>Her gaze darted back toward her TV stand, locking briefly on the VCR clock. Two-thirteen A.M.</p><p>Who would be coming to visit her at two A.M.?</p><p>A car door slammed. Footsteps rapped against her sidewalk.</p><p>The image of a blood-soaked room flashed before her eyes. The image of death, of a man\u2019s final, terrified scream.</p> <p>Her doorbell rang.</p><p>Emily crept toward the door, moving almost soundlessly over the carpet. She pressed her hands against the wooden door, leaned forward, peered through the peephole, and saw\u2014Detective Colin Gyth. He was standing just on the other side of her door, illuminated by the porch light.</p><p>Her breath expelled in a nervous rush. Okay. She should probably be glad that a cop\u2014 instead of a robber or some kind of crazed killer\u2014had come to see her in the middle of the night. But Detective Gyth...</p><p>He just wasn\u2019t your average cop.</p><p>And the guy made her very, very uneasy.</p><p>She opened the bottom lock but kept her security chain in place as she opened the door two inches. Enough room for them to talk, but nothing else. \u201cDetective Gyth?\u201d</p> <p>He stepped closer. The light dipped across his face, making him look somewhat sinister.</p><p>Oh yeah, like she needed that visual right then.</p><p>\u201cI need to talk to you.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d figured that out, considering the guy had driven all the way to her place\u2014 and really, just how had he known where I lived? He must\u2019ve had her checked out, she realized. Probably when Danny had first told him to contact her.</p><p>\u201cDr. Drake?\u201d He lifted his hand, touched his palm to the door. \u201cLet me in.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t want to. Every instinct she had screamed at her. Letting Gyth inside would be a very serious mistake.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to cause a scene\u201d\u2014his dark voice was pitched low\u2014\u201cbut if I have to wake your neighbors to get inside, I\u2019ll do it.\u201d</p><p>Her chin lifted. \u201cI don\u2019t like being threatened, Detective.\u201d She started to push the door closed. She had only two immediate neighbors. One was out of town\u2014the family had gone on a vacation to Disney World. The other, well, there was no way Shirley was home yet.</p> <p>\u201cWait!\u201d His palm shoved against the door, effectively halting her movement. His eyes met hers. \u201cWould you please let me come inside?\u201d</p><p>Umm, now that sounded like it must\u2019ve hurt. But she still wasn\u2019t budging. \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you, I need to talk to you.\u201d</p><p>Yeah, and so did all of her patients, but she wasn\u2019t inviting them inside her house in the middle of the night.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s about the case.\u201d</p><p>He had her attention.</p><p>\u201cAll right.\u201d Her fingers fumbled with the chain. \u201cYou can come in for five minutes. Got that? It\u2019s late, I want to sleep, and you can just come in for\u2014\u201d</p><p>He pushed open the door, stepped inside, his big body forcing hers back. His thumb lifted, rubbed against her bottom lip. Then he brought his hand to his mouth and licked the tip of his thumb. \u201cMmmm...\u201d</p><p>She stared at him, eyes wide, mouth agape. He hadn\u2019t just\u2014</p><p>His lips tilted into a smile. \u201cI love chocolate.\u201d His gaze dropped down to her lips. \u201cMind if I have another taste?\u201d</p><p>Emily stepped back, ramming into the wall. Her heart was suddenly beating too fast. Her palms were damp, and that tight, hot feeling was back in her stomach again. And all he\u2019d done was touch her lips.</p><p>Oh no, she could not want this man.</p><p>Getting involved with a shifter would be pure idiocy.</p><p>She swiped her hand over her lips, trying to rub away any ice cream that might be left. Didn\u2019t want to leave any temptation for him.</p><p>\u201cHmmm. Guess that\u2019s a no, huh?\u201d Colin sighed, glancing back toward her living room.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a definite no.\u201d Despite the little voice in her head that wondered, just for a moment, what it would be like if he kissed her.</p><p>Emily inhaled sharply. It was late, she was getting loopy, and she was most definitely not finding the shifter attractive.</p><p>\u201cIs it because of what I am?\u201d He asked the question as he turned his back on her and sauntered into her living room.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d She shook her head, hurriedly slammed and locked the front door, and followed on his heels. \u201cI thought you came by to discuss the case.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUmm.\u201d Not really an answer. He made himself comfortable on her sofa, put his boots on her coffee table. \u201cNice. Real comfortable place you\u2019ve got.\u201d His stare swept around the room, noting the bookcases, the light yellow walls, the big-screen TV. \u201cI like it.\u201d</p><p>Well, that was just great.</p><p>Damn. She should have never let him in.</p><p>\u201cYou and I have a problem, Doc.\u201d He turned that bright blue stare back on her as she stood at the edge of the couch, glowering down at him.</p><p>Emily stared at him silently, waiting.</p><p>\u201cYou know what I am.\u201d His voice roughened slightly as he made this announcement.</p><p>She didn\u2019t deny it. What would be the point?</p><p>His eyes narrowed fractionally as he studied her expression. \u201cThat\u2019s not good for me. Not good at all.\u201d</p><p>A flicker of nervousness shot through her. She wasn\u2019t sensing any sort of physical threat from the cop, but maybe she just wasn\u2019t looking deep enough into him.</p><p>His hand snagged her wrist.</p><p>And her pulse skyrocketed beneath his grip.</p><p>\u201cHow much do you know?\u201d</p><p>Emily swallowed, tried to figure out just how much she should reveal.</p><p>His hold tightened around her.</p><p>He was the one sitting down, the one forced to look up at her, but Emily had the feeling she was the one in the vulnerable position.</p><p>\u201cI-I know you aren\u2019t human.\u201d Her voice came out softer, huskier than she\u2019d intended.</p><p>She hoped Colin would leave it at that. Hoped he wouldn\u2019t probe any deeper.</p><p>\u201cAh, baby, I already knew that.\u201d</p><p>She tried to tug her hand free, but his grip was unbreakable.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the Monster Doctor, the one all the local ghouls go to see.\u201d A faint trace of amusement underscored his words. But his eyes were watchful, intense, showing no echo of humor.</p><p>Her jaw clenched. \u201cLet go of my hand.\u201d</p><p>He smiled at her, and his fingers fell away from her wrist.</p><p>Emily immediately sprang across the room, putting several feet between them. Nice, protective space. \u201cLook, if you aren\u2019t here to discuss the case, then I want you to leave.\u201d She turned her back on him, heading toward the front door.</p><p>\u201cHow do you do it?\u201d</p><p>His words stopped her.</p><p>\u201cHow do you tell who\u2019s human and who isn\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>She heard the soft rustle of the sofa cushions as he rose.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a pretty interesting talent you\u2019ve got there. And I\u2019m just dying to know exactly how you do it.\u201d</p><p>Emily cast a longing glance toward the front door. \u201cI\u2019m afraid you\u2019re just going to have to live with your curiosity, Detective.\u201d</p><p>Because she sure as hell wasn\u2019t going to reveal her innermost secrets to a stranger. Yep, letting the guy inside had been a definite mistake.</p><p>\u201cHmmm.\u201d His breath blew against the nape of her neck. Emily jumped, startled to find him so close to her. The guy hadn\u2019t made a sound when he\u2019d crossed the room.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to see your hair down,\u201d he muttered, and his fingers brushed against the bun she\u2019d yet to unwind.</p><p>She jerked away from him. \u201cAnd I\u2019d like to see you leave. Guess which one of us is about to get her wish?\u201d</p><p>His hard lips curved into a smile, a smile with a hint of real warmth. \u201cTough lady, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d had to be.</p><p>His smile slowly faded. \u201cBut trust me, I\u2019m a hell of a lot tougher than you could ever dream of being.\u201d And in a flash, he had her pinned against the wall. His strong, hard body pressed against her, his muscular thighs pushed between hers, shoving up her skirt, and his right hand locked around her wrists as he forced them against the wall over her head.</p><p>Her breath left her body in a startled gasp.</p><p>\u201cNow let\u2019s try this again,\u201d he growled. \u201cJust how much do you know about me?\u201d</p><p>His anger hit her then. Hot, fierce. Oh yes, the detective was enraged. He was also...</p><p>Afraid.</p><p>If the other cops find out what I am, they\u2019ll kick me off the force. Make me leave. No one will trust me. They\u2019ll all think I\u2019m some kind of fucking animal, just like the guys back in Grisam did.</p><p>Mike tried to kill me. Because he knew. He knew, just like she knows.</p><p>She knows...</p><p>His thoughts hit her, hard, pummeling right through her mind.</p><p>She thinks I\u2019m an animal...a monster, a\u2014</p><p>\u201cI-I don\u2019t!\u201d The words were torn from her. His thoughts were flying into her mind so quickly now. Too quickly. She tried to raise her shields, tried to block the onslaught of sudden images\u2014</p><p>Colin, covered in blood, holding his shoulder, staring up at a pale man with a face full of freckles. \u201cWhy? Why?\u201d</p><p>Colin, staring up at a burning house, his fists clenched, his face twisted in hate.</p><p>Colin, changing, shifting\u2014</p><p>\u201cAaah! \u201d She slammed her shields up. She didn\u2019t need to see any more. Didn\u2019t want to see what he\u2019d become.</p><p>\u201cEmily?\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d squeezed her eyes shut.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to hurt you.\u201d</p><p>Yes, she believed him. A hard rage was riding him, but Colin was still in control. She lifted her lashes, peeking up at him. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to worry,\u201d Emily told him, completely sincere, \u201cI\u2019m not going to tell anyone about you.\u201d She\u2019d been keeping secrets for people\u2014patients, friends, strangers she met on the street\u2014for years now.</p><p>He grunted. \u201cAnd I\u2019m just supposed to believe you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you are.\u201d This close, she could see the flecks of gold in his eyes. And they were nice eyes. Not nearly as cold or hard as she\u2019d originally thought.</p><p>\u201cSorry, Doc, but I don\u2019t trust you for a minute.\u201d</p><p>Fair enough. She hadn\u2019t trusted him either, until she\u2019d gone tiptoeing through his thoughts.</p><p>Course, if he found out about her little journey, he\u2019d probably just be even more pissed off.</p><p>\u201cDo you know what I am?\u201d</p><p>Emily nodded. No point in denying it now. \u201cYou\u2019re a shifter.\u201d</p><p>His fingers tightened around her wrists, not quite, but almost hurting her. \u201cHow the fuck do you know that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh...can you ease up there a bit, Gyth?\u201d</p><p>His brows beetled.</p><p>\u201cThe hands,\u201d she elaborated. \u201cLittle too tight.\u201d</p><p>He eased his hold. \u201cHow do you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI always know.\u201d That was true. \u201cI can tell with a look.\u201d Sometimes she could tell just by hearing a voice or catching a scent on the wind. When it came to the Other, she was definitely wired for them. \u201cYour kind\u2014you carry a glow with you. Like a bright shadow that follows you everywhere.\u201d The shadow of the beast.</p><p>He winced. \u201cCan others see this damn glow?\u201d</p><p>Not as far as she knew. \u201cI\u2019ve never known anyone else who can see the things I can.\u201d And she\u2019d looked. Searched desperately for years. Especially back at the beginning, back when she\u2019d thought she was crazy.</p><p>\u201cShit.\u201d</p><p>Yes, that pretty well summed up the situation. Emily wiggled her fingers. \u201cMind letting me go now?\u201d</p><p>His nostrils flared and his gaze dropped to her lips. \u201cYeah, Doc, as a matter of fact, I do.\u201d</p><p>The woman smelled like sin. Like a delicious combination of roses, rich chocolate, and seductive female flesh, and he really, really wanted to taste her.</p><p>His canine teeth were starting to lengthen, an unfortunate side effect of his shifter blood. When he got angry or aroused, the beast tended to wake up.</p><p>And the good doctor had succeeded in both royally pissing him off and turning him on.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t wearing her glasses now. Her eyes looked soft, sexy.</p><p>His head lowered toward her.</p><p>\u201cWh-what are you doing?\u201d She stiffened against him.</p><p>The lady had a Ph.D. He figured she had a pretty good idea of what he was about to do. Slowly, deliberately, he brought his lips to hers.</p><p>Her mouth parted on a startled breath.</p><p>Perfect.</p><p>His lips brushed hers, his tongue thrust inside the wet warmth of her mouth.</p><p>Oh, damn, but she tasted good. His tongue slipped past the edge of her teeth, rubbed against hers. Stroked. Teased.</p><p>A faint moan rumbled in her throat and she kissed him back.</p><p>Her breasts brushed against his chest. The nipples were tight, pebbled. He wanted to touch them, but he didn\u2019t think the doc was ready for that.</p><p>He sucked her tongue slowly, drawing out the kiss, wanting to make every second count. His cock was rock hard for her, pressing tight against the tempting cradle of her sex.</p><p>What he wouldn\u2019t give to have her naked beneath him right then.</p><p>Colin forced himself to break the kiss, forced his head to lift. Her lips were red, wet from his mouth.</p><p>She glared up at him, and her breath sounded ragged to his ears. \u201cAre you satisfied now?\u201d</p><p>Not by a long shot. But he had a good idea of just how the doc could satisfy him.</p><p>Her bedroom had to be down the darkened hallway. He could take her in there, strip her, and\u2014 </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNot going to happen.\u201d She exhaled slowly, shaking her head. \u201cSo you can just forget about that. A kiss is one thing, shifter. Sex is a whole other game.\u201d</p><p>He blinked. \u201cAh, now, baby, what makes you think I was\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHands off, now, \u201d she snapped, not answering his question, but instead narrowing those gorgeous green eyes of hers.</p> <p>He liked her eyes. Liked the dark, emerald green. Course, those eyes were starting to shine with a rather furious glint.</p><p>Reluctantly, he dropped his hands. Colin inhaled her delicious scent one more time, then he stepped back, completely freeing her.</p><p>Her hands dropped to her sides. \u201cFuture reference note.\u201d Her chin jutted into the air. \u201cIf I want you to kiss me, I\u2019ll tell you. I\u2019m not a big fan of the He-man routine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, so you\u2019re already thinking of our future.\u201d</p><p>Her lips thinned.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s fine, Doc. When you want to be kissed, you just let me know.\u201d He\u2019d be more than happy to oblige her.</p><p>\u201cWhat I want is for you to go.\u201d She pointed toward the door. \u201cNow.\u201d</p><p>Colin didn\u2019t think that was what she really wanted. He could smell her arousal in the air, and her nipples were still tight with desire, thrusting against the white T-shirt she wore. But he nodded.</p><p>He\u2019d accomplished most of his goals by coming to see the doc.</p><p>He\u2019d discovered that she knew he was a shifter, and she\u2019d given her word that she wouldn\u2019t reveal his secret. For now, he\u2019d take her at her word. Wasn\u2019t like he had much choice in the matter. He\u2019d try trusting her, and for the doc\u2019s sake, he sure as hell hoped that she didn\u2019t betray him.</p><p>So he\u2019d gotten her to lay her cards on the table, and he\u2019d finally gotten to taste her. For nearly three straight hours, he\u2019d wanted to feel her lips beneath his. Now that he had, well, he wanted to taste her again.</p> <p>And he would. Soon.</p><p>He stalked toward the front door, flipped the locks.</p><p>\u201cYou never wanted to talk to me about the case, did you?\u201d Her voice stopped him.</p><p>Colin glanced back at her. She still stood against the wall, but her arms were crossed over her chest now and her left foot tapped out a hard rhythm on the floor. \u201cI don\u2019t want to talk about that yet.\u201d Not until he\u2019d gotten his report from the ME and he\u2019d talked to McNeal about the possibility of bringing Emily on the case in a more official capacity.</p><p>If she was right, if the killer really was Other, then he figured the PD would need all the help it could get in solving the case.</p><p>And who better to hunt a monster than the good doctor?</p><p>\u201cWould you work with us?\u201d he asked as he began to make his plan of attack. McNeal had brought her on originally; he\u2019d probably okay pulling Emily completely onto the case.</p><p>\u201cWork with you?\u201d Her foot stopped tapping. \u201cI already did. I told you what I know and\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLady, I have the feeling you know a hell of a lot more than you told me.\u201d About the case, about him\u2014but he\u2019d deal with all that in due time.</p><p>Her expression never altered. \u201cWhat is it you want from me?\u201d</p><p>Once he\u2019d gotten the official okay, he wanted her to be\u2014\u201cA profiler. I want you to give me a workup on this guy, want you to tell me exactly how he thinks, how he lives.\u201d So that he could catch the bastard before he hurt anyone else. \u201cCan you do that?\u201d</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll be seeing you soon, Doc.\u201d And they\u2019d start tracking a killer.</p><p>Hmmm. Not a usual date, but with the doc, he had a feeling he\u2019d have to take what he could get.</p><p>They\u2019d been inside the house for twenty minutes. The cop had gone in, like he owned the place, and he\u2019d been inside with her for twenty minutes.</p><p>A slow rage began to build inside him. This shouldn\u2019t have happened. This should never have happened.</p><p>Her front door opened. The cop appeared. He looked back at the woman, muttered something, then marched down the steps.</p><p>His body tensed as he watched them. He\u2019d hidden himself well; they wouldn\u2019t be able to see him in the darkness. He was\u2014</p><p>The cop froze. Lifted his head. Looked slowly around the yard.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Her voice. Dr. Drake stepped onto the porch. The light cascaded over her. For an instant, with that shining light all around her, she almost looked like an angel.</p><p>But he knew she wasn\u2019t an angel. No, not an angel. Never an angel. The doctor was a demon. Just like the others.</p><p>The cop was looking right at his hiding spot now. The guy took a step forward.</p><p>\u201cGyth? Is someone out there?\u201d Dr. Drake crossed to the cop\u2019s side.</p><p>A trickle of sweat slid down his cheek. He realized the crickets around him had stopped chirping. The night was quiet, too quiet.</p><p>Now wasn\u2019t the time, he realized, inching deeper into the brush.</p><p>He\u2019d come back for the doctor another night. Wait until she was alone.</p><p>Then he\u2019d destroy the demon.</p><p>After all, hunting demons was his job.</p><p>Colin stared into the dark, twisted trees on the vacant lot across the street. For an instant, he\u2019d sworn he\u2019d heard something, someone.</p><p>He spared a quick look at Emily. She was gazing at the trees, a faint furrow between her brows.</p><p>\u201cI want to check that place out,\u201d he told her, and pulled his gun from the holster at his hip. \u201cStay here.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t wait to see if she obeyed, just took off, moving slowly, stealthily across the street. Maybe he was wrong, maybe he was just too damn tired, but he had to check the place out.</p><p>Because his instincts were screaming at him, and he never, ever ignored his instincts.</p><p>The faint scent of cigarettes teased his nostrils as he crept closer. Yeah, someone had been here all right.</p><p>But why?</p><p>The moonlight barely trickled past the trees, but he\u2019d always had excellent night vision. Another little shifter side effect. So he could easily see the ground and the bent grass where someone had knelt, where someone had watched.</p><p>A growl rumbled in his throat.</p><p>His fingers tightened around the butt of his gun and\u2014</p><p>A twig snapped behind him. He spun around, gun drawn, leveled, aimed, and ready to fire\u2014</p><p>Right between Emily\u2019s eyes.</p><p>\u201cDammit!\u201d He lowered his gun. \u201cDidn\u2019t I tell you to stay put?\u201d</p><p>Her gaze followed the movement of the gun, then slowly lifted back to his face. \u201cYes, but I\u2019m not a dog. I don\u2019t generally \u2018stay\u2019</p><p>when I\u2019m told.\u201d</p><p>He realized the doctor was annoyed. Good. Matched him perfectly. \u201cFuture reference note,\u201d he muttered, quoting her earlier words back to her, \u201cwhen I give an order, there\u2019s usually a damn good reason for it. And next time, you\u2019d sure as hell better listen to me.\u201d</p><p>Her lips tightened. \u201cI thought you might need some help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Jesus. He was the cop! He didn\u2019t need the mind doctor to back him up.</p><p>And he was a shifter\u2014that fact alone meant he knew how to guard his own ass.</p><p>She muttered something beneath her breath, something he didn\u2019t quite catch but sounded a lot like \u201casshole shifter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit. Just stay behind me, all right?\u201d He wanted to check out the thick patch of bushes up ahead. He strained, trying to listen for any telltale sound that might indicate the watcher was still there. But he heard only the call of crickets, the faint rustle of the leaves in the breeze.</p><p>He crept ahead, keeping his gun up. Emily\u2019s soft footsteps whispered behind him.</p><p>With his right hand, he pushed back a mass of bushes. Saw only dark earth.</p><p>He looked up, gazing straight ahead. There was no sign of anyone else. He couldn\u2019t hear anyone, and he had damn good hearing.</p><p>Looked like their watcher was gone.</p><p>Pity. He would\u2019ve liked to have found out exactly why the sonofabitch was hanging outside the doc\u2019s place.</p><p>He spun back around, frowning down at Emily. In the darkness, he knew she couldn\u2019t see much of him, probably little more than the rough outline of his body. \u201cYou got any enemies I should know about, Doc?\u201d</p><p>With his enhanced vision, Colin could see every detail of her face and body. He could easily recognize the sudden tension on Emily\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cDoc?\u201d</p><p>She swallowed. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d interrogated enough perps to know when someone was lying to him. But he decided not to push her. Not yet.</p><p>Colin pushed his gun back into its holster. \u201cWell, looks like one of us managed to catch someone\u2019s attention.\u201d He stalked back to the circle of bent grass. Kneeling, he inhaled and caught the same stale scent of cigarettes he\u2019d noticed earlier.</p><p>Someone had been hiding in the darkness, watching her or him. But why?</p><p>He sure as hell intended to find out.</p><p>But first\u2014first he was going to discover just what sort of enemies the mysterious Dr. Drake had.</p><p>Chapter 3</p><p>\u201cYou wanna do what?\u201d Danny McNeal shot forward in his worn leather chair.</p><p>Colin stared levelly back at him. \u201cHey, you\u2019re the one who brought her in.\u201d He paused, then said, \u201cNow that the doc\u2019s in the game, I want to keep using her.\u201d</p><p>McNeal rubbed his right hand over his gleaming head. \u201cI don\u2019t think you know what you\u2019re dealing with here, Gyth.\u201d</p><p>Oh, he had a pretty good idea.</p><p>\u201cSo what, one night you ran up on a vampire or a demon in the park? You saw they were real and now you think you\u2019re some kind of hotshot who can go out and fight these things?\u201d</p><p>Not exactly.</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019ve got news for you.\u201d McNeal was glaring at him now, bushy brows lowered. \u201cThese things will eat you up and spit you out\u2014literally.\u201d</p><p>Not without a hell of a fight. \u201cI know what I\u2019m doing,\u201d Colin told him, struggling to keep his voice level. He didn\u2019t think the situation was a game, but he sure as hell wasn\u2019t about to reveal his true nature to the captain.</p><p>Been there, done that, with shit for results.</p><p>McNeal grunted and spun his chair to face the small window in his office. The captain didn\u2019t have much of a view. The window overlooked the back alley and two nearby buildings. But if you strained, you could just make out the green grass of the park in the distance.</p><p>\u201cHave you got a report yet from Smith?\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d been in the medical examiner\u2019s office all morning. \u201cShe\u2019s not done with the autopsy yet, but her preliminary judgment is that Preston Myers was attacked by an animal.\u201d</p><p>McNeal turned slowly back to face him. His fingers drummed on the arms of his chair. \u201cWe know that\u2019s not the case.\u201d</p><p>Yes, but proving it would be a whole different matter. \u201cShe thinks the vic was attacked by a dog or a wolf.\u201d Colin tossed a manila envelope onto McNeal\u2019s desk. \u201cBut judging by the bite radius, I\u2019d say it could just as easily have been a vampire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit.\u201d McNeal squeezed his eyes shut. \u201cWhy couldn\u2019t this asshole have stayed out of my town?\u201d He huffed out a breath, cracked open his eyes, and studied Colin. \u201cYou think Dr. Drake was right? You think this bastard will kill again?\u201d</p><p>Colin nodded. He had no doubt that the killer would strike again. The crime scene had been a bloodfest; that much rage, that much hate\u2014no one could stay in control with that dangerous mix brewing inside.</p><p>Yeah, he\u2019d kill again. Unless they stopped him.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s got the credentials,\u201d McNeal muttered. \u201cThe press will buy that we\u2019re bringing her on as a profiler.\u201d He leaned forward, grabbed a newspaper from the edge of his desk, and waved it in front of Colin. \u201cDid you see what those idiots printed today? The guy\u2019s had one kill and they\u2019ve already given him a name.\u201d</p><p>The black and white letters were stark: NIGHT BUTCHER CLAIMS VICTIM.</p><p>Oh Jesus. That was the last thing they needed. Night Butcher.</p><p>\u201cNo details of the body were released.\u201d McNeal tossed the paper into the trash. \u201cBut some jerkoff managed to peer into the house with one of those high-powered lenses, and he caught a shot of all the blood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s gonna like the name, you know,\u201d Colin warned. He\u2019d seen it before. Seen perps who got a high off the killing, but got an even bigger rush from the media attention that turned them into fucking celebrities.</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d McNeal\u2019s jaw clenched. \u201cAnd I also know we\u2019ve got jack for leads.\u201d</p><p>It was time to seal the deal. Colin leaned forward. \u201cThat\u2019s why we need the doc. She\u2019s been treating guys like him for years; she knows how they think. She can help us, I know she can.\u201d</p><p>The captain stiffened slightly. \u201cI don\u2019t think she\u2019s been seeing guys quite like this one.\u201d His lips thinned. \u201cI don\u2019t think the doctor makes a general practice of treating killers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but we both know who she does treat.\u201d</p><p>A reluctant nod. Then, \u201cHow do you know she\u2019ll even agree to this? Emily doesn\u2019t like attention, and when the press finds out, they\u2019ll splash her name on every page of their rags.\u201d</p><p>So she was Emily now. His eyes narrowed. There was familiarity there, a lot of it.</p><p>\u201cGet her permission, and we\u2019ll talk again\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve already gotten it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you now.\u201d Not a question. McNeal narrowed his eyes, and Colin realized he\u2019d just stepped on the captain\u2019s toes.</p><p>Shit. He spoke slowly, carefully, as he said, \u201cShe agreed Friday night. Before I went to you with this plan, I needed to make sure the doc would be onboard.\u201d And she\u2019d agreed. Now it was just up to McNeal.</p><p>McNeal stared at him in silence a moment, two, then finally nodded. \u201cWell, then I guess I\u2019d better make a few phone calls and get her officially attached to the case.\u201d He reached for his phone. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Colin took the hint. He rose, headed for the door, then paused, unable to contain his curiosity. \u201cCaptain, just how did you and Dr.</p><p>Drake meet?\u201d</p><p>The phone receiver was cradled at McNeal\u2019s ear. For a moment, his lips curved in a somewhat taunting smile. \u201cWhen you\u2019re ready to tell me your secrets, Detective, I\u2019ll tell you mine.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI want more than just sex.\u201d</p><p>Emily lifted a brow as she studied the succubus stretched out on her couch. \u201cAnd what exactly is it that you do want, Cara?\u201d</p><p>Cara pounded her small fist against the leather cushions. \u201cI want someone to want me, me! Not some hyped-up dream of a sex goddess!\u201d</p><p>Ah, now here was the tricky part. \u201cWell, umm, you know, you actually...are pretty close to being a sex goddess.\u201d A succubus was created to entice men, born with a high level of pheromones. Just the scent from one of Cara\u2019s kind had been known to drive mortal men wild with lust.</p><p>Of course, normally, the driving men wild with lust bit worked out well for the succubi. They derived a shot of magical power from the sex act. That power enabled them to alter their appearances, to live longer\u2014heck, most succubi thought it was a pretty good deal all around.</p> <p>Cara was definitely not like most succubi.</p><p>She sat up on the couch, pushing back her long, blond mane. \u201cI\u2019m tired of men looking at me and only wanting one thing.\u201d</p><p>Emily didn\u2019t speak. She\u2019d learned it was best sometimes to just sit back and let the patient talk.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m tired of random men, tired of guys who can\u2019t remember my name a week after we\u2019ve met.\u201d</p><p>Her brows wrinkled at that. What kind of moron would forget a woman as gorgeous as Cara?</p><p>\u201cI want someone who knows that I like sunsets, that I swim every morning before dawn, that I like damn blueberries on my pancakes\u2014\u201d Cara\u2019s face was starting to redden. \u201cDammit, I want someone to know me!\u201d</p> <p>And not just the sex goddess.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with me, Dr. Drake?\u201d Cara\u2019s hands balled into fists. \u201cI\u2019m not like the others, am I? They\u2019re all happy. My friends love the power they have over mortal men. They laugh about it, but I\u2014I\u2014\u201d She broke off, floundering. Then she swiped her hand under her left eye, rubbing away a lone tear that had fallen. \u201cShit, I guess I\u2019m just a freak.\u201d</p><p>Reaching for her tissue box, Emily said very softly, \u201cNo, you\u2019re not.\u201d She offered the tissue to Cara. \u201cYou just...\u201d Now here was the hard part. Cara might not be ready to hear it, but she needed to realize, \u201cYou just want someone to love you.\u201d</p><p>The tissue fell from Cara\u2019s fingers. \u201cBut men don\u2019t love women like me.\u201d</p><p>Cara had been coming to see her for nearly a month now. In that time, Emily had discovered that beneath the succubus\u2019s perfect exterior, there was a smart, kind, caring woman. A woman who\u2019d been born into a life that didn\u2019t necessarily match up with the person she was. And it was time Cara changed that life.</p><p>Men don\u2019t love women like me. Gazing straight into Cara\u2019s glistening blue eyes, Emily softly asked, \u201cDon\u2019t they?\u201d</p><p>Emily had just shown Cara Maloan out when her intercom beeped.</p><p>\u201cHey, boss, you got a call on line one.\u201d Vanessa whistled softly. \u201cA guy by the name of Colin Gyth. Very sexy voice.\u201d</p> <p>Colin Gyth. Emily hurried around her desk. \u201cAh, okay.\u201d It\u2019d been nearly three days since she\u2019d heard from Colin. Not that she\u2019d been counting or anything. \u201cPut him through.\u201d</p><p>Inhaling deeply, she waited a moment for the telltale click that signaled the call transfer. Then she picked up the handset. \u201cEmily Drake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi, Doc.\u201d</p><p>Heat bloomed between her thighs. Vanessa was right, the guy did have a sexy-as-sin voice. She\u2019d forgotten the deep timbre of his speech.</p><p>Damn. What was wrong with her? Was she honestly getting turned on just by Colin\u2019s voice?</p><p>Cara\u2019s problem is that she has too much sex in her life. Maybe my problem is that I don\u2019t have enough.</p><p>Maybe she\u2019d just been alone too long. What had it been? Five, six months since she\u2019d broken up with Travis? Or rather, since Travis had broken up with her.</p><p>I don\u2019t know you, Emily. You won\u2019t let me know you. And I\u2019m tired of ramming my head into a wall just because I want to get close to you.</p><p>She jerked off her glasses. That had been bad, very, very\u2014</p><p>\u201cUh, Doc? You there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, sorry, yes.\u201d Emily coughed. \u201cWhat can I do for you, Detective?\u201d She really, really hoped he hadn\u2019t just heard that little quiver of excitement in her voice. In talking with the guy for less than two minutes, she\u2019d gone from professional psychologist to needy woman.</p><p>Maybe she could use some therapy of her own.</p><p>There was a brief pause on the other end of the line, then Gyth\u2019s deep voice announced, \u201cYou can tell me that you meant it when you said you\u2019d help out on this case.\u201d</p><p>Now that got her attention. Her back snapped straight. \u201cYes, yes, of course, I meant it.\u201d He was calling about business. Time for the professional psychologist to get her ass in gear.</p><p>\u201cGood, cause the big boys just gave me the go-ahead to bring you in as a profiler.\u201d</p><p>A profiler. Her fingers tightened around the phone. Working a murder investigation.</p><p>\u201cThe press is already crawling all over this case. Once you\u2019re officially in, they\u2019ll get your name.\u201d He sighed, then said, \u201cSo prepare to start seeing a lot of yourself on the six o\u2019clock news.\u201d</p><p>For a moment, she hesitated. She hadn\u2019t given a thought to the press. Hadn\u2019t even considered that they\u2019d learn of her. \u201cCan\u2019t we keep my involvement quiet for now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe DA wants to make sure the public feels like we\u2019re doing everything possible to catch this guy. He wants to release data about our profiler to make everyone feel better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cO-okay.\u201d Surely there was no way that anyone would discover her past. It had been so many years since\u2014</p><p>\u201cRelax, Doc, dealing with the press will be the easy part. Catching the killer, that\u2019s the challenge.\u201d There was a rumble of voices in the background, then he asked, \u201cHey, when are you gonna be free this afternoon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m free now.\u201d Maloan had been her last patient of the day. No night clients were scheduled.</p><p>\u201cGood. I\u2019ll be there in twenty minutes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwenty minutes? But\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou need to start on the profile, right? Well, I\u2019ll take you back to the crime scene, then you can come meet Smith.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSmith?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe medical examiner.\u201d</p><p>Oh. Her stomach tightened. She didn\u2019t have a good track record with MEs.</p><p>He laughed softly. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, Doc. I\u2019ll be with you every step of the way.\u201d</p><p>Not exactly reassuring.</p><p>A thin line of yellow police tape blocked the door at 208 Byron Street. Colin pulled out a knife, slashed through it, and opened the door.</p><p>The smell hit her when she stepped inside. The stale, cold odor of death. The coppery scent of blood.</p><p>Emily swallowed. The house was dark. Shadows loomed across the floor. \u201cCan you do something about the lights?\u201d</p><p>He tapped a button on the wall. Light flooded the foyer and the den.</p><p>She inched forward, keeping her attention on the ground. Colin had told her that the killer had entered through the front door. So he\u2019d come this way, walking slowly, carefully into the house.</p><p>The thick carpet swallowed her footsteps as she entered the den. The killer had crept into this room, found Preston Myers. And attacked him.</p><p>The stark outline of Preston\u2019s body still marked the floor. The stain of his blood covered the brown carpet.</p><p>Her gaze rose to the nearby wall. Dried blood marred the surface. So much blood.</p><p>\u201cThis guy was in a fury,\u201d she murmured, bending to inspect the carpet. Her hand lifted over the outline, hesitated.</p><p>\u201cIs this your first murder, Doc?\u201d</p><p>She hadn\u2019t heard his approach but wasn\u2019t really surprised to hear his voice sounded from right behind her. Shifters often made no sound when they moved.</p><p>Her fingers were trembling. She balled her hand into a fist and glanced back at him. \u201cYes.\u201d But not her first blood soaked scene.</p><p>For an instant, her mind flashed back to that last bloody room. She saw the man\u2019s body, slumped on the floor. His brains and tissue were on the wall, blood surrounding him.</p><p>Her father\u2019s death hadn\u2019t been pretty, and sometimes, late at night, she still woke up screaming.</p><p>Emily drew in a deep breath. She had to focus on Preston, not the past.</p><p>Standing, her stare swept the room, lingered on the pictures decorating the mantel, on the chess set in the corner, on the books lining the built-in shelves near the doorway.</p><p>From all appearances, Preston Myers had been a normal guy. Completely human.</p><p>So why had he been attacked? Why had the killer chosen him?</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t make sense,\u201d she muttered. \u201cSBs stick to their own kind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh...SBs?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSupernatural beings.\u201d In her experience, SBs always stayed with their own for mating, for fun, and for killing.</p><p>To cross over like this and to murder a human, to so blatantly attack\u2014</p><p>Her gaze narrowed as she glimpsed a familiar face in one of the photos.</p><p>Hell.</p><p>She marched closer to the mantel. Snatched up the picture.</p><p>\u201cHey, Doc, what\u2019s\u2014\u201d</p><p>Her fingers tightened around the small frame. \u201cHave you run a background check on Preston yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy partner\u2019s working on it.\u201d His eyes narrowed. \u201cWhy, Doc? What do you know?\u201d</p><p>She held up the picture. \u201cI know that one of the guys in this picture is a demon.\u201d</p><p>One black brow shot up. \u201cA patient?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She would never have agreed to treat Niol. The guy gave off black waves of energy that made her far, far too nervous. Her nail tapped just over Niol\u2019s unsmiling face. \u201cBut I\u2019ve met him a few times. He owns a bar near here, a place called Paradise Found.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I guess I\u2019ll be paying him a visit.\u201d He smiled at her. \u201cGood thing I brought you over. You might not have gotten any more details about the killer, but you sure did just speed up the\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I know more about the killer,\u201d she interrupted, frowning at him, feeling slightly insulted. What did he think she\u2019d been doing?</p><p>Daydreaming over a dead body?</p><p>He pulled out his notebook. \u201cThen tell me.\u201d</p><p>Emily licked her lips. \u201cThis wasn\u2019t an impulse kill. Nothing\u2019s disturbed. Nothing\u2019s taken. The guy came to the house with the attack already planned out. He knew where the security cameras were, and he knew how to hide from them. That probably means he\u2019s been here before, that he knew the victim.\u201d</p><p>She pointed to the blood on the wall. \u201cWhen there is this much violence, this much rage, it\u2019s usually very, very personal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I figured that.\u201d So far, Colin wasn\u2019t sounding particularly impressed.</p><p>She dropped her hand, squared her shoulders as she faced him. \u201cThe killer had to be strong to overpower Preston. The victim was what, six foot two? One hundred eighty pounds? He would have fought back, would have fought as hard as he could.\u201d Her lips tightened for a moment. \u201cBut then, supernaturals are always stronger than humans, aren\u2019t they? Preston never had a chance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Colin agreed, his voice quiet. \u201cHe didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>When they left the house, they found a reporter waiting for them. A blond woman with close-cropped hair stood on the walkway, a black microphone clutched in her hands. A cameraman stood behind her, his face partially obscured by the bulk of his equipment.</p><p>\u201cDetective Gyth!\u201d The woman\u2019s face lit with hungry enthusiasm. \u201cDarla Mitchell, News Flash Five. I have a few questions for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit.\u201d The word was a bare breath of sound, but it reached Emily\u2019s ears, and for a second, she almost smiled at the disgust she heard.</p><p>But then Darla shoved the microphone into her face. \u201cDr. Drake, my sources say that you\u2019ve joined this case as a profiler.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh...\u201d Her sources? She\u2019d been on the case for less than an hour. How had the woman already found out about her?</p><p>Colin stepped in front of Emily. \u201cThe Atlanta PD has no comment at this time.\u201d</p><p>Darla tried to squirm around him. \u201cBut what about Dr. Drake? Does she have\u2014\u201d</p><p>Colin grabbed the bobbing microphone, leaned close, and snapped, \u201cNo comment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine!\u201d Darla snarled. \u201cCut it, Jake!\u201d</p><p>Emily stepped to Colin\u2019s side just as Jake lowered the camera.</p><p>A hard glare twisted Darla\u2019s pretty face. \u201cYou can\u2019t keep information from the public forever, you know, Gyth!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen I have information, I\u2019ll give it to you.\u201d He smiled. Okay, well, he flashed a lot of teeth. Not really a smile so much as a baring of fangs.</p><p>Darla growled at him, then spun on her two-inch heels and stomped back to the News Flash Five van.</p><p>The cameraman studied Gyth and Emily. Then he sighed. \u201cShe\u2019s been pissed since Channel Three scooped her on the Butcher story.\u201d His eyes narrowed on Emily. \u201cDr. Drake...I\u2019ve heard a lot about you.\u201d</p><p>A tingle of awareness skated down her spine as she stared into his golden eyes.</p><p>He was Other.</p><p>He smiled at her, and for just a second, his eyes shifted, the gold changed into a midnight black.</p><p>Demon eyes. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She felt his power in the air then. Weak, low-level power, maybe a two or three on the demon scale.</p><p>\u201cIf there\u2019s anything I can do for you, Doctor, or if you decide that you want to talk to News Flash Five, give me a call.\u201d He handed her his card.</p><p>\u201cJake!\u201d</p> <p>Sighing, he glanced back over his shoulder. Darla stood beside the van, arms crossed, eyes glittering.</p><p>\u201cWell, guess I\u2019ll talk to you both another time.\u201d With a little salute, he hoisted the camera and hurried toward the van.</p><p>\u201cLooks like the vultures have already started circling.\u201d Colin shook his head and marched down the sidewalk.</p><p>She followed on his heels. \u201cGyth, did you know they were going to be here?\u201d</p><p>He jerked open her door, narrowing his eyes. \u201cNo.\u201d Then comprehension lit his face. \u201cWhat, you think I brought you here as some kind of setup?\u201d</p> <p>Well, the thought had crossed her mind. \u201cYou said I\u2019d be on the six o\u2019clock news soon. Looks like you were right.\u201d</p><p>His fingers tightened around the metal door. \u201cI said you\u2019d be on the news because the DA is going to hold a press conference about the case in the next few days. You\u2019ll be at the conference.\u201d</p><p>Emily climbed into the Jeep. \u201cSo, for the record, you didn\u2019t know Darla was going to be here?\u201d</p><p>He slammed the door. \u201cNo, I sure as hell didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>She blew out a hard breath as he circled the Jeep and jumped into the driver\u2019s seat.</p><p>\u201cAnd just so you know, Doc, you aren\u2019t to talk to reporters alone, ever.\u201d He slanted her a simmering glare. \u201cSo you might as well just throw away the card that slick passed you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI think I\u2019ll just hold on to it.\u201d It wasn\u2019t the first time that one of the Other had passed a card to her as a signal that he wanted something.</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d He cranked the engine, sending the vehicle roaring to life.</p><p>Emily glanced down at the card in her hands. JAKE DONNELLEY, CAMERAMAN, NEWS FLASH FIVE. His contact information was in clear, bold letters at the bottom.</p><p>She flipped the card over.</p><p>Have information on the case. Meet me at Paradise Found. 10 P.M.</p><p>\u201cAh, Gyth?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d He braked at a traffic light and glanced her way.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think that guy wants to ask me questions.\u201d Holding up the card, she showed him the note.</p> <p>His brows snapped together. \u201cWhat in the hell?\u201d</p><p>A horn blared behind them. Colin swore and stomped on the gas.</p><p>No, Jake doesn\u2019t want to ask her questions. But it sure looks like he might have a few things to tell her.</p><p>Colin turned into the parking lot of an old convenience store, braked, and spun to confront her. \u201cLet me see that card.\u201d</p><p>This time, she handed it over.</p><p>He whistled soundlessly. \u201cSonofabitch.\u201d His gaze rose to capture hers. \u201cWhy\u2019d he give this to you?\u201d Suspicion laced his words.</p><p>She glanced away, shrugged.</p><p>\u201cEmily...\u201d</p><p>She jerked. He\u2019d never called her Emily before. Usually, he just called her Doc in that slightly mocking drawl of his. Hearing her name on his lips now seemed strangely intimate.</p><p>\u201cWhy\u2019d the guy give you the card instead of me?\u201d</p><p>Her lips parted\u2014</p><p>\u201cShit.\u201d His fist rapped against the steering wheel. \u201cThe guy\u2019s Other, isn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d There didn\u2019t seem to be much point in denying it.</p><p>\u201cSo what is he? Shifter? Warlock? Psychic?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a demon.\u201d Most people didn\u2019t really understand demons. They thought demons were servants of the devil\u2014evil, winged creatures with tails and talons. But the truth was that demons were a whole other race of humans, possibly descended from the original Fallen. On the outside, demons looked just like humans, except for one small detail: the eyes. All demons had completely black eyes. Cornea, lens, retina\u2014everything was black.</p><p>But although the demons looked like humans, they were incredibly different. Most demons had psychic powers. Some were amazingly strong, while others were barely gifted. But even those with the light touch of the gift were able to cloak their eye color so humans would not see them for what they really were.</p><p>Emily\u2019s extrasensory power let her see past the glamour, let her see past the magic to the true nature of the creatures. She usually kept her mental shields up around them, though, because she\u2019d once made the mistake of going up against a level-nine demon. The guy had nearly blasted her into a coma.</p><p>Before she\u2019d passed out and slammed face-first into the floor, she\u2019d managed to fight back and burn out the guy\u2019s magic.</p><p>Turnabout could be a real bitch...as the demon had learned.</p><p>\u201cA demon,\u201d Colin repeated softly. \u201cLike that guy you mentioned, Niol?\u201d</p><p>No, she didn\u2019t think Jake was like Niol at all. She hadn\u2019t sensed any evil in Jake.</p><p>Like people, some demons were good and some were evil. The demons who were good, well, they tended to keep to themselves.</p><p>But the ones who were evil\u2014those were the bad-asses people knew from history, the ones who\u2019d first made folks think they were servants of the devil.</p><p>A demon who had incredible power and no conscience, well, he was truly a being to fear.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think he\u2019s like Niol,\u201d she told him softly.</p><p>Colin tucked the card into his pocket. His eyes remained locked on hers. \u201cAnd how do you know that?\u201d</p><p>Time to lay her cards on the table. \u201cBecause I\u2019d feel it if he were.\u201d Sure, she hadn\u2019t gone shieldless with the guy to get a full mind probe, but she also hadn\u2019t sensed any of the dark, seething black power in the air that usually signaled a dangerous demon.</p><p>He seemed to stiffen before her. \u201cFeel it? How?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m an empath, Colin. My gift is that I sense things. I sense the Other. I can sense their feelings, their thoughts.\u201d</p><p>Yeah, he\u2019d definitely tensed up on her. \u201cYou\u2019re telling me that you can read my thoughts?\u201d</p><p>The temperature seemed to drop about ten degrees. \u201cI\u2019m telling you that sometimes I can tell the thoughts of supernaturals.\u201d She\u2019d known he wouldn\u2019t be thrilled by this news; that was why she hadn\u2019t told him the full truth the other night. But now that they were working together, now that her talent was coming into play, well, she figured he had the right to know.</p><p>Colin grabbed her arms, jerked her forward against his chest. \u201cSo this whole time, you\u2019ve been playing with me.\u201d</p><p>The sharp edge of his canines gleamed behind his lips. \u201cNo, Colin, it\u2019s not like that\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been looking into my head and seeing how much I want you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cColin, no, I\u2014\u201d Seeing how much I want you. Had he really just said that?</p><p>His cheeks flushed. \u201cWhile I tried to play the dumb-ass gentleman.\u201d</p><p>Since when?</p><p>\u201cWell, screw that.\u201d His lips were right over hers, his fingers tight on her arms. \u201cIf you\u2019ve been in my head, then you know what I want to do to you.\u201d</p><p>Uh, no, she didn\u2019t. Her shields had been firmly in place with him all day. Her heart was pounding so fast now, the dull drumming filled her ears. She licked her lips, tried once more to tell him the truth. \u201cIt\u2019s not like that\u2014\u201d</p><p>Too late. His mouth claimed hers, swallowing her words and igniting the hungry desire she\u2019d been trying so hard to fight.</p><p>Chapter 4</p><p>Damn, but the doc tasted good. Colin thrust his tongue past her soft lips, loving the feel of her mouth against his.</p><p>His cock was hard for her, arousal pumping heavily through his body. Her scent surrounded him, and the warm weight of her body pushed against him.</p><p>His fingers tangled in her hair, tangled in that bun that had been driving him crazy, and he pulled the silken strands free. And he kept kissing her, kept tasting her, thrusting his tongue deep.</p><p>The beast within him began to roar as his hunger built. Higher, higher...</p><p>Colin shifted, trying to get closer to her. His knee rammed into the gearshift, but he truly didn\u2019t give a fuck. Her breasts pressed against his chest, the nipples tight. She wanted him.</p><p>Good, because he was going crazy wanting her.</p><p>And she knew it. She\u2019d been in his head, stealing his thoughts, seeing how badly he wanted her.</p><p>Christ, what was it about her? Every time he was near her, his body went into overdrive, and he needed\u2014he needed\u2014</p><p>Her.</p><p>The lust he felt mixed with the anger simmering in his veins. His lips grew rougher on hers. A faint moan trembled in her throat, but she didn\u2019t fight him. Her small hands lifted, wrapped around his shoulders.</p><p>Elation surged through him. His right hand lowered, slid down her body, and pressed against the curve of her breast. His fingers stroked her, cupped the warm weight of her flesh.</p><p>Emily shuddered against him, and the rich scent of her arousal filled the air.</p><p>Colin realized he was seconds away from taking her, there, in the car, with an abandoned store behind them and a road full of cars in front of them.</p><p>What in the hell was wrong with him?</p><p>Slowly, he lifted his head. Emily\u2019s breath was panting out, her bow lips reddened and wet from his mouth. He licked his lips, and he still tasted her.</p><p>Shit. He was in trouble. Serious trouble.</p><p>Her hair had fallen around her shoulders. Dark as night. Straight and silky. Her glasses were tilted slightly on her nose, and she looked so sexy it took all of his control not to kiss her again.</p><p>Down, boy. Now wasn\u2019t the time. Later he\u2019d get the doc alone, and he\u2019d get his fill of her.</p><p>His kind were notoriously sexual. He\u2019d never found a partner to match his needs, but the doc, well, maybe she\u2019d prove to be the exception. Course, he\u2019d have to break her in easy, get her used to him, then he could let his full hunger reign.</p><p>\u201cSo what am I thinking now, Doc?\u201d That I can\u2019t wait to get you naked. To have you beneath me, screaming my name as you climax.</p><p>Emily blinked, took a deep breath, and seemed to realize that she was still clutching his shoulders. She dropped her hands, then jerked back against her seat. \u201cTh-that shouldn\u2019t have\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt happened.\u201d He stared at her. Watched as she tried to finger-brush her hair. \u201cAnd it\u2019s gonna happen again.\u201d He\u2019d gotten his second taste of her, and he was even hungrier now. No way was he going to walk away from her.</p><p>But she was shaking her head. \u201cWe\u2019re going to work together, we can\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, we can.\u201d His fingers lifted, brushed back a lock of her hair. He didn\u2019t care about the dumb-ass rule of mixing business and pleasure. So they were working together on the case. Big damn deal. Just made it easier for him to see her.</p><p>Emily stiffened.</p><p>\u201cSo tell me, Doc, what am I thinking now?\u201d His voice was a whisper and his stare dropped to her shirtfront. Her nipples were pushing against the fabric. He wanted them in his mouth.</p><p>\u201cI-I don\u2019t know.\u201d Her hands were tight fists in her lap. \u201cI tried to tell you earlier, I don\u2019t usually jump in someone\u2019s head without permission.\u201d</p><p>Ah, so the lady had a no-peeking policy, huh? Some of the tension within him began to ease, and with an effort, he managed to lift his gaze back to her face. \u201cYou\u2019re telling me you\u2019ve never used your gift on me?\u201d That would make things so much easier.</p><p>Emily looked away.</p><p>Ah, shit. \u201cDoc?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnce, okay?\u201d Her head snapped toward him and her green eyes glittered. \u201cWhen you came to my house that night. But it wasn\u2019t deliberate. You were projecting, blasting me with your memories. I jerked up my shields as soon as I could.\u201d</p><p>Blasting me with your memories. \u201cWhat memories?\u201d His back teeth clenched as he gritted, \u201cJust what did you see?\u201d</p><p>For a moment, she was silent. Then, \u201cYou. You were shot, bleeding.\u201d</p><p>His right shoulder ached at the memory of the pain. \u201cWhat else?\u201d Cause he knew there was something else. The doc still wasn\u2019t looking him in the eyes.</p><p>\u201cA fire.\u201d</p><p>He tensed. \u201cWhat about the fire?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook, I just saw a house on fire, okay? You were there, looking up at this big, white house that was being eaten by flames.\u201d</p><p>The flames had burned so brightly that night. Orange flames. Hotter than hell. And so hungry. They\u2019d destroyed the house and everything inside.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to worry,\u201d Emily muttered, pushing back her glasses. \u201cI\u2019m not going to deliberately look into your head.\u201d</p><p>Well, that was reassuring. But...\u201cWhy not, Doc? Did you try that before on someone and find out more than you bargained for?\u201d</p><p>Had she probed a lover\u2019s mind only to discover the man wasn\u2019t as she\u2019d thought?</p><p>\u201cYou could say that.\u201d Her lips turned down. \u201cThe guy nearly put me in a coma.\u201d</p><p>What?</p><p>\u201cI was eighteen, hanging in the wrong place with the wrong guy. I thought I knew him, that I could trust him. So I lowered my guard, and I found out that I\u2019d been dead wrong about him from the beginning.\u201d She exhaled. \u201cAfter that, I decided it\u2019d be a hell of a lot safer for me to make absolutely certain that my shields were in place. I probe the thoughts of my patients\u2014and only my patients.\u201d</p><p>When he opened his mouth to question her, she said, \u201cThey give me their permission. I never touch thoughts without permission.\u201d</p><p>Her mouth tightened and she said, \u201cUnless somebody\u2019s projecting so loudly I can\u2019t shut them out.\u201d</p><p>Like he\u2019d been doing. He huffed out a hard breath. Good thing there weren\u2019t any other folks like the doc running around Atlanta. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Otherwise, he\u2019d be screwed.</p><p>\u201cAnd I never lower my shields all the way,\u201d Emily spoke again, her voice softer now. \u201cI always keep some protection in place.\u201d</p><p>Colin grunted and cranked the Jeep. He wanted to ask Emily more about the coma, ask her about the guy who\u2019d nearly put her under, but he figured he\u2019d pushed enough for one day.</p> <p>Besides, he needed to get her to the station. They needed to talk to Smith, needed to find out if the ME had gotten any more information for them.</p><p>After they talked to Smith, he\u2019d drop the doc off at her place. Then he\u2019d go meet the cameraman. And he\u2019d find out exactly what Jake Donnelley knew about his case.</p><p>\u201cUh, aren\u2019t you forgetting something?\u201d</p><p>He glanced at her. Found her eyes narrowed on him. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>Her lips thinned. \u201cAn apology.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAh, Doc, you don\u2019t have to apologize to me. I understand now.\u201d She wasn\u2019t jumping in his brain. As far as he could tell, she still didn\u2019t know the full truth about him, and that was very good news. \u201cJust stay out of my head, and we\u2019ll get along just fine.\u201d More than fine if he had his way. In fact, they\u2019d be\u2014</p><p>The doc growled. Actually growled. Oh, he liked that. The beast within emitted a hungry growl of its own.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not talking about me giving you an apology,\u201d she snapped. \u201cI meant you owe me an apology.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat would I owe you an apology for?\u201d He hadn\u2019t jumped in her head.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t remember asking you to\u2014to\u2014\u201d The doc broke off, flushing.</p><p>And the light dawned. He hadn\u2019t jumped into her head, but he\u2019d jumped her.</p> <p>\u201cI told you before, Gyth.\u201d That pointed chin lifted and she stared straight at him, even as a blush stained her cheeks. \u201cIf I want you to kiss me, I\u2019ll ask.\u201d</p><p>Ah, yes, the doc wasn\u2019t a fan of\u2014 what had she called it?\u2014 the He-man routine. Well, if the lady wanted an apology...\u201cSorry, Doc, guess my basic nature just got the best of me.\u201d His basic nature, his anger, and the hard lust he seemed to feel every time he got near her.</p><p>\u201cYes, well, shifters are reputed to be highly volatile and, umm\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSexual?\u201d</p><p>She blinked.</p><p>\u201cYeah, we are.\u201d Unfortunately, most shifters tended to be male, so it wasn\u2019t like there were a ton of like-minded women strolling the streets.</p><p>But when he\u2019d held the doc, for a bit there, \u201cIt seemed like your basic nature took control, too, huh?\u201d She\u2019d been kissing him back, rubbing that sweet little pink tongue of hers against his, pushing her body against him, clutching him tightly with her hands.</p><p>\u201cMaybe it did,\u201d Emily said softly, and his respect for her shot up. A woman who could admit her need\u2014just what he wanted.</p> <p>He wished they didn\u2019t have to go back to the station. Wished they could just keep driving, preferably back to his place so that he could find out more about Emily\u2019s needs.</p><p>Even though he could still taste her, he knew his lust would have to wait.</p><p>The case came first. It had to. But once the killer was caught, oh yeah, once the killer was tossed in a dark cell to never see the light of day again, then he could focus completely on Emily.</p><p>In the meantime, he\u2019d keep mixing his business and pleasure every damn chance he got.</p><p>She wanted Colin Gyth. Wanted a shifter. All right, she could admit it.</p><p>Emily hurried to keep pace beside Colin as they maneuvered through the police station. A few officers called out greetings to Gyth as they passed. He didn\u2019t stop for anyone, just kept walking with that I\u2019m-a-bad-ass stride of his. She was having to double-time it to keep up with him.</p><p>He pushed open a door leading to a stairwell. A dark, narrow stairwell.</p><p>\u201cLadies first,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d She brushed past him, and his scent\u2014the warm, rich scent of masculine flesh\u2014teased her nostrils.</p><p>Her heart beat faster, her breath hitched.</p><p>Oh yes, she had a serious problem where the detective was concerned.</p><p>So what was she going to do about it? About him?</p><p>The stairs ended in front of a rust-colored door. Emily knew what waited for her on the other side of that door.</p><p>It was time to stop fantasizing about the detective and get to work.</p><p>Straightening her shoulders, she pushed open the door and began to walk across the shining white tile. Her high heels tapped lightly against the floor.</p><p>Colin pointed to another door. A metallic door with a narrow strip of a window.</p><p>\u201cGo on, Doc. Smith\u2019s waiting.\u201d</p><p>She stepped inside.</p><p>Damn, but she hated that smell. It had been seven years since she\u2019d been inside a morgue. But the place still smelled the same.</p><p>Emily inhaled and tried to control an automatic gag impulse. God, the place reeked. Chemicals. Bleach. Decay. The scents of death.</p><p>Fluorescent bulbs glowed overhead, revealing the stark environment of the morgue. A small desk sat in the far corner. A covered body rested on a table. And a shining tray of sharp instruments stood waiting near the body.</p><p>\u201cHey, Gyth, couldn\u2019t wait any longer, huh?\u201d A tall, thin, incredibly gorgeous black woman stepped from behind a row of filing cabinets. Her hands were covered in white, latex gloves and a blue face mask dangled around her neck.</p><p>\u201cHi, Smith.\u201d He flashed her a smile. \u201cYou know, it\u2019s been at least\u201d\u2014he glanced down at his watch\u2014\u201cfive hours since I\u2019ve been down here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmmm.\u201d Smith didn\u2019t smile back at him, and she didn\u2019t sound too happy. Her gaze drifted to Emily. \u201cAnd you\u2019ve brought company.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is Dr. Emily Drake. She\u2019s profiling the Myers case.\u201d</p><p>Smith nodded. She held out her hand, and a smile finally curved her full lips. \u201cNice to meet you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, you, too.\u201d This was the ME? The woman could have been a double for Tyra Banks.</p><p>Smith\u2019s smile dimmed a bit as she turned her attention back to Gyth. \u201cSeriously, you need to stop harassing me about this case. I\u2019m working on the body as fast as I can. Myers wasn\u2019t the only guy to get murdered lately, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but he was the only one killed by the Night Butcher.\u201d</p><p>Her jaw dropped. \u201cThe what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Night\u2014\u201d</p><p>Smith held up her hand. \u201cI heard you. Jesus, you mean the press has already named this guy?\u201d</p><p>Colin nodded. His hand came to rest at the small of Emily\u2019s back and he gently pushed her forward.</p><p>She could feel the warm weight of his touch through her shirt. She stiffened, trying to ease away from the strong press of his fingers.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t guys like him usually have to kill a couple of times before they get nicknames?\u201d Smith shook her head. \u201cHe could be a one-hit wonder, right, Dr. Drake?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, maybe.\u201d But she really doubted it.</p><p>Smith\u2019s dark eyes narrowed. \u201cYou think this guy\u2019s a serial?\u201d</p><p>Not in the strictest sense of the word. The rules for serial killers didn\u2019t really apply to the Other when they crossed that thin line that separated right and wrong for them. \u201cI want to study the case more before I make a determination of that.\u201d Nice, safe answer.</p><p>\u201cNight Butcher.\u201d Smith muttered the name again, shaking her head. \u201cWhat a dumb-ass name.\u201d She headed for the gurney, the gurney that held a body covered with a thin white sheet. \u201cThe poor SOB wasn\u2019t butchered. He was bitten, clawed.\u201d</p><p>Emily lowered the shield in her mind just a bit. She wasn\u2019t sensing any supernatural powers from the doctor, but on this case, she didn\u2019t want to take any chances.</p><p>She felt the whip of Colin\u2019s shifter life force against her, but as for Smith...</p><p>Nothing.</p><p>The ME was completely human. Not even a half or a quarter breed.</p><p>That meant they needed to handle this case very, very carefully.</p><p>\u201cYou said he was bitten?\u201d Emily questioned as she stepped toward the covered body. \u201cYou mean the killer showed cannibalistic tendencies toward the victim?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe guy wasn\u2019t eaten,\u201d Smith said, tapping her gloved fingers against the sheet. \u201cBut there were marks on the throat, like the attacker bit him. Bit his throat half open and then clawed it the rest of the way.\u201d</p><p>Oh, not a good visual. Unfortunately, it was exactly what had happened. The image of Preston\u2019s dead body flashed before her eyes.</p><p>Vamps and shifters had never been known to eat prey. Drink blood, yes, but actually eating human prey? She\u2019d known only a few demons who indulged in consuming flesh.</p><p>\u201cA man didn\u2019t do that.\u201d Smith stopped her tapping and looked straight at Gyth. \u201cNo man could have done that.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t say a word.</p><p>So Emily had to take the ball. \u201cThen what do you think attacked Preston Myers?\u201d</p><p>Smith\u2019s midnight-black gaze never left Colin. \u201cI think it was a large dog, maybe a wolf.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cYou know that\u2019s not possible, Smith. The cameras\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know! Dammit!\u201d She jerked the mask off her neck and tossed it into the garbage. \u201cBut nothing else makes sense. I found animal hairs on the vic. I sent them off for analysis. We should have a full match on them soon. The bite radius on the vic\u2019s neck\u2014there\u2019s no way that came from a human mouth. And the lacerations\u2014\u201d She paused, shook her head, \u201cThey don\u2019t fit the profile of knife wounds or ice picks. They\u2019re jagged, deep as hell.\u201d</p><p>A wolf shifter had powerful, deadly claws. Far longer and stronger than a normal wolf\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cThis is the weirdest damn case I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d Smith turned her attention back to Emily. \u201cAnd I\u2019ll sure be interested in finding out exactly what you think about this killer.\u201d</p><p>Well, Smith wasn\u2019t going to be among the select few who got to view her full report. Emily knew Danny would want her data to go to his select superiors\u2014the superiors who he knew would \u201cunderstand\u201d the special details of the case.</p><p>Smith pulled off her gloves and held her hand out to Emily. I\u2019m glad Gyth brought you on the case, Dr. Drake. I sure hope you can catch this bastard.\u201d</p><p>Emily\u2019s hand met hers. \u201cYeah, me, too.\u201d She cleared her throat, glanced back at Colin. \u201cIs there an office I can use here? I want to start going over the files.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, we\u2019ve got a place for you.\u201d He jerked his thumb toward the door. \u201cCome on, I\u2019ll show you. It\u2019s barely bigger than a closet, but that\u2019s the way all the offices are in this place.\u201d</p><p>Nodding to Smith, Emily stepped back. \u201cGood to meet you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSame here.\u201d The ME watched her as she crossed the room. Just as Emily stepped over the threshold, Smith called out, \u201cDr.</p><p>Drake, just one question.\u201d</p><p>Emily glanced back. Beside her, Colin seemed to tense. \u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t seem particularly surprised to hear about the animal hairs on the vic.\u201d Her head cocked to the side. \u201cWhy is that?\u201d</p><p>Suspicion was rich in her voice.</p><p>Emily hesitated.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d already told her,\u201d Colin said, shrugging casually. \u201cI mentioned that bit about the dog or wolf hair on the ride over.\u201d He flashed her a smile. \u201cSorry to steal your thunder, Smith.\u201d</p><p>The ME\u2019s shoulders relaxed. \u201cAh, it\u2019s okay, Gyth.\u201d She laughed softly, the sound a little rusty, and she admitted, \u201cI was worried there for a minute, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWorried? Why?\u201d He asked.</p><p>Smith didn\u2019t look at Emily as she said, \u201cI thought the doctor might know more about the perp than she was letting on.\u201d</p><p>Yes, that was the truth. Emily tried a smile of her own, but her lips felt stiff, the movement too false. \u201cI just have suspicions at this point, Smith. Nothing more.\u201d</p><p>She glanced down at her watch. Five o\u2019clock. There was time to start reviewing the case files, time to get more than just suspicions before she had to meet Jake.</p><p>Time to start tracking the shifter.</p><p>The woman had been huddled in the shoebox-sized office for the last three hours. He could see straight through the windowed walls, could see right inside to her hunched figure.</p><p>The doc was poring over the files. Crime scene photos were spread on the table before her. Typed notes lay to her side.</p><p>She was tapping a pen against her lips as she read, tapping, tapping...</p><p>\u201cWell, well, is that her?\u201d</p><p>The gravelly voice sounded at his side. Colin didn\u2019t bother glancing to his left. He\u2019d know that broken drawl anywhere.</p><p>His partner was back.</p><p>\u201cYeah, that\u2019s her.\u201d She pushed the notes aside, reached for a photo. Held it up, stared.</p><p>\u201cHmmm. Kinda pretty.\u201d A chair shrieked a protest as Todd Brooks sat down.</p><p>Colin swiveled his chair very slowly to face him. Todd was the pretty-boy of the precinct. Brown hair perfectly cut. Too perfect teeth. And big, brown, You-Can-Trust-Me eyes that he\u2019d used on more than his share of suspects.</p><p>The idiots couldn\u2019t trust him, but they never realized that fact until it was too late.</p><p>Brooks reeled \u2019em in, convinced them he was their best friend. He got their confessions, then those eyes lost their warmth.</p><p>And the real man began to show.</p><p>Normally, Colin almost liked the guy. Todd didn\u2019t ask stupid questions, he minded his own business, and he was a damn good shot.</p><p>The guy was also a notorious ladies\u2019 man. He\u2019d slept with nearly every female cop in the precinct.</p><p>But he\u2019d sure as hell better not be planning on letting his gaze drift to the doc.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s off-limits, Brooks.\u201d Better to go ahead and make that clear. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>His partner just shrugged. \u201cSo she\u2019s working the case. Big deal. We can still\u2014\u201d</p><p>Colin leaned forward. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t think you get it. She\u2019s off-limits. \u201d</p><p>Those puppy-dog eyes blinked, and the light seemed to dawn. \u201cAh, got her marked already, huh, partner?\u201d</p> <p>No, he hadn\u2019t marked her. Not yet. That would come later. Shifters always marked their mates.</p><p>Colin stiffened. Where the hell had that thought come from? The doc was not his mate.</p><p>Sure, he wanted to have sex with her, wanted it damn bad, but she was not his mate.</p><p>No fucking way.</p><p>\u201cPity.\u201d Todd\u2019s brown eyes drifted past Colin\u2019s shoulders. \u201cI sure would have liked to have gotten her on my couch.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cStop thinking with your dick, Brooks.\u201d Captain McNeal stood behind him, his brows beetled low.</p><p>Brooks clenched his jaw. Then lifted one brow. \u201cYou knew he was there, didn\u2019t ya?\u201d His voice was whisper soft.</p><p>\u201cHell, yeah.\u201d He didn\u2019t bother lowering his voice. His gaze lifted to meet the captain\u2019s. \u201cHaving a late night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was waiting to talk to Dr. Drake.\u201d When Brooks turned to face him, McNeal shoved his index finger into his chest. \u201cDon\u2019t screw around with the doctor, Detective. We need her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not the one you\u2019ve got to worry about,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that supposed to\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCaptain McNeal? Gyth? May I speak with you both?\u201d Emily asked, her seductive voice cutting straight through the rumble of noise in the precinct.</p><p>\u201cAh, sure, Em\u2014Dr. Drake.\u201d McNeal nodded to her but stabbed his finger against Brooks\u2019s chest once more. \u201cDon\u2019t mess with her.\u201d</p><p>The captain pushed past him and Brooks exhaled heavily. Then he took a step forward. \u201cHey, I should hear what she\u2019s got to say, too.\u201d</p><p>McNeal didn\u2019t glance back at him. \u201cColin will brief you tomorrow. Go home, Brooks.\u201d</p><p>Colin easily read the disbelief on his partner\u2019s face. This was not the way things were usually handled at the PD. \u201cWhat? But I\u2019m assigned to this case, I need to know\u2014\u201d</p><p>McNeal stopped, turned slowly to face the angry detective. \u201cYou need to know what I tell you. She hasn\u2019t worked up a full profile yet. When she does, you\u2019ll know.\u201d</p><p>He clenched his jaw, shot a fuming glance toward Colin. \u201cYou\u2019ll fill me in?\u201d</p><p>Colin nodded. He\u2019d tell him as much as he could. He had a feeling the captain wouldn\u2019t let him reveal all the facts to Brooks, but he actually saw that as a good thing. Brooks probably wouldn\u2019t believe them when they started talking about the Other, and he sure as hell wouldn\u2019t know how to track one of them.</p> <p>\u201cFine.\u201d He inclined his head toward the captain. \u201cThen I\u2019ll follow your orders and get the hell out of here.\u201d His glance drifted to Emily. \u201cBut first I want to meet the doctor.\u201d</p><p>The captain grunted but stepped back so that Brooks could make his way over to Emily. She watched him with lowered brows as he approached, her lips slightly pursed.</p><p>Colin crossed to Emily\u2019s side, deliberately positioning himself next to her.</p><p>Brooks held out his hand. \u201cDr. Drake, I\u2019ve heard a lot about you.\u201d He flashed his pretty-boy smile. \u201cI\u2019m Colin\u2019s partner, Detective Todd Brooks.\u201d</p><p>Emily took his hand, held it for all of three seconds\u2014 yeah, he counted\u2014then pulled away. \u201cNice to meet you, Detective.\u201d Her hair was still loose around her shoulders and the lenses of her glasses glinted faintly in the light. Her stare fell on Danny. \u201cWill Detective Brooks be joining us for the briefing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, no, he\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got orders to head home tonight,\u201d Brooks murmured. \u201cBut I\u2019ll look forward to discussing the case with you soon.\u201d</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>Brooks gave a little salute. \u201cNight, guys.\u201d Then he turned on his heel and headed for the exit.</p><p>Emily stepped back into her makeshift office. Colin and Danny crowded in behind her. When Colin kicked the door closed, the bustle of noise from the station immediately quieted.</p><p>\u201cSo what do you have for us, Doc?\u201d he asked, his gaze dropping to the crime scene photos spread across her desk.</p><p>Her hand lifted and she tucked a stray strand of hair behind her ear. \u201cI\u2019ve got a basic profile going so far. You\u2019re probably looking for a male\u2014but you already knew that. Shifters are predominately male. And in this case, the killer had to be damn strong to overpower Preston. Another point for a man. The level of raw violence is also an indicator that the perp is male.\u201d</p><p>Yeah, Colin had already guessed they were looking for a guy. \u201cKeep going.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe killer\u2019s young, probably in his mid-twenties to late thirties, and it\u2019s a good bet that he lives in the area.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know he\u2019s not a drifter?\u201d the captain asked, and Colin knew he was hoping the killer was a one-hit wonder who\u2019d just been passing through.</p><p>\u201cHe knew the house,\u201d Emily explained. \u201cKnew the neighborhood. Knew how to get in and out without being seen. This guy knew Preston. He\u2019s not an out-of-towner who just popped in and randomly decided to murder the vic.\u201d And stranger crimes didn\u2019t usually have this dangerous level of rage.</p><p>\u201cWell, shit.\u201d McNeal looked even more disgruntled than usual. \u201cThere\u2019ve been some rumblings upstairs about this guy being a serial.\u201d He leveled a hard look at the doc. \u201cYou told me before you thought he\u2019d do it again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I did.\u201d Her lips pursed. \u201cBut so far, this guy doesn\u2019t fit the strict definition of a serial.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean because he hasn\u2019t killed three people?\u201d Colin asked.</p><p>She nodded. \u201cThe FBI requires three victims before the label of serial killer can be applied. So far, we\u2019ve only got one body.\u201d</p><p>The doc was holding back. He could feel it. \u201cBut?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I think he\u2019s killed before.\u201d She touched the security photo of the hooded figure entering the Myers house. \u201cThis guy is confident. He had his plan in mind, probably for days before the actual attack. And there were no hesitation wounds on the victim\u2019s body.\u201d Her tongue snaked out, licked her bottom lip. \u201cHe went straight for the kill. This guy\u2019s no amateur, no first-timer feeling his way. He knows exactly what he\u2019s doing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut until we find more bodies, we can\u2019t say he\u2019s a serial,\u201d McNeal muttered.</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d</p><p>Colin didn\u2019t think that was a particularly bad thing. The public tended to panic when they got news that a serial killer was on the streets, and a panicked public could be very dangerous.</p><p>\u201cIf he is a true serial killer, he won\u2019t attack anyone else right away. He\u2019ll wait and have a cooling-off time. Could be for a few days or it could be years.\u201d She began to straighten the photos, putting them into a nice, neat pile. \u201cCourse, since the guy\u2019s a shifter, the normal serial rules might not apply at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat rules would apply?\u201d This came from the captain, who was no longer leaning back against the wall. He\u2019d shot to attention as Emily spoke, and now he stood at the edge of the table, arms crossed over his chest.</p><p>\u201cWell, if we\u2019re right and he is a shifter, then here are a few generalities for you.\u201d She didn\u2019t glance toward Colin as she spoke. \u201cThe guy\u2019s about five times stronger than a human male. He\u2019s highly sexual, got an extremely high IQ, and he\u2019s damn good at manipulation.\u201d</p><p>Colin stiffened at that. \u201cManipulation?\u201d He didn\u2019t particularly like that term.</p><p>Her head turned slowly, and she met his gaze. \u201cShifters are born looking human, but they carry beasts their whole lives. They have to hide their animal natures, have to pretend to be just like everyone else, and usually, by the time shifters reach adulthood, they\u2019re damn good at pretending.\u201d</p><p>You have to pretend, or else the humans will kill you. Hunt you and kill you.</p><p>Emily glanced back at McNeal. \u201cHe\u2019s used to lying, used to hiding, used to blending in with the crowd.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf this guy is so damn good at blending in,\u201d McNeal muttered, \u201cthen how the hell are we going to find him?\u201d</p><p>Good question, and one that Colin didn\u2019t have a ready answer for. Sure, he was chasing down leads. He was planning to go see just what Jake Donnelley knew about the case, but flushing out a shifter? That wasn\u2019t going to be easy. Not by a long shot.</p><p>\u201cWe have to go into his world,\u201d Emily said softly. \u201cPreston was involved with at least one demon that I know of. He could know other SBs. Maybe we can get one of them to talk to us.\u201d</p><p>Well, hell, the doc had just voiced his own plan.</p><p>McNeal shot him a quick, searching glance.</p><p>Colin nodded. \u201cThat\u2019s my general plan.\u201d Emily had just beaten him to the punch.</p><p>The captain grunted. \u201cYou can\u2019t take Brooks with you to question them. The guy doesn\u2019t understand the circumstances of this crime.\u201d</p><p>Yeah, he knew Brooks was out. The guy was a decent partner. Smart, tough, and dependable. Hell, the guy\u2019s main flaw seemed to be that he was always chasing a new lady.</p><p>Brooks was a good-enough guy, but he had no clue about the existence of the Other in the world. No idea that the creatures from the horror flicks he loved so much were actually real.</p><p>His partner lived in the human reality, the black-and-white world where bad guys pulled guns or knives on you\u2014not the world where shape-shifters could rip you apart or demons could incinerate you.</p><p>\u201cTake Dr. Drake with you.\u201d</p><p>Colin jerked at the order, sure he\u2019d misunderstood. \u201cAh, run that by me again, Captain.\u201d</p><p>McNeal\u2019s lips thinned. \u201cYou heard me, Gyth. You need someone to go with you when you interview the Other. You need her.</p><p>Hell, without her, you won\u2019t even be able to tell the difference between the humans and the\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not safe for her,\u201d Colin snarled, cutting across the captain\u2019s words. Take Emily with him to interview demons, shifters? Hell, no.</p><p>\u201cYou keep her safe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014\u201d He floundered. Well, sure if Emily was with him, he\u2019d do everything in his power to protect her. But he didn\u2019t want to put her at risk. Anything could happen on the street, and if someone were to hurt the doc on his watch...</p><p>His nails began to stretch into claws.</p><p>What the fuck?</p><p>Colin balled his hands into fists and jerked away from McNeal and Emily. He hoped they hadn\u2019t seen the change. Hoped they hadn\u2019t noticed the razor-sharp claws that sprung from his fingertips.</p><p>Jesus. That had never happened before. He\u2019d never had the change come on him so damn fast when there wasn\u2019t a physical threat nearby.</p><p>What in the hell is happening to me?</p><p>\u201cColin?\u201d Emily\u2019s voice. The soft drawl was laced with concern.</p><p>Great.</p><p>\u201cShe doesn\u2019t go.\u201d He didn\u2019t look back at her. At the captain. His normal control wasn\u2019t back yet, and he was having to fight the lure of the beast.</p><p>McNeal grunted. \u201cDon\u2019t be an asshole, Detective. You need her and you know it.\u201d</p><p>The faint creak of the floorboards grated against his ears. Emily is inching closer to me.</p><p>Get your control back, man. Get it back now.</p><p>He spun around, came face-to-face with her.</p><p>Her green eyes widened and her lips parted on a startled breath of surprise.</p><p>With the beast so close, all of his senses were heightened. Her scent filled his nostrils, and the light whisper of her breathing filled his ears. He could even hear the faint drum of her heart. Beating fast, so fast.</p><p>\u201cAre you all right?\u201d Her brows drew together as she stared up at him.</p><p>And he wondered just what she was feeling. Was the doc using her mojo? Was she tapping into his emotions? Before she\u2019d told him that he projected, and he bet the beast was projecting a hell of a lot of raw emotion straight at her then.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d he gritted, and it was the truth. The beast had just tried to slip its leash for a moment, but the animal was chained again.</p><p>Emily had lifted her right hand toward him. It hung in the air, hovering just above his chest. As he watched, her fingers slowly lowered and she pulled back her hand, stepping away from him.</p><p>\u201cA civilian can\u2019t work the street.\u201d And his captain should damn well know that. \u201cShe\u2019s not armed. She won\u2019t be able to defend herself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut she\u2019ll know exactly who you need to talk with, won\u2019t she, Detective?\u201d The captain looked about as satisfied as a man could get. The jerk.</p><p>Yeah, she\u2019d know who he needed to interview. She\u2019d make his questioning go a hell of a lot faster.</p><p>But the idea of taking her with him...</p><p>It didn\u2019t sit well with him. Not one damn bit.</p><p>\u201cYou need me, Gyth,\u201d Emily told him softly. And yeah, she was right. He needed her for the case.</p><p>Needed her in his bed.</p><p>Right then, he wasn\u2019t pleased with either fact.</p><p>His eyes narrowed on her. \u201cIf we do this, you do what I say, exactly as I order.\u201d Keeping the doc under his control wasn\u2019t gonna be easy. Hell, this was the same woman who\u2019d gone traipsing after him as he searched that old vacant lot near her house.</p><p>I thought you might need my help.</p><p>Dammit, taking her out on the streets with him would be hell.</p><p>\u201cDo you think you can do it, Doc?\u201d he asked, taking a step toward her. Their bodies were close, so close he could feel the warmth of her skin against him. \u201cDo you think you\u2019ll be able to take orders from me?\u201d To actually follow those orders? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Her jaw clenched and her green eyes blazed with fire. \u201cYes,\u201d she gritted. \u201cI think I can.\u201d</p><p>Well, he might not like it, but it looked like he and the doc would be working the street together.</p><p>And since Jake Donnelley had asked for a meeting at the Paradise Found in\u2014Colin glanced down at his watch\u2014less than an hour and a half, it looked like their partnership was about to get started.</p> <p>Shit, but he wasn\u2019t pleased with this situation. Not one damn bit.</p><p>His captain was glaring at him, giving him the old you\u2019d-damn-well-better-not-screw-this-up stare.</p><p>Emily was gazing up at him, eyes slightly narrowed. Anger burned in her green eyes.</p><p>That couldn\u2019t bode well for the night.</p><p>He leaned in toward Emily, pitched his voice low as he whispered in her ear. \u201cIf we\u2019re doin\u2019 this, then you remember that I\u2019m the one in charge. You listen to me, Doc. And you do exactly as I say.\u201d</p> <p>She exhaled heavily. \u201cI\u2019m not an idiot, you know,\u201d she snapped, making no effort to lower her voice. \u201cI know you\u2019re the one with the police experience.\u201d</p><p>Oh, that had been easy. Too easy, really.</p><p>Her index finger jabbed into his chest. \u201cBut don\u2019t forget I\u2019m the one with the Other experience.\u201d Then, finally, finally, the woman decided to lower her voice as she whispered, \u201cYou might think you\u2019re the baddest thing out there, Gyth, but I\u2019ve got news for you...I\u2019ve seen things a hell of a lot scarier than a cop shifter.\u201d</p><p>His gaze shot to McNeal\u2019s. But the captain was just staring blandly back at him. His lips were curved with faint amusement.</p><p>He bit back the words that sprang to his lips. If Emily ever saw the beast he carried, he\u2019d bet his life it\u2019d scare her. Hell, when his ex-partner had seen his other form, Mike had run like hell. Then Mike had come back and tried to kill him.</p><p>Good thing he was hard to kill.</p> <p>\u201cSo are we going to do this?\u201d Emily stepped back. Reached for the files on the table. \u201cOr are you too worried that my presence will screw up your case?\u201d</p><p>Oh, he was worried. But they\u2019d do it anyway. He\u2019d play her game, play the captain\u2019s game, for now.</p><p>And he\u2019d make damn sure he kept the doc safe. He\u2019d stick by her side every moment.</p><p>He just hoped she meant what she\u2019d said about following his orders. Because listening to him, doing exactly as he ordered, well, that could be the difference between life and death.</p><p>\u201cUmm, glad that\u2019s settled then.\u201d McNeal stretched slowly. \u201cI\u2019m going to get out of here.\u201d He shot a quick, hard glance at Colin as he opened the door. \u201cLet me know how the meeting goes.\u201d</p><p>His head inclined in a barely perceptible nod. He\u2019d briefed the captain earlier about Donnelley\u2019s note. In hindsight, he now saw that hadn\u2019t been the best plan. It\u2019d obviously made McNeal think the doc would have a connection with the suspects on the case.</p><p>The fact that Emily did have a connection with them only pissed him off more.</p><p>He hated being forced into a corner.</p> <p>Colin waited until Emily bid the captain good night, waited until the glass door swung shut behind McNeal, then he reached for her hand.</p><p>His fingers locked around her wrist, and her pulse pounded fast and hard beneath his touch.</p><p>\u201cYou sure you\u2019re ready for this?\u201d Once he took her onto the street, there would be no going back. Acting as a profiler was one thing. She could sit back in an air-conditioned office and scribble her notes, but going with him to talk to the Other...well, it could make her a target. A very big target.</p><p>Behind her glasses, her green eyes stared straight back at him. There wasn\u2019t even a hint of hesitation in her expression. \u201cI\u2019m sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, then, Doc. Let\u2019s go find out what our cameraman has to say.\u201d Yep, it was time to go and meet Jake Donnelley. Time to go to Paradise Found.</p><p>According to Emily the place was the town\u2019s number one demon hangout.</p><p>As dates went, it wasn\u2019t his best.</p><p>Then again, it wasn\u2019t his worst either.</p><p>Chapter 5</p><p>Getting past the seven-foot-tall demon guarding the door of Paradise Found had been incredibly easy.</p><p>She\u2019d handed the guy a twenty, and he\u2019d let them slip right past without even a raised brow.</p><p>The guy had known they weren\u2019t demons. They didn\u2019t carry the \u201cdemon scent\u201d that marked the beings of that race. No, Emily knew she just smelled human. She wasn\u2019t exactly sure how Colin had registered to the bouncer\u2019s sensitive nose.</p><p>\u201cThat was easy,\u201d Colin muttered, his eyes sweeping across the darkened interior of Paradise Found. \u201cI would\u2019ve thought it would be harder to get into one of the pits of hell.\u201d</p><p>Yes, and if the bouncer hadn\u2019t been one of her ex-patients, Emily was certain it would have been much, much more difficult.</p><p>Demons were real particular about letting humans into their playgrounds. And from what she\u2019d learned over the years, they didn\u2019t feel a whole lot of love for shifters, either. But then, who did? Shifters were the black sheep of the Other family.</p><p>She\u2019d been to Paradise Found before. Once she\u2019d hung out there far, far too often.</p><p>The place still looked the same. Dim lighting snaked across the bar, hiding the demons in the darkness. The old dance floor was still as small, and as packed with humans as ever. Jesus, the place even smelled the same. Sweat, alcohol, and sex.</p><p>Very carefully, Emily unclenched her hands. When had she balled her fingers into fists? Probably the second she\u2019d stepped over the threshold and entered the bar.</p><p>Bad memories. There were a lot of bad memories here.</p><p>Her gaze drifted toward the long, black bar top. That\u2019s where she\u2019d almost died, where Myles had tried to shove his power into her mind and make her into one of his damn human puppets.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t see Donnelley.\u201d Colin paced in front of her, tension tight in his body. He was already attracting more than a few nervous stares.</p><p>Her hand touched his arm. \u201cHe\u2019s probably in the back.\u201d She motioned toward a row of booths heading down a thin corridor.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s look over there.\u201d Emily walked across the dance floor, easily dodging the crowd and letting her gaze scan the back row of booths. She could feel the supernatural energy in the room swirling around her. So many Other. Demons, vamps, charmers. She\u2019d better keep her shields up. Keep them strong and\u2014</p><p>\u201cHold on, Doc.\u201d Colin snagged her wrist, stopping her at the edge of the wooden floor. \u201cWhy do I get the feeling you\u2019ve been here before?\u201d His words were spoken into her ear. His breath blew against her.</p><p>She swallowed but didn\u2019t turn back toward him. Now wasn\u2019t the time to rehash her past. Hell, she\u2019d be happy if she never had to rehash it. She\u2019d been a kid, she\u2019d made dumb-ass mistakes, case closed. \u201cColin, I\u2014\u201d</p><p>A man rose from the shadows of the back booth. Lifted his hand to her.</p><p>\u201cThere he is,\u201d her voice whispered out.</p><p>Colin\u2019s fingers tightened around her. \u201cRemember, Doc, this is my show.\u201d A distinct warning laced his words.</p><p>\u201cLike I could forget,\u201d she muttered. Jesus. How many times was the guy going to remind her? She got it. The investigation was his game. She was supposed to play the good little girl and sit back and let the big, bad guy do his job.</p><p>Well, she\u2019d never been a good little girl.</p><p>Good little girls didn\u2019t get sent to\u2014</p><p>\u201cCome back to play with me, huh, Emily?\u201d</p><p>Her head jerked up at the deep, rumbling voice, and Emily found herself staring into the midnight black eyes of Niol.</p><p>Shit. The dark waves of his power lapped at her, and a dull headache immediately formed behind her eyes.</p><p>The guy made her sick. Literally.</p><p>Come back to play with me. Not damn likely. But she\u2019d better not burn any bridges yet. She and Colin needed to find out exactly why Preston Myers had a picture of this guy in his house. \u201cUh, hello, Niol.\u201d</p><p>Colin stepped up to her side. Bared his teeth. And kept his hold on her wrist. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve had the pleasure.\u201d He held out his right hand.</p><p>Niol lifted one black brow. \u201cNo, Detective, I don\u2019t think you have.\u201d He took Colin\u2019s hand, his fingers tightening for the briefest of moments.</p><p>Colin kept his smile\u2014 well, it really wasn\u2019t a smile, it was that same baring of fangs that he\u2019d flashed at Darla\u2014on his face as he said, \u201cI see you know who I am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut not what you are.\u201d Niol\u2019s gaze returned to Emily. \u201cIf you\u2019re with Emily, then that means you must be...special.\u201d</p><p>Colin didn\u2019t respond.</p><p>The dancers around them crept back, giving them plenty of space. Probably running away from Niol.</p><p>Niol crossed his arms over his chest. \u201cBut you\u2019re not my kind, are you, Detective?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour kind?\u201d Colin shrugged, a faint ripple of muscle, of menace. Then he brushed back his jacket, subtly revealing the butt of his gun. \u201cAnd just what kind would that be?\u201d</p><p>Niol laughed softly, and the sound sent a chill skating down Emily\u2019s spine. Oh damn, but this guy was trouble. Serious trouble. His power was so strong, she could practically see the black energy waves in the air around them. Even with her shields up.</p><p>\u201cAh, so you like to play games too? Just like our lovely doctor?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOur? \u201d Where the hell had that come from? Her back teeth locked.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not here to play games,\u201d Colin told him softly.</p><p>Niol\u2019s dark stare drifted down Emily\u2019s body.</p><p>Then Colin\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cPity.\u201d Niol pursed his lips. \u201cI have a feeling I could have enjoyed myself with you two for a time.\u201d He centered his attention back on her. \u201cBut if your detective doesn\u2019t want in on the fun, then perhaps you and I could\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t even fucking think about it,\u201d Colin snarled, stepping forward. He\u2019d dropped her wrist, clenched his hands into fists.</p><p>He was as big as Niol. As tall, as muscled.</p><p>As a shifter, he\u2019d be Niol\u2019s match in physical strength. But as much as she\u2019d love to see the demon lord get an ass kicking, now wasn\u2019t the time.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s just messing around, Colin.\u201d She glanced at Niol. Met that dark stare. Unlike other demons, Niol didn\u2019t bother disguising his black eyes. Didn\u2019t bother pretending he was anything other than what he was. A very, very dangerous demon. One that it didn\u2019t pay to cross. Keeping her eyes on Niol, she told Colin, \u201cHe doesn\u2019t mean it.\u201d He\u2019d damn well better not mean it. She\u2019d sooner live the rest of her life sexless than be with a guy like him.</p><p>Niol was watching Colin, calculation plain on his face. \u201cSo it\u2019s like that, is it?\u201d</p><p>Colin jerked his head in a nod.</p><p>Niol licked his lips. \u201cPity,\u201d he said again.</p><p>It was a pity that she hadn\u2019t let Colin kick the jerk\u2019s ass. But they were at the bar on official business. She kinda thought McNeal would frown on a fight between his detective and the bar\u2019s owner. \u201cNiol, we need to ask you some questions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe?\u201d</p><p>What, had she stuttered? Emily glared at him. \u201cYeah, we. \u201d</p><p>\u201cWorking for the cops now, are you? How disappointing.\u201d He sighed. \u201cI\u2019d hoped you\u2019d come work for me one day. I could always use a woman with your talents.\u201d</p><p>Emily plastered a bright, completely false smile on her face. \u201cThanks for the offer, but I\u2019ve got a job.\u201d Two, actually.</p><p>\u201cYou know, love, people still talk about the way you burned out that demon. Nearly died doing it, didn\u2019t you? But you took his power away, every last drop.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes narrowed and her head kept throbbing. Time to stop the painful walk down memory lane. \u201cAbout those questions...\u201d</p><p>Niol\u2019s full lips stretched into a smile, a smile that showcased his perfect, white teeth. \u201cLet me save you some time, love. Yes, I knew Preston. He was a fairly wealthy guy who wanted to invest in my place. No, he wasn\u2019t my kind. And, no, I didn\u2019t kill him.\u201d</p><p>Emily blinked. Well, the guy wasn\u2019t playing dumb about the case. That was good. But was he telling the truth?</p><p>For an instant, she was tempted to lower her shields. Just a few seconds, that would be all she\u2019d need...</p><p>From the corner of her eye, she caught sight of the long, gleaming bar.</p><p>She\u2019d fallen against that bar, fallen, hit the floor, screaming, clutching her head\u2014</p><p>Emily exhaled. Bad idea. Very bad idea. She couldn\u2019t drop her shields in this place; there were too many unknowns. She couldn\u2019t risk a burnout in the middle of a crowd teaming with Other.</p><p>Wouldn\u2019t be good for business.</p><p>\u201cYou say you didn\u2019t kill him,\u201d Colin drawled. \u201cYou got an idea who did?\u201d</p><p>Niol shook his head. \u201cSomeone who hated him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t hate him?\u201d</p><p>Emily watched his reactions carefully. Niol appeared calm, perfectly in control. As if he got questioned about a murder every day.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t like him,\u201d Niol replied. \u201cBut hate? No, too strong of a word. I just...didn\u2019t really care one way or the other.\u201d</p><p>Yes, the guy was calm, controlled, ice cold. \u201cDo you care that he\u2019s dead?\u201d Emily asked.</p><p>His expression didn\u2019t change as he shrugged. \u201cNow I\u2019ve got to get another investor. It\u2019s an inconvenience.\u201d</p><p>An inconvenience. A man\u2019s death was an inconvenience to him.</p><p>Colin grunted. Slanting a quick look his way, Emily noticed that a muscle was flexing along the line of Colin\u2019s jaw.</p><p>He looked seriously pissed as he demanded, \u201cWhere were you last Friday, between eight and nine?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNiol?\u201d A tall, model-thin brunette slipped behind the demon and wrapped her hands around his waist. \u201cYou made me wait,\u201d she whispered, stretching to kiss his neck.</p><p>\u201cSorry, love.\u201d He never glanced her way. \u201cI had to play nice with the PD.\u201d His hand lifted, covered hers. \u201cBut I\u2019m done now.\u201d</p><p>An obvious dismissal.</p> <p>Colin pulled out a card, thrust it toward Niol. \u201cIf you happen to learn anything about the case or if you\u201d\u2014a deliberate pause\u2014</p><p>\u201cremember anything you want to share, call me.\u201d</p><p>Niol pocketed the card. \u201cI\u2019ll be sure to do that...if I learn anything else.\u201d His head inclined slightly. \u201cAs always, it\u2019s been a pleasure, Emily.\u201d</p><p>Right. She snorted. Why did he even bother pretending with her? Niol knew she could see right through his fake manners to the real nature of the demon within.</p><p>And that demon, he wasn\u2019t a gentleman. He was hard, evil. Deadly.</p> <p>Pity the lady clinging to his arm so tightly and glaring at her didn\u2019t realize those important facts.</p><p>And now wasn\u2019t the time to warn her.</p><p>Niol and his companion stepped back, and in mere seconds, they had vanished, melting into the crowd.</p><p>\u201cWhat a bastard.\u201d Colin glared into the throng of dancers, then turned his bright blue stare on her. \u201cThink he knows more than he\u2019s saying?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t have to use her psychic powers on this one. \u201cWithout a doubt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, me, too.\u201d</p> <p>Emily turned her attention back to the darkened booths. Was Donnelley still waiting on them?</p><p>\u201cWas the woman a demon too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She answered absently as she tried to search the shadows. Had Jake gotten frightened when he\u2019d seen them talk to Niol?</p><p>Had they missed their chance to find out exactly what he knew about the case?</p><p>\u201cThen what was she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuman.\u201d There\u2019d been no shift in the atmosphere when the woman approached, no telling flow of power, no faint shine emanating from her body. Niol\u2019s companion was most definitely a human.</p><p>Did she know what he was?</p><p>\u201cWhat did he mean, about you draining some demon\u2019s power? Thought you said you were an empath, that you just felt\u2014\u201d</p> <p>He would lock onto that part of the conversation. Her eyes continued to search the booths as she said very softly, \u201cI was defending myself, okay, Gyth? The bastard attacked me, shoved the full force of his power into my head.\u201d As a level nine, the demon had plenty of power to shove. \u201cIt was instinct. I fought back, tried to push the energy right back at him.\u201d And she\u2019d managed to blast away all his power before she\u2019d collapsed.</p><p>Emily finally looked at him, found him watching her. \u201cIt\u2019s not something I like to talk about.\u201d Explanation made, case closed. She didn\u2019t want to bring up the subject again.</p><p>\u201cUnderstood.\u201d</p><p>Her shoulders relaxed. Good. Maybe she could get through the rest of the night without any more rehashing of one of the most painful moments of her life. Her stare swept the bar once again, then locked on the shadowy figure of a man.</p><p>A man who stood near the back booth. He motioned to her, waving his hand quickly in the air.</p><p>\u201cDonnelley\u2019s there.\u201d Relief poured through her. She\u2019d been afraid that Niol\u2019s dark presence had screwed up the meeting.</p><p>\u201cI see him.\u201d</p><p>Course he did. He could probably see perfectly through the shadows while she had to strain and squint. Shifter skills. Sometimes they sure could come in handy.</p><p>A waitress brushed by them as they maneuvered to Donnelley\u2019s table. Emily caught the faint whiff of power around the woman. A witch.</p><p>Donnelley was bent low over the table, his hands fisted over the old, scarred wood surface. His jaw tightened when they sat across from him. \u201cI gave the note to her, Gyth, not you.\u201d A Braves baseball cap was pulled low over his head, hiding his blond hair.</p><p>Colin leaned back against the black cushions. \u201cIt\u2019s my case.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd my life!\u201d A bead of sweat rolled down Jake\u2019s cheek. \u201cDo you know what kind of risk I\u2019m taking just by being here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Colin jerked his thumb toward the dance floor. \u201cScared your buddies will turn on you if they find out you\u2019re givin\u2019</p><p>information to the cops?\u201d</p><p>Colin sure didn\u2019t have much finesse.</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t planning on talking to you. \u201d His stare darted to the left, the right. Then landed on Emily. \u201cI wanted to talk to Dr. Drake.\u201d</p><p>Beside her, Colin shrugged. \u201cSo talk. We\u2019re both listening.\u201d</p><p>Jake licked his lips. Hunched even deeper into the booth. \u201cPreston knew about us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUs?\u201d Emily asked softly. She\u2019d figured she\u2019d better jump in, before Colin scared the guy to death with his hard-ass approach.</p><p>Sometimes a delicate technique was required. She\u2019d spent years honing that technique.</p><p>\u201cYeah. You know, the Other. \u201d</p><p>Well, that wasn\u2019t exactly news. But she nodded anyway, trying to look encouraging.</p><p>\u201cHis girl, she was a demon.\u201d</p><p>She could feel the sudden, alert tension in Colin\u2019s body. \u201cWhat\u2019s her name?\u201d</p><p>Jake sucked in a sharp breath. The weak beat of his power flickered in the air around them. \u201cYou didn\u2019t get this from me, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d Colin tapped his index finger on the table.</p><p>\u201cGillian Nemont.\u201d He swallowed. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think you\u2019re gonna be able to talk to her.\u201d</p><p>Jake pushed to his feet and cast another nervous glance toward the front of the bar. \u201cShouldn\u2019t have come here,\u201d he muttered. For a moment, his face tightened as he looked back at Emily. \u201cI thought we\u2019d meet alone.\u201d</p><p>Colin stood slowly. \u201cSorry, we\u2019re a package deal.\u201d He positioned his body in front of Jake\u2019s, effectively blocking the demon\u2019s path. \u201cAnd just why won\u2019t Gillian talk to me? Does she have a thing against cops?\u201d</p><p>Jake shook his head. \u201cNo, if you can find her, she might talk, but...\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut what?\u201d Emily pressed.</p><p>One shoulder lifted in a faint shrug. \u201cBut I think she\u2019s hiding. I haven\u2019t seen her in at least a week, maybe two.\u201d</p><p>Jake stepped forward, obviously intending to make his exit, but Colin didn\u2019t move. Colin stood a few inches taller than the demon, and he stared down at him, his head cocked to the right. \u201cThat all you got for us, Donnelley?\u201d</p><p>Jake nodded. \u201cYeah, I wanted to make sure the doctor knew to look in the right direction for the killer, that\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe right direction?\u201d Emily repeated, frowning slightly at his phrasing. \u201cAnd just what is the right direction?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA human didn\u2019t do this,\u201d Jake said. \u201cIt\u2019s one of us. I knew it when I saw the body.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, damn.\u201d Colin whistled softly. \u201cYou\u2019re the guy who got the shot of Preston, aren\u2019t you? You\u2019re the one who took the picture of his body and got it splashed across every newspaper in the city.\u201d</p><p>Jake lifted his chin. \u201cI\u2019m a reporter, okay? I was doing my job.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh. Here I was thinking you were just the cameraman.\u201d</p><p>Jake\u2019s golden eyes flashed black. A ripple of weak power swept through the air. The power would have been enough to cause a human to stumble back, maybe even to fall.</p><p>Colin didn\u2019t waver from his spot. One black brow rose. \u201cIs that all you\u2019ve got?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t want to see what I can do,\u201d Jake snapped. Then he lifted his hand and shoved past Colin.</p><p>Emily sighed. That did so not go well. No wonder Danny wanted her to accompany Colin. \u201cNot much for tact, are you?\u201d</p><p>He glanced at her. \u201cThe guy tried to use his magic on me.\u201d</p><p>Shifters were immune to demon magic. Actually, a demon\u2019s magic worked only on humans.</p><p>\u201cYou know you just showed him that you\u2019re Other. \u201d And that worried her. Had Jake deliberately tested him?</p><p>His lips tightened.</p><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t watch it, Gyth, your little secret might get out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not gonna tell anyone. If he did, he\u2019d have to reveal his own history.\u201d</p><p>Yeah, he was right. Jake would have just as much to lose.</p><p>The crowd in Paradise Found was even bigger now, even louder, and as they maneuvered back to the entrance, Emily was aware of the stares on them, aware of the whispers.</p><p>She breathed a sigh of relief when they finally stepped back outside. The night air was slightly cool, and the sky was a starless black, illuminated only by the glistening moon.</p><p>They walked in silence for a moment. Emily replayed both Niol\u2019s and Jake\u2019s conversations in her mind. She wasn\u2019t sure she trusted either man.</p><p>\u201cWe need to find this Gillian,\u201d Colin said, stepping off the sidewalk and turning into the alley. His Jeep was parked just around the corner. Just a few hundred feet away. \u201cBrooks ran Preston\u2019s background check. We both talked to the neighbors, family. No one mentioned this woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe he was keeping her secret. It\u2019s not exactly easy to announce to the family that your new love is a demon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, he coulda kept quiet about her.\u201d He paused beneath a flickering light hanging from the back door of a club. \u201cThat black eye thing\u2014it\u2019s a demon trait, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>She nodded, and realized that she seriously needed to brush the guy up on Other 101. Despite being an SB, he sure didn\u2019t seem too aware of their world.</p><p>Probably because he\u2019d been hiding from that world, trying to fit in with the humans.</p><p>\u201cWhy doesn\u2019t Niol change his eye color?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause Niol doesn\u2019t give a damn. He doesn\u2019t care if people realize he\u2019s different.\u201d Hell, as far as she could tell, Niol actually got off on jolting humans out of their safe worlds.</p><p>And, of course, he got off with humans too.</p><p>The fluorescent light hanging over Colin made a faint humming sound, then faded into darkness.</p><p>A chill skated down her body. Emily glanced around the alley. She didn\u2019t see anyone else.</p><p>She lowered the shields in her mind, aware of a sudden shift in the atmosphere.</p><p>No, she didn\u2019t see anyone, but she could feel a presence.</p><p>Emily opened her mind, sent her powers questing out. A blast of hot, burning rage hit her, driving straight into her mind, driving her down to her knees as she cried out in sudden pain.</p><p>Level-ten demon. Shit.</p><p>\u201cEmily?\u201d Colin reached for her, catching her by the arms and pulling her onto her feet. \u201cBaby, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>Her teeth were chattering. \u201cS-someone\u2019s h-here...\u201d She shook her head, clenching her jaw.</p><p>What the hell? He kept his left hand wrapped around her. He could hear her heartbeat; the frantic drumming filled his ears.</p><p>He didn\u2019t hear anything else, though. Didn\u2019t hear the telltale crunch of gravel beneath shoes. Didn\u2019t hear the whisper of clothing that would alert him to someone else\u2019s presence in the alley.</p><p>His senses were fully open. If an assailant was in the alley, he should know it.</p><p>Colin reached for his weapon. He didn\u2019t sense anyone, but the doc sure did, and he wasn\u2019t about to take any chances. He slipped off the safety, wanting to be ready.</p><p>Four men jumped from the shadows. They wore full black ski masks, jackets, pants, and boots. The masked men lunged for him and the doc. Colin shoved her back against the alley wall and turned to face them, lifting his gun. \u201cGet back,\u201d he ordered, \u201cI\u2019m a cop\u2014\u201d</p><p>They attacked.</p><p>Sonofabitch. They fell on him at once, hitting and punching, driving him back to the ground. He fired a shot, but he must have missed, because they didn\u2019t stop, not for an instant. He felt an icy pain slice into his right hand. Felt blood pool into his palm as his gun dropped from his suddenly nerveless fingers.</p><p>He didn\u2019t know who these guys were, but they\u2019d just picked the wrong guy to fuck with.</p><p>Colin was pinned on the ground, his bloody fingers scraping against the rough gravel. One of the assholes was driving his boot into Colin\u2019s ribs.</p><p>Another one was going for the doc.</p><p>Screw this.</p><p>The beast within roared its rage. Colin\u2019s nails lengthened into razor-sharp claws. He slashed out with his hands, catching two of his attackers; he cut open the leg of the asshole who\u2019d been kicking him and then drove his claws into the second bastard\u2019s stomach.</p><p>\u201cGet the hell off me!\u201d</p><p>Colin turned at Emily\u2019s shout. She was pinned against the wall. A man, tall, hulking, had his hands wrapped around her arms. He was leaning into her, and she was kicking against him, ramming her high heels against his shins and trying to head-butt him.</p><p>If he hadn\u2019t been so furious, he might have been impressed with her.</p><p>Then the man\u2019s hands shot to her throat.</p><p>Colin forgot about everything in that instant but the urge to kill.</p><p>He was behind the man in less than a second. Grabbed him, lifted the bastard up, tossed him headfirst into the alley wall.</p><p>Emily gasped for breath, her hands rising to her throat.</p><p>Colin spared her a glance. Her hands were shaking, her body quivering lightly.</p><p>He crouched over her attacker. He wanted the guy\u2019s blood. Could almost taste the kill.</p><p>He touched Emily. Wrapped his hands around her throat. Tried to hurt her.</p><p>The beast was screaming its rage, and Colin could actually hear the howl in his ears.</p><p>Destroy. Attack.</p><p>Kill.</p><p>The beast was hungry, so hungry.</p><p>His claws lifted over the man.</p><p>\u201cDammit, watch out!\u201d Emily shot past him, arms raised, and drove straight into the last assailant. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Colin spun around. He\u2019d forgotten the other man. For one blind, reckless moment, he\u2019d completely forgotten the guy.</p><p>They were on the ground now. Emily was sprawled on top of him, and Colin could see the faint glimmer of a knife next to the fallen man\u2019s hand.</p><p>Well, damn.</p> <p>The doc had just saved his life.</p><p>\u201cBitch!\u201d</p><p>Colin\u2019s eyes narrowed. He took a step forward just as Emily drove her knee into the asshole\u2019s crotch. He jerked, yelling in pain and twisting away from her.</p><p>Colin grabbed Emily, pulled her to her feet. The perp on the ground was curled into a fetal position, squealing.</p><p>He whistled softly and glanced at Emily. \u201cAnd here I thought you were the delicate type.\u201d She\u2019d lost her glasses, and her hair fell loosely around her face. His hand lifted toward her cheek. He wanted to push back her hair, to touch her, to\u2014</p> <p>\u201cWhat in the hell?\u201d Emily grabbed his wrist. Her eyes widened. \u201cGyth, you\u2019ve got claws!\u201d</p><p>His body tensed. He\u2019d forgotten about his partial shift. He could only be grateful for the darkness, otherwise Emily would see the blood on his hands, embedded in his claws.</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of shifter are you?\u201d There was a note of hesitation in her voice, a note of almost...fear.</p><p>Damn. That was the last thing he needed. He didn\u2019t want the doc to fear him. Not now.</p><p>\u201cColin?\u201d</p><p>He couldn\u2019t tell her. Couldn\u2019t risk it.</p> <p>Colin spun away from her, glanced back down at the guys on the ground. \u201cWho are you bastards and why the fuck did you attack us?\u201d Okay, not the standard police interviewing technique, but he wasn\u2019t exactly feeling all nice and professional.</p><p>His ribs were hurting like hell thanks to Mr. Kick Happy. Colin swiped his hand against his lip, feeling the wet warmth of blood. His lip had probably gotten busted when they tackled him to the ground.</p><p>The guys were rousing, sending narrow-eyed, glittering stares his way. What in the hell? He\u2019d taken them down, hard. They shouldn\u2019t be getting up this soon, no damn way, not unless\u2014</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re demons,\u201d Emily told him, confirming the suspicion that had been filling his mind.</p><p>Well, shit.</p><p>Things were suddenly much, much more dangerous. He wasn\u2019t an Other expert like the doc, but he knew demons healed fast.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re low level.\u201d She stood beside him. Their backs were near the wall of the alley. \u201cMaybe a one or a two.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t really know what that meant, and he made a mental note to quiz the doc on Other lore sometime later. Once they\u2019d gotten out of the alley and far away from the jerks who were trying to kill them.</p> <p>\u201cStay behind me,\u201d he ordered, now eyeing the perps with deep suspicion. They could attack again at any moment.</p><p>The guy who\u2019d made the mistake of going after Emily climbed to his feet. A deep gash swept across his forehead, and blood trickled down his face. \u201cCatching on now, cop?\u201d</p><p>The others pushed to their feet. Crept up behind the one ballsy enough to talk. Colin figured him for the leader.</p><p>\u201cHe cut me, Scott.\u201d The snarled words came from the guy bleeding out a river in the back.</p><p>Colin held up his hands, let them see the claws springing from his fingertips. \u201cAnd I\u2019ll do it again.\u201d He\u2019d cut the demons apart if they came at him or if they tried to attack Emily. He\u2019d been pissed enough before when they\u2019d first jumped him, but now that he knew they weren\u2019t human, all bets were off. He\u2019d use every bit of his shifter strength to make them wish they\u2019d never stepped into the alley.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s kill \u2019em!\u201d Same demon talking. The bastard who was currently bleeding out in the alley. He was a tall guy, lean but muscled.</p><p>\u201cYou can try,\u201d Colin said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll succeed. Especially considering the fact that I just kicked your asses.\u201d And he\u2019d be more than happy to do it again.</p><p>Emily\u2019s nails dug into his back. \u201cSomeone else is here. Someone a hell of a lot more powerful than these guys.\u201d</p><p>The night just kept getting better. \u201cI don\u2019t see anyone,\u201d he muttered, and it was true. The night was dark, but with his enhanced vision, he could see perfectly in the alley. He could even see the snake tattoo swirling around the left wrist of the bastard he\u2019d clawed. That\u2019ll help identify you later, asshole.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s here,\u201d she repeated softly. \u201cAnd\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cStay the fuck out of our business, cop!\u201d This snarl came from the leader, the guy who\u2019d been called Scott. \u201cTonight was a warning. You and the doctor won\u2019t get another.\u201d</p><p>Our business?</p><p>\u201cStick to your own kind!\u201d Now snake tattoo was shouting his own warning. \u201cLeave the demons alone.\u201d</p><p>Oh yeah, like that was going to happen. If anything, these idiots had just made him all the more determined to plunge straight into their world.</p><p>\u201cWho sent you?\u201d Emily asked, and she sure as hell didn\u2019t sound like she was frightened. She sounded royally pissed. \u201cWho told you to jump us in the alley?\u201d</p><p>Scott stiffened.</p><p>\u201cWas it Niol?\u201d She pushed. \u201cIs he the reason you\u2019re threatening us? Did he tell you\u2014\u201d</p><p>A siren sounded nearby.</p><p>The men cursed, then turned, fleeing down the alley just as the swirl of blue and white lights lit up the scene.</p><p>Two uniformed cops jumped out of the vehicle, guns drawn. \u201cHands up, now!\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit.\u201d Colin lifted his hands and watched in disgust as the demons disappeared into the shadows. He\u2019d find those bastards again, he\u2019d make certain of it. \u201cListen, I\u2019m a cop. Detective Colin Gyth, badge number 2517.\u201d He made no move to reach for his ID. The cops looked more than a little nervous to be confronting him in the alley, and he wasn\u2019t about to give these green guys a reason to become trigger happy.</p><p>Emily had her hands lifted up too. One of the patrolmen approached her, pulling her away from Gyth.</p><p>\u201cCome with me, ma\u2019am.\u201d</p><p>Hot rage still coursed through Colin\u2019s body. He took a deep breath, inhaled the stench of the alley, the sweat from the cops. He needed to regain his control, needed to cage the beast.</p><p>His claws began to recede. Slowly, slowly.</p><p>\u201cShow me your ID, Detective.\u201d The patrolman still held his gun on Colin.</p><p>Carefully, Colin reached inside his jacket and pulled out his ID. The cop took it, stepped back. \u201cDon\u2019t move.\u201d He crept toward the car, and Colin heard him radio in his information.</p><p>\u201cWe were attacked! The guys who jumped us are getting away!\u201d Emily still sounded pissed as she raged at the cop.</p><p>He glanced toward the end of the alley. Correction: they\u2019d already gotten away.</p><p>\u201cOkay, Detective, you check out.\u201d</p><p>Colin lowered his hands. \u201cI need you to start a search in the area. Four men just attacked us.\u201d And warned us to stay the hell out of demon business.</p><p>Not gonna happen.</p><p>\u201cThey were wearing black ski masks, shirts, pants.\u201d Which would make identifying them damn hard. \u201cBut one guy had a snake tattoo on his left wrist. And the leader was a man named Scott.\u201d Not much to go on, but it was all they had.</p><p>\u201cFour men attacked you?\u201d This from the cop who\u2019d taken Emily away.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019ve been trying to tell you,\u201d she snapped.</p><p>The patrolman dutifully radioed in the information Colin had given him. \u201cAre either of you hurt?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Emily shook her head.</p><p>Colin remembered the icy flash of pain he\u2019d felt in his hand when one of the bastards had cut him. The wound had already stopped bleeding, and his ribs only ached in a brief echo of pain. \u201cNo.\u201d He\u2019d be completely healed long before any EMT could arrive to help him.</p><p>\u201cWhy\u2019d they jump you?\u201d The cop who\u2019d radioed in their information cast a level stare Colin\u2019s way.</p><p>Because I\u2019m getting too close. Colin shrugged. He had to be careful now. He couldn\u2019t very well reveal that the demons didn\u2019t like him sniffing around their territory.</p><p>Ah, but his presence had sure made someone nervous.</p><p>And that was good. Very good.</p><p>Emily crossed to his side. She\u2019d picked up her glasses, and she was rubbing the lenses against her shirt.</p><p>\u201cIs he still here?\u201d he asked her, pitching his voice low so that the patrolmen wouldn\u2019t hear him. She\u2019d said the watcher was a strong Other, and Colin wondered if the guy had stayed around to catch the rest of the show.</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cNo. He left right after the patrol got here.\u201d</p><p>Colin grunted. Figures. \u201cWell, Doc, looks like we\u2019ve managed to catch someone\u2019s attention.\u201d He flexed his fingers, feeling the newly healed flesh stretch lightly.</p><p>\u201cYes, I guess we did.\u201d She gazed at the dark end of the alley. \u201cAre we going to heed their warning?\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d put a nice, subtle emphasis on the we. \u201cWhat do you think?\u201d</p><p>She pushed her glasses onto her nose. \u201cI think I don\u2019t like it when jerks in black ski masks jump me in an alley.\u201d</p><p>He fought the curve of his lips. \u201cYeah, I don\u2019t like that too much either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI also think it\u2019s good that someone\u2019s nervous out there.\u201d She lifted her chin, still gazing into the darkness. \u201cIt means we\u2019re on the right track.\u201d</p><p>His lips tightened. \u201cIt\u2019s a dangerous track, Doc.\u201d And he didn\u2019t like her being in danger. When that bastard had put his hands around her throat\u2014</p><p>\u201cDespite what you think, Gyth, I\u2019m not some delicate flower.\u201d She finally looked at him. There was determination in her eyes\u2014</p><p>determination and, unless he was mistaken, excitement.</p><p>He realized the doc liked the thrill of danger. She enjoyed the hook of adrenaline that came from staring straight into fear.</p><p>Oh, but he could really like this woman.</p><p>\u201cNo, you aren\u2019t delicate,\u201d he agreed, remembering the way she\u2019d attacked the guy who\u2019d tried to jump him from behind. The bastard was probably still tasting his balls.</p><p>The doc was a hell of a lot stronger than he\u2019d originally thought, but the fact remained that she was human. And the guys who attacked him, the demons, they could easily kill her.</p><p>As for the shifter, the \u201cNight Butcher,\u201d well, he\u2019d be even worse. A human would never stand a chance against a guy like that.</p><p>Emily would never stand a chance.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not going to shut me out,\u201d Emily said, and he wondered for an instant if she\u2019d used her powers to read his mind. \u201cThreats from two-bit demons aren\u2019t going to make me run.\u201d</p><p>Threats might not, but what if those demons got ahold of her? What if they caught her when he wasn\u2019t around, when he couldn\u2019t protect her?</p><p>But she burned out a demon once, he reminded himself. She burned out the guy who\u2019d tried to attack her\u2014</p><p>And nearly wound up in a coma.</p><p>No, the doc wasn\u2019t cut out for fighting demons or shifters.</p><p>But she was in this thing now. The demons knew about her involvement.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s only going to get rougher from now on,\u201d he warned. The closer they got to the killer, the more dangerous the situation would become.</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d Simple, clear words. No hint of fear.</p><p>He held out his hand to her, palm up. She glanced down at his offered hand for a moment, her brows wrinkling. Then slowly, very slowly, she placed her palm against his.</p><p>His fingers instantly curled around hers. \u201cYou ready for everything that\u2019s going to happen?\u201d And he wasn\u2019t just talking about the case. About the danger. He was talking about them. About the hot tension he felt every second he was with her.</p><p>Emily gave a brief nod. \u201cYou\u2019re going to need me, every step of the way.\u201d</p><p>Oh, he didn\u2019t doubt that. His body was already hard with need for her. The leftover battle-ready tension still coursed through him.</p><p>But she was right about the case too. Whether he liked it or not\u2014and he most definitely did not\u2014he needed her special gift to unmask the killer.</p><p>Together, they\u2019d keep hunting the Night Butcher. Be partners, of a sort.</p><p>He\u2019d make absolutely certain he watched her back. At all times.</p><p>The uniforms were talking quietly behind them. The siren no longer blared into the night, but the blue and white lights still lit the alley with a swirl of color.</p><p>He wanted to get the doc alone. Wanted to get her out of that damn smelly alley. Wanted to get her home, where she\u2019d be safe.</p><p>Where he could hold her, strip her. Take her.</p><p>He\u2019d leashed the beast when the uniforms arrived. Managed to stop the shift. But the adrenaline in his body was running thick and hard through his veins, and it was feeding the monster. Making it stronger. Making it want, making it need...</p><p>Emily.</p><p>His fingers tightened around hers. It was definitely time to call it a night. While he still could. \u201cCome on,\u201d he muttered, \u201clet\u2019s get the hell out of here.\u201d They could talk to the cops more later.</p><p>Emily glanced back along the alley. A small shiver worked its way over her body. Colin fought the urge to pull her against him, to warm her, to hold her.</p><p>Don\u2019t want the uniforms to see me do that. Gossip spreads in the PD like wildfire.</p><p>\u201cThe other person I sensed\u2014\u201d Emily bit her lip for a moment. \u201cHe was strong, Colin. Very strong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas he a demon?\u201d She\u2019d mentioned Niol before. Had it been him? Had he been angry that they\u2019d invaded his precious club? Had he sent his errand boys to try and give them a scare?</p><p>\u201cYes. A level ten, at least.\u201d</p><p>Again with the levels. He still wasn\u2019t sure what that meant, but he figured there was no way being a level-ten demon could be a good thing. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He needed to learn more about the demon world, and he needed to learn fast.</p><p>Colin started walking toward his Jeep, pulling Emily along with him. He couldn\u2019t see his vehicle, and he sure hoped the demons hadn\u2019t trashed his ride.</p><p>\u201cHey, Detective Gyth, wait, we need to\u2014\u201d</p> <p>Colin threw a hard look over his shoulder. \u201cI\u2019ll call the station,\u201d he snapped, cutting across the uniform\u2019s words. They\u2019d been out in the open long enough. He wanted to get the doc to safety, and he wanted to get some answers from her.</p><p>\u201cWe need your statements, you just can\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I can.\u201d He kept walking. Giving a statement wasn\u2019t exactly his top priority right then. He needed to be careful what he revealed to the other cops. It wasn\u2019t like he could just say that a couple of demons had roughed him up.</p><p>The last time he\u2019d tried talking about the Other, his partner hadn\u2019t taken it well.</p><p>No, Mike hadn\u2019t taken the situation at all well.</p> <p>And when Colin had shifted, hoping to prove to his partner that his words were true, well, then things had truly gone to hell.</p><p>Because Mike, the guy who\u2019d watched his back on the street, the guy who\u2019d graduated by his side at the academy, had pulled his gun and tried to kill him.</p><p>Sometimes folks just didn\u2019t take well to the truth.</p><p>So lying was the only option.</p><p>It was a pity that a cop had to lie. But, well, lying was better than dying.</p><p>It was a philosophy that worked for him.</p> <p>They rounded the street corner. The Jeep was waiting, not a scratch on it.</p><p>Colin exhaled a rough sigh of relief. He opened the passenger door for Emily, ushering her inside. He wanted to get out of that neighborhood, fast.</p><p>But he\u2019d be back. He planned to come back and have a nice, long chat with Niol.</p><p>He didn\u2019t trust the demon, not for a minute.</p><p>Colin hurried around the Jeep and jumped inside. A patrol car cruised past him. Good. At least backup had arrived and they were searching for the perps.</p><p>Though it was doubtful they\u2019d find the bastards.</p><p>He drove quickly through the night. Traffic was slim, the streets dark. Emily sat quietly beside him, but he could practically feel the hum of her thoughts.</p><p>He turned off the interstate, took a left at the stoplight.</p> <p>\u201cWhat the hell are you doing?\u201d Emily had finally snapped out of her reverie. \u201cThis isn\u2019t the way to my house!\u201d</p><p>No, it wasn\u2019t. Colin shifted easily and kept driving. \u201cI\u2019m not taking you home tonight.\u201d It\u2019d be too dangerous. Those demons could be waiting for her.</p><p>Definitely not a risk he was willing to take.</p><p>Besides, he wanted her with him, wanted\u2014</p><p>\u201cThen where are you taking me?\u201d From the corner of his eye, he saw her fingers clenching around the door handle.</p><p>\u201cRelax, Doc.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere. Are. You. Taking. Me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe hell you are!\u201d He heard the faint scrape of her nails digging into the upholstery. \u201cTurn this Jeep around and take me home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry, Doc, no can do.\u201d Not that he wanted to, anyway. \u201cIn case you\u2019ve forgotten, there are demons after us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t forgotten\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd as an officer on the Atlanta PD, it\u2019s my responsibility to keep you safe.\u201d Oh, that sounded good. And it was true, mostly.</p><p>He did want to keep her safe.</p><p>He also wanted her.</p><p>So whether the doc liked it or not, she was going home with him.</p><p>And once they got to his place, well, what happened next would be entirely up to her.</p><p>Chapter 6</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re playing He-man again,\u201d Emily muttered as she paced in front of the fireplace. She would not admit, would not, that she actually liked his place. Liked the homey, relaxed feel of the wooden house.</p><p>Colin had gone all king-of-the-jungle on her again. Hadn\u2019t asked if she wanted to spend the night at his place. No, he\u2019d done the whole I\u2019m-a-man-I\u2019ll-keep-you-safe routine on her. It made her want to scream.</p><p>\u201cIn case you\u2019ve forgotten,\u201d she snapped, \u201cI saved your ass tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I saved yours.\u201d He was leaning against the fireplace mantel, his arms crossed over his chest. \u201cGuess that makes us even.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven?\u201d Not in her book. She hadn\u2019t kidnapped him.</p><p>\u201cRelax, Doc. You can go back to your nice house tomorrow. But I can\u2019t let you leave tonight. It\u2019s too dangerous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd it won\u2019t be dangerous tomorrow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTomorrow those bastards might not be on the street. The uniforms could pick them up tonight.\u201d He stared at her, his blue gaze hard and determined. \u201cGet used to the idea, Doc; you\u2019re staying here.\u201d</p><p>If she wanted, she could leave. She could stomp out of the house, use her cell phone, and call for a taxi to take her home. She didn\u2019t have to listen to Colin, but...dammit, he was right. It was safer for her to stay at his place for the night. Until they found out who\u2019d sent those goons after them, it made sense to stick together, but she didn\u2019t have to like the situation.</p><p>And she definitely didn\u2019t like the idea of staying at Colin\u2019s house, alone with him.</p><p>Her heart was beating too fast, and a tight ball had lodged in her stomach from the moment she\u2019d realized where Colin was taking her.</p><p>What would happen? What did she want to happen?</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you make yourself comfortable, Doc?\u201d Colin inclined his head toward the couch. \u201cI\u2019ve got to go clean up.\u201d Then he was gone, disappearing down the hallway, quietly shutting a door behind him.</p><p>Emily frowned. The man had nearly ran from the room. Pretty much mid-argument. That was odd.</p><p>\u201cColin?\u201d She stepped toward the hallway. The wooden floor creaked beneath her. \u201cColin, are you all right?\u201d Now that she thought about it, there had been a tension on his face. And he\u2019d looked the slightest bit pale.</p><p>He just fought off four men. It stands to reason the man would look pale and tense.</p><p>She crept forward. \u201cColin?\u201d</p><p>A nagging worry filled her. What if he was hurt? Trying to hide his wounds?</p><p>She could hear the rush of running water. Emily paused next to a white door. The bathroom, she figured. She didn\u2019t want to burst in if nothing were wrong, but...</p><p>Something isn\u2019t right. Her instincts were on high alert. Her fingers curled around the doorknob. \u201cCan you hear me?\u201d</p><p>He jerked the door open. Stood gazing down at her, his chest bare, red water dripping from his fingers.</p><p>Red water. Blood. \u201cOh God, you\u2019re hurt!\u201d</p><p>Colin stepped back, shoved his hands under the pouring water that sprayed from the faucet.</p><p>\u201cColin?\u201d She grabbed his arm. Felt his muscles tense. \u201cDammit, where are you hurt?\u201d</p><p>His hands clenched beneath the water. \u201cThe blood\u2019s not mine.\u201d</p><p>Not his? Emily yanked his hands up, stared at the now-glistening fingers. There wasn\u2019t so much as a scratch on him.</p><p>She looked up, gazing into his eyes. He was close to her, so close that the warmth of his body surrounded her. Her eyes fell to his chest. Bare. Strong. Tight, with hard muscles. Covered with a light coating of midnight black hair.</p><p>Emily swallowed and realized that she was still holding his hands. Realized that her fingers had begun to stroke the back of his palms.</p><p>Realized that she wanted him.</p><p>Following Colin had been a mistake. \u201cI-I should let you\u2014\u201d Do what? Finish stripping? The mental image that immediately flashed through her mind sent a wave of heat spiraling between her thighs. \u201cUmm, I\u2019ll wait in the den.\u201d She was definitely sex deprived.</p><p>One look at a man\u2019s chest and she was reduced to a stuttering mess.</p><p>Emily forced her hands to release his. The water still flowed behind her, and the sound seemed strangely loud in the small room.</p><p>She stepped to the side, intending to go, to collect her lost dignity as best she could.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t run from me, Doc.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI-I\u2019m not running.\u201d Just walking\u2014okay, creeping\u2014away from the half-naked man who was making her very, very nervous.</p><p>His hands lifted, curled around the frames of her glasses, then slowly lifted them off her.</p><p>Emily blinked, trying to adjust her eyes to the sudden change. Colin stared down at her, and his eyes\u2014they were filled with hunger.</p><p>For her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to do it this time, Doc.\u201d He was staring at her lips now. Gazing at her with those hot, shining blue eyes.</p><p>Was it her imagination or were his eyes really, really bright right then?</p><p>His words registered after a heartbeat of time, and she didn\u2019t understand. \u201cDo what?\u201d</p><p>His arms snaked out, caught her around the middle, and pulled her ever closer to his body. She was trapped now, caged between the bathroom sink and Colin\u2019s equally hard body.</p><p>\u201cKiss you.\u201d He leaned forward, and his breath blew lightly against her. \u201cI\u2019m not going to kiss you. Unless you ask.\u201d</p><p>His lips were so close to hers. So close. But she hadn\u2019t come into the bathroom for this, hadn\u2019t followed him inside because she wanted him, had she?</p><p>\u201cCome on, Doc. It won\u2019t be as hard as you think.\u201d There was nowhere for her to go, but Emily still tried to stumble back. She slipped against the edge of the sink.</p><p>Colin caught her before she fell. Lifted her up, sat her on the cold, granite vanity. Her legs were spread, and he inched forward, pushing right between them. The thick length of his aroused flesh pressed against her. The hard muscles of his thighs seemed to burn Emily through her clothing. She squirmed against him, and instead of working herself free, she just rubbed against him, rubbed against that heavy arousal.</p><p>Her sex clenched as a wave of raw hunger rocked through her. No, this isn\u2019t what I planned.</p><p>But it was exactly what she wanted.</p><p>\u201cDo it.\u201d His voice was a rough rumble of temptation. His fingers were locked around her waist. She wanted him to lift his hands and cup her breasts. To push her shirt aside and take her nipples into his mouth.</p><p>\u201cAsk for my kiss...\u201d His breath blew against her lips.</p><p>She could already taste him. Her lips trembled, parted, and she heard herself whisper, \u201cKiss me.\u201d But she wasn\u2019t asking. She was demanding.</p><p>For an instant, his lips curled in a satisfied smile, but then the hunger in his eyes flared even brighter. His fingers tightened around her.</p><p>And his lips claimed hers.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t gentle. He wasn\u2019t cautious.</p><p>His lips took. His tongue probed, drove deep into her mouth. He tasted, seduced, claimed.</p><p>A growl sounded low in his throat. The sound was stark, animalistic. It should have scared her. He should have scared her.</p><p>But the sound just made her hotter. Made the liquid heat between her thighs pulse even more.</p><p>Her hands were wrapped around his arms, digging into the tight muscles of his biceps. Her mouth was open wide, her tongue rubbing, thrusting against his.</p><p>She loved the way he kissed her. Hard. Hot. Wild. Yes, most definitely wild.</p><p>He kissed her like he couldn\u2019t wait to get her naked beneath him. Kissed her like he had to have her.</p><p>Kissed her like no other man ever had.</p><p>His fingers brushed against the underside of her breasts. They rose slowly, then his hands were cupping her, his thumbs brushing against her nipples.</p><p>His mouth continued to feed on hers. His fingers\u2014long, strong fingers\u2014stroked her breasts, teased the aching peaks of her nipples.</p><p>She tore her mouth from his, moaning softly. She was still sitting on the sink. Her legs were spread wide. His thick arousal pushed against her. Her fingers itched to touch him, to stroke him.</p><p>This isn\u2019t like me. Emily fought to regain her control in the maelstrom of lust that was overwhelming her. She wasn\u2019t one to be driven wild with passion. Not her. Never her.</p><p>She was the calm one, the controlled one, the six-dates-before-third-base one.</p><p>But there was something about Colin, something that was driving straight past her barriers.</p><p>\u201cI want to feel you,\u201d he muttered, the words hard, nearly indistinct. He caught the hem of her shirt, jerked it up and over her head.</p><p>Colin tossed the shirt onto the floor. She heard the soft swish as it hit the tiled floor.</p><p>He was touching her now. Skin to skin. His warm fingers, slightly rough, were smoothing up her abdomen, inching closer to her breasts.</p><p>A thin black bra covered her. Her breasts pushed against the silky fabric.</p><p>Colin licked his lips.</p><p>Emily knew she should stop him. The logical part of her mind was screaming at her to push him away.</p><p>Not the time. Not the time.</p><p>Things were moving too fast between them. But, God, she wanted him to touch her.</p><p>She wanted to let go of her control for just a moment. She wanted to feel.</p><p>Yes, part of her was screaming that she should push him away, but part of her was also demanding that she pull him even closer.</p><p>His fingers slipped under the edge of her bra. Stroked, then found her nipples. The nubs were tight, hungry, and when he shoved the bra to the side and lifted her breasts in his hands, she could see the dark pink of her aroused flesh.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got to taste you.\u201d</p><p>His head lowered toward her breast. His mouth opened; she felt the hot stir of his breath against her, then his tongue, God, his tongue swirled around the areola. A long, teasing lick that had every muscle in her body tightening.</p><p>\u201cOh, that\u2019s good.\u201d He drew in a deep breath, then his tongue rubbed against her nipple. \u201cDamn good.\u201d He took her breast into his mouth, sucking strongly, drawing the peak deep inside and using his tongue, his teeth.</p><p>Her hands rose, fisted in his hair. She pulled him tighter to her, loving the demanding pull of his mouth. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Her hips were rocking against his cock. Riding him. She could feel a warm wetness on her panties. Damn. When was the last time she\u2019d gotten turned on like this? So fast?</p><p>Never.</p><p>His left hand lifted, lightly pinched her nipple while his mouth kept working her other breast.</p> <p>Oh Jesus.</p><p>She squeezed her thighs around him.</p><p>A hard coil of tension tightened inside her.</p><p>Colin lifted his head. Her fingers were still buried in the thick, black mane of his hair.</p><p>He kissed her, thrust his tongue deep. His right hand gripped her thigh, his fingers so close to her mound that she trembled in anticipation.</p> <p>The drumming of her heartbeat filled her ears. Her breathing was coming hard and fast. Her body felt too hot, too tight.</p><p>And she realized with a sense of dazed shock that she was moments away from having sex with Colin.</p><p>His lips were glistening. And behind his lips, just for a moment, she caught a glimpse of...fangs?</p><p>Fangs?</p><p>She yanked her hands away from him.</p><p>\u201cYou want me,\u201d he rumbled, and she saw his nostrils flare. \u201cI can smell your need.\u201d</p> <p>Not the most flattering comment, but one that was damn true. She did want him. Wanted him so much she\u2019d soaked her panties.</p><p>Wanted him so much that she was minutes, hell, maybe even seconds away from coming.</p><p>Emily glanced down at her legs. His hands were on both thighs now, the warm weight of his fingers seeming to scorch her through her pants.</p><p>His nails...they looked longer than before. Sharper.</p><p>Of course they look longer. The man\u2019s a shifter, for God\u2019s sake. You know the beast likes to play during sex.</p><p>The beast was always close to the surface during sex. That was why shifters were so notoriously sexual.</p><p>She was about to have sex with a shifter. A shifter she still knew damn little about.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll make it good for you, Doc.\u201d Colin growled the words as he lowered his head to her neck. She felt the rough rasp of his tongue on her throat, and a shiver skated over her. Oh yeah, it\u2019d be good between us. I don\u2019t doubt it.</p> <p>His mouth pressed against her, the sharp edge of his teeth grazing her skin.</p><p>\u201cStop!\u201d Damn, but that word had been hard to say. And instead of coming out as a shout, it sounded as a hoarse whisper.</p><p>Colin froze.</p><p>Emily drew in her breath, held it. Her body was still screaming for release, but her mind had finally taken control again.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t do this, not yet. There was too much she didn\u2019t know about the detective.</p><p>His hands tightened around her thighs. \u201cYou sure that\u2019s what you want?\u201d His voice was gravelly, hard with lust and need.</p><p>She wanted him to drive that long, thick cock into her. She wanted to shut off her mind and just feel.</p><p>It was too late now. The voice of reason in her head was screaming at her, and she couldn\u2019t ignore the voice. Dammit.</p><p>The last time she\u2019d ignored that little voice, she\u2019d fallen for the wrong man and ended up unconscious on the floor of Paradise Found. Then she\u2019d had a not-so-nice two-week stint in the hospital.</p><p>Colin was just as strong as Myles, she\u2019d bet her life on it. Shifters didn\u2019t have demon levels, but they had their own power scale.</p><p>She\u2019d seen the way he\u2019d taken down the demons who attacked them.</p><p>And when a guy was that strong, he was also very, very dangerous.</p><p>Her hands pushed between them. She crossed her arms over her chest, covering her breasts.</p><p>Colin drew in a long, hard breath. A muscle flexed along his jaw, and she saw the struggle for control flash in his eyes.</p><p>After one moment, two, he lifted his hands, stepped back.</p><p>\u201cLike to tease, do you, Doc?\u201d</p><p>His words lashed right to her heart. They should have pissed her off, but she knew that he was right. She had teased. Gotten them both ready, minutes from release, then pulled back. Emily wrenched her bra into place. \u201cThings got\u201d\u2014 wild, hot\u2014\u201cout of control.\u201d</p><p>Colin\u2019s hand ran through his hair.</p><p>Emily slid off the sink. Water was still pouring behind her. With slightly shaking fingers, she jerked the handle, stopping the flow.</p><p>\u201cYou wanted me.\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t very well deny that. She\u2019d been clawing the man, moaning, rubbing her body against his.</p><p>\u201cYou still want me.\u201d His knuckles grazed down her bare arm. \u201cDon\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Emily lifted her chin. \u201cSometimes we don\u2019t get what we want.\u201d Because what we want may not be good for us.</p><p>She swallowed, fought to hold tight to her own newly found control. How could she hunger so much for someone that she feared?</p><p>\u201cSometimes we do.\u201d But his hand dropped away. \u201cSometimes all it takes is a little waiting.\u201d</p><p>Emily scooped up her shirt. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean for things to go so far.\u201d So fast. She hadn\u2019t realized need would explode with the touch of his lips, his hands, against her.</p><p>\u201cThen how far did you mean for them to go?\u201d It was then that she heard the icy edge in his voice that alerted her to his rage.</p><p>Well, hell, what had she expected? That the guy would be all thrilled that she\u2019d stopped their lovemaking? Not likely. She jerked on her shirt.</p><p>\u201cTell me, Doc. I really want to know.\u201d He rolled his shoulders back, and the muscles in his chest rippled. \u201cHow far did you want to go? A few kisses? A few feels through your clothes? One lick on your breast?\u201d</p><p>A flash of heat stained her cheeks. Oh yes, Colin was definitely pissed.</p><p>\u201cSo I\u2019m good enough for a little light play but not good enough for a fuck?\u201d</p><p>Okay, enough was enough. Emily\u2019s eyes narrowed on him. \u201cI don\u2019t know you well enough for a fuck, Detective.\u201d She sure as hell didn\u2019t go around giving those out to strangers.</p><p>His lips thinned.</p><p>\u201cAnd for the record, I\u2019m not a first-date-screw type of woman.\u201d Despite what she\u2019d just done. Emily shook her head. \u201cI want you, yes, I won\u2019t deny it, but I\u2019m not screwing you tonight.\u201d No, she wasn\u2019t about to make herself that vulnerable to him, not until\u2014</p><p>\u201cSonofabitch.\u201d Understanding flashed across his face. \u201cYou\u2019re scared of me.\u201d</p><p>Not of him so much as what he was. Time to cut to the chase. \u201cWhat kind of shifter are you, Colin?\u201d He had claws, sharp teeth.</p><p>She\u2019d seen both of those telling changes. Ruled out snakes. And it hadn\u2019t been the look of a bird or even a bear.</p><p>His hands fisted at his sides. \u201cSo that\u2019s what this is about. You don\u2019t want to screw a shifter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Her back teeth were beginning to ache from the whole grinding exercise she was doing. \u201cIt\u2019s not that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t it?\u201d There was a sharp bite to his words. \u201cYou\u2019ve been acting skittish around me from the moment we met, from the moment you realized what I was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not saying no because you\u2019re a shifter.\u201d Confession time. \u201cI\u2019ve actually been with a shifter before.\u201d The affair had been very, very brief and back when she\u2019d been a grad student.</p><p>\u201cThen what the hell is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going too fast!\u201d Everything was going too fast. \u201cI just met you a few days ago and\u2014\u201d Damn, why stop now? \u201cI\u2019m not sure I can trust you, Gyth. Shifters have a reputation.\u201d Some would say a very well-deserved reputation. \u201cAnd while I don\u2019t know what beast you carry, I think he\u2019s strong, and he\u2019s dangerous. And before I crawl into bed with you, I want to know more about what\u2019s going on in your head.\u201d And in the head of the beast you carry.</p><p>Because there was a chance, a very definite chance, that Colin was one of the shifters that folks knew to give a very wide berth. A panther. A cougar. A wolf.</p><p>\u201cYou wanna know me?\u201d The force of his feelings, his anger, his need, his...fear, lapped at her. \u201cThen why don\u2019t you just take a peek inside my mind?\u201d</p><p>Oh, she was tempted. It would be so easy. But...</p><p>It would also be wrong. Because once she stepped inside his mind, she wouldn\u2019t get a glimpse of just his life. No, if she went in, fully in, she\u2019d see everything. Every secret. Every lie. Every fear. Everything.</p><p>And she didn\u2019t think that either of them were ready for that.</p><p>Emily shook her head. \u201cThat\u2019s not the way for us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what is the way?\u201d</p><p>She stared up into his eyes. \u201cTo take some time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit.\u201d His hands slowly unfurled. \u201cI\u2019m not good at being a gentleman, Doc.\u201d</p><p>Yes, she\u2019d rather figured that one out already.</p><p>\u201cBut I\u2019ll do it.\u201d He reached out, stroked her cheek. \u201cFor now.\u201d The rage had dimmed in his eyes, but the hunger remained.</p><p>His hand felt so warm against her.</p><p>His fingers trailed over her lips. \u201cJust don\u2019t make me wait too long. I won\u2019t be a gentleman forever.\u201d Then he stepped back, clearing her way.</p><p>Emily snagged her glasses, drew in a deep breath, and was immediately wrapped in his rich, masculine scent. \u201cWh-where should I sleep?\u201d Jesus, she was stuttering like some kind of schoolgirl.</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019d hoped you\u2019d sleep with me.\u201d Yes, that was another point she\u2019d managed to figure out on her own.</p><p>\u201cBut since I\u2019m not...\u201d Her brows lifted as she stared meaningfully up at him.</p><p>His lips hitched into a half smile. \u201cSince you\u2019re not, you can take the bed and I\u2019ll take the couch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow. You are trying to be a gentleman, aren\u2019t you? I\u2019m impressed.\u201d And she was also planning to jump on his offer. Bed versus couch. She\u2019d definitely be selfish and take the cushy choice.</p><p>Emily brushed by him.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the second door on the right, Doc.\u201d His hand slipped down her back, rested for the briefest of moments on the curve of her buttocks. \u201cHave good dreams.\u201d</p><p>Since her dreams would probably all be about him, and he\u2019d be naked in them, she figured her dreams would definitely be good, if extremely frustrating.</p><p>It was going to be a long night.</p><p>And she didn\u2019t even have dry panties to change into. Talk about sucking.</p><p>He gazed up at the doctor\u2019s house. All of the windows were black. Had been black all night.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t come home. He\u2019d waited for her, waited hours to see her, and she hadn\u2019t come home.</p><p>Where was she? Where?</p><p>A slow rage had been building inside of him. Building, building...</p><p>The demon was out tonight. She was somewhere in the city, working her evil.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t let her continue. Couldn\u2019t let her keep attacking innocents.</p><p>He would stop her.</p><p>Evil had to be destroyed.</p><p>She had to be destroyed.</p><p>Soon. The doctor\u2019s time would run out.</p><p>The demon would die.</p><p>Chapter 7</p><p>\u201cI think it\u2019s time for an Other 101 lesson.\u201d</p><p>Emily glanced up from her files, brows raised, as Colin walked into her office.</p><p>Vanessa stood behind him, a rather sheepish expression on her face. \u201cSorry, boss, but when he found out you weren\u2019t with a client\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI decided to let myself in.\u201d He flashed her a smile and strolled toward the couch. \u201cWe need to talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that is what most people do when they come here,\u201d she murmured. She looked back at Vanessa, certain her assistant had heard the Other 101 comment. Since Vanessa was Other, a hereditary witch, she figured it didn\u2019t really matter. Vanessa had been with her for five years, and Emily trusted her to keep quiet about the cases and people in her office. \u201cIt\u2019s all right, Vanessa. I can talk to the detective for a few minutes.\u201d Until her twelve o\u2019clock arrived, anyway.</p><p>Vanessa\u2019s eyes narrowed, and Emily realized she wasn\u2019t quite as taken with Mr. Sexy Voice as she\u2019d been when he\u2019d called on the phone.</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d Vanessa\u2019s plump lips had little white lines around them. \u201cBut next time\u201d\u2014she jabbed an index finger in the air toward him\u2014</p><p>\u201che\u2019d better wait until I escort him inside.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry.\u201d Colin looked anything but.</p><p>Vanessa spun on her heel and marched out, shutting the door smartly behind her.</p><p>Perhaps a mild warning was in order here. After all, the man had come asking for information on the Other. \u201cIf I were you, I probably wouldn\u2019t make her angry.\u201d</p><p>He lowered himself onto the sofa. The leather creaked beneath his weight. \u201cCause she\u2019s a witch?\u201d</p><p>Emily blinked. How had he\u2014</p><p>Colin laughed. \u201cDon\u2019t look so shocked, Doc. I might not have your handy little gift, but I am a detective. Trained to observe.\u201d He winked. \u201cAnd I observed her reading a spell book when I walked inside the lobby.\u201d</p><p>Mental note. Tell Vanessa to keep her private reading material at home.</p><p>She cleared her throat. \u201cJust what is it that you want to know?\u201d She was trying to keep things professional between them, trying hard despite the fact that she\u2019d awoken less than five hours ago to find him standing at the foot of her bed\u2014 his bed\u2014wearing only a towel wrapped low on his hips and gazing at her with lust in his eyes.</p><p>She shifted her legs beneath the desk, feeling warmth rush through her at the memory. He\u2019d told her he\u2019d come inside for some clothes. But she could tell he\u2019d wanted more than clothing. The thick bulge of his arousal would have clued in even the most naive of women.</p><p>And after a night of dreaming about him, she\u2019d wanted more, too.</p><p>But Colin had turned away from her, grabbed a handful of clothes from his closet, then disappeared.</p><p>He\u2019d taken her home less than thirty minutes later, and after he\u2019d done a thorough check of her house, he\u2019d left her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He\u2019d kissed her, then he\u2019d left her. A hard, swift kiss that she could still feel.</p><p>\u201cSo this is where the magic happens, huh?\u201d He wasn\u2019t lying on the couch, but sitting up, hands draped over his knees.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t necessarily think of it as magic,\u201d she said carefully. Magic was a word generally reserved for the Other. They had magical powers. She was just a human who had a high psychic sensitivity to the Other.</p> <p>\u201cUmm.\u201d He cocked his head to the side. \u201cTell me about them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThem?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Other.\u201d His eyes never left hers. \u201cI realized last night that I know damn little about\u201d\u2014a brief hesitation, then\u2014\u201cmy kind. And that lack of knowledge could get me into some serious shit.\u201d</p><p>Ah, yes, it could. \u201cYou\u2019ve known others like yourself before, of course?\u201d She\u2019d figured it\u2019d be better if they started with something he knew. They could begin with shifters and then build from there.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve met a few others. Haven\u2019t exactly had deep meaningful conversations with \u2019em, if you know what I mean. And I\u2019ve seen some vamps, a few demons\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201d The pen she\u2019d absently picked up fell from her fingers. Haven\u2019t exactly had deep meaningful conversations? He made it sound as if other shifters were as foreign to him as vampires. \u201cBut your parents\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey died when I was a couple of months old.\u201d He shrugged as if it didn\u2019t matter to him, as if it were just some random event that had happened long ago and didn\u2019t have any meaning to him now. \u201cI got put in foster care after that.\u201d</p><p>Her breath rushed out in a fast expulsion. \u201cWhat did you think was happening the first time you changed?\u201d To shift without someone around for guidance, God, it must have been a nightmare.</p><p>He turned his head. Gazed out the window. \u201cI thought I was dying.\u201d</p><p>Emily said nothing. Just waited.</p><p>\u201cMy bones snapped, twisted.\u201d His lips thinned. \u201cDo you know what it\u2019s like to hear the crunch of your own bones?\u201d</p> <p>No, she didn\u2019t. \u201cB-but I didn\u2019t think the change was painful.\u201d She\u2019d been told it sometimes felt like a mild sunburn spreading through a person\u2019s body.</p><p>\u201cThe first time it is. Damn painful. Like your insides are exploding. Everything reshapes, transforms. My nails changed first, grew into claws. Then my teeth\u2014they got sharper, longer. Then the fur grew.\u201d Colin stopped, shaking his head. He looked back at her, and she could see the painful shadows of his past in the depths of his eyes. \u201cI tried to call for help, but by that time I didn\u2019t have a human\u2019s voice anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnce you\u2019d changed, how did you feel then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike a freak.\u201d</p><p>Emily grabbed her pad, began jotting notes by rote. Traumatic first shift. No knowledge of his kind.</p><p>\u201cI was an animal.\u201d His jaw clenched tight. \u201cI didn\u2019t know what the hell had happened to me or how the hell I was going to change back. And for a while I thought...\u201d</p><p>Her pen was poised over the pad. \u201cWhat did you think?\u201d</p><p>His eyes narrowed, dropped to the pen and paper. \u201cI\u2019m not one of your patients, Doc. I don\u2019t need an analysis.\u201d</p> <p>Her fingers tightened around the cool metal base of the ballpoint pen. \u201cI thought you might want to talk about\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout what? My screwed-up childhood? The ten foster homes I lived in? The first time I changed into a damn animal and thought I was going insane?\u201d</p><p>Actually, yes. The pen scribbled across the pad. Feared insanity. Serious hostility issues.</p><p>\u201cEmily.\u201d</p><p>She froze. Lifted her head to stare at him.</p><p>Colin rose and stalked toward her. He leaned over her desk, bracing his hands on the old wood. \u201cI don\u2019t need you to poke around in my past and figure out why\u2014\u201d For a moment, his gaze dropped to the pad and his lips tightened as he said, \u201cI\u2019ve got hostility issues.\u201d</p><p>She decided it would be best not to point out right then that he was definitely exhibiting said hostility issues. So she tried to be tactful. \u201cSome people think the key to a successful future is facing a painful past.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen those people are fucking idiots. A painful past needs to be shoved in a cold, dark grave and left to rot.\u201d</p><p>Well, that was one perspective. Very carefully, Emily placed her pen down. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have started to\u2014\u201d She broke off, clearing her throat, and realized that she was embarrassed.</p><p>Slipping into psychologist mode was second nature to her. And Colin\u2019s pain, it had just called out to her. She licked her lips, tried again, \u201cI shouldn\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShouldn\u2019t have started screwing with my head?\u201d</p><p>Her eyes narrowed. \u201cI wasn\u2019t screwing with your head, as you so kindly put it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLady, you make a living screwing with people\u2019s minds.\u201d He leaned forward another inch.</p><p>She didn\u2019t like the way he was towering over her. Asserting his dominance. Showing that he was the big, strong detective and she was the psychologist who needed to mind her own business.</p><p>Her own temper began to spark. Emily shoved to her feet. \u201cI was trying to help you, Gyth. In case you haven\u2019t noticed, you\u2019re carrying around a hell of a lot of baggage.\u201d And rage. Lots of rage.</p><p>She placed her hands deliberately on the table and leaned into him. Close enough to kiss. Or hit. And she was very tempted to do both.</p><p>Colin stared back at her, those crystal blue eyes of his glinting with emotion. \u201cI told you about my past because I was talking to you, Emily Drake. Not the Monster Doctor.\u201d</p><p>Understanding filled her. \u201cIt\u2019s hard for me to stop being the Monster Doctor.\u201d Her voice was softer. She\u2019d been working with the Other for so long, trying to heal their minds, and she\u2019d nearly forgotten how to turn off the doctor.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re way off topic,\u201d he muttered, and stepped back, rolling his shoulders. \u201cI didn\u2019t come here to drag up my shitty childhood.\u201d</p><p>Emily licked her lips and realized that she\u2019d very nearly screwed things up with Colin. She needed to think more like a woman with him and less like a psychologist. \u201cRight. Sorry.\u201d And she was. Sorry that she\u2019d pressured him, sorry that she\u2019d tried to make him into a patient.</p><p>\u201cJust don\u2019t try it again, Doc.\u201d</p><p>That she couldn\u2019t promise. \u201cLook, Colin, it\u2019s kinda hard to turn off, you know?\u201d He\u2019d been on her couch, in her office, and when he\u2019d started talking she\u2019d slipped into counselor mode.</p><p>\u201cTry.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes narrowed. \u201cI\u2019ll see what I can do, and, hey, how about you try not to be such a jerk?\u201d</p><p>He blinked, obviously caught off guard by the insult she\u2019d just delivered in her soft, I\u2019m-a-Professional voice.</p><p>Then he tossed back his head and laughed.</p><p>Emily fought the smile that curved her lips. Good. Looked like they were back on even ground.</p><p>\u201cAgreed.\u201d Colin strolled around her office, eyeing her bookshelves and the framed Rorschach inkblot pictures on her walls.</p><p>After a few moments, he said, \u201cI need to know about them. Need to know what I\u2019m gonna be dealing with.\u201d</p><p>Yes, she understood that. Colin was ill prepared to deal with the world of the Other, especially considering his own rough introduction to the Other world. But before she could begin his lessons, there were a few other questions that she needed to ask.</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019ve come across other shifters?\u201d All of the Other were born with an instinctive ability to recognize their own kind. Demons saw through the veil of glamour to other demons. Shifters could scent one another, thanks to their heightened sense of smell.</p><p>Witches and wizards felt the power pull of their brethren.</p><p>Like to like. It was the way it had always been.</p><p>And for whatever reason, Emily had been born with the ability to sense them all. Even though she wasn\u2019t kindred to any of them.</p><p>Colin touched the spine of one of her books. \u201cYeah, I have. Once or twice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could...smell them, right? Smell the difference between a shifter and a human?\u201d As far as she knew, shifters didn\u2019t see the beasts they carried. They didn\u2019t know about the golden glow that cloaked their bodies. It was just something she saw.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I can smell \u2019em.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cWe all smell like animals.\u201d</p><p>Her nose wrinkled at that. She rather liked the way Colin smelled.</p><p>\u201cWell, all the Other have a way of sensing their kind. Demons can look through the glamour and see the black eyes that mark them, witches feel a surge of power in the air when another is close, djinn can hear the thoughts of others like them, charmers can\u2014\u201d</p><p>He glanced back at her, a black brow raised. \u201cWhat\u2019s a charmer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve heard of snake charmers, right?\u201d</p><p>Colin nodded. \u201cBig in India. Those guys who carry around cobras in baskets.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d Well, partially right. \u201cCharmers are beings who can communicate with certain animals. They can talk to them.\u201d Some charmers talked to snakes, some to birds, some to dogs or cats.</p><p>\u201cJust how many types of Other exist?\u201d</p><p>Oh, now that was a hard one. \u201cThink of every legend of every magical being you\u2019ve ever heard and then imagine all those stories are true. Then you\u2019ve got the Other. \u201d Hundreds, thousands of types. Some kind and benevolent. Some downright evil and dangerous.</p><p>Just like humans.</p><p>\u201cThis city seems to have more than its share of supernaturals. When I lived in Grisam, Illinois, there weren\u2019t any others like me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, yes, but if you\u2019d gone to Chicago, you would have found dozens of SBs.\u201d They liked the big cities. Loved them, in fact.</p><p>\u201cThink about it, Colin. Where is it easier to hide? In small-town America, where your neighbors know every move you make? Or would you want to go to a big city where\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could disappear into a crowd and no one would give a shit what you were doing,\u201d Colin finished for her.</p><p>\u201cExactly.\u201d She waited a bit and then, because she really couldn\u2019t help herself, asked, \u201cIsn\u2019t that why you came here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, yeah, I guess it is.\u201d He ran a hand through his hair. \u201cLet\u2019s talk about the demons first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want to know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re fast healers, right?\u201d At the slight inclination of her head, he continued, \u201cWhat\u2019s the deal with the power-level thing you keep mentioning? Level one, level two\u2014what does that mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDemons can work magic, just like witches can. A low-level demon, a one or a two, can do small things, like light a candle or make a breeze blow through a room. But a level nine or ten\u201d\u2014this was the bad part, the very bad part\u2014\u201cthey can stir tornadoes, start five-alarm fires, and even steal the minds of others.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? \u201d He paced toward her, brows furrowed. \u201cYou\u2019re telling me those bastards can control humans?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSometimes.\u201d That was how the idea of demon possession had first come into being. \u201cIf a demon is strong enough, he can push his way into someone\u2019s mind, can control the person or, at the least, incapacitate him.\u201d</p><p>Colin walked around her desk, came to stand less than a foot away from her. \u201cIs that what happened to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWh-what do you mean?\u201d There was a faint line of stubble on his jaw. And far too much knowledge in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cYou told me you were nearly put into a coma once by an Other. The guy who did it, he was a demon, wasn\u2019t he? One of those level nines or tens.\u201d</p><p>No sense denying it. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>She watched a muscle flex along his jaw. \u201cWhere is he now?\u201d There was a banked rage in his voice, and for an instant, she saw the glow of the beast in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter. That was years ago.\u201d And Myles couldn\u2019t hurt anyone with his magic, not anymore. \u201cI told you before, he burned out.\u201d She\u2019d burned out the bastard.</p><p>\u201cWould his powers have worked on me?\u201d Before she could answer, he continued, \u201cNiol tried something on me back at the bar. I could feel the hard shift in the air, but nothing happened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Shifters were the most powerful of the supernatural beings because they didn\u2019t have just one body and one soul. Shifters had two. And the strength that came from that double bond was too strong for demons to touch. \u201cA powerful shifter is the only Other that can match a demon\u2019s strength.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s something then.\u201d His jaw clenched, and for a moment his eyes seemed to glitter. \u201cHow the fuck did you meet a guy like that anyway?\u201d</p><p>Emily swallowed. She\u2019d wondered when he\u2019d ask. And since she\u2019d pushed her way into his private life earlier, well, she figured he deserved to know about her past too.</p><p>\u201cWas he your lover?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cNo, he was\u2014\u201d Damn. What had he been? \u201cAll my life, I\u2019ve never fit in with the humans. They don\u2019t understand me, and I doubt they ever will.\u201d</p><p>He watched her silently, and she knew that he understood.</p><p>\u201cWhen I was eighteen, I stumbled into Niol\u2019s bar, pulled by the magic I could feel in the air. He knew I was human, of course, but he let me in. I think I amused him.\u201d And he\u2019d watched her, always watched her with those fathomless black eyes of his.</p><p>\u201cNiol was the one who introduced me to Myles.\u201d She\u2019d felt the black waves of Niol\u2019s power right from the start, and she\u2019d generally steered clear of him. After he\u2019d arranged for her to meet Myles, well, then she\u2019d known what a true bastard Niol was. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Colin stiffened. \u201cMyles?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe charming demon who attacked me at Paradise.\u201d</p><p>His hands fisted.</p> <p>\u201cYou know, sometimes I wonder about that. Sometimes I think...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat Niol was testing me.\u201d Emily shook her head. \u201cBut that doesn\u2019t really make sense, does it?\u201d Yet it was a suspicion she couldn\u2019t shake. Niol had casually introduced Myles to her one night as she\u2019d stood, swaying to the music of the band. Every night she\u2019d gone back to Paradise, Myles had been there, waiting for her. Always kind. Always the gentleman.</p><p>Until the night he\u2019d attacked her.</p><p>And Niol had been watching from the shadows.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think a hell of a lot about that bastard Niol makes sense.\u201d</p><p>Yes, he was probably right.</p><p>The alarm on her wrist began to vibrate. Emily exhaled heavily. Time for her twelve o\u2019clock with Margie.</p><p>Colin frowned and the faint lines around his eyes deepened. \u201cWhat in the hell is that?\u201d</p><p>Good old shifter hearing. Emily held up her arm. \u201cMy alarm. It\u2019s time for my next patient.\u201d And she was glad. It was a reprieve, of sorts, for her.</p><p>\u201cIn other words, you mean it\u2019s time for me to leave.\u201d Some of the tension faded from his expression, and his lips hitched into a half smile. \u201cThat\u2019s fine, Doc. I\u2019ll see you tonight.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d His hand lifted, cupped her cheek. \u201cWhen I come over.\u201d</p><p>Her stomach tightened. In anticipation, not fear. \u201cI don\u2019t remember inviting you over.\u201d</p><p>Colin\u2019s head lowered toward hers. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to finish our lesson.\u201d</p><p>Other 101. \u201cUmm, right.\u201d</p><p>One black brow rose. \u201cIs that disappointment I hear?\u201d</p><p>She flushed. Way to be transparent. \u201cI\u2014\u201d</p><p>His lips brushed against hers. Warm. Wet. Open.</p> <p>God, but she liked the way he kissed. Liked the slow thrust of his tongue into her mouth. And the man tasted good. Like rich chocolate, and she\u2019d always been a serious sucker for chocolate.</p><p>He pulled away slowly. \u201cYou know, Doc, I\u2019m glad as hell to know that you weren\u2019t Niol\u2019s lover.\u201d</p><p>So was she.</p><p>\u201cAnd now that I\u2019ve been in your office, I\u2019m going to have fantasies.\u201d</p><p>She was already having a few of her own.</p><p>Colin spared a glance for her couch. \u201cMainly, I\u2019ll picture that couch. With you on it, naked, of course.\u201d</p><p>Of course. Damn. It was hot. She shouldn\u2019t have worn the black turtleneck.</p><p>Ah, hell, she couldn\u2019t even kid herself. She was just damn turned on. Because she could picture him on her couch too. And in her fantasies, he was most definitely naked.</p><p>Down, girl. You\u2019ve got a patient waiting. It\u2019s not the right time for wild sex.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see you tonight.\u201d His hand fell away.</p><p>\u201cO-Okay.\u201d</p><p>Colin strolled toward the door. Emily followed slowly behind him, trying to calm her racing heart.</p><p>\u201cGood afternoon, Dr. Drake!\u201d Margie\u2019s cheery voice greeted her the moment she stepped into the lobby.</p><p>Emily forced a friendly smile. She liked Margie, truly enjoyed their sessions, but at that moment she could have easily cursed the elderly woman\u2019s penchant for perfect punctuality.</p><p>A few minutes to get her body back under control...that\u2019s all she wanted.</p><p>\u201cHello, Margie.\u201d</p><p>In her late seventies, with a mane of salt and pepper hair, Margie was the epitome of elegance. She was dressed in immaculate, very high-end clothing, and a cloud of French perfume hung in the air around her.</p><p>A large wicker basket sat on the chair beside her. A basket that was currently hissing.</p><p>Colin halted, slanted a quick look at Margie and her basket.</p><p>Margie smiled innocently back at him.</p><p>\u201cHello, ma\u2019am.\u201d</p><p>The basket hissed, a very loud, very disgruntled hiss that cut straight through Colin\u2019s words.</p><p>Emily cleared her throat. Time to intervene before Colin gets too friendly with my patient. \u201cThanks for stopping by, Detective.</p><p>I\u2019ll look forward to our next meeting.\u201d</p><p>He tore his gaze away from the basket. \u201cMe too, Doc. Me too.\u201d</p><p>Then he was gone.</p><p>\u201cHmmmph.\u201d The grumble came from Vanessa, who was currently on the exact opposite end of the room from Margie and her basket. In fact, Vanessa looked like she was trying to disappear into the wallpaper.</p><p>Vanessa didn\u2019t enjoy Margie\u2019s visits as much as Emily did. But in all honesty, her distaste had nothing to do with Margie personally.</p><p>Emily motioned for her client to follow her inside the main office.</p><p>She shut the door with a decisive click and watched as her client carefully sat the basket down onto the couch. Then Margie lifted the round lid.</p><p>The hisses were much, much louder now.</p><p>Emily crossed to her desk. Picked up her pen. \u201cWhat seems to be the issue today?\u201d</p><p>Margie pulled a large albino Burmese python from the basket, her fingers smoothing over its brightly colored body. The snake stretched beneath her touch, the orange and yellow marks across its long length immediately catching Emily\u2019s eye.</p><p>Then the snake hissed again.</p><p>\u201cOh, George, stop it.\u201d Margie frowned at the snake. \u201cHe\u2019s been like this for the last two days. Hissing, hissing, hissing. But he won\u2019t say a dang word to me.\u201d</p><p>Emily picked up her pad. Silent treatment from George, again.</p><p>\u201cIt started when I had a gentleman caller on Friday.\u201d Margie flushed a bit. \u201cWell, George took one look at him and tried to constrict around his leg...\u201d</p><p>\u201cHeard you had a bit of excitement last night.\u201d Brooks leaned back in his chair and steepled his fingers beneath his chin. \u201cGot jumped in an alley with your pretty psychologist, huh?\u201d There was a touch of humor in his voice, but genuine concern shone in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cYeah, some punks\u201d\u2014 demons\u2014\u201ccaught us as we were leaving Paradise Found.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cThe uniforms sent out patrols, but\u201d\u2014Colin shrugged\u2014\u201cin that part of town, it\u2019s easy to disappear if you don\u2019t want to get caught.\u201d</p><p>Colin pulled out the Myers file. \u201cHey, tell me, did you interview the girlfriend?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Brooks whistled softly as he leaned back in his chair. \u201cOne of those pretty, cover-girl types, a little too thin for my taste, but still\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere was Gillian when Preston was killed?\u201d Colin asked, cutting through his words. You had to do that when Brooks started talking about a pretty woman. Otherwise, the guy would just go on and on.</p><p>Brooks blinked. \u201cWho the hell is Gillian?\u201d He leaned forward, sitting straighter and motioning to the file. \u201cThe guy\u2019s girlfriend was a Hilary Bishop. You know her, she\u2019s the mayor\u2019s niece and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got it on pretty good authority that the vic was involved with a Gillian Nemont.\u201d He paused a beat, waiting for the name to register. \u201cDoes the name ring a bell?\u201d</p><p>His partner shook his head. \u201cNever heard of her. And neither has the vic\u2019s family, friends, or neighbors.\u201d He smiled, his innocent-trust-me smile. \u201cAnd believe me, if they knew about her, I would know by now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe need to find her,\u201d Colin said, tapping the file against the edge of his desk. So Gillian had been the vic\u2019s dirty little secret...</p><p>But had she been the secret that had led to his murder?</p><p>Only one way to find out.</p><p>Less than an hour later, Colin and Brooks stood in front of Gillian\u2019s apartment. When they saw that the lock was broken, that the door swayed drunkenly on its hinges, both men reached for their guns.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll cover you.\u201d Brooks mouthed the words.</p><p>Colin nodded. He crouched near the wall, banged his fist against the wooden door. \u201cGillian Nemont! This is the police! We need to talk to you!\u201d</p><p>No response, but then, based on the condition of the lock, he hadn\u2019t really expected one.</p><p>One more try. \u201cMs. Nemont! We\u2019re coming in!\u201d He lifted his gun, took a deep breath, and shoved open her door.</p><p>He sprang inside, still crouching, searching the room in one fast glance.</p><p>The place had been trashed. Chairs were overturned, and the sofa was slashed to bits. Papers and books littered the floor.</p><p>Colin started inching around the right wall, heading toward what he thought was the bedroom. Brooks took the left wall.</p><p>Colin turned the corner. Found more chaos. A broken mirror, smashed dresser.</p><p>But no Gillian.</p><p>\u201cLooks like someone beat us here,\u201d Brooks murmured as he lowered his gun. \u201cDamn, the woman sure must have pissed someone off.\u201d He exhaled slowly.</p><p>Colin pushed his way to the small closet. \u201cHer clothes are gone.\u201d Not tossed onto the floor. Not shredded. Just gone.</p><p>He crossed to the bathroom. Brooks was already in the small room, looking around at the broken shards that had once been a vanity mirror.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t see a toothbrush, or toothpaste.\u201d Brooks looked up at him. \u201cLooks like our girl got out before the trasher arrived.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe need to get a crime scene unit in here.\u201d Colin reached for his cell phone. He\u2019d only touched the door when he\u2019d entered.</p><p>Maybe they\u2019d get lucky and find some prints in the apartment.</p><p>\u201cWhat are the odds,\u201d Brooks began slowly as they made their way back to the front door, \u201cthat this woman\u2019s apartment\u2014a woman you say was Preston\u2019s lover\u2014just happened to be vandalized?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d say the odds are pretty high...that Gillian knows something.\u201d But if she was on the run, and it sure looked like she was, then they\u2019d have a damn hard time finding her.</p><p>\u201cYou think he found what he was looking for?\u201d Brooks scanned the living room, his eyes darting over the broken furniture, the smashed computer screen.</p><p>Colin shrugged as he punched in the number for the CSU. \u201cCould be he wasn\u2019t looking for anything.\u201d</p><p>Brooks lifted a brow. \u201cThink this was a message?\u201d</p><p>They\u2019d both seen situations like that before, of course. Homes trashed, cars vandalized, all to make witnesses too scared to talk to the cops.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I think it was.\u201d</p><p>His partner\u2019s brown eyes narrowed as he studied the floor. Crouching, he pulled out a pair of latex gloves from his back pocket.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019ve you got?\u201d</p><p>Brooks shoved aside wood from the coffee table. \u201cLooks like a day planner.\u201d He lifted a small, blue book. \u201cMaybe we can track our girl\u2019s movements before she decided to skip out.\u201d</p><p>Decided to skip out. Nice phrasing. \u201cDon\u2019t you mean before she ran as fast as she could from the psycho on her trail?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, that\u2019s what I meant.\u201d He flipped through the planner, skimming past the pages. \u201cLet\u2019s just see what our lady had planned for the day of Preston\u2019s murder.\u201d He whistled. \u201cWell, I\u2019ll be damned.\u201d</p><p>The CSU operator had picked up. He was asking for the scene\u2019s address. \u201cHold on.\u201d Colin\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>Brooks lifted the planner. \u201cTake a look at Gillian\u2019s one o\u2019clock appointment.\u201d</p><p>His eyes tracked down the page. Saw the small, neat feminine scrawl. 2301 Mistro Tower. Dr. Drake.</p><p>A hard tension swept through him. 2301 Mistro Tower. That was Doc\u2019s office. Gillian Nemont had been to see Emily.</p><p>\u201cDid the good doctor happen to mention that she knew Ms. Nemont?\u201d Brooks\u2019s voice was cool.</p><p>On the ride over, Colin had told him that it was he and Emily who had discovered the identity of Preston\u2019s lover. Of course, he hadn\u2019t mentioned the fact that a demon had tipped them off.</p><p>And now it looked like he might not be the only one withholding facts from a partner.</p><p>\u201cDid she?\u201d Brooks pressed, and there was suspicion in his eyes.</p><p>The CSU operator was muttering in his ear.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Colin finally said, his voice very soft. \u201cShe didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>And he sure as hell planned to find out why the doc hadn\u2019t mentioned that important little fact.</p><p>Chapter 8</p><p>Colin arrived at her place just after eight, and the minute he walked into her house, Emily knew something was wrong.</p><p>Hell, it didn\u2019t take a psychic gift to figure out the man was angry.</p><p>Colin stalked past her without a word and jerked off his rather beaten-up jacket.</p><p>\u201cWell, hello to you, too,\u201d she muttered, shutting the door. After the kiss in her office, she\u2019d certainly been expecting a different greeting.</p><p>Correction, she\u2019d been expecting a greeting, period. \u201cGuess you had a bad day at the office, huh?\u201d She trailed behind him. After just one visit, the guy sure seemed to be making himself at home.</p><p>Colin tossed his jacket onto the couch, then began to pace in front of the fireplace. \u201cBad day? You could say that.\u201d A muscle ticked along his jaw. \u201cI need to ask you a few questions, Doc.\u201d</p><p>He sounded serious. Very serious. A nervous flutter tickled her stomach. \u201cUh, okay.\u201d She sat on the couch, pushed his jacket to the side, and tried not to dwell on the fact that the evening was not going according to plan.</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me that you knew Gillian Nemont?\u201d</p><p>She blinked. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>He stalked toward her. \u201cYou heard me.\u201d</p><p>Emily shook her head. \u201cI didn\u2019t tell you because I don\u2019t know her.\u201d What, did the guy think she\u2019d been holding out on him?</p><p>\u201cShe had an appointment to meet with you last Friday. At one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she told him, meeting that piercing blue stare head-on, \u201cshe didn\u2019t.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>His head cocked to the side. \u201cYour name was in her day planner. Your address.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m telling you, I don\u2019t know the woman. Look, why don\u2019t you just ask her and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t do that. Gillian Nemont is missing.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMissing?\u201d Oh, that didn\u2019t sound good.</p><p>\u201cNeighbors said they saw her last Wednesday. She stuffed a suitcase in her car and left as fast as she could.\u201d He was watching her with expressionless eyes, waiting, gauging her response. \u201cShe hasn\u2019t been to work since then.\u201d</p><p>She felt his suspicion, heavy in the air. \u201cLook, Colin, I don\u2019t know the woman and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not a patient?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just said I didn\u2019t know her!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut you\u2019d protect your patients, wouldn\u2019t you, Doc?\u201d</p><p>There was too much insinuation in that question for her to ignore. Emily shot to her feet. \u201cI\u2019d protect their confidentiality, yes, but I wouldn\u2019t protect someone who was involved in a murder, if that\u2019s what you\u2019re asking.\u201d Asking, implying, same damn thing in her book.</p><p>Her heart was racing now, her fists clenched. Colin thought she\u2019d been lying to him, thought that she might even be protecting a killer.</p><p>Talk about a lack of trust.</p><p>But you don\u2019t trust him either, not completely. Or else you would have made love with him last night, a nagging inner voice reminded her.</p><p>It looked like they both had trust issues. Not a good sign. \u201cIf you don\u2019t believe me, why don\u2019t you just go ask Vanessa? She\u2019ll tell you that I didn\u2019t treat Gillian.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMy partner is interviewing her right now.\u201d He crossed his arms over his chest. \u201cSo if there is anything you need to come clean about, Doc, now\u2019s the time.\u201d</p><p>The bastard. \u201cI\u2019m working this investigation with you.\u201d In case he\u2019d forgotten. \u201cI\u2019m not one of your suspects, and I sure as hell don\u2019t appreciate being treated like one.\u201d</p><p>A faint beeping sounded from her kitchen. Dinner.</p><p>Emily pushed past him. She felt like an idiot now. An absolute idiot. There was no way the two of them were going to sit down for a romantic dinner. The jerk thought she was\u2014aw, hell, she didn\u2019t even know what he thought.</p><p>She opened the oven and took out the lasagna she\u2019d so painstakingly prepared. A master chef she certainly was not. But over the years, she\u2019d learned how to perfect a few dishes, and her lasagna was one of them.</p><p>She placed the dish on the stove top, turned\u2014</p><p>And found Colin standing in the doorway, a bemused look in his eyes as he took in the tidily set table, the two plates, the two candles.</p><p>Heat rushed into her cheeks, and it wasn\u2019t due to the warmth of her oven.</p> <p>\u201cYou cooked.\u201d</p><p>Well, wasn\u2019t he just Commander Obvious.</p><p>And wasn\u2019t she just the queen of stupid? He\u2019d told her that he was coming over to talk about the Other, not for a date.</p><p>But she\u2019d still wasted all that time on the meal. Wasted time showering and dressing. She\u2019d even left her hair down, not that Colin had seemed to notice.</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, I have to eat,\u201d she muttered, crossing her arms over her chest. How was she going to get him out of her house?</p><p>His nostrils twitched. \u201cSmells good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUmm.\u201d Her right foot began to tap. She decided to try the direct approach. \u201cI want you to leave.\u201d</p><p>Colin blinked.</p><p>\u201cNow, actually. I want you to leave now.\u201d Before she got even angrier.</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cWe need to talk more about the case\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean you want to question me more.\u201d From profiler to suspect in twenty-four hours. She bet that didn\u2019t happen often.</p><p>In fact, she bet it happened only to her.</p><p>The Monster Doctor strikes again.</p><p>His lips thinned. \u201cI\u2019m doing my job. I have to ask\u2014\u201d</p><p>The distinctive chime of a cell phone ring cut through his words.</p><p>Emily arched a brow. \u201cBet that\u2019s Brooks.\u201d Calling to report about his talk with Vanessa.</p><p>Colin growled and jerked out his phone.</p><p>Emily stared straight at him, eager to hear at least his part of the conversation.</p><p>\u201cYeah, Brooks, I\u2019m here now.\u201d A pause. \u201cSo she confirmed an appointment?\u201d</p><p>What? Not damn likely. There had been no appointment scheduled with a Gillian Nemont.</p><p>\u201cHuh. Yeah, that is interesting.\u201d</p><p>Interesting that she had a client she didn\u2019t remember? Yes, she\u2019d certainly say so.</p><p>Colin gave a short burst of surprised laughter.</p><p>Laughter? Oh, the man was starting to get on her nerves.</p><p>\u201cI guess that\u2019d be pretty interesting too.\u201d A brief pause, then, \u201cI\u2019ll talk to you tomorrow. Eight o\u2019clock, right.\u201d He punched a button to disconnect the call. His head cocked to the side as he studied her. \u201cSeems you did have an appointment scheduled for last Friday.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes narrowed. \u201cI. Did. Not. Have. An. Appointment. With. Gillian. Nemont.\u201d She spaced the words slowly, deliberately.</p><p>\u201cNo, you didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>His sudden, easy agreement threw her off.</p><p>\u201cYou had an appointment with a Michelle Tome. Something Vanessa called a meeter.\u201d He slipped the cell phone back into his pocket. \u201cMind telling me just what a \u2018meeter\u2019 would be?\u201d</p><p>She answered by rote. \u201cI always have a sit-down meeting with anyone who is interested in my services. Before I do any evaluations, before I agree to work as counselor, I get the person to come in. We sit down, talk, and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you use your psychic gift to figure out if the would-be client is an ordinary human or one of the Other. \u201d</p><p>Emily nodded. She also partially lowered her shields at the meeter to get an idea of the person\u2019s power. If she felt the taint of darkness or power that was too uncontrolled, she gave a nice, polite speech about how she wasn\u2019t taking any new clients right then.</p><p>\u201cVanessa told Brooks that Michelle Tome never arrived for her appointment.\u201d</p><p>And he thought Michelle and Gillian were one and the same. \u201cWhy would she use an alias? I mean, I wouldn\u2019t know her either way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. There are quite a few things I don\u2019t know about Ms. Nemont.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think you\u2019ll be able to find her?\u201d Alive.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m gonna do my best.\u201d Not exactly the definitive answer she\u2019d been hoping for.</p><p>She thought back to last Friday afternoon. She\u2019d been mildly annoyed when Vanessa announced the appointment was a no-show.</p><p>She felt a rush of shame now. She\u2019d been annoyed, while Gillian had\u2014what? Been in danger? Been running for her life?</p><p>Been killed?</p><p>Emily swallowed. And why had Gillian wanted to see her?</p><p>She might never know.</p><p>\u201cDoc, Emily, I had to ask you about her.\u201d Colin took a step toward her, his hands lifted.</p><p>Oh, now he wants to play nice. Now that he thinks I\u2019m not in on a murder.</p><p>But the damn annoying thing was that she understood. He was a cop, working the most high-profile case in the city. He\u2019d found her name in Gillian Nemont\u2019s appointment book. If he hadn\u2019t followed up on the link, well, she would have wondered about his detective skills.</p><p>And his ethics.</p><p>But he had followed up. He\u2019d pissed her off, offended her, ruined her night, but he\u2019d done his job.</p><p>\u201cNext time, Gyth, don\u2019t come in with guns blazing.\u201d She ignored his raised hands and turned her back on him.</p><p>He exhaled heavily. \u201cI screwed things up, didn\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>Hmmm. Commander Obvious had struck again. But maybe there\u2019d be hope for him yet. Emily spun back around, a knife gripped in her fingers. \u201cI don\u2019t like your methods, Gyth, but I understand why you had to question me.\u201d And why Brooks had to question Vanessa. Although she bet her assistant hadn\u2019t appreciated the interruption. Wednesday nights were her coven nights. And tonight, well, tonight the coven had a skyclad ritual on the agenda.</p><p>She had a pretty good idea what Brooks had said that elicited earlier appreciative male laughter.</p><p>\u201cAh, you do?\u201d Colin barely glanced at the gleaming knife.</p><p>\u201cUmm, next time\u201d\u2014she really, really hoped there wasn\u2019t a next time\u2014\u201ctry playing good cop with me. It\u2019ll work much better.\u201d</p><p>Using the knife, she began cutting the lasagna. Colin stood there, a faint tension emanating from him. He didn\u2019t say anything, just watched her. She could feel his intense stare on her.</p><p>After a few minutes she broke, glanced at him from the corner of her eye. \u201cWell, we have to eat, don\u2019t we?\u201d She muttered. Waving toward the table, she ordered, \u201cSit down. There\u2019s no sense in wasting good food. Besides, we haven\u2019t gotten to finish our talk about the Other.\u201d She could play the professional card too.</p><p>They did need to finish the lesson.</p><p>And she wanted him to stay.</p><p>It looked like they both had some trust issues, but, hey, no one was perfect.</p><p>Not the Monster Doctor and not a shifter.</p><p>But perfect...perfect could be boring, she realized. And after living too much of her life on a regimented, by-the-minute schedule, she was ready for a bit of imperfection.</p><p>The shifter had better not screw up again. One free pass was all he was going to get from her.</p><p>So he\u2019d royally fucked up. At least the doc had let him stay for dinner.</p><p>Dinner. The woman had actually cooked for him. Put out candles. Nice plates.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t remember anyone doing that for him before.</p><p>Sure, he\u2019d had more than his share of women. But they\u2019d usually gone out to restaurants. And the relationships hadn\u2019t lasted past a few sexual encounters and a couple of fancy meals.</p><p>He\u2019d never had this cozy, relaxed kind of date before. And, yeah, despite the fact that he\u2019d spent the first half hour of his time there grilling her, he still considered it a date.</p><p>Number two for them.</p><p>He wondered if the doc would let him get to second base.</p><p>A guy could hope.</p><p>\u201cSo, that\u2019s the main difference between wizards and warlocks. The warlocks have just as much power, but they use the darker magic, and if you ever make the mistake of calling a wizard by the term warlock, well\u201d\u2014Emily paused, downed a rather large swallow of her wine\u2014\u201cthen you\u2019re in trouble, because you\u2019ve just seriously insulted the guy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. I\u2019ll try to keep that in mind.\u201d Throughout their dinner, Emily had kept up a steady stream of conversation about the Other.</p><p>He now knew that charmers could talk with only one type of animal. Some charmers were born linked to snakes, some to birds, and so on.</p><p>There were two types of vampires, the born or the Blood as they were called, and the made or the Taken. To make a vampire, you didn\u2019t need the three blood exchanges like the books said. No, according to Emily, one was all it took. The victim had to be drained nearly dry by the vampire, then the would-be vamp had to drink from the sire\u2014 that was what Emily had called the guy, a sire\u2014and boom, you had yourself a brand, spanking new vampire.</p><p>He\u2019d also grilled her about shifters. She\u2019d been right when she mentioned earlier that he could smell others of his kind. He could.</p><p>There was a wild, rich scent that clung to others like him. He\u2019d first caught that scent when he\u2019d been a nineteen-year-old rookie.</p><p>He\u2019d stumbled onto a bear shifter and been so surprised he\u2019d nearly dropped his gun.</p><p>The bear had broken into a vacation home, ransacked the place. When he\u2019d arrived, the shifter had changed in front of him, a quick, easy transformation from beast to man.</p><p>He\u2019d apologized for the wreckage, saying, \u201cSorry, mate, the beast took over.\u201d He\u2019d winked. \u201cYou know how it can get.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo...\u201d Emily said, her soft drawl pulling him from the past. \u201cAnything else you want to know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d He took a sip of his own wine. Normally, he wasn\u2019t much for wine. Give him a beer and he was a happy man. But the wine Emily had, it was pretty good. Sweet. A little tangy.</p><p>The taste reminded him of her.</p><p>And he realized it\u2019d been more than eight hours since he\u2019d felt her lips beneath his. Too damn long.</p><p>He shifted in his chair. He\u2019d had a hard-on from the moment he walked through her door. Her hair was down, looking all soft and silky around her shoulders. She was wearing a thin dress with delicate little spaghetti straps. One pull, just one quick tug, and he was sure he could snap those straps.</p><p>And he\u2019d bet a month\u2019s pay that Emily wasn\u2019t wearing a bra. He could see the faint outline of her nipples. Those sweet, perfect nipples.</p><p>He could still feel them on his tongue, still see the flushed, pink-tipped areolas.</p><p>\u201cUh, Colin?\u201d</p><p>He blinked, and realized that she\u2019d just caught him staring at her chest.</p><p>Oh, nice. Definitely the way to charm a woman like her.</p><p>Playing the gentleman...not something he could do.</p><p>He managed to drag his eyes away from the too-tempting swell of her cleavage. He found her watching him, green eyes wide and mysterious behind the lenses of her glasses.</p><p>\u201cYou said you had something else to ask me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d He sat down his wineglass with a soft chink. \u201cIt\u2019s about the wolf shifters.\u201d</p><p>She tensed. \u201cWhat about them?\u201d Her fingers toyed with the rim of her glass.</p><p>\u201cAre they really as bad as folks say? The other shifters I\u2019ve met, they all said to steer clear of \u2019em, said they\u2019re dangerous.\u201d</p><p>Dangerous. Yeah, that was one of the words he\u2019d heard. A few others were psychotic, homicidal, and primitive. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Her fingers halted their stroking movements. Her eyes stared intently into his. \u201cThe wolf shifters are extremely dangerous, Colin. I can\u2019t stress that enough. In them, the animal they carry\u2014it fights the men and women for control.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome say they\u2019re psychotic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because some of them are.\u201d</p><p>Some, not all.</p><p>Emily rubbed the bridge of her nose. \u201cShifters, in general, are very intense creatures. But, well, I suppose you know that, don\u2019t you?\u201d She offered him a small, wan smile. \u201cWolf shifters, though, they can take that intensity to a whole new level.</p><p>\u201cAnd when a wolf finds his mate, he will do anything, and I mean anything, to protect that mate. Attacking someone else, killing a person, it would be nothing to a wolf shifter if his mate were in jeopardy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut not all wolf shifters find their mates.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. They don\u2019t.\u201d Emily leaned forward, her expression suddenly intense. \u201cAnd I think that\u2019s why the psychosis level is so high.</p><p>These creatures want mates so badly, need them so desperately, and when they lose hope of finding their other halves, well, they lose control.\u201d</p><p>Now that was damn interesting. \u201cYou\u2019re saying the mated wolf shifters don\u2019t have this psychotic problem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t think they do, unless their mates are threatened.\u201d Emily shook her head, sitting back in her chair. \u201cOf course, this is just my opinion based on, well, instinct, I guess. It\u2019s not like I\u2019ve conducted a study on these guys.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d Cause wolf shifters weren\u2019t exactly bountiful in the population.</p><p>\u201cBut my opinion is based on conversations I\u2019ve had with other shifters,\u201d Emily continued, her voice serious and professional. \u201cAnd I truly think it would explain a great deal about the wolf shifter psyche.\u201d</p><p>He realized there was another question he needed to ask her. \u201cYou said you were involved with a shifter once.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d A faint pink flush covered her cheeks.</p><p>\u201cBut the first time we met, I got the impression you didn\u2019t like my kind too much.\u201d He paused, long enough to make absolutely certain she kept looking in his eyes. \u201cOr was it just me you didn\u2019t like?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI-I\u2014\u201d She stumbled to a stop, seemingly at a loss for words. Huh. Not the usual state for the Monster Doctor.</p><p>\u201cWhich is it, Doc? Do you have a thing against all shifters or just me?\u201d</p><p>Her eyes hardened. \u201cNeither.\u201d She shrugged. \u201cIt\u2019s true, the first time we met, I was a bit...hesitant. Shifters do have a certain reputation in the supernatural world, you know. Of all the Other, shifters are the best at subterfuge, the best at manipulation. I mean, come on, you guys live your lives hiding a damn huge part of yourselves from the rest of the population.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you don\u2019t?\u201d He kept his voice soft. \u201cAre you telling me that you don\u2019t trick people too? Don\u2019t lie? Don\u2019t hide?\u201d They were more alike, much more than he thought she wanted to admit.</p><p>\u201cI never said I was perfect.\u201d She blinked, as if startled, as she said the words.</p><p>\u201cNeither am I.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo.\u201d And there were secrets in her eyes. He could see them. \u201cBut I don\u2019t want you to be.\u201d</p><p>He realized then that while the doc still might not trust his kind too much, might not trust him, she wanted him. He could see the hunger she felt shining in her emerald gaze.</p><p>It was a stark, burning sexual hunger that matched his.</p><p>No, she didn\u2019t completely trust shifters. Maybe she never would. But he didn\u2019t really give a shit about her feelings for the rest of his kind. All that mattered was how she felt about him, and maybe, just maybe, she could come to trust him.</p><p>No more games. \u201cI want you.\u201d Blunt. Hard.</p><p>She swallowed. \u201cI-I know.\u201d</p><p>He reached for her hand. Reveled in the feel of her satiny smooth skin against his. \u201cYou want me.\u201d</p><p>Emily nodded. Her nipples were poking against the front of her dress, and he could smell the sweet scent of her woman\u2019s cream in the air.</p><p>Yeah, the doc wanted him.</p><p>Now, if he could just get her to trust him.</p><p>She rose from the table, carrying her glass to the sink. His gaze dropped to her legs, the long, bare expanse of skin that he itched to touch. She was wearing a pair of small, strappy shoes. Black.</p><p>\u201cW-why don\u2019t we go into the den?\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d rather go into her bedroom, but beggars couldn\u2019t be choosers. Wasn\u2019t that the way the old saying went? And after his nice fuckup from earlier, he was definitely still feeling like a beggar.</p><p>Colin stood slowly and followed Emily from the room. He admired the nice sway of her ass. Oh, but the doc had a nice ass. Firm.</p><p>Tight. Just perfect for his hands.</p><p>Emily paused in the hallway and glanced back at him. He didn\u2019t bother to hide the lust on his face. Hell, he\u2019d just told her how he felt and she\u2019d admitted to the same hungry desire.</p><p>No more games. The thought filled his mind once again as he snagged her wrist, pulling her back against him. And then took her mouth.</p><p>A faint moan rumbled in her throat and her lips parted for him. God, yes, but she tasted good. He couldn\u2019t tell the difference between the wine and the woman, but he knew he had to have more of that sweet taste.</p><p>His tongue stabbed deep into her mouth, and his hands cupped the curve of her ass. He pulled her against his arousal, rocking his erection against her.</p><p>Her scent was thick in the air around them. A heady, tempting scent that stirred the beast within him.</p><p>Her fingers tightened on his shoulders. She didn\u2019t try to push him away. She pulled him closer.</p><p>The time for play was definitely over.</p><p>He needed her, under him, naked, and ready.</p><p>Now.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t be a gentleman. Wasn\u2019t in his blood.</p><p>He swirled his tongue over hers. Lightly bit her lip. Then Colin forced his head to lift. \u201cIf you don\u2019t want this,\u201d me, \u201cthen you\u2019d better say so now, Emily.\u201d While he could still stop.</p><p>Passion filled her eyes. A sort of dazed, wild lust. The controlled doctor was gone.</p><p>\u201cI-I\u2014\u201d She shook her head.</p><p>His teeth clenched. His body stilled. His cock was swollen with hunger, thick and hard with need.</p><p>But she was saying no.</p><p>What did you expect? Mentally he berated himself. Last night, she told you it was too soon. You\u2019re rushing her. You\u2019ve got to take more time, more care with her.</p><p>His hands lifted. He wondered if Emily would mind if he used her bathroom. Cause if he was gonna get through the night, he\u2019d need a very cold shower.</p><p>And possibly a hand job.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Emily grabbed his hands. \u201cI don\u2019t want you to stop.\u201d</p><p>Dr. Drake wasn\u2019t alone.</p><p>He watched the house from his spot in the bushes. He\u2019d been outside, watching, waiting for the last two hours.</p><p>He\u2019d seen the guy arrive, the big, mean-looking bastard that had nearly caught him that first night. He\u2019d held his breath when the guy jumped out of his Jeep.</p><p>He still wasn\u2019t sure how the man had figured out that he\u2019d been hiding in the lot that night, and he\u2019d been afraid the guy might pick up on his presence again.</p><p>But, no, the guy had stormed up the front steps, pounded on the door. Then disappeared inside.</p><p>What was the cop\u2019s angle? He\u2019d have to find out. He couldn\u2019t take any risks with this situation.</p><p>The fellow could be a friend, a lover, a client. But he needed to know.</p><p>Had to know everything about Dr. Drake.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re safe another night,\u201d he whispered, knowing that he couldn\u2019t approach her with anyone else around. No, that wasn\u2019t the plan.</p><p>He had to catch her alone.</p><p>And he would. It was just a matter of time.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t say yes if you don\u2019t mean it.\u201d Colin\u2019s body had stiffened against hers. \u201cI\u2019m trying as hard as I can to be the gentleman you wanted, but don\u2019t push me, Doc. There\u2019s only so much a man can take.\u201d</p><p>And there was only so much a woman could take. Only so many lonely, empty nights. Damn but she was tired of being afraid, tired of hiding herself away from life, from passion. \u201cI don\u2019t want to play it safe anymore.\u201d And she didn\u2019t, Emily realized. She\u2019d tried playing it safe before. Tried for the last ten years.</p><p>She\u2019d done a hell of a lot of thinking since she\u2019d met with Colin that morning. She\u2019d realized she was treating him exactly as she\u2019d treated Travis. She\u2019d never let her guard down with him, never trusted him fully. She\u2019d kept waiting, kept thinking there would be some perfect moment when she could reveal her secrets to him.</p><p>But that perfect moment had never come. Travis had left her, she\u2019d kept playing it safe, and she\u2019d finally come to the conclusion that safety, well, it was boring.</p><p>She wanted excitement. She wanted life. She wanted...Colin.</p><p>Besides, Colin already knew her secrets, most of them anyway. And he didn\u2019t think she was some kind of freak just because she had a little extra psychic sensitivity. No, he didn\u2019t treat her like a freak.</p><p>He treated her like a woman. His woman.</p><p>And she liked that, liked it a lot.</p><p>So Ms. Six-Date-Rule took off her glasses, tossed them onto a nearby table, and decided to take a risk. Staring up into Colin\u2019s glittering eyes, she said softly, clearly, \u201cI want to be with you tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEmily...\u201d</p><p>Her stomach clenched at the raw need in his voice. No one had ever said her name with such hunger.</p><p>\u201cEmily, I\u2019m not like the men you\u2019ve been with before.\u201d</p><p>Thank God. She stood directly in front of him, her body trembling with anticipation. She knew he wasn\u2019t like the others. There was a wild, dominant sensuality about him that none of her other lovers had ever possessed.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t be able to take things slow. Not the first time.\u201d</p><p>The first time. Her sex clenched. Just how many times was he planning for? \u201cI don\u2019t want you to go slow.\u201d Slow wasn\u2019t a word she associated with him. She wanted hard and fast. She wanted screaming pleasure and mad passion.</p><p>She wanted everything.</p><p>A muscle ticked along his jaw. He glanced down the hallway. \u201cWhich one\u2019s the bedroom?\u201d</p><p>Her fingers lifted, pointed to the second door.</p><p>A feral smile curved his lips, showing just the slightest hint of fang.</p><p>The sight had scared her before. Given her pause.</p><p>Now, it just heightened her excitement.</p><p>I\u2019m not like the men you\u2019ve known before. Her panties were already wet in eager anticipation.</p><p>Colin picked her up, carrying her easily into the bedroom. She\u2019d left a lamp on earlier, and a soft glow of light illuminated the room.</p><p>He tossed her onto the bed and her dress hiked up around her thighs.</p><p>His eyes narrowed at the sight of her sprawled legs, and before she could move, he was on her. Crawling onto the bed, onto her, shoving her legs even wider apart, and stroking his long, strong fingers up the length of her thighs.</p><p>She jumped at the touch of his warm hands.</p><p>\u201cEasy, baby, I just want to feel you.\u201d He inhaled. \u201cGod, I love the smell of your cream.\u201d Then his fingers were on the crotch of her panties, stroking, rubbing.</p><p>Emily bit her lip, her body twisting against his. Oh, damn, but his fingers felt good. But she wanted more, needed\u2014</p><p>He jerked her panties off, ripping the delicate silk. Then those fingers were on her sex, opening her, sliding between her wet folds and thrumming her clit.</p><p>Her head thrashed against the pillows. Her orgasm was building, her sex tightening, tightening\u2014</p><p>Colin drove two fingers into her.</p><p>She came, shuddering, gasping his name.</p><p>\u201cAh, yes, Emily. Damn, you\u2019re so fucking sexy.\u201d</p><p>She was dazed, the drumming beat of her heart filling her ears. She\u2019d never come that quickly, not with just a few touches.</p><p>\u201cI want to taste you.\u201d</p><p>Her body was still trembling, her sex quivering with aftershocks of pleasure. His fingers were inside her, stroking, pulling out, thrusting deep in a maddening rhythm that made the need start to burn again.</p><p>It took a moment for his words to register, took a moment for her to realize what he\u2014</p><p>Colin pulled his fingers out of her, brought them to his lips. Watching her, keeping his bright stare trained on her, he brought his hand to his mouth. And licked her cream from his fingers.</p><p>He smiled at her. \u201cI want more.\u201d</p><p>So did she. More of him.</p><p>But he was still dressed. Still wearing far, far too many clothes. \u201cColin\u2014\u201d</p><p>His head lowered, and she felt his warm breath against her sex.</p><p>Every muscle in her body quivered in anticipation. She wanted his mouth on her. Wanted to feel that clever, rough tongue.</p><p>His tongue licked her labia. A slow, wet lick that had her arching off the bed, her high heels digging into the mattress.</p><p>He growled at her movement, and the rumble of vibration shot straight to her core.</p><p>Her thighs tightened around his shoulders. Her fingers were in his hair, urging him closer.</p><p>Another slow swipe of his tongue, then he licked her clit. Then again, harder.</p><p>\u201cC-Colin...\u201d A second orgasm was close. Her body was fighting, struggling to come again.</p><p>His tongue stabbed deep into her sex and his fingers pushed against her clit.</p><p>Her hips bucked against him.</p><p>The orgasm was coming, oh God, she was\u2014</p><p>\u201cNot yet, baby, not yet.\u201d He pulled back, and the hiss of his zipper filled the air. \u201cNot without me this time.\u201d</p><p>Something ripped in the darkness. Plastic. Condom wrapper. The shifter had come prepared.</p><p>Then his hands were on her again. Opening the folds of her sex, and she felt the broad, hard tip of his cock against her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Too late, a shiver of apprehension swept through her.</p><p>\u201cColin, I\u2014\u201d</p><p>His hands were on her shoulders. His fingers sliding under the straps of her dress.</p> <p>\u201cI fantasized about you all through dinner,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>And she\u2019d been fantasizing about him since last night.</p><p>\u201cI thought about your nipples.\u201d He pulled on the straps, and the delicate material broke apart. \u201cI wanted to see them.\u201d He pushed down the top of her dress. \u201cTouch them.\u201d His fingers plucked her nipples, and she arched upward with a gasp. \u201cTaste them.\u201d His head lowered and his mouth closed around her nipple, sucking strongly.</p><p>The faint edge of his teeth pressed against her, not pain...oh no, not pain. Pleasure.</p><p>No more fear. Only need.</p> <p>While he tongued one breast, his hands tormented the other. Squeezing, rubbing, driving her mad with a hunger and voracious need that just built and built.</p><p>She squirmed against him, trying to impale herself on the thick cock that was lodged at the mouth of her sex. She wanted him inside. Deep inside. She was so close to climaxing again. So close. She needed him to fill her.</p><p>Her fingers curved over his hips, felt the rough touch of his jeans, and she shoved the heavy material down. She gripped his hips, feeling the hot skin against her. And she tightened her hold around him, urging him forward.</p><p>Colin lifted his head, his lips glistening with moisture, and laughed, but it was a tight, rough sound. \u201cImpatient, are you?\u201d</p><p>Hell, yes, she was impatient. Her body was yearning, needing, and sweet release was just one good thrust away.</p><p>Her eyes narrowed as she stared up at him. Two could play this game.</p> <p>Her fingers trailed over his hip bones, skated down his abdomen, and found the dark nest of hair at his thighs.</p><p>He inhaled sharply at her touch, and she saw his nostrils flare even as he tensed against her.</p><p>Her fingers curled over the base of his erection, stroked slowly, squeezing him, moving from root to the tip that was pushing against her core.</p><p>His hands flashed out, grabbed her wrists, and pinned her hands to the bed. A growl sounded in his throat.</p><p>His eyes were burning with lust, and she knew she wouldn\u2019t have to wait any longer.</p><p>His mouth crashed onto hers, his tongue thrusting past her lips\u2014</p><p>And he buried his cock balls deep in her body.</p><p>Emily came immediately, her body pulsing, shaking, squeezing tightly around his thick length as a wave of intense, God-yes pleasure rocked over her. And still he thrust into her\u2014deep, hard thrusts that shook the bed, that shook her.</p> <p>His fingers were clenched around her wrists, his hips hammering against hers. He was wild, completely out of control as he took her.</p><p>And she loved it.</p><p>Loved it.</p><p>His head lifted, and she caught the gleam of a fang, then his mouth was lowering toward her throat.</p><p>Her breath choked out. Her heart slammed against her breast, and her legs locked even tighter around his thrusting hips.</p><p>\u201cI love the way you feel when you come,\u201d he whispered, \u201clove the way you squeeze me. Love the tight, hot clasp of your sex.\u201d</p><p>His words wrapped around her, fed the orgasm that was still spinning through her.</p><p>His cock was rock hard, so big that she felt deliciously stretched. Long, warm, perfect.</p><p>She was riding an endless wave of release. It\u2019d never been like this before, never and\u2014</p><p>He bit her. Used those long canines in a bite on her neck that had her crying out in surprise and arching in shocked pleasure.</p><p>\u201cMine.\u201d His head lifted and his eyes glowed with a fierce blue fire. His cock drove into her, once, twice, then he was shuddering, stiffening, throwing back his head and gritting his teeth with the force of his release.</p><p>When it was over, when his hips stilled, when the tingling pleasure finally faded, Colin draped his body over hers. Freed her wrists, then took her hands and twined his fingers with hers.</p><p>Colin kissed her. A long, wet, open-mouthed kiss.</p><p>I\u2019m not like the other men you\u2019ve known.</p><p>Oh, but the man had certainly spoken the truth.</p><p>And, after having him, she was very much afraid that no other man would do for her again.</p><p>Chapter 9</p><p>Emily stood behind the podium, leaning forward slightly to pitch her voice into the microphone. A sea of cameras and bright lights stared back at her.</p><p>\u201cAfter reviewing the case files, I\u2019ve come to the conclusion that the perpetrator did, indeed, know the victim. This wasn\u2019t a random crime. Preston Myers was specifically targeted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDr. Drake!\u201d A thin Asian man raised his hand. \u201cLee Nguyen of the Atlanta Metro Daily. \u201d He paused, apparently letting her absorb that little nugget of information. \u201cWill the Night Butcher strike again? Are there others who will be \u2018specifically targeted\u2019?\u201d</p><p>He stared up at her, his head cocked, his photographer snapping shots right beside him.</p><p>Emily slanted a quick glance at Danny. She\u2019d told the captain her belief that the killer would, indeed, strike again, but he and the district attorney had told her not to share that information with the reporters.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t want folks to panic,\u201d Ben Mitchell, the DA, had muttered at her news.</p><p>Ben stepped forward, offering a vague smile to Nguyen and the rest of the reporters who\u2019d gathered in the press room. \u201cIt\u2019s far too early to predict whether or not this disturbed individual will strike again.\u201d His old, Southern boy accent played on the words.</p><p>\u201cSo you think the guy\u2019s disturbed.\u201d This came from Darla Mitchell who was looking TV perfect as she leaned forward with a hungry glint in her eye. Jake was behind her, a tense, slightly haggard expression on his face.</p><p>\u201cWell...\u201d</p><p>\u201cDisturbed isn\u2019t the right word for this man,\u201d Emily cut him off, trying to keep her voice calm, professional.</p><p>\u201cThen what\u2019s the right word, Dr. Drake?\u201d Darla was in the front row, easily seen as she stretched forward. \u201cPsychotic? Deranged?</p><p>Or maybe just plain crazy?\u201d</p><p>It was quite possible all those terms applied. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult to say at this stage exactly what psychosis this individual has. I do know that this man is highly intelligent, organized, strong, and very, very dangerous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDr. Drake, do you intend to work with the police until the Night Butcher is caught?\u201d This came from Nguyen.</p><p>\u201cI intend to work with the Atlanta PD until they no longer need my services.\u201d Time for her to step out of the limelight. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>Ben motioned Smith forward. \u201cOur ME has some findings she\u2019d like to share.\u201d</p><p>Smith swallowed as she looked out at the sea of faces. She was looking even more gorgeous today. She\u2019d ditched her white lab coat in favor of a simple black suit.</p><p>She pulled the microphone up, adjusting it slightly. \u201cI\u2019d like to clarify a few points that have previously been mentioned in the press.\u201d</p><p>There was a brief of buzz of excitement at her announcement.</p><p>Her lips tightened. \u201cFirst, despite the rumors, the victim was not \u2018butchered.\u2019 His body was intact. Preston Myers died because of severed jugular and carotid veins.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat weapon was used?\u201d This question was fired from a middle-aged man in the back.</p><p>Dr. Smith shook her head. \u201cI\u2019m not at liberty to say at this point.\u201d</p><p>Yes, Emily really didn\u2019t think the DA wanted the press to know that the \u201cweapon\u201d used by the Night Butcher was his teeth.</p><p>\u201cI would like the public to know that the suspect left several hairs behind.\u201d</p><p>Wolf shifter hairs. Pretty hard to do a DNA analysis on those, Emily thought.</p><p>\u201cAnd I am confident that the evidence will soon lead us to the killer.\u201d Smith inclined her head like a queen dismissing servants.</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>Ben took over then, answering a few questions and ending the press conference with a promise to follow up as soon as more details became available.</p><p>Thank God.</p><p>Emily hurriedly exited the small stage area. She\u2019d never liked talking in front of large groups. Always made her knees shake and caused a tight knot in her gut.</p><p>Classic anxiety disorder, of course. But knowing the clinical root of her condition didn\u2019t really make it any easier to bear.</p><p>\u201cYou did a good job, Doc.\u201d Colin stepped from the crowd, appearing at her side.</p><p>\u201cI thought you\u2019d be up there, too.\u201d She glanced at him, feeling a blush stain her cheeks. When she\u2019d woken that morning, he\u2019d been awake, gazing at her with his solemn stare.</p><p>He\u2019d left just after seven, given her a hard but too brief kiss, and gone to the station.</p><p>They hadn\u2019t talked about last night. Hadn\u2019t said a word about the mind-blowing sex.</p><p>\u201cBrooks is the one who handles the reporters.\u201d He jerked his thumb toward his partner who was just now leaving the staging area.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s got the pretty-boy face that always looks good on camera.\u201d</p><p>Well, she thought Colin would look pretty good on camera too. Emily tensed. Damn. They really needed to talk, to clear the air.</p><p>But now was hardly the time and\u2014</p><p>\u201cDr. Drake!\u201d</p><p>Emily turned at Darla\u2019s call. Found the woman making a beeline straight for her. Jake tagged along in her wake.</p><p>Darla paused two feet away from her. A smug smile curved her lips. \u201cI\u2019ve got a few questions for you.\u201d</p><p>Colin stepped forward. \u201cShe\u2019s done talking about the case.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUmm, well, it\u2019s not about the case. Not really.\u201d</p><p>At her Cheshire cat look, Emily got a very, very bad feeling in her gut. \u201cWhat do you want to know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me, Doctor,\u201d Darla paused, arched one perfectly plucked brow, \u201cwhat do you know about a place called Serenity Woods?\u201d</p><p>Her heart stopped. Then raced in a double-time rhythm. \u201cSerenity Woods?\u201d Her voice was clear, calm. And her palms were sweating. \u201cOnce, it was a psychiatric facility for children and teens in northern Georgia.\u201d Emily shrugged. \u201cI don\u2019t think the place is still in business anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s not.\u201d Darla\u2019s eyes were narrowed. \u201cThere was a fire at the hospital a few years ago, and after that, the place closed down.\u201d</p><p>Emily stared back at the reporter, keeping her features carefully blank.</p><p>\u201cArson, according to the investigators.\u201d</p><p>Colin took her arm. \u201cWe need to go, Dr. Drake. I think Smith wants to talk with us about the case.\u201d</p><p>That was news to her. But Emily nodded, glad for an excuse to get away from Darla. Serenity Woods. She hadn\u2019t heard that name in years.</p><p>Darla\u2019s hand snaked out, snagging Emily\u2019s just as she was turning away. \u201cOne more question.\u201d The reporter\u2019s hand felt like ice against her skin. Darla leaned forward, pitched her voice whisper low, as she asked, \u201cDo you still see demons?\u201d</p><p>Emily tensed. Then forced a slightly confused expression onto her face. \u201cSee demons?\u201d She shook her head. \u201cOf course not.\u201d</p><p>Emily strove to look concerned. \u201cWhy, my dear, do you?\u201d</p><p>Darla\u2019s lips thinned as she snatched her hand back. Her pretty face twisted and she turned on her heel, shoving her way through the crowd.</p><p>Jake looked at Emily. Met her stare for just a moment. There was worry in his eyes. Worry for her and for himself.</p><p>He nodded to her, a slight inclination of his head, then disappeared into the throng of reporters.</p><p>Her breath left her in a hard whoosh.</p><p>Shit. Darla Mitchell was digging into her past.</p><p>And her past was definitely not pretty.</p><p>Emily looked pale. Scared.</p><p>Colin tightened his hold on her arm and steered her toward the stairwell. He shoved open the metal door and gently pushed her past the threshold. When the door swung shut behind them, he hesitated a moment, listening intently, then, satisfied that they were the only ones in the stairwell, he figured it was time for a question-and-answer session of their own.</p><p>\u201cDoc, what\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>Emily stared up at him, and her eyes looked very wide. \u201cThere are some things you don\u2019t know about me.\u201d</p><p>After last night, he\u2019d started to think he knew the woman damn well. He knew just where to touch her to make that soft moan rumble in her throat. He knew what it felt like when she climaxed around him. Knew what she looked like first thing in the morning when the sunlight trickled through her blinds.</p><p>Yeah, he was starting to know the doc pretty well. But he knew she still had secrets.</p><p>So did he.</p><p>He figured he had the advantage though, considering he\u2019d run a background check on her. After that first night, when he\u2019d been sure someone was watching her, he\u2019d started searching for information about the doc.</p><p>From what he\u2019d gathered, the doc led a pretty quiet life. She dated occasionally but seemed to spend most of her time working with her patients.</p><p>He knew there was more to Emily though, knew secrets lay beneath her calm surface. And it looked like he was about to learn one of those secrets now...</p><p>\u201cI think Darla\u2019s investigating me.\u201d Her lips tightened. \u201cCorrection, I know she is.\u201d Anger hardened her voice. \u201cI don\u2019t know how she got the file. It should have been destroyed. There is no way she should have\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhoa. Slow down.\u201d He gripped her elbows. \u201cI\u2019m not the mind reader, baby. I don\u2019t know what in the hell you\u2019re talking about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSerenity Woods.\u201d She bit off the words. \u201cShe knows about the time I was at Serenity Woods.\u201d</p><p>He wasn\u2019t getting it. \u201cSo you worked at a psych ward.\u201d He\u2019d heard Emily and Darla\u2019s conversation, and he\u2019d thought the doc would be more rattled about the reporter\u2019s demon question than a vague mention of some old psychiatric hospital. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He remembered reading an old file about the fire a few years ago. No one had been hurt. The smoke alarms had alerted the staff and they\u2019d gotten all the patients out safely. A sudden thought had him tensing. \u201cDammit, Emily, were you working there when\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t work there!\u201d Her voice was sharp. \u201cOh damn, I\u2019ve got to go talk to Darla, find out what she knows.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean we\u2019ve got to talk to her.\u201d The doc should have gotten it by now. They were partners. Partners worked together. \u201cBut we can\u2019t question her with all those other reporters around. We\u2019ll wait, go to her later tonight.\u201d</p> <p>Emily nodded, but she didn\u2019t look pleased with the delay. \u201cFine.\u201d</p><p>Tension had made her body stiffen against his. His gaze swept over her. She was wearing a black turtleneck again. He\u2019d wondered if she\u2019d worn that top to hide the faint mark he\u2019d left on her throat.</p><p>He\u2019d marked her deliberately, of course. It was the way of his kind.</p><p>And he\u2019d do it again. As soon as he got her beneath him, or on top of him.</p><p>Hell, he\u2019d take her any way he could get her. He\u2019d gotten his first good taste of the doc, and he was hungry, starving, for more.</p> <p>His gaze dropped to her waist. She was wearing a skirt. A slim black skirt.</p><p>Pity Smith was waiting on them. He\u2019d sure love to lift up that skirt and find out if Emily was as soft as he remembered.</p><p>His cock swelled against his zipper.</p><p>Damn. Not the time.</p><p>Emily was angry, frightened, and sure as hell not in the mood for a horny shifter.</p><p>Later.</p> <p>He forced his hands to release their grip on her. They needed to talk more. A hell of a lot more. He still didn\u2019t know what secret was burning her from the inside, but they were already running late. It would have to wait. He\u2019d question her after they talked to Smith. \u201cWe need to get going. Smith wants us to meet her in the morgue.\u201d</p><p>A flash of distaste covered Emily\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cYeah, Doc. I hate the smell down there, too.\u201d He sure as hell didn\u2019t know how Smith could stand it. \u201cBut she\u2019s got something to tell us.\u201d Maybe they\u2019d gotten lucky and Smith had found a link to the killer.</p><p>Emily nodded jerkily and began hurrying down the stairs. He frowned as he watched her, remembering too late the words he\u2019d all but ignored moments before.</p><p>I didn\u2019t work there.</p><p>But if Emily hadn\u2019t been working at Serenity Woods, then what had she been doing there?</p><p>Smith was waiting on them, already covered in her white lab coat. She had her radio turned on; she usually listened to it when she was doing paperwork, and soft, whispery jazz filled the air.</p><p>She frowned when she saw them. \u201cDamn, Gyth. What\u2019d you guys do, stop for coffee?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSorry.\u201d Emily cleared her throat. \u201cMy fault. I was talking to a reporter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmmm. Freaking vultures.\u201d Smith shoved away from her desk. \u201cThose idiots didn\u2019t care about the facts. They just want to hype the killer, sell more copies of their paper, and get folks so scared they stay glued to their TV sets.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA little harsh, don\u2019t you think?\u201d Colin asked. He knew Smith didn\u2019t love the media. She\u2019d had a run-in a few years ago with a reporter for News Flash Five. The guy had tried to make it look like she\u2019d contaminated evidence in a murder trial.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t, but the reporter had done a damn good job of insinuating that she and the department were corrupt.</p><p>Luckily, the jury had been sequestered and they\u2019d missed the daily news reports and the murderer had gone to jail.</p><p>But Smith hadn\u2019t forgotten or forgiven.</p><p>One thing he\u2019d learned about Smith in the six years they\u2019d worked together, the woman could hold a serious grudge.</p><p>Smith grunted and looked at Emily. \u201cYou handled yourself pretty well. Glad you didn\u2019t let \u2019em push you in the corner about the killer being all crazy.\u201d</p><p>Emily blinked. \u201cUh, thanks.\u201d Her voice sounded a little absent, and Colin realized she wasn\u2019t looking at Smith. Or at him. Her focus was on the \u201ccold chamber,\u201d the vaults near the back of the lab that were used to store the bodies.</p><p>She even started walking toward them, her eyes narrowed, her right lifted as if she\u2019d touch the metal doors.</p><p>Smith snagged her hand. \u201cGoin\u2019 somewhere, Dr. Drake?\u201d</p><p>Colin knew Smith was very particular about her lab. Particular, or possessive as hell.</p><p>\u201cUmm, sorry.\u201d But Emily was still gazing at the vaults. \u201cI just...umm...what did you want to show us? And shouldn\u2019t McNeal be here?\u201d Tension was back in her voice.</p><p>Now Smith was the one to stiffen. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t need to be here.\u201d</p><p>Oh, yeah. He\u2019d forgotten about that, Colin realized. Word around the precinct was that Smith and McNeal had dated. Very briefly.</p><p>Emily finally looked back at him. \u201cI think he should be here.\u201d There was a note in her voice, a glint in her eye that finally made him realize\u2014</p><p>The doc is sensing something.</p><p>His own gaze drifted to the vaults that seemed to hold her so spellbound.</p><p>What had she said when she\u2019d first examined Preston\u2019s body? The captain had wanted to know if she could tell whether the guy had been Other, and Emily had said, \u201cIf the death is recent, some of the spirit will still be there.\u201d</p><p>Anybody in the vaults, well, they wouldn\u2019t exactly be \u201crecent,\u201d but Emily was sure acting odd. Acting like she knew something he didn\u2019t.</p><p>Yeah, big surprise there.</p><p>Colin jerked his thumb toward Smith\u2019s desk. \u201cMaybe you should page the captain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Smith dropped Emily\u2019s hand. \u201cYou guys don\u2019t even know what I want to show you.\u201d She spun on her heel, hurrying toward the vaults. \u201cAnd it could be nothing, but, well, the other night, I was listening to the police radio when the APB was sent out on those guys who jumped you.\u201d She swung the lock on the middle vault, pulled open the door.</p><p>Colin urged Emily forward. Cold air hit him, followed closely by the thick stench of death.</p><p>Damn but he hated that smell.</p><p>Emily twisted her hands together and grimaced.</p><p>Smith hummed along to the music as she pulled out a slab. A sheet-covered body appeared, and when Smith\u2019s hip bumped the slab, a man\u2019s hand slipped from under the cover.</p><p>Colin\u2019s eyes immediately locked on the tattoo. A long, twisting black snake encircled the dead man\u2019s left wrist.</p><p>Sonofabitch. His gaze flew to Emily. She gave a nearly imperceptible nod. And the light of understanding finally dawned.</p><p>The dead man on the slab, he wasn\u2019t a man at all. He was one of the demons who\u2019d attacked them last night. Emily had known, had sensed the truth when she\u2019d come into the room.</p><p>Hell, no wonder she\u2019d been trying to get them to call for McNeal.</p><p>\u201cThe tat\u2019s a match for the description you gave.\u201d Smith pulled back the sheet, revealing the white face of a young guy; he looked barely twenty, with a shaved head and a glinting nose ring. \u201cCops found his body downtown. He was in an alley.\u201d</p><p>Colin stared at the guy\u2019s still features. \u201cWe didn\u2019t see his face. He\u2014they had masks on the whole time.\u201d But this was one of their attackers, he\u2019d bet his life on it.</p><p>And the fact that Emily\u2019s psychic radar was going off just made him all the more certain.</p><p>You couldn\u2019t go wrong with a psychic.</p><p>Smith pulled the sheet down a few more inches, revealing a clear bullet hole right over the man\u2019s heart. \u201cClose range,\u201d she murmured. \u201cI found powder burns on his chest.\u201d</p><p>His hands clenched. He\u2019d hoped to question the bastard. Hoped to find out who\u2019d sent him.</p><p>A kid. The guy\u2019s just a kid. His gut tightened. What a damn waste.</p><p>\u201cThree others were found with him.\u201d Smith stepped back and tapped the vault door near her. \u201cSame MO. One shot, straight through the heart. The uniforms on scene thought it was a gang hit.\u201d</p><p>No, not a gang hit.</p><p>\u201cW-were they all young? Like him?\u201d Emily asked softly.</p><p>Smith nodded. Her eyes were narrowed as she appraised him. \u201cFour attackers, right? That\u2019s what they said on the radio.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d His mind was racing. If the men who\u2019d attacked them were all dead...damn, that was no coincidence. The guy who\u2019d hired them, the sonofabitch who\u2019d sent those kids after them, had tied up his loose ends.</p><p>Probably afraid the kids would cave and reveal his identity if the cops caught them.</p><p>\u201cKind of a strange coincidence, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Smith drawled. \u201cYou two getting attacked like that, and these poor guys getting killed? All within forty-eight hours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery strange,\u201d Emily said, and she lifted her hand toward the dead man. Her fingers hovered in the air over his chest, not quite touching him. Her hand was a soft, light gold above the stark white body. \u201cSo much pain...\u201d she whispered. \u201cFor so long...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Smith shook her head. \u201cNo, Dr. Drake, didn\u2019t you hear me? The guy was shot in the heart. He died instantly. He didn\u2019t suffer, I guarantee you that.\u201d</p><p>Emily blinked and shook her head. \u201cUh, right. Sorry. I was\u201d\u2014a barely perceptible pause\u2014\u201cconfused.\u201d Her hand balled into a fist.</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t done an autopsy yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, he was brought in just a few hours ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMcNeal needs to be notified before you cut into him.\u201d Colin made the words an order. \u201cHe should see the bodies first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee the bodies?\u201d Smith\u2019s brows scrunched together. \u201cWhy would he need to see them?\u201d</p><p>Because these guys are demons and he might not want you cutting inside them. Hmm. Better go with option B, instead.</p><p>\u201cBecause there\u2019s a chance these guys are linked to the Night Butcher.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t his MO.\u201d Smith was definite. \u201cA professional did these guys. Swift, clean.\u201d</p><p>The jazz music faded into silence.</p><p>Emily stared at him for a moment, then inclined her head slightly toward the door.</p><p>\u201cSmith, just don\u2019t start cutting on them yet, okay? I\u2019ll send the captain down here.\u201d</p><p>He stalked across the gleaming floor, heading for the door. Emily was in front of him, moving quickly to the exit.</p><p>\u201cHey, wait! Don\u2019t you want to see the others?\u201d Smith called after them.</p><p>Emily was at the door now. She paused a moment, glanced back over her shoulder, and whispered, \u201cThere\u2019s no need, Colin. I know it\u2019s them.\u201d</p><p>And you couldn\u2019t argue with a psychic. Since he\u2019d never gotten a look at the guys, seeing their faces now wouldn\u2019t do him much good. He\u2019d have to rely on Emily\u2019s sensitivity.</p><p>He spared a brief glance for Smith. She was watching them both, her brow furrowed. \u201cI\u2019ve got a suspect to question.\u201d That was the truth. When four demon bodies turned up in the morgue, it looked damn suspicious.</p><p>Especially when those guys had attacked him right outside of Paradise Found.</p><p>Someone sure as hell had to be pulling the strings on the demons who\u2019d attacked them. The odds were good that same person had been the one pulling the trigger and ending their lives.</p><p>And the guy at the top of his suspect list was a powerful demon, the kind strong enough to threaten others of his race.</p><p>Niol.</p><p>The door swung shut behind them. Emily hurried down the hallway, her high heels clicking on the tiles. Her shoulders were stiff, her back a tense, straight line.</p><p>\u201cEm, wait up.\u201d He grabbed her arm, pulled her around to face them. She was still too pale for his taste, and secrets were burning in her eyes.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got to go talk to McNeal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe can wait a minute.\u201d The cloth of her shirt was soft beneath his touch and her arm felt so delicate and small.</p><p>Sometimes he forgot just how delicate humans were. He\u2019d have to remember. Have to make sure that he took every care with her.</p><p>He\u2019d held onto his control last night. Managed to chain the beast. Yeah, he\u2019d marked her neck, but he\u2019d had to do it. Had to show that she was his.</p><p>It\u2019d been too long since he\u2019d had her. Too long since he\u2019d felt her beneath him. He\u2019d watched her during the press conference. Felt hunger coil tightly within him. Then afterward, when she\u2019d talked to that blond reporter and he\u2019d seen the fear flash in her eyes, anger had burned in him. He\u2019d wanted to step in front of her, to protect her.</p><p>And where in the hell had that impulse come from? His kind, they weren\u2019t exactly a protective bunch. They were fighters. Hunters.</p><p>They destroyed those who were weak. Devoured them.</p><p>They didn\u2019t protect them.</p><p>\u201cThose men in there\u2014I know they\u2019re the ones who attacked us.\u201d Her words jerked him out of his rambling thoughts and back to the present.</p><p>Yeah, he was pretty sure the tattooed kid had been the one he\u2019d seen. He had an eye for the tats, and the details of the snake were extremely clear.</p><p>But Emily had known the guy was the perp even before they\u2019d seen his wrist, he was sure of it. The doc had started acting weird the moment they\u2019d gone inside. \u201cHow\u2019d you know?\u201d he asked, keeping his hand on her arm. He had the feeling that if he let her go, she\u2019d run from him. And he didn\u2019t want her to run.</p><p>Jesus. What the hell is my deal? Did a little bit of good sex make me go crazy?</p><p>Course, it hadn\u2019t just been good sex. It\u2019d been the best damn sex he\u2019d had in, hell, he didn\u2019t even know how long.</p><p>\u201cI felt the echo of their power when we went inside.\u201d</p><p>Yeah, he wasn\u2019t real sure what that meant. Emily must have read his expression, because she shrugged and muttered, \u201cIt was like shadows hanging in the room, okay? I could see them, feel them. And demon power is distinct.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBut they were dead.\u201d Pointing out the obvious there. \u201cI thought the death had to be fresh in order for you to sense anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey were fresh enough.\u201d She winced. \u201cGod, that sounds cold, doesn\u2019t it? But the kill\u2014it was less than twenty-four hours ago, and I could still feel them in there.\u201d She shuddered. \u201cDo you know how cold death feels?\u201d</p><p>No, and he was pretty damn glad of that fact. Until then, he hadn\u2019t really thought about how hard the doc\u2019s gift might be on her.</p> <p>Seeing into people\u2019s minds, well, seemed it wasn\u2019t as exciting as most folks would think.</p><p>He opened his mouth to reply, but Emily pulled away from him, muttering, \u201cOf course you don\u2019t know. No one else knows. Just me.\u201d She shook her head, the light glinted off her glasses, and he watched her pull into herself, watched her pull away from him. He could see her withdrawal, see it in the suddenly blank expression on her face, read it in the stiffness of her body.</p><p>The doc was trying to pull away from him.</p><p>Oh, hell, no. He grabbed her arms, jerked her back against him. Yeah, he liked that a whole lot better. \u201cI might not know what it\u2019s like to be you, Doc. But I know you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think you do.\u201d He had her pinned against his body, and she had to tilt her head back to meet his stare. \u201cWe had sex, and suddenly you think you know me.\u201d</p> <p>He felt the flames of his temper stir. The doc should know better than to yank a shifter\u2019s tail.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got news for you.\u201d Her voice was ice cold. \u201cYou don\u2019t know me. There\u2019s so much\u2014\u201d She exhaled slowly, then whispered,</p><p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><p>His fingers tightened around her. \u201cTry me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d A shadow of pain appeared in her eyes. \u201cLet me go.\u201d</p><p>Not an option. He\u2019d just found her. Only started laying his claim. No fucking way was he going to let her slip through his fingers now.</p> <p>Shit. He didn\u2019t like the way she was dismissing him. The doc was putting distance between them, erecting that ice-princess wall she\u2019d worn the first day they\u2019d met. He\u2019d broken through that wall once before, and he\u2019d be happy to smash it to bits again.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t know me,\u201d she whispered, and there was a glint of pain in her eyes. \u201cNo one ever has.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow many times do I have to tell you?\u201d He growled the words as he lowered his mouth to hers. \u201cI\u2019m not like the men you\u2019ve known before.\u201d</p><p>He kissed her, plunging his tongue deep in her mouth and drinking up her sweet essence. Her hands lifted, wrapped around his shoulders\u2014and pulled him closer.</p><p>Yes. This was what he wanted. His woman, pressed breast to chest, sex to sex. His cock swelled against her as a heavy wave of arousal flooded his body.</p><p>Last night had been good. Fucking fantastic. And he wondered, just what would it be like if he let go of his control? Would the doc be able to handle him?</p><p>Her nipples were hard, stabbing into him, and he had to touch them. Keeping his mouth on hers, sweeping his tongue against hers, he lowered his right hand and cupped the warm weight of her breast.</p><p>Damn. He wanted that breast in his mouth. His fingers edged under her shirt, slid past the lacy bra, and found her nipple. When he squeezed her with the tip of his fingers, she gasped into his mouth, and the rich scent of her arousal perfumed the air.</p> <p>They were alone in the hallway. Dimly, he could hear the slow beat of music coming from the ME\u2019s office. Smith had started the jazz CD again. She wasn\u2019t going to come out and find them. And no one else was down in the Crypt.</p><p>He walked Emily back a few steps, pushed her up against the wall and slowly lifted his head. She was watching him, her eyes wide behind her glasses, her bow shaped, fuck-me lips a dark red, glistening.</p><p>Oh, those lips. He wanted to feel them around his cock. He\u2019d fantasized about the doc, imagined her taking him inside and licking him with that sweet, skillful tongue of hers.</p><p>But the Crypt wasn\u2019t the place for that. And they didn\u2019t have much time.</p><p>And he needed a better taste of her.</p><p>He jerked up her shirt, exposing her bra. Black, of course.</p><p>\u201cColin, no, someone might come\u2014\u201d</p><p>He pushed her bra aside. Gazed down at her breasts. The woman truly had the best breasts he\u2019d ever seen. And he\u2019d seen his fair share.</p><p>Not too big, not too small, just perfect for his hands. And so sweet...</p><p>He closed his lips over her nipple, pulling gently, then stroking her with his tongue.</p><p>\u201cOh, Jesus, Colin...\u201d He could hear the need in her voice, and it filled him with fierce satisfaction.</p><p>I do know you, Emily. I know just how to touch you, know just what you want.</p><p>Emily might think she could dismiss their physical connection, but he\u2019d show her just how wrong she was. Sex might not be the key to linking them, but he figured it was a damn good start.</p><p>He caught the fabric of her skirt in his hands, pulled up the material slowly, very slowly. He liked the way she felt against him.</p><p>Warm. Soft.</p><p>He pulled her breast deeper into his mouth, sucking strongly. And he fucking loved the way she tasted.</p><p>Her hips bucked against him. Her nails cut through his shirt and dug into his skin.</p><p>The doc had claws. Oh yeah, he liked that.</p><p>Growling his pleasure, he pushed his hand between her spread thighs. Her panties were wet with cream, and when he eased his fingers beneath the small band of fabric, Emily\u2019s breath choked out. \u201cColin\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cEasy.\u201d They both needed this. His fingers stroked her. His thumb pressed against the button of her desire. Just a few more minutes...</p><p>A slow, grinding rumble reached his ears. Then a soft, faint ding of sound.</p><p>Shit. The elevator. He jerked down her skirt, spun around, covering her with his body. \u201cSomeone\u2019s coming.\u201d Someone with extremely piss-poor timing.</p><p>He was so aroused that he hurt, and he\u2019d been minutes, seconds, away from finding release with Emily.</p><p>He glanced over his shoulder. She was frantically rearranging her shirt. Her face was flushed, but he knew it wasn\u2019t due to passion.</p><p>Making out in the Crypt probably wasn\u2019t the doc\u2019s usual style.</p><p>Another strike against him? Or one in his favor?</p><p>Damn. He hadn\u2019t meant for things to go so far. He\u2019d just wanted to touch her, wanted to remind her of what they had.</p><p>Sex like that\u2014the heat, the fast combustion\u2014it was damn rare. And worth fighting for.</p><p>\u201cEmily...\u201d</p><p>Her chin jerked up. Fire flashed in her eyes.</p><p>And the elevator doors swished open. Colin\u2019s head jerked back around just as Brooks stepped forward. Looked to the left, then the right\u2014</p><p>\u201cGyth! Damn, man, I\u2019ve been looking everywhere for you.\u201d</p><p>Pity the guy couldn\u2019t have kept looking for another two minutes.</p><p>Brooks noticed Emily. One brow rose, and the light seemed to dawn. \u201cUh, is this a bad time?\u201d</p><p>A very bad time.</p><p>Emily pushed past him. Her clothes were perfect again, but her nipples were thrusting against the soft fabric of her shirt, her lips were plump and darkly pink, her eyes bright.</p><p>Brooks wasn\u2019t an idiot. He knew what those signs meant.</p><p>Wisely, his partner didn\u2019t say a word when Emily crossed in front of him.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s McNeal?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cHis office.\u201d He also managed to keep his eyes on her face. Good man. He wouldn\u2019t get punched.</p><p>Emily nodded. Stepped into the elevator.</p><p>Well, damn. Not even a good-bye. Colin lunged forward, shot out his hand to stop the doors from closing. \u201cI\u2019ll see you tonight.\u201d</p><p>Her jaw locked and she stared at the control panel. \u201cI have to think, Colin. There\u2019s too much going on...\u201d</p><p>He heard Brooks\u2019s soft footfalls. The guy was inching back, probably trying to give \u2019em some privacy.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see you tonight,\u201d he repeated. They had to talk. About Darla. About Serenity Woods. About the demons who\u2019d attacked them.</p><p>Her gaze flashed to his. \u201cThis is the second time you\u2019ve given yourself an invitation to my place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but you want to finish what we started as much as I do.\u201d He let his eyes drop to her breasts. His voice thickened as he said,</p><p>\u201cAnd we will finish, Doc, that\u2019s a promise.\u201d</p><p>Colin stepped back. The doors slid closed, and Emily disappeared.</p><p>Brooks whistled softly. \u201cTell me you weren\u2019t just making out with our profiler in the Crypt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. I won\u2019t tell you.\u201d He actually didn\u2019t want to tell him a damn thing about Emily. She was his. His business. His woman.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think a place like this is, uh, quite what Dr. Drake is used to,\u201d Brooks said softly.</p><p>Yeah, no shit.</p><p>Damn. The doc\u2014she was different. She made him feel different.</p><p>Wanting to fuck and wanting to protect\u2014what in the hell was up with that?</p><p>\u201cListen, loverboy, I\u2019ve got some pictures upstairs I want you to look at,\u201d Brooks said. \u201cMaybe you can match the tat on that guy who jumped you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cForget it. He\u2019s not an issue now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? You can\u2019t be serious, man, the guy tried to kill you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd now he\u2019s lying on a slab in Smith\u2019s cold chamber.\u201d While the guy\u2019s spirit might be sending some kind of message to Emily, he sure as hell wasn\u2019t talking to them.</p><p>Brooks glanced toward the morgue. \u201cWhat in the hell happened to him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019ve got an idea.\u201d Niol.</p><p>Time to go interrogate the master demon.</p><p>\u201cYou up for a little good cop, bad cop?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlways.\u201d A wolfish smile curved Brooks\u2019s lips.</p><p>Colin punched the button for the elevator. He figured Emily would be long gone by now. \u201cGood. Cause I\u2019ve got a bastard we need to press, hard.\u201d Niol wasn\u2019t going to cave easy. He was too cocky. But if they caught him unaware, he just might slip up.</p><p>That\u2019s what the bastards usually did. Got too confident. Thought they were too smart.</p><p>Then they screwed up.</p><p>Would Niol be the same?</p><p>Well, he\u2019d just have to find out.</p><p>Yeah, time to go and question the master demon about the little matter of multiple murders.</p><p>Chapter 10</p><p>Emily sat in her car, her fingers gripping the steering wheel, and stared up at the tidy, two-story house.</p><p>After talking with McNeal, she\u2019d fled the station, embarrassed, afraid that she\u2019d see Colin or Brooks.</p><p>Lord, what the hell had she been thinking? She\u2019d almost had sex in a morgue for Christ\u2019s sake.</p><p>When he\u2019d touched her, lust had pumped through her, and she\u2019d wanted to rip the man\u2019s clothes off his body.</p><p>Not her normal style.</p><p>Her emotions were high, she knew that. Knew she was running on a hard mixture of fear, worry, and adrenaline. And as a psychologist, she knew those emotions made her susceptible to certain things.</p><p>And she sure as hell was susceptible to Colin.</p><p>But a morgue? Her knuckles whitened. That wasn\u2019t just being susceptible. It was crossing the line into crazy.</p><p>If Brooks hadn\u2019t walked out of that elevator, she would have had sex with Colin. Right there in that smelly, dingy hallway. And she would have loved it.</p><p>Shit. Is this what good sex did to a woman? Made her take stupid risks?</p><p>Cause she had enough trouble right then without giving the cops at the 12th Precinct a peep show when they went to the morgue.</p><p>But, dammit, she\u2019d been ten seconds away from coming. If Brooks had to interrupt, why couldn\u2019t the guy have waited just a bit?</p><p>A car horn sounded in the distance. A red-haired boy on a bike flew past her. Emily realized that she was sitting in her car, gazing blankly at the house and slowly rubbing the leather off her steering wheel.</p><p>Hell. She didn\u2019t want to be here, but when she\u2019d run from the station, she hadn\u2019t even thought about going home or going to the office. No, she\u2019d known exactly where she had to go. Exactly who she had to see.</p><p>Darla\u2019s words kept playing in her mind, rolling around and around like one of those songs you just couldn\u2019t get out of your head.</p><p>The reporter knew about her past. There was no denying that fact. No ignoring the smug look that had been on the blonde\u2019s face.</p><p>Emily had tried to hide her past. She thought she\u2019d buried it in the ashes at Serenity Woods Psychiatric Hospital.</p><p>She\u2019d planned the fire so carefully. Made absolutely certain that none of the patients were near the records room. Stayed close just in case someone had happened to wander by.</p><p>Yes, she\u2019d been so careful, but her story had still leaked out.</p><p>Her gaze focused on the house. On the perfectly groomed lawn. The leaves that had been swept into a nice, neat pile.</p><p>What was she doing here? Talking to the woman would do no good, she knew that.</p><p>But the mention of Serenity Woods...oh damn, how long had it been since she\u2019d even thought about that place? Years. Many blessedly forgetful years.</p><p>Now that the door to her past had swung open, she couldn\u2019t stop thinking about it.</p><p>She closed her eyes a moment and saw the girl she\u2019d been.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Their hands were too tight around her. They were hurting her. \u201cLet me go! Mommy! Mommy!\u201d</p><p>Her mother was there. Watching from behind the thin sheet of glass. She was letting them do this to her, letting them hurt her.</p><p>They strapped her onto a bed. Put ties around her wrists, her ankles. Tears leaked from the corners of her eyes. They didn\u2019t understand. No one understood.</p><p>Monsters were everywhere. In the streets. In her school. Even at church. They were everywhere.</p><p>She\u2019d told her mom, tried to point to one of the monsters with black eyes and show her mother what he was. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>But her mother couldn\u2019t see them. Even though they were right there.</p><p>\u201cShh...sweetheart, relax, okay? Everything\u2019s going to be all right.\u201d It was one of the nurses talking. An older woman with bright red hair and lips and skin that looked too pale.</p><p>\u201cI-I wanna go home.\u201d She\u2019d never been away from home before, not once in her life. Her friends had sleepovers, but her mom had never let her go\u2014</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019ll go home.\u201d The nurse stroked her cheek. \u201cOnce the doctors make you all better, you\u2019ll go home again.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t need to be made better. Her hands balled into fists, jerked against the binds. \u201cI\u2019m not sick!\u201d The words came out as a scream.</p><p>The nurse flinched, pulled her hand back.</p><p>\u201cYou need to calm down, honey.\u201d This came from one of the men in white who\u2019d jerked her out of her mom\u2019s car.</p><p>She didn\u2019t like him. Didn\u2019t like the hard, sickly smell that clung to him. Didn\u2019t like his cold eyes.</p> <p>\u201cMom!\u201d Her mom couldn\u2019t leave her there. \u201cI\u2019m sorry! I won\u2019t talk about them again, I promise! Don\u2019t leave me, don\u2019t\u2014</p><p>\u201d</p><p>Her mother was turning away, her shoulders hunched.</p><p>No, no, she couldn\u2019t leave her! She wanted to go back home, back to her room, back to\u2014</p><p>Her mother was walking away. Not glancing back at her.</p><p>\u201cMom!\u201d One of the straps snapped when she jerked up. \u201cNo!\u201d</p> <p>The men in white caught her shoulders, forced her back down with hands that stung.</p><p>\u201cGet the doctor; get him in here, now!\u201d</p><p>Emily fought the hands that held her. She didn\u2019t like this place. The people...something was wrong here. The air felt wrong. Too thick.</p><p>And it was so cold.</p><p>A white-haired man appeared at her side. He had a long, sharp needle in his hands. \u201cThis will calm her down.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t want to be calm. She wanted to be up!</p><p>They held her tightly, and the needle pressed into her arm, burning with a hot flash of pain. She whimpered and finally met the gaze of the doctor.</p><p>His blue eyes stared into hers; then, for just an instant, they flashed black.</p> <p>Her head thrashed against the table. \u201cHe\u2019s one of them!\u201d They had to see it! \u201cLook at his eyes! He\u2019s a monster!\u201d</p><p>The men in white shifted and glanced at the doctor. The nurse didn\u2019t bother looking his way. \u201cShe\u2019s delusional. The mother says she\u2019s been seeing things for a while now, but it\u2019s getting worse.\u201d</p><p>The drug was kicking in and her body was starting to feel heavy.</p><p>\u201cHmmm.\u201d The doctor was staring at her, his eyes once again a bright blue. \u201cAnd what does she see?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMonsters.\u201d The nurse brushed a strand of hair back from Emily\u2019s face. \u201cThe poor child always sees monsters.\u201d</p><p>And she saw one then. Staring down at her from behind the doctor\u2019s concerned face.</p><p>\u201cReally...and she\u2019s been seeing them for years?\u201d</p><p>The nurse nodded.</p><p>Her eyelids wanted to close, but she didn\u2019t want to sleep. Not with the monster so close.</p><p>The doctor motioned the others away. Leaned close to her. \u201cWhat do you see, child, when you look at me?\u201d</p><p>Her tongue was thick. Her mouth too dry. Emily wet her lips, swallowed. \u201cM-monster. Y-your eyes...\u201d Her voice was a weak whisper.</p><p>He leaned even closer. So close she could feel his breath on her cheek. \u201cWhat about them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cL-lying, t-trick. A-all black...\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmmm...\u201d His lying eyes narrowed. \u201cYou see that, do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cF-feel y-you. In the a-air.\u201d Like a hard wind pressing on her. He was all around. Why didn\u2019t the others feel it too?</p><p>Her fingers uncurled, fell back against the hard surface of the bed. Her eyelids dropped, even though she tried to force them open.</p><p>Her breathing slowed and her mind began to drift.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right, child.\u201d The doctor\u2019s voice sounded so far away. He gripped her fingers, but the touch seemed feather light.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take care of you from now on.\u201d</p><p>And he had, Emily realized, her thoughts sliding back to the present. Dr. Marcus Catcherly, \u201cCatch,\u201d had taken care of her. He\u2019d helped her to understand what she was seeing. Taught her everything she knew about the Other.</p><p>And he\u2019d taught her how to lie. How to pretend to be normal. To fit in at school, with her friends, and even with her family.</p><p>He\u2019d been her mentor, closer to her than anyone else in her life.</p><p>After three months, Catch had convinced her mother that Emily was well enough to return home. He\u2019d visited her every week, doing what he called follow-up care. She\u2019d talked to him about the different creatures she\u2019d seen and he\u2019d taught her about them all.</p><p>And she\u2019d never mentioned a word about monsters to her mother again.</p><p>The fire had been his idea. He\u2019d arranged for the patients to go on a \u201ctherapy trip\u201d that day. He\u2019d helped her to time the blaze, helped her to make certain every piece of evidence about her stay was destroyed.</p><p>She\u2019d been eleven years old when she entered Serenity Woods. At sixteen, she\u2019d torched the place.</p><p>Catch had taken her secret to his grave. But one other person knew all of the details of her stay at the psychiatric hospital.</p><p>Emily opened her car door, stood, and felt the cool breeze of fall blow against her body.</p><p>The house was waiting for her.</p><p>Emily straightened her shoulders, walked slowly up the stone sidewalk. A cheerful welcome mat greeted her at the entranceway.</p><p>The house was so normal.</p><p>\u201cNever trust anything normal. Cuz it\u2019s the normal stuff you\u2019ve got to fear. Monsters, demons, witches...we\u2019re all more afraid of that normal world than you can ever imagine.\u201d Catch\u2019s words rang in her ears. He\u2019d always thought humans were dangerous. Too unpredictable. \u201cThey\u2019re more bloodthirsty than we are, remember that.\u201d</p><p>Her hand curled into a fist. She rapped against the wooden door. Once, twice.</p><p>\u201cComing!\u201d Muffled, feminine. Shuffling footsteps followed the call. The door opened with a faint squeak.</p><p>A small, dark-haired woman in her early fifties blinked. \u201cEmily?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi, Mom.\u201d Deliberately, she kept her voice light, her body relaxed. \u201cMind if I come in?\u201d</p><p>Her mother\u2019s knuckles whitened around the door frame, but after a moment, she stepped back, and Emily walked slowly into the home she hadn\u2019t seen in years.</p><p>\u201cSo, the doctor\u2019s your girlfriend now, huh?\u201d Brooks asked as they approached Paradise Found. Two hulking guys were leaning against the outside of the building, their eyes scanning the streets.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not talking about her, Brooks.\u201d His partner was like a dog with a bone. A damn annoying dog.</p><p>\u201cWell, it looked like she was your girlfriend. I mean, I hope you don\u2019t get that friendly in the Crypt with just every woman you meet.\u201d</p><p>The two men finally caught sight of them. They stiffened. One pulled out a radio and spoke quickly.</p><p>Good. Let the bastard know we\u2019re here.</p><p>\u201cDamn. I think our boys are carrying.\u201d Finally, the guy was talking about something other than Emily. Brooks reached for his weapon. \u201cYou didn\u2019t tell me this Niol guy had muscle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, he\u2019s got muscle.\u201d Money. Muscle. And a serious attitude problem. Not the ideal candidate for an impromptu interrogation.</p><p>Colin flashed his badge to the guys at the door. Wondered if they were human or demon. For a moment, he wished he\u2019d brought the doc with him. But he hadn\u2019t been able to find her at the precinct.</p><p>The woman had run from him. Not a good sign.</p><p>But he\u2019d track her. Apologize for jumping on her like a starving asshole. He\u2019d just been desperate for a taste of her, and he\u2019d given in to the driving hunger.</p><p>A woman like her, a classy lady used to fancy restaurants and shows, she wouldn\u2019t like being pushed up against a dirty wall and stripped. Oh no, she wouldn\u2019t like that a damn bit.</p><p>He was prepared to apologize. And he was also prepared to get her naked beneath him. At the earliest opportunity.</p><p>The men grunted as they looked at his ID. \u201cWhaddya want?\u201d The bigger guy asked the question. The fellow had to be six foot seven, maybe eight, and his body was covered with brightly colored tattoos.</p><p>\u201cWe want to see Niol.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you now?\u201d The other guy stepped forward, the radio gripped in his hands. \u201cYou got a warrant?\u201d</p><p>Ah, definitely not new to the game. Colin glanced toward Brooks, saw from his partner\u2019s lifted brow that he was thinking the same thing.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not here to search the bar,\u201d Brooks told him, flashing his I\u2019m-harmless-and-want-to-be-your-friend smile. \u201cWe just need to ask your boss a few questions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, maybe he don\u2019t wanna answer yer questions.\u201d Tattooed crossed his beefy arms over his chest and glowered at them.</p><p>The radio crackled to life. The smaller guy pushed a button. \u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet \u2019em through.\u201d</p><p>Tattooed swore.</p><p>The smaller guy glared at them as he jerked his thumb toward the door. \u201cGo on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d Colin muttered, and lifted his hand to his holster as he went inside. No telling what kind of reception Niol could have waiting for them...</p><p>The interior of Paradise Found was lit only by a few weak lights. Niol sat at a table near the bar, a pair of dark sunglasses over his eyes. He didn\u2019t rise when they approached, just inclined his head and said, \u201cDetective, back so soon, eh?\u201d A taunting smile curved his lips. \u201cThat\u2019s the way it is for most folks. They find my place a bit...addictive.\u201d</p><p>Yeah, he just bet they did.</p><p>\u201cDrink?\u201d</p><p>Colin shook his head.</p><p>\u201cAnd what about you, Detective Brooks, can I get you a...whiskey, isn\u2019t it? That is your drink of choice, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not thirsty.\u201d Brooks didn\u2019t appear the least bit surprised that Niol knew who he was or even his favorite drink. The guy had always been able to bluff his way through anything.</p><p>The chair squeaked as Niol leaned back. \u201cI take it this isn\u2019t a social call?\u201d</p><p>Colin reached into his jacket pocket. Pulled out the photos Smith had given him and tossed them onto the table. \u201cRecognize these men?\u201d They were head shots, but it was clear the guys were dead.</p><p>Niol touched one of the photos. \u201cWhat happened to them?\u201d Something that could have been anger hardened his words.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you know?\u201d Colin stared back at him and kept his body loose, ready.</p><p>Very slowly, Niol took off his glasses. Colin heard a faint gasp of surprise come from Brooks.</p><p>\u201cYou think I did this?\u201d Eyes as black as night stared back at him. A table to the left began to tremble.</p><p>Colin wasn\u2019t impressed. \u201cDid you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot my style.\u201d Niol shoved the pictures away. \u201cIf I\u2019d attacked them, there wouldn\u2019t have been enough left for a picture.\u201d</p><p>His words had the ring of truth.</p><p>\u201cYou know them, don\u2019t you?\u201d Brooks asked as he stepped to the edge of the table.</p><p>Niol nodded. \u201cI\u2019ve seen them around Paradise.\u201d A vague admission, nothing more, but Colin had seen the tightening of the man\u2019s lips. The flaring of his nostrils. Hell, yeah, he knew the guys.</p><p>\u201cYou sent them to jump me and Dr. Drake the other night, didn\u2019t you?\u201d Colin leaned over the table, getting right in Niol\u2019s face. He wasn\u2019t scared of the demon, didn\u2019t give a shit what level he was. If the guy had tried to have Emily killed, he was going to fucking rip him apart.</p><p>The demon didn\u2019t so much as blink. \u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBullshit!\u201d Now Brooks was the one crowding him. He\u2019d stalked around the table. Come right to Niol\u2019s side. \u201cYou know who these guys are and you hired them to rough up my partner and the doctor!\u201d</p><p>Niol sighed softly and pushed away from the table. \u201cI can see this isn\u2019t going to be a productive little talk.\u201d He began to stand, but Brooks caught him by the shoulder, holding him in place.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not finished.\u201d</p><p>Colin felt the push of power then, felt the stir in the air\u2014</p><p>Brooks was shoved across the room. Shoved a good ten feet. But Niol never touched him. His partner crashed into a table, fell to the floor.</p><p>Brooks jumped to his feet. \u201cYou sonofabitch!\u201d He ran forward, arms outstretched.</p><p>Colin stepped in front of him. \u201cEasy.\u201d The air seemed to be pushing against him, vibrating with malevolent force.</p><p>The doc would definitely have come in handy then.</p><p>\u201cKeep your partner under control, Gyth.\u201d Niol lifted his chin, stared at him with those creepy-as-hell eyes. \u201cOr I will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe assaulted me!\u201d Brooks snapped, jerking his jacket back into place. \u201cWe can arrest the bastard.\u201d</p><p>Niol shrugged. \u201cI never touched you. Ask your partner, he\u2019ll tell you.\u201d</p><p>Colin\u2019s jaw clenched. Brooks was no match for this guy. But Colin sure as hell would like to get two minutes alone with him.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t fuck with my partner again, Niol. You won\u2019t like the consequences.\u201d</p><p>A flash of amusement lightened his face. \u201cYou think you could actually take me on?\u201d</p><p>A powerful shifter is the only Other that can match a demon\u2019s strength. Emily had told him that. And the doc knew her supernaturals. \u201cNo, I know I could.\u201d</p><p>The amusement vanished.</p><p>\u201cNow cut the crap, Niol, and tell us what you know.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The demon\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u201cThe kids have been in the bar a few times. That\u2019s all I know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWere they working for you?\u201d Brooks had regained some of his control, but anger still tinged his words.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Niol picked up his glass, took a long swallow. \u201cI told you, not my method.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLook me in the eye,\u201d Colin demanded, \u201cand tell me that you didn\u2019t send them to attack me and the doc.\u201d</p><p>Niol met his stare. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t send someone to hurt Dr. Drake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019d send someone after my partner?\u201d Brooks pounced on the words Niol hadn\u2019t spoken.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Niol never looked away from him. \u201cI\u2019d do that myself.\u201d</p><p>He believed him. Shit. Colin finally lifted his right hand off his holster. \u201cIf you didn\u2019t send them, who did?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Niol picked up his sunglasses, slid them back into place. \u201cBut I intend to find out.\u201d His face hardened. \u201cNo one uses my boys like this. No one.\u201d</p><p>They were wasting their time. Niol wasn\u2019t going to tell them anything else, and Colin actually believed the demon might not know much else.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll be in touch again, Niol,\u201d Colin told him.</p><p>\u201cOh, I don\u2019t doubt that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on,\u201d he muttered to Brooks. Time to get out of the devil\u2019s den. Bringing Brooks had been a mistake, but there hadn\u2019t seemed an easy way of ditching his partner. Not without raising too many questions.</p><p>Brooks shot a long, hard look at Niol. \u201cI\u2019m gonna be watching you from now on.\u201d</p> <p>Niol didn\u2019t look particularly impressed.</p><p>\u201cYou fuck up, you do anything that suggests you were lying to us, I\u2019ll be back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll look forward to your visit. But until then, get out of my bar, Detective Brooks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGladly.\u201d</p><p>Definitely a mistake bringing Brooks. He would never be able to handle a war with Niol. He didn\u2019t know who he was messing with.</p><p>Colin followed Brooks to the exit, trying to keep his body between Niol and his partner, just in case Niol was in the mood for any more of his little magical routines.</p><p>\u201cGyth...\u201d</p><p>Niol\u2019s call stopped him just feet from the door. Colin glanced back.</p> <p>\u201cA word if you will.\u201d A pause. \u201cAlone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, hell, no, that\u2019s not gonna\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right, Brooks. You can wait outside. We\u2019ve got some... Other business to discuss.\u201d That would be the only reason Niol would ask him to stay.</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d Brooks looked seriously pissed. \u201cBut if you need me, all you have to do is call out, and I\u2019ll be at your side.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t doubt it for a minute. \u201cThanks, man.\u201d He waited until Brooks pushed open the door and stepped out into the light.</p><p>Then he crossed the room in two seconds. \u201cWhat didn\u2019t you tell me, Niol?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know the boys were demons.\u201d</p><p>No news there.</p><p>\u201cWhen you and the doctor were attacked, I felt the stir of power in the air.\u201d</p><p>So he\u2019d known about the attack. Renewed suspicion filled him.</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t me. You have my word on that.\u201d</p><p>But how much was the word of a demon worth? \u201cYou felt the attack, but you didn\u2019t try to stop it? I thought you said you wouldn\u2019t hurt Emily.\u201d</p><p>Niol stroked the top of his glass. Looked vaguely amused. \u201cWho do you think called the cops? I mean, your brothers in blue have to be good for something, right?\u201d</p><p>Colin wasn\u2019t amused. \u201cIf it wasn\u2019t you, then who the fuck was it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnother level ten.\u201d He took a long swallow of the blood red drink. \u201cAnd believe me, Gyth, we\u2019re pretty damn rare.\u201d He sat the glass down with a soft thud. \u201cJust ask the pretty little monster doctor about that.\u201d</p><p>Another level ten. Shit. The day had not been good for him. And it had started so well, with Emily naked in bed with him.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you know about hybrids?\u201d</p><p>What? He\u2019d heard the term hybrid before, but usually it\u2019d been when he was watching TV and he\u2019d flipped past the Discovery Channel. Hybrids were blends, mixes, like a flower produced from combining two different\u2014</p><p>\u201cHmmm. Guess Emily didn\u2019t mention hybrids to you.\u201d Niol\u2019s lips curved. \u201cNow I wonder why she wouldn\u2019t tell you about them.\u201d</p><p>Colin had the feeling he was missing a significant point in the conversation, and he didn\u2019t like that feeling. Not one damn bit.</p><p>He was around the table in a flash. He jerked the demon to his feet. \u201cI\u2019m not one of the humans you can screw around with.\u201d And he let the beast show in his eyes. His nails lengthened, his teeth sharpened.</p><p>\u201cShifter.\u201d Niol smiled. \u201cFigured that\u2019s what you were.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me about the hybrids.\u201d Before he gave into the urges of the beast and threw the bastard across the room. It\u2019s what the demon had done to Brooks. It was what he deserved.</p><p>\u201cSome Other don\u2019t mate with their own kind.\u201d He laughed, a grating, harsh sound. \u201cBut you\u2019ve already figured that out, haven\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>His claws dug into Niol\u2019s shoulders. Not enough to tear, not yet. \u201cSpit it out, demon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRarely, very, very rarely, a child is born from those matings. A special child.\u201d</p><p>Colin lifted his claws. \u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd he\u2019s a hybrid. A being of two magical lines, with the powers of both.\u201d</p><p>Why the hell were they even having this conversation? \u201cI should care about these fucking hybrids, why?\u201d</p><p>Niol laughed again. A long, dry laugh. \u201cOh, you should definitely care, shifter. You and Emily should care.\u201d</p><p>Ten more seconds. If the demon taunted him just a little longer, Niol would be flying across the room.</p><p>It\u2019d be payback for his little trick on Brooks, and it\u2019d make Colin feel damn good.</p><p>\u201cMy patience is running thin.\u201d His claws dug deeper. Niol flinched and finally stopped laughing.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve heard rumors...\u201d</p><p>Now they were getting somewhere. Colin eased his grip. \u201cWhat kind of rumors?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s talk of a hybrid demon in town. A strong demon, a nine or ten.\u201d</p><p>Strong enough to cause the surge of power Emily had felt in the alley. \u201cHalf demon, huh? What else is the bastard?\u201d</p><p>Niol pursed his lips. Glanced down at Colin\u2019s claws. \u201cShifter.\u201d</p><p>Oh, fuck.</p><p>\u201cYou gonna tell me what was going on back there?\u201d Brooks demanded as they marched back to Colin\u2019s Jeep.</p><p>\u201cWe were interrogating a suspect.\u201d Colin glanced up at the sky. The sun was setting, throwing blood red streaks across the sky.</p><p>He needed to find Emily. Needed to ask her about hybrids. Damn. Could the guy they were looking for be some uber-combination of demon and shifter? If so, then the case had just taken a very dangerous turn.</p><p>Fighting and tracking another shifter was hard enough. But with a demon\u2019s magical powers...</p><p>The city could be screwed.</p><p>\u201cDammit, Colin! You know what I\u2019m talking about!\u201d Brooks grabbed him, shoved him against the back of the Jeep.</p><p>The beast howled, but Colin hung on to his control.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re holding out on me.\u201d Brooks glared at him. \u201cYou know more about the case than you\u2019ve said.\u201d</p><p>Yeah, he did. And he\u2019d have to keep holding out on his partner. Because Brooks wasn\u2019t ready for the truth.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t even have my back in there when that bastard threw me across the room!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t throw you.\u201d Colin pushed away from the Jeep, crossed his arms over his chest, and met Brooks\u2019s angry stare.</p><p>\u201cThe hell he didn\u2019t, I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI watched his hands. He never touched you.\u201d True. The demon had used his powers to push Brooks. But how did he explain that?</p><p>\u201cI should have arrested him.\u201d Brooks rolled his left shoulder. \u201cA night in the pen would have made him talk.\u201d</p><p>Doubtful. A night in the pen more likely would have resulted in Niol driving the guards insane. Literally.</p><p>\u201cAnd what the hell was up with his eyes?\u201d He shuddered. \u201cWho\u2019d want to wear contacts like that? Everything was pitch black.\u201d</p><p>He wanted to tell Brooks the truth.</p><p>But the last time he\u2019d told his partner the truth about the Other, Colin had wound up with a bullet in him.</p><p>\u201cI expect more from you, man.\u201d Brooks shook his head. \u201cWe\u2019ve been teamed up for two years now. I expect more.\u201d</p><p>He wanted to give more. Wished that he could tell Brooks everything.</p><p>But he couldn\u2019t guarantee his partner\u2019s reaction. And he didn\u2019t want to have to fight off another friend.</p><p>And the captain had said the case data he and the doc had collected was confidential. Too confidential for even Brooks.</p><p>At least for now.</p><p>Colin sighed. He had to offer Brooks something. The guy deserved that much. \u201cYou\u2019re right, there is more going on than I\u2019ve told you.\u201d</p><p>A muscle flexed along his partner\u2019s jaw. \u201cWhy the hell are you keeping me out of the loop? We\u2019re partners. \u201d</p><p>\u201cI have to. What\u2019s going on has been deemed classified.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>Damn. This wasn\u2019t going well. \u201cThere\u2019s stuff going on here\u2014it\u2019s too dangerous for you to know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo dangerous for me?\u201d His eyes narrowed to slits. \u201cBut let me guess. Dr. Drake knows, doesn\u2019t she? Why isn\u2019t it too dangerous for her?\u201d</p><p>It was. But the doc was already in too deep to pull out.</p><p>\u201cShit! I don\u2019t like this.\u201d Brooks jabbed a finger in the air near Colin\u2019s chest. \u201cNot a fucking bit.\u201d</p><p>Neither did he.</p><p>Brooks stalked around the Jeep. Jumped inside.</p><p>Colin sighed and rubbed the back of his neck. He\u2019d have to tell the captain that Brooks was getting suspicious.</p><p>Maybe McNeal would say he should confide in him.</p><p>Or maybe not.</p><p>Colin climbed inside. Started the engine.</p><p>\u201cI know he didn\u2019t touch me.\u201d Brooks wasn\u2019t looking at him. He was gazing straight through the windshield. \u201cI saw his hands too. I know Niol didn\u2019t touch me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrooks\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I felt his hands on me, I felt him throw me across the room.\u201d He clenched his fingers into fists. \u201cHow is that possible?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook, man, I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell.\u201d Brooks sighed. \u201cMaybe I\u2019m the one who needs to be seeing the doctor. If I\u2019m starting to imagine\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t imagine it.\u201d He spun out of the lot. He couldn\u2019t risk telling Brooks much, but he\u2019d be damned if he\u2019d let his friend think he was going crazy. \u201cI can\u2019t tell you what\u2019s happening, but believe me, you didn\u2019t imagine a damn thing.\u201d</p><p>No, his partner had just stepped into the world where monsters were real, and he didn\u2019t even realize it.</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t tell him the truth, Gyth. It\u2019s too risky.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I know that.\u201d But it didn\u2019t mean he had to like it. Colin paced around McNeal\u2019s office, tension tight in his body.</p><p>\u201cThe case is too big. I can\u2019t risk having one of my detectives losing his cool because he\u2019s suddenly aware that monsters are all around him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe might not,\u201d Colin muttered, gazing out the window into the darkness. Night had fallen over the city. It was a cloudy, starless night. The kind of night that hid secrets.</p><p>He had a bad feeling about the night. Niol\u2019s words about a hybrid had thrown him.</p><p>He wanted to talk to Emily. He\u2019d tried to call her several times since he\u2019d left Paradise Found, but he just kept getting her voice mail.</p><p>\u201cLook at what happened the last time you told your partner the truth.\u201d McNeal was behind his desk. Hands resting easily on the scarred surface.</p><p>The last time you told your partner the truth. Colin stiffened. \u201cWhat do you know about my old partner?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know everything.\u201d McNeal arched a brow. \u201cYou think I didn\u2019t do a full check on you before I brought you on down here? I know all about Mike Phillips.\u201d</p><p>Well, shit. \u201cAnd you didn\u2019t say anything?\u201d</p><p>McNeal shrugged. \u201cWhat\u2019s to say? Your ex-partner found out that you aren\u2019t human. He tried to kill you, burn down your house.\u201d</p><p>Yeah, that about summed it up.</p><p>The captain leaned forward. \u201cFrom what I learned, Phillips was unstable to begin with.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was a good man.\u201d He\u2019d been a good friend, until that night. \u201cHe just couldn\u2019t handle what I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBullshit. The guy had a history of being on the edge. He\u2019d attacked suspects, been warned by his superiors, and he\u2019d been stalking his ex-wife.\u201d</p><p>Colin didn\u2019t speak. Mike Phillips had been his best friend for ten years. Until that one night.</p><p>\u201cHe was fleeing the scene of the fire when he hit that truck, wasn\u2019t he?\u201d McNeal whistled softly. \u201cDriving ninety in a twenty-five, running through the red light, driving straight into the side of that big rig.\u201d</p><p>Colin clenched his back teeth.</p><p>\u201cHe was running, wasn\u2019t he? He\u2019d shot you, set the house on fire, then he left you to bleed out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAncient history.\u201d History he sure as hell didn\u2019t feel like rehashing right then.</p><p>\u201cBut it showed you how some humans can react.\u201d His fingers drummed against the desk. \u201cThey\u2019re not all like that, but the fanatics, the ones who think monsters should be destroyed, they\u2019re the reason we still live in secret.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou ever wonder what it would be like, Captain, if all the Other did reveal themselves? If we stopped pretending? Stopped hiding?\u201d If they all came out of the shadows, what would the world be like then?</p><p>\u201cYeah, I wonder...and I think half of \u2019em probably wouldn\u2019t give a damn about us being different.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the other half?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThey\u2019d get the torches and try to burn us all out.\u201d</p><p>Colin nodded. \u201cThat\u2019s what I figured.\u201d And the world wasn\u2019t ready for a war between the humans and the Other. \u201cSo I tell Brooks nothing.\u201d</p><p>McNeal nodded. \u201cIf he gives you trouble, send him to me.\u201d</p><p>No, he could handle Brooks. But, \u201cYou know, there are only so many times a man can see magic and deny it.\u201d And if Brooks got tossed across a room by a demon a few more times, odds were good his partner would start to put the facts together.</p><p>\u201cIf he figures out what\u2019s going on, we\u2019ll deal with it. With him.\u201d</p> <p>Easy words to say, but he knew Brooks wouldn\u2019t be that easy to handle. His gaze drifted to McNeal\u2019s desk. To the thin picture frame on the side.</p><p>A pretty, gray-haired lady smiled cheerfully. His eyes narrowed.</p><p>\u201cKeep any information you find on the Other strictly confidential. Brief me, no one else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d He heard the captain\u2019s words, but his attention was caught by the woman in the photo. He inched closer to the frame. The woman was holding something\u2014a basket!</p><p>He realized he was looking at a picture of the lady he\u2019d seen in Emily\u2019s office. Margie something. The woman with the hissing wicker basket.</p><p>\u201cMy mother.\u201d McNeal tapped the picture. \u201cRaised me by herself after my dad died in the war.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cUmm...\u201d He had to ask. \u201cWhat\u2019s in the basket?\u201d</p><p>A half smile curved McNeal\u2019s lips. \u201cDon\u2019t you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014\u201d</p><p>The phone beside McNeal rang. A loud, shrill cry. He picked it up, barking, \u201cMcNeal.\u201d</p><p>His eyes widened as he listened to the voice on the other end. \u201cWhat? When?\u201d</p><p>Colin tensed.</p><p>\u201cShit. My men are on their way.\u201d He slammed down the phone. Shot to his feet. \u201cGet Brooks and get down to the News Flash Five station. I\u2019ll call Emily, tell her to meet you there.\u201d</p><p>The News Flash Five station. \u201cWhat\u2019s happened?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSome intern just found Darla Mitchell\u2019s body. Her throat\u2019s been ripped out.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 11</p><p>He smelled the blood the minute he climbed out of his Jeep. Caught the coppery scent on the wind.</p><p>A line of reporters from other stations had already gathered. Lights were flashing. Cameras rolling. \u201cShit. Guess who\u2019s gonna be on every station at six o\u2019clock in the morning?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t have to guess. Dammit. The attention was just what the asshole wanted.</p><p>\u201cColin!\u201d He turned at the feminine cry, found Emily hurrying toward him. Her hair was loose, her glasses slightly askew.</p><p>His insides seemed to tighten as he stared at her. He didn\u2019t want her going inside. Didn\u2019t want her seeing the carnage that waited.</p><p>But he needed her. And the needs of the cop had to outweigh the man\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to talk to Smith. See what she\u2019s saying about the victim.\u201d Brooks stepped away, disappearing into the swarm of blue uniforms.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s happening?\u201d Emily\u2019s gaze darted to the line of police cruisers. \u201cMcNeal just told me to get down here, fast.\u201d</p><p>Shit. She didn\u2019t even know what she was walking into. He grabbed her arm, pulled her with him. \u201cAnother murder. Same MO as Myers.\u201d He bent, crouching under the yellow line of police tape at the entrance to the station.</p><p>Emily sucked in a sharp breath. \u201cHe struck again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said he probably would.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but I\u2019d hoped I was wrong.\u201d She licked her lips. \u201cThe victim...who is it?\u201d</p><p>Colin flashed his badge to the cops blocking the crime scene. Emily pulled her ID out of her bag. \u201cShe\u2019s working the case as a profiler,\u201d he said.</p><p>The scent of blood was stronger now. Clogging his nostrils. Tickling the back of his throat.</p><p>If he\u2019d been in his other form, he would have relished the smell. The beast loved the scent.</p><p>But the man hated it.</p><p>\u201cColin.\u201d Emily pulled against his hand. \u201cWho\u2019s the victim?\u201d</p><p>He dropped her fingers. Pulled out his latex gloves. Time to get to work. \u201cDarla Mitchell.\u201d He shoved open the door and walked into hell.</p><p>It was the same as before. The exact same.</p><p>Darla\u2019s prone body lay on the floor, a pool of blood surrounding her body. Her throat had been ripped away, torn, clawed. Her eyes were wide open, frozen in horror, and her mouth was twisted in a silent scream.</p><p>She\u2019d been pretty in life. But death hadn\u2019t been so kind.</p><p>Emily stared down at her still figure. The scents of blood and death filled her nostrils. Around her, she could vaguely hear a buzz of conversation. Brooks was whispering with Smith. Colin was talking to a uniformed officer, ordering the guy to get every piece of surveillance data the station had. A man in a white coat was walking around the body, snapping pictures.</p><p>And Darla stared up at her. Screaming.</p><p>Emily closed her eyes. Felt the rage simmering in the room. So strong...</p><p>She drew in a deep breath, exhaled slowly. The kill was fresh. And the dark power of the killer still hung in the air like a looming shadow.</p><p>There was no doubt in her mind that the killer who\u2019d savaged Preston Myers and the killer who\u2019d ripped out Darla\u2019s throat were one and the same. Even the blood spatters on the wall looked similar.</p><p>The taint of power surrounded her, and Emily realized there was something familiar about that remnant energy. About the hate and twisted fury.</p><p>Her eyes opened, scanned the room. Colin was a few steps away from her. Should she warn him about what she was going to do?</p><p>But what if she did and the others overheard? Too many people were in the small room. No, she\u2019d just be careful. Not pry too deeply into his mind.</p><p>But she had to see...</p><p>Emily looked back at the body and slowly, very slowly, lowered the mental shield in her mind.</p><p>Shit. I can\u2019t believe the bastard struck again so soon. We\u2019d better find his face on the security camera. No way could he have gotten in and out of this place without someone knowing. The station\u2019s a freaking zoo.</p><p>Colin\u2019s mind. She pushed his thoughts away, tried to link with the flow of the killer.</p><p>I hope she didn\u2019t suffer.</p><p>Her brow furrowed. Not the killer. This guy felt...too sad, but he was definitely Other. Her head lifted and she looked toward the door. A young, uniformed cop stood in the entranceway, his hands clenched into fists. He hadn\u2019t been there when she\u2019d arrived.</p><p>Must have just come on duty.</p><p>A charmer.</p><p>She dismissed him, tried to search again. Damn. It\u2019d been so long since she\u2019d lowered her shields with a group of people. It was hard to narrow her focus. So hard to\u2014</p><p>The bitch was too easy to kill.</p><p>Emily stiffened. That wasn\u2019t some kind of remnant energy.</p><p>Her blood tasted good. He could still feel it on his tongue.</p><p>Shit. Her body began to tremble. She moved her head carefully, inch by inch. Scanned the room.</p><p>Colin and the young cop were the only supernaturals she saw.</p><p>She was been better than that other bastard. Tasted sweeter. Maybe I\u2019ll go for a woman again the next time too.</p><p>Emily took one halting step toward the door, then another. Her body felt weighted, but at the same time it was as if she were being pulled. Pulled toward him.</p><p>The killer.</p><p>He was still in the building.</p><p>She had to find him.</p><p>Without a moment\u2019s hesitation, she dropped her shields all the way. Felt a flood of hot, dark power singe her, and she lunged for the door.</p><p>She\u2019d find him now; she had his psychic trail. She\u2019d get him and\u2014</p><p>\u201cWhere the hell are you going?\u201d Brooks stepped in front of her, frowning. \u201cThis is a crime scene, Dr. Drake, you can\u2019t go running\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet out of my way.\u201d</p><p>The cops are right in front of me. The fucking idiots. Maybe I\u2019ll do one of them next. Yeah, that\u2019d be good.</p><p>Brooks lifted a brow but stepped back.</p><p>Would cops taste different? Would they try to fight more?</p><p>Emily hurried out of Darla\u2019s office. Looked to the left. That way.</p><p>Cops were searching the hall, some crouching. Standing. Some were talking to reporters.</p><p>The dark trail of power was stronger now. Closer.</p><p>She shouldn\u2019t have fucked with me. Should have left the doctor alone.</p><p>Emily froze as she caught his thought. The doctor.</p><p>Darla had asked her questions at the press conference. Asked her about demons.</p><p>Had the killer known?</p><p>\u201cEmily!\u201d Colin\u2019s voice. A loud, demanding cry that turned every head in the hallway.</p><p>The voice in her mind shut off. The twisting power dissipated.</p><p>Shit.</p><p>Emily ran down the hallway, ignoring Colin\u2019s call. It was like the guy had just thrown up some kind of block. No, not a block. A shield. A shield just like hers.</p><p>That didn\u2019t make a damn bit of sense. She\u2019d never met a shifter who had enough psychic power to put up a shield. A demon, yes, but not a shifter.</p><p>She pushed past two cops. Turned the corner. And ran straight into Jake.</p><p>\u201cDr. Drake!\u201d His eyes widened and his arms automatically wrapped around her as she barreled into him.</p><p>She felt the weak flow of his magic surround her.</p><p>Not the guy she was looking for. \u201cExcuse me.\u201d She pulled away from him, ran straight ahead.</p><p>But there was nothing. No telltale pull of power. No sign of any high-level supernaturals.</p><p>\u201cEmily, what are you doing?\u201d Colin grabbed her elbow, spun her around. \u201cWhy are you running?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe killer. He\u2019s still in the building. Or he was...just a moment ago.\u201d</p><p>His fingers tightened around her. \u201cHow do you know? Did you see something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI heard him.\u201d</p><p>Colin frowned, and Emily realized that her words probably weren\u2019t making much sense. But they were wasting time and she had to hurry.</p><p>\u201cI lowered my shielding, okay?\u201d Her voice was a whisper. \u201cI wanted to see if I could sense anything about the killing and I-I sensed him. Heard his thoughts. Colin, he was here, just seconds ago.\u201d</p><p>He reached for his gun. \u201cYou still hear \u2019im?\u201d</p><p>Emily bit her lip. \u201cHis voice stopped. When you called my name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably because the bastard realized you were here and that you could track him.\u201d</p><p>Yes, but how had a shifter known that?</p><p>Colin raised his voice, calling out to the cops. \u201cI want a lockdown on this building. Round up every single employee. Put them all in one room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt might not be one of the employees,\u201d Emily said, leaning in close to him. \u201cColin, the killer could be a cop.\u201d</p><p>He swore.</p><p>\u201cI-I need to go over every inch of this building, see if I can find him.\u201d</p><p>He clamped his hand around her wrist. \u201cYou\u2019re not goin\u2019 anywhere without me, Doc.\u201d</p><p>His gun was drawn, ready. \u201cNow let\u2019s go find the bastard.\u201d</p><p>But they didn\u2019t find him. They searched the entire station, roof to basement. Emily saw every employee, studied every cop, but she couldn\u2019t find the killer.</p><p>The only Other she saw were Colin, the young charmer cop, and Jake Donnelley. And none of those men had the right magic trail to match the killer.</p><p>He\u2019d gotten away. Somehow, he\u2019d managed to slip past the police and escape.</p><p>Dammit.</p><p>They were back in Darla\u2019s office. Her body had been covered by a sheet, and two men pushing a gurney were entering the room.</p><p>Emily pulled off her glasses, rubbed the bridge of her nose. She\u2019d been so close, and that bastard had gotten away.</p><p>\u201cCrime scenes can be hard, can\u2019t they?\u201d</p><p>She jerked at the soft voice, so close to her back. Emily turned around, found Smith staring at her with sympathy in her dark eyes.</p><p>\u201cUmm, yeah, they can be.\u201d Anything that involved a dead, bloody body automatically fell under \u201chard\u201d in her book.</p><p>\u201cI saw you run out earlier.\u201d Smith hesitated. \u201cAre you all right?\u201d</p><p>Emily realized what her sudden fast and furious departure must have looked like.</p><p>The profiler couldn\u2019t handle the crime scene.</p><p>But it wasn\u2019t like she could tell Smith the truth. So she forced a smile. \u201cI\u2019m fine now.\u201d Actually, she was furious. The murdering bastard had gotten away from her. If she\u2019d had just a few more minutes to track him\u2014</p><p>\u201cMy first few scenes made me sick. I mean, I\u2019d been in medical school, and I\u2019d seen dead bodies before.\u201d Smith shook her head.</p><p>\u201cBut seeing a person like this, a person who fought to live just hours ago...\u201d She sighed. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to get used to.\u201d</p><p>Emily wasn\u2019t sure she\u2019d ever get used to seeing bodies that had been savaged like Darla\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you go on home?\u201d Smith suggested. \u201cIt\u2019s late, and there can\u2019t be much else you can do here tonight.\u201d</p><p>No, there wasn\u2019t anything else she could do. The killer was gone, the reporter was dead, and she was left with the twisted flow of the Night Butcher\u2019s rage sliding through her mind.</p><p>\u201cGood idea,\u201d she muttered. \u201cTell Colin I left, will you?\u201d Cause she didn\u2019t want to face him again just then. After they\u2019d finished searching, he\u2019d looked at her with...damn, had that been doubt in his eyes? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Did the man think she\u2019d made up the story about hearing the killer?</p><p>Hell, she really did need to get out of there.

Maybe next time I\u2019ll catch you first, you sonofabitch.</p><p>\u201cHey, Gyth! There\u2019s a guy here who says he has to talk to you.\u201d</p><p>Colin glanced up from Darla\u2019s desk. Saw Jake Donnelley peering over a uniform\u2019s shoulder.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s that?\u201d Brooks asked, straightening to better study him.</p> <p>\u201cDarla\u2019s cameraman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThink he knows something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne way to find out.\u201d He shoved to his feet, stalked over to meet the demon.</p><p>\u201cW-we need to talk.\u201d Jake was sweating.</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d Colin stepped into the hallway. The area had cleared out a lot in the last hour. Even as he spoke, Darla\u2019s body was wheeled out.</p><p>Jake looked at the body bag, gulped, then hurriedly glanced away.</p> <p>\u201cWhat do you know, Donnelley? Did you see something? The killer?\u201d If only he could be that lucky.</p><p>Jake shook his head. \u201cDidn\u2019t see anything. But you need to know\u2014\u201d He broke off as a female cop passed them. Lowering his voice, he continued, \u201cYou need to know what Darla was working on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d His interest was caught but he played it cool and easy. \u201cAnd what story was she investigating?\u201d</p><p>Jake met his gaze. \u201cDr. Drake.\u201d</p><p>Do you still see demons? Colin kept his face expressionless. \u201cWhat about her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDarla found out that Dr. Drake was sent to one of them psych wards when she was a kid.\u201d</p><p>I never said I worked there.</p><p>Shit. \u201cShe was going to run the story, wasn\u2019t she?\u201d</p> <p>Jake nodded.</p><p>\u201cAnd is this the only story Darla was working on?\u201d Please, let there be something else.</p><p>\u201cOther than the robbery at Southern Bank, yeah.\u201d</p><p>Not good. \u201cYou told anybody else about this?\u201d</p><p>Jake shook his head. \u201cNot gonna either.\u201d His face tightened. \u201cWe both know why the doctor got sent to that place. And we know she wasn\u2019t seeing things.\u201d</p><p>He could all too easily imagine Emily as a child, seeing demons and monsters wherever she turned. Yeah, he knew why she\u2019d wound up at Serenity Woods.</p><p>\u201cAll right, Donnelley. Thanks for the tip.\u201d</p><p>The cameraman shuffled off down the hallway.</p><p>Colin watched him for a moment, then turned back to the crime scene. He needed to find Emily. His gaze searched the room.</p><p>Where is she?</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d Brooks stepped forward. \u201cWhat\u2019d the guy have to say?\u201d</p><p>Colin shrugged. \u201cNothing really.\u201d He met his partner\u2019s stare straight on. Lying wasn\u2019t hard for him. He\u2019d been doing it his whole life. \u201cJust that Darla was working on a bank robbery story before she was killed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Brooks\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u201cThat was all he said?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Emily wasn\u2019t in the room. \u201cWhere\u2019s Dr. Drake?\u201d</p><p>Smith brushed by him, paused. \u201cShe left about twenty minutes ago. Said she\u2019d check in at the station tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>His stomach clenched. It was okay. The doc knew how to take care of herself. So she\u2019d gone home alone. No big deal.</p><p>Except he was sure someone had been watching her house. Watching her.</p><p>And she\u2019d just tapped into a killer\u2019s mind.</p><p>Probably no need to worry\u2014 ah, bullshit. \u201cCan you finish things here?\u201d he asked Brooks.</p><p>\u201cUh, yeah. There are just a few more interviews\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d The word had barely passed his lips before he marched out of the room, moving faster, faster with each step.</p><p>His gut was tight, and his instincts were screaming at him.</p><p>Something was wrong. He had to get to Emily.</p><p>All of the lights were out. Emily sat in her car, staring up at her house. She\u2019d left the light in the den on; she always did. But the house was dark. Too dark.</p><p>The bulb could have blown. She hadn\u2019t changed it in a few weeks\u2014or, hell, she really couldn\u2019t remember the last time she\u2019d changed it.</p><p>Emily climbed slowly out of the car. Just because the house was dark, it didn\u2019t mean anything. She was jumpy because of the crime scene. Seeing a woman with her throat ripped out would make anyone a bit uncertain.</p><p>She pulled out her cell phone as she walked up the steps. Gripped her keys in her right hand. Her heart was racing, the drumming shaking her chest all because her light was out.</p><p>The porch light should have been on, too, Emily realized. It was night, so the light should have come on automatically.</p><p>Her shoes crunched against something hard. Sharp. Emily glanced down. It looked like...white glass. Her gaze darted up to the porch light. The bulb was broken.</p><p>Her breath caught. Two lights\u2014that was too big of a coincidence for her. Her thumb pushed the call button on her phone. She\u2019d programmed Colin\u2019s cell in yesterday. Emily started to back up.</p><p>\u201cGyth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI-I think someone\u2019s been in my house.\u201d Her voice was hushed as she retreated another slow step.</p><p>\u201cEmily? Is that you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? I can barely hear you\u2014\u201d</p><p>Cause she didn\u2019t want to raise her voice and alert whoever might be inside. \u201cSomeone\u2019s been in my house,\u201d she repeated quietly.</p><p>\u201cShit.\u201d Good, he\u2019d heard her. \u201cI\u2019m on my way, baby. Get in your car and stay there until\u2014\u201d</p><p>The wooden step behind her creaked. Her blood seemed to freeze.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t in the house. He was out there, with her.</p><p>Her fingers tightened around the keys. They were the only weapon she had. Drawing in a deep breath, Emily spun around, raising the keys and screaming.</p><p>He was ready for her. The guy punched out with his hand, catching her in the cheek and sending her sprawling back against the porch.</p><p>The cell phone fell from her fingers, crashed onto the wood.</p><p>And Emily realized that Colin wouldn\u2019t arrive soon enough.</p><p>She was on her own.</p><p>Just as she\u2019d always been.</p><p>\u201cEmily? Emily! Fuck! \u201d The line was dead. He punched in a call to 911. \u201cThis is Detective Colin Gyth. Badge number 2517. I\u2019ve got an assault in progress.\u201d Shit, he hoped he didn\u2019t. If anyone so much as touched Emily, the guy would find out just how much of an animal he could be. \u201cSend patrols out now to 602 Lyons Lane.\u201d</p><p>He slammed the gas pedal down to the floor of the Jeep.</p><p>Hold on, baby, I\u2019m coming.</p><p>The fight was short and brutal. Emily crouched on the porch, her cheek burning. The guy lunged for her, but she was ready. She couldn\u2019t see much in the dark, so she kicked out, aiming for what she sure as hell hoped was his groin.</p><p>He grunted, fell back. \u201cBitch!\u201d</p><p>Yeah, she was. Emily leaped up, drove the keys down into his arm as hard as she could.</p><p>He grabbed her wrist, grinding bones together until she gasped and dropped the keys.</p><p>\u201cFucking demon. You\u2019re gonna pay.\u201d His voice was a high-pitched whisper, the whisper of...a boy?</p><p>And had he just called her a demon?</p><p>She twisted her hand, trying to break free. God, hadn\u2019t someone heard her scream? The Grantons had come back from Disney World two days ago\u2014they should have heard her.</p><p>Emily opened her mouth, ready to scream so loud the dead would hear her, but her attacker slapped a thin, sweaty hand over her lips.</p><p>\u201cPrivate party, demon. No one else is invited.\u201d</p><p>She bit him. As hard as she could. Until she tasted blood.</p><p>He howled and jerked his hand back. And she screamed. And screamed.</p><p>A light flashed on at the Grantons.</p><p>Finally.</p><p>Her attacker swore, stumbled back. \u201cI\u2019ll be back for you, bitch.\u201d</p><p>Bitch or demon. Make up your mind, asshole.</p><p>Adrenaline pumped through her, and as he fled, for one mad moment, she actually thought about running after him.</p><p>Then she realized her hands were shaking. Her legs, hell, everything shook, and she didn\u2019t think that she could have made it four steps, much less all the way across the yard.</p><p>Her attacker ran to the wooded lot. For just an instant, the glow of a streetlight fell over him. He glanced back at her\u2014</p><p>Just a kid. A kid with hair too long, a face too thin, and eyes too big.</p><p>Then he was gone. Disappearing into the night.</p><p>\u201cEmily!\u201d Mark pounded up the steps, grabbed her, and pulled her to her feet.</p><p>Damn. When had she fallen again?</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCall the police...\u201d She swallowed, realized her throat was desert dry. Fear will do that to you.</p><p>She\u2019d been more scared of that kid than she had been tracking a killer through the News Flash Five station.</p><p>But Colin had been with her then. And she\u2019d known he\u2019d keep her safe.</p><p>She\u2019d trusted him.</p><p>Her knees began to shake again.</p><p>\u201cI thought I saw someone running\u2014\u201d Mark glanced toward the lot.</p><p>\u201cSome kid. He hit me.\u201d Called me a demon, said he\u2019d be back for me.</p><p>\u201cJesus.\u201d Mark wrapped his arm around her. \u201cLet\u2019s get inside and we\u2019ll call the cops.\u201d</p><p>They stepped forward, and Emily saw that her door was ajar. Oh, no, not a good sign.</p><p>She pushed the door all the way open. Stepped inside the small foyer. Turned on the light.</p><p>\u201cWhat in the hell...\u201d Mark\u2019s voice trailed off.</p><p>Emily crept forward. Hit the light switch for the den.</p><p>Destroyed. Her furniture had been smashed, her couch and love seat ripped apart. The TV was on the floor, the screen in pieces.</p><p>Papers, magazines, books littered the floor.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get out of here.\u201d Mark took her hand. \u201cGo back to my place and call\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cStep away from the woman, now!\u201d Colin\u2019s voice snarled from directly behind them.</p><p>Emily whirled around and heard Mark gasp in surprise. Colin stood in the doorway, his gun drawn, his face tight with fury.</p><p>Mark made the mistake of tightening his hold. \u201cYou don\u2019t understand, I\u2019m her neigh\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet your fucking hands off her or I\u2019ll shoot.\u201d His stare was intense. A turbulent blue that was, oh, shit, beginning to glow.</p><p>No, no, he couldn\u2019t shift. Not in front of Mark. She\u2019d never be able to explain that.</p><p>Emily stepped forward, pulling away from Mark\u2019s suddenly sweaty touch. \u201cIt\u2019s all right, Colin. Mark\u2019s my neighbor and\u2014\u201d</p><p>His gaze flashed to her face. Narrowed. The gun never wavered. \u201cWhat the hell happened to your cheek?\u201d</p><p>Emily lifted her hand to her right cheek. She could only imagine how the mark must look in the harsh light. \u201cSomeone was here when I arrived.\u201d A punk kid who thinks I\u2019m a demon. \u201cHe was waiting on the porch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck.\u201d</p><p>Yeah, that pretty much summed it up.</p><p>\u201cUmm...are you a policeman?\u201d Mark sounded like he very much hoped that was the case.</p><p>Colin grunted. Dropped his gun and grabbed Emily. He pulled her against his chest, wrapped his arms tightly around her, and just held her.</p><p>Emily squeezed her eyes shut to stop the stupid tears she could feel welling. Aftereffects, she was sure. But, oh, it sure felt good to be in his arms.</p><p>The edge of his fingers dug into her skin. He pulled back slowly, stared down at her. Then he kissed her. A hard, hot, open-mouthed kiss that stole her breath.</p><p>\u201cI guess you two know each other.\u201d</p><p>Sirens blared in the distance. Grew closer.</p><p>Emily wrapped her hands around Colin\u2019s shoulders, held him tighter.</p><p>God, but she loved the way the man kissed. Loved the smooth, sensual thrust of his tongue. Loved the faint bite of his teeth as he nibbled on her mouth.</p><p>His mouth lifted, just an inch. \u201cDon\u2019t ever scare me like that again.\u201d</p><p>A choked laugh slipped past her lips. \u201cI\u2019ll see what I can do.\u201d</p><p>Bright blue lights filled her yard, spilled through the open door.</p><p>The cavalry had arrived.</p><p>But too late to catch the bad guy.</p><p>Chapter 12</p><p>He took her back to his place. She\u2019d argued at first, saying she should stay at her house, try to clean, but the crime scene guys had nixed that idea.</p><p>They\u2019d left a team at her home, searching for fingerprints. Hairs. Anything that might give them a clue to the identity of the guy who\u2019d broken in.</p><p>A kid. Emily had given him a description of the boy. Pegged him for being around sixteen.</p><p>Colin didn\u2019t give a damn how old the guy was. He just wanted to find him, make him pay.</p><p>The punk had hit Emily. The red stain on her cheek had already turned into a faint brown bruise.</p><p>And her house\u2014 sonofabitch. All her clothes had been destroyed. Her bed. The dresser. Her books. Even her food\u2014the guy had dumped it all over the kitchen floor.</p><p>Emily\u2019s house had looked far too similar to Gillian Nemont\u2019s place, and Colin couldn\u2019t ignore the link. Hell, even the slash marks in the couch cushions had looked the same. Both were hard, long slashes from left to right.</p><p>Had the kid done both jobs? He\u2019d find out, when he found the boy.</p><p>And the fact that Gillian Nemont still hadn\u2019t turned up worried him. A lot. People didn\u2019t just disappear. Not without a damn good reason. Or help.</p><p>Initially, he\u2019d thought that Gillian had fled on her own. But now, now he was very much afraid that she\u2019d had help. The unfriendly kind.</p><p>\u201cI-I could have stayed in a hotel, you know.\u201d Emily stood beside the couch, looking tired, disheveled, and so beautiful she made him ache. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI wanted you to stay here.\u201d With him. Where he could keep an eye on her.</p><p>Colin stalked toward her. The woman had scared a good ten years off his life. He\u2019d heard her scream, then the phone had disconnected.</p><p>He\u2019d thought the Night Butcher had her.</p><p>He caught her chin in his hand. Forced her to look up, to meet his stare. \u201cI meant what I said before, Em. Don\u2019t scare me like that again.\u201d Because the beast had come too close to the surface. It had taken every ounce of his control to fight the change.</p><p>And when he\u2019d gone into her house, seen that guy with his hands on her\u2014</p><p>The change had started. His bones had begun to snap. His claws to lengthen.</p><p>It had only been when he\u2019d taken Emily into his arms that the beast had calmed. When he kissed her, held her, he\u2019d regained his control.</p><p>Lucky for her neighbor. Otherwise, the guy would have found out what it was like to have an angry shifter attack.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not like I did it deliberately, you know,\u201d Emily told him, and there was a faint bite to her tone. \u201cI didn\u2019t go out looking for some junior asshole to jump me.\u201d</p><p>No, she hadn\u2019t. But she had gone searching for a killer at the station without telling him. Which was about, oh, ten times worse in his book.</p><p>If he hadn\u2019t glanced up as she ran from the room, Emily would have gone off alone.</p><p>And what would she have done if she\u2019d actually managed to track the killer?</p><p>A cold fist seemed to squeeze his heart. Emily wasn\u2019t like him. She didn\u2019t have a shifter\u2019s strength or a demon\u2019s power.</p><p>She was human. Vulnerable. Weak. And right then, her vulnerability pissed him off.</p><p>\u201cYou have to be more careful.\u201d He dropped his hand but couldn\u2019t force himself to move back. Her scent was in the air, in his nostrils.</p><p>Emily arched a brow. \u201cI\u2019m not the cop. You\u2019re the one who likes to play with danger every day, not me.\u201d She sighed. \u201cDamn.</p><p>Look, I don\u2019t want to have this conversation right now, okay? I\u2019m tired, my face hurts, and I just want to crawl into bed.\u201d Emily turned away from him. Started to walk down the hall.</p><p>\u201cTell me about Serenity Woods.\u201d He hadn\u2019t meant to ask, not then, but the words just slipped out.</p><p>Emily stiffened. \u201cWe already talked about that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot enough we didn\u2019t. Darla Mitchell was planning to do a story on you. On Serenity Woods. An expos\u00e9.\u201d</p><p>She glanced back at him. \u201cShe wouldn\u2019t have had any real proof. The story never would\u2019ve aired.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI mean she had an informer who fed her details about me, sure, but that person wouldn\u2019t have gone public.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I visited my dear mother earlier today and warned her to stop talking to reporters.\u201d One shoulder lifted, fell. \u201cMy mom\u2019s a bit naive. She didn\u2019t understand what she was doing when she spoke with Darla.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t understand she was selling out her daughter? He didn\u2019t press on that issue. Better save it for later. \u201cSo Darla didn\u2019t have any other evidence?\u201d</p><p>Emily turned to fully face him. \u201cI had my little stay at Serenity Woods more than twenty years ago. The records room burned down about five years after I was released.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo no staff members could come forward and talk?\u201d The cop in him just couldn\u2019t shut off.</p><p>\u201cThere is such a thing as patient confidentiality, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I know that rule doesn\u2019t apply to orderlies or janitors or secretaries or\u2014\u201d</p><p>Her hand lifted. \u201cNo one would talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sure seem damn sure of that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am.\u201d Her lips tightened. \u201cThe humans there were made to...forget my stay.\u201d</p><p>Alarm bells rang in his head. \u201cAnd just how did that nice trick happen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe psychiatrist in charge of the facility, Dr. Catcherly, he wasn\u2019t human. He was a level-six demon, strong enough to plant suggestions in people\u2019s minds.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd he made the staff forget about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Emily swallowed, balled her hands into fists. \u201cI wasn\u2019t crazy, you know. I just didn\u2019t understand what was happening to me.</p><p>I tried to tell my mother, but she didn\u2019t believe me. She thought I was having some kind of breakdown, like my dad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour dad?\u201d</p><p>Emily shook her head. \u201cHis obituary in the paper said that he\u2019d died in a hunting accident.\u201d A short, bitter laugh tumbled past her lips. \u201cBut there was no accident. He picked up a gun, put it in his mouth, and pulled the trigger.\u201d</p><p>Jesus. That detail sure hadn\u2019t been in her background check.</p><p>\u201cI was seven when I found him.\u201d She swallowed. \u201cI\u2019d already started seeing things by then. And when my dad killed himself, my mom just...she didn\u2019t want to hear that I was seeing things. She didn\u2019t want me to be...like he was.\u201d</p><p>Her husband had eaten his gun. Her kid was talking about seeing monsters. No wonder Emily had ended up in a psych ward.</p><p>\u201cI just wanted her to believe me,\u201d Emily whispered, \u201cbut I guess I was asking too much.\u201d</p><p>He reached for her hand. Tightened his fingers around hers. \u201cI understand.\u201d</p><p>Her gaze met his. \u201cI know you do.\u201d</p><p>He pulled her closer. Lifted his left hand to stroke her lips. Such soft, sweet lips.</p><p>Her mouth parted on a gentle breath.</p><p>Keeping his eyes on hers, he lowered his head, brought his mouth to hers. Tasted her.</p><p>His tongue pushed into her mouth slowly. A long, deep thrust. Her tongue met his, sliding, stroking.</p><p>His cock tightened.</p><p>Hell, he\u2019d been in a state of semiarousal ever since the kiss at her house. And having her in his arms again, feeling her mouth against his, her breasts against his chest, it was more temptation than he could handle.</p><p>His hand slid down the curve of her jaw, stroked her neck.</p><p>Emily pulled back, shaking her head. \u201cDon\u2019t treat me like this.\u201d</p><p>What?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not some delicate flower.\u201d</p><p>No, but she was a delicate human.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want gentle and easy tonight.\u201d She jerked off her shirt, tossed it onto the floor. \u201cI want you to take me, your way. Hard.</p><p>Fast. And deep.\u201d</p><p>The beast snarled in agreement.</p><p>\u201cI want you to make me forget that murdering bastard out there. That punk kid. Everything. I just want to feel you.\u201d</p><p>Colin jerked off his own shirt. \u201cAll you had to do was ask, baby.\u201d</p><p>Emily\u2019s green gaze swept down his body. She licked her lips, eyeing the erection that pressed against the front of his jeans.</p><p>Hunger pumped through him.</p><p>Emily pulled off her glasses, sat them near the TV. And slipped to her knees before him. \u201cBut before we get to the main event,\u201d she whispered, \u201cI think it\u2019s my turn to touch you.\u201d</p><p>Her fingers were rock steady as she reached for his jeans. A quick flick of her hand and the button unsnapped. The slow hiss of his zipper filled the air.</p><p>His cock sprang forward, lunging for her eager hands. He hadn\u2019t bothered with underwear. Never did.</p><p>Her fingers skimmed over his cock. Stroked from base to head. Her breath blew over him, slightly cool, and so arousing he shuddered.</p><p>A drop of pre-cum appeared on the head of his penis. Emily murmured softly and rubbed her index finger over the liquid. She glanced up at him and brought her finger to her lips. Tasted him.</p><p>\u201cUmm, nice.\u201d She held his gaze a moment longer. \u201cI like the way you taste.\u201d Her mouth hovered over his cock. Her tongue snaked out, licked the bulbous head of his arousal.</p><p>Oh, fuck, yes.</p><p>Then she took him inside, all the way inside the warm cavern of her mouth. Sucking. Licking. And stroking with her hand.</p><p>Damn, but the doc knows exactly how to touch me.</p><p>He reached down, found the soft weight of her breasts and fondled her.</p><p>She gasped against him. Oh, that felt good.</p><p>So he did it again. Stroked her. Slid his fingers beneath her lacy bra and found her nipples. He squeezed lightly, applying just enough pressure.</p><p>Her mouth trembled around him as she moaned.</p><p>His cock swelled even more. He began to thrust against her mouth. Shallow thrusts, then deeper, harder.</p><p>Her mouth was wet, warm, so fucking perfect that his orgasm was already building, building...</p><p>Her lips tightened around him as she sucked harder.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d He jerked away from her, his cock standing straight up.</p><p>Emily blinked up at him, her face flushed. \u201cDidn\u2019t you like\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, hell, yeah, baby.\u201d The woman had given him the best blow job of his life. \u201cYou wanted it my way, right?\u201d</p><p>She licked her lips, nodded.</p><p>Damn. Seeing her on the floor, on her knees before him, was making him so fucking hungry for her. He was fighting the beast. The animal in him wanted her just as badly as the man.</p><p>Maybe it was her vulnerability that drew the beast. He smelled prey.</p><p>And as for the man...He smelled her sweet cream. And he wanted her.</p><p>\u201cTake off the rest of your clothes.\u201d</p><p>Emily pushed to her feet. Began to walk down the hall.</p><p>\u201cNo. In here.\u201d</p><p>No way would he make it to the bedroom. He wanted her naked, open, and ready right then.</p><p>He sure as hell hoped that Emily had meant what she\u2019d said. Because they were definitely about to fuck his way.</p><p>Emily kicked off her shoes. Pushed down her skirt. And he almost climaxed right then.</p><p>She was wearing a thin scrap of black lace and a garter belt. A garter belt. He\u2019d seen those only in his dreams.</p><p>Who would have thought his button-downed little doc would have his dream underwear?</p><p>\u201cGet on your hands and knees.\u201d His voice was a guttural growl. More beast than man.</p><p>Emily tossed back her hair and damn if a come-hither smile didn\u2019t curve her lips as she slowly crouched on the floor. She placed her hands deliberately and pressed her knees against the wooden floor. Her hair trailed over her back, a silken mass that he wanted to touch.</p><p>But not as much as he wanted to touch her.</p><p>Her hips arched, her perfect ass tilted in the air. \u201cIs this what you wanted?\u201d</p><p>Hell, yes.</p><p>His teeth were lengthening. He\u2019d have to take care with her, have to\u2014</p><p>\u201cThen come take me.\u201d</p><p>Fuck.</p><p>His control snapped.</p><p>Colin lunged for her, hitting the floor hard, but he didn\u2019t care. His hands curled around her hips, and his mouth pressed against her back. He tasted her skin. Licked her and lightly bit her flesh.</p><p>Emily tossed back her head and lifted her hips. \u201cColin...\u201d A demand.</p><p>He shoved his jeans all the way down. Forced her legs farther apart. Then trailed his fingers over the soft curve of her ass.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want, Emily? What do you want me to do?\u201d</p><p>His hand slipped between the legs, found her warm, wet with arousal. He teased her, pushing his index finger just inside her small, tight opening, and rubbed his thumb against the center of her desire.</p><p>Her body stiffened. \u201cAh...God, yes!\u201d</p><p>He pulled his finger back, drove it deep. \u201cTell me what you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want you inside me.\u201d</p><p>He growled. Grabbed his cock with one hand. Reached for the foil packet in his pocket.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Emily twisted, glaring back at him. \u201cI want to feel you. \u201d</p><p>And he sure as hell wanted to feel her. But they had to be careful, they couldn\u2019t take any risks.</p><p>\u201cColin, I-I\u2019m protected and I\u2019m clean. And your kind\u2014you don\u2019t get sick anyway. So we don\u2019t need to worry.\u201d Her hips rolled against him. \u201cThis time, I just want you.\u201d</p><p>His right hand clamped over her hips. Positioned her. He lodged the head of his erection against her opening, felt the warm, creamy welcome of her sex. \u201cThen take me.\u201d</p><p>He plunged deep in one smooth, hard thrust.</p><p>Emily arched beneath him.</p><p>He pulled back, drove to the hilt. Again. Again.</p><p>Emily\u2019s hips were thrusting back against him, meeting him move for move. He was growling, she was moaning, the air was thick with the scent of their lovemaking.</p><p>Colin crouched over her, wrapping his body over hers as he thrust. Ah, damn, but she feels good. Tight. Hot. Wet.</p><p>So. Fucking. Perfect.</p><p>His hands covered hers. His nails sharpened.</p><p>Careful, careful\u2014</p><p>His mouth found the curve of her throat. Licked. Sucked.</p><p>Her hips rolled against him, her sex squeezed. She was close to climaxing. He could feel the slight stiffening of her body that signaled her coming release.</p><p>His teeth pressed against her throat. He could feel her pulse beating. Faster. Faster. The blood was pounding just beneath the skin.</p><p>The edge of his canines raked against her.</p><p>Emily gasped, bucked beneath him. She came, her body shaking, squeezing his cock as she whispered his name.</p><p>He shifted, freeing her hands, pulling back just enough to grab her hips so that he could thrust, harder, harder...</p><p>His mouth stayed on her throat.</p><p>If she were his mate, he\u2019d mark her again. A true mark. A mark of shared blood. Of bonding.</p><p>If she were his mate.</p><p>But she wasn\u2019t. She was human. Human.</p><p>His balls tightened. His spine stiffened. He clenched his teeth, forced his mouth to move away from the sweet flesh of her throat.</p><p>His hands were tight upon her. His hips pistoned. Oh, damn, it\u2019d never been like this before, never.</p><p>Colin came, pumping into her, shuddering, and spilling his seed in the hot depths of her body.</p><p>Moonlight spilled through the open window, fell onto the bed. Emily stretched slowly beneath the covers and turned onto her side, staring at Colin. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>His chest rose and fell slowly. But she knew he wasn\u2019t asleep. Not yet.</p><p>\u201cI-I need to ask you something, Colin.\u201d When she\u2019d gone into the bathroom, she\u2019d found scratch marks on her hips. And when they\u2019d been making love, she\u2019d felt the sharpened edge of his teeth against her. Strangely, she hadn\u2019t been frightened when she thought he was going to bite her.</p><p>She\u2019d been...aroused.</p> <p>And she\u2019d never been one of those girls with a vampire fetish.</p><p>But with Colin, none of her usual rules seemed to apply.</p><p>She lifted her hand, trailed her fingers over the broad expanse of his chest. She liked his chest. Liked the smooth muscles, the dark curling hair that arrowed down to his groin.</p><p>Her hand moved to his shoulder. Found the faint, raised scar.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want to know?\u201d He caught her hand. Brought it to his lips and kissed her palm.</p> <p>She drew in a quick breath. The signs were starting to mount up against Colin, and she really, really needed to know...\u201cColin, what animal do you carry?\u201d The teeth, the claws, the shining eyes\u2014had to be a panther, a leopard, or maybe a wolf.</p><p>He stiffened against her. \u201cDoes it matter?\u201d</p><p>Once, she would have said that it did. But now, she wasn\u2019t so sure. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to hide from me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you don\u2019t have to worry about the beast I carry.\u201d His fingers tightened around hers. \u201cI\u2019ll never let him hurt you. I control him, he doesn\u2019t control me.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d heard that from others before. Heard them swear they could contain the beast inside. And she\u2019d known they lied.</p><p>Because the beasts inside the shifters, they were strong. Deadly. And if the man was pushed too far, the animal would take over.</p> <p>It was the nature of the beast.</p><p>Someone was pounding at the door. Emily grabbed a pillow, pulled it over her head. No, no, she didn\u2019t want to wake up yet.</p><p>\u201cShit!\u201d A masculine growl that was way, way too close.</p><p>She shoved the pillow aside as her eyes snapped open. Colin. Her memory came flooding back.</p><p>Darla.</p><p>The killer.</p><p>The dumb-ass kid who\u2019d busted into her house.</p><p>And the hottest sex she\u2019d had in years.</p> <p>\u201cStay here.\u201d She had only seconds to admire his tight ass before Colin jerked on a pair of jeans. His stare shot to the clock.</p><p>\u201cWhoever that is had better have a damn good reason for being here at 6 A.M.\u201d</p><p>Six o\u2019clock. That meant they\u2019d gotten a grand total of three hours\u2019 worth of sleep.</p><p>Emily pulled the sheet over her breasts. She wasn\u2019t sure where her clothes were. Maybe still in the den? And where were her glasses?</p><p>Colin stomped out of the room. She heard the click of the lock, then, \u201cWhat the hell are you doing here, Brooks?\u201d</p><p>Emily frowned and inched to the edge of the bed.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Dr. Drake?\u201d</p><p>Her gaze scanned the room. The closet. She hurried across the floor, her toes tingling at the contact with the cold wood. She grabbed one of his shirts, pulling it quickly over her head. Luckily, the T-shirt fell to the middle of her thighs so she wouldn\u2019t be flashing Colin\u2019s partner.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s here, isn\u2019t she?\u201d Brooks\u2019s voice rose. \u201cDr. Drake, I need to talk to you. Now.\u201d</p><p>She blinked. He sounded pissed. What\u2019s wrong with him? Sure, she might have accidentally shoved him last night when she\u2019d been locked on the killer, but that was hardly any reason for him to be an\u2014</p><p>\u201cWatch your tone, Brooks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the one who needs to watch what he\u2019s doing, partner. You\u2019re screwing this woman and you don\u2019t even know\u2014\u201d</p><p>Emily shot down the hallway, found Colin glaring nose to nose at Brooks. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on here?\u201d</p><p>Brooks glanced toward her, eyes narrowed. \u201cYou tell me.\u201d</p><p>Emily shook her head. \u201cLook, it\u2019s too early for me to play some dumb-ass guessing game with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere were you last night between eight and ten P.M.?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d No, no way had that too-pretty, GQ wannabe just asked her for an alibi. \u201cWhy do you want to know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just spent the last three hours breaking apart Darla\u2019s hard drive.\u201d He cocked a brow. \u201cWanna know what I found?\u201d</p><p>Serenity Woods.</p><p>\u201cBack off, Brooks.\u201d Colin didn\u2019t raise his voice. The utter coldness of his tone cut through the room.</p><p>Comprehension widened Brooks\u2019s eyes. \u201cYou knew, didn\u2019t you? You knew and you didn\u2019t tell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCause there\u2019s nothing to tell. Darla had her facts wrong about Emily.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d Brooks stepped away from Colin. Paced to her side. His gaze swept over her body. Returned to her face. \u201cSo she\u2019s not crazy? She wasn\u2019t admitted to a juvie psychiatric ward when she was eleven because she was seeing monsters?\u201d</p><p>Emily lifted her chin. \u201cShe is right in front of you. And, no, I\u2019m not crazy. I\u2019m completely, perfectly sane.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUmm, you just see monsters. But other than that little oddity, you\u2019re completely normal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop being a dick, Brooks.\u201d Colin positioned his body in front of her. \u201cEmily, go get dressed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She\u2019d be damned if she\u2019d skulk away while the boy blunder called her a nutcase. \u201cI think I need to clear up a few points with your partner here.\u201d</p><p>Colin looked over his shoulder, his jaw clenched. \u201cFine.\u201d He turned back to Brooks. Jabbed his finger into his chest. \u201cBut if your eyes drop one more time, I\u2019m knocking you out. Partner or not.\u201d</p><p>Emily crossed her arms over her chest. Tapped her foot. \u201cI don\u2019t know what you found on her computer, but Darla\u2019s facts were wrong. I\u2019m not now nor have I ever been\u201d\u2014her back teeth ground together as she gritted\u2014\u201ccrazy.\u201d No, she just saw monsters.</p><p>But the monsters were real.</p><p>\u201cA story like that, it would have ruined your practice.\u201d</p><p>Doubtful. Emily snorted. It probably would have just given her more business. It would have been as close to advertising for Other patients as she could get. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t have effected me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBullshit.\u201d</p><p>Colin rolled his shoulders, narrowed his eyes. \u201cWatch it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDarla was going to ruin your career, tell the world about the little girl who\u2019d hallucinated, whose mom sent her to a psych ward because she didn\u2019t want a crazy kid.\u201d</p><p>Emily stepped forward, punched her finger in his chest. \u201cListen up, Brooks. I told you already, I\u2019m not crazy. Darla\u2019s story wouldn\u2019t have done a damn thing to my career because the story would never have run. She didn\u2019t have any facts to back up her wild ideas, okay?\u201d Oh, the man was starting to royally piss her off.</p><p>She didn\u2019t want a crazy kid.</p><p>That hit just a little too close to home.</p><p>And it made her even angrier. \u201cI don\u2019t have to listen to any more of this crap. I\u2019m working this case with you, Detective. I didn\u2019t kill Darla Mitchell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen tell me where you were between 8 and 10.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt. My. Mother\u2019s. 2801 Terrace Lane. Check it out. Go ask her. Interview her neighbors. I\u2019m sure someone saw me.\u201d</p><p>He pulled out a small notebook. Scribbled something down. The address, no doubt. Asshole.</p><p>\u201cNow if you\u2019re done interrogating me, I\u2019m going to shower.\u201d Before she gave into the impulse rushing through her and slugged him.</p><p>Being accused of ripping out a reporter\u2019s throat first thing in the morning had sure screwed up her mood.</p><p>Emily didn\u2019t wait for him to answer. She spun on her heel and stormed from the room.</p><p>The bathroom door slammed.</p><p>Colin stared at his partner, shook his head. \u201cWhat the hell were you thinking?\u201d</p><p>Very carefully, Brooks folded his notebook. Tucked it in his jacket pocket. \u201cI was thinking we have a murder to solve and that your girlfriend has a hell of a motive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwo murders,\u201d Colin corrected, trying hard to keep the anger out of his voice. \u201cTwo murders with the exact MO. What, you think Emily had a motive for offing Preston too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think she\u2019s linked to him. I haven\u2019t connected the pieces yet, but I will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? The doc had nothing to do\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHer place was trashed last night, wasn\u2019t it? Just like Gillian Nemont\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>Exactly like Gillian\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cWhat are the odds of that?\u201d Brooks asked quietly. \u201cWhat are the odds that both Dr. Drake\u2019s place and Gillian\u2019s would get trashed?\u201d</p><p>Colin didn\u2019t reply. Cause he\u2019d been wondering the same thing.</p><p>\u201cI think she\u2019s holding out on us. She knows something, or else\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr else what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s involved.\u201d</p><p>Shit. \u201cYou saw the bodies. There\u2019s no way Emily could have done that.\u201d No, she\u2019d been horrified when she\u2019d seen the victims and the blood.</p><p>\u201cThe facts aren\u2019t adding up. Not one damn bit.\u201d Brooks began pacing around the room. \u201cThe case smells to high heaven. And I know, I know I\u2019m being kept in the dark.\u201d He rounded on Colin. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t like it.\u201d</p><p>Colin glared right back at him. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t like it when my partner comes here at dawn and starts harassing my lover.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t trust her.\u201d</p><p>I do. \u201cNo one\u2019s asked you to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m checking out her alibi. You coming with me or not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight now, not.\u201d Hell, his eyes were still sandy from sleep. And Emily was pissed, and in the shower, naked.</p><p>But he had a fucking job to do, and on this case he couldn\u2019t afford to have anyone questioning his motives. Or his lover\u2019s. \u201cGive me an hour. I\u2019ll meet you at the station.\u201d He\u2019d have to clear Emily so that Brooks would drop this lame-ass theory.</p><p>Brooks jerked his head in agreement, turned toward the door.</p><p>Colin caught his arm in a steely grip. He figured Emily should be proud of him; he\u2019d held onto his cool a good fifteen minutes. \u201cNot so fast, partner.\u201d He applied just enough pressure to grind bones.</p><p>\u201cWhat the he\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t ever fucking come to my house and rip into my woman that way again, you understand me?\u201d He didn\u2019t let up on the pressure, not for one minute.</p><p>Brooks tried to jerk away. Colin just tightened his grip. \u201cI asked if you understood.\u201d He\u2019d hate to break the guy\u2019s arm, but he had a point to make.</p><p>Don\u2019t mess with Emily.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m doing my job. Our job.\u201d Moisture appeared above Brooks\u2019s upper lip. \u201cI have to check her out.\u201d</p><p>Yeah, but it was more than that. He\u2019d seen Brooks check out hundreds of suspects before, and he\u2019d never had the tight rage in his voice that he\u2019d had when he confronted Emily. Understanding dawned. \u201cYou don\u2019t like her, do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t trust her.\u201d</p><p>Colin eased his grip. He\u2019d deliberately reached for his partner\u2019s left arm. No sense putting his shooting hand out of commission.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to trust her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t either. There\u2019s something about her...it\u2019s just...off.\u201d When Colin\u2019s hold lightened, Brooks managed to jerk his arm free. \u201cDon\u2019t let the fact that she\u2019s a good piece of ass screw up your head, Gyth. She\u2019s got secrets, and those secrets could be deadly.\u201d</p><p>He wrenched open the door, stalked into the bright morning light.</p><p>Colin watched him leave, watched as he revved his small sports car and spun out of the drive.</p><p>Brooks was getting drawn deeper and deeper into the Butcher case, and the guy was a good detective.</p><p>There was a chance he could find out the truth.</p><p>How would he handle it?</p><p>The guy seemed certain that Emily was a threat. How would he feel if he learned the true danger came from his own partner?</p><p>You fucking freak! I\u2019ll kill you! I\u2019ll kill you!</p><p>He rolled his right shoulder. Been there, done that. He hoped there wouldn\u2019t be a repeat performance this time around.</p><p>He shut the front door, heard the faint spray of water from the shower.</p><p>His head tilted at the sound, and an image of Emily, her pale body glistening with water, filled his mind.</p><p>Hmmm. He\u2019d told Brooks he\u2019d meet him in an hour.</p><p>More than enough time...</p><p>The warm water slid over her skin. Ah, God, it felt good. Emily tilted her head beneath the spray, letting the water soak her hair.</p><p>Steam rose around her, light, foggy tendrils that drifted in the air. She turned back around\u2014</p><p>And saw the outline of a man\u2019s body through the distorted glass of the shower door.</p><p>Her heart beat faster, faster\u2014</p><p>Colin pulled open the door. He was naked. And aroused.</p><p>Emily swallowed. Forced her gaze to lift. \u201cI-is your partner gone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUmm.\u201d His own gaze swept down her body, lingering on her breasts, the dark hair at the juncture of her thighs.</p><p>He stepped into the shower, closed the door with a soft click behind him.</p><p>\u201cH-he\u2019s wrong, you know. I didn\u2019t have anything to do with Darla\u2019s murder.\u201d</p><p>He pressed his fingertip against her lips. \u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>The water poured over them in a warm, steady stream.</p><p>Emily opened her mouth. Her tongue snaked out, licked the tip of his finger.</p><p>His pupils flared in hungry response.</p><p>She drew his finger into her mouth, swirling her tongue around him and sucking softly. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t tease me,\u201d he growled.</p><p>She released his finger. Heady power filled her. It was the kind of sensual power she\u2019d never felt\u2014until Colin. He made her feel beautiful, sexual.</p><p>Wanted.</p> <p>She wasn\u2019t a freak with him. She didn\u2019t have to choose her words for fear he\u2019d discover her secret. She didn\u2019t have to pretend with him. She could just...be.</p><p>Her fingers trailed over his chest. Found his nipples. Rubbed. \u201cWho said I was teasing?\u201d His cock pressed against her belly, fully aroused, easily thicker than her wrist.</p><p>She bent her head, let the water rush down her back, and took his nipple into her mouth.</p><p>His fingers tangled in her hair, held her closer. She heard him suck in a sharp breath.</p><p>Keeping her mouth on him, her fingers slipped down to his groin. Found the hard length of his arousal. Wrapped around him, squeezed.</p> <p>Oh God, but she couldn\u2019t wait to feel that cock in her, driving deep, filling every inch of her sex.</p><p>Colin pulled lightly on her hair, forcing her head to lift. His mouth locked onto hers, his tongue sweeping inside, claiming her.</p><p>He spun around, pinned her against the smooth tile. His fingers dipped into the dark curls at her sex. Parted her folds and plunged inside.</p><p>Oh yes! Her hips ground against his hand. Her mouth jerked away from his and she hoarsely demanded, \u201cColin, more!\u201d He knew just how to touch her. Knew where to press, where to stroke, where to\u2014</p><p>He pushed three fingers inside of her. Emily squeezed her eyes shut. Her sex trembled around him.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so damn sexy,\u201d he growled, licking his way down her neck. \u201cEvery time I see you, I want to take you.\u201d</p> <p>Her hips twisted against him, jerked. He was holding his fingers still now. The pressure was maddening. She needed him to move, to\u2014</p><p>He pulled his hand away and Emily moaned in protest.</p><p>Colin laughed, but the sound was strained. \u201cIt\u2019s all right, baby, I\u2019ll give you what you need.\u201d</p><p>His hands locked on her waist. Lifted her. \u201cWrap your legs around me.\u201d</p><p>Damn, but she\u2019d forgotten just how strong he was. Shifter strength.</p><p>Her legs curled around his hips. The head of his cock nudged her entrance.</p><p>Then he drove deep inside, lodging his cock balls deep in her sheath.</p><p>Her sex clamped down on him, and she squeezed him, loving the feel of his flesh inside her.</p> <p>He was moving then. Pulling back. Thrusting deep. Again and again.</p><p>Her hands rose to his shoulders, gripped the slick flesh.</p><p>His mouth captured her breast and his tongue swirled over her nipple.</p><p>His hips slammed into her. Withdrew, plunged.</p><p>And his mouth, oh, his mouth\u2014</p><p>His fingers edged between their bodies. He found her clit, pressed with his thumb.</p><p>She came, her sex contracting as a powerful orgasm shot through her.</p><p>Colin lifted his head, watched her. \u201cDamn, I love it when you come.\u201d Another thrust. \u201cYou. Feel. So. Fucking. Good.\u201d And then he was shuddering against her, his own climax claiming him.</p><p>When the waves of pleasure finally stopped, Emily didn\u2019t move. Her back felt bruised, sore from contact with the tile, but she didn\u2019t really care.</p><p>Her fingers stroked the back of Colin\u2019s neck.</p><p>He kissed her shoulder and held her.</p><p>Terrace Lane was one of those quiet, unassuming little streets that looked like it belonged on a greeting card. Perfectly groomed lawns. Large, brick houses. Neat little sidewalks. Cute kids playing in the yards.</p><p>The neighborhood made him tense. He didn\u2019t belong there. Wasn\u2019t part of that picture-perfect world.</p><p>And neither was the doc.</p><p>How had she felt, he wondered, growing up there? She\u2019d been seeing demons and vampires, and the other kids had been playing basketball and hopscotch.</p><p>She\u2019d never fit in. And neither had he.</p><p>\u201cAll right. Donna Tillman, the neighbor on the right\u201d\u2014Brooks lifted his notebook and pointed to a house with a large bay window\u2014\u201csaid she saw Dr. Drake arrive a little after seven-thirty last night.\u201d</p><p>Colin grunted. It was the same story he\u2019d gotten from Tom Henry, the neighbor on the left. \u201cShe sure about the time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, said she was taking out her garbage when she saw her.\u201d Brooks turned his attention to 2801 Terrace Lane. \u201cMrs. Tillman thought it was real odd, too, because apparently, Dr. Drake never comes to visit, and when she did get here, she stayed in the car for about fifteen minutes before she went inside.\u201d</p><p>He was sure that the helpful Mrs. Tillman had been peering through her window that entire time, so she probably had an exact count on those minutes. \u201cThey\u2019ve confirmed her alibi.\u201d</p><p>Brooks lifted a brow. \u201cNeither of them remember when she left.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen let\u2019s go ask the mother.\u201d And Colin had to admit that he was curious about Emily\u2019s mom. The schoolteacher. The woman who\u2019d sent her daughter to Serenity Woods.</p><p>They rang her doorbell, and the soft peal echoed back to them. A moment later, the door was opened and a small, delicate woman with short black hair and wide green eyes peered up at them. \u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>Colin pulled out his badge. \u201cAtlanta PD. I\u2019m Detective Colin Gyth, and this is my partner, Todd Brooks.\u201d</p><p>Her fingers curled around the side of the door. Turned white. \u201cWh-what do you want?\u201d</p><p>Brooks flashed her a smile. \u201cWe just have a few questions to ask you, ma\u2019am.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes darted between them. \u201cAbout what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout your daughter, Emily Drake.\u201d</p><p>Colin saw her flinch.</p><p>Not the reaction he\u2019d been expecting.</p><p>Brooks stepped forward, charming smile still in place. \u201cWhy don\u2019t we go inside and discuss this?\u201d</p><p>As often happens, Mrs. Drake stumbled back, opening the door as she moved. \u201cBut I don\u2019t know what you want to discuss!\u201d</p><p>Brooks walked into her foyer. \u201cWe told you. Emily.\u201d</p><p>Colin followed them inside, his glance sweeping over the spotlessly clean house. Emily\u2019s mother led them into a large den. There were no photos on the mantel, he noted. No photos anywhere.</p><p>\u201cWh-what do you want to know about Emily?\u201d She\u2019d crossed her arms over her chest and she lifted her chin, a gesture so like Emily\u2019s that Colin almost smiled.</p><p>\u201cWas she here last night, Mrs. Drake\u2014or actually, can we call you Karen?\u201d Another of Brooks\u2019s tricks\u2014make the witnesses feel comfortable, get \u2019em on a first-name basis and get \u2019em talking.</p><p>\u201cWhat? Oh, yes, Karen\u2019s fine.\u201d She frowned. \u201cAnd, ah, yes, Emily was here last night.\u201d Her eyes widened in sudden worry.</p><p>\u201cNothing\u2019s happened, has it? Emily\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s fine,\u201d Colin told her instantly. \u201cWe\u2019re just following up, asking some questions on a case we\u2019re working.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>Did she sound disappointed? His stare sharpened. \u201cHow long was Emily here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAn hour, maybe two.\u201d Karen shrugged. \u201cI don\u2019t know, I wasn\u2019t looking at a clock.\u201d</p><p>The grandfather clock behind them chimed.</p><p>Brooks and Colin stared at each other a moment. \u201cIt would really help us if you could be more specific, Karen,\u201d Brooks murmured.</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d She huffed out a breath. \u201cEmeline arrived a little after seven and she stayed until around ten-thirty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd why did Emily come visit you?\u201d Colin asked blandly. Was it because you sold her out to a reporter and Emily told you to stop talking to the press?</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s my daughter. She doesn\u2019t need to have a reason to visit.\u201d Her words were a little too high.</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d Actually, he didn\u2019t. \u201cSo you and Em had a nice little mother\u2013daughter visit last night?\u201d</p><p>Her head tilted to the right. Her lips parted on a breath of surprise as she studied him. \u201cYou know my daughter?\u201d</p><p>Ah, shit. Not the way he\u2019d wanted the introductions to go. \u201cUmm, yeah. She\u2019s actually working on a case with us. As a profiler.\u201d</p><p>All of the emotion vanished from her face. \u201cReally.\u201d The temperature in the room seemed to drop about ten degrees.</p><p>What in the hell?</p><p>\u201cWhy are you asking me these questions?\u201d Her stare returned to Brooks. \u201cIt\u2019s almost as if you\u2019re trying to get an alibi for my daughter.\u201d</p><p>Well, yeah, that was exactly what they were trying to do.</p><p>Brooks kept his smile in place. \u201cKaren, what can you tell me about Serenity Woods?\u201d</p><p>She took a step back. \u201cS-serenity Woods?\u201d</p><p>He nodded.</p><p>And that chin shot into the air again. \u201cI think I\u2019ve answered enough questions. You should leave now.\u201d</p><p>His friendly smile faded. \u201cThere are records we can check, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said very definitely, \u201cthere aren\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>She walked back to the foyer. Opened the front door. \u201cGood-bye, Detectives.\u201d</p><p>Hmmm. She\u2019d talked to them longer than he\u2019d thought. Colin caught his partner\u2019s eye, shrugged. He\u2019d known Karen Drake would back up her daughter\u2019s alibi, but he\u2019d gone along with the investigation anyway. If he hadn\u2019t followed up on Emily\u2019s story, Brooks would have become even more suspicious and he might have started spreading some of his bullshit suspicions around the station.</p><p>And that was something Colin couldn\u2019t let happen.</p><p>Brooks left first, nodding politely to Karen Drake as he passed. Colin inclined his head as he walked by her.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re involved with my daughter, aren\u2019t you?\u201d Her voice was hushed. Her gaze hooded.</p><p>\u201cWe work together, I told you that.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cYou called her Em. And I could tell by your voice\u2014\u201d</p><p>Shit. He\u2019d have to be a hell of a lot more careful in the future. But, wait, dammit, maybe she hadn\u2019t picked up on anything in his speech, maybe she sensed the truth. Maybe she was just like her daughter.</p><p>Colin was instantly on full alert. He\u2019d underestimated Karen Drake. He needed to be on guard with her.</p><p>Brooks had walked down the sidewalk. He glanced back, frowning.</p><p>\u201cBe careful, Detective,\u201d she said, her voice a harsh whisper. \u201cYou may think you know my daughter, but believe me, you don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>He clenched his back teeth to hold back the not-so-polite response that sprang to his lips.</p><p>Karen shook her head sadly. \u201cEmily is very...different.\u201d</p><p>Different was too tame a word for the doc. \u201cI\u2019ll keep that in mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t understand.\u201d She leaned forward, staring straight into his eyes. \u201cEmily is\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs there a problem?\u201d Brooks called, moving back toward them.</p><p>Emily\u2019s mother straightened with a quick snap. Her lips firmed into a thin line.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Colin told him, \u201cI\u2019ll be right there.\u201d He was suddenly very eager to get away from the picturesque house on Terrace Lane.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s evil.\u201d Karen breathed the words, and Colin saw a tear track from the corner of her eye. \u201cRemember that, and don\u2019t trust her. \u201d</p><p>Then she turned and fled back into the house, slamming the door behind her.</p><p>Chapter 13</p><p>\u201cWe have a problem.\u201d Smith was waiting for them when they returned to the station. She\u2019d made herself comfortable at Brooks\u2019s desk, and when they approached her, she swiveled around to face them, tapping a manila file against her desk.</p><p>\u201cYeah, and how is that new?\u201d Brooks reached for the file. \u201cThis the report on those hairs you found on Myers?\u201d</p><p>Colin glanced across the pen, saw McNeal making a beeline for them. \u201cHas the captain read the file?\u201d</p><p>Her lips turned down. \u201cNot yet. I\u2019ll see him\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow,\u201d McNeal finished, appearing at her side. \u201cI told you, I wanted all data on this case given to me first.\u201d His shoulders were stiff as he loomed over her.</p><p>Smith didn\u2019t look particularly intimidated. She shrugged. \u201cProcedure is for me to report to the lead detectives.\u201d</p><p>McNeal wrapped his hands around the arms of the chair. Leaned in close. \u201cI gave you an order, Smith. It\u2019s not personal, but it sure as hell will be if you don\u2019t start doing exactly what I say on this case.\u201d He stared into her eyes a heartbeat of time, then softly said,</p><p>\u201cAre we clear now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh yeah, Captain, we\u2019re clear.\u201d The Arctic had to be warmer than she was right then.</p><p>McNeal sighed and stepped back. \u201cAll of you, in my office, now.\u201d</p><p>Brooks and Smith looked surprised by the order as they moved to obey, but Colin knew what McNeal was thinking. If there was anything abnormal\u2014as in Other abnormal\u2014he didn\u2019t want the rest of the station hearing about it then.</p><p>A few moments later, McNeal closed the door behind them with a soft click. \u201cI\u2019ll take the file.\u201d</p><p>Brooks tossed it to him. McNeal flipped it open, read quickly, a furrow appearing between his eyes. \u201cUnrecognizable? Not human? What the hell? Did the evidence get contaminated?\u201d</p><p>Smith stiffened. Her entire body seemed to turn to stone before Colin\u2019s eyes. \u201cMy evidence is good.\u201d</p><p>Yeah, and he and McNeal both knew it.</p><p>McNeal scanned the file again. \u201cCanis lupus\u2014what is that, some kind of dog?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Smith told him, biting out the word. \u201cIt\u2019s a wolf, a gray wolf.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re saying a gray wolf attacked Myers?\u201d Brooks asked, peering over McNeal\u2019s shoulder to get a better look at the file.</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m not saying that.\u201d She began to pace in front of them. \u201cThe analysis couldn\u2019t match up the hair that I found on Myers, not completely.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Not completely. Colin knew what was coming, but he knew he had to play it clueless. \u201cLook, either the hair is a wolf\u2019s or it isn\u2019t, what are you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt matches with part of a gray wolf\u2019s DNA, but\u2014\u201d She licked her lips, glanced at each of them quickly. \u201cIt also has unknown DNA.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, unknown?\u201d Brooks shook his head. \u201cUnknown as in\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot human. Not animal. But some sort of really strange combination of both.\u201d</p><p>Shifter. Colin coughed delicately, caught McNeal\u2019s eye. \u201cUmm, Smith, are you telling us that a werewolf attacked Myers?\u201d Cause, yeah, that was pretty much what had happened.</p><p>She stopped pacing, stood in front of McNeal\u2019s desk, lifted her hands, and said, \u201cHonestly, Gyth, I don\u2019t know what the hell I\u2019m telling you. I\u2019ve never seen anything like this before, and I just\u2014I don\u2019t have an answer for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe the hair was planted,\u201d Brooks suggested, pursing his lips, \u201cto throw us off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere were claw marks on the body. I called in an animal specialist. The marks match up with a wolf\u2019s.\u201d</p> <p>McNeal snapped the file closed. Tossed it onto his desk. \u201cI\u2019m not going to the DA and telling him that a werewolf killed Myers.\u201d</p><p>Smith opened her mouth, then shook her head.</p><p>Uh-oh. \u201cWhat is it, Smith?\u201d She was holding back. He\u2019d seen that expression on her face before.</p><p>\u201cNot just Myers,\u201d she muttered. \u201cThe reporter too. I found more of the hairs on her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat in the hell is going on here?\u201d Brooks demanded. \u201cThere is no way some rabid wolfman is going around the city killing people!\u201d</p><p>Actually, that was exactly what was happening. And now they had proof. Definitive proof.</p> <p>Unfortunately, it was proof that would never make it into a courtroom.</p><p>\u201cThe evidence has to be compromised,\u201d McNeal said flatly. \u201cEither it was tampered with at the crime scene or it was exposed here\u2014but it\u2019s no good to us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, my evidence is\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cCompromised. Now, we need to put a lid on this thing before word leaks to the press that our evidence in this case has been tainted.\u201d</p><p>Smith sucked in a sharp breath.</p><p>McNeal stabbed a finger in the air. \u201cNow I want you three to get to work and find me evidence that I can use.\u201d He glared at them, then snarled, \u201cNow! Go! \u201d</p><p>Smith threw him a look of disdain before she turned on her heel and marched out. Brooks followed her, and Colin trailed on their heels.</p><p>\u201cGyth, wait.\u201d</p> <p>Colin stopped at the door. His hand reached out, pushed the thin, wooden door shut. He glanced back. McNeal was feeding the file into his shredder. He arched a brow at the captain. \u201cThere are gonna be other copies of that, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take care of them.\u201d He exhaled heavily and sank into his chair. \u201cI need you to find this bastard, Detective. I can\u2019t have him terrifying my city and leaving a trail of dead humans in his wake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir.\u201d But it was a hell of a lot easier said than done.</p><p>\u201cFind him, Gyth,\u201d McNeal repeated, \u201cand do whatever you have to do, but stop the bastard. \u201d</p><p>Just after five that evening, Emily arrived at the station, her palms damp with sweat and her heart racing.</p><p>Gyth had called her twenty minutes ago. They had a suspect in custody for the break-in at her place. A kid who\u2019d been busted for shoplifting and who just happened to have her address scribbled down in his wallet.</p><p>Talk about your lucky breaks.</p><p>Her gaze scanned the station. She didn\u2019t see Colin. Where was\u2014</p><p>\u201cAfternoon, Dr. Drake.\u201d</p><p>Brooks. Emily turned around, didn\u2019t bother forcing a smile. \u201cBrooks.\u201d Her heart raced even faster. \u201cTell me, did you have a nice morning investigating me?\u201d</p><p>He met her stare levelly. \u201cI\u2019m working on a murder.\u201d</p><p>Like she didn\u2019t know that.</p><p>\u201cI have to follow every lead. Check out all suspects.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd is that what I am now? A suspect?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot anymore. Colin and I talked to your mother, her neighbors, they all backed up\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cC-Colin talked to my mother?\u201d She\u2019d known, of course, that he\u2019d have to go with Brooks to follow up on her alibi. She understood that he was doing his job. Hell, if their positions were reversed, she\u2019d have done the same thing. And she even understood why Brooks had originally suspected her. She hated the guy\u2019s attitude, but she wasn\u2019t stupid. She understood.</p><p>But the sudden image of Colin talking to her mother. Oh no. That couldn\u2019t have gone well.</p><p>A faint smile curved his lips. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. They just talked about the case.\u201d</p><p>Too late. She was already worried. \u201cWhere is Colin? He called me about a suspect in the break-in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s getting the lineup ready. Come on.\u201d He took her arm, led her to the elevator. \u201cHe should be ready for you by now.\u201d</p><p>Within minutes, Emily found herself behind a large, tinted pane of glass. Colin stood behind her, Brooks at his side. A woman was there too, the DA, and another man\u2014he\u2019d identified himself as James Tyler, another lawyer, presumably for the guy she was hoping to identify.</p><p>There was a faint click behind her, then Colin ordered, \u201cBring \u2019em in.\u201d</p><p>A door opened on the other side of the glass. A line of men walked out, all holding white signs with black numbers on them.</p><p>\u201cFace forward,\u201d Colin said into the intercom.</p><p>The men stared back at her. Emily swallowed. Lifted her hand to touch the cheek that still ached. She\u2019d managed to cover the bruise with some makeup she\u2019d bought at the drugstore that morning.</p><p>Her eyes scanned over the men. Not number one. Or two. Number three had the right hair, but\u2014</p><p>\u201cNumber four.\u201d She met his stare through the mirror. Same wide eyes. A face that was pale, hair too long.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d Brooks asked softly. \u201cTake your time, you don\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s number four.\u201d She was absolutely certain.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d Colin drawled as he fixed the public defender with a hard look. \u201cGuess that means in addition to the shoplifting charges, your client is about to be booked with assault, breaking and entering, and vandalism. And just so we\u2019re clear, he\u2019s eighteen. No juvie charges.\u201d</p><p>James shook his head, his expression disgusted, as he reached for the door. \u201cAnd here I was thinking I\u2019d be home before seven.\u201d</p><p>With a polite \u201cThank you for your cooperation,\u201d the DA followed him out.</p><p>Emily rounded on Colin. \u201cI want to talk to him.\u201d I want to find out why the kid thinks I\u2019m a demon.</p><p>Brooks whistled softly. \u201cFigured you\u2019d ask for something like that. I\u2019d be pissed as hell if the punk had broken into my place.\u201d</p><p>Colin shook his head. \u201cNot gonna happen, Doc. That\u2019s not the way it works\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t make me go over your head.\u201d Lover or not, he wasn\u2019t going to keep her away from that boy. And if she had to go to McNeal, she would.</p><p>His blue eyes hardened. \u201cYou\u2019re a witness here. Nothing more.\u201d</p><p>Ouch. Emily lifted her chin. \u201cI\u2019m a victim here, and victims have rights.\u201d Screw it. Colin was in his overprotective mode and she didn\u2019t feel like wasting her time arguing with him. She\u2019d talk to McNeal; she needed to update him and Colin on her profile anyway.</p><p>Emily marched to the door, yanked it open. She took three steps and came face-to-face with the boy who\u2019d attacked her. His hands were cuffed and a uniformed officer stood on his right.</p><p>Her eyes widened in surprise. Perfect opportunity. She would\u2014</p><p>\u201cDemon! She\u2019s a fucking demon! \u201d The kid started screaming at the top of his lungs, shaking.</p><p>He sounded so absolutely certain that he was seeing a demon that Emily actually turned and glanced behind her just to make sure one hadn\u2019t arrived. But no. It was just her.</p><p>\u201cLook, kid, I\u2019m not\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cKill the demon! Have to kill her!\u201d He lunged forward in a blur of motion, his arms raised.</p><p>Emily heard a guttural shout from behind her. And then the boy barreled into her, sending her flying to the ground. He landed on top of her, and his fingers locked around her throat. Hell, not again.</p><p>\u201cHave to destroy the demon. She\u2019s evil. Destroy\u2014\u201d</p><p>Colin grabbed the kid and jerked him off her, shoving him back up against the wall. \u201cYou just made a serious fucking mistake.\u201d</p><p>The kid raised his arms, tried to use his cuffs to hit Colin. Colin growled and hit him in the stomach, driving the air from the boy\u2019s lungs in a loud whoosh. Then he pulled back his fist and drove it into the boy\u2019s nose. Bones cracked. Blood shot down the perp\u2019s face.</p><p>Colin raised his fist back, bared his teeth.</p><p>The boy began to whimper. His body slid down to the floor and he wrapped his arms around his stomach, rocking back and forth.</p><p>Colin grabbed him by the collar and\u2014</p><p>\u201cStop!\u201d Emily ordered, pushing to her knees. Something about that kid\u2014something was very, very wrong. \u201cHe\u2019s not going to attack again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn right he\u2019s not.\u201d Colin turned his furious stare onto the uniform. \u201cWhat the fuck were you doing? Don\u2019t you know how to secure a perp?\u201d</p><p>The cop gulped, muttering apologies as he reached for the boy.</p><p>\u201cGet him out of here, now! \u201d</p><p>Emily stared down at the boy. \u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head, whispered, \u201cDemon.\u201d</p><p>The uniform pulled him to his feet. \u201cCome on, Trace. Fun\u2019s over.\u201d</p><p>The boy went forward obediently, but he kept looking back at Emily, a frightened, lost look on his face.</p><p>\u201cWell...\u201d Brooks murmured, eyeing Emily with a hint of wariness. \u201cGuess you aren\u2019t the only one preoccupied with demons, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe killer wants the world to know what he is.\u201d Emily sat in the chair across from McNeal\u2019s desk. Colin sat beside her, and she could feel his intent stare on her.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t spoken with her since the attack. But if looks could kill...</p><p>Damn. She\u2019d been the one to get choked. She would have thought the guy could have shown more sympathy.</p><p>Colin wasn\u2019t feeling particularly sympathetic. She knew that. Could feel that. His rage practically filled the room.</p><p>She\u2019d taken a few minutes to regain her composure after the attack. She\u2019d retreated to the restroom. Discovered that she had red fingerprints on her neck. Her voice was scratchy, and the new suit jacket she\u2019d purchased that morning had been ripped.</p><p>Actually, she\u2019d had to buy a whole new wardrobe that morning. Thanks to the boy, Trace, all of her old clothes had been slashed.</p><p>And so far, things weren\u2019t looking up for her new items.</p><p>\u201cAre you saying the Night Bastard wants to get caught?\u201d McNeal asked, leaning forward.</p><p>His question jerked Emily back to the matter at hand. The Night Butcher, or, as McNeal liked to call him, the Night Bastard.</p><p>She\u2019d been working on his profile, updating it with information she\u2019d garnered at the crime scene last night. \u201cNo, I didn\u2019t say he wants to get caught. I said he wants people to find out what he is. He wants the humans to know about him, and to fear him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe wants them to know he\u2019s a shifter,\u201d Colin muttered. \u201cAnd that\u2019s why he\u2019s killing in his animal form?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cI think so. I also think he\u2019s choosing human victims who are high profile to get more attention. Preston Myers was rich, high society. His murder was bound to go straight to the front page. Darla\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas a hotshot reporter,\u201d Colin finished. \u201cCourse her killing would make every broadcast and paper in the state.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis guy\u2014he\u2019s tired of hiding what he is. He wants the world to know about him. About all the Other. And I think he\u2019ll kill as many humans as it takes to get his message out there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit.\u201d McNeal\u2019s gaze darted to his shredder. \u201cHe\u2019s deliberately leaving evidence for us, isn\u2019t he? Evidence that proves he\u2019s not human.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I think he is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d McNeal\u2019s fist hit the desk. \u201cComing out like this will just make humans terrified. They\u2019ll fear him, hate him, hate all of us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t care,\u201d she told him softly. \u201cThis guy\u2014he thinks he\u2019s all powerful. He\u2019s gotten a taste for the killing.\u201d Her blood tasted good. \u201cThere\u2019s something else you should both know.\u201d She took a deep breath. \u201cI think the next victim\u2014it\u2019s going to be a cop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck.\u201d From Gyth.</p><p>\u201cHow the hell do you know that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause he told me.\u201d Maybe I\u2019ll do one of them next. Oh yeah, that\u2019d be good. \u201cHe was at the television station last night. I-I felt him. Managed to get close enough to touch his thoughts.\u201d But the killer had gotten away.</p><p>So close.</p><p>\u201cA cop.\u201d McNeal squeezed his eyes shut. \u201cChrist. Yeah, that would definitely get the asshole more attention. He\u2019d make the national news then. A fucking werewolf killing cops. Shit.\u201d</p><p>Would cops taste different? Would they try to fight more? \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a woman,\u201d Emily said, wanting to give them all the information she had. \u201cHe...ah...likes the way women taste better.\u201d</p><p>Colin tensed.</p><p>\u201cShit!\u201d McNeal lunged to his feet. \u201cI want this bastard off the streets. I don\u2019t want to play any more of his fucking games.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>But there wasn\u2019t much of a choice.</p><p>McNeal frowned at Colin. \u201cPut everyone on alert.

Brooks popped his head inside, not waiting for an invitation. \u201cI\u2019ve got some news you\u2019ve all got to hear.\u201d He stepped forward, gripping a white piece of paper in his hands. \u201cGuess whose prints just matched up with the unknowns we found at Gillian Nemont\u2019s?\u201d</p><p>Emily\u2019s stomach knotted. Gillian was a demon. Have to destroy the demon. She\u2019s evil.</p><p>\u201cSonofabitch.\u201d Colin shook his head slowly. \u201cThe kid.\u201d</p> <p>Brooks handed him the printout. \u201cBryan Trace. Runaway. High school dropout. Demon hunter.\u201d His lips twisted at the last. \u201cThat\u2019s what he told me he was, by the way. When the doctor was patching up his nose, he told me he was used to pain. Demon hunters have to be, of course.\u201d</p><p>Emily rubbed her temple. \u201cI don\u2019t understand what\u2019s going on! Why would this guy target me? It makes no sense!\u201d Unless...Emily straightened her shoulders. Unless the guy knew that some of her patients were Other and he\u2019d thought that she was too.</p><p>\u201cIt gets better,\u201d Brooks murmured. \u201cI\u2019ve got a security tape of the guy going into the News Flash Five station yesterday afternoon.\u201d</p><p>The kid was connected to all the murders. But...\u201cHe\u2019s not the Butcher,\u201d Emily said very definitely. Yes, the evidence was starting to mount, but it wasn\u2019t Trace.</p><p>The boy was human. She hadn\u2019t sensed anything supernatural about him.</p><p>Just an angry, confused, dangerous human.</p> <p>Brooks shook his head. \u201cIt could be him,\u201d he argued. \u201cHe trashed Nemont\u2019s place. That links him to Myers. If we canvas the neighborhood, we might even find someone who remembers seeing him at Preston\u2019s place before the murder.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou might,\u201d Emily said, \u201cbut I\u2019m telling you, this kid isn\u2019t the Night Butcher. \u201d</p><p>\u201cUmm...\u201d McNeal shot her a searching glance. \u201cDoc, you sure about this?\u201d</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>\u201cIf the kid didn\u2019t do it,\u201d Colin said, glancing up from the printout, \u201cI think he knows who did.\u201d</p><p>Now that she couldn\u2019t argue with.</p><p>\u201cThere are too many coincidences here,\u201d he continued. \u201cAnd they make me damn suspicious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe too.\u201d McNeal studied them in silence for a moment, then said, \u201cGet him into Interrogation. Find out what the hell he knows.\u201d</p> <p>Colin and Brooks strode toward the door.</p><p>\u201cAh, Captain?\u201d She wasn\u2019t about to let this chance pass. \u201cI think I can help here.\u201d</p><p>Colin swung around, eyes narrowed.</p><p>McNeal arched a brow. \u201cYou want in with him, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>McNeal rubbed a hand over his bare scalp. \u201cIt\u2019s risky, sending you in. His lawyer will have a field day with it since you\u2019re one of his victims.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe shouldn\u2019t go in,\u201d Colin snapped. \u201cThe guy just attacked her. Emily doesn\u2019t need to be anywhere near him!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t get too close,\u201d she promised, not looking at Colin. Dammit, this was her case too. If he\u2019d been attacked, she knew Colin would have gone right back in with the perp. \u201cLook, McNeal, the guy needs help. His mind\u2014\u201d Was twisted, confused. She bit her lip, muttered, \u201cI don\u2019t think they\u2019re going to be able to get to him. But I can.\u201d She knew it. If she could just get the chance.</p><p>\u201cObserve first. And then\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cCaptain, no!\u201d</p><p>McNeal glared at Colin. \u201cMy rules here, Gyth. Not yours. We may need the doctor on this one. She\u2019ll observe the interrogation with me, and if I think we need her, I\u2019ll send her in.\u201d</p><p>Emily finally glanced toward Colin. Found him watching her with a burning stare.</p><p>\u201cDo we have a problem, Gyth?\u201d McNeal asked.</p><p>\u201cNo, not yet.\u201d A muscle flexed along his jaw. \u201cBut if that bastard tries to touch her again, you might have a dead man on your hands.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBryan Trace...\u201d Brooks drawled out his name and flashed a friendly smile. \u201cDid the doctor get you all patched up?\u201d</p><p>The boy nodded jerkily.</p><p>His lawyer leaned forward, cast a menacing glance toward Colin. \u201cWe will be filing assault charges.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUmm, you try doing that.\u201d Colin didn\u2019t seem particularly concerned as he reached for a stack of photos. \u201cI\u2019ve got a station full of officers who saw the guy attack Dr. Drake. I was doing my job and subduing him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour \u2018subduing\u2019 technique broke his nose and bruised his ribs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUmm.\u201d Again, little concern. Colin stared down at the photos. \u201cHe was out of control. I did what I had to do.\u201d</p><p>Yes, and Emily knew he\u2019d do it again, in a heartbeat. Her hands curled in front of her as she stared through the two-way mirror.</p><p>\u201cBut if you wanna try to press charges...\u201d He shrugged. \u201cIt\u2019ll be your wasted hours.\u201d</p><p>Emily looked back at McNeal. \u201cCould the assault charges stick?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah. Too many cops for witnesses.\u201d</p><p>Brooks straddled the chair closest to the boy. \u201cBryan, I need to ask you a few questions.\u201d Light, easy tone.</p><p>\u201cO-okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWere you acquainted with a Preston Myers?\u201d</p><p>Bryan flinched.</p><p>\u201cUmm, Bryan, did you hear my question?\u201d</p><p>The boy stared down at his cuffed hands. \u201cDidn\u2019t know him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019d been to his house before, right, Bryan?\u201d Colin asked, his voice snapping like a whip. \u201cThe neighbors saw you, said that you\u2019d been hanging around, hiding in bushes like some kind of Peeping Tom.\u201d</p><p>Another flinch.</p><p>Emily knew Colin was making up the story about the neighbors\u2019 testimony, but judging by Bryan\u2019s response, he was definitely on the right track.</p><p>\u201cMy client doesn\u2019t have to\u2014\u201d</p><p>Bryan lifted his head. His cheeks were flushed. A wide, white bandage covered his nose. \u201cI was there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Brooks asked softly.</p><p>\u201cHe was a demon. I watch the demons, make sure they don\u2019t hurt anyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh...my client is obviously suffering from delusions. His mental capacity isn\u2019t strong enough for these questions\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up!\u201d Bryan screamed, lunging to his feet. \u201cI\u2019m not crazy! I\u2019m not crazy!\u201d</p><p>Colin locked one hand on his shoulder, shoved him back down.</p><p>James pulled his chair back a few feet. \u201cUh, I think we should stop\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut the fuck up! You don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on here. It\u2019s a war, man. A war.\u201d Bryan curled his lip at the attorney, spat, \u201cI don\u2019t need you. I\u2019ll say what I want. These guys can\u2019t do anything to me. I\u2019m a Hunter.\u201d He jerked his thumb toward his chest.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m the law. \u201d</p><p>McNeal stepped beside her, whistling softly. \u201cThe kid really was stalking Myers.\u201d</p><p>And Gillian Nemont. And her.</p><p>\u201cI take it you\u2019re waiving your right to your attorney\u2019s advice?\u201d Brooks murmured, glancing down at his nails.</p><p>\u201cHell, yes!\u201d Bryan suddenly seemed energized, eyes glowing, head tilted proudly, body humming with excitement. \u201cI don\u2019t need a dumb suit trying to tell me what to say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour funeral, kid,\u201d James murmured, and sat back.</p><p>\u201cSo...\u201d Colin tapped the photos against the tabletop. \u201cYou admit to stalking Preston Myers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was demon hunting. \u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd were you also hunting Gillian Nemont?\u201d</p><p>Bryan smiled. \u201cSaw what I did to her place, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>I\u2019ll take that as a yes, Emily thought.</p><p>\u201cAnd Dr. Drake? You been hunting her too?\u201d Colin\u2019s voice was razor sharp.</p><p>Bryan just smirked. \u201cAlmost caught her.\u201d</p><p>Colin\u2019s left hand balled into a fist. \u201cDid you now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBitch got away from me.\u201d His lips thinned. \u201cKicked me in the balls. Fought like a hellcat.\u201d He laughed then, a high-pitched, almost girlish sound. \u201cCourse that\u2019s what she is, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUmm...\u201d Colin glanced down at the photos. His jaw was clenched tight. \u201cAnd Darla Mitchell? Were you hunting her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe bitch thought she could go on TV, could hide what she was and laugh at us stupid humans.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cBut I knew what she was. I knew! \u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you admit to hunting her.\u201d Colin slid a photograph across the table. \u201cDid you kill her too?\u201d</p><p>Bryan stared down at the photo. The color drained from his face. \u201cWhat the fuck! \u201d</p><p>\u201cLook at it,\u201d Colin snarled. \u201cYou see the blood? You see her face? Her throat was ripped out, clawed out\u2014and she died in a pool of her own blood.\u201d</p><p>Bryan\u2019s eyes had doubled in size. His Adam\u2019s apple bobbed as he stared at the photo.</p><p>\u201cHe had no idea what the body looked like,\u201d Emily whispered. Because he hadn\u2019t been there for the kill.</p><p>\u201cShe wasn\u2019t a demon,\u201d Brooks told him, tapping his fingers against the photo. \u201cShe was human, just like you and me. And she screamed and she bled, and she died.\u201d</p><p>The boy was shaking his head. \u201cNo, no, I didn\u2019t do that! I didn\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you were hunting her, right?\u201d Colin pushed. \u201cJust like you were hunting Preston.\u201d He pushed another photo in front of Bryan.</p><p>The boy gagged.</p><p>\u201cYou were hunting them, planning to kill them\u2014\u201d</p><p>Bryan shoved the pictures away. \u201cI-I wasn\u2019t\u2014I was just w-watching them\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cStalking them,\u201d Brooks corrected, the warmth gone from his voice. \u201cYou were stalking the victims because you thought they were demons and you wanted to kill them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo! No!\u201d Bryan\u2019s head shook frantically. \u201cI-I was just\u2014just supposed to watch!\u201d</p><p>Supposed to watch. Emily\u2019s breath caught. This was it.</p><p>\u201cSupposed to, huh?\u201d Brooks leaned back in his chair. \u201cAnd just who told you that you were supposed to watch them?\u201d</p><p>Horror filled the kid\u2019s face. His lips clamped together.</p><p>Don\u2019t stop now. Emily touched the cold mirror pane.</p><p>\u201cWho told you to watch the demons?\u201d Colin snarled.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Bryan fisted his hands. Lifted his chin. \u201cI ain\u2019t saying another word.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should\u2019ve stopped talking fifteen minutes ago, kid,\u201d his lawyer muttered.</p><p>\u201cShit.\u201d McNeal touched Emily\u2019s shoulder. \u201cAll right, Doc. It\u2019s showtime. Get in there and find out everything that punk knows about the Night Butcher.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 14</p><p>The door squeaked softly when she entered the small interrogation room. Bryan Trace looked up at her approach, his eyes flaring. \u201cWhat the hell is she doing here?\u201d He started to rise, but Colin clamped his hand down on the boy\u2019s shoulder again and held him in his seat.</p><p>Her stomach was in knots. Her knees shaking. But Emily calmly walked across the small room. A chair was waiting for her. A chair right across from the would-be demon hunter.</p><p>Emily sat down. Stared at him. And waited.</p><p>She didn\u2019t have to wait long.</p><p>\u201cKeep her away from me,\u201d he muttered, rocking back and forth in his seat as he stared at her. A trickle of sweat slid down his temple. \u201cShe\u2019s a fucking demon! Can\u2019t you see that?\u201d</p><p>Emily pushed her glasses higher onto the bridge of her nose. \u201cWhen you look at me, Bryan, what do you see?\u201d</p><p>He opened his mouth, blinked, shook his head. \u201cIt\u2019s a trick, it\u2019s a\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo I have horns?\u201d Course, only the really, really old demons had those. \u201cA pointed tail? Glowing eyes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re mocking me,\u201d he gritted.</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m trying to understand you.\u201d And she was. \u201cWhat makes you think I\u2019m a demon? That Preston was a demon? Gillian?</p><p>Darla?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re tricking me,\u201d he said again, glancing nervously around the room. \u201cIt\u2019s not gonna work. I know what you are!\u201d</p><p>\u201cA demon.\u201d</p><p>A quick, jerky nod.</p><p>\u201cHow do you know?\u201d She pitched her voice low, tried to soothe. \u201cHow do you know who is a demon and who isn\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI-I just do.\u201d</p><p>Emily leaned across the table. Tapped the crime scene photo of Darla. \u201cYou sure she was a demon? Cause she just looks like a dead woman to me.\u201d</p><p>His gaze dropped to the photo. His lips trembled. \u201cI didn\u2019t do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I thought you were a hunter.\u201d She kept her voice calm. \u201cAnd hunters kill, don\u2019t they?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI-I was watching.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWatching? You weren\u2019t just watching with me.\u201d Her hand rose to her cheek. Lightly touched the bruise. His bright stare shot to her cheek.</p><p>\u201cI-I was warning\u2014\u201d</p><p>Time to push him over the edge. \u201cWarning me? Or trying to kill me...the way you did the others?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t kill them! I was watching, learning\u2014\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Learning. Her heart was thumping like crazy. \u201cLearning what?\u201d Emily asked softly. Brooks and Colin were silent, watchful. And Colin still had his hand clamped on Bryan\u2019s shoulder. \u201cLearning our routines? Learning when we were alone, when we weren\u2019t?\u201d It was the only thing that made sense.</p><p>Bryan didn\u2019t reply.</p><p>\u201cSomeone told you to watch us, right, Bryan?\u201d</p> <p>He turned to his lawyer. \u201cI don\u2019t want to talk to this demon bitch anymore.\u201d</p><p>James raised his brows. \u201cYou heard my client.\u201d</p><p>Dammit. Emily sucked in a sharp breath. The boy was stubborn. Scared to death. And not talking.</p><p>She wet her lips. There was one other method she could try.</p><p>Her psychic gift had never worked with humans. She couldn\u2019t read them like she did the Other, and she\u2019d only been able to pick up the barest of impressions in the past, but she didn\u2019t have anything to lose by trying.</p> <p>She inhaled deeply, exhaled. Kept her eyes locked on Bryan. And slowly lowered her mental shields.</p><p>She shouldn\u2019t be here. Bastard marked her. Can see his fingers on her neck. She shouldn\u2019t\u2014</p><p>Colin\u2019s thoughts hit her like a train, slamming into her mind with the force of his fury behind them.</p><p>Emily drew in another deep breath, tried to shift her focus away from him.</p><p>Kid\u2019s lying. We\u2019ve got to break him. I don\u2019t want a dead cop on tomorrow\u2019s news.</p><p>McNeal.</p> <p>Another breath. Her eyes narrowed as she stared at Bryan. Colin and McNeal\u2019s thoughts became a distant buzz in her mind.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t hear any thoughts from the boy. Couldn\u2019t feel any emotions. She could see his fear and anger, see it on his face, but she couldn\u2019t feel anything.</p><p>Catch had tried to teach her to hone her gift. During her \u201ctherapy\u201d sessions, they\u2019d spent hours trying to strengthen her abilities. But the lessons had never seemed to take.</p><p>She stared into Bryan\u2019s eyes, stared straight into his black pupils and tried to put every ounce of her power into forming a link with him. The air seemed to thicken around her. To tighten and\u2014</p><p>Emily jerked back, gasping. \u201cHe told you we were demons.\u201d</p><p>Bryan shook his head. \u201cYou don\u2019t know\u2014\u201d</p><p>Emily stood. She\u2019d gotten only a vague impression from the boy. But it was all she\u2019d need. She glanced at James. \u201cYour client needs serious counseling. He\u2019s not competent for trial.\u201d No, he wasn\u2019t competent. And it would take years to get him back to some semblance of normalcy.</p><p>Because a demon had been playing with his head. Twisting his thoughts. Using him.</p> <p>She hadn\u2019t been able to touch Bryan\u2019s mind. The human mind was closed to her. But she\u2019d touched the remnants of a demon\u2019s power.</p><p>A very powerful demon.</p><p>She needed to talk with Colin and McNeal. Because either they were looking for two monsters who were working together or the killer was one damn strong hybrid.</p><p>A demon/shifter hybrid.</p><p>It was the deadliest combination she could think of, and the one guaranteed to bring a wake of murder and destruction to the city.</p><p>Something is wrong with Emily. Colin waited until another detective tagged out with him before he followed her out of the interrogation room.</p><p>She was standing next to McNeal, whispering furiously.</p><p>His insides tightened at the strained expression on her face. Oh yeah, something is definitely up.</p><p>He stalked toward and fought the urge to pull Emily against him. Now wasn\u2019t the time.</p><p>When Trace had attacked her, the beast had snarled within him, and he\u2019d thought, for one terrible, timeless moment, that he was going to shift. Right there, in front of a dozen cops.</p><p>But his control had held. He\u2019d told Emily that the man controlled the beast. So far, that statement had been true in his life. He was realizing, though, that if anyone could make him lose control, it would be Emily.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell do you mean, two killers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t\u2014\u201d She broke off, glancing up at Colin\u2019s approach. \u201cGood. I wanted to talk to you.\u201d</p><p>And he wanted to do a hell of a lot more than talk to her. \u201cWhat\u2019s happening?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDuring interrogation, umm, I\u2013\u201d She flushed, looking vaguely guilty and admitted, \u201cI dropped my mental shields and tried to touch Bryan\u2019s mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut he\u2019s human.\u201d A pause. \u201cIsn\u2019t he?\u201d The kid didn\u2019t smell like a shifter. He just smelled like prey. The way most humans did.</p><p>Except Emily.</p><p>She smelled like...roses. Cream. Woman.</p><p>\u201cYeah, he\u2019s human. And I couldn\u2019t read a thing from him.\u201d She licked her lips. \u201cBut I felt the trace of power.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhose power?\u201d McNeal asked sharply.</p><p>\u201cA demon\u2019s. High level.\u201d She glanced around quickly to make certain they weren\u2019t being overheard. \u201cSome demons can control humans, if they\u2019re strong enough. Make them into puppets.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe possessed.\u201d McNeal nodded, apparently familiar with the term.</p><p>\u201cRight. I-I think that\u2019s what happened with Bryan. He honestly doesn\u2019t know why he thinks I\u2019m a demon. He doesn\u2019t know why he\u2019s supposed to follow me. He just does.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause some all-powerful demon put the idea in his head?\u201d Colin frowned. \u201cLook, that sounds crazy as\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s happened before. Many, many times. Demons kill this way\u2014they keep their hands clean and let their puppets do the dirty work.\u201d Emily met his gaze. \u201cIt even happened to me once.\u201d</p><p>When she\u2019d nearly been put into a coma.</p><p>\u201cI was able to fight the guy off, but someone without my psychic gift, he\u2019d be helpless.\u201d</p><p>Possessed.</p><p>\u201cSo this punk\u2019s been stalking, sorry, hunting, because some demon put it in his head that was his duty?\u201d Sounded like bullshit.</p><p>Damn. Why couldn\u2019t the cases be easy anymore?</p><p>\u201cYes, that\u2019s exactly what I think happened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo are we looking for two killers?\u201d McNeal demanded. \u201cIs the demon making the shifter take his kills? What in the hell is going on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, I think I know.\u201d Colin spoke slowly. A powerful demon. A deadly shifter. He met Emily\u2019s gaze and realized the doc was thinking the same thing.</p><p>Fuck.</p><p>There\u2019s talk of a hybrid demon in town. A strong demon, a nine or ten. Niol\u2019s words echoed in his mind. The sonofabitch had known, Colin realized. He\u2019d known exactly what the killer was.</p><p>But did he know who he was?</p><p>\u201cDoc, why don\u2019t you give the captain a science lesson on hybrids.\u201d He turned on his heel, heading for the door.</p><p>\u201cGyth! Where are you going?\u201d McNeal called out.</p><p>He glanced back over his shoulder, eyes narrowed. \u201cTo Paradise. I\u2019m going to find a demon and make the bastard tell me everything he knows about the Butcher.\u201d And if he had to use claws and teeth to get the information, all the better.</p><p>\u201cWait! I\u2019ll come, too! You\u2019ll need me\u2014\u201d</p><p>Colin turned around, caught Emily by her wrists, and jerked her against him. \u201cThe fucking last place I want you to be is Paradise Found.\u201d The killer could be there, waiting.</p><p>Her eyes seemed so wide behind her glasses, so green.</p><p>\u201cI can help you, Gyth, just let me\u2014\u201d</p><p>He kissed her. A hard, fast kiss with his mouth open, his tongue stabbing deep. Yeah, it was unprofessional. Yeah, the captain saw him.</p><p>But he didn\u2019t really care.</p><p>He pulled away from her. \u201cI need to do this alone, Doc.\u201d No Monster Doctor. No police partner. He inclined his head toward McNeal. \u201cAnd it needs to be off the record.\u201d Because he\u2019d do whatever he had to do to catch the killer.</p><p>No more humans were going to die on his watch.</p><p>He didn\u2019t wait for a reply. Just turned and marched away, his mind already on the coming confrontation.</p><p>It was time to find out once and for all just who was stronger\u2014the beast or the demon.</p><p>Colin had been gone for four hours. Emily paced the lobby of the station. Shit. She should have forced Colin to take her with him.</p><p>Colin didn\u2019t know the Other world like she did. He wouldn\u2019t understand the demons, the vampires, the\u2014Her cell phone beeped.</p><p>Colin. She grabbed the phone, frowning at the caller ID. She didn\u2019t recognize the number.</p><p>\u201cEmily Drake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDr. Drake!\u201d The voice was male. Highly agitated. Voices rumbled in the background. Music blared.</p><p>\u201cThomas? Is that you?\u201d It sounded like her newest patient. She\u2019d given him her number because of the serious nature of his situation, but\u2014</p><p>\u201cI-I c-can\u2019t control it! I-I\u2019m c-changing\u2014\u201d</p><p>Ice seemed to freeze her veins. \u201cWhere are you, Thomas? Thomas!\u201d</p><p>\u201cP-paradise Fou...\u201d His words ended in a snarl of pain.</p><p>The line went dead.</p><p>Niol had gone to ground. Colin sat at the bar, a cold beer bottle in his hand, and turned to slowly survey the bar.</p><p>He\u2019d searched for the demon. Gone to his house. Gone to the human girlfriend\u2019s. But the demon was nowhere to be found.</p><p>Dammit.</p><p>He gulped down some of his brew, the slightly bitter taste burning the back of his throat. He turned back to face the bartender. He figured the guy for a demon. If the guy worked for Niol, he probably had to be. Something in the employment contract...</p><p>\u201cSo how much longer is he goin\u2019 to keep me waitin\u2019?\u201d</p><p>The bartender\u2014a big, tall, black guy\u2014smiled. \u201cAs long as he wants.\u201d</p><p>Colin sat his beer down very carefully. \u201cYou know, the game\u2019s old now. You go tell your boss,\u201d cause he had a feeling he was close by, \u201cthat if he doesn\u2019t bring his pointy-tailed ass out here, I\u2019m gonna get a warrant and bust into every room in this damn hellhole you call a bar.\u201d He smiled, too, a smile that showed a lot of teeth. \u201cAnd I bet I\u2019ll find a few interesting surprises while the boys in blue and I search.\u201d</p><p>The bartender stopped smiling. Glanced slightly over Colin\u2019s shoulder.</p><p>Niol.</p><p>Colin spun around, claws ready, fangs bared, and caught the demon around the throat. He slammed him against the bar, holding him down with one hand.</p><p>The demon\u2019s black eyes stared up at him. \u201cHello, shif...ter.\u201d He choked a bit on the last word.</p><p>Emily had choked like that, when that bastard had wrapped his fingers around her.</p><p>With an effort, Colin loosened his hold. \u201cYou\u2019ve been holdin\u2019 out on me, Niol.\u201d And he didn\u2019t have time to pussyfoot around with him anymore. \u201cI want the hybrid\u2019s name.\u201d</p><p>The bartender was standing stock still, staring at them.</p><p>Niol lifted his hand, waved him away, but his black stare never left Colin. \u201cLet me go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me the name.\u201d He wasn\u2019t in the mood for this shit.</p><p>A fist plowed into his back. A strong, hard punch that drove straight into his spine.</p><p>Colin snarled and spun around. A demon stood behind him, fists raised. Colin kicked out at him, catching the guy in the ribs and sending him flying into a nearby table. People moved out of the way when the table and the demon crashed to the floor. But the music and dancing never stopped.</p><p>\u201cEnough!\u201d Niol ordered. He pointed at the fallen demon. \u201cMentaur, give us a minute.\u201d</p><p>Mentaur rose to his feet, spit at Colin, then stomped away.</p><p>Colin stepped forward, that demon ass\u2014</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t expect to attack me and not get retaliation,\u201d Niol informed him softly. \u201cMy men, they don\u2019t like to see me bothered.\u201d</p><p>Bothered. \u201cYeah, well, if you don\u2019t tell me what I want to know in the next ten seconds, they\u2019re going to see you bloody.\u201d He lifted his claws. \u201cAnd we don\u2019t want that, do we?\u201d The band began yelling a hard, fast tune. Guitars squealed.</p><p>Niol cocked his head to the side. \u201cYou\u2019re convinced the hybrid\u2019s behind the killings.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Niol didn\u2019t answer.</p><p>\u201cHis name. \u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBullshit, you know\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know he\u2019s in town because I felt the rush of his power the night you and the good doctor were attacked. But then, I\u2019m sure she felt it too. Being as how she\u2019s the professional at sensing our kind, I\u2019m sure she got a better lock on him than I did.\u201d</p><p>Niol sighed and shook his head. \u201cI don\u2019t know who he is. I only know that he\u2019s out there. He\u2019s not one of mine, shifter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d better not be lying to me.\u201d But wasn\u2019t that what demons did? Lie? Twist the truth?</p><p>Damn. He should have brought Emily with him. She\u2019d be able to sense the truth or the deception.</p><p>But he hadn\u2019t wanted to risk her.</p><p>Hadn\u2019t wanted to put her in any more danger.</p><p>\u201cYou think I don\u2019t want this guy stopped?\u201d Niol sounded mildly curious as he stared back at him.</p><p>\u201cI think you don\u2019t give a damn what happens to the humans.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I do care about what happens to my kind.\u201d</p><p>Gillian Nemont. \u201cWhere is she?\u201d</p><p>Niol didn\u2019t pretend to misunderstand. \u201cShe\u2019s already been taken care of, shifter. She was his first victim.\u201d</p><p>Sonofa\u2014 \u201cTaken care of? What the hell does that mean?\u201d</p><p>Niol\u2019s black eyes hardened and the air vibrated with the force of his rage. \u201cIt means I didn\u2019t want her dissected by one of the human doctors. Cut open. Studied. She deserved better than that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what? You took her body? Hid her? Took her clothes to make it look like she\u2019d skipped town?

You can\u2019t have your own laws, your own\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was my sister.\u201d His knuckles whitened as he fisted his hands. \u201cHe...broke her. Left her in an alley, with the garbage and the rats. Left terror in her eyes and left her in a bed of blood.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me what I can and can\u2019t do. She was mine to protect, and I did for her the only thing that I could.\u201d</p> <p>The band stopped playing. A swirl of voices filled the brief silence.</p><p>\u201cIf I knew who he was, he wouldn\u2019t still be out there, hunting,\u201d Niol muttered. \u201cThe bastard would be dead.\u201d</p><p>Colin believed him, and he also believed that Niol would have made the killer suffer, for a very long time, before he got the release of death.</p><p>A grim, humorless smile curved Niol\u2019s lips. \u201cWonder which of us will find him first?\u201d He leaned closer. \u201cAnd wonder which of us will make the bastard scream the loudest for mercy?\u201d</p><p>The animal within howled at the challenge. The man spoke through gritted teeth, \u201cThis isn\u2019t just an Other matter. Humans have died. The law will punish him. The law will\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThen the law had better get to him before I do.\u201d Niol inclined his head. \u201cEnjoy your beer, Detective. And good hunting.\u201d</p><p>Colin growled a response as Niol was swallowed by the crowd.</p><p>Good hunting.</p><p>If only it were that easy. If he could just catch the bastard\u2019s scent...</p><p>Broodingly, his gaze once again scanned the crowd. Searched the nameless faces, saw\u2014</p><p>Emily. His heart began to race in a hard, fast rhythm. She shouldn\u2019t be there. He\u2019d told her to stay away from Paradise Found.</p> <p>And here she was, walking beside some blond guy, her hand on his arm, stroking him.</p><p>What the fuck?</p><p>A musky, familiar scent flooded his nostrils. Colin surged to his feet.</p><p>Emily and her mystery guy walked through the back door of the bar.</p><p>Without a second thought, he followed them, claws bared.</p><p>\u201cThomas! No, don\u2019t!\u201d</p><p>Colin ran forward at Emily\u2019s shout, took in the scene before him in one horror-filled glance.</p><p>The man was gone. In his place stood a huge, black panther. A panther with fangs open, glistening, with a body tensed to spring.</p> <p>A shifter. He\u2019d known the instant he caught the bastard\u2019s stench in the air.</p><p>Emily stood before the beast, her right hand raised, fear on her face. She stumbled back, whispering something he couldn\u2019t hear.</p><p>The panther growled, stepped toward her, mouth ready to rip and tear\u2014</p><p>No! Not Emily. Not his mate.</p><p>Colin snarled, and the panther\u2019s head whipped toward him. The animal\u2019s back legs bunched as it prepared to leap through the air.</p><p>Shit.</p><p>There was no time to move. To draw his weapon. The panther lunged and knocked him to the ground. The animal\u2019s hot breath blew against his throat and its saliva dripped onto him as the beast lowered its mouth for the kill.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t wanted it to be this way. Hadn\u2019t wanted her to know...</p><p>Emily was screaming, running toward them.</p><p>The panther paused, its nostrils flaring, its head turning slowly, slowly toward her.</p><p>Human. Weak. Prey. It was the way of the beast. To hunt, to destroy the weak.</p><p>Not. Emily.</p><p>Razor-sharp claws dug into his chest, burned a path of fire over his skin.</p><p>And he knew there was no choice.</p><p>His teeth clenched as he opened the door of the cage inside...and let his own beast out.</p><p>Time to hunt. Time to kill.</p><p>Kill.</p><p>OhGodohGodohGod... \u201cThomas! No! Stop!\u201d The panther was on top of Colin. Even in the dim light, she could see the blood streaming down Colin\u2019s chest.</p><p>Thomas was going to kill him. She had to do something. Emily ran forward.</p><p>A long, angry howl filled the night. The hair on her nape rose. That howl...</p><p>The crunch and snapping of bones reached her ears. Colin\u2019s hands lengthened, fur sprang from his flesh.</p><p>Shifting, he was shifting...</p><p>One powerful forearm caught the panther, sent it hurtling through the air.</p><p>Colin pushed to his knees, crouched. Went to all fours. His eyes were glowing. Bright, bright blue that shone in the night.</p><p>His face was changing. The cheeks becoming sharper, the jaw longer.</p><p>The teeth much, much sharper.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t...fear...me.\u201d Not Colin\u2019s voice. A rumble, a grating demand.</p><p>The panther growled, surged to its feet, glanced at her.</p><p>Danger. Run. Kill.</p><p>Thomas\u2019s thoughts blasted her, and she could only shake her head. Who was more dangerous to her? The panther, her lover...</p><p>or\u2014</p><p>Colin tossed back his head and howled.</p><p>A wolf\u2019s howl.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>His clothes ripped, the fabric split apart. His body shifted, changing before her eyes from man to beast.</p><p>In seconds, Colin was gone. In his place stood a large, muscled, fangs wide-open wolf.</p><p>A fucking wolf. Colin wasn\u2019t just any shifter. He was a wolf.</p><p>The black wolf\u2019s bright stare centered on the panther. He growled.</p><p>And she knew that both she and Thomas were in serious danger. The wolf shifters are the strongest, the deadliest. By far, the most dangerous of their kind. She tried to touch Colin\u2019s mind. Found only a tangle of animal rage and primitive instincts demanding a kill.</p><p>Oh God. She had to try and reach him. Emily lifted her hand, palm out. \u201cColin. Colin, no.\u201d</p><p>The wolf\u2019s head turned toward her. Stared at her with eyes bright with blood hunger.</p><p>The wolf padded toward her, head low to the ground. The panther didn\u2019t move from the corner, the creature sensing the deadly threat before it.</p><p>Emily found she couldn\u2019t move either. Fear held her immobile. If she fled, he\u2019d just chase her. Wolves were notorious in their lust for the hunt.</p><p>The wolf stopped less than a foot away from her. Watched her with his fangs glinting. Then he leaped forward, driving his head into her thighs.</p><p>Emily cried out, stumbling back.</p><p>This can\u2019t be happening. Not Colin. I never thought he\u2019d hurt me. Never thought\u2014</p><p>Her back was against the wall of the alley. The wolf was in front of her.</p><p>Thomas snarled, advancing.</p><p>\u201cNo! Stay back!\u201d</p><p>The wolf spun around, hackles rising. His claws dug into the ground as he faced the panther.</p><p>As he faced the panther.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t attacking, not yet. He\u2019d pushed her into the corner, put himself before her and\u2014</p><p>He was protecting her.</p><p>Emily shook her head. If he\u2019d wanted to kill her, she\u2019d have been dead already, she realized. But he wasn\u2019t hurting her, he was placing his body between her and the panther.</p><p>I control the beast. He doesn\u2019t control me.</p><p>The panther swiped out with his claws, trying to catch the wolf in the throat. But the wolf was ready. He jerked to the side and snapped his teeth down on the panther\u2019s front leg.</p><p>The panther cried out in pain. Jerked back, limping slightly. The panther was bigger than the wolf, but only by a slim margin. Both were heavily muscled with powerful claws and razor-sharp teeth.</p><p>But the wolf\u2014there was no creature on earth stronger than a wolf shifter, and while the panther might be able to fight him for a time, in the end he would lose.</p><p>He would die.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she whispered. Dammit, she couldn\u2019t reach Colin\u2019s mind. The red haze of bloodlust was too strong. But maybe she could stop Thomas, send him away. \u201cThomas...\u201d The panther\u2019s head jerked toward her. \u201cGo, Thomas, go. I\u2019ll be all right.\u201d</p><p>The panther\u2019s eyes slit and his body pressed tightly to the ground as he prepared for another attack.</p><p>The wolf growled, raking the ground with his claws, leaving deep grooves in the pavement.</p><p>\u201cThomas, go! \u201d She screamed the command with her voice and her mind. Used every bit of her psychic strength to push the order at the panther.</p><p>The beast whimpered, then sprang toward the street, disappearing easily into the blackness of the night.</p><p>Thank God. One beast down. One to go.</p><p>Thomas would be okay. The panther shifter had been unable to transform since the death of his mate, and he\u2019d feared an uncontrolled change in public, before human eyes.</p><p>But he\u2019d managed to hold onto his human form until she\u2019d arrived and then he\u2019d shifted easily under her watchful eye in the alley.</p><p>Yes, Thomas would be fine now. But, well, she might not be.</p><p>All alone with a wolf shifter. What, was she insane? Emily gulped as the wolf swung to face her, blood dripping from his mouth.</p><p>Damn. Wolves are the most dangerous breed. They can kill without remorse. Catch had told her that, when he\u2019d started her Other training. Beware of the wolves. They have loyalty only to their mates...everyone else is just prey to them.</p><p>You don\u2019t want to be a wolf shifter\u2019s prey. She\u2019d believed him then, and everything else she\u2019d learned about the wolves had only reinforced her fear of the unpredictable breed.</p><p>But she didn\u2019t have much choice now. Running wasn\u2019t an option. The wolf would just love the hunt too much. And he would catch her, she knew that. No way could she outrun a wolf shifter in his prime.</p><p>No, running wasn\u2019t an option. Only one choice left.</p><p>Emily fell to her knees. Stared into the monster\u2019s eyes.</p><p>Her hands lifted.</p><p>The wolf tensed.</p><p>The thick scent of blood filled her nostrils. The wild musk of animal wrapped around her.</p><p>Old, half-forgotten phrases from her childhood danced through her mind.</p><p>What big teeth you have.</p><p>The better to eat you, my dear.</p><p>He could kill her in a heartbeat. Could rip her throat out in one bite.</p><p>Emily licked her lips. Pushed her trembling fingers against the beast\u2019s fur.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t Little Red Riding Hood.</p><p>Time to stop being afraid of the big, bad wolf.</p><p>Chapter 15</p><p>Blood was on his tongue. The warm, wet blood of his enemy. Colin threw back his head, howling in victory. He wanted to chase after the panther, to finish the kill, but\u2014</p><p>But Emily knelt in front of him. Her glasses gone. Her eyes wide and her face too pale. He could smell her fear in the air, and as always, that heady smell roused the beast.</p><p>He crept closer to her, wondering if he\u2019d be able to taste her fear on her skin, in her blood.</p><p>Her hands were on him, trembling as they stroked his fur. She was fucking terrified, but she didn\u2019t run.</p><p>And that fact made him angry. He\u2019d wanted her to run, then he could have hunted her, claimed her.</p><p>The man fought to leash the beast once again. Grappled to harness the strength for the shift.</p><p>Claim her. Have to claim her. The words were burning in his mind. His blood. There was no choice any longer.</p><p>Claim. Mate. Take.</p><p>The animal\u2019s instincts blended with the man\u2019s, became one.</p><p>Mate. Take.</p><p>Mine.</p><p>He\u2019d fought for her, drawn blood for her, earned her.</p><p>Mine.</p><p>His muscles burned as the fiery pain of the shift swept through him. Bones stretched, snapped, reshaped. Fur melted from his body.</p><p>Hands, legs reappeared. He shuddered as his body transformed. Anger filled him, furious rage. Emily was watching him, seeing what he was.</p><p>The monster.</p><p>Not a man, never a man.</p><p>He opened his mouth, howling, screaming into the night...and as the shift ended, the howl changed into a man\u2019s bellow of fury.</p><p>He was crouched in front of her. Emily\u2019s hands had fallen away from him. She stared into his eyes, her breath too fast, her pulse thundering at the base of her neck.</p><p>\u201cColin, are you all\u2014\u201d</p><p>He grabbed her, surging to his feet. He was naked, but he didn\u2019t feel the bite of the cold night air on his flesh. He only felt...her.</p><p>Claim. Mate. Take.</p><p>Was it the beast or the man? He didn\u2019t know. Didn\u2019t care.</p><p>He jerked open her shirt, sending buttons flying. Shoved aside her bra. His mouth locked on her nipple, sucking hard, pulling her ripe flesh deep into his mouth.</p><p>\u201cColin!\u201d Her hips twisted against his. \u201cNot here, we can\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere.\u201d Guttural. \u201cNow.\u201d His cock was fully erect, thick with lust. He wanted inside her. Needed to feel the tight clamp of her sex around him.</p><p>Mate.</p><p>He took her other breast into his mouth. Sucking. Licking. Biting.</p><p>She shuddered and moaned, a hungry, desperate sound.</p><p>Emily wanted him. Euphoria ripped through him. She knew what he was and she still wanted him.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t turning away. Her fingers were gripping his shoulders, her hips thrusting against his.</p><p>Fuck, yes.</p><p>She was wearing a skirt. A loose, black skirt that fell to her ankles.</p><p>He grabbed the material, jerking it up to her waist. His left hand found her through her panties, stroked the plump folds through the cotton. The rich scent of her arousal flooded his nostrils.</p><p>Take.</p><p>He spun her around. Her hands flew up, steadied against the wall.</p><p>Colin was shaking with the pulsing hunger thundering through him. He knew he was being too rough, but he couldn\u2019t stop.</p><p>He had to claim her. Take.</p><p>Her panties tore beneath his fingers. The lush curves of her ass beckoned him. So tempting.</p><p>He grabbed his cock, stroked the length. A drop of moisture was already on the tip.</p><p>Inside her.</p><p>Colin parted her delicate folds, lodged the tip of his cock against her opening.</p><p>\u201cNot...gonna...be...gentle.\u201d He couldn\u2019t be. Not with the lust riding him so hard. Sweat coated his body. His muscles quivered with the effort of holding back. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI...ah...don\u2019t care!\u201d She squirmed against him, her creamy core sliding around his flesh. \u201cT-take me!\u201d</p><p>His control snapped. The man, the beast, growled in pleasure. Colin thrust into Emily\u2019s sex, shoving as deep and as hard as he could.</p><p>\u201cColin! \u201d She rammed back against him. Her hands were flat against the wall as she braced her body.</p> <p>He grabbed her hair, pulled it back, baring her neck. His cock slammed into her, again, and again...</p><p>She was moaning, panting, squirming against him.

His teeth clamped down on her, pierced the delicate skin and drove into her vein.</p><p>As her hot, rich blood flowed over his tongue, he exploded inside of her, shoving deep one final time and burying his cock to the hilt inside of her.</p><p>His heart was drumming frantically. Sweat coated his body. And his teeth were still embedded in her throat.</p><p>Emily moaned softly. The sound not one of pain, but pleasure. Her sex shivered around him in a little aftershock caress.</p><p>He\u2019d been right, Colin realized. He could taste her fear. And it was heady.

To grow stronger.</p> <p>A wolf shifter drank to kill or to claim.</p><p>To kill, well, you just ripped out the throat, let the hot blood pour into your mouth or you pierced the jugular and sucked the victim slowly dry.</p><p>Emily\u2019s body sagged lightly against him.</p><p>But to claim...a wolf shifter claimed a mate only once in his life. He marked her, bit her, tasted her blood so that he took her essence inside himself.</p><p>Take. Mate.</p><p>Until death.</p><p>And sometimes beyond.</p><p>Emily\u2019s heart was slowing. Her breath becoming shallow. Colin forced his head to lift.</p> <p>Emily wasn\u2019t prey.</p><p>She was something far, far more valuable.</p><p>He lifted her into his arms. Her head rolled back against him.</p><p>Now how in the hell was he going to tell her that he\u2019d just performed the equivalent of a wolf shifter marriage with her?</p><p>A wolf shifter. The detective was a wolf. Too fucking perfect.</p><p>How long had it been since he\u2019d been able to pit his strength against another of his kind?</p><p>Too long.</p><p>Too many years of killing weaker species. But now, now there was finally someone worthy of his attack.</p><p>He watched from the shadows as Gyth cradled the woman against his body.</p><p>He\u2019d marked her. Taken her as a mate. Did the good doctor know?</p><p>She was such an Other expert...she had to suspect.</p><p>Who would have thought? The doctor, a fitting mate for a wolf shifter.</p><p>Apparently, there was more to Emily Drake than met the eye.</p><p>Not just anyone could mate with the wolves.</p><p>But Emily could.</p><p>How very interesting.</p><p>Colin held her close for another moment, then eased Emily to her feet. He grabbed his torn jeans, tried to cover his body.</p><p>Shouldered into what was left of his shirt and reached for her again.</p><p>His posture was possessive, protective as he led her from the alley.</p><p>It was a pity that the detective had just given away his weakness.</p><p>A woman.</p><p>A weak, human woman.</p><p>The humans...they died so easily. And screamed so well.</p><p>Time for another kill.</p><p>The doctor had already been on his list. Had been from the moment he\u2019d learned of Gillian\u2019s appointment with her.</p><p>No loose ends.</p><p>But now, the game had changed.</p><p>He\u2019d have to use care. The detective guarded his little doctor so well. He\u2019d have to draw her away from him, make them both vulnerable.</p><p>A smile curved his lips, pressed against his fangs.</p><p>And he knew just how to bait his trap.</p><p>Emily awoke with a start the next morning. Her heart was racing as memories of a twisted nightmare drifted from her mind. She\u2019d been hunted, bitten...</p><p>Not a dream, she realized, her hand lifting to touch her neck. The flesh was sore, slightly raised.</p><p>Last night, Colin had bitten her. Taken her blood.</p><p>Oh shit.</p><p>She swallowed, glancing around the room. His room. She didn\u2019t remember much about the ride back to Colin\u2019s place. She\u2019d been groggy from pleasure and... freaking blood loss.</p><p>She\u2019d heard of shifters biting their prey before, of course. Panthers, lions, bears...they all did it\u2014often in human form just with their sharpened teeth. Supposedly, the blood gave them a sexual boost.</p><p>But she\u2019d also heard of shifters taking the blood of their mates. And last night, with Colin, she hadn\u2019t felt like prey.</p><p>She\u2019d felt like a mate.</p><p>Shit.</p><p>She\u2019d always thought she\u2019d wind up with some nice, easygoing, normal guy. A banker or an accountant or something equally boring and nondangerous.</p><p>Not a wolf shifter.</p><p>What had she done?</p><p>And why was the house so silent? \u201cColin?\u201d No response. Emily raised her voice, tried again, \u201cColin!\u201d</p><p>Nothing. She glanced at the bedside clock. Eight-thirty. He\u2019d probably already gone to the station.</p><p>There was a bag near the foot of the bed. Emily saw the bright logo on the side. Her new clothes.</p><p>How had they gotten there? She\u2019d thought she left them in her car at the station\u2014</p><p>A faint beeping filled the room, and Emily recognized her ring tone. She stumbled from the bed, finding her purse on the floor. She grabbed the phone. \u201cDrake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDr. Drake...it\u2019s Smith.\u201d</p><p>The ME\u2019s voice sounded slightly distorted. Emily hurried across the room in an attempt to get better reception. \u201cSmith? What is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeed...see...you.\u201d</p><p>Her voice was too high, Emily thought, and the fear she heard had nothing to do with bad reception. Had Smith found out something about the case? About the Other? \u201cA-all right. Are you at the lab?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Hurry.\u201d The call ended with a click.</p><p>Emily frowned down at the phone.</p><p>Colin had been busy, Emily realized. When she went outside, she found her car waiting for her. That explains the clothes. She\u2019d left the new bag of clothing on her backseat.</p><p>Twenty minutes later, she was walking into the station. She deliberately avoided Colin\u2019s floor, not wanting to see him then. She\u2019d left her hair loose in an effort to hide the bruise on her throat.</p><p>She didn\u2019t know what she\u2019d do if she saw him. Kiss him...or hit the bastard as hard as she could. Damn but she felt so confused.</p><p>She wanted him, there was no denying that. But more, she\u2019d started to trust Colin, and she hadn\u2019t trusted a man in years.</p><p>She was in trouble. Serious trouble. Because she wasn\u2019t exactly sure where the physical need for Colin ended and where something much more serious began.</p><p>The elevator chimed and the doors opened on the bottom floor. Emily stepped into the hallway, hearing the faint beat of Smith\u2019s jazz music. Her high heels clicked on the floor as she stepped forward. She pushed open the door to the lab. \u201cSmith, I\u2019m here\u2014\u201d</p><p>Her words ended on a rush of breath as she saw the puddle of blood near Smith\u2019s desk.</p><p>Maybe I\u2019ll go for a woman again the next time too.</p><p>No, oh God, no.</p><p>\u201cSmith! \u201d Emily ran forward, screaming the ME\u2019s name. Her shoes slipped in the blood.</p><p>Oh shit. The lab was trashed. Desks overturned. Files littering the floor. Equipment smashed.</p><p>More blood. Pooling on the floor.</p><p>But no body. No sign of Smith.</p><p>Without a hesitation, Emily lowered her mental shields. She had to know if the Butcher had been there.</p><p>The rage hit her, driving her to her knees. The same black taint of power that she\u2019d felt before lingered in the air.</p><p>The Night Butcher. But it looked like the bastard had changed his MO. He\u2019d struck during the day. When no one would suspect.</p><p>And he\u2019d taken Smith.</p><p>Why? Emily stood slowly, knees shaking. Her gaze swept over the lab. He left his kills. Left them to taunt the police. There was no reason for him to take Smith.</p><p>Unless...</p><p>Emily turned on her heel and ran down the hall.</p><p>Unless the bastard had kept her alive.</p><p>Twelve hours had passed. Emily sat at Colin\u2019s desk, a mug of coffee cradled in her hands.</p><p>McNeal paced in front of her, his face blood red. \u201cNot one fucking cop saw him! The asshole came into my station, took Smith, and not one fucking cop saw him!\u201d</p><p>It was the same thing he\u2019d been saying for hours. His hands were shaking, and his eyes were wild with worry and rage.</p><p>There was something there, Emily thought. The way McNeal was acting, he and Smith were more than just\u2014</p><p>Colin\u2019s phone rang. They all seemed to freeze, then Colin\u2019s hand flashed out, jerked up the black receiver.</p><p>\u201cGyth.\u201d</p><p>His eyes widened and he motioned to Brooks. His partner instantly turned on the small, black tracking device that was attached to the phone.</p><p>The station fell silent as Colin\u2019s call echoed on the nearby speaker.</p><p>\u201cWere you waiting for my call, Detective?\u201d The voice was distorted, robotic.</p><p>\u201cWho is this?\u201d Colin demanded, his knuckles whitening around the phone.</p><p>\u201cYou know who I am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t. So why don\u2019t you just\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe press calls me the Night Butcher, but as you\u2019ve seen, I don\u2019t just hunt at night.\u201d He laughed, a grating sound that sent a shiver down Emily\u2019s back.</p><p>\u201cAsk the bastard about Smith,\u201d McNeal ordered.</p><p>\u201cI want to talk to Smith,\u201d Colin snapped.</p><p>\u201cAh, yes, I figured you would. Good thing I haven\u2019t ripped her throat out, yet. It would make talking so hard.\u201d</p><p>A woman\u2019s scream echoed across the line.</p><p>Smith.</p><p>\u201cM-McNeal, h-help\u2014\u201d A pain-filled moan broke her words.</p><p>More laughter. And dead silence from Smith.</p><p>Emily swallowed.</p><p>The officers gathered around her were pale, their faces tight with concentration.</p><p>But Colin...he had rage in his eyes. So much rage. The beast wants out.</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck do you want, Butcher?\u201d</p><p>Silence. Too long. Too thick.</p><p>Colin gritted his teeth. \u201cDammit\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have the wrong doctor.\u201d</p><p>Emily\u2019s blood froze.</p><p>Colin\u2019s gaze shot to hers.</p><p>\u201cI want the other one.\u201d</p><p>His stare never left her. \u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about, you crazy bastard, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s in front of you, isn\u2019t she? Pretty little Doctor Drake. She\u2019s rather extraordinary. Knows so much about...our kind.\u201d</p><p>McNeal swore.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll offer you a deal, Detective. Smith for Dr. Drake. An even trade.\u201d</p><p>And she saw Colin\u2019s control snap. \u201cFuck, no, you sonofa\u2014\u201d</p><p>Emily shot to her feet. Punched the button for the phone\u2019s intercom so she could speak. \u201cTell me where and when.\u201d No way was she going to sit back and let Smith die. Not if there was a chance they could save her.</p><p>A beat of silence, then, \u201cDr. Drake.\u201d He purred the words. As much as a robot could purr. \u201cI had a feeling you were there.\u201d</p><p>So the asshole got bonus points for being right. \u201cDon\u2019t hurt Smith,\u201d she ordered, her voice flat and cold. \u201cTell me where to be, and I\u2019ll make the trade.\u201d</p><p>Colin was shaking his head. His hand flashed out, locked around her wrist. \u201cNo damn way.\u201d</p><p>Emily lifted her chin. \u201cTell me where,\u201d she repeated.</p><p>\u201cWarehouse district. Building 13. You come alone, Doctor. All alone. If I so much as smell a cop, you\u2019ll be swimming in Smith\u2019s blood.\u201d</p><p>She believed him.</p><p>\u201cMidnight, Dr. Drake. I\u2019ll see you then.\u201d The hum of a dial tone resonated from the phone.</p><p>Emily exhaled the breath she\u2019d been holding. Colin stared down at her, his face an iron mask. \u201cYou\u2019re not going.\u201d An order. One that he fully expected to be obeyed.</p><p>\u201cIf I don\u2019t, she\u2019s dead.\u201d And she couldn\u2019t have Smith\u2019s death on her conscience.</p><p>\u201cIn my office, now. \u201d McNeal stormed ahead of them, not glancing back to see if he was obeyed.</p><p>Colin dragged Emily with him, keeping his tight grip on her wrist. He jerked her inside, slamming the door behind them.</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck were you thinking?\u201d he snarled. \u201cYou do not, do not, ever interfere in my investigation like that again, do you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did what I had to do.\u201d Smith\u2019s life was on the line. There\u2019d been no choice. \u201cTell me, Colin, if he\u2019d offered to trade her for you, what would you have done?\u201d</p><p>His clenched jaw was her answer.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got to help her. If I don\u2019t, he\u2019ll kill her.\u201d Rip out her throat, just as he\u2019d done to the others.</p><p>\u201cWhen you walk into that warehouse, he\u2019ll kill you,\u201d he gritted. He yanked her closer to him, pressing his body against hers, flesh to flesh. His heat wrapped around her, his fury hovered in the air surrounding them. \u201cYou think I\u2019m just gonna stand by and let that happen?\u201d He kissed her hard, his lips bruising and hot. \u201cNo fucking way. I just found you. I\u2019m not about to lose you now.\u201d</p><p>Her breath caught. \u201cColin...\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you two are done, we need to figure out just what the hell our next move is gonna be,\u201d McNeal growled, slamming his fist against the desk. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Emily jerked. She\u2019d almost forgotten about him.</p><p>\u201cThis guy\u2019s a shifter, so when he said he could smell a cop, I know the bastard meant it.\u201d His lips thinned. \u201cSo how are we supposed to get backup in there without him going crazy and killing Smith?\u201d</p><p>Emily glanced up at Colin. There might be a way...</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll shift,\u201d Colin muttered. \u201cHe\u2019ll smell animal, not man.\u201d</p><p>McNeal\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u201cShift.\u201d He whistled. \u201cSo you\u2019re one of them.\u201d A pause. \u201cI knew you were Other, but I didn\u2019t realize\u2014</p><p>\u201d</p><p>McNeal broke off, shaking his head. \u201cA shifter.\u201d</p><p>If he only knew the full story, Emily thought.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll follow Emily, track her into the warehouse.\u201d His hand tightened around her wrist. \u201cAnd I\u2019ll catch the bastard.\u201d</p><p>McNeal cast a brief glance toward Emily. \u201cGive us a minute, would you, Emily?\u201d</p><p>She nodded, aware of a new tension in the room. She stepped forward, but Colin\u2019s hold didn\u2019t budge.</p><p>\u201cColin...\u201d</p><p>He swallowed. Slowly, his fingers uncurled. Lifted. His eyes were burning with emotion and the faintest hint of fang gleamed behind his lips.</p><p>Emily lifted her hand, stroked his cheek. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be all right.\u201d She said the words, not certain if she meant them, just wanting to ease the fear she could see lurking in his gaze.</p> <p>He turned his face. Pressed his lips against her palm.</p><p>The mark on her neck seemed to throb.</p><p>\u201cI-I\u2019ll be right outside.\u201d Getting ready to face a killer. Trying to stop her knees from knocking together.</p><p>Pretending that she was brave when really she was so scared she thought she\u2019d vomit.</p><p>Oh God. What if she couldn\u2019t stop him from killing Smith?</p><p>Or from killing her?</p><p>Emily pulled away from Colin and hurried out of the office, fighting the fear that pummeled her.</p><p>He wanted to take his mate away. Wanted to toss her over his shoulder and carry her far away. To someplace safe.</p> <p>A place without psychotic killers. A place quiet, peaceful. A place where he could put her in a big, nice bed and make love to her for hours.</p><p>He wanted to take her anyplace but to that godforsaken warehouse.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t send any other men in with you.\u201d McNeal was watching him with eyes that saw too much. \u201cI can\u2019t risk the humans finding out what we\u2019re fighting.\u201d</p><p>He understood that. When they got to the warehouse, the Butcher might not be in human form. And if the other cops saw him shift...</p><p>\u201cAnd I don\u2019t want you to \u2018catch\u2019 this guy, Gyth.\u201d McNeal stared him straight in the eye. \u201cHe can\u2019t see the inside of a courtroom.\u201d</p><p>Colin nodded. He\u2019d already figured that out.</p><p>\u201cDo what you have to do. Just get the women back safe.\u201d A pause. \u201cAnd make certain that bastard doesn\u2019t have the chance to ever hurt anyone else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry.\u201d His voice had turned guttural. The wolf was close.</p><p>The Night Butcher had claimed his last victim.</p><p>Colin held his captain\u2019s stare, let the other man see the intent in his eyes. \u201cThe bastard was a dead man the minute he asked for the trade.\u201d No one would threaten his mate and live.</p><p>No one.</p><p>Time to hunt his prey...</p><p>And protect his mate.</p><p>Chapter 16</p><p>The night air was cold. Emily\u2019s breath formed a small cloud before her as she walked through the darkened warehouse district.</p><p>There were rustles all around her. The scurry of rats and cockroaches. The howl of wind. The distant hum of a train.</p><p>Building 13 stood in front of her. Windows boarded up. Completely black.</p><p>The holster of her gun dug into Emily\u2019s back. McNeal had given her the weapon and the bullets before she\u2019d left the station.</p><p>\u201cAim and shoot,\u201d he\u2019d said.</p><p>And she would. She knew how to shoot, and she wouldn\u2019t hesitate to fire when she saw the Butcher.</p><p>She didn\u2019t hear Colin behind her, but she knew he was there. Tracking her, as the wolf.</p><p>His scent was already on her, so that had to work to their advantage. The Butcher wouldn\u2019t be able to distinguish between them.</p><p>He\u2019d think it was just one person.</p><p>The doors were in front of her. Emily lifted her hands and shoved against the old wood. With a loud groan, it gave way beneath her fingers.</p><p>A dark cavern waited for her. She stared into the darkness, knowing that the killer was waiting for her.</p><p>A faint moan reached her ears. Broken. Full of pain.</p><p>She licked her lips. Reached for the small flashlight she\u2019d tucked into her jacket pocket. The light flashed on, cut a thin swath of light through the blackness. She wasn\u2019t worried about the light giving away her position. If the killer was a hybrid like she suspected, he\u2019d be able to see just as easily in the darkness.</p><p>The building smelled of mold and rotted wood. Cobwebs brushed her face and something ran across her left foot.</p><p>\u201cSmith?\u201d Emily raised her voice, tried again. \u201cSmith?\u201d</p><p>A whimper came from the darkness.</p><p>Emily crept forward. Swung her light to the left, the right\u2014</p><p>There. Crumpled against the back wall. Head sagging to the side. A broken doll.</p><p>Smith.</p><p>Emily ran to her. The light hit Smith\u2019s body, showing the cuts and bites that covered her skin. Blood matted her hair, trickled down her bare arms and legs.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid I got a little bored while I was waiting for you.\u201d The voice came from the darkness, echoed all around her. No longer distorted. Male. Strong. Hard.</p><p>She stiffened. She knew that voice. Emily passed the flashlight to her left hand. Slowly inched her right toward her gun.</p><p>It can\u2019t be, it doesn\u2019t make any sense. How can it be him? I\u2019ve felt his power before. He isn\u2019t strong enough to\u2014</p><p>There was a rush of wind against her body and then his hands were on her, jerking her around, spinning her to face him. \u201cTell me, Doctor,\u201d Jake Donnelley murmured, his fangs bared and his eyes eerily black in the glow of her flashlight, \u201care you going to scream for me?\u201d</p><p>Then his claws raked across her stomach, and she screamed as her flesh ripped open.</p><p>Emily! Her scream cut through him. Colin lunged through the open doors of the factory, his body springing through the air and landing in a deadly crouch. A snarl twisted the wolf\u2019s lips as he searched for his mate.</p><p>The scent of blood filled the air.</p><p>Emily\u2019s blood.</p><p>A red haze swam before his eyes. Kill. Destroy\u2014</p><p>A man laughed. A sinister, cold laugh. \u201cI thought you\u2019d be joining us, Gyth.\u201d</p><p>Emily appeared before him, and Colin could easily see the blood running down the front of her shirt. Her eyes were huge. Her lips shaking.</p><p>Behind her, Jake Donnelley stood smiling at him. He had a hand wrapped around Emily\u2019s throat. His claws pressed against her flesh and a drop of blood trailed down her neck.</p><p>Colin scraped his claws across the cement floor, preparing to attack.</p><p>\u201cNot so fast, wolf.\u201d The claws dug deeper and a soft moan slipped past Emily\u2019s lips. \u201cIf you move another inch, I\u2019ll slice her open in front of you.\u201d</p><p>Colin snarled at him, but he didn\u2019t move, not yet.</p><p>\u201cSo now the question becomes, who to kill first?\u201d Jake lowered his head to Emily\u2019s throat, slowly licked away the drop of blood.</p><p>\u201cOh, I do like the way you taste...\u201d</p><p>Emily steeled herself against the feel of his tongue on her neck. She wanted to scream, to howl in pain and fear, but she vowed not to cry out again.</p><p>Because he wanted it too much.</p><p>Colin snarled in front of her, snapping his teeth, his glowing eyes locked on Jake.</p><p>Jake. God, she\u2019d been so wrong about him. She\u2019d thought he was weak, harmless. How the hell could she have made such a mistake?</p><p>She\u2019d never even sensed that he was a hybrid. Never seen the glow of the beast he carried. She\u2019d thought he was just a low-level demon.</p><p>Wrong. So wrong. And her mistake just might cost them all their lives.</p><p>She\u2019d kept her shields in place too long, Emily realized. She\u2019d been so afraid of finding a being like the one who\u2019d attacked her years before, and she\u2019d guarded herself too well. Yes, she\u2019d been safe, but she\u2019d unknowingly let a killer run free when she could have stopped him.</p><p>Her stomach felt as if it were on fire. She didn\u2019t know how bad her injury was, and she was afraid to look down. So she kept her gaze on Colin, knowing that they had to find a way to defeat Jake.</p><p>One unguarded moment. That\u2019s all Colin would need. If he could just get one moment, she knew he\u2019d attack.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t understand our kind nearly as well as you thought, Doctor.\u201d Jake whispered the words into her ear, blowing his breath lightly against her. \u201cYou thought you were so superior, so damn smart, judging us all. Reading us. But you were wrong...\u201d</p><p>\u201cY-yes...I was.\u201d Lull him. Make him think I\u2019m not a threat.</p><p>\u201cYou saw what I wanted you to see,\u201d he muttered, and his claws scraped against her throat. \u201cYou thought you were immune to a demon\u2019s power...but I fooled you...made you see, feel, what I wanted.\u201d</p><p>And she\u2019d \u201cseen\u201d a low-level demon. Emily swallowed, feeling the prick of his claws. She should have looked harder, searched his mind.</p><p>Too late for regrets. Focus, dammit! I have to give Colin a chance to attack.</p><p>Or they were dead.</p><p>Colin\u2019s gaze bored into her.</p><p>Just how much power did Jake have? There was really only one way to find out.</p><p>The last time she\u2019d gone against a high-level demon, she\u2019d wound up unconscious on the floor.</p><p>But she\u2019d almost managed to burn out the bastard\u2019s power.</p><p>Maybe she could do it again.</p><p>Her jaw clenched and she lowered her shields.</p><p>The rage hit her first. Blinding. Pulsing. Hate. Fury. The emotions seethed within the demon hybrid behind her.</p><p>Then she felt his power. A dark, coiling black force that shot from his body, filled the very air itself and twined around her and Colin.</p><p>Level ten. Maybe even stronger. Shit.</p><p>\u201cDoctor...\u201d Hot breath on her cheek. \u201cIs that you I feel, tiptoeing in my head?\u201d</p><p>A psychic blast of power hit her, shooting pain through every inch of her body. Emily bit her lip, swaying under the impact.</p><p>Too strong. I\u2019ll never be able to\u2014</p><p>\u201cYou have no idea what I can do,\u201d he muttered. \u201cBut maybe I should show you.\u201d His head lifted. \u201cTime to play with the wolf.\u201d</p><p>The waves of his power shifted for a moment, pulsed darker, then swept completely around Colin.</p><p>Shifters are immune to a demon\u2019s power. Colin hadn\u2019t even flinched under the whip of Niol\u2019s dark gifts.</p><p>He\u2019d be able to withstand Jake\u2019s magical assault.</p><p>Wouldn\u2019t he?</p><p>There was so much power.</p><p>The wolf inched back a step, tail lowering.</p><p>\u201cI can control anyone,\u201d Jake snarled. \u201cAnything. \u201d</p><p>He\u2019d controlled the boy, Bryan Trace. Gotten him to stalk Jake\u2019s victims.</p><p>But not Colin, please, not Colin.</p><p>Emily frantically tried to pull away from Jake\u2019s mind, tried to reach Colin\u2019s thoughts\u2014</p><p>But she couldn\u2019t feel him, couldn\u2019t touch his mind.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d The word burst from her lips. \u201cWhy the hell are you doing this?\u201d</p><p>His laughter rumbled against her back. \u201cBecause I can.\u201d</p><p>Started with that whore Gillian. Bitch thought she could leave me for a human.</p><p>Showed her. Showed them both.</p><p>Emily tensed as his thoughts slipped through her mind. She couldn\u2019t reach Colin, but she was tuned in as hell to Jake.</p><p>Forgotten how good the blood tasted.</p><p>Want more.</p><p>An image of Darla\u2019s ravaged body flashed through her mind.</p><p>More. Tired of hiding, pretending. Fucking humans will fear me now. Show \u2019em. Show \u2019em all.</p><p>Once the beast got a taste, he couldn\u2019t be stopped.</p><p>Suddenly, Jake shoved her forward, right into Colin\u2019s path.</p><p>\u201cHere\u2019s the fun part. I\u2019m not gonna kill you, Doctor.\u201d</p><p>Why wasn\u2019t Colin attacking him? His claws were down. It\u2019d be the perfect time. Emily glanced frantically between the two of them.</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m not gonna be the one to rip that pretty throat open. I\u2019m gonna let your lover do it.\u201d</p><p>I can control anyone. Anything. Even a shifter. Blood to blood.</p><p>Shit. Jake could control his kind\u2014not just demons, but also shifters. The power was always in the blood.</p><p>The wolf\u2019s jaws were open, glistening. His eyes bright with blood hunger.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Not Colin. She had to reach him. Had to help him. \u201cYou control the beast,\u201d she whispered, lifting her hand slowly toward him. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t control you...\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I control him.\u201d</p><p>She reached for her gun, but the holster was empty. Jake must have disarmed her when he\u2019d first grabbed her. Dammit! Colin growled and stalked toward her.</p><p>No. Not like this. She wasn\u2019t going to die like this. Not in some dank building, not by her lover\u2019s hand.</p><p>Her shields were down, completely gone. And with all of her energy, with every bit of psychic power that she had, Emily focused on reaching Colin\u2019s mind. On getting past the killing fury and touching the man.</p><p>No, don\u2019t let him do this to you. To us. Fight him, dammit! You have to be stronger, I need you\u2014</p><p>\u201cAhhh!\u201d Blinding pain exploded in her head, and Emily fell to her knees. Jake\u2019s dark power poured through her, ripping apart her mind, taking her memories, stealing her power\u2014 </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNot gonna happen, bitch,\u201d he snarled. \u201cTonight you die.\u201d</p><p>Just like before. The pain was the same. He was forcing his way into her mind, using his magic against her, hurting her.</p><p>\u201cStop!\u201d She pushed the flow of her psychic energy back on him, digging just as hard into his mind as he was hers. She\u2019d burn the bastard out, just like before.</p> <p>Or she\u2019d fucking die trying.</p><p>The images began rolling in front of her mind\u2019s eye. Faster, faster...</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s over, Jake...\u201d</p><p>A dark alley. A woman in a red dress.</p><p>A scream.</p> <p>The woman dropped to the ground. Throat slashed. Blood all around.</p><p>Oh God. The pain was ripping her apart.</p><p>A circle of men, all in black, stood glaring next to an abandoned building. \u201cYou didn\u2019t tell us he was a shifter,\u201d one snarled, lifting his hand and pointing his finger straight ahead. A snake tattoo bared its fangs on his wrist. \u201cWe ain\u2019t fuckin\u2019 with no shifter again\u2014\u201d</p><p>A shot rang out. A circle of blood appeared on his chest. Three more shots.</p><p>Down, down go the demons.</p><p>Emily bit her lip, tasted blood as she fought to force the psychic power back on him.</p> <p>\u201cWhat the fuck do you want?\u201d Darla frowned, her brows drawn low. \u201cYou know I\u2019m working on the story about\u2014\u201d</p><p>Her blood sprayed on the wall behind her.</p><p>So much blood.</p><p>Emily grabbed her head, screaming. The pain was too much. She couldn\u2019t fight him much longer.</p><p>Break, you sonofabitch!</p><p>Before she did...</p><p>A young boy, with the claws of a wolf and the eyes of a demon. He walked up to an old man, shuffling through the park and pushing a buggy of cans...</p><p>The blood sprayed onto the snow-covered ground.</p> <p>The taste...so good...more</p><p>More...</p><p>More...</p><p>Emily fell onto the floor, her body shaking, twitching.</p><p>Too much. She couldn\u2019t fight anymore.</p><p>Colin snarled. She forced her heavy eyelids open, saw him above her, jaws open.</p><p>No, not Colin.</p><p>She\u2019d...loved him... as much as she could love anyone.</p><p>Maybe this was the way she would die...she hoped he made it quick. She stared into his glowing eyes, her body and mind shuddering with agony and she waited.</p><p>Her lips parted, \u201cLove...\u201d It was all she could manage. But she needed to say it, even though he wouldn\u2019t understand. She had to say it once in her life, dammit, and actually mean it.</p><p>Colin sprang forward, jaws open, claws outstretched.</p><p>He flew right over her and barreled into Jake. The demon screamed in fury\u2014but the sound ended in a sudden gurgle of pain.</p><p>The agonizing torture in her mind ended. Vanished in an instant. Emily pushed up on her knees. Jake\u2019s body was twitching. She squinted in the darkness, trying to see more.</p><p>The wolf was over him, teeth lodged in the hybrid\u2019s throat.</p><p>Looked like Jake hadn\u2019t been able to control her wolf after all.</p><p>He shifted back into a man with the taste of Donnelley\u2019s blood still in his mouth. The shift came easier because the beast was satiated.</p><p>His hands clenched and the claws slowly receded. For a time there, he knew Donnelley had tried to get him to attack Emily.</p><p>He\u2019d seen the fear in her eyes, and there hadn\u2019t been a damn thing he could do about it.</p><p>Then she\u2019d started fighting, and he\u2019d sensed her energy in the air around them. He\u2019d realized that Emily and Donnelley were locked in a psychic battle, and when his mate had fallen to her knees, he\u2019d understood that she was fighting for him, struggling to give him the time he needed to attack.</p><p>He wiped the back of his hand over his mouth. Blood coated his fingers, still dripped down his chin.</p><p>Part of him wished he\u2019d made the bastard suffer more. You died too easily. You should have screamed for death.</p><p>Donnelley stared sightlessly up at him, blood pooling beneath him. His throat was ripped wide open, his head barely hanging on.</p><p>Not even a full-blooded shifter could heal from a wound like that.</p><p>A soft footfall sounded behind him. He didn\u2019t glance back. Emily shouldn\u2019t see him this way. He didn\u2019t want her to see him this way. Not with the blood of the kill on him.</p><p>For one terrible moment, he\u2019d wanted to feel her neck beneath his claws and teeth.</p><p>For that, he wanted to kill the bastard all over again.</p><p>\u201cColin...\u201d Soft, husky. \u201cA-are you all right?\u201d</p><p>I nearly killed you. No, he wasn\u2019t fucking all right. A growl rumbled in his throat.</p><p>A quick inhalation of breath. \u201cH-he\u2019s dead.\u201d</p><p>Unless Donnelley could somehow breathe without a windpipe, yeah, he was dead.</p><p>Colin stared down at Donnelley\u2019s face. His eyes were wide open, his mouth twisted in a snarl. Didn\u2019t think you\u2019d die, did you, asshole?</p><p>His hands clenched into fists and he forced himself to look at Emily. He could still smell her blood. The blood that had tempted him.</p><p>\u201cWe need to get you to a hospital.\u201d</p><p>She was squinting down at the body, trying to see clearer with her human eyes in the darkness.</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m okay, I just\u2014\u201d Her hand lifted, brushed against her stomach, and a hiss of pain slipped past her lips. \u201cIt\u2019s bloody as hell, but I-I don\u2019t think it\u2019s too deep. I-I\u2019ll be all right.\u201d</p><p>He reached for her, pulling her against him and cradling her carefully. He\u2019d come too close to losing her. Too close.</p><p>A sudden scream shattered the silence.</p><p>Smith.</p><p>Colin looked up, found her standing in front of him, clad in her underwear, blood smearing her body. She had a gun in her hand, Emily\u2019s gun, and she was shaking and pointing it straight at him.</p><p>\u201cMonster! \u201d The cock of the hammer was too loud. \u201cI saw you change! You\u2019re like him, just like\u2014\u201d</p><p>The shock and the horror had gotten to her. She was going to fire, Colin realized. She was going to\u2014</p><p>Emily shoved him to the ground. Her soft body fell onto his, and he heard the whoosh of the bullet fly past them.</p><p>Sonofabitch. Why did every human try to shoot him when they found out what he was?</p><p>He carefully pushed Emily to the side. Scanned her body to make damn sure the bullet hadn\u2019t touched her. Then, satisfied but seriously pissed, Colin sprang to his feet. \u201cDammit, I saved your life!\u201d Didn\u2019t that count for anything? Or was he just another monster to her?</p><p>She stared up at him, mouth agape, gun still trembling in her fingers. Then her lips began to quiver. The gun fell to the floor and great, gulping sobs burst from within her.</p><p>Smith threw herself into his arms, pressing her wet face against his neck.</p><p>Humans.</p><p>Colin awkwardly stroked her back.</p><p>\u201cSmith.\u201d Emily\u2019s soft voice. \u201cHow badly are you hurt?\u201d</p><p>The ME lifted her face. Blinked. \u201cI-I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did he do to you?\u201d Colin asked, pitching his voice low. He didn\u2019t want to set her off again.</p><p>\u201cB-bit. Cl-clawed.\u201d A shudder of revulsion swept over her.</p><p>Emily pulled out her cell phone. Quickly dialed and then asked to speak with McNeal. Colin heard her tell the captain the killer had been contained and that they needed an ambulance, ASAP.</p><p>She disconnected the call and then looked back at Colin. Smith was still pressed against him, still crying, but softly now. Almost whimpering.</p><p>\u201cSmith, before the others arrive, we need to talk.\u201d Emily\u2019s voice was calm, soothing. The professional psychologist was back in place.</p><p>If he hadn\u2019t been there, he never would have known the lady had just come moments away from death.</p><p>That was his doc. Core of steel.</p><p>Being as gentle as possible, Colin pushed Smith back until he could look into her eyes. \u201cYou know what I am.\u201d And she\u2019d tried to kill him. So what is new?</p><p>She nodded. \u201cW-werewolf.\u201d</p><p>Not exactly, but close enough for the time being.</p><p>\u201cThere are many...beings out there like Colin,\u201d Emily told her. \u201cThey\u2019re the Other and they walk right beside humans in this world.\u201d</p><p>Smith shook her head, but Colin didn\u2019t think she was denying Emily\u2019s words.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t tell anyone about them, Smith. You can\u2019t say what you saw...what Colin is...what Jake was.\u201d Sirens echoed in the distance. The cops had been stationed close by. Not too close to alert the killer, but close enough for backup. \u201cI\u2019ll explain everything to you later, but please, promise me you won\u2019t say anything to the other officers. Th-they wouldn\u2019t understand.\u201d Emily cast a quick, desperate look in Colin\u2019s direction, but she kept her voice calm and easy.</p><p>A flash of blue lights lit up the warehouse.</p><p>\u201cSmith, I need you to give me your word,\u201d Colin said. \u201cDon\u2019t tell anyone what you saw here.\u201d</p><p>Brakes squealed. Doors slammed. Voices rumbled.</p><p>Smith\u2019s shoulders straightened and she looked at him with a touch of her old confidence. \u201cD-don\u2019t worry, Gyth...n-no one would b-believe me anyway...\u201d</p><p>McNeal burst into the building. \u201cSmith!\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t take her eyes off Colin. \u201cB-but now I know...m-monsters\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSmith, thank God!\u201d McNeal grabbed her, pulled her tight against his chest. \u201cWoman, I thought I\u2019d lost you.\u201d His face was tormented.</p><p>Colin glanced over at Emily. She was staring at Donnelley\u2019s body. He pushed to her side, needing to touch her.</p><p>His fingers found hers. Locked.</p><p>Jesus. He felt like he\u2019d just lost a good ten years of his life. Emily had come so close to death...by his hand.</p><p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t anything like him, you know,\u201d she whispered, her words barely a breath of sound. \u201cPeople think all wolf shifters are the same.\u201d</p><p>Psychotic. Homicidal. Uncontrollable.</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019re different.\u201d</p><p>He wasn\u2019t so sure. Donnelley lay before him, throat almost completely gone. He\u2019d killed him, just as easily as Donnelley had killed his victims. And given the same set of circumstances, he wouldn\u2019t hesitate to do it again.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not like him,\u201d she repeated softly, glancing up at him. \u201cYou could never be.\u201d</p><p>If something happened to her, he could be. The knowledge was there. Uncomfortable. Painful. But true. If anything ever happened to the doc, his beast would break his cage.</p><p>She is mine. Every instinct in his body screamed of the possession. He didn\u2019t understand how it had happened, but the doc...she was his mate.</p><p>A human, mated to a wolf shifter.</p><p>The Monster Doctor bound to a monster.</p><p>Fate could be a twisted bitch.</p><p>Emily stared up at him. Blood trickled down her throat.</p><p>Mine.</p><p>A circle of uniformed cops gaped down at Donnelley\u2019s body. \u201cAnother one?\u201d a young female officer exclaimed. \u201cBut I thought the Night Butcher was taken down\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was.\u201d Colin took Emily\u2019s arm. Led her away from the body. He wanted to get her home. Naked. Under him. Not necessarily in that order. \u201cThat\u2019s him.\u201d McNeal could bullshit his way through an explanation of the killer\u2019s torn throat. He was getting out of there and taking his mate with him.</p><p>She awoke to the feel of a man\u2019s hand slowly stroking her thigh. It was a soft touch. Light.</p><p>Colin.</p><p>Emily stretched slowly and opened her eyes. It was still dark in the bedroom, but the faint light from the hallway trickled into the room. Colin was crouched between her thighs, naked.</p><p>And aroused.</p><p>The paramedics had grabbed her when they\u2019d left the crime scene. They\u2019d patched her up, bandaged her stomach\u2014luckily, the cuts hadn\u2019t been deep enough to require stitches.</p><p>They\u2019d finally escaped from the EMTs, and Colin had taken her home.</p><p>They made love as soon as the front door closed behind them. Fast. Hard. He\u2019d had her naked in less than a minute, and she\u2019d been coming thirty seconds later.</p><p>For all of his strength, he\u2019d taken care not to jar her injuries. He\u2019d held her immobile against the wall, and thrust into her, deep, so deep.</p><p>They\u2019d fallen asleep in his bed. His arms had been around her. His right hand lying on her heart.</p><p>And now...</p><p>His finger trailed up her thigh, eased between the folds of her legs.</p><p>\u201cI want to taste you.\u201d His voice was a growl in the darkness.</p><p>Oh yes. Sounded like a fabulous plan to her. Emily arched her hips.</p><p>Then felt the warm stroke of his tongue on the center of her desire. She closed her eyes, sighing with pleasure. Oh, that is good.</p><p>So\u2014</p><p>His tongue swirled over her clitoris, sucked lightly.</p><p>Her heels dug into the mattress.</p><p>His breath blew across her flesh, and one finger slid into her hungry sex. Another slow swirl of his tongue.</p><p>Her entire body tightened. \u201cC-Colin!\u201d</p><p>He kept licking her, moving that tongue over every inch of her sex in long, maddening swipes that had her twisting, moaning, then\u2014</p><p>Colin drove his tongue deep inside of her.</p><p>Her fingers locked in his hair. Not to push him away, but to hold him closer. Tighter.</p><p>\u201cMore! \u201d She was close, so close.</p><p>His thumb pushed the button of her need and his tongue drove deep again, licking inside her core with just the perfect touch.</p><p>Her hips bucked and her orgasm rolled over her in a tide of red-hot pleasure. And as her sex clenched, he kept lapping her, licking and sucking on her tender flesh until the waves of her release finally ended.</p><p>Emily sagged against the bed. Wow.</p><p>Colin stretched out beside her. Curled his body around hers. She could feel his aroused flesh pressing into her buttocks, but he made no move to take her. \u201cColin, aren\u2019t you\u2014\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt was for you. Just you.\u201d He pressed a kiss to her neck, to the faint bruise on her skin. The mark not made by Jake\u2019s claws, but by Colin\u2019s mouth.</p><p>\u201cBut why don\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to take this time. I just wanted to give.\u201d</p> <p>And he\u2019d sure as hell done that. Given her so much pleasure that her body still tingled. Emily rolled to face him. Found his expression tense, guarded. \u201cI\u2019m not sure I understand you, shifter.\u201d Just when she thought she\u2019d figured him out, he managed to surprise her.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to understand me.\u201d A pause. \u201cBut...\u201d He stopped, jaw tightening.</p><p>Emily pushed out of his arms, sat up, uncaring of her nudity and the bandages that covered her stomach. \u201cWhat?\u201d Something was happening here. Something important. She could feel his tension. His...fear?</p><p>Why would Colin be afraid? Donnelley was dead. No more homicidal monsters were wandering the streets. The city was safe...for the moment. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think...you could ever love me?\u201d Stark words. And she saw the fear then. In his eyes, in the unguarded expression on his face.</p> <p>She touched his cheek. Smoothed her fingers down the side of his face.</p><p>Not a human. Not the simple, easygoing partner she would have chosen.</p><p>He carried a beast with him. A creature of enormous power.</p><p>Man and beast. Strength and danger.</p><p>Do you think...you could ever love me?</p><p>Being moments from death had made her realize a damn important fact. Her hand lifted, stroked his cheek. \u201cI already do, Colin. I already do.\u201d She kissed him, brushing her lips lightly across his. His hands curled around her and he pulled her close, holding her right against his pounding heart.</p> <p>Just where she wanted to be.</p><p>Safe...with her monster.</p><p>Epilogue</p><p>\u201cJake Donnelley, the perpetrator known as the Night Butcher, was killed last night when the woman he\u2019d kidnapped, Chief Medical Examiner Natalhia Smith, shot him in the throat.\u201d</p><p>A chorus of questions erupted at this news.</p><p>But McNeal just kept talking. \u201cEvidence links Jake Donnelley to the murders of Gillian Nemont, Preston Myers, and Darla Mitchell. We also have reason to suspect that he was behind the recent killing of four John Does...\u201d</p><p>The watch on Emily\u2019s arm vibrated. Glancing down, she saw that it was nearly time for her to meet up with her last appointment of the day. Marvin was scheduled to come in, and she was eager to see how the vampire fared.</p><p>She\u2019d snuck away from the office to catch the news conference. She\u2019d been curious about how McNeal would spin Jake\u2019s death.</p> <p>Shot in the throat. Nice touch.</p><p>Colin stood just behind McNeal. Brooks was at his side. Both were looking straight ahead, their attention on the crowd.</p><p>Time to go.</p><p>Emily stepped back, turned\u2014</p><p>And nearly walked into Smith.</p><p>The ME looked tired. Her eyes were bloodshot. Scratches covered her face and arms. But her chin was lifted high, and there was a determined expression on her face.</p><p>\u201cHow many of them...\u201d she muttered, her attention on the crowd of reporters, \u201care even human?\u201d</p><p>Emily glanced back at the group. \u201cAt least two-thirds.\u201d Once you know the truth, you can never stop suspecting.</p><p>Smith sucked in a sharp breath of surprise. \u201cYou see them, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>It would be too hard to explain how she could really recognize them all, so she just nodded.</p><p>\u201cDo...they scare you?\u201d</p><p>Niol\u2019s image flashed through her mind. \u201cSome of them do.\u201d She met Smith\u2019s stare. \u201cBut then, some humans scare the hell out of me too.\u201d</p><p>The ME nodded, understanding. \u201cIt\u2019s just...what am I supposed to do now? Now that I\u2014\u201d</p><p>Know.</p><p>\u201cKeep doing exactly what you\u2019ve been doing.\u201d Only now, maybe McNeal wouldn\u2019t have to come up with so many stories to explain certain anomalies Smith found with the bodies. \u201cEverything is just like it was before, you know.\u201d</p><p>Smith\u2019s dark gaze swept over the crowd. \u201cNo, it isn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe monsters were there before, you just didn\u2019t see them.\u201d But now she would\u2014she\u2019d notice every difference. Always wonder.</p><p>The blinders were off for Smith.</p><p>But still on for the rest of the world.</p><p>One day they\u2019d all realize. They\u2019d wake up, and they\u2019d all finally understand.</p><p>Monsters weren\u2019t just stories to frighten small children. Weren\u2019t just myths to whisper in the dark.</p><p>They were real.</p><p>And they were everywhere.</p><p>Emily reached into her purse, pulled out a small, white business card. She offered it to Smith. \u201cIf you ever want to talk about what happened, call me.\u201d Being nearly murdered by a creature straight out of a nightmare wouldn\u2019t be an easy thing to deal with, and if she could help Smith, she would. Even if the ME wasn\u2019t her usual type of client.</p><p>Smith\u2019s fingers curled around the card. \u201cThanks.\u201d She swallowed, then stepped away.</p><p>Emily watched her slow stride across the room. Smith had a long road to go, but the woman was a survivor. She\u2019d make it.</p><p>And she\u2019d learn to live with the monsters around her.</p><p>Emily\u2019s attention turned back to the swarm of reporters. The humans were leaning forward, a sort of greedy interest on their faces, but the Other, they hung back, as if realizing there were more details to this particular case that were best left uncovered.</p><p>Yes, one day the humans would turn around and realize they were surrounded by the Other.</p><p>But today, well, today wasn\u2019t going to be that day of dawning realization. Not today...</p><p>Her wrist alarm vibrated again.</p><p>Time to get back to work. She needed to chat with her vampire. See how his blood diet was going.</p><p>And after that...she turned her head slightly, met Colin\u2019s bright stare. Saw the hunger in his eyes.</p><p>After meeting the vampire, she had a date with a wolf.</p><p>Another busy night for the Monster Doctor. </p> </body></html>"]
