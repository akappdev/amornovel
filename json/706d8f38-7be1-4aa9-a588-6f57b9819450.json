I live with them daily, after all. When I look in a mirror, my mother\u2019s eyes look back at me; my mouth curls with the smile that lured my great-grandfather to the fate that was me.</p><p>No, how should I fear the touch of those vanished hands, laid on me in love unknowing? How could I be afraid of those that molded my flesh, leaving their remnants to live long past the grave?</p><p>Still less could I be afraid of those ghosts who touch my thoughts in passing. Any library is filled with them. I can take a book from dusty shelves, and be haunted by the thoughts of one long dead, still lively as ever in their winding sheet of words.</p> <p>Of course it isn\u2019t these homely and accustomed ghosts that trouble sleep and curdle wakefulness. Look back, hold a torch to light the recesses of the dark. Listen to the footsteps that echo behind, when you walk alone.</p><p>All the time the ghosts flit past and through us, hiding in the future. We look in the mirror and see the shades of other faces looking back through the years; we see the shape of memory, standing solid in an empty doorway. By blood and by choice, we make our ghosts; we haunt ourselves.</p><p>Each ghost comes unbidden from the misty grounds of dream and silence.</p><p>Our rational minds say, \u201cNo, it isn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>But another part, an older part, echoes always softly in the dark, \u201cYes, but it could be.\u201d</p> <p>We come and go from mystery and, in between, we try to forget. But a breeze passing in a still room stirs my hair now and then in soft affection. I think it is my mother.</p><p>PART ONE</p><p>O Brave New World</p><p>1</p><p>A HANGING IN EDEN</p><p>Charleston, June 1767</p> <p>I heard the drums long before they came in sight. The beating echoed in the pit of my stomach, as though I too were hollow. The sound traveled through the crowd, a harsh military rhythm meant to be heard over speech or gunfire. I saw heads turn as the people fell silent, looking up the stretch of East Bay Street, where it ran from the half-built skeleton of the new Customs House toward White Point Gardens.</p><p>It was a hot day, even for Charleston in June. The best places were on the seawall, where the air moved; here below, it was like being roasted alive. My shift was soaked through, and the cotton bodice clung between my br**sts. I wiped my face for the tenth time in as many minutes and lifted the heavy coil of my hair, hoping vainly for a cooling breeze upon my neck.</p><p>I was morbidly aware of necks at the moment. Unobtrusively, I put my hand up to the base of my throat, letting my fingers circle it. I could feel the pulse beat in my carotid arteries, along with the drums, and when I breathed, the hot wet air clogged my throat as though I were choking.</p><p>I quickly took my hand down, and drew in a breath as deep as I could manage. That was a mistake. The man in front of me hadn\u2019t bathed in a month or more; the edge of the stock about his thick neck was dark with grime and his clothes smelled sour and musty, pungent even amid the sweaty reek of the crowd. The smell of hot bread and frying pig fat from the food vendors\u2019 stalls lay heavy over a musk of rotting seagrass from the marsh, only slightly relieved by a whiff of salt-breeze from the harbor.</p><p>There were several children in front of me, craning and gawking, running out from under the oaks and palmettos to look up the street, being called back by anxious parents. The girl nearest me had a neck like the white part of a grass stalk, slender and succulent.</p><p>There was a ripple of excitement through the crowd; the gallows procession was in sight at the far end of the street. The drums grew louder.</p><p>\u201cWhere is he?\u201d Fergus muttered beside me, craning his own neck to see. \u201cI knew I should have gone with him!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll be here.\u201d I wanted to stand on tiptoe, but didn\u2019t, feeling that this would be undignified. I did glance around, though, searching. I could always spot Jamie in a crowd; he stood head and shoulders above most men, and his hair caught the light in a blaze of reddish gold. There was no sign of him yet, only a bobbing sea of bonnets and tricornes, sheltering from the heat those citizens come too late to find a place in the shade.</p> <p>The flags came first, fluttering above the heads of the excited crowd, the banners of Great Britain and of the Royal Colony of South Carolina. And another, bearing the family arms of the Lord Governor of the colony.</p><p>Then came the drummers, walking two by two in step, their sticks an alternate beat and blur. It was a slow march, grimly inexorable. A dead march, I thought they called that particular cadence; very suitable under the circumstances. All other noises were drowned by the rattle of the drums.</p><p>Then came the platoon of red-coated soldiers and in their midst, the prisoners.</p><p>There were three of them, hands bound before them, linked together by a chain that ran through rings on the iron collars about their necks. The first man was small and elderly, ragged and disreputable, a shambling wreck who lurched and staggered so that the dark-suited clergyman who walked beside the prisoners was obliged to grasp his arm to keep him from falling.</p><p>\u201cIs that Gavin Hayes? He looks sick,\u201d I murmured to Fergus.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s drunk.\u201d The soft voice came from behind me, and I whirled, to find Jamie standing at my shoulder, eyes fixed on the pitiful procession.</p><p>The small man\u2019s disequilibrium was disrupting the progress of the parade, as his stumbling forced the two men chained to him to zig and zag abruptly in order to keep their feet. The general impression was of three inebriates rolling home from the local tavern; grossly at odds with the solemnity of the occasion. I could hear the rustle of laughter over the drums, and shouts and jeers from the crowds on the wrought-iron balconies of the houses on East Bay Street.</p><p>\u201cYour doing?\u201d I spoke quietly, so as not to attract notice, but I could have shouted and waved my arms; no one had eyes for anything but the scene before us.</p><p>I felt rather than saw Jamie\u2019s shrug, as he moved forward to stand beside me.</p><p>\u201cIt was what he asked of me,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd the best I could manage for him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrandy or whisky?\u201d asked Fergus, evaluating Hayes\u2019 appearance with a practiced eye.</p><p>\u201cThe man\u2019s a Scot, wee Fergus.\u201d Jamie\u2019s voice was as calm as his face, but I heard the small note of strain in it. \u201cWhisky\u2019s what he wanted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA wise choice. With luck, he won\u2019t even notice when they hang him,\u201d Fergus muttered. The small man had slipped from the preacher\u2019s grasp and fallen flat on his face in the sandy road, pulling one of his companions to his knees; the last prisoner, a tall young man, stayed on his feet but swayed wildly from side to side, trying desperately to keep his balance. The crowd on the point roared with glee.</p><p>The captain of the guard glowed crimson between the white of his wig and the metal of his gorget, flushed with fury as much as with sun. He barked an order as the drums continued their somber roll, and a soldier scrambled hastily to remove the chain that bound the prisoners together. Hayes was jerked unceremoniously to his feet, a soldier grasping each arm, and the procession resumed, in better order.</p><p>There was no laughter by the time they reached the gallows\u2014a mule-drawn cart placed beneath the limbs of a huge live oak. I could feel the drums beating through the soles of my feet. I felt slightly sick from the sun and the smells. The drums stopped abruptly, and my ears rang in the silence.</p><p>\u201cYe dinna need to watch it, Sassenach,\u201d Jamie whispered to me. \u201cGo back to the wagon.\u201d His own eyes were fixed unblinkingly on Hayes, who swayed and mumbled in the soldiers\u2019 grasp, looking blearily around.</p><p>The last thing I wanted was to watch. But neither could I leave Jamie to see it through alone. He had come for Gavin Hayes; I had come for him. I touched his hand.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll stay.\u201d</p><p>Jamie drew himself straighter, squaring his shoulders. He moved a pace forward, making sure that he was visible in the crowd. If Hayes was still sober enough to see anything, the last thing he saw on earth would be the face of a friend.</p><p>He could see; Hayes glared to and fro as they lifted him into the cart, twisting his neck, desperately looking.</p><p>\u201cGabhainn! A charaid!\u201d Jamie shouted suddenly. Hayes\u2019 eyes found him at once, and he ceased struggling.</p><p>The little man stood swaying slightly as the charge was read: theft in the amount of six pounds, ten shillings. He was covered in reddish dust, and pearls of sweat clung trembling to the gray stubble of his beard. The preacher was leaning close, murmuring urgently in his ear.</p><p>Then the drums began again, in a steady roll. The hangman guided the noose over the balding head and fixed it tight, knot positioned precisely, just under the ear. The captain of the guard stood poised, saber raised.</p><p>Suddenly, the condemned man drew himself up straight. Eyes on Jamie, he opened his mouth, as though to speak.</p><p>The saber flashed in the morning sun, and the drums stopped, with a final thunk!</p><p>I looked at Jamie; he was white to the lips, eyes fixed wide. From the corner of my eye, I could see the twitching rope, and the faint, reflexive jerk of the dangling sack of clothes. A sharp stink of urine and feces struck through the thick air.</p><p>On my other side, Fergus watched dispassionately.</p><p>\u201cI suppose he noticed, after all,\u201d he murmured, with regret.</p><p>The body swung slightly, a dead weight oscillating like a plumb-bob on its string. There was a sigh from the crowd, of awe and release. Terns squawked from the burning sky, and the harbor sounds came faint and smothered through the heavy air, but the point was wrapped in silence. From where I stood, I could hear the small plit...plat...plit of the drops that fell from the toe of the corpse\u2019s dangling shoe.</p><p>I hadn\u2019t known Gavin Hayes, and felt no personal grief for his death, but I was glad it had been quick. I stole a glance at him, with an odd feeling of intrusion. It was a most public way of accomplishing a most private act, and I felt vaguely embarrassed to be looking.</p><p>The hangman had known his business; there had been no undignified struggle, no staring eyes, no protruding tongue; Gavin\u2019s small round head tilted sharply to the side, neck grotesquely stretched but cleanly broken.</p><p>It was a clean break in more ways than one. The captain of the guard, satisfied that Hayes was dead, motioned with his saber for the next man to be brought to the gibbet. I saw his eyes travel down the red-clad file, and then widen in outrage.</p><p>At the same moment, there was a cry from the crowd, and a ripple of excitement that quickly spread. Heads turned and people pushed each against his neighbor, striving to see where there was nothing to be seen.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s gone!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere he goes!\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop him!\u201d</p><p>It was the third prisoner, the tall young man, who had seized the moment of Gavin\u2019s death to run for his life, sliding past the guard who should have been watching him, but who had been unable to resist the gallows\u2019 fascination.</p><p>I saw a flicker of movement behind a vendor\u2019s stall, a flash of dirty blond hair. Some of the soldiers saw it, too, and ran in that direction, but many more were rushing in other directions, and among the collisions and confusion, nothing was accomplished.</p><p>The captain of the guard was shouting, face purple, his voice barely audible over the uproar. The remaining prisoner, looking stunned, was seized and hustled back in the direction of the Court of Guard as the redcoats began hastily to sort themselves back into order under the lash of their captain\u2019s voice. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Jamie snaked an arm around my waist and dragged me out of the way of an oncoming wave of humanity. The crowd fell back before the advance of squads of soldiers, who formed up and marched briskly off to quarter the area, under the grim and furious direction of their sergeant.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019d best find Ian,\u201d Jamie said, fending off a group of excited apprentices. He glanced at Fergus, and jerked his head toward the gibbet and its melancholy burden. \u201cClaim the body, aye? We\u2019ll meet at the Willow Tree later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think they\u2019ll catch him?\u201d I asked, as we pushed through the ebbing crowd, threading our way down a cobbled lane toward the merchants\u2019 wharves.</p><p>\u201cI expect so. Where can he go?\u201d He spoke abstractedly, a narrow line visible between his brows. Plainly the dead man was still on his mind, and he had little attention to spare for the living.</p> <p>\u201cDid Hayes have any family?\u201d I asked. He shook his head.</p><p>\u201cI asked him that, when I brought him the whisky. He thought he might have a brother left alive, but no notion where. The brother was transported soon after the Rising\u2014to Virginia, Hayes thought, but he\u2019d heard nothing since.\u201d</p><p>Not surprising if he hadn\u2019t; an indentured laborer would have had no facilities for communicating with kin left behind in Scotland, unless the bondsman\u2019s employer was kind enough to send a letter on his behalf. And kind or not, it was unlikely that a letter would have found Gavin Hayes, who had spent ten years in Ardsmuir prison before being transported in his turn.</p><p>\u201cDuncan!\u201d Jamie called out, and a tall, thin man turned and raised a hand in acknowledgment. He made his way through the crowd in a corkscrew fashion, his single arm swinging in a wide arc that fended off the passersby.</p><p>\u201cMac Dubh,\u201d he said, bobbing his head in greeting to Jamie. \u201cMrs. Claire.\u201d His long, narrow face was furrowed with sadness. He too had once been a prisoner at Ardsmuir, with Hayes and with Jamie. Only the loss of his arm to a blood infection had prevented his being transported with the others. Unfit to be sold for labor, he had instead been pardoned and set free to starve\u2014until Jamie had found him.</p> <p>\u201cGod rest poor Gavin,\u201d Duncan said, shaking his head dolorously.</p><p>Jamie muttered something in response in Gaelic, and crossed himself. Then he straightened, casting off the oppression of the day with a visible effort.</p><p>\u201cAye, well. I must go to the docks and arrange about Ian\u2019s passage, and then we\u2019ll think of burying Gavin. But I must have the lad settled first.\u201d</p><p>We struggled through the crowd toward the docks, squeezing our way between knots of excited gossipers, eluding the drays and barrows that came and went through the press with the ponderous indifference of trade.</p><p>A file of red-coated soldiers came at the quick-march from the other end of the quay, splitting the crowd like vinegar dropped on mayonnaise. The sun glittered hot on the line of bayonet points and the rhythm of their tramping beat through the noise of the crowd like a muffled drum. Even the rumbling sledges and handcarts stopped abruptly to let them pass by.</p><p>\u201cMind your pocket, Sassenach,\u201d Jamie murmured in my ear, ushering me through a narrow space between a turban-clad slave clutching two small children and a street preacher perched on a box. He was shouting sin and repentance, but with only one word in three audible through the noise.</p> <p>\u201cI sewed it shut,\u201d I assured him, nonetheless reaching to touch the small weight that swung against my thigh. \u201cWhat about yours?\u201d</p><p>He grinned and tilted his hat forward, dark blue eyes narrowing against the bright sunlight.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s where my sporran would be, did I have one. So long as I dinna meet with a quick-fingered harlot, I\u2019m safe.\u201d</p><p>I glanced at the slightly bulging front of his breeches, and then up at him. Broad-shouldered and tall, with bold, clean features and a Highlander\u2019s proud carriage, he drew the glance of every woman he passed, even with his bright hair covered by a sober blue tricorne. The breeches, which were borrowed, were substantially too tight, and did nothing whatever to detract from the general effect\u2014an effect enhanced by the fact that he himself was totally ignorant of it.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a walking inducement to harlots,\u201d I said. \u201cStick by me; I\u2019ll protect you.\u201d</p><p>He laughed and took my arm as we emerged into a small clear space.</p><p>\u201cIan!\u201d he shouted, catching sight of his nephew over the heads of the crowd. A moment later, a tall, stringy gawk of a boy popped out of the crowd, pushing a thatch of brown hair out of his eyes and grinning widely.</p><p>\u201cI thought I should never find ye, Uncle!\u201d he exclaimed. \u201cChrist, there are more folk here than at the Lawnmarket in Edinburgh!\u201d He wiped a coat sleeve across his long, half-homely face, leaving a streak of grime down one cheek.</p> <p>Jamie eyed his nephew askance.</p><p>\u201cYe\u2019re lookin\u2019 indecently cheerful, Ian, for having just seen a man go to his death.\u201d</p><p>Ian hastily altered his expression into an attempt at decent solemnity.</p><p>\u201cOh, no, Uncle Jamie,\u201d he said. \u201cI didna see the hanging.\u201d Duncan raised one brow and Ian blushed slightly. \u201cI\u2014I wasna afraid to see; it was only I had...something else I wanted to do.\u201d</p><p>Jamie smiled slightly and patted his nephew on the back.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t trouble yourself, Ian; I\u2019d as soon not have seen it myself, only that Gavin was a friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, Uncle. I\u2019m sorry for it.\u201d A flash of sympathy showed in the boy\u2019s large brown eyes, the only feature of his face with any claim to beauty. He glanced at me. \u201cWas it awful, Auntie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I said. \u201cIt\u2019s over, though.\u201d I pulled the damp handkerchief out of my bosom and stood on tiptoe to rub away the smudge on his cheek.</p><p>Duncan Innes shook his head sorrowfully. \u201cAye, poor Gavin. Still, it\u2019s a quicker death than starving, and there was little left for him but that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d Jamie interrupted, unwilling to spend time in useless lamenting. \u201cThe Bonnie Mary should be near the far end of the quay.\u201d I saw Ian glance at Jamie and draw himself up as though about to speak, but Jamie had already turned toward the harbor and was shoving his way through the crowd. Ian glanced at me, shrugged, and offered me an arm.</p><p>We followed Jamie behind the warehouses that lined the docks, side-stepping sailors, loaders, slaves, passengers, customers and merchants of all sorts. Charleston was a major shipping port, and business was booming, with as many as a hundred ships a month coming and going from Europe in the season.</p><p>The Bonnie Mary belonged to a friend of Jamie\u2019s cousin Jared Fraser, who had gone to France to make his fortune in the wine business and succeeded brilliantly. With luck, the Bonnie Mary\u2019s captain might be persuaded for Jared\u2019s sake to take Ian with him back to Edinburgh, allowing the boy to work his passage as a cabin lad.</p><p>Ian was not enthused at the prospect, but Jamie was determined to ship his errant nephew back to Scotland at the earliest opportunity. It was\u2014among other concerns\u2014news of the Bonnie Mary\u2019s presence in Charleston that had brought us here from Georgia, where we had first set foot in America\u2014by accident\u2014two months before.</p><p>As we passed a tavern, a slatternly barmaid came out with a bowl of slops. She caught sight of Jamie and stood, bowl braced against her hip, giving him a slanted brow and a pouting smile. He passed without a glance, intent on his goal. She tossed her head, flung the slops to the pig who slept by the step, and flounced back inside.</p><p>He paused, shading his eyes to look down the row of towering ships\u2019 masts, and I came up beside him. He twitched unconsciously at the front of his breeches, easing the fit, and I took his arm.</p><p>\u201cFamily jewels still safe, are they?\u201d I murmured.</p><p>\u201cUncomfortable, but safe,\u201d he assured me. He plucked at the lacing of his flies, grimacing. \u201cI would ha\u2019 done better to hide them up my bum, I think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBetter you than me, mate,\u201d I said, smiling. \u201cI\u2019d rather risk robbery, myself.\u201d</p><p>The family jewels were just that. We had been driven ashore on the coast of Georgia by a hurricane, arriving soaked, ragged, and destitute\u2014save for a handful of large and valuable gemstones.</p><p>I hoped the captain of the Bonnie Mary thought highly enough of Jared Fraser to accept Ian as a cabin boy, because if not, we were going to have a spot of difficulty about the passage.</p><p>In theory, Jamie\u2019s pouch and my pocket contained a sizable fortune. In practice, the stones might have been beach pebbles so far as the good they were to us. While gems were an easy, compact way of transporting wealth, the problem was changing them back into money.</p><p>Most trade in the southern colonies was conducted by means of barter\u2014what wasn\u2019t, was handled by the exchange of scrip or bills written on a wealthy merchant or banker. And wealthy bankers were thin on the ground in Georgia; those willing to tie up their available capital in gemstones rarer still. The prosperous rice farmer with whom we had stayed in Savannah had assured us that he himself could scarcely lay his hand on two pounds sterling in cash\u2014indeed, there was likely not ten pounds in gold and silver to be had in the whole colony.</p><p>Nor was there any chance of selling one of the stones in the endless stretches of salt marsh and pine forest through which we had passed on our journey north. Charleston was the first city we had reached of sufficient size to harbor merchants and bankers who might help to liquidate a portion of our frozen assets.</p><p>Not that anything was likely to stay frozen long in Charleston in summer, I reflected. Rivulets of sweat were running down my neck and the linen shift under my bodice was soaked and crumpled against my skin. Even so close to the harbor, there was no wind at this time of day, and the smells of hot tar, dead fish, and sweating laborers were nearly overwhelming.</p><p>Despite their protestations, Jamie had insisted on giving one of our gemstones to Mr. and Mrs. Olivier, the kindly people who had taken us in when we were shipwrecked virtually on their doorstep, as some token of thanks for their hospitality. In return, they had provided us with a wagon, two horses, fresh clothes for traveling, food for the journey north, and a small amount of money.</p><p>Of this, six shillings and threepence remained in my pocket, constituting the entirety of our disposable fortune.</p><p>\u201cThis way, Uncle Jamie,\u201d Ian said, turning and beckoning his uncle eagerly. \u201cI\u2019ve got something to show ye.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Jamie asked, threading his way through a throng of sweating slaves, who were loading dusty bricks of dried indigo into an anchored cargo ship. \u201cAnd how did ye get whatever it is? Ye havena got any money, have you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I won it, dicing.\u201d Ian\u2019s voice floated back, his body invisible as he skipped around a cartload of corn.</p><p>\u201cDicing! Ian, for God\u2019s sake, ye canna be gambling when ye\u2019ve not a penny to bless yourself with!\u201d Holding my arm, Jamie shoved a way through the crowd to catch up to his nephew.</p><p>\u201cYou do it all the time, Uncle Jamie,\u201d the boy pointed out, pausing to wait for us. \u201cYe\u2019ve been doing it in every tavern and inn where we\u2019ve stayed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy God, Ian, that\u2019s cards, not dice! And I know what I\u2019m doing!\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSo do I,\u201d said Ian, looking smug. \u201cI won, no?\u201d</p><p>Jamie rolled his eyes toward heaven, imploring patience.</p><p>\u201cJesus, Ian, but I\u2019m glad you\u2019re going home before ye get your head beaten in. Promise me ye willna be gambling wi\u2019 the sailors, aye? Ye canna get away from them on a ship.\u201d</p><p>Ian was paying no attention; he had come to a half-crumbled piling, around which was tied a stout rope. Here he stopped and turned to face us, gesturing at an object by his feet.</p> <p>\u201cSee? It\u2019s a dog,\u201d Ian said proudly.</p><p>I took a quick half-step behind Jamie, grabbing his arm.</p><p>\u201cIan,\u201d I said, \u201cthat is not a dog. It\u2019s a wolf. It\u2019s a bloody big wolf, and I think you ought to get away from it before it takes a bite out of your arse.\u201d</p><p>The wolf twitched one ear negligently in my direction, dismissed me, and twitched it back. It continued to sit, panting with the heat, its big yellow eyes fixed on Ian with an intensity that might have been taken for devotion by someone who hadn\u2019t met a wolf before. I had.</p><p>\u201cThose things are dangerous,\u201d I said. \u201cThey\u2019d bite you as soon as look at you.\u201d</p> <p>Disregarding this, Jamie stooped to inspect the beast.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not quite a wolf, is it?\u201d Sounding interested, he held out a loose fist to the so-called dog, inviting it to smell his knuckles. I closed my eyes, expecting the imminent amputation of his hand. Hearing no shrieks, I opened them again to find him squatting on the ground, peering up the animal\u2019s nostrils.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a handsome creature, Ian,\u201d he said, scratching the thing familiarly under the chin. The yellow eyes narrowed slightly, either in pleasure at the attention or\u2014more likely, I thought\u2014in anticipation of biting off Jamie\u2019s nose. \u201cBigger than a wolf, though; it\u2019s broader through the head and chest, and a deal longer in the leg.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis mother was an Irish wolfhound,\u201d Ian was hunkered down by Jamie, eagerly explaining as he stroked the enormous gray-brown back. \u201cShe got out in heat, into the woods, and when she came back in whelp\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, aye, I see.\u201d Now Jamie was crooning in Gaelic to the monster while he picked up its huge foot and fondled its hairy toes. The curved black claws were a good two inches long. The thing half closed its eyes, the faint breeze ruffling the thick fur at its neck.</p><p>I glanced at Duncan, who arched his eyebrows at me, shrugged slightly, and sighed. Duncan didn\u2019t care for dogs.</p> <p>\u201cJamie\u2014\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cBalach Boidheach,\u201d Jamie said to the wolf. \u201cAre ye no the bonny laddie, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat would he eat?\u201d I asked, somewhat more loudly than necessary.</p><p>Jamie stopped caressing the beast.</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d he said. He looked at the yellow-eyed thing with some regret. \u201cWell.\u201d He rose to his feet, shaking his head reluctantly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid your auntie\u2019s right, Ian. How are we to feed him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, that\u2019s no trouble, Uncle Jamie,\u201d Ian assured him. \u201cHe hunts for himself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere?\u201d I glanced around at the warehouses, and the stuccoed row of shops beyond. \u201cWhat does he hunt, small children?\u201d</p> <p>Ian looked mildly hurt.</p><p>\u201cOf course not, Auntie. Fish.\u201d</p><p>Seeing three skeptical faces surrounding him, Ian dropped to his knees and grabbed the beast\u2019s muzzle in both hands, prying his mouth open.</p><p>\u201cHe does! I swear, Uncle Jamie! Here, just smell his breath!\u201d</p><p>Jamie cast a dubious glance at the double row of impressively gleaming fangs on display, and rubbed his chin.</p><p>\u201cI\u2014ah, I shall take your word for it, Ian. But even so\u2014for Christ\u2019s sake, be careful of your fingers, lad!\u201d Ian\u2019s grip had loosened, and the massive jaws clashed shut, spraying droplets of saliva over the stone quay.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m all right, Uncle,\u201d Ian said cheerfully, wiping his hand on his breeks. \u201cHe wouldn\u2019t bite me, I\u2019m sure. His name is Rollo.\u201d</p><p>Jamie rubbed his knuckles across his upper lip.</p><p>\u201cMmphm. Well, whatever his name is, and whatever he eats, I dinna think the captain of the Bonnie Mary will take kindly to his presence in the crew\u2019s quarters.\u201d</p><p>Ian didn\u2019t say anything, but the look of happiness on his face didn\u2019t diminish. In fact, it grew. Jamie glanced at him, caught sight of his glowing face, and stiffened.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said, in horror. \u201cOh, no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d said Ian. A wide smile of delight split his bony face. \u201cShe sailed three days ago, Uncle. We\u2019re too late.\u201d</p><p>Jamie said something in Gaelic that I didn\u2019t understand. Duncan looked scandalized.</p><p>\u201cDamn!\u201d Jamie said, reverting to English. \u201cBloody damn!\u201d Jamie took off his hat and rubbed a hand over his face, hard. He looked hot, disheveled, and thoroughly disgruntled. He opened his mouth, thought better of whatever he had been going to say, closed it, and ran his fingers roughly through his hair, jerking loose the ribbon that tied it back.</p><p>Ian looked abashed.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Uncle. I\u2019ll try not to be a worry to ye, truly I will. And I can work; I\u2019ll earn enough for my food.\u201d</p><p>Jamie\u2019s face softened as he looked at his nephew. He sighed deeply, and patted Ian\u2019s shoulder.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that I dinna want ye, Ian. You know I should like nothing better than to keep ye with me. But what in hell will your mother say?\u201d</p><p>The glow returned to Ian\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cI dinna ken, Uncle,\u201d he said, \u201cbut she\u2019ll be saying it in Scotland, won\u2019t she? And we\u2019re here.\u201d He put his arms around Rollo and hugged him. The wolf seemed mildly taken aback by the gesture, but after a moment, put out a long pink tongue and daintily licked Ian\u2019s ear. Testing him for flavor, I thought cynically.</p><p>\u201cBesides,\u201d the boy added, \u201cshe kens well enough that I\u2019m safe; you wrote from Georgia to say I was with you.\u201d</p><p>Jamie summoned a wry smile.</p><p>\u201cI canna say that that particular bit of knowledge will be ower-comforting to her, Ian. She\u2019s known me a long time, aye?\u201d</p><p>He sighed and clapped the hat back on his head, and turned to me.</p><p>\u201cI badly need a drink, Sassenach,\u201d he said. \u201cLet\u2019s find that tavern.\u201d</p><p>The Willow Tree was dark, and might have been cool, had there been fewer people in it. As it was, the benches and tables were crowded with sightseers from the hanging and sailors from the docks, and the atmosphere was like a sweatbath. I inhaled as I stepped into the taproom, then let my breath out, fast. It was like breathing through a wad of soiled laundry, soaked in beer.</p><p>Rollo at once proved his worth, parting the crowd like the Red Sea as he stalked through the taproom, lips drawn back from his teeth in a constant, inaudible growl. He was evidently no stranger to taverns. Having satisfactorily cleared out a corner bench, he curled up under the table and appeared to go to sleep.</p><p>Out of the sun, with a large pewter mug of dark ale foaming gently in front of him, Jamie quickly regained his normal self-possession.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve the two choices,\u201d he said, brushing back the sweat-soaked hair from his temples. \u201cWe can stay in Charleston long enough to maybe find a buyer for one of the stones, and perhaps book passage for Ian to Scotland on another ship. Or we can make our way north to Cape Fear, and maybe find a ship for him out of Wilmington or New Bern.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI say north,\u201d Duncan said, without hesitation. \u201cYe\u2019ve kin in Cape Fear, no? I mislike the thought of staying ower-long among strangers. And your kinsman would see we were not cheated nor robbed. Here\u2014\u201d He lifted one shoulder in eloquent indication of the un-Scottish\u2014and thus patently dishonest\u2014persons surrounding us.</p><p>\u201cOh, do let\u2019s go north, Uncle!\u201d Ian said quickly, before Jamie could reply to this. He wiped away a small mustache of ale foam with his sleeve. \u201cThe journey might be dangerous; you\u2019ll need an extra man along for protection, aye?\u201d</p><p>Jamie buried his expression in his own cup, but I was seated close enough to feel a subterranean quiver go through him. Jamie was indeed very fond of his nephew. The fact remained that Ian was the sort of person to whom things happened. Usually through no fault of his own, but still, they happened.</p><p>The boy had been kidnapped by pirates the year before, and it was the necessity of rescuing him that had brought us by circuitous and often dangerous means to America. Nothing had happened recently, but I knew Jamie was anxious to get his fifteen-year-old nephew back to Scotland and his mother before something did.</p><p>\u201cAh...to be sure, Ian,\u201d Jamie said, lowering his cup. He carefully avoided meeting my gaze, but I could see the corner of his mouth twitching. \u201cYe\u2019d be a great help, I\u2019m sure, but...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe might meet with Red Indians!\u201d Ian said, eyes wide. His face, already a rosy brown from the sun, glowed with a flush of pleasurable anticipation. \u201cOr wild beasts! Dr. Stern told me that the wilderness of Carolina is alive wi\u2019 fierce creatures\u2014bears and wildcats and wicked panthers\u2014and a great foul thing the Indians call a skunk!\u201d</p><p>I choked on my ale.</p><p>\u201cAre ye all right, Auntie?\u201d Ian leaned anxiously across the table.</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d I wheezed, wiping my streaming face with my kerchief. I blotted the drops of spilled ale off my bosom, pulling the fabric of my bodice discreetly away from my flesh in hopes of admitting a little air.</p><p>Then I caught a glimpse of Jamie\u2019s face, on which the expression of suppressed amusement had given way to a small frown of concern.</p><p>\u201cSkunks aren\u2019t dangerous,\u201d I murmured, laying a hand on his knee. A skilled and fearless hunter in his native Highlands, Jamie was inclined to regard the unfamiliar fauna of the New World with caution.</p><p>\u201cMmphm.\u201d The frown eased, but a narrow line remained between his brows. \u201cMaybe so, but what of the other things? I canna say I wish to be meeting a bear or a pack o\u2019 savages, wi\u2019 only this to hand.\u201d He touched the large sheathed knife that hung from his belt.</p><p>Our lack of weapons had worried Jamie considerably on the trip from Georgia, and Ian\u2019s remarks about Indians and wild animals had brought the concern to the forefront of his mind once more. Besides Jamie\u2019s knife, Fergus bore a smaller blade, suitable for cutting rope and trimming twigs for kindling. That was the full extent of our armory\u2014the Oliviers had had neither guns nor swords to spare.</p><p>On the journey from Georgia to Charleston, we had had the company of a group of rice and indigo farmers\u2014all bristling with knives, pistols, and muskets\u2014bringing their produce to the port to be shipped north to Pennsylvania and New York. If we left for Cape Fear now, we would be alone, unarmed, and essentially defenseless against anything that might emerge from the thick forests.</p><p>At the same time, there were pressing reasons to travel north, our lack of available capital being one. Cape Fear was the largest settlement of Scottish Highlanders in the American Colonies, boasting several towns whose inhabitants had emigrated from Scotland during the last twenty years, following the upheaval after Culloden. And among these emigrants were Jamie\u2019s kin, who I knew would willingly offer us refuge: a roof, a bed, and time to establish ourselves in this new world. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Jamie took another drink and nodded at Duncan.</p><p>\u201cI must say I\u2019m of your mind, Duncan.\u201d He leaned back against the wall of the tavern, glancing casually around the crowded room. \u201cD\u2019ye no feel the eyes on your back?\u201d</p><p>A chill ran down my own back, despite the trickle of sweat doing likewise. Duncan\u2019s eyes widened fractionally, then narrowed, but he didn\u2019t turn around.</p><p>\u201cAh,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cWhose eyes?\u201d I asked, looking rather nervously around. I didn\u2019t see anyone taking particular notice of us, though anyone might be watching surreptitiously; the tavern was seething with alcohol-soaked humanity, and the babble of voices was loud enough to drown out all but the closest conversation.</p><p>\u201cAnyone\u2019s, Sassenach,\u201d Jamie answered. He glanced sideways at me, and smiled. \u201cDinna look so scairt about it, aye? We\u2019re in no danger. Not here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet,\u201d Innes said. He leaned forward to pour another cup of ale. \u201cMac Dubh called out to Gavin on the gallows, d\u2019ye see? There will be those who took notice\u2014Mac Dubh bein\u2019 the bittie wee fellow he is,\u201d he added dryly.</p><p>\u201cAnd the farmers who came with us from Georgia will have sold their stores by now, and be takin\u2019 their ease in places like this,\u201d Jamie said, evidently absorbed in studying the pattern of his cup. \u201cAll of them are honest men\u2014but they\u2019ll talk, Sassenach. It makes a good story, no? The folk cast away by the hurricane? And what are the chances that at least one of them kens a bit about what we carry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see,\u201d I murmured, and did. We had attracted public interest by our association with a criminal, and could no longer pass as inconspicuous travelers. If finding a buyer took some time, as was likely, we risked inviting robbery from unscrupulous persons, or scrutiny from the English authorities. Neither pros-pect was appealing.</p> <p>Jamie lifted his cup and drank deeply, then set it down with a sigh.</p><p>\u201cNo. I think it\u2019s perhaps not wise to linger in the city. We\u2019ll see Gavin buried decently, and then we\u2019ll find a safe spot in the woods outside the town to sleep. Tomorrow we can decide whether to stay or go.\u201d</p><p>The thought of spending several more nights in the woods\u2014with or without skunks\u2014was not appealing. I hadn\u2019t taken my dress off in eight days, merely rinsing the outlying portions of my anatomy whenever we paused in the vicinity of a stream.</p><p>I had been looking forward to a real bed, even if flea-infested, and a chance to scrub off the grime of the last week\u2019s travel. Still, he had a point. I sighed, ruefully eyeing the hem of my sleeve, gray and grubby with wear.</p><p>The tavern door flung suddenly open at this point, distracting me from my contemplation, and four red-coated soldiers shoved their way into the crowded room. They wore full uniform, held muskets with bayonets fixed, and were obviously not in pursuit of ale or dice.</p><p>Two of the soldiers made a rapid circuit of the room, glancing under tables, while another disappeared into the kitchen beyond. The fourth remained on watch by the door, pale eyes flicking over the crowd. His gaze lighted on our table, and rested on us for a moment, full of speculation, but then passed on, restlessly seeking.</p> <p>Jamie was outwardly tranquil, sipping his ale in apparent obliviousness, but I saw the hand in his lap clench slowly into a fist. Duncan, less able to control his feelings, bent his head to hide his expression. Neither man would ever feel at ease in the presence of a red coat, and for good reason.</p><p>No one else appeared much perturbed by the soldiers\u2019 presence. The little knot of singers in the chimney corner went on with an interminable version of \u201cFill Every Glass,\u201d and a loud argument broke out between the barmaid and a pair of apprentices.</p><p>The soldier returned from the kitchen, having evidently found nothing. Stepping rudely through a dice game on the hearth, he rejoined his fellows by the door. As the soldiers shoved their way out of the tavern, Fergus\u2019s slight figure squeezed in, pressing against the doorjamb to avoid swinging elbows and musket butts.</p><p>I saw one soldier\u2019s eyes catch the glint of metal and fasten with interest on the hook Fergus wore in replacement of his missing left hand. He glanced sharply at Fergus, but then shouldered his musket and hurried after his companions.</p><p>Fergus shoved through the crowd and plopped down on the bench beside Ian. He looked hot and irritated.</p><p>\u201cBlood-sucking salaud,\u201d he said, without preamble.</p><p>Jamie\u2019s brows went up.</p><p>\u201cThe priest,\u201d Fergus elaborated. He took the mug Ian pushed in his direction and drained it, lean throat glugging until the cup was empty. He lowered it, exhaled heavily, and sat blinking, looking noticeably happier. He sighed and wiped his mouth.</p> <p>\u201cHe wants ten shillings to bury the man in the churchyard,\u201d he said. \u201cAn Anglican church, of course; there are no Catholic churches here. Wretched usurer! He knows we have no choice about it. The body will scarcely keep till sunset, as it is.\u201d He ran a finger inside his stock, pulling the sweat-wilted cotton away from his neck, then banged his fist several times on the table to attract the attention of the serving maid, who was being run off her feet by the press of patrons.</p><p>\u201cI told the super-fatted son of a pig that you would decide whether to pay or not. We could just bury him in the wood, after all. Though we should have to purchase a shovel,\u201d he added, frowning. \u201cThese grasping townsfolk know we are strangers; they\u2019ll take our last coin if they can.\u201d</p><p>Last coin was perilously close to the truth. I had enough to pay for a decent meal here and to buy food for the journey north; perhaps enough to pay for a couple of nights\u2019 lodging. That was all. I saw Jamie\u2019s eyes flick round the room, assessing the possibilities of picking up a little money at hazard or loo.</p><p>Soldiers and sailors were the best prospects for gambling, but there were few of either in the taproom\u2014likely most of the garrison was still searching the town for the fugitive. In one corner, a small group of men was being loudly convivial over several pitchers of brandywine; two of them were singing, or trying to, their attempts causing great hilarity among their comrades. Jamie gave an almost imperceptible nod at sight of them, and turned back to Fergus.</p><p>\u201cWhat have ye done with Gavin for the time being?\u201d Jamie asked. Fergus hunched one shoulder.</p><p>\u201cPut him in the wagon. I traded the clothes he was wearing to a ragwoman for a shroud, and she agreed to wash the body as part of the bargain.\u201d He gave Jamie a faint smile. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, milord; he\u2019s seemly. For now,\u201d he added, lifting the fresh mug of ale to his lips.</p><p>\u201cPoor Gavin.\u201d Duncan Innes lifted his own mug in a half salute to his fallen comrade.</p><p>\u201cSl\u00e0inte,\u201d Jamie replied, and lifted his own mug in reply. He set it down and sighed.</p><p>\u201cHe wouldna like being buried in the wood,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d I asked, curious. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t think it would matter to him one way or the other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no, we couldna do that, Mrs. Claire.\u201d Duncan was shaking his head emphatically. Duncan was normally a most reserved man, and I was surprised at so much apparent feeling.</p><p>\u201cHe was afraid of the dark,\u201d Jamie said softly. I turned to stare at him, and he gave me a lopsided smile. \u201cI lived wi\u2019 Gavin Hayes nearly as long as I\u2019ve lived with you, Sassenach\u2014and in much closer quarters. I kent him well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, he was afraid of being alone in the dark,\u201d Duncan chimed in. \u201cHe was most mortally scairt of tannagach\u2014of spirits, aye?\u201d</p><p>His long, mournful face bore an inward look, and I knew he was seeing in memory the prison cell that he and Jamie had shared with Gavin Hayes\u2014and with forty other men\u2014for three long years. \u201cD\u2019ye recall, Mac Dubh, how he told us one night of the tannasq he met?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do, Duncan, and could wish I did not.\u201d Jamie shuddered despite the heat. \u201cI kept awake myself half the night after he told us that one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat was it, Uncle?\u201d Ian was leaning over his cup of ale, round-eyed. His cheeks were flushed and streaming, and his stock crumpled with sweat.</p><p>Jamie rubbed a hand across his mouth, thinking.</p><p>\u201cAh. Well, it was a time in the late, cold autumn in the Highlands, just when the season turns, and the feel of the air tells ye the ground will be shivered wi\u2019 frost come dawn,\u201d he said. He settled himself in his seat and sat back, alecup in hand. He smiled wryly, plucking at his own throat. \u201cNot like now, aye?</p><p>\u201cWell, Gavin\u2019s son brought back the kine that night, but there was one beast missing\u2014the lad had hunted up the hills and down the corries, but couldna find it anywhere. So Gavin set the lad to milk the two others, and set out himself to look for the lost cow.\u201d</p><p>He rolled the pewter cup slowly between his hands, staring down into the dark ale as though seeing in it the bulk of the night-black Scottish peaks and the mist that floats in the autumn glens.</p><p>\u201cHe went some distance, and the cot behind him disappeared. When he looked back, he couldna see the light from the window anymore, and there was no sound but the keening of the wind. It was cold, but he went on, tramping through the mud and the heather, hearing the crackle of ice under his boots.</p><p>\u201cHe saw a small grove through the mist, and thinking the cow might have taken shelter beneath the trees, he went toward it. He said the trees were birches, standing there all leafless, but with their branches grown together so he must bend his head to squeeze beneath the boughs.</p><p>\u201cHe came into the grove and saw it was not a grove at all, but a circle of trees. There were great tall trees, spaced verra evenly, all around him, and smaller ones, saplings, grown up between to make a wall of branches. And in the center of the circle stood a cairn.\u201d</p><p>Hot as it was in the tavern, I felt as though a sliver of ice had slid melting down my spine. I had seen ancient cairns in the Highlands myself, and found them eerie enough in the broad light of day.</p><p>Jamie took a sip of ale, and wiped away a trickle of sweat that ran down his temple.</p><p>\u201cHe felt quite queer, did Gavin. For he kent the place\u2014everyone did, and kept well away from it. It was a strange place. And it seemed even worse in the dark and the cold, from what it did in the light of day. It was an auld cairn, the kind laid wi\u2019 slabs of rock, all heaped round with stones, and he could see before him the black opening of the tomb.</p><p>\u201cHe knew it was a place no man should come, and he without a powerful charm. Gavin had naught but a wooden cross about his neck. So he crossed himself with it and turned to go.\u201d</p><p>Jamie paused to sip his ale.</p><p>\u201cBut as Gavin went from the grove,\u201d he said softly, \u201che heard footsteps behind him.\u201d</p><p>I saw the Adam\u2019s apple bob in Ian\u2019s throat as he swallowed. He reached mechanically for his own cup, eyes fixed on his uncle.</p><p>\u201cHe didna turn to see,\u201d Jamie went on, \u201cbut kept walking. And the steps kept pace wi\u2019 him, step by step, always following. And he came through the peat where the water seeps up, and it was crusted with ice, the weather bein\u2019 so cold. He could hear the peat crackle under his feet, and behind him the crack! crack! of breaking ice.</p><p>\u201cHe walked and he walked, through the cold, dark night, watching ahead for the light of his own window, where his wife had set the candle. But the light never showed, and he began to fear he had lost his way among the heather and the dark hills. And all the time, the steps kept pace with him, loud in his ears. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAt last he could bear it no more, and seizing hold of the crucifix he wore round his neck, he swung about wi\u2019 a great cry to face whatever followed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did he see?\u201d Ian\u2019s pupils were dilated, dark with drink and wonder. Jamie glanced at the boy, and then at Duncan, nodding at him to take up the story.</p><p>\u201cHe said it was a figure like a man, but with no body,\u201d Duncan said quietly. \u201cAll white, like as it might have been made of the mist. But wi\u2019 great holes where its eyes should be, and empty black, fit to draw the soul from his body with dread.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut Gavin held up his cross before his face, and he prayed aloud to the Blessed Virgin.\u201d Jamie took up the story, leaning forward intently, the dim firelight outlining his profile in gold. \u201cAnd the thing came no nearer, but stayed there, watching him.</p> <p>\u201cAnd so he began to walk backward, not daring to face round again. He walked backward, stumbling and slipping, fearing every moment as he might tumble into a burn or down a cliff and break his neck, but fearing worse to turn his back on the cold thing.</p><p>\u201cHe couldna tell how long he\u2019d walked, only that his legs were trembling wi\u2019 weariness, when at last he caught a glimpse of light through the mist, and there was his own cottage, wi\u2019 the candle in the window. He cried out in joy, and turned to his door, but the cold thing was quick, and slippit past him, to stand betwixt him and the door.</p><p>\u201cHis wife had been watching out for him, and when she heard him cry out, she came at once to the door. Gavin shouted to her not to come out, but for God\u2019s sake to fetch a charm to drive away the tannasq. Quick as thought, she snatched the pot from beneath her bed, and a twig of myrtle bound wi\u2019 red thread and black, that she\u2019d made to bless the cows. She dashed the water against the doorposts, and the cold thing leapt upward, astride the lintel. Gavin rushed in beneath and barred the door, and stayed inside in his wife\u2019s arms until the dawn. They let the candle burn all the night, and Gavin Hayes never again left his house past sunset\u2014until he went to fight for Prince Tearlach.\u201d</p><p>Even Duncan, who knew the tale, sighed as Jamie finished speaking. Ian crossed himself, then looked about self-consciously, but no one seemed to have noticed.</p><p>\u201cSo, now Gavin has gone into the dark,\u201d Jamie said softly. \u201cBut we willna let him lie in unconsecrated ground.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDid they find the cow?\u201d Fergus asked, with his usual practicality. Jamie quirked one eyebrow at Duncan, who answered.</p><p>\u201cOh, aye, they did. The next morning they found the poor beast, wi\u2019 her hooves all clogged wi\u2019 mud and stones, staring mad and lathered about the muzzle, and her sides heavin\u2019 fit to burst.\u201d He glanced from me to Ian and back to Fergus. \u201cGavin did say,\u201d he said precisely, \u201cthat she looked as though she\u2019d been ridden to Hell and back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus.\u201d Ian took a deep gulp of his ale, and I did the same. In the corner, the drinking society was making attempts on a round of \u201cCaptain Thunder,\u201d breaking down each time in helpless laughter.</p><p>Ian put down his cup on the table.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened to them?\u201d he asked, his face troubled. \u201cTo Gavin\u2019s wife, and his son?\u201d</p><p>Jamie\u2019s eyes met mine, and his hand touched my thigh. I knew, without being told, what had happened to the Hayes family. Without Jamie\u2019s own courage and intransigence, the same thing would likely have happened to me and to our daughter Brianna.</p> <p>\u201cGavin never knew,\u201d Jamie said quietly. \u201cHe never heard aught of his wife\u2014she will have been starved, maybe, or driven out to die of the cold. His son took the field beside him at Culloden. Whenever a man who had fought there came into our cell, Gavin would ask\u2014\u2018Have ye maybe seen a bold lad named Archie Hayes, about so tall?\u2019 He measured automatically, five feet from the floor, capturing Hayes\u2019 gesture. \u201c \u2018A lad about fourteen,\u2019 he\u2019d say, \u2018wi\u2019 a green plaidie and a small gilt brooch.\u2019 But no one ever came who had seen him for sure\u2014either seen him fall or seen him run away safe.\u201d</p><p>Jamie took a sip of the ale, his eyes fixed on a pair of British officers who had come in and settled in the corner. It had grown dark outside, and they were plainly off duty. Their leather stocks were unfastened on account of the heat, and they wore only sidearms, glinting under their coats; nearly black in the dim light save where the firelight touched them with red.</p><p>\u201cSometimes he hoped the lad might have been captured and transported,\u201d he said. \u201cLike his brother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSurely that would be somewhere in the records?\u201d I said. \u201cDid they\u2014do they\u2014keep lists?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey did,\u201d Jamie said, still watching the soldiers. A small, bitter smile touched the corner of his mouth. \u201cIt was such a list that saved me, after Culloden, when they asked my name before shooting me, so as to add it to their roll. But a man like Gavin would have no way to see the English deadlists. And if he could have found out, I think he would not.\u201d He glanced at me. \u201cWould you choose to know for sure, and it was your child?\u201d</p><p>I shook my head, and he gave me a faint smile and squeezed my hand. Our child was safe, after all. He picked up his cup and drained it, then beckoned to the serving maid.</p><p>The girl brought the food, skirting the table widely in order to avoid Rollo. The beast lay motionless under the table, his head protruding into the room and his great hairy tail lying heavily across my feet, but his yellow eyes were wide open, watching everything. They followed the girl intently, and she backed nervously away, keeping an eye on him until she was safely out of biting distance.</p><p>Seeing this, Jamie cast a dubious look at the so-called dog.</p> <p>\u201cIs he hungry? Must I ask for a fish for him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no, Uncle,\u201d Ian reassured him. \u201cRollo catches his own fish.\u201d</p><p>Jamie\u2019s eyebrows shot up, but he only nodded, and with a wary glance at Rollo, took a platter of roasted oysters from the tray.</p><p>\u201cAh, the pity of it.\u201d Duncan Innes was quite drunk by now. He sat slumped against the wall, his armless shoulder riding higher than the other, giving him a strange, hunchbacked appearance. \u201cThat a dear man like Gavin should come to such an end!\u201d He shook his head lugubriously, swinging it back and forth over his alecup like the clapper of a funeral bell.</p><p>\u201cNo family left to mourn him, cast alone into a savage land\u2014hanged as a felon, and to be buried in an unconsecrated grave. Not even a proper lament to be sung for him!\u201d He picked up the cup, and with some difficulty, found his mouth with it. He drank deep and set it down with a muffled clang.</p><p>\u201cWell, he shall have a caithris!\u201d He glared belligerently from Jamie to Fergus to Ian. \u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>Jamie wasn\u2019t drunk, but he wasn\u2019t completely sober either. He grinned at Duncan and lifted his own cup in salute.</p><p>\u201cWhy not, indeed?\u201d he said. \u201cOnly it will have to be you singin\u2019 it, Duncan. None of the rest knew Gavin, and I\u2019m no singer. I\u2019ll shout along wi\u2019 ye, though.\u201d</p><p>Duncan nodded magisterially, bloodshot eyes surveying us. Without warning, he flung back his head and emitted a terrible howl. I jumped in my seat, spilling half a cup of ale into my lap. Ian and Fergus, who had evidently heard Gaelic laments before, didn\u2019t turn a hair.</p><p>All over the room, benches were shoved back, as men leapt to their feet in alarm, reaching for their pistols. The barmaid leaned out of the serving hatch, eyes big. Rollo came awake with an explosive \u201cWoof!\u201d and glared round wildly, teeth bared.</p><p>\u201cTha sinn cruinn a chaoidh ar caraid, Gabhainn Hayes,\u201d Duncan thundered, in a ragged baritone. I had just about enough Gaelic to translate this as \u201cWe are met to weep and cry out to heaven for the loss of our friend, Gavin Hayes!\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u00c8isd ris!\u201d Jamie chimed in.</p><p>\u201cRugadh e do Sheumas Immanuel Hayes agus Louisa N\u2019ic a Liallainn an am baile Chill-Mhartainn, ann an sgire Dhun Domhnuill, anns a bhliadhnaseachd ceud deug agus a haon!\u201d He was born of Seaumais Emmanuel Hayes and of Louisa Maclellan, in the village of Kilmartin in the parish of Dodanil, in the year of our Lord seventeen hundred and one!</p><p>\u201c\u00c8isd ris!\u201d This time Fergus and Ian joined in on the chorus, which I translated roughly as \u201cHear him!\u201d</p><p>Rollo appeared not to care for either verse or refrain; his ears lay flat against his skull, and his yellow eyes narrowed to slits. Ian scratched his head in reassurance, and he lay down again, muttering wolf curses under his breath.</p><p>The audience, having caught on to it that no actual violence threatened, and no doubt bored with the inferior vocal efforts of the drinking society in the corner, settled down to enjoy the show. By the time Duncan had worked his way into an accounting of the names of the sheep Gavin Hayes had owned before leaving his croft to follow his laird to Culloden, many of those at the surrounding tables were joining enthusiastically in the chorus, shouting \u201c\u00c8isd ris!\u201d and banging their mugs on the tables, in perfect ignorance of what was being said, and a good thing too.</p><p>Duncan, drunker than ever, fixed the soldiers at the next table with a baleful glare, sweat pouring down his face.</p><p>\u201cA Shasunnaich na galladh\u2019s olc a thig e dhuibh fanaid air b\u00e0s gasgaich. Gun toireadh an diabhul fhein leis anns a bh\u00e0s sibh, direach do Fhirinn!!\u201d Wicked Sassenach dogs, eaters of dead flesh! Ill does it become you to laugh and rejoice at the death of a gallant man! May the devil himself seize upon you in the hour of your death and take you straight to hell!</p><p>Ian blanched slightly at this, and Jamie cast Duncan a narrow look, but they stoutly shouted \u201c\u00c8isd ris!\u201d along with the rest of the crowd.</p><p>Fergus, seized by inspiration, got up and passed his hat among the crowd, who, carried away by ale and excitement, happily flung coppers into it for the privilege of joining in their own denunciation.</p><p>I had as good a head for drink as most men, but a much smaller bladder. Head spinning from the noise and fumes as much as from alcohol, I got up and edged my way out from behind the table, through the mob, and into the fresh air of the early evening.</p><p>It was still hot and sultry, though the sun was long since down. Still, there was a lot more air out here, and a lot fewer people sharing it.</p><p>Having relieved the internal pressure, I sat down on the tavern\u2019s chopping block with my pewter mug, breathing deeply. The night was clear, with a bright half-moon peeping silver over the harbor\u2019s edge. Our wagon stood nearby, no more than its outline visible in the light from the tavern windows. Presumably, Gavin Hayes\u2019 decently shrouded body lay within. I trusted he had enjoyed his caithris.</p><p>Inside, Duncan\u2019s chanting had come to an end. A clear tenor voice, wobbly with drink, but sweet nonetheless, was singing a familiar tune, audible over the babble of talk.</p><p>\u201cTo Anacreon in heav\u2019n, where he sat in full glee,</p><p>A few sons of harmony sent a petition,</p><p>That he their inspirer and patron would be!</p><p>When this answer arrived from the jolly old Grecian:</p><p>\u2018Voice, fiddle, and flute,</p><p>No longer be mute!</p><p>I\u2019ll lend you my name and inspire you to boot.\u2019 \u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The singer\u2019s voice cracked painfully on \u201cvoice, fiddle, and flute,\u201d but he sang stoutly on, despite the laughter from his audience.

It hadn\u2019t been a gentle death, and it had been a hot day.</p><p>\u201cAuntie Claire is right,\u201d Ian said, brushing his knuckles inconspicuously under his nose. \u201cWe dinna want to be attracting wild animals.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe canna be leaving Gavin here, surely!\u201d Duncan protested, scandalized at the thought. \u201cWhat, leave him lying on the step o\u2019 the inn in his shroud, like a foundling wrapped in swaddling clothes?\u201d He swayed alarmingly, his alcoholic intake affecting his always precarious balance.</p><p>I saw Jamie\u2019s wide mouth twitch with amusement, the moon shining white on the knife-edged bridge of his nose.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said. \u201cWe willna be leaving him here.\u201d He tossed the little bag from hand to hand with a faint chinking sound, then, making his decision, thrust it into his coat.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll bury him ourselves,\u201d he said. \u201cFergus, will ye be stepping into the stable yonder and see can ye buy a spade verra cheap?\u201d</p><p>The short journey to the church through the quiet streets of Charleston was somewhat less dignified than the usual funeral cortege, marked as it was by Duncan\u2019s insistence on repeating the more interesting portions of his lament as a processional.</p> <p>Jamie drove slowly, shouting occasional encouragement to the horses; Duncan staggered beside the team, chanting hoarsely and clutching one animal by its headstall, while Ian held the other to prevent bolting. Fergus and I brought up the rear in staid respectability, Fergus holding his newly purchased shovel at port-arms, and muttering dire predictions as to the likelihood of us all spending the night in gaol for disturbing the peace of Charleston.</p><p>As it was, the church stood by itself in a quiet street, some distance from the nearest house. This was all to the good, in terms of avoiding notice, but it did mean that the churchyard was dauntingly dark, with no glow of torch or candle to pierce the blackness.</p><p>Great magnolia trees overhung the gate, leathery leaves drooping in the heat, and a border of pines, meant to provide shade and respite in the day, served at night to block all traces of moon and starlight, leaving the churchyard itself black as a...well, as a crypt.</p><p>Walking through the air felt like pushing aside curtains of black velvet, perfumed with an incense of turpentine from the sun-heated pines; endless layers of soft, pungent smothering. Nothing could have been farther from the cold purity of the Highlands than this stifling southern atmosphere. Still, faint patches of mist hung under the dark brick walls, and I could have wished not to recall Jamie\u2019s story of the tannasq quite so vividly.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll find a place. Do you stay and hold the horses, Duncan.\u201d Jamie slid down from the wagon\u2019s seat and took me by the arm.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll find a nice wee spot by the wall, perhaps,\u201d he said, guiding me toward the gate. \u201cIan and I will dig while you hold the light, and Fergus can stand guard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about Duncan?\u201d I asked, with a backward glance. \u201cWill he be all right?\u201d The Scotsman was invisible, his tall, lanky form having faded into the larger blot comprising horses and wagon, but he was still clearly audible.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll be chief mourner,\u201d Jamie said, with a hint of a smile in his voice. \u201cMind your head, Sassenach.\u201d I ducked automatically beneath a low magnolia branch; I didn\u2019t know whether Jamie could actually see in total darkness, or merely felt things by instinct, but I had never seen him stumble, no matter how dark the surroundings.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you think someone\u2019s going to notice a fresh grave?\u201d It was not completely black in the churchyard, after all; once out from under the magnolias, I could make out the dim forms of gravestones, looking insubstantial but sinister in the dark, a faint mist rising from the thick grass about their feet.</p><p>The soles of my own feet tingled as we picked a ginger way through the stones. I seemed to feel silent waves of reproach at this unseemly intrusion wafting up from below. I barked my shin on a tombstone and bit my lip, stifling an urge to apologize to its owner.</p><p>\u201cI expect they might.\u201d Jamie let go of my arm to rummage in his coat. \u201cBut if the priest wanted money to bury Gavin, I shouldna think he\u2019d trouble to dig him up again for nothing, aye?\u201d</p><p>Young Ian materialized out of the darkness at my elbow, startling me.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s open space by the north wall, Uncle Jamie,\u201d he said, speaking softly in spite of the obvious fact that there was no one to hear. He paused, and drew slightly closer to me.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s verra dark in here, no?\u201d The boy sounded uneasy. He had had nearly as much to drink as Jamie or Fergus, but while the alcohol had imbued the older men with grim humor, it had clearly had a more depressing effect on Ian\u2019s spirits.</p><p>\u201cIt is, aye. I\u2019ve the bit of a candle I took from the tavern, though; wait a bit.\u201d Faint rustlings announced Jamie\u2019s search for flint and tinderbox.</p><p>The encompassing dark made me feel disembodied, like a ghost myself. I looked upward and saw stars, so faintly visible through the thick air that they shed no light upon the ground, but only gave a feeling of immense distance and infinite remoteness.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s like the vigil of Easter.\u201d Jamie\u2019s voice came softly, accompanied by the small scratching sounds of a striking flint. \u201cI saw the service once, at Notre Dame in Paris. Watch yourself, Ian, there\u2019s a stone just there!\u201d A thud and a stifled grunt announced that Ian had belatedly discovered the stone for himself.</p><p>\u201cThe church was all dark,\u201d Jamie continued, \u201cbut the folk coming for the service would buy small tapers from the crones at the doors. It was something like this\u201d\u2014I felt, rather than saw, his motion at the sky above\u2014\u201ca great space above, all ringing wi\u2019 the silence, and folk packed in on every side.\u201d Hot as it was, I gave an involuntary shiver at these words, which conjured up a vision of the dead around us, crowding silently side by side, in anticipation of an imminent resurrection.</p><p>\u201cAnd then, just when I thought I couldna bear the silence and the crowd, there came the priest\u2019s voice from the door. \u2018Lumen Christi!\u2019 he called out, and the acolytes lit the great candle that he carried. Then from it they took the flame to their own tapers, and scampered up and down the aisles, passing the fire to the candles o\u2019 the faithful.\u201d</p><p>I could see his hands, lit faintly by the tiny sparks from his flint.</p><p>\u201cThen the church came alive wi\u2019 a thousand small flames, but it was that first candle that broke the dark.\u201d</p><p>The scratching sounds ceased, and he took away the cupped hand that had shielded the newborn flame. The flame strengthened and lit his face from below, gilding the planes of high cheekbones and forehead, and shadowing the deep-set orbits of his eyes.</p><p>He lifted the candle, surveying the looming grave markers, eerie as a circle of standing stones.</p><p>\u201cLumen Christi,\u201d he said softly, inclining his head toward a granite pillar surmounted with a cross, \u201cet reguiescat in pace, amice.\u201d The half-mocking note had left his voice; he spoke with complete seriousness, and I felt at once oddly comforted, as though some watchful presence had withdrawn.</p><p>He smiled at me then, and handed me the candle.</p><p>\u201cSee can ye find a bit of wood for a torch, Sassenach,\u201d he said. \u201cIan and I will take it in turns to dig.\u201d</p><p>I was no longer nervous, but still felt like a grave robber, standing under a pine tree with my torch, watching Young Ian and Jamie take their turns in the deepening pit, their nak*d backs gleaming with sweat in the torchlight.</p><p>\u201cMedical students used to pay men to steal fresh bodies from churchyards,\u201d I said, handing my soiled kerchief to Jamie as he hauled himself out of the hole, grunting with effort. \u201cThat was the only way they could practice dissection.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid they?\u201d Jamie said. He wiped the sweat from his face and gave me a quick, wry glance. \u201cOr do they?\u201d</p><p>Luckily, it was too dark for Ian to notice my flush, despite the torchlight. It wasn\u2019t the first slip I had made, nor was it likely to be the last, but most such inadvertencies resulted in nothing more than a quizzical glance, were they noticed at all. The truth simply was not a possibility that would occur to anyone.</p><p>\u201cI imagine they do it now,\u201d I admitted. I shivered slightly at the thought of confronting a freshly exhumed and unpreserved body, still smeared with the dirt of its desecrated grave. Cadavers embalmed and laid on a stainless steel surface were not particularly pleasant either, but the formality of their presentation served to keep the corruptive realities of death at some small distance.</p><p>I exhaled strongly through my nose, trying to rid myself of odors, imagined and remembered. When I breathed in, my nostrils were filled with the smell of damp earth and hot pitch from my pine torch, and the fainter, cooler echo of live scent from the pines overhead.</p><p>\u201cThey take paupers and criminals from the prisons, too.\u201d Young Ian, who had evidently heard the exchange, if not understood it, took the opportunity to stop for a moment, wiping his brow as he leaned on the shovel.</p><p>\u201cDa told me about one time he was arrested, when they took him to Edinburgh, and kept him in the Tolbooth. He was in a cell wi\u2019 three other men, and one of them a fellow with the consumption, who coughed something dreadful, keeping the rest awake all night and all day. Then one night the coughing stopped, and they kent he was dead. But Da said they were so tired, they couldna do more than say a Pater Noster for his soul, and fall asleep.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The boy paused and rubbed an itching nose.</p><p>\u201cDa said he woke quite sudden wi\u2019 someone clutching his legs and another someone takin\u2019 him by the arms, liftin\u2019 him up. He kicked and cried out, and the one who had his arms screeched and dropped him, so that he cracked his head on the stones. He sat up rubbin\u2019 his pate and found himself staring at a doctor from the hospital and two fellows he\u2019d brought along to carry awa\u2019 the corpse to the dissecting room.\u201d</p><p>Ian grinned broadly at the recollection, wiping his sweat-soaked hair out of his face.</p><p>\u201cDa said he wasna sure who was most horrified, him or the fellows who\u2019d got the wrong body. He did say as the doctor seemed regretful, though\u2014said Da would have made a more interesting specimen, what wi\u2019 his leg stump and all.\u201d</p> <p>Jamie laughed, stretching his arms to ease his shoulders. With face and torso streaked with red dirt, and his hair bound back with a kerchief round his forehead, he looked disreputable as any grave robber.</p><p>\u201cAye, I mind that story,\u201d he said. \u201cIan did say after that as all doctors were ghouls, and wouldna have a thing to do with them.\u201d He grinned at me; I had been a doctor\u2014a surgeon\u2014in my own time, but here I passed as nothing more than a wisewoman, skilled in the use of herbs.</p><p>\u201cFortunately, I\u2019m no afraid of wee ghoulies, myself,\u201d he said, and leaned down to kiss me briefly. His lips were warm, tasting of ale. I could see droplets of sweat caught in the curly hairs of his chest, and his n**ples, dark buds in the dim light. A tremor that had nothing to do either with cold or with the eeriness of our surroundings ran down my spine. He saw it and his eyes met mine. He took a deep breath, and all at once I was conscious of the close fit of my bodice, and the weight of my br**sts in the sweat-soaked fabric.</p><p>Jamie shifted himself slightly, plucking to ease the fit of his breeches.</p><p>\u201cDamn,\u201d he said softly. He lowered his eyes and turned away, mouth barely touched by a rueful smile.</p> <p>I hadn\u2019t expected it, but I recognized it, all right. A sudden surge of lust was a common, if peculiar, response to the presence of death. Soldiers feel it in the lull after battle; so do healers who deal in blood and struggle. Perhaps Ian had been more right than I thought about the ghoulishness of doctors.</p><p>Jamie\u2019s hand touched my back and I started, showering sparks from the blazing torch. He took it from me and nodded toward a nearby gravestone.</p><p>\u201cSit down, Sassenach,\u201d he said. \u201cYe shouldna be standing so long.\u201d I had cracked the tibia of my left leg in the shipwreck, and while it had healed quickly, the leg still ached sometimes.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m all right.\u201d Still, I moved toward the stone, brushing against him as I passed. He radiated heat, but his nak*d flesh was cool to the touch, the sweat evaporating on his skin. I could smell him.</p><p>I glanced at him, and saw goose bumps rise on the fair flesh where I\u2019d touched him. I swallowed, fighting back a sudden vision of tumbling in the dark, to a fierce blind coupling amid crushed grass and raw earth.</p><p>His hand lingered on my elbow as he helped me to a seat on the stone. Rollo was lying by its side, drops of saliva gleaming in the torchlight as he panted. The slanted yellow eyes narrowed at me.</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t even think about it,\u201d I said, narrowing my own eyes back at him. \u201cBite me, and I\u2019ll cram my shoe down your throat so far you\u2019ll choke.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWuff!\u201d Rollo said, quite softly. He laid his muzzle on his paws, but the hairy ears were pricked, turned to catch the slightest sound.</p><p>The spade chunked softly into the earth at Ian\u2019s feet, and he straightened up, slicking sweat off his face with a palm swipe that left black smears along his jaw. He blew out a deep breath and glanced up at Jamie, miming exhaustion, tongue lolling from the corner of his mouth.</p><p>\u201cAye, I expect it\u2019s deep enough.\u201d Jamie answered the wordless plea with a nod. \u201cI\u2019ll fetch Gavin along, then.\u201d</p><p>Fergus frowned uneasily, his features sharp in the torchlight.</p><p>\u201cWill you not need help to carry the corpse?\u201d His reluctance was evident; still, he had offered. Jamie gave him a faint, wry smile.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll manage well enough,\u201d he said. \u201cGavin was a wee man. Still, ye might bring the torch to see by.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll come too, Uncle!\u201d Young Ian scrambled hastily out of the pit, skinny shoulders gleaming with sweat. \u201cJust in case you need help,\u201d he added breathlessly.</p> <p>\u201cAfraid to be left in the dark?\u201d Fergus asked sarcastically. I thought that the surroundings must be making him uneasy; though he occasionally teased Ian, whom he regarded as a younger brother, he was seldom cruel about it.</p><p>\u201cAye, I am,\u201d Ian said simply. \u201cAren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Fergus opened his mouth, brows arched skyward, then shut it again and turned without a word toward the black opening of the lych-gate, whence Jamie had disappeared.</p><p>\u201cD\u2019ye not think this is a terrible place, Auntie?\u201d Ian murmured uneasily at my elbow, sticking close as we made our way through the looming stones, following the flicker of Fergus\u2019s torch. \u201cI keep thinking of that story Uncle Jamie told. And thinking now Gavin\u2019s dead, maybe the cold thing...I mean, do you think would it maybe...come for him?\u201d There was an audible swallow punctuating this question, and I felt an icy finger touch me, just at the base of my spine.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I said, a little too loudly. I grabbed Ian\u2019s arm, less for support than for the reassurance of his solidity. \u201cCertainly not.\u201d</p><p>His skin was clammy with evaporating sweat, but the skinny muscularity of the arm under my hand was comforting. His half-visible presence reminded me faintly of Jamie; he was nearly as tall as his uncle, and very nearly as strong, though still lean and gangling with adolescence.</p><p>We emerged with gratitude into the little pool of light thrown by Fergus\u2019s torch. The flickering light shone through the wagon wheels, throwing shadows that lay like spiderwebs in the dust. It was as hot in the road as it was in the churchyard, but the air seemed somehow freer, easier to breathe, out from under the suffocating trees.</p><p>Rather to my surprise, Duncan was still awake, perched drooping on the wagon\u2019s seat like a sleepy owl, shoulders hunched about his ears. He was crooning under his breath, but stopped when he saw us. The long wait seemed to have sobered him a bit; he got down from the seat steadily enough and came round to the rear of the wagon to help Jamie.</p><p>I smothered a yawn. I would be glad to be done with this melancholy duty and on our way to rest, even if the only bed to look forward to was one of piled leaves.</p><p>\u201cIfrinn an Diabhuil! A Dhia, thoir cobhair!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSacr\u00e9e Vierge!\u201d</p><p>My head snapped up. Everyone was shouting, and the horses, startled, were neighing and jerking frantically against their hobbles, making the wagon hop and lurch like a drunken beetle.</p><p>\u201cWuff!\u201d Rollo said next to me.</p><p>\u201cJesus!\u201d said Ian, goggling at the wagon. \u201cJesus Christ!\u201d</p><p>I swung in the direction he was looking, and screamed. A pale figure loomed out of the wagon bed, swaying with the wagon\u2019s jerking. I had no time to see more before all hell broke loose.</p><p>Rollo bunched his hindquarters and launched himself through the dark with a roar, to the accompaniment of shouts from Jamie and Ian, and a terrible scream from the ghost. Behind me, I could hear the sound of French cursing as Fergus ran back into the churchyard, stumbling and crashing over tombstones in the dark.</p><p>Jamie had dropped the torch; it flickered and hissed on the dusty road, threatening to go out. I fell to my knees and grabbed it, blowing on it, desperate to keep it alight.</p><p>The chorus of shouts and growling grew to a crescendo, and I rose up, torch in hand, to find Ian struggling with Rollo, trying to keep him away from the dim figures wrestling together in a cloud of dust.</p><p>\u201cArr\u00eates esp\u00e8ce de cochon!\u201d Fergus galloped out of the dark, brandishing the spade he had gone to fetch. Finding his injunction disregarded, he stepped forward and brought it down one-handed on the intruder\u2019s head with a dull clong! Then he swung toward Ian and Rollo.</p><p>\u201cYou be quiet, too!\u201d Fergus said to the dog, threatening him with the shovel. \u201cShut up this minute, foul beast, or I brain you!\u201d</p><p>Rollo snarled, with a show of impressive teeth that I interpreted roughly to mean \u201cYou and who else?\u201d but was prevented from mayhem by Ian, who wrapped his arm about the dog\u2019s throat and choked off any further remarks.</p><p>\u201cWhere did he come from?\u201d Ian asked in amazement. He craned his neck, trying to get a look at the fallen figure without letting go of Rollo.</p><p>\u201cFrom hell,\u201d Fergus said briefly. \u201cAnd I invite him to go back there at once.\u201d He was trembling with shock and exertion; the light gleamed dully from his hook as he brushed a thick lock of black hair out of his eyes.</p><p>\u201cNot from hell; from the gallows. Do ye not know him?\u201d</p><p>Jamie rose slowly to his feet, dusting his breeches. He was breathing heavily, and smeared with dirt, but seemed unhurt. He picked up his fallen kerchief and glanced about, wiping his face. \u201cWhere\u2019s Duncan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere, Mac Dubh,\u201d said a gruff voice from the front of the wagon. \u201cThe beasts werena likin\u2019 Gavin much to start with, and they\u2019re proper upset to think he was a-resurrectin\u2019. Not,\u201d he added fairly, \u201cbut what I was a wee bit startled myself.\u201d He eyed the figure on the ground with disfavor, and patted one skittish horse firmly on the neck. \u201cAh, it\u2019s no but a silly bugger, luaidh, hush your noise now, aye?\u201d</p><p>I had handed Ian the torch and knelt to inspect the damage to our visitor. This seemed to be slight; the man was already stirring. Jamie was right; it was the man who had escaped hanging earlier in the day. He was young, about thirty, muscular and powerfully built, his fair hair matted with sweat and stiff with filth. He reeked of prison, and the musky-sharp smell of prolonged fear. Little wonder.</p><p>I got a hand under his arm and helped him to sit up. He grunted and put his hand to his head, squinting in the torchlight.</p><p>\u201cAre you all right?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cThankin\u2019 ye kindly, ma\u2019am, I will have been better.\u201d He had a faint Irish accent and a soft, deep voice.</p><p>Rollo, upper lip lifted just enough to show a menacing eyetooth, shoved his nose into the visitor\u2019s armpit, sniffed, then jerked back his head and sneezed explosively. A small tremor of laughter ran round the circle, and the tension relaxed momentarily.</p><p>\u201cHow long have ye been in the wagon?\u201d Duncan demanded.</p><p>\u201cSince midafternoon.\u201d The man rose awkwardly onto his knees, swaying a bit from the effects of the blow. He touched his head again and winced. \u201cOh, Jaysus! I crawled in there just after the Frenchie loaded up poor old Gavin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere were you before that?\u201d Ian asked.</p><p>\u201cHidin\u2019 under the gallows cart. It was the only place I thought they wouldn\u2019t be looking.\u201d He rose laboriously to his feet, closed his eyes to get his balance, then opened them. They were a pale green in the torchlight, the color of shallow seas. I saw them flick from face to face, then settle on Jamie. The man bowed, careful of his head. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cStephen Bonnet. Your servant, sir.\u201d He made no move to extend a hand in greeting, nor did Jamie.</p><p>\u201cMr. Bonnet.\u201d Jamie nodded back, face carefully blank. I didn\u2019t know quite how he contrived to look commanding, wearing nothing but a pair of damp and dirt-stained breeks, but he managed it. He looked the visitor over, taking in every detail of his appearance.</p><p>Bonnet was what country people called \u201cwell set up,\u201d with a tall, powerful frame and a barrel chest, his features heavy-boned but coarsely handsome. A few inches shorter than Jamie, he stood easy, balanced on the balls of his feet, fists half closed in readiness.</p><p>No stranger to a fight, judging by the slight crookedness of his nose and a small scar by the corner of his mouth. The small imperfections did nothing to mar the overall impression of animal magnetism; he was the sort of man who attracted women easily. Some women, I amended, as he cast a speculative glance at me.</p> <p>\u201cFor what crime were ye condemned, Mr. Bonnet?\u201d Jamie asked. He himself stood easy, but with a look of watchfulness that reminded me forcibly of Bonnet himself. It was the ears-back look male dogs give each other before deciding whether to fight.</p><p>\u201cSmuggling,\u201d Bonnet said.</p><p>Jamie didn\u2019t reply, but tilted his head slightly. One brow rose in inquiry.</p><p>\u201cAnd piracy.\u201d A muscle twitched near Bonnet\u2019s mouth; a poor attempt at a smile, or an involuntary quiver of fear?</p><p>\u201cAnd will ye have killed anyone in the commission of your crimes, Mr. Bonnet?\u201d Jamie\u2019s face was blank, save for the watchful eyes. Think twice, his eyes said plainly. Or maybe three times.</p> <p>\u201cNone that were not tryin\u2019 to kill me first,\u201d Bonnet replied. The words were easy, the tone almost flippant, but belied by the hand that closed tight into a fist by his side.</p><p>It dawned on me that Bonnet must feel he was facing judge and jury, as surely as he had faced them once before. He had no way of knowing that we were nearly as reluctant to go near the garrison soldiers as he was.</p><p>Jamie looked at Bonnet for a long moment, peering closely at him in the flickering torchlight, then nodded and took a half step back.</p><p>\u201cGo, then,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cWe will not hinder ye.\u201d</p><p>Bonnet took an audible breath; I could see the big frame relax, shoulders slumping under the cheap linen shirt.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d he said. He wiped a hand across his face, and took another deep breath. The green eyes darted from me to Fergus to Duncan. \u201cBut will ye help me, maybe?\u201d</p> <p>Duncan, who had relaxed at Jamie\u2019s words, gave a grunt of surprise.</p><p>\u201cHelp you? A thief?\u201d</p><p>Bonnet\u2019s head swiveled in Duncan\u2019s direction. The iron collar was a dark line about his neck, giving the eerie impression that his severed head floated several inches above his shoulders.</p><p>\u201cHelp me,\u201d he repeated. \u201cThere will be soldiers on the roads tonight\u2014huntin\u2019 me.\u201d He gestured toward the wagon. \u201cYou could take me safely past them\u2014if ye will.\u201d He turned back to Jamie, and straightened his back, shoulders stiff. \u201cI am begging for your help, sir, in the name of Gavin Hayes, who was my friend as well as yours\u2014and a thief, as I am.\u201d</p><p>The men studied him in silence for a moment, digesting this. Fergus glanced inquiringly at Jamie; the decision was his.</p><p>But Jamie, after a long, considering look at Bonnet, turned to Duncan.</p><p>\u201cWhat say ye, Duncan?\u201d Duncan gave Bonnet the same kind of look that Jamie himself had used, and finally nodded.</p><p>\u201cFor Gavin\u2019s sake,\u201d he said, and turned away toward the lych-gate.</p> <p>\u201cAll right, then,\u201d Jamie said. He sighed and pushed a loose lock of hair behind his ear.</p><p>\u201cHelp us to bury Gavin,\u201d he said to our new guest, \u201cand then we\u2019ll go.\u201d</p><p>An hour later, Gavin\u2019s grave was a blank rectangle of fresh-turned earth, stark among the gray hues of the surrounding grass.</p><p>\u201cHe must have his name to mark him by,\u201d Jamie said. Painstakingly, he scratched the letters of Gavin\u2019s name and his dates upon a piece of smooth beach-stone, using the point of his knife. I rubbed soot from the torch into the incised letters, making a crude but readable grave marker, and Ian set this solidly into a small cairn of gathered pebbles. Atop the tiny monument, Jamie gently set the stub of candle that he had taken from the tavern.</p><p>Everyone stood awkwardly about the grave for a moment, not knowing how to take farewell. Jamie and Duncan stood close together, looking down. They would have taken final leave of many such comrades since Culloden, if often with less ceremony.</p><p>Finally Jamie nodded to Fergus, who took a dry pine twig, and lighting it from my torch, bent and touched it to the candle\u2019s wick.</p><p>\u201cRequiem aeternam dona ei, et lux perpetua luceat ei....\u201d Jamie said quietly.</p><p>\u201cEternal rest grant unto him, O God\u2014and let perpetual light shine upon him.\u201d Young Ian echoed it softly, his face solemn in the torchlight.</p><p>Without a word, we turned and left the churchyard. Behind us, the candle burned without a flicker in the still, heavy air, like the sanctuary lamp in an empty church.</p><p>The moon was high in the sky by the time we reached the military checkpoint outside the city walls. It was only a half-moon, but shed enough light for us to see the trampled dirt track of the wagon road that ran before us, wide enough for two wagons to travel abreast.</p><p>We had encountered several such points on the road between Savannah and Charleston, mostly manned by bored soldiers who waved us through without bothering to check the passes we had obtained in Georgia. The checkpoints were mostly concerned with the interception of smuggled goods, and with the capture of the odd bondservant or slave, escaped from his master.</p><p>Even filthy and unkempt, we passed notice for the most part; few travelers were in better case. Fergus and Duncan could not be indentured men, maimed as they were, and Jamie\u2019s presence transcended his clothes; shabby coat or not, no man would take him for a servant.</p><p>Tonight was different, though. There were eight soldiers at the checkpoint, not the usual two, and all were armed and alert. Musket barrels flashed in the moonlight as the shout of \u201cHalt! Your name and your business!\u201d came from the dark. A lantern was hoisted up six inches from my face, blinding me for a moment.</p><p>\u201cJames Fraser, bound for Wilmington, with my family and servants.\u201d Jamie\u2019s voice was calm, and his hands were steady as he handed me the reins before reaching for the passes in his coat.</p><p>I kept my head down, trying to look tired and indifferent. I was tired, all right\u2014I could have lain down in the road and slept\u2014but far from indifferent. What did they do to you for aiding the escape of a fugitive from the gallows? I wondered. A single drop of sweat snaked its way down the back of my neck.</p><p>\u201cHave you seen anyone along the road as you passed, sir?\u201d The \u201csir\u201d came a little reluctantly; the dilapidation of Jamie\u2019s coat and my gown were obvious in the pool of yellow lantern light.</p><p>\u201cA carriage that passed us from the town; I suppose you will have seen that yourselves,\u201d Jamie answered. The sergeant replied with a grunt, checking the passes carefully, then squinting into the dark to count and see that the attendant bodies matched.</p><p>\u201cWhat goods do you carry?\u201d He handed back the passes, motioning to one of his subordinates to search the wagon. I twitched the reins inadvertently, and the horses snorted and shook their heads. Jamie\u2019s foot nudged mine, but he didn\u2019t look at me.</p><p>\u201cSmall household goods,\u201d he answered, still calm. \u201cA half of venison and a bag of salt, for provision. And a body.\u201d</p><p>The soldier who had been reaching for the wagon covering stopped abruptly. The sergeant looked up sharply.</p><p>\u201cA what?\u201d</p><p>Jamie took the reins from me and wrapped them casually about his wrist. From the corner of my eye, I saw Duncan edge toward the darkness of the wood; Fergus, with his pickpocket\u2019s skill, had already faded from view.</p><p>\u201cThe corpse of the man who was hanged this afternoon. He was known to me; I asked permission of Colonel Franklin to take him to his kinsmen in the north. That is why we travel by night,\u201d he added delicately.</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d The sergeant motioned a lantern bearer closer. He gave Jamie a long thoughtful look, eyes narrowed, and nodded. \u201cI remember you,\u201d he said. \u201cYou called out to him at the last. A friend, was he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI knew him once. Some years ago,\u201d he added. The sergeant nodded to his subordinate, not taking his eyes off Jamie.</p><p>\u201cHave a look, Griswold.\u201d</p><p>Griswold, who was perhaps fourteen, betrayed a notable lack of enthusiasm for the order, but dutifully lifted the canvas cover and raised his lantern to peer into the wagon bed. With an effort, I kept myself from turning to look.</p><p>The near horse snorted and tossed its head. If we did have to bolt, it would take several seconds for the horses to get the wagon moving. I heard Ian shift behind me, getting his hand on the club of hickory wood stowed behind the seat.</p><p>\u201cYes, sir, it\u2019s a body,\u201d Griswold reported. \u201cIn a shroud.\u201d He dropped the canvas with an air of relief, and exhaled strongly through his nostrils.</p><p>\u201cFix your bayonet and give it a jab,\u201d the sergeant said, eyes still on Jamie. I must have made a small noise, for the sergeant\u2019s glance shifted to me.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll soil my wagon,\u201d Jamie objected. \u201cThe man\u2019s fair ripe, after a day in the sun, aye?\u201d</p><p>The sergeant snorted impatiently. \u201cJab it in the leg, then. Get on, Griswold!\u201d</p><p>With a marked air of reluctance, Griswold affixed his bayonet, and standing on tiptoe, began to poke gingerly about in the wagon bed. Behind me, Ian had begun to whistle softly. A Gaelic tune whose title translated to \u201cIn the Morn We Die,\u201d which I thought very tasteless of him.</p><p>\u201cNo, sir, he\u2019s dead all right.\u201d Griswold dropped back on his heels, sounding relieved. \u201cI poked right hard, but not a twitch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, then.\u201d Dismissing the young soldier with a jerk of his hand, the sergeant nodded to Jamie. \u201cDrive on then, Mr. Fraser. But I\u2019d advise you to choose your friends more carefully in future.\u201d</p><p>I saw Jamie\u2019s knuckles whiten on the reins, but he only drew himself up straight and settled his hat more firmly on his head. He clicked his tongue and the horses set off sharply, leaving puffs of pale dust floating in the lantern light.</p><p>The darkness seemed engulfing after the light; despite the moon, I could see almost nothing. The night enfolded us. I felt the relief of a hunted animal that finds safe refuge, and in spite of the oppressive heat, I breathed more freely.</p><p>We covered a distance of nearly a quarter mile before anyone spoke.</p><p>\u201cAre ye wounded, Mr. Bonnet?\u201d Ian spoke in a loud whisper, just audible over the rattle of the wagon.</p><p>\u201cYes, he\u2019s pinked me in the thigh, damn the puppy.\u201d Bonnet\u2019s voice was low, but calm. \u201cThank Christ he left off before the blood soaked through the shroud. Dead men don\u2019t bleed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you hurt badly? Shall I come back and have a look at it?\u201d I twisted around. Bonnet had pushed back the canvas cover and was sitting up, a vague pale shape in the darkness.</p><p>\u201cNo, I thank ye, ma\u2019am. I\u2019ve my stocking wound round it and \u2019twill serve well enough, I expect.\u201d My night vision was returning; I could see the gleam of fair hair as he bent his head to his task. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cCan ye walk, do ye think?\u201d Jamie slowed the horses to a walk, and twisted round to inspect our guest. While his tone was not inhospitable, it was clear that he would prefer to be rid of our dangerous cargo as soon as possible.</p><p>\u201cNot easily, no. I\u2019m that sorry, sir.\u201d Bonnet was aware of Jamie\u2019s eagerness to be rid of him, too. With some difficulty, he hoisted himself up in the wagon bed, rising onto his good knee behind the seat. His lower half was invisible in darkness, but I could smell the blood on him, a sharper scent than the lingering faint reek of Gavin\u2019s shroud.</p><p>\u201cA suggestion, Mr. Fraser. In three miles, we\u2019ll come to the Ferry Trail road. A mile past the crossroads, another road leads toward the coast. It\u2019s little more than a pair of ruts, but passable. That will take us to the edge of a creek with an outlet to the sea. Some associates of mine will be puttin\u2019 in to anchor there within the week; if ye would grant me some small stock of provisions, I can await them in reasonable safety, and you can be on your way, free o\u2019 the taint of my company.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAssociates? Ye mean pirates?\u201d Ian\u2019s voice held a certain amount of wariness. Having been abducted from Scotland by pirates, he invested such persons with none of the romanticism normal to a fifteen-year-old.</p> <p>\u201cThat would depend upon your perspective, lad.\u201d Bonnet sounded amused. \u201cCertainly the governors of the Carolinas would call them so; the merchants of Wilmington and Charleston perhaps regard them otherwise.\u201d</p><p>Jamie gave a brief snort. \u201cSmugglers, aye? And what might these associates of yours be dealing in, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever will fetch a price to make it worth the risk of carrying.\u201d The amusement had not left Bonnet\u2019s voice, but was now tinged with cynicism. \u201cWill you be wanting some reward for your assistance? That can be managed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do not.\u201d Jamie\u2019s voice was cold. \u201cI saved you for Gavin Hayes\u2019 sake, and for my own. I wouldna seek reward for such service.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI meant no offense to ye, sir.\u201d Bonnet\u2019s head inclined slightly toward us.</p> <p>\u201cNone taken,\u201d Jamie answered shortly. He shook out the reins and wrapped them afresh, changing hands.</p><p>Conversation lapsed after this small clash, though Bonnet continued to ride kneeling behind us, peering over my shoulder at the dark road ahead. There were no more soldiers, though; nothing moved, not even a breath of wind in the leaves. Nothing disturbed the silence of the summer night save the occasional thin zeek of a passing night bird, or the hooting of an owl.</p><p>The soft rhythmic thump of the horses\u2019 hooves in the dust and the squeak and rattle of the wagon began to lull me to sleep. I tried to keep upright, watching the black shadows of the trees along the road, but found myself gradually inclining toward Jamie, my eyes falling shut despite my best efforts.</p><p>Jamie transferred the reins to his left hand, and putting his right arm around me, drew me down to rest against his shoulder. As always, I felt safe when I touched him. I went limp, cheek pressed against the dusty serge of his coat, and fell at once into that uneasy doze that is the consequence of a combination of utter exhaustion and the inability to lie down.</p><p>I opened my eyes once to see the tall, lean figure of Duncan Innes, pacing alongside the wagon with his tireless hillman\u2019s stride, head bowed as though in deep thought. Then I closed them again, and drifted into a doze in which memories of the day mingled with inchoate fragments of dreams. I dreamt of a giant skunk sleeping under a tavern\u2019s table, waking to join in a chorus of \u201cThe Star-Spangled Banner,\u201d and then of a swinging corpse that raised its lolling head and grinned with empty eyes...I came awake to find Jamie gently shaking me.</p><p>\u201cYe\u2019d best crawl into the back and lie down, Sassenach,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re craicklin\u2019 in your sleep. You\u2019ll be slippin\u2019 into the road, next thing.\u201d</p> <p>Blearily assenting, I clambered awkwardly over the seat back, changing places with Bonnet, and found a place in the wagonbed next to the slumbering form of Young Ian.</p><p>It smelt musty\u2014and worse\u2014in the wagon bed. Ian had his head pillowed on a packet of roughly butchered venison, wrapped in the untanned skin of the deer. Rollo had done somewhat better, his hairy muzzle resting comfortably on Ian\u2019s stomach. For myself, I took the leathern bag of salt. The smooth leather was hard under my cheek, but odorless.</p><p>The jolting boards of the wagon bed couldn\u2019t by any stretch of the imagination be called comfortable, but the relief of being able to stretch out at full length was so overwhelming that I scarcely noticed the bumps and jolts. I rolled onto my back and looked up into the hazy immensity of the southern sky, studded thick with blazing stars. Lumen Christi, I thought, and comforted by the thought of Gavin Hayes finding his way safe home by the lights of heaven, fell once more fast asleep.</p><p>I could not tell how long I slept, wrapped in a drugged blanket of heat and exhaustion. I woke when the pace of the wagon changed, swimming toward the surface of consciousness, drenched with sweat.</p><p>Bonnet and Jamie were talking, in the low, easy tones of men who had found their way past the early awkwardness of first acquaintance.</p><p>\u201cYou said that ye saved me for Gavin Hayes\u2019 sake\u2014and for your own,\u201d Bonnet was saying. His voice was soft, barely audible above the rumble of the wheels. \u201cWhat did ye mean by that, sir, and ye\u2019ll pardon my asking\u2014?\u201d</p><p>Jamie didn\u2019t answer at once; I nearly fell asleep again before he spoke, but at last his answer came, floating disembodied in the warm, dark air.</p><p>\u201cYe wilna have slept much last night, I think? Knowing what was to come to ye with the day?\u201d</p> <p>There was a low laugh from Bonnet, not entirely amused.</p><p>\u201cToo right,\u201d he said. \u201cI doubt I shall forget it in a hurry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNor will I.\u201d Jamie said something soft in Gaelic to the horses, and they slowed in response. \u201cI once lived through such a night, knowing I would hang, come morning. And yet I lived, through the grace of one who risked much to save me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see,\u201d Bonnet said softly. \u201cSo you are an asgina ageli, are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye? And what will that be?\u201d</p><p>There was a sound of scraping and brushing leaves against the side of the wagon, and the spicy sap-scent of the trees grew suddenly stronger. Something light touched my face\u2014leaves, falling from above. The horses slowed, and the rhythm of the wagon changed markedly, the wheels finding an uneven surface. We had turned into the small road that led to Bonnet\u2019s creek.</p><p>\u201cAsgina ageli is a term that the red savages employ\u2014the Cherokee of the mountains; I heard it from one I had as guide one time. It means \u2018half-ghost,\u2019 one who should have died by right, but yet remains on the earth; a woman who survives a mortal illness, a man fallen into his enemies\u2019 hands who escapes. They say an asgina ageli has one foot on the earth and the other in the spirit world. He can talk to the spirits, and see the Nunnahee\u2014the Little People.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLittle People? Will that be like the faeries?\u201d Jamie sounded surprised.</p><p>\u201cSomething of the kind.\u201d Bonnet shifted his weight and the seat creaked as he stretched. \u201cThe Indians do say that the Nunnahee live inside the rocks of the mountains, and come out to help their people in time of war or other evil.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that so? It will be something like the tales they tell in the Highlands of Scotland, then\u2014of the Auld Folk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIndeed.\u201d Bonnet sounded amused. \u201cWell, from what I have heard of the Scotch Highlanders, there is little to choose between them and the red men for barbarous conduct.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNonsense,\u201d said Jamie, sounding not the least offended. \u201cThe red savages eat the hearts of their enemies, or so I have heard. I prefer a good dish of oatmeal parritch, myself.\u201d</p><p>Bonnet made a noise, hastily stifled.</p><p>\u201cYou are a Highlander? Well, I will say that for a barbarian, I have found ye passing civil, sir,\u201d he assured Jamie, the laughter quivering in his voice.</p><p>\u201cI am exceedingly obliged for your kind opinion, sir,\u201d Jamie replied, with equal politeness.</p><p>Their voices faded into the rhythmic squeaking of the wheels, and I was asleep again before I could hear more.</p><p>The moon hung low over the trees by the time we came to a halt. I was roused by the movements of Young Ian, clambering sleepily over the wagon\u2019s edge to help Jamie tend to the horses. I poked my head up to see a broad stretch of water flowing past shelving banks of clay and silt, the stream a shiny black glittering with silver where riffles purled on the rocks near shore. Bonnet, with customary New World understatement, might call it a creek, but it would pass for a decent river among most boatmen, I thought.</p><p>The men moved to and fro in the shadows, carrying out their tasks with no more than an occasional muttered word. They moved with unaccustomed slowness, seeming to fade into the night, made insubstantial by fatigue.</p><p>\u201cDo ye go and find a place to sleep, Sassenach,\u201d Jamie said, pausing to steady me as I dropped down from the wagon. \u201cI must just see our guest provisioned and set on his way, and the beasts wiped down and put to grass.\u201d</p><p>The temperature had dropped scarcely at all since nightfall, but the air seemed fresher here near the water, and I found myself reviving somewhat.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t sleep until I\u2019ve bathed,\u201d I said, pulling the soaked bodice of my gown away from my br**sts. \u201cI feel terrible.\u201d My hair was pasted to my temples with sweat, and my flesh felt grimed and itchy. The dark water looked cool and inviting. Jamie cast a longing look at it, plucking at his crumpled stock.</p><p>\u201cI canna say I blame ye. Go careful, though; Bonnet says the channel in midstream is deep enough to float a ketch, and it\u2019s a tide-creek; there\u2019ll be a strong current.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll stay near the shore.\u201d I pointed downstream, where a small point of land marked a bend in the river, its willows shining dusky silver in the moonlight. \u201cSee that little point? There should be an eddy pool there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye. Go careful, then,\u201d he said again, and squeezed my elbow in farewell. As I turned to go, a large pale shape loomed up before me; our erstwhile guest, one leg of his breeches stained dark with dried blood.</p><p>\u201cYour servant, ma\u2019am,\u201d he said, making me a creditable bow, despite the injured leg. \u201cDo I bid you now adieu?\u201d He was standing a bit closer to me than I quite liked, and I repressed the urge to step backward.</p><p>\u201cYou do,\u201d I said, and nodded to him, brushing back a dangling lock of hair. \u201cGood luck, Mr. Bonnet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thank ye for your kind wishes, ma\u2019am,\u201d he answered softly. \u201cBut I have found that a man most often makes his own luck. Good night to ye, ma\u2019am.\u201d He bowed once more and turned away, limping heavily, like the ghost of a crippled bear.</p><p>The creek\u2019s rushing masked most of the ordinary night sounds. I saw a bat blink through a patch of moonlight over the water, in pursuit of insects too small to see, and vanish into the night. If anything else lurked in the dark, it was quiet.</p><p>Jamie grunted softly to himself.</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019ve my doubts of the man,\u201d he said, as though answering a question I hadn\u2019t asked. \u201cI must hope I\u2019ve only been softhearted, and not softheaded, by helpin\u2019 him.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou couldn\u2019t leave him to hang, after all,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cOh, aye, I could,\u201d he said, surprising me. He saw me look up at him, and smiled, the wry twist of his mouth barely visible in the dark.</p><p>\u201cThe Crown doesna always pick the wrong man to hang, Sassenach,\u201d he said. \u201cMore often than not, the man on the end of a rope deserves to be there. And I shouldna like to think I\u2019ve helped a villain to go free.\u201d He shrugged, and shoved his hair back out of his face.</p><p>\u201cAye, well, it\u2019s done. Go and have your bath, Sassenach; I\u2019ll come to ye so soon as I may.\u201d</p> <p>I stood on tiptoe to kiss him, and felt him smile as I did so. My tongue touched his mouth in delicate invitation, and he bit my lower lip gently, in answer.</p><p>\u201cCan ye stay awake a wee bit longer, Sassenach?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs long as it takes,\u201d I assured him. \u201cBut do hurry, won\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>There was a patch of thick grass edging the point below the willows. I undressed slowly, enjoying the feel of the water-borne breeze through the damp cloth of shift and stockings, and the final freedom as the last bits of clothing fell to the ground, leaving me nak*d to the night.</p><p>I stepped gingerly into the water. It was surprisingly cool\u2014cold, by contrast to the hot night air. The bottom under my feet was mostly silt, but it yielded to fine sand within a yard of shore.</p> <p>Though it was a tidal creek, we were far enough upstream that the water was fresh and sweet. I drank and splashed my face, washing away the dust in throat and nose.</p><p>I waded in up to mid-thigh, mindful of Jamie\u2019s cautions about channels and currents. After the staggering heat of the day and the smothering embrace of the night, the sensation of coolness on bare skin was an overwhelming relief. I cupped handfuls of cold water and splashed them on my face and br**sts; the droplets ran down my stomach and tickled coldly between my legs.</p><p>I could feel the slight push of the tide coming in, shoving gently against my calves, urging me toward shore. I wasn\u2019t ready to come in yet, though. I had no soap, but knelt and rinsed my hair over and over in the clear dark water, and scrubbed my body with handfuls of fine sand, until my skin felt thin and glowing.</p><p>Finally, I climbed out onto a rocky shelf and lay languid as a mermaid in the moonlight, the heat of the air and the sun-warmed stone now a comfort to my chilled body. I combed out my thick curly hair with my fingers, scattering drops of water. The wet stone smelled like rain, dusty and tingling.</p><p>I felt very tired, but at the same time, very much alive, in that state of half consciousness where thought is slowed and small physical sensations magnified. I moved my bare foot slowly over the sandstone rock, enjoying the slight friction, and ran a hand lightly down the inside of my thigh, a ripple of goose bumps rising in the wake of my touch.</p><p>My br**sts rose in the moonlight, cool white domes spangled with clear droplets. I brushed one nipple and watched it slowly stiffen by itself, rising as if by magic.</p> <p>Quite a magical place at that, I thought. The night was quiet and still, but with a languid atmosphere that was like floating in a warm sea. So near the coast, the sky was clear, and the stars shone overhead like diamonds, burning with a fierce, bright light.</p><p>A faint splash made me look toward the stream. Nothing moved on the surface but faint coruscations of starlight, caught like fireflies in a spider\u2019s web.</p><p>As I watched, a great head broke water in the middle of the stream, water purling back from the pointed snout. There was a fish struggling in Rollo\u2019s jaws; the flap and gleam of its scales showed briefly as he shook his head violently to break its back. The huge dog swam slowly to the shore, shook his coat briefly, and stalked away, his evening meal dangling limp and shimmering from his jaws.</p><p>He paused for a moment on the far edge of the creek, looking at me, the ruff of his hackles a dark shadow framing yellow eyes and gleaming fish. Like a primitive painting, I thought; something from Rousseau, with its contrast of utter wildness and complete stillness.</p><p>Then the dog was gone, and there was nothing on the far shore but the trees, hiding whatever might lie behind them. And what did? I wondered. More trees, answered the logical part of my mind.</p><p>\u201cA lot more,\u201d I murmured, looking into the mysterious dark. Civilization\u2014even of the primitive kind I had grown used to\u2014was no more than a thin crescent on the edge of the continent. Two hundred miles from the coast, you were beyond the ken of city and farm. And, past that point lay three thousand miles...of what? Wilderness, surely, and danger. Adventure, too\u2014and freedom.</p><p>It was a new world, after all, free of fear and filled with joy, for now Jamie and I were together, for all of our lives before us. Parting and sorrow lay behind us. Even the thought of Brianna caused no dreadful regret\u2014I missed her greatly, and thought of her constantly, but I knew she was safe in her own time, and that knowledge made her absence easier to bear.</p><p>I lay back on the rock, the trapped heat of the day radiating from its surface into my body, happy only to be alive. The drops of water were drying on my br**sts as I watched, vanishing to a film of moistness and then disappearing altogether.</p> <p>Small clouds of gnats hovered over the water; I couldn\u2019t see them, but I knew they were there by the occasional splash of leaping fish, rising to snatch them from the air.</p><p>The bugs had been a ubiquitous plague. I inspected Jamie\u2019s skin minutely every morning, picking voracious ticks and wood fleas from his crevices, and anointed all of the men liberally with the juice of crushed pennyroyal and tobacco leaves. This kept them from being devoured alive by the clouds of mosquitoes, gnats, and carnivorous midges that hung in the sun-tinged shadows of the woods, but it didn\u2019t prevent the hordes of inquisitive bugs from driving them mad with a constant tickling inquiry into ears, eyes, noses, and mouths.</p><p>Oddly enough, the majority of insects left me strictly alone. Ian joked that the strong scent of herbs that hung about me must repel them, but I thought it went further than that\u2014even when I was freshly bathed, the insects showed no desire to bother me.</p><p>I thought it might be a manifestation of the evolutionary oddity that\u2014I surmised\u2014protected me from colds and minor illness here. Bloodthirsty bugs, like microbes, evolved very closely with humans, and were sensitive to the subtle chemical signals of their hosts. Coming from another time, I no longer had precisely the same signals, and consequently the bugs no longer perceived me as prey.</p><p>\u201cOr maybe Ian\u2019s right, and I just smell awful,\u201d I said aloud. I dipped my fingers in the water and flicked a spray of drops at a dragonfly resting on my rock, no more than a transparent shadow, its colors drained by darkness.</p><p>I hoped Jamie would hurry. Riding for days on the wagon seat next to him, watching the subtle shifts of his body as he drove, seeing the changing light on the angles of his face as he talked and smiled, was enough to make my palms tingle with the urge to touch him. We had not made love in several days, owing to our hurry to reach Charleston, and my inhibitions about intimacy within earshot of a dozen men.</p><p>A breath of warm breeze slipped past me, and all the tiny down hairs on my body prickled with its passing. No hurry now, and no one to hear. I drew a hand down the soft curve of my belly and the softer skin inside my thighs, where the blood pulsed slowly to the beat of my heart. I cupped my hand, feeling the swollen moist ache of urgent desire.</p><p>I closed my eyes, rubbing lightly, enjoying the feeling of increasing urgency.</p><p>\u201cAnd where the hell are you, Jamie Fraser?\u201d I murmured.</p><p>\u201cHere,\u201d came a husky answer.</p><p>Startled, my eyes popped open. He was standing in the stream, six feet away, thigh-deep in the water, his gen**als stiff and dark against the pallid glow of his body. His hair lay loose around his shoulders, framing a face white as bone, eyes unblinking and intent as those of the wolf-dog. Utter wildness, utter stillness.</p><p>Then he stirred and came toward me, still intent, but still no longer. His thighs were cold as water when he touched me, but within seconds he warmed and grew hot. Sweat sprang up at once where his hands touched my skin, and a flush of hot moisture dampened my br**sts once more, making them round and slick against the hardness of his chest.</p><p>Then his mouth moved to mine and I melted\u2014almost literally\u2014into him. I didn\u2019t care how hot it was, or whether the dampness on my skin was my sweat or his. Even the clouds of insects faded into insignificance. I raised my h*ps and he slid home, slick and solid, the last faint coolness of him quenched by my heat, like the cold metal of a sword, slaked in hot blood.</p><p>My hands glided on a film of moisture over the curves of his back, and my br**sts wobbled against his chest, a rivulet trickling between them to oil the friction of belly and thigh.</p><p>\u201cChrist, your mouth is slick and salty as your quim,\u201d he muttered, and his tongue darted out to taste the tiny beads of salt on my face, butterfly wings on temple and eyelids.</p><p>I was vaguely conscious of the hard rock under me. The stored heat of the day rose up and through me, and the rough surface scraped my back and buttocks, but I didn\u2019t care.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t wait,\u201d he said in my ear, breathless.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d I said, and wrapped my legs tight around his hips, flesh bonded to flesh in the brief madness of dissolution.</p><p>\u201cI have heard of melting with passion,\u201d I said, gasping slightly, \u201cbut this is ridiculous.\u201d</p><p>He lifted his head from my breast with a faint sticky sound as his cheek came away. He laughed and slid slowly sideways.</p><p>\u201cGod, it\u2019s hot!\u201d he said. He pushed back the sweat-soaked hair from his forehead and blew out his breath, chest still heaving from exertion. \u201cHow do folk do that when it\u2019s like this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe same way we just did,\u201d I pointed out. I was breathing heavily myself.</p><p>\u201cThey can\u2019t,\u201d he said with certainty. \u201cNot all the time; they\u2019d die.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, maybe they do it slower,\u201d I said. \u201cOr underwater. Or wait until the autumn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAutumn?\u201d he said. \u201cPerhaps I dinna want to live in the south, after all. Is it hot in Boston?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is at this time of year,\u201d I assured him. \u201cAnd beastly cold in the winter. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll get used to the heat. And the bugs.\u201d</p><p>He brushed a questing mosquito off his shoulder and glanced from me to the nearby creek.</p><p>\u201cMaybe so,\u201d he said, \u201cand maybe no, but for now...\u201d He wrapped his arms firmly around me, and rolled. With the ponderous grace of a rolling log, we fell off the edge of the rocky shelf, and into the water.</p><p>We lay damp and cool on the rock, barely touching, the last drops of water evaporating on our skins. Across the creek, the willows trailed their leaves in the water, crowns ruffled black against the setting moon. Beyond the willows lay acre upon acre and mile upon mile of the virgin forest, civilization for now no more than a foothold on the edge of the continent.</p><p>Jamie saw the direction of my glance and divined my thought.</p><p>\u201cIt will be a good bit different now than when ye last kent it, I expect?\u201d He nodded toward the leafy dark.</p><p>\u201cOh, a bit.\u201d I linked my hand with his, my thumb idly caressing his big, bony knuckles. \u201cThe roads will be paved then; not cobbled, covered with a hard, smooth stuff\u2014invented by a Scotsman called MacAdam, in fact.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He grunted slightly with amusement.</p><p>\u201cSo there will be Scots in America, then? That\u2019s good.\u201d</p><p>I ignored him and went on, staring into the wavering shadows as though I could conjure the burgeoning cities that would one day rise there.</p><p>\u201cThere will be a lot of everyone in America, then. All the land will be settled, from here to the far west coast, to a place called California. But for now\u201d\u2014I shivered slightly, in spite of the warm, humid air\u2014\u201cit\u2019s three thousand miles of wilderness. There\u2019s nothing there at all.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAye, well, nothing save thousands of bloodthirsty savages,\u201d he said practically. \u201cAnd the odd vicious beast, to be sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, yes,\u201d I agreed. \u201cI suppose they are.\u201d The thought was unsettling; I had of course known, in a vague, academic way, that the woods were inhabited by Indians, bears, and other forest denizens, but this general notion had suddenly been replaced by a particular and most acute awareness that we might easily\u2014and unexpectedly\u2014meet any one of these denizens, face-to-face.</p><p>\u201cWhat happens to them? To the wild Indians?\u201d Jamie asked curiously, peering into the dark as I was, as though trying to divine the future among the shifting shadows. \u201cThey\u2019ll be defeated and driven back, will they?\u201d</p><p>Another small shiver passed over me, and my toes curled.</p><p>\u201cYes, they will,\u201d I said. \u201cKilled, a lot of them. A good many taken prisoner, locked up.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI expect that depends a lot on your point of view,\u201d I said, rather dryly. \u201cI don\u2019t suppose the Indians will think so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI daresay,\u201d he said. \u201cBut when a bloody fiend\u2019s tryin\u2019 his best to chop off the top of my head, I\u2019m no so much concerned with his point of view, Sassenach.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you can\u2019t really blame them,\u201d I protested.</p><p>\u201cI most certainly can,\u201d he assured me. \u201cIf one of the brutes scalps ye, I shall blame him a great deal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh...hmm,\u201d I said. I cleared my throat and had another stab at it. \u201cWell, what if a bunch of strangers came round and tried to kill you and shove you off the land you\u2019d always lived on?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThey have,\u201d he said, very dryly indeed. \u201cIf they hadna, I should still be in Scotland, aye?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell...\u201d I said, floundering. \u201cBut all I mean is\u2014you\u2019d fight, too, under those circumstances, wouldn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>He drew a deep breath and exhaled strongly through his nose.</p><p>\u201cIf an English dragoon came round to my house and began to worry me,\u201d he said precisely, \u201cI should certainly fight him. I would also have not the slightest hesitation in killing him. I would not cut off his hair and wave it about, and I wouldna be eating his private parts, either. I am not a savage, Sassenach.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t say you were,\u201d I protested. \u201cAll I said was\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBesides,\u201d he added with inexorable logic, \u201cI dinna mean to be killing any Indians. If they keep to themselves, I shallna be worrying them a bit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure they\u2019ll be relieved to know that,\u201d I murmured, giving up for the present.</p><p>We lay cradled close together in the hollow of the rock, lightly glued with sweat, watching the stars. I felt at once shatteringly happy and mildly apprehensive. Could this state of exaltation possibly last? Once I had taken \u201cforever\u201d for granted between us, but I was younger, then.</p> <p>Soon, God willing, we would settle; find a place to make a home and a life. I wanted nothing more, and yet at the same time, I worried. We had known each other only a few months since my return. Each touch, each word was still at once tinged with memory and new with rediscovery. What would happen when we were thoroughly accustomed to each other, living day by day in a routine of mundane tasks?</p><p>\u201cWill ye grow tired of me, do ye think?\u201d he murmured. \u201cOnce we\u2019re settled?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was just wondering the same thing about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said, and I could hear the smile in his voice. \u201cThat I willna, Sassenach.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t,\u201d he pointed out. \u201cBefore. We were wed three years, and I wanted ye as much on the last day as the first. More, maybe,\u201d he added softly, thinking, as I was, of the last time we had made love before he sent me through the stones.</p><p>I leaned down and kissed him. He tasted clean and fresh, faintly scented with the pungency of sex.</p><p>\u201cI did, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen dinna trouble yourself about it, Sassenach, and neither will I.\u201d He stroked my hair, smoothing damp curls off my forehead. \u201cI could know ye all my life, I think, and always love you. And often as I\u2019ve lain wi\u2019 you, ye still surprise me mightily sometimes, like ye did tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do? Why, what have I done?\u201d I stared down at him, surprised myself.</p><p>\u201cOh...well. I didna mean...that is\u2014\u201d</p><p>He sounded suddenly shy, and there was an unaccustomed stiffness in his body.</p><p>\u201cMm?\u201d I kissed the tip of his ear.</p><p>\u201cAh...when I came upon you...what ye were doing...I mean\u2014were ye doing what I thought?\u201d</p><p>I smiled against his shoulder in the darkness.</p><p>\u201cI suppose that depends what you thought, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>He lifted up on one elbow, his skin coming away from mine with a small sucking noise. The damp spot where he had adhered was suddenly cool. He rolled onto his side and grinned at me.</p><p>\u201cYe ken verra well what I thought, Sassenach.\u201d</p><p>I touched his chin, shadowed with sprouting whiskers.</p><p>\u201cI do. And you know perfectly well what I was doing, too, so why are you asking?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2014I didna think women did that, is all.\u201d</p><p>The moon was bright enough for me to see his half-cocked eyebrow.</p><p>\u201cWell, men do,\u201d I pointed out. \u201cOr you do, at least. You told me so\u2014when you were in prison, you said you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was different!\u201d I could see his mouth twist as he tried to decide what to say. \u201cI\u2014that is to say, there wasna any help for it then. After all, I couldna be\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHaven\u2019t you done it other times?\u201d I sat up and fluffed out my damp hair, glancing sidelong at him over my shoulder. A blush didn\u2019t show in the moonlight, but I thought he had gone pink.</p><p>\u201cAye, well,\u201d he muttered. \u201cI suppose I have, yes.\u201d A sudden thought struck him and his eyes widened, looking at me. \u201cDo you\u2014have ye done that\u2014often?\u201d The last word emerged in a croak, and he was obliged to stop and clear his throat.</p><p>\u201cI suppose it depends on what you mean by \u2018often,\u2019 \u201d I said, allowing a bit of acerbity to creep into my tone. \u201cI was widowed for two years, you know.\u201d</p><p>He rubbed a knuckle over his lips, eyeing me with interest.</p><p>\u201cAye, that\u2019s so. It\u2019s only\u2014well, I hadna thought of women doing such a thing, is all.\u201d Growing fascination was overcoming his surprise. \u201cYou can\u2014finish? Without a man, I mean?\u201d</p><p>That made me laugh out loud, and soft reverberations sounded from the trees around us, echoed by the stream.</p><p>\u201cYes, but it\u2019s much nicer with a man,\u201d I assured him. I reached out and touched his chest. I could see the goose bumps ripple over his chest and shoulders, and he shivered slightly as I drew a fingertip in a gentle circle round one nipple. \u201cMuch,\u201d I said softly.</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d he said, sounding happy. \u201cWell, that\u2019s good, aye?\u201d</p><p>He was hot\u2014even hotter than the liquid air\u2014and my first instinct was to draw back, but I didn\u2019t follow it. Sweat sprang up at once where his hands rested on my skin, and trickles of sweat ran down my neck.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never made love to ye before like this,\u201d he said. \u201cLike eels, aye? Wi\u2019 your body sliding through my hands, all slippery as seaweed.\u201d Both hands passed slowly down my back, his thumbs pressing the groove of my spine, making the tiny hairs at the base of my neck prickle with pleasure.</p><p>\u201cMm. That\u2019s because it\u2019s too cold in Scotland to sweat like pigs,\u201d I said. \u201cThough come to that, do pigs really sweat? I\u2019ve always wondered.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI couldna say; I\u2019ve never made love to a pig.\u201d His head ducked down and his tongue touched my breast. \u201cBut ye do taste a bit like a trout, Sassenach.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI taste like a what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFresh and sweet, wi\u2019 a bit of salt,\u201d he explained, lifting his head for a moment. He put it back down, and resumed his downward course.</p><p>\u201cThat tickles,\u201d I said, quivering under his tongue, but making no effort to escape.</p><p>\u201cWell, I mean it to,\u201d he answered, lifting his wet face for a breath before returning to his work. \u201cI shouldna like to think ye could do without me entirely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d I assured him. \u201cOh!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh?\u201d came a thick interrogative. I lay back on the rock, my back arching as the stars spun dizzily overhead.</p><p>\u201cI said...\u2018oh,\u2019 \u201d I said faintly. And then didn\u2019t say anything coherent for some time, until he lay panting, chin resting lightly on my pubic bone. I reached down and stroked the sweat-drenched hair away from his face, and he turned his head to kiss my palm.</p><p>\u201cI feel like Eve,\u201d I said softly, watching the moon set behind him, over the dark of the forest. \u201cJust on the edge of the Garden of Eden.\u201d</p><p>There was a small snort of laughter from the vicinity of my navel.</p><p>\u201cAye, and I suppose I\u2019m Adam,\u201d Jamie said. \u201cIn the gateway to Paradise.\u201d He turned his head to look wistfully across the creek toward the vast unknown, resting his cheek on the slope of my belly. \u201cI only wish I knew was I coming in, or going out?\u201d</p><p>I laughed myself, startling him. I took him by both ears then, urging him gently up across the slippery expanse of my nak*d flesh.</p><p>\u201cIn,\u201d I said. \u201cI don\u2019t see an angel with a fiery sword, after all.\u201d</p><p>He lowered himself upon me, his own flesh heated as with fever, and I shivered under him.</p><p>\u201cNo?\u201d he murmured. \u201cAye, well, you\u2019ll no be looking close enough, I suppose.\u201d</p><p>Then the fiery sword severed me from consciousness and set fire to my body. We blazed up together, bright as stars in the summer night, and then sank back burnt and limbless, ashes dissolved in a primordial sea of warm salt, stirring with the nascent throbbings of life.</p><p>PART TWO</p><p>Past Imperfect</p><p>3</p><p>THE MINISTER\u2019S CAT</p><p>Boston, Massachusetts, June 1969</p><p>Brianna?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHa?\u201d She sat bolt upright, heart pounding, the sound of her name ringing in her ear. \u201cWho\u2014wha\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were asleep. Damn, I knew I\u2019d got the time wrong! Sorry, shall I ring off?\u201d</p><p>It was the faint hint of a burr in his voice that belatedly made the scrambled connections of her nervous system fall into place. Phone. Ringing phone. She\u2019d snatched it by reflex, deep in her dream.</p><p>\u201cRoger!\u201d The rush of adrenaline from being startled awake was fading, but her heart was still beating fast. \u201cNo, don\u2019t hang up! It\u2019s all right, I\u2019m awake.\u201d She scrubbed a hand over her face, trying at once to disentangle the phone cord and straighten the rumpled bedclothes. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAye? You\u2019re sure? What time is it there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know; it\u2019s too dark to see the clock,\u201d she said, still sleep-addled. A reluctant deep chuckle answered her.</p><p>\u201cI am sorry; I tried to calculate the time difference, but must\u2019ve got it backward. Didn\u2019t mean to wake you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s okay, I had to wake up to answer the phone anyway,\u201d she assured him, and laughed.</p> <p>\u201cAye. Well...\u201d She could hear the answering smile in his voice, and eased herself back against the pillows, shoving tangles of hair out of her eyes, slowly adjusting to the here and now. The feel of her dream was still with her, more real than the dark-shrouded shapes of her bedroom.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s good to hear your voice, Roger,\u201d she said softly. She was surprised at just how good it was. His voice was far away and yet seemed much more immediate than the far-off whines of sirens, and the whish! of tires on wet pavement outside.</p><p>\u201cYours, too.\u201d He sounded a little shy. \u201cLook\u2014I\u2019ve got the chance of a conference next month, in Boston. I thought of coming, if\u2014damn, there\u2019s no good way to say this. Do you want to see me?\u201d</p><p>Her hand squeezed tight on the receiver, and her heart jumped.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he said at once, before she could reply. \u201cThat\u2019s putting you on the spot, isn\u2019t it? I\u2014look\u2014just say straight out if you\u2019d rather not.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI do. Of course I want to see you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh. You don\u2019t mind, then? Only...you didn\u2019t answer my letter. I thought maybe I\u2019d done something\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you didn\u2019t. I\u2019m sorry. It was just\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine, I didn\u2019t mean\u2014\u201d</p><p>Their sentences collided, and they both stopped, stricken with shyness.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t want to push\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean to be\u2014\u201d</p><p>It happened again, and this time he laughed, a low sound of Scottish amusement coming over the vast distance of space and time, comforting as though he\u2019d touched her.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right, then,\u201d he said firmly. \u201cI do understand, aye?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t answer, but closed her eyes, an indefinable sensation of relief sweeping over her. Roger Wakefield was likely the only person in the world who could understand; what she hadn\u2019t fully realized before was how important that understanding might be.</p><p>\u201cI was dreaming,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen the phone rang.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmphm?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout my father.\u201d Her throat tightened, just a little, whenever she spoke the word. The same thing happened when she said \u201cmother,\u201d too. She could still smell the sun-warmed pines of her dream, and feel the crunch of pine needles under her boots.</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t see his face. I was walking with him, in the woods somewhere. I was following him up a trail, and he was talking to me, but I couldn\u2019t hear what he was saying\u2014I kept hurrying, trying to catch up, so I could hear, but I couldn\u2019t quite manage.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut you knew the man was your father?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes\u2014but maybe I only thought so because of hiking in the mountains. I used to do that with Dad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you? I used to do that with my dad, as well. If you come back to Scotland ever, I\u2019ll take ye Munro bagging.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll take me what?\u201d</p><p>He laughed, and she had a sudden memory of him, brushing back the thick black hair that he didn\u2019t cut often enough, moss-green eyes creased half-shut by his smile. She found she was rubbing the tip of her thumb slowly across her lower lip, and stopped herself. He\u2019d kissed her when they parted.</p><p>\u201cA Munro is any Scottish peak more than three thousand feet. There are so many of them, it\u2019s a sport to see how many you can climb. Folk collect them, like stamps, or matchbooks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere are you now\u2014Scotland or England?\u201d she said, then interrupted before he could answer. \u201cNo, let me see if I can guess. It\u2019s...Scotland. You\u2019re in Inverness.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d The surprise was evident in his voice. \u201cHow did you know that?\u201d</p><p>She stretched, scissoring her long legs slowly under the sheets.</p><p>\u201cYou roll your r\u2019s when you\u2019ve been talking to other Scots,\u201d she said. \u201cYou don\u2019t when you talk to English people. I noticed when we\u2014went to London.\u201d There was no more than a faint catch in her voice; it was getting easier, she thought.</p><p>\u201cAnd herrrrre I was beginning to think ye were psychic,\u201d he said, and laughed.</p><p>\u201cI wish you were here now,\u201d she said impulsively.</p><p>\u201cYou do?\u201d He sounded surprised, and suddenly shy. \u201cOh. Well...that\u2019s good, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRoger\u2014why I didn\u2019t write\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not to trouble about it,\u201d he said quickly. \u201cI\u2019ll be there in a month; we can talk, then. Bree, I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>She heard him draw breath, and had a vivid memory of the feel of his chest rising and falling as he breathed, warm and solid under her hand.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you said yes.\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t go back to sleep after hanging up; restless, she swung her feet out of bed and padded out to the kitchen of the small apartment for a glass of milk. It was only after several minutes of staring blankly into the recesses of the refrigerator that she realized she wasn\u2019t seeing ranks of ketchup bottles and half-used cans. She was seeing standing stones, black against a pale dawn sky.</p><p>She straightened up with a small exclamation of impatience, and shut the door with a slam. She shivered slightly, and rubbed her arms, chilled by the draft of the air conditioner. Impulsively, she reached up and clicked it off, then went to the window and raised the sash, letting in the warm mugginess of the rainy summer night.</p><p>She should have written. In fact, she had written\u2014several times, all half-finished attempts thrown away in frustration.</p><p>She knew why, or thought she did. Explaining it coherently to Roger was something else.</p><p>Part of it was the simple instinct of a wounded animal; the urge to run away and hide from hurt. What had happened the year before was in no way Roger\u2019s fault, but he was inextricably wrapped up in it.</p><p>He\u2019d been so tender, and so kind afterward, treating her like one freshly bereaved\u2014which she was. But such a strange bereavement! Her mother gone for good, but certainly\u2014she hoped\u2014not dead. And yet it was in some ways just as it had been when her father died; like believing in a blessed afterlife, ardently hoping that your loved one was safe and happy\u2014and being forced to suffer the pangs of loss and loneliness nonetheless.</p><p>An ambulance went by, across the park, red light pulsing in the dark, its siren muted by distance.</p><p>She crossed herself from habit, and murmured \u201cMiserere nobis\u201d under her breath. Sister Marie Romaine had told the fifth grade that the dead and dying needed their prayers; so strongly had she inculcated the notion in her class that none of the children had ever been able to pass the scene of an emergency without sending a small silent prayer upward, to succor the souls of the imminently heaven-bound.</p><p>She prayed for them every day, her mother and her father\u2014her fathers. That was the other part of it. Uncle Joe knew the truth of her paternity, too, but only Roger could truly understand what had happened; only Roger could hear the stones, too.</p><p>No one could pass through an experience like that and not be marked by it. Not him, not her. He\u2019d wanted her to stay, after Claire had gone, but she couldn\u2019t.</p><p>There were things to do here, she\u2019d told him, things to be attended to, her schooling to finish. That was true. More importantly, she\u2019d had to get away\u2014get clear away from Scotland and stone circles, back to a place where she might heal, might begin to rebuild her life.</p><p>If she\u2019d stayed with Roger, there was no way to forget what had happened, even for a moment. And that was the last part of it, the final piece in her three-sided puzzle.</p><p>He had protected her, had cherished her. Her mother had confided her into his care, and he\u2019d kept that trust well. But had he done it to keep his promise to Claire\u2014or because he truly cared? Either way, it wasn\u2019t any basis for a shared future, with the crushing weight of obligation on both sides.</p><p>If there might be a future for them...and that was what she couldn\u2019t write to him, because how could she say it without sounding both presumptuous and idiotic?</p><p>\u201cGo away, so you can come back and do it right,\u201d she murmured, and made a face at the words. The rain was still pattering down, cooling the air enough to breathe comfortably. It was just before dawn, she thought, but the air was still warm enough that moisture condensed on the cool skin of her face; small beads of water formed and slid tickling down her neck one by one, dampening the cotton T-shirt she slept in.</p><p>She\u2019d wanted to put the events of last November well behind them; make a clean break. Then, when enough time had passed, perhaps they could come to each other again. Not as supporting players in the drama of her parents\u2019 life, but this time as the actors in a play of their own choosing.</p><p>No, if anything was to happen between her and Roger Wakefield, it would definitely be by choice. It looked as though she was going to get the chance to choose now, and the prospect gave her a small, excited flutter in the pit of her stomach.</p><p>She wiped a hand over her face, slicking off the rain-wet, wiping it casually through her hair to tame the floating strands. If she wasn\u2019t going to sleep, she might as well work.</p><p>She left the window open, careless of the rain puddling on the floor. She felt too restless to be sealed in, chilled by artificial air.</p><p>Clicking on the lamp on the desk, she pulled out her calculus book and opened it. One small and unexpected bonus of her change of study was her belated discovery of the soothing effects of mathematics.</p><p>When she had come back to Boston, alone, and back to school, engineering had seemed a much safer choice than history; solid, fact-bound, reassuringly immutable. Above all, controllable. She picked up a pencil, sharpened it slowly, enjoying the preparation, then bent her head and read the first problem.</p><p>Slowly, as it always did, the calm inexorable logic of the figures built its web inside her head, trapping all the random thoughts, wrapping the distracting emotions up in silken threads like so many flies. Round the central axis of the problem, logic spun her web, orderly and beautiful as an orb-weaver\u2019s jeweled confection. Only the one small thought stayed free of its strands, hovering in her mind like a bright, tiny butterfly.</p><p>I\u2019m glad you said yes, he\u2019d said. So was she.</p><p>July 1969</p><p>\u201cDoes he talk like the Beatles? Oh, I\u2019ll just die if he sounds like John Lennon! You know how he says, \u2018It\u2019s me grandfather?\u2019 That just knocks me out!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t sound anything like John Lennon, for God\u2019s sake!\u201d Brianna hissed. She peered cautiously around a concrete pillar, but the International Arrivals gate was still empty. \u201cCan\u2019t you tell the difference between a Liverpudlian and a Scot?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d her friend Gayle said blithely, fluffing out her blond hair. \u201cAll Englishmen sound the same to me. I could listen to them forever!\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s not an Englishman! I told you, he\u2019s a Scot!\u201d</p><p>Gayle gave Brianna a look, clearly suggesting that her friend was crazed.</p><p>\u201cScotland\u2019s part of England; I looked on the map.\u201d</p><p>\u201cScotland\u2019s part of Great Britain, not England.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the difference?\u201d Gayle stuck her head out and craned around the pillar. \u201cWhy are we standing back here? He\u2019ll never see us.\u201d</p><p>Brianna ran a hand over her hair to smooth it. They were standing behind a pillar because she wasn\u2019t sure she wanted him to see them. Not much help for it, though; disheveled passengers were beginning to trickle through the double doors, burdened with luggage.</p><p>She let Gayle tow her out into the main reception area, still babbling. Her friend\u2019s tongue led a double life; though Gayle was capable of cool and reasoned discourse in class, her chief social skill was babbling on cue. That was why Bree had asked Gayle to come with her to the airport to pick up Roger; no chance of any awkward pauses in the conversation.</p><p>\u201cHave you done it with him already?\u201d</p><p>She jerked toward Gayle, startled.</p> <p>\u201cHave I done what?\u201d</p><p>Gayle rolled her eyes.</p><p>\u201cPlayed tiddlywinks. Honestly, Bree!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Of course not.\u201d She felt the blood rising in her cheeks.</p><p>\u201cWell, are you going to?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGayle!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell, I mean, you have your own apartment and everything, and nobody\u2019s going to\u2014\u201d</p><p>At this awkward moment, Roger Wakefield appeared. He wore a white shirt and scruffy jeans, and Brianna must have stiffened at the sight of him. Gayle\u2019s head whipped round to see where Brianna was looking.</p><p>\u201cOoh,\u201d she said in delight. \u201cIs that him? He looks like a pirate!\u201d</p><p>He did, and Brianna felt the bottom of her stomach drop another inch or two. Roger was what her mother called a Black Celt, with clear olive skin and black hair, and \u201ceyes put in with a sooty thumb\u201d\u2014thick black lashes round eyes you expected to be blue but that were instead a surprising deep green. With his hair worn long enough to brush his collar, disheveled and beard-stubbled, he looked not only rakish but mildly dangerous.</p><p>Alarm tingled up her spine at the sight of him, and she wiped sweating palms on the sides of her embroidered jeans. She shouldn\u2019t have let him come.</p><p>Then he saw her, and his face lit like a candle. In spite of herself, she felt a huge, idiotic smile break out on her own face in answer, and without stopping to think of misgivings, she ran across the room, dodging stray children and luggage carts.</p><p>He met her halfway and swept her almost off her feet, hugging her hard enough to crack her ribs. He kissed her, stopped, and kissed her again, the stubble of his beard scraping her face. He smelled of soap and sweat and he tasted like Scotch whisky and she didn\u2019t want him to stop.</p><p>Then he did and let go, both of them half breathless.</p> <p>\u201cA-hem,\u201d said a loud voice near Brianna\u2019s elbow. She swung away from Roger, revealing Gayle, who smiled angelically up at him under blond bangs, and waved like a child going bye-bye.</p><p>\u201cHell-ooo,\u201d she said. \u201cYou must be Roger, because if you\u2019re not, Roger\u2019s sure in for a shock when he shows up, isn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>She looked him up and down with obvious approval.</p><p>\u201cAll that, and you play the guitar, too?\u201d</p><p>Brianna hadn\u2019t even noticed the case he had dropped. He stooped and picked it up, swinging it over his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s my bread and butter, this trip,\u201d he said, with a smile at Gayle, who clutched a hand to her heart in simulated ecstasy.</p><p>\u201cOoh, say that again!\u201d she begged.</p><p>\u201cSay what?\u201d Roger looked puzzled.</p><p>\u201cBread and butter,\u201d Brianna told him, hoisting one of his bags onto her shoulder. \u201cShe wants to hear you roll the r\u2019s again. Gayle has a thing about British accents. Oh\u2014that\u2019s Gayle.\u201d She gestured at her friend in resignation.</p><p>\u201cYes, I gathered. Er...\u201d He cleared his throat, fixed Gayle with a piercing stare, and dropped his voice an octave. \u201cArround the rrruggged rrrock, the rrragged rrrascals rran. That do you for a bit?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you stop that?\u201d Brianna looked crossly at her friend, who had swooned dramatically into one of the plastic seats. \u201cIgnore her,\u201d she advised Roger, turning toward the door. With a cautious glance at Gayle, he took her advice, and picking up a large box tied with string, followed her into the concourse.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you mean about your bread and butter?\u201d she asked, looking for some way to return the conversation to a sane footing.</p><p>He laughed, a little self-consciously.</p><p>\u201cWell, the historical conference is paying the airfare, but they couldn\u2019t manage expenses. So I called round, and wangled a bit of a job to take care of that end.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA job playing the guitar?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy day, mild-mannered historian Roger Wakefield is a harmless Oxford academic. But at night, he dons his secret tartan rrregalia and becomes the dashing\u2014Roger MacKenzie!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d</p><p>He smiled at her surprise. \u201cWell, I do a bit of Scottish folk-singing, for festivals and ceilidhs\u2014High Games and the like. I\u2019m on to do a turn at a Celtic festival up in the mountains at the end of the week, is all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cScottish singing? Do you wear a kilt when you sing?\u201d Gayle had popped up on Roger\u2019s other side.</p><p>\u201cI do indeed. How else would they know I was a Scotsman?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just love fuzzy knees,\u201d Gayle said dreamily. \u201cNow, tell me, is it true about what a Scotsman\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo get the car,\u201d Brianna ordered, hastily thrusting her keys at Gayle.</p><p>Gayle perched her chin on the windowsill of the car, watching Roger make his way into the hotel. \u201cGee, I hope he doesn\u2019t shave before he meets us for dinner. I just love the way men look when they haven\u2019t shaved for a while. What do you think\u2019s in that big box?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis bodhran. I asked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a Celtic war drum. He plays it with some of his songs.\u201d</p><p>Gayle\u2019s lips formed a small circle of speculation.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t suppose you want me to drive him to this festival thing, do you? I mean, you must have lots of things to do, and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHa ha. You think I\u2019d let you anywhere around him in a kilt?\u201d</p><p>Gayle sighed wistfully, and pulled her head in as Brianna started the car.</p><p>\u201cWell, maybe there\u2019d be other men there in kilts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think that\u2019s pretty likely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI bet they don\u2019t have Celtic war drums, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe not.\u201d</p><p>Gayle leaned back in her seat, and glanced at her friend.</p><p>\u201cSo, are you going to do it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow should I know?\u201d But the blood bloomed under her skin, and her clothes felt too tight.</p><p>\u201cWell, if you don\u2019t,\u201d Gayle said positively, \u201cyou\u2019re crazy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Minister\u2019s cat is an...androgynous cat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Minister\u2019s cat is an...alagruous cat.\u201d</p><p>Bree gave him a lifted brow, taking her eyes briefly off the road.</p><p>\u201cScots again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a Scottish game,\u201d Roger said. \u201cAlagruous\u2014\u2018grim or woebegone.\u2019 Your turn. Letter \u2018B.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>She squinted through the windshield at the narrow mountain road. The morning sun was toward them, filling the car with light.</p><p>\u201cThe Minister\u2019s cat is a brindled cat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Minister\u2019s cat is a bonnie cat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s a soft pitch for both of us. Draw. Okay, the Minister\u2019s cat is a...\u201d He could see the wheels turning in her mind, then the gleam in her narrowed blue eyes as inspiration struck. \u201c...coccygodynious cat.\u201d</p><p>Roger narrowed his own eyes, trying to work that one out.</p><p>\u201cA cat with a wide backside?\u201d</p><p>She laughed, braking slightly as the car hit a switchback curve.</p><p>\u201cA cat that\u2019s a pain in the ass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a real word, is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh.\u201d She accelerated neatly out of the turn. \u201cOne of Mama\u2019s medical terms. Coccygodynia is a pain in the region of the tailbone. She used to call the hospital administration coccygodynians, all the time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd here I thought it was one of your engineering terms. All right, then...the Minister\u2019s cat is a camstairy cat.\u201d He grinned at her lifted eyebrow. \u201cQuarrelsome. Coccygodynians are camstairy by nature.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, I\u2019ll call that one a draw. The Minister\u2019s cat is...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait,\u201d Roger interrupted, pointing. \u201cThere\u2019s the turn.\u201d</p><p>Slowing, she pulled off the narrow highway and onto a still narrower road, indicated by a small red-and-white-arrowed sign that read CELTIC FESTIVAL.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a love to bring to me all the way up here,\u201d Roger said. \u201cI didn\u2019t realize how far it was, or I\u2019d never have asked.\u201d</p><p>She gave him a brief glance of amusement.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that far.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a hundred and fifty miles!\u201d</p><p>She smiled, but with a wry edge to it.</p><p>\u201cMy father always said that was the difference between an American and an Englishman. An Englishman thinks a hundred miles is a long way; an American thinks a hundred years is a long time.\u201d</p><p>Roger laughed, taken by surprise.</p><p>\u201cToo right. You\u2019ll be an American, then, I suppose?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose.\u201d But her smile had faded.</p><p>So had the conversation; they drove in silence for a few minutes, with no sound but the rush of tires and wind. It was a beautiful hot summer\u2019s day, the mugginess of Boston left far below as they snaked their way upward, into the clearer air of the mountains.</p><p>\u201cThe Minister\u2019s cat is a distant cat,\u201d Roger said at last, softly. \u201cHave I said something wrong?\u201d</p><p>She flashed him a quick blue glance, and a half-curled mouth.</p><p>\u201cThe Minister\u2019s cat is a daydreaming cat. No, it\u2019s not you.\u201d Her lips compressed as she slowed behind another car, then relaxed. \u201cNo, that\u2019s not right\u2014it is you, but it\u2019s not your fault.\u201d</p><p>Roger shifted, turning in his seat to face her.</p><p>\u201cThe Minister\u2019s cat is an enigmatic cat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Minister\u2019s cat is an embarrassed cat\u2014I shouldn\u2019t have said anything, sorry.\u201d</p><p>Roger was wise enough not to press her. Instead, he leaned forward and dug under the seat for the thermos of hot tea with lemon.</p><p>\u201cWant some?\u201d He offered her the cup, but she made a small face and shook her head.</p><p>\u201cNo thanks. I hate tea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDefinitely not an Englishwoman, then,\u201d he said, and wished he hadn\u2019t; her hands squeezed tight on the wheel. She didn\u2019t say anything, though, and he drank the tea in silence, watching her.</p><p>She didn\u2019t look English, her parentage and coloring notwithstanding. He couldn\u2019t tell whether the difference was more than a matter of clothes, but he thought so. Americans seemed so much more...what? Vibrant? Intense? Bigger? Just more. Brianna Randall was definitely more. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The traffic grew thicker, slowing to a crawling line of cars as they reached the entrance to the resort where the festival was being held.</p><p>\u201cLook,\u201d Brianna said abruptly. She didn\u2019t turn toward him, but stared out through the windshield at the New Jersey license plate of the car in front of them. \u201cI have to explain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot to me.\u201d</p><p>She flicked one red eyebrow in brief irritation.</p> <p>\u201cTo who else?\u201d She pressed her lips together and sighed. \u201cYeah, all right, me too. But I do.\u201d</p><p>Roger could taste the acid from the tea, bitter in the back of his throat. Was this where she told him it had been a mistake for him to come? He\u2019d thought so himself, all the way across the Atlantic, twitching and cramped in the tiny airline seat. Then he\u2019d seen her across the airport lobby, and all doubt had vanished on the instant.</p><p>It hadn\u2019t come back during the intervening week, either; he\u2019d seen her at least briefly every day\u2014even managed a baseball game with her at Fenway Park on Thursday afternoon. He\u2019d found the game itself baffling, but Brianna\u2019s enthusiasm for it enchanting. He found himself counting the hours left before he\u2019d have to leave, and looking forward nonetheless to this\u2014the only whole day they\u2019d have together.</p><p>That didn\u2019t mean she felt the same. He glanced quickly over the line of cars; the gate was visible, but still a quarter-mile off. He had maybe three minutes to convince her.</p><p>\u201cIn Scotland,\u201d she was saying, \u201cwhen all\u2014that\u2014happened with my mother. You were great, Roger\u2014really wonderful.\u201d She didn\u2019t look at him, but he could see a shimmer of moisture just above the thick auburn lashes.</p> <p>\u201cIt was no great thing to do,\u201d he said. He curled his hands into fists to keep from touching her. \u201cI was interested.\u201d</p><p>She laughed shortly.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I bet you were.\u201d She slowed, and turned her head to look at him, full-on. Even wide open, her eyes had a faint catlike slant to them.</p><p>\u201cHave you been back to the stone circle? To Craigh na Dun?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said shortly. Then coughed and added, as if casually, \u201cI don\u2019t go up to Inverness all that often; it\u2019s been term time at College.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t that the Minister\u2019s cat is a fraidycat?\u201d she asked, but she smiled slightly when she said it.</p> <p>\u201cThe Minister\u2019s cat is scared stiff of that place,\u201d he said frankly. \u201cHe wouldn\u2019t set foot up there if it were knee-deep in sardines.\u201d She laughed outright, and the tension between them eased noticeably.</p><p>\u201cMe too,\u201d she said, and took a deep breath. \u201cBut I remember. All the trouble you went to, to help\u2014and then, when it\u2014when she\u2014when Mama went through\u2014\u201d Her teeth clamped savagely on her lower lip, and she hit the brake, harder than necessary.</p><p>\u201cDo you see?\u201d she said, in a small voice. \u201cI can\u2019t be around you more than half an hour, and it all comes back. I haven\u2019t talked about my parents in more than six months, and no sooner do we start playing that silly game than I\u2019ve mentioned both of them in less than a minute. It\u2019s been happening all week.\u201d</p><p>She thumbed a loose strand of red hair off her shoulder. She went a lovely pink when she was excited or upset, and the color was burning high in her cheeks.</p><p>\u201cI thought it might be something like that\u2014when you didn\u2019t answer my letter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t only that.\u201d She caught her lower lip between her teeth, as though to bite back the words, but it was too late. A brilliant tide of red washed up out of the V of her white T-shirt, turning her the color of the tomato sauce she insisted on eating with chips.</p><p>He reached across the seat and gently brushed the veil of hair back from her face.</p><p>\u201cI had a terrible crush on you,\u201d she blurted, staring straight ahead through the windshield. \u201cBut I didn\u2019t know whether you were just being nice to me because Mama asked you to, or whether\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhether,\u201d he interrupted, and smiled as she risked a tiny look at him. \u201cDefinitely whether.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d She relaxed fractionally, loosening her stranglehold on the wheel. \u201cWell. Good.\u201d</p><p>He wanted to take her hand, but didn\u2019t want to pry it off the wheel and cause an accident. Instead, he laid his arm across the back of the seat, letting his fingers brush her shoulder.</p><p>\u201cAnyway. I didn\u2019t think\u2014I thought\u2014well, it was either throw myself into your arms or get the hell out of Dodge. So I did, but I couldn\u2019t figure out how to explain without looking like an idiot, and then when you wrote, it was worse\u2014well, see, I do look like an idiot!\u201d</p><p>Roger flipped open the catch of his seat belt.</p><p>\u201cWill you drive into that car in front of us if I kiss you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d He slid across the seat, took her chin in one hand, and kissed her, fast. They bumped sedately over the dirt road and into the parking lot.</p><p>She was breathing easier, and her color had receded a little. She pulled neatly into a parking slot, killed the motor, and sat for a moment, looking straight ahead. Then she opened her seat belt and turned to him.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t until they got out of the car several minutes later that it occurred to Roger that she had mentioned her parents more than once\u2014but the real problem had likely more to do with the parent she so carefully hadn\u2019t mentioned.</p><p>Great, he thought, absently admiring her backside as she bent to open the trunk. She\u2019s trying not to think of Jamie Fraser, and where the hell do you bring her? He glanced at the entrance to the resort, where the Union Jack and the Saltire of Scotland snapped in the summer breeze. From the mountainside beyond came the mournful sound of bagpipes playing.</p><p>4</p><p>A BLAST FROM THE PAST</p><p>Used as he was to changing in the back of someone\u2019s horse van or in the Gents\u2019 facilities of a pub, the small backstage cubicle allotted to Roger\u2019s personal use seemed remarkably luxurious. It was clean, it had hooks for his street clothes, and there were no drunken patrons snoring on the threshold. Of course, this was America, he reflected, unbuttoning his jeans and dropping them on the floor. Different standards, at least with regard to material comforts.</p><p>He yanked the bell-sleeved shirt over his head, wondering just what level of comfort Brianna was accustomed to. He was no judge of women\u2019s clothing\u2014how expensive could blue jeans possibly be?\u2014but he knew a bit about cars. Hers was a brand-new blue Mustang that made him itch to take the wheel.</p><p>Plainly her parents had left her enough to live on; he could trust Claire Randall to have seen to that. He only hoped it wasn\u2019t so much that she might think him interested on that account. Reminded of her parents, he glanced at the brown envelope; should he give it to her, after all?</p><p>The Minister\u2019s cat had nearly jumped out of her skin when they\u2019d walked through the performers\u2019 entrance and come face-to-face with the 78th Fraser Highlanders\u2019 pipe-band from Canada, practicing at full blast behind the dressing rooms. She\u2019d actually gone pale when he\u2019d introduced her to the pipe major, an old acquaintance. Not that Bill Livingstone was intimidating on his own; it was the Fraser clan badge on his chest that had done it.</p><p>Je suis prest, it said. I am ready. Not nearly ready enough, Roger thought, and wanted to kick himself for bringing her.</p><p>Still, she had assured him she\u2019d be all right exploring on her own while he dressed and got himself up for his turn.</p><p>And he\u2019d best turn his mind to that, too, he thought, snugging the buckles of his kilt at waist and hip, and reaching for the long woolen stockings. He was on in the early afternoon, for forty-five minutes, then a shorter solo turn at the evening ceilidh. He had a rough lineup of songs in mind, but you always had to take the crowd into account. Lots of women, the ballads went well; more men, more of the martial\u2014\u201cKilliecrankie\u201d and \u201cMontrose,\u201d \u201cGuns and Drums.\u201d The bawdy songs did best when the audience was well warmed up\u2014preferably after a bit of beer.</p><p>He turned the stocking tops down neatly, and slid the antler-handled sgian dhu inside, tight against his right calf. He laced the buskins quickly, hurrying a little. He wanted to find Brianna again, have a little time to walk round with her, get her something to eat, see she had a good seat for the performances.</p><p>He flung the plaid over one shoulder, fastened his brooch, belted on dirk and sporran, and was ready. Or not quite. He halted, halfway to the door.</p><p>The ancient olive-drab drawers were military issue, circa World War II\u2014one of Roger\u2019s few mementos of his father. He didn\u2019t bother with pants much in the normal course, but included these with his kilt sometimes as a defensive measure against the amazing boldness of some female spectators. He\u2019d been warned by other performers, but wouldn\u2019t have believed it, had he not experienced it firsthand. German ladies were the worst, but he\u2019d known a few American women run them a close second for taking liberties in close quarters.</p><p>He didn\u2019t think he\u2019d need such measures here; the crowd sounded civil, and he\u2019d seen that the stage was safely out of reach. Besides, offstage he\u2019d have Brianna with him, and if she should choose to take any liberties of her own...He dropped the pants back in his bag, on top of the brown envelope.</p><p>\u201cWish me luck, Dad,\u201d he whispered, and went to find her.</p><p>\u201cWow!\u201d She walked round him in a circle, goggling. \u201cRoger, you are gorgeous!\u201d She smiled, a trifle lopsided. \u201cMy mother always said men in kilts were irresistible. I guess she was right.\u201d</p><p>He saw her swallow hard, and wanted to hug her for her bravery, but she had already turned away, gesturing toward the main food area.</p><p>\u201cAre you hungry? I had a look while you were changing. We\u2019ve got our choice between octopus-on-a-stick, Baja fish tacos, Polish dogs\u2014\u201d</p><p>He took her arm and pulled her round to face him.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d he said softly. \u201cI\u2019m sorry; I wouldn\u2019t have brought you if I\u2019d known it would be a shock.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right.\u201d Her smile was better this time. \u201cIt\u2019s\u2014I\u2019m glad you brought me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTruly?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Really. It\u2019s\u2014\u201d She waved helplessly at the tartan swirl of noise and color all around them. \u201cIt\u2019s so\u2014Scottish.\u201d</p><p>He wanted to laugh at that; nothing could be less like Scotland than this mix of tourist claptrap and the bald-faced selling of half-faked traditions. At the same time, she was right, it was uniquely Scottish; an example of the Scots\u2019 age-old talent for survival\u2014the ability to adapt to anything, and make a profit from it.</p><p>He did hug her, then. Her hair smelled clean, like fresh grass, and he could feel her heart beating through the white T-shirt she wore.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re Scots, too, you know,\u201d he said in her ear, and let go. Her eyes were still bright, but with a different emotion now, he thought.</p><p>\u201cI guess you\u2019re right,\u201d she said, and smiled again, a good one. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean I have to eat haggis, does it? I saw some over there, and I think I\u2019d even rather try the octopus-on-a-stick.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He\u2019d thought she was joking, but she wasn\u2019t. The resort\u2019s sole business, it seemed, was \u201cethnic fairs,\u201d as one of the food vendors explained.</p><p>\u201cPolacks dancin\u2019 polkas, Swiss yodelers\u2014Jeez, they musta had ten million cuckoo clocks here! Spanish, Italian, Japanese cherry blossom festivals\u2014you wouldn\u2019t believe all the cameras them Japs have, you just wouldn\u2019t believe it.\u201d He shook his head in bemusement, sliding across two paper plates filled with hamburgers and french fries.</p><p>\u201cAnyways, it\u2019s something different, every two weeks. Never a dull moment. But us food vendors, we just stay in business, no matter what kinda food it is.\u201d The man eyed Roger\u2019s kilt with some interest.</p><p>\u201cSo, you Scotch, or you just like wearing a skirt?\u201d</p> <p>Having heard several dozen variations of that pleasantry, Roger gave the man a bland look.</p><p>\u201cWell, as my auld grand-da used to say,\u201d he said, thickening his accent atrociously, \u201cwhen ye put on yer kilt, laddie, ye ken for sure yer a man!\u201d</p><p>The man doubled up appreciatively, and Brianna rolled her eyes.</p><p>\u201cKilt jokes,\u201d she muttered. \u201cGod, if you start telling kilt jokes, I\u2019ll drive off and leave you, I swear I will.\u201d</p><p>Roger grinned at her.</p> <p>\u201cOch, now, ye wouldna do that, would ye, lass? Go off and leave a man, only because he\u2019ll tell ye what\u2019s worn under the kilt, if ye like?\u201d</p><p>Her eyes narrowed into blue triangles.</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019d bet nothing at all\u2019s worn under that kilt,\u201d she said, with a nod at Roger\u2019s sporran. \u201cWhy, I\u2019ll bet everything under there is in pairrrrrrfect operrrating condition, no?\u201d</p><p>Roger choked on a french fry.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re s\u2019posed to say \u2018Give us your hand, lassie, and I\u2019ll show you,\u2019 \u201d the food vendor prompted. \u201cBoy, if I\u2019ve heard that one once, I\u2019ve heard it a hunderd times this week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf he says it now,\u201d Brianna put in darkly, \u201cI\u2019ll drive off and leave him marooned on this mountain. He can stay here and eat octopus, for all I care.\u201d</p> <p>Roger took a gulp of Coca-Cola and wisely kept quiet.</p><p>There was time for a wander up and down the aisles of the vendors\u2019 stalls, selling everything from tartan ties to penny whistles, silver jewelry, clan maps of Scotland, butterscotch and shortbread, letter openers in the shape of claymores, lead Highlander figures, books, records, and every imaginable small item on which a clan badge or motto could be imprinted.</p><p>Roger attracted no more than a brief glance of curiosity; while of better quality than most, his costume was no oddity here. Still, most of the crowd were tourists, dressed in shorts and jeans, but breaking out here and there in bits of tartan, like a rash.</p><p>\u201cWhy MacKenzie?\u201d Brianna asked, pausing by one display of clan-marked keychains. She fingered one of the silver disks that read Luceo non uro, the Latin motto curved around a depiction of what looked like a volcano. \u201cDidn\u2019t Wakefield sound Scottish enough? Or did you think the people at Oxford wouldn\u2019t like you doing\u2014this?\u201d She waved at the venue around them.</p><p>Roger shrugged.</p><p>\u201cPartly that. But it\u2019s my family name, as well. Both my parents were killed during the war, and my great-uncle adopted me. He gave me his own name\u2014but I was christened Roger Jeremiah MacKenzie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJeremiah?\u201d She didn\u2019t laugh out loud, but the end of her nose pinkened as though she was trying not to. \u201cLike the Old Testament prophet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t laugh,\u201d he said, taking her arm. \u201cI was named for my father\u2014they called him Jerry. My Mum called me Jemmy when I was small. Old family name. It could have been worse, after all; I might have been christened Ambrose or Conan.\u201d</p> <p>The laughter fizzed out of her like Coke bubbles.</p><p>\u201cConan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerfectly good Celtic name, before the fantasists got hold of it. Anyway, Jeremiah seems to have been the pick of the lot for good cause.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>They turned and headed slowly back toward the stage, where a gang of solemnly starched little girls were doing the Highland fling in perfect unison, every pleat and bow in place.</p><p>\u201cOh, it\u2019s one of the stories Dad\u2014the Reverend, I always called him Dad\u2014used to tell me, going down my family tree and pointing out the folk on it.\u201d</p><p>Ambrose MacKenzie, that\u2019s your great-grandfather, Rog. He\u2019ll have been a boatwright in Dingwall. And there\u2019s Mary Oliphant\u2014I knew your great-grandma Oliphant, did I tell you? Lived to be ninety-seven, and sharp as a tack to her last breath; wonderful woman.</p><p>She was married six times\u2014all died of natural causes, too, she assured me\u2014but I\u2019ve only put Jeremiah MacKenzie here, since he was your ancestor. The only one she had children by, I did wonder about that.</p><p>I asked her, and she closed one eye and nodded at me, and said, \u201cIs fhearr an giomach na \u2019bhi gun fear tighe.\u201d It\u2019s an old Gaelic proverb\u2014\u201cBetter a lobster than no husband.\u201d She said some would do for marrying, but Jeremiah was the only lad bonny enough to take to her bed every night.</p><p>\u201cI wonder what she told the others,\u201d Brianna said, meditatively.</p><p>\u201cWell, she didn\u2019t say she didn\u2019t sleep with them now and then,\u201d Roger pointed out. \u201cJust not every night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnce is enough to get pregnant,\u201d Brianna said. \u201cOr so my mother assured my high school health class. She\u2019d draw pictures of sperm on the blackboard, all racing toward this huge egg with leers on their faces.\u201d She\u2019d gone pink again, but evidently from amusement rather than distressed memory.</p><p>Arm in arm, he could feel the heat of her through the thin T-shirt, and a stirring under his kilt that made him think leaving the pants off had been a mistake.</p><p>\u201cPutting aside the question of whether sperm have faces, what has that particular subject got to do with health?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHealth is an American euphemism for anything to do with sex,\u201d she explained. \u201cThey teach girls and boys separately; the girls\u2019 class is The Mysteries of Life, and Ten Ways to Say No to a Boy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the boys\u2019 class?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I don\u2019t know for sure, because I didn\u2019t have any brothers to tell me. Some of my friends had brothers, though\u2014one of them said they learned eighteen different synonyms for penile erection.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally useful, that,\u201d Roger said, wondering why anyone required more than one. Luckily, a sporran covered a multitude of sins.</p><p>\u201cI suppose it might keep the conversation going\u2014under certain circumstances.\u201d</p><p>Her cheeks were red. He could feel the heat creeping up his own throat, and imagined that they were beginning to attract curious glances from passersby. He hadn\u2019t let a girl embarrass him in public since he was seventeen, but she was doing nicely. She\u2019d started it, though\u2014let her finish it, then.</p><p>\u201cMmphm. I hadn\u2019t noticed much conversation, under those particular circumstances.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI imagine you\u2019d know.\u201d It wasn\u2019t quite a question. Rather late, he realized what she was up to. He tightened his arm, pulling her closer.</p><p>\u201cIf you mean have I, yes. If you mean am I, no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you, what?\u201d Her lips were quivering slightly, holding back the urge to laugh.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re asking if I\u2019ve got a girl in England, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAm I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t. Or rather I do, but nothing serious.\u201d They were outside the door to the dressing rooms; nearly time to fetch his instruments. He stopped and turned to look at her. \u201cHave you? Got a bloke, I mean.\u201d</p><p>She was tall enough to look him in the eye, and close enough that her br**sts grazed his forearm when she turned to face him.</p><p>\u201cWhat was it your great-grandmother said? \u2018Is fhearr an giomach....\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201c \u2018...na \u2019bhi gun fear tighe.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh. Well, better a lobster than no boyfriend.\u201d She lifted a hand and touched his brooch. \u201cSo yes, there are people I go out with. But I don\u2019t have a bonny lad\u2014yet.\u201d</p><p>He caught her fingers and brought them to his mouth.</p><p>\u201cGive it time, lass,\u201d he said, and kissed them.</p><p>The audience was amazingly quiet; not at all like a rock concert. Of course, they couldn\u2019t be noisy, she thought; there weren\u2019t any electric guitars or amplifiers, only a small microphone on a stand. But then, some things didn\u2019t need amplifying. Her heart, for one, hammering in her ears.</p><p>\u201cHere,\u201d he\u2019d said, appearing abruptly out of the dressing room with guitar and drum. He\u2019d handed her a small brown envelope. \u201cI found these, going through my dad\u2019s old bumf in Inverness. I thought you\u2019d maybe want them.\u201d</p><p>She could tell it was photographs, but she hadn\u2019t looked at them right away. She\u2019d sat with them burning a hole on her knee, listening to Roger\u2019s set.</p><p>He was good\u2014even distracted, she could tell he was good. He had a surprisingly rich deep baritone voice, and he knew what to do with it. Not just in terms of tone and melody; he had the true performer\u2019s ability to pull aside the curtain between singer and audience, to look out into the crowd, meet someone\u2019s eyes, and let them see what lay behind both words and music.</p><p>He\u2019d got them going with \u201cThe Road to the Isles,\u201d a quick and lively clap-along song with a rousing chorus, and when they\u2019d subsided from that, kept them going with \u201cThe Gallowa\u2019 Hills,\u201d and a sweet slide into \u201cThe Lewis Bridal Song,\u201d with a lovely, lilting chorus in Gaelic.</p><p>He let the last note die away on \u201cVhair Me Oh,\u201d and smiled, directly at her, she thought.</p><p>\u201cAnd here\u2019s one from the \u201945,\u201d he said. \u201cThis one is from the famous battle of Prestonpans, at which the Highland Army of Charles Stuart routed a much greater English force, under the command of General Jonathan Cope.\u201d</p><p>There was an appreciative murmur from the crowd, for many of whom the song was plainly an old favorite, quickly shushed as Roger\u2019s fingers plucked out the marching line.</p><p>\u201cCope sent a challenge from Dunbar</p><p>Sayin\u2019 \u2018Charlie, meet me, and ye daur</p><p>An\u2019 I\u2019ll learn ye the art o\u2019 war</p><p>If ye\u2019ll meet me in the mornin\u2019.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>He bent his head over the strings, nodding to the crowd to join in the jeering chorus.</p><p>\u201cHey, Johnnie Cope, are ye walkin\u2019 yet?</p><p>And are your drums a-beatin\u2019 yet?</p><p>If ye were walkin\u2019, I would wait</p><p>Tae gang tae the coals in the mornin\u2019!\u201d</p><p>Brianna felt a sudden prickle at the roots of her hair that had nothing to do with singer or crowd, but with the song itself.</p><p>\u201cWhen Charlie looked the letter upon,</p><p>He drew his sword the scabbard from,</p><p>Come, follow me, my merry men,</p><p>And we\u2019ll meet Johnnie Cope in the morning!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she whispered, her fingers cold on the smooth brown envelope. Come follow me, my merry men...They\u2019d been there\u2014both her parents. It was her father who had charged the field at Preston, his broadsword and his targe in his hands. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201c...For it will be a bluidie morning!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, Johnnie Cope, are ye walkin\u2019 yet?</p><p>And are your drums a-beatin\u2019 yet?...\u201d</p><p>The voices rose around her in a roar of approbation as they joined in the chorus. She had a moment of rising panic, when she would have fled away like Johnnie Cope, but it passed, leaving her buffeted by emotion as much as by the music.</p> <p>\u201cIn faith, quo Johnnie, I got sic flegs,</p><p>Wi\u2019 their claymores an\u2019 philabegs,</p><p>Gin I face them again, de\u2019il brak my legs,</p><p>So I wish you a\u2019 good morning!</p><p>Hey, Johnnie Cope, are ye walkin\u2019 yet?...\u201d</p> <p>Yes, he was. And he would be, as long as that song lasted. Some people tried to preserve the past; others, to escape it. And that was by far the greatest gulf between herself and Roger. Why hadn\u2019t she seen it before?</p><p>She didn\u2019t know whether Roger had seen her momentary distress, but he abandoned the dangerous territory of the Jacobites and went into \u201cMacPherson\u2019s Lament,\u201d sung with no more than an occasional touch of the strings. The woman next to Brianna let out a long sigh and looked doe-eyed at the stage.</p><p>\u201cSae rantingly, sae wantonly, sae dauntingly gaed he,</p><p>He played a tune and he danced it roond...alow the gallows tree!\u201d</p><p>She picked up the envelope, weighing it on her fingers. She ought to wait, maybe, until she got home. But curiosity was warring with reluctance. Roger hadn\u2019t been sure he should give it to her; she\u2019d seen that in his eyes.</p><p>\u201c...a bodhran,\u201d Roger was saying. The drum was no more than a wooden hoop, a few inches wide, with a skin head stretched over it, some eighteen inches across. He held the drum balanced on the fingers of one hand, a small double-headed stick in the other. \u201cOne of the oldest known instruments, this is the drum with which the Celtic tribes scared the bejesus out of Julius Caesar\u2019s troops in 52 BC.\u201d The audience tittered, and he touched the wide drumhead with the stick, back and forth in a soft, quick rhythm like a heartbeat.</p> <p>\u201cAnd here\u2019s \u2018The Sheriffmuir Fight,\u2019 from the first Jacobite Rising, in 1715.\u201d</p><p>The drumhead shifted and the beat dropped in pitch, became martial in tone, a thundering behind the words. The audience was still well-behaved, but now sat up and leaned forward, hanging on the chant that described the battle of Sheriffmuir, and all the clans who had fought in it.</p><p>\u201c...then on they rushed, and blood out-gushed, and many a puke did fall, man...</p><p>They hacked and hashed, while broadswords clashed...\u201d</p><p>As the song ended she put her fingers inside the envelope and pulled out a set of photographs. Old snapshots, black-and-white faded to tones of brown. Her parents. Frank and Claire Randall, both looking absurdly young\u2014and terribly happy.</p><p>They were in a garden somewhere; there were lawn chairs, and a table with drinks in a background dappled with the scattered light of tree leaves. The faces showed clearly, though\u2014laughing, faces alight with youth, eyes only for each other.</p><p>Posing formally, arm in arm, mocking their own formality. Laughing, Claire half bent over with hilarity at something Frank had said, holding down a wide skirt flying in the wind, her curly hair suffering no such restraint. Frank handing Claire a cup, she looking up into his face as she took it, with such a look of hope and trust that Brianna\u2019s heart squeezed tight to see it.</p><p>Then she looked at the last of the pictures, and realized what she was looking at. The two of them stood by the table, hands together on a knife, laughing as they cut into an obviously homemade cake. A wedding cake.</p> <p>\u201cAnd for the last, an old favorite that you\u2019ll know. This song is said to have been sent by a Jacobite prisoner, on his way to London to be hanged, to his wife in the Highlands...\u201d</p><p>She spread her hands out flat on top of the pictures, as though to keep anyone from seeing them. An icy shock went through her. Wedding pictures. Snapshots of their wedding day. Of course; they\u2019d been married in Scotland. The Reverend Wakefield wouldn\u2019t have done the ceremony, not being a Catholic priest, but he was one of her father\u2019s oldest friends; the reception must have been held at the manse.</p><p>Yes. Peeking through her fingers, she could make out familiar bits of the old house in the background. Then, reluctantly sliding her hand aside, she looked again at her mother\u2019s young face.</p><p>Eighteen. Claire had married Frank Randall at eighteen\u2014perhaps that explained it. How could anyone know their mind so young?</p><p>\u201cBy yon bonnie banks, and by yon bonnie braes,</p><p>Where the sun shines bright on Loch Lomond,</p><p>Where me and my true love were ever wont to gae...\u201d</p><p>But Claire had been sure\u2014or she\u2019d thought so. The broad clear brow and delicate mouth admitted of no doubt; the big, luminous eyes were fixed on her new husband with no sign of reservation or misgiving. And yet\u2014</p><p>\u201cBut me and my true love will never meet again</p><p>On the bonnie, bonnie banks of Loch Lomond.\u201d</p><p>Oblivious of the toes she stepped on, Brianna blundered out of the row and fled, before anyone should see the tears.</p><p>\u201cI can stay with you through part of the calling of the clans,\u201d Roger said, \u201cbut I\u2019ve a bit to do at the end of it, so I\u2019ll have to leave you. Will you be all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, of course,\u201d she said firmly. \u201cI\u2019m fine. Don\u2019t worry.\u201d</p><p>He looked at her a little anxiously, but let it pass. Neither of them had mentioned her precipitous departure earlier; by the time he had made his way through the congratulatory well-wishers and gone to find her, she had had time to find a Ladies\u2019 and get herself under control with cold water.</p><p>They had spent the rest of the afternoon strolling through the festival, shopping a bit, going outside to watch the pipe-bands\u2019 competition, coming in half deafened to see a young man dance between two swords crossed on the ground. The photographs stayed safely out of sight in her handbag.</p><p>It was nearly dark now; people were leaving the eating area and heading for the open stands outside, at the foot of the mountain.</p><p>She had thought the families with young children would leave, and some did, but there were small bodies and sleepy heads drooping among the older people in the stands. A tiny girl lay limp, sound asleep on her father\u2019s shoulder as they made their way into one of the upper rows of the stands. There was a clear, flat space in front of the bleachers, in which a huge heap of wood had been piled.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the calling of the clans?\u201d she heard a woman ask her companion in the row ahead. The companion shrugged, and Brianna looked at Roger for enlightenment, but he only smiled.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll see,\u201d he said.</p><p>It was full dark, and the moon not risen; the bulk of the mountainside rose up as a darker black against the star-flecked sky. There was an exclamation from somewhere in the crowd, a scattering of more, and then the notes of a single bagpipe came faintly through the air, silencing everything else.</p><p>A pinpoint of light appeared near the top of the mountain. As they watched, it moved down, and another sprang up behind it. The music grew stronger, and another light came over the top of the mountain. For nearly ten minutes, the anticipation grew, as the music grew louder, and the string of lights grew longer, a blazing chain down the mountainside.</p><p>Near the bottom of the slope, a trail came out from the trees above; she had seen it during her earlier exploration. Now a man stepped out of the trees into sight, holding a blazing torch above his head. Behind him was the piper, and the sound now was strong enough to drown even the oohs and ahhs of the crowd.</p><p>As the two moved down the trail and toward the cleared space in front of the bleachers, Brianna could see that there were more men behind them; a long line of men, each with a torch, all dressed in the finery of the Highland chieftains. They were barbarous and splendid, decked in grouse feathers, the silver of swords and dirks gleaming red by the torchlight, picked out amid the folds of tartan cloth.</p><p>The pipes stopped abruptly, and the first of the men strode into the clearing and stopped before the stands. He raised his torch above his head and shouted, \u201cThe Camerons are here!\u201d</p><p>Loud whoops of delight rang out from the stands, and he threw the torch into the kerosene-soaked wood, which went up with a roar, in a pillar of fire ten feet high.</p><p>Against the blinding sheet of flame, another man stepped out, and called, \u201cThe MacDonalds are here!\u201d</p><p>Screams and yelps from those in the crowd that claimed kinship with clan MacDonald, and then\u2014</p><p>\u201cThe MacLachlans are here!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe MacGillivrays are here!\u201d</p><p>She was so entranced by the spectacle that she was only dimly aware of Roger. Then another man stepped out and cried, \u201cThe MacKenzies are here!\u201d</p><p>\u201cTulach Ard!\u201d bellowed Roger, making her jump.</p><p>\u201cWhat was that?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cThat,\u201d he said, grinning, \u201cis the war cry of clan MacKenzie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounded like it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Campbells are here!\u201d There must have been a lot of Campbells; the response shook the bleachers. As though that was the signal he had been waiting for, Roger stood up and flung his plaid over his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll meet you afterward by the dressing rooms, all right?\u201d She nodded, and he bent suddenly and kissed her.</p><p>\u201cJust in case,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Frasers\u2019 cry is Caisteal Dhuni!\u201d</p><p>She watched him go, climbing down the bleachers like a mountain goat. The smell of woodsmoke filled the night air, mixing with the smaller fragrance of tobacco from cigarettes in the crowd.</p><p>\u201cThe MacKays are here!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe MacLeods are here!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Farquarsons are here!\u201d</p><p>Her chest felt tight, from the smoke and from emotion. The clans had died at Culloden\u2014or had they? Yes, they had; this was no more than memory, than the calling up of ghosts; none of the people shouting so enthusiastically owed kinship to each other, none of them lived any longer by the claims of laird and land, but...</p><p>\u201cThe Frasers are here!\u201d</p><p>Sheer panic gripped her, and her hand closed tight on the clasp of her bag.</p><p>No, she thought. Oh, no. I\u2019m not.</p><p>Then the moment passed, and she could breathe again, but jolts of adrenaline still thrilled through her blood.</p><p>\u201cThe Grahams are here!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Inneses are here!\u201d</p><p>The Ogilvys, the Lindsays, the Gordons...and then finally, the echoes of the last shout died. Brianna held the bag on her lap, gripped tight, as though to keep its contents from escaping like the jinn from a lamp.</p><p>How could she? she thought, and then, seeing Roger come into the light, fire on his head and his bodhran in his hand, thought again, How could she help it?</p><p>5</p><p>TWO HUNDRED YEARS FROM YESTERDAY</p><p>You didn\u2019t wear your kilt!\u201d Gayle\u2019s mouth turned down in disappointment.</p><p>\u201cWrong century,\u201d Roger said, smiling down at her. \u201cDrafty for a moonwalk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have to teach me to do that.\u201d She bounced on her toes, leaning toward him.</p><p>\u201cDo what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRoll your r\u2019s like that.\u201d She puckered her brows and made an earnest attempt, sounding like a motorboat in low gear. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cVerra nice,\u201d he said, trying not to laugh. \u201cKeep it up.

Do you know \u2018This Land Is Your Land,\u2019 Roger? Or are you more into protest songs? But I guess you wouldn\u2019t be, since you\u2019re English\u2014oops, I mean Scotch. You guys don\u2019t have anything to protest about, do you?\u201d</p> <p>Brianna gave her friend a look of mild exasperation. \u201cWhere\u2019s Uncle Joe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn the living room, kicking the TV,\u201d Gayle said. \u201cShall I entertain Roger while you find him?\u201d She linked one arm cosily through Roger\u2019s, batting her eyelashes.</p><p>\u201cWe got half the doggone MIT College of Engineering here, and nobody who can fix a doggone television?\u201d Dr. Joseph Abernathy glared accusingly at the clusters of young people scattered around his living room.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s electrical engineering, Pop,\u201d his son told him loftily. \u201cWe\u2019re all mechanical engineers. Ask a mechanical engineer to fix your color TV, that\u2019s like asking an Ob-Gyn to look at the sore on your di\u2014ow!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, sorry,\u201d said his father, peering blandly over gold-rimmed glasses. \u201cThat your foot, Lenny?\u201d</p> <p>Lenny hopped storklike around the room to general laughter, clutching one large sneaker-clad foot in exaggerated agony.</p><p>\u201cBree, honey!\u201d The doctor spotted her and abandoned the television, beaming. He hugged her enthusiastically, disregarding the fact that she topped him by four inches or so, then let go and looked at Roger, his features rearranged in a look of wary cordiality.</p><p>\u201cThis the boyfriend?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is Roger Wakefield,\u201d Brianna said, narrowing her eyes slightly at the doctor. \u201cRoger, Joe Abernathy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDr. Abernathy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCall me Joe.\u201d</p> <p>They shook hands in mutual assessment. The doctor looked him over with quick brown eyes, no less shrewd for their warmth.</p><p>\u201cBree, honey, you want to go lay hands on that piece of junk, see can you bring it back to life?\u201d He jerked a thumb at the twenty-four-inch RCA sitting in mute defiance on its wire stand. \u201cIt was working fine last night, then today...pffft!\u201d</p><p>Brianna looked dubiously at the big color TV, and groped in the pocket of her jeans, coming out with a Swiss Army knife.</p><p>\u201cWell, I can check the connections, I guess.\u201d She flicked out the screwdriver blade. \u201cHow much time do we have?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHalf hour, maybe,\u201d called a crew-cut student from the kitchen doorway. He glanced at the crowd clustered around the small black-and-white set on the table. \u201cWe\u2019re still with Mission Control in Houston\u2014ETA thirty-four minutes.\u201d The muted excitement of the TV commentator came in bursts through the more vivid excitement of the spectators.</p><p>\u201cGood, good,\u201d said Dr. Abernathy. He laid a hand on Roger\u2019s shoulder. \u201cPlenty of time for a drink, then. You a Scotch man, Mr. Wakefield?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCall me Roger.\u201d</p><p>Abernathy poured a generous measure of amber nectar and handed it over.</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t imagine you take water, do you, Roger?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d It was Lagavulin; astonishing to find it in Boston. He sipped appreciatively, and the doctor smiled.</p><p>\u201cClaire gave it to me\u2014Bree\u2019s mama. Now, there was a woman with a taste for fine whisky.\u201d He shook his head nostalgically, and raised his glass in tribute.</p><p>\u201cSl\u00e0inte,\u201d Roger said quietly, and tipped his own glass before drinking.</p><p>Abernathy closed his eyes in silent appreciation\u2014whether of the whisky or the woman, Roger couldn\u2019t tell.</p><p>\u201cWater of life, huh? I do believe that particular stuff could raise the dead.\u201d He set the bottle back in the liquor cabinet with reverent hands.</p><p>How much had Claire told Abernathy? Enough, Roger supposed. The doctor picked up his tumbler and gave him a long look of assessment.</p><p>\u201cSince Bree\u2019s daddy is dead, I guess I get to do the honors. Reckon we got time for the third degree before they land, or shall we keep it short?\u201d</p><p>Roger raised one eyebrow.</p><p>\u201cYour intentions,\u201d the doctor elaborated.</p><p>\u201cOh. Strictly honorable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah? I called Bree last night, to see if she was coming tonight. No answer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019d gone to a Celtic festival, up in the mountains.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh. I called again, eleven p.m. And midnight. No answer.\u201d The doctor\u2019s eyes were still shrewd, but a good deal less warm. He set his glass down with a small click.</p><p>\u201cBree\u2019s alone,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd she\u2019s lonely. And she\u2019s lovely. I wouldn\u2019t like to see anybody take advantage of that, Mr. Wakefield.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeither would I\u2014Dr. Abernathy.\u201d Roger drained his glass and set it down hard. Warmth burned in his cheeks, and it wasn\u2019t due to the Lagavulin. \u201cIf you think that I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cTHIS IS HOUSTON,\u201d boomed the television. \u201cTRANQUILITY BASE, WE HAVE TOUCH-DOWN IN TWENTY MINUTES.\u201d</p><p>The inhabitants of the kitchen came pouring out, waving Coke bottles and cheering. Brianna, flushed with her labors, was laughing and brushing off their congratulations as she put away her knife. Abernathy put a hand on Roger\u2019s arm, to keep him.</p><p>\u201cMind me, Mr. Wakefield,\u201d Abernathy said, his voice low enough not to be heard over the crowd. \u201cI don\u2019t want to hear that you\u2019ve made that girl unhappy. Ever.\u201d</p><p>Roger carefully released his arm from the other\u2019s grip.</p><p>\u201cD\u2019ye think she looks unhappy?\u201d he asked, as politely as he could.</p><p>\u201cNo-oo,\u201d said Abernathy, rocking back on his heels and squinting hard at him. \u201cOn the contrary. It\u2019s the way she looks tonight that makes me think I should maybe punch you in the nose, on her daddy\u2019s behalf.\u201d</p><p>Roger couldn\u2019t help turning to look at her himself; it was true. She had dark circles under her eyes, wisps of hair were coming down from her ponytail, and her skin was glowing like the wax of a lighted candle. She looked like a woman who\u2019d had a long night\u2014and enjoyed it.</p><p>As though by radar, her head turned and her eyes fixed on him, over Gayle\u2019s head. She went on talking to Gayle, but her eyes spoke straight to him.</p><p>The doctor cleared his throat loudly. Roger jerked his attention away from her, to find Abernathy looking up at him, his expression thoughtful.</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d the doctor said, in a changed tone. \u201cLike that, is it?\u201d</p><p>Roger\u2019s collar was unbuttoned, but he felt as though he were wearing a tie tied too tight. He met the doctor\u2019s eyes straight on.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he said. \u201cLike that.\u201d</p><p>Dr. Abernathy reached for the bottle of Lagavulin, and filled both glasses.</p><p>\u201cClaire did say she liked you,\u201d he said in resignation. He lifted one glass. \u201cOkay. Sl\u00e0inte.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTurn it the other way\u2014Walter Cronkite\u2019s orange!\u201d Lenny Abernathy obligingly twirled the knob, turning the commentator green. Unaffected by his sudden change of complexion, Cronkite went on talking.</p><p>\u201cIn approximately two minutes, Commander Neil Armstrong and the crew of the Apollo 11 will make history in the first manned landing on the moon...\u201d</p><p>The living room was darkened and packed with people, everyone\u2019s attention riveted on the big TV as the footage shifted to a replay of the Apollo\u2019s launch.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m impressed,\u201d Roger said in Brianna\u2019s ear. \u201cHow did you fix it?\u201d He leaned against the end of a bookshelf, and pulled her snug against him, his hands on the swell of her hips, his chin on her shoulder.</p><p>Her eyes were on the television, but he felt her cheek move against his own.</p><p>\u201cSomebody kicked the plug out of the wall,\u201d she said. \u201cI just plugged it back in.\u201d</p><p>He laughed and kissed the side of her neck. It was hot in the room, even with the air conditioner humming, and her skin tasted moist and salty.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got the roundest arse in the world,\u201d he whispered. She didn\u2019t answer, but deliberately nestled her bottom against him.</p><p>A buzz of voices from the screen and pictures of the flag the astronauts would plant on the moon.</p><p>He glanced across the room, but Joe Abernathy was as hypnotized as any of them, face rapt in the glow of the television screen. Safe in the darkness, he wrapped his arms around Brianna, and felt the soft weight of her br**sts on his forearm. She sighed deeply and relaxed against him, putting her hand over his and squeezing tight.</p><p>They would both be less bold if there were any danger to it. But he was leaving in two hours; there was no chance of it going further. The night before, they had known they were playing with dyn**ite, and been more cautious. He wondered if Abernathy would actually have punched him, had he admitted that Brianna had spent the night in his bed?</p><p>He had driven them down the mountain, torn between trying to stay on the right side of the road, and the excitement of Brianna\u2019s soft weight, pressed against him. They\u2019d stopped for coffee, talked long past midnight, touching constantly, hands, thighs, heads close together. Driven on to Boston in the wee hours, the conversation dying, Brianna\u2019s head heavy on his shoulder.</p><p>Unable to keep awake long enough to find his way through the maze of unfamiliar streets to her apartment, he had driven to his hotel, smuggled her upstairs, and laid her on his bed, where she had fallen asleep in seconds.</p><p>He had himself spent the rest of the night on the chaste hardness of the floor, Brianna\u2019s woolly cardigan across his shoulders for warmth. With the dawn, he\u2019d got up and sat in the chair, wrapped in her scent, silently watching the light spread across her sleeping face.</p><p>Yeah, it was like that.</p><p>\u201cTranquility Base...the Eagle has landed.\u201d The silence in the room was broken by a deep collective sigh, and Roger felt the hair rise on the back of his neck.</p><p>\u201cOne...small...step for man,\u201d said the tinny voice, \u201cone giant leap...for mankind.\u201d The picture was fuzzy, but not through any fault of the television. Heads strained forward, avid to see the bulky figure making its ginger way down the ladder, setting foot for the first time on the lunar soil. Tears gleamed on one girl\u2019s cheeks, silver in the glow.</p><p>Even Brianna had forgotten everything else; her hand had fallen from his arm and she was leaning forward, caught up in the moment.</p><p>It was a fine day to be an American.</p><p>He had a momentary qualm, seeing them all so fiercely intent, so fervently proud, and she so much a part of it. It was a different century, two hundred years from yesterday.</p><p>Might there be common ground for them, a historian and an engineer? He facing backward to the mysteries of the past, she to the future and its dazzling gleam?</p><p>Then the room relaxed in cheers and babbling, and she turned in his arms to kiss him hard and cling to him, and he thought perhaps it didn\u2019t matter that they faced in opposite directions\u2014so long as they faced each other. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>PART THREE</p><p>Pirates</p><p>6</p><p>I ENCOUNTER A HERNIA</p> <p>June 1767</p><p>I hate boats,\u201d Jamie said through clenched teeth. \u201cI loathe boats. I view boats with the most profound abhorrence.\u201d</p><p>Jamie\u2019s uncle, Hector Cameron, lived on a plantation called River Run, just above Cross Creek. Cross Creek in turn lay some way upriver from Wilmington; some two hundred miles, in fact. At this time of year, we were told, the trip might take four days to a week by boat, depending on wind. If we chose rather to travel overland, the journey could take two weeks or more, depending on such things as washed-out roads, mud, and broken axles.</p><p>\u201cRivers do not have waves,\u201d I said. \u201cAnd I view the notion of trudging on foot for two hundred miles through the mud with a lot more than abhorrrrence.\u201d Ian grinned broadly, but quickly exchanged the grin for an expression of bland detachment as Jamie\u2019s glare moved in his direction.</p><p>\u201cBesides,\u201d I said to Jamie, \u201cif you get seasick, I still have my needles.\u201d I patted the pocket where my tiny set of gold acupuncture needles rested in their ivory case.</p> <p>Jamie exhaled strongly through his nose, but said no more. That little matter settled, the major problem remaining was to manage the boat-fare.</p><p>We were not rich, but did have a little money, as the result of a spot of good fortune on the road. Gypsying our way north from Charleston, and camping well off the road at night, we had discovered an abandoned homestead in the wood, its clearing nearly obliterated by new growth.</p><p>Cottonwood saplings shot like spears through the beams of the fallen roof, and a hollybush sprouted through a large crack in the hearthstone. The walls were half collapsed, black with rot and furred with green moss and rusty fungus. There was no telling how long the place had been abandoned, but it was clear that both cabin and clearing would be swallowed by the wilderness within a few years, nothing left to mark its existence save a tumbled cairn of chimney stones.</p><p>However, flourishing incongruously among the invading trees were the remains of a small peach orchard, the fruit of it burstingly ripe and swarming with bees. We had eaten as much as we could, slept in the shelter of the ruins, then risen before dawn and loaded the wagon with heaping mounds of smooth gold fruit, all juice and velvet.</p><p>We had sold it as we went, and consequently had arrived in Wilmington with sticky hands, a bag of coins\u2014mostly pennies\u2014and a pervasive scent of fermentation that clung to hair, clothes, and skin, as though we had all been dipped in peach brandy.</p><p>\u201cYou take this,\u201d Jamie advised me, handing me the small leather sack containing our fortune. \u201cBuy what ye can for provisions\u2014dinna buy any peaches, aye?\u2014and perhaps a few bits and pieces so we dinna look quite such beggars when we come to my kinsman. A needle and thread, maybe?\u201d He raised a brow and nodded at the large rent in Fergus\u2019s coat, incurred while falling out of a peach tree.</p> <p>\u201cDuncan and I will go about and see can we sell the wagon and horses, and inquire for a boat. And if there\u2019s such a thing as a goldsmith here, I\u2019ll maybe see what he\u2019d offer for one of the stones.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe careful, Uncle,\u201d Ian advised, frowning at the motley crew of humanity coming and going from the harbor nearby. \u201cYe dinna want to be taken advantage of, nor yet be robbed in the street.\u201d</p><p>Jamie, gravely straight-faced, assured his nephew that he would take due precaution.</p><p>\u201cTake Rollo,\u201d Ian urged him. \u201cHe\u2019ll protect ye.\u201d</p><p>Jamie glanced down at Rollo, who was surveying the passing crowds with a look of panting alertness that suggested not so much social interest as barely restrained appetite.</p><p>\u201cOh, aye,\u201d he said. \u201cCome along then, wee dog.\u201d He glanced at me as he turned to go. \u201cPerhaps ye\u2019d best buy a few dried fish, as well.\u201d</p><p>Wilmington was a small town, but because of its fortuitous situation as a seaport at the mouth of a navigable river, it boasted not only a farmer\u2019s market and a shipping dock, but several shops that stocked imported luxuries from Europe, as well as the homegrown necessities of daily life.</p><p>\u201cBeans, all right,\u201d Fergus said. \u201cI like beans, even in large quantities.\u201d He shifted the burlap sack on his shoulder, balancing its unwieldy weight. \u201cAnd bread, of course we must have bread\u2014and flour and salt and lard. Salt beef, dried cherries, fresh apples, all well and good. Fish, to be sure. Needles and thread I see also are certainly necessary. Even the hairbrush,\u201d he added, with a sidelong glance at my hair, which, inspired by the humidity, was making mad efforts to escape the confinement of my broad-brimmed hat. \u201cAnd the medicines from the apothecary, naturally. But lace?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLace,\u201d I said firmly. I tucked the small paper packet containing three yards of Brussels lace into the large basket he was carrying. \u201cLikewise ribbons. One yard each of wide silk ribbon,\u201d I told the perspiring young girl behind the counter. \u201cRed\u2014that\u2019s yours, Fergus, so don\u2019t complain\u2014green for Ian, yellow for Duncan, and the very dark blue for Jamie. And no, it isn\u2019t an extravagance; Jamie doesn\u2019t want us to look like ragamuffins when we meet his uncle and aunt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about you, Auntie?\u201d Ian said, grinning. \u201cSurely ye willna let us men be dandies, and you go plain as a sparrow?\u201d</p><p>Fergus blew air between his lips, in mingled exasperation and amusement.</p><p>\u201cThat one,\u201d he said, pointing to a wide roll of dark pink.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a color for a young girl,\u201d I protested.</p><p>\u201cWomen are never too old to wear pink,\u201d Fergus replied firmly. \u201cI have heard les mesdames say so, many times.\u201d I had heard les mesdames\u2019 opinions before; Fergus\u2019s early life had been spent in a brothel, and judging from his reminiscences, not a little of his later life, too. I rather hoped that he could overcome the habit now that he was married to Jamie\u2019s stepdaughter, but with Marsali still in Jamaica awaiting the birth of their first child, I had my doubts. Fergus was a Frenchman born, after all.</p><p>\u201cI suppose the Madams would know,\u201d I said. \u201cAll right, the pink, too.\u201d</p><p>Burdened with baskets and bags of provisions, we made our way out into the street. It was hot and thickly humid, but there was a breeze from the river, and after the stifling confines of the shop, the air seemed sweet and refreshing. I glanced toward the harbor, where the masts of several small ships poked up, swaying gently to the rocking of the current, and saw Jamie\u2019s tall figure stride out between two buildings, Rollo pacing close behind.</p><p>Ian hallooed and waved, and Rollo came bounding down the street, tail wagging madly at sight of his master. There were few people out at this time of day; those with business in the narrow street prudently flattened themselves against the nearest wall to avoid the rapturous reunion.</p><p>\u201cMy Gawd,\u201d said a drawling voice somewhere above me. \u201cThat\u2019ll be the biggest dawg I believe I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d I turned to see a gentleman detach himself from the front of a tavern, and lift his hat politely to me. \u201cYour servant, ma\u2019am. He ain\u2019t partial to human flesh, I do sincerely hope?\u201d</p><p>I looked up at the man addressing me\u2014and up. I refrained from expressing the opinion that he, of all people, could scarcely find Rollo a threat.</p><p>My interlocutor was one of the tallest men I\u2019d ever seen; taller by several inches even than Jamie. Lanky and rawboned with it, his huge hands dangled at the level of my elbows, and the ornately beaded leather belt about his midriff came to my chest. I could have pressed my nose into his navel, had the urge struck me, which fortunately it didn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cNo, he eats fish,\u201d I assured my new acquaintance. Seeing me craning my neck, he courteously dropped to his haunches, his knee joints popping like rifle shots as he did so. His face thus coming into view, I found his features still obscured by a bushy black beard. An incongruous snub nose poked out of the undergrowth, surmounted by a pair of wide and gentle hazel eyes.</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m surely obliged to hear that. Wouldn\u2019t care to have a chunk taken out my leg, so early in the day.\u201d He removed a disreputable slouch hat with a ragged turkey feather thrust through the brim, and bowed to me, loose snaky black locks falling forward on his shoulders. \u201cJohn Quincy Myers, your servant, ma\u2019am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cClaire Fraser,\u201d I said, offering him a hand in fascination. He squinted at it a moment, brought my fingers to his nose and sniffed them, then looked up and broke into a broad smile, nonetheless charming for missing half its teeth.</p><p>\u201cWhy, you\u2019ll maybe be a yarb-woman, won\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will?\u201d</p><p>He turned my hand gently over, tracing the chlorophyll stains around my cuticles.</p><p>\u201cA green-fingered lady might just be tendin\u2019 her roses, but a lady whose hands smell of sassafras root and Jesuit bark is like to know more than how to make flowers bloom. Don\u2019t you reckon that\u2019s so?\u201d he asked, turning a friendly gaze on Ian, who was viewing Mr. Myers with unconcealed interest.</p><p>\u201cOh, aye,\u201d Ian assured him. \u201cAuntie Claire\u2019s a famous healer. A wise-woman!\u201d He glanced proudly at me.</p><p>\u201cThat so, boy? Well, now.\u201d Mr. Myers\u2019s eyes went round with interest, and swiveled back to focus on me. \u201cSmite me if this ain\u2019t Lucifer\u2019s own luck! And me thinkin\u2019 I\u2019d have to wait till I come to the mountains and find me a shaman to take care of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you ill, Mr. Myers?\u201d I asked. He didn\u2019t look it, but it was hard to tell, what with the beard, the hair, and a thin layer of greasy brown dirt that seemed to cover everything not concealed by his ragged buckskins. The sole exception was his forehead; normally protected from the sun by the black felt hat, it was now exposed to view, a wide flat slab of purest white.</p><p>\u201cNot to say ill, I don\u2019t reckon,\u201d he replied. He suddenly stood up, and began to fumble up the tail of his buckskin shirt. \u201cIt ain\u2019t the clap or the French pox, anyhow, \u2019cause I seen those before.\u201d What I had thought were trousers were in fact long buckskin leggings, surmounted by a breechclout. Still talking, Mr. Myers had hold of the leather thong holding up this latter garment, and was fumbling with the knot.</p><p>\u201cDamnedest thing, though; all of a sudden this great big swelling come up just along behind of my balls. Purely inconvenient, as you may imagine, though it don\u2019t hurt me none to speak of, save on horseback. Might be you could take a peep and tell me what I best do for it, hm?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh....\u201d I said, with a frantic glance at Fergus, who merely shifted his sack of beans and looked amused, blast him.</p><p>\u201cWould I have the pleasure to make the acquaintance of Mr. John Myers?\u201d said a polite Scottish voice over my shoulder.</p><p>Mr. Myers ceased fumbling with his breechclout and glanced up inquiringly.</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t say whether it\u2019s a pleasure to you or not, sir,\u201d he replied courteously. \u201cBut be you lookin\u2019 for Myers, you\u2019ve found him.\u201d</p><p>Jamie stepped up beside me, tactfully inserting his body between me and Mr. Myers\u2019s breechclout. He bowed formally, hat under his arm.</p><p>\u201cJames Fraser, your servant, sir. I was told to offer the name of Mr. Hector Cameron by way of introduction.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Mr. Myers looked at Jamie\u2019s red hair with interest.</p><p>\u201cScotch, are you? Be you one of them Highlander fellows?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am a Scotsman, aye, and a Highlander.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe you kin to Old Hector Cameron?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe is my uncle by marriage, sir, though I have not met him myself. I was told that he was well known to you, and that you might consent to guide my party to his plantation.\u201d</p><p>The two men were frankly sizing each other up, eyes flicking head to toe as they talked, appraising bearing, dress, and armament. Jamie\u2019s eyes rested approvingly on the long sheath-knife at the woodsman\u2019s belt, while Mr. Myers\u2019s nostrils flared wide with interest.</p><p>\u201cComme deux chiens,\u201d Fergus remarked softly behind me. Like two dogs. \u201c...aux culs.\u201d Next thing you know, they will be smelling each other\u2019s backside.</p><p>Mr. Myers darted a glance at Fergus, and I saw a quick flash of amusement in the hazel depths before he returned to his assessment of Jamie. Uncultured the woodsman might be, but he plainly had some working knowledge of French.</p><p>Given Mr. Myers\u2019s olfactory inclinations and lack of self-consciousness, I might not have been surprised to see him drop to all fours and perform in the manner Fergus had suggested. As it was, he contented himself with a careful inspection that took in not only Jamie but Ian, Fergus, myself, and Rollo.</p> <p>\u201cNice dawg,\u201d he said casually, holding out a set of massive knuckles to the latter. Rollo, thus invited, instituted his own inspection, sniffing industriously from moccasins to breechclout as the conversation went on.</p><p>\u201cYour uncle, eh? Does he know you\u2019re coming?\u201d</p><p>Jamie shook his head.</p><p>\u201cI canna say. I sent a letter from Georgia, a month ago, but I\u2019ve no way to tell whether he\u2019s had it yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI shouldn\u2019t think so,\u201d Myers said thoughtfully. His eyes lingered on Jamie\u2019s face, then passed swiftly over the rest of us.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve met your wife. This\u2019ll be your son?\u201d He nodded at Ian.</p> <p>\u201cMy nephew, Ian. My foster son, Fergus.\u201d Jamie made the introductions with a wave of his hand. \u201cAnd a friend, Duncan Innes, who\u2019ll be along presently.\u201d</p><p>Myers grunted, nodding, and made up his mind.</p><p>\u201cWell, I should reckon I can get you to Cameron\u2019s all right. Wanted to be sure you was kin, but you got the look of the widder Cameron, in the face. The boy some, too.\u201d</p><p>Jamie\u2019s head jerked up sharply.</p><p>\u201cThe widow Cameron?\u201d</p><p>A sly smile flitted through the thicket of beard.</p><p>\u201cOld Hector caught the morbid sore throat, up and died late last winter. Don\u2019t figure they get much mail, wherever he is now.\u201d</p><p>Abandoning the Camerons for matters of more immediate personal interest, Myers resumed his interrupted excavations.</p> <p>\u201cBig purple thing,\u201d he explained to me, fumbling his loosened thong. \u201cAlmost as big as one o\u2019 my balls. You don\u2019t think it might could be as I\u2019ve decided sudden-like to grow an extry, do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, no,\u201d I said, biting my lip. \u201cI really doubt it.\u201d He moved very slowly, but had almost got the knot in his thong undone; people in the street were beginning to pause, staring.</p><p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t trouble yourself,\u201d I said. \u201cI do believe I know what that is\u2014it\u2019s an inguinal hernia.\u201d</p><p>The wide hazel eyes got wider.</p><p>\u201cIt is?\u201d He seemed impressed, and not at all displeased by the news.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d have to look\u2014somewhere indoors, that is,\u201d I added hastily \u201c\u2014to be sure, but it sounds like it. It\u2019s quite easy to repair surgically, but...\u201d I hesitated, looking up at the Colossus. \u201cI really couldn\u2019t\u2014I mean, you\u2019d need to be asleep. Unconscious,\u201d I amplified. \u201cI\u2019d have to cut you, and sew you up again, you see. Perhaps a truss\u2014a brace\u2014might be better, though.\u201d</p><p>Myers scratched slowly at his jaw, meditating.</p><p>\u201cNo, I done tried that, \u2019twon\u2019t do. Cuttin\u2019, though...You folks be staying here in the town for a spell before you head up to Cameron\u2019s?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot long,\u201d Jamie interrupted firmly. \u201cWe shall be sailing upriver to my aunt\u2019s estate, as soon as passage can be arranged.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d The giant pondered this for a moment, then nodded, beaming.</p><p>\u201cI know the very man for you, sir. I\u2019ll go this minute and fetch Josh Freeman out the Sailor\u2019s Rest. Sun\u2019s still high, he\u2019ll be not too drunk to do business yet.\u201d He swept me a bow, battered hat to his middle. \u201cAnd then could be your wife might have the kindness to meet me in yonder tavern\u2014it\u2019s a mite more genteel than the Sailor\u2019s\u2014and have a look at this...this...\u201d I saw his lips try to form themselves around \u201cinguinal hernia,\u201d then give up the effort and relax. \u201cThis yere obstruction.\u201d</p><p>He clapped the hat back on his head, and with a nod to Jamie, was off.</p><p>Jamie watched the mountain man\u2019s stiff-legged retreat down the street, slowed by cordial greetings to all he passed.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it about ye, Sassenach, I wonder?\u201d he said conversationally, eyes still fixed on Myers.</p><p>\u201cWhat is what about me?\u201d</p><p>He turned then, and gave me a narrow eye.</p><p>\u201cWhat it is that makes every man ye meet want to take off his breeks within five minutes of meetin\u2019 ye.\u201d</p><p>Fergus choked slightly, and Ian went pink. I looked as demure as possible.</p><p>\u201cWell, if you don\u2019t know, my dear,\u201d I said, \u201cno one does. I seem to have found us a boat. And what have you been up to this morning?\u201d</p><p>Industrious as always, Jamie had found us a potential gem-buyer. And not only a buyer, but an invitation to dinner with the Governor.</p><p>\u201cGovernor Tryon\u2019s in the town just now,\u201d he explained. \u201cStaying at the house of a Mr. Lillington. I talked this morning wi\u2019 a merchant named Mac-Eachern, who put me on to a man named MacLeod, who\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho introduced you to MacNeil, who took you to drink with MacGregor, who told you all about his nephew Bethune, who\u2019s the second cousin half removed of the boy who cleans the Governor\u2019s boots,\u201d I suggested, familiar by this time with the Byzantine pathways of Scottish business dealings.</p><p>Put two Highland Scots in a room together, and within ten minutes they would know each other\u2019s family histories for the last two hundred years, and have discovered a helpful number of mutual relatives and acquaintances.</p><p>Jamie grinned.</p><p>\u201cIt was the Governor\u2019s wife\u2019s secretary,\u201d he corrected, \u201cand his name\u2019s Murray. That\u2019ll be your Da\u2019s cousin Maggie\u2019s eldest boy from Loch Linnhe,\u201d he added, to Ian. \u201cHis father emigrated after the Rising.\u201d Ian nodded casually, doubtless docketing the information in his own version of the genetic encyclopedia, stored against the day it would prove useful.</p><p>Edwin Murray, the Governor\u2019s wife\u2019s secretary, had welcomed Jamie warmly as a kinsman\u2014if only by marriage\u2014and had obtained an invitation for us to dine at Lillington\u2019s that night, there ostensibly to acquaint the Governor with matters of trade in the Indies. In reality, we were intending to acquaint ourselves with Baron Penzler\u2014a well-to-do German nobleman who would be dining there as well. The Baron was a man not only of wealth but of taste, with a reputation as a collector of fine objects.</p><p>\u201cWell, it sounds a good idea,\u201d I said dubiously. \u201cBut I think you\u2019d better go alone. I can\u2019t be dining with governors looking like this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, ye look f\u2014\u201d His voice faded as he actually looked at me. His eye roamed slowly over me, taking in my grimy, bedraggled gown, wild hair and ragged bonnet.</p><p>He frowned at me. \u201cNo, I want ye there, Sassenach; I may need a distraction.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpeaking of distraction, how many pints did it take you to wangle an invitation to dinner?\u201d I asked, mindful of our dwindling finances. Jamie didn\u2019t blink, but took my arm, turning me toward the row of shops.</p><p>\u201cSix, but he paid half. Come along, Sassenach; dinner\u2019s at seven, and we must find ye something decent to wear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut we can\u2019t afford\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s an investment,\u201d he said firmly. \u201cAnd besides, Cousin Edwin has advanced me a bit against the sale of a stone.\u201d</p><p>The gown was two years out of fashion by the cosmopolitan standards of Jamaica but it was clean, which was the main thing so far as I was concerned.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re dripping, madame.\u201d The sempstress\u2019s voice was cold. A small, spare woman of middle age, she was the preeminent dressmaker in Wilmington and\u2014I gathered\u2014accustomed to having her fashion dictates obeyed without question. My rejection of a frilled cap in favor of freshly washed hair had been received with bad grace and predictions of pleurisy, and the pins she held in her mouth bristled like porcupine quills at my insistence on replacing the normal heavy corsetry with light boning, scalloped at the top to lift the br**sts without pinching them.</p><p>\u201cSorry.\u201d I tucked up the offending wet lock inside the linen towel that wrapped my head.</p><p>The guest quarters of Mr. Lillington\u2019s great house being fully occupied by the Governor\u2019s party, I had been relegated to Cousin Edwin\u2019s tiny attic over the stable block, and the fitting of my gown was being accomplished to the accompaniment of muffled stampings and chewings from below, punctuated by the monotonous strains of the groom\u2019s whistling as he mucked out the stalls.</p><p>Still, I was not inclined to complain; Mr. Lillington\u2019s stables were a deal cleaner than the inn where Jamie and I had left our companions, and Mrs. Lillington had very graciously seen me provided with a large basin of hot water and a ball of lavender-scented soap\u2014a consideration more important even than the fresh dress. I hoped never to see another peach.</p><p>I rose slightly on my toes, trying to see out of the window in case Jamie should be coming, but desisted at a grunt of protest from the sempstress, who was trying to adjust the hem of my skirt.</p><p>The gown itself was not at all bad; it was of cream silk, half-sleeved and very simple, but with panniers of wine-striped silk over the hips, and a ruching of claret-colored silk piping that ran in two rows from waist to bosom. With the Brussels lace I had purchased sewn around the sleeves, I thought it would do, even if the cloth was not quite of the first quality.</p><p>I had at first been surprised at the price, which was remarkably low, but now observed that the fabric of the dress was coarser than usual, with occasional slubs of thickened thread that caught the light in shimmers. Curious, I rubbed it between my fingers. I was no great judge of silk, but a Chinese acquaintance had spent most of one idle afternoon on board a ship explaining to me the lore of silkworms, and the subtle variation of their output.</p><p>\u201cWhere does this silk come from?\u201d I asked. \u201cIt isn\u2019t China silk; is it French?\u201d</p><p>The sempstress looked up, her crossness temporarily relieved by interest.</p><p>\u201cNo, indeed it\u2019s not. That\u2019s made in South Carolina, that is. There\u2019s a lady, Mrs. Pinckney by name, has gone and put half her land to mulberry trees, and went to raising silkworms on \u2019em. The cloth\u2019s maybe not quite so fine as the China,\u201d she acknowledged reluctantly, \u201cbut \u2019tisn\u2019t but half the cost, either.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She squinted up at me, nodding slowly.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll do for fit, and the bit o\u2019 piping\u2019s good; brings out the color in your cheeks. But begging your pardon, madame, you do need something above the neck, not to look too bare. If you won\u2019t have a cap nor a wig, might be you\u2019d have a ribbon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, ribbon!\u201d I said, remembering. \u201cYes, what a good idea. Do look in my basket over there, and you\u2019ll find a length that might just do.\u201d</p><p>Between us we managed to get my hair piled up, loosely bound with the length of dark pink ribbon, damp curly tendrils coming down\u2014I couldn\u2019t stop them\u2014around my ears and brow.</p> <p>\u201cNot too much mutton dressed as lamb, is it?\u201d I asked, suddenly worried. I smoothed a hand down the front of the bodice, but it fit snugly\u2014and trimly\u2014around my waist.</p><p>\u201cOh, no, madame,\u201d the sempstress assured me. \u201cQuite appropriate, and I say it myself.\u201d She frowned at me, calculating. \u201cOnly it is a bit bare over the bosom, still. You haven\u2019t any jewelry, at all?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust this.\u201d We turned in surprise as Jamie ducked his head to come in the door; neither of us had heard him coming.</p><p>He had somewhere managed to have a bath and procure a clean shirt and neckcloth; beyond that, someone had combed and plaited his hair into a smooth queue, bound with the new blue silk ribbon. His serviceable coat had not only been brushed, but improved by the application of a set of silver-gilt buttons, each delicately engraved with a small flower in the center.</p><p>\u201cVery nice,\u201d I said, touching one.</p> <p>\u201cRented from the goldsmith,\u201d he said. \u201cBut they\u2019ll do. So will this, I think.\u201d He drew out a filthy handkerchief from his pocket, from the folds of which he produced a slender gold chain.</p><p>\u201cHe hadna time for any but the simplest mount,\u201d he said, frowning in concentration as he fastened the chain around my neck. \u201cBut I think that\u2019s best, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>The ruby hung glinting just above the hollow of my br**sts, casting a pale rosy glow against my white skin.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you picked that one,\u201d I said, touching the stone gently. It was warm from his body. \u201cGoes much better with the dress than the sapphire or the emerald would.\u201d The sempstress\u2019s jaw hung slightly open. She glanced from me to Jamie, her impression of our social position evidently going up by leaps and bounds.</p><p>Jamie had finally taken time to notice the rest of my costume. His eyes traveled slowly over me from head to hem, and a smile spread across his face.</p><p>\u201cYe make a verra ornamental jewel box, Sassenach,\u201d he said. \u201cA fine distraction, aye?\u201d</p> <p>He glanced out the window, where a pale peach color stained a hazy evening sky, then turned to me, bowed and made a leg. \u201cMight I claim the pleasure of your company for dinner, madame?\u201d</p><p>7</p><p>GREAT PROSPECTS FRAUGHT WITH PERIL</p><p>While I was familiar with the eighteenth-century willingness to eat anything that could be physically overpowered and dragged to the table, I did not subscribe to the mania for presenting wild dishes as though they had not in fact undergone the intermediary processes of being killed and cooked before making their appearance at dinner.</p><p>I thus viewed the large sturgeon with which I sat eyeball-to-eyeball with a marked lack of appetite. Complete not only with eyes but with scales, fins, and tail, the three-foot fish rode majestically on waves of roe in aspic, decorated with a vast quantity of tiny spiced crabs, which had been boiled whole and scattered artistically over the platter.</p><p>I took another large sip of wine and turned to my dinner companion, trying to keep my eyes off the bulging glare of the sturgeon by my elbow.</p><p>\u201c...the most impertinent fellow!\u201d Mr. Stanhope was saying, by way of describing a gentleman he had encountered in a post-house whilst on his way to Wilmington from his property near New Bern.</p><p>\u201cWhy, in the very midst of our refreshment, he began to speak of his piles, and what torment they caused him with the coach\u2019s continual bouncing. And then damme if the crude fellow did not pull his kerchief out of his pocket, all spotted with blood, to show the company by way of evidence! Quite destroyed my appetite, ma\u2019am, I assure you,\u201d he assured me, forking up a substantial mouthful of chicken fricassee. He chewed it slowly, regarding me with pale, bulging eyes that reminded me uncomfortably of the sturgeon\u2019s.</p> <p>Across the table, Phillip Wylie\u2019s long mouth twitched with amusement.</p><p>\u201cTake care your conversation doesn\u2019t incur a similar effect, Stanhope,\u201d he said, with a nod at my untouched plate. \u201cThough a certain crudeness of company is one of the perils of public transport, I do admit.\u201d</p><p>Stanhope sniffed, brushing crumbs from the folds of his neckcloth.</p><p>\u201cNeedn\u2019t put on airs, Wylie. It\u2019s not everyone can afford to keep a coachman, \u2019specially not with all these fresh taxes. New one stuck on every time one turns around, I do declare!\u201d He waved his fork indignantly. \u201cTobacco, wine, brandy, all very well, but a tax upon newspapers, have you heard the like? Why, my sister\u2019s oldest boy was awarded a degree from Yale University a year past\u201d\u2014he puffed his chest unconsciously, speaking just slightly louder than usual\u2014\u201cand damned if she was not required to pay half a shilling, merely to have his diploma officially stamped!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut that is no longer the case at present,\u201d Cousin Edwin said patiently. \u201cSince the repeal of the Stamp Act\u2014\u201d</p><p>Stanhope plucked one of the tiny crabs from the platter and brandished it at Edwin in accusation.</p><p>\u201cGet rid of one tax, and another pops up in its place directly. Just like mushrooms!\u201d He popped the crab into his mouth and was heard to mumble something indistinctly about taxing the air next, he shouldn\u2019t wonder.</p><p>\u201cYou are come but recently from the Indies, I understand, Madame Fraser?\u201d Baron Penzler, on my other side, seized the momentary opportunity to interrupt. \u201cI doubt you will be familiar with such provincial matters\u2014or interested in them,\u201d he added, with a nod of benevolent dismissal at Stanhope.</p><p>\u201cOh, surely everyone is interested in taxes,\u201d I said, turning slightly sideways so as to display my bosom to best effect. \u201cOr don\u2019t you believe that taxes are what we pay for a civilized society? Though having heard Mr. Stanhope\u2019s story\u201d\u2014I nodded to my other side\u2014\u201cperhaps he would agree that the level of civilization isn\u2019t quite equal to the level of taxation?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHa ha!\u201d Stanhope choked on his bread, spewing crumbs. \u201cOh, very good! Not equal to\u2014ha ha, no, certainly not!\u201d</p><p>Phillip Wylie gave me a look of sardonic acknowledgment.</p><p>\u201cYou must try not to be so amusing, Mrs. Fraser,\u201d he said. \u201cIt may be the death of poor Stanhope.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEr...what is the current rate of taxation, do you think?\u201d I asked, tactfully drawing attention away from Stanhope\u2019s spluttering.</p><p>Wylie pursed his lips, considering. A dandy, he wore the latest in modish wigs, and a small patch in the shape of a star beside his mouth. Under the powder, though, I thought I detected both a good-looking face and a very shrewd brain.</p><p>\u201cOh, considering all incidentals, I should say it can amount to as much as two per centum of all income, if one was to include the taxes on slaves. Add taxes on lands and crops, and it amounts to a bit more, perhaps.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwo percent!\u201d Stanhope choked, pounding himself on the chest. \u201cIniquitous! Simply iniquitous!\u201d</p><p>With vivid memories of the last IRS form I had signed, I agreed sympathetically that a two percent tax rate was a positive outrage, wondering to myself just what had become of the fiery spirit of American taxpayers over the intervening two hundred years.</p><p>\u201cBut perhaps we should change the subject,\u201d I said, seeing that heads were beginning to turn in our direction from the upper end of the table. \u201cAfter all, speaking of taxes at the Governor\u2019s table is rather like talking of rope in the house of the hanged, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>At this, Mr. Stanhope swallowed a crab whole, and choked in good earnest.</p><p>His partner on the other side pounded him helpfully on the back, and the small black boy who had been occupied in swatting flies near the open windows was sent hastily to fetch water. I marked out a sharp, slender knife by the fish platter, just in case, though I hoped I shouldn\u2019t be compelled to perform a tracheotomy on the spot; it wasn\u2019t the kind of attention I was hoping to attract.</p><p>Luckily such drastic measures weren\u2019t required; the crab was disgorged by a fortunate slap, leaving the victim empurpled and gasping, but otherwise unharmed.</p><p>\u201cSomeone had mentioned newspapers,\u201d I said, once Mr. Stanhope had been thus rescued from his excesses. \u201cWe\u2019ve been here so short a time that I haven\u2019t seen any; is there a regular paper printed in Wilmington?\u201d</p><p>I had ulterior motives for asking this, beyond a desire to allow Mr. Stanhope time to recover himself. Among the few worldly goods Jamie possessed was a printing press, presently in storage in Edinburgh.</p><p>Wilmington, it appeared, had two printers in residence, but only one of these gentlemen\u2014a Mr. Jonathan Gillette\u2014produced a regular newspaper.</p><p>\u201cAnd it may soon cease to be so regular,\u201d Stanhope said darkly. \u201cI hear that Mr. Gillette has received a warning from the Committee of Safety, that\u2014ah!\u201d He gave a brief exclamation, his plump face creased in pained surprise.</p><p>\u201cHave you a particular interest, Mrs. Fraser?\u201d Wylie inquired politely, darting a look under his brows at his friend. \u201cI had heard that your husband had some connection with the printing trade in Edinburgh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy, yes,\u201d I said, rather surprised that he should know so much about us. \u201cJamie owned a printing establishment there, though he didn\u2019t issue a newspaper\u2014books and pamphlets and plays and the like.\u201d</p><p>Wylie\u2019s finely arched brow twitched up.</p><p>\u201cNo political leanings, then, your husband? So often printers find their skills suborned by those whose passions seek outlet in print\u2014but then, such passions are not necessarily shared by the printer.\u201d</p><p>That rang numerous alarm bells; did Wylie actually know anything about Jamie\u2019s political connections in Edinburgh\u2014most of whom had been thoroughly seditious\u2014or was this only normal dinner table conversation? Judging from Stanhope\u2019s remarks, newspapers and politics were evidently connected in people\u2019s minds\u2014and little wonder, given the times.</p><p>Jamie, at the far end of the table, had caught his name and now turned his head slightly to smile at me, before returning to an earnest conversation with the Governor, at whose right hand he sat. I wasn\u2019t sure whether this placement was the work of Mr. Lillington, who sat on the Governor\u2019s left, following the conversation with the intelligent, slightly mournful expression of a basset hound, or of Cousin Edwin, consigned to the seat opposite me, between Phillip Wylie and Wylie\u2019s sister, Judith.</p><p>\u201cOh, a tradesman,\u201d this lady now remarked, in a meaningful tone of voice. She smiled at me, careful not to expose her teeth. Likely decayed, I thought. \u201cAnd is this\u201d\u2014she gave a vague wave at her head, comparing my ribbon to the towering confection of her wig\u2014\u201cthe style in Edinburgh, Mrs. Fraser? How...charming.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Her brother gave her a narrowed eye.</p><p>\u201cI believe I have also heard that Mr. Fraser is the nephew of Mrs. Cameron of River Run,\u201d he said pleasantly. \u201cHave I been correctly informed, Mrs. Fraser?\u201d</p><p>Cousin Edwin, who had undoubtedly been the source of this information, buttered his roll with sedulous concentration. Cousin Edwin looked very little like a secretary, being a tall and prepossessing young man with a pair of lively brown eyes\u2014one of which now gave me the merest suggestion of a wink.</p><p>The Baron, as bored with newspapers as with taxes, perked up a bit at hearing the name Cameron.</p> <p>\u201cRiver Run?\u201d he said. \u201cYou have relations with Mrs. Jocasta Cameron?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s my husband\u2019s aunt,\u201d I replied. \u201cDo you know her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, indeed! A charming woman, most charming!\u201d A broad smile lifted the Baron\u2019s pendulous cheeks. \u201cSince many years, I am the dear friend of Mrs. Cameron and her husband, unfortunately dead.\u201d</p><p>The Baron launched into an enthusiastic recounting of the delights of River Run, and I took advantage of the lull to accept a small wedge of fish pie, full not only of fish, but of oysters and shrimps in a creamy sauce. Mr. Lillington had certainly spared no effort to impress the Governor.</p><p>As I leaned back for the footman to ladle more sauce onto my plate, I caught Judith Wylie\u2019s eyes on me, narrowed in a look of dislike that she didn\u2019t trouble to disguise. I smiled pleasantly at her, displaying my own excellent teeth, and turned back to the Baron, newly confident.</p> <p>There had been no looking glass in Edwin\u2019s quarters, and while Jamie had assured me that I looked all right, his standards were rather different from those of fashion. I had received any number of admiring compliments from the gentlemen at table, true, but this might be no more than customary politeness; extravagant gallantry was common among upper-class men.</p><p>But Miss Wylie was twenty-five years my junior, fashionably gowned and jeweled, and if no great beauty, not plain, either. Her jealousy was a better reflection of my appearance, I thought, than any looking glass.</p><p>\u201cSuch a beautiful stone, Mrs. Fraser\u2014you will permit me to look more closely?\u201d The Baron bent toward me, pudgy fingers delicately poised above my cl**vage.</p><p>\u201cOh, certainly,\u201d I said with alacrity, and quickly unclasped the chain, dropping the ruby into his broad, moist palm. The Baron looked slightly disappointed not to have been allowed to examine the stone in situ, but lifted his hand, squinting at the glinting droplet with the air of a connoisseur\u2014which he evidently was, for he reached into his watch pocket and withdrew a small gadget that proved to be a combination of optical lenses, including both a magnifying glass and a jeweler\u2019s loupe.</p><p>I relaxed, seeing this, and accepted a helping of something hot and savory-smelling from a glass dish being passed by the butler. What possessed people to serve hot food when the temperature in the room must be at least in the nineties?</p><p>\u201cBeautiful,\u201d murmured the Baron, rolling the stone gently in his palm. \u201cSehr sch\u00f6n.\u201d</p> <p>There were not many things about which I would have trusted Geillis Duncan, but I was sure of her taste in jewels. \u201cIt must be a stone of the first class,\u201d she had said to me, explaining her theory of time travel via gems. \u201cLarge, and completely flawless.\u201d</p><p>The ruby was large, all right; nearly the size of the pickled quail\u2019s eggs surrounding the fully plumed pheasant on the sideboard. As to its flawlessness, I felt no doubt. Geilie had trusted this stone to carry her into the future; I thought it would probably get us as far as Cross Creek. I took a bite of the food on my plate; some sort of ragout, I thought, very tender and flavorful.</p><p>\u201cHow delicious this is,\u201d I said to Mr. Stanhope, lifting another forkful. \u201cWhat is this dish, do you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, it is one of my particular favorites, ma\u2019am,\u201d he said, inhaling beatifically over his own plate. \u201cSoused hog\u2019s face. Delectable, is it not?\u201d</p><p>I shut the door of Cousin Edwin\u2019s room behind me and leaned against it, letting my jaw hang open in sheer relief at no longer being required to smile. Now I could take off the clinging dress, undo the tight corset, slip off the sweaty shoes.</p><p>Peace, solitude, nak*dness, and silence. I couldn\u2019t think of anything else required to make my life complete for the moment, save a little fresh air. I stripped off, and attired in nothing but my shift, went to open the window.</p><p>The air outside was so thick, I thought I could have stepped out and floated down through it, like a pebble dropped in a jar of molasses. The bugs came at once to the flame of my candle, light-crazed and blood-hungry. I blew it out and sat on the window seat in the dark, letting the soft, warm air move over me.</p><p>The ruby still hung at my neck, black as a blood drop against my skin. I touched it, set it swinging gently between my br**sts; the stone was warm as my own blood, too.</p> <p>Outside, the guests were beginning to depart; a line of waiting carriages was drawn up on the drive. The sounds of goodbyes, conversations, and soft laughter drifted up to me in snatches.</p><p>\u201c...quite clever, I thought,\u201d came up in Phillip Wylie\u2019s cultured drawl.</p><p>\u201cOh, clever, certainly it was clever!\u201d His sister\u2019s higher-pitched tones made it quite clear what she thought of cleverness as a social attribute.</p><p>\u201cWell, cleverness in a woman can be tolerated, my dear, so long as she is also pleasant to look upon. By the same token, a woman who has beauty may perhaps dispense with wit, so long as she has sense enough to conceal the lack by keeping her mouth shut.\u201d</p><p>Miss Wylie might not be accused of cleverness, but had certainly adequate sensibility to perceive the barb in this. She gave a rather unladylike snort.</p><p>\u201cShe is a thousand years old, at least,\u201d she replied. \u201cPleasant to look at, indeed. Though I will say it was a handsome trinket about her neck,\u201d she added grudgingly.</p><p>\u201cOh, quite,\u201d said a deeper voice that I recognized as Lloyd Stanhope\u2019s. \u201cThough in my own opinion, it was the setting rather than the jewel that was striking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSetting?\u201d Miss Wylie sounded blank. \u201cThere was no setting; the jewel merely rested upon her bosom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Stanhope said blandly. \u201cI hadn\u2019t noticed.\u201d Wylie burst out laughing, breaking off abruptly as the door opened to release more guests.</p><p>\u201cWell, if you didn\u2019t, old man, there were others who did,\u201d he said with sly intonation. \u201cCome, here\u2019s the carriage.\u201d</p><p>I touched the ruby again, watching the Wylies\u2019 handsome grays drive off. Yes, others had noticed. I could still feel the Baron\u2019s eyes on my bosom, knowingly avaricious. I rather thought he was a connoisseur of more than gems.</p><p>The stone was warm in my hand; it felt warmer even than my skin, though that must be illusion. I did not normally wear jewelry beyond my wedding rings; had never cared much for it. It would be a relief to be rid of at least part of our dangerous treasure. And still I sat there holding the stone, cradling it in my hand, till I almost thought I could feel it beating like a small separate heart, in time with my blood.</p><p>There was only one carriage left, its driver standing by the horses\u2019 heads. Some twenty minutes later, the occupant came out, adding to his goodbyes a good-humored \u201cGute Nacht\u201d as he stepped into his coach. The Baron. He had waited till last, and was leaving in a good mood; that seemed a good sign.</p><p>One of the footmen, stripped of his livery coat, was extinguishing the torches at the foot of the drive. I could see the pale blur of his shirt as he walked back to the house through the dark, and the sudden flare of light onto the terrace as a door opened to admit him below. Then that too was gone, and a night silence settled on the grounds.</p><p>I had expected Jamie to come up at once, but the minutes dragged on with no sound of his step. I glanced at the bed, but felt no desire to lie down.</p><p>At last I stood up and slipped the dress back on, not bothering with shoes or stockings. I left the room, walking quietly down the hallway in my bare feet, down the stair, through the breezeway to the main house, and in through the side entrance from the garden. It was dark, save the pale squares of moonlight that came through the casements; most of the servants must have retired, along with household and guests. There was light glowing through the stairwell\u2019s banister, though; the sconces were still alight in the dining room beyond.</p><p>I could hear the murmur of masculine voices as I tiptoed past the polished stair, Jamie\u2019s deep soft Scots alternating with the Governor\u2019s English tones, in the intimate cadences of a t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eate.</p><p>The candles had burnt low in their sconces. The air was sweet with melted beeswax, and low clouds of fragrant cigar smoke hung heavy outside the dining room doors.</p><p>Moving quietly, I stopped just short of the door. From this vantage point I could see the Governor, back to me, neck stretched forward as he lit a fresh cigar from the candlestick on the table.</p><p>If Jamie saw me, he gave no hint of it. His face bore its usual expression of calm good humor, but the recent lines of strain around eyes and mouth had eased, and I could tell from the slope of his shoulders that he was relaxed and at peace. My heart lightened at once; he had been successful then.</p><p>\u201cA place called River Run,\u201d he was saying to the Governor. \u201cWell up in the hills past Cross Creek.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know the place,\u201d Governor Tryon remarked, a little surprised. \u201cMy wife and I passed several days in Cross Creek last year; we made a tour of the colony, upon the occasion of my taking office. River Run is well up in the foothills, though, not in the town\u2014why, it is halfway to the mountains, I believe.\u201d</p><p>Jamie smiled and sipped his brandy.</p><p>\u201cAye, well,\u201d he said, \u201cmy family are Highlanders, sir; the mountains will be home to us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIndeed.\u201d A small puff of smoke rose over the Governor\u2019s shoulder. Then he took the cigar from his mouth and leaned confidentially toward Jamie.</p><p>\u201cSince we are alone, Mr. Fraser, there is another matter I wished to put before you. A glass with you, sir?\u201d He picked up the decanter without waiting for an answer, and poured more brandy.</p><p>\u201cI thank ye, sir.\u201d</p><p>The Governor puffed fiercely for a moment, sending up blue clouds, then having got his weed well alight, sat back, cigar fuming negligently in one hand.</p><p>\u201cYou are very newly come to the Colonies, young Edwin tells me. Are you familiar with conditions here?\u201d</p><p>Jamie shrugged slightly.</p><p>\u201cI have made it my business to learn what I could, sir,\u201d he replied. \u201cTo which conditions might ye refer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNorth Carolina is a land of considerable richness,\u201d the Governor answered, \u201cand yet it has not reached the same level of prosperity as have its neighbors\u2014owing mostly to a lack of laborers to take advantage of its opportunities. We have no great harbor for a seaport, you see; thus slaves must be brought overland at great cost from South Carolina or Virginia\u2014and we cannot hope to compete with Boston and Philadelphia for indentured labor.</p><p>\u201cIt has long been the policy both of the Crown and of myself, Mr. Fraser, to encourage the settlement of land in the Colony of North Carolina by intelligent, industrious and godly families, to the furtherance of the prosperity and security of all.\u201d He lifted his cigar, took a deep lungful and exhaled slowly, pausing to cough. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cTo this end, sir, there is established a system of land grants whereby a large acreage may be given to a gentleman of means, who will undertake to persuade a number of emigrants to come and settle upon a part of it under his sponsorship. This policy has been blessed with success over the last thirty years; a good many Highlanders and families from the Isles of Scotland have been induced to come and take up residence here. Why, when I arrived, I was astonished to find the banks of the Cape Fear River quite thick with MacNeills, Buchanans, Grahams, and Campbells!\u201d</p><p>The Governor tasted his cigar again, but this time the barest nip; he was anxious to make his point.</p><p>\u201cYet there remains a great deal of desirable land to be settled, further inland toward the mountains. It is somewhat remote, and yet, as you say, for men accustomed to the far reaches of the Scottish Highlands\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did hear mention of such grants, sir,\u201d Jamie interrupted. \u201cYet is not the wording that persons holding such grants shall be white males, Protestant, and above thirty years of age? And this statement holds the force of law?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat is the official wording of the Act, yes.\u201d Mr. Tryon turned so that I saw him now in profile, tapping the ash from his cigar into a small porcelain bowl. The corner of his mouth was turned up in anticipation; the face of a fisherman who feels the first twitch on his line.</p><p>\u201cThe offer is one of considerable interest,\u201d Jamie said formally. \u201cI must point out, however, that I am not a Protestant, nor are most of my kinsmen.\u201d</p><p>The Governor pursed his lips in deprecation, lifting one brow.</p><p>\u201cYou are neither a Jew nor a Negro. I may speak as one gentleman to another, may I not? In all frankness, Mr. Fraser, there is the law, and then there is what is done.\u201d He raised his glass with a small smile, setting the hook. \u201cAnd I am convinced that you understand that as well as I do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPossibly better,\u201d Jamie murmured, with a polite smile.</p> <p>The Governor shot him a sharp look, but then uttered a quick bark of laughter. He raised his brandy glass in acknowledgment, and took a sip.</p><p>\u201cWe understand each other, Mr. Fraser,\u201d he said, nodding with satisfaction. Jamie inclined his head a fraction of an inch.</p><p>\u201cThere would be no difficulties raised, then, regarding the personal qualifications of those who might be persuaded to take up your offer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone at all,\u201d said the Governor, setting down his glass with a small thump. \u201cProvided only that they are able-bodied men, capable of working the land, I ask nothing more. And what is not asked need not be told, eh?\u201d One thin brow flicked up in query.</p><p>Jamie turned the glass in his hands, as though admiring the deep color of the liquid.</p><p>\u201cNot all who passed through the Stuart Rising were so fortunate as myself, Your Excellency,\u201d he said. \u201cMy foster son suffered the loss of his hand; another of my companions has but one arm. Yet they are men of good character and industry. I could not in conscience partake of a proposal which did not offer them some part.\u201d</p> <p>The Governor dismissed this with an expansive wave of the hand.</p><p>\u201cProvided that they are able to earn their bread and will not prove a burden upon the community, they are welcome.\u201d Then, as though fearing he had been incautious in his generosity, he sat up straight, leaving the cigar to burn, propped on the edge of the bowl.</p><p>\u201cSince you mention Jacobites\u2014these men will be required to swear an oath of loyalty to the Crown, if they have not already done so. If I might presume to ask, sir, as you imply you are Papist...you, yourself...\u201d</p><p>Jamie\u2019s eyes might have narrowed only against the sting of the smoke, but I didn\u2019t think so. Neither did Governor Tryon, who was only in his thirties but no mean judge of men. He swiveled to face the table again, so that I saw only his back, but I could tell that he was gazing intently at Jamie, eyes tracing the swift movements of the trout beneath the water.</p><p>\u201cI do not seek to remind you of past indignity,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cNor yet to offend present honor. Still, you will understand that it is my duty to ask.\u201d</p><p>Jamie smiled, quite without humor.</p><p>\u201cAnd mine to answer, I expect,\u201d he said. \u201cYes, I am a pardoned Jacobite. And aye, I have sworn the oath\u2014like the others who paid that price for their lives.\u201d</p><p>Quite abruptly, he set down his still-full glass and pushed back the heavy chair. He stood and bowed to the Governor.</p> <p>\u201cIt grows late, Your Excellency. I must beg to take my leave.\u201d</p><p>The Governor sat back in his chair, and lifted the cigar slowly to his lips. He drew heavily on it, making the tip glow bright, as he gazed up at Jamie. Then, he nodded, letting a thin plume of smoke drift from his pursed lips.</p><p>\u201cGood night, Mr. Fraser. Do consider my offer, will you not?\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t wait to hear the answer\u2014I didn\u2019t need to. I skimmed down the hall in a rustle of skirts, startling a footman dozing in a dark corner.</p><p>I made it back to our borrowed room in the stable block without meeting anyone else, and collapsed. My heart was pounding; not only from the dash up the stairs but from what I had heard.</p><p>Jamie would consider the Governor\u2019s offer, all right. And what an offer! To regain in one swoop all that he had lost in Scotland\u2014and more.</p><p>Jamie had not been born a laird, but the death of his elder brother had left him heir to Lallybroch, and from the age of eight he had been raised to take responsibility for an estate, to see to the welfare of land and tenants, to place that welfare above his own. Then had come Charles Stuart, and his mad march to glory; a fiery cross leading his followers to shambles and destruction.</p><p>Jamie had never spoken bitterly of the Stuarts; had never spoken of Charles Stuart at all. Nor had he often spoken of what that venture had cost him personally.</p><p>But now...to have that back. New lands, cultivable and rich with game, and settled by families under his sponsorship and protection. It was rather like the Book of Job, I thought\u2014all those sons and daughters and camels and houses, destroyed so casually, and then replaced with such extravagant lar-gesse.</p><p>I had always viewed that bit of the Bible with some doubt, myself. One camel was much like another, but children seemed a different proposition. And while Job might have regarded the replacement of his children as simple justice, I couldn\u2019t help thinking that the dead children\u2019s mother might possibly have been of another mind about it.</p><p>Unable to sit, I went again to the window, gazing out unseeingly at the dark garden.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t simply excitement that was making my heart beat fast and my hands perspire; it was fear. With matters as they were in Scotland\u2014as they had been since the Rising\u2014it would be no difficult matter to find willing emigrants.</p><p>I had seen ships come into port in the Indies and in Georgia, disgorging their cargos of emigrants, so emaciated and worn by their passage that they reminded me of nothing so much as concentration camp victims\u2014skeletal as living corpses, white as maggots from two months in the darkness below-decks.</p><p>Despite the expense and difficulty of the journey, despite the pain of parting from friends and family and homeland forever, the immigrants poured in, in hundreds and in thousands, carrying their children\u2014those who survived the voyage\u2014and their possessions in small, ragged bundles; fleeing poverty and hopelessness, seeking not fortune but only a small foothold on life. Only a chance.</p><p>I had spent only a short time at Lallybroch the winter before, but I knew there were tenants there who survived only by the goodwill of Ian and Young Jamie, their crofts not yielding enough to live on. While such goodwill was invariably given, it was not inexhaustible; I knew that the estate\u2019s slender resources were often stretched to the maximum.</p><p>Beyond Lallybroch, there were the smugglers Jamie had known in Edinburgh, and the illegal distillers of Highland whisky\u2014any number of men, in fact, who had been forced to turn to lawlessness to feed their families. No, finding willing emigrants would be no problem at all for Jamie.</p><p>The problem was that in order to recruit suitable men for the purpose, he would have to go to Scotland. And in my mind was the sight of a granite gravestone in a Scottish kirkyard, on a hill high above the moors and sea.</p><p>JAMES ALEXANDER MALCOLM MACKENZIE FRASER, it read, and below that, my own name was carved\u2014Beloved husband of Claire.</p><p>I would bury him in Scotland. But there had been no date on the stone when I saw it, two hundred years hence; no notion when the blow would fall.</p><p>\u201cNot yet,\u201d I whispered, clenching my fists in the silk of my petticoat. \u201cI\u2019ve only had him for a little while\u2014oh, God, please, not yet!\u201d</p><p>As though in answer, the door swung open, and James Alexander Malcolm MacKenzie Fraser came in, carrying a candle.</p><p>He smiled at me, loosening his stock.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re verra light on your feet, Sassenach. I see I must teach ye to hunt one day, and you such a fine stalker.\u201d</p><p>I made no apology for eavesdropping, but came to help him with his waistcoat buttons. In spite of the late hour and the brandy, he was clear-eyed and alert, his body tautly alive when I touched him.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d best put out the candle,\u201d I said. \u201cThe bugs will eat you alive.\u201d I pinched a mosquito off his neck by way of illustration, the fragile body crushed to a smear of blood between my fingers.</p><p>Among the scents of brandy and cigar smoke, I could smell the night on him, and the faint musky spice of nicotiana; he had been walking, then, amid the flowers in the garden. He did that when he was either distressed or excited\u2014and he didn\u2019t seem distressed.</p><p>He sighed and flexed his shoulders as I took his coat; his shirt was damp with sweat underneath, and he plucked it away from his skin with a mild grunt of distaste.</p><p>\u201cI canna tell how folk live in such heat, dressed like this. It makes the savages look quite sensible, to be goin\u2019 about in loincloths and aprons.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt would be a lot cheaper,\u201d I agreed, \u201cif less aesthetically appealing. Imagine Baron Penzler in a loincloth, I mean.\u201d The Baron weighed perhaps eighteen stone, with a pasty complexion.</p><p>He laughed, the sound muffled in his shirt as he pulled it over his head.</p><p>\u201cYou, on the other hand...\u201d I sat down on the window seat, admiring the view as he stripped off his breeches, standing on one leg to roll down his stocking.</p><p>With the candle extinguished, it was dark in the room, but with my eyes adapted, I could still make him out, long limbs pale against the velvet night.</p><p>\u201cAnd speaking of the Baron\u2014\u201d I prodded.</p><p>\u201cThree hundred pounds sterling,\u201d he replied, in tones of extreme satisfaction. He straightened up and tossed the rolled stockings onto a stool, then bent and kissed me. \u201cWhich is in large part due to you, Sassenach.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor my value as an ornamental setting, you mean?\u201d I asked dryly, recalling the Wylies\u2019 conversation.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said, rather shortly. \u201cFor keeping Wylie and his friends occupied at dinner, while I talked wi\u2019 the Governor. Ornamental setting...tcha! Stanhope nearly dropped his eyeballs into your bosom, the filthy lecher; I\u2019d a mind to call him out for it, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDiscretion is the better part of valor,\u201d I said, standing up and kissing him back. \u201cNot that I\u2019ve ever met a Scot who seemed to think so.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAye, well, there was my grandsire, Old Simon. I suppose ye could say it was discretion that did for him, in the end.\u201d I could hear both the smile and the edge in his voice. If he seldom spoke of the Jacobites and the events of the Rising, it didn\u2019t mean he had forgotten; his conversation with the Governor had obviously brought them close to the surface of his mind tonight.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d say that discretion and deceit are not necessarily the same things. And your grandfather had been asking for it for fifty years, at least,\u201d I replied tartly. Simon Fraser, Lord Lovat, had died by beheading on Tower Hill\u2014at the age of seventy-eight, after a lifetime of unparalleled chicanery, both personal and political. For all of that, I quite regretted the old rogue\u2019s passing.</p><p>\u201cMmphm.\u201d Jamie didn\u2019t argue with me, but moved to stand beside me at the window. He breathed in deeply, as though smelling the thick perfume of the night.</p><p>I could see his face quite clearly in the dim glow of starlight. It was calm and smooth, but with an inward look, as though his eyes didn\u2019t see what was before them, but something else entirely. The past? I wondered. Or the future?</p> <p>\u201cWhat did it say?\u201d I asked suddenly. \u201cThe oath you swore.\u201d</p><p>I felt rather than saw the movement of his shoulders, not quite a shrug.</p><p>\u201c \u2018I, James Alexander Malcolm MacKenzie Fraser, do swear, and as I shall answer to God at the great day of judgment, I have not, nor shall have, in my possession any gun, sword, pistol, or arm whatsoever, and never use tartan, plaid, or any part of the Highland garb; and if I do so, may I be cursed in my undertakings, family, and property.\u2019 \u201d He took a deep breath, and went on, speaking precisely.</p><p>\u201c \u2018May I never see my wife and children, father, mother or relations. May I be killed in battle as a coward, and lie without Christian burial, in a strange land, far from the graves of my forefathers and kindred; may all this come across me if I break my oath.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd did you mind a lot?\u201d I said, after a moment.</p> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said softly, still looking out at the night. \u201cNot then. There are things worth dying or starving for\u2014but not words.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe not those words.\u201d</p><p>He turned to look at me, features dim in starlight, but the hint of a smile visible on his mouth.</p><p>\u201cYe know of words that are?\u201d</p><p>The gravestone had his name, but no date. I could stop him going back to Scotland, I thought. If I would.</p><p>I turned to face him, leaning back against the window frame.</p> <p>\u201cWhat about\u2014\u2018I love you\u2019?\u201d</p><p>He reached out a hand and touched my face. A breath of air stirred past us, and I saw the small hairs rise along his arm.</p><p>\u201cAye,\u201d he whispered. \u201cThat\u2019ll do.\u201d</p><p>There was a bird calling somewhere close at hand. A few clear notes, succeeded by an answer; a brief twitter, and then silence. The sky outside was still thick black, but the stars were less brilliant than before.</p><p>I turned over restlessly; I was nak*d, covered only by a linen sheet, but even in the small hours of the night, the air was warm and smothering, and the small depression in which I lay was damp.</p><p>I had tried to sleep, and could not. Even lovemaking, which normally could relax me into a bonelessly contented stupor, had this time left me only restless and sticky. At once excited and worried by the possibilities of the future\u2014and unable to confide my disturbed feelings\u2014I had felt separate from Jamie; estranged and detached, despite the closeness of our bodies.</p><p>I turned again, this time toward Jamie. He lay in his usual position, on his back, the sheet crumpled about his hips, hands gently folded over a flat stomach. His head was turned slightly on the pillow, his face relaxed in sleep. With the wide mouth gentled by slumber and the dark lashes long on his cheeks, in this dim light he looked about fourteen.</p><p>I wanted to touch him, though I wasn\u2019t sure whether I meant to caress or to poke him. While he had given me physical release, he had taken my peace of mind, and I was irrationally envious of his effortless repose.</p> <p>I did neither, though, and merely turned onto my back, where I lay with my eyes shut, grimly counting sheep\u2014who disobliged me by being Scottish sheep, cantering merrily through a kirkyard, leaping the gravestones with g*y abandon.</p><p>\u201cIs something troubling ye, Sassenach?\u201d said a sleepy voice at my shoulder.</p><p>My eyes popped open.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I said, trying to sound equally drowsy. \u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>There was a faint snort and a rustling of the chaff-filled mattress as he turned over.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a terrible liar, Sassenach. Ye\u2019re thinking so loudly, I can hear ye from here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t hear people think!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, I can. You, at least.\u201d He chuckled and reached out a hand, which rested lazily on my thigh. \u201cWhat is it\u2014has the spiced crab given ye flatulence?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt has not!\u201d I tried to twitch my leg away, but his hand clung like a limpet.</p><p>\u201cOh, good. What is it, then\u2014ye\u2019ve finally thought of a witty riposte to Mr. Wylie\u2019s remarks about oysters?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I said irritably. \u201cIf you must know, I was thinking about the offer Governor Tryon made you. Will you let go of my leg?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh,\u201d he said, not letting go but sounding less sleepy. \u201cWell, come to that, I was thinking on the matter a bit myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think about it?\u201d I gave up trying to detach his hand and rolled onto my elbow, facing him. The window was still dark, but the stars had dimmed visibly, faded by the distant approach of day.</p><p>\u201cI wonder why he made it, for the one thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? But I thought he told you why.\u201d</p><p>He gave a brief grunt.</p><p>\u201cWell, he\u2019s no offering me land for the sake of my bonny blue eyes, I\u2019ll tell ye that.\u201d He opened the eyes in question and cocked one brow at me. \u201cBefore I make a bargain, Sassenach, I want to know what\u2019s on both sides of it, aye?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t think he\u2019s telling the truth? About Crown grants to help settle the land? But he said it\u2019s been going on for thirty years,\u201d I protested. \u201cHe couldn\u2019t lie about something like that, surely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, that\u2019s the truth,\u201d he agreed. \u201cSo far as it goes. But bees that hae honey in their mouths hae stings in their tails, aye?\u201d He scratched at his head and smoothed the loose hair out of his face, sighing.</p><p>\u201cAsk yourself this, Sassenach,\u201d he said. \u201cWhy me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell\u2014because he wants a gentleman of substance and authority,\u201d I said slowly. \u201cHe needs a good leader, which Cousin Edwin has obviously told him you are, and a fairly wealthy man\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich I am not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t know that, though,\u201d I protested.</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t he?\u201d he said cynically. \u201cCousin Edwin will ha\u2019 told him as much as he knows\u2014and the Governor kens well I was a Jacobite. True, there are a few who mended their fortunes in the Indies after the Rising, and I might be one o\u2019 those\u2014but he has nae reason to think so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe knows you have some money,\u201d I pointed out.</p><p>\u201cBecause of Penzler? Aye,\u201d he said thoughtfully. \u201cWhat else does he know about me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly what you told him at dinner, so far as I know. And he can\u2019t have heard much about you from anyone else; after all, you\u2019ve been in town less than a\u2014what, you mean that\u2019s it?\u201d My voice rose in incredulity, and he smiled, a little grimly. The light was still far off, but moving closer, and his features were clearcut in the dimness.</p><p>\u201cAye, that\u2019s it. I\u2019ve connections to the Camerons, who are not only wealthy but well respected in the colony. But at the same time, I\u2019m an incomer, wi\u2019 few ties and no known loyalties here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcept, perhaps, to the Governor who\u2019s offering you a large tract of land,\u201d I said slowly.</p><p>He didn\u2019t reply at once, but rolled onto his back, still keeping a grip on my leg. His eyes were fastened on the dim whiteness of the plaster ceiling above, with its clouded garlands and ghostly cupids.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve known a German or two in my time, Sassenach,\u201d he said, musing. His thumb began to move slowly, back and forth upon the tender flesh of my inner thigh. \u201cI havena found them careless wi\u2019 their money, be they Jew or Gentile. And while ye looked bonny as a white rose this evening, I canna think it was entirely your charms that made the gentleman offer me a hundred pounds more than the goldsmith did.\u201d</p><p>He glanced at me. \u201cTryon is a soldier. He\u2019ll ken me for one, too. And there was that wee bit of trouble with the Regulators two year past.\u201d</p><p>My mind was so diverted by the possibilities intrinsic in this speech, that I was nearly unconscious of the increasing familiarity of the hand between my thighs.</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I forgot; ye wouldna have heard that part of the conversation\u2014bein\u2019 otherwise occupied with your host of admirers.\u201d</p><p>I let that one pass in favor of finding out about the Regulators. These, it appeared, were a loose association of men, mostly from the rough backcountry of the colony, who had taken offense at what they perceived as capricious and inequitable\u2014and now and then downright illegal\u2014behavior on the part of the Crown\u2019s appointed officials, the sheriffs, justices, tax collectors, and so on.</p><p>Feeling that their complaints were not sufficiently addressed by the Governor and Assembly, they had taken matters into their own hands. Sheriff\u2019s deputies had been assaulted, justices of the peace marched from their houses by mobs and forced to resign.</p><p>A committee of Regulators had written to the Governor, imploring him to address the iniquities under which they suffered, and Tryon\u2014a man of action and diplomacy\u2014had replied soothingly, going so far as to replace one or two of the most corrupt sheriffs, and issue an official letter to the court officers, regarding seizure of effects.</p><p>\u201cStanhope said something about a Committee of Safety,\u201d I said, interested. \u201cBut it sounded quite recent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe trouble is damped down but not settled,\u201d Jamie said, shrugging. \u201cAnd damp powder may smolder for a long time, Sassenach, but once it catches, it goes off with an almighty bang.\u201d</p><p>Would Tryon think it worth the investment, to buy the loyalty and obligation of an experienced soldier, himself in turn commanding the loyalty and service of the men under his sponsorship, all settled in a remote and troublesome area of the colony?</p><p>I would myself have called the prospect cheap, at the cost of a hundred pounds and a few measly acres of the King\u2019s land. His Majesty had quite a lot of it, after all.</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re thinking about it.\u201d We were by this time facing each other, and my hand lay over his, not in restraint, but in acknowledgment.</p><p>He smiled lazily.</p><p>\u201cI havena lived so long by believing everything I\u2019m told, Sassenach. So perhaps I\u2019ll take up the Governor\u2019s kind offer, and perhaps I will not\u2014but I want to know the hell of a lot more about it before I say, one way or the other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, it does seem a little odd\u2014his making you such an offer on short acquaintance.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI should be surprised to hear I am the only gentleman he\u2019s so approached,\u201d Jamie said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s no great risk, now, is it? Ye overheard me telling him I am a Catholic? It was no surprise to him to hear it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. He didn\u2019t seem to think that was a problem, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I daresay it wouldna be\u2014unless the Governor chose to make it one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy goodness.\u201d My evaluation of Governor Tryon was rapidly changing, though I wasn\u2019t sure whether for the better or not. \u201cSo if things didn\u2019t work out as he liked, all he would have to do is let it be known that you\u2019re a Catholic, and a court would take back the land on those grounds. Whereas if he chooses to keep quiet\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd if I choose to do as he likes, aye.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s much sneakier than I thought,\u201d I said, not without admiration. \u201cPractically Scottish.\u201d</p><p>He laughed at that, and brushed the loose hair out of his face.</p><p>The long curtains at the window, hitherto hanging limp, suddenly puffed inward, letting in a breath of air that smelt of sandy mud, river water, and the far-off hint of fresh pines. Dawn was coming, borne on the wind.</p><p>As though this had been a signal, Jamie\u2019s hand cupped itself, and a slight shiver communicated itself from him to me, as the coolness struck his bare back.</p> <p>\u201cI didna really do myself credit earlier,\u201d he said softly. \u201cBut if you\u2019re sure there\u2019s nothing troubling your mind just now...\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d I said, watching the glow from the window touch the line of his head and neck with gold. His mouth was still wide and gentle, but he didn\u2019t look fourteen any longer.</p><p>\u201cNot a thing, just now.\u201d</p><p>8</p><p>MAN OF WORTH</p><p>God, I hate boats!\u201d</p> <p>With this heart-felt valediction ringing in my ears, we swung slowly out into the waters of Wilmington harbor.</p><p>Two days of purchases and preparations found us now bound for Cross Creek. With money from the sale of the ruby in hand, there had been no need to sell the horses; Duncan had been sent with the wagon and the heavier goods, with Myers aboard to guide him, the rest of us to take a quicker, more comfortable passage with Captain Freeman, aboard the Sally Ann.</p><p>A craft of singular and indescribable type, the Sally Ann was square-beamed, long, low-sided, and blunt-prowed. She boasted a tiny cabin that measured roughly six feet square, leaving a scant two feet on either side for passage, and a somewhat greater area of deck fore and aft, this now partially obscured by bundles, bags, and barrels.</p><p>With a single sail mounted on a mast and boom above the cabin, the Sally Ann looked from a distance like a crab on a shingle, waving a flag of truce. The peaty brown waters of the Cape Fear lapped a scant four inches below the rail, and the boards of the bottom were perpetually damp with slow leakage.</p><p>Still, I was happy. Cramped conditions or no, it was good to be on the water, away\u2014if only temporarily\u2014from the Governor\u2019s siren song.</p><p>Jamie wasn\u2019t happy. He did indeed hate boats, with a profound and undying passion, and suffered from a seasickness so acute that watching the swirl of water in a glass could turn him green.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s dead calm,\u201d I observed. \u201cMaybe you won\u2019t be sick.\u201d</p><p>Jamie squinted suspiciously at the chocolate-brown water around us, then clamped his eyes shut as the wake from another boat struck the Sally Ann broadside, rocking her violently.</p> <p>\u201cMaybe not,\u201d he said, in tones indicating that while the suggestion was a hopeful one, he also thought the possibility remote.</p><p>\u201cDo you want the needles? It\u2019s better if I put them in before you vomit.\u201d Resigned, I groped in the pocket of my skirt, where I had placed the small box containing the Chinese acupuncture needles that had saved his life on our Atlantic crossing.</p><p>He shuddered briefly and opened his eyes.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll maybe do. Talk to me, Sassenach\u2014take my mind off my stomach, aye?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d I said obligingly. \u201cWhat is your Aunt Jocasta like?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI havena seen her since I was two years old, so my impressions are a bit lacking,\u201d he replied absently, eyes fixed on a large raft coming down the river, set on an apparent collision course with us. \u201cD\u2019ye think that Negro can manage? Perhaps I ought to give him a bit of help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps you shouldn\u2019t,\u201d I said, eyeing the oncoming raft warily. \u201cHe seems to know what he\u2019s doing.\u201d Besides the captain\u2014a disreputable old wreck who reeked of tobacco\u2014theSally Ann had a single hand, an elderly black freedman who was dealing alone with the steerage of our craft, by means of a large pole.</p><p>The man\u2019s lean muscles flexed and bulged in easy rhythm. Grizzled head bowed in effort, he took no apparent notice of the oncoming barge, but plunged and lifted in a liquid motion that made the long pole seem like a third limb.</p><p>\u201cLet him alone. I suppose you don\u2019t know much about your aunt, then?\u201d I added, in hopes of distracting him. The raft was moving ponderously and inexorably toward us.</p><p>Some forty feet from end to end, it rode low in the water, weighed down with barrels and stacks of hides, tied down under netting. A pungent wave of odor preceded it, of musk and blood and rancid fat, strong enough to overpower temporarily all the other smells of the river.</p><p>\u201cNo; she wed the Cameron of Erracht and left Leoch the year before my mother married my father.\u201d He spoke abstractedly, not looking at me; his attention was all on the oncoming barge. His knuckles whitened; I could feel his urge to leap forward, snatch the pole away from the deckhand, and stave off the raft. I laid a restraining hand on his arm.</p><p>\u201cAnd she never came to visit at Lallybroch?\u201d</p><p>I could see the gleam of sun on dull iron, where it struck cleats along the edge of the raft, and the half-naked forms of the three deckhands, sweating even in the early morning. One of them waved his hat and grinned, shouting something that sounded like, \u201cHah, you!\u201d as they came on.</p><p>\u201cWell, John Cameron died of a flux, and she wed his cousin, Black Hugh Cameron of Aberfeldy, and then\u2014\u201d He shut his eyes reflexively as the raft shot past, its hull no more than six inches from our own, amid a hail of good-natured jeers and shouts from its crew. Rollo, front paws perched on the low cabin roof, barked madly, until Ian cuffed him and told him to stop.</p><p>Jamie opened one eye, then seeing that the danger was past, opened the other and relaxed, letting go his grip on the roof.</p><p>\u201cAye, well, Black Hugh\u2014they called him so for a great black wen on his knee\u2014he was killed hunting, and so then she wed Hector Mor Cameron, of Loch Eilean\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe seems to have had quite a taste for Camerons,\u201d I said, fascinated. \u201cIs there something special about them as a clan\u2014beyond being accident-prone, I mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ve a way wi\u2019 words, I suppose,\u201d he said, with a sudden wry grin. \u201cThe Camerons are poets\u2014and jesters. Sometimes both. Ye\u2019ll remember Lochiel, aye?\u201d</p><p>I smiled, sharing his bittersweet recollection of Donald Cameron of Lochiel, one of the chiefs of clan Cameron at the time of the Rising. A handsome man with a soulful gaze, Lochiel\u2019s gentle-eyed demeanor and elegant manners hid a truly great talent for the creation of vulgar doggerel, with which, sotto voce, he had not infrequently entertained me at balls in Edinburgh, during the brief heyday of Charles Stuart\u2019s coup.</p><p>Jamie was leaning on the roof of the boat\u2019s tiny cabin, watching the river traffic with a wary eye. We had not yet cleared Wilmington\u2019s harbor, and small pirettas and sculls darted past like water bugs, whipping in and out between the larger, slower-moving craft. He was pale, but not green yet.</p><p>I leaned my elbows on the cabin roof as well, and stretched my back. Hot as it was, the heavy sunshine was comforting to the sore muscles caused by impromptu sleeping arrangements; I had spent the last night curled up on a hard oak settle in the taproom of a riverside tavern, sleeping with my head on Jamie\u2019s knee as he completed the arrangements for our passage.</p><p>I groaned and stretched.</p><p>\u201cWas Hector Cameron a poet, or a joker?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeither one at the moment,\u201d Jamie replied, automatically gripping the back of my neck and massaging it with one hand. \u201cHe\u2019s dead, aye?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s wonderful,\u201d I said, groaning with ecstasy as his thumb sank into a particularly tender spot. \u201cWhat you\u2019re doing, I mean, not that your uncle\u2019s dead. Ooh, don\u2019t stop. How did he get to North Carolina?\u201d</p><p>Jamie snorted with amusement, and moved behind me so he could use both hands on my neck and shoulders. I nestled my bottom against him and sighed in bliss.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a verra noisy woman, Sassenach,\u201d he said, leaning forward to whisper in my ear. \u201cYe make the same kind of sounds when I rub your neck as ye do when I\u2014\u201d He thrust his pelvis against me in a discreet but explicit motion that made it quite clear what he meant. \u201cMm?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmmm,\u201d I replied, and kicked him\u2014discreetly\u2014in the shin. \u201cFine. If anyone hears me behind closed doors, they\u2019ll assume you\u2019re rubbing my neck\u2014which is about all you\u2019re likely to do until we get off this floating plank. Now, what about your late uncle?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, him.\u201d His fingers dug in on either side of my backbone, rubbing slowly up and down as he unraveled yet another strand in the tangled web of his family history. At least it was keeping his mind off his stomach.</p><p>Luckier\u2014and either more perceptive or more cynical\u2014than his famous kinsman, Hector Mor Cameron had cannily prepared himself against the eventuality of a Stuart disaster. He had escaped Culloden unwounded and made for home, where he had promptly loaded wife, servant, and portable assets into a coach, in which they fled to Edinburgh and thence by ship to North Carolina, narrowly escaping the Crown\u2019s pursuit.</p><p>Once arrived in the New World, Hector had purchased a large tract of land, cleared the forest, built a house and a sawmill, bought slaves to work the place, planted his land in tobacco and indigo, and\u2014no doubt worn out by so much industry\u2014succumbed to the morbid sore throat at the ripe old age of seventy-three.</p><p>Having evidently decided that three times was enough, Jocasta MacKenzie Cameron Cameron Cameron had\u2014so far as Myers knew\u2014declined to wed again, but stayed on alone as mistress of River Run.</p><p>\u201cDo you think the messenger with your letter will get there before we do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019d get there before we do if he crawled on his hands and knees,\u201d Young Ian said, appearing suddenly beside us. He glanced in mild disgust at the patient deckhand, plunging and lifting his dripping pole. \u201cIt will be weeks before we get there, at this rate. I told ye it would have been best to ride, Uncle Jamie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDinna fret yourself, Ian,\u201d his uncle assured him, letting go of my neck. He grinned at his nephew. \u201cYou\u2019ll have a turn at the pole yourself before long\u2014and I expect ye\u2019ll have us in Cross Creek before nightfall, aye?\u201d</p><p>Ian gave his uncle a dirty look and wandered off to pester Captain Freeman with questions about Red Indians and wild animals.</p><p>\u201cI hope the Captain doesn\u2019t put Ian overboard,\u201d I said, observing Freeman\u2019s scrawny shoulders draw defensively toward his ears as Ian approached. My own neck and shoulders glowed from the attention; so did portions further south. \u201cThanks for the rub,\u201d I said, lifting one eyebrow at him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll let ye return the favor, Sassenach\u2014after dark.\u201d He made an unsuccessful attempt at a leer. Unable to close one eye at a time, his ability to wink lewdly was substantially impaired, but he managed to convey his meaning nonetheless.</p><p>\u201cIndeed,\u201d I said. I fluttered my lashes at him. \u201cAnd just what is it you\u2019d like rubbed after dark?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfter dark?\u201d Ian asked, popping up again like a jack-in-the-box before his uncle could answer. \u201cWhat happens after dark?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s when I drown ye and cut ye up for fish bait,\u201d his uncle informed him. \u201cGod\u2019s sake, can ye not settle, Ian? Ye\u2019re bumpin\u2019 about like a bumblebee in a bottle. Go and sleep in the sun, like your beast\u2014there\u2019s a sensible dog.\u201d He nodded at Rollo, sprawled like a rug on the cabin roof with his eyes half-closed, twitching an occasional ear against the flies.</p> <p>\u201cSleep?\u201d Ian looked at his uncle in amazement. \u201cSleep?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s what normal people do when they\u2019re tired,\u201d I told him, stifling a yawn. The growing heat and the boat\u2019s slow movement were highly soporific, after the short night\u2014we had been up before dawn. Unfortunately, the narrow benches and rough deck planks of the Sally Ann didn\u2019t look any more inviting than the tavern\u2019s settle had been.</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m not a scrap tired, Auntie!\u201d Ian assured me. \u201cI dinna think I\u2019ll sleep for days!\u201d</p><p>Jamie eyed his nephew.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll see if ye still think so, after a turn at the pole. In the meantime, perhaps I can find something to occupy your mind. Wait a bit\u2014\u201d He broke off, and ducked into the low cabin, where I heard him rootling through the baggage.</p> <p>\u201cGod, it\u2019s hot!\u201d said Ian, fanning himself. \u201cWhat\u2019s Uncle Jamie after, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod knows,\u201d I said. Jamie had brought aboard a large crate, about the contents of which he had been most evasive. He had been playing cards when I had fallen asleep the night before, and my best guess was that he had acquired some embarrassing object in the course of gambling, which he was reluctant to expose to Ian\u2019s teasing.</p><p>Ian was right; it was hot. I could only hope that there would be a breeze later; for the moment, the sail above hung limp as a dishcloth, and the fabric of my shift clung damp against my legs. With a murmured word to Ian, I edged past and sidled toward the bow, where the water barrel stood.</p><p>Fergus was standing in the prow, arms crossed, giving a splendid impression of a noble figurehead, with his sternly handsome profile pointed upriver, thick, dark hair flowing back from his brow.</p><p>\u201cAh, milady!\u201d He greeted me with a sudden dazzle of white teeth. \u201cIs this not a splendid country?\u201d</p><p>What I could see at the moment was not particularly splendid, the landscape consisting of an extensive mudflat, reeking in the sun, and a large collection of gulls and seabirds, all raucously excited about something smelly they had found near the water\u2019s edge.</p> <p>\u201cMilord tells me that any man may enter a claim for fifty acres of land, so long as he builds a house upon it, and promises to work it for a period of ten years. Imagine\u2014fifty acres!\u201d He rolled the words around in his mouth, savoring them with a kind of awe. A French peasant might think himself well blessed with five.</p><p>\u201cWell, yes,\u201d I said, a little doubtfully. \u201cI think you ought to pick your fifty acres carefully, though. Some parts of this place aren\u2019t much good for farming.\u201d I didn\u2019t hazard a guess as to how difficult Fergus might find it to carve a farm and homestead out of a howling wilderness with one hand, no matter how fertile the ground.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t paying attention in any case, his eyes shiny with dreams.</p><p>\u201cI might perhaps have a small house built by Hogmanay,\u201d he murmured to himself. \u201cThen I could send for Marsali and the child in the spring.\u201d His hand went automatically to the vacant spot on his chest, where the greenish medal of St. Dismas had hung since his childhood.</p><p>He had come to join us in Georgia, leaving his young and pregnant wife behind in Jamaica, under the care of friends. He assured me that he had no fear for her safety, however, for he had left her also under the protection of his patron saint, with strict instructions not to remove the battered medal from around her neck until she was safely delivered.</p><p>I wouldn\u2019t myself have thought that mothers and babies fell into the sphere of influence of the patron saint of thieves, but Fergus had lived as a pickpocket for all his early life, and his trust in Dismas was absolute.</p><p>\u201cWill you call the baby Dismas, if it\u2019s a boy?\u201d I asked, joking.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said in all seriousness. \u201cI shall call him Germaine. Germaine James Ian Aloysius Fraser\u2014James Ian for Milord and Monsieur,\u201d he explained, for so he always referred to Jamie and his brother-in-law, Ian Murray.</p> <p>\u201cMarsali liked Aloysius,\u201d he added dismissively, making it clear that he had had nothing to do with the choice of so undistinguished a name.</p><p>\u201cAnd what if it\u2019s a girl?\u201d I asked, with a sudden vivid memory. Twenty-odd years before, Jamie had sent me back through the stones, pregnant. And the last thing he had said to me, convinced the child I carried was a boy, was, \u201cName him Brian, for my father.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Fergus had clearly not considered this possibility, either, for he looked vaguely disconcerted. Then his features cleared.</p><p>\u201cGenevieve,\u201d he said firmly. \u201cFor Madame,\u201d by this meaning Jenny Murray, Jamie\u2019s sister. \u201cGenevieve Claire, I think,\u201d he added, with another dazzling smile.</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d I said, flustered and oddly flattered. \u201cWell. Thank you. Are you sure that you ought not to go back to Jamaica to be with Marsali, Fergus?\u201d I asked, changing the subject.</p><p>He shook his head decidedly.</p><p>\u201cMilord may have need of me,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I am of more use here than I should be there. Babies are women\u2019s work, and who knows what dangers we may encounter in this strange place?\u201d</p><p>As though in answer to this rhetorical question, the gulls rose in a squawking cloud, wheeling out over the river and mudflats, revealing the object of their appetite.</p><p>A stout pine stake had been driven into the mud of the bank, the top of it a foot below the dark, weedy line that marked the upper reaches of the incoming tide. The tide was still low; it had reached no higher than halfway up the stake. Above the lapping waves of silty water hung the figure of a man, fastened to the stake by a chain around his chest. Or what had once been his chest.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t tell how long he had been there, but quite long enough, from the looks of him. A narrow gash of white showed the curve of skull where skin and hair had been stripped off. Impossible to say what he had looked like; the birds had been busy.</p><p>Beside me, Fergus said something very obscene in French, softly under his breath.</p><p>\u201cPirate,\u201d said Captain Freeman laconically, coming up beside me and pausing long enough to spit a brown stream of tobacco juice into the river. \u201cIf they ain\u2019t taken to Charleston for hangin\u2019, sometimes they stake \u2019em out at low tide and let the river have \u2019em.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre\u2014are there a lot of them?\u201d Ian had seen it, too; he was much too old to reach for my hand, but he stood close beside me, his face pale under its tan.</p><p>\u201cNot so much, no more. The Navy does a good job keepin\u2019 \u2019em down. But go back a few years, why, you could see four or five pirates out here at a time. Folk would pay to come out by boat, to sit and watch \u2019em drown. Real pretty out here when the tide comes in at sunset,\u201d he said, jaws moving in a slow, nostalgic rhythm. \u201cTurns the water red.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook!\u201d Ian, forgetting his dignity, clutched me by the arm. There was a movement near the riverbank, and we saw what had startled the birds away.</p><p>It slid into the water, a long, scaly form some five or six feet long, carving a deep groove in the soft mud of the bank. On the far side of the boat, the deckhand muttered something under his breath, but didn\u2019t stop his poling.</p><p>\u201cIt is a crocodile,\u201d Fergus said, and made the sign of the horns in distaste.</p><p>\u201cNo, I dinna think so.\u201d Jamie spoke behind me, and I swung around to see him peering over the cabin roof, at the still figure in the water and the V-shaped wake moving toward it. He held a book in his hand, thumb between the pages to hold his place, and now bent his head to consult the volume.</p><p>\u201cI believe it is an alligator. They dine upon carrion, it says here, and willna eat fresh meat. When they take a man or a sheep, they pull the victim beneath the water to drown it, but then drag it to their den below ground and leave it there until it has rotted enough to suit their fancy. Of course,\u201d he added, with a bleak glance at the bank, \u201cthey\u2019re sometimes fortunate enough to find a meal prepared.\u201d</p><p>The figure on the stake seemed to tremble briefly, as something bumped it from below, and Ian made a small choking noise beside me.</p><p>\u201cWhere did you get that book?\u201d I asked, not taking my eyes off the stake. The top of the wooden pole was vibrating, as though something under the waves was worrying at it. Then the pole was still, and the V-shaped wake could be seen again, traveling back toward the riverbank. I turned away before it could emerge.</p><p>Jamie handed me the book, his eyes still fixed on the black mudflat and its cloud of screeching birds.</p><p>\u201cThe Governor gave it to me. He said he thought it might be of interest on our journey.\u201d</p><p>I glanced down at the book. Bound in plain buckram, the title was stamped on the spine in gold leaf\u2014The Natural History of North Carolina.</p><p>\u201cEeugh!\u201d said Ian beside me, watching the scene on shore in horror. \u201cThat\u2019s the most awful thing I\u2019ve ever\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf interest,\u201d I echoed, eyes fixed firmly on the book. \u201cYes, I expect it will be.\u201d</p><p>Fergus, impervious to squeamishness of any kind, was watching the reptile\u2019s progress up the mudbank with interest.</p><p>\u201cAn alligator, you say. Still, it is much the same thing as a crocodile, is it not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I said, shuddering despite the heat. I turned my back on the shore. I had met a crocodile at close range in the Indies, and wasn\u2019t anxious to improve my acquaintance with any of its relatives.</p><p>Fergus wiped sweat from his upper lip, dark eyes intent on the gruesome thing.</p><p>\u201cDr. Stern once told Milord and myself about the travels of a Frenchman named Sonnini, who visited Egypt and wrote much of the sights he had witnessed and the customs he was told of. He said that in that country, the crocodiles copulate upon the muddy banks of the rivers, the female being laid upon her back, and in that position, incapable of rising without the assistance of the male.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, aye?\u201d Ian was all ears.</p><p>\u201cIndeed. He said that some men there, hurried on by the impulses of depravity, would take advantage of this forced situation of the female, and hunt away the male, whereupon they would take his place and enjoy the inhuman embrace of the reptile, which is said to be a most powerful charm for the procurement of rank and riches.\u201d</p><p>Ian\u2019s mouth sagged open.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re no serious, man?\u201d he demanded of Fergus, incredulous. He turned to Jamie. \u201cUncle?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Jamie shrugged, amused.</p><p>\u201cI should rather live poor but virtuous, myself.\u201d He cocked an eyebrow at me. \u201cBesides, I think your auntie wouldna like it much if I was to forsake her embraces for a reptile\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>The black man, listening to this from his position in the bow, shook his head and spoke without looking round.</p><p>\u201cAny man what gone frig with an alligator to get rich, he\u2019s done earnt it, you ask me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI rather think you\u2019re right,\u201d I said, with a vivid memory of the Governor\u2019s charming, toothy smile. I glanced at Jamie, but he was no longer paying attention. His eyes were fixed upriver, intent on possibility, both book and alligator forgotten for the moment. At least he\u2019d forgotten to be sick.</p><p>The tidal surge caught us a mile above Wilmington, allaying Ian\u2019s fears for our speed. The Cape Fear was a tidal river, whose daily surge carried up two-thirds of its length, nearly as far as Cross Creek.</p><p>I felt the river quicken under us, the boat rising an inch or two, then beginning slowly to pick up speed as the power of the incoming tide was funneled up the harbor and into the river\u2019s narrow channel. The slave sighed with relief and hoisted the dripping pole free of the water.</p><p>There would be no need for poling until the surge ran out, in five or six hours. Then we would either anchor for the night and catch the fresh surge of the next incoming tide, or use the sail for further progress, wind allowing. Poling, I was given to understand, was necessary only in case of sandbars or windless days.</p><p>A sense of peaceful somnolence settled over the craft. Fergus and Ian curled up in the bow to sleep, while Rollo kept guard on the roof above, tongue dripping as he panted, eyes half closed against the sun. The Captain and his hand\u2014commonly addressed as \u201cyou, Troklus,\u201d but whose name was actually Eutroclus\u2014disappeared into the tiny cabin, from which I could hear the musical sound of liquid being poured.</p> <p>Jamie was in the cabin, too, having gone to fetch something from his mysterious crate. I hoped it was drinkable; even sitting still on the stern transom with my feet dangling in the water, and with the small breeze of movement stirring the hair on my neck, I could feel sweat forming wherever skin touched skin.</p><p>There were indistinct murmurs in the cabin, and laughter. Jamie came out and turned toward the stern, stepping delicately through the piles of goods like a Clydesdale stallion in a field of frogs, a large wooden box held in his arms.</p><p>He set this gently on my lap, shucked off his shoes and stockings, and sat down beside me, putting his feet in the water with a sigh of pleasure at the coolness.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d I ran my hand curiously over the box.</p><p>\u201cOh, only a wee present.\u201d He didn\u2019t look at me, but the tips of his ears were pink. \u201cOpen it, hm?\u201d</p><p>It was a heavy box, both wide and deep. Carved of a dense, fine-grained dark wood, it bore the marks of heavy use\u2014nicks and dents that had seasoned but not impaired its polished beauty. It was hasped for a lock, but there was none; the lid rose easily on oiled brass hinges, and a whiff of camphor floated out, vaporous as a jinn.</p> <p>The instruments gleamed under the smoky sun, bright despite a hazing of disuse. Each had its own pocket, carefully fitted and lined in green velvet.</p><p>A small, heavy-toothed saw; scissors, three scalpels\u2014round-bladed, straight-bladed, scoop-bladed; the silver blade of a tongue depressor, a tenaculum...</p><p>\u201cJamie!\u201d Delighted, I lifted out a short ebony rod, to the end of which was affixed a ball of worsted, wrapped in rather moth-eaten velvet. I\u2019d seen one before, at Versailles; the eighteenth-century version of a reflex hammer. \u201cOh, Jamie! How wonderful!\u201d</p><p>He wiggled his feet, pleased.</p><p>\u201cOh, ye like it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love it! Oh, look\u2014there\u2019s more in the lid, under this flap\u2014\u201d I stared for a moment at the disjointed tubes, screws, platforms and mirrors, until my mind\u2019s eye shuffled them and presented me with the neatly assembled vision. \u201cA microscope!\u201d I touched it reverently. \u201cMy God, a microscope.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s more,\u201d he pointed out, eager to show me. \u201cThe front opens and there are wee drawers inside.\u201d</p><p>There were\u2014containing, among other things, a miniature balance and set of brass weights, a tile for rolling pills, and a stained marble mortar, its pestle wrapped in cloth to prevent its being cracked in transit. Inside the front, above the drawers, were row upon row of small, corked bottles made of stone or glass.</p> <p>\u201cOh, they\u2019re beautiful!\u201d I said, handling the small scalpel with reverence. The polished wood of the handle fit my hand as though it had been made for me, the blade weighted to an exquisite balance. \u201cOh, Jamie, thank you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYe like them, then?\u201d His ears had gone bright red with pleasure. \u201cI thought they\u2019d maybe do. I\u2019ve no notion what they\u2019re meant for, but I could see they were finely made.\u201d</p><p>I had no notion what some of the pieces were meant for, but all of them were beautiful in themselves; made by or for a man who loved his tools and what they did.</p><p>\u201cWho did they belong to, I wonder?\u201d I breathed heavily on the rounded surface of a lenticular and brought it to a soft gleam with a fold of my skirt.</p><p>\u201cThe woman who sold it to me didna ken; he left behind his doctor\u2019s book, though, and I took that, as well\u2014perhaps it will give his name.\u201d</p><p>Lifting the top tray of instruments, he revealed another, shallower tray, from which he drew out a fat square-bound book, some eight inches wide, covered in scuffed black leather.</p><p>\u201cI thought ye might be wanting a book, too, like the one ye kept in France,\u201d he explained. \u201cThe one where ye kept the pictures and the notes of the people ye saw at L\u2019H\u00f4pital. He\u2019s written a bit in this one, but there\u2019s a deal of blank pages left at the back.\u201d</p><p>Perhaps a quarter of the book had been used; the pages were covered with a closely written, fine black script, interspersed with drawings that took my eye with their clinical familiarity: an ulcerated toe, a shattered kneecap, the skin neatly peeled aside; the grotesque swelling of advanced goiter, and a dissection of the calf muscles, each neatly labeled.</p><p>I turned back to the inside cover; sure enough, his name was written on the first page, adorned with a small, gentlemanly flourish: Dr. Daniel Rawlings, Esq.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened to Dr. Rawlings, I wonder? Did the woman who had the box say?\u201d</p><p>Jamie nodded, his brow slightly creased.</p><p>\u201cThe Doctor lodged with her for a night. He said he\u2019d come from Virginia, where his home was, bound upon some errand, and his case with him. He was looking for a man named Garver\u2014she thought that was the name, at least. But that night after supper he went out\u2014and never came back.\u201d</p><p>I stared at him.</p><p>\u201cNever came back? Did she find out what happened to him?\u201d</p><p>Jamie shook his head, batting away a small cloud of midges. The sun was sinking, painting the surface of the water gold and orange, and bugs were beginning to gather as the afternoon cooled into evening.</p><p>\u201cNo. She went to the sheriff, and to the justice, and the constable searched high and low\u2014but there was nay sign of the man. They looked for a week, and then gave up. He had never told his landlady which town it was in Virginia, so they couldna trace him further.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow very odd.\u201d I wiped a droplet of moisture off my chin. \u201cWhen did the Doctor disappear?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA year past, she said.\u201d He looked at me, a little anxious. \u201cYe dinna mind? Using his things, I mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I closed the lid and stroked it gently, the dark wood warm and smooth under my fingers. \u201cIf it were me\u2014I\u2019d want someone to use them.\u201d</p><p>I remembered vividly the feel of my own doctor\u2019s bag\u2014cordovan leather, with my initials stamped in gilt on the handle. Originally stamped in gilt on the handle, that is; they had long since worn off, the leather gone smooth and shiny, rich with handling. Frank had given me the bag when I graduated from medical school; I had given it to my friend Joe Abernathy, wanting it to be used by someone who would treasure it as I had.</p><p>He saw the shadow drift across my face\u2014I saw the reflection of it darken his\u2014but I took his hand and smiled as I squeezed it.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a wonderful gift. However did you find it?\u201d</p><p>He smiled then, in return. The sun blazed low, a brilliant orange ball glimpsed briefly through dark treetops.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d seen the box when I went to the goldsmith\u2019s shop\u2014it was the goldsmith\u2019s wife who\u2019d kept it. Then I went back yesterday, meaning to buy ye a bit of jewelry\u2014maybe a brooch\u2014and whilst the goodwife was showing me the gauds, we happened to speak of this and that, and she told me of the Doctor, and\u2014\u201d He shrugged.</p><p>\u201cWhy did you want to buy me jewelry?\u201d I looked at him, puzzled. The sale of the ruby had left us with a bit of money, but extravagance was not at all like him, and under the circumstances\u2014</p><p>\u201cOh! To make up for sending all that money to Laoghaire? I didn\u2019t mind; I said I didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>He had\u2014with some reluctance\u2014arranged to send the bulk of the proceeds from the sale of the stone to Scotland, in payment of a promise made to Laoghaire MacKenzie\u2014damn her eyes\u2014Fraser, whom he had married at his sister\u2019s persuasion while under the rather logical impression that if I was not dead, I was at least not coming back. My apparent resurrection from the dead had caused any amount of complications, Laoghaire not least among them.</p><p>\u201cAye, ye said so,\u201d he said, openly cynical.</p><p>\u201cI meant it\u2014more or less,\u201d I said, and laughed. \u201cYou couldn\u2019t very well let the beastly woman starve to death, appealing as the idea is.\u201d</p><p>He smiled, faintly.</p><p>\u201cNo. I shouldna like to have that on my conscience; there\u2019s enough without. But that\u2019s not why I wished to buy ye a present.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy, then?\u201d The box was heavy; a gracious, substantial, satisfying weight across my legs, its wood a delight under my hands. He turned his head to look full at me, then, his hair fire-struck with the setting sun, face dark in silhouette.</p><p>\u201cTwenty-four years ago today, I married ye, Sassenach,\u201d he said softly. \u201cI hope ye willna have cause yet to regret it.\u201d</p><p>The river\u2019s edge was settled, rimmed with plantations from Wilmington to Cross Creek. Still, the banks were thickly forested, with only the occasional glimpse of fields where a break in the trees showed plantings, or every so often, a wooden dock, half-hidden in the foliage.</p><p>We proceeded slowly upriver, following the tidal surge so long as it lasted, tying up for the night when it ran out. We ate dinner by a small fire on shore, but slept on the boat, Eutroclus having casually mentioned the prevalence of water moccasins, who\u2014he said\u2014inhabited dens beneath the riverbank but were much inclined to come and warm their cold blood next to the bodies of unwary sleepers.</p><p>I awoke soon before dawn, stiff and sore from sleeping on boards, hearing the soft rush of a vessel passing on the river nearby, feeling the push of its wake against our hull. Jamie stirred in his sleep when he felt me move, turned over, and clasped me to his bosom. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I could feel his body curled behind mine, in its paradoxical morning state of sleep and arousal. He made a drowsy noise and moved against me in inquiry, his hand fumbling at the hem of my rumpled shift.</p><p>\u201cStop,\u201d I said under my breath, batting his hand away. \u201cRemember where we are, for God\u2019s sake!\u201d</p><p>I could hear the shouts and barking of Ian and Rollo, galumphing to and fro on the shore, and small stirrings in the cabin, featuring hawking and spitting noises, indicating the imminent emergence of Captain Freeman.</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d said Jamie, coming to the surface of consciousness. \u201cOh, aye. A pity, that.\u201d He reached up, squeezed my br**sts with both hands, and stretched his body with voluptuous slowness against me, giving me a detailed idea of what I was missing.</p> <p>\u201cAh, well,\u201d he said, relaxing reluctantly, but not yet letting go. \u201cFoeda est in coitu, um?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt what?\u201d</p><p>\u201c \u2018Foeda est in coitu et breois voluptas\u2019 \u201d he recited obligingly. \u201c \u2018Et taedat Veneiis statim peractae. Doing, a filthy pleasure is\u2014and short. And done, we straight repent us of the sport.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>I glanced down at the stained boards under us. \u201cWell, perhaps \u2018filthy\u2019 isn\u2019t altogether the wrong word,\u201d I began, \u201cbut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not the filthiness that troubles me, Sassenach,\u201d he interrupted, scowling at Ian, who was hanging over the side of the boat, shouting encouragement to Rollo as he swam. \u201cIt\u2019s the short.\u201d</p> <p>He glanced at me, scowl changing to a look of approval as he took in my state of dishevelment. \u201cI mean to take my time about it, aye?\u201d</p><p>This classical start to the day seemed to have had some lasting influence on Jamie\u2019s mind. I could hear them at it as I sat in the afternoon sun, thumbing through Daniel Rawlings\u2019s casebook\u2014at once entertained, enlightened, and appalled at the things recorded there.</p><p>I could hear Jamie\u2019s voice in the ordered rise and fall of ancient Greek. I had heard that bit before\u2014 a passage from the Odyssey. He paused, with an expectant rise.</p><p>\u201cAh...\u201d said Ian.</p><p>\u201cWhat comes next, Ian?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEr...\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOnce more,\u201d said Jamie, with a slight edge to his voice. \u201cPay attention, man. I\u2019m no talkin\u2019 for the pleasure of hearin\u2019 myself, aye?\u201d He began again, the elegant, formal verse warming to life as he spoke.</p><p>He might not take pleasure in hearing himself, but I did. I had no Greek myself, but the rise and fall of syllables in that soft, deep voice was as soothing as the lap of water against the hull.</p><p>Reluctantly accepting his nephew\u2019s continued presence, Jamie took his guardianship of Ian with due seriousness, and had been tutoring the lad as we traveled, seizing odd moments of leisure to teach\u2014or attempt to teach\u2014the lad the rudiments of Greek and Latin grammar, and to improve his mathematics and conversational French.</p><p>Fortunately, Ian had the same quick grasp of mathematical principles as his uncle; the side of the small cabin beside me was covered with elegant Euclidean proofs, carried out in burnt stick. When the subject turned to languages, though, they found less common ground.</p><p>Jamie was a natural polygogue; he acquired languages and dialects with no visible effort, picking up idioms as a dog picks up foxtails in a romp through the fields. In addition, he had been schooled in the Classics at the Universit\u00e9 in Paris, and\u2014while disagreeing now and then with some of the Roman philosophers\u2014regarded both Homer and Virgil as personal friends.</p><p>Ian spoke the Gaelic and English with which he had been raised, and a sort of low French patois acquired from Fergus, and felt this quite sufficient to his needs. True, he had an impressive repertoire of swear words in six or seven other languages\u2014acquired from exposure to a number of disreputable influences in the recent past, not least of these being his uncle\u2014but he had no more than a vague apprehension of the mysteries of Latin conjugation.</p><p>Still less did he have an appreciation for the necessity of learning languages that to him were not only dead, but\u2014he clearly thought\u2014long decayed beyond any possibility of usefulness. Homer couldn\u2019t compete with the excitement of this new country, adventure reaching out from both shores with beckoning green hands.</p><p>Jamie finished his Greek passage, and with a sigh clearly audible to me where I sat, directed Ian to take out the Latin book he had borrowed from Governor Tryon\u2019s library. With no recitation to distract me, I returned to my perusal of Dr. Rawlings\u2019s casebook.</p> <p>Like myself, the Doctor had plainly had some Latin, but preferred English for the bulk of his notes, dropping into Latin only for an occasional formal entry.</p><p>Bled Mr. Beddoes of a pt. Note distinct lessening of the bilious humor, his complexion much improved of the yellowness and pustules which have afflicted him. Administered black draught to assist purifying of the blood.</p><p>\u201cAss,\u201d I muttered\u2014not for the first time. \u201cCan\u2019t you see the man\u2019s got liver disease?\u201d Probably a mild cirrhosis; Rawlings had noted a slight enlargement and hardening of the liver\u2014though he attributed this to excessive production of bile. Most likely alcohol poisoning; the pustules on face and chest were characteristic of a nutritional deficiency that I saw commonly associated with excessive alcohol consumption\u2014and God knew, that was epidemic.</p><p>Beddoes, if he were still alive\u2014a prospect I considered doubtful\u2014was likely drinking anything up to a quart of mixed spirit daily and hadn\u2019t so much as smelled a green vegetable in months. The pustules on whose disappearance Rawlings was congratulating himself had likely diminished because he had used turnip leaves as a coloring agent in his special receipt for \u201cblack draught.\u201d</p><p>Absorbed in my reading, I half heard Ian\u2019s stumbling rendition of Plautus\u2019s Vertue from the other side of the cabin, interrupted in every other line by Jamie\u2019s deeper voice, prompting and correcting.</p><p>\u201c \u2018Virtus praemium est optimus...\u2019 \u201d</p><p>\u201cOptimum.\u201d</p><p>\u201c \u2018...est optimum. Virtus omnibus rebus\u2019 and...ah...and...\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnteit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank ye, Uncle. \u2018Virtus omnibus rebus anteit...profectus\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cProfecto.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, aye, profecto. Um...\u2018Virtus\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLibertas. \u2018Libertas salus vita res et parentes, patria et prognati...\u2019 d\u2019ye recall what is meant by \u2018vita,\u2019 Ian?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLife,\u201d came Ian\u2019s voice, seizing gratefully on this buoyant object in a flounderous sea.</p><p>\u201cAye, that\u2019s good, but it\u2019s more than life. In Latin, it means not only being alive but it\u2019s also a man\u2019s substance, what he\u2019s made of. See, then it goes on, \u2018...libertas salus vita res et parentes, patria et prognati tutantur, servantur; virtus omnia in sese habet, omnia adsunt bona quem penest virtus.\u2019 Now, what is he sayin\u2019 there, d\u2019ye think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh...virtue is a good thing?\u201d Ian ventured.</p><p>There was a momentary silence, during which I could almost hear Jamie\u2019s blood pressure rising. A hiss of indrawn breath, then, as he thought better of whatever he had been about to say, a long-suffering exhalation.</p><p>\u201cMmphm. Look ye, Ian. \u2018Tutantur, servantur.\u2019 What does he mean by using those two together, instead of putting it as...\u201d My attention faded, drawn back to the book, wherein Dr. Rawlings now gave account of a duel and its consequences.</p><p>May 15. Was called from my bed at dawn to attend a gentleman staying at the Red Dog. Found him in sad case, with a wound to his hand, occasioned by the misfire of a pistol, the thumb and index fingers of the hand being blown off altogether by the explosion, the middle finger badly mangled and two-thirds of the hand so lacerated that it was scarce recognizable as a human appendage.</p><p>Determining that only prompt amputation would serve, I sent for the landlord and requested a pannikin of brandy, linen for bandages, and the help of two strong men. These being rapidly provided and the patient suitably restrained, I proceeded to take the hand\u2014it was the right, to the misfortune of the patient\u2014off just above the wrist. Successfully ligated two arteries, but the anterior interosseus escaped me, being retracted into the flesh after I sawed through the bones. Was forced to loosen the tourniquet in order to find it, so bleeding was considerable\u2014a fortunate accident, as the copious outpouring of blood rendered the patient insensible and thus put an end for the moment to his agony, as well as to his struggles, which were greatly hampering my work.</p><p>The amputation being successfully concluded, the gentleman was put to bed, but I stayed near at hand, lest he regain consciousness abruptly and in random movement do hurt to my stitching.</p><p>This fascinating narrative was interrupted by a sudden outburst from Jamie, who had evidently reached the end of his patience.</p><p>\u201cIan, your Latin would disgrace a dog! And as for the rest, ye havena got enough understanding of Greek to tell the difference between water and wine!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf they\u2019re drinkin\u2019 it, it\u2019s not water,\u201d Ian muttered, sounding rebellious.</p><p>I closed the book and got hastily to my feet. It sounded rather as though the services of a referee might shortly be called for. Ian was making small Scottish noises of discontent as I rounded the cabin.</p><p>\u201cAye, mphm, but I dinna care so much\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, ye don\u2019t care! That\u2019s the true pity of it\u2014that ye havena the grace even to feel shame for your ignorance!\u201d</p><p>There was a charged silence after this, broken only by the soft splash of Troklus\u2019s pole in the bow. I peeked around the corner, to see Jamie glaring at his nephew, who looked abashed. Ian glanced at me, coughed and cleared his throat.</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019ll tell ye, Uncle Jamie, if I thought shame would help, I wouldna scruple to blush.\u201d</p><p>He looked so apologetically hangdog that I couldn\u2019t help laughing. Jamie turned, hearing me, and his scowl faded slightly.</p><p>\u201cYe\u2019re not a bit of help, Sassenach,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019ve the Latin, have ye not? Being a physician, ye must. Perhaps I should leave his Latin schooling to you, aye?\u201d</p><p>I shook my head. While it was more or less true that I could read Latin\u2014badly and laboriously\u2014I didn\u2019t fancy trying to cram the ragbag remnants of my education into Ian\u2019s head.</p><p>\u201cAll I remember is Arma virumque cano.\u201d I glanced at Ian and translated, grinning. \u201cMy arm got bit off by a dog.\u201d</p><p>Ian burst into giggles, and Jamie gave me a look of profound disillusion.</p><p>He sighed and ran a hand through his hair. While Jamie and Ian didn\u2019t resemble each other in any physical respect beyond height, both had thick hair and the habit of running a hand through it when agitated or thoughtful. It looked to have been a stressful lesson\u2014both of them looked as though they\u2019d been pulled backward through a hedgerow.</p><p>Jamie smiled wryly at me, then turned back to Ian, shaking his head.</p><p>\u201cAh, well. I\u2019m sorry to bark at ye, Ian, truly. But ye\u2019ve a fine mind, and I shouldna like to see ye waste it. God, man, at your age, I was in Paris, already starting in to study at the Universit\u00e9!\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Ian stood looking down into the water that swirled past the side of the ship in smooth brown riffles. His hands rested on the rail; big hands, broad-backed and browned by the sun.</p><p>\u201cAye,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd at my age, my own father was in France, too. Fighting.\u201d</p><p>I was a bit startled to hear this. I had known that the elder Ian had soldiered in France for a time, but not that he had gone so early for a soldier\u2014nor stayed so long. Young Ian was just fifteen. The elder Ian had served as a foreign mercenary from that age, then, until the age of twenty-two; when a cannon blast had left him with a leg so badly shattered by grapeshot that it had been amputated just below the knee\u2014and he had come home for good.</p><p>Jamie looked at his nephew for a moment, frowning slightly. Then he came to stand beside Ian, leaning backward, hands on the rail to balance himself.</p> <p>\u201cI ken that, aye?\u201d Jamie said quietly. \u201cFor I followed him, four years later, when I was outlawed.\u201d</p><p>Ian looked up at that, startled.</p><p>\u201cYe were together there in France?\u201d</p><p>There was a slight breeze caused by our movement, but it was still a hot day. Perhaps the temperature decided him that it was better to let the subject of higher learning drop for a moment, for Jamie nodded, lifting the thick tail of his hair to cool his neck.</p><p>\u201cIn Flanders. For more than a year, before Ian was wounded and sent home. We fought wi\u2019 a regiment of Scots mercenaries then\u2014under Fergus mac Leodhas.\u201d</p> <p>Ian\u2019s eyes were alight with interest.</p><p>\u201cIs that where Fergus\u2014our Fergus\u2014got his name, then?\u201d</p><p>His uncle smiled.</p><p>\u201cAye, I named him for mac Leodhas; a bonny man, and a great soldier, forbye. He thought weel o\u2019 Ian. Did your Da never speak to you of him?\u201d</p><p>Ian shook his head, his brow slightly clouded.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s never said a thing to me. I\u2014I kent he\u2019d lost his leg fighting in France\u2014Mam told me that, when I asked\u2014but he wouldna say a word about it, himself.\u201d</p> <p>With Dr. Rawlings\u2019s description of amputation vivid in my mind, I thought it likely that the elder Ian hadn\u2019t wanted to recall the occasion.</p><p>Jamie shrugged, plucking the sweat-damp shirt away from his chest.</p><p>\u201cAye, well. I suppose he meant to put that time behind him, once he\u2019d come home and settled at Lallybroch. And then...\u201d He hesitated, but Ian was insistent.</p><p>\u201cAnd then what, Uncle Jamie?\u201d</p><p>Jamie glanced at his nephew, and one side of his mouth curled up.</p><p>\u201cWell, I think he didna want to tell too many tales of war and fighting, lest you lads get thinking on it and set yourselves to go for soldiers, too. He and your mother will ha\u2019 wanted better for you, aye?\u201d</p><p>I thought the elder Ian had been wise; it was clear from the look on his face that the younger Ian couldn\u2019t think of a much more exciting prospect than war and fighting.</p><p>\u201cThat will ha\u2019 been my Mam\u2019s doing,\u201d Ian said, with an air of disgust. \u201cShe\u2019d have me wrapped in wool and tied to her apron strings, did I let her.\u201d</p> <p>Jamie grinned.</p><p>\u201cOh, let her, is it? And d\u2019ye think she\u2019d wrap ye in wool and smother ye wi\u2019 kisses if ye were home this minute?\u201d</p><p>Ian dropped the pose of disdain.</p><p>\u201cWell, no,\u201d he admitted. \u201cI think she\u2019d skelp me raw.\u201d</p><p>Jamie laughed.</p><p>\u201cYe know a bit about women, Ian, if not so much as ye think.\u201d</p><p>Ian glanced skeptically from his uncle to me, and back.</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019ll ken all about them, I suppose, Uncle?\u201d</p><p>I raised one eyebrow, inviting an answer to this, but Jamie merely laughed.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a wise man who kens the limits of his knowledge, Ian.\u201d He bent and kissed my damp forehead, then turned back to his nephew, adding, \u201cThough I could wish your own limits went a bit further.\u201d</p><p>Ian shrugged, looking bored.</p><p>\u201cI dinna mean to set up for a gentleman,\u201d he said. \u201cAfter all, Young Jamie and Michael dinna read Greek; they do well enough!\u201d</p><p>Jamie rubbed his nose, considering his nephew thoughtfully.</p><p>\u201cYoung Jamie has Lallybroch. And wee Michael does well wi\u2019 Jared in Paris. They\u2019ll be settled. We did as best we might for the two o\u2019 them, but there was precious little money to pay for travel or schooling when they came to manhood. There wasna much choice for them, aye?\u201d</p><p>He pushed himself off the rail and stood upright.</p><p>\u201cBut your parents dinna want that for you, Ian, if better might be managed. They\u2019d have ye grow to be a man of learning and influence; duine uasal, perhaps.\u201d It was a Gaelic expression I had heard before, literally \u201ca man of worth.\u201d It was the term for tacksmen and lairds, the men of property and followers who ranked only below chieftains in the Highland clans.</p><p>Such a man as Jamie himself had been, before the Rising. But not now.</p><p>\u201cMmphm. And did ye do as your parents wanted for ye, then, Uncle Jamie?\u201d Ian looked blandly at his uncle, with only a wary twitch of the eye to show he knew he was treading on shaky ground. Jamie had been meant to be duine uasal, indeed; Lallybroch had been his by right. It was only in an effort to save the property from confiscation by the Crown that he had made it over legally to Young Jamie, instead.</p><p>Jamie stared at him for a moment, then rubbed a knuckle across his upper lip before replying.</p><p>\u201cI did say ye\u2019d a fine mind, no?\u201d he answered dryly. \u201cThough since ye ask...I was raised to do two things, Ian. To mind my land and people, and to care for my family. I\u2019ve done those two things, as best I might\u2014and I shall go on doing them as best I can.\u201d</p><p>Young Ian had the grace to look abashed at this.</p><p>\u201cAye, well, I didna mean...\u201d he mumbled, looking at his feet.</p><p>\u201cDinna fash, laddie,\u201d Jamie interrupted, clapping him on the shoulder. He grinned wryly at his nephew. \u201cYe\u2019ll amount to something for your mother\u2019s sake\u2014if it kills us both. And now I think it will be my turn at the pole.\u201d</p><p>He glanced forward, to where Troklus\u2019s shoulders gleamed like oily copper, snake-muscled with long labor. Jamie untied his breeches\u2014unlike the other men, he would not take off his shirt for poling, but stripped his breeks for coolness and worked with his shirt knotted between his thighs, in the Highland style\u2014and nodded to Ian.</p><p>\u201cYou think about it, laddie. Youngest son or no, your life\u2019s not meant to be wasted.\u201d</p><p>He smiled at me then, with a sudden heart-stopping brilliance, and handed me his shed breeks. Then, still holding my hand in his, he stood upright and, hand over heart, declaimed,</p><p>\u201cAmo, amas, I love a lass,</p><p>As cedar tall and slender;</p><p>Sweet cowslip\u2019s grace</p><p>Is her nominative case,</p><p>And she\u2019s o\u2019 the feminine gender.\u201d</p><p>He nodded graciously to Ian, who had dissolved in giggles, and lifted my hand to his lips, blue eyes aslant with mischief.</p><p>\u201cCan I decline a nymph so divine?</p><p>Her voice like a flute is dulcis;</p><p>Her oculus bright, her manus white</p><p>And soft, when I tacto, her pulse is.</p><p>O bow belle, my puella</p><p>I\u2019ll kiss in secula seculorum;</p><p>If I\u2019ve luck, sir, she\u2019s my uxor,</p><p>O dies benedictorum.\u201d</p><p>He made a courtly leg to me, blinked solemnly in his version of a wink, and strode off in his shirt.</p><p>9</p><p>TWO-THIRDS OF A GHOST</p><p>The surface of the river gleamed like oil, the water moving gently past without a ripple. There was a single lantern hung from the starboard bow; sitting on a low stool perched on the forward deck, I could see the light below, not so much reflected in the water as trapped under it, moving slowly side by side with the boat.</p><p>The moon was a faint sickle, making its feeble sweep through the treetops. Beyond the thick trees that lined the river, the ground fell away in broad sweeps of darkness, over the rice plantations and tobacco fields. The heat of the day was sucked down into the earth, glowing with unseen energy beneath the surface of the soil, the rich, fertile flatlands simmering in black heat behind the screen of pines and sweetgum trees, working the alchemy of water and trapped sun.</p><p>To move at all was to break a sweat. The air was tangible, each tiny ripple of warmth a caress against my face and arms.</p><p>There was a soft rustle in the dark behind me, and I reached up a hand, not turning to look. Jamie\u2019s big hand closed gently over mine, squeezed and let go. Even that brief touch left my fingers damp with perspiration.</p><p>He eased himself down next to me with a sigh, plucking at the collar of his shirt.</p><p>\u201cI dinna think I\u2019ve breathed air since we left Georgia,\u201d he said. \u201cEvery time I take a breath, I think I\u2019ll maybe drown.\u201d</p><p>I laughed, feeling a trickle of sweat snake down between my br**sts.</p><p>\u201cIt will be cooler in Cross Creek; everyone says so.\u201d I took a deep breath myself, just to prove I could. \u201cDoesn\u2019t it smell wonderful, though?\u201d The darkness released all the pungent green scents of the trees and plants along the water\u2019s edge, mingling with the damp mud of the riverbank and the scent of sun-warmed wood from the deck of the boat.</p><p>\u201cYe\u2019d have made a good dog, Sassenach.\u201d He leaned back against the wall of the cabin with a sigh. \u201cIt\u2019s no wonder yon beast admires ye so.\u201d</p><p>The click of toenails on deckboards announced the arrival of Rollo, who advanced cautiously toward the rail, stopped a careful foot short of it, and lowered himself gingerly to the deck. He laid his nose on his paws and sighed deeply. Rollo disapproved almost as strongly of boats as Jamie did.</p><p>\u201cHullo there,\u201d I said. I extended a hand for him to sniff, and he politely condescended to let me scratch his ears. \u201cAnd where\u2019s your master, eh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn the cabin, bein\u2019 taught new ways to cheat at cards,\u201d Jamie said wryly. \u201cGod kens best what will happen to the lad; if he\u2019s not shot or knocked on the head in some tavern, he\u2019ll likely come home wi\u2019 an ostrich he\u2019s won at faro next.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSurely they haven\u2019t either ostriches or faro games up in the mountains? If there aren\u2019t any towns to speak of, surely there aren\u2019t many taverns, either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I shouldna think so,\u201d he admitted. \u201cBut if a man\u2019s bound to go to the devil, he\u2019ll find a way to do it, no matter where ye set him down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure Ian isn\u2019t going to the devil,\u201d I replied soothingly. \u201cHe\u2019s a fine boy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a man,\u201d Jamie corrected. He cocked an ear toward the cabin, where I could hear muffled laughter and the occasional comfortable obscenity. \u201cA damn young one, though, and fat-heided with it.\u201d He looked at me, a rueful smile visible in the lantern light.</p><p>\u201cIf he were a wee lad yet, I could keep some rein on him. As it is\u2014\u201d He shrugged. \u201cHe\u2019s old enough to mind his own business, and he\u2019ll not thank me for sticking my nose in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe always listens to you,\u201d I protested.</p><p>\u201cMmphm. Wait till I tell him something he doesna want to hear.\u201d He leaned his head against the wall, closing his eyes. Sweat gleamed across the high cheekbones, and a small trickle ran down the side of his neck. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I put out a finger and delicately flicked the tiny drop away, before it further dampened his shirt.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been telling him for two months that he has to go home to Scotland; he doesn\u2019t want to hear that, I don\u2019t think.\u201d</p><p>Jamie opened one eye and surveyed me cynically.</p><p>\u201cIs he in Scotland?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell...\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmphm,\u201d he said, and closed the eye again.</p><p>I sat quietly for a bit, blotting the perspiration off my face with a fold of my skirt. The river had narrowed here; the near bank was no more than ten feet away. I caught a rustle of movement among the shrubs, and a pair of eyes gleamed briefly red with reflected light from our lantern.</p><p>Rollo lifted his head with a sudden low Woof, ears pricked to attention. Jamie opened his eyes and glanced at the bank, then sat up abruptly.</p><p>\u201cChrist! That\u2019s the biggest rat I\u2019ve ever seen!\u201d</p> <p>I laughed.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a rat; it\u2019s a possum. See the babies on her back?\u201d</p><p>Jamie and Rollo regarded the possum with identical looks of calculation, assessing its plumpness and possible speed. Four small possums stared solemnly back, pointed noses twitching over their mother\u2019s humped, indifferent back. Obviously thinking the boat no threat, the mother possum finished lapping water, turned, and trundled slowly into the brush, the tip of her nak*d thick pink tail disappearing as the lantern light faded.</p><p>The two hunters let out identical sighs, and relaxed again.</p><p>\u201cMyers did say as they\u2019re fine eating,\u201d Jamie remarked wistfully. With a small sigh of my own, I groped in the pocket of my gown and handed him a cloth bag.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d He peered interestedly into the bag, then poured the small, lumpy brown objects out into the palm of his hand.</p> <p>\u201cRoasted peanuts,\u201d I said. \u201cThey grow underground hereabouts. I found a farmer selling them for hogfood, and had the inn-wife roast some for me. You take off the shells before you eat them.\u201d I grinned at him, enjoying the novel sensation of for once knowing more about our surroundings than he did.</p><p>He gave me a mildly dirty look, and crushed a shell between thumb and forefinger, yielding three nuts.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m ignorant, Sassenach,\u201d he said. \u201cNot a fool. There\u2019s a difference, aye?\u201d He put a peanut in his mouth and bit down gingerly. His skeptical look changed to one of pleased surprise, and he chewed with increasing enthusiasm, tossing the other nuts into his mouth.</p><p>\u201cLike them?\u201d I smiled, enjoying his pleasure. \u201cI\u2019ll make you peanut butter for your bread, once we\u2019re settled and I have my new mortar unpacked.\u201d</p><p>He smiled back and swallowed before cracking another nut.</p><p>\u201cI will say that if it\u2019s a swampish place, at least it\u2019s fine soil. I\u2019ve never seen so many things grow so easily.\u201d</p><p>He tossed another nut into his mouth.</p><p>\u201cI have been thinking, Sassenach,\u201d he said, looking down into the palm of his hand. \u201cWhat would ye think of maybe settling here?\u201d</p> <p>The question wasn\u2019t entirely unexpected. I had seen him eyeing the black fields and lush crops with a farmer\u2019s glittering eye, and caught his wistful expression when he admired the Governor\u2019s horses.</p><p>We couldn\u2019t go back to Scotland immediately, in any case. Young Ian, yes, but not Jamie or me, owing to certain complications\u2014not the least of these being a complication by the name of Laoghaire MacKenzie.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d I said slowly. \u201cIndians and wild animals quite aside\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOch, well,\u201d he interrupted, mildly embarrassed. \u201cMyers told me they were no difficulty at all, and ye keep clear of the mountains.\u201d</p><p>I forbore from pointing out that the Governor\u2019s offer would take us into the precincts of precisely those mountains.</p><p>\u201cYes, but you do remember what I told you, don\u2019t you? About the Revolution? This is 1767, and you heard the conversation at the Governor\u2019s table. Nine years, Jamie, and all hell breaks loose.\u201d We had both lived through war, and neither of us took the thought lightly. I laid a hand on his arm, forcing him to look at me.</p><p>\u201cI was right, you know\u2014before.\u201d I had known what would happen at Culloden; had told him the fate of Charles Stuart and his men. And neither my knowing nor his had been enough to save us. Twenty aching years of separation, and the ghost of a daughter he would never see lay behind that knowing.</p><p>He nodded slowly, and lifted a hand to touch my cheek. The soft glow of the small lantern overhead attracted clouds of tiny gnats; they swirled suddenly, disturbed by his movement.</p><p>\u201cAye, ye were,\u201d he said softly. \u201cBut then\u2014we thought we must change things. Or try, at the least. But here\u2014\u201d He turned, waving an arm at the vast land that lay unseen beyond the trees. \u201cI shouldna think it my business,\u201d he said simply. \u201cEither to help or to hinder much.\u201d</p><p>I waved the gnats away from my face.</p><p>\u201cIt might be our business, if we lived here.\u201d</p><p>He rubbed a finger below his lower lip, thinking. His beard was sprouting, a glimmer of red stubble sparked with silver in the lantern light. He was a big man, handsome and strong in the prime of his life, but no longer a young one, and I realized that with sudden gratitude.</p><p>Highland men were bred to fight; Highland boys became men when they could lift their swords and go to battle. Jamie had never been reckless, but he had been a warrior and a soldier most of his life. As a young man in his twenties, nothing could have kept him from a fight, whether it was his own or not. Now, in his forties, sense might temper passion\u2014or at least I hoped so.</p><p>And it was true; beyond this aunt whom he didn\u2019t know, he had no family here, no ties that might compel involvement. Perhaps, knowing what was coming, we might contrive to stay clear of the worst?</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a verra big place, Sassenach.\u201d He looked out over the prow of the boat, into the vast black sweep of invisible land. \u201cOnly since we left Georgia, we have traveled farther than the whole length of Scotland and England both.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s true,\u201d I admitted. In Scotland, even among the high crags of the Highlands, there had been no way to escape the ravages of war. Not so here; should we seek our place carefully, we might indeed escape the roving eye of Mars.</p><p>He tilted his head to one side, smiling up at me.</p><p>\u201cI could see ye as a planter\u2019s lady, Sassenach. If the Governor will find me a buyer for the other stones, then I shall have enough, I think, to send Laoghaire all the money I promised her, and still have enough over to buy a good place\u2014one where we might prosper.\u201d</p><p>He took my right hand in his, his thumb gently stroking my silver wedding ring.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps one day I shall deck ye in laces and jewels,\u201d he said softly. \u201cI havena been able to give ye much, ever, save a wee silver ring, and my mother\u2019s pearls.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve given me a lot more than that,\u201d I said. I wrapped my fingers around his thumb and squeezed. \u201cBrianna, for one.\u201d</p><p>He smiled faintly, looking down at the deck.</p><p>\u201cAye, that\u2019s true. She\u2019s maybe the real reason\u2014for staying, I mean.\u201d</p><p>I pulled him toward me, and he rested his head against my knee.</p><p>\u201cThis is her place, no?\u201d he said quietly. He lifted a hand, gesturing toward the river, the trees and the sky. \u201cShe will be born here, she\u2019ll live here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d I said softly. I stroked his hair, smoothing the thick strands that were so much like Brianna\u2019s. \u201cThis will be her country.\u201d Hers, in a way it could never be mine or his, no matter how long we might live here.</p><p>He nodded, beard rasping gently against my skirt.</p><p>\u201cI dinna wish to fight, or have ye ever in danger, Sassenach, but if there is a bit I can do...to build, maybe, to make it safe, and a good land for her...\u201d He shrugged. \u201cIt would please me,\u201d he finished softly.</p><p>We sat silently for a bit, close together, watching the dull shine of the water and the slow progress of the sunken lantern.</p><p>\u201cI left the pearls for her,\u201d I said at last. \u201cThat seemed right; they were an heirloom, after all.\u201d I drew my ringed hand, curved, across his lips. \u201cAnd the ring is all I need.\u201d</p><p>He took both my hands in his, then, and kissed them\u2014the left, which still bore the gold ring of my marriage to Frank, and then the right, with his own silver ring.</p><p>\u201cDa mi basia mille,\u201d he whispered, smiling. Give me a thousand kisses. It was the inscription inside my ring, a brief quotation from a love song by Catullus. I bent and gave him one back.</p><p>\u201cDein mille altera,\u201d I said. Then a thousand more.</p><p>It was near midnight when we tied up near a brushy grove to rest. The weather had changed; still hot and muggy, now the air held the hint of thunder, and the undergrowth stirred with small movements\u2014random air currents, or the scurryings of tiny night things hastening for home before the storm.</p><p>We were nearly at the end of the tidal surge; from here it would be a matter of sail and pole, and Captain Freeman had hopes of catching a good breeze on the wings of a storm. It would pay us to rest while we could. I curled into our nest on the stern, but was unable to fall asleep at once, late as it was.</p><p>By the Captain\u2019s estimation, we might make Cross Creek by evening tomorrow\u2014certainly by the day after. I was surprised to realize how eagerly I was looking forward to our arrival; two months of living hand-to-mouth on the road had given me an urgent longing for some haven, no matter how temporary.</p><p>Familiar as I was with Highland notions of hospitality and kinship, I had no fears regarding our welcome. Jamie plainly did not consider the fact that he hadn\u2019t met this particular aunt in forty-odd years to be any bar to our cordial reception, and I was quite sure he was right. At the same time, I couldn\u2019t help entertaining considerable curiosity about Jocasta Cameron.</p><p>There had been five MacKenzie siblings, the children of old Red Jacob, who had built Castle Leoch. Jamie\u2019s mother, Ellen, had been the eldest, Jocasta the youngest. Janet, the other sister, had died, like Ellen, well before I met Jamie, but I had known the two brothers, Colum and Dougal, quite well indeed, and from that knowledge, couldn\u2019t help speculating as to what this last MacKenzie of Leoch might be like.</p><p>Tall, I thought, with a glance at Jamie, curled up peacefully on the deck beside me. Tall, and maybe red-haired. They were all tall\u2014even Colum, victim of a crippling degenerative disease, had been tall to begin with\u2014fair skinned Vikings, the lot of them, with a ruddy blaze to their coloring that shimmered from Jamie\u2019s fiery red through his uncle Dougal\u2019s deep russet. Only Colum had been truly dark.</p><p>Remembering Colum and Dougal, I felt a sudden stir of unease. Colum had died before Culloden, killed by his disease. Dougal had died on the eve of the battle\u2014killed by Jamie. It had been a matter of self-defense\u2014my self, in fact\u2014and only one of so many deaths in that bloody April. Still, I did wonder whether Jamie had given any thought as to what he might say, when the greetings were past at River Run, and the casual family chat got round to \u201cOh, and when did you last see So-and-so?\u201d</p><p>Jamie sighed and stretched in his sleep. He could\u2014and did\u2014sleep well on any surface, accustomed as he had been to sleeping in conditions that ranged from wet heather to musty caves to the cold stone floors of prison cells. I supposed the wooden decking under us must be thoroughly comfortable by contrast. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I was neither so elastic nor so hardened, myself, but gradually weariness overwhelmed me, and even the prick of curiosity about the future was unable to keep me awake.</p><p>I woke to confusion. It was still dark, and there was noise all around, shouting and barking, and the deck beneath me trembled with the vibration of stamping feet. I jerked upright, half thinking myself aboard a sailing ship, convinced that we had been boarded by pirates.</p><p>Then my mind cleared, along with my foggy vision, and I discovered that we had been boarded by pirates. Strange voices shouted oaths and orders, and booted feet were heavy on the deck. Jamie was gone.</p><p>I scrabbled onto my hands and feet, taking no heed for clothes or anything else. It was near dawn; the sky was dark, but light enough that the cabin showed as a darker blotch against it. As I struggled upright, clinging to the cabin roof for support, I was nearly knocked flat by flying bodies hurling themselves across it.</p> <p>There was a confused blur of fur and white faces, a shout and a shot and a terrible thud, and Ian was crouching ashen on the deck, over Rollo\u2019s heaving form. A strange man, hatless and disheveled, pushed himself to his feet.</p><p>\u201cDamn! He nearly got me!\u201d Unhinged by the near miss, the robber\u2019s hand trembled as he fumbled with the spare pistol at his belt. He pointed it at the dog, face drawing down in an ugly squint.</p><p>\u201cTake that, arse-bite!\u201d</p><p>A taller man appeared from nowhere, his hand knocking down the pistol before the flint could strike.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t waste the shot, fool.\u201d He gestured to Troklus and Captain Freeman\u2014the latter volubly incensed\u2014being herded toward me. \u201cHow d\u2019you mean to hold them with an empty gun?\u201d</p> <p>The shorter man cast an evil look at Rollo, but swung his pistol to bear on Freeman\u2019s midriff instead.</p><p>Rollo was making an odd noise, a low growling mixed with whimpers of pain, and I could see a wet, dark stain on the boards under his twitching body. Ian bent low over him, hands stroking his head helplessly. He looked up, and tears shone wet on his cheeks.</p><p>\u201cHelp me, Auntie,\u201d he said. \u201cPlease help!\u201d</p><p>I moved impulsively, and the tall man stepped forward, thrusting out an arm to stop me.</p><p>\u201cI want to help the dog,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d said the short robber, in tones of outrage.</p> <p>The tall man was masked\u2014they all were, I realized, my eyes adjusting to the growing half-light. How many were there? It was impossible to tell under the mask, but I had the distinct impression that the tall man was smiling. He didn\u2019t answer, but gave a short jerk of his pistol, giving me leave.</p><p>\u201cHullo, old boy,\u201d I said under my breath, dropping to my knees next to the dog. \u201cDon\u2019t bite, there\u2019s a good doggie. Where is he hurt, Ian, do you know?\u201d</p><p>Ian shook his head, sniffing back the tears.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s under him; I can\u2019t get him to turn over.\u201d</p><p>I wasn\u2019t about to try to heave the dog\u2019s huge carcass over either. I felt quickly for a pulse in the neck, but my fingers sank into Rollo\u2019s thick ruff, prodding uselessly. Seized by inspiration, I instead picked up a front leg and felt up its length, getting my fingers into the hollow where the leg met the body.</p><p>Sure enough, there it was; a steady pulse, throbbing reassuringly under my fingers. I began by habit to count, but quickly abandoned the effort, as I had no idea what a dog\u2019s normal pulse rate should be. It was steady, though; no fluttering, no arrhythmia, no weakness. That was a very good sign.</p><p>Another was that Rollo hadn\u2019t lost consciousness; the great leg I held tucked under my elbow had the tension of coiled spring, not the limp dangle of shock. The dog made a long, high-pitched noise, halfway between a whine and a howl, and began to scrabble with his claws, pulling his leg out of my grasp in an effort to right himself.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s very bad, Ian,\u201d I said in relief. \u201cLook, he\u2019s turning over.\u201d</p> <p>Rollo stood up, swaying. He shook his head violently, shaggy coat twitching from head to tail, and a shower of blood drops flew over the deck with a sound like pattering rain. The big yellow eyes fixed on the short man with a look that was clear to the meanest intelligence.</p><p>\u201cHere! You stop him, or I swear I\u2019ll shoot him dead!\u201d Panic and sincerity rang out in the robber\u2019s voice, as the muzzle of the pistol drifted uncertainly between the little group of prisoners and Rollo\u2019s lip-curled snarl.</p><p>Ian, who had been frantically undoing his shirt, whipped the garment off and over Rollo\u2019s head, temporarily blinding the dog, who shook his head madly, making growling noises inside the restraint. Blood stained the yellow linen\u2014I could see now, though, that it came from a shallow gash in the dog\u2019s shoulder; evidently, the bullet had only grazed him.</p><p>Ian hung on grimly, forcing Rollo back on his haunches, muttering orders to the dog\u2019s swaddled head.</p><p>\u201cHow many aboard?\u201d The taller man\u2019s sharp eyes flicked toward Captain Freeman, whose mouth was pressed so tightly together, it looked no more than a purse seam in the gray fur of his face, then toward me.</p><p>I knew him; knew the voice. The knowledge must have shown in my face, for he paused for a moment, then jerked his head and let the masking kerchief fall from his face.</p><p>\u201cHow many?\u201d Stephen Bonnet asked again.</p><p>\u201cSix,\u201d I said. There was no reason not to answer; I could see Fergus on the shore, hands raised as a third pirate herded him at gunpoint toward the boat; Jamie had materialized out of the darkness beside me, looking grim.</p><p>\u201cMr. Fraser,\u201d Bonnet said pleasantly, at sight of him. \u201cA pleasure to be renewing our acquaintance. But did ye not have another companion, sir? The one-armed gentleman?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot here,\u201d Jamie replied shortly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have a look,\u201d the short robber muttered, turning, but Bonnet stopped him with a gesture.</p><p>\u201cAh, now, and would ye be doubting the word of a gentleman like Mr. Fraser? No, you\u2019ll be after guarding these fine folk here, Roberts; I\u2019ll be having the look around.\u201d With a nod to his companion, he vanished.</p><p>Looking after Rollo had distracted me momentarily from the commotion going on elsewhere on the boat. Sounds of breakage came from inside the cabin, and I leapt to my feet, reminded of my medicine box.</p><p>\u201cHere! Where you going? Stop! I\u2019ll shoot!\u201d The robber\u2019s voice held a desperate note, but an uncertain one, as well. I didn\u2019t stop to look at him, but dived into the cabin, cannoning into a fourth robber, who was indeed rummaging through my medicine chest.</p><p>I staggered back from the collision, then clutched his arm, with a cry of outrage. He had been carelessly opening boxes and bottles, shaking out the contents, and tossing them on the floor; a litter of bottles, many of them broken, lay amid the scattered remnants of Dr. Rawlings\u2019s selection of medicines.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you dare touch those!\u201d I said, and snatching the nearest vial from the chest, I popped out the cork and flung the contents in his face.</p><p>Like most of Rawlings\u2019s mixtures, it contained a high proportion of alcohol. He gasped as the liquid hit, and reeled backward, eyes streaming.</p><p>I pressed my advantage by seizing a stone ale bottle from the wreckage and hitting him on the head with it. It hit with a satisfying thunk! but I hadn\u2019t hit him quite hard enough; he staggered but stayed upright, lurching as he grabbed at me.</p><p>I drew back my arm for another swing, but my wrist was seized from behind by a grip like iron.</p><p>\u201cBeggin\u2019 your pardon, Mrs. Fraser dear,\u201d said a polite, familiar Irish voice. \u201cBut I really cannot allow ye to crack his head. It\u2019s not very ornamental, sure, but he needs it to hold up his hat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrigging bitch! She hit me!\u201d The man I had hit was clutching his head, his features screwed up in pain.</p><p>Bonnet hauled me out onto the deck, my arm twisted painfully behind my back. It was nearly light by now; the river glowed like flat silver. I stared hard at our assailants; I meant to know them again, if I saw them, masks or no masks.</p><p>Unfortunately, the improved light allowed the robbers better vision as well. The man I had hit, who seemed to be bearing a distinct grudge, seized my hand and wrenched at my ring.</p><p>\u201cHere, let\u2019s have that!\u201d</p><p>I yanked my hand away and made to slap him, but was stopped by a meaningful cough from Bonnet, who had stepped close to Ian and was holding his pistol an inch from the boy\u2019s left ear.</p><p>\u201cBest hand them over, Mrs. Fraser,\u201d he said politely. \u201cI fear Mr. Roberts requires some compensation for the damage ye\u2019ve caused him.\u201d</p><p>I twisted my gold ring off, hands trembling both with fear and rage. The silver one was harder; it stuck on my knuckle as though reluctant to part from me. Both rings were damp and slippery with sweat, the metal warmer than my suddenly chilled fingers.</p><p>\u201cGive \u2019em up.\u201d The man poked me roughly in the shoulder, then turned up a broad, grubby palm for the rings. I reached toward him, reluctantly, rings cupped in my hand\u2014and then, with an impulse I didn\u2019t stop to examine, clapped my hand to my mouth instead.</p><p>My head hit the cabin wall with a thud as the man knocked me backward. His callused fingers jabbed my cheeks and poked into my mouth, probing roughly in search of the rings. I twisted and gulped hard, mouth filling with saliva and a silver taste that might have been either metal or blood.</p><p>I bit down and he jerked back with a cry; one ring must have flown out of my mouth, for I heard a faint, metallic ping somewhere, and then I gagged and choked, the second ring sliding into my gullet, hard and round.</p><p>\u201cBitch! I\u2019ll slit your friggin\u2019 throat! You\u2019ll go to hell without your rings, you cheating whore!\u201d I saw the man\u2019s face, contorted in rage, and the sudden glitter of a knife blade drawn. Then something hit me hard and knocked me over, and I found myself crushed to the deck, flattened under Jamie\u2019s body.</p><p>I was too stunned to move, though I couldn\u2019t have moved in any case; Jamie\u2019s chest was pressing on the back of my head, squashing my face into the deck. There was a lot of shouting and confusion, muffled by the folds of damp linen around my head. There was a soft thunk! and I felt Jamie jerk and grunt.</p><p>Oh, God, they\u2019ve stabbed him! I thought, in an agony of terror. Another thump and a louder grunt, though, indicated only a kick in the ribs. Jamie didn\u2019t move; just pressed himself harder against the deck, flattening me like the filling of a sandwich.</p><p>\u201cLeave off! Roberts! I said leave him!\u201d Bonnet\u2019s voice rang out in tones of authority, sharp enough to penetrate the muffling cloth.</p><p>\u201cBut she\u2014\u201d Roberts began, but his querulous whine was stopped abruptly with a sharp, meaty smack.</p><p>\u201cRaise yourself, Mr. Fraser. Your wife is safe\u2014not that she deserves to be.\u201d Bonnet\u2019s husky baritone held mingled tones of amusement and irritation.</p><p>Jamie\u2019s weight lifted slowly off me, and I sat up, feeling dizzy and mildly sick from the blow on the head. Stephen Bonnet stood looking down at me, examining me with faint distaste, as though I were a mangy deerhide he\u2019d been offered for sale. Next to him, Roberts glared malevolently, dabbing at a smear of blood at his hairline.</p><p>Bonnet blinked finally, and switched his gaze to Jamie, who had regained his feet. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cA foolish woman,\u201d Bonnet said dispassionately, \u201cbut I suppose you don\u2019t mind that.\u201d He nodded, a faint smile showing. \u201cI am obliged for the opportunity to repay my debt to ye, sir. A life for a life, as the Good Book says.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRepay us?\u201d Ian said angrily. \u201cAfter what we\u2019ve done for ye, ye\u2019ll rob and spoil us, lay violent hands upon my aunt and my dog, and then ye\u2019ll ha\u2019 the gall to speak of repayment?\u201d</p><p>Bonnet\u2019s pale eyes fixed on Ian\u2019s face; they were green, the color of peeled grapes. He had a deep dimple in one cheek, as though God had pressed a thumb there in his making, but the eyes were cold as river water at dawn.</p><p>\u201cWhy, were ye never after learning your Scripture, lad?\u201d Bonnet shook his head reprovingly, with a click of the tongue. \u201cA virtuous woman is prized above rubies; her price is greater than pearls.\u201d</p> <p>He opened his hand, still smiling, and the lantern light glittered off three gems: emerald, sapphire, and the dark fire of a black diamond.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure Mr. Fraser would agree, would ye not, sir?\u201d He slipped the hand into his coat, then brought it out empty.</p><p>\u201cAnd after all,\u201d he said, cold eyes swiveling once more toward Ian, \u201cthere are repayments of different kinds.\u201d He smiled, not very pleasantly. \u201cThough I should not suppose you can be old enough to know that yet. Be glad I\u2019ve no mind to give ye a lesson.\u201d</p><p>He turned away, beckoning to his comrades.</p><p>\u201cWe have what we came for,\u201d he said abruptly. \u201cCome.\u201d He stepped up onto the rail and jumped, landing with a grunt on the muddy riverbank. His henchmen followed, Roberts casting an evil look at me before splashing awkwardly into the shallows and ashore.</p> <p>The four men disappeared at once into the brush, and I heard the high-pitched greeting whinny of a horse, somewhere in the darkness. Aboard, all was silence.</p><p>The sky was the color of charcoal, and thunder grumbled faintly in the distance, sheet lightning flickering just above the far horizon.</p><p>\u201cBastards.\u201d</p><p>Captain Freeman spat in valediction over the side, and turned to his mate.</p><p>\u201cFetch the poles, you, Troklus,\u201d he said, and shambled toward the tiller, hitching his breeks upward as he went.</p><p>Slowly, the others stirred and came to life. Fergus, with a glance at Jamie, lit the lantern and then disappeared into the cabin, where I heard him beginning to set things to rights. Ian sat huddled on the deck, his dark head bent over Rollo as he dabbed at the dog\u2019s neck with his wadded shirt.</p> <p>I didn\u2019t want to look at Jamie. I rolled onto my hands and knees and crawled slowly over to Young Ian. Rollo watched me, yellow eyes wary, but made no objection to my presence.</p><p>\u201cHow is he?\u201d I said, rather hoarsely. I could feel the ring in my throat, an uncomfortable obstruction, and swallowed heavily several times.</p><p>Young Ian looked up at once; his face was white and set, but his eyes were alert.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s all right, I think,\u201d he said softly. \u201cAuntie\u2014are ye all right? Ye\u2019re no hurt, are ye?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I said, and tried to smile reassuringly. \u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d There was a sore spot on the back of my skull and my ears still rang slightly; the yellow halo of light around the lantern seemed to oscillate, to swell and shrink in rhythm with the beating of my heart. One cheek was scraped, I had a bruised elbow and a large splinter in one hand, but I seemed to be fundamentally sound, physically. Otherwise, I had my doubts.</p><p>I didn\u2019t look around at Jamie, some six feet behind me, but I could feel his presence, ominous as a thundercloud. Ian, who plainly could see him over my shoulder, looked faintly apprehensive.</p><p>There was a slight creaking of the deck, and Ian\u2019s expression eased. I heard Jamie\u2019s voice inside the cabin, outwardly casual as he asked Fergus a question, then it faded, lost in the sounds of bumping and shuffling as the men righted furniture and repiled the scattered goods. I let my breath out slowly.</p><p>\u201cDinna fash, Auntie,\u201d Ian said, in an attempt at comfort. \u201cUncle Jamie\u2019s no the sort to lay hands on ye, I dinna think.\u201d</p> <p>I wasn\u2019t at all sure of that, given the vibrations coming from Jamie\u2019s direction, but I hoped he was right.</p><p>\u201cIs he terribly angry, do you think?\u201d I asked in a low voice.</p><p>Ian shrugged uneasily.</p><p>\u201cWell, last time I saw him look at me that way, he took me back o\u2019 the house and knocked me flat. He wouldna serve you that way, though, I\u2019m sure,\u201d he added hastily.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t suppose so,\u201d I said, a little bleakly. I wasn\u2019t sure I wouldn\u2019t prefer it if he did.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s no verra nice to get the rough side o\u2019 Uncle Jamie\u2019s tongue, either,\u201d Ian said, shaking his head sympathetically. \u201cI\u2019d rather a thrashing, myself.\u201d</p><p>I gave Ian a quelling look and leaned over the dog.</p><p>\u201cSufficient to the day is the evil thereof. Has the bleeding stopped?\u201d</p><p>It had; disregarding the blood-matted fur, there was surprisingly little damage; no more than a deep nick in the skin and muscle near the shoulder. Rollo flattened his ears and showed his teeth as I examined him, but made no audible protest.</p><p>\u201cGood dog,\u201d I murmured. Had I any way to numb the skin, I would have stitched the wound, but we would have to do without such niceties. \u201cHe should have a little ointment there, to keep the flies out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get it, Auntie; I ken where your wee box is.\u201d Ian gently edged Rollo\u2019s nose off his knee and got to his feet. \u201cIt\u2019ll be the green stuff ye put on Fergus\u2019s toe?\u201d At my nod, he disappeared into the cabin, leaving me to deal with my quivering stomach, sore head, and congested throat. I swallowed several times, but with no great result. I touched my throat gingerly, wondering which ring I still had.</p><p>Eutroclus came round the corner of the cabin, carrying a long thick pole of white wood, deeply stained at one end, the marks testifying to the frequent necessity of its use. Stabbing the pole firmly down off the side, he leaned his weight against it, heaving with a long, sustained effort.</p><p>I jumped, as Jamie came out of the shadows, a similar pole in his hand. I hadn\u2019t heard him, above the miscellaneous thumpings and shouts. He didn\u2019t look at me, but shed his shirt, and at the deckhand\u2019s indication, stabbed down his pole.</p><p>On the fourth try, I felt the vibration of the hull, a small judder as something shifted. Encouraged, Jamie and the hand shoved harder, and all of sudden, the hull slid free, with a muted bwong! of resonant wood that made Rollo lift his head with a startled Wuff!</p><p>Eutroclus nodded to Jamie, face beaming under a shiny layer of sweat, and took the pole from him. Jamie nodded back, smiling, and picking up his shirt from the deck, turned toward me.</p><p>I stiffened, and Rollo twitched his ears to full alert, but Jamie showed no immediate disposition either to berate me or to toss me overboard. Instead, he leaned down, frowning as he peered at me in the wavering lantern light.</p><p>\u201cHow d\u2019ye feel, Sassenach? I canna tell if you\u2019re really green, or is it only the light.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m all right. A bit shaky, perhaps.\u201d More than a bit; my hands were still clammy, and I knew my trembling knees wouldn\u2019t hold me if I tried to stand. I swallowed hard, coughed, and thumped myself on the chest.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s probably my imagination, but it feels like the ring is caught in my throat.\u201d</p><p>He squinted thoughtfully at me, then turned to Fergus, who had appeared from the cabin and was hovering nearby.</p><p>\u201cAsk the captain might I see his pipe for a moment, Fergus.\u201d He turned away, pulling his shirt over his head, and disappeared aft himself, returning moments later with a cup of water.</p><p>I reached gratefully for it, but he held it out of my reach.</p><p>\u201cNot just yet, Sassenach,\u201d he said. \u201cGot it? Aye, thanks, Fergus. Fetch an empty bucket, now, will ye?\u201d Taking the filthy pipe from a puzzled Fergus, he inserted his thumb into the stained bowl and began to scrape at the burnt, gummy residue that lined it.</p><p>Turning the pipe upside down, he tapped it over the cup of water, causing a small shower of brown crusts and moist crumbs of half-burnt tobacco, which he stirred into the water with his blackened thumb. Finished with these preparations, he looked up at me over the rim of the cup in a distinctly sinister fashion.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I said. \u201cOh, no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes,\u201d he said. \u201cCome along, Sassenach; it\u2019ll cure what ails ye.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll just...wait,\u201d I said. I folded my arms across my chest. \u201cThanks anyway.\u201d</p><p>Fergus had by this time reappeared with the bucket, eyebrows raised high. Jamie took it from him and plunked it on the deck next to me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve done it that way, Sassenach,\u201d he informed me, \u201cand it\u2019s a good deal messier than ye might think. It\u2019s also not a pleasant thing to do on a boat, in close company, aye?\u201d He put a hand on the back of my head and pressed the cup against my lower lip. \u201cThis will be quick. Come on, now; a wee sip is all.\u201d</p><p>I pressed my lips tightly together; the smell from the cup was enough to make my stomach turn over, combining as it did the stale reek of tobacco, the sight of the noisome brown surface of the liquid, crusts swimming below the surface, and the memory of Captain Freeman\u2019s blobs of brown-tinged spittle sliding down the deck.</p><p>Jamie didn\u2019t bother with argument or persuasion. He simply let go of my head, pinched my nose shut, and when I opened my mouth to breathe, tipped in the foul-smelling contents of the cup.</p><p>\u201cMmmfff!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSwallow,\u201d he said, clapping a hand tightly across my mouth and ignoring both my frenzied squirming and the muffled sounds of protest I was making. He was a lot stronger than I was, and he didn\u2019t mean to let go. It was swallow or strangle.</p><p>I swallowed.</p><p>\u201cGood as new.\u201d Jamie finished polishing the silver ring on his shirttail and held it up, admiring it in the glow of the lantern.</p><p>\u201cThat is somewhat better than can be said of me,\u201d I replied coldly. I lay in a crumpled heap on the deck, which in spite of the placid current, seemed still to be heaving very slightly under me. \u201cYou are a grade-A, double-dyed, sadistic f**king bastard, Jamie Fraser!\u201d</p><p>He bent over me and smoothed the damp hair off my face.</p><p>\u201cI expect so. If ye feel well enough to call me names, Sassenach, you\u2019ll do. Rest a bit, aye?\u201d He kissed me gently on the forehead and sat back.</p><p>Excitement over and order restored to the ravaged decks, the other men had gone back to the cabin to restore themselves with the aid of a bottle of applejack that Captain Freeman had contrived to save from the pirates by dropping it into the water barrel. A small cup of this beverage rested on the deck near my head; I was still too queasy to countenance swallowing anything, but the warm, fruity smell was mildly comforting.</p><p>We were under sail; everyone was eager to get away, as though some danger still lingered over the place of the attack. We were moving faster, now; the usual small cloud of insects that hovered near the lanterns had dispersed, reduced to no more than a few lacewings resting on the beam above, their delicate green bodies casting tiny streaks of shadow. Inside the cabin, there was a small burst of laughter, and an answering growl from Rollo on the side deck\u2014things were returning to normal. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>A small, welcome breeze played across the deck, evaporating the clammy sweat on my face and lifting the ends of Jamie\u2019s hair, drifting them across his face. I could see the small vertical line between his brows and the tilt of his head that indicated deep thought.</p><p>Little wonder if he was thinking. In one stroke, we had gone from riches\u2014potential riches, at least\u2014to rags, our well-equipped expedition reduced to a sack of beans and a used medicine chest. So much for his desire not to appear as beggars at Jocasta Cameron\u2019s door\u2014we were little more than that now.</p><p>My throat ached for him, pity replacing irritation. Beyond the question of his immediate pride, there was now a terrifying void in that unknown territory marked \u201cThe Future.\u201d The future had been well open to question before, but the sharp edges of all such questions had been buffered by the comforting knowledge that we would have money to help accomplish our aims\u2014whatever those turned out to be.</p><p>Even our penurious trip north had felt like an adventure, with the certain knowledge that we possessed a fortune, whether it was spendable or not. I had never before considered myself a person who placed much value on money, but having the certainty of security ripped away in this violent fashion had given me a sudden and quite unexpected attack of vertigo, as though I were falling down a long, dark well, powerless to stop.</p> <p>What had it done to Jamie, who felt not only his danger and mine but the crushing responsibility of so many other lives? Ian, Fergus, Marsali, Duncan, the inhabitants of Lallybroch\u2014even that bloody nuisance Laoghaire. I wasn\u2019t sure whether to laugh or cry, thinking of the money Jamie had sent her; the vengeful creature was a good deal better off at present than we were.</p><p>At the thought of vengeance, I felt a new stab that displaced all lesser fears. While Jamie was not markedly vengeful\u2014for a Scot\u2014no Highlander would suffer a loss such as this with silent resignation; a loss not only of fortune but of honor. What might he feel compelled to do about it?</p><p>Jamie stared fixedly into the dark water, his mouth set; was he seeing once again the graveyard where, swayed by Duncan\u2019s intoxicated sentimentality, he had agreed to help Bonnet escape?</p><p>It belatedly occurred to me that the financial aspects of the disaster likely had not yet entered Jamie\u2019s mind\u2014he was occupied in more bitter reflection; it was he who had helped Bonnet escape the hangman\u2019s rope, and set him free to prey on the innocent. How many besides us would suffer because of that?</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not to blame,\u201d I said, touching his knee.</p> <p>\u201cWho else?\u201d he said quietly, not looking at me. \u201cI kent the man for what he was. I could have left him to the fate he\u2019d earned\u2014but I did not. I was a fool.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were kind. It\u2019s not the same thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNear enough.\u201d</p><p>He breathed in deeply; the air was freshening with the scent of ozone; the rain was near. He reached for the cup of applejack and drank, then looked at me for the first time, holding up the cup inquiringly.</p><p>\u201cYes, thanks.\u201d I struggled to sit up, but Jamie took me by the shoulders and lifted me to lean against him. He held the cup for me to drink, the blood-warm liquid sliding soft across my tongue, then taking fire as it slid down my throat, burning away the traces of sickness and tobacco, leaving in their place rum\u2019s lingering taste of burning sugarcane.</p><p>\u201cBetter?\u201d</p> <p>I nodded, and held up my right hand. He slid the ring onto my finger, the metal warm from his hand. Then, folding down my fingers, he squeezed my fist hard in his own and held it, tight.</p><p>\u201cHad he been following us since Charleston?\u201d I wondered aloud.</p><p>Jamie shook his head. His hair was still loose, heavy waves falling forward to hide his face.</p><p>\u201cI dinna think so. If he\u2019d kent we had the jewels, he would have set upon us on the road before we reached Wilmington. No, I expect he learned it from one of Lillington\u2019s servants. I thought we\u2019d be safe enough, for we\u2019d be away to Cross Creek before anyone heard of the gems. Someone talked, though\u2014a footman; perhaps the sempstress who sewed your gown.\u201d</p><p>His face was outwardly calm, but it always was, when he was hiding strong emotions. A sudden gust of hot wind shot sideways across the deck; the rain was getting closer. It whipped the loose ends of his hair across his cheek, and he wiped them back, running his fingers through the thick mass.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry for your other ring,\u201d he said, after a moment.</p><p>\u201cOh. It\u2019s\u2014\u201d I started to say \u201cIt\u2019s all right,\u201d but the words stuck in my throat, choked by the sudden realization of loss.</p><p>I had worn that gold ring for nearly thirty years; token of vows taken, forsaken, renewed, and at last absolved. A token of marriage, of family; of a large part of my life. And the last trace of Frank\u2014whom, in spite of everything, I had loved.</p> <p>Jamie didn\u2019t say anything, but he took my left hand in his own and held it, lightly stroking my knuckles with his thumb. I didn\u2019t speak either. I sighed deeply and turned my face toward the stern; the trees along the shore were shivering in a rising wind of anticipation, leaves rustling loudly enough to drown the sound of the vessel\u2019s passage.</p><p>A small drop struck my cheek, but I didn\u2019t move. My hand lay limp and white in his, looking unaccustomedly frail; it was something of a shock to see it that way.</p><p>I was used to paying a great deal of attention to my hands, one way and another. They were my tools, my channel of touch, mingling the delicacy and strength by which I healed. They had a certain beauty, which I admired in a detached sort of way, but it was the beauty of strength and competence, the assurance of power that made its form admirable.</p><p>It was the same hand now, pale and long-fingered, the knuckles slightly bony\u2014oddly bare without my ring, but recognizably my hand. Yet it lay in a hand so much larger and rougher that it seemed small, and fragile by comparison.</p><p>His other hand squeezed tighter, pressing the metal of the silver ring into my flesh, reminding me of what remained. I lifted his fist and pressed it hard against my heart in answer. The rain began to fall, in large, wet drops, but neither of us moved.</p><p>It came in a rush, dropping a veil over boat and shore, pattering noisily on leaves and deck and water, lending a temporary illusion of concealment. It washed cool and soft across my skin, momentary balm on the wounds of fear and loss.</p><p>I felt at once horribly vulnerable and yet completely safe. But then\u2014I had always felt that way with Jamie Fraser.</p><p>PART FOUR</p><p>River Run</p><p>10</p><p>JOCASTA</p><p>Cross Creek, North Carolina, June 1767</p><p>River Run stood by the edge of the Cape Fear, just above the confluence that gave Cross Creek its name. Cross Creek itself was good-sized, with a busy public wharf and several large warehouses lining the water\u2019s edge. As the Sally Ann made her way slowly through the shipping lane, a strong, resinous smell hung over town and river, trapped by the hot, sticky air.</p><p>\u201cJesus, it\u2019s like breathin\u2019 turpentine,\u201d Ian wheezed as a fresh wave of the stultifying reek washed over us.</p><p>\u201cYou is breathin\u2019 turpentine, man.\u201d Eutroclus\u2019s rare smile flashed white and disappeared. He nodded toward a barge tethered to a piling by one of the wharfs. It was stacked with barrels, some of which showed a thick black ooze through split seams. Other, larger barrels bore the brandmarks of their owners, with a large \u201cT\u201d burned into the pinewood below.</p><p>\u201c \u2019At\u2019s right,\u201d Captain Freeman agreed. He squinted in the bright sunlight, waving one hand slowly in front of his nose, as though this might dispel the stink. \u201cThis time o\u2019 year\u2019s when the pitch-bilers come down from the backcountry. Pitch, turpentine, tar\u2014bring it all down by barge t\u2019 Wilmington, then send it on south to the shipyards at Charleston.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI shouldna think it\u2019s all turpentine,\u201d Jamie said. He mopped the back of his neck with a handkerchief and nodded toward the largest of the ware-houses, its door flanked by red-coated soldiers. \u201cSmell it, Sassenach?\u201d</p><p>I inhaled, cautiously. There was something else in the air here; a hot, familiar scent.</p><p>\u201cRum?\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cAnd brandywine. And a bit of port, as well.\u201d Jamie\u2019s long nose twitched, sensitive as a mongoose\u2019s. I looked at him in amusement.</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t lost it, have you?\u201d Twenty years before, he had managed his cousin Jared\u2019s wine business in Paris, and his nose and palate had been the awe of the winery tasting rooms.</p><p>He grinned.</p><p>\u201cOh, I expect I could still tell Moselle from horse piss, if ye held it right under my nose. But telling rum from turpentine is no great feat, is it?\u201d</p><p>Ian drew a huge lungful of air and let it out, coughing.</p><p>\u201cIt all smells the same to me,\u201d he said, shaking his head.</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d said Jamie, \u201cI\u2019ll give ye turpentine next time I stand ye a drink. It\u2019ll be a good deal cheaper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTurpentine\u2019s just about what I could afford now,\u201d he added under cover of the laughter this remark caused. He straightened, brushing down the skirts of his coat. \u201cWe\u2019ll be there soon. Do I look a terrible beggar, Sassenach?\u201d</p><p>Seen with the sun glowing on his neatly ribboned hair, his darkened profile coin-stamped against the light, I privately thought he looked dazzling, but I had caught the faint tone of anxiety in his voice, and knew well enough what he meant. Penniless he might be, but he didn\u2019t mean to look it.</p><p>I was well aware that the notion of appearing at his aunt\u2019s door as a poor relation come a-begging stung his pride considerably. The fact that he had been forced into precisely that role didn\u2019t make it any easier to bear.</p><p>I looked him over carefully. The coat and waistcoat were not spectacular, but quite acceptable, courtesy of Cousin Edwin; a quiet gray broadcloth with a good hand and an excellent fit, buttons not silver, but not of wood or bone either\u2014a sober pewter, like a prosperous Quaker.</p><p>Not that the rest of him bore the slightest resemblance to a Quaker, I thought. The linen shirt was rather grubby, but as long as he kept his coat on, no one would notice, and the missing button on the waistcoat was hidden by the graceful fall of his lace jabot, the sole extravagance he had permitted himself in the way of wardrobe.</p><p>The stockings were all right; pale blue silk, no visible holes. The white linen breeches were tight, but not\u2014not quite\u2014indecent, and reasonably clean.</p><p>The shoes were the only real flaw in his ensemble; there had been no time to have any made. His were sound, and I had done my best to hide the scuff-marks with a mixture of soot and dripping, but they were clearly a farmer\u2019s footwear, not a gentleman\u2019s; thick-soled, made of rough leather, and with buckles of lowly horn. Still, I doubted that his aunt Jocasta would be looking at his feet first thing.</p><p>I stood on tiptoe to straighten his jabot, and brushed a floating down-feather off his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cIt will be all right,\u201d I whispered back, smiling up at him. \u201cYou\u2019re beautiful.\u201d</p><p>He looked startled; then the expression of grim aloofness relaxed into a smile.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re beautiful, Sassenach.\u201d He leaned over and kissed me on the forehead. \u201cYou\u2019re flushed as a wee apple; verra bonny.\u201d He straightened up, glanced at Ian, and sighed. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAs for Ian, perhaps I can pass him off as a bondsman I\u2019ve taken on to be swineherd.\u201d</p><p>Ian was one of those people whose clothes, no matter what their original quality, immediately look as though they had been salvaged from a rubbish tip. Half his hair had escaped from its green ribbon, and one bony elbow protruded from a rip in his new shirt, whose cuffs were already noticeably gray round the wrists.</p><p>\u201cCaptain Freeman says we\u2019ll be there in no time!\u201d he exclaimed, eyes shining with excitement as he leaned over the side, peering upriver in order to be first to sight our destination. \u201cWhat d\u2019ye think we\u2019ll get for supper?\u201d</p><p>Jamie surveyed his nephew with a marked lack of favor.</p> <p>\u201cI expect you\u2019ll get table scraps, wi\u2019 the dogs. Do ye not own a coat, Ian? Or a comb?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, aye,\u201d Ian said, glancing round vaguely, as though expecting one of these objects to materialize in front of him. \u201cI\u2019ve a coat here. Somewhere. I think.\u201d</p><p>The coat was finally located under one of the benches, and extracted with some difficulty from the possession of Rollo, who had made a comfortable bed of it. After a quick brush to remove at least some of the dog hairs from the garment, Ian was forcibly inserted into it, and sat firmly down to have his hair combed and plaited while Jamie gave him a quick refresher course in manners, this consisting solely of the advice to keep his mouth shut as much as possible.</p><p>Ian nodded amiably.</p><p>\u201cWill ye tell Great-auntie Jocasta about the pirates yourself, then?\u201d he inquired.</p> <p>Jamie glanced briefly at Captain Freeman\u2019s scrawny back. It was futile to expect that such a story would not be told in every tavern in Cross Creek, as soon as they had left us. It would be a matter of days\u2014hours perhaps\u2014before it spread to River Run plantation.</p><p>\u201cAye, I\u2019ll tell her,\u201d he said. \u201cBut not just on the instant, Ian. Let her get accustomed to us, first.\u201d</p><p>The mooring for River Run was some distance above Cross Creek, separated from the noise and reek of the town by several miles of tranquil tree-thick river. Having seen Jamie, Ian, and Fergus all rendered as handsome as water, comb, and ribbons could make them, I retired to the cabin, changed out of my grubby muslin, sponged myself hastily, and slipped into the cream silk I had worn to dinner with the Governor.</p><p>The soft fabric was light and cool against my skin. Perhaps a bit more formal than was usual for afternoon, but it was important to Jamie that we must look decent\u2014especially now, after our encounter with the pirates\u2014and my only alternatives were the filthy muslin or a clean but threadbare camlet gown that had traveled with me from Georgia.</p><p>There wasn\u2019t a great deal to be done with my hair; I gave it a cursory stab with a comb, then tied it back off my neck, letting the ends curl up as they would. I needn\u2019t trouble about jewelry, I thought ruefully, and rubbed my silver wedding ring to make it shine. I still avoided looking at my left hand, so nak*dly bare; if I didn\u2019t look, I could still feel the imaginary weight of the gold upon it.</p><p>By the time I emerged from the cabin, the mooring was in sight. By contrast to the rickety fittings of most plantation moorings we had passed, River Run boasted a substantial and well-built wooden dock. A small black boy was sitting on the end of it, swinging bare legs in boredom. When he saw the Sally Ann\u2019s approach, he leapt to his feet and tore off, presumably to announce our arrival.</p> <p>Our homely craft bumped to a stop against the dock. From the screen of trees near the river, a brick walk swept up through a broad array of formal lawns and gardens, splitting in two to circle paired marble statues that stood in their own beds of flowers, then joining again and fanning out in a broad piazza in front of an imposing two-storied house, colonnaded and multichimneyed. At one side of the flower beds stood a miniature building, made of white marble\u2014a mausoleum of some kind, I thought. I revised my opinions as to the suitability of the cream silk dress, and touched nervously at my hair.</p><p>I found her at once, among the people hurrying out of the house and down the walk. I would have known her for a MacKenzie, even if I hadn\u2019t known who she was. She had the bold bones, the broad Viking cheekbones and high, smooth brow of her brothers, Colum and Dougal. And like her nephew, like her great-niece, she had the extraordinary height that marked them all as descendants of one blood.</p><p>A head higher than the bevy of black servants who surrounded her, she floated down the path from the house, hand on the arm of her butler, though a woman less in need of support I had seldom seen.</p><p>She was tall and she was quick, with a firm step at odds with the white of her hair. She might once have been as red as Jamie; her hair still held a tinge of ruddiness, having gone that rich soft white that redheads do, with the buttery patina of an old gold spoon.</p><p>There was a cry from one of the little boys in the vanguard, and two of them broke loose, galloping down the path toward the mooring, where they circled us, yapping like puppies. At first I couldn\u2019t make out a word\u2014it was only as Ian replied jocularly to them that I realized they were shouting in Gaelic.</p><p>I didn\u2019t know whether Jamie had thought what to say or to do upon this first meeting, but in the event, he simply stepped forward, went up to Jocasta MacKenzie, and embraced her, saying, \u201cAunt\u2014it\u2019s Jamie.\u201d</p><p>It was only as he released her and stepped back that I saw his face, with an expression I had never seen before; something between eagerness, joy, and awe. It occurred to me, with a small jolt of shock, that Jocasta MacKenzie must look very much like her elder sister\u2014Jamie\u2019s mother.</p><p>I thought she might have his deep blue eyes, though I couldn\u2019t tell; they were blurred as she laughed through her tears, holding him by the sleeve, reaching up to touch his cheek, to smooth nonexistent strands of hair from his face.</p> <p>\u201cJamie!\u201d she said, over and over. \u201cJamie, wee Jamie! Oh, I\u2019m glad ye\u2019ve come, lad!\u201d She reached up once more, and touched his hair, a look of amazement on her face.</p><p>\u201cBlessed Bride, but he\u2019s a giant! You\u2019ll be as tall as my brother Dougal was, at least!\u201d</p><p>The expression of happiness on his face faded slightly at that, but he kept his smile, turning her with him so she faced me.</p><p>\u201cAuntie, may I present my wife? This is Claire.\u201d</p><p>She put out a hand at once, beaming, and I took it between my own, feeling a small pang of recognition at the long, strong fingers; though her knuckles were slightly knobbed with age, her skin was soft and the feel of her grip was unnervingly like Brianna\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cI am so glad to meet ye, my dear,\u201d she said, and drew me close to kiss my cheek. The scent of mint and verbena wafted strongly from her dress, and I felt oddly moved, as though I had suddenly come under the protection of some beneficent deity.</p><p>\u201cSo beautiful!\u201d she said admiringly, long fingers stroking the sleeve of my dress.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d I said, but Ian and Fergus were coming up to be introduced in their turn. She greeted them both with embraces and endearments, laughing as Fergus kissed her hand in his best French manner.</p><p>\u201cCome,\u201d she said, breaking away at last, and wiping at her wet cheeks with the back of a hand. \u201cDo come in, my dearies, and take a dish of tea, and some food. Ye\u2019ll be famished, no doubt, after such a journey. Ulysses!\u201d She turned, seeking, and her butler stepped forward, bowing low.</p><p>\u201cMadame,\u201d he said to me, and \u201cSir,\u201d to Jamie. \u201cEverything is ready, Miss Jo,\u201d he said softly to his mistress, and offered her his arm.</p><p>As they started up the brick walk, Fergus turned to Ian and bowed, mimicking the butler\u2019s courtly manner, then offered an arm in mockery. Ian kicked him neatly in the backside, and walked up the path, head turning from side to side to take in everything. His green ribbon had come undone, and was dangling halfway down his back.</p><p>Jamie snorted at the horseplay, but smiled nonetheless.</p><p>\u201cMadame?\u201d He put out an arm to me, and I took it, sweeping rather grandly up the path to the doors of River Run, flung wide to greet us.</p><p>The house was spacious and airy inside, with high ceilings and wide French doors in all the downstairs rooms. I caught a glimpse of silver and crystal as we passed a large formal dining room, and thought that on the evidence, Hector Cameron must have been a very successful planter indeed.</p><p>Jocasta led us to her private parlor, a smaller, more intimate room no less well furnished than the larger rooms, but which sported homely touches among the gleam of polished furniture and the glitter of ornaments. A large knitting basket full of yarn balls sat on a small table of polished wood, beside a glass vase spilling summer flowers and a small, ornate silver bell; a spinning wheel turned slowly by itself in the breeze from the open French doors.</p><p>The butler escorted us into the room, saw his mistress seated, then turned to a sideboard that held a collection of jugs and bottles.</p><p>\u201cYe\u2019ll have a dram to celebrate your coming, Jamie?\u201d Jocasta waved a long, slim hand in the direction of the sideboard. \u201cI shouldna think ye\u2019ll have tasted decent whisky since ye left Scotland, aye?\u201d</p><p>Jamie laughed, sitting down opposite her.</p><p>\u201cIndeed not, Aunt. And how d\u2019ye come by it here?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged and smiled, looking complacent.</p><p>\u201cYour uncle had the luck to lay down a good stock, some years agone. He took half a shipload of wine and liquor in trade for a warehouse of tobacco, meaning to sell it\u2014but then the Parliament passed an Act making it illegal for any but the Crown to sell any liquor stronger than ale in the Colonies, and so we ended with two hundred bottles o\u2019 the stuff in the wine cellar!\u201d</p><p>She stretched out her hand toward the table by her chair, not bothering to look. She didn\u2019t need to; the butler set down a crystal tumbler softly, just where her fingers would touch it. Her hand closed around it, and she lifted it, passing it under her nose and sniffing, eyes closed in sensual delight.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a good bit left of it yet. A great deal more than I can guzzle by myself, I\u2019ll tell ye!\u201d She opened her eyes and smiled, lifting the tumbler toward us. \u201cTo you, nephew, and your dear wife\u2014may ye find this house home! Sl\u00e0inte!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSl\u00e0inte mbar!\u201d Jamie answered, and we all drank.</p><p>It was good whisky; smooth as buttered silk and heartening as sunshine. I could feel it hit the pit of my stomach, take root, and spread up my backbone.</p><p>It seemed to have a similar effect on Jamie; I could see the slight frown between his brows ease, as his face relaxed.</p><p>\u201cI shall have Ulysses write this night, to tell your sister that ye\u2019ve come safe here,\u201d Jocasta was saying. \u201cShe\u2019ll have been sair worrit for her wee laddie, I\u2019m sure, thinking of all the misfortunes that might have beset ye along the way.\u201d</p><p>Jamie set down his glass and cleared his throat, steeling himself for the ordeal of confession.</p><p>\u201cAs to misfortune, Aunt, I am afraid I must tell ye...\u201d</p><p>I looked away, not wanting to increase his discomfort by watching as he explained concisely the dismal state of our fortunes. Jocasta listened with close attention, uttering small noises of dismay at his account of our meeting with the pirates. \u201cWicked, ah, wicked!\u201d she exclaimed. \u201cTo repay your kindness in such fashion! The man should be hangit!\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWell, there\u2019s none to blame save myself, Aunt,\u201d Jamie said ruefully. \u201cHe would have been hangit, if not for me. And since I did ken the man for a villain to start, I canna be much surprised to see him commit villainy at the end.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmphm.\u201d Jocasta drew herself up taller in her seat, looking a bit over Jamie\u2019s left shoulder as she spoke.</p><p>\u201cBe that as it may, nephew. I said ye must consider River Run as your home; I did mean it. You and yours are welcome here. And I am sure we shall contrive a way to mend your fortunes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thank ye, Aunt,\u201d Jamie murmured, but he didn\u2019t want to meet her eyes, either. He looked down at the floor, and I could see the hand around his whisky glass clenched tight enough to leave the knuckles white.</p> <p>The conversation fortunately moved on to talk of Jenny and her family at Lallybroch, and Jamie\u2019s embarrassment eased a bit. Dinner had been ordered; I could smell brief tantalizing whiffs of roasting meat from the cookhouse, borne on the evening breeze that wafted across the lawns and flower beds.</p><p>Fergus got up and tactfully excused himself, while Ian wandered around the room, picking things up and putting them down. Rollo, bored with the indoors, sniffed his way industriously along the doorsill, watched with open dislike by the fastidious butler.</p><p>The house and all its furnishings were simple but well crafted, beautiful, and arranged with something more than just taste. I realized what lay behind the elegant proportions and graceful arrangements, when Ian stopped abruptly by a large painting on the wall.</p><p>\u201cAuntie Jocasta!\u201d he exclaimed, turning eagerly to face her. \u201cDid you paint this? It\u2019s got your name on it.\u201d</p><p>I thought a sudden shadow crossed her face, but then she smiled again.</p> <p>\u201cThe view o\u2019 the mountains? Aye, I always loved the sight of them. I\u2019d go with Hector, when he went up into the backcountry to trade for hides. We\u2019d camp in the mountains, and set up a great blaze of a bonfire, wi\u2019 the servants keeping it going day and night, as a signal. And within a few days, the red savages would come down through the forest, and sit by the fire to talk and to drink whisky and trade\u2014and I, I would sit by the hour wi\u2019 my sketchbook and my charcoals, drawing everything I could see.\u201d</p><p>She turned, nodding toward the far end of the room.</p><p>\u201cGo and look at that one in the corner, laddie. See can ye find the Indian I put in it, hiding in the trees.\u201d</p><p>Jocasta finished her whisky and set down her glass. The butler offered to refill it, but she waved him away without looking at him. He set down the decanter and vanished quietly into the hall.</p><p>\u201cAye, I loved the sight o\u2019 the mountains,\u201d Jocasta said again, softly. \u201cThey\u2019re none so black and barren as Scotland, but the sun on the rocks and the mist in the trees did remind me of Leoch, now and then.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head then, and smiled a bit too brightly at Jamie.</p> <p>\u201cBut this has been home for a long time now, nephew\u2014and I hope ye will consider it yours as well.\u201d</p><p>We had little other choice, but Jamie bobbed his head, murmuring something dutifully appreciative in reply. He was interrupted, though, by Rollo, who raised his head with a startled Wuff!</p><p>\u201cWhat is it, dog?\u201d said Ian, coming to stand by the big wolf-dog. \u201cD\u2019ye smell something?\u201d Rollo was whining, staring out into the shadowy flower border and twitching his thick ruff with unease.</p><p>Jocasta turned her head toward the open door and sniffed audibly, fine nostrils flaring.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a skunk,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cA skunk!\u201d Ian whirled to stare at her, appalled. \u201cThey come so close to the house?\u201d</p><p>Jamie had got up in a hurry, and gone to peer out into the evening.</p><p>\u201cI dinna see it yet,\u201d he said. His hand groped automatically at his belt, but of course he wasn\u2019t wearing a dirk with his good suit. He turned to Jocasta. \u201cHave ye any weapons in the house, Aunt?\u201d</p> <p>Jocasta\u2019s mouth hung open.</p><p>\u201cAye,\u201d she said. \u201cPlenty. But\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cJamie,\u201d I said. \u201cA skunk isn\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>Before either of us could finish, there was a sudden disturbance among the snapdragons in the herbaceous border, the tall stalks waving back and forth. Rollo snarled, and the hackles stood up on his neck.</p><p>\u201cRollo!\u201d Ian glanced round for a makeshift weapon, seized the poker from the fireplace, and brandishing it above his head, made for the door.</p><p>\u201cWait, Ian!\u201d Jamie grabbed his nephew\u2019s upraised arm. \u201cLook.\u201d A wide grin spread across his face, and he pointed to the border. The snapdragons parted, and a fine, fat skunk strolled into view, handsomely striped in black and white, and obviously feeling that all was right with his personal world.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a skunk?\u201d Ian asked incredulously. \u201cWhy, that\u2019s no but a bittie wee stinkard like a polecat!\u201d He wrinkled his nose, with a expression between amusement and disgust. \u201cPhew! And here I thought it was a dangerous huge beastie!\u201d</p><p>The skunk\u2019s satisfied insouciance was too much for Rollo, who pounced forward, uttering a short, sharp bark. He feinted to and fro on the terrace, growling and making short lunges at the skunk, who looked annoyed at the racket.</p><p>\u201cIan,\u201d I said, taking refuge behind Jamie. \u201cCall off your dog. Skunks are dangerous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey are?\u201d Jamie turned a look of puzzlement on me. \u201cBut what\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cPolecats only stink,\u201d I explained. \u201cSkunks\u2014Ian, no! Let it alone, and come inside!\u201d Ian, curious, had reached out and prodded the skunk with his poker. The skunk, offended at this unwarranted intimacy, stamped its feet and elevated its tail.</p><p>I heard the noise of a chair sliding back, and glanced behind me. Jocasta had stood up and was looking alarmed, but made no move to come to the door.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d she said. \u201cWhat are they doing?\u201d To my surprise, she was staring into the room, turning her head from one side to the other, as though trying to locate someone in the dark.</p><p>Suddenly, the truth dawned on me: her hand on the butler\u2019s arm, her touching Jamie\u2019s face in greeting, the glass put ready for her grasp, and the shadow on her face when Ian talked of her painting. Jocasta Cameron was blind.</p><p>A strangled cry and a piercing yelp jerked me back to more pressing issues on the terrace. A tidal wave of acrid scent cascaded into the room, hit the floor, and boiled up around me like a mushroom cloud.</p><p>Choking and gasping, eyes watering from the reek, I groped blindly for Jamie, who was making breathless remarks in Gaelic. Above the cacophony of groaning and piteous yowling outside, I barely heard the small ting! of Jocasta\u2019s bell behind me.</p><p>\u201cUlysses?\u201d she said, sounding resigned. \u201cYe\u2019d best tell Cook the dinner will be late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was luck that it\u2019s summer, at least,\u201d Jocasta said at breakfast next day. \u201cThink if it had been winter and we had to keep the doors closed!\u201d She laughed, showing teeth in surprisingly good condition for her age.</p><p>\u201cOh, aye,\u201d Ian murmured. \u201cPlease, may I have more toast, ma\u2019am?\u201d</p><p>He and Rollo had been first soused in the river, then rubbed with tomatoes from the burgeoning vines that overgrew the necessary house out back. The odor-reducing properties of these fruits worked as well on skunk oil as on the lesser stinks of human waste, but in neither case was the neutralizing effect complete. Ian sat by himself at one end of the long table, next to an open French door, but I saw the maid who brought his toast to him wrinkle her nose unobtrusively as she set the plate before him.</p><p>Perhaps inspired by Ian\u2019s proximity and a desire for open air, Jocasta suggested that we might ride out to the turpentine works in the forest above River Run.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a day\u2019s journey there and back, but I think the weather will keep fine.\u201d She turned toward the open French window, where bees hummed over a herbaceous border of goldenrod and phlox. \u201cHear them?\u201d she said, turning her slightly off-kilter smile toward Jamie. \u201cThe bees do say it will be hot and fair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have keen ears, Madame Cameron,\u201d Fergus said politely. \u201cIf I may be permitted to borrow a horse from your stable, though, I should prefer to go into the town, myself.\u201d I knew he was dying to send word to Marsali in Jamaica; I had helped him to write a long letter the night before, describing our adventures and safe arrival. Rather than wait for a slave to take it with the week\u2019s mail, he would much rather post it with his own hands.</p><p>\u201cIndeed and ye may, Mr. Fergus,\u201d Jocasta said graciously. She smiled round the table generally. \u201cAs I said, ye must all consider River Run as ye would your own home.\u201d</p><p>Jocasta plainly meant to accompany us on the ride; she came down dressed in a habit of dark green muslin, the girl named Phaedre coming behind, carrying a hat trimmed to match with velvet ribbon. She paused in the hall, but instead of putting on the hat at once, she stood while Phaedre tied a strip of white linen firmly round her head, covering her eyes.</p><p>\u201cI can see nothing but light,\u201d she explained. \u201cI canna make out objects at all. Still, the light of the sun causes me pain, so I must shield my eyes when venturing out. Are you ready, my dears?\u201d</p><p>That answered some of my speculations concerning her blindness, though didn\u2019t entirely assuage them. Retinitis pigmentosum? I wondered with interest, as I followed her down the wide front hall. Or perhaps macular degeneration, though glaucoma was perhaps the most likely possibility. Not for the first time\u2014or the last, I was sure\u2014my fingers curved around the handle of an invisible ophthalmoscope, itching to see what could not be seen with eyes alone.</p><p>To my surprise, when we went out to the stable block, a mare was standing ready saddled for Jocasta, rather than the carriage I had expected. The gift of charming horses ran strong in the MacKenzie line; the mare lifted her head and whickered at sight of her mistress, and Jocasta went to the horse at once, her face alight with pleasure.</p><p>\u201cCiamar a tha tu?\u201d she said, stroking the soft Roman nose. \u201cThis will be my sweet Corinna. Is she not a dear lassie?\u201d Reaching in her pocket, she pulled out a small green apple, which the horse accepted with delicate pleasure.</p><p>\u201cAnd have they seen to your knee, mo chridhe?\u201d Stooping, Jocasta ran a hand down the horse\u2019s shoulder and leg to just inside the knee, finding and exploring a healing scar with expert fingers. \u201cWhat say ye, nephew? Is she sound? Can she stand a day\u2019s ride?\u201d</p><p>Jamie clicked his tongue, and Corinna obligingly took a step toward him, clearly recognizing someone who spoke her language. He took a look at her leg, took her bridle in hand and with a word or two in soft Gaelic, urged her to walk. Then he pulled her to a halt, swung into the saddle, and trotted gently twice round the stableyard, coming to a stop by the waiting Jocasta.</p><p>\u201cAye,\u201d he said, stepping down. \u201cShe\u2019s canty enough, Aunt. What did her the injury?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHappen as it was a snake, sir,\u201d said the groom, a young black man who had stood back, intently watching Jamie with the horse.</p><p>\u201cNot a snakebite, surely?\u201d I said, surprised. \u201cIt looks like a tear\u2014as though she\u2019d caught her leg on something.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He looked at me with raised brows, but nodded with respect.</p><p>\u201cAye, mum, that it was. \u2019Twas a month past, I heard the lass let out a rare skelloch, and such a kebbie-lebbie o\u2019 bangin\u2019 and crashin\u2019, as ye\u2019d think the whole stable was comin\u2019 doon aboot my head. When I rushed to see the trouble, I found the bloody corpse of a great poison snake lyin\u2019 crushed in the straw beneath the manger. The manger was dashit all to pieces, and the wee lassie quiverin\u2019 in the corner, the blood streamin\u2019 doon her leg from a splinter where she\u2019d caught herself.\u201d He glanced at the horse with obvious pride. \u201cOch, such a brave wee creature as ye are, lass!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe \u2018great poison snake\u2019 was perhaps a foot long,\u201d Jocasta said to me in an dry undertone. \u201cAnd a simple green gardensnake, forbye. But the foolish thing\u2019s got a morbid dread o\u2019 snakes. Let her see one, and she loses her head entirely.\u201d She cocked her head in the direction of the young groom and smiled. \u201cWee Josh is none so fond o\u2019 them, either, is he?\u201d</p><p>The groom grinned in answer.</p> <p>\u201cNo, ma\u2019am,\u201d he said. \u201cI canna thole the creatures, nay more than my lassie.\u201d</p><p>Ian, who had been listening to this exchange, couldn\u2019t hold back his curiosity any longer.</p><p>\u201cWhere d\u2019ye come from, man?\u201d he asked the groom, peering at the young man in fascination.</p><p>Josh wrinkled his brow.</p><p>\u201cCome from? I dinna come\u2014oh, aye, I tak\u2019 your meaning now. I was born upriver, on Mr. George Burnett\u2019s place. Miss Jo bought me twa year past, at Eastertide.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd I think we may assume that Mr. Burnett himself was conceived within crow\u2019s flight of Aberdeen,\u201d Jamie said softly to me. \u201cAye?\u201d</p><p>River Run took in quite a large territory, including not only its prime riverfront acreage but a substantial chunk of the longleaf pine forest that covered a third of the colony. In addition, Hector Cameron had cannily acquired land containing a wide creek, one of many that flowed into Cape Fear.</p><p>Thus provided not only with the valuable commodities of timber, pitch, and turpentine but with a convenient means of getting them to market, it was little wonder that River Run had prospered, even though it produced only modest quantities of tobacco and indigo\u2014though the fragrant fields of green tobacco through which we rode looked more than modest to me.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a wee mill,\u201d Jocasta was explaining, as we rode. \u201cJust above the joining of the creek and the river. The sawing and shaping are done there, and then the boards and barrels are sent downriver by barge to Wilmington. It\u2019s no great distance from the house to the mill by water, if ye choose to row upstream, but I thought to show ye a bit of the country instead.\u201d She breathed the pine-scented air with pleasure. \u201cIt\u2019s been a time since I was out, myself.\u201d</p><p>It was pleasant country. Once in the pine forest, it was much cooler, the sun blocked out by the clustered needles overhead. Far overhead the trunks of the trees soared upward for twenty or thirty feet before branching out\u2014no great surprise to hear that the largest part of the mill\u2019s output was masts and spars, made for the Royal Navy.</p><p>River Run did a great deal of business with the navy, it seemed, judging from Jocasta\u2019s conversation; masts, spars, laths, timbers, pitch, turpentine, and tar. Jamie rode close by her side, listening intently as she explained everything in detail, leaving me and Ian to trail behind. Evidently, she had worked closely with her husband in building River Run; I wondered how she managed the place by herself, now that he was gone.</p> <p>\u201cLook!\u201d Ian said, pointing. \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>I pulled up and walked my horse, along with his, to the tree he had pointed out. A great slab of bark had been taken off, exposing the inner wood for a stretch of four feet or more on one side. Within this area, the yellow-white wood was crosshatched in a sort of herringbone pattern, as though it had been slashed back and forth with a knife.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re near,\u201d Jocasta said. Jamie had seen us stop, and they had ridden back to join us. \u201cThat will be a turpentine tree you\u2019re seeing; I smell it.\u201d</p><p>We all could; the scent of cut wood and pungent resin was so strong that even I could have found the tree blindfolded. Now that we had stopped, I could hear noises in the distance; the rumblings and thumps of men at work, the chunk of an ax and voices calling back and forth. Breathing in, I also caught a whiff of something burning.</p><p>Jocasta edged Corinna close to the cut tree.</p><p>\u201cHere,\u201d she said, touching the bottom of the cut, where a rough hollow had been chiseled out of the wood. \u201cWe call it the box; that\u2019s where the sap and the raw turpentine drip down and collect. This one is nearly full; there\u2019ll be a slave along soon to dip it out.\u201d</p><p>No sooner had she spoken than a man appeared through the trees; a slave dressed in no more than a loincloth, leading a large white mule with a broad strap slung across its back, a barrel suspended on either side. The mule stopped dead when he saw us, flung back his head, and brayed hysterically.</p><p>\u201cThat will be Clarence,\u201d Jocasta said, loudly enough to be heard above the noise. \u201cHe likes to see folk. And who is that with him? Is it you, Pompey?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYah\u2019m. S\u2019me.\u201d The slave gripped the mule by the upper lip and gave it a vicious twist. \u201cLea\u2019f, vassar!\u201d As I made the mental translation of this expression into \u201cLeave off, you bastard!\u201d the man turned toward us, and I saw that his slurred speech was caused by the fact that the lower left half of his jaw was gone; his face below the cheekbone simply fell away into a deep depression filled with white scar tissue.</p><p>Jocasta must have heard my gasp of shock\u2014or only have expected such a response\u2014for she turned her blindfold toward me.</p><p>\u201cIt was a pitch explosion\u2014fortunate he was not killed. Come, we\u2019re near the works.\u201d Without waiting for her groom, she turned her horse\u2019s head expertly, and made off through the trees, toward the scent of burning.</p><p>The contrast of the turpentine works with the quiet of the forest was amazing; a large clearing full of people, all in a hum of activity. Most were slaves, dressed in the minimum of clothing, limbs and bodies smudged with charcoal.</p><p>\u201cIs anyone at the sheds?\u201d Jocasta turned her head toward me.</p><p>I rose in my stirrups to look; at the far side of the clearing, near a row of ramshackle sheds, I caught a flash of color; three men in the uniform of the British Navy, and another in a bottle-green coat.</p><p>\u201cThat will be my particular friend,\u201d Jocasta said, smiling in satisfaction at my description. \u201cMr. Farquard Campbell. Come, Nephew; I should like ye to meet him.\u201d</p><p>Seen up close, Campbell proved to be a man of sixty or so, no more than middle height, but with that particular brand of leathery toughness that some Scotsmen exhibit as they age\u2014not so much a weathering as a tanning process that results in a surface like a leather targe, capable of turning the sharpest blade.</p><p>Campbell greeted Jocasta with pleasure, bowed courteously to me, acknowledged Ian with the flick of a brow, then turned the full force of his shrewd gray eyes on Jamie.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s verra pleased I am that you\u2019re here, Mr. Fraser,\u201d he said, extending his hand. \u201cVerra pleased, indeed. I\u2019ve heard a deal about ye, ever since your aunt learned of your intentions to visit River Run.\u201d</p><p>He appeared sincerely delighted to meet Jamie, which struck me as odd. Not that most people weren\u2019t happy to meet Jamie\u2014he was quite a prepossessing man, if I did say so\u2014but there was an air almost of relief in Campbell\u2019s effusive greeting, which seemed unusual for someone whose outward appearance was entirely one of reserve and taciturnity.</p><p>If Jamie noticed anything odd, he hid his puzzlement behind a facade of courtesy.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m flattered that ye should have spared a moment\u2019s thought to me, Mr. Campbell.\u201d Jamie smiled pleasantly, and bowed toward the naval officers. \u201cGentlemen? I am pleased to make your acquaintance, as well.\u201d</p><p>Thus given an opening, a chubby, frowning little person named Lieutenant Wolff and his two ensigns made their introductions, and after perfunctory bows, dismissed me and Jocasta from mind and conversation, turning their attention at once to a discussion of board feet and gallons.</p><p>Jamie lifted one eyebrow at me, with a slight nod toward Jocasta, suggesting in marital shorthand that I take his aunt and bugger off while business was conducted.</p><p>Jocasta, however, showed not the slightest inclination to remove herself.</p><p>\u201cDo go on, my dear,\u201d she urged me. \u201cJosh will show ye everything. I\u2019ll just wait in the shade whilst the gentlemen conduct their business; the heat\u2019s a bit much for me, I\u2019m afraid.\u201d</p><p>The men had sat down to discuss business inside an open-fronted shed that boasted a crude table with a number of stools; presumably this was where the slaves took their meals, suffering the blackflies for the sake of air. Another shed served for storage; the third, which was enclosed, I deduced must be the sleeping quarters.</p><p>Beyond the sheds, toward the center of the clearing, were two or three large fires, over which huge kettles steamed in the sunshine, suspended from tripods.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ll be cookin\u2019 doon the turpentine, a-boilin\u2019 it intae pitch,\u201d Josh explained, taking me within eyeshot of one of the kettles. \u201cSome is put intae the barrels as is\u201d\u2014he nodded toward the sheds, where a wagon was parked, piled high with barrels\u2014\u201cbut the rest is made intae pitch. The naval gentlemen will be sayin\u2019 how much they\u2019ll be needin\u2019, so as we\u2019ll know.\u201d</p><p>A small boy of seven or eight was perched on a high, rickety stool, stirring the pot with a long stick; a taller youth stood by with an enormous ladle, with which he removed the lighter layer of purified turpentine at the top of the kettle, depositing this in a barrel to one side.</p><p>As I watched them, a slave came out of the forest, leading a mule, and headed for the kettle. Another man came to help, and together they unloaded the barrels\u2014plainly heavy\u2014from the mule, and upended them into the kettle, one at a time, with a great whoosh of pungent yellowish pinesap.</p><p>\u201cOch, ye\u2019ll want to stand back a bit, mum,\u201d Josh said, taking my arm to draw me away from the fire. \u201cThe stuff does splash a bit, and happen it should take fire, ye wouldna want to be burnt.\u201d</p><p>Having seen the man in the forest, I most certainly didn\u2019t want to be burned. I drew away, and glanced back at the sheds. Jamie, Mr. Campbell, and the naval men were sitting on stools around a table inside one hut, sharing something from a bottle and poking at a sheaf of papers on the table.</p><p>Standing pressed against the shed wall, out of sight of the men within, was Jocasta Cameron. Having abandoned her pretense of exhaustion, she was plainly listening for all she was worth.</p><p>Josh caught the expression of surprise on my face, and turned to see what I was looking at.</p><p>\u201cMiss Jo does hate not to have the charge o\u2019 things,\u201d he murmured regretfully. \u201cI havena haird her myself, but yon lass Phaedre did say as how Mistress takes on when she canna manage something\u2014a\u2019rantin\u2019 dreadful, she says, and stampin\u2019 something fierce.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThat must be quite a remarkable spectacle,\u201d I murmured. \u201cWhat is she not able to manage, though?\u201d From all appearances, Jocasta Cameron had her house, fields, and people well in hand, blind or not.</p><p>Now it was his turn to look surprised.</p><p>\u201cOch, it\u2019s the bluidy Navy. Did she not say why we came today?\u201d</p><p>Before I could go into the fascinating question of why Jocasta Cameron should wish to manage the British Navy, today or any other day, we were interrupted by a cry of alarm from the far side of the clearing. I turned to look, and was nearly trampled by several half-naked men running in panic toward the sheds.</p> <p>At the far side of the clearing a peculiar sort of mound rose up out of the ground; I had noticed it earlier but had had no chance to ask about it yet. While the floor of the clearing was mostly dirt, the mound was covered with grass\u2014but grass of a peculiar, patchy sort; part was green, part gone yellow, and here and there was an oblong of grass that was stark, dead brown.</p><p>Just as I realized that this effect was the result of the mound\u2019s being covered in cut turves, the whole thing blew up. There was no sound of explosion, just a sort of muffled noise like a huge sneeze, and a faint wave of concussion in the air that brushed my cheek.</p><p>If it didn\u2019t sound like an explosion, it certainly looked like one; pieces of turf and bits of burnt wood began to rain down all over the clearing. There was a lot of shouting, and Jamie and his companions came rocketing out of the shed like a flock of startled pheasants.</p><p>\u201cAre ye all right, Sassenach?\u201d He grasped my arm, looking anxious.</p><p>\u201cYes, fine,\u201d I said, rather confused. \u201cWhat on earth just happened?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDamned if I ken,\u201d he said briefly, already looking round the clearing. \u201cWhere\u2019s Ian?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. You don\u2019t think he had anything to do with this, do you?\u201d I brushed at several floating specks of charcoal that had landed on my bosom. With black streaks ornamenting my d\u00e9colletage, I followed Jamie into the small knot of slaves, all babbling in a confusing mixture of Gaelic, English, and bits of various African tongues.</p><p>We found Ian with one of the young naval ensigns. They were peering interestedly into the blackened pit that now occupied the spot where the mound had stood.</p><p>\u201cIt happens often, I understand,\u201d the ensign was saying as we arrived. \u201cI hadn\u2019t seen it before, though\u2014amazing powerful blast, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happens often?\u201d I asked, peering around Ian. The pit was filled with a crisscross jumble of blackened pine logs, all tossed higgledy-piggledy by the force of the explosion. The base of the mound was still there, rising up around the pit like the rim of a pie shell.</p><p>\u201cA pitch explosion,\u201d the ensign explained, turning to me. He was small and ruddy-cheeked, about Ian\u2019s age. \u201cThey lay a charcoal fire, d\u2019ye see, ma\u2019am, below a great pot of pitch, and cover it all over with earth and cut turves, to keep in the heat, but allow enough air through the cracks to keep the fire burning. The pitch boils down, and flows out through a hollowed log into the tar barrel\u2014see?\u201d He pointed. A split log dangled over the remains of a shattered barrel oozing sticky black. The reek of burnt wood and thick tar filled the air, and I tried to breathe only through my mouth.</p> <p>\u201cThe difficulty lies in regulating the flow of air,\u201d the little ensign went on, preening himself a bit on his knowledge. \u201cToo little air, and the fire goes out; too much, and it burns with such energy that it cannot be contained, and is like to ignite the fumes from the pitch and burst its bonds. As you see, ma\u2019am.\u201d He gestured importantly toward a nearby tree, where one of the turves had been thrown with such force as to wrap itself around the trunk like some shaggy yellow fungus.</p><p>\u201cIt is a matter of the nicest adjustment,\u201d he said, and stood on tiptoe, looking around with interest. \u201cWhere is the slave whose task it is to manage the fire? I do hope the poor fellow has not been killed.\u201d</p><p>He hadn\u2019t. I had been checking carefully through the crowd as we talked, looking for any injuries, but everyone seemed to have escaped intact\u2014this time.</p><p>\u201cAunt!\u201d Jamie exclaimed, suddenly recalling Jocasta. He whirled toward the sheds, but then stopped, relaxing. She was there, clearly visible in her green dress, standing rigid by the shed.</p><p>Rigid with fury, as we discovered when we reached her. Forgotten by everyone in the flurry of the explosion, she had been unable to move, sightless as she was, and was thus left to stand helpless, hearing the turmoil but unable to do anything.</p><p>I recalled what Josh had said about Jocasta\u2019s temper, but she was too much the lady to stamp and rant in public, however angry she might be. Josh himself apologized in profuse Aberdonian for not having been by her side to aid her, but she dismissed this with kind, if brusque, impatience.</p><p>\u201cClapper your tongue, lad; ye did as I bade ye.\u201d She turned her head restlessly from side to side, as though trying to see through her blindfold.</p><p>\u201cFarquard, where are you?\u201d</p> <p>Mr. Campbell moved to her and put her hand through his arm, patting it briefly.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no great harm done, my dear,\u201d he assured her. \u201cNo one hurt, and only the one barrel of tar destroyed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d she said, the tension in her tall figure relaxing slightly. \u201cBut where is Byrnes?\u201d she inquired. \u201cI do not hear his voice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe overseer?\u201d Lieutenant Wolff mopped several smuts from his sweating face with a large linen kerchief. \u201cI had wondered that myself. We found no one here to greet us this morning. Fortunately, Mr. Campbell arrived soon thereafter.\u201d</p><p>Farquard Campbell made a small noise in his throat, deprecating his own involvement.</p><p>\u201cByrnes will be at the mill, I expect,\u201d he said. \u201cOne of the slaves here told me there had been some trouble wi\u2019 the main blade of the saw. Doubtless he will be attending to that.\u201d</p><p>Wolff looked puff-faced, as though he considered defective saw blades a poor excuse for not having been appropriately received. From the tight line of Jocasta\u2019s lips, so did she.</p><p>Jamie coughed, reached over and plucked a small clump of grass out of my hair.</p><p>\u201cI do believe that I saw a basket of luncheon packed, did I not, Aunt? Perhaps ye might help the Lieutenant to a wee bit of refreshment, whilst I tidy up matters here?\u201d</p><p>It was the right suggestion. Jocasta\u2019s lips eased a bit, and Wolff looked distinctly happier at the mention of lunch.</p><p>\u201cIndeed, Nephew.\u201d She drew herself upright, her air of command restored, and nodded in the general direction of Wolff\u2019s voice. \u201cLieutenant, will ye be so kind as to join me?\u201d</p><p>Over lunch, I gathered that the Lieutenant\u2019s visit to the turpentine works was a quarterly affair, during which a contract was drawn up for the purchase and delivery of assorted naval stores. It was the Lieutenant\u2019s business to make and review similar arrangements with plantation owners from Cross Creek to the Virginia border, and Lieutenant Wolff made it plain which end of the colony he preferred.</p><p>\u201cIf there is one area of endeavor at which I will admit the Scotch excel,\u201d the Lieutenant proclaimed rather pompously, taking a good-sized swallow of his third cup of whisky, \u201cit is in the production of drink.\u201d</p><p>Farquard Campbell, who had been taking appreciative sips from his own pewter cup, gave a small, dry smile and said nothing. Jocasta sat beside him on a rickety bench. Her fingers rested lightly on his arm, sensitive as a seismograph, feeling for subterranean clues.</p><p>Wolff made an unsuccessful attempt to stifle a belch, and belatedly turned what he appeared to consider his charm on me.</p><p>\u201cIn most other respects,\u201d he went on, leaning toward me confidentially, \u201cthey are as a race both lazy and stubborn, a pair of traits which renders them unfit for\u2014\u201d At this point, the youngest ensign, red with embarrassment, knocked over a bowl of apples, creating enough of a diversion to prevent the completion of the Lieutenant\u2019s thought\u2014though not, unfortunately, sufficient to deflect its train altogether.</p><p>The Lieutenant dabbed at the sweat leaking from under his wig, and peered at me through bloodshot eyes.</p><p>\u201cBut I collect that you are not Scotch, ma\u2019am? Your voice is most melodious and well-bred, and I may say so. You have no trace of a barbarous accent, in spite of your associations.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh...thank you,\u201d I murmured, wondering what trick of administrative incompetence had sent the Lieutenant to conduct the Navy\u2019s business in the Cape Fear River Valley, possibly the single largest collection of Scottish Highlanders to be found in the New World. I began to see what Josh had meant by \u201cOch, the bluidy Navy!\u201d</p><p>Jocasta\u2019s smile might have been stitched on. Mr. Campbell, beside her, gave me the barest flick of gray eyebrow, and looked austere. Evidently, stabbing the Lieutenant through the heart with a fruit knife wasn\u2019t on\u2014at least not until he had signed the requisition order\u2014so I did the next best thing I could think of; I picked up the whisky bottle and refilled his cup to the brim.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s terribly good, isn\u2019t it? Won\u2019t you have a bit more, Lieutenant?\u201d</p><p>It was good; smooth and warm. Also very expensive. I turned to the young-est ensign, smiled warmly at him, and left the Lieutenant to find his own way to the bottom of the bottle.</p><p>Conversation proceeded jerkily but without further incident, though the two ensigns kept a wary eye on the Drunkard\u2019s Progress going on across the table. No wonder; it would be their responsibility to get the Lieutenant on a horse and back to Cross Creek in one piece. I began to see why there were two of them.</p><p>\u201cMr. Fraser seems to be managing most creditably,\u201d the older ensign murmured, nodding outside in a feeble attempt to restart the stalled conversation. \u201cDo you not think, sir?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh? Ah. No doubt.\u201d Wolff had lost interest in anything much beyond the bottom of his cup, but it was true enough. While the rest of us sat over our lunch, Jamie\u2014with Ian\u2019s aid\u2014had managed to restore order to the clearing, set the pitch boilers and sap gatherers back to work, and collect the debris of the explosion. At present he was on the far side of the clearing, stripped to shirt and breeches, helping to heave half-burned logs back into the tar pit. I rather envied him; it looked to be much more pleasant work than lunching with Lieutenant Wolff.</p><p>\u201cAye, he\u2019s done well.\u201d Farquard Campbell\u2019s quick eyes flicked over the clearing, then returned to the table. He assessed the Lieutenant\u2019s condition, and gave Jocasta\u2019s hand a brief squeeze. Without turning her head, she spoke to Josh, who had been lurking quietly in the corner.</p><p>\u201cDo ye put that second bottle into the Lieutenant\u2019s saddlebag, laddie,\u201d she said. \u201cI should not want it to be going to waste.\u201d She gave the Lieutenant a charming smile, rendered the more convincing as he couldn\u2019t see her eyes.</p><p>Mr. Campbell cleared his throat.</p><p>\u201cSince ye will so soon be leaving us, sir, perhaps we might settle the matter of your requisitions now?\u201d</p><p>Wolff seemed vaguely surprised to hear that he had been about to leave, but his ensigns sprang to their feet with alacrity, and began to gather up papers and saddlebags. One snatched out a traveling inkwell and a sharpened quill and set them down in front of the Lieutenant; Mr. Campbell whipped out a folded quire of paper from his coat and laid it down, ready for signature. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Wolff frowned at the paper, and swayed a little.</p><p>\u201cJust there, sir,\u201d murmured the elder ensign, putting the quill into his senior\u2019s slack hand and pointing at the paper.</p><p>Wolff picked up his cup, tilted back his head, and drained the last drops. Setting the cup down with a bang, he smiled vacantly around, his eyes unfocused. The youngest ensign closed his eyes in resignation.</p><p>\u201cOh, why not?\u201d the Lieutenant said recklessly, and dipped his quill.</p> <p>\u201cWill ye not wish to wash and change your clothes at once, Nephew?\u201d Jocasta\u2019s nostrils flared delicately. \u201cYe stink most dreadfully of tar and charcoal.\u201d</p><p>I thought it just as well she couldn\u2019t see him. It went a long way beyond stinking; his hands were black, his new shirt reduced to a filthy rag, and his face so begrimed that he looked as though he had been cleaning chimneys. Such portions of him as weren\u2019t black, were red. He had left off his hat while working in the midday sun, and the bridge of his nose was the color of cooked lobster. I didn\u2019t think the color was due entirely to the sun, though.</p><p>\u201cMy ablutions can wait,\u201d he said. \u201cFirst, I wish to know the meaning of yon wee charade.\u201d He fixed Mr. Campbell with a dark blue look.</p><p>\u201cI am lured to the forest upon the pretext of smelling turpentine, and before I ken where I am, I\u2019m sitting wi\u2019 the British Navy, saying aye and nay to matters I ken nothing of, wi\u2019 yon wee mannie kickin\u2019 my shins under the table like a trained monkey!\u201d</p><p>Jocasta smiled at that.</p> <p>Campbell sighed. In spite of the exertions of the day, his neat coat showed no signs of dust, and his old-fashioned peruke sat squarely on his head.</p><p>\u201cYou have my apologies, Mr. Fraser, for what must seem a monstrous imposition upon your good nature. As it is, your arrival was fortuitous in the extreme, but did not allow sufficient time for communications to be made. I was in Averasboro until last evening, and by the time I received word of your arrival, it was much too late for me to ride here to acquaint you with the circumstances.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIndeed? Well, as I perceive we have a bit of time at present, I invite ye to do so now,\u201d Jamie said, with a slight click as his teeth closed on the \u201cnow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill ye not sit down first, Nephew?\u201d Jocasta put in, with a graceful wave of her hand. \u201cIt will take a bit of talk to explain, and ye\u2019ve had a tiring day of it, no?\u201d Ulysses had materialized out of the ether with a linen sheet over his arm; he spread this over a chair with a flourish, and gestured to Jamie to sit down.</p><p>Jamie eyed the butler narrowly, but it had been a tiring day; I could see blisters amid the soot on his hands, and sweat had made clear runnels in the filth on face and neck. He sank slowly into the proffered chair, and allowed a silver cup to be put into his hand.</p><p>A similar cup appeared as if by magic in my own hand, and I smiled in gratitude at the butler; I hadn\u2019t been hoiking logs about, but the long, hot ride had worn me out. I took a deep, appreciative sip; a lovely cool rough cider, that bit the tongue and slaked the thirst at once.</p> <p>Jamie took a deep draught, and looked a little calmer.</p><p>\u201cWell, then, Mr. Campbell?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is a matter of the Navy,\u201d Campbell began, and Jocasta snorted.</p><p>\u201cA matter of Lieutenant Wolff, ye mean,\u201d she corrected.</p><p>\u201cFor your purposes the same, Jo, and well ye know it,\u201d Mr. Campbell said, a little sharply. He turned back to Jamie to explain.</p><p>The majority of River Run\u2019s revenues were, as Jocasta had told us, derived from the sale of its timber and turpentine products, the largest and most profitable customer being the British Navy.</p><p>\u201cBut the Navy\u2019s not what it was,\u201d Mr. Campbell said, shaking his head regretfully. \u201cDuring the war wi\u2019 the French, they could scarce keep the fleet supplied, and any man with a working sawmill was rich. But for the last ten years, it\u2019s been peaceful, and the ships left to rot\u2014the Admiralty\u2019s not laid a new keel in five years.\u201d He sighed at the unfortunate economic consequences of peace.</p><p>The Navy did still require such stores as pitch and turpentine and spars\u2014with a leaky fleet to keep afloat, tar would always find a market. However, the market had shrunk severely, and the Navy now could pick and choose those landowners with whom they did business.</p> <p>The Navy requiring dependability above all things, their covetable contracts were renewed quarterly, upon inspection and approval by a senior naval officer\u2014in this case, Wolff. Always difficult to deal with, Wolff had nonetheless been adroitly managed by Hector Cameron, until the latter\u2019s death.</p><p>\u201cHector drank with him,\u201d Jocasta put in bluntly. \u201cAnd when he left, there\u2019d be a bottle in his saddlebag, and a bit besides.\u201d The death of Hector Cameron, though, had severely affected the business of the estate.</p><p>\u201cAnd not only because there\u2019s less for bribes,\u201d Campbell said, with a sidelong glance at Jocasta. He cleared his throat primly.</p><p>Lieutenant Wolff, it seemed, had come to give his condolences to the widow Cameron upon the death of her husband, properly uniformed, attended by his ensigns. He had come back again the next day, alone\u2014with a proposal of marriage.</p><p>Jamie, caught mid-swallow, choked on his drink.</p><p>\u201cIt wasna my person the man was interested in,\u201d Jocasta said, sharply, hearing this. \u201cIt was my land.\u201d</p><p>Jamie wisely decided not to comment, merely eyeing his aunt with new interest.</p><p>Having heard the background, I thought she was likely right\u2014Wolff\u2019s interest was in acquiring a profitable plantation, which could be rendered still more profitable by means of the naval contracts his influence could assure. At the same time, the person of Jocasta Cameron was no small added inducement.</p><p>Blind or not, she was a striking woman. Beyond the simple beauty of flesh and bone, though, she exuded a sensual vitality that caused even such a dry stick as Farquard Campbell to ignite when she was near.</p><p>\u201cI suppose that explains the Lieutenant\u2019s offensive behavior at lunch,\u201d I said, interested. \u201cHell hath no fury like a woman scorned, but the blokes don\u2019t like it, either.\u201d</p><p>Jocasta turned her head toward me, startled\u2014I think she had forgotten I was there\u2014but Farquard Campbell laughed.</p><p>\u201cIndeed they don\u2019t, Mrs. Fraser,\u201d he assured me, eyes twinkling. \u201cWe\u2019re fragile things, we poor men; ye trifle with our affections at your peril.\u201d</p><p>Jocasta gave an unladylike snort at this.</p><p>\u201cAffections, forbye!\u201d she said. \u201cThe man has nay affection for anything that doesna come in a bottle.\u201d</p><p>Jamie was eyeing Mr. Campbell with a certain amount of interest.</p><p>\u201cSince ye raise the matter of affections, Aunt,\u201d he said, with a small edge, \u201cmight I inquire as to the interests of your particular friend?\u201d</p><p>Mr. Campbell returned the stare.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve a wife at home, sir,\u201d he said dryly, \u201cand eight weans, the eldest of whom is perhaps a few years older than yourself. But I kent Hector Cameron for more than thirty years, and I\u2019ll do my best by his wife for the sake of his friendship\u2014and hers.\u201d</p><p>Jocasta laid a hand on his arm, and turned her head toward him. If she could no longer use her eyes for impression, she still knew the effect of downswept lashes.</p><p>\u201cFarquard has been a great help to me, Jamie,\u201d she said, with a touch of reproof. \u201cI couldna have managed, without his assistance, after poor Hector died.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, aye,\u201d Jamie said, with no more than a hint of skepticism. \u201cAnd I\u2019m sure I must be as grateful to ye as is my aunt, sir. But I am still wondering just a bit where I come into this tale?\u201d</p><p>Campbell coughed discreetly and went on with his story.</p><p>Jocasta had put off the Lieutenant, feigning collapse from the stress of bereavement and had herself carried to her bedroom, from which she did not emerge until he had concluded his business in Cross Creek and left for Wilmington.</p><p>\u201cByrnes managed the contracts that time, and a fine mess he made of them,\u201d Jocasta put in.</p><p>\u201cAh, Mr. Byrnes, the invisible overseer. And where was he this morning?\u201d</p><p>A maid had appeared with a bowl of warm perfumed water, and a towel. Without asking, she knelt by Jamie\u2019s chair, took one of his hands, and began gently to wash the soot away. Jamie looked slightly taken aback by this attention, but was too occupied by the conversation to send her away.</p><p>A slight wry smile crossed Campbell\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid Mr. Byrnes, though usually a competent overseer, shares one small weakness wi\u2019 the Lieutenant. I sent to the sawmill for him, first thing, but the slave came back and told me Byrnes was insensible in his quarters, reekin\u2019 of drink, and could not be roused.\u201d</p><p>Jocasta made another unladylike noise, which caused Campbell to glance at her with affection before turning back to Jamie.</p><p>\u201cYour aunt is more than capable of managing the business of the estate with Ulysses to assist her in the documentary aspects. However, as ye will have seen yourself\u201d\u2014he gestured delicately at the bowl of water, which now resembled a bowl of ink\u2014\u201cthere are physical concerns to the running of it, as well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was the point that Lieutenant Wolff put to me,\u201d Jocasta said, lips thinning at the memory. \u201cThat I could not expect to manage my property alone, and me not only a woman, but sightless as well. I could not, he said, depend upon Byrnes, unable as I am to go to the forest and the mill to see what the man is doing. Or not doing.\u201d Her mouth shut firmly on the thought.</p><p>\u201cWhich is true enough,\u201d Campbell put in ruefully. \u201cIt is a proverb amongst us\u2014\u2018Happiness is a son old enough to be factor.\u2019 For when it\u2019s a matter of money or slaves, ye cannot trust anyone save your kin.\u201d</p><p>I drew a deep breath and glanced at Jamie, who nodded. At last we\u2019d got to it.</p><p>\u201cAnd that,\u201d I said, \u201cis where Jamie comes in. Am I right?\u201d</p><p>Jocasta had already enlisted Farquard Campbell to deal with Lieutenant Wolff upon his next visit, intending that Campbell should keep Byrnes from committing folly with the contracts. When we had so opportunely arrived, though, Jocasta had hit upon a better plan.</p><p>\u201cI sent word to Farquard that he should inform the Lieutenant that my nephew had come to take up the management of River Run. That would cause him to go cautiously,\u201d she explained. \u201cFor he would not dare to press me, with a kinsman who had an interest standing by.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d Despite himself, Jamie was beginning to look amused. \u201cSo the Lieutenant would think his attempt at a good down-setting here was usurped by my arrival. No wonder the man seemed to take such a mislike to me. I thought it was perhaps a general disgust of Scotsmen that he had, from what he said.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI should imagine that he has\u2014now,\u201d Campbell said, dabbing his lips circumspectly with his napkin.</p><p>Jocasta reached across the table, groping, and Jamie put out his hand instinctively to hers.</p><p>\u201cYou will forgive me, Nephew?\u201d she said. With his hand to guide her, she could look toward his face; one would not have known her blind, by the expression of pleading in her beautiful blue eyes.</p><p>\u201cI knew nothing of your character, d\u2019ye see, before ye came. I could not risk that you would refuse a part in the deception, did I tell ye of it first. Do say that ye hold no grudge toward me, Jamie, if only for sweet Ellen\u2019s sake.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Jamie squeezed her hand gently, assuring her that he held no grudge. Indeed, he was pleased to have come in time to help, and his aunt might count upon his assistance, in any way she chose to call upon him.</p><p>Mr. Campbell beamed and rang the bell; Ulysses brought in the special whisky, with a tray of crystal goblets and a plate of savories, and we drank confusion to the British Navy.</p><p>Looking at that fine-boned face, so full of blind eloquence, though, I couldn\u2019t help recalling the brief synopsis Jamie had once given me of the outstanding characteristics of the members of his family.</p><p>\u201cFrasers are stubborn as rocks,\u201d he\u2019d said. \u201cAnd MacKenzies are charming as larks in the field\u2014but sly as foxes, with it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd where have you been?\u201d Jamie asked, giving Fergus a hard up-and-down. \u201cI didna think ye\u2019d money enough for what it looks as though ye\u2019ve been doing.\u201d</p><p>Fergus smoothed his disheveled hair, and sat down, radiating offended dignity.</p><p>\u201cI met with a pair of French fur-traders in the town. They speaking little English, and myself being fluent, I could not but agree to assist them in their transactions. If they should then choose to invite me to share a small supper at their inn...\u201d He lifted one shoulder in Gallic dismissal of the matter, and turned to more immediate concerns, reaching inside his shirt for a letter.</p><p>\u201cThis had arrived in Cross Creek for you,\u201d he said, handing it to Jamie. \u201cThe postmaster asked me to bring it.\u201d</p><p>It was a thick packet of paper, with a battered seal, and looked in little better condition than did Fergus. Jamie\u2019s face lighted when he saw it, though he opened it with some trepidation. Three letters fell out; one in what I recognized as his sister\u2019s writing, the other two plainly addressed by someone else.</p> <p>Jamie picked up the letter from his sister, eyed it as though it might contain something explosive, and set it gently down by the fruit bowl on the table.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll start wi\u2019 Ian,\u201d he said, picking up the second letter with a grin. \u201cI\u2019m not sure I want to be reading Jenny\u2019s without a glass of whisky in my hand.\u201d</p><p>He prised off the seal with the tip of the silver fruit knife, and opened the letter, scanning the first page. \u201cI wonder if he...\u201d His voice faded off as he began to read.</p><p>Curious, I got up and stood behind his chair, looking over his shoulder. Ian Murray wrote a clear, large hand, and it was easy to read, even at a distance.</p><p>Dear Brother\u2014</p><p>All here are well, and give thanks to God for the news of your safe arrival in the Colonies. I send this missive in care of Jocasta Cameron; should it find you in her company, Jenny bids you to give her kindest regards to her Aunt.</p> <p>You will see from the enclosed that you are restored to my wife\u2019s good graces; she has quite ceased to talk of you in the same breath with Auld Scratch, and I have heard no recent references to Emasculation, which may relieve your mind.</p><p>To put aside jesting\u2014her Heart is much lightened by news of Young Ian\u2019s safety, as is my own. You will know the depth of our gratitude at his Deliverance, I think; therefore I will not Weary you with Repetitions, though in all truth, I could write a Novel upon that theme.</p><p>We manage to keep all here fed, though the barley suffered much from hail, and there is a flux abroad in the village which has claimed two children this month, to their parents\u2019 sorrow. It will be Annie Fraser and Alasdair Kirby we have lost, may God have mercy on their innocence.</p><p>On a happier note, we have had word from Michael in Paris; he continues to prosper in the wine business, and thinks of marrying soon.</p><p>I take joy in acquainting you with news of the birth of my newest grandson, Anthony Brian Montgomery Lyle. I shall content myself with this announcement, leaving a fuller description to Jenny; she is besotted of him, as are we all, he is a Dear Lad. His father, Paul\u2014Maggie\u2019s husband\u2014is a soldier, so Maggie and wee Anthony bide here at Lallybroch. Paul is in France at present; we pray nightly he may be left there, in relative peace, and not sent to the dangers of the Colonies nor the wilds of Canada.</p><p>We have had visitors this week; Simon, Lord Lovat, and his companions. He has come a-gathering again, seeking recruits for the Highland regiment he commands. You will perhaps hear of them in the Colonies, where I understand they have established some small reputation. Simon tells great tales of their bravery against the Indians and the wicked French, some of which are doubtless true.</p><p>Jamie grinned at this, and turned the page over.</p><p>He quite enthralled Henry and Matthew by his stories, and the girls as well. Josephine (\u201cKitty\u2019s eldest,\u201d Jamie observed in an aside to me) was so inspired, indeed, as to engineer a raid upon the chicken-coop, wherefrom she and her Cousins all emerged bedecked with feathers, mud from the kail-yard being employed in lieu of war-paint.</p> <p>As all wished to play Savage, Young Jamie, Kitty\u2019s husband Geordie and myself were pressed into service as the Highland regiment, and obliged to suffer attack by Tomahawk (kitchen spoons and ladles) and other forms of enthusiastic assault, we essaying meanwhile a valiant defense with our broadswords (pieces of lath and willow twigs).</p><p>I put a stop to the Suggestion that the thatch of the dove-cote be set afire with flaming arrows, but was obliged in the end to submit to being Scalped. I flatter myself that I survived this Operation in better case than did the chickens.</p><p>The letter continued in this vein, giving more news of family, but dealing more often with the business of the farm, and reports of events in the district. Emigration, Ian wrote, was \u201cbecome epidemic,\u201d with virtually all of the inhabitants of the village of Shewglie having decided upon this expedient.</p><p>Jamie finished the letter and put it down. He was smiling, his eyes faintly dreamy, as though he saw the cool mists and stones of Lallybroch rather than the humid, vivid jungle that surrounded us.</p><p>The second letter was also addressed in Ian\u2019s hand, but marked Private below the blue wax seal.</p><p>\u201cAnd what will this be, I wonder?\u201d Jamie murmured, breaking the seal and unfolding it. It began without salutation, obviously meant as continuation to the larger letter.</p><p>Now, Brother, I have a matter of some concern to put to you, upon which I write separately, so that you might share my larger letter with Ian, without disclosing this matter.</p><p>Your last letter spoke of putting Ian aboard ship in Charleston. Should this have occurred, we will of course welcome his coming with joy. However, if by chance he has not yet quitted your company, it is our wish that he remain with you, should this obligation be not unpleasing to you and to Claire.</p><p>\u201cNot unpleasing to me,\u201d Jamie muttered, nostrils flaring slightly as he glanced from the page to the window. Ian and Rollo were wrestling on the grass with two young slaves, rolling over and over in a giggling tangle of limbs and cloth and wagging tail. \u201cMmphm.\u201d He turned his back to the window and resumed reading.</p><p>I mentioned Simon Fraser to you, and the cause of his presence here. The regimental levies have been a matter of concern to us for some time, though the matter has not often been pressing, our location being fortunately remote and difficult of travel.</p><p>Lovat finds little trouble in inducing lads to take the King\u2019s shilling; what is there for them here? Poverty and want, with no hope of betterment. Why should they remain here, where they have nothing to inherit, where they are forbidden the plaid or the right to carry a man\u2019s weapons? Why should they not seize the chance of reclaiming the notion of manhood\u2014even should it mean they wear the tartan and carry a sword in the service of a German usurper?</p><p>I think sometimes this is the worst of it; not only that murder and injustice have been loosed unchecked upon us, without hope of cure or recourse\u2014but that our young men, our hope and future, should be thus piped away, squandered for the profit of the conqueror, and paid in the small coin of their pride.</p><p>Jamie looked up at me, one brow raised.</p><p>\u201cYe wouldna think to look at him that Ian had such poesy in him, aye?\u201d</p><p>There was a break in the text here. When it resumed, toward the bottom of the page, the writing, which had sprawled above into an angry scrawl with frequent blots and scratches, was once more controlled and tidy.</p><p>I must beg pardon for the passion of my words. I had not meant to say so much, but the temptation to open my heart to you as I always have is overwhelming. These are things I would not say to Jenny, though I imagine she knows them.</p><p>To the point, then; I grow garrulous. Young Jamie and Michael are well enough for the present\u2014at least we have no fear that either of them will be tempted by a soldier\u2019s life.</p><p>The same is not true of Ian; you know the lad, and his spirit of adventure, so similar to your own. There is no real work for him here, yet he has not the mind of a scholar or a head for business. How shall he fare, in a world where he must choose between beggary and the profession of war? For there is little else.</p><p>We would have him stay with you, if you will have him. It may be that there is a greater opportunity in the New World for him than might be found here. Even if this should not be so, his mother will at least be spared the sight of her son marching away with his regiment.</p><p>I could ask no better Guardian or example for him than Yourself. I know I ask a great Favour of you in this Matter. Still, I hope the situation will not be entirely without benefit to you, beyond the presumed Great Pleasure of Ian\u2019s company.</p><p>\u201cNot only a poet, but an ironist, too,\u201d Jamie observed, with another glance at the boys on the lawn.</p><p>Here there was another break in the text, before the writing resumed, this time with a freshly sharpened quill, the words written carefully, reflecting the thought behind them.</p><p>I had left off writing, Brother, wishing my thoughts to be clear and unmazed by weariness before addressing this concern. I have in fact taken up my pen and put it down a dozen times, unsure whether to speak at all\u2014I fear to offend you, in the same breath I ask your favour. And yet I must speak.</p><p>I wrote of Simon Fraser, earlier. He is a man of honour, though his father\u2019s son\u2014but he is a bloody man. I have known him since all of us were lads (sometimes that seems but yesterday; and then again, a gulf of years), and there is a hardness in him now, a glimpse of steel at the back of his eyes, that was not there before Culloden.</p><p>What troubles me\u2014and the knowledge you bear of my love toward you is all that emboldens me to say this\u2014is that I have seen that steel in your own eyes, Brother.</p><p>I know too well the sights that freeze a man\u2019s heart, to harden his eyes in that fashion. I trust that you will forgive my frankness, but I have feared for your soul, many times since Culloden.</p><p>I have not spoken of the matter to Jenny, but she has seen it, too. She is a woman, forbye, and will know you in ways I cannot. It will be that fear, I think, that caused her to throw Laoghaire at your head. I did think the match ill-made, but (here a large, deliberate blotch obscured several lines). You are fortunate in Claire.</p><p>\u201cMmphm,\u201d Jamie said at this, giving me an eye. I squeezed his shoulder, and leaned forward to read the rest.</p><p>It is late, and I ramble. I spoke of Simon\u2014care for his men is now his sole link with humanity. He has neither wife nor child, he lives without root or hearth, his patrimony hostage to the conqueror he serves. There is a burning fire in such a man, but no heart. I hope never to say the same of you\u2014or of Young Ian. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Thus I give you to each other, and may God\u2019s blessing\u2014and mine\u2014be with you both.</p><p>Write as soon as you may. We hunger for News of you, and for your accounts of the exotic precincts in which you now Abide.</p><p>Your Most Affectionate Brother,</p><p>Ian Murray</p> <p>Jamie carefully folded the letter, and put it into his coat.</p><p>\u201cMmphm,\u201d he said.</p><p>11</p><p>THE LAW OF BLOODSHED</p><p>July 1767</p> <p>I became gradually accustomed to the rhythm of life at River Run. The presence of the slaves disturbed me, but there was little I could do about that, save to call upon their services as little as I could, fetching and carrying for myself whenever possible.</p><p>River Run boasted a \u201csimples\u201d room, essentially a small closet in which dried herbs and medicines were kept. There was not much there\u2014no more than a few jars of dandelion root and willow bark, and a few patent poultices, dusty from disuse. Jocasta professed herself delighted that I should want to use the space\u2014she had herself no talent for medicinals, she said with a shrug, nor had any of the slaves.</p><p>\u201cThere is a new woman who may show some skill in that direction,\u201d she said, long fingers drawing out the line of wool from the spindle as the spinning wheel whirred round.</p><p>\u201cShe is not a house slave, though; she was fresh come from Africa only a few months past, and has neither speech nor manners. I had thought to train her, perhaps, but since you are here...ah, now the thread\u2019s grown too thin, d\u2019ye see?\u201d</p><p>While I spent some time each day chatting with Jocasta and attempting to learn from her the art of spinning wool, Jamie spent an hour or two with the butler, Ulysses, who in addition to serving as Jocasta\u2019s eyes and as major domo of the house, had evidently also been managing the accounts of the plantation since Hector Cameron\u2019s death.</p><p>\u201cAnd doing a fair job of it, too,\u201d Jamie told me privately, after one such session. \u201cIf he were a white man, my aunt would have no difficulty in handling her affairs. As it is, though\u2014\u201d He shrugged.</p> <p>\u201cAs it is, it\u2019s lucky for her that you\u2019re here,\u201d I said, leaning close to sniff at him. He had spent the day in Cross Creek, arranging a complicated exchange involving indigo blocks, lumber, three pairs of mules, five tons of rice, and a warehouse receipt for a gilded clock, and as a result, a fascinating variety of scents clung to his coat and hair.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the least I can do,\u201d he said, his eyes on the boots he was brushing. His lips tightened briefly. \u201cNot as though I were otherwise occupied, is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA dinner party,\u201d Jocasta declared, a few days later. \u201cI must have a proper festival, to introduce the two of ye to the folk of the county.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no need of it, Aunt,\u201d Jamie said mildly, looking up from his book. \u201cI think I shall have met most of the county at the stock-buying last week. Or the masculine part of it, at least,\u201d he added, smiling at me. \u201cCome to think on it, though, perhaps it would suit Claire to be acquainted wi\u2019 the ladies of the district.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t mind knowing a few more people,\u201d I admitted. \u201cNot that I don\u2019t find ample occupation here,\u201d I assured Jocasta, \u201cbut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut not of a sort that interests you,\u201d she answered, though with enough of a smile to take the sting out of the remark. \u201cYe\u2019ve no great fondness for needlework, I think.\u201d Her hand went to the big basket of colored wools and plucked out a ball of green, to be attached to the shawl she was knitting.</p><p>The balls of wool were carefully arranged each morning by one of the maids, in a spiral spectrum, so that by counting, Jocasta could pick up a ball of the right color.</p><p>\u201cAye, well, not that sort of needlework,\u201d Jamie put in, closing his book and smiling at me. \u201cIt\u2019s more the stitching of severed flesh that appeals to Claire. I expect she\u2019ll be getting restless these days, wi\u2019 no more than a cracked head or a case of piles to be dealing with.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHa ha,\u201d I said tartly, but in fact he was quite right. While I was pleased to find that the inhabitants of River Run were on the whole healthy and well nourished, there was not a great deal of scope for a physician. While I certainly wished no ill to anyone, there was no denying that I was getting restless. So was Jamie, but I thought that was a matter better left unremarked for the moment.</p><p>\u201cI do hope Marsali\u2019s quite well,\u201d I said, changing the subject. Convinced at last that Jamie would not require his aid for a little while, Fergus had left the day before, bound downriver for Wilmington, thence to take ship for Jamaica. If all went well, he would return in the springtime with Marsali and\u2014God willing\u2014their new child.</p><p>\u201cSo do I,\u201d said Jamie. \u201cI told Fergus that\u2014\u201d</p><p>Jocasta turned her head sharply toward the door.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it, Ulysses?\u201d</p><p>Absorbed by the conversation, I hadn\u2019t noticed footsteps in the hallway. Not for the first time, I was struck by the acuteness of Jocasta\u2019s hearing.</p><p>\u201cMr. Farquard Campbell,\u201d the butler said quietly, and stood back against the wall.</p><p>It was an indication of Farquard Campbell\u2019s familiarity with the house-hold, I thought, that he should not have waited for Ulysses to return with an invitation for him to enter. He came into the drawing room on the butler\u2019s heels, hat carelessly thrust beneath one arm.</p><p>\u201cJo, Mrs. Fraser,\u201d he said with a quick bow to Jocasta and me, and \u201cYour servant, sir,\u201d to Jamie. Mr. Campbell had been riding, and riding hard; the skirts of his coat were thick with dust, and sweat streamed down his face beneath a wig crammed on askew.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it, Farquard? Has something happened?\u201d Jocasta sat forward on the edge of her chair, her face reflecting his obvious anxiety.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he said abruptly. \u201cAn accident at the sawmill. I\u2019ve come to ask Mrs. Fraser\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, of course. Let me get my box. Ulysses, will you have someone fetch a horse?\u201d I rose hastily, searching for the slippers I had kicked off. I wasn\u2019t dressed for riding, but from Campbell\u2019s look, there wasn\u2019t time to change. \u201cIs it serious?\u201d</p><p>He put out a hand to stop me, as I stooped to pull my slippers on.</p><p>\u201cAye, bad enough. But you needn\u2019t come, Mrs. Fraser. If your husband might fetch along some of your medicines and such, though\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I\u2019ll come,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d He spoke abruptly, and we all stared at him. His eyes sought Jamie\u2019s, and he grimaced, lips tight.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a matter for the ladies,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I should be most grateful for your company, Mr. Fraser.\u201d</p><p>Jocasta was on her feet before I could protest, gripping Campbell\u2019s arm.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d she said sharply. \u201cIs it one of my Negroes? Has Byrnes done something?\u201d</p><p>She was taller than he by an inch or two; he had to look up to answer her. I could see the lines of strain in his face, and she plainly sensed it as well; her fingers tightened on the gray serge of his coat sleeve.</p><p>He glanced at Ulysses, then back at Jocasta. As though he had received a direct order, the butler turned and left the room, soft-footed as ever.</p><p>\u201cIt is a matter of bloodshed, Jo,\u201d he said to her quietly. \u201cI do not know who, nor how, nor even how bad the injury may be. MacNeill\u2019s boy came for me. But for the other\u2014\u201d He hesitated, then shrugged. \u201cIt is the law.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re a judge!\u201d she burst out. \u201cFor God\u2019s sake, can you not do something?\u201d Her head moved jerkily, blind eyes trying to fix him, bend him to her will.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d he said sharply, and then, more gently, repeated, \u201cNo.\u201d He lifted her hand from his sleeve and held it tightly.</p><p>\u201cYou know I cannot,\u201d he said. \u201cIf I could...\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you could, you would not,\u201d she said bitterly. She pulled her hand out of his grasp and stood back, fists clenched at her sides. \u201cGo on, then. They\u2019ve called ye to be judge; go and give them their judgment.\u201d She whirled on her heel and left the room, her skirts rustling with angry futility.</p><p>He stared after her, then, as the sound of a slammed door came from down the passage, blew out his breath with a wry grimace and turned to Jamie.</p><p>\u201cI hesitate to request such a favor of you, Mr. Fraser, upon such short acquaintance as we have had. But I would greatly appreciate your accompanying me upon my errand. Since Mrs. Cameron herself cannot be present, to have you there as her representative in the matter\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is this matter, Mr. Campbell?\u201d Jamie interrupted.</p><p>Campbell glanced at me, plainly wishing me to leave. Since I made no move to do so, he shrugged, and pulling a handkerchief from his pocket, wiped his face.</p><p>\u201cIt is the law of this colony, sir, that if a Negro shall assault a white person and in so doing, cause blood to be shed, then he shall die for his crime.\u201d He paused, reluctant. \u201cSuch occurrences are most thankfully rare. But when they occur\u2014\u201d</p><p>He stopped, lips pressed together. Then he sighed, and with a final pat of his flushed cheeks, put the handkerchief away.</p><p>\u201cI must go. Will you come, Mr. Fraser?\u201d</p><p>Jamie stood for a moment longer, his eyes searching Campbell\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cI will,\u201d he said abruptly. He went to the sideboard and pulled open the upper drawer, where the late Hector Cameron\u2019s dueling pistols were kept.</p><p>Seeing this, I turned to Campbell.</p><p>\u201cIs there some danger?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI cannot say, Mrs. Fraser.\u201d Campbell hunched his shoulders, \u201cDonald MacNeill told me only that there had been an altercation of some kind at the sawmill, and that it was a matter of the law of bloodshed. He asked me to come at once to render judgment and oversee the execution, and then left to summon the other estate owners before I could obtain any particulars.\u201d</p><p>He looked unhappy, but resigned.</p><p>\u201cExecution? Do you mean to say you intend to execute a man without even knowing what he\u2019s done?\u201d In my agitation, I had knocked Jocasta\u2019s basket of yarn over. Little balls of colored wool ran everywhere, bouncing on the carpet.</p><p>\u201cI do know what he\u2019s done, Mrs. Fraser!\u201d Campbell lifted his chin, his color high, but with an obvious effort, swallowed his impatience.</p><p>\u201cYour pardon, ma\u2019am. I know you are newly come here; you will find some of our ways difficult and even barbarous, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo right I find them barbarous! What kind of law is it that condemns a man\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cA slave\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cA man! Condemns him without a trial, without even an investigation?

His eyes held mine, and kept me from speaking.</p><p>\u201cI am already part of it,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cIt is my aunt\u2019s property, her men involved. Mr. Campbell is right; I am her kinsman. It will be my duty to go\u2014to see, at least. To be there.\u201d He hesitated then, as though he might say more, but instead merely squeezed my hand again and let me go.</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019m going with you.\u201d I spoke quite calmly, with that eerie sense of detachment that comes with awareness of impending disaster.</p><p>His wide mouth twitched briefly.</p> <p>\u201cI did expect ye would, Sassenach. Go and fetch your wee box, aye? I\u2019ll have the horses brought round.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t wait to hear Mr. Campbell\u2019s expostulations, but fled toward the stillroom, my slippers pattering on the tiles like the beat of an anxious heart.</p><p>We met Andrew MacNeill on the road, resting his horse in the shade of a chestnut tree. He had been waiting for us; he stepped out of the shadows at the sound of our hoofbeats. He nodded to Campbell as we halted by him, but his eyes were on me, frowning.</p><p>\u201cDid you not tell him, Campbell?\u201d he said, and turned the frown on Jamie. \u201cIt will be no affair for a woman, Mr. Fraser.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYe called it a matter of bloodshed, did ye no?\u201d Jamie said, a marked edge in his voice. \u201cMy wife is ban-lighiche; she has seen war wi\u2019 me, and more. If ye wish me there, she will go with me.\u201d</p> <p>MacNeill\u2019s lips pressed tight together, but he didn\u2019t argue further. He turned abruptly and swung into his saddle.</p><p>\u201cAcquaint us, MacNeill, with the history of this unfortunate affair.\u201d Campbell urged his mare\u2019s nose past the withers of Jamie\u2019s horse, skillfully edging between MacNeill and Jamie. \u201cMr. Fraser is newly come, as you know, and your lad said only to me that it was bloodshed. I have no particulars.\u201d</p><p>MacNeill\u2019s burly shoulders rose slightly, shrugging toward the iron-gray pigtail that bisected his collar. His hat was jammed down on his head, set square with the shoulders, as though he had used a carpenter\u2019s level to even it. A square, blunt man, MacNeill, in words as well as appearance.</p><p>Told in brief bursts as we trotted, it was a simple story. The sawmill\u2019s overseer, Byrnes, had had an altercation with one of the turpentine slaves. This man, being armed with the large slash-knife appropriate to his occupation, had attempted to settle the matter by removing Byrnes\u2019 head. Missing his aim, he had succeeded only in depriving the overseer of an ear.</p><p>\u201cBarked him like a pine tree,\u201d MacNeill said, a certain grim satisfaction apparent in his voice. \u201cTook his lug and a wee bit o\u2019 the side of his face, as well. Not that it will ha\u2019 impaired his beauty ower-much, the ugly wee pusbag.\u201d</p><p>I glanced toward Jamie, who lifted one eyebrow in response. Evidently Byrnes was no favorite with the local planters.</p> <p>The overseer had shrieked for help, and with the assistance of two customers and several of their slaves, had succeeded in subduing his assailant. The wound stanched and the slave locked in a shed, young Donald MacNeill\u2014who had come to have a saw blade set and found himself unexpectedly in the midst of drama\u2014had been dispatched at once to spread the word to the plantation owners nearby.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll not know,\u201d Campbell explained, twisting in his saddle to speak to Jamie. \u201cWhen a slave must be executed, the slaves from those plantations nearby are brought to watch; a deterrent, aye? against future ill-considered action.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIndeed,\u201d Jamie said politely. \u201cI believe that was the Crown\u2019s notion in executing my grandsire on Tower Hill after the Rising. Verra effective, too; all my relations have been quite well behaved since.\u201d</p><p>I had lived long enough among Scots to appreciate the effects of that little jab. Jamie might have come at Campbell\u2019s request, but the grandson of the Old Fox did no man\u2019s bidding lightly\u2014nor necessarily held English law in high regard.</p><p>MacNeill had got the message, all right; the back of his neck flushed turkey-red, but Farquard Campbell looked amused. He uttered a short, dry laugh before turning round.</p><p>\u201cWhich slave is it, d\u2019ye know?\u201d he asked the older man. MacNeill shook his head.</p><p>\u201cYoung Donald didna say. But ye ken as well as I do; it\u2019ll be that bugger Rufus.\u201d</p><p>Campbell\u2019s shoulders slumped in acknowledgment.</p> <p>\u201cJo will be sore pained to hear it,\u201d he murmured, shaking his head regretfully.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s her ain fault,\u201d MacNeill said, brutally thwacking a horsefly that had settled on his leg above the boot. \u201cYon Byrnes isna fit to mind pigs, let alone run Negroes. I\u2019ve told her often enough; so\u2019ve you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, but Hector hired the man, not Jo,\u201d Campbell protested mildly. \u201cAnd she couldna well dismiss him out of hand. What\u2019s she to do, then, come and manage the place herself?\u201d</p><p>The answer was a grunt as MacNeill shifted his broad buttocks in the saddle. I glanced at Jamie, and found him poker-faced, eyes hidden in the shadow under the brim of his hat.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s little worse than a willful woman,\u201d MacNeill said, a trifle louder than strictly necessary. \u201cThey\u2019ve none to blame save themselves if harm comes to them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhereas,\u201d I chipped in, leaning forward and raising my own voice enough to be heard over the clop and creak of the horses, \u201cif harm comes to them because of some man, the satisfaction of blaming him will be adequate compensation?\u201d</p><p>Jamie snorted briefly with amusement; Campbell cackled out loud and poked MacNeill in the ribs with his crop.</p><p>\u201cGot ye there, Andrew!\u201d he said.</p><p>MacNeill did not reply, but his neck grew even redder. We rode in silence after that, MacNeill\u2019s shoulders hunched just under his ears.</p><p>While mildly satisfying, this exchange did nothing to settle my nerves; my stomach was knotted in dread of what might happen when we reached the mill. Despite their dislike of Byrnes and the obvious assumption that whatever had happened had likely been the overseer\u2019s fault, there wasn\u2019t the slightest suggestion that this would alter the slave\u2019s fate in any way.</p><p>\u201cA bad law,\u201d Campbell had called it\u2014but the law nonetheless. Still, it was neither outrage nor horror at the thought of judicial atrocity that made my hands tremble and the leather reins slick with sweat; it was wondering what Jamie would do.</p><p>I could tell nothing from his face. He rode relaxed, left hand on the reins, the right curled loosely on his thigh, near the bulge of the pistol in his coat.</p><p>I was not even sure whether I could take comfort in the fact that he had allowed me to come with him. That might mean that he didn\u2019t expect to commit violence\u2014but in that case, did it mean he would stand by and let the execution happen?</p><p>And if he did...? My mouth was dry, my nose and throat choked with the soft brown dust that rose in clouds from the horses\u2019 hooves.</p><p>I am already part of it. Part of what, though? Of clan and family, yes\u2014but of this? Highlanders would fight to the death for any cause that touched their honor or stirred their blood, but they were for the most part indifferent to outside matters. Centuries of isolation in their mountain fastnesses had left them disinclined to meddle in the affairs of others\u2014but woe to any who meddled in theirs!</p><p>Plainly Campbell and MacNeill saw this as Jamie\u2019s affair\u2014but did he? Jamie was not an isolated Highlander, I assured myself. He was well traveled, well educated, a cultured man. And he knew damn well what I thought of present matters. I had the terrible feeling, though, that my opinion would count for very little in the reckoning of this day.</p><p>It was a hot and windless afternoon, with cicadas buzzing loudly in the weeds along the road, but my fingers were cold, and stiff on the reins. We had passed one or two other parties; small groups of slaves, moving on foot in the direction of the sawmill. They didn\u2019t look up as we passed, but melted aside into the bushes, making room as we cantered past.</p><p>Jamie\u2019s hat flew off, knocked by a low branch; he caught it deftly and clapped it back on his head, but not before I had caught a glimpse of his face, unguarded for a moment, the lines of it tense with anxiety. With a small shock, it occurred to me that he didn\u2019t know what he was going to do either. And that frightened me more than anything else so far.</p><p>We were suddenly in the pine forest; the yellow-green flicker of hickory and alder leaves gave way abruptly to the darker light of cool deep green, like moving from the surface of the ocean into the calmer depths.</p><p>I reached back to touch the wooden case strapped on behind my saddle, trying to avoid thinking of what might lie ahead, by making mental preparations for the only role I might reasonably play in this incipient disaster. I likely could not prevent damage; but I could try to repair what had happened already. Disinfection and cleansing\u2014I had a bottle of distilled alcohol, and a wash made from pressed garlic juice and mint. Then dress the wound\u2014yes, I had linen bandages\u2014but surely it would need stitching first?</p><p>In the midst of wondering what had been done with Byrnes\u2019 detached ear, I stopped. The buzzing in my own ears was not from cicadas. Campbell, in the lead, reined up sharply, listening, and the rest of us halted behind him.</p><p>Voices in the distance, lots of voices, in a deep, angry buzz, like a hive of bees turned upside down and shaken. Then there was the faint sound of shouts and screams, and the sudden loud report of a shot.</p><p>We galloped down the last slope, dodging trees, and thundered into the sawmill\u2019s clearing. The open ground was filled with people; slaves and bondsmen, women and children, milling in panic through the stacks of sawn lumber, like termites exposed by the swing of an ax.</p><p>Then I lost all consciousness of the crowd. All my attention was fixed at the side of the mill, where a crane hoist was rigged, with a huge curved hook for raising logs to the level of the saw bed.</p><p>Impaled on the hook was the body of a black man, twisting in horrid imitation of a worm. The smell of blood struck sweet and hot through the air; there was a pool of it on the platform below the hoist.</p><p>My horse stopped, fidgeting, obstructed by the crowd. The shouts had died away into moans and small, disconnected screams from women in the crowd. I saw Jamie slide off in front of me, and force his way through the press of bodies toward the platform. Campbell and MacNeill were with him, shoving grimly through the mob. MacNeill\u2019s hat fell off, unregarded, to be trampled underfoot.</p><p>I sat frozen in my saddle, unable to move. There were other men on the platform near the hoist; a small man whose head was wound grotesquely round with bandages, splotched with blood all down one side; several other men, white and mulatto, armed with clubs and muskets, making occasional threatening jabs at the crowd.</p><p>Not that there seemed any urge to rush the platform; to the contrary, there seemed a general urge to get away. The faces around me were stamped with expressions ranging from fear to shocked dismay, with only here and there a flash of anger\u2014or satisfaction.</p><p>Farquard Campbell emerged from the press, boosted onto the platform by MacNeill\u2019s sturdy shoulder, and advanced at once on the men with clubs, waving his arms and shouting something I couldn\u2019t hear, though the screams and moans around me were dying away into the silence of shock. Jamie seized the edge of the platform and lifted himself up after Campbell, pausing to give a hand to MacNeill. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Campbell was face-to-face with Byrnes, his lean cheeks convulsed with fury.</p><p>\u201c...unspeakable brutality!\u201d he was shouting. His words came unevenly, half swallowed in the shuffle and murmur around me, but I saw him jab a finger emphatically at the hoist and its grisly burden. The slave had stopped struggling; he hung inert.</p><p>The overseer\u2019s face was invisible, but his body was stiff with outrage and defiance. One or two of his friends moved slowly toward him, plainly meaning to offer support.</p><p>I saw Jamie stand for a moment, assessing events. He drew both pistols from his coat, and coolly checked the priming. Then he stepped forward, and clapped one to Byrnes\u2019 bandaged head. The overseer went rigid with surprise.</p> <p>\u201cBring him down,\u201d Jamie said to the nearest thug, loudly enough to be audible over the dying grumbles of the crowd. \u201cOr I blow off what\u2019s left o\u2019 your friend\u2019s face. And then\u2014\u201d He raised the second pistol and aimed it squarely at the man\u2019s chest. The expression on Jamie\u2019s own face made further threats unnecessary.</p><p>The man moved reluctantly, narrowed eyes fixed on the pistol. He took hold of the brake-handle of the winch that controlled the hoist, and pulled it back. The hook descended slowly, its cable taut with the strain of its burden. There was a massive sigh from the spectators as the limp body touched the earth.</p><p>I had managed to urge my horse forward through the crowd, till I was within a foot or two of the end of the platform. The horse shied and stamped, tossing his head and snorting at the strong smell of blood, but was well trained enough not to bolt. I slid off, ordering a man nearby to bring my box.</p><p>The boards of the platform felt strange underfoot, heaving like the dry land does when one steps off a ship. It was no more than a few steps to where the slave lay; by the time I reached him, that cold clarity of mind that is the surgeon\u2019s chief resource had come upon me. I paid no heed to the heated arguments behind me, or to the presence of the remaining spectators.</p><p>He was alive; his chest moved in small, jerky gasps. The hook had pierced the stomach, passing through the lower rib cage, emerging from the back at about the level of the kidneys. The man\u2019s skin was an unearthly shade of dark blue-gray, his lips blanched to the color of clay.</p> <p>\u201cHush,\u201d I said softly, though there was no sound from the slave save the small hiss of his breath. His eyes were pools of incomprehension, pupils dilated, swamped with darkness.</p><p>There was no blood from his mouth; the lungs were not punctured. The breathing was shallow, but rhythmic; the diaphragm had not been pierced. My hands moved gently over him, my mind trying to follow the path of the damage. Blood oozed from both wounds, flowed in a black slick over the ridged muscles of back and stomach, shone red as rubies on the polished steel. No spurting; they had somehow missed both abdominal aorta and the renal artery.</p><p>Behind me, a heated argument had broken out; some small, detached portion of my mind noted that Byrnes\u2019 companions were his fellow overseers from two neighboring plantations, presently being rebuked with vigor by Farquard Campbell.</p><p>\u201c...blatant disregard of the law! You shall answer for it in court, gentlemen, be assured that you shall!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does it matter?\u201d came a sullen rumble from someone. \u201cIt\u2019s bloodshed\u2014and mutilation! Byrnes has his rights!\u201d</p><p>\u201cRights no for the likes of you to decide.\u201d MacNeill\u2019s deep growl joined in. \u201cRabble, that\u2019s what ye are, no better than the\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd where d\u2019you get off, old man, stickin\u2019 your long Scotch nose in where it\u2019s not wanted, eh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat will ye need, Sassenach?\u201d</p><p>I hadn\u2019t heard him come up beside me, but he was there. Jamie crouched next to me, my box open on the boards beside him. He held a loaded pistol still in one hand, his attention mostly on the group behind me.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d I said. I could hear the argument going on in the background, but the words blurred into meaninglessness. The only reality was under my hands.</p><p>It was slowly dawning on me that the man I touched was possibly not fatally wounded, in spite of his horrible injury. From everything I could sense and feel, I thought that the curve of the hook had gone upward through the liver. Likely the right kidney was damaged, and the jejunum or gallbladder might be nicked\u2014but none of those would kill him immediately.</p><p>It was shock that might do for him, if he was to die quickly. But I could see a pulse throbbing in the sweat-slick abdomen, just above the piercing steel. It was fast, but steady as a drumbeat; I could feel it echo in the tips of my fingers when I placed a hand on it. He had lost blood\u2014the scent of it was thick, overpowering the smell of sweat and fear\u2014but not so much as to doom him.</p><p>An unsettling thought came to me\u2014I might be able to keep this man alive. Likely not; in the wake of the thought came a flood of all the things that could go wrong\u2014hemorrhage when I removed the hook being only the most immediate. Internal bleeding, delayed shock, perforated intestine, peritonitis\u2014and yet.</p><p>At Prestonpans, I had seen a man pierced through the body with a sword, the location of the wound very much like this. He had received no treatment beyond a bandage wrapped around his body\u2014and yet he had recovered.</p> <p>\u201cLawlessness!\u201d Campbell was saying, his voice rising over the babble of argument. \u201cIt cannot be tolerated, no matter the provocation. I shall have you all taken in charge, be sure of it!\u201d</p><p>No one was paying any attention to the true object of the discussion. Only seconds had passed\u2014but I had only seconds more to act. I placed a hand on Jamie\u2019s arm, pulling his attention away from the debate.</p><p>\u201cIf I save him, will they let him live?\u201d I asked him, under my breath.</p><p>His eyes flicked from one to another of the men behind me, weighing the possibilities.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said softly. His eyes met mine, dark with understanding. His shoulders straightened slightly, and he laid the pistol across his thigh. I could not help him make his choice; he could not help with mine\u2014but he would defend me, whichever choice I made.</p><p>\u201cGive me the third bottle from the left, top row,\u201d I said, with a nod at the lid of the box, where three rows of clear glass bottles, firmly corked, held a variety of medicines.</p><p>I had two bottles of pure alcohol, another of brandy. I poured a good dose of the brownish powdered root into the brandy, and shook it briskly, then crawled to the man\u2019s head and pressed it to his lips.</p><p>His eyes were glazed; I tried to look into them, to make him see me. Why? I wondered, even as I leaned close and called his name. I couldn\u2019t ask if this would be his choice\u2014I had made it for him. And having made it, could not ask for either approval or forgiveness.</p><p>He swallowed. Once. Twice. The muscles near his blanched mouth quivered; drops of brandy ran across his skin. Once more a deep convulsive gulp, and then his straining neck relaxed, his head heavy on my arm.</p><p>I sat with my eyes closed, supporting his head, my fingers on the pulse under his ear. It jumped; skipped a beat and resumed. A shiver ran over his body, the blotched skin twitching as though a thousand ants ran over it.</p><p>The textbook description ran through my mind:</p><p>Numbness. Tingling. A sensation of the skin crawling, as though affected by insects. Nausea, epigastric pain. Labored breathing, skin cold and clammy, features bloodless. Pulse feeble and irregular, yet the mind remains clear.</p><p>None of the visible symptoms were discernible from those he already showed. Epigastric pain, forsooth.</p><p>One-fiftieth grain will kill a sparrow in a few seconds. One-tenth grain, a rabbit in five minutes. Aconite was said to be the poison in the cup Medea prepared for Theseus.</p><p>I tried to hear nothing, feel nothing, know nothing but the jerky beat beneath my fingers. I tried with all my might to shut out the voices overhead, the murmur nearby, the heat and dust and stink of blood, to forget where I was, and what I was doing.</p><p>Yet the mind remains clear.</p><p>Oh, God, I thought. It did.</p><p>12</p><p>THE RETURN OF JOHN QUINCY MYERS</p><p>Deeply shaken by the events at the sawmill, Jocasta nonetheless declared her intention of carrying on with the party she had planned.</p><p>\u201cIt will distract our minds from the sadness,\u201d she said firmly. She turned to me, and reaching out, critically fingered the muslin cloth of my sleeve.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll call Phaedre to begin a new gown for ye,\u201d she said. \u201cThe girl\u2019s a fine sempstress.\u201d</p><p>I rather thought it would take more than a new gown and a dinner party to distract my mind, but I caught a warning glance from Jamie and shut my mouth hard to keep the words inside.</p><p>In the event, given the shortness of time and a lack of suitable fabric, Jocasta decided to have one of her gowns remade for me.</p><p>\u201cHow does it look, Phaedre?\u201d Jocasta frowned in my direction, as though she could summon vision by pure will. \u201cWill it do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo fine,\u201d the maid answered around a mouthful of pins. She thrust in three in quick succession, squinted at me, pinched up a fold of fabric at the waistline and stabbed in two more.</p><p>\u201cBe just fine,\u201d she elaborated, mouth now clear. \u201cShe shorter than you, Miss Jo, and a bit thinner in the waist. Some bigger in the bosom, though,\u201d Phadre added in an undertone, grinning at me.</p><p>\u201cYes, I know that.\u201d Jocasta spoke tartly, having caught the whisper. \u201cSlash the bodice; we can fill it with Valenciennes lace over a field of green silk\u2014take a scrap from that old dressing gown of my husband\u2019s; it will be the right color to complement this.\u201d She touched the sleeve, with its brilliant green striping. \u201cBand the slash with the green silk, too; it will show off her bosom.\u201d The long pale fingers indicated the line of alteration, drifting across the tops of my br**sts almost absentmindedly. The touch was cool, impersonal and barely felt, but I narrowly prevented myself jerking back.</p><p>\u201cYou have a most remarkable memory for color,\u201d I said, surprised and slightly unnerved.</p><p>\u201cOh, I remember this dress very well,\u201d she said. She touched the full sleeve lightly. \u201cA gentleman once told me I reminded him of Persephone in it; springtime incarnate, he said.\u201d A faint smile of memory lit her face, then was erased as she lifted her head toward me.</p><p>\u201cWhat color is your hair, my dear? I hadna thought to ask. You sound a bit blond, somehow, but I\u2019ve no notion whether that may be actually the case. Pray, do not tell me ye\u2019re black-haired and sallow!\u201d She smiled, but the joke sounded somehow like a command.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s more or less brown,\u201d I said, touching my hair self-consciously. \u201cFaded a bit, though; it\u2019s gone light in streaks.\u201d</p><p>She frowned at this, seeming to consider whether brown was quite suitable. Unable to settle the question for herself, she turned to the maid.</p><p>\u201cHow does she look, Phaedre?\u201d</p><p>The woman took a step back and squinted at me. I realized that she must\u2014as the other house servants were\u2014be in the habit of giving careful descriptions to her mistress. The dark eyes passed swiftly over me, pausing on my face for a long moment of assessment. She took two pins from her mouth before replying.</p><p>\u201cJust fine, Miss Jo,\u201d Phaedre said. She nodded once, slowly. \u201cJust fine,\u201d she said again. \u201cShe got white skin, white as skim milk; looks real fine with that bright green.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMm.

But she didn\u2019t touch me again.</p><p>I stood in the lower hall, smoothing the green-striped silk over my bosom. Phaedre\u2019s reputation as a sempstress was well founded; the dress fit like a glove, and the bold bands of emerald satin glowed against the paler shades of ivory and leaf.</p> <p>Proud of her own thick hair, Jocasta did not wear wigs, so there was fortunately no suggestion that I adopt one. Phaedre had tried to powder my hair with rice flour instead, an attempt I had firmly resisted. Inadequately concealing her opinion of my lack of fashionable instinct, she had settled for snaring the mass of curls in a white silk ribbon and pinning them high to the back of my head.</p><p>I wasn\u2019t sure quite why I had resisted the array of baubles with which she had tried to further bedizen me; perhaps it was mere dislike of fussiness. Or perhaps it was a more subtle objection to being made an object, to be adorned and displayed to Jocasta\u2019s purpose. At any rate, I had refused. I wore no ornament save my wedding ring, a small pair of pearl earbobs, and a green velvet ribbon round the stalk of my neck.</p><p>Ulysses came down the stairs above me, impeccable in his livery. I moved, and he turned his head, catching the flicker of my skirts.</p><p>His eyes widened in a look of frank appreciation as he saw me, and I looked down, smiling a bit, as one does when being admired. Then I heard him gasp and jerked my head up to see his eyes still wide, but now with fear; his hand so tight on the banister that the knuckles shone.</p><p>\u201cYour pardon, madame,\u201d he said, sounding strangled, and rushed down the stairs and past me, head down, leaving the door to the cookhouse breezeway swinging in his wake.</p><p>\u201cWhat on earth...?\u201d I said aloud, and then I remembered where\u2014and when\u2014we were.</p> <p>Alone for so long, in a house with a blind mistress and no master, he had grown careless. He had momentarily forgotten that most basic and essential protection\u2014the only true protection a slave had: the blank, bland face that hid all thoughts.</p><p>No wonder he had been terrorized when he realized what he had done. If it had been any woman other than myself to have intercepted that unguarded look...my hands grew cold and sweaty, and I swallowed, the remembered scent of blood and turpentine sharp in my throat.</p><p>But it had been me, I reminded myself, and no one else had seen. The butler might be afraid, but he was safe. I would behave as though nothing had happened\u2014nothing had\u2014and things would be...well, things would be what they were. The sound of footsteps on the gallery above interrupted my thoughts. I glanced upward, and gasped, all other thoughts driven at once from my mind.</p><p>A Highlander in full regalia is an impressive sight\u2014any Highlander, no matter how old, ill-favored, or crabbed in appearance. A tall, straight-bodied, and by no means ill-favored Highlander in the prime of his life is breathtaking.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t worn the kilt since Culloden, but his body had not forgotten the way of it.</p><p>\u201cOh!\u201d I said.</p><p>He saw me then, and white teeth flashed as he made me a leg, silver shoe-buckles gleaming. He straightened and turned on his heel to set his plaid swinging, then came down slowly, eyes fixed on my face.</p><p>For a moment, I saw him as he had looked the morning I married him. The sett of his tartan was nearly the same now as then; black check on a crimson ground, plaid caught at his shoulder with a silver brooch, dipping to the calf of a neat, stockinged leg.</p> <p>His linen was finer now, as was his coat; the dirk he wore at his waist had bands of gold across the haft. Duine uasal was what he looked, a man of worth.</p><p>But the bold face above the lace was the same, older now, but wiser with it\u2014yet the tilt of his shining head and the set of the wide, firm mouth, the slanted clear cat-eyes that looked into my own, were just the same. Here was a man who had always known his worth.</p><p>\u201cYour servant, ma\u2019am,\u201d he said. And then burst into a face-splitting smile as he descended the last few stairs.</p><p>\u201cYou look wonderful,\u201d I said, hardly able to swallow the lump in my throat.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s none so bad,\u201d he agreed, with no trace of false modesty. He arranged a fold over his shoulder with care. \u201cOf course, that\u2019s the advantage of a plaid\u2014there\u2019s no trouble about the fit of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Hector Cameron\u2019s?\u201d I felt ridiculously shy of touching him, garbed so splendidly. Instead, I touched the hilt of the dirk; it was topped with a small knurl of gold, roughly shaped like a bird in flight.</p><p>Jamie drew a deep breath.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s mine, now. Ulysses brought it to me\u2014with my aunt\u2019s compliments.\u201d I caught an odd undertone in his voice, and glanced up at him. Despite his obvious deep pleasure at wearing the kilt again, something was troubling him. I touched his hand.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>He gave me half a smile, but his brows were drawn together in concern.</p><p>\u201cI wouldna say anything\u2019s wrong, exactly. It\u2019s only\u2014\u201d</p><p>The sound of feet on the stairs interrupted him, and he drew me to one side, out of the way of a hurrying slave with a pile of linens. The house was humming with last-minute preparations; even now, I could hear the sound of wheels on the gravel at the back of the house, and savory smells floated through the air as platters were brought in at a gallop from the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cWe canna talk here,\u201d he muttered. \u201cSassenach, will ye stand ready at dinner? If I should signal to ye\u201d\u2014and he tugged at his earlobe\u2014\u201cwill ye make a diversion, right then? It doesna matter what\u2014spill wine, swoon away, stab your dinner partner with a fork\u2014\u201d He grinned at me, and I took heart from that; whatever was worrying him wasn\u2019t a matter of life and death, then.</p><p>\u201cI can do that,\u201d I assured him. \u201cBut what\u2014\u201d</p><p>A door opened onto the gallery above, and Jocasta\u2019s voice floated down, giving last-minute orders to Phaedre. Hearing it, Jamie stooped quickly and kissed me, then whirled away in a swirl of crimson plaid and silver shoebuckles, disappearing neatly between two slaves bringing trays of crystal goblets toward the drawing room. I stared after him in astonishment, barely getting out of the way in time to avoid being trampled by the servants.</p><p>\u201cIs that you, sweet Claire?\u201d Jocasta paused on the bottom step, head turned toward me, eyes trained just over my shoulder. She was quite uncanny.</p><p>\u201cIt is,\u201d I said, and touched her arm to let her know more precisely where I was.</p><p>\u201cI smelt the camphor from the dress,\u201d she said in answer to my unspoken question, tucking her hand in the crook of my elbow. \u201cI thought I heard Jamie\u2019s voice; is he nearby?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I said, quite truthfully, \u201cI believe he\u2019s gone out to greet the guests.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d Her hand tightened on my arm, and she sighed, somewhere between satisfaction and impatience. \u201cI am not one to lament what cannot be mended, but I swear I should give one of my eyes, could the sight of the other be restored long enough to see the lad in his plaidie this night!\u201d</p><p>She shook her head, dismissing it, and the diamonds in her ears flared with light. She wore dark blue silk, a foil to her shining white hair. The cloth was embroidered with dragonflies that seemed to dart among the folds as she moved under the lights of the wall sconces and candle-heavy chandeliers.</p><p>\u201cAh, well. Where is Ulysses?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere, madame.\u201d He had come back so quietly that I hadn\u2019t heard him, appearing on her other side.</p><p>\u201cCome then,\u201d she said, and took his arm. I didn\u2019t know if the order applied to him or me, but followed obediently in her shimmering wake, dodging to avoid two kitchen boys bearing in the centerpiece\u2014a whole roasted boar, tusked head intact and fiercely glaring, succulent backside gleaming fatly, ready for the knife. It smelled divine.</p><p>I smoothed my hair and prepared to meet Jocasta\u2019s guests, feeling rather as though I, too, were being presented on a silver platter, with an apple in my mouth.</p><p>The guest list would have read like the Who\u2019s Who of Cape Fear River gentry, had there been such a thing. Campbell, Maxwell, Buchanan, MacNeill, MacEachern...names from the Highlands, names from the Isles. MacNeill of Barra Meadows, MacLeod of Islay...many of the plantation names carried the flavor of their owners\u2019 origins, as did their speech; the high plastered ceiling echoed with the lilt of spoken Gaelic.</p><p>Several of the men came kilted, or with plaids wrapped over their coats and silk breeches, but I saw none as striking as Jamie\u2014who was conspicuous by his absence. I heard Jocasta murmur something to Ulysses; he summoned a small serving girl with a clap of his hands and sent her zooming off into the lanterned half-dark of the gardens, presumably in search of him.</p><p>Nearly as conspicuous were the few guests who were not Scots; a broad-shouldered, gently smiling Quaker by the picturesque name of Hermon Husband, a tall, rawboned gentleman named Hunter, and\u2014much to my surprise\u2014Phillip Wylie, immaculately suited, wigged and powdered.</p><p>\u201cSo we meet again, Mrs. Fraser,\u201d he remarked, holding on to my hand much longer than was socially correct. \u201cI confess that I am ravished with enchantment to behold you again!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d I said, rather rudely.</p><p>He grinned impudently.</p><p>\u201cI was brought by mine host, the noble and puissant Mr. MacNeill of Barra Meadows, from whom I have just purchased an excellent pair of grays. Speaking of which, wild horses would have proved insufficient to restrain me from attendance this evening, upon my hearing that this occasion is held in your honor.\u201d His eyes wandered slowly over me, with the detached air of a connoisseur appreciating some rare work of art.</p><p>\u201cMay I observe, ma\u2019am, how most becoming is that shade of green?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t suppose I can stop you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo say nothing of the effect of candlelight upon your skin. \u2018Thy neck is as a tower of ivory,\u2019 \u201d he quoted, drawing a thumb insinuatingly over my palm, \u201c \u2018thine eyes like the fishpools in Heshbon.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>\u201c \u2018Thy nose is as the tower of Lebanon, which looketh toward Damascus,\u2019 \u201d I said, with a pointed look at his aristocratically pronounced proboscis. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He burst out laughing, but didn\u2019t let go. I stole a glance at Jocasta, who stood only a few feet away; she seemed engrossed in conversation with a new arrival, but experience had taught me just how sharp her ears were.</p><p>\u201cHow old are you?\u201d I asked, narrowing my eyes at him and trying to retrieve my hand without unseemly struggle.</p><p>\u201cFive-and-twenty, ma\u2019am,\u201d he answered, rather surprised. He patted at the star-shaped patch near his mouth with a finger of his free hand. \u201cAm I looking indecently haggard?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I merely wished to be sure I was telling you the truth in informing you that I am old enough to be your mother!\u201d</p> <p>This news appeared not to distress him in the slightest. Instead he raised my hand to his lips and pressed them fervently upon it.</p><p>\u201cI am enchanted,\u201d he breathed. \u201cMay I call you Maman?\u201d</p><p>Ulysses stood behind Jocasta, dark eyes intent on the guests coming up the lighted walk from the river\u2014he leaned forward now and then to whisper in her ear. I removed my hand from Wylie\u2019s grasp by main force, and used it to tap the butler on the shoulder.</p><p>\u201cUlysses,\u201d I said, smiling charmingly at Wylie, \u201cwould you be so kind as to ensure that Mr. Wylie is seated near me at dinner?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIndeed, madame; I will attend to it,\u201d he assured me, and returned at once to his surveillance.</p> <p>Mr. Wylie bowed extravagantly, professing undying gratitude, and allowed himself to be propelled into the house by one of the footmen. I waved pleasantly after him, thinking how much I should enjoy sticking a fork into him, when the time came.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t tell whether it was the luck of the draw, or considerate planning, but I found myself between Mr. Wylie and the Quaker, Mr. Husband, with Mr. Hunter\u2014the other non-Gaelic speaker\u2014across the table from me. We formed a small island of English in the midst of a sea of swirling Scots.</p><p>Jamie had appeared at the last moment, and was now seated at the head of the table, with Jocasta at his right hand. For the dozenth time, I wondered what was going on. I kept a sharp eye on him, a clean fork by my plate, ready for action, but we had reached the third course with no untoward occurrence.</p><p>\u201cI am surprised to find a gentleman of your persuasion in attendance at such an occasion, Mr. Husband. Does not such frivolity offend you?\u201d Having failed to divert my attention to himself during the first two courses, Wylie now resorted to leaning across me, the action bringing his thigh casually into contact with mine.</p><p>Hermon Husband smiled. \u201cEven Quakers must eat, Friend Wylie. And I have had the honor to enjoy Mrs. Cameron\u2019s hospitality on many occasions; I should not think to refuse it now, only because she extends it to others.\u201d He switched his attention back to me, resuming our interrupted conversation.</p><p>\u201cThou asked of the Regulators, Mrs. Fraser?\u201d He nodded across the table. \u201cI should recommend thy questions to Mr. Hunter, for if the Regulators might be said to enjoy the benefits of leadership, it is to this gentleman that they look.\u201d</p> <p>Mr. Hunter bowed at the compliment. A tall, lantern-jawed individual, he was more plainly dressed than most of those in attendance, though not a Quaker. He and Mr. Husband were traveling together, both returning from Wilmington to their homes in the backcountry. With Governor Tryon\u2019s offer in mind, I wanted to find out whatever I could about matters in that area.</p><p>\u201cWe are but a loose assembly,\u201d he said modestly, putting down his wineglass. \u201cIn truth, I should be reluctant to claim any title whatever; it is only that I am fortunate enough to have a homestead so situated that it is a convenient meeting place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne hears that the Regulators are mere rabble.\u201d Wylie dabbed at his lips, careful not to dislodge his patch. \u201cLawless, and inclined to violence against the duly authorized deputies of the Crown.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIndeed we are not,\u201d Mr. Husband put in, still mildly. I was surprised to hear him claim association with the Regulators; perhaps the movement wasn\u2019t quite so violent and lawless as Wylie implied. \u201cWe seek only justice, and that is not a quantity that can be obtained by means of violence, for where violence enters in, justice must surely flee.\u201d</p><p>Wylie laughed, a surprisingly deep and masculine sound, given his foppery.</p><p>\u201cJustice apparently should flee! That is certainly the impression I was given by Mr. Justice Dodgson when I spoke with him last week. Or perhaps he was mistaken, sir, in his identification of the ruffians who invaded his chambers, knocked him down, and dragged him by the heels into the street?\u201d He smiled engagingly at Hunter, who flushed dark red beneath his weathered tan. His fingers tightened about the stem of his wineglass. I glanced hopefully at Jamie. No sign of a signal.</p><p>\u201cMr. Justice Dodgson,\u201d Hunter said precisely, \u201cis a userer, a thief, a disgrace to the profession of law, and\u2014\u201d</p><p>I had for some little time been hearing noises outside, but had put these down to some crisis in the cookhouse, which was separated from the main house by a breezeway. The noises became clearer now, though, and I caught a familiar voice that quite distracted me from Mr. Hunter\u2019s denunciations.</p> <p>\u201cDuncan!\u201d I half rose from my seat, and heads nearby turned inquiringly.</p><p>There was a sudden confusion of movement out on the terrace, with shadows jerking past the open French windows, and voices calling, arguing and exhorting.</p><p>Conversation in the dining room fell silent, and everyone looked to see what was happening. I saw Jamie push back his chair, but before he could rise, an apparition appeared in the doorway.</p><p>It was John Quincy Myers, the mountain man, who filled the open double door from top to bottom and side to side, resplendent in the same costume in which I had first met him. He leaned heavily upon the doorframe, surveying the assemblage through bloodshot eyes. His face was flushed, his breathing stertorous, and in one hand he held a long glass bottle.</p><p>His eyes lit upon me, and his face contorted into a fearful grimace of gratification.</p><p>\u201cTHERE ye are,\u201d he said, in tones of the deepest satisfaction. \u201cSaid sho. Duncan wudd\u2019n havit. Said yesh, Mishess Claire said gotter be drunk afore she cuts me. Sho I\u2019m drunk. Drunk\u2014\u201d He paused, swaying dangerously, and raised his bottle high. \u201cAs a SKUNK!\u201d he ended triumphantly. He took a step into the room, fell flat on his face, and didn\u2019t move.</p><p>Duncan appeared in the doorway, looking a good deal the worse for wear himself. His shirt was ripped, his coat hung off his shoulder, and he had the beginnings of what looked like a black eye.</p><p>He glanced down at the prostrate form at his feet, then looked apologetically at Jamie.</p><p>\u201cI did try to stop him, Mac Dubh.\u201d</p><p>I extricated myself from my seat, and reached the body at the same time as Jamie, followed by a tidal wave of curious guests. Jamie glanced at me, eyebrows raised.</p><p>\u201cWell, ye did say he must be unconscious,\u201d he observed. He bent over the mountain man and thumbed back an eyelid, showing a slice of blank white eyeball. \u201cI\u2019d say he\u2019s made a good job of it, myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but I didn\u2019t mean dead drunk!\u201d I squatted by the insensible form, and put a ginger two fingers over the carotid pulse. Nice and strong. Still...</p><p>\u201cAlcohol isn\u2019t a good anesthetic at all,\u201d I said, shaking my head. \u201cIt\u2019s a poison. It depresses the central nervous system. Put the shock of operating on top of alcohol intoxication, and it could kill him, easily.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo great loss,\u201d said someone among the guests, but this caustic opinion was drowned in a flood of reproachful shushing.</p><p>\u201cShame to waste so much brandy,\u201d someone else said, to general laughter. It was Phillip Wylie; I saw his powdered face loom over Jamie\u2019s shoulder, smiling wickedly.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve heard a great deal of your skill, Mistress Fraser. Now\u2019s your chance of proving yourself\u2014before witnesses!\u201d He waved a graceful hand at the crowd clustered round us.</p><p>\u201cOh, bugger off,\u201d I said crossly.</p><p>\u201cOoh, hear her!\u201d Someone murmured behind me, not without admiration. Wylie blinked, taken aback, but then grinned more broadly than ever.</p><p>\u201cYour wish is my command, ma\u2019am,\u201d he murmured, and bowed himself back into the crowd.</p><p>I stood up, racked with doubt. It might work. It was a technically simple operation, and shouldn\u2019t take more than a few minutes\u2014if I encountered no complications. It was a small incision\u2014but it did involve going into the peritoneum, with all the attendant risk of infection that implied.</p><p>Still, I was unlikely to encounter better conditions than I had here\u2014plenty of alcohol for disinfection, plenty of willing assistants. There was no other means of anesthesia available, and I could under no circumstances do it with a conscious patient. Above all, Myers had asked me to do it.</p><p>I sought Jamie\u2019s face, wanting advice. He was there, standing beside me, and saw the question in my eyes. Well, he\u2019d wanted a diversion, damn it.</p><p>\u201cBest do it, Sassenach.\u201d Jamie eyed the prostrate form. \u201cHe may ne\u2019er have either the courage or the money to get that drunk again.\u201d I stooped and checked his pulse again\u2014strong and steady as a carthorse.</p><p>Jocasta\u2019s stately head appeared among the curious faces looming over MacNeill\u2019s shoulder.</p><p>\u201cBring him into the salon,\u201d she said briefly. Her head withdrew, and the decision was made for me.</p><p>I had operated under odd conditions before, I thought, rinsing my hands hastily in vinegar brought from the kitchen, but none odder than this.</p><p>Relieved of his nether garb, Myers lay tastefully displayed on the mahogany table, boneless as a roasted pheasant, and nearly as ornamental. In lieu of platter, he lay upon a stable blanket, a gaudy centerpiece in his quilled shirt and bear\u2019s-claw necklace, surrounded by a garnish of bottles, rags, and bandages.</p><p>There was no time to change my own clothes; a leather butchering apron was fetched from the smoke shed to cover my dress, and Phaedre pinned up my long, frilled sleeves to leave my forearms bare.</p><p>Extra candles had been brought to give me light; candelabra blazed from sideboard and chandelier in a reckless expenditure of fragrant beeswax. Not nearly as fragrant as Myers, though; without hesitation, I took the decanter from the sideboard, and sloshed several shillings\u2019 worth of fine brandy over the curly dark-haired crotch.</p><p>\u201cExpensive way to kill lice,\u201d someone remarked critically behind me, observing the hasty exodus of miscellaneous small forms of life in the wake of the flood.</p><p>\u201cAh, but they\u2019ll die happy,\u201d said a voice I recognized as Ian\u2019s. \u201cI brought your wee box, Auntie.\u201d He set the surgical chest by my elbow, and opened it for me.</p><p>I snatched out my precious blue bottle of distilled alcohol, and the straight-edged scalpel. Holding the blade over a bowl, I poured alcohol over it, meanwhile scanning the crowd for appropriate assistants. There wouldn\u2019t be any shortage of volunteers; the spectators were boiling with suppressed laughter and murmured comment, interrupted dinner forgotten in a rush of anticipation.</p><p>Two sturdy carriage drivers were summoned from the kitchen to hold the patient\u2019s legs, Andrew MacNeill and Farquard Campbell volunteering to hold the arms, and Young Ian was set in place by my side, holding a large candlestick to cast additional light. Jamie took up his position as chief anesthetist by the patient\u2019s head, a glass full of whisky poised near the slack and snoring mouth. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I checked that my supplies and suture needles were ready, took a deep breath, and nodded to my troops.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>Myers\u2019s penis, embarrassed by the attention, had already retreated, peeping shyly out of the bushes. With the patient\u2019s long legs raised and spread, Ulysses himself delicately cupping the baggy scrotum away, the hernia was clearly revealed, a smooth swelling the size of a hen\u2019s egg, its curve a deep purple where it pressed against the taut inguinal skin.</p><p>\u201cJesus, Lord!\u201d said one of the drivers, eyes bulging at the sight. \u201cIt\u2019s true\u2014he\u2019s got three balls!\u201d</p> <p>A collective gasp and giggle ensued from the spectators, but I was too busy to correct misapprehensions. I swabbed the perineum thoroughly with pure alcohol, dipped my scalpel in the liquid, passed the blade back and forth through the flame of a candle by way of final sterilization, and made a swift cut.</p><p>Not large, not deep. Just enough to open the skin, and see the loop of gleaming pinkish-gray intestine bulging down through the tear in the muscle layer. Blood welled, a thin, dark line, then dribbled down staining the blanket.</p><p>I extended the incision, swished my fingers thoroughly in the disinfecting bowl, then put two fingers on the loop and pushed it gently upward. Myers moved in a sudden convulsion, nearly dislodging me, and just as suddenly relaxed. He tightened again, buttocks rising, and my assistants nearly lost their grip on his legs.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s waking up!\u201d I shouted to Jamie, above the various cries of alarm. \u201cGive him more, quick!\u201d All my doubts about the use of alcohol as an anesthetic were being borne out, but it was too late to change my mind now.</p><p>Jamie grasped the mountain man\u2019s jaw, and squeezing open his mouth, dribbled whisky into it. Myers choked and spluttered and made noises like a drowning buffalo, but enough of the alcohol made it down his throat\u2014the huge body relaxed. The mountain man subsided into mumbling immobility and then into long, wet, snuffling snores.</p> <p>I had managed to keep my fingers in place; there was more bleeding than I would have liked, but his struggles had not brought the herniated loop back down. I snatched a clean cloth soaked in brandy and blotted the site; yes, I could see the edge of the muscle layer; scrawny as Myers was, a thin layer of yellow fat lay under the skin, separating it from the dark red fibers below.</p><p>I could feel the movement of his intestines as he breathed, the dark wet warmth of his body surrounding my gloveless fingers in that strange one-sided intimacy that is the surgeon\u2019s realm. I closed my eyes and let all sense of urgency, all consciousness of the watching crowd drop away.</p><p>I breathed in slowly, matched my rhythm to the audible snores. Above the reek of brandy and the faintly nauseating aromas of food, I could smell the earthy odors of his body; stale sweat, grimed skin, a small tang of urine and the copper scent of blood. To another, they would have been offensive, but not to me, not now.</p><p>This body was. No good, no bad, it simply was. I knew it, now; it was mine.</p><p>They were all mine; the unconscious body in my hands, its secrets open to me; the men who held it, their eyes on me. It didn\u2019t always happen, but when it did, the sensation was unforgettable; a synthesis of minds into a single organism. And as I took control of this organism, I became part of it, and lost myself.</p><p>Time stopped. I was acutely aware of each movement, each breath, the tug and pull of the catgut sutures as I tightened the inguinal ring, but my hands did not belong to me. My voice was high and clear, giving directions instantly obeyed, and somewhere far away, a small watcher in my brain observed the progress of the operation with a remote sense of interest.</p> <p>Then it was done, and time began again. I took a step back, breaking the link, and feeling slightly dizzy at the unaccustomed solitude.</p><p>\u201cDone,\u201d I said, and the hum from the spectators erupted into loud applause. Still feeling intoxicated\u2014had I caught drunkenness by osmosis from Myers?\u2014 I turned on one heel and sank into an extravagant low curtsy, facing the dinner guests.</p><p>An hour later, I was drunk on my own merits, the victim of a dozen toasts in my honor. I managed to escape briefly, on the excuse of checking on my patient, and staggered upstairs to the guest room where he lay.</p><p>I paused on the gallery, clinging to the banister while I steadied myself. There was a loud hum of conversation and laughter from below; the party was still going strong, but had dissolved into small groups scattered over the parquet of the foyer and salon. From this perspective, it looked like a honey-comb, fuzzy wigged heads and gauze-winged dresses bobbing to and fro across the six-sided tiles, buzzing busily over glasses filled with the nectar of brandywine and porter.</p><p>If Jamie had wanted a diversion, I thought muzzily, he couldn\u2019t have asked for better. Whatever had been going to happen had been effectively forestalled. But what was it\u2014and for how long could it be prevented? I shook my head to clear it\u2014with indifferent results\u2014and went in to see my patient.</p><p>Myers was still blissfully and deeply asleep, breathing in long, slow exhalations that made the cotton bed-drapes quiver. The slave Betty nodded at me, smiling.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s fine, Mrs. Claire,\u201d she whispered. \u201cCouldn\u2019t wake that man with a gun, I don\u2019t think.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t need to check his heart; his head was turned, and I could see the huge vein that ran down the side of his neck, throbbing with a pulse slow and heavy as a hammer blow. I touched him, feeling his skin cool and damp. No fever, no signs of shock. The whole of his enormous person radiated peace and well-being.</p> <p>\u201cHow is he?\u201d Had I been less drunk, I would have been startled. As it was, I merely swayed round on my axis, to find Jamie standing behind me.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s fine,\u201d I said. \u201cYou couldn\u2019t kill him with a cannon. Like you,\u201d I said, and found myself leaning against him, arms around his waist, my flushed face buried in the cool folds of his linen. \u201cIndestructible.\u201d</p><p>He kissed the top of my head, smoothing back a few curls that had escaped from their dressing during the operation.</p><p>\u201cYe did well, Sassenach,\u201d he whispered. \u201cVerra well, bonnie lassie.\u201d</p><p>He smelt of wine and candlewax, of herbs and Highland wool. I slid my hands lower, feeling the curves of his buttocks, smooth and free under his kilt. He moved slightly, the length of his thigh pressing briefly against mine.</p><p>\u201cYe need a bit of air, Sassenach\u2014and we must talk. Can ye leave him for a time?\u201d</p><p>I glanced at the bed and its stertorous occupant.</p><p>\u201cYes. As long as Betty will keep sitting with him to be sure he doesn\u2019t vomit in his sleep and choke?\u201d I glanced at the slave, who looked surprised that I should ask, but nodded willingly.</p><p>\u201cMeet me by the herb garden\u2014and take care not to fall down the stairs and break your neck, aye?\u201d Lifting my chin, he kissed me quick and deep, and left me dizzy, feeling at once more sober and more drunk than before.</p><p>13</p><p>AN EXAMINATION OF CONSCIENCE</p><p>Something dark landed on the path in front of us with a soft plop! and I stopped abruptly, clutching his arm.</p><p>\u201cFrog,\u201d Jamie said, unperturbed. \u201cD\u2019ye hear them singing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSinging\u201d wasn\u2019t the word that would have struck me about the chorus of croaks and grunts from the reedbeds near the river. On the other hand, Jamie was tone deaf, and made no bones about it.</p><p>He extended the toe of his shoe and gently prodded the squat dark shape.</p><p>\u201c \u2018Brekekekex, ko-ax, ko-ax,\u2019 \u201d he quoted. \u201c \u2018Brekekekex, ko-ax!\u2019 \u201d The shape hopped away and disappeared into the moist plants by the path.</p><p>\u201cI always knew you had a gift for tongues,\u201d I said, amused. \u201cDidn\u2019t know you spoke frog, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m no ways fluent,\u201d he said modestly. \u201cThough I\u2019ve a fine accent, and I say it myself.\u201d</p><p>I laughed, and he squeezed my hand and let it go. The brief spark of the joke faded, failing to kindle conversation, and we walked on, physically together but miles apart in thought.</p><p>I should have been exhausted, but adrenaline was still coursing through my veins. I felt the exultation that comes with the completion of a successful bit of surgery, to say nothing of a little standard alcoholic intoxication. The effect of it all was to make me slightly wobbly on my pins, but with an acute and vivid awareness of everything around me.</p><p>There was an ornamental seat under the trees near the dock, and it was to this that Jamie led me, into the shadows. He sank onto the marble bench with a deep sigh, reminding me that I wasn\u2019t the only one for whom it had been an eventful evening.</p><p>I looked around with exaggerated attention, then sat down beside him.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re alone and unobserved,\u201d I said. \u201cDo you want to tell me what the hell is going on now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, aye.\u201d He straightened, stretching his back. \u201cI should have said something to ye sooner, only I didna quite expect she would do such a thing.\u201d He reached out and found my hand in the dark.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not anything wrong, exactly, as I told ye. It\u2019s only that when Ulysses brought me the plaid and dirk and the brooch, he told me that Jocasta meant to make an announcement at the dinner tonight\u2014to tell everyone that she meant to make me heir to...this.\u201d</p><p>His gesture took in the house and fields behind us\u2014and everything else: the river mooring, the orchard, the gardens, the stables, the endless acres of resinous pines, the sawmill and the turpentine camp\u2014and the forty slaves who worked them.</p><p>I could see the whole thing unfolding as Jocasta had no doubt envisioned it; Jamie sitting at the head of the table, dressed in Hector Cameron\u2019s tartan, wearing his blade and his brooch\u2014that brooch with the Camerons\u2019 unsubtle clan adjuration \u201cUnite!\u201d\u2014surrounded by Hector\u2019s old colleagues and comrades, all eager to welcome their friend\u2019s younger kinsman into his place.</p><p>Let her make such an announcement, in that company of loyal Scots, well lubricated with the late Hector\u2019s fine whisky, and they would have acclaimed him on the spot as the master of River Run, anointed him with boar\u2019s fat and crowned him with beeswax candles.</p><p>It had been a thoroughly MacKenzie-like plan, I thought; audacious, dramatic\u2014and taking no account of the wishes of the persons involved.</p><p>\u201cAnd if she had,\u201d he said, echoing my thoughts with uncanny precision, \u201cI should have found it verra awkward to decline the honor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, very.\u201d</p><p>He sprang suddenly to his feet, too restless to stay still. Without speaking, he held out a hand to me; I rose beside him and we turned back into the orchard path, circling the formal gardens. The lanterns lit for the party had been removed, their candles thriftily snuffed for later use.</p><p>\u201cWhy did Ulysses tell you?\u201d I wondered aloud.</p><p>\u201cAsk yourself, Sassenach,\u201d he said. \u201cWho is master now, at River Run?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d I said, and then, \u201cOh!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, indeed,\u201d he said dryly. \u201cMy aunt is blind; who has the keeping of the accounts, the running of the household? She may decide what things should be done\u2014but who is to say whether they are done? Who is always at her hand to tell her aught that happens, whose words are in her ear, whose judgment does she trust above all others?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI see.\u201d I stared down at the ground, thinking. \u201cYou don\u2019t suppose he\u2019s been fiddling the accounts or anything sordid like that?\u201d I hoped not; I liked Jocasta\u2019s butler very much, and had thought there was both fondness and respect between them; I didn\u2019t like to think of his cold-bloodedly cheating her.</p><p>Jamie shook his head.</p><p>\u201cHe is not. I\u2019ve been over the ledgers and accounts, and everything is in order\u2014verra good order indeed. I\u2019m sure he is an honest man and a faithful servant\u2014but he wouldna be human, to welcome giving up his place to a stranger.\u201d</p><p>He snorted briefly.</p> <p>\u201cMy aunt may be blind, but yon black man sees clear enough. He didna say a word to prevent me, or persuade me of anything: only told me what my aunt meant to do, and then left it to me what I should do. Or not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think he knew that you wouldn\u2019t\u2014\u201d I stopped there, because I wasn\u2019t sure myself that he wouldn\u2019t. Pride, caution, or both might have caused him to want to thwart Jocasta\u2019s plan, but that didn\u2019t mean he meant to reject her offer, either.</p><p>He didn\u2019t reply, and a small cold chill ran through me. I shivered, in spite of the warm summer air, and took his arm as we walked, seeking reassurance in the solid feel of his flesh beneath my fingers.</p><p>It was late July, and the scent of ripening fruit from the orchard was sweet, so heavy on the air that I could almost taste the clean, crisp tang of new apples. I thought of temptation\u2014and the worm that lay hidden beneath a shining skin.</p><p>Temptation not only for him, but for me. For him, the chance to be what he was made for by nature, what fate had denied him. He was born and bred to this: the stewardship of a large estate, the care of the people on it, a place of respect among men of substance, his peers. More importantly, the restoration of clan and family. I am already part of it, he\u2019d said.</p> <p>He cared nothing for wealth, of itself; I knew that. Neither did I think he wanted power; if he did, knowing what I knew about the future\u2019s shape, he would have chosen to go north, to seek a place among the founders of a nation.</p><p>But he had been a laird once. He had told me very little of his time in prison, but one thing he had said rang in my memory. Of the men who shared his confinement, he said\u2014They were mine. And the having of them kept me alive. And I remembered what Ian had said of Simon Fraser: \u201cCare for his men is now his only link with humanity.\u201d</p><p>Yes, Jamie needed men. Men to lead, to care for, to defend and to fight with. But not to own.</p><p>Past the orchard, still in silence, and down the long walk of herbaceous borders, with the scents of lily and lavender, anemone and roses, so pungent and heady that simply to walk through the hot, heavy air was like throwing oneself headlong onto a bed of fragrant petals.</p><p>Oh, River Run was a garden of earthly delight, all right...but I had called a black man friend, and left my daughter in his care.</p><p>Thinking of Joe Abernathy, and Brianna, gave me a strange sense of dislocated double vision, of existing in two places at once. I could see their faces in my mind, hear their voices in my inner ear. And yet reality was the man beside me, kilt swinging with his stride, head bent in anxious thought.</p> <p>And that was my temptation: Jamie. Not the inconsequentials of soft beds or gracious rooms, silk gowns or social deference. Jamie.</p><p>If he did not take Jocasta\u2019s offer, he must do something else. And \u201csomething else\u201d was most likely William Tryon\u2019s dangerous lure of land and men. Better than Jocasta\u2019s generous offer, in its way; what he built would be his own, the legacy he wanted to leave for Brianna. If he lived to build it.</p><p>I was still living on two planes. In this one, I could hear the whisper of his kilt where it brushed my skirt, feel the humid warmth of his body, warmer even than the heated air. I could smell the musky scent of him that made me want to pull him from his thoughts into the border, unbelt him and let the plaid fall from his shoulders, pull down my bodice and press my br**sts against him, take him down half-naked and wholly roused among the damp green plants, and force him from his thoughts to mine.</p><p>But on the plane of memory, I smelled yew trees and the wind from the sea, and under my fingers was no warm man, but the cold, smooth granite of a tombstone with his name.</p><p>I didn\u2019t speak. Neither did he.</p><p>We had made a complete circle by now, and come back to the river\u2019s edge, where gray stone steps led down and disappeared under a lapping sheen of water; even so far upstream, the faint echoes of the tide could be felt.</p><p>There was a boat moored there; a small rowboat, fit for solitary fishing or a leisurely excursion.</p><p>\u201cWill ye come for a row?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, why not?\u201d I thought he must feel the same desire I had\u2014to get away from the house and Jocasta, to get enough distance in which to think clearly, without danger of interruption.</p><p>I came down, putting my hand on his arm for balance. Before I could step into the boat, though, he turned toward me. Pulling me to him, he kissed me, gently, once, then held me against his body, his chin resting on my head.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he said quietly, in answer to my unspoken questions. He stepped into the boat and offered me a hand.</p><p>He was silent while we made our way out onto the river. It was a dark, moonless night, but the reflections of starlight from the surface of the river gave enough light to see, once my eyes had adapted to the shifting glimmer of water and tree-shadow.</p><p>\u201cYe dinna mean to say anything?\u201d he asked abruptly, at last.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not my choice to make,\u201d I said, feeling a tightness in my chest that had nothing to do with stays.</p><p>\u201cNo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s your aunt. It\u2019s your life. It has to be your choice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019ll be a spectator, will you?\u201d He grunted as he spoke, digging with the oars as he pulled upstream. \u201cIs it not your life? Or do ye not mean to stay with me, after all?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean, not stay?\u201d I sat up, startled.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps it will be too much for you.\u201d His head was bent over the oars; I couldn\u2019t see his face.</p><p>\u201cIf you mean what happened at the sawmill\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, not that.\u201d He heaved back on the oars, shoulders broadening under his linen, and gave me a crooked smile. \u201cDeath and disaster wouldna trouble ye ower-much, Sassenach. But the small things, day by day...I see ye flinch, when the black maid combs your hair, or when the boy takes your shoes away to clean. And the slaves who work in the turpentine camp. That troubles ye, no?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. It does. I\u2019m\u2014I can\u2019t own slaves. I\u2019ve told you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, ye have.\u201d He rested on the oars for a moment, brushing a lock of hair out of his face. His eyes met mine squarely.</p><p>\u201cAnd if I chose to do this, Sassenach...could ye stay by me, and watch, and do nothing\u2014for there is nothing that could be done, until my aunt should die. Perhaps not even then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe will not free her slaves\u2014how should she? I could not, while she lived.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut once you had inherited the place...\u201d I hesitated. Beyond the ghoulish aspects of discussing Jocasta\u2019s death, there was the more concrete consideration that that event was unlikely to occur for some time; Jocasta was little more than sixty, and aside from her blindness, in vigorous health.</p><p>I suddenly saw what he meant; could I bring myself to live, day after day, month after month, year after year, as an owner of slaves? I could not pretend otherwise, could take no refuge in the notion that I was only a guest, an outsider.</p><p>I bit my lip, in order not to cry out instant denial.</p><p>\u201cEven then,\u201d he said, answering my partial argument. \u201cDid ye not know that a slave owner cannot free his slaves without the written permission of the Assembly?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe what?\u201d I stared blankly at him. \u201cWhyever not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe plantation owners go in fear of an armed insurrection of Negroes,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd d\u2019ye blame them?\u201d he added sardonically.</p><p>\u201cSlaves are forbidden to carry weapons, save tools such as tree knives, and there are the bloodshed laws to prevent their use.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cNay, the last thing the Assembly would allow is a large group of free blacks let loose upon the countryside. Even if a man wishes to manumit one of his slaves, and is given permission to do so, the freed slave is required to leave the colony within a short time\u2014or he may be captured and enslaved by anyone who chooses to take him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve thought about it,\u201d I said slowly.</p><p>\u201cHaven\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t answer. I trailed my hand in the water, a little wave purling up my wrist. No, I hadn\u2019t thought about the prospect. Not consciously, because I hadn\u2019t wanted to face the choice that was now being laid before me.</p><p>\u201cI suppose it would be a great chance,\u201d I said, my voice sounding strained and unnatural to my ears. \u201cYou\u2019d be in charge of everything...\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy aunt is not a fool,\u201d he interrupted, with a slight edge to his voice. \u201cShe would make me heir, but not owner in her place. She would use me to do those things she cannot\u2014but I would be no more than her cat\u2019s-paw. True, she would ask my opinion, listen to my advice; but nothing would be done, and she didna wish it so.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head.</p><p>\u201cHer husband is dead. Whether she was fond of him or no, she is mistress here now, with none to answer to. And she enjoys the taste of power too well to spit it out.\u201d</p><p>He was plainly correct in this assessment of Jocasta Cameron\u2019s character, and therein lay the key to her plan. She needed a man; someone to go into those places she could not go, to deal with the Navy, to handle the chores of a large estate that she could not manage because of her blindness.</p><p>At the same time, she patently did not want a husband; someone who would usurp her power and dictate to her. Had he not been a slave, Ulysses could have acted for her\u2014but while he could be her eyes and ears, he could not be her hands.</p><p>No, Jamie was the perfect choice; a strong, competent man, able to command respect among peers, compel obedience in subordinates. One knowledgeable in the management of land and men. Furthermore, a man bound to her by kinship and obligation, there to do her bidding\u2014but essentially powerless. He would be held in thrall by dependence upon her bounty, and by the rich bribe of River Run itself; a debt that need not be paid until the matter was no longer of any earthly concern to Jocasta Cameron.</p><p>There was an increasing lump in my throat as I sought for words. I couldn\u2019t, I thought. I couldn\u2019t manage it. But I couldn\u2019t face the alternative, either; I couldn\u2019t urge him to reject Jocasta\u2019s offer, knowing it would send him to Scotland, to meet an unknown death.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t say what you should do,\u201d I finally said, my voice barely audible above the regular lap of the oars.</p><p>There was an eddy pool, where a large tree had fallen into the water, its branches forming a trap for all the debris that drifted downstream. Jamie made for this, backing the rowboat neatly into quiet water. He let down the oars, and wiped a sleeve across his forehead, breathing heavily from exertion. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The night was quiet around us, with little sound but the lapping of water, and the occasional scrape of submerged tree branches against the hull. At last he reached out and touched my chin.</p><p>\u201cYour face is my heart, Sassenach,\u201d he said softly, \u201cand love of you is my soul. But you\u2019re right; ye canna be my conscience.\u201d</p><p>In spite of everything, I felt a lightening of spirit, as though some indefinable burden had dropped away.</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m glad,\u201d I said, adding impulsively, \u201cit would be a terrible strain.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, aye?\u201d He looked mildly startled. \u201cYe think me verra wicked, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the best man I\u2019ve ever met,\u201d I said. \u201cI only meant...it\u2019s such a strain, to try to live for two people. To try to make them fit your ideas of what\u2019s right...you do it for a child, of course, you have to, but even then, it\u2019s dreadfully hard work. I couldn\u2019t do it for you\u2014it would be wrong even to try.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019d taken him back more than a little. He sat for some moments, his face half turned away.</p><p>\u201cDo ye really think me a good man?\u201d he said at last. There was a queer note in his voice, that I couldn\u2019t quite decipher.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I said, with no hesitation. Then added, half jokingly, \u201cDon\u2019t you?\u201d</p> <p>After a long pause, he said, quite seriously, \u201cNo, I shouldna think so.\u201d</p><p>I looked at him, speechless, no doubt with my mouth hanging open.</p><p>\u201cI am a violent man, and I ken it well,\u201d he said quietly. He spread his hands out on his knees; big hands, which could wield sword and dagger with ease, or choke the life from a man. \u201cSo do you\u2014or ye should.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve never done anything you weren\u2019t forced to do!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so,\u201d I said, but even as I spoke, a shadow of doubt clouded my words. Even when done from the most urgent necessity, did such things not leave a mark on the soul?</p> <p>\u201cYe wouldna hold me in the same estimation as, say, a man like Stephen Bonnet? He might well say he acted from necessity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you think you have the slightest thing in common with Stephen Bonnet, you\u2019re dead wrong,\u201d I said firmly.</p><p>He shrugged, half impatient, and shifted restlessly on the narrow bench.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nay much to choose between Bonnet and me, save that I have a sense of honor that he lacks. What else keeps me from turning thief?\u201d he demanded. \u201cFrom plundering those whom I might? It is in me to do it\u2014my one grandsire built Leoch on the gold of those he robbed in the Highland passes; the other built his fortune on the bodies of women whom he forced for their wealth and titles.\u201d</p><p>He stretched himself, powerful shoulders rising dark against the shimmer of the water behind him. Then he suddenly took hold of the oars across his knees and flung them into the bottom of the boat, with a crash that made me jump.</p><p>\u201cI am more than five-and-forty!\u201d he said. \u201cA man should be settled at that age, no? He should have a house, and some land to grow his food, and a bit of money put away to see him through his auld age, at the least.\u201d</p><p>He took a deep breath; I could see the white bosom of his shirt rise with his swelling chest.</p><p>\u201cWell, I dinna have a house. Or land. Or money. Not a croft, not a tattie-plot, not a cow or a sheep or a pig or a goat! I havena got a rooftree or a bedstead, or a pot to piss in!\u201d</p> <p>He slammed his fist down on the thwart, making the wooden seat vibrate under me.</p><p>\u201cI dinna own the clothes I stand up in!\u201d</p><p>There was a long silence, broken only by the thin song of crickets.</p><p>\u201cYou have me,\u201d I said, in a small voice. It didn\u2019t seem a lot.</p><p>He made a small sound in his throat that might have been either a laugh or a sob.</p><p>\u201cAye, I have,\u201d he said. His voice was quivering a bit, though whether with passion or amusement, I couldn\u2019t tell. \u201cThat\u2019s the hell of it, aye?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is?\u201d</p><p>He threw up his hand in a gesture of profound impatience.</p><p>\u201cIf it was only me, what would it matter? I could live like Myers; go to the woods, hunt and fish for my living, and when I was too old, lie down under a peaceful tree and die, and let the foxes gnaw my bones. Who would care?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged his shoulders with irritable violence, as though his shirt was too tight.</p><p>\u201cBut it\u2019s not only me,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s you, and it\u2019s Ian and it\u2019s Duncan and it\u2019s Fergus and it\u2019s Marsali\u2014God help me, there\u2019s even Laoghaire to think of!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, let\u2019s don\u2019t,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cDo ye not understand?\u201d he said, in near desperation. \u201cI would lay the world at your feet, Claire\u2014and I have nothing to give ye!\u201d</p><p>He honestly thought it mattered.</p><p>I sat looking at him, searching for words. He was half turned away, shoulders slumped in despair.</p><p>Within an hour, I had gone from anguish at the thought of losing him in Scotland, to a strong desire to bed him in the herbaceous borders, and from that to a pronounced urge to hit him on the head with an oar. Now I was back to tenderness.</p><p>At last I took one big, callused hand and slid forward so I knelt on the boards between his knees. I laid my head against his chest, and felt his breath stir my hair. I had no words, but I had made my choice.</p><p>\u201c \u2018Whither thou goest,\u2019 \u201d I said, \u201c \u2018I will go; and where thou lodgest, I will lodge: thy people shall be my people, and thy God my God: Where thou diest, will I die, and there will I be buried.\u2019 \u201d Be it Scottish hill or southern forest. \u201cYou do what you have to; I\u2019ll be there.\u201d</p><p>The water ran fast and shallow near the middle of the creek; I could see the boulders black just beneath the glinting surface. Jamie saw them, too, and pulled strongly for the far side, bringing us to rest against a shelving gravel bank, in a pool formed by the roots of a weeping willow. I leaned out and caught a branch of the willow, and wrapped the painter round it.</p><p>I had thought we would return to River Run, but evidently this expedition had some point beyond respite. We had continued upriver instead, Jamie pulling strongly against the slow current.</p><p>Left alone with my thoughts, I could only listen to the faint hiss of his breath, and wonder what he would do. If he chose to stay...well, it might not be as difficult as he thought. I didn\u2019t underrate Jocasta Cameron, but neither did I underestimate Jamie Fraser. Both Colum and Dougal MacKenzie had tried to bend him to their will\u2014and both had failed.</p><p>I had a moment\u2019s qualm at the memory of my last sight of Dougal MacKenzie, mouthing soundless curses as he drowned in his own blood, Jamie\u2019s dirk socketed at the base of his throat. I am a violent man, he\u2019d said, you know it.</p><p>But he was still wrong; there was a difference between this man and Stephen Bonnet, I thought, watching the flex of his body on the oars, the grace and power of the sweep of his arms. He had several things beyond the honor that he claimed: kindness, courage...and a conscience.</p><p>I realized where we were going, as he backed with one oar, steering across the current toward the mouth of a wide creek, overhung with aspens. I had never approached by water before, but Jocasta had said it was not far.</p><p>I should not have been surprised; if he had come out tonight to confront his demons, it was a most appropriate place.</p><p>A little way above the creek mouth, the mill loomed dark and silent. There was a dim glow behind its bulk; light from the slave shanties near the woods. We were surrounded by the usual night noises, but the place seemed strangely quiet, in spite of the racket made by trees and frogs and water. Though it was night, the huge building seemed to cast a shadow\u2014though this was plainly no more than my imagination.</p><p>\u201cPlaces that are very busy in the daytime always seem particularly spooky at night,\u201d I said, in an effort to break the mill\u2019s silence.</p><p>\u201cDo they?\u201d Jamie sounded abstracted. \u201cI didna much like that one in the daylight.\u201d</p><p>I shuddered at the memory.</p><p>\u201cNeither did I. I only meant\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cByrnes is dead.\u201d He didn\u2019t look at me; his face was turned toward the mill, half-hidden by the willow\u2019s shadow.</p><p>I dropped the end of the tie rope.</p><p>\u201cThe overseer? When?\u201d I said, shocked more by the abruptness than the revelation. \u201cAnd how?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis afternoon. Campbell\u2019s youngest lad brought the news just before sunset.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d I asked again. I gripped my knees, a double handful of ivory silk twisted in my fingers.</p><p>\u201cIt was the lockjaw.\u201d His voice was casual, unemphatic. \u201cA verra nasty way to die.\u201d</p><p>He was right about that. I had never actually seen anyone die of tetanus myself, but I knew the symptoms well enough: restlessness and difficulty swallowing, developing into a progressive stiffening as the muscles of arms and legs and neck began to spasm. The spasms increased in severity and duration until the patient\u2019s body was hard as wood, arched in an agony that came on and receded, came on again, went off, and at last came on in an endless tetany that could not be relaxed by anything save death.</p><p>\u201cHe died grinnin\u2019, Ronnie Campbell said. But I shouldna think it was a happy death, forbye.\u201d It was a grim joke, but there was little humor in his voice.</p><p>I sat up quite straight, feeling cold all down my spine in spite of the warmth of the night.</p><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t a quick death, either,\u201d I said. Suspicion spread cold tentacles through my mind. \u201cIt takes days to die of tetanus.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt took Davie Byrnes five days, first to last.\u201d If there had been any trace of humor in his voice to start with, it was gone now.</p><p>\u201cYou saw him,\u201d I said, a small flicker of anger beginning to thaw the internal chill. \u201cYou saw him! And you didn\u2019t tell me?\u201d</p><p>I had dressed Byrnes\u2019s injury\u2014hideous, but not life-threatening\u2014and had been told that he would be kept somewhere \u201csafe\u201d until the disturbance over the lynching had died down. Heartsick as I was over the matter, I had made no effort to inquire further after the overseer\u2019s whereabouts or welfare; it was my own guilt at this neglect that made me angry, and I knew it\u2014but the knowledge didn\u2019t help.</p><p>\u201cCould ye have done anything? I thought ye told me that the lockjaw was one of the things that couldna be helped, even in your time.\u201d He wasn\u2019t looking at me; I could see his profile turned toward the mill, head stamped in darker black against the lighter shadow of pale leaves.</p><p>I forced myself to let go of my skirt. I smoothed the crumpled patches over my knee, thinking dimly that Phaedre would have a terrible time ironing it.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I said, with a little effort. \u201cNo, I couldn\u2019t have saved him. But I should have seen him; I might have eased him a little.\u201d</p><p>Now he did look at me; I saw his head turn, and felt the shifting of his weight in the boat.</p><p>\u201cYou might,\u201d he said evenly.</p><p>\u201cAnd you wouldn\u2019t let me\u2014\u201d I stopped, remembering his absences this past week, and his evasive replies when I had asked him where he\u2019d been. I could imagine the scene all too well; the tiny, stifling attic room in Farquard Campbell\u2019s house where I had dressed Byrnes\u2019s injury. The racked figure on the bed, dying by inches under the cold eyes of those the law had made his unwilling allies, knowing that he died despised. The sense of cold came back, raising gooseflesh on my arms. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo, I wouldna let Campbell send for you,\u201d he said softly. \u201cThere\u2019s the law, Sassenach\u2014and there is justice. I ken the difference well enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s such a thing as mercy, too.\u201d And had anyone asked, I would have called Jamie Fraser a merciful man. He had been, once. But the years between now and then had been hard ones\u2014and compassion was a soft emotion, easily eroded by circumstance. I had thought he still had his kindness, though; and felt a queer pain at the thought of its loss. I shouldna think so, no. Had that been no more than honesty?</p><p>The boat had drifted halfway round, so that the drooping branch hung now between us. There was a small snort from the darkness behind the leaves.</p><p>\u201cBlessed are the merciful,\u201d he said, \u201cfor they shall find mercy. Byrnes wasn\u2019t, and he didn\u2019t. And as for me, once God had made his opinion of the man known, I didna think it right to interfere.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou think God gave him tetanus?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI canna think anyone else would have the imagination for it. Besides,\u201d he went on, logically, \u201cwhere else would ye look for justice?\u201d</p><p>I searched for words, and failed to find any. Giving up, I returned to the only possible point of argument. I felt a little sick.</p><p>\u201cYou ought to have told me. Even if you didn\u2019t think I could help, it wasn\u2019t your business to decide\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didna want ye to go.\u201d His voice was still quiet, but there was a note of steel in it now.</p> <p>\u201cI know you didn\u2019t! But it doesn\u2019t matter whether you thought Byrnes deserved to suffer or\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot for him!\u201d The boat rocked suddenly as he moved, and I grasped the sides to keep my balance. He spoke violently.</p><p>\u201cI didna care a fig whether Byrnes died easy or hard, but I\u2019m no a monster of cruelty! I didna keep you from him to make him suffer; I kept ye away to protect you.\u201d</p><p>I was relieved to hear this, but increasingly angry as the truth of what he\u2019d done dawned on me.</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t your business to decide that. If I\u2019m not your conscience, it isn\u2019t up to you to be mine!\u201d I brushed angrily at the screen of willow fronds between us, trying to see him.</p><p>Suddenly a hand shot through the leaves and grabbed my wrist.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s up to me to keep ye safe!\u201d</p><p>I tried to jerk away, but he had a tight grip on me, and he wasn\u2019t letting go.</p><p>\u201cI am not a young girl who needs protection, nor yet an idiot! If there\u2019s some reason for me not to do something, then tell me and I\u2019ll listen. But you can\u2019t decide what I\u2019m to do and where I\u2019m to go without even consulting me\u2014I won\u2019t stand for that, and you bloody well know it!\u201d</p><p>The boat lurched, and with a huge rustling of leaves, he popped his head through the willow, glaring.</p><p>\u201cI am not trying to say where ye\u2019ll go!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou decided where I mustn\u2019t go, and that\u2019s just as bad!\u201d The willow leaves slid back over his shoulders as the boat moved, jarred by his violence, and we revolved slowly, coming out of the tree\u2019s shadow.</p><p>He loomed in front of me, massive as the mill, his head and shoulders blotting out a good bit of the scenery behind him. The long, straight nose was an inch from mine, and his eyes had gone narrow. They were a dark enough blue to be black in this light, and looking into them at close range was most unnerving.</p><p>I blinked. He didn\u2019t.</p> <p>He had let go of my wrist when he came through the leaves. Now he took hold of my upper arms. I could feel the heat of his grip through the cloth. His hands were very big and very hard, making me suddenly aware of the fragility of my own bones in contrast. I am a violent man.</p><p>He\u2019d shaken me a time or two before, and I hadn\u2019t liked it. In case he had something of the sort in mind just now, I inserted a foot between his legs, and prepared to give him a swift knee where it would do most good.</p><p>\u201cI was wrong,\u201d he said.</p><p>Tensed for violence, I had actually started to jerk my foot up, when I heard what he had said. Before I could stop, he had clamped his legs tight together, trapping my knee between his thighs.</p><p>\u201cI said I was wrong, Sassenach,\u201d he repeated, a touch of impatience in his voice. \u201cD\u2019ye mind?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh...no,\u201d I said, feeling a trifle sheepish. I wiggled my knee tentatively, but he kept his thighs squeezed tight together.</p><p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t consider letting go of me, would you?\u201d I said politely. My heart was still pounding.</p><p>\u201cNo, I wouldn\u2019t. Are ye going to listen to me now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose so,\u201d I said, still polite. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t look as though I\u2019m very busy at the moment.\u201d</p><p>I was close enough to see his mouth twitch. His thighs squeezed tighter for a moment, then relaxed.</p><p>\u201cThis is a verra foolish quarrel, and you know that as well as I do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t.\u201d My anger had faded somewhat, but I wasn\u2019t about to let him dismiss it altogether. \u201cIt\u2019s maybe not important to you, but it is to me. It isn\u2019t foolish. And you know it, or you wouldn\u2019t be admitting you\u2019re wrong.\u201d</p><p>The twitch was more pronounced this time. He took a deep breath, and dropped his hands from my shoulders.</p><p>\u201cWell, then. I should maybe have told ye about Byrnes; I admit it. But if I had, ye would have gone to him, even if I\u2019d said it was the lockjaw\u2014and I kent it was, I\u2019ve seen it before. Even if there was nothing ye could do, you\u2019d still go? No?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Even if\u2014yes, I would have gone.\u201d</p><p>In fact, there was nothing I could have done for Byrnes. Myers\u2019s anesthetic wouldn\u2019t have helped a case of tetanus. Nothing short of injectable curare would ease those spasms. I could have given him nothing more than the comfort of my presence, and it was doubtful that he would have appreciated that\u2014or even noticed it. Still, I would have felt bound to offer it.</p><p>\u201cI would have had to go,\u201d I said, more gently. \u201cI\u2019m a doctor. Don\u2019t you see?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I do,\u201d he said gruffly. \u201cD\u2019ye think I dinna ken ye at all, Sassenach?\u201d</p><p>Without waiting for an answer, he went on.</p><p>\u201cThere was talk about what happened at the mill\u2014there would be, aye? But with the man dying under your hands as he did\u2014well, no one\u2019s said straight out that ye might have killed him on purpose...but it\u2019s easy to see folk thinkin\u2019 it. Not thinkin\u2019 that ye killed him, even\u2014but only that ye might have thought to let him die on purpose, so as to save him from the rope.\u201d</p><p>I stared at my hands, spread out on my knees, nearly as pale as the ivory satin under them.</p><p>\u201cI did think of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI ken that fine, aye?\u201d he said dryly. \u201cI saw your face, Sassenach.\u201d</p><p>I drew a deep breath, if only to assure myself that the air was no longer thick with the smell of blood. There was nothing but the turpentine scent of the pine forest, clean and astringent in my nostrils. I had a sudden vivid memory of the hospital, of the smell of pine-scented disinfectant that hung in the air, that overlaid but could not banish the underlying smell of sickness.</p><p>I took another cleansing breath, and raised my head to look at Jamie.</p><p>\u201cAnd did you wonder if I\u2019d killed him?\u201d</p><p>He looked faintly surprised.</p><p>\u201cYe would have done as ye thought best.\u201d He dismissed the minor question of whether I\u2019d killed a man, in favor of the point at issue.</p><p>\u201cBut it didna seem wise for ye to preside over both deaths, if ye take my meaning.\u201d</p><p>I did, and not for the first time I was aware of the subtle networks of which he was a part, in a way I could never be. This place in its way was as strange to him as it was to me; and yet he knew not only what people were saying\u2014anyone could find that out, who cared to haunt tavern and market\u2014but what they were thinking.</p><p>What was more irritating was that he knew what I was thinking.</p><p>\u201cSo ye see,\u201d he said, watching me. \u201cI kent Byrnes was sure to die, and ye couldna help. Yet if ye knew his trouble, ye\u2019d surely go to him. And then he would die, and folk would maybe not say how strange it was, that both men had died under your hand, so to speak\u2014but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut they\u2019d be thinking it,\u201d I finished for him.</p><p>The twitch grew into a crooked smile.</p><p>\u201cFolk notice you, Sassenach.\u201d</p><p>I bit my lip. For good or for ill, they did, and the noticing had come close to killing me more than once.</p><p>He rose, and taking hold of a branch for balance, stepped out on the gravel and pulled the plaid up over his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cI told Mrs. Byrnes I would fetch away her husband\u2019s things from the mill,\u201d he said. \u201cYe needna come, if ye dinna wish.\u201d</p><p>The mill loomed against the star-spattered sky. It couldn\u2019t have looked more sinister if it had tried. Whither thou goest, I will go.</p><p>I thought I knew now what he was doing. He had wanted to see it all, before making up his mind; see it with the knowledge that it might be his. Walking through the gardens and orchards, rowing past the acres of thick pines, visiting the mill\u2014he was surveying the domain he was offered, weighing and evaluating, deciding what complications must be dealt with, and whether he could or would accept the challenge.</p><p>After all, I thought sourly, the Devil had insisted on showing Jesus everything He was passing up, taking Him up to the top of the Temple to gaze on the cities of the world. The only difficulty was that if Jamie decided to fling himself off, there wasn\u2019t a legion of angels standing by to stop him dashing his foot\u2014and everything else\u2014against a slab of Scottish granite.</p><p>Only me.</p><p>\u201cWait,\u201d I said, clambering out of the boat. \u201cI\u2019m coming, too.\u201d</p><p>The lumber was still stacked in the millyard; no one had moved any of it since the last time I had been here. The dark took away all sense of perspective; the stacks of fresh timber were pale rectangles that seemed to float above an invisible ground, first distant, then suddenly looming close enough to brush my skirts. The air smelt of pinesap and sawdust.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t see the ground under my own feet, for that matter, obscured as it was both by darkness and by my billowing ivory skirt. Jamie held my arm to keep me from stumbling. He never stumbled, of course. Perhaps living all his life without even the thought of light outside after sunset had given him some sort of radar, I thought; like a bat.</p><p>There was a fire burning, somewhere among the slave huts. It was very late; most would be sleeping. In the Indies, there would have been the nightlong sound of drums and keening; the slaves would have made lamentations for a fellow\u2019s death, a festival of mourning to last the week. Here, there was nothing. No sound save the pine trees\u2019 soughing, no flicker of movement save the faint light at the forest\u2019s edge.</p><p>\u201cThey are afraid,\u201d Jamie said softly, pausing to listen to the silence, as I did.</p><p>\u201cLittle wonder,\u201d I said, half under my breath. \u201cSo am I.\u201d</p><p>He made a small huffing sound that might have been amusement.</p><p>\u201cSo am I,\u201d he muttered, \u201cbut not of ghosts.\u201d He took my arm and pushed open the small man-door at the side of the mill before I could ask what he was afraid of. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The silence inside had a body to it. At first I thought it like the eerie quiet of dead battlefields, but then I realized the difference. This silence was alive. And whatever lived in the silence here, it wasn\u2019t lying quiet. I thought I could still smell the blood, thick on the air.</p><p>Then I breathed deeply and thought again, cold horror rippling up my spine. I could smell blood. Fresh blood.</p><p>I gripped Jamie\u2019s arm, but he had smelled it himself; his arm had gone hard under my hand, muscles tensed in wariness. Without a word, he detached himself from my grip, and vanished.</p><p>For a moment, I thought he truly had vanished, and nearly panicked, groping for him, my hand closing on the empty air where he\u2019d stood. Then I realized that he had merely flung the dark plaid over his head, instantly hiding the paleness of face and linen shirt. I heard his step, quick and light on the dirt floor, and then that was gone too.</p> <p>The air was hot and still, and thick with blood. A rank, sweet smell, with a metal taste on the back of the tongue. Exactly the same as it had been a week ago, conjuring hallucination. Still in the grip of a cold grue, I swung around and strained my eyes toward the far side of the cavernous room, half expecting to see the scene engraved on my memory materialize again out of darkness. The rope stretched tight from the lumber crane, the huge hook swaying with its groaning burden...</p><p>A groan rent the air, and I nearly bit my lip in two. My throat swelled with a swallowed scream; only the fear of drawing something to me kept me silent.</p><p>Where was Jamie? I longed to call out for him, but didn\u2019t dare. My eyes had grown enough accustomed to the dark to make out the shadow of the saw blade, an amorphous blob ten feet away, but the far side of the room was a wall of blackness. I strained my eyes to see, realizing belatedly that in my pale dress, I was undoubtedly visible to anyone in the room with me.</p><p>The groan came again, and I started convulsively. My palms were sweating. It\u2019s not! I told myself fiercely. It isn\u2019t, it can\u2019t be!</p><p>I was paralyzed with fear, and it took some moments for me to realize what my ears had told me. The sound hadn\u2019t come from the blackness across the room, where the crane stood with its hook. It had come from somewhere behind me.</p> <p>I whirled. The door we had come through was still open, a pale rectangle in the pitch-black. Nothing showed, nothing moved between me and the door. I took a quick step toward it and stopped. Every muscle in my legs strained to run like hell\u2014but I couldn\u2019t leave Jamie.</p><p>Again the sound, that same sobbing gasp of physical anguish; pain past the point of crying out. With it, a new thought popped into my mind; what if it was Jamie making the sound?</p><p>Shocked out of caution, I turned toward the sound and shouted his name, raising echoes from the roof high above.</p><p>\u201cJamie!\u201d I cried again. \u201cWhere are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere, Sassenach.\u201d Jamie\u2019s muffled voice came from somewhere to my left, calm but somehow urgent. \u201cCome to me, will ye?\u201d</p><p>It wasn\u2019t him. Nearly shaking with relief at the sound of his voice, I blundered through the dark, not caring now what had made the sound, as long as it wasn\u2019t Jamie.</p> <p>My hand struck a wooden wall, groped blindly, and finally found a door, standing open. He was inside the overseer\u2019s quarters.</p><p>I stepped through the door, and felt the change at once. The air was even closer, and much hotter, than that in the mill proper. The floor here was of wood, but there was no echo to my step; the air was dead still, suffocating. And the smell of blood was even stronger.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you?\u201d I called again, low-voiced this time.</p><p>\u201cHere,\u201d came the reply, startlingly near at hand. \u201cBy the bed. Come and help me; it\u2019s a lass.\u201d</p><p>He was in the tiny bedroom. The small room was windowless, and lightless too. I found them by feel, Jamie kneeling on the wooden floor beside a narrow bed, and in the bed, a body.</p><p>It was a female, as he\u2019d said; touch told me that at once. Touch told me also that she was exsanguinating. The cheek I brushed was cool and clammy. Everything else I touched was warm and wet; her clothing, the bedclothes, the mattress beneath her. I could feel wetness soaking through my skirt where I knelt on the floor.</p><p>I felt for a pulse in the throat and couldn\u2019t find it. The chest moved slightly under my hand, the only sign of life beyond the faint sigh that went with it.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right now,\u201d I heard myself saying, and my voice was soothing, all trace of panic gone, though in truth there was more reason for it now. \u201cWe\u2019re here, you\u2019re not alone. What\u2019s happened to you, can you tell me?\u201d</p> <p>All the time my hands were darting over head and throat and chest and stomach, pushing sodden clothes aside, searching blindly, frantically, for a wound to stanch. Nothing, no spurt of artery, no raw gash. And all the time, there was a faint but steady pit-a-pat, pit-a-pat, like the sound of tiny feet running.</p><p>\u201cTell...\u201d It was not so much a word as the articulation of a sigh. Then a catch, a sobbing breath indrawn.</p><p>\u201cWho has done this to ye, lass?\u201d Jamie\u2019s disembodied voice came low and urgent. \u201cTell me, who?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell...\u201d</p><p>I touched all the places where the great vessels lie close beneath the skin and found them whole. Seized her by an unresisting arm and lifted, thrust a hand beneath to feel her back. All the heat of her body was there; the bodice was damp with sweat, but not blood-soaked.</p><p>\u201cIt will be all right,\u201d I said again. \u201cYou\u2019re not alone. Jamie, hold her hand.\u201d Hopelessness came down on me; I knew what it must be.</p><p>\u201cI already have it,\u201d he said to me, and \u201cDinna trouble, lass,\u201d to her. \u201cIt will be all right, d\u2019ye hear me?\u201d Pit-a-pat, pit-a-pat. The tiny feet were slowing.</p><p>\u201cTell...\u201d</p><p>I could not help, but nonetheless slid my hand beneath her skirt again, this time letting my fingers curve between the limp splayed thighs. She was still warm here, very warm. Blood flowed gently over my hand and through my fingers, hot and wet as the air around us, unstoppable as the water that flowed down the mill\u2019s sluice.</p><p>\u201cI...die...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think ye are murdered, lass,\u201d Jamie said to her, very gently. \u201cWill ye not say who has killed you?\u201d</p><p>Her breath came louder now, a soft rattle in her throat. Pit. Pat. Pit. Pat. The feet were tiptoeing softly now.</p><p>\u201cSer...geant. Tell...him...\u201d</p><p>I drew my hand out from between her thighs and took her other hand in mine, heedless of the blood. It scarcely mattered now, after all.</p><p>\u201c...tell...\u201d came with sudden intensity, and then silence. A long silence, and then, another long, sighing breath. A silence, even longer. And a breath.</p><p>\u201cI will,\u201d said Jamie. His voice was no more than a whisper in the dark. \u201cI will do it. I promise ye.\u201d</p><p>Pit.</p><p>Pat.</p><p>They called it the \u201cdeath drop,\u201d in the Highlands; the sound of dripping water, heard in a house when one of the inhabitants was about to die. Not water dripping here, but a sure sign, nonetheless.</p><p>There was no more sound from the darkness. I couldn\u2019t see Jamie, but felt the slight movement of the bed against my thighs as he leaned forward.</p><p>\u201cGod will forgive ye,\u201d he whispered to the silence. \u201cGo in peace.\u201d</p><p>I could hear the buzzing the moment we stepped into the overseer\u2019s quarters the next morning. In the huge, dusty silence of the mill, everything had been muffled in space and sawdust. But in this small, partitioned area the walls caught every sound and threw it back; our footsteps echoed from wooden floor to wooden ceiling. I felt like a fly sealed inside a snare drum, and suffered a moment\u2019s claustrophobia, trapped as I was in the narrow passage between the two men.</p><p>There were only two rooms, separated by a short passage that led from the outdoors into the mill proper. On our right lay the larger room that had served the Byrneses for living and cooking, and on the left, the smaller bedroom, from which the noise was coming. Jamie took a deep breath, clasped his plaid to his face, and pulled open the bedroom door.</p><p>It looked like a blanket covering the bed, a blanket of gunmetal blue sparked with green. Then Jamie took a step into the room and the flies rose buzzing from their clotted meal in a swarm of gluttonous protest.</p><p>I bit back a cry of abhorrence and ducked, flailing at them. Bloated, slow-moving bodies hit my face and arms and bounced away, circling lazily through the thick air. Farquard Campbell made a Scottish noise of overpowering disgust that sounded like \u201cHeuch!\u201d then lowered his head and pushed past me, eyes slitted and lips pressed tight together, nostrils pinched to whiteness.</p><p>The tiny bedroom was hardly bigger than the coffin it had become. There were no windows, only cracks between the boards that let in a dim uncertain light. The atmosphere was hot and humid as a tropical greenhouse, thick with the rotting-sweet smell of death. I could feel the sweat snaking down my sides, ticklish as flies\u2019 feet, and tried to breathe only through my mouth.</p><p>She had not been large; her body made only the slightest mound beneath the blanket we had laid over her the night before, for decency\u2019s sake. Her head seemed big by contrast to the shrunken body, like a child\u2019s stick figure with a round ball stuck on toothpick limbs.</p><p>Brushing away several flies too glutted to move, Jamie pulled back the blanket. The blanket, like everything else, was blotched and crusted, sodden at the foot. The human body, on average, contains eight pints of blood, but it seems a lot more when you spread it around.</p><p>I had seen her face briefly the night before, dead features lent an artificial glow by the light of the pine splinter Jamie held above her. Now she lay pallid and dank as a mushroom, blunt features emerging from a web of fine brown hair. It was impossible to tell her age, save that she was not old. Neither could I tell whether she had been attractive; there was no beauty of bone, but animation might have flushed the round cheeks and lent her deepset eyes a sparkle men might have found pretty. One man had, I thought. Pretty enough, anyway.</p><p>The men were murmuring together, bent over the still form. Mr. Campbell turned now to me, wearing a slight frown beneath his formal wig.</p><p>\u201cYou are reasonably sure, Mrs. Fraser, of the cause of death?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Trying not to breathe the fetid air, I picked up the edge of the blanket, and turned it back, exposing the corpse\u2019s legs. The feet were faintly blue and beginning to swell.</p><p>\u201cI drew her skirt down, but I left everything else as it was,\u201d I explained, pulling it up again.</p><p>My stomach muscles tightened automatically as I touched her. I had seen dead bodies before, and this was far from the most gruesome, but the hot climate and closed atmosphere had prevented the body from cooling much; the flesh of her thigh was as warm as mine, but unpleasantly flaccid.</p><p>I had left it where we found it, in the bed between her legs. A kitchen skewer, more than a foot long. It was covered in dried blood as well, but clearly visible.</p><p>\u201cI...um...found no wound on the body,\u201d I said, putting it as delicately as possible.</p><p>\u201cAye, I see.\u201d Mr. Campbell\u2019s frown seemed to lessen slightly. \u201cAh, well, at least \u2019tis likely not a case of deliberate murder, then.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I opened my mouth to reply, but caught a warning look from Jamie. Not noticing, Mr. Campbell went on.</p><p>\u201cThe question remains whether the poor woman will have done it herself, or met her death by the agency of another. What think ye, Mistress Fraser?\u201d</p><p>Jamie narrowed his eyes at me over Campbell\u2019s shoulder, but the warning was unnecessary; we had discussed the matter last night, and come to our own conclusions\u2014also to the conclusion that our opinions need not be shared with the forces of law and order in Cross Creek; not just yet. I pinched my nose slightly under pretext of the smell, in order to disguise any telltale alteration of my expression. I was a very bad liar.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure she did it by herself,\u201d I said firmly. \u201cIt takes very little time to bleed to death in this manner, and as Jamie told you, she was still alive when we found her. We were outside the mill, talking, for some time before we came in; no one would have been able to leave without our seeing them.\u201d</p> <p>On the other hand, a person might quite easily have hidden in the other room, and crept out quietly in the dark while we were occupied in comforting the dying woman. If this possibility did not occur to Mr. Campbell, I saw no reason to draw it to his attention.</p><p>Jamie had rearranged his features into an expression of gravity suitable to the occasion by the time Mr. Campbell turned back to him. The older man shook his head in regret.</p><p>\u201cAh, poor unfortunate lass! I suppose we can but be relieved that no one else has shared her sin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about the man who fathered the child she was trying to get rid of?\u201d I said, with a certain amount of acidity. Mr. Campbell looked startled, but pulled himself quickly back together.</p><p>\u201cUm...quite so,\u201d he said, and coughed. \u201cThough we do not know whether she were married\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo ye do not know the woman yourself, sir?\u201d Jamie butted in before I could make any further injudicious remarks.</p><p>Campbell shook his head.</p><p>\u201cShe is not the servant of Mr. Buchanan or the MacNeills, I am sure. Nor Judge Alderdyce. Those are the only plantations near enough from which she might have walked. Though it does occur to me to wonder why she should have come to this particular place to perform such a desperate act...\u201d</p><p>It had occurred to Jamie and me, too. To prevent Mr. Campbell\u2019s taking the next step in this line of inquiry, Jamie intervened again.</p><p>\u201cShe said verra little, but she did mention a \u2018Sergeant.\u2019 \u2018Tell the Sergeant\u2019 were her words. Do ye perhaps have a thought whom she might mean by that, sir?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think there is an army sergeant in charge of the guard on the royal warehouse. Yes, I am sure of it.\u201d Mr. Campbell brightened slightly. \u201cAh! Nay doubt the woman was attached in some way to the military establishment. Depend upon it, that is the explanation. Though I still wonder why she\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMr. Campbell, do pardon me\u2014I\u2019m afraid I\u2019m feeling a bit faint,\u201d I interrupted, laying a hand on his sleeve. This was no lie; I hadn\u2019t slept or eaten. I felt light-headed from the heat and the smell, and I knew I must look pale.</p><p>\u201cWill ye see my wife outside, sir?\u201d Jamie said. He gestured toward the bed and its pathetic burden. \u201cI\u2019ll bring the poor lass along as I may.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPray do not trouble yourself, Mr. Fraser,\u201d Campbell protested, already turning to usher me out. \u201cMy servant can fetch out the body.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is my aunt\u2019s mill, sir, and thus my concern.\u201d Jamie spoke politely, but firmly. \u201cI shall attend to it.\u201d</p><p>Phaedre was waiting outside, by the wagon.</p><p>\u201cI told you that place got haints,\u201d she said, surveying me with an air of grim satisfaction. \u201cYou white as ary sheet, ma\u2019am.\u201d She handed me a flask of spiced wine, wrinkling her nose delicately in my direction.</p><p>\u201cYou smellin\u2019 worse than what you was last night, and you look like you come from a pig-killin\u2019 then. Sit you down in the shade here and drink that up; fix you up peart.\u201d She glanced over my shoulder. I looked back as well, and saw that Campbell had reached the shade of the sycamores by the creek bank, and was deep in conversation with his servant.</p><p>\u201cFound her,\u201d Phaedre said at once, dropping her voice. Her eyes cut sideways, toward the small cluster of slave huts, barely visible from this side of the mill.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re sure? You didn\u2019t have much time.\u201d I took a mouthful of wine and held it, glad of the sharp bouquet that rose up the back of my throat, cleansing my palate of the taste of death.</p><p>Phaedre nodded, her glance moving to the men under the trees.</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t need much. Walked down by them houses, saw one door hangin\u2019 open, little bits of trash scattered round like somebody done left in a hurry. I find a picanin\u2019 and ask him who livin\u2019 there, he tell me Pollyanne live there, but she gone now, he don\u2019t know where. Ask him when she leave, he say she there for supper last night, this morning she gone, nobody see her.\u201d Her eyes met mine, dark with questions. \u201cNow you know, what you mean to do?\u201d</p><p>A bloody good question, and one for which I had no answer at all. I swallowed the wine, and along with it, a rising sense of panic.</p><p>\u201cAll the slaves here must know she\u2019s gone; how long before anyone else finds out? Whose business will it be to know such things, now that Byrnes is dead?\u201d</p><p>Phaedre raised one shoulder in a graceful shrug.</p><p>\u201cAnybody come askin\u2019 find out right quick. But whose business it be to ask\u2014\u201d She nodded toward the mill. We had left the small door to the living quarters open; Jamie was coming out, a blanket-wrapped burden cradled in his arms.</p><p>\u201cReckon it\u2019s his,\u201d she said.</p><p>I am already part of it. He had known, even before the interrupted dinner party. With no formal announcement, with neither invitation nor acceptance of the role, he fit the place, the part, like a piece slipping into a jigsaw puzzle. Already he was the master of River Run\u2014if he wanted to be.</p><p>Campbell\u2019s servant had come to help with the body; Jamie sank to one knee by the edge of the mill flume, surrendering his burden gently to the earth. I gave Phaedre back the flask, with a nod of thanks.</p><p>\u201cWill you fetch the things from the wagon?\u201d</p><p>Without a word, Phaedre went to get the things I had brought\u2014a blanket, a bucket, clean rags, and a jar of herbs\u2014while I went to join Jamie.</p><p>He was kneeling by the creek, washing his hands, a little way upstream from where the body lay. It was foolish to wash in preparation for what I was about to do, but habit was strong; I knelt beside him and dipped my hands as well, letting the cold fresh rush of water carry away the touch of clammy flesh.</p><p>\u201cI was right,\u201d I said to him, low-voiced. \u201cIt was a woman called Pollyanne; she\u2019s run away in the night.\u201d</p><p>He grimaced, rubbing his palms briskly together, and glanced over his shoulder. Campbell was standing over the corpse now, a slight frown of distaste still on his face.</p><p>Jamie scowled in concentration, gaze returning to his hands. \u201cWell, that\u2019ll put a cocked hat on it, aye?\u201d He bent and splashed his face, then shook his head violently, flinging drops like a wet dog. Then he gave me a nod, and stood up, wiping his face with the end of his stained plaid.</p><p>\u201cSee to the lassie, aye, Sassenach?\u201d He stalked purposefully toward Mr. Campbell, plaid swinging.</p><p>There was no use saving any of her clothes; I cut them off. Undressed, she looked to be in her twenties. Undernourished; ribs countable, arms and legs slender and pale as stripped branches. For all that, she was still surprisingly heavy, and the remnants of rigor mortis made her hard to handle. Phaedre and I were both sweating heavily before we finished, and strands of hair were escaping from the knot at my neck and pasting themselves to my flushed cheeks.</p><p>At least the heavy labor kept conversation to a minimum, leaving me in peace with my thoughts. Not that my thoughts were particularly peaceful.</p><p>A woman seeking to \u201cslip a bairn,\u201d as Jamie put it, would do it in her own room, her own bed, if she were doing it alone. The only reason for the stranger to have come to a remote place such as this was to meet the person who would do the office for her\u2014a person who could not come to her.</p><p>We must look for a slave in the mill quarters, I had told him, one maybe with the reputation of a midwife, someone women would talk about among themselves, would recommend in whispers.</p><p>The fact that I had apparently been proved right gave me no satisfaction. The abortionist had fled, fearing that the woman would have told us who had done the deed. If she had stayed put and said nothing, Farquard Campbell might have taken my word for it that the woman must have done it herself\u2014he could hardly prove otherwise. If anyone else found that the slave Pollyanne had run, though\u2014and of course they would find out!\u2014and she were caught and questioned, the whole matter would no doubt come out at once. And then what?</p><p>I shuddered, despite the heat. Did the law of bloodshed apply in this case? It certainly ought, I thought, grimly sluicing yet another bucket of water over the splayed white limbs, if quantity counted for anything.</p><p>Damn the woman, I thought, using irritation to cover a useless pity. I could do nothing for her now save try to tidy up the mess she had left\u2014in every sense of the word. And perhaps try to save the other player in this tragedy; the hapless woman who had done murder unmeaning, in the guise of help, and who stood now to pay for that mistake with her own life.</p><p>Jamie had gotten the wine flask, I saw; he was passing it back and forth with Farquard Campbell, the two talking intently, occasionally turning to gesture at the mill or back toward the river or the town.</p><p>\u201cYou got anything I can comb her out with, ma\u2019am?\u201d</p><p>Phaedre\u2019s question pulled my attention back to the job at hand. She was squatting by the body, fingering the tangled hair critically.</p><p>\u201cWouldn\u2019t like to put her in the ground lookin\u2019 like this, poor child,\u201d she said, shaking her head.</p><p>I thought Phaedre was likely not much older than the dead woman\u2014and in any case, it scarcely mattered that the corpse should go to its grave well-groomed. Still, I groped in my pocket and came up with a small ivory comb, with which Phaedre set to work, humming under her breath.</p><p>Mr. Campbell was taking his leave. I heard the creak of his team\u2019s harness, and their small stamping of anticipation as the groom settled himself. Mr. Campbell saw me and bowed deeply, hat held low. I sketched him a curtsy in return, and watched with relief as he drove away.</p><p>Phaedre, too, had stopped her work and was gazing after the departing carriage.</p><p>She said something under her breath, and spat in the dust. It was done without apparent malice; a charm against evil that I\u2019d seen before. She looked up at me.</p><p>\u201cMister Jamie best find that Pollyanne afore sunset. Be wild animals in the piney wood, and Mister Ulysses say that woman worth two hundred pound when Miss Jocasta buy her. She don\u2019t know the woods, that Pollyanne; she be come straight from Africa, no more\u2019n a year agone.\u201d</p><p>Without further comment, she bent her head over her task, fingers moving dark and quick as a spider among the fine silk of our corpse\u2019s hair.</p><p>I bent to my work as well, realizing with something of a shock that the web of circumstance that enmeshed Jamie had touched me, too. I did not stand outside, as I had thought, and could not if I wanted to. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Phaedre had helped me to find Pollyanne not because she trusted or liked me\u2014but because I was the master\u2019s wife. Pollyanne must be found and hidden. And Jamie, she thought, would of course find Pollyanne and hide her\u2014she was his property; or Jocasta\u2019s, which in Phaedre\u2019s eyes would amount to the same thing.</p><p>At last, the stranger lay clean, on the worn linen sheet I had brought for a shroud. Phaedre had combed her hair and braided it; I took up the big stone jar of herbs. I had brought them as much from habit as from reason, but now was glad of them; not so much for aid against the progress of decomposition, but as the sole\u2014and necessary\u2014touch of ceremony.</p><p>It was difficult to reconcile this clumsy, reeking lump of clay with the small, cold hand that had grasped mine; with the anguished whisper that had breathed \u201cTell...\u201d in the smothering dark. And yet there was the memory of her, of the last of her living blood spilling hot in my hand, more vivid in my mind than this sight of her empty flesh, nak*d in the hands of strangers.</p><p>There was no minister nearer than Halifax; she would be buried without rites\u2014and yet, what need had she of rites? Funeral rituals are for the comfort of the bereaved. It was unlikely that she had left anyone behind to grieve, I thought; for if she had had anyone so close to her\u2014family, husband, or even lover\u2014I thought she would not now be dead.</p> <p>I had not known her, would not miss her\u2014but I grieved her; her and her child. And so for myself, rather than for her, I knelt by her body and scattered herbs: fragrant and bitter, leaves of rue and hyssop flowers, rosemary, thyme and lavender. A bouquet from the living to the dead\u2014small token of remembrance.</p><p>Phaedre watched in silence, kneeling. Then she reached out and with gentle fingers, laid the shroud across the girl\u2019s dead face. Jamie had come to watch. Without a word, he stooped and picked her up, and bore her to the wagon.</p><p>He didn\u2019t speak until I had climbed up and settled myself on the seat beside him. He snapped the reins on the horses\u2019 backs, and clicked his tongue.</p><p>\u201cLet us go and find the Sergeant,\u201d he said.</p><p>There were, of course, a few things to be attended to first. We returned to River Run to leave Phaedre, and Jamie disappeared to find Duncan and change his stained clothing, while I went to check on my patient and to acquaint Jocasta with the morning\u2019s events.</p> <p>I needn\u2019t have troubled on either account; Farquard Campbell was sitting in the morning room sipping tea with Jocasta. John Myers, his loins swathed in a Cameron plaid, was lounging at full length upon the green velvet chaise, cheerfully munching scones. Judging from the unaccustomed cleanliness of the bare legs and feet extending from the tartan, someone had taken advantage of his temporary state of unconsciousness the night before to administer a bath.</p><p>\u201cMy dear.\u201d Jocasta\u2019s head turned at my step, and she smiled, though I saw the twin lines of concern etched between her brows. \u201cSit you down, child, and take some nourishment; ye will have had no rest last night\u2014and a dreadful morning, it seems.\u201d</p><p>I might ordinarily have found it either amusing or insulting to be called \u201cchild;\u201d under the circumstances, it was oddly comforting. I sank gratefully into an armchair, and let Ulysses pour me a cup of tea, wondering meanwhile just how much Farquard had told Jocasta\u2014and how much he knew.</p><p>\u201cHow are you this morning?\u201d I asked my patient. He appeared to be in amazingly good condition, considering his alcoholic intake of the night before. His color was good, and so was his appetite, judging from the quantity of crumbs on the plate by his side.</p><p>He nodded cordially at me, jaws champing, and swallowed with some effort.</p><p>\u201cAstounding fine, ma\u2019am, I thank ye kindly. A mite sore round the privates\u201d\u2014he tenderly patted the area in question\u2014\u201cbut a sweeter job of stitchin\u2019 I\u2019ve not been privileged to see. Mr. Ulysses was kind enough to fetch me a lookin\u2019 glass,\u201d he explained. He shook his head in some awe. \u201cNever seen my own behind before; as much hair as I got back there, ye\u2019d think my daddy\u2019d been a bear!\u201d</p> <p>He laughed heartily at this, and Farquard Campbell buried a smile in his teacup. Ulysses turned away with the tray, but I saw the corner of his mouth twitch.</p><p>Jocasta laughed out loud, blind eyes crinkling in amusement.</p><p>\u201cThey do say it\u2019s a wise bairn that kens its father, John Quincy. But I kent your mother weel, and I\u2019ll say I think it unlikely.\u201d</p><p>Myers shook his head, but his eyes twinkled over the thick growth of beard.</p><p>\u201cWell, my mama did admire a hairy man. Said it was a rare comfort on a cold winter\u2019s night.\u201d He peered down the open neck of his shirt, viewing the underbrush on display with some satisfaction. \u201cMight be so, at that. The Indian lassies seem to like it\u2014though it\u2019s maybe only the novelty, come to think on it. Their own men scarcely got fuzz on their balls, let alone their backsides.\u201d</p><p>Mr. Campbell inhaled a fragment of scone, and coughed heavily into his napkin. I smiled to myself and took a deep swallow of tea. It was a strong and fragrant Indian blend, and despite the oppressive heat of the morning, more than welcome. A light dew of sweat broke out on my face as I drank, but the warmth settled comfortingly into my uneasy stomach, the perfume of the tea driving the stench of blood and excreta from my nose, even as the cheerful conversation banished the morbid scenes of the morning from my mind.</p><p>I eyed the hearth rug wistfully. I felt as though I could lie down there peacefully and sleep for a week. No rest for the weary, though.</p><p>Jamie came in, freshly shaved and combed, dressed in sober coat and clean linen. He nodded to Farquard Campbell with no apparent surprise; he must have heard his voice from the hallway.</p> <p>\u201cAuntie.\u201d He bent and kissed Jocasta\u2019s cheek in greeting, then smiled at Myers.</p><p>\u201cHow is it, a charaid? Or shall I say, how are they?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight as rain,\u201d Myers assured him. He cupped a hand consideringly between his legs. \u201cThink I might wait a day or two before I climb back on a horse, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would,\u201d Jamie assured him. He turned back to Jocasta. \u201cHave ye maybe seen Duncan this morning, Auntie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, aye. He\u2019s gone a small errand for me, he and the laddie.\u201d She smiled and reached for him; I saw her fingers wrap tight around his wrist. \u201cSuch a dear man, Mr. Innes. So helpful. And such a quick, canny man; a real pleasure to talk to. Do ye not find him so, Nephew?\u201d</p><p>Jamie glanced at her curiously, then his gaze flicked to Farquard Campbell. The older man avoided his eye, sipping at his tea as he affected to study the large painting that hung above the mantel.</p><p>\u201cIndeed,\u201d Jamie said dryly. \u201cA useful man, is Duncan. And Young Ian\u2019s gone with him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo fetch a bittie package for me,\u201d his aunt said placidly. \u201cDid ye need Duncan directly?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Jamie said slowly, staring down at her. \u201cIt can wait.\u201d</p><p>Her fingers slipped free of his sleeve, and she reached for her teacup. The delicate handle was angled precisely toward her, ready for her hand.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good,\u201d she said. \u201cYe\u2019ll have a bite of breakfast, then? And Farquard\u2014another scone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, no, Cha ghabh mi \u2019n c\u00f2rr, tapa leibh. I\u2019ve business in the town, and best I be about it.\u201d Campbell set down his cup and got to his feet, bowing to me and to Jocasta in turn. \u201cYour servant, ladies. Mr. Fraser,\u201d he added, with a lift of one brow, and bowing, he followed Ulysses out.</p><p>Jamie sat down, his own brows raised, and reached for a piece of toast.</p><p>\u201cYour errand, Aunt\u2014Duncan\u2019s gone to find the slave woman?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe has.\u201d Jocasta turned her blind eyes toward him, frowning. \u201cYou\u2019ll not mind, Jamie? I ken Duncan\u2019s your man, but it seemed an urgent matter; and I couldna be sure when you\u2019d come.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did Campbell tell ye?\u201d I could tell what Jamie was thinking; it seemed out of character for the upright and rigid Mr. Campbell, justice of the district, who would not stir a hand to prevent a gruesome lynching, to conspire for the protection of a female slave, and an abortionist to boot. And yet\u2014perhaps he meant it as compensation for what he had not been able to prevent before.</p><p>The handsome shoulders moved in the slightest of shrugs, and a muscle dipped near the corner of her mouth.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve kent Farquard Campbell these twenty years, a mhic mo pheathar. I hear what he doesna say better than what he does.\u201d</p><p>Myers had been following this exchange with interest.</p><p>\u201cCouldn\u2019t say as my own ears are that good,\u201d he observed mildly. \u201cAll I heard him say was how some poor woman kilt herself by accident, up to the mill, tryin\u2019 to rid herself of a burden. He said he didn\u2019t know her, himself.\u201d He smiled blandly at me.</p><p>\u201cAnd that alone tells me the lass is a stranger,\u201d Jocasta observed. \u201cFarquard knows the folk on the river and in the town as well as I ken my own folk. She is no one\u2019s daughter, no one\u2019s servant.\u201d</p><p>She set down her cup and leaned back in her chair with a sigh.</p><p>\u201cIt will be all right,\u201d she said. \u201cEat up your food, lad; ye must be starving.\u201d</p><p>Jamie stared at her for a moment, the piece of toast uneaten in his hand. He leaned forward and dropped it back on the plate.</p><p>\u201cI canna say I\u2019ve much appetite just now, Auntie. Dead lassies curdle my wame a bit.\u201d He stood up, brushing down the skirts of his coat.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s maybe no one\u2019s daughter or servant\u2014but she\u2019s lyin\u2019 in the yard just now, drawing flies. I\u2019d have a name for her before I bury her.\u201d He turned on his heel and stalked out.</p><p>I drained the last of my tea and set the cup back with a faint chime of bone china.</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d I said apologetically. \u201cI don\u2019t believe I\u2019m hungry, either.\u201d</p><p>Jocasta neither moved nor changed expression. As I left the room I saw Myers lean over from his chaise and neatly snag the last of the scones.</p><p>It was nearly noon before we reached the Crown\u2019s warehouse at the end of Hay Street. It stood on the north side of the river, with its own pier for loading, a little way above the town itself. There seemed little necessity for a guard at the moment; nothing moved in the vicinity of the building save a few sulphur butterflies who, unaffected by the smothering heat, were diligently laboring among the flowering bushes that grew thick along the shore.</p><p>\u201cWhat do they keep here?\u201d I asked Jamie, looking curiously up at the massive structure. The huge double doors were shut and bolted, the single red-coated sentry motionless as a tin soldier in front of them. A smaller building beside the warehouse sported an English flag, drooping limply in the heat; presumably this was the lair of the sergeant we were seeking.</p><p>Jamie shrugged and brushed a questing fly away from his eyebrow. We had been attracting more and more of them as the heat of the day increased, despite the movement of the wagon. I sniffed discreetly, but could smell only a faint hint of thyme.</p><p>\u201cWhatever the Crown thinks valuable. Furs from the backcountry, naval stores\u2014pitch and turpentine. But the guard is because of the liquor.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>While every inn brewed its own beer, and every household had its receipts for applejack and cherry-wine, the more potent spirits were the province of the Crown: brandy, whisky, and rum were imported to the colony in small quantities under heavy guard, and sold at great cost under the Crown\u2019s seal.</p><p>\u201cI should say they haven\u2019t got much in stock right now,\u201d I said, nodding at the single guard.</p><p>\u201cNo, the shipments of liquor come upstream from Wilmington once a month. Campbell says they choose a different day each time, so as to run less risk of robbery.\u201d</p><p>He spoke abstractedly, a small frown lingering between his eyebrows.</p> <p>\u201cDid Campbell believe us, do you think? About her doing it herself?\u201d Without really meaning to, I cast a half glance into the wagon behind me.</p><p>Jamie made a derisory Scottish noise in the back of his throat.</p><p>\u201cOf course not, Sassenach; the man\u2019s no a fool. But he\u2019s a good friend to my aunt; he\u2019ll not make trouble if he doesn\u2019t have to. Let\u2019s hope the woman had no one who\u2019ll make a fuss.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRather a cold-blooded hope,\u201d I said quietly. \u201cI thought you felt differently, in your aunt\u2019s drawing room. You\u2019re probably right, though; if she\u2019d had someone, she wouldn\u2019t be dead now.\u201d</p><p>He heard the bitterness in my voice, and looked down at me.</p> <p>\u201cI dinna mean to be callous, Sassenach,\u201d he said gently. \u201cBut the poor lassie is dead. I canna do more for her than see her decently into the ground; it\u2019s the living I must take heed for, aye?\u201d</p><p>I heaved a sigh and squeezed his arm briefly. My feelings were a good deal too complex to try to explain; I had known the girl no more than minutes before her death, and could in no way have prevented it\u2014but she had died under my hands, and I felt the physician\u2019s futile rage in such circumstances; the feeling that somehow I had failed, had been outwitted by the Dark Angel. And beyond rage and pity, was an echo of unspoken guilt; the girl was near Brianna\u2019s age\u2014Brianna, who in like circumstances would also have no one.</p><p>\u201cI know. It\u2019s only...I suppose I feel responsible for her, in a way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo do I,\u201d he said. \u201cNever fear, Sassenach; we\u2019ll see she\u2019s done rightly by.\u201d He reined the horses in under a chestnut tree, and swung down, offering me a hand.</p><p>There were no barracks; Campbell had told Jamie that the warehouse guard\u2019s ten men were quartered in various houses in the town. Upon inquiry of the clerk laboring in the office, we were directed across the street to the sign of the Golden Goose, wherein the Sergeant might presently be found at his luncheon.</p><p>I saw the Sergeant in question at once as I entered the tavern; he was sitting at a table by the window, his white leather stock undone and his tunic unbuttoned, looking thoroughly relaxed over a mug of ale and the remains of a Cornish pasty. Jamie came in behind me, his shadow momentarily blocking the light from the open door, and the Sergeant looked up.</p> <p>Dim as it was in the taproom, I could see the man\u2019s face go blank with shock. Jamie came to an abrupt halt behind me. He said something in Gaelic under his breath that I recognized as a vicious obscenity, but then he was moving forward past me, with no sign of hesitation in his manner.</p><p>\u201cSergeant Murchison,\u201d he said, in tones of mild surprise, as one might greet a casual acquaintance. \u201cI hadna thought to lay eyes on you again\u2014not in this world, at least.\u201d</p><p>The Sergeant\u2019s expression strongly suggested that the feeling had been mutual. Also that any meeting this side of heaven was too soon. Blood flooded his beefy, pockmarked cheeks with red, and he shoved back his bench with a screech of wood on the sanded floor.</p><p>\u201cYou!\u201d he said.</p><p>Jamie took off his hat and inclined his head politely.</p><p>\u201cYour servant, sir,\u201d he said. I could see his face now, outwardly pleasant, but with a wariness that creased the corners of his eyes. He showed it a good deal less, but the Sergeant wasn\u2019t the only one to be taken aback.</p><p>Murchison was regaining his self-possession; the look of shock was replaced by a faint sneer.</p><p>\u201cFraser. Oh, beg pardon, Mr. Fraser, it will be now, won\u2019t it?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt will.\u201d Jamie kept his voice neutral, despite the insulting tone of this. Whatever past conflict lay between them, the last thing he wanted now was trouble. Not with what lay in the wagon outside. I wiped my sweaty palms surreptitiously on my skirt.</p><p>The Sergeant had begun to do up his tunic buttons, slowly, not taking his eyes off Jamie.</p><p>\u201cI had heard there was a man called Fraser, come to leech off Mistress Cameron at River Run,\u201d he said, with an unpleasant twist of thick lips. \u201cThat\u2019ll be you, will it?\u201d</p><p>The wariness in Jamie\u2019s eyes froze into a blue as cold as glacier ice, though his lips stayed curved in a pleasant smile.</p><p>\u201cMistress Cameron will be my kinswoman. It is on her behalf that I have come now.\u201d</p><p>The Sergeant tilted back his head and scratched voluptuously at his throat. There was a deep, hard-edged red crease across the expanse of fat pale flesh, as though someone had tried unsuccessfully to garrote the man.</p><p>\u201cYour kinswoman. Well, easy to say so, ain\u2019t it? The lady\u2019s blind as a bat, I hear. No husband, no sons; fair prey for any sharpster comes a-calling, claiming family.\u201d The sergeant lowered his head and smirked at me, his self-possession fully restored.</p><p>\u201cAnd this\u2019ll be your doxy, will it?\u201d It was gratuitous malice, a shot at random; the man had scarcely glanced at me.</p><p>\u201cThis will be my wife, Mistress Fraser.\u201d</p><p>I could see the two stiff fingers of Jamie\u2019s right hand twitch once against the skirt of his coat, the only outward sign of his feelings. He tilted his head back an inch and raised his brows, considering the Sergeant with an air of dispassionate interest.</p><p>\u201cAnd which one are you, sir? I beg pardon for my imperfect recollection, but I confess that I cannot tell you from your brother.\u201d</p><p>The Sergeant stopped as though he had been shot, frozen in the act of fastening his stock.</p><p>\u201cDamn you!\u201d he said, choking on the words. His face had gone an unhealthy shade of plum, and I thought that he ought really to mind his blood pressure. I didn\u2019t say so, though.</p><p>At this point, the Sergeant seemed to notice that everyone in the taproom was staring at him with great interest. He glared ferociously around him, snatched up his hat, and stamped toward the door, pushing past me as he went, so that I staggered back a pace.</p><p>Jamie grabbed my arm to steady me, then ducked beneath the lintel himself. I followed, in time to see him call after the Sergeant.</p><p>\u201cMurchison! A word with you!\u201d</p><p>The soldier whirled on his heel, hands fisted against the skirts of his scarlet coat. He was a good-sized man, thick through torso and shoulder, and the uniform became him. His eyes glittered with menace, but he had gained possession of himself again.</p><p>\u201cA word, is it?\u201d he said. \u201cAnd what might you have to say to me, Mister Fraser?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA word in your professional capacity, Sergeant,\u201d Jamie said coolly. He nodded toward the wagon, which we had left beneath a nearby tree. \u201cWe\u2019ve brought ye a corpse.\u201d</p><p>For the second time, the Sergeant\u2019s face went blank. He glanced at the wagon; flies and gnats had begun to gather in small clouds, circling lazily over the open bed.</p><p>\u201cIndeed.\u201d He was a professional; while the hostility of his manner was undiminished, the hot blood faded from his face, and the clenched fists relaxed.</p><p>\u201cA corpse? Whose?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have no idea, sir. It was my hope that you might be able to tell us. Will ye look?\u201d He nodded toward the wagon, and after a moment\u2019s hesitation, the Sergeant nodded briefly back, and strode toward the wagon.</p><p>I hurried after Jamie, and was in time to see the Sergeant\u2019s face as he drew back the corner of the makeshift shroud. He had no skill at all in hiding his feelings\u2014perhaps in his profession it wasn\u2019t necessary. Shock flickered over his face like summer lightning.</p><p>Jamie, could see the Sergeant\u2019s face as well as I.</p><p>\u201cYe\u2019ll know her, then?\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2014she\u2014that is...yes, I know her.\u201d The Sergeant\u2019s mouth snapped shut abruptly, as though he was afraid to let any more words out. He continued to stare at the girl\u2019s dead face, his own tightening, freezing out all feeling.</p><p>A few men had followed us out of the tavern. While they stayed at a discreet distance, two or three were craning their necks with curiosity. It wasn\u2019t going to be long before the whole district knew what had happened at the mill. I hoped Duncan and Ian were well on their way.</p><p>\u201cWhat has happened to her?\u201d the Sergeant asked, staring down at the fixed white face. His own was nearly as pale.</p><p>Jamie was watching him intently, and making no pretense otherwise.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll know her, then?\u201d he said again.</p><p>\u201cShe is\u2014she was\u2014a laundress. Lissa\u2014Lissa Garver is her name.\u201d The Sergeant spoke mechanically, still looking down into the wagon as though unable to tear his eyes away. His face was expressionless but his lips were white, and his hands were clenched into fists at his sides. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHas she people in the town? A husband, maybe?\u201d</p><p>It was a reasonable question, but Murchison\u2019s head jerked up as though Jamie had stabbed him with it.</p><p>\u201cNone of your concern, is it?\u201d he said. He stared at Jamie, a thin rim of white visible around the iris of his eye. He bared his teeth in what might have been politeness, but wasn\u2019t. \u201cTell me what happened to her.\u201d</p><p>Jamie\u2019s eyes met the Sergeant\u2019s without blinking.</p><p>\u201cShe meant to slip a bairn, and it went wrong,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cIf she has a husband, he must be told. If not\u2014if she has no people\u2014I will see her decently buried.\u201d</p><p>Murchison turned his head to look down into the wagon once more.</p><p>\u201cShe has someone,\u201d he said shortly. \u201cYou need not trouble yourself.\u201d He turned away, and rubbed a hand over his face, scrubbing violently as though to wipe away all feeling. \u201cGo to my office,\u201d he said, voice half muffled. \u201cYou must make a statement\u2014see the clerk. Go!\u201d</p><p>The office was empty, the clerk no doubt gone in search of his own luncheon. I sat down to wait, but Jamie prowled restlessly around the small room, eyes flitting from the regimental banners on the wall to the drawered cabinet in the corner behind the desk.</p><p>\u201cDamn the luck,\u201d he said, half to himself. \u201cIt would have to be Murchison.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI take it you know the Sergeant well?\u201d</p><p>He glanced at me with a wry quirk of the lips.</p><p>\u201cWell enough. He was in the garrison at Ardsmuir prison.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d No love lost between them, then. It was close in the little office; I blotted a trickle of sweat that ran down between my br**sts. \u201cWhat do you suppose he\u2019s doing here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat much I ken; he was sent in charge of the prisoners when they were transported to be sold. I imagine the Crown saw no good reason to bring him back to England, when there was need of soldiers here\u2014that would have been during the war wi\u2019 the French, aye?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat was that business about his brother?\u201d</p><p>He snorted, a brief, humorless sound.</p><p>\u201cThere were two o\u2019 them\u2014twins. Wee Billy and Wee Bobby, we called them. Alike as peas, and not only in looks.\u201d</p><p>He paused, marshaling memories. He didn\u2019t often speak of his time in Ardsmuir, and I could see the shadows of it pass across his face.</p> <p>\u201cYe\u2019ll maybe know the sort of man is decent enough on his own, but get him wi\u2019 others like him, and they might as well be wolves?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBit hard on the wolves,\u201d I said, smiling. \u201cThink of Rollo. But yes, I know what you mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPigs, then. But beasts, when they\u2019re together. There\u2019s no lack of such men in any army; it\u2019s why armies work\u2014men will do terrible things in a mob, that they wouldna dream of on their own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the Murchisons were never on their own?\u201d I asked slowly.</p><p>He gave me a slight nod of acknowledgment.</p> <p>\u201cAye, that\u2019s it. There were the two of them, always. And what one might scruple at, the other would not. And of course, when it came to trouble\u2014why, there was no saying which was to blame, was there?\u201d</p><p>He was still prowling, restless as a caged panther. He paused by the window, looking out.</p><p>\u201cI\u2014the prisoners\u2014we might complain of ill-treatment, but the officers couldna discipline both for the sins of one, and a man seldom knew which Murchison it was that had him on the ground wi\u2019 a boot in the ribs, or which it was that hung him from a hook by his fetters and left him so until he\u2019d soil himself for the amusement of the garrison.\u201d</p><p>His eyes were fixed on something outside, his expression unguarded. He\u2019d spoken of beasts; I could see that the memories had roused one. His eyes caught the light from the window, gem-blue and unblinking.</p><p>\u201cAre both of them here?\u201d I asked, as much to break that unnerving stare as because I wanted to know.</p><p>It worked; he turned abruptly from the window.</p> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said, shortly. \u201cThis is Billy. Wee Bobby died at Ardsmuir.\u201d His two stiff fingers twitched against the fabric of his kilt.</p><p>It had occurred to me briefly to wonder why he had worn his kilt this morning, instead of changing to breeks; the crimson tartan might be quite literally a red flag to a bull, flaunted thus before an English soldier. Now I knew.</p><p>They\u2019d taken it from him once before, thinking to take with it pride and manhood. They had failed in that attempt, and he meant to underscore that failure, whether it was sense to do so or not. Sense had little to do with the sort of stubborn pride that could survive years of such insult\u2014and while he had more than his share of both, I could see that pride was well in the ascendancy at present.</p><p>\u201cFrom the Sergeant\u2019s reactions, I suppose we may assume it wasn\u2019t natural causes?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said. He sighed and shrugged his shoulders slightly, easing them inside the tight coat.</p><p>\u201cThey marched us out to the stone quarry each morning, and back again at twilight, wi\u2019 two or three guards to each wagon. One day, Wee Bobby Murchison was the sergeant in charge. He came out wi\u2019 us in the morning\u2014but he didna come back with us at night.\u201d He glanced once more at the window. \u201cThere was a verra deep pool at the bottom of the quarry.\u201d</p><p>His matter-of-fact tone was nearly as chilling as the content of this bald account. I felt a small shiver pass up my spine, in spite of the stifling heat.</p><p>\u201cDid you\u2014\u201d I began, but he put a finger to his lips, jerking his head toward the door. A moment later, I heard the footsteps that his keener ears had picked up.</p> <p>It was the Sergeant, not his clerk. He had been perspiring heavily; streaks of sweat ran down his face beneath his wig, and his whole countenance was the unhealthy color of fresh beef liver.</p><p>He glanced at the vacant desk, and made a small, vicious noise in his throat. I felt a qualm on behalf of the absent clerk. The Sergeant shoved aside the clutter on the desk with a sweep of his arm that sent paper cascading onto the floor.</p><p>He snatched a pewter inkwell and a sheet of foolscap from the rubble, and banged them down on the desk.</p><p>\u201cWrite it down,\u201d he ordered. \u201cWhere you found her, what happened.\u201d He thrust a spattered goose-quill at Jamie. \u201cSign it, date it.\u201d</p><p>Jamie stared at him, eyes narrowed, but made no move to take the quill. I felt a sudden sinking in my belly.</p><p>Jamie was left-handed but had been taught forcibly to write with his right hand, and then had that right hand crippled. Writing, for him, was a slow, laborious business that left the pages blotted, sweat-stained, and crumpled, and the writer himself in no better case. There was no power on earth that would make him humiliate himself in that fashion before the Sergeant.</p><p>\u201cWrite. It. Down.\u201d The Sergeant bit off the words between his teeth.</p><p>Jamie\u2019s eyes narrowed further, but before he could speak, I reached out and snatched the pen from the Sergeant\u2019s grasp.</p><p>\u201cI was there; let me do it.\u201d</p><p>Jamie\u2019s hand closed on mine before I could dip the quill in the inkwell. He plucked the pen from my fingers and dropped it in the center of the desk.</p><p>\u201cYour clerk can wait upon me later, at my aunt\u2019s house,\u201d he said briefly to Murchison. \u201cCome with me, Claire.\u201d</p><p>Not waiting for an answer from the Sergeant, he grasped my elbow and all but pulled me to my feet. We were outside before I knew what had happened. The wagon still stood under the tree, but now it was empty.</p><p>\u201cWell, she\u2019s safe for the moment, Mac Dubh, but what in hell shall we do with the woman?\u201d Duncan scratched at the stubble on his chin; he and Ian had spent three days in the forest, searching, before finding the slave Pollyanne.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019ll no be easy to move,\u201d Ian put in, snaring a piece of bacon off the breakfast table. He broke it in half, and handed one piece to Rollo. \u201cThe poor lady near died of terror when Rollo sniffed her out, and we had God\u2019s own time gettin\u2019 her on her feet. We couldna get her on a horse at all; I had to walk with my arm around her, to keep her from fallin\u2019 down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe must get her clear away, somehow.\u201d Jocasta frowned, blank eyes half hooded in thought. \u201cYon Murchison was at the mill again yesterday morning, making a nuisance of himself, and last night, Farquard Campbell sent to tell me that the man has declared it was murder, and he\u2019s called for men to search the district for the slave who did it. Farquard\u2019s sae hot under his collar, I thought his head would burst into flame.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo ye think she could have done it?\u201d Chewing, Ian looked from Jamie to me. \u201cBy accident, I mean?\u201d</p><p>In spite of the hot morning, I shuddered, feeling in memory the unyielding stiffness of the metal skewer in my hand.</p><p>\u201cYou have three possibilities: accident, murder, or suicide,\u201d I said. \u201cThere are lots easier ways of committing suicide, believe me. And no motive for murder, that we know of.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe that as it may,\u201d Jamie said, neatly fielding the conversation, \u201cif Murchison takes the slave woman, he\u2019ll have her hanged or flogged to death within a day. He\u2019s no need of trial. No, we must take her clear out of the district. I\u2019ve arranged it with our friend Myers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve arranged what with Myers?\u201d Jocasta asked sharply, her voice cutting through the babble of exclamations and questions that greeted this announcement.</p><p>Jamie finished buttering the piece of toast that he held, and handed it to Duncan before speaking.</p><p>\u201cWe shall take the woman into the mountains,\u201d he said. \u201cMyers says she\u2019ll be welcome among the Indians; he kens a good place for her, he says. And she\u2019ll be safe there from Wee Billy Murchison.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe?\u201d I asked politely. \u201cAnd who\u2019s we?\u201d</p><p>He grinned at me in reply.</p><p>\u201cMyers and myself, Sassenach. I need to go to the backcountry to have a look before the cold weather comes, and this will be a good chance. Myers is the best guide I could have.\u201d</p><p>He carefully refrained from noting that it might be as well for him to be temporarily out of Sergeant Murchison\u2019s sphere of influence, but the implication was not lost on me.</p><p>\u201cYe\u2019ll take me, will ye not, Uncle?\u201d Ian brushed the matted hair out of his face, looking eager. \u201cYe\u2019ll need help wi\u2019 that woman, believe me\u2014she\u2019s the size of a molasses barrel.\u201d</p><p>Jamie smiled at his nephew.</p><p>\u201cAye, Ian. I expect we can use another man along.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAhem,\u201d I said, giving him an evil stare.</p><p>\u201cTo keep an eye on your auntie, if nothing else,\u201d Jamie continued, giving the stare back to me. \u201cWe leave in three days, Sassenach\u2014if Myers can sit a horse by then.\u201d</p><p>Three days didn\u2019t allow much time, but with the assistance of Myers and Phaedre, my preparations were completed with hours to spare. I had a small traveling box of medicines and tools, and the saddlebags were packed with food, blankets, and cooking implements. The only small matter remaining was that of attire.</p><p>I recrossed the ends of the long silk strip across my chest, tied the ends in a jaunty knot between my br**sts, and examined the results in the looking glass.</p><p>Not bad. I extended my arms and jiggled my torso from side to side, testing. Yes, that would do. Though perhaps if I took one more turn around my chest before crossing the ends...</p><p>\u201cWhat, exactly, are ye doing, Sassenach? And what in the name of God are ye wearing?\u201d Jamie, arms crossed, was leaning against the door, watching me with both brows raised.</p><p>\u201cI am improvising a brassiere,\u201d I said with dignity. \u201cI don\u2019t mean to ride sidesaddle through the mountains wearing a dress, and if I\u2019m not wearing stays, I don\u2019t mean my br**sts to be joggling all the way, either. Most uncomfortable, joggling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI daresay.\u201d He edged into the room and circled me at a cautious distance, eyeing my nether limbs with interest. \u201cAnd what are those?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike them?\u201d I put my hands on my hips, modeling the drawstring leather trousers that Phaedre had constructed for me\u2014laughing hysterically as she did so\u2014from soft buckskin provided by one of Myers\u2019s friends in Cross Creek.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said bluntly. \u201cYe canna be going about in\u2014in\u2014\u201d He waved at them, speechless.</p><p>\u201cTrousers,\u201d I said. \u201cAnd of course I can. I wore trousers all the time, back in Boston. They\u2019re very practical.\u201d</p><p>He looked at me in silence for a moment. Then, very slowly, he walked around me. At last, his voice came from behind me.</p><p>\u201cYe wore them outside?\u201d he said, in tones of incredulity. \u201cWhere folk could see ye?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did,\u201d I said crossly. \u201cSo did most other women. Why not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d he said, scandalized. \u201cI can see the whole shape of your buttocks, for God\u2019s sake, and the cleft between!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can see yours, too,\u201d I pointed out, turning around to face him. \u201cI\u2019ve been looking at your backside in breeks every day for months, but only occasionally does the sight move me to make indecent advances on your person.\u201d</p><p>His mouth twitched, undecided whether to laugh or not. Taking advantage of the indecision, I took a step forward and put my arms around his waist, firmly cupping his backside. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cActually, it\u2019s your kilt that makes me want to fling you to the floor and commit ravishment,\u201d I told him. \u201cBut you don\u2019t look at all bad in your breeks.\u201d</p><p>He did laugh then, and bending, kissed me thoroughly, his hands carefully exploring the outlines of my rear, snugly confined in buckskin. He squeezed gently, making me squirm against him.</p><p>\u201cTake them off,\u201d he said, pausing for air.</p><p>\u201cBut I\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTake them off,\u201d he repeated firmly.

There was little chance of anyone noticing\u2014other than Campbell\u2019s slaves, who already knew\u2014but we took care to arrive just after dark, when the lavender sky had faded nearly to gray, barely outlining the dark bulk of the drying shed.</p><p>The woman slid out like a ghost, cloaked and hooded, and was hoisted onto the extra horse, bundled hastily aboard like the package of contraband she was. She drew up her legs and clung to the saddle with both hands, doubled up in a ball of panic; evidently she\u2019d never been on a horse before.</p><p>Myers tried to hand her the reins, but she paid no attention, only clung tight and moaned in a sort of melodic agony of terror. The men were becoming restive, glancing over their shoulders into the empty fields, as though expecting the imminent arrival of Sergeant Murchison and his minions.</p><p>\u201cLet her ride with me,\u201d I suggested. \u201cMaybe she\u2019ll feel safer that way.\u201d</p><p>The woman was detached from her mount with some difficulty and set down on the horse\u2019s rump behind my saddle. She smelt strongly of fresh tobacco leaves, pungently narcotic, and something else, a little muskier. She at once flung her arms around my waist, holding on for dear life. I patted one of the hands clutched about my middle, and she squeezed tighter, but made no other move or sound.</p> <p>Little wonder if she was terrified, I thought, turning my horse\u2019s head to follow Myers\u2019s. She might not know about the hullabaloo Murchison was raising in the district, but she could have no illusions about what might happen if she was caught; she had certainly been among the crowd at the sawmill two weeks earlier.</p><p>As an alternative to certain death, flight into the arms of red savages might be slightly preferable, but not by much, to judge from her trembling; the weather was far from cold, but she shook as though with chill.</p><p>She nearly squeezed the stuffings out of me when Rollo appeared, stalking out of the bushes like some demon of the forest. My horse didn\u2019t like the look of him, either, and backed up, snorting and stamping, trying to jerk the reins away from me.</p><p>I had to admit that Rollo was reasonably fearsome, even when he was in an amiable mood, which he was, at the moment\u2014Rollo loved expeditions. Still, he undoubtedly presented a sinister aspect; all his teeth were showing in a grin of delight, his slitted eyes half closed as he whiffed the air. Add to that the way the grays and blacks of his coat faded into the shadows, and one was left with the queer and unsettling illusion that he had materialized out of the substance of the night, Appetite incarnate.</p><p>He trotted directly past us, no more than a foot away, and the woman gasped, her breath hot on my neck. I patted her hand again, and spoke to her, but she made no answer. Duncan had said she was Africa-born and spoke little English, but surely she must understand a few words.</p><p>\u201cIt will be all right,\u201d I said again. \u201cDon\u2019t be afraid.\u201d</p><p>Occupied with horse and passenger, I hadn\u2019t noticed Jamie, until he appeared suddenly by my stirrup, light-footed as Rollo.</p><p>\u201cAll right, Sassenach?\u201d he asked softly, putting a hand on my thigh.</p> <p>\u201cI think so,\u201d I said. I nodded at the death-grip round my middle. \u201cIf I don\u2019t die of suffocation.\u201d</p><p>He looked, and smiled.</p><p>\u201cWell, she\u2019s in no danger of fallin\u2019 off, at least.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish I knew something to say to her; poor thing, she\u2019s so afraid. Do you suppose she even knows where we\u2019re taking her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI shouldna think so\u2014I dinna ken where we\u2019re going.\u201d He wore breeks for riding, but had his plaid belted over them, the free end slung across the shoulder of his coat. The dark tartan blended into the shadows of the forest as well as it had the shades of the Scottish heather; all I could see of him was a white blotch of shirt-front and the pale oval of his face.</p><p>\u201cDo you know any useful taki-taki to say to her?\u201d I asked. \u201cOf course, she might not know that, either, if she wasn\u2019t brought through the Indies.\u201d</p><p>He turned his head and looked up at my passenger, considering.</p><p>\u201cAh,\u201d he said. \u201cWell, there\u2019s the one thing they\u2019ll all know, no matter where they\u2019ve come.\u201d He reached out and squeezed the woman\u2019s foot firmly.</p><p>\u201cFreedom,\u201d he said, and paused. \u201cSaorasa. D\u2019yke ken what I say?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t loosen her grip, but her breath went out in a shuddering sigh, and I thought I felt her nod.</p><p>The horses followed each other in single file, Myers in the lead. The rough track was not even a wagon trail, only a sort of flattening of under-growth, but it did at least provide clear passage through the trees.</p><p>I doubted that Sergeant Murchison\u2019s vengeance would pursue us so far\u2014if he pursued us at all\u2014but the sense of escape was too strong to ignore. We shared an unspoken but pervasive sense of urgency, and with no particular discussion, agreed to ride on as far as possible.</p><p>My passenger was either losing her fear or simply becoming too tired to care anymore; after a midnight stop for refreshment she allowed Ian and Myers to boost her back on the horse without protest, and while she never released her hold on my waist, she did seem to doze now and then, her forehead pressed against my shoulder.</p><p>The fatigue of long riding crept over me, too, aided by the hypnotic soft thudding of the horses\u2019 feet, and the unending susurrus of the pines overhead. We were still in the longleaf forest, and the tall, straight trunks surrounded us like the masts of long-sunk ships.</p><p>Lines of an ancient Scottish song drifted through my mind\u2014\u201cHow many strawberries grow in the salt sea; how many ships sail in the forest?\u201d\u2014and I wondered muzzily whether the composer had walked through a place like this, unearthly in half-moon and starlight, so dreamlike that the borders between the elements were lost; we might as well be afloat as earthbound, the heave and fall beneath me the rise of planking, and the sound of the pines the wind in our sails.</p><p>We stopped at dawn, unsaddled the horses, hobbled them, and left them to feed in the long grass of a small meadow. I found Jamie, and curled up at once into a nest of grass beside him, the horses\u2019 peaceful champing the last thing I heard.</p><p>We slept heavily through the heat of the day, and awoke near sunset, stiff, thirsty, and covered with ticks. I was profoundly thankful that the ticks seemed to share the mosquitoes\u2019 general distaste for my flesh, but I had learned on our trip north to check Jamie and the others every time we slept; there were always outriders.</p><p>\u201cIck,\u201d I said, examining a particularly juicy specimen, the size of a grape, nestling amid the soft cinnamon hair of Jamie\u2019s underarm. \u201cDamn, I\u2019m afraid to pull that one; it\u2019s so full it\u2019ll likely burst.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged, busy exploring his scalp with the other hand, in search of further intruders.</p><p>\u201cLeave it while ye deal with the rest,\u201d he suggested. \u201cPerhaps it will fall of its own accord.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose I\u2019d better,\u201d I agreed reluctantly. I hadn\u2019t any objection to the tick\u2019s bursting, but not while its jaws were still embedded in Jamie\u2019s flesh. I\u2019d seen infections caused by forcibly interrupted ticks, and they weren\u2019t anything I wanted to deal with in the middle of a forest. I had only a rudimentary medical kit with me\u2014though this luckily included a very fine pair of small tweezer-pointed forceps from Dr. Rawlings\u2019s box.</p><p>Myers and Ian seemed to be managing all right; both stripped to the waist, Myers was crouched over the boy like a huge black baboon, fingers busy in Ian\u2019s hair.</p><p>\u201cHere\u2019s a wee one,\u201d Jamie said, bending over and pushing his own hair aside so I could reach the small dark bleb behind his ear. I was engaged in gently maneuvering the creature out, when I became aware of a presence near my elbow.</p><p>I had been too tired to take much notice of our fugitive when we made camp, rightly assuming that she wasn\u2019t going to wander off into the wilderness by herself. She had wandered as far as a nearby stream, though, returning with a bucket of water.</p><p>She set this on the ground, dipped up a handful of water and funneled it into her mouth. She chewed vigorously for a moment, cheeks puffed out. Then she motioned me aside and, lifting a surprised Jamie\u2019s arm, spat forcefully and profusely into his armpit.</p><p>She reached into the dripping hollow, and with delicate fingers appeared to tickle the parasite. She certainly tickled Jamie, who was very sensitive in that particular region. He turned pink in the face and flinched at her touch, all the muscles in his torso quivering.</p><p>She held tight to his wrist, though, and within seconds, the bulging tick dropped off into the palm of her hand. She flicked it disdainfully away, and turned to me, with a small air of satisfaction.</p><p>I had thought she resembled a ball, muffled in her cloak. Seen without it, she still did. She was very short, no more than four feet, and nearly as wide, with a close-cropped head like a cannonball, her cheeks so round that her eyes were slanted above them.</p><p>She looked like nothing so much as one of the carved African fertility images I had seen in the Indies; massive of bosom, heavy of haunch, and the rich, burnt-coffee color of a Congolese, with skin so flawless that it looked like polished stone under its thin layer of sweat. She held out her hand to me, showing me a few small objects in her palm, the general size and shape of dried lima beans.</p><p>\u201cPaw-paw,\u201d she said, in a voice so deep that even Myers turned his head toward her, startled. It was a huge, rich voice, reverberant as a drum. Seeing my reaction to it, she smiled a little shyly, and said something I didn\u2019t quite understand, though I knew it was Gaelic.</p><p>\u201cShe says ye must not swallow the seeds, for they\u2019re poison,\u201d Jamie translated, eyeing her rather warily as he wiped his armpit with the end of his plaid.</p><p>\u201cHau,\u201d Pollyanne agreed, nodding vigorously. \u201cPoi-zin.\u201d She stooped over the bucket for another handful of water, washed it round her mouth, and spat it at a rock with a noise like a gunshot.</p><p>\u201cYou could be dangerous with that,\u201d I told her. I didn\u2019t know whether she understood me, but she gathered from my smile that I meant to be cordial; she smiled back, popped two more of the paw-paw seeds into her mouth, and beckoned to Myers, already chewing, the seeds making little crunching pops as she pulverized them between her teeth.</p><p>By the time we had eaten supper and were ready to leave, she was nervously willing to try riding alone. Jamie coaxed her to the horse, and showed her how to let the beast smell her. She trembled as the big nose nudged her, but then the horse snorted; she jumped, giggled in a voice like honey poured out of a jug, and allowed Jamie and Ian between them to boost her aboard. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Pollyanne remained shy of the men, but she soon gained enough confidence to talk to me, in a polyglot mixture of Gaelic, English, and her own language. I couldn\u2019t have translated it, but both her face and body were so expressive that I could often gather the sense of what she was saying, even though I understood only one word in ten. I could only regret that I was not equally fluent in body language; she didn\u2019t understand most of my questions and remarks, so I had to wait until we made camp, when I could prevail on Jamie or Ian to help me with bits of Gaelic.</p><p>Freed\u2014at least temporarily\u2014from the constraint of terror, and becoming cautiously secure in our company, a naturally effervescent personality emerged, and she talked with abandon as we rode side by side, regardless of my comprehension, laughing now and then with a low hooting noise like wind blowing across the mouth of a cave.</p><p>She became subdued only once: when we passed through a large clearing where the grass rose in strange undulant mounds, as though a great serpent lay buried underneath. Pollyanne went silent when she saw them, and in an effort to hurry her horse, instead succeeded only in pulling on the reins and stopping it dead. I rode back to help her.</p><p>\u201cDroch \u00e0ite,\u201d she murmured, glancing out of the corner of her eye at the silent mounds. A bad place. \u201cDjudju.\u201d She scowled, and made a small, quick gesture with her hand, some sign against evil, I thought.</p> <p>\u201cIs it a graveyard?\u201d I asked Myers, who had circled back to see why we had stopped. The mounds were not evenly spaced, but were distributed around the edge of the clearing in a pattern that didn\u2019t look like any natural formation. The mounds seemed too large to be graves, though\u2014unless they were cairns, such as the ancient Scots built, or mass graves, I thought, uneasy at the memory of Culloden.</p><p>\u201cNot to say graveyard,\u201d he replied, pushing his hat back on his head. \u201c \u2019Twas a village once. Tuscarora, I expect. Those rises there\u201d\u2014he waved a hand\u2014\u201cthose are houses, fallen down. The big \u2019un to the side, that will have been the chief\u2019s longhouse. It be taken no time atall, the grasses come over it. From the looks, though, this \u2019un will have been buried a time back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened to it?\u201d Ian and Jamie had stopped, too, and come back to look over the small clearing.</p><p>Myers scratched thoughtfully at his beard.</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t be sayin\u2019, not for certain sure. Might be as sickness drove \u2019em out, might be as they were put to rout by the Cherokee or the Creek, though we be a mite north of the Cherokee land. Most likely as it happened during the war, though.\u201d He dug fiercely into his beard, twisted, and flicked away the remnants of a lingering tick. \u201cCan\u2019t say as it\u2019s a place I\u2019d tarry by choice.\u201d</p> <p>Pollyanne being plainly of the same mind, we rode on. By evening, we had passed entirely out of the pines and scrubby oakland of the foothills. We were climbing in good earnest now, and the trees began to change; small groves of chestnut trees, large patches of oak and hickory, with scattered dogwood and persimmon, chinkapin and poplar, surrounded us in waves of feathery green.</p><p>The smell and feel of the air changed, too, as we rose. The overwhelming hot resins of the pine trees gave way to lighter, more varied scents, tree leaves mingled with whiffs of the shrubs and flowers that grew from every crevice of the craggy rocks. It was still damp and humid, but not so hot; the air no longer seemed a smothering blanket, but something we might breathe\u2014and breathe with pleasure, filled as it was with the perfumes of leaf mold, sun-warmed leaves, and damp moss.</p><p>By sunset of the sixth day, we were well into the mountains, and the air was full of the sound of running water. Streams crisscrossed the valleys, spilling off ridges and trickling down the steep rock faces, trailing mist and moss like a delicate green fringe. When we rounded the side of one steep hill, I stopped in amazement; from the side of a distant mountain, a waterfall leapt into the air, arching a good eighty feet in its fall to the gorge far below.</p><p>\u201cWill ye look at that, now?\u201d Ian was openmouthed with awe.</p><p>\u201c \u2019Tis right pretty,\u201d Myers allowed, with the smug complacence of a proprietor. \u201cAin\u2019t the biggest falls I\u2019ve seen, but it\u2019s nice enough.\u201d</p><p>Ian turned his head, eyes wide.</p> <p>\u201cThere are bigger ones?\u201d</p><p>Myers laughed, a mountain man\u2019s quiet laugh, no more than a breath of sound.</p><p>\u201cBoy, you ain\u2019t seen nothin\u2019 yet.\u201d</p><p>We camped for the night in a hollow near a good-sized creek\u2014one big enough for trout. Jamie and Ian waded into this with enthusiasm, harrying the finny denizens with whippy rods cut from black willow. I hoped they would have some luck; our fresh provisions were running low, though we still had plenty of cornmeal left.</p><p>Pollyanne came scrambling up the bank, bringing a bucket of water with which to make a new batch of corn dodgers. These were small oblongs of rough cornmeal biscuit made for traveling; tasty when fresh and hot, and at least edible the next day. They became steadily less appetizing with time, resembling nothing so much as small chunks of cement by the fourth day. Still, they were portable, and not prone to mold, and thus were popular traveling fare, along with dried beef and salt pork.</p><p>Pollyanne\u2019s natural ebullience seemed a trifle subdued, her round face shadowed. Her eyebrows were so sketchy as to be almost nonexistent, which had the paradoxical effect of increasing the expressiveness of her face in motion, and wiping all expression from it in repose. She could be as impassive as a ball bearing when she wanted to; a useful skill for a slave.</p><p>I supposed that her preoccupation was at least in part because this was the last night on which we would all be together. We had reached the backcountry, the limits of the King\u2019s land; tomorrow, Myers would turn to the north, taking her across the spine of the mountains into the Indian lands, to find what safety and what life she might there.</p><p>Her round dark head was bent over the wooden bowl, stubby fingers mixing cornmeal with water and lard. I crouched across from her, feeding small sticks to the infant fire, the black iron girdle standing ready-greased beside it. Myers had gone off to smoke a pipe; I could hear Jamie call to Ian somewhere downstream, and a faint answering laugh.</p> <p>It was deep twilight by now; our hollow was ringed by brooding mountains, and darkness seemed to fill the shallow bowl, creeping up the trunks of the trees around us. I had no notion of the place she had come from, whether it might be forest or jungle, seashore or desert, but I thought it unlikely to be much like this.</p><p>What could she be thinking? She had survived the journey from Africa, and slavery; I supposed whatever lay ahead couldn\u2019t be much worse. It was an unknown future, though\u2014going into a wilderness so vast and absolute that I felt every moment as though I might vanish into it, consumed without a trace. Our fire seemed the merest spark against the vastness of the night.</p><p>Rollo strolled into the light of the fire and shook himself, spraying water in all directions, making the fire hiss and spit. He had joined in the fishing, I saw.</p><p>\u201cGo away, horrible dog,\u201d I said. He didn\u2019t, of course; simply came up and nosed me rudely, to be sure I was still who he thought I was, then turned to give Pollyanne the same treatment.</p><p>With no particular expression, she turned her head and spat in his eye. He yelped, backed up, and stood shaking his head, looking thoroughly surprised. She looked up at me and grinned, her teeth very white in her face.</p><p>I laughed, and decided not to worry too much; anyone capable of spitting in a wolf\u2019s eye would likely cope with Indians, wilderness, and anything else that came along.</p><p>The bowl was nearly empty, a neat row of corn dodgers laid on the girdle. Pollyanne wiped her fingers on a handful of grass, watching the yellow cornmeal begin to sizzle and turn brown as the lard melted. A warm, comforting smell rose from the fire, mingled with the scent of burning wood, and my belly rumbled softly in anticipation. The fire seemed more substantial now, the scent of cooking food spreading its warmth in a wider circle, keeping the night at bay.</p><p>Had it been this way where she came from? Had fires and food held back a jungle darkness, kept away leopards instead of bears? Had light and company given comfort, and the illusion of safety? For illusion it had surely been\u2014fire was no protection against men, or the darkness that had overtaken her. I had no words to ask.</p><p>\u201cI have never seen such fishing, never,\u201d Jamie repeated for the fourth time, a look of dreamy bliss on his face as he broke open a steaming trout fried in cornmeal. \u201cThey were swarming in the water, were they not, Ian?\u201d</p><p>Ian nodded, a similar look of reverence on his own homely features.</p><p>\u201cMy Da would give his other leg to ha\u2019 seen it,\u201d he said. \u201cThey jumped on the hook, Auntie, truly!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Indians don\u2019t generally bother with hook and line,\u201d Myers put in, neatly spearing his own share of fish with his knife. \u201cThey build snares and fish traps, or sometimes they\u2019ll put some sticks and rubbish crost the creek to prevent the fish, then stand above with a sharp stick, just spearin\u2019 them from the water.\u201d</p><p>That was enough for Ian; any mention of Indians and their ways provoked a rash of eager questions. Having exhausted the methods of fish-catching, he asked again about the abandoned village we had seen earlier in our journey.</p><p>\u201cYe said it might have happened in the war,\u201d Ian said, lifting the bones from a steaming trout, then shaking his fingers to cool them. He passed a section of the boneless flesh to Rollo, who swallowed it in a single gulp, temperature notwithstanding. \u201cWill that ha\u2019 been the war wi\u2019 the French, then? I didna ken there was any fighting so far south.\u201d</p><p>Myers shook his head, chewing and swallowing before he answered.</p><p>\u201cOh, no. It\u2019ll be the Tuscarora War I was meanin\u2019; that\u2019s how they call it on the white side, at least.\u201d</p><p>The Tuscarora War, he explained, had been a short-lived but brutal conflict some forty years before, brought on by an attack upon some backcountry settlers. The then governor of the colony had sent troops into the Tuscarora villages in retaliation, and the upshot was a series of pitched battles that the colonists, much better armed, had won handily\u2014to the devastation of the Tuscarora nation.</p><p>Myers nodded toward the darkness.</p><p>\u201cAin\u2019t no more than seven villages o\u2019 the Tuscarora left, now\u2014and not above fifty or a hundred souls in any but the biggest one.\u201d So sadly diminished, the Tuscarora would quickly have fallen prey to surrounding tribes and disappeared altogether, had they not been formally adopted by the Mohawk, and thus become part of the powerful Iroquois League.</p><p>Jamie came back to the fire with a bottle from his saddlebag. It was Scotch whisky, a parting present from Jocasta. He poured out a small cupful, then offered the half-full bottle to Myers.</p><p>\u201cIs the Mohawk country not a verra great distance to the north?\u201d he asked. \u201cHow can they offer protection to their fellows here, and they with hostile tribes all round?\u201d</p><p>Myers took a gulp of whisky and washed it pleasurably around his mouth before answering.</p><p>\u201cMmm. That\u2019s fine stuff, friend James. Oh, the Mohawk are a good ways off, aye. But the Nations of the Iroquois are a name to reckon with\u2014and of all the Six Nations, the Mohawk are the fiercest. Ain\u2019t no one\u2014red or white\u2014goin\u2019 to mess with the Mohawk \u2019thout good cause, nossir.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I was fascinated by this. I was also pleased to hear that the Mohawk territory was a good long way away from us.</p><p>\u201cWhy did the Mohawk want to adopt the Tuscarora, then?\u201d Jamie asked, lifting one brow. \u201cIt doesna seem they\u2019d be needing allies, and they so fierce as ye say.\u201d</p><p>Myers\u2019s hazel eyes had gone to dreamy half-slits under the influence of good whisky.</p><p>\u201cOh, they\u2019re fierce, all right\u2014but they\u2019re mortal,\u201d he said, \u201cIndians are men o\u2019 blood, and none more than the Mohawk. They\u2019re men of honor, mind\u201d\u2014he raised a thick finger in admonition\u2014\u201cbut there\u2019s a sight of things they\u2019ll kill for, some reasonable, some not. They raid, d\u2019ye see, amongst themselves, and they\u2019ll kill for revenge\u2014ain\u2019t nothin\u2019 will stop a Mohawk bent on revenge, save you kill him. And even then, his brother or his son or his nephew will come after you.\u201d</p> <p>He licked his lips in slow meditation, savoring the slick of whisky on his skin.</p><p>\u201cSometimes Indians don\u2019t kill for any reason a man would say mattered; specially when liquor\u2019s involved.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds very much like the Scots,\u201d I murmured to Jamie, who gave me a cold look in return.</p><p>Myers picked up the whisky bottle and rolled it slowly between his palms.</p><p>\u201cAny man might take a drop too much and be the worse in his actions for it, but with the Indians, the first drop\u2019s too much. I\u2019ve heard of more than one massacre that might not have been, save for the men bein\u2019 mad with drink.\u201d</p> <p>He shook his head, recalling himself to his subject.</p><p>\u201cBe so as it may, it\u2019s a hard life, and a bloody one. Some tribes are wiped out altogether, and none have men to spare. So they adopt folk into the tribe, to replace those as are killed or die of sickness. They take prisoners, sometimes\u2014take \u2019em into a family, treat \u2019em as their own. That\u2019s what they\u2019ll do with Mrs. Polly, there.\u201d He nodded at Pollyanne, who sat quietly by the fire, paying no attention to his speech.</p><p>\u201cSo happen back fifty years, the Mohawk took and adopted the whole tribe of the Tuscarora. Don\u2019t many tribes speak exactly the same language,\u201d Myers explained. \u201cBut some are closer than others. Tuscarora\u2019s more like the Mohawk than \u2019tis like the Creek or the Cherokee.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan ye speak Mohawk yourself, Mr. Myers?\u201d Ian\u2019s ears had been flapping all through the explanation. Fascinated by every rock, tree, and bird on our journey, Ian was still more fascinated by any mention of Indians.</p><p>\u201cOh, a good bit.\u201d Myers shrugged modestly. \u201cAny trader picks up a few words here and there. Shoo, dawg.\u201d Rollo, who had inched his nose within sniffing distance of Myers\u2019s last trout, twitched his ears at the admonition but didn\u2019t withdraw the nose.</p><p>\u201cWill it be the Tuscarora ye mean to take Mistress Polly to?\u201d Jamie asked, crumbling a corn dodger into edible chunks.</p> <p>Myers nodded, chewing carefully; with as few natural teeth as he had left, even fresh corn dodgers were a hazardous undertaking.</p><p>\u201cAye. Be four, five days ride still,\u201d he explained. He turned to me and gave me a reassuring smile. \u201cI\u2019ll see her settled fine, Mrs. Claire, you\u2019ll not be worried for her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat will the Indians think of her, I wonder?\u201d Ian asked. He glanced at Pollyanne, interested. \u201cWill they have seen a black woman before?\u201d</p><p>Myers laughed at that.</p><p>\u201cLad, there\u2019s a many of the Tuscarora ain\u2019t seen a white person before. Mrs. Polly won\u2019t come as any more a shock than your auntie might.\u201d Myers took a vast swig of water and swished it around his mouth, eyeing Pollyanne thoughtfully. She felt his eyes on her, and returned his stare, unblinking.</p><p>\u201cI should say they\u2019d find her handsome, though; they do like a woman as is sweetly plump.\u201d It was moderately obvious that Myers shared this admiration; his eyes drifted over Pollyanne with an appreciation touched with innocent lasciviousness.</p><p>She saw it, and an extraordinary change came over her. She seemed scarcely to move, and yet all at once, her whole person was focused on Myers. No white showed around her eyes; they were black and fathomless, shining in the firelight. She was still short and heavy, but with only the slightest change of posture, depth of bosom and width of hip were emphasized, suddenly curved in a promise of lewd abundance.</p><p>Myers swallowed, audibly.</p> <p>I glanced away from this little byplay to see Jamie watching, too, with an expression somewhere between amusement and concern. I poked him unobtrusively, and squinted hard, in an expression that said as explicitly as I could manage\u2014\u201cDo something!\u201d</p><p>He narrowed one eye.</p><p>I widened both mine and gave him a good stare, which translated to, \u201cI don\u2019t know, but do something!\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmphm.\u201d</p><p>Jamie cleared his throat, leaned forward, and laid a hand on Myers\u2019s arm, jarring the mountain man out of his momentary trance.</p><p>\u201cI shouldna like to think the woman will be misused in any way,\u201d he said, politely, but with an edge of Scottish innuendo on \u201cmisused\u201d that implied the possibility of unlimited impropriety. He squeezed a little. \u201cWill ye undertake to guarantee her safety, Mr. Myers?\u201d</p><p>Myers shot him a look of incomprehension, which slowly cleared, cognizance coming into the bloodshot hazel eyes. The mountain man slowly pulled his arm free, then picked up his cup, gulped the last mouthful of whisky, coughed and wiped his mouth. He might have been blushing, but it was impossible to tell behind the beard.</p><p>\u201cOh, yes. That is, I mean to say, oh, no. No, indeed. The Mohawk and the Tuscarora both, their women choose who they bed with, even who they marry. No such thing as rape among \u2019em. Oh, no. No, sir; she won\u2019t be misused, I can promise that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, and I\u2019m glad to hear it.\u201d Jamie sat back, at ease, and gave me an I-trust-you\u2019re-satisfied glare out of the corner of his eye. I smiled demurely.</p><p>Ian might be not quite sixteen, but he was far too observant to have missed all these exchanges. He coughed, in a meaningful Scottish manner.</p><p>\u201cUncle, Mr. Myers has been kind enough to invite me to go with him and Mrs. Polly, to see the Indian village. I shall be sure to see that she finds good treatment there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2014\u201d Jamie started, then broke off. He gave his nephew a long, hard look across the fire. I could see the thoughts racing through his mind.</p><p>Ian hadn\u2019t asked permission to go; he\u2019d announced he was going. If Jamie forbade him, he must give grounds\u2014and he could scarcely say that it was too dangerous, as this would mean admitting both that he was willing to send the slave woman into danger and that he didn\u2019t trust Myers and his relations with the local Indians. Jamie was trapped, and very neatly too.</p><p>He breathed in strongly through his nose. Ian grinned.</p><p>I looked back across the fire. Pollyanne was still sitting as she had been, not moving. Her eyes were still fixed on Myers, but a slight smile curved her lips in invitation. One hand rose slowly, cupping a massive breast, almost absently.</p><p>Myers was staring back, dazed as a deer with a hunter\u2019s light in its eyes.</p><p>And would I do differently? I thought later, listening to the discreet rustling noises and small groans from the direction of Myers\u2019s blankets. If I knew that my life depended on a man? Would I not do anything I could to ensure he would protect me, in the face of unknown danger?</p><p>There was a snapping and crackling in the bushes, not far away. It was loud, and I stiffened. So did Jamie. He slid his hand out from under my shirt, reaching for his dirk, then relaxing, as the reassuring scent of skunk reached our nostrils.</p><p>He put his hand back under my shirt, squeezed my breast and fell back asleep, his breath warm on my neck.</p><p>No great difference at all, perhaps. Was my future any more certain than hers? And did I not depend for my life upon a man bound to me\u2014at least in part\u2014by desire of my body?</p><p>A faint wind breathed through the trees, and I hitched the blanket higher on my shoulder. The fire had burned to embers, and so high in the mountains, it was cool at night. The moon had set, but it was very clear; the stars blazed close, a net of light cast over the mountains\u2019 peaks.</p><p>No, there were differences. However unknown my future, it would be shared, and the bond between my man and me went much deeper than the flesh. Beyond all this was the one great difference, though\u2014I had chosen to be there.</p><p>15</p><p>NOBLE SAVAGES</p><p>We took our leave of the others in the morning, Jamie and Myers taking pains over the arrangement for a rendezvous in ten days time. Looking around me at the bewildering immensity of forest and mountain, I couldn\u2019t imagine how anyone could be sure of finding a specific place again; I could only trust in Jamie\u2019s sense of navigation.</p><p>They turned to the north, we to the southwest, making our way along the course of the stream we had camped by. It seemed very quiet at first, and strangely lonely, with only the two of us. Within a short time, though, I had grown accustomed to the solitude and began to relax, taking a keen interest in our surroundings. This might, after all, be our home.</p><p>The thought was a rather daunting one; it was a place of amazing beauty and richness, but so wild, it hardly seemed that people could live in it. I didn\u2019t voice this thought, however; only followed Jamie\u2019s horse as he led us deeper and deeper into the mountains, stopping finally in the late afternoon to make a small camp and catch fish for dinner.</p><p>The light faded slowly, retreating through the trees. The thick mossy trunks grew dense with shadow, edges still rimmed with a fugitive light that hid among the leaves, green shadows shifting with the sunset breeze.</p><p>A tiny glow lit suddenly in the grass a few feet away, cool and bright. I saw another, and another, and then the edge of the wood was full of them, lazily falling, then blinking out, cold sparks drifting in the growing dark.</p><p>\u201cYou know, I never saw fireflies until I came to live in Boston,\u201d I said, filled with pleasure at sight of them, glowing emerald and topaz in the grass. \u201cThey don\u2019t have fireflies in Scotland, do they?\u201d</p><p>Jamie shook his head, reclining lazily on the grass, one arm hooked behind his head.</p><p>\u201cBonny wee things,\u201d he observed, and sighed with content. \u201cThis is my favorite time of the day, I think. When I lived in the cave, after Culloden, I would come out near evening, and sit on a stone, waiting for the dark.\u201d</p><p>His eyes were half closed, watching the fireflies. The shadows faded upward as night rose from the earth to the sky. A moment before, light through the oak leaves had mottled him like a fawn; now the brightness had faded, so he lay in a sort of dim green glow, the lines of his body at once solid and insubstantial.</p><p>\u201cAll the wee bugs come out just now\u2014the moths and the midges; all the bittie things that hang about in clouds over the water. Ye see the swallows come for them, and then the bats, swooping down. And the salmon, rising to the evening hatch and making rings on the water.\u201d</p><p>His eyes were open now, fixed on the waving sea of grass on the hillside, but I knew he saw instead the surface of the tiny loch near Lallybroch, alive with fleeting ripples.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s only a moment, but ye feel as though it will last forever. Strange, is it no?\u201d he said thoughtfully. \u201cYe can almost see the light go as ye watch\u2014and yet there\u2019s no time ye can look and say \u2018Now! Now it\u2019s night.\u2019 \u201d He gestured at the opening between the oak trees, and the valley below, its hollows filling with dark. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo.\u201d I lay back in the grass beside him, feeling the warm damp of the grass mold the buckskin to my body. The air was thick and cool under the trees, like the air in a church, dim and fragrant with remembered incense.</p><p>\u201cDo you remember Father Anselm at the abbey?\u201d I looked up; the color was going from the oak leaves overhead, leaving the soft silver undersides gray as mouse fur. \u201cHe said there was always an hour in the day when time seems to stop\u2014but that it was different for everyone. He thought it might be the hour when one was born.\u201d</p><p>I turned my head to look at him.</p><p>\u201cDo you know when you were born?\u201d I asked. \u201cThe time of day, I mean?\u201d</p> <p>He glanced at me and smiled, rolling over to face me.</p><p>\u201cAye, I do. Perhaps he was right, then, for I was born at suppertime\u2014just at twilight on the first of May.\u201d He brushed away a floating firefly and grinned at me.</p><p>\u201cHave I never told ye that story? How my mother had put on a pot of brose to cook, and then her pains came on so fast she\u2019d no time to think of it, and no one else remembered either until they smelled the burning, and it ruined the supper and the pot as well? There was nothing else in the house to eat save a great gooseberry pie. So they all ate that, but there was a new kitchenmaid and the gooseberries were green, and all of them\u2014except my mother and me, of course\u2014spent the night writhing wi\u2019 the indigestion.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head, still smiling. \u201cMy father said it was months before he could look at me without feeling his bowels cramp.\u201d</p><p>I laughed, and he reached to pick a last-year\u2019s leaf from my hair.</p> <p>\u201cAnd what hour were you born, Sassenach?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d I said, with the usual pang of faint regret for my vanished family. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t on my birth certificate, and if Uncle Lamb knew, he never told me. I know when Brianna was born, though,\u201d I added, more cheerfully. \u201cShe was born at three minutes past three in the morning. There was a huge clock on the wall of the delivery room, and I saw it.\u201d</p><p>Dim as the light was, I could see his look of surprise clearly.</p><p>\u201cYou were awake? I thought ye told me women are drugged then, so as not to feel the pain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey mostly were, then. I wouldn\u2019t let them give me anything, though.\u201d I stared upward. The shadows were thick around us now, but the sky was still clear and light above, a soft, brilliant blue.</p><p>\u201cWhy the hell not?\u201d he demanded, incredulous. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen a woman give birth, but I\u2019ve heard it more than once, I\u2019ll tell ye. And damned if I can see why a woman in her right mind would do it, and there was any choice about it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell...\u201d I paused, not wanting to seem melodramatic. It was the truth, though. \u201cWell,\u201d I said, rather defiantly, \u201cI thought I was going to die, and I didn\u2019t want to die in my sleep.\u201d</p><p>He wasn\u2019t shocked. He only raised one brow, and snorted faintly with amusement.</p><p>\u201cWould ye no?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, would you?\u201d I twisted my head to look at him. He rubbed the bridge of his nose, still amused at the question.</p><p>\u201cAye, well, perhaps. I\u2019ve come close to death by hanging, and I didna like the waiting a bit. I\u2019ve nearly been killed in battle a few times; I canna say I was much concerned about the dying then, though, bein\u2019 too busy to think of it. And then I\u2019ve nearly died of wounds and fever, and that was misery enough that I was looking forward verra keenly to being dead. But on the whole, given my choice about it, I think perhaps I wouldna mind dying in my sleep, no.\u201d</p><p>He leaned over and kissed me lightly. \u201cPreferably in bed, next to you. At a verra advanced age, mind.\u201d He touched his tongue delicately to my lips, then rose to his feet, brushing dried oak leaves from his breeks.</p><p>\u201cBest make a fire while there\u2019s light enough to strike a flint,\u201d he said. \u201cYe\u2019ll fetch the wee fish?\u201d</p><p>I left him to deal with flints and kindling while I went down the little hill to the stream, where we had left the fresh-caught trout dangling from stringers in the icy current. As I came back up the hill it had grown dark enough that I could see him only in outline, crouched over a tiny pile of smoldering kindling. A wisp of smoke rose up like incense, pale between his hands.</p> <p>I set the gutted fish down in the long grass and sat back on my heels beside him, watching as he laid fresh sticks on the fire, building it patiently, a barricade against the coming night.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think it will be like?\u201d I asked suddenly. \u201cTo die.\u201d</p><p>He stared into the fire, thinking. A burning twig snapped with heat, spurting sparks into the air, which drifted down, blinking out before they touched the ground.</p><p>\u201c \u2018Man is like the grass that withers and is thrown into the fire; he is like the sparks that fly upward...and his place will know him no more,\u2019 \u201d I quoted softly. \u201cIs there nothing after, do you think?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head, looking into the fire. I saw his eyes shift beyond it, to where the cool bright sparks of the fireflies blinked in and out among the dark stems.</p><p>\u201cI canna say,\u201d he said at last, softly. His shoulder touched mine and I leaned my head toward him. \u201cThere\u2019s what the Church says, but\u2014\u201d His eyes were still fixed on the fireflies, winking through the grass stems, their light unquenchable. \u201cNo, I canna say. But I think it will maybe be all right.\u201d</p><p>He tilted his head, pressing his cheek against my hair for a moment, then stood up, reaching for his dirk.</p><p>\u201cThe fire\u2019s well started now.\u201d</p><p>The heavy air of the afternoon had lifted with the coming of twilight, and a soft evening breeze blew the damp tendrils of hair off my face. I sat with my face lifted, eyes closed, enjoying the coolness after the sweaty heat of the day.</p><p>I could hear Jamie rustling around the fire, and the quick, soft whisht of his knife as he skinned green oak twigs for broiling the fish.</p><p>I think it will maybe be all right. I thought so, too. There was no telling what lay on the other side of life, but I had sat many times through an hour where time stops, empty of thought, soothed of soul, looking into...what? Into something that had neither name nor face, but which seemed good to me, and full of peace. If death lay there...</p><p>Jamie\u2019s hand touched my shoulder lightly in passing, and I smiled, not opening my eyes.</p><p>\u201cOuch!\u201d he muttered, on the other side of the fire. \u201cNicked myself, clumsy clot.\u201d</p><p>I opened my eyes. He was a good eight feet away, head bent as he sucked a small cut on the knuckle of his thumb. A ripple of gooseflesh rose straight up my back.</p><p>\u201cJamie,\u201d I said. My voice sounded peculiar, even to me. I felt a small round cold spot, centered like a target on the back of my neck.</p><p>\u201cAye?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs there\u2014\u201d I swallowed, feeling the hair rise on my forearms. \u201cJamie, is there...someone...behind me?\u201d</p><p>His eyes shifted to the shadows over my shoulder, and sprang wide. I didn\u2019t wait to look round, but flung myself flat on the ground, an action that likely saved my life.</p><p>There was a loud whuff! and a sudden strong smell of ammonia and fish. Something struck me in the back with an impact that knocked the breath out of me, and then stepped heavily on my head, driving my face into the ground.</p><p>I jerked up, gasping for breath, shaking leaf mold out of my eyes. A large black bear, squalling like a cat, was lurching round the clearing, its feet scattering burning sticks.</p><p>For a moment, half blinded by dirt, I couldn\u2019t see Jamie at all. Then I spotted him. He was under the bear, one arm locked around its neck, his head tucked into the joint of the shoulder just under the drooling jaws.</p><p>One foot shot out from under the bear, kicking frantically, stabbing at the ground for traction. He had taken his boots and stockings off when we made camp; I gasped as one bare foot slewed through the remnants of the fire, raising showers of sparks.</p><p>His forearm was ridged with effort, half buried in thick fur. His free arm thrust and jabbed; he had kept hold of his dirk, at least. At the same time, he hauled with all his strength on the bear\u2019s neck, pulling it down.</p><p>The bear was lunging, batting with one paw, trying to shake off the clinging weight around its neck. It seemed to lose its balance, and fell heavily forward, with a loud squall of rage. I heard a muffled whoof! that didn\u2019t seem to come from the bear, and looked frantically around for something to use as a weapon.</p><p>The bear struggled back to its feet, shaking itself violently.</p><p>I caught a brief glimpse of Jamie\u2019s face, contorted with effort. One bulging eye widened at sight of me, and he shook his mouth clear of the bristling fur.</p><p>\u201cRun!\u201d he shouted. Then the bear fell on him again, and he disappeared under three hundred pounds of hair and muscle.</p><p>With vague thoughts of Mowgli and the Red Flower, I scrabbled madly over the damp earth in the clearing, finding nothing but small pieces of charred stick and glowing embers that blistered my fingers but were too small to grip.</p><p>I had always thought that bears roared when annoyed. This one was making a lot of noise, but it sounded more like a very large pig, with piercing squeals and blatting noises interspersed with hair-raising growls. Jamie was making a lot of noise, too, which was reassuring under the circumstances.</p><p>My hand fell on something cold and clammy; the fish, tossed aside at the edge of the fire clearing.</p><p>\u201cTo hell with the Red Flower,\u201d I muttered. I seized one of the trout by the tail, ran forward, and belted the bear across the nose with it as hard as I could.</p><p>The bear shut its mouth and looked surprised. Then its head slewed toward me and it lunged, moving faster than I would have thought possible. I fell backward, landing on my bottom, and essayed a final, valiant blow with my fish before the bear charged me, Jamie still clinging to its neck like grim death.</p><p>It was like being caught in a meat grinder; a brief moment of total chaos, punctuated by random hard blows to the body and the sensation of being suffocated in a large, reeking hairy blanket. Then it was gone, leaving me lying bruised in the grass on my back, smelling strongly of bear piss and blinking up at the evening star, which was shining serenely overhead.</p><p>Things were a good deal less serene on the ground. I rolled onto all fours, shouting \u201cJamie!\u201d at the trees, where a large, amorphous mass rolled to and fro, smashing down the oak saplings and emitting a cacophony of growls and Gaelic screeches.</p><p>It was full dark on the ground by now, but there was enough light from the sky for me to make things out. The bear had fallen over again, but instead of rising and lunging, this time was rolling on its back, hind feet churning in an effort to gain a ripping purchase. One front paw landed in a heavy, rending slap and there was an explosive grunt that didn\u2019t sound like the bear\u2019s. The smell of blood was heavy on the air.</p><p>\u201cJamie!\u201d I shrieked.</p><p>There was no answer, but the writhing pile rolled and tilted slowly sideways into the deeper black shadows under the trees. The mingled noises subsided to heavy grunts and gasps, punctuated by small whimpering moans.</p><p>\u201cJAMIE!\u201d</p><p>The thrashing and branch-cracking died away into softer rustlings. Something was moving under the branches, swaying heavily from side to side, on all fours. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Very slowly, breathing in gasps with a catch and a groan, Jamie crawled out into the clearing.</p><p>Disregarding my own bruises, I ran to him, and dropped to my knees beside him.</p><p>\u201cGod, Jamie! Are you all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said shortly, and collapsed on the ground, wheezing gently.</p> <p>His face was no more than a pale blotch in the starlight; the rest of his body was so dark as to be nearly invisible. I found out why as I ran my hands swiftly over him. His clothes were so soaked with blood that they stuck to his body, his hunting shirt coming away from his chest with a nasty little sucking sound as I pulled at it.</p><p>\u201cYou smell like a slaughterhouse,\u201d I said, feeling under his chin for a pulse. It was fast\u2014no great surprise\u2014but strong, and a wave of relief washed over me. \u201cIs that your blood, or the bear\u2019s?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf it was mine, Sassenach, I\u2019d be dead,\u201d he said testily, opening his eyes. \u201cNo credit to you that I\u2019m not, mind.\u201d He rolled painfully onto his side and slowly got to his hands and knees, groaning. \u201cWhat possessed ye, woman, to hit me in the heid wi\u2019 a fish whilst I was fighting for my life?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHold still, for heaven\u2019s sake!\u201d He couldn\u2019t be too badly hurt if he was trying to get away. I clutched him by the h*ps to stop him, and kneeling behind him, felt my way gingerly up his sides. \u201cBroken ribs?\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cNo. But if ye tickle me, Sassenach, I willna like it a bit,\u201d he said, gasping between words.</p> <p>\u201cI won\u2019t,\u201d I assured him. I ran my hands gently over the arch of his ribs, pressing lightly. No splintered ends protruding through the skin, no sinister depressions or soft spots; cracked maybe, but he was right, nothing broken. He yelped and twitched under my hand. \u201cBad spot there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is,\u201d he said between his teeth. He was beginning to shiver, and I hurried to fetch his plaid, which I wrapped about his shoulders.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine, Sassenach,\u201d he said, waving away my attempts to help him to a seat. \u201cGo see to the horses; they\u2019ll be upset.\u201d They were. We had hobbled the horses a little way from the clearing; they had made it a good deal farther under the impetus of terror, judging from the muffled stamping and whinnying I could hear in the distance.</p><p>There were still small wheezing groans coming from the deep shadows under the trees; the sound was so human that the hair prickled on the back of my neck. Carefully skirting the sounds, I went and found the horses, cowering in a birch grove a few hundred yards away. They whickered when they scented me, delighted to see me, bear piss and all.</p><p>By the time I had soothed the horses and coaxed them back in the direction of the clearing, the pitiful noises from the shadows had ceased. There was a small glow in the clearing; Jamie had managed to get the fire started again.</p><p>He was crouched next to the tiny blaze, still shivering under his plaid. I fed in enough sticks to make sure it wouldn\u2019t go out, then turned my attention to him once more.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re really not badly damaged?\u201d I asked, still worried.</p><p>He gave me a lopsided smile.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do. It caught me a good one across the back, but I dinna think it\u2019s verra bad. Have a look?\u201d He straightened up, wincing, and felt his side gingerly as I crossed behind him.</p><p>\u201cWhat made it do that, I wonder?\u201d he said, twisting his head toward where the bear\u2019s carcass lay. \u201cMyers said the black bears dinna often attack ye, without ye provoke them some way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe somebody else provoked it,\u201d I suggested. \u201cAnd then had the sense to get out of the way.\u201d I lifted the plaid, and whistled under my breath.</p><p>The back of his shirt hung in shreds, smeared with dirt and ash, splotched with blood. His blood this time, not the bear\u2019s, but luckily not much. I gently pulled the tattered pieces of the shirt apart, exposing the long bow of his back. Four long claw-marks ran from shoulder blade to armpit; deep, wicked gouges that tapered to superficial red welts.</p><p>\u201cOoh!\u201d I said, in sympathy.</p><p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s no as though my back was much to look at, anyway,\u201d he joked feebly. \u201cReally, is it bad?\u201d He twisted around, trying to see, then stopped, grunting as the movement strained his bruised ribs.</p> <p>\u201cNo. Dirty, though; I\u2019ll need to wash it out.\u201d The blood had already begun to clot; the wounds would need to be cleansed at once. I put the plaid back and set on a pan of water to boil, thinking what else I might use.</p><p>\u201cI saw some arrowhead plant down near the stream,\u201d I said. \u201cI think I can find it again from memory.\u201d I handed him the bottle of ale I\u2019d brought from the saddlebags, and took his dirk.</p><p>\u201cWill you be all right?\u201d I paused and looked at him; he was very pale, and still shivering. The fire glimmered red on his brows, throwing the lines of his face into strong relief.</p><p>\u201cAye, I will.\u201d He mustered a faint grin. \u201cDinna worry, Sassenach; the thought of dyin\u2019 asleep in my bed seems even better to me now than it did an hour ago.\u201d</p><p>A sickle-moon was rising, bright over the trees, and I had little trouble finding the place I remembered. The stream ran cold and silver in the moonlight, chilling my hands and feet as I stood calf-deep in the water, groping for tubers of the arrowhead plant.</p><p>Small frogs sang all around me, and the stiff leaves of cattails rustled softly in the evening breeze. It was very, very peaceful, and all of a sudden I found myself shaking so hard that I had to sit down on the stream bank.</p><p>Anytime. It could happen anytime, and just this fast. I wasn\u2019t sure which seemed most unreal; the bear\u2019s attack, or this, the soft summer night, alive with promise.</p><p>I rested my head on my knees, letting the sickness, the residue of shock, drain away. It didn\u2019t matter, I told myself. Not only anytime, but anywhere. Disease, car wreck, random bullet. There was no true refuge for anyone, but like most people, I managed not to think of that most of the time.</p><p>I shuddered, thinking of the claw marks on Jamie\u2019s back. Had he been slower to react, not as strong...had the wounds been slightly deeper...for that matter, infection was still a major threat. But at least against that danger, I could fight.</p><p>The thought brought me back to myself, the squashed leaves and roots cool and wet in my hand. I splashed cold water over my face, and started up the hill toward the campfire, feeling somewhat better.</p><p>I could see Jamie through the thin scrim of saplings, sitting upright, outlined against the fire. Sitting bolt upright, in a way that must surely have been painful, considering his wounds.</p><p>I stopped, suddenly wary, just as he spoke.</p><p>\u201cClaire?\u201d He didn\u2019t turn around, and his voice was calm. He didn\u2019t wait for me to answer, but went on, voice cool and steady.</p><p>\u201cWalk up behind me, Sassenach, and put your knife into my left hand. Then stay behind me.\u201d</p><p>Heart hammering, I took the three steps that brought me high enough to see over his shoulder. On the far side of the clearing, just within the light of the fire, stood three Indians, heavily armed. Evidently the bear had been provoked.</p><p>The Indians looked us over with a lively interest that was more than returned. There were three of them; an older man, whose feathered topknot was liberally streaked with gray, and two younger, perhaps in their twenties. Father and sons, I thought\u2014there was a certain similarity among them, more of body than of face; all three were fairly short, broad-shouldered and bow-legged, with long, powerful arms.</p><p>I eyed their weapons covertly. The older man cradled a gun in the curve of his arm; it was an ancient French wheelock, the hexagonal barrel rimed with rust. It looked as though it would explode in his face if he fired it, but I hoped he wouldn\u2019t try.</p><p>One of the younger men carried a bow to hand, arrow casually nocked. All three had sinister-looking tomahawks and skinning knives slung in their belts. Long as it was, Jamie\u2019s dirk seemed rather inadequate by comparison.</p><p>Evidently coming to the same conclusion, he leaned forward and placed the dirk carefully on the ground at his feet. Sitting back, he spread his empty hands and shrugged.</p><p>The Indians giggled. It was such an unwarlike noise that I found myself half smiling in response, even though my stomach, less easily disarmed, stayed knotted with tension.</p><p>I saw Jamie\u2019s shoulders relax their rigid line, and felt slightly reassured.</p><p>\u201cBonsoir, messieurs,\u201d he said. \u201cParlez-vous fran\u00e7ais?\u201d</p><p>The Indians giggled again, glancing at each other shyly. The older man took a tentative step forward and ducked his head at us, setting the beads in his hair swinging.</p><p>\u201cNo...Fransh,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cEnglish?\u201d I said hopefully. He glanced at me with interest, but shook his head. He said something over one shoulder to one of his sons, who replied in the same unintelligible tongue. The older man turned back to Jamie and asked something, raising his brows in question.</p><p>Jamie shook his head in incomprehension, and one of the young men stepped into the firelight. Bending his knees and letting his shoulders slump, he thrust his head forward and swayed from side to side, peering nearsightedly in such perfect imitation of a bear that Jamie laughed out loud. The other Indians grinned.</p><p>The young man straightened up and pointed at the blood-soaked sleeve of Jamie\u2019s shirt, with an interrogatory noise.</p><p>\u201cOh, aye, it\u2019s over there,\u201d Jamie said, gesturing toward the darkness under the trees.</p><p>Without further ado, all three men disappeared into the dark, from which excited exclamations and murmurings soon emerged.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right, Sassenach,\u201d Jamie said. \u201cThey willna harm us. They\u2019re only hunters.\u201d He closed his eyes briefly, and I saw the faint sheen of sweat on his face. \u201cAnd a good thing, too, because I think I\u2019m maybe going to swoon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t even think about it. Don\u2019t you dare faint and leave me alone with them!\u201d No matter what the savages\u2019 possible intentions, the thought of facing them alone over Jamie\u2019s unconscious body was enough to reknot my intestines with panic. I put my hand on the back of his neck and forced his head down between his knees.</p><p>\u201cBreathe,\u201d I said, squeezing cold water from my handkerchief down the back of his neck. \u201cYou can faint later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I puke?\u201d he asked, his voice muffled in his kilt. I recognized the note of wry jest in it, and let my own breath out with relief.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I said. \u201cSit up; they\u2019re coming back.\u201d</p><p>They were, dragging the bear\u2019s carcass with them. Jamie sat up and mopped his face with the wet handkerchief. Warm as the night was, he was shivering slightly from shock, but he sat steadily enough.</p><p>The older man came over to us, and pointed with raised brows; first to the knife that lay at Jamie\u2019s feet, then to the dead bear. Jamie nodded modestly.</p><p>\u201cIt wasna easy, mind,\u201d he said.</p><p>The Indian\u2019s brows rose higher. Then he ducked his head, hands spread in a gesture of respect. He beckoned to one of the younger men, who came over, untying a pouch from his belt.</p><p>Shoving me unceremoniously to one side, the younger man ripped open the throat of Jamie\u2019s shirt, pulled it off his shoulder, and squinted at the injury. He poured a handful of a lumpy, half-powdery substance into his hand, spat copiously into it, stirred it into a foul-smelling paste, and smeared it liberally over the wounds. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNow I really am going to puke,\u201d Jamie murmured, wincing under the ungentle ministrations. \u201cWhat is that stuff?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt a guess, it\u2019s dried trillium mixed with very rancid bear grease,\u201d I said, trying not to inhale the pungent fumes. \u201cI don\u2019t suppose it will kill you; at least I hope not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s two of us, then,\u201d he said under his breath. \u201cNo, I\u2019ll do now, thank ye kindly.\u201d He waved away further ministrations, smiling politely at his would-be doctor.</p><p>Joking or not, his lips were white, even in the dimness of the firelight. I put a hand on his good shoulder, and felt the muscles clenched tight with strain.</p> <p>\u201cGet the whisky, Sassenach. I need it badly.\u201d</p><p>One of the Indians made a grab at the bottle as I pulled it from the bag, but I pushed him rudely away. He grunted with surprise, but didn\u2019t follow me. Instead, he picked up the bag and began rooting through it like a hog hunting truffles. I didn\u2019t try to stop him, but hurried back to Jamie with the whisky.</p><p>He took a small sip, then a larger one, shuddered once, and opened his eyes. He breathed deeply once or twice, drank again, then wiped his mouth and held out the bottle in invitation to the older man.</p><p>\u201cDo you think that\u2019s wise?\u201d I muttered, recalling Myers\u2019s lurid stories about massacres, and the effects of firewater on Indians.</p><p>\u201cI can give it to them or let them take it, Sassenach,\u201d he said, a little testily. \u201cThere are three of them, aye?\u201d</p> <p>The older man passed the mouth of the bottle under his nose, nostrils flaring as though in appreciation of a rare bouquet. I could smell the liquor from where I stood, and was surprised that it didn\u2019t sear the lining of his nose.</p><p>A smile of beatific content spread across the man\u2019s craggy face. He said something to his sons that sounded like \u201cHaroo!\u201d and the one who had been rifling our bag came at once to join his brother, a couple of corn dodgers clutched in his fist.</p><p>The older man stood up with the bottle in his hand, but instead of drinking, took it over to where the bear\u2019s carcass lay, black as an inkblot on the ground. With great deliberation, he poured a small amount of whisky into the palm of his hand, bent, and dribbled the liquid into the bear\u2019s half-open mouth. Then he turned slowly in a circle, shaking drops of whisky ceremoniously from his fingers. The drops flew gold and amber where they caught the light, hitting the fire with tiny, sizzling pops.</p><p>Jamie sat up straight, dizziness forgotten in his interest.</p><p>\u201cWill ye look at that, now?\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cAt what?\u201d I said, but he didn\u2019t answer, absorbed by the Indians\u2019 behavior.</p> <p>One of the younger men had taken out a small beaded pouch that held tobacco. Carefully packing the bowl of a small stone pipe, he lit it with a dry twig dipped into the flames of our fire, and drew strongly on the barrel. The tobacco leaf sparked and fumed, spreading its rich aroma over the clearing.</p><p>Jamie was leaning against me, his back against my thighs. I had my hand on his unwounded shoulder again, and could feel the shiver in his flesh start to ease as the warmth of the whisky began to spread in his belly. He wasn\u2019t badly hurt, but the strain of the fight and the continued effort to stay alert were taking their toll on him.</p><p>The older man took the pipe and drew several deep, leisurely mouthfuls, which he exhaled with evident pleasure. Then he knelt, and taking another deep lungful of smoke, carefully blew it up the nostrils of the dead bear. He repeated this process several times, muttering something under his breath as he exhaled.</p><p>Then he rose, with no sign of stiffness, and extended the pipe to Jamie.</p><p>Jamie smoked as the Indians had done\u2014one or two long, ceremonious mouthfuls\u2014and then lifted the pipe, turning to hand it to me.</p><p>I lifted the pipe and drew cautiously. Burning smoke filled my eyes and nose at once, and my throat constricted with an overwhelming urge to cough. I choked it back, and hastily gave Jamie the pipe, feeling my face turn red as the smoke curled lazily through my chest, tickling and burning as it searched its way through the channels of my lungs.</p><p>\u201cYe dinna breathe it, Sassenach,\u201d he murmured. \u201cJust let it rise up the back of your nose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow...you...tell me,\u201d I said, trying not to strangle.</p> <p>The Indians watched me in round-eyed interest. The older man put his head on one side, frowning as though trying to puzzle something out. He popped up onto his feet and came round the fire, crouching to peer curiously at me, close enough for me to catch the odd, smoky scent of his skin. He wore nothing but a breechclout and a sort of short leather apron, though his chest was covered by a large, ornate necklace featuring seashells, stones, and the teeth of some large animal.</p><p>With no warning, he suddenly reached out and squeezed my breast. There was nothing even faintly lascivious about the gesture, but I jumped. So did Jamie, hand darting for his knife.</p><p>The Indian sat back calmly on his heels, waving his hand in dismissal. He clapped his hand flat on his breast, then made a cupping motion and pointed at me. He had meant nothing; he had only wanted to assure himself that I was indeed female. He pointed from me to Jamie, and raised one brow.</p><p>\u201cAye, she\u2019s mine.\u201d Jamie nodded and lowered his dirk, but kept a hold on it, frowning at the Indian. \u201cMind your manners, eh?\u201d</p><p>Uninterested in this byplay, one of the younger Indians said something, and gestured impatiently at the carcass on the ground. The older man, who had paid no attention to Jamie\u2019s annoyance, replied, drawing his skinning knife from his belt as he turned.</p><p>\u201cHere\u2014that\u2019s mine to do.\u201d</p><p>The Indians turned in surprise as Jamie rose to his feet. He gestured with his dirk to the bear, and then pointed the tip firmly at his own chest.</p><p>Not waiting for any response, he knelt on the ground beside the carcass, crossed himself, and said something in Gaelic, knife raised above the still body. I didn\u2019t know all the words, but I had seen him do it once before, when he had killed a deer on the road from Georgia.</p><p>It was the gralloch prayer he had been taught as a boy, learning to hunt in the Highlands of Scotland. It was old, he had told me; so old that some of the words were no longer in common use, so it sounded unfamiliar. But it must be said for any animal slain that was larger than a hare, before the throat was cut or the bellyskin split.</p><p>Without hesitation, he made a shallow slash across the chest\u2014no need to bleed the carcass; the heart was long since still\u2014and ripped the skin between the legs, so the pale swell of the intestines bulged up from the narrow, black-furred slit, gleaming in the light.</p><p>It took both strength and considerable skill to split and peel back the heavy skin without penetrating the mesenteric membrane that held the visceral sac enclosed. I, who had opened softer human bodies, recognized surgical competence when I saw it. So did the Indians, who were watching the proceedings with critical interest.</p><p>Jamie\u2019s skill at skinning wasn\u2019t what had fixed their attention, though\u2014that was surely a common enough ability here. No, it was the gralloch prayer\u2014I had seen the older man\u2019s eyes widen, and his glance at his sons as Jamie knelt over the carcass. They might not know what he was saying, but it was plain from their expressions that they knew exactly what he was doing\u2014and were both surprised, and favorably impressed.</p><p>A small trickle of sweat ran down behind Jamie\u2019s ear, clear red in the firelight. Skinning a large animal is heavy work, and small spots of fresh blood were showing through the grimy cloth of his shirt.</p><p>Before I could offer to take the knife, though, he sat back on his heels and offered the dirk hilt-first to one of the younger Indians.</p><p>\u201cGo ahead,\u201d he said, gesturing at the bear\u2019s half-butchered bulk in invitation. \u201cYe dinna think I\u2019m going to eat it all myself, I hope.\u201d</p><p>The man took the knife without hesitation, and kneeling, took over the skinning. The two others glanced at Jamie, and seeing his nod, joined in the work.</p><p>He let me sit him on the log once more and covertly clean and dress his shoulder, while he watched the Indians make quick work of the skinning and butchering.</p><p>\u201cWhat was it he did with the whisky?\u201d I asked quietly. \u201cDo you know?\u201d</p><p>He nodded, eyes fixed absently on the bloody work by the fire.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a charm. Ye scatter holy water to the four airs of the earth, to preserve yourself from evil. And I suppose whisky is a verra reasonable substitute for holy water, in the circumstances.\u201d</p><p>I glanced at the Indians, stained to the elbows with the bear\u2019s blood, talking casually among themselves. One of them was building a small platform near the fire, a crude layer of sticks laid across rocks set in a square. Another was cutting chunks of meat and stringing them on a peeled green stick for cooking.</p><p>\u201cFrom evil? Do you mean they\u2019re afraid of us?\u201d</p><p>He smiled.</p><p>\u201cI shouldna think we\u2019re so fearsome, Sassenach; no, from spirits.\u201d</p><p>Frightened as I had been by the Indians\u2019 appearance, it would never have occurred to me that they might have been similarly unnerved by ours. But glancing up at Jamie now, I thought they might pardonably have been excused for nervousness.</p><p>Used to him as I was, I was seldom aware anymore of how he appeared to others. But even tired and wounded, he was formidable; straight-backed and wide-shouldered, with slanted eyes that caught the fire in a glitter as blue as the flame\u2019s heart.</p><p>He sat easily now, relaxed, big hands loose between his thighs. But it was the stillness of a great cat, eyes always watchful behind the calm. Beyond size and quickness, there was undeniably an air of savagery about him; he was as much at home in these woods as the bear had been.</p><p>The English had always thought the Scottish Highlanders barbarians; I had never before considered the possibility that others might feel likewise. But these men had seen a ferocious savage, and approached him with due caution, arms at the ready. And Jamie, horrified beforehand at the thought of savage Red Indians, had seen their rituals\u2014so like his own\u2014and known them at once for fellow hunters; civilized men.</p><p>Even now, he was speaking to them quite naturally, explaining with broad gestures how the bear had come upon us and how he had killed it. They followed him with avid attention, exclaiming in appreciation in all the right places. When he picked up the remains of the mangled fish and demonstrated my role in the proceedings, they all looked at me and giggled hilariously.</p><p>I glared at all four of them.</p><p>\u201cDinner,\u201d I said loudly, \u201cis served.\u201d</p><p>We shared a meal of half-roasted meat, corn dodgers, and whisky, watched throughout by the head of the bear, which perched ceremonially on its platform, dead eyes gone dull and gummy.</p><p>Feeling mildly glazed, I leaned against the fallen log, listening with half an ear to the conversation. Not that I understood much that was actually said. One of the sons, an accomplished mimic, was giving a spirited rendition of Great Hunts of the Past, alternately playing the parts of hunter and prey, and doing it well enough that even I had no difficulty in telling a deer from a panther.</p><p>We had got so far in our acquaintance as an exchange of names. Mine came out in their tongue as \u201cKlah,\u201d which they seemed to find very funny. \u201cKlah,\u201d they said, pointing at me, \u201cKlah-Klah-Klah-Klah-Klah!\u201d Then they all laughed uproariously, their humor fueled by whisky. I might have been tempted to reply in kind, save that I wasn\u2019t sure I could pronounce \u201cNacognaweto\u201d once, let alone repeatedly. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>They were\u2014or so Jamie informed me\u2014Tuscarora. With his gift of tongues, he was already pointing at objects and essaying the Indian names for them. No doubt by dawn he would be exchanging improper stories with them, I thought blearily; they were already telling him jokes.</p><p>\u201cHere,\u201d I said, tugging on the edge of Jamie\u2019s plaid. \u201cAre you all right? Because I can\u2019t stay awake to look after you. Are you going to faint and fall headfirst into the fire?\u201d</p><p>Jamie patted me absently on the head.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be fine now, Sassenach,\u201d he said. Restored by food and whisky, he seemed to be suffering no lingering ill effects from his battle with the bear. What he\u2019d feel like in the morning was another question, I thought.</p> <p>I was beyond worrying about that, or anything else, though; my head was spinning from the effects of adrenaline, whisky and tobacco, and I crawled off to fetch my blanket. Curled up by Jamie\u2019s feet, I drifted drowsily off to sleep, surrounded by the sacred fumes of smoke and liquor, and watched by the dull, sticky eyes of the bear.</p><p>\u201cKnow just how you feel,\u201d I told it, and then was gone.</p><p>16</p><p>THE FIRST LAW OF THERMODYNAMICS</p><p>I was awakened abruptly just after dawn by a tiny stinging sensation on top of my head. I blinked and put up a hand to investigate. The movement startled a large gray jay who had been pulling hairs out of my head, and he shot up into a nearby pine tree, screeching hysterically.</p> <p>\u201cServe you right, mate,\u201d I muttered, rubbing the top of my head, but couldn\u2019t help smiling. I had been told often enough that my hair looked like a bird\u2019s nest first thing in the morning; perhaps there was something to it, after all.</p><p>The Indians were gone. Luckily, the bear\u2019s head had gone with them. I felt my own head with ginger fingers, but aside from the small sting of the jay\u2019s depredations, it seemed intact. Either it had been remarkably good whisky, or my sense of intoxication had been due more to the effects of adrenaline and tobacco than to alcohol.</p><p>My comb was in the small deerskin pouch where I kept personal necessities and those few medicines I thought might be useful on the trail. I sat up carefully, so as not to wake Jamie. He lay a short distance away on his back, hands crossed, peaceful as the carved effigy on a sarcophagus.</p><p>A lot more colorful, though. He lay in the shade, a creeping patch of sunshine sneaking up on him, barely touching the ends of his hair. In the fresh, cool light, he looked like Adam, newly touched by his Creator\u2019s hand.</p><p>Rather a battered Adam, though; on closer inspection, this was a snap taken well after the Fall. Not the fragile perfection of a child born of clay, nor yet the unused beauty of the youth God loved. No, this one was a man full-formed and powerful; each line of face and body marked with strength and struggle, made to take hold of the world he would wake to, and subdue it.</p><p>I moved very quietly, reaching for my pouch. I didn\u2019t want to wake him; the opportunity to watch him sleep came rarely. He slept like a cat, ready to spring up at any intimation of threat, and he normally rose from his bed at first light, while I was still floating on the surface of my dreams. Either he had drunk more than I thought last night, or he was in the deep sleep of healing, letting his body mend itself as he lay still.</p> <p>The horn comb slid soothingly through my hair. For once, I wasn\u2019t in a hurry. There was no baby to feed, no child to rouse and dress for school, no work waiting. No patients to see, no paperwork to do.</p><p>Nothing could be farther from the sterile confines of a hospital than this place, I thought. Early birds in search of worms were making a cheerful racket in the forest, and a cool, soft breeze blew through the clearing. I smelt a faint whiff of dried blood, and the stale ashes from last night\u2019s fire.</p><p>Perhaps it was the scent of blood that had made me remember the hospital. From the moment I first walked into one, I had known it to be my sphere, my natural place. And yet I was not out of place, here in the wild-wood. I thought that odd.</p><p>The ends of my hair brushed my nak*d shoulder blades with a pleasant, tickling feel, and the air was cool enough that the small breeze made my skin ripple with gooseflesh, my n**ples standing up in tiny puckers. So I hadn\u2019t imagined it, I thought, with an inward smile. I certainly hadn\u2019t taken my own clothes off before retiring.</p><p>I pushed back the thick linen blanket, and saw the flecks of dried blood, smears on my thighs and belly. I felt dampness ooze between my legs, and drew a finger between them. Milky, with a musky scent not my own.</p><p>That was enough to bring back the shadow of the dream\u2014or what I had thought must be one; the great bulk of the bear looming over me, darker than the night and reeking of blood, a rush of terror that kept my dream\u2014heavy limbs from moving. My lying limp, pretending death, as he nudged and nuzzled, breath hot on my skin, fur soft on my br**sts, gentleness amazing for a beast.</p><p>Then that one sharp moment of consciousness; of cold, then hot, as bare skin, not bearskin, touched my own, and then the dizzy slide back into drunken dreaming, the slow and forceful coupling, cli**x fading into sleep...with a soft Scottish growling in my ear.</p><p>I looked down and saw the strawberry crescent of a bite mark on my shoulder.</p> <p>\u201cNo wonder you\u2019re still asleep,\u201d I said in accusation. The sun had touched the curve of his cheek, lighting the eyebrow on that side like a match touched to kindling. He didn\u2019t open his eyes, but a slow, sweet smile spread across his face in answer.</p><p>The Indians had left us a portion of the bear meat, tidily wrapped in oiled skin and hung from the branches of a nearby tree to discourage the attentions of skunks and raccoons. After breakfast and a hasty bath in the creek, Jamie took his bearings by sun and mountain.</p><p>\u201cThat way,\u201d he said, nodding toward a distant blue peak. \u201cSee where it makes a notch wi\u2019 the shorter one? On the other side, it\u2019s the Indians\u2019 land; the new Treaty Line follows that ridge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomeone actually surveyed through there?\u201d I peered unbelievingly at the vista of saw-toothed mountain ranges rising from valleys filled with morning mist. The mountains rose ahead of us like an endless series of floating mirages, fading from black-green to blue to purple, the farthest peaks etched black and needle-sharp against a crystal sky.</p><p>\u201cOh, aye.\u201d He swung up into his saddle, turning his horse\u2019s head so the sun fell over his shoulder. \u201cThey had to, to say for sure which land could be taken for settling. I made sure of the boundary before we left Wilmington, and Myers said the same\u2014this side of the highest ridge. I did think to ask the fellows who dined with us last night, though, only to be sure they thought so, too.\u201d He grinned down at me. \u201cReady, Sassenach?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs I\u2019ll ever be,\u201d I assured him, and turned my horse to follow.</p><p>He had rinsed out his shirt\u2014or what was left of it\u2014in the stream. The stained rag of linen was spread out to dry behind his saddle, leaving him half-naked in leather riding breeks, his plaid wrapped carelessly round his waist. The long scratches left by the bear\u2019s attack were black across his fair skin, but there was no visible inflammation, and from the ease with which he moved in the saddle, the wounds seemed not to trouble him.</p><p>Neither did anything else, so far as I could see. The tinge of wariness he always bore was still with him; it had been part of him since boyhood\u2014but some weight had lifted in the night. I thought perhaps it was our meeting with the three hunters; this first encounter with savages had been vastly reassuring to us both, and seemed substantially to have eased Jamie\u2019s visions of tomahawk-wielding cannibals behind every tree.</p><p>Or it might be the trees themselves\u2014or the mountains. His spirits had grown lighter with every foot upward from the coastal plain. I couldn\u2019t help sharing his apparent joy\u2014but at the same time, felt a growing dread of what that joy might lead to.</p><p>By midmorning the slopes had grown too thickly forested to ride any farther. Looking up a nearly vertical rock face into a dizzying tangle of dark branches, sparked with gold and green and brown, I was inclined to think the horses were lucky to be stopping at the bottom. We hobbled them near a stream, thick with grass along its edge, and plunged in on foot, onward and upward, ever deeper into the bloody Forest Primeval.</p><p>Towering pines and hemlocks, was it? I thought, clambering over the burled knots of a fallen tree. The monstrous trunks rose so high that the lowest limbs started twenty feet above my head. Longfellow had no idea.</p><p>The air was damp, cool but fecund, and my moccasins sank soundlessly into centuries-thick black leaf mold. My own footprint in the soft mud of a stream bank seemed strange and sudden as a dinosaur\u2019s track.</p><p>We reached the top of a ridge, only to find another before us, and another beyond. I did not know what we might be looking for, or how we would know if we found it. Jamie covered miles with his tireless hill-walker\u2019s stride, taking in everything. I tagged behind, enjoying the scenery, pausing now and then to gather some fascinating plant or root, stowing my treasures in the bag at my belt.</p><p>We made our way along the back of one ridge, only to find our way blocked by a great heath bald: a patch of mountain laurel that looked from a distance like a shiny bare patch among the dark conifers, but closer to, proved to be an impenetrable thicket, its springy branches interwoven like a basket.</p><p>We backtracked, and turned downward, out from under the huge fragrant firs, across slopes of wild timothy and muhly grass that had gone bright yellow in the sun, and at last back into the soothing green of oak and hickory, on a wooded bluff that overlooked a small and nameless river.</p><p>It was cool under the trees\u2019 sudden shade, and I sighed in relief, lifting the hair off my neck to admit a breath of air. Jamie heard me and turned, smiling, holding back a limber branch so that I could follow him.</p><p>We didn\u2019t talk much; aside from the breath required for climbing, the mountain itself seemed to inhibit speech; full of secret green places, it was a vivid offspring of the ancient Scottish mountains, thick with forest, and twice the height of those barren black parental crags. Still, its air held the same injunction to silence, the same promise of enchantment.</p><p>The ground here was covered in a foot-deep layer of fallen leaves, soft and spongy underfoot, and the spaces between the trees seemed illusionary, as though to pass between those huge, lichened trunks might transport one suddenly to another dimension of reality.</p><p>Jamie\u2019s hair sparked in the occasional shafts of sunlight, a torch to follow through the shadows of the wood. It had darkened somewhat over the years, to a deep, rich auburn, but the long days of riding and walking in the sun had bleached his crown to copper fire. He had lost the thong that bound his hair; he paused, and brushed the thick damp locks back from his face, so that I saw the startling streak of white just above one temple. Normally hidden among the darker red, it showed rarely\u2014a legacy of the bullet wound received in the cave of Abandawe.</p><p>Despite the warmth of the day, I shivered slightly in recollection. I would greatly have preferred to forget Haiti and its savage mysteries altogether, but there was little hope of that. Sometimes, on the verge of sleep, I would hear the voice of the cave-wind, and the nagging echo of the thought that came in its wake: Where else?</p><p>We climbed a granite ledge, thick with moss and lichen, wet with the omnipresent flow of water, then followed the path of a descending freshet, brushing aside long grass that pulled at our legs, dodging the drooping branches of mountain laurel and the thick-leaved rhododendrons. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Wonders sprang up by my feet, small orchids and brilliant fungi, trembling and shiny as jellies, shimmering red and black on fallen tree trunks. Dragonflies hung over the water, jewels immobile in the air, vanishing in mist.</p><p>I felt dazed with abundance, ravished by beauty. Jamie\u2019s face bore the dream-stunned look of a man who knows himself sleeping, but does not wish to wake. Paradoxically, the better I felt, the worse I felt, too; desperately happy\u2014and desperately afraid. This was his place, and surely he felt it as well as I.</p><p>In early afternoon we stopped to rest and drink from a small spring at the edge of a natural clearing. The ground beneath the maple trees was covered with a thick carpet of dark green leaves, among which I caught a sudden telltale flash of red.</p><p>\u201cWild strawberries!\u201d I said with delight.</p> <p>The berries were dark red and tiny, about the size of my thumb joint. By the standards of modern horticulture, they would have been too tart, nearly bitter, but eaten with a meal consisting of half-cooked cold bear meat and rock-hard corn dodgers, they were delicious\u2014fresh explosions of flavor in my mouth; pinpricks of sweetness on my tongue.</p><p>I gathered handfuls in my cloak, not caring for stains\u2014what was a little strawberry juice among the stains of pine pitch, soot, leaf smudges and simple dirt? By the time I had finished, my fingers were sticky and pungent with juice, my stomach was comfortably full, and the inside of my mouth felt as though it had been sandpapered, from the tartly acid taste of the berries. Still, I couldn\u2019t resist reaching for just one more.</p><p>Jamie leaned his back against a sycamore, eyelids half lowered against the dazzle of afternoon sun. The little clearing held light like a cup, still and limpid.</p><p>\u201cWhat d\u2019ye think of this place, Sassenach?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI think it\u2019s beautiful. Don\u2019t you?\u201d</p> <p>He nodded, looking down between the trees, where a gentle slope full of wild hay and timothy fell away and rose again in a line of willows that fringed the distant river.</p><p>\u201cI am thinking,\u201d Jamie said, a little awkwardly. \u201cThere is the spring here in the wood. That meadow below\u2014\u201d He waved a hand toward the scrim of alders that screened the ridge from the grassy slope. \u201cIt would do for a few beasts at first, and then the land nearer the river might be cleared and put in crops. The rise of the land here is good for drainage. And here, see...\u201d Caught by visions, he rose to his feet, pointing.</p><p>I looked carefully; to me, the place seemed little different from any of the steep wooded slopes and grassy coves through which we had wandered for the last couple of days. But to Jamie, with his farmer\u2019s eye, houses and stock pens and fields sprang up like fairy mushrooms in the shadows of the trees.</p><p>Happiness was sticking out all over him, like porcupine quills. My heart felt like lead in my chest.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re thinking we might settle here, then? Take the Governor\u2019s offer?\u201d</p><p>He looked at me, stopping abruptly in his speculations.</p> <p>\u201cWe might,\u201d he said. \u201cIf\u2014\u201d</p><p>He broke off and looked sideways at me. Sun-reddened as he was, I couldn\u2019t tell whether he was flushed with sun or shyness.</p><p>\u201cD\u2019ye believe in signs at all, Sassenach?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat sorts of signs?\u201d I asked guardedly.</p><p>In answer, he bent, plucked a sprig from the ground, and dropped it into my hand\u2014the dark green leaves like small round Chinese fans, a pure white flower on a slender stem, and on another a half-ripe berry, its shoulders pale with shade, blushing crimson at the tip.</p><p>\u201cThis. It\u2019s ours, d\u2019ye see?\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cOurs?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Frasers\u2019, I mean,\u201d he explained. One large, blunt finger gently prodded the berry. \u201cStrawberries ha\u2019 always been the emblem of the clan\u2014it\u2019s what the name meant, to start with, when a Monsieur Fr\u00e9seli\u00e8re came across from France wi\u2019 King William that was\u2014and took hold of land in the Scottish mountains for his trouble.\u201d</p> <p>King William that was. William the Conqueror, that was. Perhaps not the oldest of the Highland clans, the Frasers had still a distinguished heritage.</p><p>\u201cWarriors from the start, were you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd farmers, too.\u201d The doubt in his eyes was fading into a smile.</p><p>I didn\u2019t say what I was thinking, but I knew well enough that the thought must lie in his mind as well. There was no more of clan Fraser save scattered fragments, those who had survived by flight, by stratagem or luck. The clans had been smashed at Culloden, their chieftains slaughtered in battle or murdered by law.</p><p>Yet here he stood, tall and straight in his plaid, the dark steel of a Highland dirk by his side. Warrior and farmer both. And if the soil beneath his feet was not that of Scotland, it was free air that he breathed\u2014and a mountain wind that stirred his hair, lifting copper strands to the summer sun.</p><p>I smiled up at him, fighting back my growing dismay.</p><p>\u201cFr\u00e9seli\u00e8re, eh? Mr. Strawberry? He grew them, did he, or was he only fond of eating them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEither or both,\u201d he said dryly, \u201cor it was maybe only that he was redheided, aye?\u201d</p><p>I laughed, and he hunkered down beside me, unpinning his plaid.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a rare plant,\u201d he said, touching the sprig in my open hand. \u201cFlowers, fruit and leaves all together at the one time. The white flowers are for honor, and red fruit for courage\u2014and the green leaves are for constancy.\u201d</p><p>My throat felt tight as I looked at him.</p><p>\u201cThey got that one right,\u201d I said.</p><p>He caught my hand in his own, squeezing my fingers around the tiny stem.</p><p>\u201cAnd the fruit is the shape of a heart,\u201d he said softly, and bent to kiss me.</p><p>The tears were near the surface; at least I had a good excuse for the one that oozed free. He dabbed it away, then stood up and pulled his belt loose, letting the plaid fall in folds around his feet. Then he stripped off shirt and breeks and smiled down at me, nak*d.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no one here,\u201d he said. \u201cNo one but us.\u201d</p><p>I would have said this seemed no reason, but I felt what it was he meant. We had been for days surrounded by vastness and threat, the wilderness no farther away than the pale circle of our fire. Yet here, we were alone together, part and parcel of the place, with no need in broad daylight to hold the wilderness at bay.</p><p>\u201cIn the old days, men would do this, to give fertility to the fields,\u201d he said, giving me a hand to rise.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t see any fields.\u201d And wasn\u2019t sure whether to hope I never would. Nonetheless, I skimmed off my buckskin shirt, and pulled loose the knot of my makeshift brassiere. He eyed me with appreciation.</p><p>\u201cWell, no doubt I shall have to cut down a few trees first, but that can wait, aye?\u201d</p><p>We made a bed of plaid and cloaks, and lay down upon it nak*d, skin to skin among the yellow grasses and the scent of balsam and wild strawberries.</p><p>We touched each other for what might have been a very long time or no time at all, together in the garden of earthly delight. I forced away the thoughts that had plagued me up the mountain, determined only to share his joy for as long as it lasted. I grasped him tight and he breathed in deep and pressed himself hard into my hand.</p><p>\u201cAnd what would Eden be without a serpent?\u201d I murmured, fingers stroking.</p><p>His eyes creased into blue triangles, so close I could see the black of his pupils.</p><p>\u201cAnd will ye eat wi\u2019 me, then, mo chridhe? Of the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of Good and Evil?\u201d</p><p>I put out the tip of my tongue and drew it along his lower lip in answer. He shivered under my fingers, though the air was warm and sweet.</p><p>\u201cJe suis prest,\u201d I said. \u201cMonsieur Fr\u00e9seli\u00e8re.\u201d</p><p>His head bent and his mouth fastened on my nipple, swollen as one of the tiny ripe berries.</p><p>\u201cMadame Fr\u00e9seli\u00e8re,\u201d he whispered back. \u201cJe suis \u00e0 votre service.\u201d</p><p>And then we shared the fruit and flowers, and the green leaves covering all.</p><p>We lay tangled in drowsiness, stirring only to bat away inquisitive insects, until the first shadows touched our feet. Jamie rose quietly, and covered me with a cloak, thinking me asleep. I heard the stealthy rustle as he dressed himself, and then the soft swish of his passage through the grass.</p><p>I rolled over, and saw him a little distance away, standing at the edge of the wood, looking out over the fall of land toward the river.</p><p>He wore nothing but his plaid, crumpled and blood-stained, belted round his waist. With his hair unbound and tangled round his shoulders, he looked the wild Highlander he was. What I had thought a trap for him\u2014his family, his clan\u2014was his strength. And what I had thought my strength\u2014my solitude, my lack of ties\u2014was my weakness.</p><p>Having known closeness, both its good and its bad, he had the strength to leave it, to step away from all notions of safety and venture out alone. And I\u2014so proud of self-sufficiency at one time\u2014could not bear the thought of loneliness again.</p><p>I had resolved to say nothing, to live in the moment, to accept whatever came. But the moment was here, and I could not accept it. I saw his head lift in decision, and at the same moment, saw his name carved in cold stone. Terror and despair washed over me.</p><p>As though he had heard the echo of my unspoken cry, he turned his head toward me. Whatever he saw in my face brought him swiftly to my side.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it, Sassenach?\u201d</p><p>There was no point in lying; not when he could see me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid,\u201d I blurted out.</p><p>He glanced quickly round for danger, one hand reaching for his knife, but I stopped him with a hand on his arm.</p><p>\u201cNot that. Jamie\u2014hold me. Please.\u201d</p><p>He gathered me close against him, wrapping the cloak around me. I was shivering, though the air was still warm.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right, a nighean donn,\u201d he murmured. \u201cI\u2019m here. What\u2019s frightened ye, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou,\u201d I said, and clung tight. His heart thumped just under my ear, strong and steady. \u201cHere. It makes me afraid to think of you here, of us coming here\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfraid?\u201d he asked. \u201cOf what, Sassenach?\u201d His arms tightened around me. \u201cI did say when we were wed that I would always see ye fed, no?\u201d He pulled me closer, tucking my head into the curve of his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cI gave ye three things that day,\u201d he said softly. \u201cMy name, my family, and the protection of my body. You\u2019ll have those things always, Sassenach\u2014 so long as we both shall live. No matter where we may be. I willna let ye go hungry or cold; I\u2019ll let nothing harm ye, ever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not afraid of any of that,\u201d I blurted. \u201cI\u2019m afraid you\u2019ll die, and I can\u2019t stand it if you do, Jamie, I really can\u2019t!\u201d</p><p>He jerked back a little, surprised, and looked down into my face.</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019ll do my best to oblige ye, Sassenach,\u201d he said, \u201cbut ye ken I may not have all the say in the matter.\u201d His face was serious, but one corner of his mouth curled up irrepressibly.</p><p>The sight did me in utterly.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you laugh!\u201d I said furiously. \u201cDon\u2019t you dare laugh!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m not,\u201d he assured me, trying to straighten his face. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou are!\u201d I punched him in the chest.

He grabbed for my hand, but I ducked my head and bit him on the thumb. He let out a cry and jerked his hand away.</p><p>He examined the toothmarks for a moment, then looked at me, one eyebrow raised. The humor lingered in his eyes, but at least he\u2019d stopped laughing, the bastard.</p><p>\u201cSassenach, ye\u2019ve seen me damn near dead a dozen times, and not turned a hair.

Well, I did think ye cared, of course. But I never thought of it in just that way, I admit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course you didn\u2019t! And if you had, it wouldn\u2019t make any difference. You\u2014you\u2014Scot!\u201d It was the worst thing I could think of to call him. Finding no more words, I turned and stomped away.</p><p>Unfortunately, stomping has relatively little effect when executed in bare feet on a grassy meadow. I stepped on something sharp, uttered a small cry, and limped a few more steps before having to stop.</p><p>I had stepped on some sort of cocklebur; half a dozen vicious caltrops were stuck in my bare sole, blood drops welling from the tiny punctures. Precariously balanced on one foot, I tried to pick them out, cursing under my breath.</p> <p>I wobbled and nearly fell. A strong hand caught me under the elbow and steadied me. I set my teeth and finished jerking out the spiny burs. I pulled my elbow out of his grasp and turning on my heel, walked\u2014with a good deal more care\u2014back to where I had left my clothing.</p><p>Dropping the cloak on the ground, I proceeded to dress, with what dignity was possible. Jamie stood, arms folded, watching me without comment.</p><p>\u201cWhen God threw Adam out of Paradise, at least Eve went with him,\u201d I said, talking to my fingers as I fastened the drawstring of my trousers.</p><p>\u201cAye, that\u2019s true,\u201d he agreed, after a cautious pause. He gave me a sidelong glance, to see whether I was about to hit him again.</p><p>\u201cAh\u2014ye havena been eating any o\u2019 the plants ye picked this morning, have ye, Sassenach? No, I didna think so,\u201d he added hastily, seeing my expression. \u201cI only wondered. Myers says some things here give ye the nightmare something fierce.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am not having nightmares,\u201d I said, with more force than strictly necessary had I been telling the truth. I was having waking nightmares, though ingestion of hallucinogenic plant substances had nothing to do with it.</p> <p>He sighed.</p><p>\u201cD\u2019ye mean to tell me straight out what ye\u2019re talkin\u2019 about, Sassenach, or do ye mean me to suffer a bit first?\u201d</p><p>I glared at him, caught as usual between the urge to laugh and the urge to hit him with a blunt object. Then a wave of despair overcame both laughter and anger. My shoulders slumped in surrender.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m talking about you,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cMe? Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you\u2019re a bloody Highlander, and you\u2019re all about honor and courage and constancy, and I know you can\u2019t help it, and I wouldn\u2019t want you to, only\u2014only damn it, it\u2019s going to take you to Scotland and get you killed, and there\u2019s nothing I can do about it!\u201d</p><p>He gave me a look of incredulity.</p><p>\u201cScotland?\u201d he said, as though I\u2019d said something completely mad.</p> <p>\u201cScotland! Where your bloody grave is!\u201d</p><p>He rubbed a hand slowly through his hair, looking down the bridge of his nose at me.</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d he said at last. \u201cI see, then. Ye think if I go to Scotland, I must die there, since that\u2019s where I\u2019ll be buried. Is that it?\u201d</p><p>I nodded, too upset to speak.</p><p>\u201cMmphm. And just why is it ye think I\u2019m going to Scotland?\u201d he asked carefully.</p><p>I glared at him in exasperation, and waved an arm at the expanse of wilderness around us.</p><p>\u201cWhere the hell else are you going to get settlers for this land? Of course you\u2019re going to Scotland!\u201d</p><p>He looked at me, exasperated in turn.</p><p>\u201cHow in the name of God d\u2019ye think I should do that, Sassenach? I might have, when I had the gems, but now? I\u2019ve maybe ten pound to my name, and that\u2019s borrowed. Shall I fly to Scotland like a bird, then? And lead folk back behind me, walkin\u2019 on the water?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll think of something,\u201d I said miserably. \u201cYou always do.\u201d</p><p>He gave me a queer look, then looked away and paused for several moments before answering.</p><p>\u201cI hadna realized ye thought I was God Almighty, Sassenach,\u201d he said at last.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t,\u201d I said. \u201cMoses, maybe.\u201d The words were facetious, but neither one of us was joking.</p><p>He walked away a bit, hands clasped behind his back.</p><p>\u201cWatch out for the burs,\u201d I called after him, seeing him heading for the location of my recent mishap. He altered his path in response, but said nothing. He walked to and fro across the clearing, head bent in thought. At last he came back, to stand in front of me.</p><p>\u201cI canna do it alone,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cYou\u2019re right about that. But I dinna think I need go to Scotland for my settlers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy men\u2014the men who were wi\u2019 me in Ardsmuir,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re here already.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you haven\u2019t any idea where they are,\u201d I protested. \u201cAnd besides, they were transported years ago! They\u2019ll be settled; they won\u2019t want to pull up stakes and come to the ends of the bloody earth with you!\u201d</p><p>He smiled, a little wryly.</p><p>\u201cYou did, Sassenach.\u201d</p><p>I took a deep breath. The nagging weight of fear that had burdened my heart for the last weeks had eased. With that concern lifted, though, there was now room in my mind to contemplate the staggering difficulty of the task he was setting himself. Track down men scattered over three colonies, persuade them to come with him, and simultaneously find sufficient capital to finance the clearing of land and planting of crops. To say nothing of the sheer enormity of labor involved in carving some small foothold out of this virgin wilderness.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll think of something,\u201d he said, smiling slightly as he watched doubts and uncertainties flit across my face. \u201cI always do, aye?\u201d</p><p>All of my breath went out in a long sigh.</p><p>\u201cYou do,\u201d I said. \u201cJamie\u2014are you sure? Your aunt Jocasta\u2014\u201d</p><p>He dismissed that possibility with a flick of his hand.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said. \u201cNever.\u201d</p><p>I still hesitated, feeling guilty.</p><p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t\u2014it\u2019s not just because of me? What I said about keeping slaves?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said. He paused, and I saw the two twisted fingers of his right hand twitch. He saw it, too, and stopped the movement abruptly.</p><p>\u201cI have lived as a slave, Claire,\u201d he said quietly, head bent. \u201cAnd I couldna live, knowing there was a man on earth who felt toward me as I have felt toward those who thought they owned me.\u201d</p><p>I reached out and covered his crippled hand with my own. Tears ran down my cheeks, warm and soothing as summer rain.</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t leave me?\u201d I asked at last. \u201cYou won\u2019t die?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head, and squeezed my hand tight.</p><p>\u201cYou are my courage, as I am your conscience,\u201d he whispered. \u201cYou are my heart\u2014and I your compassion. We are neither of us whole, alone. Do ye not know that, Sassenach?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do know that,\u201d I said, and my voice shook. \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m so afraid. I don\u2019t want to be half a person again, I can\u2019t bear it.\u201d</p><p>He thumbed a lock of hair off my wet cheek, and pulled me into his arms, so close that I could feel the rise and fall of his chest as he breathed. He was so solid, so alive, ruddy hair curling gold against bare skin. And yet I had held him so before\u2014and lost him.</p><p>His hand touched my cheek, warm despite the dampness of my skin.</p><p>\u201cBut do ye not see how verra small a thing is the notion of death, between us two, Claire?\u201d he whispered.</p><p>My hands curled into fists against his chest. No, I didn\u2019t think it a small thing at all.</p><p>\u201cAll the time after ye left me, after Culloden\u2014I was dead then, was I not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you were. That\u2019s why I\u2014oh.\u201d I took a deep, tremulous breath, and he nodded.</p><p>\u201cTwo hundred years from now, I shall most certainly be dead, Sassenach,\u201d he said. He smiled crookedly. \u201cBe it Indians, wild beasts, a plague, the hangman\u2019s rope, or only the blessing of auld age\u2014I will be dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd while ye were there\u2014in your own time\u2014I was dead, no?\u201d</p><p>I nodded, wordless. Even now, I could look back and see the abyss of despair into which that parting had dropped me, and from which I had climbed, one painful inch at a time.</p><p>Now I stood with him again upon the summit of life, and could not contemplate descent. He reached down and plucked a stalk of grass, spreading the soft green beards between his fingers.</p><p>\u201c \u2018Man is like the grass of the field,\u2019 \u201d he quoted softly, brushing the slender stem over my knuckles, where they rested against his chest. \u201c \u2018Today it blooms; tomorrow it withers and is cast into the oven.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>He lifted the silky green tuft to his lips and kissed it, then touched it gently to my mouth.</p><p>\u201cI was dead, my Sassenach\u2014and yet all that time, I loved you.\u201d</p><p>I closed my eyes, feeling the tickle of the grass on my lips, light as the touch of sun and air.</p><p>\u201cI loved you, too,\u201d I whispered. \u201cI always will.\u201d</p><p>The grass fell away. Eyes still closed, I felt him lean toward me, and his mouth on mine, warm as sun, light as air.</p><p>\u201cSo long as my body lives, and yours\u2014we are one flesh,\u201d he whispered. His fingers touched me, hair and chin and neck and breast, and I breathed his breath and felt him solid under my hand. Then I lay with my head on his shoulder, the strength of him supporting me, the words deep and soft in his chest.</p><p>\u201cAnd when my body shall cease, my soul will still be yours. Claire\u2014I swear by my hope of heaven, I will not be parted from you.\u201d</p><p>The wind stirred the leaves of the chestnut trees nearby, and the scents of late summer rose up rich around us; pine and grass and strawberries, sunwarmed stone and cool water, and the sharp, musky smell of his body next to mine.</p><p>\u201cNothing is lost, Sassenach; only changed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the first law of thermodynamics,\u201d I said, wiping my nose.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s faith.\u201d</p><p>PART SIX</p><p>Je T\u2019Aime</p><p>17</p><p>HOME FOR THE HOLIDAYS</p><p>Inverness, Scotland, December 23, 1969</p><p>He checked the train schedule for the dozenth time, then prowled around the manse\u2019s living room, too restless to settle. An hour yet to wait.</p><p>The room was half dismantled, with piles of cartons lying higgledy-piggledy on every surface. He\u2019d promised to have the place cleared out by the New Year, except for the pieces Fiona wanted to keep. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He wandered down the hall and into the kitchen, stood staring into the ancient refrigerator for a moment, decided he wasn\u2019t hungry and closed the door.</p><p>He wished that Mrs. Graham and the Reverend could have met Brianna, and she them. He smiled at the empty kitchen table, remembering an adolescent conversation with the two elderly people, when he, in the grip of a mad\u2014and unrequited\u2014lust for the tobacconist\u2019s daughter, had asked how to know if one was truly in love.</p><p>\u201cIf ye have to ask yourself if you\u2019re in love, laddie\u2014then ye aren\u2019t,\u201d Mrs. Graham had assured him, tapping her spoon on the edge of her mixing bowl for emphasis. \u201cAnd keep your paws off wee Mavis MacDowell, or her Da will murder ye.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen you\u2019re in love, Rog, you\u2019ll know it with no telling,\u201d the Reverend had chimed in, dipping a finger in the cake batter. He ducked in mock alarm as Mrs. Graham raised a threatening spoon, and laughed. \u201cAnd do mind yourself with young Mavis, lad; I\u2019m not old enough to be a grandfather.\u201d</p> <p>Well, they\u2019d been right. He knew, with no telling\u2014had known since he\u2019d met Brianna Randall. What he didn\u2019t know for sure was whether Brianna felt the same.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t wait any longer. He slapped his pocket to be sure of his keys, ran down the stairs and out into the winter rain that had begun to pelt down just after breakfast. They did say a cold shower was the thing. Hadn\u2019t worked with Mavis, though.</p><p>December 24, 1969</p><p>\u201cNow, the plum pudding\u2019s in the warming oven, and the hard sauce in the wee pan to the back,\u201d Fiona instructed him, pulling on her fuzzy woolen hat. It was red, Fiona was short, and in it she looked like a garden gnome.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t turn up the flame too high, mind. And dinna turn it out altogether, either, or you\u2019ll never get it lit again. And here, I\u2019ve the directions for the birds for tomorrow all written out, they\u2019re stuffed in their pan, and I\u2019ve left the veg already chopped to go along in the big yellow bowl in the fridge, and...\u201d She fumbled in the pocket of her jeans and withdrew a handwritten slip of paper, which she thrust into his hand.</p> <p>He patted her on the head.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Fiona,\u201d he assured her. \u201cWe won\u2019t burn the place down. Nor starve, either.\u201d</p><p>She frowned dubiously, hesitating at the door. Her fianc\u00e9, sitting in his car outside, revved his engine in an impatient sort of way.</p><p>\u201cAye, well. You\u2019re sure the two of ye won\u2019t come with us? Ernie\u2019s Mam wouldna mind it a bit, and I\u2019m sure she\u2019d not think it right, just the two of ye left here by yourselves to keep Christmas...\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Fiona,\u201d he said, edging her gently backward out the door. \u201cWe\u2019ll manage fine. You have a nice holiday with Ernie, and don\u2019t bother about us.\u201d</p><p>She sighed, giving in reluctantly. \u201cAye, I suppose you\u2019ll do.\u201d A short, irritable beep! from behind made her turn and glare at the car.</p> <p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m coming then, aren\u2019t I?\u201d she demanded. Turning back, she beamed suddenly at Roger, threw her arms about him, and standing on tiptoe, kissed him firmly on the lips.</p><p>She drew back and winked conspiratorially, screwing up her small, round face. \u201cThat\u2019ll sort our Ernie out,\u201d she whispered. \u201cHappy Christmas, Rog!\u201d she said loudly, and with a g*y wave, hopped off the porch and strolled in leisurely fashion toward the car, h*ps swinging just a bit.</p><p>Its engine roaring in protest, the car shot off with a squeal of tires before the door had quite shut behind Fiona. Roger stood on the porch waving, pleased that Ernie wasn\u2019t an especially massive bloke.</p><p>The door opened behind him and Brianna poked her head out.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing out here with no coat on?\u201d she inquired. \u201cIt\u2019s freezing!\u201d</p><p>He hesitated, tempted to tell her. After all, it had evidently worked on Ernie. But it was Christmas Eve, he reminded himself. In spite of the lowering sky and plummeting temperature, he felt warm and tingling all over. He smiled at her.</p><p>\u201cJust seeing Fiona off,\u201d he said, pulling back the door. \u201cShall we see if we can make lunch without blowing up the kitchen?\u201d</p><p>They managed sandwiches without incident, and returned after lunch to the study. The room was nearly empty now; only a few shelves of books remained to be sorted and packed.</p> <p>On the one hand, Roger felt immense relief that the job was nearly done. On the other, it was sad to see the warm, cluttered study reduced to such a shell of its former self.</p><p>The Reverend\u2019s big desk had been emptied and removed to the garage for storage, the floor-to-ceiling shelves denuded of their huge burden of books, the cork-lined wall stripped of its many layers of fluttering papers. This process reminded Roger uncomfortably of chicken-plucking, the result being a stark and pathetic bareness that made him want to avert his eyes.</p><p>There was one square of paper still pinned to the cork. He\u2019d take that down last.</p><p>\u201cWhat about these?\u201d Brianna waved a feather duster inquiringly at a small stack of books that sat on the table before her. An array of boxes gaped on the floor at her feet, half filled with books destined for various fates: libraries, antiquarian societies, friends of the Reverend\u2019s, Roger\u2019s personal use.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re autographed, but not inscribed to anybody,\u201d she said, handing him the top one. \u201cYou\u2019ve got the set he inscribed to your father, but do you want these, too? They\u2019re first editions.\u201d</p><p>Roger turned the book over in his hands. It was one of Frank Randall\u2019s, a lovely book, beautifully typeset and bound to match the elegance of its scholarly content.</p><p>\u201cYou should have them, shouldn\u2019t you?\u201d he said. Without waiting for an answer, he set the book gently into a small box that rested on the seat of an armchair. \u201cYour dad\u2019s work, after all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got some,\u201d she protested. \u201cTons. Boxes and boxes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot autographed, though?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, no.\u201d She picked up another of the books and flipped it open to the flyleaf, where Tempora mutantur nos et mutamur in illis\u2014F. W. Randall was written in a strong, slanting hand. She rubbed a finger gently over the signature, and her wide mouth softened.</p><p>\u201cThe times are changing, and we with them. You\u2019re sure you don\u2019t want them, Roger?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d he said, and smiled. He waved a wry hand at their book-strewn surroundings. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, you won\u2019t leave me short.\u201d</p><p>She laughed and put the books in her own box, then went back to her work, dusting and wiping the stacked and sorted books before packing them. Most hadn\u2019t been cleaned in forty years, and she was liberally smudged herself by this time, long fingers grimy and the cuffs of her white shirt nearly black with filth.</p><p>\u201cWon\u2019t you miss this place?\u201d she asked. She wiped a strand of hair out of her eyes and gestured at the spacious room. \u201cYou grew up here, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, and yes,\u201d he answered, heaving another full carton onto the pile to be shipped to the university library. \u201cNot much choice, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess you couldn\u2019t live here,\u201d she agreed regretfully. \u201cSince you have to be in Oxford most of the time. But do you have to sell it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t sell it. It\u2019s not mine.\u201d He stooped to get a grip on an extra-large carton, and rose slowly to his feet, grunting with effort. He staggered across the room and dropped it onto the stack, with a thud that raised small puffs of dust from the boxes beneath it.</p><p>\u201cWhew!\u201d He blew out his breath, grinning at her. \u201cGod help the antiquarians when they pick that one up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean, it\u2019s not yours?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat I said,\u201d he replied matter-of-factly. \u201cIt isn\u2019t mine. The house and land belong to the church; Dad lived here for near fifty years, but he didn\u2019t own it. It belongs to the Parish Council. The new minister doesn\u2019t want it\u2014he\u2019s got money of his own, and a wife who likes mod cons\u2014so the Council\u2019s putting it to let. Fiona and her Ernie are taking it, heaven help them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust the two of them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s cheap. For good reason,\u201d he added wryly. \u201cShe wants lots of kids, though\u2014be room for an army of them here, I can tell you.\u201d Designed in Victorian times for ministers with numerous families, the manse had twelve rooms\u2014not counting one unmodernized and highly inconvenient bath.</p><p>\u201cThe wedding\u2019s in February, so that\u2019s why I\u2019ve got to finish the clearing up over Christmas, to give time for the cleaners and painters to come in. Shame to make you work on your holiday, though. Maybe we\u2019ll drive down to Fort William Monday?\u201d</p><p>Brianna picked up another book, but didn\u2019t put it in the box right away.</p><p>\u201cSo your home\u2019s gone for good,\u201d she said, slowly. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t seem right\u2014though I\u2019m glad Fiona will have it.\u201d</p><p>Roger shrugged.</p><p>\u201cNot as though I meant to settle in Inverness,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s not as though it were an ancestral seat or anything.\u201d He waved at the cracked linoleum, the grubby enamel paint, and the ancient glass-bowl light fixture overhead. \u201cCan\u2019t put it on the National Trust and charge people two quid each to tour the place.\u201d</p><p>She smiled at that, and returned to her sorting. She seemed pensive, though, a small frown visible between her thick red brows. Finally she put the last book in the box, stretched and sighed.</p><p>\u201cThe Reverend had nearly as many books as my parents,\u201d she said. \u201cBetween Mama\u2019s medical books and Daddy\u2019s historical stuff, they left enough to supply a whole library. It\u2019ll probably take six months to sort it all out, when I get ho\u2014when I go back.\u201d She bit her lip lightly, and turned to pick up a roll of packing tape, picking at it with a fingernail. \u201cI told the real estate agent she could list the house for sale by summer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what\u2019s been bothering you?\u201d he said slowly, realization dawning as he watched her face. \u201cThinking about taking apart the house you grew up in\u2014having your home gone for good?\u201d</p><p>One shoulder lifted slightly, her eyes still fixed on the recalcitrant tape.</p><p>\u201cIf you can stand it, I guess I can. Besides,\u201d she went on, \u201cit\u2019s not that bad. Mama took care of almost everything\u2014she found a tenant and had the house leased for a year, so I could have time to decide what to do, without worrying about it just sitting there vacant. But it\u2019s silly to keep it; it\u2019s way too big for me to live in alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou might get married.\u201d He blurted it out without thinking.</p><p>\u201cGuess I might,\u201d she said. She glanced at him sidelong, and the corner of her mouth twitched in what might have been amusement. \u201cSomeday. But what if my husband didn\u2019t want to live in Boston?\u201d</p><p>It occurred to him quite suddenly that her concern over his losing the manse might\u2014just possibly\u2014have been that she envisioned herself living in it.</p><p>\u201cD\u2019you want kids?\u201d he asked abruptly. He hadn\u2019t thought to ask before, but hoped like hell she did. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She looked momentarily startled, but then laughed.</p><p>\u201cOnly children usually want big families, don\u2019t they?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCouldn\u2019t say,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I do.\u201d He leaned across the boxes and kissed her suddenly.</p><p>\u201cMe too,\u201d she said. Her eyes went slanted when she smiled. She didn\u2019t look away, but a faint blush made her look like a spring-ripe apricot.</p> <p>He wanted kids, all right; just at the moment, he wanted to do what led to kids a lot more.</p><p>\u201cBut maybe we should finish clearing up, first?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d The sense of her words penetrated only vaguely. \u201cOh. Yeah. Right, guess we should.\u201d</p><p>He bent his head and kissed her again, slowly this time. She had the most wonderful mouth; wide and full-lipped, almost too big for her face\u2014but not quite.</p><p>He had her round the waist, his other hand tangled in silky hair. The nape of her neck was smooth and warm under his hand; he gripped it and she shivered slightly, mouth opening in a small sign of submission that made him want to lean her backward over his arm, carry her down to the hearth rug, and...</p> <p>A brisk rapping made him jerk his head up, startled out of the embrace.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s that?\u201d Brianna exclaimed, hand to her heart.</p><p>The study was lined on one side by floor-to-ceiling windows\u2014the Reverend had been a painter\u2014and a square, whiskered face was pressed against one of these, nose nearly flattened with interest.</p><p>\u201cThat,\u201d said Roger through his teeth, \u201cis the postman, MacBeth. What the hell is the old bugger doing out there?\u201d</p><p>As though hearing this inquiry, Mr. MacBeth stepped back a pace, drew a letter out of his bag and brandished it jovially at the occupants of the study.</p><p>\u201cA letter,\u201d he mouthed elaborately, looking at Brianna. He cut his eyes toward Roger and beetled his brows in a knowing leer.</p> <p>By the time Roger reached the front door, Mr. MacBeth was standing on the porch, holding the letter.</p><p>\u201cWhy did you not put it in the letter slot, for God\u2019s sake?\u201d Roger demanded. \u201cGive it here, then.\u201d</p><p>Mr. MacBeth held the letter out of reach and assumed an air of injured dignity, somewhat impaired by his attempts to see Brianna over Roger\u2019s shoulder.</p><p>\u201cThought it might be important, didn\u2019t I? From the States, i\u2019nt it? And it\u2019s for the young lady, not you, lad.\u201d Screwing up his face into a massive and indelicate wink, he oiled past Roger, arm extended toward Brianna.</p><p>\u201cMa\u2019am,\u201d he said, simpering through his whiskers. \u201cWith the compliments of Her Majesty\u2019s Mail.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d Brianna was still rosily flushed, but she\u2019d smoothed her hair, and smiled at MacBeth with every evidence of self-possession. She took the letter and glanced at it, but made no move to open it. The envelope was handwritten, Roger saw, with red postal-forwarding marks, but the distance was too far to make out the return address.</p><p>\u201cVisiting, are ye, ma\u2019am?\u201d MacBeth asked heartily. \u201cJust the two of ye here, all on your ownie-o?\u201d He was giving Brianna a rolling eye, looking her up and down with frank interest.</p><p>\u201cOh, no,\u201d Brianna said, straight-faced. She folded the letter in half and stuffed it into the back pocket of her jeans. \u201cUncle Angus is staying with us; he\u2019s asleep upstairs.\u201d</p> <p>Roger bit the inside of his cheek. Uncle Angus was a moth-eaten stuffed Scottie, a remnant of his own youth, unearthed during the cleaning of the house. Brianna, charmed with him, had dusted off his plaid bonnet and placed him on her own bed in the guest room.</p><p>The postman\u2019s heavy brows rose.</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d he said, rather blankly. \u201cAye, I see. He\u2019ll be an American, too, then, your uncle Angus?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, he\u2019s from Aberdeen.\u201d Other than a slight pinkening at the end of her nose, Brianna\u2019s face showed nothing but the most open guilelessness.</p><p>Mr. MacBeth was enchanted.</p><p>\u201cOh, you\u2019ve a wee bit of Scots in your family, then! Well, and I should have known it, now, you wi\u2019 that hair. A bonnie, bonnie lass, and no mistake.\u201d He shook his head in admiration, lechery replaced by a pseudoavuncular air that Roger found only slightly less objectionable.</p><p>\u201cYes, well.\u201d Roger cleared his throat meaningfully. \u201cI\u2019m sure we don\u2019t want to keep you from your work, MacBeth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, it\u2019s no trouble, no trouble at all,\u201d the postman assured him, craning to catch a last glimpse of Brianna as he turned to go. \u201cNay rest for the weary, is there, my dear?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s \u2018no rest for the wicked,\u2019 \u201d Roger said, with some emphasis, opening the door. \u201cGood day to you, MacBeth.\u201d</p><p>MacBeth glanced at him, the shadow of a leer back on his face.</p><p>\u201cA good day to you, Mr. Wakefield.\u201d He leaned close, dug Roger in the ribs with an elbow, and whispered hoarsely, \u201cAnd a better night, if her uncle sleeps sound!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere, going to read your letter?\u201d He plucked it from the table where she had dropped it, and held it out to her.</p><p>She flushed slightly and took it from him.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not important. I\u2019ll look at it later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go to the kitchen, if it\u2019s private.\u201d</p><p>The flush deepened.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not. It\u2019s nothing.\u201d</p><p>He raised one eyebrow. She shrugged impatiently, and ripped open the flap, pulling out a single sheet of paper.</p><p>\u201cSee for yourself, then. I told you, it\u2019s nothing important.\u201d</p><p>Oh, isn\u2019t it? he thought, but didn\u2019t say anything aloud. He took the proffered sheet and glanced at it.</p><p>It was in fact nothing much; a notification forwarded from the library at her university, to the effect that a specific reference she had requested was unfortunately not obtainable via interlibrary loan, but could be viewed in the private collection of the Stuart Papers, held in the Royal Annexe of Edinburgh University.</p><p>She was watching him when he looked up, arms folded, her eyes shiny and lips tight, daring him to say something.</p><p>\u201cYou should have told me you were looking for him,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cI could have helped.\u201d</p><p>She shrugged slightly, and he saw her throat move as she swallowed.</p><p>\u201cI know how to do historical research. I used to help my fa\u2014\u201d She broke off, lower lip caught between her teeth.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I see,\u201d he said, and did. He took her by the arm and steered her down the hall to the kitchen, where he plunked her in a chair at the battered old table.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll put the kettle on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like tea,\u201d she protested.</p><p>\u201cYou need tea,\u201d Roger said firmly, and lit the gas with a fiery whoosh. He turned to the cupboard and took down cups and saucers, and\u2014as an after-thought\u2014the bottle of whisky from the top shelf.</p><p>\u201cAnd I really don\u2019t like whisky,\u201d Brianna said, eyeing it. She started to push herself away from the table, but Roger stopped her with a hand on her arm.</p><p>\u201cI like whisky,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I hate to drink alone. You\u2019ll keep me company, aye?\u201d He smiled at her, willing her to smile back. At last she did, grudgingly, and relaxed in her seat.</p><p>He sat down opposite her, and filled his cup halfway with the pungent amber liquid. He breathed in the fumes with pleasure, and sipped slowly, letting the fine strong stuff roll down his throat.</p><p>\u201cAh,\u201d he breathed. \u201cGlen Morangie. Sure you won\u2019t join me? A wee splash in your tea, maybe?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head silently, but when the kettle began to whistle, she got up to take it off the fire and pour the hot water into the waiting pot. Roger got up and came behind her, slipping his arms around her waist.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nothing to be ashamed of,\u201d he said softly. \u201cYou\u2019ve a right to know, if you can. Jamie Fraser was your father, after all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut he wasn\u2019t\u2014not really.\u201d Her head was bent; he could see the neat whorl of a cowlick at her crown, an echo of the one in the center of her forehead, that lifted her hair in a soft wave off her face.</p><p>\u201cI had a father,\u201d she said, sounding a little choked. \u201cDaddy\u2014Frank Randall\u2014he was my father, and I love\u2014loved him. It doesn\u2019t seem right to\u2014to go looking for something else, like he wasn\u2019t enough, like\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not it, then, and you know it.\u201d He turned her round and lifted her chin with a finger.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nothing to do with Frank Randall or how you feel about him\u2014aye, he was your father, and there\u2019s not a thing will ever change that. But it\u2019s natural to be curious, to want to know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you ever want to know?\u201d Her hand came up and brushed his away\u2014but she clung to his fingers, holding on.</p><p>He took a deep breath, finding comfort in the whisky.</p><p>\u201cYeah. Yes, I did. You need to, I think.\u201d His fingers tightened around hers, drawing her toward the table. \u201cCome sit down; I\u2019ll tell you.\u201d</p><p>He knew what missing a father felt like, especially an unknown father. For a time, just after he\u2019d started school, he\u2019d pored obsessively over his father\u2019s medals, carried the little velvet case about in his pocket, boasted to his friends about his father\u2019s heroism.</p><p>\u201cTold stories about him, all made up,\u201d he said, looking down into the aromatic depths of his teacup. \u201cGot bashed for being a nuisance, got smacked at school for lying.\u201d He looked up at her, and smiled, a little painfully.</p><p>\u201cI had to make him real, see?\u201d</p><p>She nodded, eyes dark with understanding.</p><p>He took another deep gulp of the whisky, not bothering to savor it.</p><p>\u201cLuckily Dad\u2014the Reverend\u2014he seemed to know the trouble. He began to tell me stories about my father; the real ones. Nothing special, nothing heroic\u2014he was a hero, all right, Jerry MacKenzie, got shot down and all, but the stories Dad told were all about what he was like as a kid\u2014how he made a martin house, but made the hole too big and a cuckoo got in; what he liked to eat when he\u2019d come here on holiday and they\u2019d go into town for a treat; how he filled his pockets with winkles off the rocks and forgot about them and ruined his trousers with the stink\u2014\u201d He broke off, and smiled at her, his throat still tight at the memory.</p><p>\u201cHe made my father real to me. And I missed him more than ever, because then I knew a bit about what I was missing\u2014but I had to know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome people would say you can\u2019t miss what you never had\u2014that it\u2019s better not to know at all.\u201d Brianna lifted her cup, blue eyes steady over the rim.</p><p>\u201cSome people are fools. Or cowards.\u201d</p><p>He poured another tot of whisky into his cup, tilted the bottle toward her with a lifted brow. She held out her cup without comment, and he splashed whisky into it. She drank from it, and set it down.</p><p>\u201cWhat about your mother?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cI had a few real memories of her; I was nearly five when she died. And there are the boxes in the garage\u2014\u201d He tilted his head toward the window. \u201cAll her things, her letters. It\u2019s like Dad said, \u2018Everybody needs a history.\u2019 Mine was out there; I knew if I ever needed to, I could find out more.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He studied her for a long moment.</p><p>\u201cYou miss her a lot?\u201d he said. \u201cClaire?\u201d</p><p>She glanced at him, nodded briefly, and drank, then held out her empty cup for more.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m\u2014I was\u2014afraid to look,\u201d she said, eyes fixed on the stream of whisky.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not just him\u2014it\u2019s her, too. I mean, I know his stories, Jamie Fraser\u2019s; she told me a lot about him. A lot more than I\u2019ll ever find in historical records,\u201d she added with a feeble attempt at a smile. She took a deep breath.</p><p>\u201cBut Mama\u2014at first I tried to pretend she was only gone, like on a trip. And then when I couldn\u2019t do that anymore, I tried to believe she was dead.\u201d Her nose was running, from emotion, whisky, or the heat of the tea. Roger reached for the tea towel hanging by the stove and shoved it across the table to her.</p><p>\u201cShe isn\u2019t, though.\u201d She picked up the towel and wiped angrily at her nose. \u201cThat\u2019s the trouble! I have to miss her all the time, and know that I\u2019ll never see her again, but she isn\u2019t even dead! How can I mourn for her, when I think\u2014when I hope\u2014she\u2019s happy where she is, when I made her go?\u201d</p><p>She gulped the rest of her cup, choked slightly, and got her breath. She fixed Roger with a dark blue glare, as though he were to blame for the situation.</p><p>\u201cSo I want to find out, all right? I want to find her\u2014find them. See if she\u2019s all right. But I keep thinking maybe I don\u2019t want to find out, because what if I find out she\u2019s not all right, what if I find out something horrible? What if I find out she\u2019s dead, or he is\u2014well, that wouldn\u2019t matter so much, maybe, because he already is dead anyway, or he was, or\u2014but I have to, I know I have to!\u201d</p> <p>She banged her cup down on the table in front of him.</p><p>\u201cMore.\u201d</p><p>He opened his mouth to say that she\u2019d had a good bit more than she needed already, but a glance at her face changed his mind. He shut his mouth and poured.</p><p>She didn\u2019t wait for him to add tea, but raised the cup to her mouth and took a large swallow, and another. She coughed, sputtered, and set the cup down, eyes watering.</p><p>\u201cSo I\u2019m looking. Or I was. When I saw Daddy\u2019s books, and his handwriting, though...it all seemed wrong, then. Do you think I\u2019m wrong?\u201d she asked, peering woefully at him through tear-clogged lashes.</p><p>\u201cNo, hen,\u201d he said gently. \u201cIt\u2019s not wrong. You\u2019re right, you\u2019ve got to know. I\u2019ll help you.\u201d He stood up and, taking her under the arms, hoisted her to her feet. \u201cBut right now, I think you should maybe have a bit of a lie-down, hm?\u201d</p> <p>He got her up the stairs and halfway down the hall, when she suddenly broke free and darted into the bathroom. He leaned against the wall outside, waiting patiently until she staggered out again, her face the color of the aged plaster above the wainscoting.</p><p>\u201cWaste of Glen Morangie, that,\u201d he said, taking her by the shoulders and steering her into the bedroom. \u201cIf I\u2019d known I was dealing with a sot, I\u2019d have given you the cheap stuff.\u201d</p><p>She collapsed on the bed, and allowed him to take off her shoes and socks. She rolled onto her stomach, Uncle Angus cradled in the crook of her arm.</p><p>\u201cI told you I didn\u2019t like tea,\u201d she mumbled, and was asleep in seconds.</p><p>Roger worked for an hour or two by himself, sorting books and tying cartons. It was a quiet, dark afternoon, with no sound but a soft patter of rain and the occasional whoosh of a car\u2019s tires on the street outside. When the light began to fail, he turned on the lamps and went down the hall to the kitchen, to wash the book grime from his hands.</p><p>A huge pot of milky cock-a-leekie soup was burbling on the back of the cooker. What had Fiona said to do about that? Turn it up? Turn it off? Throw things into it? He peered dubiously into the pot and decided to leave well enough alone.</p><p>He tidied up the remains of their impromptu tea\u2014rinsed the cups and dried them, hung them carefully from their hooks in the cupboard. They were remnants of the old willow pattern set the Reverend had had for as long as Roger could remember, the blue-and-white Chinese trees and pagodas augmented by odd bits of ill-assorted crockery acquired from jumble sales.</p><p>Fiona would have all new, of course. She\u2019d forced them to look at magazine pictures of china and crystal and flatware. Brianna had made suitable admiring noises; Roger\u2019s eyes had gone glassy from boredom. He supposed the old stuff would all end up at the jumble sale\u2014at least it might still be useful to someone.</p> <p>On impulse, he took down the two cups he\u2019d washed, wrapped them in a clean tea towel, and took them to the study, where he tucked them into the box he\u2019d set aside for himself. He felt thoroughly foolish, but at the same time, somewhat better.</p><p>He looked around the echoing study, quite bare now save for the single sheet of paper on the cork-lined wall.</p><p>So your home\u2019s gone for good. Well, he\u2019d left home some time ago, hadn\u2019t he?</p><p>Yeah, it bothered him. A lot more than he\u2019d let on to Brianna, in fact. That was why it had taken so bloody long to finish clearing out the manse, if he was honest about it. True, it was a monster task, true, he had his own job to do at Oxford, and true, the thousands of books had had to be sorted with care\u2014but he could have done it faster. If he\u2019d wanted.</p><p>With the house standing vacant, he might never have got the job finished. But with the impetus of Fiona behind, and the lure of Brianna before...he smiled at the thought of the two of them: little dark, curly-headed wren, and tall fire-haired Viking. Likely it took women to get men to do anything much.</p><p>Time to finish up, though.</p><p>With a sense of somber ceremony, he unpinned the corners of the yellowed sheet of paper and took it down from the cork. It was his family tree, a genealogical chart made out in the Reverend\u2019s neat round hand.</p><p>MacKenzies and more MacKenzies, generations of them. He\u2019d thought lately of taking back the name permanently, not just for the singing. After all, with Dad gone he didn\u2019t mean to come back much more to Inverness, where folk would know him as Wakefield. That had been the point of the genealogy, after all; that Roger shouldn\u2019t forget who he was.</p><p>Dad had known a few individual stories, but no more than the names for most of the people on the list. And he hadn\u2019t known even that, for the most important one\u2014the woman whose green eyes Roger saw each morning in the mirror. She was nowhere on this list, for good reason.</p><p>Roger\u2019s finger stopped near the top of the chart. There he was, the changeling\u2014William Buccleigh MacKenzie. Given to foster parents to raise, the illegitimate offspring of the war chieftain of clan MacKenzie, and of a witch condemned to burning. Dougal MacKenzie and the witch Geillis Duncan.</p><p>Not a witch at all, of course, but something just as dangerous. He had her eyes\u2014or so Claire said. Had he inherited something more from her as well? Was the terrifying ability to travel through the stones passed down unsuspected through generations of respectable boatwrights and herdsmen?</p><p>He thought of it each time he saw the chart now\u2014and for that reason, tried not to look. He appreciated Brianna\u2019s ambivalence; he understood all too well the razor\u2019s edge between fear and curiosity, the pull between the need to know and the fear of finding out.</p><p>Well, he could help Brianna find out. And for himself...</p><p>Roger slipped the chart into a folder, and put it in the box. He closed the top of the carton, and added an \u201cX\u201d of sticky tape across the flap for good measure.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s that, then,\u201d he said aloud, and left the empty room.</p><p>He stopped at the head of the stairs, taken by surprise.</p><p>Brianna had been bathing, braving the ancient geyser with its cracked enamel and rumbling flame. Now she stepped into the hall, wearing nothing but a towel.</p><p>She turned down the hall, not seeing him. Roger stood very still, listening to the thud of his heart, feeling his palm slick on the polished banister.</p><p>She was modestly covered; he had seen more of her in the halters and shorts she had worn in the summer. It was the fragility of her covering that roused him; the knowledge that he could undress her with one quick tug. That, and the knowledge that they were quite alone in the house.</p><p>Dynamite.</p><p>He took a step after her, and stopped. She had heard him; she stopped, too, but it was a long moment before she turned around. Her feet were bare, high-arched and long-toed; the slender curves of her wet footprints were dark on the worn runner that covered the floor of the hallway.</p><p>She didn\u2019t say anything. Just looked at him straight-on, her eyes dark and slanting. She stood against the tall window at the end of the hall, her swaddled figure black against the pale gray light of the rainy day outside.</p><p>If he should touch her, he knew how she would feel. Her skin would be still hot from the bath, damp in the crevices of knee and thigh and elbow. He could smell her, the minglings of shampoo and soap and powder, the smell of her flesh masked by the ghosts of flowers.</p><p>Her footprints on the runner stretched before him, a fragile chain of footsteps linking them. He kicked off his sandals and planted a bare foot on one of the prints she had left; it was cool on his skin.</p><p>There were drops of water on her shoulders, matching the droplets on the windowpane behind her, as though she had stepped through it out of the rain. She lifted her head as he came toward her, and with a shake, let the towel wrapped round her head fall off.</p><p>The bronze snakes of her hair fell gleaming, brushed his cheek with wet. Not a Gorgon\u2019s beauty, but a water spirit\u2019s, changing shape from serpent-maned horse to magic woman.</p><p>\u201cKelpie,\u201d he whispered against the flushed curve of her cheek. \u201cYou look like you\u2019ve come straight out of a Highland burn.\u201d She put her arms around his neck, let go of the towel; only the pressure of their bodies held it between them.</p><p>Her back was bare. Cold air from the window raised the hair on his forearm, even as her skin warmed his palm. He wanted at once to pull the towel about her, shelter her, cover her from the cold; at the same time, to strip both her and himself, take her heat to himself and give her his own, right there in the damp and drafty hallway.</p><p>\u201cSteam,\u201d he whispered. \u201cGod, you\u2019re steaming.\u201d</p><p>Her mouth curved against his.</p><p>\u201cThat makes two of us, and you haven\u2019t had a bath. Roger\u2014\u201d Her hand was on the back of his neck, fingers cool. She opened her mouth to say something more, but he kissed her, feeling hot damp seep through the fabric of his shirt.</p><p>Her br**sts rose against him and her mouth opened under his. The muffling terry cloth hid the outlines of her br**sts from his hands but not his imagination; he could see them in his mind\u2019s eye, round and smooth, with that faint, enchanting wobble of full flesh.</p><p>His hand drifted lower, grasping the swell of bare buttock. She shied, lost her balance, and the two of them collapsed awkwardly, grappling with each other in an effort to stay upright.</p><p>Roger\u2019s knees hit the floor, and he dragged her down with him. She tilted and sprawled, landing laughing on her back.</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d She grabbed for her towel, then abandoned it as he lunged over her, kissing her again.</p><p>He\u2019d been right about her br**sts. The one under his hand was bare now, full and soft, the nipple hard in the center of his palm. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Dynamite, and the fuse was lit.</p><p>His other hand rested at the top of her thigh under the towel, close enough that he could feel the damp curls brush his finger. God, what color was it? Deep auburn, as he\u2019d imagined? Copper and bronze, like the hair of her head?</p><p>Despite himself, his hand slid farther, dying to cup the soft slippery fullness he could sense, so close. With an effort that made him dizzy, he stopped.</p><p>Her hand was on his arm, pulling him back down.</p> <p>\u201cPlease,\u201d she whispered. \u201cPlease, I want you to.\u201d</p><p>He felt hollow as a bell; his heartbeat echoed in head and chest and painfully hard between his legs. He closed his eyes, breathing, pressing his hands against the rough fiber of the rug, trying to erase the feel of her skin, lest he grab at her again.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said, and his voice sounded queer, hoarse to his own ear. \u201cNo, not here, not like this.\u201d</p><p>She was sitting up, rising out of the dark blue towel that puddled around her hips, like a mermaid from the waves. She had cooled; her flesh was pale as marble in the gray light, but goose bumps stippled the smoothness of arms and br**sts and shoulders.</p><p>He touched her, rough skin and smooth, and drew his fingers over her lips, her broad mouth. The taste of her was still on his lips, clean skin and toothpaste\u2014and a sweet, soft tongue.</p> <p>\u201cBetter,\u201d he whispered. \u201cI want it to be better...the first time.\u201d</p><p>They knelt staring at each other, the air between them crackling with unsaid things. The fuse was still burning, but a slow match now. Roger felt rooted to the spot; perhaps it was the Gorgon, after all.</p><p>Then the smell of scorching milk rose up the stair, and both of them started up at once.</p><p>\u201cSomething\u2019s burning!\u201d Brianna said, and made a dart toward the stair, her towel clumsily back in place.</p><p>He caught her by the arm as she passed him. She was cold to the touch, chilled by the drafty hallway.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do it,\u201d he said. \u201cYou go and get dressed.\u201d</p> <p>She shot him a quick blue glance and turned, disappearing into the spare bedroom. The door clicked shut behind her and he dashed down the hall, clattering down the stair toward the smell of disaster, feeling his palm burn where he had touched her.</p><p>Downstairs, Roger dealt with the spilled and scalded soup, berating himself. Where did he get off, lunging at her like a crazed salmon en route to the spawning grounds? Ripping off her towel and grappling her to the floor\u2014Christ, she must think him next door to a rapist!</p><p>At the same time, the hot feeling that suffused his chest wasn\u2019t due either to shame or to heat from the cooker. It was the latent heat from her skin, still warming him. I want you to, she\u2019d said, and she\u2019d meant it.</p><p>He was familiar enough with the language of the body to know desire and surrender when he touched them. But what he\u2019d felt in that brief moment when her body came alive to his went a great deal farther. The universe had shifted, with a small, decisive click; he could still hear its echo in his bones.</p><p>He wanted her. He wanted all of her; not just bed, not just body. Everything, always. Suddenly the biblical injunction, one flesh, seemed something immediate, and very real. They\u2019d nearly been just that, on the floor of the hallway, and stopping as he had made him feel suddenly and peculiarly vulnerable\u2014he wasn\u2019t a whole person any longer, but only half of something not yet made.</p><p>He dumped the ruined remains of the soup into the sink. No matter; they\u2019d have supper at the pub. Best to get out of the house and away from temptation.</p><p>Supper, casual chat, and maybe a walk by the river. She\u2019d wanted to go to the Christmas Eve services. After that...</p><p>After that, he would ask her, make it formal. She would say yes, he knew. And then...</p> <p>Why, then, they would come home, to a house dark and private. With themselves alone, on a night of sacrament and secret, with love newly come into the world. And he would lift her in his arms and carry her upstairs, on a night when virginity\u2019s sacrifice was no loss of purity, but rather the birth of everlasting joy.</p><p>Roger switched out the light and left the kitchen. Behind him, forgotten, the gas flame burned blue and yellow in the dark, ardent and steady as the fires of love.</p><p>18</p><p>UNSEEMLY LUST</p><p>The Reverend Wakefield had been a kindly and ecumenical man, tolerant of all shades of religious opinion, and willing to entertain doctrines his flock would have found outrageous, if not downright blasphemous.</p><p>Still, a lifetime of exposure to the stern face of Scottish Presbyterianism and its abiding suspicion of anything \u201cRomish\u201d had left Roger with a certain residual uneasiness upon entering a Catholic church\u2014as though he might be seized at the door and forcibly baptized by outlandishly dressed minions of the True Cross.</p><p>No such violence offered as he followed Brianna into the small stone building. There was a boy in a long white robe visible at the far end of the nave, but he was peaceably engaged in lighting two pairs of tall white candles that decorated the altar. A faint, unfamiliar scent hung in the air. Roger inhaled, trying to be unobtrusive about it. Incense?</p><p>Beside him, Brianna stopped, rummaging in her purse. She took out a small circle of black lacy stuff, and bobby-pinned it to the top of her head.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what you call it,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s what you wear in church if you don\u2019t want to wear a hat or a veil. You don\u2019t really have to do it anymore, but I grew up doing it\u2014it used to be that women couldn\u2019t go into a Catholic church with their heads uncovered, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I didn\u2019t,\u201d he said, interested. \u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSaint Paul, probably,\u201d she said, whipping a comb from her purse to tidy the ends of her hair. \u201cHe thought women ought to keep their hair covered all the time, so as not to be objects of unseemly lust. Cranky old crab,\u201d she added, stuffing the comb back into the purse. \u201cMama always said he was afraid of women. Thought they were dangerous,\u201d she said, with a wide grin.</p><p>\u201cThey are.\u201d Impulsively, he leaned forward and kissed her, ignoring the stares of the people nearby.</p><p>She looked surprised, but then rocked forward on her toes and kissed him back, soft and quick. Roger heard a faint \u201cMmphm\u201d of disapproval somewhere nearby, but paid no attention.</p><p>\u201cIn kirk, and on Christmas Eve, too!\u201d came a hoarse whisper from behind.</p><p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s no the kirk exactly, Annie, it\u2019s only the vestibule, aye?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd him the meenister\u2019s lad and all!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, ye ken the saying, Annie, as the cobbler\u2019s bairns go barefoot. I daresay it\u2019s a\u2019 the same wi\u2019 a preacher\u2019s lad that\u2019s gone to the deil. Come along in, now.\u201d</p><p>The voices receded into the church, to the prim tap of Cuban heels and a man\u2019s softer shuffle accompanying. Brianna pulled back a little and looked up at him, mouth quivering with laughter.</p><p>\u201cHave you gone to the devil?\u201d</p><p>He smiled down at her, and touched her glowing face. She wore her grandmother\u2019s necklace, in honor of Christmas, and her skin reflected the luster of the freshwater pearls.</p><p>\u201cIf the devil will have me.\u201d</p><p>Before she could answer, they were interrupted by a gust of foggy air as the church door opened.</p><p>\u201cMr. Wakefield, is it yourself?\u201d He turned, to meet two pairs of bright, inquisitive eyes beaming up at him. A pair of elderly women, each about four foot six, stood arm in arm in their winter coats, gray hair puffed out under small felt hats, looking like a matched set of doorstops.</p><p>\u201cMrs. McMurdo, Mrs. Hayes! Happy Christmas to you!\u201d He nodded to them, smiling. Mrs. McMurdo lived two doors down from the manse, and walked to church every Sunday with her friend Mrs. Hayes. Roger had known them all his life.</p><p>\u201cCome over to Rome then, have ye, Mr. Wakefield?\u201d Chrissie McMurdo asked. Jessie Hayes giggled at her friend\u2019s wit, the red cherries bouncing on her hat.</p><p>\u201cMaybe not just yet awhile,\u201d Roger said, still smiling. \u201cI\u2019m only seeing a friend to the services, aye? You\u2019ll know Miss Randall?\u201d He brought Brianna forward and made the introductions, grinning inwardly as the two little old ladies looked her over with a frankly avid curiosity.</p><p>To Mrs. McMurdo and Mrs. Hayes, his presence here was as overt a declaration of his intentions as if he\u2019d taken out a full-page ad in the evening newspaper. Too bad Brianna was unaware of it.</p><p>Or was she? She glanced at him with a half-hidden smile, and he felt the pressure of her fingers on his arm, just for a moment.</p><p>\u201cOch, there\u2019s the wee laddie comin\u2019 wi\u2019 the censer!\u201d cried Mrs. Hayes, spotting another white-robed boy emerging from the sanctuary. \u201cBest get in quick, Chrissie, or we\u2019ll never have a seat!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuch a pleasure to meet ye, my dear,\u201d Mrs. McMurdo told Brianna, head tilted back so far that her hat was in danger of falling off. \u201cMy, such a bonny tall lass!\u201d She glanced at Roger, twinkling. \u201cLucky to have found a lad to match ye, eh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cChrissie!\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust coming, Jessie, just coming. Dinna fash, there\u2019s time.\u201d Straightening her hat, trimmed with a small bunch of grouse\u2019s feathers, Mrs. McMurdo turned in leisurely fashion to join her friend.</p><p>The bell above began to clang again, and Roger took Brianna\u2019s arm. Just in front of them, he saw Jessie Hayes glance back, eyes bright with speculation, her smile half sly with knowing.</p><p>Brianna dipped her fingers in a small stone basin set in the wall by the door, and crossed herself. Roger found the gesture suddenly and oddly familiar, despite its Romanness.</p><p>Years ago, hill-walking with the Reverend, they had come upon a saint\u2019s pool, hidden in a grove. There was a flat stone standing on end beside the tiny spring, the remnants of carving on it worn nearly to smoothness, no more than the shadow of a human figure.</p><p>A sense of mystery hung about the small, dark pool; he and the Reverend had stood there for some time, not speaking. Then the Reverend had bent, scooped up a handful of water, and poured it out at the foot of the stone in silent ceremony, scooped up another and splashed it over his face. Only then had they knelt by the spring to drink the cold, sweet water.</p><p>Above the Reverend\u2019s bowed back, Roger had seen the tattered knots of fabric tied to tree branches above the spring. Pledges; reminders of prayer, left by whoever still visited the ancient shrine.</p><p>For how many thousands of years had men thus blessed themselves with water before seeking their heart\u2019s desire? Roger dabbed his fingers in the water and awkwardly touched both head and heart, with something that might have been a prayer.</p><p>They found seats in the east transept, crowded shoulder to shoulder with a murmuring family, busily engaged in settling belongings and sleepy children, passing coats and handbags and baby bottles to and fro, while a small, wheezy organ played \u201cO Little Town of Bethlehem\u201d somewhere just out of sight.</p><p>Then the music stopped. There was a silence of expectation, and then it burst out once more, in a loud rendition of \u201cO Come, All Ye Faithful.\u201d</p><p>Roger rose with the congregation as the procession came down the center aisle. There were several of the white-robed acolytes, one with a swinging censer that sent puffs of fragrant smoke into the crowd. Another bore a book, and a third a tall crucifix, the gruesome figure on it blatant, daubed with red paint whose bloody echoes shimmered in the priest\u2019s vestment of gold and crimson. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Despite himself, Roger felt a slight sense of shocked distaste; the mixture of barbaric pageantry and the undulations of sung Latin were quite foreign to what he subconsciously felt was proper in church.</p><p>Still, as the Mass went on, things seemed more normal; there were Bible readings, quite familiar, and then the accustomed descent into the vaguely pleasant boredom of a sermon, in which the inevitable Christmas annunciations of \u201cpeace,\u201d \u201cgoodwill,\u201d and \u201clove\u201d rose to the surface of his mind, tranquil as white lilies floating on a pond of words.</p><p>By the time the congregation rose again, Roger had lost all sense of strangeness. Surrounded by a warm, familiar church fug composed of floor polish, damp wool, naphtha fumes, and a faint whiff of the whisky with which some worshipers had fortified themselves for the long service, he scarcely noticed the sweet, musky scent of frankincense. Breathing deeply, he thought he caught the hint of fresh grass from Brianna\u2019s hair.</p><p>It shone in the dim light of the transept, thick and soft against the dark violet of her jumper. Its copper sparks muted by the dimness, it was the deep rufous color of a red deer\u2019s pelt, and it gave him the same sense of helpless yearning he had felt when surprised by a deer on a Highland path\u2014the strong urge to touch it, stroke the wild thing and keep it somehow with him, coupled with the sure knowledge that a finger\u2019s move would send it flying.</p> <p>Whatever one thought of Saint Paul, he thought, the man had known what he was on about with respect to women\u2019s hair. Unseemly lust, was it? He had a sudden memory of the bare hallway and the steam rising from Brianna\u2019s body, the wet snakes of her hair cold on his skin. He looked away, trying to concentrate on the goings-on at the altar, where the priest was raising a large flat disk of bread, while a small boy madly shook a chime of bells.</p><p>He watched her when she went up to take Communion, and became aware with a slight start that he was praying wordlessly.</p><p>He relaxed just a bit when he realized the content of his prayer; it wasn\u2019t the ignoble \u201cLet me have her\u201d he might have expected. It was the more humble\u2014and acceptable, he hoped\u2014\u201cLet me be worthy of her, let me love her rightly; let me take care of her.\u201d He nodded toward the altar, then caught the curious eye of the man next to him, and straightened up, clearing his throat, embarrassed as though he had been surprised in private conversation.</p><p>She came back, eyes wide-open and fixed on something deep inside, a small dreaming smile on her wide sweet mouth. She knelt, and he beside her.</p><p>She had a tender look at the moment, but it was not a gentle face. Straight-nosed and severe, with thick red brows redeemed from heaviness only by the grace of their arch. The cleanness of jaw and cheek might have been cut from white marble; it was the mouth that could change in a moment, from soft generosity to the mouth of a medieval abbess, lips sealed in cool stone celibacy.</p> <p>The thick Glaswegian voice beside him bawling \u201cWe Three Kings\u201d brought him to with a start, in time to see the priest sweep down the aisle, surrounded by his acolytes, in clouds of triumphant smoke.</p><p>\u201c \u2018We Three Kings of Orient Are,\u2019 \u201d Brianna sang quietly as they made their way down River Walk, \u2018Going to smoke a rubber cigar...It was loaded, and explo-oo-ded\u2019\u2014you did turn out the gas, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he assured her. \u201cNot to worry; between the cooker and the bathroom geyser, if the manse hasn\u2019t gone up in flames yet, it must be proof of divine protection.\u201d</p><p>She laughed.</p><p>\u201cDo Presbyterians believe in guardian angels?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCertainly not. Popish superstition, aye?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell, I hope I haven\u2019t damned you to perdition by making you go to Mass with me. Or do Presbyterians believe in hell?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, that we do,\u201d he assured her. \u201cAs much as heaven, if not more.\u201d</p><p>It was even foggier, here by the river. Roger was glad they hadn\u2019t driven; you couldn\u2019t see more than five feet or so in the thick white murk.</p><p>They walked arm in arm beside the River Ness, footsteps muffled. Swaddled by the fog, the unseen city around them might not have existed. They had left the other churchgoers behind; they were alone.</p><p>Roger felt strangely exposed, chilled and vulnerable, stripped of the warmth and assurance he had felt in the church. Only nerves, he thought, and took a firmer grip of Brianna\u2019s arm. It was time. He took a deep breath, cool fog filling his chest.</p><p>\u201cBrianna.\u201d He had her by the arm, turned to face him before she had stopped walking, so her hair swung heavy through the dim arc from the streetlamp overhead.</p><p>Water droplets gleamed in a fine mist on her skin, glowed like pearls and diamonds in her hair, and through the padding of her jacket, he felt in memory her bare skin, cool as fog to his fingers, flesh-hot in his hand.</p><p>Her eyes were wide and dark as a loch, with secrets moving, half seen, half sensed, under rippling water. A kelpie for sure. Each urisge, a water horse, mane flowing, skin glowing. And the man who touches such a creature is lost, bound to it forever, taken down and drowned in the loch that gives it home.</p> <p>He felt suddenly afraid, not for himself but for her; as though something might materialize from that water world to snatch her back, away from him. He grasped her by the hand, as if to prevent her. Her fingers were cold and damp, a shock against the warmth of his palm.</p><p>\u201cI want you, Brianna,\u201d he said softly. \u201cI cannot be saying it plainer than that. I love you. Will you marry me?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t say anything, but her face changed, like water when a stone is thrown into it. He could see it plainly as his own reflection in the bleakness of a tarn.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t want me to say that.\u201d The fog had settled in his chest; he was breathing ice, crystal needles piercing heart and lungs. \u201cYou didn\u2019t want to hear it, did you?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head, wordless.</p><p>\u201cAye. Well.\u201d With an effort, he let go her hand. \u201cThat\u2019s all right,\u201d he said, surprised at the calmness in his voice. \u201cYou\u2019ll not be worried about it, aye?\u201d</p><p>He was turning to walk on when she stopped him, hand on his sleeve.</p><p>\u201cRoger.\u201d</p><p>It was a great effort to turn and face her; he had no wish for empty comfort, no desire to hear a feeble offer to \u201cbe friends.\u201d He didn\u2019t think he could bear even to look at her, so crushing was his sense of loss. But he turned nonetheless and then she was against him, her hands cold on his ears as she gripped his head and pushed her mouth hard onto his, not so much a kiss as blind frenzy, awkward with desperation.</p><p>He gripped her hands and pulled them down, pushing her away.</p><p>\u201cWhat in God\u2019s name are you playing at?\u201d Anger was better than emptiness, and he shouted at her in the empty street.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not playing! You said you wanted me.\u201d She gulped air. \u201cI want you, too, don\u2019t you know that? Didn\u2019t I say so in the hall this afternoon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you did.\u201d He stared at her. \u201cWhat in hell do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mean\u2014I mean I want to go to bed with you,\u201d she blurted.</p><p>\u201cBut you don\u2019t want to marry me?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head, white as a sheet. Something between sickness and fury stirred in his gut, and then erupted.</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019ll not marry me, but you\u2019ll f**k me? How can ye say such a thing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t use that sort of language to me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cLanguage? You can suggest such a thing, but I must not say the word? I have never been so offended, never!\u201d</p><p>She was trembling, strands of hair sticking to her face with the damp.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean to insult you. I thought you wanted to\u2014to\u2014\u201d</p><p>He grabbed her arms and jerked her toward him.</p><p>\u201cIf all I wanted was to f**k you, I would have had ye on your back a dozen times last summer!\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike hell you would!\u201d She wrenched loose one arm and slapped him hard across the jaw, surprising him.</p><p>He grabbed her hand, pulled her toward him and kissed her, a good deal harder and a good deal longer than he ever had before. She was tall and strong and angry\u2014but he was taller, stronger, and much angrier. She kicked and struggled, and he kissed her until he was good and ready to stop.</p><p>\u201cThe hell I would,\u201d he said, gasping for air as he let her go. He wiped his mouth and stood back, shaking. There was blood on his hand; she\u2019d bitten him and he hadn\u2019t felt a thing.</p><p>She was shaking, too. Her face was white, lips pressed so tight together that nothing showed in her face but dark eyes, blazing.</p><p>\u201cBut I didn\u2019t,\u201d he said, breathing slower. \u201cThat wasn\u2019t what I wanted; it\u2019s not what I want now.\u201d He wiped his bloody hand against his shirt. \u201cBut if you don\u2019t care enough to marry me, then I don\u2019t care enough to have ye in my bed!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do care!\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike hell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI care too damn much to marry you, you bastard!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause when I marry you\u2014when I marry anybody\u2014it\u2019s going to last, do you hear me? If I make a vow like that, I\u2019ll keep it, no matter what it costs me!\u201d</p><p>Tears were running down her face. He groped in his pocket for a handkerchief and gave it to her.</p><p>\u201cBlow your nose, wipe your face, and then tell me what the bloody hell ye think you\u2019re talking about, aye?\u201d</p><p>She did as he said, sniffing and brushing back her damp hair with one hand. Her foolish little veil had fallen off; it was hanging by its bobby pin. He plucked it off, crumpling it in his hand.</p><p>\u201cYour Scottish accent comes out when you get upset,\u201d she said, with a feeble attempt at a smile as she handed back the wadded hanky.</p><p>\u201cI shouldn\u2019t wonder,\u201d Roger said in exasperation. \u201cNow tell me what you mean, and do it plainly, before ye drive me all the way to the Gaelic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can speak Gaelic?\u201d She was gradually getting possession of herself.</p><p>\u201cI can,\u201d he said, \u201cand if you don\u2019t want to learn a good many coarse expressions right swiftly...talk. What d\u2019ye mean by making me such an offer\u2014and you a nice Catholic girl, straight out of Mass! I thought ye were a virgin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am! What does that have to do with it?\u201d</p><p>Before he could answer this piece of outrageousness, she followed it up with another.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you tell me you haven\u2019t had girls, I know you have!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, I have! I didn\u2019t want to marry them, and they didn\u2019t want to marry me. I didn\u2019t love them, they didn\u2019t love me. I do love you, damn it!\u201d</p><p>She leaned against the lamppost, hands behind her, and met his eyes directly. \u201cI think I love you, too.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t realize he had been holding his breath until he let it out.</p><p>\u201cAh. You do.\u201d The water had condensed in his hair, and icy trickles were running down his neck. \u201cMmphm.

You\u2019re thinking of bloody Jamie Fraser? Ye think ye cannot be satisfied with a boring historian\u2014ye must have a\u2014a\u2014great passion, as she did for him, and you think I\u2019ll maybe not measure up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo! I\u2019m not thinking of Jamie Fraser! I\u2019m thinking of my father!\u201d She shoved her hands deep in the pockets of her jacket, and swallowed hard. She\u2019d stopped crying, but there were tears on her lashes, clotting them in spikes.</p><p>\u201cShe meant it when she married him\u2014I could see it, in those pictures you gave me. She said \u2018better or worse, richer, poorer\u2019\u2014and she meant it. And then...and then she met Jamie Fraser, and she didn\u2019t mean it anymore.\u201d</p><p>Her mouth worked silently for a moment, looking for words.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2014I don\u2019t blame her, not really, not after I thought about it. She couldn\u2019t help it, and I\u2014when she talked about him, I could see how much she loved him\u2014but don\u2019t you see, Roger? She loved my father, too\u2014but then something happened. She didn\u2019t expect it, and it wasn\u2019t her fault\u2014but it made her break her word. I won\u2019t do that, not for anything.\u201d</p><p>She wiped a hand under her nose, and he gave her back the handkerchief, silently. She blinked back the tears and looked at him, straight.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s more than a year before we can be together. You can\u2019t leave Oxford; I can\u2019t leave Boston, not till I\u2019ve got my degree.\u201d</p><p>He wanted to say that he\u2019d resign, that she should quit her schooling\u2014but kept quiet. She was right; neither of them would be happy with such a solution.</p><p>\u201cSo what if I say yes now, and something happens? What if\u2014if I met somebody else, or you did?\u201d Tears welled again, and one ran down her cheek. \u201cI won\u2019t take the chance of hurting you. I won\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut you love me now?\u201d He touched a finger gently to her cheek. \u201cBree, do ye love me?\u201d</p><p>She took a step forward, and without speaking, reached to undo the fastenings of her coat.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell are you doing?\u201d Blank astonishment was added to the mix of other emotions, succeeded by something else as her long pale fingers grasped the zip of his jacket and pulled it down.</p><p>The sudden whiff of cold was obliterated by the warmth of her body, pressed against his from throat to knees.</p><p>His arms went around her padded back by reflex; she was holding him tight, arms locked round him under his jacket. Her hair smelled cold and sweet, with the last traces of incense trapped in the heavy strands, blending with the fragrance of grass and jasmine flowers. He caught the gleam of a hairpin, bronze metal in the copper loops of her hair.</p><p>She didn\u2019t say a thing, nor did he. He could feel her body through the thin layers of cloth between them, and a jolt of desire shot up the backs of his legs, as though he were standing on an electric grid. He tilted up her chin, and set his mouth on hers.</p> <p>\u201c...see that Jackie Martin, and her with a new fur collar to her coat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOch, and where\u2019s she found the money for such a thing, wi\u2019 her husband oot o\u2019 his work this six month past? I tell ye, Jessie, yon woman...ooh!\u201d</p><p>The click of French-heeled shoes on the pavement halted, to be succeeded by the sound of a throat being cleared with sufficient resonance to wake the dead.</p><p>Roger tightened his grip on Brianna, and didn\u2019t move. She tightened her arms around him in response, and he felt the curve of her mouth under his.</p><p>\u201cMMPHM!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, now, Chrissie,\u201d came a hissed whisper from behind him. \u201cLet them be, aye? Can ye not see they\u2019re getting engaged?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmphm\u201d came again, but in a lower tone. \u201cHmp. They\u2019ll be getting something else, and they go on wi\u2019 that much longer. Still...\u201d A long sigh, tinged with nostalgia. \u201cAh, weel, it\u2019s nice to be young, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>The twin tap of heels came on, much slower, passed them, and faded inaudibly into the fog.</p> <p>He stood for a minute, willing himself to let go of her. But once a man has touched the mane of a water horse, it\u2019s no simple matter to let go. An old kelpie-rhyme ran through his head,</p><p>And sit weel, Janetie</p><p>And ride weel, Davie.</p><p>And your first stop will be</p><p>The bottom of Loch Cavie.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll wait,\u201d he said, and let her go. He held her hands and looked into her eyes, now soft and clear as rain pools.</p><p>\u201cHear me, though,\u201d he said softly. \u201cI will have you all\u2014or not at all.\u201d</p><p>Let me love her rightly, he had said in wordless prayer. And hadn\u2019t he been told often enough by Mrs. Graham\u2014\u201cBe careful what ye ask for, laddie, for ye just might get it?\u201d</p><p>He cupped her breast, soft through her jumper.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not only your body that I want\u2014though God knows, I want it badly. But I\u2019ll have you as my wife...or I will not have you. Your choice.\u201d</p><p>She reached up and touched him, brushed the hair off his brow with fingers so cold, they burned like dry ice.</p><p>\u201cI understand,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>The wind off the river was cold, and he reached to do up the zip of her jacket. In doing so, his hand brushed his own pocket, and he felt the small package lying there. He\u2019d meant to give it to her over supper.</p><p>\u201cHere,\u201d he said, handing it to her. \u201cHappy Christmas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI bought it last summer,\u201d he said, watching her cold fingers fumble at the holly-printed paper. \u201cLooks like prescience, now, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>She held a silver circle, a bracelet, a flat silver band, with words etched round it. He took it from her and slipped it over her hand, onto her wrist. She turned it slowly, reading the words.</p><p>\u201cJe t\u2019aime...un peu...beaucoup...passionn\u00e9ment...pas du tout. I love you...a little...a lot...passionately...not at all.\u201d</p><p>He gave the band a quarter turn more, completing the circle.</p><p>\u201cJe t\u2019aime,\u201d he said, and then with a twist of fingers, sent it spinning on her wrist. She laid a hand on it, stopping it.</p><p>\u201cMoi aussi,\u201d she said softly, looking not at the band but at him. \u201cJoyeux No\u00ebl.\u201d</p><p>PART SEVEN</p><p>On the Mountain</p><p>19</p><p>HEARTH BLESSING</p><p>September 1767</p><p>Sleeping under the moon and stars in the arms of a nak*d lover, the two of you cradled by furs and soft leaves, lulled by the gentle murmur of the chestnut trees and the far-off rumble of a waterfall, is terribly romantic. Sleeping under a crude lean-to, squashed into a soggy mass between a large, wet husband and an equally large, equally wet nephew, listening to rain thrump on the branches overhead while fending off the advances of a immense and thoroughly saturated dog, is slightly less so.</p><p>\u201cAir,\u201d I said, struggling feebly into a sitting position and brushing Rollo\u2019s tail out of my face for the hundredth time. \u201cI can\u2019t breathe.\u201d The smell of confined male animals was overpowering; a sort of musky, rancid smell, garnished with the scent of wet wool and fish.</p><p>I rolled onto my hands and knees and made my way out, trying not to step on anyone. Jamie grunted in his sleep, compensating for the loss of my body heat by curling himself neatly into a plaid-wrapped ball. Ian and Rollo were inextricably entangled in a mass of fur and cloth, their mingled exhalations forming a faint fog around them in the predawn chill.</p><p>It was chilly outside, but the air was fresh; so fresh I nearly coughed when I took a good lungful of it. The rain had stopped, but the trees were still dripping, and the air was composed of equal parts water vapor and pure oxygen, spiced with pungent green scents from every plant on the mountainside.</p><p>I had been sleeping in Jamie\u2019s spare shirt, my buckskins put away in a saddlebag to avoid soaking. I was dappled with gooseflesh and shivering by the time I pulled them on, but the stiff leather warmed enough to shape itself to my body within a few minutes.</p><p>Barefooted and cold-toed, I made my way carefully down to the stream to wash, kettle under my arm. It wasn\u2019t yet dawn, and the forest was filled with mist and gray-blue light; crepuscle, the mysterious half-light that comes at both ends of the day, when the small secret things come out to feed.</p><p>There was an occasional tentative chirp from the canopy overhead, but nothing like the usual raucous chorus. The birds were late in starting today because of the rain; the sky was still lowering, with clouds that ranged from black in the west to a pale slate-blue in the dawning east. I felt a small rush of pleasure at the thought that I knew already the normal hour when the birds should sing, and had noticed the difference.</p><p>Jamie had been right, I thought, when he had suggested that we stay on the mountain, instead of returning to Cross Creek. It was the beginning of September; by Myers\u2019s estimation, we would have two months of good weather\u2014relatively good weather, I amended, looking up at the clouds\u2014before the cold made shelter imperative. Time enough\u2014maybe\u2014to build a small cabin, to hunt for meat, to supply ourselves for the winter ahead.</p><p>\u201cIt will be gey hard work,\u201d Jamie had said. I stood between his knees as he sat perched high on a large rock, looking over the valley below. \u201cAnd some danger to it; we may fail if the snow is early, or if I canna hunt meat enough. I willna do it, if ye say nay, Sassenach. Would ye be afraid?\u201d</p><p>Afraid was putting it mildly. The thought made the bottom of my stomach drop alarmingly. When I had agreed to settle on the ridge, I had thought we would return to Cross Creek to spend the winter.</p><p>We could have gathered both supplies and settlers in a leisurely manner, and returned in the spring in caravan, to clear land and raise houses communally. Instead, we would be completely alone, several days travel from the nearest tiny settlement of Europeans. Alone in a wilderness, alone through the winter.</p><p>We had virtually nothing with us in the way of tools or supplies, save a felling ax, a couple of knives, a camp kettle and girdle, and my smaller medicine box. What if something happened, if Ian or Jamie fell ill or was hurt in an accident? If we starved or froze? And while Jamie was sure that our Indian acquaintances had no objection to our intent, I wasn\u2019t so sanguine about any others who might happen along.</p><p>Yes, I bloody well would be afraid. On the other hand, I\u2019d lived long enough to realize that fear wasn\u2019t usually fatal\u2014at least not by itself. Add in the odd bear or savage, and I wasn\u2019t saying, mind.</p><p>For the first time, I looked back with some longing at River Run, at hot water and warm beds and regular food, at order, cleanliness...and safety.</p><p>I could see well enough why Jamie didn\u2019t want to go back; living on Jocasta\u2019s bounty for several months more would sink him that much further in obligation, make it that much harder to reject her blandishments.</p><p>He also knew\u2014even better than I\u2014that Jocasta Cameron was born a MacKenzie. I had seen enough of her brothers, Dougal and Colum, to have a decent wariness of that heritage; the MacKenzies of Leoch didn\u2019t give up a purpose lightly, and were certainly not above plotting and manipulation to achieve their ends. And a blind spider might weave her webs that much more surely, for depending solely on a sense of touch. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>There were also really excellent reasons for staying the hell away from the vicinity of Sergeant Murchison, who seemed definitely the type to bear a grudge. And then there was Farquard Campbell and the whole waiting web of planters and Regulators, slaves and politics...No, I could see quite well why Jamie mightn\u2019t want to go back to such entanglement and complication, to say nothing of the looming fact of the coming war. At the same time, I was fairly sure that none of those reasons accounted for his decision.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not just that you don\u2019t want to go back to River Run, is it?\u201d I leaned back against him, feeling his warmth as a contrast to the coolness of the evening breeze. The season had not yet turned; it was still late summer, and the air was rich with the sun-roused scents of leaf and berry, but so high in the mountains, the nights turned cold.</p><p>I felt the small rumble of a laugh in his chest, and warm breath brushed my ear.</p><p>\u201cIs it so plain, then?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPlain enough.\u201d I turned in his arms, and rested my forehead against his, so our eyes were inches apart. His were a very deep blue, the same color as the evening sky in the notch of the mountains.</p><p>\u201cOwl,\u201d I said.</p><p>He laughed, startled, and blinked as he pulled back, long auburn lashes sweeping briefly down.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou lose,\u201d I explained. \u201cIt\u2019s a game called \u2018owl.\u2019 First person to blink loses.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh.\u201d He took hold of my ears by the lobes and drew me gently back, forehead to forehead. \u201cOwl, then. Ye do have eyes like an owl, have ye noticed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I said. \u201cCan\u2019t say I have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll clear and gold\u2014and verra wise.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t blink.</p><p>\u201cTell me then\u2014why we\u2019re staying.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t blink either, but I felt his chest rise under my hand, as he took a deep breath.</p> <p>\u201cHow shall I tell ye what it is, to feel the need of a place?\u201d he said softly. \u201cThe need of snow beneath my shoon. The breath of the mountains, breathing their own breath in my nostrils as God gave breath to Adam. The scrape of rock under my hand, climbing, and the sight of the lichens on it, enduring in the sun and the wind.\u201d</p><p>His breath was gone and he breathed again, taking mine. His hands were linked behind my head, holding me, face-to-face.</p><p>\u201cIf I am to live as a man, I must have a mountain,\u201d he said simply. His eyes were open wide, searching mine for understanding.</p><p>\u201cWill ye trust me, Sassenach?\u201d he said. His nose pressed against mine, but his eyes didn\u2019t blink. Neither did mine.</p><p>\u201cWith my life,\u201d I said.</p><p>I felt his lips smile, an inch from mine.</p><p>\u201cAnd with your heart?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlways,\u201d I whispered, closed my eyes, and kissed him.</p> <p>And so it was arranged. Myers would go back to Cross Creek, deliver Jamie\u2019s instructions to Duncan, assure Jocasta of our welfare, and procure as much in the way of stores as the remnants of our money would finance. If there was time before the first snowfall, he would return with supplies; if not, in the spring. Ian would stay; his help would be needed to build the cabin, and to help with the hunting.</p><p>Give us this day our daily bread, I thought, pushing through the wet bushes that edged the creek, and deliver us not into temptation.</p><p>We were reasonably safe from temptation, though; for good or ill, we wouldn\u2019t see River Run again for at least a year. As for the daily bread, that had been coming through as dependably as manna, so far; at this time of year, there was an abundance of ripe nuts, fruits and berries, which I collected as industriously as any squirrel. In two months, though, when the trees grew bare and the streams froze, I hoped God might still hear us, above the howl of the winter wind.</p><p>The stream was noticeably swelled by the rain, the water maybe a foot higher than it had been yesterday. I knelt, groaning slightly as my back unkinked; sleeping on the ground exaggerated all the normal small morning stiffnesses. I splashed cold water on my face, swished it through my mouth, drank from cupped hands, and splashed again, blood tingling through my cheeks and fingers.</p><p>When I looked up, face dripping, I saw two deer drinking from a pool on the other side, a little way upstream from me. I stayed very still, not to disturb them, but they showed no alarm at my presence. In the shadow of the birches, they were the same soft blue as the rocks and trees, little more than shadows themselves, but each line of their bodies etched in perfect delicacy, like a Japanese painting done in ink.</p><p>Then all of a sudden, they were gone. I blinked, and blinked again. I hadn\u2019t seen them turn or run\u2014and in spite of their ethereal beauty, I was sure I hadn\u2019t been imagining them; I could see the dark imprints of their hooves in the mud of the far bank. But they were gone.</p><p>I didn\u2019t see or hear a thing, but the hair rose suddenly on my body, instinct rippling up arms and neck like electric current. I froze, nothing moving but my eyes. Where was it, what was it?</p><p>The sun was up; the tops of the trees were visibly green, and the rocks began to glow as their colors warmed to life. But the birds were silent; nothing moved, save the water.</p><p>It was no more than six feet away from me, half visible behind a bush. The sound of its lapping was lost in the noise of the stream. Then the broad head lifted, and a tufted ear swiveled toward me, though I had made no noise. Could it hear me breathing?</p><p>The sun had reached it, lit it into tawny life, glowed in gold eyes that stared into mine with a preternatural calm. The breeze had shifted; I could smell it now; a faint acrid cat-tang, and the stronger scent of blood. Ignoring me, it lifted a dark-blotched paw and licked fastidiously, eyes slitted in hygienic preoccupation.</p><p>It rubbed the paw several times over its ear, then stretched luxuriously in the patch of new sun\u2014my God, it must be six feet long!\u2014and sauntered off, full belly swaying.</p><p>I hadn\u2019t consciously been afraid; pure instinct had frozen me in place, and sheer amazement\u2014at the cat\u2019s beauty, as well as its nearness\u2014had kept me that way. With its going, though, my central nervous system thawed out at once, and promptly went to pieces. I didn\u2019t gibber, but did shake considerably; it was several minutes before I managed to get off my knees and stand up.</p><p>My hands shook so that I dropped the kettle three times in filling it. Trust him, he\u2019d said, did I trust him? Yes, I did\u2014and a fat lot of good that would do, unless he happened to be standing directly in front of me next time.</p><p>But for this time\u2014I was alive. I stood still, eyes closed, breathing in the pure morning air. I could feel every single atom of my body, blood racing to carry round the sweet fresh stuff to every cell and muscle fiber. The sun touched my face, and warmed the cold skin to a lovely glow.</p><p>I opened my eyes to a dazzle of green and yellow and blue; day had broken. All the birds were singing now.</p><p>I went up the path toward the clearing, resisting the impulse to look behind me.</p><p>Jamie and Ian had felled several tall, slender pines the day before, cut them into twelve-foot lengths, and rolled and wrestled and tumbled the logs downhill. Now they lay stacked at the edge of the small clearing, rough bark glistening black with wet.</p><p>Jamie was pacing out a line, stamping down the wet grass, when I came back with the kettle filled with water. Ian had a fire started on the top of a large flat stone\u2014he having learned from Jamie the canny trick of keeping a handful of dry kindling always in one\u2019s sporran, along with flint and steel.</p><p>\u201cThis will be a wee shed,\u201d Jamie was saying, frowning at the ground in concentration. \u201cWe\u2019ll build this first, for we can sleep in it, if it should rain again, but it needna be so well built as the cabin\u2014it\u2019ll give us something to practice on, eh, Ian?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is it for\u2014beyond practice?\u201d I asked. He looked up and smiled at me.</p><p>\u201cGood morning, Sassenach. Did ye sleep well?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not,\u201d I said. \u201cWhat\u2019s the shed for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMeat,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ll dig a shallow pit at the back, and fill it wi\u2019 embers, to smoke what we can for keeping. And make a rack for drying\u2014Ian\u2019s seen the Indians do it, to make what they call jerky. We must have a safe place where beasts canna get at our food.\u201d</p><p>This seemed a sound idea; particularly in view of the sort of beasts in the area. My only doubts were regarding the smoking. I\u2019d seen it done in Scotland, and knew that smoking meat required a certain amount of attention; someone had to be at hand to keep the fire from burning too high or going out altogether, had to turn the meat regularly, and baste it with fat to avoid scorching and drying.</p><p>I had no difficulty in seeing who was going to be nominated for this task. The only trouble was that if I didn\u2019t manage to do it right, we\u2019d all die of ptomaine poisoning.</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d I said, without enthusiasm. Jamie caught my tone and grinned at me.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the first shed, Sassenach,\u201d he said. \u201cThe second one\u2019s yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMine?\u201d I perked up a bit at that.</p><p>\u201cFor your wee herbs and bits of plants. They do take up a bit of room, as I recall.\u201d He pointed across the clearing, the light of builder\u2019s mania in his eye. \u201cAnd just there\u2014that\u2019s where the cabin will be; where we\u2019ll live through the winter.\u201d</p><p>Rather to my surprise, they had the walls of the first shed erected by the end of the second day, crudely roofed with cut branches until time should permit the cutting of shingles for a proper roof. The walls were made of slender notched logs, still with the bark on, and with noticeable chinks and gaps between them. Still, it was large enough to sleep the three of us and Rollo comfortably, and with a fire burning in a stone-lined pit at one end, it was quite cozy inside.</p><p>Enough branches had been removed from the roof to leave a smoke hole; I could see the evening stars, as I cuddled against Jamie and listened to him criticize his workmanship.</p><p>\u201cLook at that,\u201d he said crossly, lifting his chin at the far corner. \u201cI\u2019ve gone and laid in a crooked pole, and it\u2019s put the whole of that line off the straight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t imagine the deer carcasses will care,\u201d I murmured. \u201cHere, let\u2019s see that hand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the rooftree\u2019s a good six inches lower at the one end than the other,\u201d he went on, ignoring me, but letting me have his left hand. Both hands were smoothly callused, but I could feel the new roughnesses of scrapes and cuts, and so many small splinters that his palm was prickly to the touch.</p><p>\u201cYou feel like a porcupine,\u201d I said, brushing my hand over his fingers. \u201cHere, move closer to the fire, so I can see to pull them out.\u201d</p><p>He moved obligingly, crawling around Ian, who\u2014freshly de-splintered himself\u2014had fallen asleep with his head pillowed on Rollo\u2019s furry side. Unfortunately, the change of position exposed new weaknesses of construction to Jamie\u2019s critical eye.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve never built a shed out of logs before, have you?\u201d I interrupted his denunciation of the doorway, neatly tweaking a large splinter out of his thumb with my tweezers.</p><p>\u201cOw! No, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you built the bloody thing in two days, with nothing but a felling ax and a knife, for God\u2019s sake! There\u2019s not a nail in it! Why ought you to expect it to look like Buckingham Palace?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve never seen Buckingham Palace,\u201d he said, rather mildly. He paused. \u201cI do take your point, though, Sassenach.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d I bent closely over his palm, squinting to make out the small dark streaks of splinters, trapped beneath the skin.</p><p>\u201cI suppose it willna fall down, at least,\u201d he said, after a longer pause.</p><p>\u201cShouldn\u2019t think so.\u201d I dabbed a cloth to the neck of the brandy bottle, swabbed his hand with it, then turned my attention to his right hand.</p> <p>He didn\u2019t speak for a time. The fire crackled softly to itself, flaring up now and then as a draft reached in between the logs to tickle it.</p><p>\u201cThe house is going to be on the high ridge,\u201d he said suddenly. \u201cWhere the strawberries grow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill it?\u201d I murmured. \u201cThe cabin, you mean? I thought that was going to be at the side of the clearing.\u201d I\u2019d taken out as many splinters as I could; those that were left were so deeply embedded that I would have to wait for them to work their way nearer the surface.</p><p>\u201cNo, not the cabin. A fine house,\u201d he said softly. He leaned back against the rough logs, looking across the fire, out through the chinks to the darkness beyond. \u201cWi\u2019 a staircase, and glass windows.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat will be grand.\u201d I laid the tweezers back in their slot, and closed the box.</p> <p>\u201cWi\u2019 high ceilings, and a doorway high enough I shall never bump my heid going in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat will be lovely.\u201d I leaned back beside him, and rested my head on his shoulder. Somewhere in the far distance, a wolf howled. Rollo lifted his head with a soft wuff!, listened for a moment, then lay down again with a sigh.</p><p>\u201cWith a stillroom for you, and a study for me, lined with shelves for my books.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmmm.\u201d At the moment, he possessed one book\u2014The Natural History of North Carolina, published 1733, brought along as guide and reference.</p><p>The fire was burning low again, but neither of us moved to add more wood. The embers would warm us through the night, to be rekindled with the dawn.</p><p>Jamie put an arm around my shoulders, and tilting sideways, took me with him to lie curled together on the thick layer of fallen leaves that was our couch.</p> <p>\u201cAnd a bed,\u201d I said. \u201cYou could build a bed, I expect?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs fine as any in Buckingham Palace,\u201d he said.</p><p>Myers, bless his kindly heart and faithful nature, did return within the month\u2014bringing not only three pack-mules laden with tools, small furnishings, and necessities such as salt, but also Duncan Innes.</p><p>\u201cHere?\u201d Innes looked interestedly over the tiny homestead that had begun to take shape on the strawberry-covered ridge. We had two sturdy sheds now, plus a split-railed penfold in which to keep the horses and any other stock we might acquire.</p><p>At the moment, our total stock consisted of a small white piglet, which Jamie had obtained from a Moravian settlement thirty miles away, exchanging for it a bag of sweet yams I had gathered and a bundle of willow-twig brooms I had made. Rather too small for the penfold, it had so far been living in the shed with us, where it had become fast friends with Rollo. I wasn\u2019t quite so fond of it myself.</p><p>\u201cAye. It\u2019s decent land, with plenty of water; there are springs in the wood, and the creek all through.\u201d</p><p>Jamie guided Duncan to a spot from which the western slopes below the ridge were visible; there were natural breaks, or \u201ccoves\u201d in the forest, now overgrown with tangles of wild grass, but ultimately suitable for cultivation.</p><p>\u201cD\u2019ye see?\u201d He gestured over the slope, which ran down gently from the ridge to a small bluff, where a line of sycamores marked the distant river\u2019s edge. \u201cThere\u2019s room there for at least thirty homesteads, to start. We\u2019d need to clear a deal of forest, but there\u2019s space enough to begin. Any crofter worth his salt could feed his family from a garden plot, the soil\u2019s so rich.\u201d</p> <p>Duncan had been a fisherman, not a farmer, but he nodded obediently, eyes fixed on the vista as Jamie peopled it with future houses.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve paced it out,\u201d Jamie was saying, \u201cthough it will have to be surveyed properly as soon as may be. But I\u2019ve the description of it in my head\u2014did ye by chance bring ink and paper?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, we did. And a few other things, as well.\u201d Duncan smiled at me, his long, rather melancholy face transformed by the expression. \u201cMiss Jo\u2019s sent a feather bed, which she thought might not come amiss.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA feather bed? Really? How wonderful!\u201d I immediately dismissed any ungenerous thoughts I had ever harbored about Jocasta Cameron. While Jamie had built us an excellent, sturdy bedstead framed in oakwood, with the bottom ingeniously made of laced rope, I had had nothing to lay on it save cedar branches, which were fragrant but unpleasantly lumpy.</p><p>My thoughts of luxuriant wallowing were interrupted by the emergence from the woods of Ian and Myers, the latter with a brace of squirrels hung from his belt. Ian proudly presented me with an enormous black object, which on closer inspection proved to be a turkey, fat from gorging on the autumn grains.</p><p>\u201cBoy\u2019s got a nice eye, Mrs. Claire,\u201d said Myers, nodding approvingly. \u201cThose be wily birds, turkeys. Even the Indians don\u2019t take \u2019em easy.\u201d</p><p>It was early for Thanksgiving, but I was delighted with the bird, which would be the first substantial item in our larder. So was Jamie, though his pleasure lay more in the thing\u2019s tail feathers, which would provide him with a good supply of quills.</p><p>\u201cI must write to the Governor,\u201d he explained over dinner, \u201cto say that I shall be taking up his offer, and to give the particulars of the land.\u201d He picked up a chunk of cake and bit into it absently.</p><p>\u201cDo watch out for nutshells,\u201d I said, a little nervously. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to break a tooth.\u201d</p><p>Dinner consisted of trout grilled over the fire, yams baked in it, wild plums, and a very crude cake made of flour from hickory nuts, ground up in my mortar. We had been living mostly on fish and what edible vegetation I could scrounge, Ian and Jamie having been too busy with the building to take time to hunt. I rather hoped that Myers would see fit to stay for a bit\u2014long enough to bag a deer or some other nice large source of protein. A winter of dried fish seemed a little daunting.</p><p>\u201cDinna fash, Sassenach,\u201d Jamie murmured through a mouthful of cake, and smiled at me. \u201cIt\u2019s good.\u201d He turned his attention to Duncan.</p><p>\u201cWhen we\u2019ve done with eating, Duncan, you\u2019ll maybe walk wi\u2019 me to the river, and choose your place?\u201d</p><p>Innes\u2019s face went blank, then flushed with a mixture of pleasure and dismay.</p><p>\u201cMy place? Land, ye mean, Mac Dubh?\u201d Involuntarily, he hunched the shoulder on the side with the missing arm.</p><p>\u201cAye, land.\u201d Jamie speared a hot yam with a sharpened stick, and began to peel it carefully with his fingers, not looking at Innes. \u201cI shall be needing you to act as my agent, Duncan\u2014if ye will. It\u2019s only right ye should be paid. Now, what I am thinking\u2014if ye should find it fair, mind\u2014is that I shall make the claim for a homestead in your name, but as ye willna be here to work it, Ian and I will see to putting a bit of your land to corn, and to building a wee croft there. Then come time, you shall have a place to settle, if ye like, and a bit of corn put by. Will that suit ye, do ye think?\u201d</p><p>Duncan\u2019s face had been going through an array of emotions as Jamie spoke, from dismay to amazement to a cautious sort of excitement. The last thing that would ever have occurred to him was that he might own land. Penniless, and unable to work with his hands, in Scotland he would have lived as a beggar\u2014if he had lived at all.</p><p>\u201cWhy\u2014\u201d he began, then stopped and swallowed, knobbly Adam\u2019s apple bobbing. \u201cAye, Mac Dubh. That will suit fine.\u201d A small, incredulous smile had formed on his face as Jamie spoke, and stayed there, as though Duncan were unaware of it.</p><p>\u201cAgent.\u201d He swallowed again, and reached for one of the bottles of ale he had brought. \u201cWhat will ye have me to do for ye, Mac Dubh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe two things, Duncan, and ye will. First is to find me settlers.\u201d Jamie waved a hand at the beginnings of our new cabin, which so far consisted entirely of a fieldstone foundation, the framing of the floor, and a wide slab of dark slate selected for the hearthstone, presently leaning against the foundation.</p><p>\u201cI canna be leaving here just at present, myself. What I want ye to do is to find as many as ye can of the men who were transported from Ardsmuir. They\u2019ll have been scattered, but they came through Wilmington; a many of them will be in North or South Carolina. Find as many as ye can, tell them what I\u2019m about here\u2014and bring as many as are willing here in the spring.\u201d</p><p>Duncan was nodding slowly, lips pursed beneath his drooping mustache. Few men wore such facial adornment, but it suited him, making him look like a thin but benevolent walrus.</p><p>\u201cVerra well,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd the second?\u201d</p><p>Jamie glanced at me, then at Duncan.</p><p>\u201cMy aunt,\u201d he said. \u201cWill ye undertake to help her, Duncan? She\u2019s great need of an honest man, who can deal wi\u2019 the naval bastards and speak for her in business.\u201d</p><p>Duncan had showed no hesitation in agreeing to comb several hundred miles of colony in search of settlers for our enterprise, but the notion of dealing with naval bastards struck him with profound uneasiness.</p><p>\u201cBusiness? But I dinna ken aught of\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDinna fash,\u201d Jamie said, smiling at his friend, and the adjuration worked on Duncan as well as it did on me; I could see the mounting uneasiness in Duncan\u2019s eyes begin to recede. For roughly the ten-thousandth time, I wondered how he did it.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be little trouble to ye,\u201d Jamie said soothingly. \u201cMy aunt kens well enough what\u2019s to be done; she can tell ye what to say and what to do\u2014it\u2019s only she needs a man for the saying and doing of it. I shall write a letter to her, for ye to take back, explaining that ye\u2019ll be pleased to act for her.\u201d</p><p>During the latter part of this conversation, Ian had been digging about in the packs that had been unloaded from the mules. Now he withdrew a flat piece of metal, and squinted at it curiously.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d he asked, of no one in particular. He held it out for us to see; a flat piece of dark metal, pointed at one end like a knife, with rudimentary crosspieces. It looked like a small dirk that had been run over by a steamroller.</p><p>\u201cIron for your hearth.\u201d Duncan reached for the piece, and handed it, handle-first, to Jamie. \u201cIt was Miss Jo\u2019s thought.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas it? That was kind.\u201d Jamie\u2019s face was weathered to deep bronze by long days in the open, but I saw the faint flush of pink on the side of his neck. His thumb stroked the smooth surface of the iron, and then he handed it to me.</p><p>\u201cKeep it safe, Sassenach,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ll bless our hearth before Duncan leaves.\u201d</p><p>I could see that he was deeply touched by the gift, but didn\u2019t understand entirely why, until Ian had explained to me that one buries iron beneath a new hearth, to ensure blessing and prosperity on the house. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>It was Jocasta\u2019s blessing on our venture; her acceptance of Jamie\u2019s decision\u2014and forgiveness for what must have seemed his abandonment. It was more than generosity, and I folded the small piece of iron carefully into my handkerchief, and put it in my pocket for safekeeping.</p><p>We blessed the hearth two days later, standing in the wall-less cabin. Myers had removed his hat, from respect, and Ian had washed his face. Rollo was present, too, as was the small white pig, who was required to attend as the personification of our \u201cflocks,\u201d despite her objections; the pig saw no point in being removed from her meal of acorns to participate in a ritual so notably lacking in food.</p><p>Ignoring piercing pig-screams of annoyance, Jamie held the small iron knife upright by its tip, so that it formed a cross, and said quietly,</p><p>\u201cGod, bless the world and all that is therein.</p> <p>God, bless my spouse and my children,</p><p>God, bless the eye that is in my head,</p><p>And bless, God, the handling of my hand,</p><p>What time I rise in the morning early,</p><p>What time I lie down late in bed,</p> <p>Bless my rising in the morning early,</p><p>And my lying down late in bed.\u201d</p><p>He reached out and touched first me, then Ian\u2014and with a grin, Rollo and the pig\u2014with the iron, before going on:</p><p>\u201cGod, protect the house, and the household,</p><p>God, consecrate the children of the motherhood,</p><p>God, encompass the flocks and the young,</p> <p>Be Thou after them and tending them,</p><p>What time the flocks ascend hill and wold,</p><p>What time I lie down to sleep.</p><p>What time the flocks ascend hill and wold,</p><p>What time I lie down in peace to sleep.</p><p>\u201cLet the fire of thy blessing burn forever upon us, O God.\u201d</p><p>He knelt then by the hearth and placed the iron into the small hole dug for it, covered it over, and tamped the dirt flat. Then he and I took the ends of the big hearthstone, and laid it carefully into place.</p><p>I should have felt quite ridiculous, standing in a house with no walls, attended by a wolf and a pig, surrounded by wilderness and mocked by mockingbirds, engaged in a ritual more than half pagan. I didn\u2019t.</p> <p>Jamie stood in front of the new hearth, stretched out a hand to me, and drew me to stand by the hearthstone beside him. Looking down at the slate before us, I suddenly thought of the abandoned homestead we had found on our journey north; the fallen timbers of the roof, and the cracked hearthstone, from which a hollybush had sprouted. Had the unknown founders of that place thought to bless their hearth\u2014and failed anyway? Jamie\u2019s hand tightened on mine, in unconscious reassurance.</p><p>On a flat rock outside the cabin, Duncan kindled a small fire, Myers holding the steel for him to strike. Once begun, the fire was coaxed into brightness, and a brand taken from it. Duncan held this in his one hand, and walked sunwise around the cabin\u2019s foundation, chanting in loud Gaelic. Jamie translated for me as he sang:</p><p>\u201cThe safeguard of Fionn mac Cumhall be yours,</p><p>The safeguard of Cormac the shapely be yours,</p><p>The safeguard of Conn and Cumhall be yours,</p><p>From wolf and from bird-flock</p><p>From wolf and from bird-flock.\u201d</p><p>He paused in his chanting as he came to each point of the compass, and bowing to the \u201cfour airts,\u201d swept his brand in a blazing arc before him. Rollo, plainly disapproving of these pyromaniac goings-on, growled deep in his throat, but was firmly shushed by Ian.</p><p>\u201cThe shield of the King of Fiann be yours,</p><p>The shield of the king of the sun be yours,</p><p>The shield of the king of the stars be yours,</p><p>In jeopardy and distress</p><p>In jeopardy and distress.\u201d</p><p>There were a good many verses; Duncan circled the house three times. It was only as he reached the final point, next to the freshly laid hearthstone, that I realized Jamie had laid out the cabin so that the hearth lay to the north; the morning sun fell warm on my left shoulder and threw our mingled shadows to the west.</p><p>\u201cThe sheltering of the king of kings be yours,</p><p>The sheltering of Jesus Christ be yours,</p><p>The sheltering of the spirit of Healing be yours,</p><p>From evil deed and quarrel,</p><p>From evil dog and red dog.\u201d</p><p>With a look down his nose at Rollo, Duncan stopped by the hearth, and gave the brand to Jamie, who stooped in turn and set alight the waiting pile of kindling. Ian gave a Gaelic whoop as the flame blazed up, and there was general applause.</p><p>Later, we saw Duncan and Myers off. They were bound not for Cross Creek but, rather, for Mount Helicon, where the Scots of the region held a yearly Gathering in the autumn, to give thanks for successful harvests, to exchange news and transact business, to celebrate marriages and christenings, to keep the far-flung elements of clan and family in touch.</p><p>Jocasta and her household would be there; so would Farquard Campbell and Andrew MacNeill. It was the best place for Duncan to begin his task of finding the scattered men of Ardsmuir; Mount Helicon was the largest of the Gatherings; Scots would come there from as far away as South Carolina and Virginia.</p><p>\u201cI shall be here come spring, Mac Dubh,\u201d Duncan promised Jamie as he mounted. \u201cWith as many men as I can fetch to ye. And I shall hand on your letters without fail.\u201d He patted the pouch by his saddle, and tugged his hat down to shade his eyes from the rich September sun. \u201cWill ye have a word for your aunt?\u201d</p><p>Jamie paused for a moment, thinking. He had written to Jocasta already; was there anything to add?</p><p>\u201cTell my aunt I shall not see her at the Gathering this year, or perhaps at the next. But the one after that, I shall be there without fail\u2014and my people with me. Godspeed, Duncan!\u201d</p><p>He slapped Duncan\u2019s horse on the rump, and stood by me waving as the two horses dropped over the edge of the ridge and out of sight. The parting gave me an odd feeling of desolation; Duncan was our last and only link with civilization. Now we were truly alone.</p><p>Well, not quite alone, I amended. We had Ian. To say nothing of Rollo, the pig, three horses, and two mules that Duncan had left us, to manage the spring plowing. Quite a little establishment, in fact. My spirits rose in contemplation; within the month, the cabin would be finished, and we would have a solid roof over our heads. And then\u2014</p><p>\u201cBad news, Auntie,\u201d said Ian\u2019s voice in my ear. \u201cThe pig\u2019s eaten the rest of your nutmeal.\u201d</p><p>20</p><p>THE WHITE RAVEN</p><p>October 1767</p><p>Body, soul, and mind,\u2019 \u201d Jamie said, translating as he bent to seize the end of another trimmed log. \u201c \u2018The body for sensation, the soul for the springs of action, the mind for principles. Yet the capacity for sensation belongs also to the stalled ox; there is no wild beast or degenerate but obeys the twitchings of impulse; and even men who deny the gods, or betray their country, or\u2019\u2014careful, man!\u201d</p><p>Ian, thus warned, stepped neatly backward over the ax handle, and turned to the left, steering his end of the burden carefully round the corner of the half-built log wall.</p><p>\u201c \u2018\u2014or perpetrate all manner of villainy behind locked doors, have minds to guide them to the clear path of duty,\u2019 \u201d Jamie resumed Marcus Aurelius\u2019s Meditations. \u201c \u2018Seeing then\u2019\u2014step up. Aye, good, that\u2019s got it\u2014\u2018seeing then that all else is in common heritage of such types, the good man\u2019s only singularity lies in his approving welcome to every experience the looms of fate may weave for him, his refusal to soil the divinity seated in his breast or perturb it with disorderly impressions...\u2019 All right now, one, and two, and...ergh!\u201d</p><p>His face went scarlet with effort as they reached the proper position and, in concert, hoisted the squared log to shoulder height. Too occupied to go on with the meditations of Marcus Aurelius, Jamie directed his nephew\u2019s movements with jerks of the head and breathless one-word commands, as they maneuvered the unwieldy chunk of wood into the notches of the cross-pieces below it.</p><p>\u201cOch, the twitchings of impulse, is it?\u201d Ian shouldered a lock of hair out of his sweating face. \u201cI feel a wee twitch in the direction of my wame. Is that degenerate, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI believe that would be an acceptable bodily sensation at this time o\u2019 day,\u201d Jamie allowed, grunting slightly as they maneuvered the log the last inch into place. \u201cA bit to the left, Ian.\u201d</p><p>The log dropped into its notches, and both men stepped back with a shared sigh of relieved accomplishment. Ian grinned at his uncle.</p><p>\u201cMeanin\u2019 ye\u2019re hungry yourself, aye?\u201d</p><p>Jamie grinned back, but before he could reply, Rollo lifted his head, ears perking, and a low growl rumbled in his chest. Seeing this, Ian turned his head to look, and stopped in the act of mopping his face with his shirttail.</p><p>\u201cHere\u2019s company, Uncle,\u201d he said, nodding toward the forest. Jamie stiffened. Before he could turn or reach for a weapon, though, I had made out what Rollo and Ian had seen among the shifting leaf-light.</p><p>\u201cNot to worry,\u201d I said, amused. \u201cIt\u2019s your erstwhile drinking companion\u2014dressed for visiting. A little something the looms of fate have woven for your approving welcome, I expect.\u201d</p><p>Nacognaweto waited politely in the shade of the chestnut grove until he was sure we had seen him. Then he advanced slowly out of the forest, followed this time not by his sons but by three women, two of them carrying large bundles on their backs.</p><p>One was a young girl, no more than thirteen or so, and the second, in her thirties, plainly the girl\u2019s mother. The third woman who accompanied them was much older\u2014not the grandmother, I thought, seeing her bent form and white hair\u2014perhaps the great-grandmother.</p><p>They had indeed come dressed for visiting; Nacognaweto was bare-legged, with leather buskins on his feet, but he wore muslin breeches, loose at the knee, and a shirt of dyed pink linen over them, belted splendidly with a girdle studded with porcupine quills and bits of white and lavender shell. Over it all he had a leather vest with beaded trim, and a sort of loose turban in blue calico over his unbound hair, with two crow\u2019s feathers dangling down beside one ear. Jewelry of shell and silver\u2014an earring, several necklaces, a belt buckle and small ornaments tied to his hair\u2014completed the picture.</p><p>The women were somewhat less gorgeously arrayed, but still plainly in their Sunday best, in long loose dresses that reached their knees, soft boots and leather leggings showing beneath. They were girdled with deer-leather aprons decorated with painted patterns, and the two younger women wore ornamental vests as well. They advanced in single file, halfway across the clearing, then stopped.</p><p>\u201cMy God,\u201d Jamie murmured, \u201cit\u2019s an ambassage.\u201d He wiped a sleeve across his face, and nudged Ian in the ribs. \u201cMake my curtsies, Ian; I\u2019ll be back.\u201d</p><p>Ian, looking a trifle bewildered, advanced to meet the Indians, waving a large hand in a ceremonial gesture of welcome. Jamie grabbed me by the arm and hustled me round the corner, into the half-built house.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2014\u201d I began, bewildered.</p><p>\u201cGet dressed,\u201d he interrupted, shoving the clothes box in my direction. \u201cPut on your gaudiest things, aye? It wouldna be respectful, else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGaudy\u201d was going a bit far in the description of any item of my current wardrobe, but I did my best, hastily tying a yellow linen skirt around my waist and replacing my plain white kerchief with one Jocasta had sent me, embroidered with cherries. I thought that would do\u2014after all, it was obviously the males of the species who were on display here. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Jamie, having flung off his breeks and belted his crimson plaid in record time, fastened it with a small bronze brooch, snatched a bottle out from under the bedframe, and was out through the open side of the house before I had finished tidying my hair. Giving up that attempt as a lost cause, I hurried out after him.</p><p>The women watched me with the same fascination I had for them, but they hung back as Jamie and Nacognaweto conducted the necessary greetings involving the ceremonial pouring and sharing of the brandy, Ian being included in this ritual. Only then did the second woman come forward at Nacognaweto\u2019s gesture, ducking her head in shy acknowledgment.</p><p>\u201cBonjour, messieurs, madame,\u201d she said softly, looking from one to another of us. Her eyes rested on me with frank curiosity, taking in every detail of my appearance, so I felt no compunction in staring at her, likewise. Mixed blood, I thought, perhaps French?</p><p>\u201cJe suis sa femme,\u201d she said, with a graceful inclination of her head toward Nacognaweto, the words verifying my guess as to her heritage. \u201cJe m\u2019appelle Gabrielle.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cUm...je m\u2019appelle Claire,\u201d I said, with a slightly less graceful gesture at myself. \u201cS\u2019il vous pla\u00eet...\u201d I waved at the pile of waiting logs, inviting them to sit down, while mentally wondering whether there was enough of the squirrel stew to go round.</p><p>Jamie, meanwhile, was eyeing Nacognaweto with a mixture of amusement and irritation.</p><p>\u201cOh, \u2018no Franch,\u2019 is it?\u201d he said. \u201cNot a word, I dinna suppose!\u201d The Indian gave him a look of profound blandness, and nodded to his wife to continue with the introductions.</p><p>The elder lady was Nayawenne, not Gabrielle\u2019s grandmother as I had thought but, rather Nacognaweto\u2019s. This lady was light-boned, thin, and bent with rheumatism, but bright-eyed as the sparrow she so strongly resembled. She wore a small leather bag tied round her neck, ornamented with a rough green stone pierced through for stringing, and the spotted tail feathers of a woodpecker. She had a larger bag, this one of cloth, tied at her waist. She saw me looking at the green stains on the rough cloth, and smiled, showing two prominent yellow front teeth.</p><p>The girl was, as I had surmised, Gabrielle\u2019s daughter\u2014but not, I thought, Nacognaweto\u2019s; she had no resemblance to him, and behaved shyly toward him. Her rather incongruous name was Berthe, and the effects of mixed blood were even more apparent in her than in her mother; her hair was dark and silky, but a deep brown rather than ebony, and her round face was ruddy, with the fresh complexion of a European, though her eyes had the Indian\u2019s epicanthic fold.</p> <p>Once the official introductions were over, Nacognaweto motioned to Berthe, who obediently brought out the large bundle she had carried, and opened it at my feet, displaying a large basket of orange and green-striped squash, a string of dried fish, a smaller basket of yams, and a huge pile of Indian corn, shucked and dried on the cob.</p><p>\u201cMy God,\u201d I murmured. \u201cThe return of Squanto!\u201d</p><p>Everyone gave me a blank look, and I hastened to smile and make exclamations\u2014thoroughly heartfelt\u2014of joy and pleasure over the gifts. It might not get us through the whole winter, but it was enough to augment our diet for a good two months.</p><p>Nacognaweto explained through Gabrielle that this was a small and insignificant return for Jamie\u2019s gift of the bear, which had been received with delight by his village, where Jamie\u2019s courageous exploit (here the women cut their eyes at me and tittered, having evidently heard all about the episode of the fish) had been the subject of great talk and admiration.</p><p>Jamie, thoroughly accustomed to this sort of diplomatic exchange, modestly disclaimed any pretention to prowess, dismissing the encounter as the merest accident.</p><p>While Gabrielle was employed in translation, the old lady ignored the mutual compliments, and sidled crabwise over to me. Without the least sense of offense, she patted me familiarly all over, fingering my clothes and lifting the hem of my dress to examine my shoes, keeping up a running commentary to herself in a soft, hoarse murmur.</p> <p>The murmur grew louder and took on a tone of astonishment when she got to my hair. I obligingly took out the pins and shook it down over my shoulders. She pulled out a curl, drew it taut, then let it spring back, and laughed like a drain.</p><p>The men glanced in our direction, but by this time Jamie had moved on to showing Nacognaweto the construction of the house. The chimney was complete, built of fieldstone like the foundation, and the floor had been laid, but the walls, built of solid squared logs each some eight inches in diameter, rose only shoulder-high. Jamie was urging Ian to a demonstration of the debarking of logs, in which he chopped his way steadily backward as he walked along the top of the log, narrowly missing his toes with each stroke.</p><p>This form of male conversation requiring no translation, Gabrielle was left free to come and chat with me; though her French was peculiarly accented and full of strange idioms, we had no trouble understanding each other.</p><p>In fairly short order, I discovered that Gabrielle was the daughter of a French fur trader and a Huron woman, and the second wife of Nacognaweto, who in turn was her second husband\u2014the first, Berthe\u2019s father, had been a Frenchman, killed in the French and Indian War ten years before.</p><p>They lived in a village called Anna Ooka (I bit the inside of my cheek to keep a straight face; no doubt \u201cNew Bern\u201d would have sounded peculiar to them), some two days travel to the northwest\u2014Gabrielle indicated the direction with a graceful inclination of her head.</p><p>While I talked with Gabrielle and Berthe, augmenting the conversation by means of hand-waving, I slowly became conscious that another sort of communication was taking place, with the old lady.</p><p>She said nothing to me directly\u2014though she murmured now and then to Berthe, plainly demanding to know what I had said\u2014but her bright dark eyes stayed fixed on me, and I was peculiarly aware of her regard. I had the odd feeling that she was talking to me\u2014and I to her\u2014without the exchange of a single spoken word.</p><p>I saw Jamie, across the clearing, offering Nacognaweto the rest of the bottle of brandy; clearly it was time to offer gifts in return. I gave Gabrielle the embroidered kerchief, and Berthe, a hairpin ornamented with paste brilliants, over which gifts they exclaimed in pleasure. For Nayawenne, though, I had something different.</p> <p>I had been fortunate enough to find four large ginseng roots the week before. I fetched all four from my medicine chest and pressed them into her hands, smiling. She looked back at me, then grinned, and untying the cloth bag from her belt, thrust it at me. I didn\u2019t have to open it; I could feel the four long, lumpy shapes through the cloth.</p><p>I laughed in return; yes, we definitely spoke the same language!</p><p>Moved by curiosity, and by an impulse that I couldn\u2019t describe, I asked Gabrielle about the old lady\u2019s amulet, hoping that this wasn\u2019t an insufferable breach of good manners.</p><p>\u201cGrandm\u00e8re est...\u201d She hesitated, looking for the right French word, but I already knew.</p><p>\u201cPas docteur,\u201d I said, \u201cet pas sorci\u00e8re, magicienne. Elle est...\u201d I hesitated too; there really wasn\u2019t a suitable word for it in French, after all.</p><p>\u201cWe say she is a singer,\u201d Berthe put in shyly, in French. \u201cWe call it shaman; her name, it means \u2018It may be; it will happen.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>The old lady said something, nodding at me, and the two younger women looked startled. Nayawenne bent her head, slipped the thong off her neck, and placed the little bag in my hand.</p><p>It was so heavy that my wrist sagged, and I nearly dropped it. Astonished, I closed my hand over it. The worn leather was warm from her body, the rounded contours fitting smoothly into my palm. For just a moment, I had the remarkable impression that something in the bag was alive.</p><p>My face must have shown my startlement, for the old lady doubled up laughing. She held out her hand and I gave her back the amulet, with a fair amount of haste. Gabrielle conveyed politely that her husband\u2019s grandmother would be pleased to show me the useful plants that grew nearby, if I would like to walk with her?</p><p>I accepted this invitation with alacrity, and the old lady set off up the path with a sure-footed spryness that belied her years. I watched her feet, tiny in soft leather boots, and hoped that when I was her age, I might be capable of walking for two days through the woods, and then wanting to go exploring.</p><p>We wandered along the stream for some way, followed at a respectful distance by Gabrielle and Berthe, who came up beside us only if summoned to interpret.</p><p>\u201cEach of the plants holds the cure to a sickness,\u201d the old lady explained through Gabrielle. She plucked a twig from a bush by the path and handed it to me with a wry look. \u201cIf we only knew what they all were!\u201d</p><p>For the most part, we managed fairly well by means of gesture, but when we reached the big pool where Jamie and Ian fished trout, Nayawenne stopped and waved, bringing Gabrielle to us again. She said something to the woman, who turned to me, a faint look of surprise on her face.</p><p>\u201cMy husband\u2019s grandmother says that she had a dream about you, on the night of the full moon, two moons ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout me?\u201d</p><p>Gabrielle nodded. Nayawenne put a hand on my arm and looked up intently into my face, as though to see the impact of Gabrielle\u2019s words.</p><p>\u201cShe told us about the dream; that she had seen a woman with\u2014\u201d Her lips twitched, then hastily straightened themselves, and she delicately touched the ends of her own long, straight hair. \u201cThree days later, my husband and his sons returned, to tell of meeting you and the Bear Killer in the forest.\u201d</p><p>Berthe was watching me with frank interest, too, twining a lock of her own dark-brown hair around the end of an index finger.</p><p>\u201cShe who heals said at once that she must see you, and so when we heard that you were here...\u201d</p><p>That gave me a small start; I had had no sensation of being watched, and yet plainly someone had taken note of our presence on the mountain, and conveyed the news to Nacognaweto.</p><p>Impatient with these irrelevancies, Nayawenne poked her granddaughter-in-law and said something, then pointed firmly at the water by our feet.</p><p>\u201cMy husband\u2019s grandmother says that when she dreamed of you, it was here.\u201d Gabrielle gestured over the pool, and looked back at me with great seriousness.</p><p>\u201cShe met you here, at night. The moon was in the water. You became a white raven; you flew over the water and swallowed the moon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d I hoped this wasn\u2019t a sinister thing for me to have done.</p><p>\u201cThe white raven flew back, and laid an egg in the palm of her hand. The egg split open, and there was a shining stone inside. My husband\u2019s grandmother knew this was great magic, that the stone could heal sickness.\u201d</p><p>Nayawenne nodded her head several times, and taking the amulet bag from her neck, reached into it.</p><p>\u201cOn the day after the dream, my husband\u2019s grandmother went to dig kinnea root, and on the way, she saw something blue, sticking in the clay of the riverbank.\u201d</p><p>Nayawenne drew out a small, lumpy object, and dropped it into my hand. It was a pebble; rough, but undeniably a gemstone. Bits of stony matrix clung to it, but the heart of the rock was a deep, soft blue. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMy goodness\u2014it\u2019s a sapphire, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSapphire?\u201d Gabrielle turned the word over in her mouth, tasting it. \u201cWe call it...\u201d She hesitated, looking for the proper French translation. \u201c...pierre sans peur.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPierre sans peur?\u201d A fearless stone?</p><p>Nayawenne nodded, talking again. Berthe butted in with the translation, before her mother could speak.</p> <p>\u201cMy father\u2019s grandmother says a stone like this, it keeps people from being afraid, and so it makes their spirit strong, so they will be healed more easily. Already, this stone has healed two people of fever, and cured a soreness of the eyes that my younger brother had.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy husband\u2019s grandmother wishes to thank you for this gift.\u201d Gabrielle neatly took back the conversation.</p><p>\u201cAh...do tell her she\u2019s quite welcome.\u201d I nodded cordially at the old lady, and gave her back the blue stone. She popped it into the bag and drew the string tight about its neck. Then she peered closely at me, and reaching out, drew down a curl of my hair, talking as she rubbed the lock between her fingers.</p><p>\u201cMy husband\u2019s grandmother says that you have medicine now, but you will have more. When your hair is white like hers, that is when you will find your full power.\u201d</p><p>The old lady dropped the lock of hair, and looked into my eyes for a moment. I thought I saw an expression of great sadness in the faded depths, and reached involuntarily to touch her.</p> <p>She stepped back and said something else. Gabrielle looked at me queerly.</p><p>\u201cShe says you must not be troubled; sickness is sent from the gods. It won\u2019t be your fault.\u201d</p><p>I looked at Nayawenne, startled, but she had already turned away.</p><p>\u201cWhat won\u2019t be my fault?\u201d I asked, but the old lady refused to say more.</p><p>21</p><p>NIGHT ON A SNOWY MOUNTAIN</p> <p>December 1767</p><p>The winter held off for some time, but snow began to fall in the night on November 28, and we woke to find the world transformed. Every needle on the great blue spruce behind the cabin was frosted, and ragged fringes of ice dripped from the tangle of wild raspberry canes.</p><p>The snow wasn\u2019t deep, but its coming changed the shape of daily life. I no longer foraged during the day, save for short trips to the stream for water, and for lingering bits of green cress salvaged from the icy slush along the banks. Jamie and Ian ceased their work of log felling and field clearing, and turned to roof shingling. The winter drew in on us, and we in turn withdrew from the cold, turning inward.</p><p>We had no candles; only grease lamps and rushlights, and the light of the fire that burned constantly on the hearth, blackening the roof beams. We therefore rose at first light, and lay down after supper, in the same rhythm as the creatures of the forest around us.</p><p>We had no sheep yet, and thus no wool to card or spin, no cloth to weave or dye. We had no beehives yet, and thus no wax to boil, no candles to dip. There was no stock to care for, save the horses and mules and the piglet, who had grown considerably in both size and irascibility, and in consequence been exiled to a private compartment in the corner of the crude stable Jamie had built\u2014this itself no more than a large open-fronted shelter with a branch-covered roof.</p><p>Myers had brought a small but useful selection of tools, the iron parts clanking in a bag, to be supplied with wooden handles from the forest close at hand: a barking ax and another felling ax, a plowshare for the spring planting, augers, planes and chisels, a small grass scythe, two hammers and a handsaw, a peculiar thing called a \u201ctwibil\u201d that Jamie said was for cutting mortises, a \u201cdrawknife\u201d\u2014a curved blade with handles at either end, used to smooth and taper wood\u2014two small sharp knives, a hatchet-adze, something that looked like a medieval torture device but was really a nail-header, and a froe for splitting shingles.</p><p>Between them, Jamie and Ian had succeeded in getting a roof on the cabin before snow fell, but the sheds were less important. A block of wood sat constantly by the fire, the froe stuck through it, ready for anyone with an idle moment to strike off a few more shingles. That corner of the hearth was in fact devoted to wood carving; Ian had made a rough but serviceable stool, which sat under one of the windows for good light, and the shavings could all be tossed thriftily into the fire, which burned day and night.</p><p>Myers had brought a few woman\u2019s tools for me, as well: a huge sewing basket, well supplied with needles, pins, scissors, and balls of thread, and lengths of linen, muslin, and woven wool. While sewing was not my favorite occupation, I was nonetheless delighted to see these, since owing to Jamie and Ian\u2019s constantly lurching through thickets and crawling about on the roofs, the knees, elbows, and shoulders of all their garments were in constant disrepair.</p> <p>\u201cAnother one!\u201d Jamie sat bolt upright in bed beside me.</p><p>\u201cAnother what?\u201d I asked sleepily, opening one eye. It was very dark in the cabin, the fire burnt to coals on the hearth.</p><p>\u201cAnother bloody leak! It hit me in the ear, damn it!\u201d He sprang out of bed, went to the fire and thrust in a stick of wood. Once it was alight, he brought it back and stood on the bedstead, thrusting his torch upward as he glowered at the roof in search of the fiendish leak.</p><p>\u201cUrmg?\u201d Ian, who slept on a low trundle bed, rolled over and groaned inquiringly. Rollo, who insisted on sharing it with him, emitted a brief \u201cuff,\u201d relapsed into a heap of gray fur, and resumed his loud snoring.</p><p>\u201cA leak,\u201d I told Ian, keeping a narrow eye on Jamie\u2019s torch. I wasn\u2019t having my precious feather bed set alight by stray sparks.</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Ian lay with an arm across his face. \u201cHas it snowed again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt must have.\u201d The windows were covered with squares of oiled deerhide, tacked down, and there was no sound from outside, but the air had the peculiar muffled quality that came with snow.</p><p>Snow came silently, and mounded on the roof, then, beginning to melt from the warmth of the shingles underneath, would drip down the slope of the roof, to leave a gleaming portcullis of icicles along the eaves. Now and then, though, the roaming water found a split in a shingle, or a join where the overlapping edges had warped, and drips poked their icy fingers through the roof.</p><p>Jamie regarded all such intrusions as a personal affront, and brooked no delay in dealing with them.</p><p>\u201cLook!\u201d he exclaimed. \u201cThere it is. See it?\u201d</p><p>I shifted my glassy gaze from the hairy ankles in front of my nose, to the roof overhead. Sure enough, the torchlight revealed the black line of a split in one shingle, with a spreading dark patch of dampness on the underside. As I watched, a clear drop formed, glistening red in the torchlight, and fell with a plop onto the pillow beside me.</p><p>\u201cWe could shift the bed a bit,\u201d I suggested, though with no particular hope. I had been through this before. All suggestions that repair work could wait till daylight were met with astonished refusal; no proper man, I was given to understand, would countenance such a thing.</p><p>Jamie stepped down off the bedstead and prodded Ian in the ribs with his foot.</p><p>\u201cGet up and knock at the spot where the split is, Ian. I\u2019ll deal with it on the outside.\u201d Seizing a fresh shingle, a hammer, a hatchet, and a bag of nails, he headed for the door.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you go up on the roof in that!\u201d I exclaimed, sitting up abruptly. \u201cThat\u2019s your good woolen shirt!\u201d</p><p>He halted by the door, glared briefly at me, then, with the rebuking expression of an early Christian martyr, laid down his tools, stripped off the shirt, dropped it on the floor, picked up the tools, and strode majestically out to deal with the leak, buttocks clenched with determined zeal.</p><p>I rubbed a hand over my sleep-puffed face and moaned softly to myself.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll be all right, Auntie,\u201d Ian assured me. He yawned widely, not bothering to cover his mouth, and reluctantly rolled out of his own warm bed.</p><p>Thumps on the roof that were definitely not the feet of eight tiny reindeer announced that Jamie was in place. I rolled out of the way and got up, resigned, as Ian mounted the bedstead and jabbed a stick of firewood upward into the damp patch, jarring the shingles enough for Jamie to locate the leak on the outside.</p><p>A short period of rending and banging followed, as the defective shingle was yanked loose and replaced, and the leak was summarily extinguished, leaving no more evidence of its existence than the small heap of snow that had fallen in through the hole left by the removed shingle.</p><p>Back in bed, Jamie curled his freezing body around me, clasped me to his icy bosom, and fell promptly asleep, full of the righteous satisfaction of a man who has defended hearth and home against all threat.</p><p>It was a fragile and tenuous foothold that we had upon the mountain\u2014but a foothold, for all that. We had not much meat\u2014there had been little time for hunting, beyond squirrel and rabbit, and those useful rodents had gone to their winter rest by now\u2014but a fair amount of dried vegetables, from yams to squash to wild onions and garlic, plus a bushel or two of nuts, and the small stock of herbs I had managed to gather and dry. It made for a sparse diet, but with careful management, we could survive till spring.</p><p>With few chores to do outside, there was time to talk, to tell stories, and to dream. Between the useful objects like spoons and bowls, Jamie took time to carve the pieces of a wooden chess set, and spent a good deal of his time trying to inveigle me or Ian into playing with him.</p><p>Ian and Rollo, who both suffered badly from cabin fever, took to visiting Anna Ooka frequently, sometimes going on extended hunting trips with young men from the village, who were pleased to have the benefit of his and Rollo\u2019s company.</p><p>\u201cThe lad speaks the Indian tongue a great deal better than he does Greek or Latin,\u201d Jamie observed with some dourness, watching Ian exchanging cordial insults with an Indian companion as they left on one such excursion.</p><p>\u201cWell, if Marcus Aurelius had written about tracking porcupines, I expect he\u2019d have found a more eager audience,\u201d I replied soothingly.</p><p>Dearly as I loved Ian, I was myself not displeased by his frequent absence. There were definitely times when three was a crowd.</p><p>There is nothing more delightful in life than a feather bed and an open fire\u2014except a feather bed with a warm and tender lover in it. When Ian was gone, we would not trouble with rushlights but would go to bed with the dark, and lie curled together in shared warmth, talking late into the night, laughing and telling stories, sharing our pasts, planning our future, and somewhere in the midst of the talking, pausing to enjoy the wordless pleasures of the present.</p><p>\u201cTell me about Brianna.\u201d These were Jamie\u2019s favorite stories; the tales of Brianna as a child. What she had said and worn and done; how she had looked, all her accomplishments and her tastes.</p><p>\u201cDid I tell you about the time I was invited to her school, to talk about being a doctor?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He shifted to make himself more comfortable, rolling onto his side and fitting himself to my shape behind. \u201cWhy should you do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was what they called Career Day; the schoolteachers invited a lot of people with different jobs to come and explain what they did, so the children would have some idea of what a lawyer does, for instance, or a firefighter\u2014\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI should think that one would be fairly obvious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHush.

What can ye do to a tooth, besides pull it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d be surprised.\u201d I brushed the hair out of my face and up off my neck. \u201cAnyway, they\u2019d always ask me to come, because it wasn\u2019t at all common for a woman to be a doctor then.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYe think it\u2019s common now?\u201d He laughed, and I kicked him lightly in the shin.</p><p>\u201cWell, it got more common rather soon after that. But at the time, it wasn\u2019t. And when I\u2019d got done speaking and asked if there were any questions, an obnoxious little boy piped up and said that his mother said women who worked were no better than prostitutes, and they ought to be home minding their families, instead of taking jobs away from men.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI shouldna think his mother can have met many prostitutes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t imagine. Nor all that many women with jobs, either. But when he said that, Brianna stood up and said in a very loud voice, \u2018Well, you\u2019d better be glad my mama\u2019s a doctor, because you\u2019re going to need one!\u2019 Then she hit him on the head with her arithmetic book, and when he lost his balance and fell down, she jumped on his stomach and punched him in the mouth.\u201d</p><p>I could feel his chest and stomach quivering against my back.</p> <p>\u201cOh, braw lassie! Did the schoolmaster not tawse her for it, though?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey don\u2019t beat children in school. She had to write a letter of apology to the little beast, but then, he had to write one to mem, and she thought that was a fair exchange. The more embarrassing part was that it turned out his father was a doctor too; one of my colleagues at the hospital.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldna suppose you\u2019d taken a job he\u2019d wanted?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did you guess?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm.\u201d His breath was warm and ticklish on the back of my neck. I reached back and stroked the length of a long, hairy thigh, enjoying the hollow and swell of the muscle.</p><p>\u201cYe said she was at a university, and studying history, like Frank Randall. Did she never want to be a doctor, like you?\u201d A large hand cupped my bottom and began to knead it gently.</p> <p>\u201cOh, she did when she was little\u2014I used to take her to the hospital now and then, and she was fascinated by all the equipment; she loved to play with my stethoscope and the otoscope\u2014a thing you look in ears with\u2014but then she changed her mind. She changed it a dozen times, at least; most children do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey do?\u201d This was a novel thought to him. Most children of the time would simply adopt the professions of their parents\u2014or perhaps be apprenticed to learn one chosen for them.</p><p>\u201cOh, yes. Let me see...she wanted to be a ballerina for a while, like most little girls. That\u2019s a dancer who dances on her toes,\u201d I explained, and he laughed in surprise. \u201cThen she wanted to be a garbageman\u2014that was after our garbageman gave her a ride in his truck\u2014and then a deep-sea diver, and a mailman, and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat in God\u2019s name is a deep-sea diver? Let alone a garbageman?\u201d</p><p>By the time I had finished a brief catalog of twentieth-century occupations, we were facing each other, our legs twined comfortably together, and I was admiring the way his nipple stiffened to a tiny bump under the ball of my thumb.</p><p>\u201cI never was sure whether she really wanted to read history, or whether she did it mostly to please Frank. She loved him so much\u2014and he was so proud of her.\u201d I paused, thinking, as his hand played down the length of my back.</p><p>\u201cShe started taking history classes at the university when she was still in high school\u2014I told you how the school system works? And then when Frank died...I rather think she went ahead with history because she thought he would have wanted it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s loyal.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes.\u201d I ran my hand up through his hair, feeling the solid, rounded bones of his skull, and his scalp under my fingers. \u201cCan\u2019t think where she got that particular trait from.\u201d</p><p>He snorted briefly and gathered me closer.</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t you?\u201d Without waiting for an answer, he went on, \u201cIf she goes on wi\u2019 the history\u2014d\u2019ye think she\u2019ll find us? Written down somewhere, I mean.\u201d</p><p>The thought had honestly not occurred to me, and for a moment I lay quite still. Then I stretched a bit, and laid my head on his shoulder with a small laugh, not altogether humorous.</p><p>\u201cI shouldn\u2019t think so. Not unless we were to do something newsworthy.\u201d I gestured vaguely toward the cabin wall, and the endless wilderness outside. \u201cNot much chance of that here, I don\u2019t imagine. And she\u2019d have to be deliberately looking, in any case.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould she?\u201d</p><p>I was silent for a moment, breathing the musky, deep scent of him.</p><p>\u201cI hope not,\u201d I said quietly, at last. \u201cShe should have her own life\u2014not spend her time looking back.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t respond directly to this, but took my hand and eased it between us, sighing as I took hold of him.</p><p>\u201cYe\u2019re a verra intelligent woman, Sassenach, but shortsighted, forbye. Though perhaps it\u2019s only modesty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what makes you say that?\u201d I asked, mildly piqued.</p><p>\u201cThe lassie\u2019s loyal, ye said. She\u2019ll have loved her father enough to shape her life to do as he would have wanted, even after he\u2019s dead. D\u2019ye think she loved you less?\u201d</p><p>I turned my head, and let the piled hair fall down over my face.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I said at last, voice muffled in the pillow.</p><p>\u201cWell, then.\u201d He took me by the h*ps and turned me, rolling slowly on top of me. We didn\u2019t speak anymore, then, as the melting boundaries of our bodies disappeared.</p><p>It was slow, dreamy and peaceful, his body and mine as much as mine was his, so that I curled my foot round his leg and felt both smooth sole and hairy shin, felt callused palm and tender flesh, was knife and sheath together, the rhythm of our movement that of one heart beating.</p><p>The fire crackled softly to itself, casting red and yellow highlights on the wooden walls of our snug refuge, and we lay in quiet peace, not bothering to sort out whose limbs were whose. On the very verge of sleep, I felt Jamie\u2019s breath, warm on my neck.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019ll look,\u201d he said, with certainty.</p><p>There was a brief thaw two days later, and Jamie\u2014suffering slightly from cabin fever himself\u2014decided to take advantage of it to go hunting. There was still snow on the ground, but it was thin and patchy; the going would be easy enough on the slopes, he thought.</p><p>I wasn\u2019t so sure as I scooped snow into a basket for melting, later in the morning. The snow under the bushes still lay thick, though it had indeed melted on the exposed ground. I hoped he was right, though\u2014our food supplies were low, and we had had no meat at all for more than a week; even the snares Jamie kept set had been buried under the snow.</p><p>I took my snow inside and tipped it into the large cauldron, feeling, as I always did, rather like a witch.</p><p>\u201c \u2018Double, double, toil and trouble\u2019 \u201d I muttered, watching the white clumps hiss and fade into the roiling liquid.</p><p>I had one large cauldron, filled with water, which bubbled constantly on the fire. This was not only the basic supply for washing but the means of cooking everything that could not be grilled, fried, or roasted. Stews and things to be boiled were put into hollow gourds or stoneware jars, sealed, and lowered on strings into the bubbling depths, to be hauled out at intervals for checking. By this means, I could cook an entire meal in the one pot, and have hot water for washing afterward.</p><p>I dumped a second basket of snow into a wooden bowl and left it to melt more slowly; drinking water for the day. Then, with nothing of great urgency to do, I sat down to read Daniel Rawlings\u2019s casebook and mend stockings, my toes comfortably toasting by the fire.</p><p>At first, I didn\u2019t worry when Jamie didn\u2019t come back. That is, I did worry\u2014I always worried when he was gone for long\u2014but in a small and secret way that I succeeded for the most part in hiding from myself. When the shadows on the snow turned violet with the sinking sun, though, I began to listen for him with an increasing intensity.</p><p>I went about my work in constant expectation of the crunch of his footsteps, listening for a shout, ready to run out and lend a hand if he had brought back a turkey for plucking or some more or less edible thing in need of cleaning. I fed and watered the mules and horses, looking always up the mountain. As the afternoon light died around me, though, the expectation faded into hope.</p><p>It was growing chilly in the cabin, and I went out for more wood. It couldn\u2019t be much past four o\u2019clock, I thought, and yet the shadows under the huckleberry bushes were already cold and blue. Another hour, and it would be dusk; it would be full dark in two.</p><p>The woodpile was dusted with snow, the outer logs damp. By pulling a chunk of hickory from the side, though, I could reach inside and extract dry splits\u2014being always mindful of snakes, skunks, and anything else that might have sought shelter in the hollow thus provided.</p><p>I sniffed, then bent and peered cautiously inside, and as a final precaution poked a long stick inside and stirred it briefly round. Hearing no scuffles, slitherings, or other sounds of alarm, I reached inside with confidence, and groped until my fingers encountered the deep-ridged grain of a chunk of fat pine. I wanted a hot, quick-burning fire tonight; after a full day spent hunting in snow, Jamie would be chilled through.</p><p>Fat pine for the heart of the fire, then, and three small chunks of slower-burning hickory from the wet outer layer of the woodpile. I could stack those inside the hearth to dry, while I finished the supper making; then when we went to bed, I\u2019d smoor the fire with the damp hickory, which would burn more slowly, smoldering till morning.</p><p>The shadows went to indigo and faded into the gray winter dusk. The sky was lavender with thick cloud; snow clouds. I could breathe the cold wetness in the air; when the temperature fell after dark, so would the snow.</p><p>\u201cBloody man,\u201d I said aloud. \u201cWhat have you done, shot a moose?\u201d My voice sounded small in the muffled air, but the thought made me feel better. If he had in fact bagged something large near the end of the day, he might well have chosen to camp by the carcass; butchering a large animal was exhausting, lengthy work, and meat was too hard come by to leave it to the mercies of predators.</p><p>My vegetable stew was bubbling, and the cabin was filled with the savory scent of onions and wild garlic, but I had no appetite. I pushed the kettle on its hook to the back of the hearth\u2014easy enough to heat again when he came. A tiny flash of green caught my eye, and I stooped to look. A tiny salamander, frightened out of its winter refuge in a crack of the wood.</p><p>It was green and black, vivid as a tiny jewel; I scooped him up before he could panic and run into the fire, and carried the damp little thing outside, wriggling madly against my palm. I put him back in the woodpile, safely near the bottom.</p><p>\u201cWatch out,\u201d I said to him, \u201cyou might not be so lucky next time!\u201d</p><p>I paused before going back inside. It had gone dark now, but I could still make out the trunks of the trees around the clearing, chalk and gray against the looming black bulk of the mountain beyond. Nothing stirred among the trees, but a few fat wet flakes of snow began to fall from the soft pink sky, melting at once on the bare ground of the dooryard. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I barred the door, ate some supper without tasting it, smoored the fire with damp hickory, and lay down to sleep. He might have met some men from Anna Ooka and be camped with them.</p><p>The scent of hickory smoke floated in the air, wisps of white curling up over the hearth. The beams above were already black with soot, though fires had burned here for no more than two months now. Fresh resin still oozed from the timber by my head, in small gold droplets that glowed like honey and smelled of turpentine, sharp and clean. The ax strokes in the wood showed in the firelight, and I had a sudden, vivid memory of Jamie\u2019s broad back, sheened with sweat as he swung the ax, over and over in strokes like clockwork, the ax blade coming down in a flash of metal inches from his foot as he worked his way along the squared rough timber.</p><p>It was awfully easy to misjudge the stroke of an ax or hatchet. He might have cut wood for his fire and missed his stroke, caught an arm or leg. My imagination, always eager to help out, promptly supplied a crystal-clear vision of arterial blood spurting onto white snow in a crimson spray.</p><p>I flounced over onto my side. He knew how to live outdoors. He\u2019d spent seven years in a cave, for heaven\u2019s sake!</p> <p>In Scotland, said my imagination, cynically. Where the biggest carnivore is a wildcat the size of a house cat. Where the biggest human threat was English soldiers.</p><p>\u201cFiddlesticks!\u201d I said, and rolled onto my back. \u201cHe\u2019s a grown man and he\u2019s armed to the teeth and he certainly knows what to do if it\u2019s snowing!\u201d</p><p>What would he do? I wondered. Find or make shelter, I supposed. I recalled the crude lean-to he\u2019d built for us when we first camped on the ridge, and felt a little reassured. If he hadn\u2019t hurt himself, he probably wouldn\u2019t freeze to death.</p><p>If he hadn\u2019t hurt himself. If something else hadn\u2019t hurt him. The bears were presumably fat and fast asleep, but the wolves still hunted in winter, and the catamounts; I recalled the one I had met by the stream, and shivered in spite of the feather bed.</p><p>I rolled onto my stomach, the quilts drawn up around my shoulders. It was warm in the cabin, warmer in the bed, but my hands and feet were still icy. I longed for Jamie, in a visceral way that had nothing to do with thought or reason. To be alone with Jamie was bliss, adventure, and absorption. To be alone without him was...to be alone.</p> <p>I could hear the whisper of snow against the oiled hide that covered the window near my head. If it kept up, his tracks would be covered by morning. And if anything had happened to him...</p><p>I flung back the quilts and got up. I dressed quickly, without thinking too much about what I was doing; I\u2019d thought too much already. I put on my woolen cutty sark for insulation beneath my buckskins, and two pairs of stockings. I thanked God that my boots were freshly greased with otter fat; they smelt very fishy, but would keep the damp out for a good while.</p><p>He had taken the hatchet; I had to split another piece of fat pine with a mallet and wedge, cursing my slowness as I did so. Having now decided on action, every small delay seemed an unbearable irritation. The long-grained wood split easily, though; I had five decent faggots, four of which I bound with a leather strap. I thrust the end of the fifth deep into the smoky embers of the fire, and waited till the end was well caught.</p><p>Then I tied a small medicine bag about my waist, checked to be sure I had the pouch of flints and kindling, put on my cloak, took up my bundle and my torch, and set out into the falling snow.</p><p>It was not as cold as I had feared; once I began moving, I was quite warm inside my wrappings. It was very quiet; there was no wind, and the whisper of the snowfall drowned all the usual noises of the night.</p><p>He had meant to walk his trapline, that much I knew. If he came across promising sign en route, though, he would have followed it. The previous snow lay thin and patchy on the ground, but the earth was soaked, and Jamie was a big man; I was fairly sure I could follow his track, if I came across it. And if I came across him, denned up for the night near his kill, so much the better. Two slept much better than one in the cold.</p> <p>Past the bare chestnuts that ringed our clearing to the west, I turned uphill. I had no great sense of direction, but could certainly tell up from down. Jamie had also carefully taught me to navigate using large, immutable landmarks. I glanced toward the falls, their white cascade no more than a blur in the distance. I couldn\u2019t hear them; what wind there was must be away from me.</p><p>\u201cWhen you\u2019re hunting, ye want the wind toward ye,\u201d Jamie had explained. \u201cSo the stag or the hare wilna scent ye.\u201d</p><p>I wondered uncomfortably what might be out in the dark, scenting me on the snowborne air. I wasn\u2019t armed, save for my torch. The light glittered red on the crust of packed snow, and shattered from the ice that coated every twig. If I got within a quarter-mile of him, he\u2019d see me.</p><p>The first snare was set in a small dell no more than two hundred yards uphill from the cabin, amid a grove of spruce and hemlock. I had been with him when he set it, but that had been in daylight; even with the torch, everything looked strange and unfamiliar by night.</p><p>I cast to and fro, bending close to bring my light near the ground. It took several journeys back and forth across the little dell before I finally spotted what I was looking for\u2014the dark indentation of a foot in a patch of snow between two spruce trees. A little more looking and I found the snare, still set. Either it had caught nothing, or he had removed the catch and reset it.</p><p>The footprints led out of the clearing and upward again, then disappeared in a bare patch of matted dead leaves. A moment\u2019s panic as I crisscrossed the patch, looking for a scuffled place that might be a footprint. Nothing showed; the leaves must be a foot thick here, spongy and resilient. But there! Yes, there was a log overturned; I could see the dark, wet furrow where it had lain, and the scuffed moss on its side. Ian had told me that squirrels and chipmunks sometimes hibernated in the cavities under logs.</p><p>Very slowly, constantly losing the trail and having to circle and backtrack to find it again, I followed him from one snare to another. The snow was falling thicker and faster, and I felt some uneasiness. If it covered his tracks before I found him, how would I find my way back to the cabin?</p><p>I looked back, but could see nothing behind me but a long, treacherous slope of unbroken snow that fell to the dark line of an unfamiliar brook below, its rocks poking up like teeth. No sign of the cheerful plume of smoke and sparks from our chimney. I turned slowly round in a circle, but I could no longer see the falls, either.</p> <p>\u201cFine,\u201d I muttered to myself. \u201cYou\u2019re lost. Now what?\u201d I sternly quelled an incipient attack of panic, and stood still to think. I wasn\u2019t totally lost. I didn\u2019t know where I was, but that wasn\u2019t quite the same thing. I still had Jamie\u2019s trail to guide me\u2014or would have, until the snow covered it. And if I could find him, he presumably could find the cabin.</p><p>My torch was burning dangerously low; I could feel the heat of it, blistering on my hand. I extracted another of the dry faggots from under my cloak, and lit it from the stub of the first, dropping the ember just before it burned my fingers.</p><p>Was I going farther from the cabin, I wondered, or walking parallel to it? I knew that the trapline described a rough circle, but had no idea precisely how many snares there were. I had found three so far, all empty and waiting.</p><p>The fourth one wasn\u2019t empty. My torch caught the glitter of ice crystals, fringing the fur of a large hare, stretched out under a frozen bush. I touched it, picked it up and disentangled the noose from its neck. It was stiff, whether from cold or rigor mortis. Been dead a while, then\u2014and what did that tell me about Jamie\u2019s whereabouts?</p><p>I tried to think logically, ignoring the increasing cold seeping through my boots and the growing numbness of face and fingers. The hare lay in snow; I could see the indentations of its pawprints, and the flurry of its death struggle. I couldn\u2019t see any of Jamie\u2019s footprints, though. All right; he hadn\u2019t visited this snare, then.</p><p>I stood still, my breath forming small white clouds around my head. I could feel ice forming inside my nostrils; it was getting colder. Somewhere between the last snare and this one, he had left his path, then. Where? And where had he gone?</p><p>Urgently, I backtracked, looking for the last footprint I was sure of. It took a long time to find; the snow had nearly covered all the bare ground with a thin dusting of glitter. My second torch was half burned through before I found it again. There it was, a featureless blur in the mud on the edge of a stream. I had found the snare with the rabbit only by going in the direction I thought this footprint pointed\u2014but evidently it didn\u2019t. He had stepped out of the mud, and gone...where?</p><p>\u201cJamie!\u201d I shouted. I called several times, but the snow seemed to swallow my voice. I listened, but heard nothing save the gurgle of the ice-rimmed water by my feet.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t behind me, he wasn\u2019t in front of me. Left, then, or right?</p><p>\u201cEeny, meeny, miney, mo,\u201d I muttered, and turned downhill because the walking was easier, shouting now and then.</p><p>I stopped to listen. Was there an answering shout? I called again, but couldn\u2019t make out a reply. The wind was coming up, rattling the tree limbs overhead.</p><p>I took another step, landed on an icy rock, and my foot slid out from under me. I slipped and skidded, floundering down a short, muddy slope, hit a screen of dog-hobble, burst through and clutched a handful of icy twigs, heart pounding.</p><p>At my feet was the edge of a rocky outcrop, ending in thin air. Clinging to the bush to keep from slipping, I edged my way closer, and looked over.</p><p>It was not a cliff, as I\u2019d thought; the drop was no more than five feet. It was not this that made my heart leap into my throat, though, but rather the sight that met my eyes in the leaf-filled hollow below.</p><p>There was a flurry of tossed and scuffled leaves, reminding me unpleasantly of the death marks left by the limp rabbit that hung at my belt. Something large had struggled on the ground here\u2014and then been dragged away. A wide furrow plowed through the leaves, disappearing into the darkness beyond.</p><p>Heedless of my footing, I scrabbled my way down the side of the outcrop and rushed toward the furrow, following it under the overhanging low branches of hemlock and balsam. In the uncertain light of my flickering torch, I followed its path around a pile of rocks, through a clump of wintergreen, and...</p><p>He was lying near the foot of a large split boulder, half covered in leaves, as though something had tried to bury him. He wasn\u2019t curled for warmth, but lay flat on his face, and deathly still. The snow lay thick on the folds of his cloak, dusted the heels of his muddy boots.</p><p>I dropped my torch and flung myself on his body with a cry of horror.</p><p>He let out a bloodcurdling groan and convulsed under me. I jerked back, torn between relief and terror. He wasn\u2019t dead, but he was hurt. Where, how badly?</p><p>\u201cWhere?\u201d I demanded, wrenching at his cloak, which was tangled round his body. \u201cWhere are you hurt? Are you bleeding, have you broken something?\u201d</p><p>I couldn\u2019t see any large patches of blood, but I had dropped my torch, which had promptly extinguished itself in the wet leaves that covered him. The pink sky and falling snow shed a luminous glow over everything, but the light was much too dim to make out details. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He was frighteningly cold; his flesh felt chilly even to my snow-numbed hands, and he stirred sluggishly, subsiding into small moans and grunts. I thought I heard him mumble, \u201cBack,\u201d though, and once I got his cloak out of the way, I tore at his shirt, yanking it ruthlessly out of his breeks.</p><p>This made him groan loudly, and I thrust my hands under the cloth in a panic, looking for the bullet hole. He must have been shot in the back; the entrance wound wouldn\u2019t bleed much, but where had it come out? Had the ball gone clean through? A small piece of my mind found leisure to wonder who\u2019d shot him, and whether they were still nearby.</p><p>Nothing. I found nothing; my groping hands encountered nothing but bare, clean flesh; cold as a slab of marble and webbed with old scars, but completely unperforated. I tried again, forcing myself to slow down, feeling with mind as well as fingers, running my palms slowly over his back from nape to small. Nothing.</p><p>Lower? There were dark smudges on the seat of his breeks; I\u2019d thought them mud. I thrust a hand under him and groped for his laces, jerked them loose and yanked down his breeches.</p> <p>It was mud; his buttocks glowed before me, white, firm, and perfect in their roundness, unmarred beneath a silver fuzz. I clutched a handful of his flesh, unbelieving.</p><p>\u201cIs that you, Sassenach?\u201d he asked, rather drowsily.</p><p>\u201cYes, it\u2019s me! What happened to you?\u201d I demanded, frenzy giving way to indignation. \u201cYou said you\u2019d been shot in the back!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I didn\u2019t. I couldna, for I haven\u2019t been,\u201d he pointed out logically. He sounded calm and still rather sleepy, his speech slightly slurred. \u201cThere\u2019s a verra cold wind whistlin\u2019 up my backside, Sassenach; d\u2019ye think ye could maybe cover me?\u201d</p><p>I jerked up his breeches, making him grunt again.</p> <p>\u201cWhat the hell is the matter with you?\u201d I said.</p><p>He was waking up a bit; he twisted his head to look round at me, moving laboriously.</p><p>\u201cAye, well. No real matter. It\u2019s only that I canna move much.\u201d</p><p>I stared at him.</p><p>\u201cWhy not? Have you twisted your foot? Broken your leg?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh...no.\u201d He sounded a trifle sheepish. \u201cI...ah...I\u2019ve put my back out of joint.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve done it once before,\u201d he assured me. \u201cIt doesna last more than a day or two.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose it didn\u2019t occur to you that you wouldn\u2019t last more than a day or two, lying out here on the ground, covered with snow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt did,\u201d he said, still drowsy, \u201cbut there didna seem much I could do about it.\u201d</p><p>It was rapidly dawning on me that there might not be that much I could do about it, either. He outweighed me by a good sixty pounds; I couldn\u2019t carry him. I couldn\u2019t even drag him very far over slopes and rocks and gullies. It was too steep for a horse; I might possibly persuade one of the mules to come up here\u2014if I could first find my way back to the cabin in the dark, and then find my way back up the mountain, also in the dark\u2014and in the middle of what looked like becoming a blizzard. Or perhaps I could build a toboggan of tree branches, I thought wildly, and career down the snowy slopes astride his body.</p><p>\u201cOh, do get a grip, Beauchamp,\u201d I said aloud. I wiped at my running nose with a fold of cloak, and tried to think what to do next.</p><p>It was a sheltered spot, I realized; looking upward, I could see the snowflakes whirling past the top of the big rock at whose foot we crouched, but there was no wind where we sat, and only a few heavy flakes floated down onto my upturned face.</p><p>Jamie\u2019s hair and shoulders were lightly dusted with snow, and flakes were settling on the exposed backs of his legs. I pulled the hem of his cloak down, then brushed the snow away from his face. His cheek was nearly the same color as the big wet flakes, and his flesh felt stiff when I touched it.</p> <p>Fresh alarm surged through me as I realized that he might be a lot closer to freezing already than I had thought. His eyes were half closed, and cold as it was, he didn\u2019t seem to be shivering much. That was bloody dangerous; with no movement, his muscles were generating no heat, and what warmth he had was leaching slowly from his body. His cloak was already heavy with damp; if I allowed his clothes to become soaked through, he might very well die of hypothermia right in front of me.</p><p>\u201cWake up!\u201d I said, shaking him urgently by the shoulder. He opened his eyes and smiled drowsily at me.</p><p>\u201cMove!\u201d I said. \u201cJamie, you\u2019ve got to move!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d he said calmly. \u201cI told ye that.\u201d He shut his eyes again.</p><p>I grabbed him by the ear and dug my fingernails into the tender lobe. He grunted and jerked his head away.</p><p>\u201cWake up,\u201d I said peremptorily. \u201cDo you hear me? Wake up this moment! Move, damn you! Give me your hand.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t wait for him to comply, but dug under the cloak and seized his hand, which I chafed madly between my own. He opened his eyes again and frowned at me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m all right,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I\u2019m gey tired, aye?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMove your arms,\u201d I ordered, flinging the hand at him. \u201cFlap them, up and down. Can you move your legs at all?\u201d</p><p>He sighed wearily, as though dragging himself out of a sticky bog, and muttered something under his breath in Gaelic, but very slowly he began to move his arms back and forth. With more prodding, he succeeded in flexing his ankles\u2014though any further movement caused instant spasms in his back\u2014and with great reluctance, began to waggle his feet.</p><p>He looked rather like a frog trying to fly, but I wasn\u2019t in any mood to laugh. I didn\u2019t know whether he was actually in danger of freezing or not, but I wasn\u2019t taking any chances. By dint of constant exhortation, aided by judicious pokings, I kept him at this exercise until I had got him altogether awake and shivering. In a thoroughly bad temper, too, but I didn\u2019t mind that.</p><p>\u201cKeep moving,\u201d I advised him. I got up with some difficulty, having grown quite stiff from crouching over him so long. \u201cMove, I say!\u201d I added sharply, as he showed symptoms of flagging. \u201cStop and I\u2019ll step square on your back, I swear I will!\u201d</p><p>I glanced around, a little blearily. The snow was still falling, and it was difficult to see more than a few feet. We needed shelter\u2014more than the rock alone could provide.</p><p>\u201cHemlock,\u201d he said between his teeth. I glanced down at him, and he jerked his head toward a clump of trees nearby. \u201cTake the hatchet. Big...branches. Six feet. C-cut four.\u201d He was breathing heavily, and there was a tinge of color visible in his face, despite the dim light. He\u2019d stopped moving in spite of my threats, but his teeth were clenched because they were chattering; a sign I rejoiced to see.</p><p>I stooped and groped beneath his cloak again, this time searching for the hatchet belted round his waist. I couldn\u2019t resist sliding a hand under him, inside the neck of his fringed woolen hunting shirt. Warm! Thank God, he was still warm; his chest felt superficially chilled from its contact with the wet ground, but it was still warmer than my fingers.</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d I said, taking my hand away and standing up with the hatchet. \u201cHemlock. Six-foot branches, do you mean?\u201d</p><p>He nodded, shivering violently, and I set off at once for the trees he indicated.</p><p>Inside the silent grove, the fragrance of hemlock and cedar enfolded me at once in a mist of resins and turpenes, the odor cold and sharp, clean and invigorating. Many of the trees were enormous, with the lower branches well above my head, but there were smaller ones scattered here and there. I saw at once the virtues of this particular tree\u2014no snow fell under them; the fanlike boughs caught the falling snow like umbrellas.</p><p>I hacked at the lower branches, torn between the need for haste and the very real fear of chopping off a few fingers by accident; my hands were numb and awkward with the cold.</p><p>The wood was green and elastic and it took forever to chop through the tough, springy fibers. At last, though, I had four good-sized branches, sporting multiple fans of dense needles. They looked soft and black against the new snow, like big fans of feathers; it was almost a surprise to touch them and feel the hard, cold prick of the needles.</p><p>I dragged them back to the rock, and found that Jamie had managed to scoop more leaves together; he was almost invisible, submerged in a huge drift of black and gray against the foot of the rock.</p><p>Under his terse direction I leaned the hemlock branches fan-up against the face of the rock, the chopped butt ends stuck into the earth at an angle, so as to form a small triangular refuge underneath. Then I took the hatchet again and chopped small pine and spruce branches, pulled up big clumps of dried grass, and piled it all against and over the hemlock screen. Then at last, panting with exertion, I crawled into the shelter beside him.</p><p>I nestled down in the leaves between his body and the rock, wrapped my cloak around both of us, put my arms around his body, and held on hard. Then I found the leisure to shake a bit. Not from cold\u2014not yet\u2014but from a mixture of relief and fear.</p><p>He felt me shivering, and reached awkwardly back to pat me in reassurance.</p><p>\u201cIt will be all right, Sassenach,\u201d he said. \u201cWith the two of us, it will be all right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d I said, and put my forehead against his shoulder blade. It was a long time before I stopped shaking, though.</p><p>\u201cHow long have you been out here?\u201d I asked finally. \u201cOn the ground, I mean?\u201d</p><p>He started to shrug, then stopped abruptly, groaning.</p><p>\u201cA good time. It was just past noon when I jumped off a wee crop of rock. It wasna more than a few feet high, but when I landed on one foot, my back went click! and next I knew, I was on my face in the dirt, feelin\u2019 as though someone had stabbed me in the spine wi\u2019 a dirk.\u201d</p><p>It wasn\u2019t warm in our snug, by any means; the damp from the leaves was seeping in and the rock at my back seemed to radiate coldness, like some sort of reverse furnace. Still, it was noticeably less cold than it was outside. I began shivering again, for purely physical reasons.</p><p>Jamie felt me, and groped at his throat.</p><p>\u201cCan ye get my cloak unfastened, Sassenach? Put it over ye.\u201d</p><p>It took some maneuvering, and the cost of a few muffled oaths from Jamie as he tried to shift his weight, but I got it loose at last, and spread it over the two of us. I reached down and laid a cautious hand on his back, gently rucking up his shirt to put my hand on cool, bare flesh.</p><p>\u201cTell me where it hurts,\u201d I said. I hoped to hell he hadn\u2019t slipped a disc; hideous thoughts of his being permanently crippled raced through my mind, along with pragmatic considerations of how I was to get him off the mountain, even if he wasn\u2019t. Would I have to leave him here, and fetch food up to him daily until he recovered?</p><p>\u201cRight there,\u201d he said, with a hiss of indrawn breath. \u201cAye, that\u2019s it. A wicked stab just there, and if I move, it runs straight down the back o\u2019 my leg, like a red-hot wire.\u201d</p><p>I felt very carefully, with both hands now, probing and pressing, urging him to try to lift one leg, right, now the other knee...no?</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he assured me. \u201cDinna be worrit, though, Sassenach. It\u2019s the same as before. It gets better.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYes, you said it happened before. When was that?\u201d</p><p>He stirred briefly and settled, pressing back against my palms with a small groan.</p><p>\u201cOch! Damn, that hurts. At the prison.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPain in the same place?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAye.\u201d</p><p>I could feel a hard knot in the muscle on his right side, just below the kidney, and a bunching in the erector spinae, the long muscles near the spine. From his description of the prior occurrence, I was fairly sure it was only severe muscle spasm. For which the proper prescription was warmth, rest, and anti-inflammatory medication.</p><p>Couldn\u2019t get much further away from those conditions, I thought with some grimness.</p><p>\u201cI suppose I could try acupuncture,\u201d I said, thinking aloud. \u201cI\u2019ve got Mr. Willoughby\u2019s needles in my pouch, and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSassenach,\u201d he said, in measured tones. \u201cI can stand fine bein\u2019 hurt, cold, and hungry. I wilna put up wi\u2019 being stabbed in the back by my own wife. Can ye not offer a bit of sympathy and comfort instead?\u201d</p> <p>I laughed, and slid an arm around him, pressing close against his back. I let my hand slide down and rest in delicate suggestion, well below his navel.</p><p>\u201cEr...what sort of comfort did you have in mind?\u201d</p><p>He hastily grasped my hand, to prevent further intrusions.</p><p>\u201cNot that,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cMight take your mind off the pain.\u201d I wiggled my fingers invitingly, and he tightened his grip.</p><p>\u201cI daresay,\u201d he said dryly. \u201cWell, I\u2019ll tell ye, Sassenach; once we\u2019ve got home, and I\u2019ve a warm bed to lie in and a hot supper in my belly, that notion might have a good bit of appeal. As it is, the thought of\u2014for Christ\u2019s sake, have ye not the slightest idea how cold your hands are, woman?\u201d</p> <p>I laid my cheek against his back and laughed. I could feel the quiver of his own mirth, though he couldn\u2019t laugh aloud without hurting his back.</p><p>At last we lay silent, listening to the whisper of falling snow. It was dark under the hemlock boughs, but my eyes were adapted enough to be able to see patches of the oddly glowing snow-light through the screen of needles overhead. Tiny flakes came through the open patches; I could see it in some places, as a thin cloud of white mist, and I could feel the cold tingle as it struck my face.</p><p>Jamie himself was no more than a humped dark shape in front of me, though as my eyes became accustomed to the murk, I could see the paler stalk where his neck emerged between his shirt and his queued hair. The queue itself lay cool and smooth against my face; by turning my head only a bit, I could brush it with my lips.</p><p>\u201cWhat time do you think it is?\u201d I asked. I had no idea, myself; I had left the house well after dark, and spent what seemed an eternity looking for him on the mountain.</p><p>\u201cLate,\u201d he said. \u201cIt will be a long time before the dawn, though,\u201d he added, answering my real question. \u201cIt\u2019s just past the solstice, aye? It\u2019s one of the longest nights of the year.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, lovely,\u201d I said, in dismay. I wasn\u2019t warm, by any means\u2014I still couldn\u2019t feel my toes\u2014but I had stopped shivering. A dreadful lethargy was stealing over me, my muscles yielding to fatigue and cold. I had visions of the two of us freezing peacefully together, curled up like hedgehogs in the leaves. They did say it was a comfortable death, but that didn\u2019t make the prospect any more appealing.</p><p>Jamie\u2019s breathing was getting slower and deeper.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t go to sleep!\u201d I said urgently, poking him in the armpit.</p> <p>\u201cAgh!\u201d He pressed his arm tight to his side, recoiling. \u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe mustn\u2019t sleep; we\u2019ll freeze to death.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, we won\u2019t,\u201d he said crossly. \u201cIt\u2019s snowing outside; we\u2019ll be covered over soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that,\u201d I said, rather cross in my turn. \u201cWhat\u2019s that got to do with it?\u201d</p><p>He tried to turn his head to look at me, but couldn\u2019t, quite.</p><p>\u201cSnow\u2019s cold if ye touch it,\u201d he explained, striving for patience, \u201cbut it keeps the cold out, aye? Like a blanket. It\u2019s a great deal warmer in a house that\u2019s covered wi\u2019 snow than one that\u2019s standing clean in the wind. How d\u2019ye think bears manage? They sleep in the winter, and they dinna freeze.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey have layers of fat,\u201d I protested. \u201cI thought that kept them warm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHa ha,\u201d he said, and reaching back with some effort, grabbed me firmly by the bottom. \u201cWell, then, ye needna worry a bit, eh?\u201d</p><p>With great deliberation I pulled down his collar, stretched my head up, and licked the back of his neck, in a lingering swipe from nape to hairline.</p><p>\u201cAaah!\u201d He shuddered violently, making a sprinkle of snow fall from the branches above us. He let go of my bottom to scrub at the back of his neck.</p><p>\u201cThat was a terrible thing to do!\u201d he said, reproachful. \u201cAnd me lyin\u2019 here helpless as a log!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBah, humbug,\u201d I said. I nestled closer, feeling somewhat reassured. \u201cYou\u2019re sure we aren\u2019t going to freeze to death, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I shouldna think it likely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHm,\u201d I said, feeling somewhat less reassured. \u201cWell, perhaps we\u2019d better stay awake for a bit, then, just in case?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wilna wave my arms about anymore,\u201d he said definitely. \u201cThere\u2019s no room. And if ye stick your icy wee paws in my breeks, I swear I\u2019ll throttle ye, bad back or no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, all right,\u201d I said. \u201cWhat if I tell you a story, instead?\u201d</p><p>Highlanders loved stories, and Jamie was no exception.</p><p>\u201cOh, aye,\u201d he said, sounding much happier. \u201cWhat sort of story is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA Christmas story,\u201d I said, settling myself along the curve of his body. \u201cAbout a miser named Ebenezer Scrooge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAn Englishman, I daresay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I said. \u201cBe quiet and listen.\u201d</p><p>I could see my own breath as I talked, white in the dim, cold air. The snow was falling heavily outside our shelter; when I paused in the story, I could hear the whisper of flakes against the hemlock branches, and the far-off whine of wind in the trees.</p><p>I knew the story very well; it had been part of our Christmas ritual, Frank\u2019s and Brianna\u2019s and mine. From the time Bree was five or six, we had read A Christmas Carol every year, starting a week or two before Christmas, Frank and I taking it in turns to read to her each night before bed.</p><p>\u201cAnd the specter said, \u2018I am the Ghost of Christmas Past...\u2019 \u201d</p><p>I might not be freezing to death, but the cold had a strange, hypnotic effect nonetheless. I had gone past the phase of acute discomfort and felt now slightly disembodied. I knew my hands and feet were icy, and my body chilled half through, but it didn\u2019t seem to matter anymore. I floated in a peaceful white mist, seeing the words swirl round my head like snowflakes as I spoke them.</p><p>\u201c...and there was dear old Fezziwig, among the lights and music...\u201d</p><p>I couldn\u2019t tell whether I was gradually thawing or becoming colder. I was conscious of an overall feeling of relaxation, and an altogether peculiar sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, as though I had once before been entombed, insulated in snow, snug despite desolation outside.</p><p>As Bob Cratchit bought his meager bird, I remembered. I went on talking automatically, the flow of the story coming from somewhere well below the level of consciousness, but my memory was in the front seat of a stalled 1956 Oldsmobile, its windscreen caked with snow.</p><p>We had been on our way to visit an elderly relative of Frank\u2019s, somewhere in upstate New York. The snow came on hard, halfway there, howling down across the icy roads with gusts of wind. Before we knew where we were, we had skidded off the road and halfway into a ditch, the windscreen wipers slashing futilely at the pelting snow.</p><p>There was nothing to be done but wait for morning, and rescue. We had had a picnic hamper and some old blankets; we brought Brianna up into the front seat between us, and huddled all together under coats and blankets, sipping lukewarm cocoa from the thermos and making jokes to keep her from being frightened.</p><p>As it grew later, and colder, we huddled closer, and to distract Brianna, Frank began to tell her Dickens\u2019s story from memory, counting on me to supply the missing bits. Neither of us could have done it alone, but between us, we managed well. By the time the sinister Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come had made his appearance, Brianna was snuggled sound asleep under the coats, a warm, boneless weight against my side.</p><p>There was no need to finish the story, but we did, talking to each other below the words, hands touching below the layers of blankets. I remembered Frank\u2019s hands, warm and strong on mine, thumb stroking my palm, outlining my fingers. Frank had always loved my hands.</p><p>The car had filled with the mist of our breathing, and drops of water ran down inside the white-choked windows. Frank\u2019s head had been a dark cameo, dim against the white. He had leaned toward me at the last, nose and cheeks chilled, lips warm on mine as he whispered the last words of the story.</p><p>\u201c \u2018God bless us, every one,\u2019 \u201d I ended, and lay silent, a small needle of grief like an ice splinter through my heart. It was quiet inside the shelter, and seemed darker; snow had covered over all the openings.</p><p>Jamie reached back and touched my leg.</p><p>\u201cPut your hands inside my shirt, Sassenach,\u201d he said softly. I slid one hand up under his shirt in front, to rest against his chest, the other up his back. The faded whip marks felt like threads under his skin.</p><p>He laid his hand against mine, pressing it tight against his chest. He was very warm, and his heart beat slow and strong under my fingers.</p><p>\u201cSleep, a nighean donn,\u201d he said. \u201cI wilna let ye freeze.\u201d</p><p>I woke abruptly from a chilly doze, with Jamie\u2019s hand squeezing my thigh.</p><p>\u201cHush,\u201d he said softly. Our tiny shelter was still dim, but the quality of the light had changed. It was morning; we were covered over with a thick blanket of snow that blocked the daylight, but the faint otherworldly quality of the night\u2019s darkness had vanished.</p><p>The silence had vanished, too. Sounds from outside were muffled, but audible. I heard what Jamie had heard\u2014a faint echo of voices\u2014and jerked up in excitement.</p><p>\u201cHush!\u201d he said again, in a fierce whisper, and squeezed my leg harder.</p><p>The voices were drawing closer, and it became almost possible to pick out words. Almost. Strain as I might, I could make no sense of what was being said. Then I realized that it was because they were not speaking any language I recognized.</p><p>Indians. It was an Indian tongue. But I thought the language was not Tuscarora, even though I couldn\u2019t yet make out words; the rise and fall was similar, but the rhythm was somehow different. I brushed the hair out of my eyes, feeling torn in two directions.</p><p>Here was the help we so badly needed\u2014by the sound of it, there were several men in the party, enough to move Jamie safely. On the other hand, did we really want to attract the attention of a band of unfamiliar Indians who might be raiders?</p><p>Rather plainly we didn\u2019t, judging from Jamie\u2019s attitude. He had managed to lift himself on one elbow, and he had his knife drawn, ready in his right hand. He scratched his stubbled chin absently with the point as he tilted his head to listen more intently to the approaching voices. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>A clump of snow fell from the framework of our cage, landing on my head with a little plop! and making me start. The movement loosened more snow, which poured inward in a glittering cascade, dusting Jamie\u2019s head and shoulders with fine white powder.</p><p>His fingers were gripping my leg hard enough to leave bruises, but I didn\u2019t move or make a sound. A patch of snow had fallen from the latticework of hemlock branches, leaving numerous small spaces through which I could see out between the needles, peering over Jamie\u2019s shoulder.</p><p>The ground sloped a little away from us, falling a few feet to the level of the grove where I had cut branches the night before. Everything was thick with snow; a good four inches must have fallen during the night. It was just past dawn, and the rising sun painted the black trees with coruscations of red and gold, striking white glare from the icy sweep of snow below. The wind had come up in the wake of the storm; loose snow blew off the branches in drifting clouds, like smoke.</p><p>The Indians were on the other side of the grove; I could hear the voices plainly now; arguing about something, from the sound of it. A sudden thought raised gooseflesh on my arms; if they came through the grove, they might see the hacked branches where I had chopped limbs from the hemlocks. I hadn\u2019t been neat; there would be needles and bits of bark scattered all over the ground. Would enough snow have trickled through the branches to cover my awkward spoor?</p> <p>A flash of movement showed in the trees, then another, and suddenly they were there, materializing out of the hemlock grove like dragon\u2019s teeth sprung from the snow.</p><p>They were dressed for winter travel, in fur and leather, some with cloaks or cloth coats atop their leggings and soft boots. They all carried bundles of blankets and provisions, had headpieces made of fur, and most had snowshoes slung across their shoulders; evidently the snow here was not deep enough to render them necessary.</p><p>They were armed; I could see a few muskets, and tomahawks or war clubs hung at every belt. Six, seven, eight...I counted silently as they came out of the trees in single file, each man treading in the prints of the one before him. One near the back called out something, half laughing, and a man near the front replied over his shoulder, his words lost in the blowing veil of snow and wind.</p><p>I drew a deep breath. I could smell Jamie\u2019s scent, a sharp tinge of fresh sweat above his normal musky sleep-smell. I was sweating, too, in spite of the cold. Did they have dogs? Could they sniff us out, hidden as we were beneath the sharp reek of spruce and hemlock?</p><p>Then I realized that the wind must be toward us, carrying the sound of their voices. No, even dogs wouldn\u2019t scent us. But would they see the branches that framed our den? Even as I wondered this, a large patch of snow slid off with a rush, landing with a soft flump! outside.</p> <p>Jamie drew in his breath sharply, and I leaned over his shoulder, staring. The last man had come out of the gap in the trees, an arm across his face to shield it from the blowing snow.</p><p>He was a Jesuit. He wore a short cape of bearskin over his habit, leather leggings and moccasins under it\u2014but he had black skirts, kilted up for walking in the snow, and a wide, flat black priest\u2019s hat, held on with one hand against the wind. His face, when he showed it, was blond-bearded, and so fair-skinned that I could see the redness of his cheeks and nose even at such a distance.</p><p>\u201cCall them!\u201d I whispered, leaning close to Jamie\u2019s ear. \u201cThey\u2019re Christians, they must be, to have a priest with them. They won\u2019t hurt us.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head slowly, not taking his eyes off the file of men, now vanishing from our view behind a snow-topped outcropping.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said, half under his breath. \u201cNo. Christians they may be, but...\u201d He shook his head again, more decidedly. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>There was no use arguing with him. I rolled my eyes in mingled frustration and resignation.</p> <p>\u201cHow\u2019s your back?\u201d</p><p>He stretched gingerly, and halted abruptly in mid-motion, with a strangled cry as though he\u2019d been skewered.</p><p>\u201cNot so good, hm?\u201d I said, sympathy well laced with sarcasm. He gave me a dirty look, eased himself very slowly back into his bed of crushed leaves, and shut his eyes with a sigh.</p><p>\u201cYou have of course thought of some ingenious way of getting down the mountain, I imagine?\u201d I said politely.</p><p>He opened one eye.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said, and shut it again. He breathed quietly, his chest rising and falling gently under his fringed hunting shirt, giving a brilliant impression of a man with nothing on his mind but his hair.</p><p>It was a cold day, but a bright one, and the sun was jabbing brilliant fingers of light into our erstwhile sanctum, making little blobs of snow drop like falling sugarplums around us. I scooped up one of these and gently decanted it into the neck of his shirt.</p><p>He drew in his breath through his teeth with a sharp hiss, opened his eyes, and regarded me coldly.</p> <p>\u201cI was thinking,\u201d he informed me.</p><p>\u201cOh. Sorry to interrupt, then.\u201d I eased myself down beside him, pulling the tangled cloaks up over us. The wind was beginning to lace through the holes in our shelter, and it occurred to me that he\u2019d been quite right about the sheltering effects of snow. Only there wasn\u2019t going to be any snow falling tonight, I didn\u2019t think.</p><p>Then there was the little matter of food to be considered. My stomach had been making subdued protests for some time, and Jamie\u2019s now voiced its much louder objections. He squinted censoriously down his long, straight nose at the offender.</p><p>\u201cHush,\u201d he said reprovingly in Gaelic, and cast his eyes upward. At last he sighed and looked at me.</p><p>\u201cWell, then,\u201d he said. \u201cYe\u2019d best wait a bit, to be sure yon savages are well away. Then ye\u2019ll go down to the cabin\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know where it is.\u201d</p><p>He made a small noise of exasperation.</p><p>\u201cHow did ye find me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTracked you,\u201d I said, with a certain amount of pride. I glanced through the needles at the blowing wilderness outside. \u201cI don\u2019t suppose I can do it in reverse, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d He looked mildly impressed. \u201cWell, that was verra resourceful of ye, Sassenach. Dinna worry, though; I can tell ye how to go, to find your way back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. And then what?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged one shoulder. The bit of snow had melted, running down his chest, dampening his shirt and leaving a tiny pool of clear water standing in the hollow of his throat.</p><p>\u201cBring me back a bit of food, and a blanket. I should be able to move in a few days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeave you here?\u201d I glared at him, my turn to be exasperated.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be all right,\u201d he said mildly.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be eaten by wolves!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I shouldna think so,\u201d he said casually. \u201cThey\u2019ll be busy with the elk, most likely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat elk?\u201d</p><p>He nodded toward the hemlock grove.</p><p>\u201cThe one I shot yesterday. I took it in the neck, but the shot didna quite kill it at once. It ran through there. I was following it, when I hurt myself.\u201d He rubbed a hand over the copper and silver bristles on his chin.</p><p>\u201cI canna think it went far. I suppose the snow must have covered the carcass, else our wee friends would have seen it, coming from that direction.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019ve shot an elk, which is going to draw wolves like flies, and you propose to lie here in the freezing cold waiting for them? I suppose you think by the time they get round to the second course, you\u2019ll be so numb you won\u2019t notice when they start gnawing on your feet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t shout,\u201d he said. \u201cThe savages might not be so far away, yet.\u201d</p><p>I was drawing breath for further remarks on the subject, when he stopped me, putting his hand up to caress my cheek.</p><p>\u201cClaire,\u201d he said gently. \u201cYe canna move me. There\u2019s nothing else to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is,\u201d I said, repressing a quaver in my voice. \u201cI\u2019ll stay with you. I\u2019ll bring you blankets and food, but I\u2019m not leaving you up here alone. I\u2019ll bring wood, and we\u2019ll make a fire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no need. I can manage,\u201d he insisted.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d I said, between my teeth. I remembered all too well what it had been like in the cabin, during those empty, suffocating hours of waiting. Freezing my arse off in the snow for several days wasn\u2019t at all an appealing prospect, but it was better than the alternative.</p><p>He saw I meant it, and smiled.</p><p>\u201cWell, then. Ye might bring some whisky, too, if there\u2019s any left.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s half a bottle,\u201d I said, feeling happier. \u201cI\u2019ll bring it.\u201d</p><p>He got an arm around me, and pulled me into the curve of his shoulder. In spite of the howling wind outside, it was actually reasonably cozy under the cloaks, snuggled tight against him. His skin smelled warm and slightly salty, and I couldn\u2019t resist raising my head and putting my lips to the damp hollow of his throat.</p><p>\u201cAah,\u201d he said, shivering. \u201cDon\u2019t do that!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t like it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I dinna like it! How could I? It makes my skin crawl!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I like it,\u201d I protested.</p><p>He looked at me in amazement.</p><p>\u201cYou do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes,\u201d I assured him. \u201cI dearly love to have you nibble on my neck.\u201d</p><p>He narrowed one eye and squinted dubiously at me. Then he reached up, took me delicately by the ear, and drew my head down, turning my face to the side. He flicked his tongue gently at the base of my throat, then lifted his head and set his teeth very softly in the tender flesh at the side of my neck.</p><p>\u201cEeeee,\u201d I said, and shivered uncontrollably.</p><p>He let go, looking at me in astonishment.</p><p>\u201cI will be damned,\u201d he said. \u201cYe do like it; ye\u2019ve gone all gooseflesh and your n**ples are hard as spring cherries.\u201d He passed a hand lightly over my breast; I hadn\u2019t bothered with my makeshift brassiere when I dressed for my impromptu expedition.</p><p>\u201cTold you,\u201d I said, blushing slightly. \u201cI suppose one of my ancestresses was bitten by a vampire or something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA what?\u201d He looked quite blank.</p><p>There was time to kill, so I gave him a thumbnail sketch of the life and times of Count Dracula. He looked bemused and appalled, but his hand carried on with its machinations, having now moved under my buckskin shirt and found its way beneath the cutty sark as well. His fingers were chilly, but I didn\u2019t mind.</p><p>\u201cSome people find the notion terribly erotic,\u201d I ended.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the most disgusting thing I\u2019ve ever heard!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care,\u201d I said, stretching out at full length beside him and putting my head back, throat invitingly exposed. \u201cDo it some more.\u201d</p><p>He muttered something under his breath in Gaelic, but managed to get onto one elbow and roll toward me.</p><p>His mouth was warm and soft, and whether he approved of what he was doing or not, he did it awfully well.</p><p>\u201cOoooh,\u201d I said, and shuddered ecstatically as his teeth sank delicately into my earlobe.</p><p>\u201cOh, well, if it\u2019s like that,\u201d he said in resignation, and taking my hand, pressed it firmly between his thighs. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cGracious,\u201d I said. \u201cAnd here I thought the cold...\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be warm enough soon,\u201d he assured me. \u201cGet them off, aye?\u201d</p><p>It was rather awkward, given the cramped quarters, the difficulty of staying covered in order not to suffer frostbite in any exposed portions, and the fact that Jamie was able to lend only the most basic assistance, but we managed quite satisfactorily nonetheless.</p><p>What with one thing and another, I was rather preoccupied, though, and it was only during a temporary lull in the activities that I became aware of an uneasy sensation, as though I was being watched. I lifted myself on my hands and glanced out through the screen of hemlock, but saw nothing beyond the grove and the snow-covered slope below.</p> <p>Jamie gave a low groan.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t stop,\u201d he murmured, eyes half closed. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought I heard something,\u201d I said, lowering myself onto his chest again.</p><p>At this, I did hear something; a laugh, low but distinct, directly above my head.</p><p>I rolled off in a tangle of cloaks and discarded buckskins, while Jamie cursed and snatched for his pistol.</p> <p>He flung aside the branches with a swoosh, pointing the pistol upward.</p><p>From the top of the rock above, several heads peered over, all grinning. Ian, and four companions from Anna Ooka. The Indians murmured and snickered among themselves, seeming to find something immoderately funny.</p><p>Jamie laid the pistol down, scowling up at his nephew.</p><p>\u201cAnd what the devil are you doin\u2019 here, Ian?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy, I was on my way home to keep Christmas with ye, Uncle,\u201d Ian said, grinning hugely.</p><p>Jamie eyed his nephew with marked disfavor.</p> <p>\u201cChristmas,\u201d he said. \u201cBah, humbug.\u201d</p><p>The elk carcass had frozen in the night. The sight of ice crystals frosting its blank eyes made me shudder\u2014not at the sight of death; that was quite beautiful, with the great dark body so still, crusted with snow\u2014but at the thought that had I not yielded to my sense of uneasiness and gone out into the night searching for Jamie, the stark still life before my eyes might well have been entitled \u201cDead Scotsman in Snow\u201d rather than \u201cFrozen Elk with Arguing Indians.\u201d</p><p>The discussion at last concluded to their satisfaction, Ian informed me that they had decided to return to Anna Ooka, but would see us safely home, in return for a share of the elk meat.</p><p>The carcass had not frozen solidly through; they eviscerated it, leaving the cooling entrails in a heap of blue-gray coils, splotched with black blood. After chopping off the head to further lessen the weight, two of the men slung the body upside down from a pole, its legs tied together. Jamie eyed them darkly, obviously suspecting that they meant to give him the same treatment, but Ian assured him that they could manage a travois; the men were afoot, but they had brought one sturdy pack mule to carry any skins they took.</p><p>The weather had improved; the snow had melted altogether from the exposed ground, and while the air was still crisp and cold, the sky was a blinding blue, and the forest coldly pungent with the scents of spruce and balsam fir.</p><p>It was the smell of hemlock, as we passed through one grove, that reminded me of the beginning of this hegira, and the mysterious band of Indians we had seen.</p><p>\u201cIan,\u201d I said, catching up to him. \u201cJust before you and your friends found us on the mountainside, we saw a band of Indians, with a Jesuit priest. They weren\u2019t from Anna Ooka, I don\u2019t think\u2014do you have any idea who they might have been?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, aye, Auntie. I ken all about them.\u201d He wiped a mittened hand under his red-tipped nose. \u201cWe were following them, when we found you.\u201d</p> <p>The strange Indians, he said, were Mohawk, come from far north. The Tuscarora had been adopted by the Iroquois League some fifty years before, and there was a close association with the Mohawk, with frequent exchanges of visits between the two, both formal and informal.</p><p>The present visit held elements of both\u2014it was a party of young Mohawk men, in search of wives. Their own village having a shortage of marriageable young women, they had determined to come south, to see if suitable mates might be found among the Tuscarora.</p><p>\u201cSee, a woman must belong to the proper clan,\u201d Ian explained. \u201cIf she is the wrong clan, they canna be marrit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike MacDonalds and Campbells, aye?\u201d Jamie chimed in, interested.</p><p>\u201cAye, a bit,\u201d Ian said, grinning. \u201cBut that\u2019s why they brought the priest wi\u2019 them\u2014if they found women, they could be married at once, and not have to sleep in a cold bed all the way home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re Christians, then?\u201d</p><p>Ian shrugged.</p><p>\u201cSome of them. The Jesuits have been among them for some time, and a good many of the Huron are converts. Not so many among the Mohawk, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo they\u2019d been to Anna Ooka?\u201d I asked, curious. \u201cWhy were you and your friends following them?\u201d</p><p>Ian snorted, and tightened the muffler of squirrel skins around his neck.</p><p>\u201cThey may be allies, Auntie, but it doesna mean Nacognaweto and his braves trust them. Even the other Nations of the Iroquois League are afraid of the Mohawk\u2014Christian or no.\u201d</p><p>It was near sunset when we came in sight of the cabin. I was cold and tired, but my heart lifted inexpressibly at the sight of the tiny homestead. One of the mules in the penfold, a light gray creature named Clarence, saw us and brayed enthusiastically in welcome, making the rest of the horses crowd up next to the rails, eager for food.</p><p>\u201cThe horses look fine.\u201d Jamie, with a stockman\u2019s eye, looked first to the animals\u2019 welfare. I was rather more concerned with our own; getting inside, getting warm, and getting fed, as soon as possible.</p><p>We invited Ian\u2019s friends to stay, but they declined, unloading Jamie in the dooryard and vanishing quickly to resume their vigilance over the departing Mohawk.</p><p>\u201cThey dinna like to stay in a white person\u2019s house, Auntie,\u201d Ian explained. \u201cThey think we smell bad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, really?\u201d I said in pique, thinking of a certain elderly gentleman I had met in Anna Ooka, who appeared to have smeared himself with bear grease and then had himself sewn into his clothes for the winter. The pot calling the kettle black, if you asked me.</p><p>Much later, Christmas properly kept with a dram\u2014or two\u2014of whisky all round, we lay at last in our own bed, watching the flames of the newly kindled fire, and listening to Ian\u2019s peaceful snores.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s good to be home again,\u201d I said softly.</p><p>\u201cIt is.\u201d Jamie sighed and pulled me closer, my head tucked into the curve of his shoulder. \u201cI did have the strangest dreams, sleeping in the cold.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did?\u201d I stretched, luxuriating in the soft yielding of the feather-stuffed mattress. \u201cWhat did you dream about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll kinds of things.\u201d He sounded a bit shy. \u201cI dreamt of Brianna, now and again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d That was a little startling; I too had dreamt of Brianna in our icy shelter\u2014something I seldom did.</p><p>\u201cI did wonder...\u201d Jamie hesitated for a moment. \u201cHas she a birthmark, Sassenach? And if so, did ye tell me of it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe does,\u201d I said slowly, thinking. \u201cI don\u2019t think I ever told you about it, though; it isn\u2019t visible most of the time, so it\u2019s been years since I noticed it, myself. It\u2019s a\u2014\u201d</p><p>His hand tightening on my shoulder stopped me.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a wee brown mark, shaped like a diamond,\u201d he said. \u201cJust behind her left ear. Isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, it is.\u201d It was warm and cozy in bed, but a small coolness on the back of my neck made me shiver suddenly. \u201cDid you see that in your dream?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI kissed her there,\u201d he said softly.</p><p>22</p><p>SPARK OF AN ANCIENT FLAME</p><p>Oxford, September 1970</p><p>Oh, Jesus.\u201d Roger stared at the page in front of him until the letters lost their meaning and became no more than curlicues. No such trick would erase the meaning of the words themselves; those were already carved into his mind.</p><p>\u201cOh, God, no!\u201d he said out loud. The girl in the next carrel jerked in irritation at the noise, scraping the legs of her chair against the floor.</p><p>He leaned over the book, covering it with his forearms, eyes closed. He felt sick, and the palms of his hands were cold and sweaty.</p><p>He sat that way for several minutes, fighting the truth. It wasn\u2019t going to go away, though. Christ, it had already happened, hadn\u2019t it? A long time ago. And you couldn\u2019t change the past.</p><p>Finally he swallowed the taste of bile in the back of his throat and looked again. It was still there. A small notice from a newspaper, printed on February 13, 1776, in the American Colony of North Carolina, in the town of Wilmington.</p><p>It is with grief that the news is received of the deaths by fire of James MacKenzie Fraser and his wife, Claire Fraser, in a conflagration that destroyed their house in the settlement of Fraser\u2019s Ridge, on the night of January 21 last. Mr. Fraser, a nephew of the late Hector Cameron of River Run plantation, was born at Broch Tuarach in Scotland. He was widely known in the colony and deeply respected; he leaves no surviving children.</p><p>Except that he did.</p><p>Roger grasped for a moment at the dim hope that it wasn\u2019t them; there were, after all, any number of James Frasers, it was a fairly common name. But not James MacKenzie Fraser, not with a wife named Claire. Not born in Broch Tuarach, Scotland.</p><p>No, it was them; the sick certainty filled his chest and squeezed his throat with grief. His eyes stung and the ornate eighteenth-century typeface blurred again.</p><p>So she had found him, Claire. Found her gallant Highlander, and enjoyed at least a few years with him. He hoped they had been good years. He had liked Claire Randall very much\u2014no, that was to damn her with faint praise. If he were truthful, he had loved her, and for her own sake as well as her daughter\u2019s.</p><p>More than that. He had wanted badly for her to find her Jamie Fraser, to live happily ever after with him. The knowledge\u2014or more accurately, the hope\u2014that she had done so had been a small talisman to him; a witness that enduring love was possible, a love strong enough to withstand separation and hardship, strong enough to outlast time. And yet all flesh was mortal; no love could outlast that fact.</p><p>He gripped the edge of the table, trying to get himself under control. Foolish, he told himself. Thoroughly foolish. And yet he felt as bereft as he had when the Reverend had died; as though he were himself newly orphaned.</p><p>Realization came as a fresh blow. He couldn\u2019t show this to Bree, he couldn\u2019t. She\u2019d known the risk, of course, but\u2014no. She wouldn\u2019t have imagined anything like this.</p><p>It was the purest chance that had led him to find it. He had been looking for the lyrics of old ballads to add to his repertoire, thumbing through a book of country songs. An illustration had shown the original newspaper page on which one ballad had first been published, and Roger, idly browsing, had glanced at the archaic notices posted on the same newspaper page, his eye caught by the name \u201cFraser.\u201d</p><p>The shock was beginning to wear off a little, though grief had settled in the pit of his stomach, nagging as the pain of an ulcer. He was a scholar and the son of a scholar; he had grown up surrounded by books, imbued since childhood with the sanctity of the printed word. He felt like a murderer as he groped for his penknife and stealthily opened it, glancing around to be sure he was unobserved. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>It was instinct more than reason; the instinct that leads a man to want to clear up the remains of an accident, to lay a decent covering over the bodies, to obliterate the visible traces of disaster, even though the tragedy itself remains.</p><p>With the folded page lying hidden in his pocket like a severed thumb, he left the library, to walk the rainy streets of Oxford.</p><p>The walking calmed him, made it possible to think rationally again, to force his own feelings back long enough to plan what he must do, how to protect Brianna from a grief that would be more profound and longer felt than his own.</p><p>He had checked the bibliographic information in the front of the book; published in 1906 by a small British press. It wouldn\u2019t be widely available, then; but still something Brianna might stumble over in her own researches.</p> <p>It wasn\u2019t a logical place to look for information of the sort she was seeking, but the book was titled Songs and Ballads of the Eighteenth Century. He knew well enough that historian\u2019s curiosity that led to impulsive pokings in unlikely places; she would know enough to do that too. Still more, he knew the child\u2019s hunger for knowledge\u2014any knowledge\u2014that might lead her to look at anything dealing with the period, in an effort to imagine her parents\u2019 surroundings, to build a vision of lives she could neither see nor share.</p><p>Long odds, but not long enough. Someone jostled him in passing, and he realized that he had been leaning on the bridge railing for several minutes, watching raindrops patter on the surface of the river without seeing them. Slowly, he turned down the street, oblivious of the shops and the mushroom herds of umbrellas.</p><p>There was no way to ensure that she would never see a copy of that book; this might be the only copy, or there might be hundreds, lying like time bombs in libraries all over the U.S.</p><p>The ache in his guts was getting worse. He was soaked through by now, and freezing. Inside, he felt a deeper cold spreading from a new thought: What might Brianna do, if she found out?</p><p>She would be devastated, grief-stricken. But then? He was himself convinced that the past could not be changed; the things Claire had told him had made him sure of it. She and Jamie Fraser had tried to avert the slaughter at Culloden, to no avail. She had tried to save her future husband, Frank, by saving his ancestor, Jack Randall\u2014and failed, only to find that Jack had never been Frank\u2019s ancestor after all, but had married his younger brother\u2019s pregnant lover in order to legitimize the child when the brother died.</p> <p>No, the past might twist on itself like a writhing snake, but it could not be changed. He wasn\u2019t at all sure that Brianna shared his conviction, though.</p><p>How do you mourn a time-traveler? she\u2019d asked him. If he showed her the notice, she could mourn truly; she would know. The knowledge would wound her terribly, but she would heal, and could put the past behind her. If.</p><p>If it wasn\u2019t for the stones on Craigh na Dun. The stone circle and its dreadful promise of possibility.</p><p>Claire had gone through the stones of Craigh na Dun on the ancient fire feast of Samhain, on the first day of November, nearly two years before.</p><p>Roger shivered, and not from the cold. The hairs stood up on the back of his neck whenever he thought of it. It had been a clear, mild fall morning, that dawn of the Feast of All Saints, with nothing to disturb the grassy peace of the hill where the circle of stones stood sentinel: Nothing until Claire had touched the great cleft stone, and vanished into the past.</p><p>Then the earth had seemed to dissolve under his own feet, and the air had ripped away with a roar that echoed inside his head like cannon fire. He had gone blind in a blast of light and dark; only his memories of the last time had kept him from utter panic.</p> <p>He\u2019d had hold of Brianna\u2019s hand. Reflex closed his grip, even as all senses disappeared. It was like being dropped from a thousand feet into ice-cold water; terrible vertigo and a shock so intense, he could feel no sensation but the shock itself. Blind and deaf, bereft of sense and senses, he had been conscious of two last thoughts, the remnants of his consciousness flicking out like a candleflame in a hurricane. I\u2019m dying, he had thought, with great calmness. And then, Don\u2019t let go.</p><p>The dawning sun had fallen in a bright path through the cleft stone; Claire had walked along it. When Roger stirred at last and raised his head, the sun of late afternoon glowed gold and lavender behind the great stone, leaving it black against the sky.</p><p>He was lying on Brianna, sheltering her with his body. She was unconscious but breathing, her face desperately pale against the dark red of her hair. Weak as he was, there was no question of his being able to carry her down the steep hillside to the car below; her father\u2019s daughter, she was nearly six feet tall, only a few inches shorter than Roger himself.</p><p>He had huddled over her, holding her head in his lap, stroking her face and shivering, until just before sunset. She had opened her eyes then, as dark a blue as the fading sky, and whispered, \u201cShe\u2019s gone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right,\u201d Roger had whispered back. He bent and kissed her cold forehead. \u201cIt\u2019s all right; I\u2019ll take care of you.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d meant it. But how?</p><p>It was getting dark by the time he returned to his rooms. He could hear a clatter from the dining hall as he passed, and he smelled boiled ham and baked beans, but supper was the farthest thing from his mind.</p><p>He squelched up to his rooms and dropped his wet things in a heap on the floor. He dried himself, then sat nak*d on the bed, towel forgotten in his hand, staring at the desk and at the wooden box that held Brianna\u2019s letters.</p> <p>He would do anything to save her from grief. He would do much more to save her from the threat of the stones.</p><p>Claire had gone back\u2014he hoped\u2014from 1968 to 1766. And then died in 1776. Now it was 1970. A person going back now would\u2014might\u2014end in 1768. There would be time. That was the hell of it; there would be time.</p><p>Even if Brianna thought as he did\u2014or if he could convince her\u2014that the past could not be changed, could she live through the next seven years, knowing that the window of opportunity was closing, that her only chance ever to know her father, see her mother again, was disappearing day by day? It was one thing to let them go, not knowing where they were or what had happened to them; it was another to know explicitly, and to do nothing.</p><p>He had known Brianna for more than two years, yet been with her for only a few months of that time. And yet, they knew each other very well in some respects. How could they not, having shared such an experience? Then there had been the letters\u2014dozens, two or three or four each week\u2014and the rare brief holidays, spent between enchantment and frustration, that left him aching with need of her.</p><p>Yes, he knew her. She was quiet, but possessed of a fierce determination that he thought would not submit to grief without a fight. And while she was cautious, once her mind was made up, she acted with hair-raising dispatch. If she decided to risk the passage, he couldn\u2019t stop her.</p><p>His hands closed tight on the wadded towel, and his stomach dropped, remembering the chasm of the circle and the void that had nearly swallowed them. The only thing more terrifying was the thought of losing Brianna before he had ever truly had her.</p><p>He\u2019d never lied to her. But the impact of shock and grief was slowly receding as the rudiments of a plan formed in his mind. He stood up and wrapped the towel around his waist.</p><p>One letter wouldn\u2019t do it. It would have to be slow, a process of suggestion, of gentle discouragement. He thought it wouldn\u2019t be difficult; he had found almost nothing in a year of searching in Scotland, beyond the report of the burning of Fraser\u2019s print shop in Edinburgh\u2014he shuddered involuntarily at the thought of flames. Now he knew why, of course; they must have emigrated soon after, though he had found no trace of them on the ship\u2019s rolls he had searched.</p><p>Time to give up, he would suggest. Let the past rest\u2014and the dead bury the dead. To keep on looking, in the face of no evidence, would border on obsession. He would suggest, very subtly, that it was unhealthy, this looking back\u2014now it was time to look forward, lest she waste her life in futile searching. Neither of her parents would have wanted that.</p><p>The room was chilly, but he barely noticed.</p><p>I\u2019ll take care of you, he\u2019d said, and meant it. Was suppressing a dangerous truth the same as lying? Well, if it was, then he\u2019d lie. To give consent to do wrong was a sin, he\u2019d heard that from his early days. That was all right, he\u2019d risk his soul for her, and willingly.</p><p>He rummaged in the drawer for a pen. Then he stopped, bent, and reached two fingers into the pocket of his sopping jeans. The paper was frayed and soggy, half disintegrating already. With steady fingers, he tore it into tiny pieces, disregarding the cold sweat that ran in trickles from his face.</p><p>23</p><p>THE SKULL BENEATH THE SKIN</p><p>I had told Jamie that I didn\u2019t mind being far from civilization; wherever there were people, there would be work for a healer.</p><p>Duncan had been good as his word, returning in the spring of 1768 with eight former Ardsmuir men and their families, ready to take up homesteading on Fraser\u2019s Ridge, as the place was now known. With some thirty souls to hand, there was an immediate call on my mildly rusty services, to stitch up wounds and treat fevers, to lance abscessed boils and scrape infected gums. Two of the women were pregnant, and it was my joy to deliver healthy children, a boy and a girl, both born in early spring.</p><p>My fame\u2014if that\u2019s the word\u2014as a healer soon spread outside our tiny settlement, and I found myself called farther and farther afield, to tend the ills of folk on isolated hill farms scattered over thirty miles of wild mountain terrain. In addition, I made rare visits with Ian to Anna Ooka to see Nayawenne, returning with baskets and jars of useful herbs.</p><p>At first, Jamie had insisted that he or Ian must go with me to the farther places, but it was soon apparent that neither of them could be spared; it was time for the first planting, with ground to break and harrow, corn and barley to be planted, to say nothing of the usual chores required to keep a small farm running. In addition to the horses and mules, we had acquired a small flock of chickens, a depraved-looking black boar to meet the social needs of the pig, and\u2014luxury of luxuries\u2014a milch goat, all of whom required to be fed and watered and generally kept from killing themselves or being eaten by bears or panthers.</p><p>So more and more often I went alone when some stranger appeared suddenly in the dooryard, asking for healer or midwife. Daniel Rawlings\u2019s casebook began to acquire new entries, and the larder was enriched by the gifts of hams and venison haunches, bags of grain and bushels of apples, with which my patients repaid my attentions. I never asked for payment, but something was always offered\u2014and poor as we were, anything at all was welcome.</p><p>My backcountry patients came from many places, and many spoke neither English nor French; there were German Lutherans, Quakers, Scots and Scotch-Irish, and a large settlement of Moravian brethren at Salem, who spoke a peculiar dialect of what I thought was Czechoslovakian. I usually managed, though; in most cases, someone could interpret for me, and at the worst, I could fall back on the language of hand and body\u2014\u201cWhere does it hurt?\u201d is easy to understand in any tongue.</p><p>August 1768</p><p>I was chilled to the bone. Despite my best efforts to keep the cloak wrapped tightly round me, the wind ripped it from my body, and sent it billowing like sail canvas. It beat round the head of the boy walking next to me, and jerked me sideways in my saddle with the force of the gale. The rain drove in beneath the flapping folds like frozen needles, and I was soaked through gown and petticoats before we reached Mueller\u2019s Creek. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The creek itself was boiling past, uprooted saplings, rocks and drowned branches bubbling briefly to the surface.</p><p>Tommy Mueller peered at the torrent, shoulders hunched nearly to the brim of the slouch hat he wore pulled down over his ears. I could see doubt etched in every line of his body, and bent close to shout in his ear.</p><p>\u201cStay here!\u201d I bellowed, pitching my voice below the shriek of the wind.</p><p>He shook his head, mouthing something at me, but I couldn\u2019t hear. I shook my own head vigorously, and pointed up the bank; the muddy soil was crumbly here; I could see small chunks of the black dirt melt away even as I watched.</p> <p>\u201cGet back!\u201d I shouted.</p><p>He pointed emphatically himself\u2014back in the direction of the farmhouse\u2014and reached for my reins. Clearly he thought it was too dangerous; he wanted me to come back to the house, to wait out the storm.</p><p>He definitely had a point. On the other hand, I could see the stream widening, even as I watched, the ravenous water eating away the soft bank in gobbets and chunks. Wait much longer, and no one could cross\u2014neither would it be safe for days after; floods like this kept the water high for as long as a week, as the rains from higher up the mountain trickled down to feed the torrents.</p><p>The thought of being cooped up in a four-room house for a week with all ten Muellers was enough to spur me to recklessness. Pulling the reins from Tommy\u2019s grasp, I wheeled about, the horse tossing its head against the rain, stepping carefully on the slick mud.</p><p>We reached the upper slopes of the bank, where a layer of thick dead leaves gave better footing. I turned the horse, motioned Tommy back out of the way, and leaned forward like a steeplechaser, elbows digging into the bag of barley bound over the saddle in front of me\u2014my payment for services rendered.</p> <p>The shift of my weight was enough; the horse was no more anxious to hang about here than I was. I felt the sudden thrust as the hindquarters dropped and bunched, and then we were flying down the slope like a runaway toboggan. A jolt and a moment of giddy freefall, then a resounding splash, and I was up past my thighs in freezing water.</p><p>My hands were so cold, they might as well have been welded to the reins, but I had nothing useful to offer in terms of guidance. I let my arms go slack, giving the horse his head. I could feel huge muscles moving rhythmically under my legs as it swam, and the even more powerful shove of the water rushing past us. It dragged at my skirts, threatening to pull me off into the surge.</p><p>Then came the jar and scrabble of hooves against the stream bottom, and we were out, pouring water like a colander. I turned in the saddle, to see Tommy Mueller on the other side, his jaw hanging open under his hat. I couldn\u2019t let go of the reins to wave, but bowed toward him ceremoniously, then nudged the horse with my heels and turned toward home.</p><p>The hood of my cloak had fallen back when we jumped, but it made no great difference; I couldn\u2019t get much wetter. I knuckled a wet strand of hair out of my eyes and turned the horse\u2019s head toward the upland trail, relieved to be headed home, rain or no.</p><p>I had been at the Muellers\u2019 cabin for three days, seeing eighteen-year-old Petronella through her first labor. It would be her last, too, according to Petronella. Her seventeen-year-old husband, peeking tentatively into the room in the middle of the second day, had received a burst of German invective from Petronella that sent him stumping back to the men\u2019s refuge in the barn, ears bright red with mortification.</p><p>Still, a few hours later, I had seen Freddy\u2014looking much younger than seventeen\u2014kneel tentatively by his wife\u2019s bedside, face whiter than her shift as he reached a hesitant, scrubbed finger to push aside the blanket covering his daughter.</p> <p>He stared dumbly at the round head, furred with soft black, then looked at his wife, as though in need of prompting.</p><p>\u201cIst sie nicht wundersch\u00f6n?\u201d Petronella said softly.</p><p>He nodded, slowly, then laid his head on her lap and began to cry. The women had all smiled kindly, and gone back to fixing dinner.</p><p>It had been a good dinner, too; the food was one of the benefits of house calls to the Muellers. Even now, my stomach was comfortably distended with dumplings and fried Blutwurst, and the lingering taste of buttered eggs in my mouth provided some small distraction from the general discomfort of my present situation.</p><p>I hoped that Jamie and Ian had managed something adequate to eat in my absence. This being the end of summer but not yet harvest time, the pantry shelves were nowhere near the height of what I hoped would be their autumn bounty, but still there were cheeses on the shelf, a huge stoneware crock of salted fish on the floor, and sacks of flour, corn, rice, beans, barley, and oatmeal.</p><p>Jamie could in fact cook\u2014at least so far as dressing game and roasting it over a fire\u2014and I had done my best to initiate Ian into the mysteries of making oatmeal parritch, but, they being men, I suspected that they hadn\u2019t bothered, choosing instead to survive on raw onions and dried meat.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t tell whether it was simply that after a day spent in the manly pursuits of chopping down trees, plowing fields, and carrying deer carcasses over mountains, they honestly were too exhausted to think of assembling a proper meal, or whether they did it on purpose, so that I would feel necessary.</p><p>The wind had dropped, now that I was in the shelter of the ridge, but the rain was still pelting down, and the footing was treacherous, as the mud of the trail had liquified, leaving a layer of fallen leaves floating on top, deceptive as quicksand. I could feel the horse\u2019s discomfort as its hooves slipped with each step.</p> <p>\u201cGood boy,\u201d I said soothingly. \u201cKeep it up, that\u2019s a good fellow.\u201d The horse\u2019s ears pricked slightly, but he kept his head down, stepping carefully.</p><p>\u201cSlewfoot?\u201d I said. \u201cHow\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>The horse had no name at the moment\u2014or rather he did, but I didn\u2019t know what it was. The man from whom Jamie had bought him had called him by a German word that Jamie said was not at all suitable for a lady\u2019s horse. When I had asked him to translate the word, he had merely compressed his lips and looked Scottish, from which I deduced that it must be pretty bad. I had meant to ask old Mrs. Mueller what it meant, but had forgotten, in the haste of leaving.</p><p>In any case, Jamie\u2019s theory was that the horse would reveal his true\u2014or at least speakable\u2014name in the course of time, and so we were all watching the animal, in hopes of discerning its character. On the basis of a trial ride, Ian had suggested Coney, but Jamie had merely shaken his head and said, no, that wasn\u2019t it.</p><p>\u201cTwinkletoes?\u201d I suggested. \u201cLightfoot? Damn!\u201d</p><p>The horse had come to a full stop, for obvious reasons. A small freshet gurgled merrily down the hill, bounding from rock to rock with g*y abandon. It was beautiful, the rushing water clear as crystal over dark rock and green leaves. Unfortunately, it was also bounding over the remains of the trail, which, unequal to the force of events, had slithered off the face of the hill into the valley below.</p><p>I sat still, dripping. There wasn\u2019t any way around. The hill rose nearly perpendicularly on my right, shrubs and saplings poking out of a cracked rock face, and declined so precipitously to the left that going down would have amounted to suicide. Swearing under my breath, I backed the nameless horse and turned around.</p><p>If it hadn\u2019t been for the flooded creek, I would have gone back to the Muellers and let Jamie and Ian fend for themselves a bit longer. As it was, I had no choice; it was find another way home or stay here and drown.</p><p>Wearily, we retraced our slogging steps. Less than a quarter-mile from the washout, though, I found a spot where the hillside fell away into a small saddle, a depression between two \u201chorns\u201d of granite. Such formations were common; there was a big one on a nearby mountain, which had gained it the name of Devil\u2019s Peak. If I could cross the saddle to the other side of the hill, and pick my way along it, I would in time come back to the trail where it crossed the ridge to the south.</p><p>From the saddle I had a momentary clear view of the foothills, and the blue hollow of the valley beyond. On the other side, though, clouds hid the tops of the mountains, black with rain, suffused with an occasional flicker of hidden lightning.</p><p>The wind had dropped, now that the leading edge of the storm had passed. The rain was coming down even more heavily, if such a thing was possible, and I stopped long enough to pry my cold fingers off the reins and put up the hood of my cloak.</p><p>The footing on this side of the hill was fair, the ground being rocky but not too steep. We picked our way through small groves of red-berried mountain ash and larger stands of oak. I noted the location of a huge blackberry bramble for future reference, but didn\u2019t stop. I would be lucky to get home by dark as it was.</p><p>To distract myself from the cold trickles running down my neck, I began an mental inventory of the pantry. What could I make for dinner, once I arrived?</p><p>Something quick, I thought, shivering, and something hot. Stew would take too long; so would soup. If there was squirrel or rabbit, we might have it fried, rolled in egg and cornmeal batter. Or if not that, perhaps brose with a little bacon for flavoring, and a couple of scrambled eggs with green onions.</p><p>I ducked, wincing. Despite the hood and the thickness of my hair, the raindrops were beating on my scalp like hail pellets.</p><p>Then I realized that they were hail pellets. Tiny white spheres pinged off the horse\u2019s back, and rattled through the oak leaves. Within seconds, the pellets were bigger, the size of marbles, and the hail had grown heavy enough that its popping sounded like machine-gun fire on the wet mats of leaves in the clearings.</p><p>The horse flung up its head, shaking its mane vigorously in an effort to escape the stinging pellets. Hastily, I reined in and guided it into the semi-shelter of a huge chestnut tree. Underneath, it was noisy, but the hail slid off the thick canopy of leaves, leaving us protected.</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d I said. With some difficulty, I pried one hand off the reins and gave the horse a reassuring pat. \u201cEasy, then. We\u2019ll be all right, as long as we don\u2019t get struck by lightning.\u201d</p><p>Evidently this statement had jogged someone\u2019s memory; a silent fork of dazzling light split the black sky beyond Roan Mountain. A few moments later, the dull rumble of thunder came booming up the hollow, drowning out the rasp of hail on the leaves overhead.</p><p>Sheet lightning shimmered far away, across the mountains. Then more bolts, sizzling across the sky, each succeeded by a louder roll of thunder. The hailstorm passed, and the rain resumed, pelting down as hard as ever. The valley below disappeared in cloud and mist, but the lightning lit the stark mountain ridges like bones on an X ray.</p><p>\u201cOne hippopotamus, two hippopotamus, three hippopotamus, four hippopot\u2014\u201d BWOOOM! The horse jerked its head and stamped nervously.</p><p>\u201cI know just how you feel,\u201d I told it, peering down the valley. \u201cSteady, though, steady.\u201d There it went again, a flash that lit the dark ridge and left the silhouette of the horse\u2019s pricked ears imprinted on my retinas.</p><p>\u201cOne hippopotamus, two hippo\u2014\u201d I could have sworn the ground shook. The horse let out a high-pitched scream and reared against my pull on the reins, hooves thrashing in the leaves. The air reeked of ozone.</p><p>Flash. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOne,\u201d I said through my teeth. \u201cDamn you, whoa!

One moment I was sawing at the reins, a thousand pounds of panicked horse going to pieces under me, shying in all directions. The next, I was lying on my back, blinking up at a spinning black sky, trying to will my diaphragm to work.</p><p>Echoes of the shock of impact wavered through my flesh, and I tried frantically to fit myself back into my body. Then I drew breath, a painful gasp, and found myself shaking, the shock turning to the first intimations of damage.</p><p>I lay still, eyes closed, concentrating on breathing, conducting an inventory. The rain was still pounding down onto my face, puddling in my eye sockets and running down into my ears. My face and hands were numb. My arms moved. I could breathe a little easier now.</p><p>My legs. The left one hurt, but not in any threatening way; only a bruised knee. I rolled heavily onto my side, impeded by my wet, bulky garments. Still, it was the heavy clothing that had saved me from serious damage.</p> <p>Above me came an uncertain whinny, audible amid the booming thunder. I looked up, dizzy, and saw the horse\u2019s head, protruding from a thicket of buckbrush some thirty feet overhead. Below the thicket, a steep, rocky slope fell away; a long scrape mark toward the bottom showed where I had struck and rolled before ending up in my present position.</p><p>We had been standing virtually on the edge of this small precipice without my seeing it, screened as it was by the heavy growth of shrubs. The horse\u2019s panic had sent it to the edge, but evidently it had sensed the danger and caught itself before going over\u2014not before letting me slide off into space, though.</p><p>\u201cYou bloody bugger!\u201d I said. And wondered whether the unknown German name meant something similar. \u201cI could have broken my neck!\u201d I wiped the mud from my face with a hand that still shook, and looked about me for a way back up.</p><p>There wasn\u2019t one. Behind me, the rocky cliff face continued, merging into one of the granite horns. Before me, it ended abruptly, in a plunge straight downward into a small hollow. The slope I stood on declined into this hollow as well, rolling down through clumps of yellow-wood and sumac to the banks of a small creek some sixty feet below.</p><p>I stood quite still, trying to think. No one knew where I was. I didn\u2019t know exactly where I was, come to that. Worse, no one would be looking for me for some time. Jamie would think I was still at Muellers\u2019 because of the rain. The Muellers would of course have no reason to think I hadn\u2019t made it safely home; even if they had doubts, they couldn\u2019t follow me, because of the flooded creek. And by the time anyone found the washed-out trail, any traces of my passage would long since have been obliterated by the rain.</p><p>I was uninjured, that was something. I was also afoot, alone, without food, moderately lost, and thoroughly wet. About the only certainty was that I wasn\u2019t going to die of thirst.</p> <p>The lightning was still glancing to and fro like dueling pitchforks in the sky above, though the thunder had faded to a dull rumble in the distance. I had no particular fear of being struck by lightning now\u2014not with so many better candidates standing about, in the form of gigantic trees\u2014but finding shelter seemed a very good idea nonetheless.</p><p>It was still raining; drops rolled off the end of my nose with monotonous regularity. Limping on my bruised knee and swearing quite a bit, I made my way down the slippery slope to the edge of the stream.</p><p>This creek, too, was swollen by the rain; I could see the tops of drowned bushes sticking out of the water, leaves trailing limply in the rushing current. There was no bank to speak of; I fought my way through the grasping claws of holly and red-cedar toward the rocky cliff-face to the south; perhaps there would be a cave or hollow there that would offer shelter of a sort.</p><p>I found nothing but tumbled rocks, black with wet and hard to navigate. Some distance beyond, though, I saw something else that offered a small possibility of shelter.</p><p>A huge red cedar tree had fallen across the stream, its roots undermined as the water ate away the soil in which it stood. It had fallen away from me and struck the cliff, so that the thick crown sprawled into the water and over the rocks, the trunk canted across the stream at a shallow angle; on my side, I could see the huge mat of its exposed roots, a bulwark of cracked earth and small bushes heaved up about them. The cavity under them might not be complete shelter, but it looked better than standing in the open or crouching in the bushes.</p><p>I hadn\u2019t even paused to think that the shelter might have attracted bears, catamounts, or other unfriendly fauna. Fortunately, it hadn\u2019t.</p><p>It was a space about five feet long and five wide, dank, dark, and clammy. The ceiling was composed of the tree\u2019s great gnarled roots, packed with sandy earth, like the roof of a badger\u2019s sett. But it was a solid ceiling, for all that; the floor of churned earth was damp but not muddy, and for the first time in hours rain was not drumming on my skull.</p><p>Exhausted, I crawled into the farthest corner, set my wet shoes beside me, and went to sleep. The cold of my wet clothes made me dream vividly, in jumbled visions of blood and childbirth, trees and rocks and rain, and I woke frequently, in that half-conscious way of utter tiredness, falling asleep again in seconds.</p> <p>I dreamt that I was giving birth. I felt no pain, but saw the emerging head as though I stood between my own thighs, midwife and mother both together. I took the nak*d child in my arms, still smeared with the blood that came from both of us, and gave her to her father. I gave her to Frank, but it was Jamie who took the caul from her face and said, \u201cShe\u2019s beautiful.\u201d</p><p>Then I woke and slept, finding my way among boulders and waterfalls, urgently seeking something I had lost. Woke and slept, pursued through woods by something fearsome and unknown. Woke and slept, a knife in my hand, red with blood\u2014but whose, I did not know.</p><p>I woke all the way to the smell of burning, and sat bolt upright. The rain had stopped; it was the silence that wakened me, I thought. The smell of smoke was still strong in my nostrils, though\u2014it wasn\u2019t part of the dream.</p><p>I poked my head out of my burrow like a snail cautiously emerging from its shell. The sky was a pale purple-gray, shot with streaks of orange over the mountains. The woods around me were still, and dripping. It was nearly sundown, and darkness was gathering in the hollows.</p><p>I crawled out all the way, and looked around. The creek at my back rushed past in full spate, its gurgling the only sound. The ground rose in front of me to a small ridge. At the top of this stood a large balsam poplar tree, the source of the smoke. The tree had been struck by lightning; half of it still bore green leaves, the canopy bushy against the pale sky. The other half was blackened and charred all down one side of the massive trunk. Wisps of white smoke rose from it like ghosts escaping an enchanter\u2019s bondage, and red lines of fire showed fleetingly, glowing beneath the blackened shell.</p><p>I looked about for my shoes, but couldn\u2019t find them in the shadows. Not bothering, I made my way up the ridge toward the blasted tree, panting with effort. All my muscles were stiffened with sleep and cold; I felt like a tree come awkwardly to life myself, stumping uphill on gnarled and clumsy roots.</p><p>It was warm near the tree. Blissfully, wonderfully warm. The air smelled of ash and burnt soot, but it was warm. I stood as close as I dared, spreading my cloak out wide, and stood still, steaming.</p><p>For some time I didn\u2019t even try to think; just stood there, feeling my chilled flesh thaw and soften again into something resembling humanity. But as my blood began to flow again, my bruises began to ache, and I felt the deeper ache of hunger as well; it had been a long time since breakfast.</p><p>Likely to be a lot longer time till supper, I thought grimly. The dark was creeping up from the hollow, and I was still lost. I glanced across to the opposite ridge; not a sign of the bloody horse.</p><p>\u201cTraitor,\u201d I muttered. \u201cProbably gone off to join a herd of elk or something.\u201d</p><p>I chafed my hands together; my clothes were halfway dry, but the temperature was dropping; it would be a chilly night. Would it be better to spend the night here, in the open, near the blasted tree, or ought I to return to my burrow while I could still see to do so?</p><p>A snapping in the brush behind me decided me. The tree had cooled now; though the charred wood was still hot to the touch, the fire had burned out. It would be no deterrent to prowling night hunters. Lacking fire or weapons, my only defense was that of the hunted; lie hidden through the dark hours, like the mice and rabbits. Well, I had to go back to fetch my shoes anyway.</p><p>Reluctantly leaving the last vestiges of warmth, I made my way back down to the fallen tree. Crawling in, I saw a pale blur against the darker earth in the corner. I set my hand on it, and found not the softness of my buckskin moccasins, but something hard and smooth.</p><p>My instincts had grasped the reality of the object before my brain could retrieve the word, and I snatched my hand away. I sat for a moment, my heart pounding. Then curiosity overcame atavistic fear, and I began to scoop away the sandy loam around it.</p><p>It was indeed a skull, complete with lower jaw, though the mandible was attached only by the remnants of dried ligament. A fragment of broken vertebra rattled in the foramen magnum.</p><p>\u201c \u2018How long will a man lie i\u2019 the earth ere he rot?\u2019 \u201d I murmured, turning the skull over in my hands. The bone was cold and damp, slightly roughened by exposure to the damp. The light was too dim to see details, but I could feel the heavy ridges over the brows, and the slickness of smooth enamel on the canines. Likely a man, and not an old one; most of the teeth were present, and not unduly worn\u2014at least insofar as I could tell with a groping thumb.</p><p>How long? Eight or nine year, the grave-digger said to Hamlet. I had no notion whether Shakespeare knew anything about forensics, but it seemed a reasonable estimate to me. Longer than nine years, then.</p><p>How had he come here? By violence, my instincts answered, though my brain was not far behind. An explorer might die of disease, hunger or exposure\u2014I firmly suppressed that line of thought, trying to ignore my growling stomach and damp clothes\u2014but he wouldn\u2019t end up buried under a tree.</p><p>The Cherokee and Tuscarora buried their dead, all right, but not like this, alone in a hollow. And not in fragments, either. It was that broken bit of vertebra that had told me the story at once; the edges were compressed, the broken face sheared clean, not shattered.</p><p>\u201cSomebody took a real dislike to you, didn\u2019t they?\u201d I said. \u201cDidn\u2019t stop with a scalp; they took your whole head.\u201d</p><p>Which made me wonder\u2014was the rest of him here, too? I rubbed a hand across my face, thinking, but after all, I had nothing better to do; I wasn\u2019t going anywhere before daylight, and the likelihood of sleep had grown remote with the discovery of my companion. I set the skull carefully to one side, and began to dig.</p><p>It was fully night by now, but even the darkest of nights outdoors is seldom completely without light. The sky was still covered with cloud, which reflected considerable light, even in my shallow burrow.</p><p>The sandy earth was soft, and easy to dig in, but after a few minutes of scratching, my knuckles and fingertips were rubbed raw, and I crawled outside, long enough to find a stick to dig with. A little more probing yielded me something hard; not bone, I thought, and not metal, either. Stone, I decided, fingering the dark oval. Just a river stone? I thought not; the surface was very smooth, but with something incised in it; a glyph of some kind, though my touch was not sufficiently sensitive to tell me what it was. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>More digging yielded nothing. Either the rest of Yorick wasn\u2019t here, or it was buried so far down that I had no chance of discovering it. I put the stone in my pocket, sat back on my heels, and rubbed my sandy hands on my skirts. At least the exercise had warmed me again.</p><p>I sat down again and picked up the skull, holding it in my lap. Gruesome as it was, it was the semblance of company, some distraction from my own plight. And I was quite aware that all my actions of the last hour or so had been distractions; designed to fight off the panic that I could feel submerged below the surface of my mind, waiting to erupt like the sharp end of a drowned tree branch. It was going to be a long night.</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d I said aloud to the skull. \u201cRead any good books lately? No, I suppose you don\u2019t get round much anymore. Poetry, maybe?\u201d I cleared my throat and started in on Keats, warming up with \u201cWritten in Disgust of Vulgar Superstition\u201d and going on with \u201cOde on a Grecian Urn.\u201d</p><p>\u201c \u2018...Forever wilt thou love, and she be fair!\u2019 \u201d I declaimed. \u201cThere\u2019s more of that one, but I forget. Not too bad, though, was it? Want to try a little Shelley? \u2018Ode to the West Wind\u2019 is good\u2014you\u2019d like that one, I think.\u201d</p> <p>It occurred to me to wonder why I thought so; I had no particular reason to think Yorick was an Indian rather than a European, but I realized that I did think so\u2014perhaps it was the stone I had found with him. Shrugging, I set in again, trusting that the repellent effect of great English poetry would be the equal of a campfire, so far as the bears and panthers were concerned.</p><p>\u201cMake me thy lyre, even as the forest is:</p><p>What if my leaves are falling like its own!</p><p>The tumult of thy mighty harmonies</p><p>Will take from both a deep, autumnal tone,</p> <p>Sweet though in sadness. Be thou, Spirit fierce,</p><p>My spirit! Be thou me, impetuous one!</p><p>\u201cDrive my dead thoughts over the universe</p><p>Like wither\u2019d leaves to quicken a new birth;</p><p>And, by the incantation of this verse,</p><p>\u201cScatter, as from an unextinguish\u2019d hearth</p> <p>Ashes and sparks, my words among mankind!</p><p>Be through my lips to unawaken\u2019d earth</p><p>\u201cThe trumpet of a prophecy! O Wind...\u201d</p><p>The final stanza faded on my lips. There was a light on the ridge. A small spark, growing to a flame. At first I thought it was the lightning-blasted tree, some smoldering ember come to life\u2014but then it moved. It glided slowly down the hill toward me, floating just above the bushes.</p><p>I sprang to my feet, realizing only then that I had no shoes on. Frantically, I groped about the floor, covering the small space again and again. But it was no use. My shoes were gone.</p><p>I seized the skull and stood barefoot, turning to face the light.</p><p>I watched the light come nearer, drifting down the hill like a milkweed puff. One thought floated in my paralyzed mind\u2014a random line of Shelley\u2019s: Fiend, I defy thee! with a calm, fixed mind. Somewhere in the dimmer recesses of my consciousness, something observed that Shelley had had much better nerves than I. I clutched the skull closer. It wasn\u2019t much of a weapon\u2014but somehow I didn\u2019t think that whatever was coming would be deterred by knives or pistols, either.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t only that the wet surroundings made it seem grossly improbable that anyone was strolling through the woods with a blazing torch. The light didn\u2019t burn like a pine torch or oil lantern. It didn\u2019t flicker, but burned with a soft, steady glow.</p> <p>It floated a few feet above the ground, just about where someone would hold a torch they carried before them. It drew slowly nearer, at the pace of a man walking. I could see it bob slightly, moving to the rhythm of a steady stride.</p><p>I cowered in my burrow, half hidden by the bank of earth and severed roots. I was freezing cold, but sweat ran down my sides and I could smell the reek of my own fear. My numb toes curled in the dirt, wanting to run.</p><p>I had seen St. Elmo\u2019s fire before, at sea. Eerie as that was, its liquid blue crackle didn\u2019t resemble at all the pale light approaching. This had neither spark nor color; only a spectral glow. Marsh gas, people in Cross Creek said when the mountain lights were mentioned.</p><p>Ha, I said to myself, though soundlessly. Marsh gas my left foot!</p><p>The light moved through a small thicket of alders, and out into the clearing before me. It wasn\u2019t marsh gas.</p><p>He was tall, and he was nak*d. Beyond a breechclout, he wore nothing but paint; long stripes of red down arms and legs and torso, and his face was solid black, from chin to forehead. His hair was greased and dressed in a crest, from which two turkey feathers stiffly pointed.</p><p>I was invisible, completely hidden in the darkness of my refuge, while the torch he held washed him in soft light, gleaming off his hairless chest and shoulders, shadowing the orbits of his eyes. But he knew I was there.</p><p>I didn\u2019t dare to move. My breath sounded painfully loud in my ears. He simply stood there, perhaps a dozen feet away, and looked straight into the dark where I was, as though it were the broadest day. And the light of his torch burned steady and soundless, pallid as a corpse candle, the wood of it not consumed.</p><p>I don\u2019t know how long I had been standing there before it occurred to me that I was no longer afraid. I was still cold, but my heart had slowed to its normal pace, and my bare toes had uncurled.</p><p>\u201cWhatever do you want?\u201d I said, and only then realized that we had been in some sort of communication for some time. Whatever this was, it had no words. Nothing coherent passed between us\u2014but something passed, nonetheless.</p><p>The clouds had lifted, shredding away before a light wind, and dark streaks of starlit sky showed through rents in the racing cirrus. The wood was quiet, but in the usual way of a drenched night-wood; the creaks and sighs of tall trees moving, the rustle of shrubs brushed by the wind\u2019s restless edge, and in the background the constant rush of invisible water, echoing the turbulence of the air above.</p><p>I breathed deeply, feeling suddenly very much alive. The air was thick and sweet with the breath of green plants, the tang of herbs and musk of dead leaves, overlaid and interlaced with the scents of the storm\u2014wet rock, damp earth, and rising mist, and a sharp hint of ozone, sudden as the lightning that had struck the tree.</p><p>Earth and air, I thought suddenly, and fire and water too. And here I stood with all the elements; in their midst and at their mercy.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d I said again, feeling helpless. \u201cI can\u2019t do anything for you. I know you\u2019re there; I can see you. But that\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>Nothing moved, no words were spoken. But quite clearly the thought formed in my mind, in a voice that was not my own.</p><p>That\u2019s enough, it said.</p><p>Without haste, he turned and walked away. By the time he had gone two dozen paces, the light of his torch disappeared, fading into nonexistence like the final glow of twilight into night.</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d I said, a little blankly. \u201cGoodness.\u201d My legs were trembling, and I sat down, the skull\u2014which I had almost forgotten\u2014cradled in my lap.</p><p>I sat there for a long time, watching and listening, but nothing further happened. The mountains surrounded me, dark and impenetrable. Perhaps in the morning, I could find my way back to the trail, but for now, wandering about in darkness could lead to nothing but disaster.</p><p>I was no longer afraid; my fear had left me during my encounter with\u2014whatever it was. I was still cold, though, and very, very hungry. I put down the skull and curled myself up beside it, pulling my damp cloak around me. It took a long time to fall asleep, and I lay in my chilly burrow watching the evening stars wheel overhead through rifts in the cloud.</p><p>I tried to make sense of the last half hour, but there was really nothing to make sense of; nothing, really, had happened. And yet it had; he had been there. The sense of him remained with me, somehow vaguely comforting, and at last I fell asleep, cheek pillowed on a clump of dead leaves.</p><p>I dreamt uneasily, because of cold and hunger; a procession of disjoint images. Lightning-blasted trees, blazing like torches. Trees uprooted from the earth, walking on their roots with a dreadful lurching gait.</p><p>Lying in the rain with my throat cut, warm blood pulsing down across my chest, a queer comfort to my chilling flesh. My fingers numb, unable to move. The rain striking my skin like hail, each cold drop a hammer blow, and then the rain itself seemed warm, and soft upon my face. Buried alive, black soil showering down into open eyes.</p><p>I woke, heart pounding. Lay silent. It was deep night now; the sky stretched clear and endless overhead, and I lay in a bowl of darkness. After a time, I slept again, pursued by dreams.</p><p>Wolves howling in the distance. Fleeing panicked through a forest of white aspen that stood in snow, the trees\u2019 red sap glowing like bloody jewels on white-paper trunks. A man standing in the bleeding trees with his head plucked bald, save a standing crest of black, greased hair. He had deep eyes and a shattered smile, and the blood on his breast was brighter than the tree sap.</p><p>Wolves, much closer. Howling and barking and the scent of blood hot in my own nose, running with the pack, running from the pack. Running. Harefooted, white-toothed, and the ghost of blood a taste in my mouth, a tingle in my nose. Hunger. Chase and catch and kill and blood. Heart hammering, blood racing, sheer panic of the hunted.</p><p>I felt my armbone crack with a noise like a dry branch snapping, and tasted marrow warm and salty, slippery on my tongue.</p><p>Something brushed my face and I opened my eyes. Great yellow eyes stared into mine, from the dark ruff of a white-toothed wolf. I screamed and struck at it and the beast started back with a startled \u201cWoof!\u201d</p><p>I floundered to my knees and crouched there, gibbering. It had just gone daybreak. The dawning light was new and tender, and showed me plainly the huge black outline of...Rollo.</p><p>\u201cOh, Jesus God, what the bloody hell are you doing here, frigging bloody horrible...filthy beast!\u201d I might eventually have gotten a grip on myself, but Jamie got one first.</p><p>Big hands pulled me up and out of my hiding place, held me tight and patted me anxiously, checking for damage. The wool of his plaid was soft against my face; it smelt of wet and lye soap and his own male scent and I breathed it in like oxygen.</p><p>\u201cAre ye all right? For God\u2019s sake, Sassenach, are ye all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I said. \u201cYes,\u201d I said, and started to cry.</p><p>It didn\u2019t last long; it was no more than the shock of relief. I tried to say as much, but Jamie wasn\u2019t listening. He scooped me up in his arms, filthy as I was, and began to carry me toward the small stream.</p><p>\u201cHush, then,\u201d he said, squeezing me tightly against him. \u201cHush, mo chridhe. It\u2019s all right now; you\u2019re safe.\u201d</p><p>I was still fuddled with cold and dreams. Alone so long with no voice but my own, his sounded odd, unreal and hard to understand. The warm solidness of his grasp was real, though.</p><p>\u201cWait,\u201d I said, tugging feebly at his shirt. \u201cWait, I forgot. I have to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus, Uncle Jamie, look at this!\u201d</p><p>Jamie turned, holding me. Young Ian was standing in the mouth of my refuge, framed in dangling roots, holding up the skull.</p><p>I felt Jamie\u2019s muscles tighten as he saw it.</p><p>\u201cHoly God, Sassenach, what\u2019s that?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWho, you mean,\u201d I said. \u201cI don\u2019t know. Nice chap, though. Don\u2019t let Rollo at him; he wouldn\u2019t like it.\u201d Rollo was sniffing the skull with intense concentration, wet black nostrils flaring with interest.</p><p>Jamie peered down into my face, frowning slightly.</p><p>\u201cAre ye sure you\u2019re quite all right, Sassenach?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I said, though in fact my wits were coming back as I woke up all the way. \u201cI\u2019m cold and I\u2019m starving. You didn\u2019t happen to bring any breakfast, did you?\u201d I asked longingly. \u201cI could murder a plateful of eggs.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said, setting me down while he groped in his sporran. \u201cI hadna time to trouble for food, but I\u2019ve got some brandywine. Here, Sassenach; it\u2019ll do you good. And then,\u201d he added, raising one eyebrow, \u201cyou can tell me how the devil ye came to be out in the middle of nowhere, aye?\u201d</p><p>I collapsed on a rock and sipped the brandywine gratefully. The flask trembled in my hands, but the shivering began to ease as the dark amber stuff made its way directly through the walls of my empty stomach and into my bloodstream.</p><p>Jamie stood behind me, his hand on my shoulder.</p><p>\u201cHow long have ye been here, Sassenach?\u201d he asked, his voice gentle.</p><p>\u201cAll night,\u201d I said, shivering again. \u201cSince just before noon yesterday, when the bloody horse\u2014I think his name\u2019s Judas\u2014dropped me off that ledge up there.\u201d</p> <p>I nodded at the ledge. The middle of nowhere was a good description of the place, I thought. It could have been any of a thousand anonymous hollows in these hills. A thought struck me\u2014one that should have occurred to me long before, had I not been so chilled and groggy.</p><p>\u201cHow the hell did you find me?\u201d I asked. \u201cDid one of the Muellers follow me, or\u2014don\u2019t tell me the bloody horse led you to me, like Lassie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a gelding, Auntie,\u201d Ian put in reprovingly. \u201cNo a lassie. But we havena seen your horse at all. No, Rollo led us to ye.\u201d He beamed proudly at the dog, who contrived to look blandly dignified, as though he did this sort of thing all the time.</p><p>\u201cBut if you haven\u2019t seen the horse,\u201d I began, bewildered, \u201chow did you even know I\u2019d left Muellers\u2019? And how could Rollo\u2014\u201d I broke off, seeing the two men eyeing each other.</p><p>Ian shrugged slightly and nodded, yielding to Jamie. Jamie hunkered down on the ground beside me, and lifting the hem of my dress, took my bare feet into his big, warm hands.</p><p>\u201cYour feet are frozen, Sassenach,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cWhere did ye lose your shoes?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBack there,\u201d I said, with a nod toward the uprooted tree. \u201cThey must still be there. I took them off to cross a stream, then put them down and couldn\u2019t find them in the dark.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re not there, Auntie,\u201d said Ian. He sounded so queer that I looked up at him in surprise. He was still holding the skull, turning it gingerly over in his hands.</p><p>\u201cNo, they\u2019re not.\u201d Jamie\u2019s head was bent as he chafed my feet, and I could see the early light glint copper off his hair, which lay tumbled loose over his shoulders, disheveled as though he had just risen from his bed.</p><p>\u201cI was in bed, asleep,\u201d he said, echoing my thought. \u201cWhen yon beast suddenly went mad.\u201d He jerked his chin at Rollo, without looking up. \u201cBarking and howling and flingin\u2019 his carcass at the door as though the Devil was outside.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI shouted at him, and tried to get hold of his scruff and shake him quiet,\u201d Ian put in, \u201cbut he wouldna stop, no matter what I did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, he carried on so that the spittle flew from his jaws and I was sure he\u2019d gone truly mad. I thought he\u2019d do us an injury, so I bade Ian unbolt the door and let him be gone.\u201d Jamie sat back on his heels and frowned at my foot, then picked a dead leaf off my instep.</p><p>\u201cWell, and was the Devil outside?\u201d I asked flippantly.</p><p>Jamie shook his head.</p> <p>\u201cWe searched the clearing, from the penfold to the spring, and didna find a thing\u2014except these.\u201d He reached into his sporran and drew out my shoes. He looked up into my face, his own quite expressionless.</p><p>\u201cThey were sitting on the doorstep, side by side.\u201d</p><p>Every hair on my body rose. I lifted the flask and drained the last of the brandywine.</p><p>\u201cRollo tore off, bayin\u2019 like a hound,\u201d Ian said, eagerly taking up the story. \u201cBut then he came back a moment later, and began to sniff at your shoes and whinge and cry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI felt rather like doing that myself, aye?\u201d Jamie\u2019s mouth lifted slightly at one corner, but I could see the fear still dark in his eyes.</p><p>I swallowed, but my mouth was too dry to talk, despite the brandywine.</p><p>Jamie slipped one shoe onto my foot, and then the other. They were damp, but faintly warm from his body.</p><p>\u201cI did think ye were maybe dead, Cinderella,\u201d he said softly, head bent to hide his face.</p><p>Ian didn\u2019t notice, caught up in the enthusiasm of the story.</p><p>\u201cMy clever wee dog was for dashing off, the same as when he\u2019s smelt a rabbit, so we caught up our plaids and came away after him, only stopping to snatch a brand from the hearth and smoor the fire. He led us a good chase, too, did ye no, laddie?\u201d He rubbed Rollo\u2019s ears with affectionate pride. \u201cAnd here ye were!\u201d</p><p>The brandywine was buzzing in my ears, swaddling my wits in a warm, sweet blanket, but I had enough sense left to tell me that for Rollo to have followed a trail back to me...someone had walked all that way in my shoes.</p><p>I had recovered some remnants of my voice by this time, and managed to talk with only a little hoarseness.</p><p>\u201cDid you\u2014see anything\u2014along the way?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cNo, Auntie,\u201d Ian said, suddenly sober. \u201cDid you?\u201d</p><p>Jamie lifted his head, and I could see how worry and exhaustion had hollowed his face, leaving the broad cheekbones sharp beneath his skin. I wasn\u2019t the only one who had had a long, hard night.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I said, \u201cbut I\u2019ll tell you later. Right now, I believe I\u2019ve turned into a pumpkin. Let\u2019s go home.\u201d</p><p>Jamie had brought horses, but there was no way to get them down into the hollow; we were forced to make our way down the banks of the flooded stream, splashing through the shallows, then to clamber laboriously up a rocky slope to the ledge above, where the animals were tethered. Rubber-legged and flimsy after my ordeal, I wasn\u2019t a great deal of help in this endeavor, but Jamie and Ian coped matter-of-factly, boosting me over obstructions and handing me back and forth like a large, unwieldy package.</p><p>\u201cYou really aren\u2019t supposed to give alcohol to people suffering from hypothermia,\u201d I said feebly as Jamie put the flask to my lips again during one pause for rest.</p><p>\u201cI dinna care what you\u2019re suffering from, you\u2019ll feel it less with the drink in your belly,\u201d he said. It was still chilly from the rain, but his face was flushed from the climb. \u201cBesides,\u201d he added, mopping his brow with a fold of his plaid, \u201cif ye pass out, you\u2019ll be less trouble to hoik about. Christ, it\u2019s like hauling a newborn calf out of a bog.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d I said. I lay flat on the ground and closed my eyes, hoping I wouldn\u2019t throw up. The sky was spinning in one direction, my stomach in the other.</p><p>\u201cAway, dog!\u201d Ian said.</p><p>I opened one eye to see what was going on, and saw Ian firmly shooing Rollo away from the skull, which I had insisted he bring with us.</p><p>Seen in daylight, it was hardly a prepossessing object. Stained and discolored by the soil in which it had been buried, from a distance it resembled a smooth stone, scooped and gouged by wind and weather. Several of the teeth had been chipped or broken, though the skull showed no other damage.</p><p>\u201cJust what do ye mean to do wi\u2019 Prince Charming there?\u201d Jamie asked, eyeing my acquisition rather critically. His color had faded, and he had got his breath back. He glanced down at me, reached over and smoothed the hair out of my eyes, smiling.</p><p>\u201cAll right, Sassenach?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBetter,\u201d I assured him, sitting up. The countryside had not quite stopped moving round me, but the brandy sloshing through my veins now gave the movement a rather pleasant quality, like the soothing rush of trees past the window of a railway carriage.</p><p>\u201cI suppose we ought to take him home and give him Christian burial, at least?\u201d Ian eyed the skull dubiously.</p><p>\u201cI shouldn\u2019t think he\u2019d appreciate it; I don\u2019t believe he was a Christian.\u201d I fought back a vivid recollection of the man I had seen in the hollow. While it was true that some Indians had been converted by missionaries, this particular nak*d gentleman, with his black-painted face and feathered hair, had given me the impression that he was about as pagan as they come.</p><p>I fumbled in the pocket of my skirt, my fingers numb and stiff.</p><p>\u201cThis was buried with him.\u201d</p><p>I drew out the flat stone I had unearthed. It was dirty brown in color, an irregular oval half the size of my palm. It was flattened on one side, rounded on the other, and smooth as though it had come from a streambed. I turned it over on my palm and gasped.</p><p>The flattened face was indeed incised with a carving, as I had thought. It was a glyph in the shape of a spiral, coiling in on itself. But it wasn\u2019t the carving that brought both Jamie and Ian to peer into my hand, heads nearly touching.</p><p>Where the smooth surface had been chipped away, the rock within glowed with a lambent fire, little flames of green and orange and red all fighting fiercely for the light.</p><p>\u201cMy God, what is it?\u201d Ian asked, sounding awed.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s an opal\u2014and a damned big one, at that,\u201d Jamie said. He poked the stone with a large, blunt forefinger, as though checking to ensure that it was real. It was.</p><p>He rubbed a hand through his hair, thinking, then glanced at me.</p><p>\u201cThey do say that opals are unlucky stones, Sassenach.\u201d I thought he was joking, but he looked uneasy. A widely traveled, well-educated man, still he had been born a Highlander, and I knew he had a deeply superstitious streak, though it didn\u2019t often show.</p><p>Ha, I thought to myself. You\u2019ve spent the night with a ghost and you think he\u2019s superstitious?</p><p>\u201cNonsense,\u201d I said, with rather more conviction than I felt. \u201cIt\u2019s only a rock.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s no so much they\u2019re unlucky, Uncle Jamie,\u201d Ian put in. \u201cMy Mam has a wee opal ring her mother left her\u2014though it\u2019s nothing like this!\u201d Ian touched the stone reverently. \u201cShe did say as how an opal takes on something of its owner, though\u2014so if ye had an opal that belonged to a good person before ye, then all was well, and you\u2019d have good luck of it. But if not\u2014\u201d He shrugged.</p><p>\u201cAye, well,\u201d Jamie said dryly. He jerked his head toward the skull, pointing with his chin. \u201cIf it belonged to this fellow, it doesna seem as if it was ower-lucky for him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt least we know nobody killed him for it,\u201d I pointed out.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps they didna want it because they kent it was bad luck,\u201d Ian suggested. He was frowning at the stone, a worried line between his eyes. \u201cMaybe we should put it back, Auntie.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I rubbed my nose and looked at Jamie.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s probably rather valuable,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d The two of them stood in contemplation for a moment, torn between superstition and pragmatism.</p><p>\u201cAye well,\u201d Jamie said finally, \u201cI suppose it will do no harm to keep it for a bit.\u201d One side of his mouth lifted in a smile. \u201cLet me carry it, Sassenach; if I\u2019m struck by lightning on the way home, ye can put it back.\u201d</p> <p>I got awkwardly to my feet, holding on to Jamie\u2019s arm to keep my balance. I blinked and swayed, but stayed upright. Jamie took the stone from my hand and slipped it back into his sporran.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll show it to Nayawenne,\u201d I said. \u201cShe might know what the carving means, at least.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA good thought, Sassenach,\u201d Jamie approved. \u201cAnd if Prince Charming should be her kinsman, she can have him, with my blessing.\u201d He nodded toward a small stand of maple trees a hundred yards away, their green barely tinged with yellow.</p><p>\u201cThe horses are tied just yonder. Can ye walk, Sassenach?\u201d</p><p>I looked down at my feet, considering. They seemed a lot farther away than I was used to.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure,\u201d I said, \u201cI think I\u2019m really rather drunk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOch, no, Auntie,\u201d Ian assured me kindly. \u201cMy Da says you\u2019re never drunk, so long as ye can hold on to the floor.\u201d</p><p>Jamie laughed at this, and threw the end of his plaid over his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cMy Da used to say ye werena drunk, so long as ye could find your arse with both hands.\u201d He eyed my backside with a lifted brow, but wisely thought better of whatever else he might have been going to say.</p><p>Ian choked on a giggle and coughed, recovering himself.</p><p>\u201cAye, well. It\u2019s no much farther, Auntie. Are ye sure ye canna walk?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m no going to pick her up again, I\u2019ll tell ye,\u201d Jamie said, not waiting for my answer. \u201cI dinna want to rupture my back.\u201d He took the skull from Ian, holding it between the tips of his fingers, and placed it delicately in my lap. \u201cWait here wi\u2019 your wee friend, Sassenach,\u201d he said. \u201cIan and I will fetch the horses.\u201d</p><p>By the time we reached Fraser\u2019s Ridge, it was early afternoon. I had been cold, wet, and without food for nearly two days, and was feeling distinctly light-headed; a feeling exaggerated both by more infusions of brandywine and by my efforts to explain the events of the night before to Ian and Jamie. Viewed in the light of day, the entire night seemed unreal.</p><p>But then, almost everything seemed unreal, viewed through a haze of exhaustion, hunger, and mild drunkenness. Consequently, when we turned into the clearing, I thought at first that the smoke from the chimney was a hallucination\u2014until the tang of burning hickory wood struck my nose.</p><p>\u201cI thought you said you smoored the fire,\u201d I said to Jamie. \u201cLucky you didn\u2019t burn down the house.\u201d Such accidents were common; I had heard of more than one wooden cabin burned to the ground as the result of a poorly tended hearth.</p><p>\u201cI did smoor it,\u201d he said briefly, swinging down from the saddle. \u201cSomeone\u2019s here. D\u2019ye ken the horse, Ian?\u201d</p><p>Ian stood in his stirrups to look down into the penfold.</p><p>\u201cWhy, it\u2019s Auntie\u2019s wicked beast!\u201d he said in surprise. \u201cAnd a big dapple with him!\u201d</p><p>Sure enough, the newly named Judas was standing in the penfold, unsaddled, companionably switching flies head to tail with a thick-barreled gray gelding.</p> <p>\u201cDo you know who owns him?\u201d I asked. I hadn\u2019t got down yet; small waves of dizziness had been washing over me every few minutes, forcing me to cling to the saddle. The ground under the horse seemed to be heaving gently up and down, like ocean billows.</p><p>\u201cNo, but it\u2019s a friend,\u201d Jamie said. \u201cHe\u2019s fed my beasts for me, and milked the goat.\u201d He nodded from the horses\u2019 hay-filled manger to the door, where a pail of milk stood on the bench, neatly covered with a square of cloth to prevent flies falling in.</p><p>\u201cCome along, Sassenach.\u201d He reached up and took me by the waist. \u201cWe\u2019ll tuck ye in bed and brew ye a dish of tea.\u201d</p><p>Our arrival had been heard; the door of the cabin opened, and Duncan Innes looked out.</p><p>\u201cAh, you\u2019re there, Mac Dubh,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat\u2019s amiss, then? Your goat was carryin\u2019 on fit to wake the dead, wi\u2019 her bag like to burst, when I came up the trail this morning.\u201d Then he saw me, and his long, mournful face went blank with surprise.</p><p>\u201cMrs. Claire!\u201d he said, taking in my mud-stained and battered appearance. \u201cYe\u2019ll have had an accident, then? I was a bit worrit when I found the horse loose on the mountainside as I came up, and your wee box on the saddle. I looked about and called for ye, but I couldna find any sign of ye, so I brought the beast along to the house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I had an accident,\u201d I said, trying to stand upright by myself and not succeeding very well. \u201cI\u2019m all right, though.\u201d I wasn\u2019t altogether sure about that. My head felt three times its normal size.</p><p>\u201cBed,\u201d Jamie said firmly, grabbing me by the arms before I could fall over. \u201cNow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBath,\u201d I said. \u201cFirst.\u201d</p><p>He glanced in the direction of the creek.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll freeze or drown. Or both. For God\u2019s sake, Sassenach, eat and go to bed; ye can wash tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow. Hot water. Kettle.\u201d I hadn\u2019t the energy to waste on prolonged argument, but I was determined. I wasn\u2019t going to bed dirty, and I wasn\u2019t going to wash filthy sheets later.</p><p>Jamie looked at me in exasperation, then rolled his eyes in surrender.</p><p>\u201cHot water, kettle, now, then,\u201d he said. \u201cIan, fetch some wood, and then take Duncan and see to the pigs. I\u2019m going to scrub your auntie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can scrub myself!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe hell ye can.\u201d</p><p>He was right; my fingers were so stiff, they couldn\u2019t undo the hooks of my bodice. He undressed me as though I were a small child, tossing the ripped skirt and mud-caked petticoats carelessly into the corner, and stripping off the chemise and stays, worn so long that the cloth folds had made deep red ridges in my flesh. I groaned with a voluptuous combination of pain and pleasure, rubbing the red marks as blood coursed back through my constricted torso.</p><p>\u201cSit,\u201d he said, pushing a stool under me as I collapsed. He wrapped a quilt around my shoulders, put a plate containing one and a half stale bannocks in front of me, and went to rootle in the cupboard after soap, washcloth, and linen towels.</p><p>\u201cFind the green bottle, please,\u201d I said, nibbling at the dry oatcake. \u201cI\u2019ll need to wash my hair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmphm.\u201d More clinking, and he emerged at last with his hands full of things, including a towel and the bottle full of the shampoo I had made\u2014not wishing to wash my hair with lye soap\u2014from soaproot, lupin oil, walnut leaves and calendula flowers. He set these on the table, along with my largest mixing bowl, and carefully filled it with hot water from the cauldron.</p><p>Leaving this to cool a bit, Jamie dipped a rag into the water, and knelt down to wash my feet.</p><p>The feeling of warmth on my sore, half-frozen feet was as close to ecstasy as I expected to get this side of heaven. Tired and half-drunk as I was, I felt as though I were dissolving from the feet up, as he gently but thoroughly washed me from toe to head.</p><p>\u201cWhere did ye get this, Sassenach?\u201d Recalled from a state as close to sleep as to waking, I glanced down muzzily at my left knee. It was swollen, and the inner side had gone the deep purplish-blue of a gentian.</p><p>\u201cOh...that happened when I fell off the horse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was verra careless,\u201d he said sharply. \u201cHave I not told ye time and again to be careful, especially with a new horse? Ye canna trust them at all until ye\u2019ve known them a good while. And you\u2019re not strong enough to deal with one that\u2019s headstrong or skittish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t a matter of trusting him,\u201d I said. I rather dimly admired the broad spread of his bent shoulders, flexing smoothly under his linen shirt as he sponged my bruised knee. \u201cThe lightning scared him, and I fell off a thirty-foot ledge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYe could have broken your neck!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThought I had, for a bit.\u201d I closed my eyes, swaying slightly.</p><p>\u201cYe should have taken better thought, Sassenach; ye should never have been on that side of the ridge to begin with, let alone\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t help it,\u201d I said, opening my eyes. \u201cThe trail was washed out; I had to go around.\u201d</p><p>He was glaring at me, slanted eyes narrowed into dark blue slits.</p><p>\u201cYe ought not to have left the Muellers\u2019 in the first place, and it raining like that! Did ye not have sense enough to know what the ground would be like?\u201d</p><p>I straightened up with some effort, holding the quilt against my br**sts. It occurred to me, with a faint sense of surprise, that he was more than slightly annoyed.</p><p>\u201cWell...no,\u201d I said, trying to marshal what wits I had. \u201cHow could I know something like that? Besides\u2014\u201d</p><p>He interrupted me by slapping the washrag into the bowl, spattering water all over the table.</p><p>\u201cBe quiet!\u201d he said. \u201cI dinna mean to argue with you!\u201d</p><p>I stared up at him.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell do you mean to do? And where do you get off shouting at me? I haven\u2019t done anything wrong!\u201d</p><p>He inhaled strongly through his nose. Then he stood up, picked the rag from the bowl, and carefully wrung it out. He let out his breath, knelt down in front of me, and deftly swabbed my face clean.</p><p>\u201cNo. Ye haven\u2019t,\u201d he agreed. One corner of his long mouth quirked wryly. \u201cBut ye scairt hell out of me, Sassenach, and it makes me want to give ye a terrible scolding, whether ye deserve it or no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d I said. I wanted at first to laugh, but felt a stab of remorse as I saw how drawn his face was. His shirt sleeve was daubed with mud, and there were burrs and foxtails in his stockings, left from a night of searching for me through the dark mountains, not knowing where I was; if I were alive or dead. I had scared hell out of him, whether I meant to or not.</p><p>I groped for some means of apology, finding my tongue nearly as thick as my wits. Finally I reached out and picked a fuzzy yellow catkin from his hair.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you scold me in Gaelic?\u201d I said. \u201cIt will ease your feelings just as much, and I\u2019ll only understand half of what you say.\u201d</p><p>He made a Scottish noise of derision, and shoved my head into the bowl with a firm hand on my neck. When I reemerged, dripping, though, he dropped a towel on my head and started in, rubbing my hair with large, firm hands and speaking in the formally menacing tones of a minister denouncing sin from the pulpit.</p><p>\u201cSilly woman,\u201d he said in Gaelic. \u201cYou have not the brain of a fly!\u201d I caught the words for \u201cfoolish,\u201d and \u201cclumsy,\u201d in the subsequent remarks, but quickly stopped listening. I closed my eyes and lost myself instead in the dreamy pleasure of having my hair rubbed dry and then combed out.</p><p>He had a sure and gentle touch, probably gained from handling horses\u2019 tails. I had seen him talk to horses while he groomed them, much as he was talking to me now, the Gaelic a soothing descant to the whisk of curry comb or brush. I imagined he was more complimentary to the horses, though. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>His hands touched my neck, my bare back, and shoulders as he worked; fleeting touches that brought my newly thawed flesh to life. I shivered, but let the quilt fall to my lap. The fire was still burning high, flames dancing on the side of the kettle, and the room had grown quite warm.</p><p>He was now describing, in a pleasantly conversational tone, various things he would have liked to do to me, beginning with beating me black and blue with a stick, and going on from there. Gaelic is a rich language, and Jamie was far from unimaginative in matters of either violence or sex. Whether he meant it or not, I thought it was probably a good thing that I didn\u2019t understand everything he said.</p><p>I could feel the heat of the fire on my br**sts; Jamie\u2019s warmth against my back. The loose fabric of his shirt brushed my skin as he leaned across to reach a bottle on the shelf, and I shivered again. He noticed this, and interrupted his tirade for a moment.</p><p>\u201cCold?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d The sharp smell of camphor stung my nose, and before I could move, one large hand had seized my shoulder, holding me in place, while the other rubbed slippery oil firmly into my chest.</p><p>\u201cStop! That tickles! Stop, I say!\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t stop. I squirmed madly, trying to escape, but he was a lot bigger than I was.</p><p>\u201cBe still,\u201d he said, inexorable fingers rubbing deep between my ticklish ribs, under my collarbone, around and under my tender br**sts, greasing me as thoroughly as a suckling pig bound for the spit.</p> <p>\u201cYou bastard!\u201d I said when he let me go, breathless from struggling and giggling. I reeked of peppermint and camphor, and my skin glowed with heat from chin to belly.</p><p>He grinned at me, revenged and thoroughly unrepentant.</p><p>\u201cYou do it to me when I\u2019ve got an ague,\u201d he pointed out, wiping his hands on the towel. \u201cGrease for the gander is grease for the goose, aye?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have not got an ague! Not even a sniffle!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI expect ye will have, out all night and sleepin\u2019 in wet clothes.\u201d He clicked his tongue disapprovingly, like a Scottish housewife.</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019ve never done that, have you? How many times have you caught cold from sleeping rough?\u201d I demanded. \u201cGood heavens, you lived in a cave for seven years!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd spent three of them sneezing. Besides, I\u2019m a man,\u201d he added, with total illogic. \u201cHad ye not better put on your night rail, Sassenach? Ye havena got a stitch on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI noticed. Wet clothes and being cold do not cause sickness,\u201d I informed him, hunting about under the table for the fallen quilt.</p><p>He raised both eyebrows.</p><p>\u201cOh, they don\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, they don\u2019t.\u201d I backed out from under the table, clutching the quilt. \u201cI\u2019ve told you before, it\u2019s germs that cause sickness. If I haven\u2019t been exposed to any germs, I won\u2019t get sick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, gerrrrms,\u201d he said, rolling it like a marble in his mouth. \u201cGod, ye\u2019ve got a fine, fat arse! Why do folk have more illness in the winter than the springtime, then? The germs breed in the cold, I expect?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot exactly.\u201d Feeling absurdly self-conscious, I spread the quilt, meaning to fold it around my shoulders again. Before I could wrap myself in it, though, he had grabbed me by the arm and pulled me toward him.</p><p>\u201cCome here,\u201d he said, unnecessarily. Before I could say anything, he had smacked my bare backside smartly, turned me around and kissed me, hard.</p> <p>He let go, and I almost fell down. I flung my arms around him, and he grabbed my waist, steadying me.</p><p>\u201cI dinna care whether it\u2019s the germs or the night air or Billy-be-damned,\u201d he said, looking sternly down his nose. \u201cI willna have ye fallin\u2019 ill, and that\u2019s all about it. Now, hop yourself directly into your gown, and to bed with ye!\u201d</p><p>He felt awfully good in my arms. The smooth linen of his shirtfront was cool against the heated glow of my greased br**sts, and while the wool of his kilt was much scratchier against my nak*d thighs and belly, the sensation was by no means unpleasant. I rubbed myself slowly against him, like a cat against a post.</p><p>\u201cBed,\u201d he said again, sounding a trifle less stern.</p><p>\u201cMmmm,\u201d I said, making it reasonably obvious that I didn\u2019t mean to go there alone.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said, squirming slightly. I supposed that he meant to get away, but since I didn\u2019t let go, the movement merely exacerbated the situation between us.</p><p>\u201cMm-hmm,\u201d I said, holding on tight. Intoxicated as I was, it hadn\u2019t escaped me that Duncan would undoubtedly be spending the night on the hearth rug, Ian on the trundle. And while I was feeling somewhat uninhibited at the moment, the feeling didn\u2019t extend quite that far.</p><p>\u201cMy father told me never to take advantage of a woman who was the worse for drink,\u201d he said. He had stopped squirming, but now started again, slower, as though he couldn\u2019t help himself.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not worse, I\u2019m better,\u201d I assured him. \u201cBesides\u2014\u201d I executed a slow, sinuous squirm of my own. \u201cI thought he said you weren\u2019t drunk if you could find your arse with both hands.\u201d</p><p>He eyed me appraisingly.</p><p>\u201cI hate to tell ye, Sassenach, but it\u2019s not your arse ye\u2019ve got hold of\u2014it\u2019s mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s all right,\u201d I assured him. \u201cWe\u2019re married. Share and share alike. One flesh; the priest said so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps it was a mistake to put that grease on ye,\u201d he muttered, half to himself. \u201cIt never does this to me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you\u2019re a man.\u201d</p><p>He had one last gallant try.</p><p>\u201cShould ye not eat a bit more, lass? You must be starving.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMm-hm,\u201d I said. I buried my face in his shirt and bit him, lightly. \u201cRavenous.\u201d</p><p>There is a story told of the Earl of Montrose\u2014that after one battle, he was found lying on the field, half dead of cold and starvation, by a young woman. The young woman whipped off her shoe, mixed barley with cold water in it, and fed the resulting mess to the prostrate earl, thus saving his life.</p><p>The cup now thrust under my nose appeared to contain a portion of this same life-giving substance, with the minor difference that mine was warm.</p><p>\u201cWhat is this?\u201d I asked, eyeing the pale grains floating belly-up on the surface of a watery liquid. It looked like a cup full of drowned maggots.</p><p>\u201cBarley crowdie,\u201d Ian said, gazing proudly at the cup as though it were his firstborn child. \u201cI made it myself, from the bag ye brought from Muellers\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d I said, and took a cautious sip. I didn\u2019t think he had mixed it in his shoe, despite the musty aroma. \u201cVery good,\u201d I said. \u201cHow kind of you, Ian.\u201d</p><p>He went pink with gratification.</p><p>\u201cOch, it was nothing,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s plenty more, Auntie. Or shall I fetch ye a bit of cheese? I could cut the green bits off for ye.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no\u2014this will be fine,\u201d I said hastily. \u201cAh...why don\u2019t you take your gun out, Ian, and see if you can bag a squirrel or a rabbit? I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll be well enough to cook supper.\u201d</p><p>He beamed, the smile transforming his long, bony face.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad to hear it, Auntie,\u201d he said. \u201cYe should see what Uncle Jamie and I have been eatin\u2019 while ye\u2019ve been gone!\u201d</p><p>He left me lying on my pillows, wondering what to do with the cup of crowdie. I didn\u2019t want to drink it, but I felt like a puddle of warm butter\u2014soft and creamy, nearly liquid\u2014and the idea of getting up seemed unthinkably energetic.</p><p>Jamie, making no further protests, had taken me to bed, where he had completed the business of thawing me out with thoroughness and dispatch. I thought it was a good thing he wasn\u2019t going hunting with Ian. He reeked of camphor as much as I did; the animals would scent him a mile away.</p><p>Tucking me tenderly under the quilts, he had left me to sleep while he went to greet Duncan more formally and offer him the hospitality of the house. I could hear the deep murmur of their voices outside now; they were sitting on the bench beside the door, enjoying the last of the afternoon sunshine\u2014long, pale beams slanted through the window, lighting a warm glow of pewter and wood within.</p><p>The sun touched the skull, too. This stood on my writing table across the room, composing a cozily domestic still life with a clay jug filled with flowers and my casebook.</p><p>It was sight of the casebook that roused me from torpor. The birth I had attended at the Muellers\u2019 farm now seemed vague and insubstantial in my mind; I thought I had better record the details while I still recalled them at all.</p><p>Thus prompted by the stirrings of professional duty, I stretched, groaned, and sat up. I still felt mildly dizzy and my ears rang from the aftereffects of brandywine. I was also faintly sore almost everywhere\u2014more in some spots than others\u2014but generally speaking, I was in decent working order. Beginning to be hungry, though.</p><p>I did hope Ian would come back with meat for the pot; I knew better than to gorge my shriveled stomach on cheese and salt fish, but a nice, strengthening squirrel broth, flavored with spring onions and dried mushrooms, would be just what the doctor ordered.</p><p>Speaking of broth\u2014I slid reluctantly out of bed and stumbled across the floor to the hearth, where I poured the cold barley soup back into the pot. Ian had made enough for a regiment\u2014always supposing the regiment to be composed of Scots. Living in a country normally barren of much that was edible, they were capable of relishing glutinous masses of cereal, untouched by any redeeming hint of spice or flavor. From a feebler race myself, I didn\u2019t feel quite up to it.</p><p>The opened bag of barley stood beside the hearth, the burlap sack still visibly damp. I would have to spread the grain to dry, or it would rot. My bruised knee protesting a bit, I went and got a large flat tray-basket made of plaited reeds, and knelt to spread the damp grain in a thin layer over it.</p><p>\u201cWill he have a soft mouth, then, Duncan?\u201d Jamie\u2019s voice came clearly through the window; the hide covering was rolled up, to let in air, and I caught the faint tang of tobacco from Duncan\u2019s pipe. \u201cHe\u2019s a big, strong brute, but he\u2019s got a kind eye.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, he\u2019s a bonny wee fellow,\u201d Duncan said, the note of pride in his voice unmistakable. \u201cAnd a nice soft mouth, aye. Miss Jo had her stableman pick him from the market in Wilmington; said he must find a horse could be managed well wi\u2019 one hand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmphm. Aye, well, he\u2019s a lovely creature.\u201d The wooden bench creaked as one of the men shifted his weight. I understood the equivocation behind Jamie\u2019s compliment, and wondered whether Duncan did, as well.</p><p>Part of it was simple condescension; Jamie had been raised on horseback, and as a born horseman, would scorn the notion that hands were necessary at all; I had seen him maneuver a horse by the shifting pressure of knees and thighs alone, or set his mount at a gallop across a crowded field, the reins knotted on the horse\u2019s neck, to leave Jamie\u2019s hands free for sword and pistol.</p><p>But Duncan was neither a horseman nor a soldier; he had lived as a fisherman near Ardrossan, until the Rising had plucked him, like so many others, from his nets and his boat, and sent him to Culloden and disaster. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Jamie wouldn\u2019t be so untactful as to point up an inexperience of which Duncan was more than aware already; he would, though, mean to point up something else. Had Duncan caught it?</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s you she means to help, Mac Dubh, and well ye ken it, too.\u201d Duncan\u2019s tones were very dry; he\u2019d taken Jamie\u2019s point, all right.</p><p>\u201cI havena said otherwise, Duncan.\u201d Jamie\u2019s voice was even.</p><p>\u201cMmphm.\u201d</p> <p>I smiled, despite the air of edginess between them. Duncan was every bit as good as Jamie at the Highland art of inarticulate eloquence. This particular noise captured both mild insult at Jamie\u2019s implication that it was improper for Duncan to be accepting the gift of a horse from Jocasta, and a willingness to accept the likewise implied apology for the insult.</p><p>\u201cHave ye thought, then?\u201d The bench creaked as Duncan abruptly changed the subject. \u201cWill it be Sinclair, or Geordie Chisholm?\u201d</p><p>Without giving Jamie time to reply, he went on, but in a way that made it clear that he had said all this before. I wondered whether he was trying to convince Jamie, or himself\u2014or only assist them both in coming to a decision by repeating the facts of the matter.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s true Sinclair\u2019s a cooper, but Geordie\u2019s a good fellow; a thrifty worker, and he\u2019s the two wee sons, besides. Sinclair isna marrit, so he wouldna need so much in the way of setting up, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019d need lathes and tools, and iron and seasoned wood,\u201d Jamie broke in. \u201cHe could sleep in his shop, aye, but he\u2019ll need the shop to sleep in. And it will cost verra dear, I think, to buy all that\u2019s needed for a cooperage. Geordie would need a bit of food for his family, but we can provide that from the place here; beyond that, he\u2019ll need no more to begin than a few wee tools\u2014he\u2019ll have an ax, aye?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAye, he\u2019ll have that from his indenture, but it\u2019s the planting season now, Mac Dubh. With the clearing\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI ken that weel enough,\u201d Jamie said, a bit testily. \u201cIt\u2019s me that put five acres in corn a month ago. And cleared them, first.\u201d While Duncan had been taking his ease at River Run, chatting in taverns and breaking in his new horse. I heard it, and so did Duncan; there was a distinct silence that spoke as loud as words.</p><p>A creak from the bench, and then Duncan spoke again, mildly.</p><p>\u201cYour auntie Jo\u2019s sent a wee gift for ye.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, has she?\u201d The edge in his voice was even more perceptible. I hoped Duncan had sense enough to heed it.</p><p>\u201cA bottle of whisky.\u201d There was a smile in Duncan\u2019s voice, answered by a reluctant laugh from Jamie.</p> <p>\u201cOh, has she?\u201d he said again, in quite a different tone. \u201cThat\u2019s verra kind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe means to be.\u201d There was a substantial creak and shuffle as Duncan got to his feet. \u201cCome wi\u2019 me and fetch it, then, Mac Dubh. A wee drink wouldna do your temper any harm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it wouldn\u2019t.\u201d Jamie sounded rueful. \u201cI\u2019ve not slept the night, and I\u2019m cranky as a rutting boar. Ye\u2019ll forgive my manners, Duncan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOch, dinna speak of it.\u201d There was a soft sound, as of a hand clapping a shoulder, and I heard them walk off across the yard together. I moved to the window and watched them, Jamie\u2019s hair gleaming dark bronze in the setting sun, as he tilted his head to listen to something Duncan was telling him, the shorter man gesturing in explanation. The movements of Duncan\u2019s single arm threw off the rhythm of his stride, so he walked with jerky movements, like a large puppet.</p><p>What would have become of him, I wondered, had Jamie not found him\u2014and found a place for him? There was no place in Scotland for a one-armed fisherman. There would have been nothing for him but beggary, surely. Starvation, perhaps. Or theft to live, and death at the end of a rope, like Gavin Hayes.</p><p>But this was the New World, and if life was chancy here, well, it meant a chance at life, at least. No wonder that Jamie should worry over who should have the best chance. Sinclair the cooper, or Chisholm the farmer?</p><p>A cooper would be valuable to have at hand; it would save the men on the ridge the long trip into Cross Creek or Averasboro to fetch the barrels needed for pitch and turpentine, for salted meat and cider. But it would be expensive to set up a cooper\u2019s shop, even with the bare rudiments the trade required. And then there was the unknown Chisholm\u2019s wife and small children to be considered\u2014how were they living now, and what might become of them without help?</p><p>Duncan had so far located thirty of the men of Ardsmuir; Gavin Hayes was the first, and we had done for him all that could be done; seen him safe into heaven\u2019s keeping. Two more were known dead, one of fever, one of drowning. Three had completed their terms of indenture, and\u2014armed only with the ax and suit of clothes that were a bondsman\u2019s final pay\u2014had managed to find a foothold for themselves, claiming backcountry land and carving out small homesteads there.</p> <p>Of the remainder, we had brought twenty so far to settle on good land near the river, under Jamie\u2019s sponsorship. Another was feebleminded but worked for one of the others as a hired man, and so earned his keep. It had taken all of our resources to do it, using all our small quantity of cash, notes against the value of as yet nonexistent crops\u2014and one hair-raising trip into Cross Creek.</p><p>Jamie had called upon all his acquaintance there, borrowing small amounts from each, and had then taken this money to the riverside taverns, where in three sleepless nights of play, he had managed to quadruple his stake\u2014narrowly avoiding being knifed in the process, as I learned much later.</p><p>I was speechless, looking at the long, jagged rent in the bosom of his coat.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2014?\u201d I croaked at last.</p><p>He shrugged briefly, looking suddenly very tired.</p><p>\u201cIt doesna matter,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s over.\u201d</p><p>He had then shaved, washed, and gone round to all the plantation owners again, returning each man\u2019s money with thanks and a small payment of interest, leaving us with enough to manage seed corn for planting, an extra mule for plowing, a goat and some pigs.</p><p>I didn\u2019t ask him anything else; only mended the coat, and saw him safely into bed when he came back from repaying the money lent. I sat by him for a long time, though, watching the lines of exhaustion in his face ease a little as he slept.</p><p>Only a little. I had lifted his hand, limp and heavy with sleep, and traced the deep lines of his smooth, callused palm, over and over. The lines of head and heart and life ran long and deep. How many lives lay in those creases now?</p><p>My own. His settlers. Fergus and Marsali, who had just arrived from Jamaica, in the custody of Germaine, a chubby blond charmer who had his besotted father in the palm of his fat little hand.</p><p>I glanced involuntarily through the window at the thought. Ian and Jamie had helped to build them a small cabin only a mile from our own, and sometimes Marsali would walk over in the evenings to visit, bringing the baby. I could do with seeing him, I thought wistfully. Lonely as I sometimes was for Bree, little Germaine was a substitute for the grandchild I would never hold.</p><p>I sighed, and shrugged away the thought.</p><p>Jamie and Duncan had come back with the whisky; I could hear them talking by the paddock, their voices relaxed, all tension between them eased\u2014for the moment.</p><p>I finished spreading out a thin layer of the wet barley and set it in the corner of the hearth to dry, then went to the writing table, uncapped the inkwell, and opened my casebook. It didn\u2019t take long to record the details of the newest Mueller\u2019s arrival into the world; it had been a long labor but otherwise quite normal. The birth itself had presented no complications; the only unusual feature had been the child\u2019s caul...</p><p>I stopped writing and shook my head. Still distracted by thoughts of Jamie, I had let my attention wander. Petronella\u2019s child had not been born with a caul. I had a clear memory of the top of the skull crowning, the pudendum a shiny red ring stretched tight around a small patch of black hair. I had touched it, felt the tiny pulse throbbing there, just under the skin. I remembered vividly the sensation of the wet down against my fingers, like the damp skin of a new-hatched chick.</p><p>It was the dream, I thought. I had dreamed in my burrow, mingling the events of the two births together\u2014this one, and Brianna\u2019s. It was Brianna who had been born with a caul.</p><p>A \u201csilly hoo,\u201d the Scots called it; a lucky hood. A fortunate portent, a caul offered\u2014they said\u2014protection from drowning in later life. And some children born with a caul were blessed with second sight\u2014though having met one or two of those who saw with the third eye, I took leave to doubt that such a blessing was unmixed.</p><p>Whether lucky or not, Brianna had never showed any signs of that strange Celtic \u201cknowing,\u201d and I thought it just as well. I knew enough of my own peculiar form of second sight\u2014the certain knowledge of things to come\u2014not to wish its complications on anyone else.</p><p>I looked at the page before me. Only half noticing, I had sketched the rough outline of a girl\u2019s head. A curving thick line of swirling hair, the bare suggestion of a long, straight nose. Beyond that, she was faceless.</p><p>I was no artist. I had learned to make clean clinical drawings, accurate pictures of limbs and bodies, but I lacked Brianna\u2019s gift of bringing lines to life. The sketch as it stood was no more than an aide-m\u00e9moire; I could look at it and paint her face in memory. To try to do more\u2014to conjure flesh out of the paper\u2014would be to ruin that, and risk losing the image I held of her in my heart.</p><p>And would I conjure her in the flesh, if I could do it? No. That I would not; I would a thousand times rather think of her in the safety and comfort of her own time than wish her here amid the harshness and dangers of this one. But it didn\u2019t mean that I didn\u2019t miss her.</p><p>For the first time, I felt some small sympathy for Jocasta Cameron and her desire for an heir; someone to remain behind, to take her place; testimony that her life had not been lived in vain.</p><p>Twilight was rising beyond the window, from field and wood and river. People spoke of night falling, but it didn\u2019t, really. Darkness rose, filling first the hollows, then shadowing the slopes, creeping imperceptibly up tree trunks and fenceposts as night swallowed the ground and rose up to join the greater dark of the star-spread sky above.</p><p>I sat staring out the window, watching the light change on the horses in the paddock; not so much fading as altering, so that everything\u2014arched necks, round rumps, even single blades of grass\u2014stood stark and clean, reality freed for one brief moment from the day\u2019s illusions of sun and shadow.</p><p>Unseeing, I traced the line of the drawing with my finger, over and over, as the dark rose up around me and the realities of my heart stood clear in the dusky light. No, I would not wish Brianna here. But that didn\u2019t mean I didn\u2019t miss her.</p><p>I finished my notes eventually, and sat quietly for a moment. I should go and begin making supper, I knew, but the weariness of my ordeal still dragged at me, making me unwilling to move. All my muscles ached, and the bruise on my knee throbbed. All I really wanted to do was to crawl back into bed.</p><p>Instead, I picked up the skull, which I had set down next to my casebook on the table. I ran my finger gently over the rounded cranium. It was a thoroughly macabre desk ornament, I would admit that, but I felt rather attached to it, nonetheless. I had always found bones beautiful, of man or beast; stark and graceful remnants of life reduced to its foundations. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I thought suddenly of something I had not remembered in many years; a small dark closet of a room in Paris, hidden behind an apothecary\u2019s shop. The walls covered with a honeycomb of shelves, each cell holding a polished skull. Animals of many kinds, from shrews to wolves, mice to bears.</p><p>And with my hand on the head of my unknown friend, I heard Master Raymond\u2019s voice, as clear in memory as though he stood beside me.</p><p>\u201cSympathy?\u201d he had said as I touched the high curve of a polished elk\u2019s skull. \u201cIt is an unusual emotion to feel for a bone, madonna.\u201d</p><p>But he had known what I meant. I knew he did, for when I asked him why he kept these skulls, he had smiled and said, \u201cThey are company, of a sort.\u201d</p> <p>I knew what he meant, too; for surely the gentleman whose skull I kept had been company for me, in a very dark and lonely place. Not for the first time, I wondered whether he had in fact had anything to do with the apparition I had seen on the mountain; the Indian with his face painted black.</p><p>The ghost\u2014if that is what he was\u2014had not smiled or spoken aloud. I hadn\u2019t seen his teeth, which would be my only point of comparison with the skull I held\u2014for I found that I was holding it, rubbing a thumb over the jagged edge of a cracked incisor. I lifted the skull to the light, examining it closely by the soft sunset light.</p><p>The teeth on the one side had been shattered; cracked and splintered as though he had been struck violently in the mouth, perhaps by a rock or a club\u2014the stock of a gun? On the other side they were whole; in very good condition, actually. I was no expert but thought the skull was that of a mature man; one in his late thirties or early forties. A man of that age should show a good bit of wear to his teeth, given the Indians\u2019 diet of ground corn, which\u2014owing to the manner of preparation, pounded between flat stones\u2014contained quite a bit of ground stone as well.</p><p>The incisors and canine on the good side were scarcely worn at all, though. I turned the skull over, to judge the abrasion of the molars, and stopped cold.</p><p>Very cold, in spite of the fire at my back. As cold as I had been in the lost, fireless dark, alone on the mountain with a dead man\u2019s head. For the late sun now struck sparks from my hands: from the silver band of my wedding ring\u2014and from the silver fillings in my late companion\u2019s mouth.</p> <p>I sat staring for a moment, then turned the skull over and set it gently down on the desk, careful as though it were made of glass.</p><p>\u201cMy God,\u201d I said, all tiredness forgotten. \u201cMy God,\u201d I said, to the empty eyes and the lopsided grin. \u201cWho were you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho do ye think he can have been?\u201d Jamie touched the skull gingerly. We had no more than moments; Duncan had gone to the privy, Ian to feed the pig. I couldn\u2019t bring myself to wait, though\u2014I had had to tell someone at once.</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t the faintest idea. Except, of course, that he has to have been someone...like me.\u201d A violent shiver ran over me. Jamie glanced at me, and frowned.</p><p>\u201cYe havena take a chill, have ye, Sassenach?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I smiled weakly up at him. \u201cGoose walking on my grave, I expect.\u201d</p> <p>He plucked my shawl from the hook by the door and swung it around me. His hands stayed on my shoulders, warm and comforting.</p><p>\u201cIt means the one thing else, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d he asked quietly. \u201cIt means there is another...place. Perhaps nearby.\u201d</p><p>Another stone circle\u2014or something like it. I had thought of that, too, and the notion made me shudder once again. Jamie looked thoughtfully at the skull, then drew the handkerchief from his sleeve and draped it gently over the empty eyes.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll bury him after supper,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cOh, supper.\u201d I pushed my hair behind my ear, trying to get my scattered thoughts to focus on food. \u201cYes, I\u2019ll see if I can find some eggs. That will be quick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDinna trouble yourself, Sassenach.\u201d Jamie peered into the pot on the hearth. \u201cWe can eat this.\u201d</p><p>This time, the shudder was purely one of fastidiousness.</p><p>\u201cUgh,\u201d I said. Jamie grinned at me.</p> <p>\u201cNothing wrong wi\u2019 good barley crowdie, is there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAssuming there is such a thing,\u201d I replied, looking into the pot with distaste. \u201cThis smells more like distiller\u2019s mash.\u201d Made with wet grain, insufficiently cooked and left standing, the cold, scummy soup was already giving off a yeasty whiff of fermentation.</p><p>\u201cSpeaking of which,\u201d I said, giving the opened sack of damp barley a poke with my toe, \u201cthis needs to be spread to dry, before it starts to mold, if it hasn\u2019t already.\u201d</p><p>Jamie was staring at the disgusting soup, brows furrowed in thought.</p><p>\u201cAye?\u201d he said absently, then, coming to consciousness, \u201cOh, aye. I\u2019ll do it.\u201d He twisted shut the top of the bag, and heaved it onto his shoulder. On the way out the door, he paused, looking at the shrouded skull.</p><p>\u201cYou said ye didna think him Christian,\u201d he said, and glanced curiously at me. \u201cWhy was that, Sassenach?\u201d</p><p>I hesitated, but there was no time to tell him about my dream\u2014if that\u2019s what it had been. I could hear Duncan and Ian in conversation, coming toward the house.</p><p>\u201cNo particular reason,\u201d I said, with a shrug.</p><p>\u201cAye, well,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ll give him the benefit o\u2019 the doubt.\u201d</p><p>24</p><p>LETTER-WRITING: THE GREAT ART O\u2019 LOVE</p><p>Oxford, March 1971</p><p>Roger supposed that it must rain as much in Inverness as it did in Oxford, but somehow he had never minded the northern rain. The cold Scottish wind sweeping in off the Moray Firth was exhilarating and the drenching rain both stimulation and refreshment to the spirit.</p><p>But that had been Scotland, when Brianna was with him. Now she was in America, he in England, and Oxford was cold and dull, all its streets and buildings gray as the ash of dead fires. Rain pattered on the shoulders of his scholar\u2019s gown as he dashed across the quad, shielding an armload of papers under the poplin folds. Once in the shelter of the porter\u2019s lodge, he stopped to shake himself, doglike, flinging droplets over the stone passage.</p><p>\u201cAny letters?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cThink so, Mr. Wakefield. Just a sec.\u201d Martin disappeared into his inner sanctum, leaving Roger to read the names of the College\u2019s war dead, carved on the stone tablet inside the entry.</p><p>George Vanlandingham, Esq. The Honorable Phillip Menzies. Joseph William Roscoe. Not for the first time, Roger found himself wondering about those dead heroes and what they had been like. Since meeting Brianna and her mother, he\u2019d found that the past too often wore a disturbingly human face.</p><p>\u201cHere you are, Mr. Wakefield.\u201d Martin leaned beaming across the counter, holding out a thin sheaf of letters. \u201cOne from the States today,\u201d he added, with a broad wink.</p><p>Roger felt an answering grin break out on his face, and a warm glow spread at once from his chest through his limbs, dispelling the chill of the rainy day.</p><p>\u201cWill we be seeing your young woman up soon, Mr. Wakefield?\u201d Martin craned his neck, peering frankly at the letter with its U.S. stamps. The porter had met Brianna when she had come down with Roger just before Christmas, and had fallen under her spell.</p><p>\u201cI hope so. Perhaps in the summer. Thanks!\u201d</p><p>He turned toward his staircase, tucking the letters carefully into the sleeve of his gown while he groped for his key. He felt a mingled sense of elation and dismay at thought of the summer. She\u2019d said she\u2019d come in July\u2014but July was still four months away. In some moods, he didn\u2019t think he\u2019d last four days.</p><p>Roger folded the letter again and tucked it into his inside pocket, next to his heart. She wrote every few days, from brief notes to long screeds, and each of her letters left him with a small warm glow that lasted usually until the next arrived.</p><p>At the same time, her letters were faintly unsatisfactory these days. Still warmly affectionate, always signed \u201cLove,\u201d always saying she missed him and wanted him with her. No longer the sort of thing that burned the page, though.</p><p>Perhaps it was natural; a normal progression as they knew each other longer; no one could go on writing passionate missives day after day, not with any honesty.</p><p>No doubt it was only his imagination that Brianna seemed to hold back a bit in her letters. He could do without the excesses of one friend\u2019s girl, who had clipped bits of her pubic hair and included them in a letter\u2014though he rather admired the sentiment behind the gesture.</p><p>He took a bite of his sandwich and chewed absentmindedly, thinking of the latest article Fiona had showed him. Now married, Fiona considered herself an expert on matters matrimonial, and took a sisterly interest in the bumpy course of Roger\u2019s love affair.</p><p>She was constantly clipping helpful tips from women\u2019s magazines and mailing them to him. The latest had been a piece from My Weekly, entitled \u201cHow to Intrigue a Man.\u201d Sauce for the gander, Fiona had written pointedly in the margin.</p><p>\u201cShare his interests,\u201d one tip advised. \u201cIf you think football\u2019s a loss, but he\u2019s dead keen, sit down beside him and ask about Arsenal\u2019s chances the week. If football\u2019s boring, he isn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Roger smiled a little grimly. He\u2019d been sharing Brianna\u2019s interests, all right, if tracking her bloody parents through their hair-raising history counted as a pastime. Damn little of that he could share with her, though.</p><p>\u201cBe coy,\u201d said another of the magazine\u2019s tips. \u201cNothing piques a man\u2019s interest more than an air of reserve. Don\u2019t let him get too close, too soon.\u201d</p><p>It occurred to Roger to wonder whether Brianna had been reading similar advice in American magazines, but he dismissed the thought. She wasn\u2019t above reading fashion magazines\u2014he had seen her do it on occasion\u2014but Brianna Randall was as incapable of playing that sort of silly game as he was himself.</p><p>No, she wouldn\u2019t put him off just to raise his interest in her; what would be the point? Surely she knew just how much he cared about her.</p><p>Did she, though? With a qualm of uneasiness, Roger recalled another of My Weekly\u2019s tips to the lovelorn.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t assume he can read your mind,\u201d the article said. \u201cGive him a hint of how you feel.\u201d</p><p>Roger took a random bite of the sandwich and chewed, oblivious to its contents. Well, he\u2019d hinted, all right. Come out and bared his bloody soul. And she\u2019d promptly leapt into a plane and buggered off to Boston.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be too aggressive,\u201d he murmured, quoting Tip #14, and snorted. The woman don next to him edged slightly away.</p><p>Roger sighed and deposited the bitten sandwich distastefully on the plastic tray.

They ate rats, which was laudable of them, some were ornamental, and most of them were wise enough to keep out of my way. Live and let live was my basic attitude.</p> <p>On the other hand, that was theory. In practice, I had any number of objections to the huge snake curled up on the seat of the privy. Beyond the fact that he was gravely discommoding me at present, he wasn\u2019t usefully eating rats and he wasn\u2019t aesthetically pleasing, either, being a sort of drab gray with darker splotches.</p><p>My major objection to him, though, was the fact that he was a rattlesnake. I supposed that in a way it was fortunate that he was; it was only the heartstopping buzz of his rattles that had prevented me sitting on him in the dawn\u2019s early light.</p><p>The first sound froze me in place, just inside the tiny privy. I extended one foot behind me, groping gingerly for the doorsill. The snake didn\u2019t like that; I froze again as the warning buzz increased in volume. I could see the vibrating tip of his tail, sticking up like a thick yellow finger, rudely pointing from the heap of coils.</p><p>My mouth had gone dry as paper; I bit the inside of my cheek, trying to summon a little saliva.</p><p>How long was he? I seemed to recall Brianna\u2019s telling me\u2014from her Girl Scout handbook\u2014that rattlesnakes were capable of striking at a distance up to one-third their own body length. No more than two feet separated my nightgown-covered thighs from the nasty flat head with its lidless eyes.</p><p>Was he six feet long? It was impossible to tell, but the squirm of coils looked unpleasantly massive, the rounded body thick with scaled muscle. He was a bloody big snake, and the fear of being ignominiously bitten in the crotch if I moved was enough to make me stand still.</p> <p>I couldn\u2019t stand still forever, though. Other considerations aside, the shock of seeing the snake hadn\u2019t decreased the urgency of my bodily functions in the slightest.</p><p>I had some vague notion that snakes were deaf; perhaps I could shout for help. But what if they weren\u2019t? There was that Sherlock Holmes story about the snake who responded to a whistle. Perhaps the snake would find whistling inoffensive, at least. Cautiously, I pursed my lips and blew. Nothing came out but a thin stream of air.</p><p>\u201cClaire?\u201d said a puzzled voice behind me. \u201cWhat the hell are ye doing?\u201d</p><p>I jumped at the sound, and so did the snake\u2014or at least it moved suddenly, flexing its coils in what appeared to be imminent attack.</p><p>I froze to the doorframe and the snake quit moving, except for the chronic whirr of its rattles, like the annoying buzz of an alarm clock that wouldn\u2019t shut off.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a f**king snake in here,\u201d I said through my teeth, trying not to move even my lips.</p><p>\u201cWell, why are ye standing there? Move aside and I\u2019ll pitch it out.\u201d I could hear Jamie\u2019s footsteps, coming close.</p><p>The snake heard him too\u2014obviously it wasn\u2019t deaf\u2014and revved up its rattling.</p> <p>\u201cAh,\u201d Jamie said, in a different tone of voice. I heard a rustle as he stooped behind me. \u201cStand still, Sassenach.\u201d</p><p>I hadn\u2019t time to respond to this piece of gratuitous advice before a heavy stone whizzed past my hip and struck the snake amidships. It sprang into something resembling a Gordian knot, squirmed, writhed\u2014and fell into the privy, where it landed with a nasty sort of hollow thwuck!</p><p>I didn\u2019t wait to congratulate the victorious warrior, but instead turned and ran for the nearest patch of woods, the dew-wet hem of my nightgown slapping round my ankles.</p><p>Returning a few minutes later in a more settled frame of mind, I found Jamie and Young Ian squeezed into the privy together\u2014a tight fit, considering their sizes\u2014the latter squatting on the bench with a pine-knot torch as the former bent over the hole, peering into the depths beneath.</p><p>\u201cCan they swim?\u201d Ian was asking, trying to see past Jamie\u2019s head without setting his uncle\u2019s hair on fire.</p><p>\u201cI dinna ken,\u201d Jamie replied dubiously. \u201cI think maybe so. What I want to know is, can they jump?\u201d</p><p>Ian jerked back, then laughed a little nervously, not altogether sure that Jamie was joking.</p><p>\u201cHere, I canna see a thing; hand me the light.\u201d Jamie reached up to take the splinter of pine from Ian, and lowered it gingerly into the hole.</p><p>\u201cIf the stink doesna put the flame out, belike we\u2019ll burn down the privy,\u201d he muttered, bending low. \u201cNow, then, where the devil\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere it is! I see it!\u201d Ian cried.</p><p>Both heads jerked, and cracked together with the sound of splitting melons. Jamie dropped the torch, which fell into the hole and was promptly extinguished. A thin wisp of smoke drifted up from the rim of the hole, like incense.</p><p>Jamie staggered out of the privy, hands clutching his forehead, eyes squeezed shut with pain. Young Ian leaned against the inside wall, hands pressed tightly over the crown of his head, making abrupt and breathless remarks in Gaelic.</p><p>\u201cIs it still alive?\u201d I asked anxiously, peering toward the privy.</p><p>Jamie opened one eye and regarded me under the clutching fingers.</p><p>\u201cOh, my head\u2019s fine, thanks,\u201d he said. \u201cI expect my ears will ha\u2019 quit ringing by next week, sometime.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow, now,\u201d I said soothingly. \u201cIt would take a sledgehammer to dent your skull. Let me look, though.\u201d I pushed his fingers aside and pulled his head down, feeling gently through the thick hair. There was a small bruised spot just above the hairline, but no blood.</p><p>I kissed the spot perfunctorily and patted him on the head.</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t die,\u201d I said. \u201cNot from that, anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, good,\u201d he said dryly. \u201cI\u2019d much rather die of snakebite next time I sit down to my business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a poisonous serpent, is it?\u201d Ian asked, letting go of his head and coming out of the privy. He inhaled deeply, filling his thin chest with fresh air.</p><p>\u201cVenemous,\u201d Jamie corrected him. \u201cIf it bites you and makes ye sick, it\u2019s venemous; if you bite it and it makes ye sick, it\u2019s poisonous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, aye,\u201d Ian said, dismissing this pedantry. \u201cIt\u2019s a wicked snake, though?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery wicked,\u201d I said, with a slight shudder. \u201cWhat are you going to do about it?\u201d I asked, turning to Jamie.</p><p>He raised one eyebrow.</p><p>\u201cMe? Why ought I to do anything about it?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t just let him stay in there!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d he said, raising the other brow.</p><p>Ian scratched his head absently, winced as he encountered the lump left by his collision with Jamie, and stopped.</p><p>\u201cWell, I dinna ken, Uncle Jamie,\u201d he said dubiously. \u201cIf ye want to let your balls hang over a pit wi\u2019 a deadly viper in it, that\u2019s your concern, but the notion makes my flesh creep a bit. How big\u2019s the thing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFair-sized, I\u2019ll admit.\u201d Jamie flexed his wrist, showing his forearm by way of comparison.</p><p>\u201cEeugh!\u201d said Ian.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know they don\u2019t jump,\u201d I put in helpfully.</p><p>\u201cAye, I do.\u201d Jamie eyed me cynically. \u201cStill, I grant ye, the thought\u2019s enough to make one a bit costive. How d\u2019ye mean to get him out, though?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could shoot him wi\u2019 your pistol,\u201d Ian offered, brightening at the thought of getting his hands on Jamie\u2019s treasured pistols. \u201cWe needn\u2019t get him out if we can kill him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs he...ah...visible?\u201d I put in delicately.</p><p>Jamie rubbed his chin dubiously. He hadn\u2019t shaved yet, and the dark red bristles rasped under his thumb.</p><p>\u201cNot very. There\u2019s no more than a few inches o\u2019 filth in the pit, but I shouldna think ye could see him well enough to aim, and I hate to waste the shot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe could invite all of the Hansens for dinner, serve beer, and drown him,\u201d I suggested facetiously, naming a nearby\u2014and very numerous\u2014Quaker family.</p><p>Ian erupted in giggles. Jamie gave me an austere sort of look, and turned toward the woods.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll think of something,\u201d he said. \u201cAfter my breakfast.\u201d</p><p>Breakfast was luckily no great problem, as the hens had helpfully provided me with nine eggs and the bread had risen satisfactorily. The butter was still immured in the back of the pantry, under the baleful guard of the newly-farrowed sow, but Ian had managed to lean in and snatch a pot of jam from the shelf as I stood by with the broom, jabbing it into the sow\u2019s gnashing jaws as she made little darting charges at Ian\u2019s legs.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have to have a new broom,\u201d I remarked, eyeing the tattered remains as I dished up the eggs. \u201cPerhaps I\u2019ll go up to the willow grove by the stream this morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmphm.\u201d Jamie reached out a hand and patted absently around on the table, searching for the bread plate. His attention was wholly focused on the book he was reading, Bricknell\u2019s Natural History of North Carolina.</p><p>\u201cHere it is,\u201d he said. \u201cI knew I\u2019d seen a bit about rattlesnakes.\u201d Locating the bread by feel, he took a piece and used it to scoop a healthy portion of egg into his mouth. Having engulfed this, he read aloud, holding the book in one hand while groping over the tabletop with the other.</p><p>\u201c \u2018The Indians frequently pull out the snakes\u2019 Teeth, so that they never afterwards can do any Mischief by biting; this may be easily done, by tying a bit of red Wollen Cloth to the upper end of a long hollow Cane, and so provoking the Rattle-Snake to bite, and suddenly pulling it away from him, by which means the Teeth stick fast in the Cloath, which are plainly to be seen by those present.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>\u201cHave we any red cloth, Auntie?\u201d Ian asked, washing down his own share of the eggs with chicory coffee.</p><p>I shook my head, and speared the last of the sausages before Jamie\u2019s groping hand reached it.</p><p>\u201cBlue, green, yellow, drab, white, and brown. No red.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a fine wee book, Uncle Jamie,\u201d Ian said, with approval. \u201cDoes it say more about the snakes?\u201d He looked hungrily over the expanse of table, in search of more food. Without comment, I reached into the hutch and brought out a plate of spoonbread, which I set before him. He sighed happily and waded in, as Jamie turned the page.</p><p>\u201cWell, here\u2019s a bit about how the rattlesnakes charm squirrels and rabbits.\u201d Jamie touched his plate, but encountered nothing save bare surface. I pushed the muffins toward him.</p><p>\u201c \u2018It is surprizing to observe how these Snakes will allure and charm Squirrels, Hedge-Conneys, Partridges and many other small Beasts and Birds to them, which they quickly devour. The Sympathy is so strong between these, that you shall see the Squirrel or Partridge (as they have espied this Snake) leap or fly from Bough to Bough, until at last they run or leap directly into its Mouth, not having power to avoid their Enemy, who never stirs out of the Posture or Quoil until he obtains his Prey.\u2019 \u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>His hand, blindly groping after sustenance, encountered the muffins. He picked one up and glanced up at me. \u201cDamned if I\u2019ve ever seen that, myself. D\u2019ye think it likely?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I said, pushing the curls back off my forehead. \u201cDoes that book have any helpful suggestions for dealing with vicious pigs?\u201d</p><p>He waved absently at me with the remnants of his muffin.</p><p>\u201cDinna fash,\u201d he murmured. \u201cI\u2019ll manage the pig.\u201d He took his eyes off the book long enough to glance over the table at the empty dishes. \u201cAre there no more eggs?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThere are, but I\u2019m taking them up to our guest at the corncrib.\u201d I added two slices of bread to the small basket I was packing, and took up the bottle of infusion I had left steeping overnight. The brew of goldenrod, bee-balm, and wild bergamot was a blackish green, and smelled like burnt fields, but it might help. It couldn\u2019t hurt. On impulse, I picked up the tied-feather amulet old Nayawenne had given me; perhaps it would reassure the sick man. Like the medicine, it couldn\u2019t hurt.</p><p>Our impromptu guest was a stranger; a Tuscarora from a northern village. He had come to the farm several days before, as part of a hunting party from Anna Ooka, on the trail of bear.</p><p>We had offered food and drink\u2014several of the hunters were Ian\u2019s friends\u2014but in the course of the meal I had noticed this man gazing glassy-eyed into his cup. Close examination had showed him to be suffering from what I was convinced was measles, an alarming disease in these days.</p><p>He had insisted on leaving with his companions, but two of them had brought him back a few hours later, stumbling and delirious.</p><p>He was plainly\u2014and alarmingly\u2014contagious. I had made him a comfortable bed in the newly built and so-far empty corncrib, and forced his companions to go and wash in the creek, a proceeding which they plainly found senseless, but in which they humored me before departing, leaving their comrade in my hands.</p> <p>The Indian was lying on his side, curled under his blanket. He didn\u2019t turn to look at me, though he must have heard my footsteps on the path. I could hear him, all right; no need for my makeshift stethoscope\u2014the rales in his lungs were clearly audible at six paces.</p><p>\u201cComment \u00e7a va?\u201d I said, kneeling down by him. He didn\u2019t answer; it was unnecessary, in any case. I didn\u2019t need anything beyond the rattling wheeze to diagnose pneumonia, and the look of him merely confirmed it\u2014eyes sunken and dull, the flesh of his face fallen away, consumed to the bone by the fierce blaze of fever.</p><p>I tried to persuade him to eat\u2014he desperately needed nourishment\u2014but he would not even bother to turn away his face. The water bottle by his side was empty; I had brought more but didn\u2019t give it to him right away, thinking he might swallow the infusion from sheer thirst.</p><p>He did take a few mouthfuls, but then stopped swallowing, merely allowing the greenish-black liquid to run out of the corners of his mouth. I tried coaxing in French, but he was having none of it; he didn\u2019t even acknowledge my presence, just stared past my shoulder at the morning sky.</p><p>His thin body sagged with despair; plainly he thought himself abandoned, left to die in the hands of strangers. I felt a gnawing anxiety that he might be right\u2014surely he would die if he would take nothing.</p><p>He would take water, at least. He drank thirstily, draining the bottle, and I went to the stream to fill it again. When I came back, I drew the amulet from my basket and held it up in front of his face. I thought I saw a flicker of surprise behind the half-closed lids\u2014nothing so strong as to be called hope, but he did at least take conscious notice of me for the first time.</p> <p>Seized by inspiration, I sank slowly down onto my knees. I had no notion at all of the proper ceremony to employ, but I had been a doctor long enough to know that while the power of suggestion was no substitute for antibiotics, it was certainly better than nothing.</p><p>I held up the raven\u2019s-feather amulet, turned my face skyward; and solemnly intoned the most sonorous thing I could remember, which happened to be Dr. Rawlings\u2019s receipt for the treatment of syphilis, rendered in Latin.</p><p>I poured a small bit of lavender oil into my hand, dipped the feather in it, and anointed his temples and throat, while singing \u201cBlow the Man Down,\u201d in a low, sinister voice. It might help the headache. His eyes were following the feather\u2019s movements; I felt rather like a rattlesnake charming away in its \u201cQuoil,\u201d waiting for a squirrel to run down my throat.</p><p>I picked up his hand, laid the oil-drabbled amulet across his palm, and closed his fingers round it. Then I took the jar of mentholated bear grease and painted mystic patterns on his chest, being careful to rub it well in with the balls of my thumbs. The reek cleared my sinuses; I could only hope it would help the patient\u2019s thick congestion.</p><p>I completed my ritual by solemnly blessing the bottle of infusion with \u201cIn nomine Patri, et Filii, et Spiritu Sancti, Amen.\u201d and presenting it to my patient\u2019s lips. Looking mildly hypnotized, he opened his mouth and obediently drank the rest.</p><p>I drew the blanket up around his shoulders, put the food I had brought down beside him, and left him, with mixed feelings of hope and fraudulence.</p><p>I walked slowly beside the stream, eyes alert as always for anything useful. It was too early in the year for most medicinals; for medicine, the older and tougher the plant, the better; several seasons of fighting off insects ensured a higher concentration of the active principles in their roots and stems.</p><p>Also, with many plants, it was the flower, fruit, or seed that yielded a useful substance, and while I\u2019d spotted clumps of turtlehead and lobelia sprouting in the mud along the path, those had long since gone to seed. I marked the locations carefully in my mind for future reference, and went on hunting.</p> <p>Watercress was abundant; patches of it floated among the rocks all along the margin of the stream, and a huge mat of the spicy dark green leaves lay temptingly just ahead. A nice patch of scouring rushes, too! I had come down barefoot, knowing I\u2019d be wading before long; I tucked up my skirts and ventured cautiously out into the stream, cutting knife in hand and basket over my arm, breath sucked in against the freezing chill.</p><p>My feet lost all feeling within moments\u2014but I didn\u2019t care. I quite forgot the snake in the privy, the pig in the pantry, and the Indian in the corncrib, absorbed in the rush of water past my legs, the wet, cold touch of stems and the breath of aromatic leaves.</p><p>Dragonflies hung in the patches of sunshine on the shallows, and minnows darted past, snatching gnats too small for me to see. A kingfisher called in a loud, dry rattle from somewhere upstream, but he was after larger prey. The minnows scattered at my intrusion but then swarmed back, gray and silver, green and gold, black marked with white, all insubstantial as the shadows from last year\u2019s leaves, floating on the water. Brownian motion, I thought, seeing puffs of silt float up and swirl around my ankles, obscuring the fish.</p><p>Everything moving, all of the time, down to the smallest molecule\u2014but in its movement, giving the paradoxical impression of stillness, small local chaos giving way to the illusion of a greater order overall.</p><p>I moved, too, taking my part in the stream\u2019s bright dance, feeling light and shadow change across my shoulders, toes searching for footholds among the slippery, half-seen rocks. My hands and feet were numb from the water; I felt as though I were half made of wood, yet intensely alive, like the silver birch that glowed above me, or the willows that trailed wet leaves in the pool below.</p><p>Perhaps the legends of green men and the myths of transformed nymphs began this way, I thought: not with trees come alive and walking, nor yet with women turned to wood\u2014but with submersion of warm human flesh into the colder sensations of the plants, chilled to slow awareness.</p><p>I could feel my heart beat slowly, and the half-painful throb of blood in my fingers. Sap rising. I moved with the rhythms of water and of wind, without haste or conscious thought, part of the slow and perfect order of the universe.</p><p>I had forgotten the bit about small local chaos.</p><p>Just as I came to the willows\u2019 bend, there was a loud shriek from beyond the trees. I\u2019d heard similar noises from a variety of animals, from catamounts to hunting eagles, but I knew a human voice when I heard one.</p><p>Blundering out of the stream, I shoved my way through the tangled branches, and burst through into the clear space beyond. A boy was dancing on the bank above me, slapping madly at his legs and howling as he hopped and fro.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2014?\u201d I began, and he glanced up at me, blue eyes wide with startlement at my sudden appearance.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t nearly as startled as I was. He was eleven or twelve; tall and thin as a pine sapling, with a mad tangle of thick russet hair. Slanted blue eyes stared at me from either side of a knife-bridged nose, familiar to me as the back of my own hand, though I knew I had never seen this child before.</p><p>My heart was somewhere in the vicinity of my tonsils, and the chill had shot up from my feet into the pit of my stomach. Trained to react in spite of shock, I managed to take in the rest of his appearance\u2014shirt and breeches of good quality, though splashed with water, and long pale shins blobbed with black clots like bits of mud.</p><p>\u201cLeeches,\u201d I said, professional calm descending by habit over personal tumult. It couldn\u2019t be, I was telling myself, at the same time that I knew it damn well was. \u201cIt\u2019s only leeches. They won\u2019t hurt you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know what they are!\u201d he said. \u201cGet them off me!\u201d He swatted at his calf, shuddering with dislike. \u201cThey\u2019re vile!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, not so terribly vile,\u201d I said, beginning to get a grip on myself. \u201cThey have their uses.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care what use they are!\u201d he bellowed, stamping in frustration. \u201cI hate them, get them off me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, stop whacking at them,\u201d I said sharply. \u201cSit you down and I\u2019ll take care of it.\u201d</p><p>He hesitated, glaring at me suspiciously, but reluctantly sat down on a rock, thrusting his leech-spattered legs out in front of him.</p><p>\u201cGet them off now!\u201d he demanded.</p><p>\u201cIn good time,\u201d I said. \u201cWhere did you come from?\u201d</p><p>He stared blankly at me.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t live near here,\u201d I said, with complete certainty. \u201cWhere did you come from?\u201d</p><p>He made an obvious effort to collect himself.</p><p>\u201cAh...we slept in a place called Salem, three nights past. That was the last town I saw.\u201d He wiggled his legs hard. \u201cGet them off, I say!\u201d</p><p>There were assorted methods of getting leeches off, most of them somewhat more damaging than the leeches themselves. I had a look; he\u2019d picked up four on one leg, three on the other. One of the fat little beasts was already near bloat, gone plump and shiny with stretching. I edged a thumbnail under its head and it popped off into my hand, round as a pebble and heavy with blood.</p><p>The boy stared it, pale under his tan, and shuddered.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t want to waste it,\u201d I said casually, and went to retrieve the basket I had dropped under the branches as I pushed my way through the trees.</p><p>Nearby, I saw his coat on the ground, discarded shoes and stockings with it. Simple buckles on the shoes, but silver, not pewter. Good broadcloth, not showy but cut with a deal more style than one saw anywhere north of Charleston. I hadn\u2019t really needed confirmation, but there it was. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I scooped up a handful of mud, pressed the leech gently into it and wrapped the gooey blob in wet leaves, only then noticing that my hands were trembling.

And God, what would Jamie do?</p><p>I came back to the boy, who was bent double, peering at the remaining leeches with a look of disgusted loathing. One more was close to dropping; as I knelt in front of him, it fell off, bouncing slightly on the damp ground.</p><p>\u201cAugh!\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s your stepfather?\u201d I asked abruptly. Few things could have taken his attention off his legs, but that did. His head jerked up and he stared at me in astonishment.</p> <p>It was a cool day, but a light dew of sweat shone on his face. It was narrower through cheek and temple, I thought, and the mouth was quite unlike; perhaps the resemblance was not really so pronounced as I thought.</p><p>\u201cHow do you know me?\u201d he asked, drawing himself up with an air of hauteur that would have been extremely funny under other circumstances.</p><p>\u201cAll I know about you is that your given name is William. Am I right?\u201d My hands curled at my sides, and I hoped I was wrong. If he was William, that wasn\u2019t quite all I knew about him, but it was plenty to be going on with.</p><p>A hot flush rose into his cheeks, and his eyes raked over me, his attention temporarily distracted from the leeches by being so familiarly addressed by what\u2014I suddenly realized\u2014appeared to be a disheveled beldame with her skirts round her thighs. Either he had good manners, or the disparity between my voice and my appearance made him cautious, because he swallowed the instant retort that came to his lips.</p><p>\u201cYes, it is,\u201d he said shortly, instead. \u201cWilliam, Viscount Ashness, ninth Earl of Ellesmere.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAll that?\u201d I said politely. \u201cGracious.\u201d I took hold of one leech between thumb and forefinger and pulled gently. The thing stretched out like a thick rubber band, but declined to let go. The boy\u2019s pale flesh pulled out, too, and he made a small choking sound.</p><p>\u201cLet go!\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019ll break, you\u2019ll break it!\u201d</p><p>\u201cCould do,\u201d I admitted. I got to my feet and shook down my skirts, putting myself in better order.</p><p>\u201cCome along,\u201d I said, offering him a hand. \u201cI\u2019ll take you to the house. If I sprinkle a bit of salt on them, they\u2019ll drop off at once.\u201d</p><p>He refused the hand, but got to his feet, a little shakily. He glanced around, as though looking for someone.</p><p>\u201cPapa,\u201d he explained, seeing my expression. \u201cWe missed the way, and he told me to wait by the stream while he made sure of our direction. I shouldn\u2019t like him to take alarm if I am not here when he returns.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI shouldn\u2019t worry,\u201d I said. \u201cI imagine he\u2019ll have found the house himself by this time; it isn\u2019t far.\u201d A fair guess, as it was the only house in some distance, and at the end of a well-marked trail. Lord John had plainly left the boy while he went ahead, to find Jamie\u2014and warn him. Very thoughtful. My lips tightened involuntarily.</p><p>\u201cWill that be Frasers\u2019?\u201d the boy asked. He took a ginger step, spraddling so as not to allow his legs to rub together. \u201cWe had come to see a James Fraser.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Mrs. Fraser,\u201d I said, and smiled at him. Your stepmother, I might have added\u2014but didn\u2019t. \u201cCome along.\u201d</p><p>He followed me through the scrim of trees toward the house, almost treading on my heels in his haste. I kept tripping over tree roots and half-buried stones, not watching where I was going, fighting the overwhelming urge to turn around and stare at him. If William, Viscount Ashness, ninth Earl of Ellesmere, was not the very last person I had ever expected to see in the backwoods of North Carolina, he was certainly next to the last\u2014King George was a trifle less likely to turn up on the doorstep, I supposed.</p><p>What had possessed that...that...I groped about, trying to choose among several discreditable epithets to apply to Lord John Grey, and gave up the struggle, in favor of trying to think what in heaven\u2019s name to do. I gave that up, too; there wasn\u2019t a thing I could do.</p><p>William, Viscount Ashness, ninth Earl of Ellesmere. Or he thought he was. And just what do you propose to do, I thought silently and savagely toward Lord John Grey, when he finds out that he\u2019s really the bastard son of a pardoned Scottish criminal? And more important\u2014what\u2019s the Scottish criminal going to do? or feel?</p><p>I stopped, causing the boy to stumble as he tried to avoid crashing into me.</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d I murmured. \u201cThought I saw a snake,\u201d and went on, the thought that had stopped me in my tracks still knotting my midsection like a dose of bitter apples. Could Lord John have brought the boy on purpose to reveal his parentage? Did he mean to leave him here, with Jamie\u2014with us?</p> <p>Alarming as I found the notion, I couldn\u2019t reconcile it with the man I had met in Jamaica. I might have sound reasons for disliking John Grey\u2014always difficult to feel a warm sense of goodwill toward a man with a professed homosexual passion for one\u2019s husband, after all\u2014but I had to admit that I had seen no trace of either recklessness or cruelty in his character. On the contrary, he had struck me as a sensitive, kindly, and honorable man\u2014or at least he had, before I\u2019d found out about his predilections toward Jamie.</p><p>Could something have happened? Some threat to the boy that made Lord John fear for his safety? Surely no one could have found out the truth about William\u2014no one knew, save Lord John and Jamie. And me, of course, I added as an afterthought. Without the evidence of the resemblance\u2014again I repressed the urge to turn round and stare at him\u2014there was no reason for anyone ever to suspect.</p><p>But see them side by side, and\u2014well, I shortly would see them side by side. The thought gave me a queer hollowness beneath the breastbone, half fright and half anticipation. Was it really as strong as I thought, that resemblance?</p><p>I took a deliberate quick detour, through a clump of low-hanging dogwood, making an excuse to turn and wait for him. He came through after me, ducking awkwardly to retrieve the silver-buckled shoe he had dropped.</p><p>No, I thought, watching covertly as he straightened up, face flushed from bending. It wasn\u2019t as strong as I\u2019d thought at first. He had the promise of Jamie\u2019s bones, but it wasn\u2019t all there yet\u2014he had the outlines, but not yet the substance. He would be very tall\u2014that was obvious\u2014but now he was about my height, gawky and slender, his limbs very long, and thin enough to seem almost delicate.</p><p>He was much darker than Jamie, too; while his hair glinted red in the shafts of sunlight that came through the branches, it was a deep chestnut, nothing like Jamie\u2019s bright red-gold, and his skin had turned a soft golden brown in the sun, not at all like Jamie\u2019s half-burnt bronze.</p><p>He had the Frasers\u2019 slanted cat-eyes, though, and there was something about the set of his head, the c*ck of the slender shoulders, that made me think of\u2014</p><p>Bree. It hit me with a small shock, like a spark of electricity. He did look quite a bit like Jamie, but it was my memories of Brianna that had caused that jolt of instant recognition when I saw him. Only ten years her junior, the childish outlines of his face were much more similar to hers than to Jamie\u2019s.</p><p>He had paused to disentangle a long strand of hair from a grappling dogwood branch; now he came up with me, one brow raised inquiringly.</p><p>\u201cIs it far?\u201d he asked. The color had come back to his face with the exertion of walking, but he still looked a trifle sick, and kept his eyes averted from his legs.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I said. I motioned toward the chestnut grove. \u201cJust there. Look; you can see the smoke from the chimney.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t wait to be led, but set off with dogged speed, anxious to be rid of the leeches.</p><p>I followed him quickly, not wanting him to reach the cabin ahead of me. I was prey to a mixture of the most disquieting sensations; uppermost was anxiety for Jamie, a little lower, anger at John Grey. Below that, an intense curiosity. And at the bottom, far enough down that I could almost pretend it wasn\u2019t there, was a pang of sharp longing for my daughter, whose face I had never thought to see again.</p><p>Jamie and Lord John were sitting on the bench by the door; at the sound of our steps, Jamie rose and looked toward the wood. He\u2019d had time to prepare himself; his glance passed casually over the boy as he turned to me.</p><p>\u201cOh, Claire. Ye\u2019ve found the other of our visitors, then. I\u2019d sent Ian down to find ye. Ye\u2019ll recall Lord John, I expect?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow could I forget?\u201d I said, giving his lordship a particularly bright smile. His mouth twitched slightly, but he kept a straight face as he bowed deeply in my direction. How did a man stay so impeccably groomed after several days on horseback, sleeping in the woods?</p><p>\u201cYour servant, Mrs. Fraser.\u201d He glanced at the boy, frowning slightly at his state of undress. \u201cMay I present my stepson, Lord Ellesmere? And William, as I see you have made the acquaintance of our gracious hostess, will you also make your compliments to our host, Captain Fraser?\u201d</p><p>The boy was shifting from foot to foot, nearly dancing on his toes. At this prompting, though, he jerked a quick bow in Jamie\u2019s direction.</p><p>\u201cYour servant, Captain,\u201d he said, then cast an agonized glance at me, plainly conscious of nothing but the fact that more of his blood was being sucked out by the second.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll excuse us?\u201d I said politely, and taking the boy by the arm, led him into the cabin and shut the door firmly in the astonished faces of the men. William sat immediately on the stool I pointed out, and thrust out his legs, trembling.</p><p>\u201cHurry!\u201d he said. \u201cOh, please, do hurry!\u201d</p><p>There was no salt ground; I took my digging knife and chipped a piece from the block with reckless haste, dropped it into my mortar, and smashed it into granules with a few quick jabs of the pestle. Crumbling the grains between my fingers, I scattered the salt thickly on each leech.</p><p>\u201cRather hard on the poor old leeches,\u201d I said, seeing the first draw itself slowly up into a ball. \u201cStill, it does the trick.\u201d The leech let go its grip and tumbled off William\u2019s leg, followed in similar fashion by its fellows, who writhed in slow-motion agony on the floor.</p><p>I scooped up the tiny bodies and flung them into the fire, then knelt in front of him, tactfully keeping my head bent while he got control of his face.</p><p>\u201cHere, let me take care of the bites.\u201d Tiny streams of blood ran down his legs; I dabbed them with a clean cloth, then washed the small wounds with vinegar and St.-John\u2019s-wort to stop the bleeding.</p><p>He let out a deep and tremulous sigh of relief as I dried his shins. \u201cIt\u2019s not that I\u2019m afraid of\u2014of blood,\u201d he said, in a tone of bravado that made it apparent that that was precisely what he was afraid of. \u201cIt\u2019s only they\u2019re such filthy creatures.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNasty little things,\u201d I agreed. I stood up, took a clean cloth, dipped it in water, and matter-of-factly wiped his smudged face. Then, without asking, I picked up my hairbrush and began to comb out the snarls of his hair.</p><p>He looked utterly startled at this familiarity, but beyond an initial stiffening of his spine, made no protest, and as I began to order his hair, he let out another small sigh, and let his shoulders slump a little. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>His skin had a pleasant animal heat, and my fingers, still chilly from the stream, warmed comfortably as I ordered the soft strands of silky chestnut hair. It was very thick, and slightly wavy. On the crown of his head was a cowlick, a delicate whorl that gave me mild vertigo to see; Jamie had the same cowlick, in the same place.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve lost my ribbon,\u201d he said, looking vaguely round, as though one might materialize from bread hutch or inkwell.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s all right; I\u2019ll lend you one.\u201d I finished plaiting his hair and tied it with a scrap of yellow ribbon, feeling as I did so an odd sense of protectiveness.</p><p>I had learned of his existence only a few years earlier, and if I had thought of him in the meantime at all, had felt no more than a minor sense of curiosity tinged with resentment. But now something\u2014be it his resemblance to my own child, his resemblance to Jamie, or simply the fact that I had taken care of him in some small way\u2014had given me a strange feeling of almost proprietary concern for him.</p> <p>I could hear the rumble of voices outside; the sound of a sudden laugh, and my annoyance at John Grey came back with a rush. How dare he risk both Jamie and William\u2014and for what? Why was the bloody man here, in a wilderness as blatantly unsuited to someone of his sort as a\u2014</p><p>The door opened, and Jamie poked his head in.</p><p>\u201cWill ye be all right?\u201d he asked. His eyes rested on the boy, an expression of polite concern on his face, but I saw his hand, curled tight as it rested on the door frame, and the line of tension that ran through leg and shoulder. He was strung like a harp; if I had touched him, he would have given off a low twanging noise.</p><p>\u201cQuite all right,\u201d I said pleasantly. \u201cWould Lord John care for some refreshment, do you think?\u201d</p><p>I put the kettle on to boil for tea, and\u2014with an inner sigh\u2014took out the last loaf of bread, which I had meant to use for my next round of penicillin experiments. Feeling that the emergency justified it, I brought out the last bottle of brandy as well. Then I put the jampot on the table, explaining that the butter was unfortunately in the custody of the pig at the moment.</p> <p>\u201cPig?\u201d said William, looking confused.</p><p>\u201cIn the pantry,\u201d I said, with a nod at the closed door.</p><p>\u201cWhy do you keep\u2014\u201d he started, then sat up sharply and closed his mouth, having obviously been kicked under the table by his stepfather, who was smiling pleasantly over his cup.</p><p>\u201cIt is very kind of you to receive us, Mrs. Fraser,\u201d Lord John interjected, giving his stepson a warning eye. \u201cI do apologize for our unexpected arrival; I hope we do not discommode you too greatly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot at all,\u201d I said, wondering just where we were going to put them to sleep. William could go to the shed with Ian, I supposed; it was no worse than sleeping rough, as he had been doing. But the thought of sharing a bed with Jamie, with Lord John on the trundle an arm\u2019s-length away...</p><p>Ian, with his usual instinct for mealtimes, appeared at this delicate point in the proceedings, and was introduced all round, with such a confusion of explanations and reciprocal bowing in cramped quarters that the teapot was knocked over.</p> <p>Using this minor disaster as an excuse, I sent Ian off to show William the attractions of wood and stream, with a packet of jam sandwiches and a bottle of cider to share between them. Then, free of their inhibiting presences, I filled the cups with brandy, sat down again, and fixed John Grey with a narrow eye.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d I said, without preamble.</p><p>He opened his light blue eyes very wide, then lowered his very long lashes and batted them deliberately at me.</p><p>\u201cI did not come with the intention of seducing your husband, I assure you,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cJohn!\u201d Jamie\u2019s fist struck the table with a force that rattled the teacups. His cheekbones were flushed dark red, and he was scowling with embarrassed fury.</p><p>\u201cSorry.\u201d Grey, by contrast, had gone white, though he remained otherwise visibly unruffled. It occurred to me for the first time that he might possibly be as unnerved as Jamie by this meeting.</p><p>\u201cMy apologies, ma\u2019am,\u201d he said, with a curt nod in my direction. \u201cThat was unforgivable. I would point out, however, that you have been looking at me since we met as though you had encountered me lying in the gutter outside some notorious mollyhouse.\u201d A light flush burned over his face now, too.</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d I breathed. \u201cGive me a bit more notice next time, and I\u2019ll take care to adjust my features.\u201d</p> <p>He stood up suddenly and went to the window, where he stood with his back to the room, hands braced on the sill. There was an exceedingly awkward silence. I didn\u2019t want to look at Jamie; instead I affected great interest in a bottle of fennel seeds that stood on the table.</p><p>\u201cMy wife has died,\u201d he said abruptly. \u201cOn the ship between England and Jamaica. She was coming to join me there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am sorry to hear of it,\u201d Jamie said quietly. \u201cThe lad will have been with her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Lord John turned back, leaning against the sill, so that the spring sunlight silhouetted his neat head and gave him a gleaming halo. \u201cWillie was\u2014very close to Isobel. She was the only mother he\u2019d known since his birth.\u201d</p><p>Willie\u2019s true mother, Geneva Dunsany, had died in giving birth to him; his presumed father, the Earl of Ellesmere, had died the same day, in an accident. So much, Jamie had already told me. Likewise, that Geneva\u2019s sister, Isobel, had taken care of the orphaned boy, and that John Grey had married Isobel when Willie was six or so\u2014at the time Jamie had left the Dunsanys\u2019 employ.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m very sorry,\u201d I said, sincerely, and didn\u2019t mean only the death of his wife.</p><p>Grey glanced at me, and gave me the shadow of a nod in acknowledgment.</p><p>\u201cMy appointment as governor was nearly at an end; I had intended perhaps to take up residence on the island, should the climate suit my family. As it was...\u201d He shrugged.</p><p>\u201cWillie was grief-stricken by the loss of his mother; it seemed advisable to seek to distract his mind by whatever means I could. An opportunity presented itself almost at once; my wife\u2019s estate includes a large property in Virginia, which she had bequeathed to William. Upon her death, I received inquiries from the factor of the plantation, asking for instruction.\u201d</p><p>He moved away from the window, coming slowly back toward the table where we sat.</p><p>\u201cI could not well decide what to do with the property without seeing it, and evaluating the conditions that obtain here. So I determined that we should sail to Charleston, and from there, travel overland to Virginia. I trusted to the novelty of the experience to divert William from his grief\u2014which I am pleased to observe, it seems to have done. He has been much more cheerful these past weeks.\u201d</p><p>I opened my mouth to say that Fraser\u2019s Ridge seemed a bit out of his way, regardless, but then thought better of it.</p><p>He appeared to guess what I was thinking, for he gave me a brief wry smile. I really would have to do something about my face, I thought. Having Jamie read my thoughts was one thing, and not at all unpleasant, on the whole. Having total strangers walk in and out of my mind at will was something else.</p><p>\u201cWhere is the plantation?\u201d Jamie asked, with somewhat more tact but the same implication.</p><p>\u201cThe nearest town of any sort is called Lynchburg\u2014on the James River.\u201d Lord John looked at me, still wry, but apparent good humor restored. \u201cIt is in fact no more than a few days deviation in our journey to come here, in spite of the remoteness of your aerie.\u201d</p><p>He switched his attention to Jamie, frowning slightly.</p><p>\u201cI told Willie that you are an old acquaintance of mine, from my soldiering days\u2014I trust you do not object to the deception?\u201d</p><p>Jamie shook his head, one side of his mouth turning up a bit. \u201cDeception, is it? I shouldna think I could well mind what ye called me, under the circumstances. And so far as that bit goes, it\u2019s true enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t think he\u2019ll remember you?\u201d I asked Jamie. He had been a groom on Willie\u2019s home estate; a prisoner of war following the Jacobite Rising.</p><p>He hesitated, but then shook his head.</p><p>\u201cI dinna think so. He was barely six when I left Helwater; that will be half a lifetime ago, to a lad\u2014and a world away. And there\u2019s no reason he should think to recall a groom named MacKenzie, let alone connect the name wi\u2019 me.\u201d</p><p>Willie hadn\u2019t recognized Jamie on sight, certainly, but then he had been too concerned with the leeches to take much notice of anyone. A thought struck me, and I turned to Lord John, who was fiddling with a snuffbox he had taken from his pocket.</p><p>\u201cTell me,\u201d I said, moved by a sudden impulse. \u201cI don\u2019t mean to distress you\u2014but...do you know how your wife died?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d He looked startled at the question, but collected himself at once. \u201cShe died of a bloody flux, so her maid said.\u201d His mouth twisted slightly. \u201cIt was...not a pleasant death, I believe.\u201d Bloody flux, eh? That was the standard description for anything from amebic dysentery to cholera.</p><p>\u201cWas there a doctor? Someone on board who took care of her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere was,\u201d he said, a little sharply. \u201cWhat do you imply, ma\u2019am?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d I said. \u201cIt\u2019s only that I wondered whether perhaps that was where Willie saw leeches used.\u201d</p><p>A flicker of understanding crossed his face.</p><p>\u201cOh, I see. I hadn\u2019t thought\u2014\u201d</p><p>At this point, I noticed Ian, who was hovering in the doorway, obviously reluctant to interrupt but with a marked look of urgency on his face.</p><p>\u201cDid you want something, Ian?\u201d I asked, interrupting Lord John.</p><p>He shook his head, brown hair flying.</p><p>\u201cNo, I thank ye, Auntie. It\u2019s only\u2014\u201d He cast a helpless glance at Jamie. \u201cWell, I\u2019m sorry, Uncle, I ken I shouldna ha\u2019 let him do it, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Alarmed by Ian\u2019s tone of voice, Jamie was already on his feet. \u201cWhat have ye done?\u201d</p><p>The lad twisted his big hands together, cracking his knuckles in embarrassment.</p><p>\u201cWell, ye see, his Lordship asked for the privy, and so I told him about the snake, and that he\u2019d best go into the wood instead. So he did, but then he wanted to see the snake, and...and...\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not bitten?\u201d Jamie asked anxiously. Lord John, who had obviously been about to ask the same thing, gave him a glance.</p><p>\u201cOh, no!\u201d Ian looked surprised. \u201cWe couldna see it to start with, because it was too dark below. So we lifted off the benchtop to get more light. We could see the serpent fine, then, and we poked at it a bit wi\u2019 a long branch, so it was lashin\u2019 to and fro like the wee book said, but it didna seem inclined to bite itself. And\u2014and\u2014\u201d He darted a glance at Lord John, and swallowed audibly.</p><p>\u201cIt was my fault,\u201d he said, nobly squaring his shoulders, the better to accept blame. \u201cI said as how I\u2019d thought to shoot it earlier, but we didna want to waste the powder. And so his Lordship said as how he would fetch his papa\u2019s pistol from the saddlebag and deal with the thing at once. And so\u2014\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIan,\u201d said Jamie between his teeth. \u201cStop blethering this instant and tell me straight what ye\u2019ve done wi\u2019 the lad. Ye\u2019ve not shot him by mistake, I hope?\u201d</p><p>Ian looked offended at this slur upon his marksmanship.</p><p>\u201cOf course not!\u201d he said.</p><p>Lord John coughed politely, forestalling further recriminations.</p> <p>\u201cPerhaps you would be good enough to tell me the whereabouts of my son at this moment?\u201d</p><p>Ian took a deep breath and visibly commended his soul to God.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s in the bottom of the privy,\u201d he said. \u201cHave ye got a bit o\u2019 rope, Uncle Jamie?\u201d</p><p>With an admirable economy of both words and motion, Jamie reached the door in two strides and disappeared, closely followed by Lord John.</p><p>\u201cIs he in there with the snake?\u201d I asked, hastily scrabbling through the washbasket for something to use as a tourniquet, just in case.</p> <p>\u201cOh, no, Auntie,\u201d Ian assured me. \u201cYe dinna think I\u2019d have left him, and the serpent was still there? Maybe I\u2019d best go help,\u201d he added, and disappeared as well.</p><p>I hurried after him, to find Jamie and Lord John standing shoulder to shoulder in the doorway of the privy, conversing with the depths. Standing on tiptoe to peer over Lord John\u2019s shoulder, I saw the torn butt end of a long, slender hickory branch protruding a few inches above the edge of the oblong hole. I held my breath; Lord Ellesmere\u2019s struggles had stirred up the contents of the privy, and the reek was enough to sear the cilia off my nasal membranes.</p><p>\u201cHe says he\u2019s not hurt,\u201d Jamie assured me, turning away from the hole and unlimbering a coil of rope from his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d I said. \u201cWhere\u2019s the snake, though?\u201d I peeked nervously into the outhouse, but couldn\u2019t see anything beyond the silvery cedar boards and the dark recesses of the pit.</p><p>\u201cIt went that way,\u201d Ian said, gesturing vaguely down the path by which I had come. \u201cThe laddie couldna quite get a clear shot, so I gave the thing a wee snoove wi\u2019 the stick, and damned if the bugger didna turn and come at me, right up the branch! It scairt me so I let out a skelloch and let go, and I bumped the lad, and\u2014well, that\u2019s how it happened,\u201d he ended lamely.</p><p>Trying to avoid Jamie\u2019s eye, he sidled toward the pit and, leaning over, yelled awkwardly, \u201cHey! I\u2019m glad ye didna break your neck!\u201d</p> <p>Jamie gave him a look that said rather plainly that if necks were to be broken...but forbore further remarks in the interests of extracting William promptly from his oubliette. This procedure was carried out without further incident, and the would-be marksman was lifted out, clinging to the rope like a caterpillar on a string.</p><p>There had luckily been enough sewage in the bottom of the pit to break his fall. From appearances, the ninth Earl of Ellesmere had landed facedown. Lord John stood for a moment on the path, wiping his hands on his breeches and surveying the encrusted object before him. He rubbed the back of a hand over his mouth, trying either to hide a smile or to stifle his sense of smell.</p><p>Then his shoulders started to shake.</p><p>\u201cWhat news from the Underworld, Persephone?\u201d he said, unable to keep the quaver of laughter out of his voice.</p><p>A pair of slanted eyes looked blue murder out of the mask of filth obscuring his Lordship\u2019s features. It was a thoroughly Fraser expression, and I felt a qualm go through me at the sight. By my side, Ian gave a sudden start. He glanced quickly from the Earl to Jamie and back, then he caught my eye and his own face went perfectly and unnaturally blank.</p><p>Jamie was saying something in Greek, to which Lord John replied in the same language, whereupon both men laughed like loons. Trying to ignore Ian, I bent an eye in Jamie\u2019s direction. Shoulders still shaking with suppressed mirth, he saw fit to enlighten me.</p><p>\u201cEpicharmus,\u201d he explained. \u201cAt the Oracle of Delphi, seekers after enlightenment would throw down a dead python into the pit, and then hang about, breathing in the fumes as it decayed.\u201d</p><p>Lord John declaimed, gesturing grandly. \u201c \u2018The spirit toward the heavens, the body to the earth.\u2019 \u201d</p> <p>William exhaled strongly through his nose, precisely as Jamie did when tried beyond bearing. Ian twitched beside me. Good grief, I thought, freshly unnerved. Does the boy have nothing from his mother?</p><p>\u201cAnd have you attained any spiritual insights as a result of your recent m-mystical experience, William?\u201d Lord John asked, making a poor attempt at self-control. He and Jamie were both flushed, with a laughter that I thought due as much to the release of nervous tension as to brandy or hilarity.</p><p>His Lordship, glowering, pulled off his neckcloth and flung it on the path with a soggy splat. Now Ian was giggling nervously, too, unable to help himself. My own belly muscles were quivering under the strain, but I could see that the patches of exposed flesh above William\u2019s collar were the color of the ripe tomatoes by the privy. Knowing all too well what usually happened to a Fraser who reached that particular level of incandescence, I thought the time had come to break up the party.</p><p>\u201cEr-hem,\u201d I said, clearing my throat. \u201cIf you will allow me, gentlemen? Unlearned as I am in Greek philosophy, there is one small epigram I know by heart.\u201d</p><p>I handed William the jar of lye soap I had brought in lieu of a tourniquet.</p><p>\u201cPindar,\u201d I said. \u201c \u2018Water is best.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>A small flash of what might have been gratitude showed through the muck. His Lordship bowed to me, with utmost correctness, then turned, gave Ian a fishy stare, and stomped off through the grass toward the creek, dripping. He seemed to have lost his shoes.</p><p>\u201cPuir clarty bugger,\u201d Ian said, shaking his head mournfully. \u201cIt\u2019ll be days before he gets the stink off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo doubt.\u201d Lord John\u2019s lips were still twitching, but the urge to declaim Greek poetry seemed to have left him, replaced by less elevated concerns. \u201cDo you know what has become of my pistol, by the way? The one William was using before his unfortunate accident?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Ian looked uncomfortable. He lifted his chin in the direction of the privy. \u201cI...ah...well, I\u2019m verra much afraid\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d Lord John rubbed his own immaculately barbered chin.</p><p>Jamie fixed Ian with a long stare.</p><p>\u201cAh...\u201d said Ian, backing up a pace or two.</p><p>\u201cGet it,\u201d said Jamie, in a tone that brooked no contradiction.</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d said Ian.</p><p>\u201cNow,\u201d said his uncle, and dropped the slimy rope at his feet.</p><p>Ian\u2019s Adam\u2019s apple bobbed, once. He looked at me, wide-eyed as a rabbit.</p><p>\u201cTake your clothes off first,\u201d I said helpfully. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to have to burn them, do we?\u201d</p><p>26</p><p>PLAGUE AND PESTILENCE</p><p>I left the house just before sunset, to check on my patient in the corncrib. He was no better, but neither was he visibly worse; the same labored breathing and burning fever. This time, though, the sunken eyes met mine when I entered the shed, and stayed on my face as I examined him.</p><p>He still had the raven\u2019s-feather amulet, clutched in his hand. I touched it and smiled at him, then gave him a drink. He still would take no food but had a little milk, and swallowed without protest another dose of my febrifuge. He lay motionless through examination and feeding, but as I was wringing out a hot cloth to poultice his chest, he suddenly reached out a hand and grabbed my arm.</p><p>He thumped his chest with his other hand, and made an odd humming noise. This puzzled me for a moment, until I realized that he was humming.</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d I said. I reached for the packet of poulticing herbs and folded them into the cloth. \u201cWell, all right then. Let me think.\u201d</p><p>I settled on \u201cOnward, Christian Soldiers,\u201d which he appeared to like\u2014I was obliged to sing it through three times before he seemed satisfied and sank back on his blanket with a small spate of coughing, wrapped in camphor fumes.</p><p>I paused outside the house, cleansing my hands carefully with the bottle of alcohol I carried. I was sure I was safe from contagion\u2014I had had measles as a child\u2014but wanted to take no chance of infecting anyone else.</p><p>\u201cThere was talk of an outbreak of the red measle in Cross Creek,\u201d Lord John remarked, upon my reporting to Jamie the condition of our guest. \u201cIs it true, Mrs. Fraser, that the savage is congenitally less able to withstand infection than are Europeans, while African slaves are yet more hardy than their masters?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDepends on the infection,\u201d I said, peering into the cauldron and giving the stew bottle a cautious poke. \u201cThe Indians are a lot more resistant to the parasitic diseases\u2014malaria, say\u2014caused by organisms here, and the Africans deal better with things like dengue fever\u2014which came with them from Africa, after all. But the Indians haven\u2019t much resistance to European plagues like smallpox and syphilis, no.\u201d</p><p>Lord John looked a bit taken aback, which gave me a small sense of satisfaction; evidently he had only asked out of courtesy\u2014he hadn\u2019t actually expected me to know anything.</p><p>\u201cHow fascinating,\u201d he said, though, sounding truly interested. \u201cYou refer to organisms? Do you then subscribe to Mister Evan Hunter\u2019s theory of miasmatical creatures?\u201d</p><p>Now it was my turn to be taken aback.</p><p>\u201cEr...not precisely, no,\u201d I said, and changed the subject.</p><p>We passed a pleasant enough evening, Jamie and Lord John exchanging anecdotes of hunting and fishing, with remarks on the amazing abundance of the countryside, while I darned stockings.</p><p>Willie and Ian had a game of chess, which the latter won, to his evident satisfaction. His Lordship yawned hugely, then catching his father\u2019s minatory eye, made a belated attempt to cover his mouth. He relaxed into a sleepy smile of contentment, brought on by repletion; he and Ian between them had demolished an entire currant cake, following their huge supper.</p><p>Jamie saw it, and cocked a brow at Ian, who obligingly rose and towed his Lordship away to share his pallet in the herb shed. Two down, I thought, keeping my eyes resolutely away from the bed\u2014and three to go.</p><p>In the event, the delicate problem of bedtime was solved by my retiring, cloaked in modesty\u2014or at least in my nightgown\u2014while Jamie and Lord John took over the chess table, drinking the last of the brandy by firelight.</p><p>Lord John was a much better chess player than I\u2014or so I deduced from the fact that the game took them a good hour. Jamie could normally beat me in twenty minutes flat. The play was mostly silent, though with brief spurts of conversation.</p><p>At last Lord John made a move, sat back and stretched, as though concluding something.</p><p>\u201cI collect you will not see much disturbance in the political way, here in your mountain refuge?\u201d he said casually. He squinted at the board, considering.</p><p>\u201cI do envy you, Jamie, removed from such petty difficulties as afflict the merchants and gentry of the lowlands. If your life has its hardships\u2014as cannot help but be the case\u2014you have the not inconsiderable consolation of knowing your struggles to be significant and heroic.\u201d</p><p>Jamie snorted briefly.</p><p>\u201cOh, aye. Verra heroic, to be sure. At the moment, my most heroic struggle is like to be with the pig in my pantry.\u201d He nodded toward the board, one eyebrow raised. \u201cYe really mean to make that move?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Grey narrowed his eyes at Jamie, then looked down, studying the board with pursed lips.</p><p>\u201cYes, I do,\u201d he answered firmly.</p><p>\u201cDamn,\u201d said Jamie, and with a grin, reached out and tipped over his king in resignation.</p><p>Grey laughed, and reached for the brandy bottle.</p> <p>\u201cDamn!\u201d he said in turn, finding it empty. Jamie laughed, and rising, went to the cupboard.</p><p>\u201cTry a bit of this,\u201d he said, and I heard the musical glug of liquid into a cup.</p><p>Grey lifted the cup to his nose, inhaled and sneezed explosively, scattering droplets over the table.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not wine, John,\u201d Jamie observed mildly. \u201cYe\u2019re meant to drink it, aye? not savor the bouquet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I noticed. Christ, what is it?\u201d Grey sniffed again, more cautiously, and essayed a trial sip. He choked, but swallowed gamely.</p> <p>\u201cChrist,\u201d he said again. His voice was hoarse. He coughed, cleared his throat, and set the cup gingerly on the table, eyeing it as though it might explode.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t tell me,\u201d he said. \u201cLet me guess. It\u2019s meant to be Scotch whisky?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn ten years or so, it might be,\u201d Jamie answered, pouring a small cupful for himself. He took a small sip, rolled it around his mouth and swallowed, shaking his head. \u201cAt the moment, it\u2019s alcohol, and that\u2019s as much as I\u2019d say for it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, it\u2019s that,\u201d Grey agreed, taking another very small sip. \u201cWhere did you get it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI made it,\u201d said Jamie, with the modest pride of a master brewer. \u201cI\u2019ve twelve barrels of the stuff.\u201d</p><p>Grey\u2019s fair brows shot up at that.</p> <p>\u201cAssuming that you don\u2019t mean to clean your boots with it, may I ask what you intend doing with twelve barrels of this?\u201d</p><p>Jamie laughed.</p><p>\u201cTrade it,\u201d he said. \u201cSell it, when I can. Customs tax and a license to brew spirits being one of the petty political concerns wi\u2019 which I am not afflicted, owing to our remoteness,\u201d he added ironically.</p><p>Lord John grunted, tried another sip, and set the cup down.</p><p>\u201cWell, you may well escape the Customs, I\u2019ll grant you\u2014the nearest agent is in Cross Creek. But I cannot say I think it a safe practice on that account. To whom, may I ask, are you selling this remarkable concoction? Not to the savages, I trust?\u201d</p><p>Jamie shrugged.</p><p>\u201cOnly verra small amounts\u2014a flask or two at a time, as a gift or in trade. Never more than would make one man drunk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery wise. You\u2019ll have heard the stories, I expect. I spoke with one man who\u2019d survived the massacre at Michilimackinac, during the war with the French. That was caused\u2014in part, at least\u2014by a great quantity of drink falling into the hands of a large gathering of Indians at the fort.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve heard about it, too,\u201d Jamie assured him dryly. \u201cBut we are on good terms wi\u2019 the Indians nearby, and there are none so many of them as all that. And I\u2019m careful, as I say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMm.\u201d He essayed another sip, and grimaced. \u201cI expect you risk more by poisoning one of them than by intoxicating a mob.\u201d He set the glass down and changed the subject.</p><p>\u201cI have heard talk in Wilmington of an unruly group of men called Regulators, who terrorize the backcountry and cause disruption by means of riot. Have you encountered anything of such nature here?\u201d</p><p>Jamie snorted briefly.</p><p>\u201cTerrorize what? Squirrels? There is the backcountry, John, and then there is the wilderness. Surely ye will have remarked the lack of human habitation on your journey here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did notice something of the kind,\u201d Lord John agreed. \u201cAnd yet I had heard certain rumors regarding your presence here\u2014that it was in part meant as a quelling influence upon the growth of lawlessness.\u201d</p><p>Jamie laughed.</p><p>\u201cI think it will be some time before there is much lawlessness for me to quell. Though I did go so far as to knock down an old German farmer who was abusing a young woman at the grain mill on the river. He had it in mind she had given him short weight\u2014which she had not\u2014and I couldna convince him otherwise. But that is my only attempt so far at maintaining public order.\u201d</p><p>Grey laughed, and picked up the fallen king.</p><p>\u201cI am relieved to hear it. Will you redeem your honor with another game? I cannot expect the same trick to work twice, after all.\u201d</p><p>I rolled onto my side, facing the wall, and stared sleeplessly at the timbers. The firelight glimmered on the wing-shaped marks of the ax, running along the length of each log, regular as sand ripples on a beach.</p><p>I tried to ignore the conversation going on behind me, to lose myself instead in the memory of Jamie hewing bark and squaring logs, of sleeping in his arms under the shelter of a half-built wall, feeling the house rise up around me, enclosing me in warmth and safety, the permanent embodiment of his embrace. I always felt safe and soothed by this vision, even when I was alone on the mountain, knowing I was protected by the house he had built for me. Tonight, though, it wasn\u2019t working.</p><p>I lay still, wondering exactly what was the matter with me. Or rather, not what, but why. I knew by now what it was, all right; it was jealousy.</p><p>I was indeed jealous; an emotion I hadn\u2019t felt for some years, and was appalled to feel now. I rolled onto my back and closed my eyes, trying to shut out the murmur of conversation.</p><p>Lord John had been nothing but courtesy itself to me. More than that, he had been intelligent, thoughtful\u2014thoroughly charming, in fact. And listening to him making intelligent, thoughtful, charming conversation with Jamie knotted my insides and made me clench my hands under cover of the quilt.</p><p>You are an idiot, I told myself savagely. What is the matter with you? I tried to relax, breathing deeply through my nose, eyes closed.</p><p>Part of it was Willie, of course. Jamie was very careful, but I had seen his expression when he looked at the boy in unguarded moments. His whole body was suffused with shy joy, pride mingled with diffidence; and it smote me to the heart to see it.</p><p>He would never look at Brianna, his firstborn, that way. Would never see her at all. That was hardly his fault\u2014and yet it seemed so unfair. At the same time, I could scarcely begrudge him his joy in his son\u2014and didn\u2019t, I told myself firmly. The fact that it gave me a terrible pang of longing to look at the boy, with that bold, handsome face that mirrored his sister\u2019s, was simply my problem. Nothing to do with Jamie, or with Willie. Or with John Grey, who\u2019d brought the boy here.</p><p>What for? That was what I\u2019d been thinking ever since I had recovered from the first shock of their appearance, and that was still what I was thinking. What in hell was the man up to?</p><p>The story about the estate in Virginia might be true\u2014or only an excuse. Even if it was true, it was a considerable detour to come to Fraser\u2019s Ridge. Why had he taken so much trouble to bring the boy here? And so much risk; Willie was clearly oblivious to the resemblance that even Ian had noticed, but what if he hadn\u2019t been? Had it been so important to Grey, to restate his claim on Jamie\u2019s obligation to him?</p><p>I rolled onto my other side and cracked an eyelid, watching them over the chessboard, redhead and fair head, bent together in absorption. Grey moved a knight and sat back, rubbing the back of his neck, smiling to himself at the effect of his move. He was a good-looking man; slight and fine-boned, but with a strong, clear-cut face and a beautiful, sensitive mouth that many a woman had no doubt envied.</p><p>Grey was even better at guarding his face than Jamie was; I hadn\u2019t yet seen an incriminating look from him. I\u2019d seen one once, though, in Jamaica, and wasn\u2019t in any doubt about the nature of his feelings for Jamie.</p><p>On the other hand, I wasn\u2019t in any doubt about Jamie\u2019s feelings in that regard, either. The knot under my heart eased a bit, and I took a deeper breath. No matter how late they sat up over the board, drinking and talking, it would be my bed Jamie came to.</p><p>I unclenched my fists, and it was then, as I rubbed my palms covertly against my thighs, that I realized with a shock just why Lord John affected me so strongly.</p><p>My fingernails had dug small crescents in my palms, a small line of throbbing half-moons. For years, I had rubbed away those crescents after every dinner party, every late night when Frank had \u201cworked at the office.\u201d For years, I had lain intermittently alone in a double bed, wide-awake in the darkness, nails digging into my hands, waiting for him to come back.</p><p>And he had. To his credit, he always did return before dawn. Sometimes to a back curled against him in cold reproach, sometimes to the furious challenge of a body thrust against him in demand, urging him wordlessly to deny it, to prove his innocence with his body\u2014trial by combat. More often than not, he accepted the challenge. But it didn\u2019t help.</p><p>Yet neither of us spoke of such things in the daylight. I could not; I had no right. Frank did not; he had revenge.</p><p>Sometimes it would be months\u2014even a year or more\u2014between episodes, and we would live in peace together. But then it would happen again; the silent phone calls, the too-excused absences, the late nights. Never anything so overt as another woman\u2019s perfume, or lipstick on his collar\u2014he had discretion. But I always felt the ghost of the other woman, whoever she was; some faceless, indistinguishable She.</p><p>I knew it didn\u2019t matter who it was\u2014there were several of them. The only important thing was that She was not me. And I would lie awake and clench my fists, the marks of my nails a small crucifixion.</p><p>The murmur of conversation by the fire had mostly ceased; the only sound the small click of the chessmen as they moved.</p><p>\u201cDo you feel yourself content?\u201d Lord John asked suddenly.</p><p>Jamie paused for a moment.</p><p>\u201cI have all that man could want,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cA place, and honorable work. My wife at my side. The knowledge that my son is safe and well cared for.\u201d He looked up then, at Grey. \u201cAnd a good friend.\u201d He reached over, clasped Lord John\u2019s hand, and let it go. \u201cI want no more.\u201d</p><p>I shut my eyes resolutely, and began to count sheep.</p><p>I was awakened just before dawn by Ian, crouching by my bedside.</p><p>\u201cAuntie,\u201d he said softly, a hand on my shoulder. \u201cBest ye come; the man in the corncrib\u2019s verra poorly.\u201d</p><p>I was on my feet by reflex, wrapped in my cloak and moving bare-footed after Ian before my mind had even begun to function consciously. Not that any great diagnostic skill was needed; I could hear the deep, rattling respirations from ten feet away.</p><p>The Earl hovered by the doorway, his thin face pale and scared in the gray light.</p><p>\u201cGo away,\u201d I told him sharply. \u201cYou mustn\u2019t be near him; nor you, Ian\u2014the two of you go to the house, fetch me hot water from the cauldron, my box, and clean rags.\u201d</p><p>Willie moved at once, eager to be away from the frightening sounds coming from the shed. Ian lingered, though, his face troubled.</p><p>\u201cI dinna think ye can help him, Auntie,\u201d he said quietly. His eyes met mine straight on, with an adult depth of understanding.</p><p>\u201cVery likely not,\u201d I said, answering him in the same terms. \u201cBut I can\u2019t do nothing.\u201d</p><p>He took a deep breath, nodded.</p><p>\u201cAye. But I think...\u201d He hesitated, then went on as I nodded, \u201cI think ye shouldna torment him wi\u2019 medicine. He\u2019s fixed to die, Auntie; we heard an owl in the night\u2014he will have heard it, too. It is a sign of death to them.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I glanced at the dark oblong of the door, biting my lip. The breaths were shallow and wheezing, with alarmingly long pauses between them. I looked back at Ian.</p><p>\u201cWhat do the Indians do, when someone is dying? Do you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSing,\u201d he said promptly. \u201cThe shaman puts paint upon her face, and sings the soul away to safety, so the demons dinna take it.\u201d</p><p>I hesitated, my instincts to do something at war with my conviction that action would be futile. Had I any right to deprive this man of peace in his dying? Worse, to alarm him into fear that his soul would be lost by my interference?</p> <p>Ian hadn\u2019t waited for the results of my dithering. He stooped and scraped up a small clot of earth, spat in it and stirred it to mud. Without comment, he dipped his forefinger into the puddle, and drew a line from my forehead down the bridge of my nose.</p><p>\u201cIan!\u201d</p><p>\u201cShh,\u201d he murmured, frowning in concentration. \u201cLike this, I think.\u201d He added two lines across each cheekbone, and a rough zigzag down the left side of my jawbone. \u201cThat\u2019s as near as I remember the proper way of it. I\u2019ve only seen it the once, and from a distance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIan, this isn\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShhh,\u201d he said again, laying a hand on my arm to quell protest. \u201cGo to him, Auntie. Ye willna frighten him; he\u2019s accustomed to ye, no?\u201d</p> <p>I rubbed away a drip from the end of my nose, feeling thoroughly idiotic. There was no time to argue, though. Ian gave me a small push, and I turned to the door. I stepped into the darkness of the corncrib, bent and laid a hand on the man. His skin was hot and dry, his hand limp as worn leather.</p><p>\u201cIan, can you talk to him? Say his name, tell him it\u2019s all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYe must not say his name, Auntie; it will call demons.\u201d</p><p>Ian cleared his throat, and said a few words in soft clicking gutterals. The hand in mine twitched slightly. My eyes had adjusted now, I could see the man\u2019s face, marked with a faint look of surprise as he saw my mud paint.</p><p>\u201cSing, Auntie,\u201d Ian urged, low-voiced. \u201cTantum ergo, maybe; it sounded a wee bit like that.\u201d</p><p>There was nothing else I could do, after all. Rather helplessly, I began.</p> <p>\u201cTantum ergo, sacramentum...\u201d</p><p>Within a few seconds, my voice steadied, and I sat back on my bare heels, singing slowly, holding his hand. The heavy brows relaxed, and a look of what I thought might be calm came into the sunken eyes.</p><p>I had been present at a good many deaths, from accident, warfare, illness, or natural causes, and had seen men meet death in many ways, from philosophical acceptance to violent protest. But I had never seen one die quite this way.</p><p>He simply waited, eyes on mine, until I had come to the end of the song. Then he turned his face toward the door, and as the rising sun struck him, he left his body, without the twitch of a muscle or the drawing of a final breath.</p><p>I sat quite still, holding the limp hand, until it occurred to me that I was holding my breath, too.</p><p>The air around me seemed queerly still, as though time had stopped for a moment. But of course it had, I thought, and forced myself to draw breath. It had stopped for him, forever.</p><p>\u201cWhat are we to do with him?\u201d</p><p>There was nothing further to be done for our guest; the only question at the moment was how we might best deal with his mortal remains.</p> <p>I had had a quiet word with Lord John, and he had taken Willie to gather late strawberries on the ridge. While the Indian\u2019s death had had nothing even faintly gruesome about it, I could wish Willie hadn\u2019t seen it; it wasn\u2019t a sight for a child who had seen his mother die no more than a few months before. Lord John had seemed upset himself\u2014perhaps a little sunshine and fresh air would help both of them.</p><p>Jamie frowned and rubbed a hand over his face. He hadn\u2019t shaved yet, and the stubble made a rasping sound.</p><p>\u201cWe must give him decent burial, surely?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I don\u2019t suppose we can leave him lying about in the corncrib, but would his people mind if we buried him here? Do you know anything about how they treat their dead, Ian?\u201d</p><p>Ian was still a little pale, but surprisingly self-possessed. He shook his head, and took a drink of milk.</p><p>\u201cI dinna ken a great deal, Auntie. But I have seen one man die, as I told ye. They wrapped him in a deerskin and had a procession round the village, singing, then took the body a ways into the wood and put it up on a platform, above the ground, and left it there to dry.\u201d</p><p>Jamie seemed less than enthralled at the prospect of having mummified bodies perched in the trees near the farm. \u201cI should think it best maybe to wrap the body decently and carry it to the village, then, so his own folk can deal with him properly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you can\u2019t do that.\u201d I slid the pan of newly baked muffins out of the Dutch oven, plucked a broomtwig and stuck it into one plump brown cake. It came out clean, so I set the pan on the table, then sat down myself. I frowned abstractedly at the jug of honey, glowing gold in the late morning sun.</p><p>\u201cThe trouble is that the body is almost certainly still infectious. You didn\u2019t touch him at all, did you, Ian?\u201d I glanced at Ian, who shook his head, looking sober.</p><p>\u201cNo, Auntie. Not after he fell sick here; before that, I dinna recall. We were all together, hunting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you haven\u2019t had measles. Drat.\u201d I rubbed a hand through my hair. \u201cHave you?\u201d I asked Jamie. To my relief, he nodded.</p><p>\u201cAye, when I was five or so. And you say a person canna have the same sickness twice. So it willna injure me to touch the body?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, nor me either; I\u2019ve had them too. The thing is, we can\u2019t take him to the village. I don\u2019t know at all how long the measles virus\u2014that\u2019s a sort of germ\u2014can live on clothes or in a body, but how could we explain to his people that they mustn\u2019t touch him or go near him? And we can\u2019t risk letting them be infected.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat troubles me,\u201d Ian put in unexpectedly, \u201cis that he isna a man from Anna Ooka\u2014he\u2019s from a village further north. If we bury him here in the usual way, his folk may hear of it and think we had done him to death in some fashion, then buried him to hide it.\u201d</p><p>That was a sinister possibility that hadn\u2019t occurred to me, and I felt as though a cold hand had been laid on the back of my neck.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t think they would, surely?\u201d</p><p>Ian shrugged, broke open a hot muffin, and drizzled honey over the steaming insides.</p><p>\u201cNacognaweto\u2019s folk trust us, but Myers did say there were plenty who would not. They\u2019ve reason to be suspicious, aye?\u201d</p><p>Considering that the bulk of the Tuscarora had been exterminated in a vicious war with the North Carolina settlers no more than fifty years before, I rather thought they had a point. It didn\u2019t help with the present problem, though.</p><p>Jamie swallowed the last of his muffin and sat back with a sigh.</p><p>\u201cWell, then. I think best we wrap the poor man in a shroud of sorts, and put him in the wee cave in the hill above the house. I\u2019ve set the posts for a stable across the opening already; those will keep the beasts off. Then Ian or I should go to Anna Ooka and explain matters to Nacognaweto. Perhaps he will send someone back who can look at the body and assure the man\u2019s people that he met with no violence from us\u2014and then we can bury him.\u201d</p><p>Before I could reply to this suggestion, I heard footsteps, running across the dooryard. I had left the door ajar, to let in light and air. As I turned toward it, Willie\u2019s face appeared in the opening, pale and distraught.</p><p>\u201cMrs. Fraser! Please, will you come? Papa\u2019s ill.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHas he got it from the Indian?\u201d Jamie frowned at Lord John, whom we had stripped to his shirt and put to bed. His face was by turns flushed and pale\u2014the symptoms I had put down earlier to emotional distress.</p><p>\u201cNo, he can\u2019t have. The incubation period is one to two weeks. Where were you\u2014\u201d I turned to Willie, then shrugged, dismissing the question. They had been traveling; there was no conceivable way of telling where or when Grey had encountered the virus. Travelers normally slept several to a bed in inns, and the blankets were seldom changed; it would be easy to lie down in one and get up in the morning with the germs of anything from measles to hepatitis.</p><p>\u201cYou did say there was an epidemic of measles in Cross Creek?\u201d I put a hand on Grey\u2019s forehead. Adept as I was at reading fevers by touch, I would have put his near a hundred and three; quite high enough.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he said hoarsely, and coughed. \u201cHave I got the measles? You must keep Willie away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIan\u2014take Willie outside, will you, please?\u201d I wrung out a cloth wetted with elderflower water, and wiped Grey\u2019s face and neck. There was no rash yet on his face, but when I made him open his mouth, the small whitish Koplik\u2019s spots on the lining were clear enough.</p><p>\u201cYes, you have got the measles,\u201d I said. \u201cHow long have you been feeling ill?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI felt somewhat light-headed when I retired last night,\u201d he said, and coughed again. \u201cI woke with a bad headache, sometime in the night, but I thought it only the result of Jamie\u2019s so-called whisky.\u201d He smiled faintly at Jamie. \u201cThen this morning...\u201d He sneezed, and I hastily groped for a fresh handkerchief.</p><p>\u201cYes, quite. Well, try to rest a bit. I\u2019ve put some willow bark to steep; that will help the headache.\u201d I stood up and raised a brow at Jamie, who followed me outside.</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t let Willie be near him,\u201d I said, low-voiced so as not to be overheard; Willie and Ian were by the penfold, forking hay into the horses\u2019 manger. \u201cOr Ian. He\u2019s very infectious.\u201d</p><p>Jamie frowned.</p><p>\u201cAye. What ye said, though, about incubation\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Ian might have been exposed through the dead man, Willie might have been exposed to the same source as Lord John. Either one of them might have it now, but show no sign yet.\u201d I turned to look at the two boys, both of them outwardly as healthy as the horses they were feeding.</p><p>\u201cI think,\u201d I said, hesitating as I formed a vague plan, \u201cthat perhaps you had better camp outside with the boys tonight\u2014you could sleep in the herb shed, or camp in the grove. Wait a day or so; if Willie\u2019s infected\u2014if he got it from the same source as Lord John\u2014he\u2019ll likely be showing signs by then. If not, then he\u2019s likely all right. If he is all right, then you and he could go to Anna Ooka to tell Nacognaweto about the dead man. That would keep Willie safely out of danger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Ian could stay here to take care of you?\u201d He frowned, considering, then nodded. \u201cAye, I expect that will do.\u201d</p><p>He turned to glance at Willie. Impassive as he could be when he wanted to, I knew him well enough to detect the flicker of emotion across his face.</p><p>There was worry in the tilt of his brows\u2014concern for John Grey, and perhaps for me or Ian. But beyond that was something quite different\u2014interest tinged with apprehension, I thought, at the prospect of spending several days alone with the boy.</p><p>\u201cIf he hasn\u2019t noticed it yet, he isn\u2019t going to,\u201d I said softly, putting my hand on his arm. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d he muttered, turning his back on the boy. \u201cI suppose it\u2019s safe enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey do say it\u2019s an ill wind that blows nobody good,\u201d I said. \u201cYou\u2019ll be able to talk to him without it seeming odd.\u201d I paused. \u201cThere\u2019s just the one thing, before you go.\u201d</p><p>He put his hand over mine where it lay on his arm, and smiled down at me.</p><p>\u201cAye, and what\u2019s that?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDo get that pig out of the pantry, please.\u201d</p><p>27</p><p>TROUT FISHING IN AMERICA</p><p>The journey began inauspiciously. It was raining, for one thing. For another, he disliked leaving Claire, especially in such difficult circumstances. For a third, he was badly worried for John; he hadn\u2019t liked the look of the man at all when he took leave of him, barely half conscious and wheezing like a grampus, his features so blotched with rash as to be unrecognizable.</p><p>And for a fourth, the ninth Earl of Ellesmere had just punched him in the jaw. He took a firm hold on the youngster\u2019s scruff and shook him, hard enough to make his teeth clack painfully together.</p> <p>\u201cNow, then,\u201d he said, letting go. The boy staggered, and sat down suddenly as he lost his balance. He glared down at the lad, sitting in the mud by the penfold. They had been having this argument, on and off, for the last twenty-four hours, and he had had enough of it.</p><p>\u201cI ken well enough what ye said. But what I said is that ye\u2019re coming with me. I\u2019ve told ye why, and that\u2019s all about it.\u201d</p><p>The boy\u2019s face drew down in a ferocious scowl. He wasn\u2019t easily cowed, but then Jamie supposed that earls weren\u2019t used to folk trying, either.</p><p>\u201cI am not leaving!\u201d the boy repeated. \u201cYou can\u2019t make me!\u201d He got to his feet, jaw clenched, and turned back toward the cabin.</p><p>Jamie snaked out an arm, grabbed the lad\u2019s collar, and hauled him back. Seeing the boy draw back his foot for a kick, he closed his fist and punched the boy neatly in the pit of the stomach. William\u2019s eyes bulged and he doubled over, holding his middle.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t kick,\u201d Jamie said mildly. \u201cIt\u2019s ill-mannered. And as for makin\u2019 you, of course I can.\u201d</p> <p>The Earl\u2019s face was bright red and his mouth was opening and closing like a startled goldfish\u2019s. His hat had fallen off, and the rain was pasting strands of dark hair to his head.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s verra loyal of ye to want to stay by your stepfather,\u201d Jamie went on, wiping the water out of his own face, \u201cbut ye canna help him, and you may do yourself damage by staying. So ye\u2019re not.\u201d From the corner of his eye, he caught a glimpse of movement as the oiled hide over the cabin\u2019s window moved aside, then fell. Claire, no doubt wondering why they were not already long gone.</p><p>Jamie took the Earl by an unresisting arm, and led him to one of the saddled horses.</p><p>\u201cUp,\u201d he said, and had the satisfaction of seeing the boy stick a reluctant foot in the stirrup and swing aboard. Jamie tossed the boy\u2019s hat up to him, donned his own, and mounted himself. As a precaution, though, he kept hold of both sets of reins as they set off.</p><p>\u201cYou, sir,\u201d said a breathless, enraged voice behind him, \u201care a lout!\u201d</p><p>He was torn between irritation and an urge to laugh, but gave way to neither. He cast a look back over his shoulder, to see William also turned, and leaning perilously to the side, half off his saddle.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t try it,\u201d he advised the boy, who straightened up abruptly and glared at him. \u201cI wouldna like to tie your feet in your stirrups, but I\u2019ll do it, make no mistake.\u201d</p><p>The boy\u2019s eyes narrowed into bright blue triangles, but he evidently took Jamie at his word. His jaw stayed clenched, but his shoulders slumped a little in temporary defeat.</p> <p>They rode in silence for most of the morning, rain drizzling down their necks and weighting the shoulders of their cloaks. Willie might have accepted defeat, but not graciously. He was still sullen when they dismounted to eat, but did at least fetch water without protest, and pack up the remains of their meal while Jamie watered the horses.</p><p>Jamie eyed him covertly, but there was no sign of measles. The Earl\u2019s face was frowning but rashless, and while the tip of his nose was dripping, this appeared to be due solely to the effects of the weather.</p><p>\u201cHow far is it?\u201d It was midafternoon before William\u2019s curiosity overcame his stubbornness. Jamie had long since relinquished the boy\u2019s reins to him\u2014there was no danger of the lad\u2019s trying to make his way back alone now.</p><p>\u201cTwo days, perhaps.\u201d In such mountainous terrain as lay between the Ridge and Anna Ooka, they would make little better speed on horseback than on foot. Having horses, though, allowed them to bring a few small conveniences, such as a kettle, extra food, and a pair of carved fishing rods. And a number of small gifts for the Indians, including a keg of home-brewed whisky to help cushion the bad news they bore.</p><p>There was no reason to hurry, and some to delay\u2014Claire had told him firmly not to bring Willie back for at least six days. By then, John would no longer be infectious. He would be well on the way to recovery\u2014or dead.</p><p>Claire had been outwardly confident, assuring Willie that his stepfather would be quite all right, but he\u2019d seen the mist of worry in her eyes. It gave him a feeling of hollowness just below the ribs. It was perhaps as well that he was leaving; he could be of no help, and sickness always left him with a helpless feeling that made him at once afraid and angry.</p><p>\u201cThese Indians\u2014they are friendly?\u201d He could hear the tone of doubt in Willie\u2019s voice.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d He felt Willie waiting for him to add \u201cmy lord,\u201d and took a small, perverse satisfaction in not doing it. He guided his horse\u2019s head to the side and slowed his pace, an invitation for Willie to ride up next to him. He smiled at the boy as he did so.</p><p>\u201cWe have known them more than a year, and been guests in their long-houses\u2014aye, the people of Anna Ooka are more courteous and hospitable than most folk I\u2019ve met in England.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have lived in England?\u201d The boy shot him a surprised look, and he cursed his carelessness, but luckily the lad was a great deal more interested in Red Indians than in the personal history of James Fraser, and the question passed with no more than a vague reply.</p><p>He was glad to see the boy abandon his sullen preoccupation and begin to take some interest in their surroundings. He did his best to encourage it, telling stories of the Indians and pointing out animal sign as they went, and he was glad to see the boy thaw into civility, if nothing more, as they rode.</p><p>He welcomed the distraction of conversation himself; his mind was a good deal too busy to make silence comfortable. If the worst should happen\u2014if John should die\u2014what then became of Willie? He would doubtless return to England and his grandmother\u2014and Jamie would hear no more of him.</p><p>John was the only other person, besides Claire, who knew the truth of Willie\u2019s paternity without doubt. It was possible that Willie\u2019s grandmother at least suspected the truth, but she would never, under any circumstances, admit that her grandson might be the bastard of a Jacobite traitor rather than the legitimate issue of the late Earl.</p><p>He said a small prayer to Saint Bride for the welfare of John Grey, and tried to dismiss the nagging worry from his mind. In spite of his apprehensions, he was beginning to enjoy the trip. The rain had lessened to no more than a light spattering, and the forest was fragrant with the scents of wet, fresh leaves and fecund dark leaf mold.</p><p>\u201cD\u2019ye see those scratches down the trunk of that tree?\u201d He pointed with his chin at a large hickory whose bark hung in shreds, showing a number of long, parallel white slashes, some six feet from the ground.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Willie took off his hat and slapped it against his thigh to knock the water off, then leaned forward to look more closely. \u201cAn animal did that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA bear,\u201d Jamie said. \u201cFresh, too\u2014see the sap\u2019s not dried yet in the cuts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it nearby?\u201d Willie glanced around, seeming more curious than alarmed.</p><p>\u201cNot close,\u201d Jamie said, \u201cor the horses would be carryin\u2019 on. But near enough, aye. Keep an eye out; we\u2019ll likely see its dung or its prints.\u201d</p><p>No, if John died, his tenuous link with William would be broken. He had long since resigned himself to the situation, and accepted the necessity without complaint\u2014but he would feel bereft indeed if the measles robbed him not only of his closest friend but of all connection with his son.</p><p>It had stopped raining. As they rounded the flank of a mountain and came out above a valley, Willie gave a small exclamation of surprised delight, and sat up straight in his saddle. Against a backdrop of rain-dark clouds, a rainbow arced from the slope of a distant mountain, falling in a perfect shimmer of light to the floor of the valley far below.</p><p>\u201cOh, it\u2019s glorious!\u201d Willie said. He turned a wide smile on Jamie, their differences forgotten. \u201cHave you ever seen such a thing before, sir?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever,\u201d said Jamie, smiling back. It occurred to him, with a small shock, that these few days in the wilderness might conceivably be the last he would see or hear of William. He hoped that he wouldn\u2019t have to hit the boy again.</p><p>He always slept lightly in the wood, and the sound woke him at once. He lay quite still for a moment, unsure what it was. Then he heard the small, choked noise, and recognized the sound of stifled weeping.</p><p>He checked his instant urge to turn and lay a hand on the boy in comfort. The lad was making every effort not to be heard; he deserved to keep his pride. He lay still, looking up into the sweep of the vast night sky above, and listening.</p><p>Not fright; William had shown no fear of sleeping in dark woods, and had there been a large animal nearby, the boy would not be keeping quiet about it. Was the lad unwell? The sounds were little more than thickened breathing, caught in the throat\u2014perhaps the boy was in pain and too proud to say. It was that fear that decided him to speak; if the measles had caught them up, there was no time to waste; he must carry the boy back to Claire at once.</p><p>\u201cMy lord?\u201d he said softly.</p><p>The sobbing ceased abruptly. He heard the audible sound of a swallow and the rasp of cloth on skin as the lad wiped a sleeve across his face.</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d the Earl said, with a creditable attempt at coolness, marred only by the thickness in his voice.</p><p>\u201cAre ye unwell, my lord?\u201d He could tell already that it wasn\u2019t that, but it would do for a pretext. \u201cHave ye maybe taken a touch of the cramp? Sometimes dried apples take a man amiss.\u201d</p><p>A deep breath came from the far side of the fire, and a snuffle as an attempt was made to clear a running nose unobtrusively. The fire had burned down to nothing more than embers; still, he could see the dark shape that squirmed into a sitting position, crouched on the far side of the fire.</p><p>\u201cI\u2014ah\u2014yes, I think perhaps I have got...something of the sort.\u201d</p><p>Jamie sat up himself, the plaid falling away from his shoulders.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s no great matter,\u201d he said, soothingly. \u201cI\u2019ve a potion that will cure all manner of ills of the stomach. Do ye rest easy for a moment, my lord; I\u2019ll fetch water.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He got to his feet and went away, careful not to look at the boy. By the time he came back from the stream with the kettle filled, Willie had got his nose blown and his face wiped, and was sitting with his knees drawn up, his head resting on them.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t keep himself from touching the boy\u2019s head as he passed. Familiarity be damned. The dark hair was soft to his touch, warm and slightly damp with sweat.</p><p>\u201cA griping in your guts, is it?\u201d he said pleasantly, kneeling and putting the kettle to boil.</p><p>\u201cMm-hm.\u201d Willie\u2019s voice was muffled in the blanket over his knees.</p> <p>\u201cThat passes soon enough,\u201d he said. He reached for his sporran, and sorted through the proliferation of small items in it, coming up eventually with the small cloth bag that held the dried mixture of leaves and flowers Claire had given him. He didn\u2019t know how she\u2019d known it would be needed, but he was long past the point of questioning anything she did in the way of healing\u2014whether of heart or of body.</p><p>He felt a moment\u2019s passionate gratitude to her. He\u2019d seen her look at the boy, and knew how she must feel. She\u2019d known about the lad, of course, but seeing the flesh-and-blood proof that her husband had shared another woman\u2019s bed wasn\u2019t something a wife should be asked to put up with. Little wonder if she was inclined to stick pins in John, him pushing the lad under her nose as he had.</p><p>\u201cIt willna take more than a moment to brew up,\u201d he assured the boy, rubbing the fragrant mixture between his hands into a wooden cup, as he\u2019d seen Claire do.</p><p>She\u2019d not reproached him. Not with that at least, he thought, suddenly remembering how she\u2019d acted when she\u2019d found out about Laoghaire. She\u2019d gone for him like a fiend, then, and yet when later she\u2019d learned about Geneva Dunsany...perhaps it was only that the boy\u2019s mother was dead?</p><p>The realization went through him like a sword thrust. The boy\u2019s mother was dead. Not just his real mother, who\u2019d died the same day he was born\u2014but the woman he\u2019d called mother all his life since. And now his father\u2014or the man he called father, Jamie thought with an unconscious twist of his mouth\u2014was lying sick of an illness that had killed another man before the lad\u2019s eyes no more than days before.</p> <p>No, it wasn\u2019t fright that made the lad greet by himself in the dark. It was grief, and Jamie Fraser, who\u2019d lost a mother in childhood himself, ought to have known that from the beginning.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t stubbornness, nor even loyalty, that had made Willie insist on staying at the Ridge. It was love of John Grey, and fear of his loss. And it was the same love that made the boy weep in the night, desperate with worry for his father.</p><p>An unaccustomed weed of jealousy sprang up in Jamie\u2019s heart, stinging like nettles. He stamped firmly on it; he was fortunate indeed to know that his son enjoyed a loving relationship with his stepfather. There, that was the weed stamped out. The stamping, though, seemed to have left a small bruised spot on his heart; he could feel it when he breathed.</p><p>The water was beginning to rumble in the kettle. He poured it carefully over the herb mixture, and a sweet fragrance rose up in the steam. Valerian, she\u2019d said, and catmint. The root of a passionflower, soaked in honey and finely ground. And the sweet, half-musky smell of lavender, coming as an afterscent.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t drink it yourself,\u201d she\u2019d said, casual in giving it to him. \u201cThere\u2019s lavender in it.\u201d</p><p>In fact, it didn\u2019t trouble him, if he was warned of it. It was only that now and then a whiff of lavender took him unawares, and sent a sudden surge of sickness through his wame. Claire had seen the effects on him once too often to be unwary of it.</p> <p>\u201cHere.\u201d He leaned forward and handed the cup to the boy, wondering whether forever after, the lad too would feel troubled by the scent of lavender, or if he would find in it a memory of comfort. That, he supposed, might well depend on whether John Grey lived or died.</p><p>The respite had given Willie back his outward composure, but his face was still marked with grief. Jamie smiled at the boy, hiding his own concern. Knowing both John and Claire as he did, he was less fearful than the boy\u2014but the dread was still there, persistent as a thorn in the sole of his foot.</p><p>\u201cThat will ease ye,\u201d he said, nodding at the cup. \u201cMy wife made it; she\u2019s a verra fine healer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs she?\u201d The boy took a deep, trembling breath of the steam, and touched a cautious tongue to the hot liquid. \u201cI saw her\u2014do things. With the Indian who died.\u201d The accusation there was clear; she\u2019d done things, and the man had died anyway.</p><p>Neither Claire nor Ian had spoken much of that, nor had he been able to ask her what had happened\u2014she had given him a lifted brow and a brief gold look, to say that he should not speak of it before Willie, who had come back with her from the corncrib, white-faced and clammy.</p><p>\u201cAye?\u201d he said curiously. \u201cWhat sort of\u2014things?\u201d</p><p>What the hell had she done? he wondered. Nothing to cause the man\u2019s death, surely; he would have seen that in her at once. Nor did she feel herself at fault, or helpless\u2014he had held her in his arms more than once, comforting her as she wept for those she could not save. This time she had been quiet, subdued\u2014as had Ian\u2014but not deeply upset. She had seemed vaguely puzzled.</p><p>\u201cShe had mud on her face. And she sang to him. I think she was singing a Papist song; it was in Latin, and it had something to do with sacraments.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIndeed?\u201d Jamie suppressed his own astonishment at this description. \u201cAye, well. Perhaps she meant only to give the man a bit of comfort, if she saw she couldna save him. The Indians are much more sensible of the effects of measles, ye ken; an infection that will kill one of them wouldna cause a white man to blink twice. I\u2019ve had the measle myself, as a wee lad, and took no harm from it at all.\u201d He smiled and stretched, demonstrating his evident health.</p><p>The tense lines of the boy\u2019s face relaxed a little, and he took a cautious sip of the hot tea.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what Mrs. Fraser said. She said Papa would be all right. She\u2014she gave me her word upon it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen ye may depend upon it that he will,\u201d Jamie said firmly. \u201cMrs. Fraser is an honorable woman.\u201d He coughed, and hitched the plaid up around his shoulders; it wasn\u2019t a cold night, but there was a breeze coming down the hill. \u201cIs the drink helping a bit?\u201d</p><p>Willie looked blank, then looked down at the cup in his hand.</p><p>\u201cOh! Yes. Yes, thank you; it\u2019s very good. I feel very much improved. Perhaps it was not the dried apples, after all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps not,\u201d Jamie agreed, bending his head to hide a smile. \u201cStill, I think we\u2019ll manage better for our supper tomorrow; if luck is with us, we\u2019ll have trout.\u201d</p><p>This attempt at distraction was successful; Willie\u2019s head popped up from his cup, an expression of deep interest on his face.</p><p>\u201cTrout? We can fish?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave ye done much fishing in England? I canna think that the trout streams would compare with these, but I know there is good fishing to be had in the Lake District\u2014or so your father tells me.\u201d</p><p>He held his breath. What in God\u2019s name had made him ask that? He had himself taken a five-year-old William fishing for char on the lake near Ellesmere, when he had served his indenture there. Did he want the boy to remember?</p><p>\u201cOh...yes. It\u2019s pleasant on the lakes, surely\u2014but nothing like this.\u201d Willie waved in the vague direction of the creek. The lines in the boy\u2019s face had smoothed themselves, and a small flicker of life had come back into his eyes. \u201cI have never seen such a place. It\u2019s not at all like England!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat it is not,\u201d Jamie agreed, amused. \u201cWill ye not miss England, though?\u201d</p><p>Willie thought about it for a moment, as he slurped the rest of his tea.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so,\u201d he said, with a decided shake of his head. \u201cI miss Grandmamma sometimes, and my horses, but nothing else. It was all tutors and dancing lessons and Latin and Greek\u2014ugh!\u201d He wrinkled his nose, and Jamie laughed.</p><p>\u201cYe dinna care for the dancing, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. You have to do it with girls.\u201d He shot Jamie a look under his fine, dark brows. \u201cDo you care for music, Mr. Fraser?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Jamie said, smiling. \u201cI like the girls fine, though.\u201d The girls were going to like this wee laddie just fine, too, he thought, covertly noting the youngster\u2019s breadth of shoulder and long shanks, and the long, dark lashes that hid his bonny blue eyes.</p><p>\u201cYes. Well, Mrs. Fraser is very pretty,\u201d the Earl said politely. His mouth curled suddenly up on one side. \u201cThough she did look funny, with the mud on her face.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI daresay. Will ye have another cup, my lord?\u201d</p><p>Claire had said the mixture was for calming; it seemed to be working. As they talked desultorily of the Indians and their strange beliefs, William\u2019s eyelids began to droop, and he yawned more than once. At last, Jamie reached over and took the empty cup from his unresisting hand.</p><p>\u201cThe night is cold, my lord,\u201d he said. \u201cWill ye choose to lie next to me, that we may share our coverings?\u201d</p><p>The night was chilly, but a long way from cold. He had guessed right, though; Willie seized the excuse with alacrity. He could not take a lord in his arms to comfort him, nor could a young earl admit to wanting such comfort. Two men could lie close together without shame, though, for the sake of warmth.</p><p>Willie fell asleep at once, nestled close against his side. Jamie lay awake for a long time, one arm laid lightly across the sleeping body of his son.</p><p>\u201cNow the wee speckled one. Just on top, and hold it with your finger, aye?\u201d He wrapped the thread tightly around the tiny roll of white wool, just missing Willie\u2019s finger but catching the end of the woodpecker\u2019s down feather, so the fluffy barbs rose up pertly, quivering in the light air.</p><p>\u201cYou see? It looks like a wee bug taking flight.\u201d</p><p>Willie nodded, intent on the fly. Two tiny yellow tail feathers lay smooth under the down feather, simulating the spread wing casings of a beetle.</p><p>\u201cI see. Is it the color that matters, or the shape?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBoth, but more the shape, I think.\u201d Jamie smiled at the boy. \u201cWhat matters most is how hungry the fish are. Choose your time right, and they\u2019ll strike anything\u2014even a bare hook. Choose it wrong, and ye might as well be fishing wi\u2019 lint from your navel. Dinna tell that to a fly fisherman, though; they\u2019ll be taking all the credit, and none left to the fish.\u201d</p><p>Willie didn\u2019t laugh\u2014the boy didn\u2019t laugh much\u2014but he smiled and took the willow pole with its newly tied fly.</p><p>\u201cIs it the right time, now, do you think, Mr. Fraser?\u201d He shaded his eyes and looked out over the water. They stood in the cool shadow of a grove of black willow, but the sun was still above the horizon, and the water of the stream glittered like metal.</p><p>\u201cAye, trout feed at sunset. D\u2019ye see the prickles on the water? This pool\u2019s waking.\u201d</p><p>The surface of the pool was restless; the water itself lay calm, but dozens of tiny ripples spread and overlapped, rings of light and shadow spreading and breaking in endless profusion. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThe rings? Yes. Is that fish?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet. It\u2019s the hatching; midges and gnats hatch from their cases and burst through the surface to the air\u2014the trout will see them and come to feed.\u201d</p><p>Without warning, a silver streak shot into the air and fell back with a splash. Willie gasped.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a fish,\u201d Jamie said, unnecessarily. He quickly threaded his line through the carved guides, tied a fly to his line, and stepped forward. \u201cWatch now.\u201d</p> <p>He drew back his arm and rocked his wrist, back and forth, feeding more line with each circle of his forearm, until with a snap of the wrist, he sent the line sailing out in a great lazy loop, the fly floating down like a circling gnat. He felt the boy\u2019s eyes on him, and was glad the cast had been good.</p><p>He let the fly float for a moment, watching\u2014it was hard to see, in the sparkling brightness\u2014then began slowly to pull the line in. Quick as thought, the fly went under. The ring of its disappearance had not even begun to spread before he had jerked the line hard and felt the answering savage tug in reply.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got one! You\u2019ve got one!\u201d He could hear Willie, dancing on the bank behind him with excitement, but had no attention to spare for anything save the fish.</p><p>He had no reel; only the twig that held his spare line. He pulled the tip of the rod far back, let it fall forward and gathered in the loose line with a snatch of the hand. Once more, line in, and then a desperate rush that took out all the line gained, and more.</p><p>He could see nothing amid the flashing sparks of light, but the tug and pull through his arms was as good as sight; a quiver as live as the trout itself, as though he held the thing in his hands, squirming and wriggling, fighting...</p> <p>Free. The line went limp, and he stood for a moment, the vibrations of struggle dying away along the muscles of his arms, breathing in the air he had forgotten to take in the heat of battle.</p><p>\u201cHe got away! Oh, bad luck, sir!\u201d Willie scampered down the bank, pole in hand, face open in sympathy.</p><p>\u201cGood luck for the fish.\u201d Still exhilarated from the fight, Jamie grinned and wiped a wet hand over his face. \u201cWill ye try, lad?\u201d Too late, he remembered that he must call the boy \u201clord,\u201d but Willie was too eager to have noticed the omission.</p><p>Face fixed in a scowl of determination, Willie drew back his arm, squinted at the water, and snapped his wrist with a mighty jerk. The rod sailed from his fingers and flew gracefully into the pond.</p><p>The boy gaped after it, then turned an expression of utter dismay on Jamie, who made no effort at all to keep back his laughter. The young lord looked thoroughly taken aback, and not very pleased, but after a moment, one corner of his wide mouth curved up in wry acknowledgment. He gestured at the rod, floating some ten feet from the bank.</p><p>\u201cWill it not frighten all the fish, if I go in after it?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt will. Take mine; I\u2019ll fetch that one back later.\u201d</p><p>Willie licked his lips and set his jaw in concentration, taking a firm grip on the new rod, testing it with little whips and jerks. Turning to the pool, he rocked his arm back and forth, then snapped his wrist hard. He froze, the tip of the rod extended in a perfect line with his arm. The loose line wrapped itself around the rod and draped over Willie\u2019s head.</p><p>\u201cA verra pretty cast, my lord,\u201d Jamie said, rubbing a knuckle hard over his mouth. \u201cBut I think we must put on a new fly first, aye?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Slowly, Willie relaxed his rigid posture, and looked sheepishly at Jamie. \u201cI didn\u2019t think of that.\u201d</p><p>Slightly chastened by these misadventures, the Earl allowed Jamie to fasten a fresh fly in place, and then to take him by the wrist to demonstrate the proper way of casting.</p><p>Standing behind the boy, he took Willie\u2019s right wrist in his own, marveling both at the slenderness of the arm and at the knobby wristbones that gave promise of both size and strength to come. The boy\u2019s skin was cool with perspiration, and the feel of his arm much like the tingle of the trout on the line, live and muscular, vivid to his touch. Then Willie twisted free, and he felt a moment\u2019s confusion, and a peculiar sense of loss at the breaking of their brief contact.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not right,\u201d Willie was saying, turning to look up at him. \u201cYou cast with the left hand. I saw you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, but I\u2019m cack-handed, my lord. Most men would cast with the right.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCack-handed?\u201d Willie\u2019s mouth curved up again.</p><p>\u201cI find my left hand more convenient to most purposes than is the right, my lord.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I thought it meant. I\u2019m the same.\u201d Willie looked at once rather pleased and mildly shamefaced at this statement. \u201cMy\u2014my mother said it wasn\u2019t proper, and that I must learn to use the other, as a gentleman ought. But Papa said no, and made them let me write with my left hand. He said it didn\u2019t matter so much if I should look awkward with a quill; when it came to fighting with a sword, I should be at an advantage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour father is a wise man.\u201d His heart twisted, with something between jealousy and gratitude\u2014but gratitude was far the uppermost.</p><p>\u201cPapa was a soldier.\u201d Willie drew himself up a little, straightening his shoulders with unconscious pride. \u201cHe fought in Scotland, in the Ris\u2014oh.\u201d He coughed, and his face went a dull red as he caught sight of Jamie\u2019s kilt and realized that he was quite possibly talking to a defeated warrior of that particular fight. He fiddled with the rod, not knowing where to look.</p><p>\u201cAye, I know. That\u2019s where I met him, first.\u201d Jamie was careful to keep any hint of amusement from his voice. He was tempted to tell the boy the circumstances of that first meeting, but that would be poor repayment to John for his priceless gift, these precious few days with his son.</p><p>\u201cHe was a verra gallant soldier, indeed,\u201d Jamie agreed, straight-faced. \u201cAnd right about the hands, as well. Have ye begun your schooling with the sword, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust a little.\u201d Willie was forgetting his embarrassment in enthusiasm for the new topic. \u201cI\u2019ve had a little whinger since I was eight, and learnt feint and parry. Papa says I shall have a proper sword when we reach Virginia, now I am tall enough for the reach of tierce and long\u00e9.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh. Well, then, if ye\u2019ve been handling a sword in your left hand, I think ye\u2019ll have nay great trouble in mastering a rod that way. Here, let us try again, or we\u2019ll have no supper.\u201d</p><p>On the third try, the fly settled sweetly, to float for no more than a second before a small but hungry trout roared to the surface and engulfed it. Willie let out a shriek of excitement, and yanked the rod so hard that the astounded trout flew through the air and past his head, to land with a splat on the bank beyond.</p><p>\u201cI did it! I did it! I caught a fish!\u201d Willie waved his rod and ran around in little circles whooping, forgetting the dignity of both age and title.</p><p>\u201cIndeed ye did.\u201d Jamie picked up the trout, which measured perhaps six inches from nose to tail, and clapped the capering Earl on the back in congratulations. \u201cWell done, lad! It looks as though they\u2019re biting well the e\u2019en; let\u2019s have another cast or two, aye?\u201d</p><p>The trout were indeed biting well. By the time the sun had sunk below the rim of the distant black mountains, and the silver water faded to dull pewter, they had each a respectable string of fish. They were also both wet to the eyebrows, exhausted, half blind from the glare, and thoroughly happy.</p><p>\u201cI have never tasted anything half so delicious,\u201d Willie said dreamily. \u201cNever.\u201d He was nak*d, wrapped in a blanket, his shirt, breeches and stockings draped on a tree limb to dry. He lay back with a contented sigh, and belched slightly.</p><p>Jamie rearranged his damp plaid on a bush and laid another chunk of wood on the fire. The weather was fine, God be thanked, but it was chilly with the sun down, the night wind rising, and a wet sark on his back. He stood close to the edge of the fire and let the heated air rise up under his shirt. The warmth of it ran up his thighs and touched his chest and belly, comforting as Claire\u2019s hands on the chilly flesh between his legs.</p><p>He stood quietly for a time, watching the boy without seeming to look at him. Putting vanity aside and judging fairly, he thought William a handsome child. Thinner than he should be; every rib showed\u2014but with a wiry muscularity of limb and well formed in all his parts.</p><p>The boy had turned his head, gazing into the fire, and he could look more openly. Sap in the pinewood cracked and popped, flooding Willie\u2019s face for a moment with golden light.</p><p>Jamie stood quite still, feeling his heart beat, watching. It was one of those strange moments that came to him rarely, but never left. A moment that stamped itself on heart and brain, instantly recallable in every detail, for all of his life.</p><p>There was no telling what made these moments different from any other, though he knew them when they came. He had seen sights more gruesome and more beautiful by far, and been left with no more than a fleeting muddle of their memory. But these\u2014the still moments, as he called them to himself\u2014they came with no warning, to print a random image of the most common things inside his brain, indelible. They were like the photographs that Claire had brought him, save that the moments carried with them more than vision.</p><p>He had one of his father, smeared and muddy, sitting on the wall of a cow byre, a cold Scottish wind lifting his dark hair. He could call that one up and smell the dry hay and the scent of manure, feel his own fingers chilled by the wind, and his heart warmed by the light in his father\u2019s eyes.</p><p>He had such glimpses of Claire, of his sister, of Ian...small moments clipped out of time and perfectly preserved by some odd alchemy of memory, fixed in his mind like an insect in amber. And now he had another.</p><p>For so long as he lived, he could recall this moment. He could feel the cold wind on his face, and the crackling feel of the hair on his thighs, half singed by the fire. He could smell the rich odor of trout fried in cornmeal, and feel the tiny prick of a swallowed bone, hair-thin in his throat.</p><p>He could hear the dark quiet of the forest behind, and the soft rush of the stream nearby. And forever now he would remember the firelight golden on the sweet bold face of his son.</p><p>\u201cDeo gratias,\u201d he murmured, and realized that he had spoken aloud only when the boy turned toward him, startled.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing.\u201d To cover the moment, he turned away and took down his half-dry plaid from the bush. Even soaking wet, Highland wool would keep in a man\u2019s heat, and shelter him from cold.</p><p>\u201cYe should sleep, my lord,\u201d he said, sitting down and arranging the damp folds of plaid around himself. \u201cIt will be a long day tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sleepy.\u201d As though to prove it, Willie sat up and scrubbed his hands vigorously through his hair, making the thick russet mass stand out like a mane round his head.</p><p>Jamie felt a stab of alarm; he recognized the gesture only too well as one of his. In fact, he had been just about to do precisely the same thing, and it was with an effort that he kept his hands still.</p><p>He swallowed the heart that had risen into his throat, and reached for his sporran. No. Surely the lad would never think\u2014a boy of that age paid little heed to anything his elders said or did, let alone thought to look at them closely. Still, it had been the hell of a risk for all of them to take; the look on Claire\u2019s face had been enough to tell him just how striking the resemblance was. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He took a deep breath, and began to take out the small cloth bundles that contained his fly-tying materials. They had used all his made flies, and if he meant to fish for their breakfast, a few more should be got ready.</p><p>\u201cCan I help?\u201d Willie didn\u2019t wait for permission, but scooted around the fire, to sit beside him. Without comment, he pushed the small wooden box of birds\u2019 feathers toward the boy, and picked a fishhook from the piece of cork that held them.</p><p>They worked in silence for a time, stopping only to admire a completed Silver Doctor or Broom-eye, or for Jamie to lend a word of advice or help in tying. Willie soon tired of the exacting work, though, and laid down his half-done Green Whisker, asking numerous questions about fishing, hunting, the forest, the Red Indians they were going to see.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Jamie said in answer to one such. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen a scalp in the village. They\u2019re verra kindly folk, for the most part. Do one some injury, mind, and they\u2019ll not be slow to take revenge for it.\u201d He smiled wryly. \u201cThey do remind me a bit of Highlanders in that regard.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGrandmamma says the Scots breed I\u2014\u201d The casually begun statement choked off abruptly. Jamie looked up to see Willie concentrating fiercely on the half-made fly between his fingers, his face redder than the firelight accounted for.</p><p>\u201cLike rabbits?\u201d Jamie let both irony and smile show in his voice. Willie flicked a cautious sideways glance in his direction.</p><p>\u201cScottish families are sometimes large, aye.\u201d Jamie plucked a wren\u2019s down feather from the small box and laid it delicately against the shank of his hook. \u201cWe think children a blessing.\u201d</p><p>The bright color was fading from Willie\u2019s cheeks. He sat up a little straighter.</p><p>\u201cI see. Have you got a lot of children yourself, Mr. Fraser?\u201d</p> <p>Jamie dropped the down feather.</p><p>\u201cNo, not a great many,\u201d he said, eyes fixed on the mottled leaves.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry\u2014I didn\u2019t think\u2014that is...\u201d Jamie glanced up to see Willie gone red again, one hand crushing the half-tied fly.</p><p>\u201cThink what?\u201d he said, puzzled.</p><p>Willie took a deep breath.</p><p>\u201cWell\u2014the...the...sickness; the measles. I didn\u2019t see any children, but I didn\u2019t think when I said that...I mean...that maybe you had some, but they...\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOch, no.\u201d Jamie smiled at him reassuringly. \u201cMy daughter\u2019s grown; she\u2019ll be living far away in Boston this long while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Willie let out his breath, tremendously relieved. \u201cThat\u2019s all?\u201d</p><p>The fallen down-feather moved in a breath of wind, betraying its presence in the shadows. Jamie pinched it between thumb and forefinger and lifted it gently from the ground.</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019ve a son, too,\u201d he said, eyes on the hook that had somehow embedded its barb in his thumb. A tiny drop of blood welled up around the shining metal. \u201cA bonny lad, and I love him weel, though he\u2019s away from home just now.\u201d</p><p>28</p><p>HEATED CONVERSATION</p><p>By evening, Ian was glassy-eyed and hot to the touch. He sat up on his pallet to greet me, but swayed alarmingly, his eyes unfocused. I didn\u2019t have the slightest doubt, but looked in his mouth for confirmation; sure enough, the small diagnostic Koplik\u2019s spots showed white against the dark pink mucous membrane. Though the skin of his neck was still fair and childlike under his hair, it showed a harmless-looking stipple of small pink spots.</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d I said, resigned. \u201cYou\u2019ve got it. You\u2019d best come up to the house so I can take care of you more easily.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve got the measle? Am I going to die, then?\u201d he asked. He seemed only mildly interested, his attention concentrated on some interior vision.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I said matter-of-factly, trusting that I was right. \u201cFeeling pretty bad, though, are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy head hurts a bit,\u201d he said. I could see that it did; his brows were drawn together, and he squinted at even so dim a light as that provided by my candle.</p><p>Still, he could walk, and a good thing, too, I thought as I watched him make his unsteady way down the ladder from the loft. Scrawny and storklike as he looked, he was a good eight inches taller than I, and outweighed me by at least thirty pounds.</p><p>It was no more than twenty yards to the cabin, but Ian was trembling from exertion by the time I got him inside. Lord John sat up as we came in, and made to get out of bed, but I waved him back.</p><p>\u201cStay there,\u201d I said, depositing Ian heavily on a stool. \u201cI can manage.\u201d</p><p>I had been sleeping on the trundle bed; it was already made up with sheets, quilt, and pillow. I peeled Ian out of his breeks and stockings, and tucked him up at once. He was flushed and clammy-cheeked, and looked much sicker than he had done in the dimness of his loft.</p><p>The willow-bark brew I had left steeping was dark and aromatic; ready to drink. I poured it off carefully into a cup, glancing as I did so at Lord John.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d meant this for you,\u201d I said. \u201cBut if you could stand to wait...\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy all means give it to the lad,\u201d he said, with a dismissive wave. \u201cI can wait easily. Can I not assist you, though?\u201d</p><p>I thought of suggesting that if he really wanted to be helpful, he could walk to the privy rather than use the chamber pot\u2014which I would have to empty\u2014but I could see that he wasn\u2019t yet in any condition to be wandering round outside at night by himself. I didn\u2019t want to be explaining to young William that I had allowed his remaining parent\u2014or what he thought was his remaining parent\u2014to be eaten by bears, let alone take pneumonia.</p><p>So I merely shook my head politely, and knelt by the trundle to administer the brew to Ian. He felt well enough to make faces and complain about the taste, which I found reassuring. Still, the headache was obviously very bad; the line between his brows was fixed and sharp as though it had been carved there with a knife.</p><p>I sat on the trundle and took his head onto my lap, gently rubbing his temples. Then I put my thumbs just into the sockets of his eyes, pressing firmly upward on the ridge of his brows. He made a low sound of discomfort, but then relaxed, his head heavy on my thigh.</p><p>\u201cJust breathe,\u201d I said. \u201cDon\u2019t worry if it\u2019s a bit tender at first, it means I\u2019ve got the right spot.\u201d</p><p>\u201c \u2019S all right,\u201d he murmured, his words a little slurred. His hand drifted up and closed on my wrist, big and very warm. \u201cThat\u2019s the Chinaman\u2019s way, no?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. He means Yi Tien Cho\u2014Mr. Willoughby,\u201d I explained to Lord John, who was watching the proceedings with a puzzled frown. \u201cIt\u2019s a way of relieving pain by putting pressure on some points of the body. This one is good for headache. The Chinaman taught me to do it.\u201d</p><p>I felt some reluctance to mention the little Chinese to Lord John, seeing that the last time we had met, on Jamaica, Lord John had had some four hundred soldiers and sailors combing the island in pursuit of Mr. Willoughby, then suspected of a particularly atrocious murder.</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t do it, you know,\u201d I felt compelled to add. Lord John raised one eyebrow at me.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s as well,\u201d he said dryly, \u201csince we never caught him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m glad.\u201d I looked down at Ian, and moved my thumbs a quarter of an inch outward, pressing again. His face was still tight with pain, but I thought the whiteness at the corners of his mouth was lessening a bit.</p><p>\u201cI...ah...don\u2019t suppose you know who did kill Mrs. Alcott?\u201d Lord John\u2019s voice was casual. I glanced up at him, but his face betrayed nothing beyond simple curiosity and a large number of spots.</p><p>\u201cI do, yes,\u201d I said hesitantly, \u201cbut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do? A murder? Who was it? What happened, Auntie? Ooch!\u201d Ian\u2019s eyelids popped open under my fingers, wide with interest, then snapped shut in a grimace of pain as the firelight struck them.</p><p>\u201cYou be still,\u201d I said, and dug my thumbs into the muscles in front of his ears. \u201cYou\u2019re ill.\u201d</p><p>\u201cArgk!\u201d he said, but subsided obediently into limpness, the corn-shuck mattress rustling loudly under his thin body. \u201cAll right, Auntie, but who? Ye canna be telling wee bits o\u2019 things like that, and expect me to sleep without knowing the rest of it. Can she, then?\u201d He opened one eye in a slitted appeal toward Lord John, who smiled in reply.</p><p>\u201cI bear no further responsibility in the matter,\u201d Lord John assured me. \u201cHowever\u201d\u2014 he spoke more firmly to Ian\u2014\u201cyou might stop to think that perhaps the story incriminates someone your aunt prefers to shield. It would be discourteous to insist upon details, in that case.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOch, no, it\u2019s never that,\u201d Ian assured him, eyes tight closed. \u201cUncle Jamie wouldna murder anybody, save he had good reason.\u201d</p><p>From the corner of my eye, I saw Lord John jerk, slightly startled. Plainly, it had never occurred to him that it could have been Jamie.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I assured him, seeing the fair brows draw together. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, and it wasna me, either,\u201d Ian said smugly. \u201cAnd who else would Auntie be protecting?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou flatter yourself, Ian,\u201d I said dryly. \u201cBut since you insist...\u201d</p><p>My hesitancy had in fact been in the interests of protecting Young Ian. No one else could be harmed by the story\u2014the murderer was dead and, for all I knew, Mr. Willoughby, too, perished in the hidden jungles of the Jamaican hills, though I sincerely hoped not.</p><p>But the story involved someone else, as well; the woman I had first known as Geillis Duncan and known later as Geillis Abernathy, at whose behest Ian had been kidnapped from Scotland, imprisoned on Jamaica, and had suffered things that he had only lately begun to tell us.</p><p>Still, there seemed no way out of it now\u2014Ian was fractious as a child insisting on a bedtime story, and Lord John was sitting up in bed like a chipmunk waiting for nuts, eyes bright with interest.</p><p>And so, with the macabre urge to begin with \u201cOnce upon a time...\u201d I leaned back against the wall, and with Ian\u2019s head still in my lap, began the story of Rose Hall and its mistress, the witch Geillis Duncan; of the Reverend Archibald Campbell and his strange sister, Margaret, of the Edinburgh Fiend and the Fraser prophecy; and of a night of fire and crocodile\u2019s blood, when the slaves of six plantations along the Yallahs River had risen and slain their masters, roused by the houngan Ishmael.</p><p>Of later events in the cave of Abandawe on Haiti, I said nothing. Ian, after all, had been there. And those happenings had nothing to do with the murder of Mina Alcott.</p><p>\u201cA crocodile,\u201d Ian murmured. His eyes were closed, and his face had grown more relaxed under my fingers, despite the gruesome nature of my story. \u201cYe really saw it, Auntie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI not only saw it, I stepped on it,\u201d I assured him. \u201cOr rather, I stepped on it, and then I saw it. If I\u2019d seen it first, I\u2019d have bloody run the other way.\u201d</p><p>There was a low laugh from the bed. Lord John scratched at his arm, smiling.</p><p>\u201cYou must find life here rather dull, Mrs. Fraser, after your adventures in the Indies.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI could do with a spot of dullness now and then,\u201d I said, rather wistfully.</p><p>Involuntarily, I glanced at the bolted door, where I had propped Ian\u2019s musket, brought back from the storehouse when I had fetched him. Jamie had taken his own gun, but his pistols lay on the sideboard, loaded and primed as he had left them for me, bullet case and powder horn neatly arranged beside them.</p><p>It was cozy in the cabin, with the fire flickering gold and red on the rough-barked walls, and the air filled with the warm, lingering scents of squirrel stew and pumpkin bread, spiced with the bitter tang of willow tea. I brushed my fingers over Ian\u2019s jaw. No rash yet, but the skin was tight and hot\u2014very hot still, in spite of the willow bark.</p><p>Talking about Jamaica had at least distracted me a bit from my worry over Ian. Headache was not an unusual symptom for someone with measles; severe and prolonged headache was. Meningitis and encephalitis were dangerous\u2014and all too possible\u2014complications of the disease.</p> <p>\u201cHow\u2019s the head?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cA bit better,\u201d he said. He coughed, eyes squinching shut as the spasms jarred his head. He stopped and opened them slightly, dark slits that glowed with fever. \u201cI\u2019m awfully hot, Auntie.\u201d</p><p>I slid off the trundle and went to wring out a cloth in cool water. Ian stirred slightly as I wiped his face, his eyes closed once more.</p><p>\u201cMrs. Abernathy gave me amethysts to drink for the headache,\u201d he murmured drowsily.</p><p>\u201cAmethysts?\u201d I was startled, but kept my voice low and soothing. \u201cYou drank amethysts?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGround up in vinegar,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd pearls in sweet wine, but that was for the bedding, she said.\u201d His face looked red and swollen, and he turned his cheek against the cool pillow, seeking relief. \u201cShe was a great one for the stones, yon woman. She burned powdered emeralds in the flame of a black candle, and she rubbed my c*ck wi\u2019 a diamond\u2014to keep it hard, she said.\u201d</p><p>There was a faint sound from the bed, and I looked up to see Lord John, raised up on one elbow, eyes wide.</p><p>\u201cAnd did the amethysts work?\u201d I wiped Ian\u2019s face gently with the cloth.</p><p>\u201cThe diamond did.\u201d He made a feeble attempt at an adolescent\u2019s bawdy laugh, but it faded into a harsh, rasping cough.</p><p>\u201cNo amethysts here, I\u2019m afraid,\u201d I said. \u201cBut there\u2019s wine, if you want it.\u201d He did, and I helped him to drink it\u2014well diluted with water\u2014then eased him back on the pillow, flushed and heavy-eyed.</p><p>Lord John had lain down, too, and lay watching, his thick blond hair unbound, spread out on the pillow behind him.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s what she wanted wi\u2019 the lads, ye ken,\u201d Ian said. His eyes were shut tight against the light, but he could clearly see something, if only in the mists of memory. He licked his lips; they were beginning to dry and crack, and his nose was beginning to run.</p><p>\u201cShe said the stone grew in a lad\u2019s innards\u2014the one she wanted. She said it must be a laddie who\u2019d never gone wi\u2019 a lass, though, that was important. If he had, the stone wouldna be right, somehow. If he h-huh-had one.\u201d He paused to cough, and ended breathless, nose dripping. I held a handkerchief for him to blow.</p><p>\u201cWhat did she want the stone for?\u201d Lord John\u2019s face bore a look of sympathy\u2014he knew only too well what Ian felt like at the moment\u2014but curiosity compelled the question. I didn\u2019t object; I wanted to know too.</p><p>Ian started to shake his head, then stopped with a groan.</p><p>\u201cAh! Oh, God, my head will split surely! I dinna ken, man. She didna say. Only that it was needful; she must have it to be s-sure.\u201d He barely got out the last word before dissolving into a coughing attack that was the worst yet; he sounded like a barking dog.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d better stop talk\u2014\u201d I began, but was interrupted by a soft thump at the door.</p><p>Instantly I froze, wet cloth still in my hand. Lord John leaned swiftly from the bed and took a pistol from inside one of his high cavalry boots on the floor. A finger to his lips to enjoin silence, he nodded toward Jamie\u2019s pistols. I moved silently to the sideboard and grasped one, reassured by the smooth, solid heft of it in my hand.</p><p>\u201cWho is there?\u201d Lord John called, in a surprisingly strong voice.</p> <p>There was no answer save a sort of scratching, and a faint whine. I sighed and laid the pistol down, torn between irritation, relief and amusement.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s your blasted dog, Ian.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d Lord John spoke in a low voice, pistol still aimed unwaveringly at the door. \u201cIt might be an Indian trick.\u201d</p><p>Ian rolled over with an effort, facing the door.</p><p>\u201cRollo!\u201d he shouted, his voice hoarse and cracking.</p><p>Hoarse or not, Rollo knew his master\u2019s voice; there was a deep, joyful \u201cWARF!\u201d from outside, succeeding by frantic scratching, at a height some four feet from the ground.</p><p>\u201cBeastly dog,\u201d I said, hurrying to open the door. \u201cStop that, or I\u2019ll make you into a rug, or a coat, or something!\u201d</p><p>Giving this threat the attention it deserved, Rollo bounded past me into the room. Exuberant with joy, he launched his hundred and fifty pounds from the middle of the floor and landed directly on the trundle bed, making it sway dangerously, joints screeching in protest. Ignoring a strangled cry from the bed\u2019s occupant, he proceeded to lick Ian madly about the face and forearms\u2014the latter being flung up as a wholly inadequate defense to the slobbering onslaught.</p><p>\u201cBad dog,\u201d Ian said, making ineffectual efforts to push Rollo off his chest, giggling helplessly in spite of his discomfort. \u201cBad dog, I say\u2014down, sir!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDown, sir!\u201d Lord John echoed sternly. Rollo, interrupted in his demonstrations of affection, rounded on Lord John, his ears laid back. He curled his lip, and gave his lordship a good look at the condition of his back teeth. Lord John started, and raised his pistol convulsively.</p><p>\u201cDown, a dhiobhuil!\u201d Ian said, prodding Rollo in the hindquarters. \u201cTake your hairy arse out o\u2019 my face, ye wicked beast!\u201d</p><p>Rollo instantly dismissed Lord John from consideration, and padded around on top of the trundle, turning three times and kneading the bedding with his paws before collapsing next to his master\u2019s body. He licked Ian\u2019s ear, and with a deep sigh, laid his nose between his large muddy paws on the pillow.</p><p>\u201cWould you like me to get him off, Ian?\u201d I offered, eyeing the paws. I wasn\u2019t quite sure how I might move a dog of Rollo\u2019s size and temperament, bar shooting him with Jamie\u2019s pistol and dragging his carcass off the bed, so was rather relieved when Ian shook his head.</p><p>\u201cNo, let him stay, Auntie,\u201d he said, croaking slightly. \u201cHe\u2019s a good fellow. Are ye no, a charaid?\u201d He laid a hand on the dog\u2019s neck, and turned his head so his cheek lay pillowed against Rollo\u2019s thick ruff.</p><p>\u201cAll right, then.\u201d Moving slowly, with a wary glance at the unblinking yellow eyes, I approached the bed and smoothed Ian\u2019s hair. His forehead was still hot, but I thought the fever was a bit lower. If it broke in the night, as it well might, it was likely to be succeeded by a fit of violent shivering\u2014when Ian might well find Rollo\u2019s warm hairy bulk a comfort.</p><p>\u201cSleep well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOidhche mhath.\u201d He was half asleep already, drifting into the vivid dreams of fever, and his \u201cgood-night\u201d was barely more than a murmur.</p><p>I moved quietly about the room, tidying away the results of the day\u2019s labors; a basket of fresh-gathered peanuts to be washed, dried and stored; a pan of dried reeds laid flat and covered with a layer of bacon grease to make rushlights. A trip to the pantry, where I stirred the beer mash fermenting in its tub, squeezed out the curds of the soft cheese a-making, and punched down the slow-rising salt bread, ready to be made into loaves and baked in the morning, when the small Dutch oven built into the side of the hearth would be heated through by the night\u2019s low fire.</p><p>Ian was sound asleep when I came back into the main room; Rollo\u2019s eyes were closed as well, though one yellow slit cracked open at my entrance. I glanced at Lord John; he was awake, but did not look round.</p><p>I sat down on the settle by the fire, and brought out the big wool basket with its green and black Indian pattern\u2014Sun-eater, Gabrielle had called the design.</p><p>Two days since Jamie and Willie had left. Two days to the Tuscarora village. Two days back. If nothing happened to stop them.</p><p>\u201cNonsense,\u201d I muttered, under my breath. Nothing would stop them. They would be home soon.</p><p>The basket was full of dyed skeins of wool and linen thread. Some I had been given by Jocasta, some I had spun myself. The difference was obvious, but even the lumpy, awkward-looking strands I produced could be used for something. Not stockings or jerseys; perhaps I could knit a tea cozy\u2014that seemed sufficiently shapeless to disguise all my deficiencies.</p><p>Jamie had been simultaneously shocked and amused to find that I didn\u2019t know how to knit. The question had never arisen at Lallybroch, where Jenny and the female servants kept everyone in knitted goods. I had taken on the chores of stillroom and garden, and never dealt with needlework beyond the simplest mending.</p><p>\u201cYe canna clickit at all?\u201d he said incredulously. \u201cAnd what did ye do for your winter stockings in Boston, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBought them,\u201d I said.</p><p>He had looked elaborately around the clearing where we had been sitting, admiring the half-finished cabin.</p><p>\u201cSince I dinna see any shops about, I suppose ye\u2019d best learn, aye?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose so.\u201d I dubiously eyed the knitting basket Jocasta had given me. It was well equipped, with three long circular wire needles in different sizes, and a sinister-looking set of four double-ended ivory ones, slender as stilettos, which I knew were used in some mysterious fashion to turn the heels of stockings.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll ask Jocasta to show me, next time we go down to River Run. Next year perhaps.\u201d</p><p>Jamie snorted briefly and picked up a needle and a ball of yarn.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s no verra difficult, Sassenach. Look\u2014this is how ye cast up your row.\u201d Drawing the thread out through his closed fist, he made a loop round his thumb, slipped it onto the needle, and with a quick economy of motion, cast on a long row of stitches in a matter of seconds. Then he handed me the other needle and another ball of yarn. \u201cThere\u2014you try.\u201d</p><p>I looked at him in complete amazement.</p><p>\u201cYou can knit?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, of course I can,\u201d he said, staring at me in puzzlement. \u201cI\u2019ve known how to clickit wi\u2019 needles since I was seven years old. Do they not teach bairns anything in your time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d I said, feeling mildly foolish, \u201cthey sometimes teach little girls to do needlework, but not boys.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey didna teach you, did they? Besides, it\u2019s no fine needlework, Sassenach, it\u2019s only plain knitting. Here, take your thumb and dip it, so...\u201d</p><p>And so he and Ian\u2014who, it turned out, could also knit and was prostrated by mirth at my lack of knowledge\u2014had taught me the simple basics of knit and purl, explaining, between snorts of derision over my efforts, that in the Highlands all boys were routinely taught to knit, that being a useful occupation well suited to the long idle hours of herding sheep or cattle on the shielings. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOnce a man\u2019s grown and has a wife to do for him, and a lad of his own to mind the sheep, he maybe doesna make his own stockings anymore,\u201d Ian had said, deftly executing the turn of a heel before handing me back the stocking, \u201cbut even wee laddies ken how, Auntie.\u201d</p><p>I cast an eye at my current project, some ten inches of a wooly shawl, which lay in a small crumpled heap at the bottom of the basket. I had learned the basics, but knitting for me was still a pitched battle with knotted thread and slippery needles, not the soothing, dreamy exercise that Jamie and Ian made of it, needles clicketing away in their big hands by the fire, comforting as the sound of crickets on the hearth.</p><p>Not tonight, I thought. I wasn\u2019t up to it. Something mindless, like winding up the balls of yarn. That I could do. I laid aside a half-finished pair of stockings Jamie was making for himself\u2014striped, the show-off\u2014and pulled out a heavy skein of fresh-dyed blue wool, still redolent with the heavy scents of its dyeing.</p><p>Normally I liked the smell of fresh yarn, with its faint oily whiff of sheep, the earthy smell of indigo, and the sharp tang of the vinegar used to set the dye. Tonight it seemed smothering, added as it was to woodsmoke and candle wax, to the close, acrid smells of male bodies and the reek of illness\u2014a mingled scent of sweaty sheets and used chamber pots\u2014all trapped together in the room\u2019s stale air.</p> <p>I let the skein lie on my lap, and closed my eyes for a moment. I wanted nothing so much as to undress and sponge myself with cool water, then slip nak*d between the clean linen sheets of my bed and lie still, letting the fresh cool air blow through the open window across my face while I floated into oblivion.</p><p>But there was a sweating Englishman in one of my beds, and a filthy dog in the other, to say nothing of a teenage boy who was obviously in for a hard night. The sheets had not been washed in days, and when they were, it would be a backbreaking business of boiling, lifting and wringing. My bed for the night\u2014assuming that I got to sleep in it\u2014would be a pallet made of a folded quilt, with my pillow a sack of carded wool. I would breathe sheep all night.</p><p>Nursing is hard work, and all of a sudden I was bloody tired of it. For a moment of intense longing, I wanted them all just to go away. I opened my eyes, looking at Lord John with resentment. My little burst of self-pity faded, though, as I looked at him. He lay on his back, one arm behind his head, gazing somberly up at the ceiling. It might have been only a trick of the fire, but his face seemed marked by anxiety and grief, eyes shadowed with dark loss.</p><p>At once I felt ashamed of my ill temper. Granted, I hadn\u2019t wanted him here. I was annoyed at his intrusion into my life and the burden of obligation his illness had placed upon me. His very presence made me uneasy\u2014to say nothing of William\u2019s. But they would go, soon. Jamie would be home, Ian would recover, and I would have back my peace, my happiness, and my clean sheets. What had happened to him was permanent.</p><p>John Grey had lost a wife\u2014however he might have regarded her. It had taken courage of more than one kind to bring William here, and to send him off with Jamie. And I didn\u2019t suppose the bloody man could help having caught the measles.</p> <p>I laid the wool aside for the moment and got up to put the kettle on. A nice cup of tea all round seemed called for. As I straightened up from the hearth, I saw Lord John turn his head, my movement drawing his attention from his inward thoughts.</p><p>\u201cTea,\u201d I said, embarrassed to meet his eyes after my uncharitable thoughts. I made a small, awkward gesture of interrogation toward the kettle.</p><p>He smiled faintly and nodded.</p><p>\u201cI thank you, Mrs. Fraser.\u201d</p><p>I took down the tea box from the cupboard, and laid out two cups and spoons, adding the sugar bowl as an afterthought; no molasses tonight.</p><p>When I had got the tea made, I sat down near the bed to drink it. We sipped in silence for a few moments, an odd air of shyness hovering between us.</p> <p>At last, I set down my cup and cleared my throat.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry; I had meant to offer you my condolences on the loss of your wife,\u201d I said, rather formally.</p><p>He looked surprised for a moment, then bowed his head in acknowledgment, matching my formality.</p><p>\u201cIt is a coincidence that you should say so at the moment,\u201d he said. \u201cI had just been thinking of her.\u201d</p><p>Used as I was to having other people take one look at my face and discern instantly what I was thinking, it was oddly gratifying to be able to do it to someone else.</p><p>\u201cDo you miss her greatly\u2014your wife?\u201d I felt a bit hesitant about asking, but he didn\u2019t seem to find the question intrusive. I might almost have thought that he had been asking it himself, for he answered readily, if thoughtfully.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t really know,\u201d he said. He glanced at me, one eyebrow raised. \u201cDoes that sound unfeeling?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t say,\u201d I said, a little tartly. \u201cSurely you\u2019d know better than I whether you had feelings for her or not.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI did, yes.\u201d He let his head fall back on the pillow, his thick fair hair loose about his shoulders. \u201cOr I do, perhaps. That\u2019s why I came, do you see?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I can\u2019t say that I do.\u201d</p><p>I heard Ian cough, and rose to look, but he had only turned over in his sleep; he lay on his stomach, one long arm drooping from the trundle bed. I picked up his hand\u2014it was still hot, but not dangerously so\u2014and put it on the pillow near his face. His hair had fallen in his eyes; I brushed it gently back.</p><p>\u201cYou are very good with him; have you children of your own?\u201d</p><p>Startled, I looked up to see Lord John watching me, chin propped on his fist.</p><p>\u201cI\u2014we\u2014have a daughter,\u201d I said.</p><p>His eyes widened.</p><p>\u201cWe?\u201d he said sharply. \u201cThe girl is Jamie\u2019s?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t call her \u2018the girl,\u2019 \u201d I said, unreasonably irritated. \u201cHer name is Brianna, and yes, she\u2019s Jamie\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy apologies,\u201d he said, rather stiffly.</p><p>\u201cI meant no offense,\u201d he added a moment later, in a softer tone. \u201cI was surprised.\u201d</p><p>I looked at him directly. I was too tired to be tactful.</p><p>\u201cAnd a bit jealous, perhaps?\u201d</p><p>He had a diplomat\u2019s face; almost anything could have been going on behind that facade of handsome amiability. I went on staring at him, though, and he let the mask drop\u2014a flash of knowledge lit the light blue eyes, tinged with grudging humor.</p><p>\u201cSo. One more thing that we have in common.\u201d I was startled by his acuity, though I shouldn\u2019t have been. It\u2019s always discomfiting to find that feelings you thought safely hidden are in fact sitting out in the open for anyone to look at.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t tell me you didn\u2019t think of that when you decided to come here.\u201d The tea was finished; I set the cup aside and took up my skein of wool again.</p><p>He studied me for a moment, eyes narrowed.</p><p>\u201cI thought of it, yes,\u201d he said finally. He let his head fall back on the pillow, eyes fixed on the low beamed ceiling. \u201cStill, if I was human enough\u2014or petty enough\u2014to consider that I might offend you by bringing William here, I would ask you to believe that such offense was not my motive in coming.\u201d</p><p>I laid the finished ball of yarn in the basket and took up another skein, stretching it across the back of a split-willow chair.</p><p>\u201cI believe you,\u201d I said, my eyes fixed on the skein. \u201cIf only because it seems rather a lot of trouble to go to. What was your motive, though?\u201d</p><p>I sensed the movement as he shrugged, rustling the sheets.</p><p>\u201cThe obvious\u2014to allow Jamie to see the boy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the other obvious\u2014to allow you to see Jamie.\u201d</p><p>There was a marked silence from the bed. I kept my eyes on the yarn, turning the ball as I wrapped the strand, over and under, back and forth, an intricate crisscross that would in the end yield a perfect sphere.</p><p>\u201cYou are a rather remarkable woman,\u201d he said at last, in a level tone.</p><p>\u201cIndeed,\u201d I said, not looking up. \u201cIn what way?\u201d</p><p>He leaned back; I heard the rustle of his bedding.</p><p>\u201cYou are neither circumspect nor circuitous. In fact, I don\u2019t believe I have ever met anyone more devastatingly straightforward\u2014male or female.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s not by choice,\u201d I said. I came to the end of the thread and tucked it neatly into the ball. \u201cI was born that way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo was I,\u201d he said, very softly.</p><p>I didn\u2019t answer; I didn\u2019t think he had spoken to be heard.</p><p>I rose and went to the cupboard. I took down three jars: catmint, valerian, and wild ginger. I took down the marble mortar and tipped the dried leaves and root chunks into it. A drop of water fell from the kettle, hissing into steam.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Lord John asked.</p><p>\u201cMaking an infusion for Ian,\u201d I said, with a nod toward the trundle. \u201cThe same I gave you four days ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh. We heard of you as we traveled from Wilmington,\u201d Grey said. His voice was casual now, making conversation. \u201cYou are well known in the countryside for your skills, it would appear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMm.\u201d I pounded and ground, and the deep, musky smell of wild ginger filled the room.</p><p>\u201cThey say you are a conjure-woman. What is that, do you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnything from a midwife to a physician to a caster of spells or a fortune-teller,\u201d I said. \u201cDepending on who\u2019s talking.\u201d</p><p>He made a sound that might have been a laugh, and then was silent for a bit.</p><p>\u201cYou think they will be safe.\u201d It was a statement, but he was asking.</p><p>\u201cYes. Jamie wouldn\u2019t have taken the boy if he thought there\u2019d be any danger. Surely you know that, if you know him at all?\u201d I added, glancing at him.</p><p>\u201cI know him,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cDo you indeed,\u201d I said.</p><p>He was quiet for a moment, bar the sound of scratching.</p><p>\u201cI know him well enough\u2014or think I do\u2014to risk sending William away with him, alone. And to be sure he will not tell William the truth.\u201d</p><p>I poured the green and yellow powder into a small square of cotton gauze and tied it neatly into a tiny bag.</p><p>\u201cNo, he won\u2019t, you\u2019re right about that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you?\u201d</p><p>I looked up, startled.</p><p>\u201cYou really think I would?\u201d He studied my face carefully for a moment, then smiled.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>I snorted briefly and dropped the medicine bag into the teapot. I put back the jars of herbs, and sat down with my blasted wool again.</p><p>\u201cIt was generous of you\u2014to let Willie go with Jamie. Rather brave,\u201d I added, somewhat grudgingly. I looked up; he was staring at the dark oblong of the hide-covered window, as though he could look beyond it to see the two figures, side by side in the forest.</p><p>\u201cJamie has held my life in his hands for a good many years now,\u201d he answered softly. \u201cI will trust him with William\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what if Willie remembers a groom named MacKenzie better than you think? Or happens to take a good look at his own face and Jamie\u2019s?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwelve-year-old boys are not remarkable for their acute perception,\u201d Grey said dryly. \u201cAnd I think that if a boy has lived all his life in the secure belief that he is the ninth Earl of Ellesmere, the notion that he might actually be the illegitimate offspring of a Scottish groom is not one that would enter his head\u2014or be long entertained there, if it did.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I wound wool in silence, listening to the crackle of the fire. Ian was coughing again, but didn\u2019t wake. The dog had moved, and was now curled up by his legs, a dark heap of fur.</p><p>I finished the second ball of yarn and began another. One more, and the infusion would have finished steeping. If Ian didn\u2019t need me yet, I would lie down then.</p><p>Grey had been silent for so long that I was surprised when he started to speak again. When I glanced at him, he wasn\u2019t looking at me, but was staring upward, seeking visions once again among the smoke-stained beams.</p><p>\u201cI told you I had feelings for my wife,\u201d he said softly. \u201cI did. Affection. Familiarity. Loyalty. We had known each other all her life; our fathers had been friends; I had known her brother. She might well have been my sister.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd was she satisfied with that\u2014to be your sister?\u201d</p><p>He gave me a glance somewhere between anger and interest.</p><p>\u201cYou cannot be at all a comfortable woman to live with.\u201d He shut his mouth, but couldn\u2019t leave it there. He shrugged impatiently. \u201cYes, I believe she was satisfied with the life she led. She never said that she was not.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t reply to this, though I exhaled rather strongly through my nose. He shrugged uncomfortably, and scratched his collarbone.</p><p>\u201cI was an adequate husband to her,\u201d he said defensively. \u201cThat we had no children of our own\u2014that was not my\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI really don\u2019t want to hear about it!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, don\u2019t you?\u201d His voice was still low, not to wake Ian, but it had lost the smooth modulations of diplomacy; the anger was rough in it.</p><p>\u201cYou asked me why I came; you questioned my motives; you accused me of jealousy. Perhaps you don\u2019t want to know, because if you did, you could not keep thinking of me as you choose to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd how the hell do you know what I choose to think of you?\u201d</p><p>His mouth twisted in an expression that might have been a sneer on a less handsome face.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t I?\u201d</p> <p>I looked him full in the face for a minute, not troubling to hide anything at all.</p><p>\u201cYou did mention jealousy,\u201d he said quietly, after a moment.</p><p>\u201cSo I did. So did you.\u201d</p><p>He turned his head away, but continued after a moment.</p><p>\u201cWhen I heard that Isobel was dead...it meant nothing to me. We had lived together for years, though we had not seen each other for nearly two years. We shared a bed; we shared a life, I thought. I should have cared. But I didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>He took a deep breath; I saw the bedclothes stir as he settled himself.</p><p>\u201cYou mentioned generosity. It wasn\u2019t that. I came to see...whether I can still feel,\u201d he said. His head was still turned away, staring at the hide-covered window, grown dark with the night. \u201cWhether it is my own feelings that have died, or only Isobel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly Isobel?\u201d I echoed.</p> <p>He lay quite still for a moment, facing away.</p><p>\u201cI can still feel shame, at least,\u201d he said, very softly.</p><p>I could tell by the feel of the night that it was very late; the fire had burned low, and the aching of my muscles told me that it was well past my bedtime.</p><p>Ian was getting restless; he stirred in his sleep, moaning, and Rollo got up and nuzzled him, making small whimpering noises. I went to him and wiped his face again, plumped his pillow and straightened his sheets, making comforting murmurs. He was no more than half awake; I held his head and fed him a cup of the warm infusion, sip by sip.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll feel better in the morning.\u201d There were spots visible in the open neck of his shirt\u2014only a few as yet\u2014but the fever was less, and the line between his brows had eased.</p><p>I wiped his face once more and eased him back on his pillow, where he turned a cheek to the cool linen and fell asleep again at once.</p><p>There was plenty of the infusion left. I poured another cup and held it out to Lord John. Surprised, he sat upright and took it from me.</p><p>\u201cAnd now that you\u2019ve come, and seen him\u2014do you still have feelings?\u201d I said.</p><p>He stared at me for a moment, eyes unblinking in the candlelight.</p><p>\u201cI do, yes.\u201d Hand steady as a rock, he picked up the cup and drank. \u201cGod help me,\u201d he added, so casual as almost to sound offhand.</p><p>Ian passed a bad night but dropped off into a fitful doze near dawn. I seized the chance of a little rest myself, and managed a few hours of delectable sleep on the floor before being roused by the the loud braying of Clarence the mule.</p><p>A sociable creature, Clarence was utterly delighted by the approach of anything he regarded as a friend\u2014this category embracing virtually anything on four legs. He gave tongue to his joy in a voice that rang off the mountainside. Rollo, affronted at being thus upstaged in the watchdog department, leapt off Ian\u2019s bed, soared over me, and out through the open window, baying like a werewolf.</p><p>Thus startled out of slumber, I staggered to my feet. Lord John, who was sitting in his shirt at the table, looked startled too, though whether at the racket or at my appearance, I couldn\u2019t tell. I went outside, running my fingers hastily through my disheveled locks, heart beating faster in the hope that it might be Jamie returning.</p><p>My heart fell as I saw that it wasn\u2019t Jamie and Willie, but my disappointment was quickly replaced by astonishment when I saw who the visitor was\u2014Pastor Gottfried, leader of the Lutheran church in Salem. I had met the Pastor now and then, in the homes of parishioners where I had been paying medical calls, but I was more than surprised to find him so far afield.</p><p>It was nearly two days ride from Salem to the Ridge, and the nearest German Lutheran farm was at least fifteen miles away, over rough country. The Pastor was no natural horseman\u2014I could see the mud and dust of repeated falls splashed over his black coat\u2014and I thought that it must be a dire emergency indeed that brought him so far up the mountain.</p><p>\u201cDown, wicked dog!\u201d I said sharply to Rollo, who was baring his teeth and growling at the new arrival, much to the displeasure of the Pastor\u2019s horse. \u201cBe quiet, I say!\u201d</p><p>Rollo gave me a yellow-eyed look and subsided with an air of offended dignity, as though to suggest that if I wished to welcome obvious malefactors onto the premises, he wouldn\u2019t answer for the consequences.</p><p>The Pastor was a tubby little man with a huge, curly gray beard that surrounded his face like a storm cloud, through which his normally beaming face peered like the breaking sun. He wasn\u2019t beaming this morning, though; his round cheeks were the color of suet, puffy lips pale, and his eyes red-rimmed with fatigue.</p><p>\u201cMeine Dame,\u201d he greeted me, doffing his broad-brimmed hat and bowing deeply from the waist. \u201cIst Euer Mann hier?\u201d</p><p>I spoke no more than a few words of crude German, but could easily make out that he was looking for Jamie. I shook my head, gesturing vaguely toward the woods, to indicate Jamie\u2019s absence.</p><p>The Pastor looked even more dismayed than before, nearly wringing his hands in his distress. He said several urgent things in German, then seeing that I didn\u2019t understand him, repeated himself, speaking slower and louder, his stubby body straining for expression, trying by sheer force of will to make me understand.</p><p>I was still shaking my head helplessly when a voice spoke sharply from behind me.</p><p>\u201cWas ist los?\u201d demanded Lord John, emerging into the dooryard. \u201cWas habt Ihr gesagt?\u201d He had put on his breeches, I was glad to see, though he was still barefoot, with his fair hair streaming loose on his shoulders.</p><p>The Pastor gave me a scandalized look, plainly thinking The Worst, but this expression was wiped off his face at once by a further machine-gun rattle of German from Lord John. The Pastor bobbed in apology to me, then turned eagerly to the Englishman, waving his arms and stammering in his haste to tell his story.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I said, having failed to pluck more than a word or two from the Teutonic flood. \u201cWhat on earth is he saying?\u201d</p><p>Grey turned a grim face toward me.</p><p>\u201cDo you know a family named Mueller?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I said, immediate alarm flaring at the name. \u201cI delivered a child to Petronella Mueller, three weeks ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d Grey licked dry lips and glanced at the ground; he didn\u2019t want to tell me. \u201cThe\u2014the child is dead, I am afraid. So is the mother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no.\u201d I sank down on the bench by the door, swept by a feeling of absolute denial. \u201cNo. They can\u2019t be.\u201d</p><p>Grey rubbed a hand over his mouth, nodding as the Pastor went on, waving his small, fat hands in agitation.</p><p>\u201cHe says it was Masern; I think that would be what we call the measle. Flecken, so \u00e4hnlich wie diese?\u201d he demanded of the Pastor, pointing at the remnants of rash still visible on his face.</p><p>The Pastor nodded emphatically, repeating \u201cFlecken, Masern, ja!\u201d and patting his own cheeks.</p><p>\u201cBut what does he want Jamie for?\u201d I asked, bewilderment added to distress.</p><p>\u201cApparently he believes Jamie might be able to reason with the man\u2014with Herr Mueller. Are they friends?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot exactly, no. Jamie hit Gerhard Mueller in the mouth and knocked him down in front of the mill last spring.\u201d</p><p>A muscle twitched in Lord John\u2019s scabbed cheek.</p><p>\u201cI see. I suppose he\u2019s using the term \u2018reason with\u2019 rather loosely, then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMueller can\u2019t be reasoned with by any means more sophisticated than an ax handle,\u201d I said. \u201cBut what is he being unreasonable about?\u201d</p><p>Grey frowned\u2014he didn\u2019t recognize my use of \u201csophisticated,\u201d I realized, though he understood what I meant. He hesitated, then turned back to the small minister and asked something else, listening intently to the resulting torrent of Deutsch.</p><p>Little by little, with constant interruptions and much gesticulation, the story emerged in translation.</p><p>There was, as Lord John had told us earlier, an epidemic of measles in Cross Creek. This had evidently spread into the backcountry; several households in Salem were afflicted, but the Muellers, isolated as they were, had not suffered infection until recently.</p><p>However, the day before the first sign of measles appeared, a small band of Indians had stopped at the Mueller farm asking for food and drink. Mueller, with whose opinions of Indians I was thoroughly well acquainted, had driven them off with considerable abuse. The Indians, offended, had made\u2014said Mueller\u2014mysterious signs toward his house as they left.</p><p>When measles broke out among the family the next day, Mueller was positive that the disease had been brought upon them by means of a hex, placed on his house by the Indians he had rebuffed. He had at once painted antihexing symbols upon his walls, and summoned the Pastor from Salem to perform an exorcism...\u201cI think that is what he said,\u201d Lord John added doubtfully. \u201cThough I am not sure whether he means by that...\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever mind,\u201d I said impatiently. \u201cGo on!\u201d</p><p>None of these precautions availed Mueller, though, and when Petronella and the new baby succumbed to the disease, the old man had lost what little mind he had. Vowing revenge upon the savages who had brought such devastation to his household, he had forced his sons and sons-in-law to accompany him, and ridden off into the woods. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>From this expedition they had returned three days ago, the sons whitefaced and silent, the old man burning with cold satisfaction.</p><p>\u201cIch war dort. Ich habe ihn geschen,\u201d said Herr Gottfried, sweat trickling down his cheeks at the recollection. I was there. I saw.</p><p>Summoned by a hysterical message from the women, the Pastor had ridden into the stableyard, to find two long tails of dark hair hanging from the barn door, stirring gently in the wind above the crudely painted legend Rache.</p><p>\u201cThat means \u2018revenge,\u2019 \u201d Lord John translated for me.</p> <p>\u201cI know,\u201d I said, my mouth so dry I could barely speak. \u201cI\u2019ve read Sherlock Holmes. You mean he...\u201d</p><p>\u201cEvidently so.\u201d</p><p>The Pastor was still speaking; he seized me by the arm and shook it, trying to communicate his urgency. Grey\u2019s look sharpened at whatever the minister was saying, and he broke in with an abrupt question, answered by frenzied noddings.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s coming here. Mueller.\u201d Grey swung round to me, his face set in alarm.</p><p>Terribly upset by the scalps, the Pastor had gone in search of Herr Mueller, only to find that the patriarch had nailed his grisly trophies to the barn and then left the farm, bound\u2014he had said\u2014for Fraser\u2019s Ridge, to see me.</p> <p>If I hadn\u2019t been sitting down already, I might have collapsed at this. I could feel the blood draining from my cheeks, and was sure I looked as pale as Pastor Gottfried.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d I said. \u201cIs he\u2014he couldn\u2019t! He couldn\u2019t think I had done anything to Petronella or the baby. Could he?\u201d I turned in appeal toward the Pastor, who pushed a pudgy, trembling hand through his gray-streaked hair, disordering its carefully larded strands.</p><p>\u201cThe clerical gentleman doesn\u2019t know what Mueller thinks, or what his purpose is in coming here,\u201d said Lord John. He cast an interested eye over the pastor\u2019s unprepossessing form. \u201cMuch to his credit, he set off alone, hell-for-leather after Mueller, and found him two hours later\u2014insensible by the side of the road.\u201d</p><p>The huge old farmer had evidently gone for days without food on his hunt for revenge. Intemperance was not a common failing among the Lutherans, but under the stimulus of fatigue and emotion, Mueller had drunk deeply upon his return, and the enormous draughts of beer he had consumed had been too much for him. Overcome, he had contrived to hobble his mule, but then had wrapped himself in his coat and fallen asleep among the trailing arbutus by the road.</p><p>The Pastor had made no attempt to rouse Mueller, being well acquainted with the man\u2019s temper and feeling it would not be improved by drink. Instead, Gottfried had mounted his own horse and ridden as quickly as he could, trusting to Providence to bring him here in time to warn us.</p><p>He had had no doubt that my Mann would be competent to deal with Mueller, no matter what his state or intentions, but with Jamie gone...</p> <p>Pastor Gottfried looked helplessly from me to Lord John, and back again.</p><p>\u201cVielleicht solten Sie gehen?\u201d he suggested, making his meaning clear with a jerk of his head toward the paddock.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t leave,\u201d I said, and gestured toward the house. \u201cMein\u2014Christ, what\u2019s nephew?\u2014Mein junger Mann ist nicht gut.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIhr Neffe ist krank\u201d Lord John corrected briskly. \u201cHaben Sie jemals Masern gehabt?\u201d</p><p>The Pastor shook his head, distress altering to alarm.</p><p>\u201cHe hasn\u2019t had the measles,\u201d Lord John said, turning to me. \u201cHe mustn\u2019t stay here, then, or he will put himself in danger of contracting the disease, is that so?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d The shock was beginning to recede slightly, and I was starting to pull myself together. \u201cYes, he should go at once. It\u2019s safe for him to be near you, you aren\u2019t contagious any longer. Ian is, though.\u201d I made a vain attempt at smoothing my hair, which was standing on end\u2014little wonder if it was, I thought. Then I thought of the scalps on Mueller\u2019s barn door and my hair actually did stand on end, my own scalp rippling with horror.</p><p>Lord John was speaking authoritatively to the little Pastor, urging him toward his horse by means of a grip on his sleeve. Gottfried was making protests, but increasingly weak ones. He glanced back at me, round face full of trouble.</p> <p>I tried to smile reassuringly at him, though I felt as distressed as he did.</p><p>\u201cDanke,\u201d I said. \u201cTell him it will be all right, will you?\u201d I said to Lord John. \u201cHe won\u2019t go, otherwise.\u201d He nodded briefly.</p><p>\u201cI have. I told him I am a soldier; that I will not let any harm come to you.\u201d</p><p>The Pastor stood for a moment, hand on his horse\u2019s bridle, talking earnestly to Lord John. Then he dropped the bridle, turned with decision and crossed the dooryard to me. Reaching up, he laid a hand gently on my tousled head.</p><p>\u201cSeid gesegnet,\u201d he said. \u201cBenedicite.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe said\u2014\u201d began Lord John.</p><p>\u201cI understand.\u201d</p><p>We stood silently in the dooryard, watching Gottfried make his way through the chestnut grove. It seemed incongruously peaceful out here, with a soft autumn sun warm on my shoulders, and birds going about their business overhead. I heard the far-off knocking of a woodpecker, and the liquid duet of the mockingbirds that lived in the big blue spruce. No owls, but naturally there would be no owls now; it was midmorning.</p><p>Who? I wondered, as another aspect of the tragedy belatedly occurred to me. Who had been the target of Mueller\u2019s blind revenge? The Mueller farm was several days ride from the mountain line that separated Indian territory from the settlements, but he could have reached several Tuscarora or Cherokee villages, depending on his direction.</p><p>Had he entered a village? If so, what carnage had he and his sons left behind? Worse, what carnage might ensue?</p><p>I shuddered, cold in spite of the sun. Mueller was not the only man who believed in revenge. The family, the clan, the village of whomever he had murdered\u2014they would seek vengeance for their slain, as well; and they might not stop with the Muellers\u2014if they even knew the identity of the killers.</p><p>And if they did not, but only knew the murderers to be white...I shuddered again. I had heard enough massacre stories to realize that the victims very seldom did anything to provoke their fate; they only had the misfortune of being in the wrong place at the wrong time. Fraser\u2019s Ridge lay directly between Mueller\u2019s farm and the Indian villages\u2014which at the moment seemed distinctly the wrong place to be.</p><p>\u201cOh, God, I wish Jamie were here.\u201d I wasn\u2019t aware that I had spoken aloud, until Lord John replied.</p><p>\u201cSo do I,\u201d he said. \u201cThough I begin to think that William may be far safer with him than the boy might be here\u2014and not only by reason of the illness.\u201d</p><p>I glanced at him, realizing suddenly how weak he still was; this was the first time he had been out of bed in a week. He was white-faced under the remnants of his rash, and he was gripping the doorjamb for support, to keep from falling down.</p><p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t even be up!\u201d I exclaimed, and grasped him by the arm. \u201cGo in and lie down at once.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am quite all right,\u201d he said irritably, but he didn\u2019t jerk away, or protest when I insisted he get back into bed.</p><p>I knelt to check Ian, who was tossing restlessly on the trundle, blazing with fever. His eyes were shut, his features swollen and disfigured with the emergent rash, the glands in his neck round and hard as eggs.</p><p>Rollo poked an inquiring nose under my elbow, nudged his master gently and whined.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll be all right,\u201d I said firmly. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you go outside and keep an eye out for visitors, hm?\u201d</p><p>Rollo ignored this advice, though, and instead sat patiently watching as I wrung out a rag in cool water and bathed Ian. I nudged him half awake, brushed his hair, gave him the chamber pot, and coaxed bee-balm syrup into him\u2014all the time listening for the sound of hooves, and Clarence\u2019s joyful announcement that company was coming.</p><p>It was a long day. After several hours of starting at every sound and looking over my shoulder at every step, I finally settled into the day\u2019s work. I nursed Ian, who was feverish and miserable, fed the stock, weeded the garden, picked tender young cucumbers for pickling, and set Lord John, who was disposed to be helpful, to work shelling beans.</p><p>I looked into the woods with longing, on my way from privy to goat-pen. I would have given a lot simply to walk away into those cool green depths. It wouldn\u2019t have been the first time I\u2019d had such an impulse. But the autumn sun beat down on the Ridge, and the hours wore on in tranquil peace, without a sign of Gerhard Mueller.</p><p>\u201cTell me about this Mueller,\u201d Lord John said. His appetite was coming back; he\u2019d finished his helping of fried mush, though he pushed aside the salad of dandelion greens and pokeweed.</p><p>I plucked a tender stalk of pokeweed from the bowl and nibbled it myself, enjoying the sharp taste.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s the head of a large family; German Lutherans, as you no doubt gathered. They live about fifteen miles from here, down in the river valley.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGerhard is big, and he\u2019s stubborn, as you no doubt gathered. Speaks a few words of English, but not much. He\u2019s old, but my God, he\u2019s strong!\u201d I could still see the old man, shoulders corded with stringy muscle, tossing fifty-pound sacks of flour into his wagon like so many sacks of feathers.</p><p>\u201cThis fight he had with Jamie\u2014did he appear the sort to hold a grudge?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s very definitely the sort to hold a grudge, but not about that. It wasn\u2019t really a fight. It\u2014\u201d I shook my head, searching for a way to describe it. \u201cDo you know anything about mules?\u201d</p><p>His fair brows lifted and he smiled.</p><p>\u201cA bit, yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, Gerhard Mueller is a mule. He\u2019s not really bad-tempered, and he isn\u2019t precisely stupid\u2014but he doesn\u2019t pay a great deal of attention to anything other than what\u2019s in his head, and it takes a good deal of force to switch his attention to anything else.\u201d</p><p>I had not been present at the altercation in the mill, but had had it described to me by Ian. The old man had got it firmly stuck into his head that Felicia Woolam, one of the mill owner\u2019s three daughters, had given him short weight and owed him another sack of flour.</p><p>In vain, Felicia protested that he had brought her five bags of wheat; she had ground them, and filled four bags with the resulting flour. The difference, she insisted, was due to the chaff and hulls removed from the grain. Five bags of wheat equalled four bags of flour.</p><p>\u201cF\u00fcnf!\u201d Mueller had said, waving his open hand in her face. \u201cEs gibt f\u00fcnf!\u201d He would not be persuaded otherwise, and began to curse volubly in German, glowering and backing the girl into a corner.</p><p>Ian, having tried without success to distract the old man\u2019s attention, had dashed outside to fetch Jamie from his conversation with Mr. Woolam. Both men had come hurriedly inside, but had no more success than Ian in changing Mueller\u2019s conviction that he had been cheated.</p><p>Ignoring their exhortations, he had advanced on Felicia, clearly intent on taking by force an extra bag of flour from the stack behind her.</p><p>\u201cAt that point, Jamie gave up trying to reason with him, and hit him,\u201d I said. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He had at first been reluctant to do so, Mueller being nearly seventy, but rapidly changed his mind when his first blow bounced off Mueller\u2019s jaw as though it had been made of seasoned oakwood.</p><p>The old man had turned on him like a cornered boar, whereupon Jamie had struck him first in the stomach, and then in the mouth as hard as possible, knocking Mueller down and splitting his own knuckles on the old man\u2019s teeth.</p><p>With a word to Woolam\u2014who was a Quaker and thus opposed to violence\u2014he had then seized Mueller by the legs and dragged the dazed farmer outside, where one of the Mueller sons was waiting patiently in the wagon. Hauling the old man up by the collar, Jamie had pinned him against the wagon and held him there, talking pleasantly in German, until Mr. Woolam\u2014having hastily rebagged the flour\u2014came out and loaded five sacks into the wagon, under the gimlet eye of the old man.</p><p>Mueller had counted them twice, carefully, then turned to Jamie, and said with dignity, \u201cDanke, mein Herr.\u201d He had then climbed into the wagon beside his bemused son, and driven away.</p> <p>Grey scratched at the remnants of his rash, smiling.</p><p>\u201cI see. So he appeared to hold no ill will?\u201d</p><p>I shook my head, chewing, then swallowed.</p><p>\u201cNot at all. He was kindness itself to me, when I went to the farm to help with Petronella\u2019s baby.\u201d My throat closed suddenly on the renewed realization that they were gone, and I choked on the bitter taste of the dandelion leaves, bile rising in my throat.</p><p>\u201cHere.\u201d Grey pushed the pot of ale across the table toward me.</p> <p>I drank deeply, the cool sourness soothing for a moment the deeper bitterness of spirit. I set the pot down and sat for a moment, eyes closed. There was a fresh-smelling breeze from the window, but the sun was warm on the tabletop under my hands. All the tiny joys of physical existence were still mine, and I was the more acutely aware of them, for the knowledge that they had been so abruptly taken from others\u2014from those who had barely tasted them.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d I said, opening my eyes.</p><p>Grey was watching me, with an expression of deep sympathy.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d think it wouldn\u2019t be such a shock,\u201d I said, needing suddenly to try to explain. \u201cThey die here so easily. The young ones, especially. It isn\u2019t as though I haven\u2019t seen it before. And there\u2019s so seldom anything I can do.\u201d</p><p>I felt something warm on my cheek, and was surprised to find it was a tear. He reached into his sleeve, pulled out a handkerchief and handed it to me. It wasn\u2019t especially clean, but I didn\u2019t mind.</p><p>\u201cI did sometimes wonder what he saw in you,\u201d he said, his tone deliberately light. \u201cJamie.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, you did? How flattering.\u201d I sniffed, and blew my nose.</p><p>\u201cWhen he began to speak of you, both of us thought you dead,\u201d he pointed out. \u201cAnd while you are undoubtedly a handsome woman, it was never of your looks that he spoke.\u201d</p><p>To my surprise, he picked up my hand and held it lightly.</p><p>\u201cYou have his courage,\u201d he said.</p><p>That made me laugh, if only halfheartedly.</p><p>\u201cIf you only knew,\u201d I said.</p><p>He didn\u2019t reply to that, but smiled faintly. His thumb ran lightly over the knuckles of my hand, his touch light and warm.</p><p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t hold back for fear of skinned knuckles,\u201d he said. \u201cNeither do you, I think.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d I took a deep breath and wiped my nose; the tears had stopped. \u201cI\u2019m a doctor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you are,\u201d he said quietly, and paused. \u201cI have not thanked you for my life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t me. There isn\u2019t really anything much I can do, for something like a disease. All I can do is to...be there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA little more than that,\u201d he said dryly, and released my hand. \u201cWill you have more ale?\u201d</p><p>I was beginning to see quite clearly what Jamie saw in John Grey.</p><p>The afternoon passed quietly. Ian tossed and moaned, but by late afternoon, the rash was fully developed, and his fever seemed to drop a little. He wouldn\u2019t be wanting food, but perhaps I could induce him to take a little milk broth. The thought reminded me that it was nearly milking time, and I stood up, with a murmured word to Lord John, and put aside my mending.</p><p>I opened the cabin door and stepped out, directly in front of Gerhard Mueller, who was standing in the dooryard.</p><p>Mueller\u2019s eyes were a reddish brown, and seemed always to be burning with an inner intensity. They burned more brightly now, for the bruised frailty of the flesh surrounding them. The deep-set eyes fixed on me, and he nodded, once, and then again.</p><p>Mueller had shrunk since I had last seen him. All his flesh had fallen away; still a huge man, he was more bone than muscle now, cadaverous and ancient. His eyes were fixed on mine, the only spark of life in a face like crumpled paper.</p><p>\u201cHerr Mueller,\u201d I said. My voice sounded calm to my own ears; I hoped it sounded the same to him. \u201cWie geht es Euch?\u201d</p><p>The old man stood swaying in front of me, as though the evening breeze might knock him down. I didn\u2019t know if he had lost his mount, or left it down below the ridge, but there was no sign of horse or mule.</p><p>He took a step toward me, and I took one back, involuntarily.</p><p>\u201cFrau Klara,\u201d he said, and there was a note of pleading in his voice.</p><p>I stopped, wanting to call out to Lord John, but hesitant. He wouldn\u2019t call me by my first name if he meant to do me harm.</p><p>\u201cThey are dead,\u201d he said. \u201cMein M\u00e4dchen. Mein Kind.\u201d Tears welled suddenly in the bloodshot eyes, and ran slowly down the weather-beaten grooves of his face. The misery in his eyes was so acute that I reached out and took his huge, work-scarred old hand in mine.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>He nodded again, his old mouth working. He let me lead him to the bench by the door, where he sat down quite suddenly, as though all the strength had gone out of his legs.</p><p>The door opened, and John Grey came out. He had his pistol in his hand, but when I shook my head at him, he slid it at once into his shirt. The old man had not let go of my hand; he pulled, forcing me to sit down beside him.</p><p>\u201cGn\u00e4dige Frau,\u201d he said, and suddenly turned and embraced me, hugging me tight against his filthy coat. He shook with soundless crying, and even knowing what he had done, I put my own arms around him.</p><p>He smelled dreadful, sour and reeking with old age and sorrow, with beer and sweat and filth, and somewhere under all the other odors was the fetor of dried blood. I shuddered, caught in a web of pity, horror, and revulsion, but could not pull away.</p><p>He let go, finally, and seemed suddenly to see John Grey, who was hovering nearby, not sure whether to intervene or not. The old man started at sight of him.</p><p>\u201cMein Gott!\u201d he exclaimed, in tones of horror. \u201cEr hat Masern!\u201d The sun was sinking fast, bathing the dooryard in bloody light. It struck Grey full in the face, highlighting the darkened spots on his face, flushing his skin with red.</p><p>Mueller turned to me, and frantically seized my face between his huge, horny paws. His thumbs scraped across my cheeks, and an expression of relief came into his sunken eyes, as he saw that my skin was still clear.</p><p>\u201cGott sei dank\u2019,\u201d he said, and letting go of my face, began to rummage in his coat, saying something in German so urgent and so mumbled that I could make out no more than the occasional word.</p><p>\u201cHe says he was afraid he would be too late, and is glad that he was not,\u201d Grey said, seeing my bewilderment. He eyed the old farmer with suspicious dislike. \u201cHe says he\u2019s brought you something\u2014a charm of some kind. It will ward off the curse, and keep you safe from the illness.\u201d</p><p>The old man withdrew an object wrapped in cloth from the recesses of his coat, and laid it in my lap, still babbling in German.</p><p>\u201cHe thanks you for all your help to his family\u2014he thinks you are a fine woman, as dear to him as one of his daughters-in-law\u2014he says that...\u201d Mueller unfolded the cloth with shaking hands, and the words died in Grey\u2019s throat.</p><p>I opened my mouth, but made no sound. I must have made some involuntary movement, for the cloth slipped suddenly to the ground, spilling out the sheaf of white-streaked hair to which a small silver ornament still clung. With it was the leather pouch, the woodpecker\u2019s feathers draggled with blood.</p><p>Mueller was still speaking, and Grey was trying to, but I was only dimly aware of their words. Inside my ears echoed the words I had heard a year before, down by the stream, in Gabrielle\u2019s soft voice, translating for Nayawenne.</p><p>Her name meant. \u201cIt may be; it will happen.\u201d Now it had, and all that was left me for consolation was her words: \u201cShe says you must not be troubled; sickness is sent from the gods. It won\u2019t be your fault.\u201d</p><p>29</p><p>CHARNEL HOUSES</p><p>Jamie smelled the smoke long before the village came in sight. Willie saw him stiffen, and tensed in his own saddle, glancing warily around them.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d the boy whispered. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI dinna ken.\u201d He kept his own voice low, though there was no evidence that anyone was near enough to hear them. He swung down from his horse and handed the reins to Willie, nodding toward a vine-covered cliff face whose foot was shrouded in brush.</p><p>\u201cTake the horses behind the cliff, lad,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a deer path there, that leads up to a spruce grove. Get well in among the trees, and wait there for me.\u201d He hesitated, not wanting to scare the boy, but there was no help for it.</p><p>\u201cIf I should not come back by dark,\u201d he said, \u201cleave at once. Dinna wait for the morning; go back to the wee stream we just crossed, turn to your left, and follow it to a place where there\u2019s a waterfall\u2014you\u2019ll hear it, even in the dark. Behind the falls there\u2019s a wee cave; the Indians use it when they\u2019re hunting.\u201d</p><p>A small rim of white showed all the way around the lad\u2019s blue irises. Jamie took a firm grip of the boy\u2019s leg, just above the knee, to impress the directions upon him, and felt a quiver run through the long muscle of the thigh.</p><p>\u201cStay there till the morning,\u201d he said, \u201cand if I havena caught ye up by then\u2014go home. Keep the sun on your left in the morning, on your right after noon, and in two days give your horse his head; you\u2019ll be near enough home for him to find the way, I think.\u201d</p><p>He took a deep breath, wondering what else to say, but there was nothing.</p><p>\u201cGod go with ye, lad.\u201d He gave Willie as reassuring a smile as he could muster, clapped the horse on the rump to start it, and turned toward the scent of burning.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t the normal smell of village fires; not even of the big ceremonial fires that Ian had told him of, when they burned whole trees in the firepit in the center of the village. Those were the size of Beltane fires, Ian said, and he knew the crackle and size of such a blaze. This was much bigger.</p><p>With great caution he made a wide circle, at last coming to a small hill from which he knew that he could gain a view of the village. As soon as he emerged from the forest\u2019s shelter, though, he saw it. Rolling plumes of gray smoke were rising from the smoldering remnants of every longhouse in the village.</p><p>A thick brownish pall of smoke hung over the forest as far as he could see. He took a quick breath, coughed, and hastily drew a fold of his plaid across his nose and mouth, crossing himself with his free hand. He had smelled burning flesh before, and a sudden cold sweat bathed him at the memory of the funeral pyres of Culloden. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>His soul misgave him at the sight of the desolation below, but he searched carefully, squinting through the eye-stinging haze for any sign of life among the ruins. Nothing moved save the wavering smoke, its wraiths gliding silent, wind-driven through the blackened houses. Had it been the Cherokee or the Creek, raiding up from the south? Or one of the remnant Algonkian tribes to the north, the Nanticokes or the Tuteloes?</p><p>A gust of wind smote him full in the face with the stink of charred flesh. He bent and vomited, trying to rid himself of his bone-deep knowledge of burnt crofts and murdered families. As he straightened up, wiping his mouth on his sleeve, he heard a dog bark in the distance.</p><p>He turned and went quickly downhill toward the sound, his heart beating faster. Raiders would not bring dogs. If there were survivors of the massacre, the dogs would be with them.</p><p>Still, he went as silently as possible, not daring to call out. That fire had been burning for less than a day; half the walls were still standing. Whoever had set it was still nearby, without a doubt.</p> <p>It was a dog that met him; a big yellow mongrel, one that he recognized as belonging to Ian\u2019s friend Onakara. Off its normal territory, the dog neither barked nor rushed him, but stood its ground in the shadow of a pine tree, ears laid back and growling softly. He walked toward it slowly, holding out his closed fist.</p><p>\u201cBalach math,\u201d he murmured to it. \u201cHold. Where are your people, then?\u201d</p><p>The dog extended its muzzle, still growling, and sniffed at the proffered hand. Its nostrils twitched, and it relaxed a little, nosing closer in recognition.</p><p>He felt rather than saw a human presence, and looked up into the face of the dog\u2019s owner. Onakara\u2019s face was painted, with white streaks that ran from hair to chin, and behind the pale bars of paint, his eyes were dead.</p><p>\u201cWhat enemy has done this?\u201d Jamie asked, in his halting Tuscaroran. \u201cDoes your uncle still live?\u201d</p> <p>Onakara didn\u2019t answer, but turned and went back into the forest, followed by his dog. Jamie came after them, and within a half-hour\u2019s walk emerged into a small clearing where the survivors had made a temporary camp.</p><p>As he passed through the camp, he saw faces he knew. Some of them registered awareness of his presence; others stared sightlessly into a distance he knew too well\u2014the infinite prospect of sorrow and despair. All too many were missing.</p><p>He had seen this before, and the ghosts of war and murder dragged at his footsteps as he passed. He had seen a young woman in the Highlands, sitting on the doorstep of her smoking house with her husband\u2019s body at her feet; she had worn the same stunned look as the young Indian woman by the sycamore tree.</p><p>Slowly, though, he became aware that something was different here. Wigwam shelters dotted the clearing; bundles lay piled near the edges of the clearing, and horses and ponies were tethered among the trees. This was no hasty exodus of people plundered and fleeing for their lives\u2014it was an orderly retreat, with most of their worldly goods neatly packed and brought along. What in God\u2019s name had happened in Anna Ooka this day?</p><p>Nacognaweto was in a wigwam at the far side of the clearing. Onakara lifted the flap and silently nodded Jamie in.</p><p>A sudden spark leapt in the older man\u2019s eyes as he entered, but then died at once as Nacognaweto saw his face, with the shadow of reflected grief on it. The chieftain closed his eyes for a moment, and reopened them, composed.</p> <p>\u201cYou have not met with her who heals, nor with the woman whose longhouse I dwelt in?\u201d</p><p>Used to the Indian notion that it was rude to speak a person\u2019s name aloud save for the sake of ceremony, Jamie knew he must refer to Gabrielle and old Nayawenne. He shook his head, knowing that that gesture must destroy the last flicker of hope the other had held. It was no consolation, but he took the flask of brandy from his belt, and offered that in mute apology for his failure to bring good news.</p><p>Nacognaweto accepted it, and with a tilt of his head, summoned a woman, who dug about in one of the bundles by the hide wall and produced a gourd cup. The Indian poured a quantity of spirit that would flatten a Scotsman, and drank deeply before handing the gourd to Jamie.</p><p>He took a small sip for the sake of politeness, and handed back the gourd. It wasn\u2019t polite to come to the point of a visit at once, but he had no time for palaver and he could see that the other had no heart for it.</p><p>\u201cWhat has happened?\u201d he asked bluntly.</p><p>\u201cSickness,\u201d Nacognaweto answered softly. His eyes shone wetly, watering from the fumes of brandy. \u201cWe are cursed.\u201d</p><p>Haltingly, the story emerged, between the swallows of brandy. Measles had broken out in the village and swept through it like fire. Within the first week, a quarter of the people lay dead; now, at the end, there were no more than a quarter left alive.</p><p>When the sickness had begun, Nayawenne had sung over the victims. When more fell sick, she had gone out into the forest in search of...Jamie\u2019s grasp of Tuscarora was not sufficient to interpret the words. A charm, he thought it was\u2014some plant? Or perhaps she looked for a vision that would tell them what to do, how to make amends for whatever evil had brought the sickness on them, or the name of the enemy who had cursed them. Gabrielle and Berthe had gone with her, because she was old and should not go alone\u2014and none of the three had come back.</p> <p>Nacognaweto was swaying very slightly as he sat, the gourd cup clasped in his hands. The woman bent over him, trying to take it away, but he shrugged her aside, and she let him be.</p><p>They had searched for the women, but there was no sign. Perhaps they had been taken by raiders, perhaps they too had fallen ill, and died in the forest. But the village had no shaman to speak for them, and the gods had not listened.</p><p>\u201cWe are cursed.\u201d</p><p>Nacognaweto\u2019s words were slurred, and the cup tilted dangerously in his hands. The woman knelt behind him and put her hands on his shoulders, to steady him.</p><p>\u201cWe left the dead in the houses, and set fire to them,\u201d she said to Jamie. Her eyes were black with sadness, too, but some life still lurked within them. \u201cNow we will go north, to Oglanethaka.\u201d Her hands tightened on Nacognaweto\u2019s shoulders, and she nodded to Jamie. \u201cYou go now.\u201d</p><p>He went, the grief of the place clinging to him like the smoke that permeated clothes and hair. And within his charred heart as he left the camp sprang a small green shoot of selfishness, relief that the grief was\u2014for this time\u2014not his own. His woman still lived. His children were safe.</p><p>He looked up at the sky and saw the dull glow of the sinking sun reflected in the pall of smoke. He lengthened his stride to a hill-walker\u2019s lope that ate the miles. There was not much time; night was coming fast.</p><p>PART EIGHT</p><p>Beaucoup</p><p>30</p><p>INTO THIN AIR</p><p>Oxford, April 1971</p><p>No,\u201d he said positively. Roger swung round to peer out the window at the soggy sky, holding the phone to his ear. \u201cNot a chance. I\u2019m off to Scotland next week, I\u2019ve told you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, now, Rog,\u201d coaxed the Dean\u2019s voice. \u201cIt\u2019s just your sort of thing. And it wouldn\u2019t put you off your schedule by a lot; you could be in the Hielands a-chasin\u2019 the deer this time a month\u2014and you told me yourself your girrrl\u2019s not due till July.\u201d</p><p>Roger gritted his teeth at the Dean\u2019s put-on Scots accent, and opened his mouth to say no again, but wasn\u2019t quite fast enough.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Americans, too, Rog,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019re so good with Americans. Speaking of girrls,\u201d she added, with a brief chortle.</p><p>\u201cNow, look, Edwina,\u201d he said, summoning patience, \u201cI\u2019ve things to do this holiday. And they don\u2019t include herding American tourists round the museums in London.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no,\u201d she assured him. \u201cWe\u2019ve paid minders to do the touristy bits; all you\u2019d need to be concerned with is the conference itself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMoney, Rog,\u201d she purred down the phone, pulling out her secret weapon. \u201cIt\u2019s Americans, I said. You know what that means.\u201d She paused pregnantly, to allow him to contemplate the fee for running a week-long conference for a gang of visiting American scholars whose official minder had fallen ill. By comparison to his normal salary, it was an astronomical sum.</p><p>\u201cAh...\u201d He could feel himself weakening.</p><p>\u201cI hear you\u2019re thinking of getting married one of these days, Rog. Buy an extra haggis for the wedding, wouldn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnyone ever tell you how subtle you are, Edwina?\u201d he demanded.</p><p>\u201cNever.\u201d She chortled again briefly, then snapped into executive mode. \u201cRight, then, see you Monday week for the plans meeting,\u201d and hung up.</p><p>He resisted the futile impulse to slam the receiver down, and dropped it on the hook instead.</p><p>Maybe it wasn\u2019t a bad thing after all, he thought bleakly. He didn\u2019t care about the money, in all truth, but having a conference to run might keep his mind off things. He picked up the much crumpled letter that lay next to the phone, and smoothed it out, his eye traveling over the paragraphs of apology without really reading them.</p><p>So sorry, she\u2019d said. Special invitation to engineering conference in Sri Lanka (God, did all Americans go to conferences in the summer?) valuable contacts, job interviews (job interviews? Christ, he knew it, she was never coming back!)\u2014couldn\u2019t pass it up. Desperately sorry. See you in September. I\u2019ll write. Love.</p><p>\u201cYeah, right,\u201d he said. \u201cLove.\u201d</p><p>He balled up the sheet again and threw it at the dresser. It bounced off the edge of the silver picture frame and fell to the carpet.</p><p>\u201cYou could have told me straight,\u201d he said aloud. \u201cSo you did find someone else; you were right then, weren\u2019t you? You were wise, and me the fool. But could you not be honest, ye lying wee bitch?\u201d</p><p>He was trying to work up a good rage; anything to fill the emptiness in the pit of his stomach. It wasn\u2019t helping.</p><p>He took the picture in its silver frame, wanting to break it to bits, wanting to clutch it to his heart. In the end, he only stood looking at it for a long time, then put it down gently, on its face.</p><p>\u201cSo sorry,\u201d he said. \u201cYeah, so am I.\u201d</p><p>May 1971</p><p>The boxes were waiting for him at the porter\u2019s lodge when he returned to college on the last day of the conference, hot, tired, and thoroughly fed up with Americans. There were five of them, large wooden crates plastered with the bright stickers of international shipping.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d Roger juggled the clipboard the deliveryman handed him, groping in his pocket with the other hand for a tip.</p><p>\u201cWell, I dunno, do I?\u201d The man, truculent and sweating from the trip through the courtyard to the porter\u2019s lodge, dropped the last crate on top of the others with a bang. \u201cAll yours, mate.\u201d</p><p>Roger gave the top box an experimental shove. If it wasn\u2019t books, it was lead. The push had shown him the edge of an envelope taped securely to the box below, though. With some difficulty, he pried it loose and ripped it open.</p><p>You told me once that your father said that everyone needs a history, the note inside read. This is mine. Will you keep it with yours? There was neither salutation nor closing; only the single letter \u201cB,\u201d written in bold angular strokes. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He stared at it for a moment, then folded the note and put it in his shirt pocket. Squatting carefully, he got hold of the top crate and lifted it in his arms. Christ, it must weigh sixty pounds at least!</p><p>Sweating, Roger dropped the crate on the floor of his sitting room and went through to the tiny bedroom, where he scrabbled through a drawer. Armed with a screwdriver and a bottle of beer, he came back to deal with the box. He tried to damp down his rising feelings of excitement, but couldn\u2019t. Will you keep it with yours? Did a girl send half her belongings to a bloke she meant to break off with?</p><p>\u201cHistory, eh?\u201d he muttered. \u201cMuseum quality, by the way you packed it.\u201d The contents had been double-boxed, with a layer of excelsior between, and the inner box, once opened, revealed a mysterious array of lumpy, newspaper-wrapped bundles and smaller boxes.</p><p>He picked up a sturdy shoe box and peeked inside. Photographs; old ones with scalloped edges, and newer ones, glossy and colored. The edge of a large studio portrait showed, and he pulled it out.</p> <p>It was Claire Randall, much as he had last seen her; amber eyes warm and startling under a tumble of brown-silk curls, a slight smile on the lush, delicate mouth. He shoved it back in the box, feeling like a murderer.</p><p>What emerged from the layers of newsprint was a very aptly named Raggedy Ann doll, its painted face so faded that only the shoe-button eyes remained, fixed in a blank and challenging stare. Its dress was torn but had been carefully mended, the soft cloth body stained but clean.</p><p>The next bundle yielded a tattered Mickey Mouse hat, with a tiny pink foam-rubber bow still fixed between its perky ears. A cheap music box, that played \u201cOver the Rainbow\u201d when he opened it. A stuffed dog, synthetic fur worn away in patches. A faded red sweatshirt, a man\u2019s size Medium. It might have fit Brianna, but somehow Roger knew it had been Frank\u2019s. A ragged dressing gown in quilted maroon silk. On an impulse, he pressed it to his nose. Claire. Her scent brought her vividly to life, a faint smell of musk and green things, and he dropped the garment, shaken.</p><p>Under the layer of trivia there was more substantial treasure. The weight of the crate was caused mostly by three large flat chests at the bottom, each containing a silver dinner service, carefully wrapped in gray antitarnishing cloth. Each chest had a typewritten note tucked inside, giving the provenance and history of the silver.</p><p>A French silver-gilt service, with rope-knot borders, maker\u2019s mark DG. Acquired by William S. Randall, 1842. A George III Old English pattern, acquired 1776 Edward K. Randall, Esq. Husk Shell pattern, by Charles Boyton, acquired 1903 by Quentin Lambert Beauchamp, given as a wedding present to Franklin Randall and Claire Beauchamp. The family silver.</p> <p>With a growing puzzlement, Roger went on, laying each item carefully on the floor beside him, the objects of vertu and objects of use that comprised Brianna Randall\u2019s history. History. Jesus, why had she called it that?</p><p>Alarm pricked the puzzlement as another thought occurred to him, and he grabbed the lid, checking the address label. Oxford. Yes, she had sent them here. Why here, when she\u2019d known\u2014or thought\u2014that he meant to be in Scotland all summer? He would have been, if not for the last-minute conference\u2014and he hadn\u2019t told her about that.</p><p>Tucked in the last corner was a jewelry box, a small but substantial container. Inside were several rings, brooches, and sets of earrings. The cairngorm brooch he had given her for her birthday was there. Necklaces and chains. Two things weren\u2019t.</p><p>The silver bracelet he had given her\u2014and her grandmother\u2019s pearls.</p><p>\u201cJesus bloody Christ.\u201d He looked again, just to be sure, dumping out the glittering junk and spreading it on his counterpane. No pearls. Certainly no string of baroque Scottish pearls, spaced with antique gold roundels.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t be wearing them, not to an engineering conference in Sri Lanka. The pearls were an heirloom to her, not an ornament. She seldom wore them. They were her link with\u2014</p> <p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t,\u201d he said aloud. \u201cGod, tell me you didn\u2019t do it!\u201d</p><p>He dropped the jewel box on the bed, and thundered down the stairs to the telephone room.</p><p>It took forever to get the international operator on the line, and a longer time yet of vague electronic poppings and buzzings, before he heard the click of connection, followed by a faint ringing. One ring, two, then a click, and his heart leapt. She was home!</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re sorry,\u201d said a woman\u2019s pleasant, impersonal voice, \u201cthat number has been disconnected, or is no longer in service.\u201d</p><p>God, she couldn\u2019t have! Could she? Yes, she bloody could, the reckless wee coof! Where in hell was she?</p><p>He drummed his fingers restlessly against his thigh, fuming, as the transatlantic phone line clicked and hummed, while connections were made, while he dealt with the endless delays and stupidities of hospital switchboards and secretaries. But at last he heard a familiar voice in his ear, deep and resonant.</p><p>\u201cJoseph Abernathy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDr. Abernathy? This will be Roger Wakefield here. Do you know where Brianna is?\u201d he demanded without preliminary.</p> <p>The deep voice rose slightly in surprise.</p><p>\u201cWith you. Isn\u2019t she?\u201d</p><p>A cold chill washed over Roger, and he gripped the receiver harder, as though he could force it to give him the answer he wanted.</p><p>\u201cShe is not,\u201d he made himself say, as calmly as he could. \u201cShe meant to come in the fall, after she took her degree and went to some conference.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. No, that\u2019s not right. She finished her coursework the end of April\u2014I took her to dinner to celebrate\u2014and she said she was going straight out to Scotland, without waiting for commencement. Wait, let me think...yeah, that\u2019s right; my son Lenny drove her to the airport...when? Yeah, Tuesday...the 27th. You mean to say she didn\u2019t get there?\u201d Dr. Abernathy\u2019s voice rose in agitation.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know whether she got here or not.\u201d Roger\u2019s free hand was clenched into a fist. \u201cShe didn\u2019t tell me she was coming.\u201d He forced himself to take a deep breath. \u201cWhere was she flying to\u2014which city, do you know? London? Edinburgh?\u201d She might have meant to surprise him with a sudden, unexpected arrival. He\u2019d been surprised, all right, but he doubted that was her intention.</p><p>Visions of kidnapping, assault, IRA bombings, drifted through his mind. Almost anything might have happened to a girl traveling alone in a large city\u2014and almost anything that could have happened would be preferable to what his gut was telling him had happened. Damn the woman!</p><p>\u201cInverness,\u201d Dr. Abernathy\u2019s voice was saying in his ear. \u201cBoston to Edinburgh, then the train to Inverness.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Jesus.\u201d It was both a curse and a prayer. If she had left Boston on Tuesday, she would likely have made Inverness sometime on the Thursday. And Friday was the thirtieth day of April\u2014the eve of Beltane, the ancient fire feast, when the hilltops of old Scotland had blazed with the flames of purification and fertility. When\u2014perhaps\u2014the door to the fairies\u2019 hill of Craigh na Dun lay widest open.</p><p>Abernathy\u2019s voice quacked in his ear, urgently demanding. He forced his attention to focus on it.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said, with some difficulty. \u201cNo, she didn\u2019t. I\u2019m still in Oxford. I had no idea.\u201d</p><p>The empty air between them vibrated, the silence filled with dread. He had to ask. He took another breath\u2014he seemed to be taking them one at a time, each one a conscious effort\u2014and changed his grip on the receiver, wiping his cramped and sweaty palm on the leg of his trousers.</p><p>\u201cDr. Abernathy,\u201d he said carefully. \u201cIt\u2019s just possible that Brianna\u2019s gone to her mother\u2014to Claire. Tell me\u2014do you know where she is?\u201d</p><p>The silence this time was charged with wariness.</p><p>\u201cAh...no.\u201d Abernathy\u2019s voice came slowly, reluctant with caution. \u201cNo, afraid I don\u2019t. Not exactly.\u201d</p><p>Not exactly. Great way to put it. Roger rubbed a hand over his face, feeling the stubble rasp under his palm.</p><p>\u201cLet me ask you this,\u201d Roger said carefully. \u201cHave you ever heard the name Jamie Fraser?\u201d</p><p>The line was utterly silent in his hand. Then there came a deep sigh in his ear.</p><p>\u201cOh, Jesus Christ on a piece of toast,\u201d Dr. Abernathy said. \u201cShe did it.\u201d</p><p>Wouldn\u2019t you?</p><p>That was what Joe Abernathy had said to him, at the conclusion of their lengthy conversation, and the question lingered in his mind as he drove north, barely noticing the road signs that whizzed past, blurred by the rain.</p><p>Wouldn\u2019t you?</p><p>\u201cI would,\u201d Abernathy had said. \u201cIf you didn\u2019t know your dad, never had known him\u2014and all of a sudden, you found out where he was? Wouldn\u2019t you want to meet him, find out what he was really like? I\u2019d be kind of curious, myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t understand,\u201d Roger had said, rubbing a hand across his forehead in frustration. \u201cIt\u2019s not like someone who\u2019s adopted, finding out her real father\u2019s name and then just popping up on his doorstep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeems to me that\u2019s just what it\u2019s like.\u201d The deep voice was cool. \u201cBree was adopted, right? I think she\u2019d have gone before, if she hadn\u2019t felt it was disloyal to Frank.\u201d</p><p>Roger shook his head, disregarding the fact that Abernathy couldn\u2019t see him.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that\u2014it\u2019s the popping-up-on-the-doorstep part. That\u2014the way through\u2014how she went\u2014look, did Claire tell you\u2014?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, she did,\u201d Abernathy broke in. His tone was bemused. \u201cYeah, she did say it wasn\u2019t quite like walking through a revolving door.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo put it mildly.\u201d The mere thought of the standing stone circle on Craigh na Dun gave Roger a cold grue.</p><p>\u201cTo put it mildly\u2014you know what it\u2019s like?\u201d The far-off voice sharpened with interest.</p><p>\u201cYes, damn it, I do!\u201d He took a long, deep breath. \u201cSorry. Look, it\u2019s not\u2014I can\u2019t explain it, I don\u2019t think anyone could. Those stones...not everyone hears them, obviously. But Claire did. Bree does, and\u2014and I do. And for us...\u201d</p><p>Claire had gone through the stones of Craigh na Dun on the ancient fire feast of Samhain, on the first day of November, two and a half years before. Roger shivered, and not from cold. The hairs stood up on the back of his neck whenever he thought of it.</p><p>\u201cSo not everybody can go through\u2014but you can.\u201d Abernathy\u2019s voice was filled with curiosity\u2014and what sounded vaguely like envy.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Roger rubbed a hand through his hair. His eyes were burning, as though he\u2019d sat up all night. \u201cI might.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe thing is...\u201d He spoke slowly, trying to control his voice, and with it, his fear. \u201cThe thing is\u2014even if she has gone through, there\u2019s no way of telling whether, or where, she came out again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d The deep American voice had lost its jauntiness. \u201cAnd you don\u2019t know about Claire either, then. Whether she made it?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head, his vision of Joe Abernathy so clear that he forgot again that the man couldn\u2019t see him. Dr. Abernathy was no more than average size, a thickset black man in gold-rimmed spectacles, but with such an air of authority that his simple presence gave one confidence and compelled calm. Roger was surprised to find that this presence transferred itself over the phone lines\u2014but he was more than grateful for it. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said aloud. Leave it at that, for now. He wasn\u2019t about to go into everything now, on the phone with a near stranger. \u201cShe\u2019s a woman; there wasn\u2019t that much public notice of what individual women were doing, then\u2014not unless they did something spectacular, like get burned for witchcraft, or hanged for murder. Or be murdered.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHa ha,\u201d said Abernathy, but he wasn\u2019t laughing. \u201cShe did make it, though, at least once. She went\u2014and she came back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, she did.\u201d Roger had been trying to take comfort in that fact himself, but there were too many other possibilities forcing themselves upon his consciousness. \u201cBut we don\u2019t know that Brianna went back as far\u2014or farther. And even if she did survive the stones and come out in the right time...have you any idea how dangerous a place the eighteenth century was?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Abernathy said dryly. \u201cThough I gather you do. But Claire seemed to manage all right there.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShe survived,\u201d Roger agreed. \u201cNot much of a sell for a vacation spot, is it, though\u2014\u2018If your luck\u2019s in, you\u2019ll come back alive?\u2019 \u201d Once, at least.</p><p>Abernathy did laugh at that, though with a nervous undertone. He coughed then, and cleared his throat.</p><p>\u201cYeah. Well. The point is\u2014Bree\u2019s gone someplace. And I think you\u2019re probably right about where. I mean, if it was me, I\u2019d have gone. Wouldn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Wouldn\u2019t you? He pulled to the left, passed a lorry with its headlights on, plodding its way through the gathering fog.</p><p>I would. Abernathy\u2019s confident voice rang in his ear.</p> <p>INVERNESS, 30, read the sign, and he swung the tiny Morris abruptly to the right, skidding on wet pavement. The rain was drumming down on the tarmac, hard enough to raise a mist above the grass on the verge.</p><p>Wouldn\u2019t you? He touched the breast pocket of his shirt, where the squarish shape of Brianna\u2019s photo lay stiff over his heart. His fingers touched the small round hardness of his mother\u2019s locket, snatched at the last moment, brought along for luck.</p><p>\u201cYeah, maybe I would,\u201d he muttered, squinting through the rain streaming over the windscreen. \u201cBut I would have told you I was going to do it. In the name of God, woman\u2014why did you not tell me?\u201d</p><p>31</p><p>RETURN TO INVERNESS</p><p>The fumes of furniture polish, floor wax, fresh paint, and air freshener hung in throat-clutching clouds in the hallway. Not even these olfactory evidences of Fiona\u2019s domestic zeal were able to compete with the delectable aromas floating out of the kitchen, though.</p> <p>\u201cEat your heart out, Tom Wolfe,\u201d Roger murmured, inhaling deeply as he set down his bag in the hall. Granted, the old manse was definitely under new management, but even its transformation from manse to bed-and-breakfast had been unable to alter its basic character.</p><p>Welcomed with enthusiasm by Fiona\u2014and somewhat less by Ernie\u2014he settled into his old room at the top of the stairs, and embarked at once on his job of detection. It wasn\u2019t that difficult; beyond the normal Highland inquisitiveness about strangers, a six-feet-tall woman with waist-length red hair tended to attract notice.</p><p>She\u2019d come to Inverness from Edinburgh. He knew that much for a fact; she\u2019d been seen at the station. Also for a fact he knew that a tall red-haired woman had hired a car and told the driver to take her out into the country. The driver had no real notion where they had gone; just that all of a sudden, the woman had said, \u201cHere, this is the place, let me off here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSaid she meant to meet her friends for a walking tour across the moors,\u201d the driver had said, shrugging. \u201cShe had a haversack with her, and she was dressed for walking, sure enough. A damn wet day for a walk on the moors, but ye know what loons these American tourists are.\u201d</p><p>Well, he knew what kind of a loon that one was, at least. Curse her thick head and fiendish stubbornness, if she thought she had to do it, why in hell hadn\u2019t she told him? Because she didn\u2019t want you to know, sport, he thought grimly. And he didn\u2019t want to think about why not.</p><p>So far he had gotten. And only one way of following her any farther.</p><p>Claire had speculated that the whatever-it-was stood widest open on the ancient sun feasts and fire feasts. It seemed to work\u2014she had herself gone through the first time on Beltane, May 1, the second time on Samhain, the first of November. And now Brianna had evidently followed in her mother\u2019s footsteps, going on Beltane.</p><p>Well, he wasn\u2019t going to wait till November\u2014God only knew what could happen to her in five months! Beltane and Samhain were fire feasts, though; there was a sunfeast between.</p> <p>Midsummer\u2019s Eve, the summer solstice; that would be next. June 20, four weeks away. He ground his teeth at the thought of waiting\u2014his impulse was to go now and damn the danger\u2014but it wouldn\u2019t help Brianna if his impulse to rush chivalrously after her killed him. He was under no illusions about the nature of the stone circle, not after what he\u2019d seen and heard so far.</p><p>Very quietly, he began to make what preparations he could. And in the evenings, when the fog rolled in off the river, he sought distraction from his thoughts, playing draughts with Fiona, going to the pub with Ernie, and\u2014as a last resort\u2014having another bash at the dozens of boxes that still crammed the old garage.</p><p>The garage had an air of sinister miracle about it; the boxes seemed to multiply like the loaves and fishes\u2014every time he opened the door, there were more of them. He\u2019d probably finish the job of sorting his late father\u2019s effects just before being carried out feetfirst himself, he thought. Still, for the moment, the boring work was a godsend, dulling his mind enough to keep him from fretting himself to pieces in the waiting. Some nights, he even slept.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got a picture on your desk.\u201d Fiona didn\u2019t look at him, but kept her attention riveted on the dishes she was clearing.</p><p>\u201cLots of them.\u201d Roger took a cautious mouthful of tea; hot and fresh, but not scalding. How did she do that? \u201cIs there one you want? I know there are a few snaps of your grannie\u2014you\u2019re more than welcome, though I\u2019d like one to keep.\u201d</p><p>She did look up at that, mildly startled.</p><p>\u201cOh. Of Grannie? Aye, our Da\u2019ll like to see those. But it\u2019s the big one I meant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBig one?\u201d Roger tried to think which photo she could mean; most of them were black-and-white snapshots taken with the Reverend\u2019s ancient Brownie, but there were a couple of the larger cabinet photos\u2014one of his parents, another of the Reverend\u2019s grandmother, looking like a pterodactyl in black bombazine, taken on the occasion of that lady\u2019s hundredth birthday. Fiona couldn\u2019t possibly mean those.</p><p>\u201cOf her that kilt her husband and went away.\u201d Fiona\u2019s mouth compressed.</p><p>\u201cHer that\u2014oh.\u201d Roger took a deep gulp of tea. \u201cYou mean Gillian Edgars.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHer,\u201d Fiona repeated stubbornly. \u201cWhy\u2019ve you got a photo of her?\u201d</p><p>Roger set the cup down and picked up the morning paper, affecting casualness as he wondered what to say.</p><p>\u201cOh\u2014someone gave it to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d</p><p>Fiona was normally persistent, but seldom so direct. What was troubling her?</p><p>\u201cMrs. Randall\u2014Dr. Randall, I mean. Why?\u201d</p><p>Fiona didn\u2019t reply, but pressed her lips tight shut.</p><p>Roger had by now abandoned all interest in the paper. He laid it down carefully.</p><p>\u201cDid you know her?\u201d he said. \u201cGillian Edgars?\u201d</p><p>Fiona didn\u2019t answer directly, but turned aside, fiddling with the tea cozy.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been up to the standing stones on Craigh na Dun; Joycie said her Albert saw ye comin\u2019 down when he was drivin\u2019 to Drumnadrochit Thursday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have, yes. No crime in that, is there?\u201d He tried to make a joke of it, but Fiona wasn\u2019t having any.</p><p>\u201cYe know it\u2019s a queer place, all circles are. And don\u2019t be tellin\u2019 me ye went up there to admire the view.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t tell you that.\u201d</p><p>He sat back in his chair, looking up at her. Her curly dark hair was standing on end; she rumpled her hands through it when she was agitated, and agitated she surely was.</p><p>\u201cYou do know her. That\u2019s right; Claire said you\u2019d met her.\u201d The small flicker of curiosity he had felt at the mention of Gillian Edgars was growing into a clear flame of excitement.</p><p>\u201cI canna be knowing her, now, can I? She\u2019s dead.\u201d Fiona scooped up the empty egg cup, eyes fixed on the discarded fragments of shell. \u201cIsn\u2019t she?\u201d</p><p>Roger reached out and stopped her with a hand on her arm.</p><p>\u201cIs she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s what everyone thinks. The police havena found a trace of her.\u201d The word came out \u201cpolis\u201d in her soft Highland accent.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps they\u2019re not looking in the right place.\u201d</p><p>All the blood drained out of her flushed, fair face. Roger tightened his grip, though she wasn\u2019t trying to pull away. She knew, dammit, she knew! But what did she know?</p><p>\u201cTell me, Fiona,\u201d he said. \u201cPlease\u2014tell me. What do you know about Gillian Edgars\u2014and the stones?\u201d</p><p>She did pull away from him then, but didn\u2019t leave, just stood there, turning the egg cup over and over in her hands, as if it were a miniature hourglass. Roger stood up, and she shied back, glancing fearfully up at him.</p><p>\u201cA bargain, then,\u201d he said, trying to keep his voice calm, so as not to frighten her further. \u201cTell me what you know, and I\u2019ll tell you why Dr. Randall gave me that picture\u2014and why I was up on Craigh na Dun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got to think.\u201d Swiftly she bent and snatched up the tray of dirty crockery. She was out the door before he could speak a word to stop her.</p><p>Slowly he sat down again. It had been a good breakfast\u2014all Fiona\u2019s meals were delicious\u2014but it lay in his stomach like a bag of marbles, heavy and indigestible.</p><p>He shouldn\u2019t be so eager, he told himself. It was courting disappointment. What could Fiona know, after all? Still, any mention of the woman who had called herself Gillian\u2014and later Geillis\u2014was enough to rivet his attention.</p><p>He picked up his neglected teacup and swallowed, not tasting it. What if he kept the bargain, and told her everything? Not only about Claire Randall and Gillian, but about himself\u2014and Brianna.</p><p>The thought of Bree was like a rock dropped into the pool of his heart, sending ripples of fear in all directions. She\u2019s dead. Fiona had said of Gillian. Isn\u2019t she?</p><p>Is she? he had answered, the picture of a woman vivid in his mind, green eyes wide and fair hair flying in the hot wind of a fire, poised to flee through the doors of time. No, she hadn\u2019t died.</p><p>Not then, at least, because Claire had met her\u2014would meet her? Earlier? Later? She hadn\u2019t died, but was she dead? She must be now, mustn\u2019t she, and yet\u2014damn this twistiness! How could he even think about it coherently?</p><p>Too unsettled to stay in one place, he got up and walked down the hall. He paused in the doorway of the kitchen. Fiona was standing at the sink, staring out of the window. She heard him and turned around, an unused dishcloth clutched in her hand. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Her face was red, but determined.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not to tell, but I will, I\u2019ve got to.\u201d She took a deep breath and squared her chin, looking like a Pekingese facing up to a lion.</p><p>\u201cBree\u2019s Mam\u2014that nice Dr. Randall\u2014she asked me about my grannie. She kent Grannie\u2019d been a\u2014a\u2014dancer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDancer? What, you mean in the stones?\u201d Roger felt faintly startled. Claire had told him, when he\u2019d first met her, but he had never quite believed it\u2014not that the staid Mrs. Graham performed arcane ceremonies on green hilltops in the May dawn.</p> <p>Fiona let out a long breath.</p><p>\u201cSo ye do know. I thought so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t know. All I know is what Claire\u2014Dr. Randall\u2014told me. She and her husband saw women dancing in the stone circle one Beltane dawn, and your grannie was one of them.\u201d</p><p>Fiona shook her head.</p><p>\u201cNot just one o\u2019 them, no. Grannie was the caller.\u201d</p> <p>Roger moved into the kitchen and took the dishcloth from her unresisting hand.</p><p>\u201cCome and sit down,\u201d he said, leading her to the table. \u201cAnd tell me, what\u2019s a caller?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe one who calls down the sun.\u201d She sat, unresisting. She had made up her mind, he saw; she was going to tell him.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s one of the auld tongues, the sun-song; some of the words are a bit like the Gaelic, but not all of it. First we dance, in the circle, then the caller stops and faces the split stone, and\u2014it\u2019s no singing, really, but it\u2019s no quite talking, either; more like the minister at kirk. You\u2019ve to begin at just the right moment, when the light first shows over the sea, so just as ye finish, the sun comes through the stone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you remember any of the words?\u201d The scholar in Roger stirred briefly, curiosity rearing its head through his confusion.</p><p>Fiona didn\u2019t much resemble her grandmother, but she gave him a look that reminded him suddenly of Mrs. Graham in its directness.</p> <p>\u201cI know them all,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m the caller now.\u201d</p><p>He realized that his mouth was hanging open, and closed it. She reached for the biscuit tin and plunked it in front of him.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s no what ye need to know, though,\u201d she said matter-of-factly, \u201cand so I won\u2019t tell ye. You want to know about Mrs. Edgars.\u201d</p><p>Fiona had met Gillian Edgars, all right; Gillian had been one of the dancers, though quite a new one. Gillian had asked questions of the older women, eager to learn all she could. She\u2019d wanted to learn the sun-song, too, but that was secret; only the caller and her successor had that. Some of the older women would know some of it\u2014those who had heard the chant every year for a long time\u2014but not all of it, and not the secrets of when to begin and how to time the song to coincide with the rising of the sun.</p><p>Fiona paused, looking down at her folded hands.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s women; only women. The men havena got a part in it, and we do not tell them. Not ever.\u201d</p><p>He laid a hand over hers.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right to tell me, Fiona,\u201d he said, very softly. \u201cTell me the rest, please. I\u2019ve got to know.\u201d</p> <p>She drew a deep, quivering breath and pulled her hand out from under his. She looked directly at him. \u201cD\u2019ye know where she\u2019s gone? Brianna?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think so. She\u2019s gone where Gillian went, hasn\u2019t she?\u201d</p><p>Fiona didn\u2019t reply, but went on looking at him. The unreality of the situation swept over him all of a sudden. He couldn\u2019t be sitting here, in the comfortable, shabby kitchen he\u2019d known since boyhood, sipping tea from a mug with the Queen\u2019s face painted on the side, discussing sacred stones and time-flight with Fiona. Not Fiona, for God\u2019s sake, whose interests were confined to Ernie and the domestic economy of her kitchen!</p><p>Or so he\u2019d thought. He picked up the mug, drained it, and set it down with a soft thump.</p><p>\u201cI have to go after her, Fiona\u2014if I can. Can I?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head, clearly afraid.</p><p>\u201cI canna say. It\u2019s only women I know about; maybe it\u2019s only women who can.\u201d</p><p>Roger\u2019s hand clenched round the saltshaker. That\u2019s what he was afraid of\u2014or one of the things he was afraid of.</p><p>\u201cOnly one way to find out, isn\u2019t there?\u201d he said, outwardly casual. In the back of his mind, unbidden, a tall cleft stone rose up black, stark as a threat against a soft dawn sky.</p><p>\u201cI have her wee book,\u201d Fiona blurted.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2014whose? Gillian\u2019s? She wrote something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, she did. There\u2019s a place\u2014\u201d She darted a look at him, and licked her lips. \u201cWe keep our things there, ready beforehand. She\u2019d put the book there, and\u2014and\u2014I took it, after.\u201d After Gillian\u2019s husband had been found murdered in the circle, Roger thought she meant.</p><p>\u201cI kent the polis should maybe have it,\u201d Fiona went on, \u201cbut it\u2014well, I didna like to give it to them, and yet I was thinkin\u2019 what if it\u2019s to do with the killing? And I couldna keep it back if it was to be important, and yet\u2014\u201d She looked up at Roger in a plea for understanding. \u201cIt was her own book, ye see, her writing. And if she\u2019d left it in that place...\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was secret.\u201d Roger nodded.</p><p>Fiona nodded, and drew a deep breath.</p><p>\u201cSo I read it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd that\u2019s how you know where she\u2019s gone,\u201d Roger said softly.</p><p>Fiona let out a shuddering sigh and gave him a wan smile.</p><p>\u201cWell, the book\u2019s no going to help the polis, that\u2019s for sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCould it help me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope so,\u201d she said simply, and turning to the sideboard, pulled open a drawer and withdrew a small book, bound in green cloth.</p><p>32</p><p>GRIMOIRE</p><p>This is the grimoire of the witch, Geillis. It is a witch\u2019s name, and I take it for my own; what I was born does not matter, only what I will make of myself, only what I will become.</p><p>And what is that? I cannot yet say, for only in the making will I find what I have made. Mine is the path of power.</p><p>Absolute power corrupts absolutely, yes\u2014and how? Why, in the assumption that power can be absolute, for it never can. For we are mortal, you and I. Watch the flesh shrink and wither on your bones, feel the lines of your skull, pushing through the skin, your teeth behind soft lips a grin of grim acknowledgment.</p><p>And yet within the bounds of flesh, many things are possible. Whether such things are possible beyond those bounds\u2014that is the realm of others, not mine. And that is the difference between them and me, those others who have gone before to explore the Black Realm, those who seek power in magic and the summoning of demons.</p><p>I go in the body, not the soul. And by denying my soul, I give no power to any force but those I control. I do not seek favor from devil or god; I deny them. For if there is no soul, no death to contemplate, then neither god nor devil rules\u2014their battle is of no consequence, to one who lives in the flesh alone.</p><p>We rule for a moment, and yet for all time. A fragile web woven to snare both earth and space. Only one life is given to us\u2014and yet its years may be spent in many times\u2014how many times?</p><p>If you will wield power, you must choose both your time and your place, for only when the shadow of the stone falls at your feet is the door of destiny truly open.</p><p>\u201cA nutcase for sure,\u201d Roger murmured. \u201cHorrible prose style, too.\u201d The kitchen was empty; he was talking to reassure himself. It wasn\u2019t helping.</p><p>He turned the pages carefully, skimming down the lines of clear, round writing.</p><p>After the first bit, there was a section titled \u201cSun Feasts and Fire Feasts,\u201d with a listing after\u2014Imbolc, Alban Eilir, Beltane, Litha, Lughnassadh, Alban Elfed, Samhain, Alban Arthuan\u2014with a paragraph of notes following each name, and a series of small crosses inscribed alongside. What the hell was that for?</p><p>Samhain caught his eye, with six crosses by it.</p><p>This is the first of the feasts of the dead. Long before Christ and his Resurrection, on the night of Samhain, the souls of heroes rose from their graves. They are rare, these heroes. Who is born when the stars are right? Not all who are born to it have the courage to take hold of the power that is their right.</p><p>Even in what was plainly raving madness, she had method and organization\u2014a queer admixture of cool observation and poetic flight. The center section of the book was labeled \u201cCase Studies,\u201d and if the first section had raised the hair on Roger\u2019s neck, the second was enough to freeze the blood in his veins.</p><p>It was a careful listing, by date and by place, of bodies found in the vicinity of stone circles. The appearance of each was noted, and below each description were a few words of speculation.</p><p>August 14, 1931. Sur-le-Meine, Brittany. Body of a male, unidentified. Age, mid-40s. Found near north end of standing stone circle. No evident cause of death, but deep burns on arms and legs. Clothing described only as \u201crags.\u201d No photograph.</p><p>Possible cause of failure: (1) male, (2) wrong date\u201423 days from nearest sun feast.</p><p>April 2, 1650. Castlerigg, Scotland. Body of female, unidentified. Age, about 15. Found outside circle. Substantial mutilation noted, may have been dragged from circle by wolves. Clothing not described.</p><p>Possible cause of failure: (1) wrong date\u201428 days prior to fire feast. (2) lack of preparation.</p><p>February 5, 1953. Callanish, Isle of Lewis. Body of male identified as John MacLeod, lobsterman, age 26. Cause of death diagnosed as massive cerebral hemorrhage, coroner\u2019s inquest held owing to appearance of body\u2014second-degree burns on skin of face and extremities, and scorched look of clothing. Coroner\u2019s verdict, death by lightning\u2014possible, but not likely. Possible cause of failure: (1) male. (2) very close to Imbolc, but perhaps not close enough? (3) improper preparation\u2014N.B. newspaper photograph shows victim, shirt open; there is a burnt spot on the chest which appears to be in shape of Bridhe\u2019s Cross, but too indistinct to say for sure.</p><p>May 1, 1963. Tomnahurich, Scotland. Body of female, identified as Mary Walker Willis. Coroner\u2019s inquest, substantial scorching of body and clothing, death due to heart failure\u2014rupture of aorta. Inquest notes Miss Walker dressed in \u201codd\u201d clothing, details unspecified.</p><p>Failure\u2014this one knew what she was doing, but didn\u2019t make it. Failure likely due to omission of proper sacrifice.</p><p>The list went on chilling Roger more with each name. She had found twenty-two, altogether, reported over a period from the mid-1600s to the mid-1900s, from sites scattered over Scotland, northern England, and Brittany, all sites showing some evidence of prehistoric building. Some had been obvious accidents, he thought\u2014people who\u2019d walked into a circle all unsuspecting and had no notion what had hit them.</p><p>A few\u2014only two or three\u2014seemed to have known; they\u2019d made some preparation of clothing. Perhaps they had passed through before, and tried again\u2014but this time it hadn\u2019t worked. His stomach curled into a small, cold snail. Claire had been right; it wasn\u2019t like stepping through a revolving door.</p><p>Then there were the disappearances...these were in a separate section, neatly docketed by date, sex, and age, with as much noted of the circumstances as was recorded. Ah\u2014that was the meaning of the crosses; how many people had disappeared near each feast. There were more of the disappeared than of the dead, but there was of necessity less data. Most bore question marks\u2014Roger supposed because there was no telling whether disappearance in the vicinity of a circle was necessarily connected with it. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He turned over a page, and stopped, feeling as though he\u2019d been punched in the stomach.</p><p>May 1, 1945. Craigh na Dun, Inverness-shire, Scotland. Claire Randall, age 27, housewife. Seen last in early morning, having declared intention to visit the circle in search of unusual plant specimens, did not return by dark. Car found parked at foot of hill. No traces in circle, no signs of foul play.</p><p>He turned the page gingerly, as though expecting it to blow up in his hand. So Claire had inadvertently given Gillian Edgars part of the evidence that had led to her own experiment. Had Geilie found the reports of Claire\u2019s return, three years later?</p><p>No, evidently not, he concluded, after flipping back and forth through those pages\u2014or if she had, she hadn\u2019t recorded it here.</p> <p>Fiona had brought him more tea and a plate of fresh ginger nut biscuits, which had sat untouched since he had begun reading. A sense of obligation rather than hunger made him pick up a biscuit and take a bite, but the sharp-flavored crumbs caught in his throat and made him cough.</p><p>The last section of the book bore the heading \u201cTechniques and Preparations.\u201d It began,</p><p>Something lies here, older than man, and the stones keep its power. The old spells speak of \u201cthe lines of the earth,\u201d and the power that flows through them. The purpose of the stones is to do with those lines, I am sure. But do the stones warp the lines of power, or are they only markers?</p><p>The bite of biscuit seemed permanently stuck in his throat, no matter how much tea he drank. He found himself reading faster, skimming, skipping pages, and finally sat back and shut the book. He would read the rest later\u2014and more than once. But for now, he had to get out, into the fresh air. No wonder the book had upset Fiona.</p><p>He walked fast down the street, heading for the river, oblivious of the light rain falling. It was late; there was a churchbell ringing for evensong, and the evening foot traffic to the pubs was picking up across the bridges. But above bell and voice and footstep, he heard the last words he had read, chiming in his ear as though she had been speaking directly to him.</p> <p>Shall I kiss you, child, shall I kiss you, man? Feel the teeth behind my lips when I do. I could kill you, as easily as I embrace you. The taste of power is the taste of blood\u2014iron in my mouth, iron in my hand.</p><p>Sacrifice is required.</p><p>33</p><p>MIDSUMMER\u2019S EVE</p><p>June 20, 1971</p><p>On Midsummer\u2019s Eve in Scotland, the sun hangs in the sky with the moon. Summer solstice, the feast of Litha, Alban Eilir. Nearly midnight, and the light was dim and milky white, but light nonetheless.</p> <p>He could feel the stones long before he saw them. Claire and Geillis had both been right, he thought; the date mattered. They had been eerie on his earlier visits, but silent. Now he could hear them; not with his ears but with his skin\u2014a low buzzing hum like the drone of bagpipes.</p><p>They came over the crest of the hill and paused, thirty feet from the circle. Below was dark glen, a mystery under the rising moon. He heard a small intake of breath at his elbow, and it occurred to him that Fiona was seriously afraid.</p><p>\u201cLook, you don\u2019t need to be here,\u201d he told her. \u201cIf you\u2019re afraid, you should go on down; I\u2019ll be all right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not me I\u2019m scairt for, fool,\u201d she muttered, thrusting her balled fists deeper into her pockets. She turned away, lowering her head like a little bull as she faced up the path. \u201cCome on, then.\u201d</p><p>The alder bushes rustled near his shoulder and he shivered suddenly, feeling a cold qualm go over him, warmly as he was dressed. His dress seemed suddenly ridiculous; the long-skirted coat and the weskit in thick wool, the matching breeches and knitted stockings. A play at the college, he had told the tailor who made the costume.</p><p>\u201cFool is right,\u201d he muttered to himself.</p><p>Fiona went first into the circle; she would not let him come with her or watch. Obediently, he turned his back, letting her do whatever she intended. She had a plastic shopping bag, presumably containing items for her ceremonial. He had asked what was in it, and she had tersely told him to mind his own business. She was nearly as nervous as he was, he thought.</p><p>The humming noise disturbed him. It wasn\u2019t in his ears but in his body\u2014under his skin, in his bones. It made the long bones of his arms and legs thrum like plucked strings, and itched in his blood, making him want constantly to scratch. Fiona couldn\u2019t hear it; he\u2019d asked, to be sure she was safe before letting her help him.</p> <p>He hoped to God he was right; that only those who heard the stones could pass through them. He\u2019d never forgive himself if anything happened to Fiona\u2014though as she\u2019d pointed out, she\u2019d been in this circle any number of times on the fire feasts, with no ill effect. He sneaked a look over one shoulder, saw a tiny flame burning at the base of the big cleft stone, and jerked his head back around.</p><p>She was singing, in a soft, high voice. He couldn\u2019t make out the words. All the other travelers he knew of were women; would it truly work for him?</p><p>It might, he thought. If the ability to pass through the stones was genetic\u2014something like the ability to roll one\u2019s tongue into a cylinder or color-blindness\u2014then why not? Claire had traveled, so had Brianna. Brianna was Claire\u2019s daughter. And he was a descendant of the only other time-traveler he knew of\u2014Geillis the witch.</p><p>He stamped both feet and shook himself like a horse with flies, trying to rid himself of the humming. God, it was like being eaten by ants! Was Fiona\u2019s chanting making it worse, or was it only his imagination?</p><p>He rubbed violently at his chest, trying to ease the irritation, and felt the small round weight of his mother\u2019s locket, taken for luck and for its garnets. He had his doubts about Geillis\u2019s speculations\u2014he wasn\u2019t about to try blood, though Fiona seemed to be supplying fire\u2014but after all, the gems could do no harm, and if they helped...Christ, would Fiona not hurry? He twisted and strained inside his clothes, trying to get out of not only his clothing but his skin.</p><p>Seeking distraction, he patted his breast pocket again, feeling the locket. If it worked...if he could...it was a notion that had come to him only lately, as the possibility posed by the stones had matured into actual planning. But if it were possible...he fingered the small, round shape, seeing the face of Jerry MacKenzie on the dark surface of his mind.</p><p>Brianna had gone to find her father. Could he do the same? Jesus, Fiona! She was making it worse; the roots of his teeth ached, and his skin was burning. He shook his head violently, then stopped, feeling dizzy; the seams of his skull felt as though they were beginning to separate.</p><p>Then she was there, a small figure grasping his hand, saying something anxious as she led him into the circle. He couldn\u2019t hear her\u2014the noise was much worse inside; now it was in his ears, in his head, blackening his sight, driving wedges of pain between the joints of his spine.</p><p>Gritting his teeth, he blinked back the buzzing darkness, long enough to fix his eyes on Fiona\u2019s round and fearful face.</p><p>Swiftly he bent and kissed her, full on the mouth.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t tell Ernie,\u201d he said. He turned away from her and walked through the stone.</p><p>A faint scent came to him on the summer wind; the smell of burning. He turned his head, nostrils flared to catch it. There. A flame flared and bloomed on a nearby hilltop, a rose of Midsummer\u2019s fire.</p><p>There were faint stars overhead, half shadowed by a drifting cloud. He had no urge to move, nor to think. He felt bodiless, embraced by the sky, his mind turning free, reflecting starlit images like the glass bubble of a fisher\u2019s float, adrift in the surf. There was a soft and musical hum around him\u2014the far-off song of siren stars, and the smell of coffee.</p><p>A vague feeling of wrongness intruded on his sense of peace. Sensation prodded at his mind, rousing tiny, painful sparks of confusion. He fought back feeling, wanting only to stay afloat in starlight, but the act of resistance woke him. All of a sudden, he had a body again, and it hurt.</p><p>\u201cROGER!\u201d The star\u2019s voice blared in his ear, and he jerked. Searing pain shot through his chest, and he clapped a hand to the wound. Something seized his wrist and pulled it away, but not before he had felt wetness, and the silky roughness of ash on his breast. Was he bleeding?</p><p>\u201cOh, ye\u2019re wakin\u2019, thank God! Aye, there, that\u2019s a good lad. Easy, aye?\u201d It was the cloud talking, not the star. He blinked, confused, and the cloud resolved itself into the curly silhouette of Fiona\u2019s head, dark against the sky. He jerked upright, more a convulsion than a conscious movement.</p><p>His body had come back with a vengeance. He felt desperately ill, and there was a horrible smell of coffee and burnt flesh in his nostrils. He rolled onto all fours, retching, then collapsed onto the grass. It was wet, and the coolness felt good on his scorched face.</p><p>Fiona\u2019s hands were on him, soothing, wiping his face and mouth.</p><p>\u201cAre ye all right?\u201d she said, for what he knew must be the hundredth time. This time, he summoned enough strength to answer.</p><p>\u201cAye,\u201d he whispered. \u201cAll right. Why\u2014?\u201d</p><p>Her head moved back and forth, wiping out half a sky of stars.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. Ye went\u2014ye were gone\u2014and then there was a burst o\u2019 fire, and ye were lyin\u2019 in the circle, wi\u2019 your coat ablaze. I had to put ye out with the thermos bottle.\u201d</p><p>That accounted for the coffee, then, and the soggy feeling over his chest. He lifted a hand, groping, and this time she let him. There was a burnt patch on the wet cloth of his coat, maybe three inches across. The flesh of his chest was seared; he could feel the queer cushioned numbness of blisters through the hole in the cloth, and the nagging pain of a burn spread through his breast. His mother\u2019s locket was gone entirely.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened, Rog?\u201d Fiona was crouching by him, her face dim but visible; he could see the shiny tracks of tears on her face. What he had thought a Midsummer\u2019s Eve fire was the flame of her candle, burned down now to the last half inch. God, how long had he been out?</p><p>\u201cI\u2014\u201d He had begun to say that he didn\u2019t know, but broke off. \u201cLet me think a bit, aye?\u201d He put his head on his knees, breathing in the smell of wet grass and scorched cloth.</p><p>He concentrated on breathing, let it come back. He had no real need to think\u2014it was all there, distinct in his mind. But how did one describe such things? There was no sight\u2014and yet he had the image of his father. No sound, no touch\u2014and yet he had both heard and felt. The body seemed to make its own sense of things, translating the numinous phenomena of time into concretions.</p><p>He raised his head from his knees, and breathed deep, settling himself slowly back in his body.</p><p>\u201cI was thinking of my father,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen I stepped through the rock, I had just thought, if it works, could I go back and find him? And I...did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did? Your dad? Was he a ghost, d\u2019ye mean?\u201d He felt, more than saw, the flicker of her hand as she made the horns against evil.</p><p>\u201cNo. Not exactly. I\u2014I can\u2019t explain, Fiona. But I met him; I knew him.\u201d The feeling of peace had not left him altogether; it hovered there, fluttering gently in the back of his mind. \u201cThen there was\u2014sort of an explosion, is all I can describe it as. Something hit me, here.\u201d His fingers touched the burnt place on his chest. \u201cThe force of it pushed me...out, and that\u2019s all I knew till I woke.\u201d He touched her face gently. \u201cThanks, Fee; you saved me burning.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOch, get on wi\u2019 ye.\u201d She made an impatient gesture, dismissing him. She sat back on her heels, rubbing her chin as she thought.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m thinking, Rog\u2014what it said in her book, about there maybe being some protection, if ye had a gemstone with ye. There were the wee jewels in your Mam\u2019s locket, no?\u201d He could hear her swallow. \u201cMaybe\u2014if ye hadn\u2019t had that\u2014ye might not have lived. She told about the folk who didn\u2019t. They were burned\u2014and your burn\u2019s where the locket was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. It could be.\u201d Roger was beginning to feel more like himself. He glanced curiously at Fiona.</p><p>\u201cYou always say \u2018her.\u2019 Why do you never say her name?\u201d</p> <p>Fiona\u2019s curls lifted in the dawn wind as she turned to look at him. It was light enough now to see her face clearly, with its expression of disconcerting directness.</p><p>\u201cYe dinna call something unless ye want it to come,\u201d she said. \u201cSurely ye know that, and your father a minister?\u201d</p><p>The hairs on his forearms prickled, despite the covering of shirt and coat.</p><p>\u201cNow that you mention it,\u201d he said, trying for a joking tone, and failing utterly. \u201cI wasn\u2019t quite calling my father\u2019s name, but perhaps...Dr. Randall said she thought of her husband, when she came back.\u201d</p><p>Fiona nodded, frowning. He could see her face clearly, and realized with a start that the light was growing. It was near dawn; the sky to the east was the shimmered color of a salmon\u2019s scales.</p> <p>\u201cChrist, it\u2019s almost morning! I\u2019ve got to go!\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo?\u201d Fiona\u2019s eyes went round with horror. \u201cYou\u2019re no going to try it again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am. I\u2019ve got to.\u201d The lining of his mouth was cotton-dry, and he regretted that Fiona had used all the coffee extinguishing him. He fought down the hollow-bellied feeling and made it to his feet. His knees were wobbly, but he could walk.</p><p>\u201cAre you mad, Rog? It\u2019ll kill ye, sure!\u201d</p><p>He shook his head, eyes fixed on the tall cleft stone.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said, and hoped to hell he was right. \u201cNo, I know what went wrong. It won\u2019t happen again.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou can\u2019t know, not for sure!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, I do.\u201d He took her hand from his sleeve and held it between his own; it was small and cold. He smiled at her, though his face felt strangely numb. \u201cI hope Ernie\u2019s not come home; he\u2019ll have the police looking for you. You\u2019d best hurry back.\u201d</p><p>She shrugged, impatient.</p><p>\u201cOch, he\u2019s at the fishin\u2019 with his cousin Neil; he\u2019ll no be back till Tuesday. What d\u2019ye mean, it won\u2019t happen again\u2014why won\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>This was the thing that was harder to explain than the rest of it. He owed it to her to try, though.</p><p>\u201cWhen I said I was thinking of my father, I was thinking of him from what I knew of him\u2014the pictures of him in his airman\u2019s kit, or with my mother. The thing is...I was born by that time. Do you see?\u201d He searched her small, round face, and saw her blink slowly, comprehending. Her breath left her in a small sigh, of fear and wonder mingled.</p><p>\u201cYe didna only meet your Da, then, did ye?\u201d she asked quietly.</p><p>He shook his head, wordless. No sight, no sound or smell or touch. There were no images at all to convey what it had been like to meet himself.</p> <p>\u201cI have to go,\u201d he repeated softly. He squeezed her hand. \u201cFiona, I cannot say enough to thank you.\u201d</p><p>She stared at him for a moment, her soft bottom lip thrust out, eyes glistening. Then she pulled loose, and twisting off her engagement ring, put it into his hand.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a wee stone, but it\u2019s a real diamond,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019ll maybe help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t take this!\u201d He reached to give it back, but she took a step backward, and put her hands behind her back.</p><p>\u201cDinna worry, it\u2019s insured,\u201d she said. \u201cErnie\u2019s a great one for the insurance.\u201d She tried to smile at him, though the tears were running down her face now. \u201cSo am I.\u201d</p><p>There was nothing more to say. He put the ring in the side pocket of his coat, and glanced at the great cleft stone, its black sides starting to glimmer as bits of mica and threads of quartz picked up the dawning light. He could hear the hum, still, though now it felt more like the pulsing of his blood; something inside him.</p><p>No words, and no need. He touched her face once lightly in farewell, and walked toward the stone, staggering slightly. He stepped into the cleft.</p><p>Fiona heard nothing, but the still, clear air of Midsummer\u2019s Day shimmered with an echoed name.</p><p>She waited for a long time, until the sun rested on top of the stone.</p><p>\u201cSlan leat, a charaid ch\u00f2ir,\u201d she said, softly. \u201cLuck to you, dear friend.\u201d She went slowly down the hill, and didn\u2019t look back.</p><p>34</p><p>LALLYBROCH</p><p>Scotland, June 1769</p><p>The sorrel horse\u2019s name was Brutus, but luckily it didn\u2019t seem indicative of character so far. More plodder than plotter, he was strong and faithful\u2014or if not faithful, at least resigned. He had carried her through the summer-green glens and rock-lined gorges without a slip, taking her higher and higher along the good roads made by the English general Wade fifty years before, and the bad roads beyond the General\u2019s reach, splashing through brushy burns and climbing up to the places where the roads dwindled away to nothing more than a red deer\u2019s track across the moor.</p><p>Brianna let the reins lie on Brutus\u2019s neck, letting him rest after the last climb, and sat still, surveying the small valley below. The big white-harled farmhouse sat serenely in the middle of pale green fields of oats and barley, its windows and chimneys edged in gray stone, the walled kailyard and the numerous outbuildings clustering around it like chicks round a big white hen.</p><p>She had never seen it before, but she was sure. She had heard her mother\u2019s descriptions of Lallybroch often enough. And besides, it was the only substantial house for miles; she had seen nothing else in the last three days but the tiny stone-walled crofters\u2019 cottages, many deserted and tumbled down, some no more than fire-black ruins.</p><p>Smoke was rising from a chimney below; someone was home. It was nearly midday; perhaps everyone was inside, eating dinner.</p><p>She swallowed, dry-mouthed with excitement and apprehension. Who would it be? Whom would she see first? Ian? Jenny? And how would they take her appearance, and her declaration?</p><p>She had decided simply to tell the truth, as far as who she was, and what she was doing there. Her mother had said how much she looked like her father; she would have to count on that resemblance to convince them. The Highlanders she had met so far were wary of her looks and strange speech; perhaps the Murrays wouldn\u2019t believe her. Then she remembered and touched the pocket of her coat; no, they\u2019d believe her; she had proof, after all.</p><p>A sudden thought hollowed her breastbone. Could they possibly be here now? Jamie Fraser and her mother? The thought hadn\u2019t occurred to her before. She had been so convinced that they were in America\u2014but that wasn\u2019t necessarily so. She only knew they would be in America in 1776; there was no telling where they were right now.</p><p>Brutus flung up his head and whinnied loudly. An answering neigh came from behind them, and Brianna drew up the reins as Brutus swung around. He lifted his head and nickered, nostrils flaring with interest as a handsome bay horse came round the bend of the road, carrying a tall man in brown.</p><p>The man pulled up his horse for a moment when he saw them, then twitched a heel against the bay\u2019s side and came on, slowly. He was young, she saw, and deeply tanned despite his hat; he must spend a good deal of time outdoors. The skirt of his coat was rumpled and his stockings were covered with dust and foxtails.</p><p>He came up to her warily, nodding as he came within speaking distance. Then she saw him stiffen in surprise, and smiled to herself.</p><p>He had just noticed that she was a woman. The men\u2019s clothes she wore would fool no one up close; \u201cboyish\u201d was the last word one would use to describe her figure. They served their purpose well enough, though\u2014they were comfortable for riding and, given her height, made her look like a man on horseback at a distance.</p><p>The man swept off his hat and bowed to her, surprise plain on his face. He wasn\u2019t strictly good-looking, but had a pleasant, strong sort of face, with feathery brows\u2014presently raised high\u2014and soft brown eyes under a thick cap of curly hair, black and glossy with good health.</p><p>\u201cMadame,\u201d he said. \u201cMight I assist ye?\u201d</p><p>She took off her own hat and smiled at him.</p><p>\u201cI hope so,\u201d she said. \u201cIs this place Lallybroch?\u201d</p><p>He nodded, wariness now added to his surprise as he heard her odd accent.</p><p>\u201cIt is, so. Will ye be having some business here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said firmly. \u201cI will.\u201d She drew herself up straight in the saddle and took a deep breath. \u201cI\u2019m Brianna...Fraser.\u201d It felt odd to say it aloud; she had never used the name before. It seemed strangely right, though.</p><p>The wariness on his face diminished, but the puzzlement didn\u2019t. He nodded cautiously.</p><p>\u201cYour servant, ma\u2019am. Jamie Fraser Murray,\u201d he added formally, bowing, \u201cof Broch Tuarach.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYoung Jamie!\u201d she exclaimed, startling him with her eagerness. \u201cYou\u2019re Young Jamie!\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy family calls me so,\u201d he said stiffly, managing to give her the impression that he objected to having the name used wantonly by strange women in unsuitable clothes.</p><p>\u201cPleased to meet you,\u201d she said, undaunted. She extended a hand to him, leaning from her saddle. \u201cI\u2019m your cousin.\u201d</p><p>The brows, which had come down during the introductions, popped back up. He looked at her extended hand, then, incredulously, at her face.</p><p>\u201cJamie Fraser is my father,\u201d she said.</p><p>His jaw dropped, and he simply goggled at her for a moment. He looked her over minutely, head to toe, peered closely at her face, and then a wide, slow smile spread across his own.</p><p>\u201cDamned if he isn\u2019t!\u201d he said. He seized her hand and squeezed it tight enough to grind the bones together. \u201cChrist, you\u2019ve the look of him!\u201d</p><p>He laughed, humor transforming his face.</p><p>\u201cJesus!\u201d he said. \u201cMy mother will have kittens!\u201d</p><p>The great rose brier that overhung the door was newly in leaf, hundreds of tiny green buds just forming. Brianna looked up at it as she followed Young Jamie, and caught sight of the lintel over the door.</p><p>Fraser, 1716 was carved into the weathered wood. She felt a small thrill at the sight, and stood staring up at the name for a moment, the sunwarm wood of the jamb solid under her hand.</p><p>\u201cAll right, Cousin?\u201d Young Jamie had turned to look back at her inquiringly.</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d She hurried into the house after him, automatically ducking her head, though there was no need.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re mostly tall, save my Mam and wee Kitty,\u201d Young Jamie said with a smile, seeing her duck. \u201cMy grandsire\u2014your grandsire, too\u2014built this house for his wife, who was a verra tall woman herself. It\u2019s the only house in the Highlands where ye can go through a doorway without ducking or bashing your head, I expect.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>...Your grandsire, too. The casual words made her feel suddenly warm, in spite of the cool dimness of the entry hall.</p><p>Frank Randall had been an only child, as had her mother; such relatives as she had were not close\u2014only a couple of elderly great-aunts in England, and some long-distant second cousins in Australia. She had set out thinking only to find her father; she hadn\u2019t realized that she might discover a whole new family in the process.</p><p>A lot of family. As she entered the hallway, with its scarred paneling, a door opened and four small children ran out, closely pursued by a tall young woman with brown curly hair.</p><p>\u201cAh, run for it, run for it, wee fishies!\u201d she cried, rushing forward with outstretched hands snapping like pincers. \u201cThe wicked crab will have ye eaten up, snap, snap!\u201d</p> <p>The children fled down the hall in a gale of giggles and shrieks, looking back over their shoulders in terrified delight. One of them, a little boy of four or so, saw Brianna and Young Jamie standing in the entry and instantly reversed his direction, charging down the hallway like a runaway locomotive, shouting, \u201cDaddy, Daddy, Daddy!\u201d</p><p>The boy flung himself recklessly at Young Jamie\u2019s midriff. The latter caught him expertly, and hoisted the beaming little boy in his arms.</p><p>\u201cNow, then, wee Matthew,\u201d he said sternly. \u201cWhat sort of manners is this your auntie Janet\u2019s teachin\u2019 you? What will your new cousin be thinkin\u2019, to see ye dashin\u2019 about wi\u2019 no more sense than a chicken after corn?\u201d</p><p>The little boy giggled louder, not at all put off by the scolding. He peeked at Brianna, caught her eye, and promptly buried his face in his father\u2019s shoulder. Slowly he raised his head and peeked again, blue eyes wide.</p><p>\u201cDa!\u201d he said. \u201cIs that a lady?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOf course she is, I\u2019ve told ye, she\u2019s your cousin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut she\u2019s got on breeks!\u201d Matthew stared at her in shock. \u201cLadies dinna wear breeks!\u201d</p><p>The young woman looked rather as though she subscribed to this opinion as well, but she interrupted firmly, moving to take the little boy from his father.</p><p>\u201cWell, and I\u2019m sure she\u2019s a fine reason for it, but it isna proper to be makin\u2019 remarks before people\u2019s faces. You go and get yourself washed, aye?\u201d She set him down and turned him toward the door at the end of the hallway, giving him a gentle push. He didn\u2019t move, but turned back around to stare at Brianna.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Grannie, Matt?\u201d his father asked.</p><p>\u201cIn the back parlor wi\u2019 Grandda and a lady and a man,\u201d Matthew replied promptly. \u201cThey\u2019ve had two pots of coffee, a tray of scones, and a whole Dundee cake, but Mama says they\u2019re hangin\u2019 on in hopes of bein\u2019 fed dinner, too, and good luck to them because it\u2019s only brose and a bit o\u2019 hough today, and damned\u2014oop!\u201d\u2014he pressed a hand over his mouth, glancing guiltily at his father\u2014\u201cand drat if she\u2019ll gie them any of the gooseberry tart, no matter how long they stay.\u201d</p> <p>Young Jamie gave his son a narrow look, then glanced quizzically at his sister. \u201cA lady and a man?\u201d</p><p>Janet made a faint moue of distaste.</p><p>\u201cThe Grizzler and her brother,\u201d she said.</p><p>Young Jamie grunted, with a glance at Brianna.</p><p>\u201cI imagine Mam will be pleased for an excuse to get away from them, then.\u201d He nodded at Matthew. \u201cGo and fetch your Grannie, lad. Tell her I\u2019ve brought a visitor she\u2019ll like to see. And watch your language, aye?\u201d He turned Matthew toward the back of the house and slapped him gently on the rump in dismissal.</p><p>The little boy went, but slowly, casting glances of intense fascination over his shoulder at Brianna as he went.</p><p>Young Jamie turned back to Brianna, smiling.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019ll be my eldest,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd this\u201d\u2014gesturing to the young woman, \u201cis my sister, Janet Murray. Janet\u2014Mistress Brianna Fraser.\u201d</p> <p>Brianna didn\u2019t know whether to offer to shake hands or not, and instead contented herself with a nod and a smile. \u201cI\u2019m very pleased to meet you,\u201d she said warmly.</p><p>Janet\u2019s eyes sprang wide with amazement, whether at what Brianna had said or at the accent with which she\u2019d spoken, Brianna couldn\u2019t tell.</p><p>Young Jamie grinned at his sister\u2019s surprise.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll never guess who she is, Jen,\u201d he said. \u201cNever in a thousand years!\u201d</p><p>Janet lifted one eyebrow, then narrowed her eyes at Brianna.</p><p>\u201cCousin,\u201d she murmured, looking their guest frankly up and down. \u201cShe\u2019s the look o\u2019 the MacKenzies, surely. But she\u2019s a Fraser, ye say...\u201d Her eyes sprang suddenly wide.</p><p>\u201cOh, ye can\u2019t be,\u201d she said to Brianna. A wide smile began to spread across her face, pointing up the family resemblance to her brother. \u201cYou can\u2019t be!\u201d</p><p>Her brother\u2019s chortle was interrupted by the swish of a swinging door and the sound of light footsteps on the boards of the hallway.</p><p>\u201cAye, Jamie? Mattie says we\u2019ve a guest\u2014\u201d The soft, brisk voice died suddenly, and Brianna looked up, her heart suddenly in her throat.</p><p>Jenny Murray was very small\u2014no more than five feet tall\u2014and delicately boned as a sparrow. She stood staring at Brianna, mouth slightly open. Her eyes were the deep blue of gentians, made the more striking by a face gone white as paper.</p><p>\u201cOh, my,\u201d she said softly. \u201cOh, my.\u201d Brianna smiled tentatively, nodding to her aunt\u2014her mother\u2019s friend, her father\u2019s beloved only sister. Oh, please! she thought, suddenly suffused with a longing as intense as it was unexpected. Please like me, please be happy I\u2019m here!</p><p>Young Jamie bowed elaborately to his mother, beaming.</p><p>\u201cMam, might I have the honor to present to ye\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cJamie Fraser! I kent he was back\u2014I told ye, Jenny Murray!\u201d</p><p>The voice rang out from the back of the hallway in tones of highpitched accusation. Glancing up in startlement, Brianna saw a woman emerging from the shadows, rustling with indignation.</p><p>\u201cAmyas Kettrick told me he\u2019d seen your brother riding near Balriggan! But no, ye wouldna have it, would ye, Jenny\u2014telling me I\u2019m a fool, telling me Amyas is blind, and Jamie in America! Liars the both of ye, you and Ian, trying to protect that wicked coward! Hobart!\u201d she shouted, turning toward the back of the house, \u201cHobart! Come out here this minute!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe quiet!\u201d said Jenny impatiently. \u201cYe are a fool, Laoghaire!\u201d She jerked at the woman\u2019s sleeve, urging her around. \u201cAnd as for who\u2019s blind, look at her! Are ye too far past it to tell the difference between a grown man and a lass in breeks, for heaven\u2019s sake?\u201d Her own eyes stayed fixed on Brianna, bright with speculation.</p><p>\u201cA lass?\u201d</p><p>The other woman turned, frowning nearsightedly at Brianna. Then she blinked once, anger erased as her round face went slack with surprise. She gasped, crossing herself.</p><p>\u201cMary, Margaret and Bride! Who in the name of God are you?\u201d</p><p>Brianna took a deep breath, looking from one woman to the other as she answered, trying to keep her voice from shaking.</p><p>\u201cMy name is Brianna. I\u2019m Jamie Fraser\u2019s daughter.\u201d</p><p>Both women\u2019s eyes popped wide. The woman called Laoghaire grew slowly red and seemed to swell, opening and closing her mouth in a futile search for words.</p><p>Jenny stepped forward, though, and seized Brianna\u2019s hands, looking up into her face. A soft pink bloomed in her cheeks, making her look suddenly young.</p><p>\u201cJamie\u2019s? You\u2019re truly Jamie\u2019s lassie?\u201d She squeezed Brianna\u2019s hands hard between her own.</p><p>\u201cMy mother says so.\u201d</p><p>Brianna felt the answering smile on her own face. Jenny\u2019s hands were cool, but Brianna felt a rush of warmth nonetheless, which spread through her hands and up into her chest. She caught the faint, spicy scent of baking in the folds of Jenny\u2019s gown, and something else, more earthy and pungent, that she thought must be the smell of sheep\u2019s wool.</p><p>\u201cDoes she, so?\u201d Laoghaire had recovered both her voice and her self-possession. She stepped forward, eyes narrowed. \u201cJamie Fraser\u2019s your father, aye? And just who might your mother be?\u201d</p><p>Brianna stiffened.</p><p>\u201cHis wife,\u201d she said. \u201cWho else?\u201d</p><p>Laoghaire put back her head and laughed. It wasn\u2019t a nice laugh.</p><p>\u201cWho else?\u201d she said, mimicking. \u201cWho else indeed, lassie! And just which wife would that be, now?\u201d</p><p>Brianna felt the blood drain from her own face, and her hands grow stiff in Jenny\u2019s as the flood of realization washed over her. You idiot, she thought. You stupid idiot. It was twenty years! Of course he would have married again. Of course. No matter how much he loved Mama.</p><p>On the heels of this thought was another, more terrible. Did she find him? Oh, God, did she find him with a new wife, and he sent her away? Oh, God, where is she?</p><p>She turned blindly, wanting to run, not knowing where to go, what to do, only feeling that she must get out of here at once, and find her mother.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be wanting to sit down, I expect, Cousin. Come into the parlor, aye?\u201d Young Jamie\u2019s voice was firm in her ear, and his arm was around her, turning her, urging her down the hall and through one of the doors that opened off it.</p><p>She scarcely heard the babble of voices around her, the confusion of explanations and accusations that popped around her ears like strings of firecrackers. She glimpsed a small, neat man with a face like the White Rabbit, looking vastly surprised, and another man, much taller, who rose as she came into the parlor and came toward her, his weathered, homely face creased in concern.</p><p>It was the tall man who calmed the racket and brought everyone to order, extracting from the confused muddle of voices an explanation of her presence.</p><p>\u201cJamie\u2019s daughter?\u201d He glanced at her with interest, but looked much less surprised than anyone else so far. \u201cWhat\u2019s your name, a leannan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrianna.\u201d She was too upset to smile at him, but he didn\u2019t seem to mind.</p><p>\u201cBrianna.\u201d He eased himself down on a hassock, motioning her to a seat opposite, and she saw that he had a wooden leg that protruded stiffly to one side. He took her hand and smiled at her, the warm light in his soft brown eyes making her feel momentarily safer.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m your uncle Ian, lass. Welcome to ye.\u201d Her own hand tightened on his involuntarily, clinging to the refuge he seemed to offer. He didn\u2019t flinch or draw back, just looked her over carefully, seeming amused by the way she was dressed.</p><p>\u201cBeen sleeping in the heather, have ye?\u201d he said, seeing the dirt and plant stains on her clothes. \u201cYou\u2019ll have come some way to find us, niece.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe says she\u2019s your niece,\u201d Laoghaire said. Recovered from her shock, she peered over Ian\u2019s shoulder, her round face pinched with dislike. \u201cBelike she\u2019s only come to see what she can get.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI shouldna be callin\u2019 the kettle black, Laoghaire,\u201d Ian said mildly. He twisted round to face her. \u201cOr was it not you and Hobart a half-hour past, tryin\u2019 to squeeze five hundred pounds from me?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Her lips pressed tight together, deepening the lines that bracketed her mouth.</p><p>\u201cThat money\u2019s mine,\u201d she snapped, \u201cand well ye know it! It was agreed to; you witnessed the paper.\u201d</p><p>Ian sighed; evidently this wasn\u2019t the first he had heard of the matter today.</p><p>\u201cI did,\u201d he said patiently. \u201cAnd ye\u2019ll have your money\u2014so soon as Jamie\u2019s able to send it. He\u2019s promised, and he\u2019s an honorable man. But\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHonorable, is it?\u201d Laoghaire produced an unladylike snort. \u201cIs it honorable to commit bigamy, then? Desert his wife and children? Steal away my daughter and ruin her? Honorable!\u201d She looked at Brianna, eyes bright and hard as fresh-rolled steel.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll ask again, lass\u2014what\u2019s your mother\u2019s name?\u201d</p><p>Brianna simply stared at her, overwhelmed. The stock around her throat was choking her, and her hands felt icy, despite Ian\u2019s grasp.</p><p>\u201cYour mother,\u201d Laoghaire repeated, impatient. \u201cWho was she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesna matter who\u2014\u201d Jenny began, but Laoghaire rounded on her, face flushed with fury.</p> <p>\u201cOh, it matters! If he got her on some army whore, or some slut of a maidservant when he was in England\u2014that\u2019s one thing. But if she\u2019s\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cLaoghaire!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSister!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYe foul-tongued besom!\u201d</p><p>Brianna put a stop to the outcry simply by standing up. She was as tall as any of the men, and towered over the women. Laoghaire took one quick step back. Every face in the room was turned to her, marked with hostility, sympathy, or merely curiosity.</p><p>With a coolness that she didn\u2019t feel, Brianna reached for the inner pocket of her coat, the secret pocket she had sewed into the seam only a week before. It seemed like a century.</p> <p>\u201cMy mother\u2019s name is Claire,\u201d she said, and dropped the necklace on the table.</p><p>There was utter silence in the room, save for the soft hissing of the peat fire, burning low on the hearth. The pearl necklace lay gleaming, the spring sun from the window picking out the gold pierced-work roundels like sparks.</p><p>It was Jenny who spoke first. Moving like a sleepwalker, she reached out a slender finger and touched one of the pearls. Freshwater pearls, the kind called baroque because of their singular, irregular, unmistakable shapes.</p><p>\u201cOh, my,\u201d Jenny said softly. She lifted her head and looked Brianna in the face, the slanted blue eyes shimmering with what looked like tears. \u201cI am so very glad to see ye\u2014Niece.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere is my mother? Do you know?\u201d Brianna glanced from face to face, her heart beating heavily in her ears. Laoghaire was not looking at her; her gaze was fastened to the pearls, face gone cold and frozen.</p><p>Jenny and Ian exchanged a quick glance, then Ian stood up, moving awkwardly to bring his leg under him.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s with your Da,\u201d he said quietly, touching Brianna\u2019s arm. \u201cDinna fash yourself, lassie; they\u2019re both safe.\u201d</p><p>Brianna resisted the impulse to collapse with relief. Instead, she let out her breath very carefully, feeling the knot of anxiety loosen slowly in her belly.</p> <p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she said. She tried to smile at Ian, but her face felt slack and rubbery. Safe. And together. Oh, thank you! she thought, in wordless gratitude.</p><p>\u201cThose are mine, by rights.\u201d Laoghaire nodded at the pearls. She wasn\u2019t angry now, but coldly self-possessed. Without the distortions of fury, Brianna could see that she had once been very pretty, and was still a handsome woman\u2014tall for a Scot, and graceful in her movements. She had the kind of delicate fair coloring that fades quickly, and had thickened through the middle, but her figure was still erect and firm, and her face still showed the pride of a woman who has known herself beautiful.</p><p>\u201cThat they\u2019re not!\u201d said Jenny, with a quick flash of temper. \u201cThey were my mother\u2019s jewels, that my father gave to Jamie for his wife, and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd his wife I am,\u201d Laoghaire interrupted. She looked at Brianna then, a cold, gauging look.</p><p>\u201cI am his wife,\u201d she repeated. \u201cI married him in good faith, and he promised me payment for the wrong he did me.\u201d She turned her cold gaze on Jenny. \u201cIt\u2019s been more than a year since I\u2019ve seen a penny. Am I to sell my shoes to feed my daughter\u2014the one he\u2019s left to me?\u201d</p><p>She lifted her chin and looked at Brianna.</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re his daughter, then his debts are yours as well. Tell her, Hobart!\u201d</p><p>Hobart looked mildly embarrassed.</p><p>\u201cAh, now, Sister,\u201d he said, putting a hand on her arm in an attempt to be soothing. \u201cI dinna think\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, ye don\u2019t, and haven\u2019t since ye were born!\u201d She shook him off in irritation, and stretched out a hand toward the pearls. \u201cThey\u2019re mine!\u201d</p><p>It was pure reflex; the pearls were clutched tight in Brianna\u2019s hand before she had made the decision to snatch them. The gold roundels were cool against her skin, but the pearls were warm\u2014the sign of a genuine pearl, her mother had told her.</p><p>\u201cYou wait just one minute here.\u201d The strength and coldness of her own voice surprised her. \u201cI don\u2019t know who you are, and I don\u2019t know what happened between you and my father, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am Laoghaire MacKenzie, and your bastard of a father married me four years ago\u2014under false pretenses, I might add.\u201d Laoghaire\u2019s anger had not disappeared but seemed to have submerged; her face had a tight, stretched look, but she was not shouting, and the red had faded from her soft, plump cheeks.</p><p>Brianna took a deep breath, striving for calmness.</p><p>\u201cYes? But if my mother is with my father now\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe left me.\u201d</p><p>The words were spoken without heat, but they fell with the weight of stones in still water, spreading endless ripples of pain and betrayal. Young Jamie had been opening his mouth to speak; he shut it again, watching Laoghaire.</p><p>\u201cHe said that he could not bear it longer\u2014to dwell in the same house with me, to share my bed.\u201d She spoke calmly, as though reciting a piece she had learned by heart, her eyes still fixed on the empty spot where the pearls had rested.</p><p>\u201cSo he left. And then he came back\u2014with the witch. Flaunted her in my face; bedded her under my nose.\u201d Slowly, she raised her eyes to Brianna\u2019s, studying her with quiet intensity, searching out the mysteries of her face. Slowly, she nodded.</p><p>\u201cIt was she,\u201d she said, with a certainty that was faintly eerie in its calmness. \u201cShe cast her spells on him from the day she came to Leoch\u2014and on me. She made me invisible. From the day she came, he could not see me.\u201d</p><p>Brianna felt a small shiver run up her spine, despite the hissing peat fire on the hearth.</p><p>\u201cAnd then she was gone. Dead, they said. Killed in the Rising. And him come home again from England, free at long last.\u201d She shook her head very slightly; her eyes still rested on Brianna\u2019s face, but Brianna knew Laoghaire didn\u2019t see her any longer.</p><p>\u201cBut she wasna dead at all,\u201d Laoghaire said softly. \u201cAnd he was not free. I knew that; I always knew that. Ye canna kill a witch with steel\u2014 they must burn.\u201d Laoghaire\u2019s pale blue eyes turned to Jenny.</p><p>\u201cYou saw her\u2014at my wedding. Her fetch standing there, between me and him. Ye saw her, but ye didna say. I only heard it later, when ye told Maisri the seer. You should ha\u2019 told me, then.\u201d It was a not so much an accusation as a statement of fact.</p><p>Jenny\u2019s face had gone pale again, the slanted blue eyes dark with something\u2014perhaps fear. She licked her lips and started to reply, but Laoghaire\u2019s attention had shifted to Ian.</p><p>\u201cYe\u2019d best be wary, Ian Murray,\u201d she said, her tone now matter-of-fact. She nodded toward Brianna. \u201cLook at her weel, man. Is a right woman made so? Taller than most men, dressed as a man, wi\u2019 hands as broad as a dinner plate, fit to choke the life from one o\u2019 your weans, should she choose.\u201d</p><p>Ian didn\u2019t answer, though his long, homely face looked troubled. Young Jamie\u2019s fists clenched, though, and his jaw set tight. Laoghaire saw it, and a small smile touched the corners of her mouth.</p><p>\u201cShe is a witch\u2019s child,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd ye know it, all of you!\u201d She glanced around the room, challenging each uncomfortable face. \u201cThey should have burned her mother in Cranesmuir, save for the lovespell she\u2019d put on Jamie Fraser. Aye, I say be wary of what ye\u2019ve brought into your house!\u201d</p><p>Brianna brought the flat of her hand down on the table with a thump, startling everyone.</p><p>\u201cHogwash,\u201d she said loudly. She could feel the blood rushing to her face, and didn\u2019t care. All the faces were gawking, mouths open, but she had no attention to spare for anyone but Laoghaire MacKenzie.</p><p>\u201cHogwash,\u201d she said again, and pointed a finger at the woman. \u201cIf they ought to be wary of anybody, it\u2019s you, you f**king murderess!\u201d</p><p>Laoghaire\u2019s mouth was open wider than anyone\u2019s, but no sound came out.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t tell them all about Cranesmuir, did you? My mother should have, but she didn\u2019t. She thought you were too young to know what you were doing. You weren\u2019t, though, were you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat...?\u201d said Jenny, in a faint voice.</p><p>Young Jamie looked wildly at his father, who stood as though poleaxed, staring at Brianna.</p><p>\u201cShe tried to kill my mother.\u201d Brianna was having trouble controlling her voice; it cracked and trembled, but she got the words out. \u201cYou did, didn\u2019t you? You told her Geillis Duncan was ill and calling for her\u2014you knew she\u2019d go, she always went to anybody sick, she\u2019s a doctor! You knew they were going to arrest Geilie Duncan for witchcraft, and if my mother was there, they\u2019d take her, too! You thought they\u2019d burn her, and then you could have him\u2014have Jamie Fraser.\u201d</p><p>Laoghaire was white to the lips, her face set like stone. Even her eyes had no life; they were blank and dull as marbles.</p><p>\u201cI could feel her hand on him,\u201d she whispered. \u201cIn our bed. Lying there between us, wi\u2019 her hand on him, so he would stiffen and cry out to her in his sleep. She was a witch. I always knew.\u201d</p><p>The room was silent, save for the hissing of the fire, and the tender singing of a small bird outside the window. Hobart MacKenzie stirred at last, coming forward to take his sister by the arm.</p><p>\u201cCome away, a leannan,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cI\u2019ll see ye safe home now.\u201d He nodded to Ian, who returned the nod, with a small gesture that somehow conveyed both sympathy and regret.</p><p>Laoghaire allowed her brother to lead her away, unresisting, but at the door she stopped and turned back. Brianna stood still; she didn\u2019t think she could move if she tried.</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re Jamie Fraser\u2019s daughter,\u201d Laoghaire said, in a cold clear voice, \u201cand ye may be, given your looks\u2014know this. Your father is a liar and a whoremaster, a cheat and a pander. I wish ye well of each other.\u201d She gave in then to Hobart\u2019s tugging at her sleeve, and the door swung to behind her.</p><p>The rage that had filled her drained suddenly away, and Brianna leaned forward, resting her weight on the palms of her hands, the necklace hard and lumpy under her hand. Her hair had come loose, and a thick strand fell over her face. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Her eyes were closed against the dizziness that threatened to engulf her; she felt, rather than saw, the hand that touched her and tenderly smoothed the locks back from her face.</p><p>\u201cHe went on loving her,\u201d she whispered, as much to herself as to anyone else. \u201cHe didn\u2019t forget her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course he didna forget her.\u201d She opened her eyes to see Ian\u2019s long face and kind brown eyes six inches away. A broad work-worn hand rested on hers, warm and hard, a hand even larger than her own.</p><p>\u201cNeither did we,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cWill ye no have a bit more, Cousin Brianna?\u201d Joan, Young Jamie\u2019s wife, smiled across the table, serving spoon poised invitingly above the crumbled remains of a gigantic gooseberry tart.</p><p>\u201cThank you, no. I couldn\u2019t eat another bite,\u201d Brianna said, smiling back. \u201cI\u2019m stuffed!\u201d</p><p>This made Matthew and his little brother Henry giggle loudly, but a gimlet gleam from their grandmother\u2019s eye shut them up sharply. Looking round the table, though, Brianna could see suppressed laughter blooming on all the faces; from grown-ups to toddlers, they all seemed to find her slightest remark endlessly entertaining.</p><p>It was neither her unorthodox costume nor the sheer novelty of seeing a stranger, she thought\u2014even one stranger than most. There was something else; some current of joy that ran among the members of the family, unseen but lively as electricity.</p><p>She realized only slowly what it was; a remark from Ian brought it into focus.</p> <p>\u201cWe didna think that Jamie would ever have a bairn of his own.\u201d Ian\u2019s smile across the table was warm enough to melt ice. \u201cYou\u2019ll never have seen him, though?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head, swallowing the remains of the last bite, smiling back in spite of her full mouth. That was it, she thought; they were delighted with her not so much for her sake, but for Jamie\u2019s. They loved him, and they were happy not for themselves but for him.</p><p>That realization brought tears to her eyes. Laoghaire\u2019s accusations had shaken her, wild as they were, and it was a great comfort to realize that to all of these people who knew him well, Jamie Fraser was neither a liar nor a wicked man; he was indeed the man her mother thought him.</p><p>Mistaking her emotion for choking, Young Jamie pounded her helpfully on the back, making her choke in good earnest.</p><p>\u201cWill ye have written Uncle Jamie, then, to say as ye were coming to us?\u201d he asked, ignoring her coughing and red-faced spluttering.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said hoarsely. \u201cI don\u2019t know where he is.\u201d</p> <p>Jenny\u2019s gull-winged brows went up.</p><p>\u201cAye, ye said that; I\u2019d forgotten.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you know where he is now? He and my mother?\u201d Brianna bent forward anxiously, brushing pastry crumbs from her jabot.</p><p>Jenny smiled and rose from the table.</p><p>\u201cAye, I do\u2014more or less. If ye\u2019ve eaten your fill, d\u2019ye come with me, lassie. I\u2019ll fetch his last letter for ye.\u201d</p><p>Brianna rose to follow Jenny, but stopped abruptly near the door. She had vaguely noticed some paintings on the walls of the parlor earlier, but hadn\u2019t really looked at them, in the rush of emotion and event. She looked at this one, though.</p><p>Two little boys with red-gold hair, stiffly solemn in kilts and jackets, white shirts with frills showing bright against the dark coat of a huge dog that sat beside them, tongue lolling in patient boredom.</p><p>The older boy was tall and fine-featured; he sat straight and proud, chin lifted, one hand resting on the dog\u2019s head, the other protectively on the shoulder of the small brother who stood between his knees.</p> <p>It was the younger boy Brianna stared at, though. His face was round and snub-nosed, cheeks translucent and ruddy as apples. Wide blue eyes, slightly slanted, looked out under a bell of bright hair combed into an unnatural tidiness. The pose was formal, done in classic eighteenth-century style, but there was something in the robust, stocky little figure that made her smile and reach a finger to touch his face.</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you a sweetie,\u201d she said softly.</p><p>\u201cJamie was a sweet laddie, but a stubborn wee fiend, forbye.\u201d Jenny\u2019s voice by her ear startled her. \u201cBeat him or coax him, it made no difference; if he\u2019d made up his mind, it stayed made up. Come wi\u2019 me; there\u2019s another picture you\u2019ll like to see, I think.\u201d</p><p>The second portrait hung on the landing of the stairs, looking thoroughly out of place. From below she could see the ornate gilded frame, its heavy carving quite at odds with the solid, battered comfort of the house\u2019s other furnishings. It reminded her of pictures in museums; this homely setting seemed incongruous.</p><p>As she followed Jenny onto the landing the glare of light from the window disappeared, leaving the painting\u2019s surface flat and clear before her.</p><p>She gasped, and felt the hair rise on her forearms, under the linen of her shirt.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s remarkable, aye?\u201d Jenny looked from the painting to Brianna and back again, her own features marked with something between pride and awe.</p><p>\u201cRemarkable!\u201d Brianna agreed, swallowing.</p><p>\u201cYe see why we kent ye at once,\u201d her aunt went on, laying a loving hand against the carved frame.</p><p>\u201cYes. Yes, I can see that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt will be my mother, aye? Your grandmother, Ellen MacKenzie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Brianna said. \u201cI know.\u201d Dust motes stirred up by their footsteps whirled lazily through the afternoon light from the window. Brianna felt rather as though she was whirling with them, no longer anchored to reality.</p><p>Two hundred years from now, she had\u2014I will? she thought wildly\u2014stood in front of this portrait in the National Portrait Gallery, furiously denying the truth that it showed.</p><p>Ellen MacKenzie looked out at her now as she had then; long-necked and regal, slanted eyes showing a humor that did not quite touch the tender mouth. It wasn\u2019t a mirror image, by any means; Ellen\u2019s forehead was high, narrower than Brianna\u2019s, and the chin was round, not pointed, her whole face somewhat softer and less bold in its features.</p><p>But the resemblance was there, and pronounced enough to be startling; the wide cheekbones and lush red hair were the same. And around her neck was the string of pearls, gold roundels bright in the soft spring sun.</p><p>\u201cWho painted it?\u201d Brianna said at last, though she didn\u2019t need to hear the answer. The tag by the painting in the museum had given the artist as \u201cUnknown.\u201d But having seen the portrait of the two little boys below, Brianna knew, all right. This picture was less skilled, an earlier effort\u2014but the same hand had painted that hair and skin.</p><p>\u201cMy mother herself,\u201d Jenny was saying, her voice filled with a wistful pride. \u201cShe\u2019d a great hand for drawing and painting. I often wished I had the gift.\u201d</p><p>Brianna felt her fingers curl unconsciously, the illusion of the brush between them momentarily so vivid she could have sworn she felt smooth wood.</p><p>That\u2019s where, she thought, with a small shiver, and heard an almost audible click! of recognition as a tiny piece of her past dropped into place. That\u2019s where I got it.</p><p>Frank Randall had joked that he couldn\u2019t draw a straight line; Claire that she drew nothing else. But Brianna had the gift of line and curve, of light and shadow\u2014and now she had the source of the gift, as well.</p><p>What else? she thought suddenly. What else did she have that had once belonged to the woman in the picture, to the boy with the stubborn tilt to his head?</p><p>\u201cNed Gowan brought me this from Leoch,\u201d Jenny said, touching the frame with a certain reverence. \u201cHe saved it, when the English battered down the castle, after the Rising.\u201d She smiled faintly. \u201cHe\u2019s a great one for family, Ned is. He\u2019s a Lowlander from Edinburgh, wi\u2019 no kin of his own, but he\u2019s taken the MacKenzies for his clan\u2014even now the clan\u2019s no more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo more?\u201d Brianna blurted. \u201cThey\u2019re all dead?\u201d The horror in her voice made Jenny glance at her, surprised.</p><p>\u201cOch, no. I didna mean that, lass. But Leoch\u2019s gone,\u201d she added, in a softer tone. \u201cAnd the last chiefs with it\u2014Colum and his brother Dougal...they died for the Stuarts.\u201d</p><p>She had known that, of course; Claire had told her. What was surprising was the sudden rush of an unexpected grief; regret for these strangers of her newfound blood. With an effort, she swallowed the thickening in her throat and turned to follow Jenny up the stairs.</p><p>\u201cWas Leoch a great castle?\u201d she asked. Her aunt paused, hand on the banister.</p><p>\u201cI dinna ken,\u201d she said. Jenny glanced back at Ellen\u2019s picture, something like regret in her eyes.</p><p>\u201cI never saw it\u2014and now it\u2019s gone.\u201d</p><p>Entering the bedroom on the second floor was like entering an undersea cavern. The room was small, as all the rooms were, with low beams smoked black from years of peat fires, but the walls were fresh and white, and the room itself was filled with a greenish, wavering light that spilled through two large windows, filtered by the leaves of the swaying rose brier.</p><p>Here and there some bright thing blinked or glowed like a reef fish in the soft gloom; a painted doll that lay on the hearthrug, abandoned by a grandchild, a Chinese basket with a pierced coin tied to its lid by way of ornament. A brass candlestick on the table, a small painting on the wall, rich colors deep against the whitewash.</p><p>Jenny went at once to the big armoire that stood at the side of the room, and stood on tiptoe to bring down a large morocco-covered box, its corners worn with age. As she put back the lid, Brianna caught the glint of metal and a small sharp flash, as of sunlight on jewels.</p><p>\u201cHere it is.\u201d Jenny brought out a thick, folded wad of grimy paper, much traveled and much read by the looks of it, and put it into Brianna\u2019s hand. It had been sealed; a smudge of greasy wax still clung to the end of one sheet.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re in the Colony of North Carolina, but they dinna live near any town,\u201d Jenny explained. \u201cJamie writes a bit in the evenings when he can, and keeps the bits all by him, till either he or Fergus takes the journey down to Cross Creek, or a traveler passes by who will carry the letter. That suits him; he doesna write easy\u2014especially since he broke his hand that time ago.\u201d</p><p>Brianna started at the casual reference, but her aunt\u2019s calm face showed no special awareness.</p><p>\u201cSit ye down, lassie.\u201d She waved a hand, giving Brianna the choice of stool or bed.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Brianna murmured, taking the stool. So perhaps Jenny didn\u2019t know everything about Jamie and Black Jack Randall? The notion that she might know things about this unseen man that not even his beloved sister knew was in a way unsettling. To dismiss the thought, she hurriedly opened the letter.</p><p>The scrawled words sprang out at her, black and vivid. She had seen this writing before\u2014its cramped, difficult letters, with the big, looping tails, but that had been on a document two hundred years old, its ink brown and faded, its writing constrained by careful thought and formality. Here he had felt free\u2014the writing rolled across the page in a bold broken scrawl, the lines tilting drunkenly up at the ends. It was untidy, but readable for all that.</p><p>Fraser\u2019s Ridge, Monday 19 September</p><p>My dearest Jenny, </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>All here are in Good Health and Spirits, and trust that this letter will find all in your Household likewise Content.</p><p>Your son sends his Most Affectionate Regards, and begs to be Remembered to his Father, Brothers and Sisters. He bids you tell Matthew and Henry that he sends them the Encloased Object, which is the preserved Skull of an animal called Porpentine by Reason of its Prodigious Spines (though it is not at all like the small Hedge-creepie which you will know by that name, being much Greater in Size and Dwelling in the Treetops, where it Feasts upon the tender shoots). Tell Matthew and Henry that I do not know why the Teeth are orange. No Doubt the animal finds it Decorative.</p><p>Also enclosed you will find a small Present for yourself; the Patterning is contrived by use of the Quills of this same Porpentine, which the Indians dye with the juices of several Plants, before weaving them in the Ingenious Manner you see before you.</p><p>Claire has been recently much Interested by Conversation\u2014if the term can be used for a Communication limited mostly to Gesticulations and the Making of Faces (she insists I note here that she does not Make Faces, to which I reply that I am in Better Case to judge of the matter, being able to see the Face in question, which she is not)\u2014in Conversation with an old woman of the Indians, much Esteemed in this area as a Healer, who has Given her many such plants. In consequence, her fingers are Purple at present, which I find Most Decorative.</p> <p>Tuesday, 20 Sept.</p><p>I have been much Occupied today in repair and strengthening of the pen-fold in which we keep our few cows, pigs, etc. at night, to protect them from the depredations of Bears, which are plentiful. In walking to the privy this morning, I espied a great Pawprint in the mud, which Measured quite the length of my own Foot. The stock appeared Nervous and disturbed, for which Condition I can scarce Blame them.</p><p>Do not, I pray you, suffer any Alarm on our account. The Black Bears of this country are wary of Humans, and Loath to approach even a Single Man. Also, our house is strongly built, and I have forbidden Ian to go Abroad after dark, save he is Well-armed.</p><p>In the matter of Armament, our situation is much Improved. Fergus has brought back from High Point both a fine Rifle of the new kind, and several excellent Knives.</p><p>Also a large boiling kettle, whose Acquisition we have Celebrated with a great quantity of tasty Stew, made with Venison, wild Onions from the wood, dried beans, and likewise some Tomatoe-fruits, dried from the Summer. None of us Died or suffered Ill-effects from Eating of this stew, so Claire is likely right, Tomatoes are not Poison.</p> <p>Wednesday, 21 Sept.</p><p>The Bear has come again. I found large Prints and Scrapings on the new-turned ground of Claire\u2019s Garden today. The beast will be fattening for its Winter slumbers, and no doubt seeks to Digg for grubs in the fresh Earth.</p><p>I have Removed the Sow to our Pantry, since she is near Farrowing. Neither Claire nor the Sow was greatly pleased by this arrangement, but the Animal is valuable, having cost me three pound from Mr. Quillan.</p><p>Four Indians came today. They are of the kind called Tuscarora. I have met these men on several Occasions, and found them most Amiable.</p><p>The Savages having expressed a determination to hunt our particular Bear, I made them a Gift of some tobacco and a Knife, with which they seemed Pleasd.</p><p>They sat under the eaves of the House most of the morning, Smoking and talking among themselves, but then near midday made to Depart upon their Hunt. I inquired whether, the Bear seeming Fond of our Society, it would not be best for the Hunters to lie hidden nearby, in Hopes that the animal will return here.</p> <p>I was Informed\u2014with the Kindest Condescension possible through word and sign\u2014that the appearance of the Animal\u2019s droppings indicated beyond any Doubt that it had Quitted the area, and was Bound upon some errand to the west.</p><p>Being of no Mind to take issue with such Expert practitioners, I wished them luck and bade them a cordial Farewell. I could not accompany them, having urgent Labors still to perform here, but Ian and Rollo have gone with them, as they have done before.</p><p>I have loaded my new Rifle and left it ready to Hand, lest our friends\u2019 apprehension as to the Bear\u2019s intent be Mistaken.</p><p>Thursday, 22 Sept.</p><p>I was roused from Sleep last night by a Hideous Noise. This was a great Scraping, which reverberated thru the wooden logs of the wall, accompanied by such Thumps and loud Wails that I bolted from my Bed, convinced that the house was like to Fall about our Ears.</p><p>The Sow, observing the nearness of an Enemy, burst through the door of the Pantry (which I will say was flimsily made) and took Refuge beneath our Bed, squealing in a Manner to deafen us. Perceiving that the Bear was at Hand, I seiz\u2019d my new Rifle and ran outside.</p><p>It was a moonlit Night, though hazy, and I could plainly see my Adversary, a great black shape, which stretched upon its hind feet appeared near as Tall as Myself, and (to my anxious eyes) roughly three times as Wide, being at no Great Distance from me.</p><p>I fired at it, whereon it Dropped to all fours and Ran with amazing Speed toward the shelter of the nearby Wood, disappearing before I could make Shift to shoot any more.</p> <p>Come Daylight, I searched the ground for sign of Blood and found none, so cannot say did my Shot find its Target. The side of the House is decorated with several long Scrapes, as might be made with a sharpened Adze or Chizl, showing white in the Wood.</p><p>We have since been at some Pains to persuade the Sow (she is a White Sow, of Prodigious Size, a most Stubborn Temper, and not lacking in Teeth) to quit our bed and repair to her Sanctuary in the pantry. She was Reluctant, but was at length persuaded by the Combination of a trail of shattered corn laid before her, and myself at her Rear, Armed with a Stout Broom.</p><p>Monday, 26th Sept.</p><p>Ian and his Red Companions have returned, their Prey having eluded them in the wood. I shrewd them the Scratches upon the Side of the House, whereon they became Excited and talked among themselves at such a Rate I could not Follow their Words.</p><p>One man then detached a large tooth from his necklace of such items and presented it to me with great Ceremony, saying that it would serve to Identify me to the Bear-spirit, and thus protect me from Harm. I accepted this Token with all due Solemnity, and was then oblig\u2019d to present him with a piece of Honeycomb in Exchange, thus the proprieties were observ\u2019d.</p><p>Claire was called to provide the Honeycomb, and with her usual eye for such Matters, perceived that one of our guests was Unwell, being heavy-eyed, coughing, and distracted in Appearance. Claire says he is also Flushed with fever, though this is not obvious to look at him. He being too ill to continue with his Companions, we have laid him on a pallet in the corncrib.</p><p>The sow has Most Incontinently farrowed in the pantry. There are a dozen piglets, all healthy and of a Vigorous Appetite, for which God be thanked. Our own Appetites bid fair to be impoverished for the present, as the Sow viciously Attacks anyone who opens the door of the Pantry, roaring and gnashing her Teeth in Rage. I was given one egg to my supper, and informed that I shall get no more until I have Contriv\u2019d a solution to this Difficulty.</p><p>Saturday, 1 October</p><p>A great Surprise today. Two Guests have come...</p><p>\u201cIt will be a wild place.\u201d</p><p>Brianna looked up, startled. Jenny nodded at the letter, her eyes fixed on Brianna.</p><p>\u201cSavages and bears and porpentines and such. It\u2019s no much more than a wee cot, where they live, Jamie told me. And all alone, up in the high mountains. Verra wild, it will be.\u201d She looked at Brianna a little anxiously. \u201cBut ye\u2019ll still wish to go?\u201d</p><p>Brianna realized suddenly that Jenny was afraid she would not; that she would be frightened by the thought of the long journey and the savage place at the end of it. A savage place rendered suddenly real by the scrawled black words on the sheet she held\u2014but not nearly as real as the man who had written them.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going,\u201d she assured her aunt. \u201cAs soon as I can.\u201d</p><p>Jenny\u2019s face relaxed.</p><p>\u201cOh, good,\u201d she said. She held out her hand, showing Brianna a small leather pouch decorated with a panel made of porcupine\u2019s quills, stained in shades of red and black, with here and there a few quills left in their natural grayish color for contrast.</p><p>\u201cThis is the present he sent me.\u201d</p><p>Brianna took it, admiring the intricacy of the pattern, and the softness of the pale deer\u2019s hide.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s beautiful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, it is.\u201d Jenny turned away, busying herself with unnecessary tidying of the small ornaments that stood on the bookshelf. Brianna had just turned her attention back to the letter when Jenny spoke abruptly.</p><p>\u201cWill ye stay a bit?\u201d</p><p>Brianna looked up, startled.</p><p>\u201cStay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly for a day or two.\u201d Jenny turned around, the light from the window halo-bright behind her, shadowing her face.</p><p>\u201cI ken ye\u2019ll wish to be gone,\u201d she said. \u201cI should wish so much to talk wi\u2019 ye for a bit, though.\u201d</p><p>Brianna looked at her, puzzled, but could read nothing in the pale, even features and the slanted eyes so like her own.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said slowly. \u201cOf course I\u2019ll stay.\u201d</p><p>A smile touched the corner of Jenny\u2019s mouth. Her hair was deep black, streaked with white like a magpie.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good,\u201d she said softly. The smile spread slowly as she looked at her niece.</p><p>\u201cDear Lord, you\u2019re like my brother!\u201d</p><p>Left alone, Brianna returned to the letter, rereading the beginning slowly, letting the quiet room around her fade, disappearing as Jamie Fraser came to life in her hands, his voice so vivid in her inner ear that he might have stood before her, the sun from the window glinting on his red hair.</p><p>Saturday, 1 October</p><p>A great Surprise today. Two Guests have come from Cross Creek. You will recall, I think, my Telling you of Lord John Grey, whom I knew in Ardsmuir. I have not said that I had seen him since, in Jamaica, where he was Governor for the Crown.</p><p>He is perhaps the last Person one should expect to find in this Remote Place, so far Removed from all Traces of Civilization, let alone those Luxurious Offices and Trappings of Pomp to which he is Accustomed. Surely we were Most Astonish\u2019d by his appearing at our door, though we at once made him Welcome.</p><p>It is a melancholy Event that has led him here, I am Sorry to say. His wife, embarked from England with her son, contracted a Fever on the voyage, and Died of it while on the Ocean. Fearing lest the Miasmas of the Tropics prove as Fatal to the Boy as to his Mother, Lord John determined that the lad must go to Virginia, where Lord John\u2019s family has Substantial Property, and Determined to escort him there himself, seeing that the Lad was greatly Desolated by loss of his Mother.</p><p>I Expressed Amazement, as well as Gratification, that they should chuse to make such Alteration in their Journey as required to visit this Distant Spot, but his Lordship dismisses this, saying that he would have the Boy see something of the different Colonies, so as to appreciate the Richness and Variety of this Land. The lad is most Desirous of encountering Red Indians\u2014reminding me in this Respect of Ian, not so long ago.</p><p>He is a comely lad, tall and Well-form\u2019d for his Years, which I believe are near Twelve. He is somewhat subject still to Melancholy from his Mother\u2019s death, but is most Pleasant in Conversation, and Mannerly, for all he is an Earl (Lord John is his stepfather, I believe; his father having been Earl of Ellesmere). His name is William. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Brianna turned the page over, expecting continuation, but the passage stopped on that abrupt note. There was a break of several days before the letter resumed, on the 4th of October.</p><p>Tuesday, 4 October</p><p>The Indian in the corncrib died early this morning, in spite of Claire\u2019s best efforts to save him. His face, body and limbs were entirely suffused with a dreadful Rash, giving him a most Grewsome and Mottled look.</p><p>Claire thinks he suffered from the Measle, and is much Concerned, this being a Vicious Disease, plaguish and quick to Spread. She would not suffer anyone to go near the Body save only herself\u2014she says she is Safe from it, by means of some charm\u2014but we did all Assemble near Midday, whereat I read some Scripture suitable to the Occasion, and we said a Prayer for the Repose of his soul\u2014for I trust that even unbaptised Savages may find rest in God\u2019s Mercy.</p> <p>We are in some doubt how this poor soul\u2019s Earthly Remains shall be Disposed. I would in common course send Ian to summon his Friends, that they might give him such Burial as is common among the Indians.</p><p>Claire says we must not do this, however, for the Corpse itself may Spread the Disease among the man\u2019s own People, a Disaster which he would not Chuse to bring upon his Friends. She advocates burying or Burning the Corpse ourselves, and yet I am reluctant to undertake such Action, which might be easily Misunderstood by the man\u2019s Companions\u2014they thinking that we Sought by this means to hide some Complicity in his Death.</p><p>I have said nothing of this Concern to our Guests. If Danger seems Imminent, I must send them away. Still, I am loathe to Part with their society, so isolated is our situation. For now, we have Laid the Body in a small Dry Cave in the hill above the House, wherein I had thought to build a Stable or Storehouse.</p><p>I ask your forgiveness for thus Unburdening my Mind at the cost of your own Peace. I think all will be Well in the end, but for the Moment, I confess to some Worry. Should Danger\u2014either from Indians or Disease\u2014seem to threaten, I will send this Letter at once in the care of our Guests, that it may be Certain of reaching you.</p><p>If all is Well, I will write quickly to tell you.</p> <p>Your Most Loving Brother,</p><p>Jamie Fraser</p><p>Brianna\u2019s mouth felt dry and she swallowed, forcing saliva. There were two sheets yet to the letter; they clung together for a moment, stubbornly resisting her efforts to separate them, and then gave way.</p><p>Postscriptum, 20 October</p><p>We are all Safe, though the Manner of our Deliverance is most Melancholy; I will tell you of it later, having no great Heart for the matter at present.</p><p>Ian has been Sick of the Measle, as has Lord John, but they are both Recovered, and Claire bids me say that Ian does Exceeding well, you shall have no Fear for him. He writes in his own Hand, that you may know it is the Truth.</p> <p>\u2014J.</p><p>On the last sheet was writing in a different hand, this one neat and carefully schooled to an even slant, though here and there a blot defaced the page, perhaps the result either of the writer\u2019s illness or a defective pen.</p><p>Dear Mam\u2014</p><p>I have been Sick, but am all Right agayne. I had a Fever, with most Peculiar Dreams, full of odd things. There was a great Wolf that came and spoke to me in the Voice of a man, but Auntie Claire says this must have been Rollo, who Stayed by me all the time I was Ill, he is a very Good Dog and does not bite very often.</p><p>The Measles came out in small Bumps beneath my Skin, and itched like Fury. I should have thought I had sat down on an Anthill, or wandered into a Hornet\u2019s nest. My head felt twice its usual Size, and I sneezed quite Ferocious.</p><p>I had three Eggs to my Breakfast today, and porridge, and have Walked to the privy alone twice, so I am quite Well, though I thought at first the Sickness had left me Blind\u2014I could see nothing but a great Dazzle of Light when I went outside, but Auntie said this would soon be remedied, and it was.</p><p>I will write more later\u2014Fergus is waiting to take the Letter away.</p><p>Your most Obedient and Devoted Son,</p> <p>Ian Murray</p><p>P.S. The Porpentine skull is for Henry and Mattie, I hope they will like it.</p><p>Brianna sat on the stool for some time, the whitewashed wall cool at her back, smoothing the pages of the letter and staring absently at the bookcase, with its neat row of cloth and leather bindings. Robinson Crusoe popped out at her, the title picked out in gold on the spine.</p><p>A savage place, Jenny had said. A dangerous place, too, where life could shift within a heartbeat from the humorous difficulty of a hog in the pantry to the instant threat of death by violence.</p><p>\u201cAnd I thought this was primitive,\u201d she murmured, with a glance at the peat fire on the hearth.</p><p>Not so primitive after all, she thought as she followed Ian through the barnyard and out past the outbuildings. Everything was well kept and tidy; the drystone walls and buildings all in good repair, if a little shabby. The chickens were carefully confined to their own yard, and a hovering cloud of flies behind the barn announced the presence of a discreet manure pit, well away from the house.</p><p>The only real difference between this farmyard and modern ones she had seen was the absence of rusting farm equipment; there was a shovel resting against the barn, and two or three battered plowshares in a shed that they passed, but no ramshackle tractor; no tangles of wire and scattered metal scraps.</p><p>The animals were healthy, too, if somewhat smaller than their modern counterparts. A loud \u201cBaaah!\u201d announced the presence of a small herd of fat sheep in a paddock on the hillside, who trotted eagerly up to the fence as they passed, woolly backs wobbling and yellow eyes agleam in anticipation.</p><p>\u201cSpoilt bastards,\u201d Ian said, but with a smile. \u201cThink anyone\u2019s come up here has come to feed ye, don\u2019t you? My wife\u2019s,\u201d he added, turning to Brianna. \u201cShe gives them all the cast-off truck from the kailyard, till ye\u2019d think they\u2019d burst.\u201d</p><p>The ram, a majestic creature with great coiled horns, extended his head over the fence and emitted an imperious \u201cBeheheh!\u201d that was immediately echoed by his faithful flock.</p><p>\u201cBugger off, Hughie,\u201d said Ian, with tolerant scorn. \u201cYou\u2019re no mutton yet, but the day\u2019ll come, aye?\u201d He waved dismissively at the ram and turned up the hill, kilt swinging.</p><p>Brianna hung back a step, watching his stride in fascination. Ian wore his kilt with an air quite unlike anything she was used to; not a costume nor a uniform\u2014with a conscious bearing, but more as though it were part of his body than an article of clothing.</p><p>In spite of that, she knew it wasn\u2019t usual for him to wear it; Jenny\u2019s eyes had opened wide when he had come down to breakfast; then she had bent her head, burying a smile in her cup. Young Jamie had flicked a dark brow at his father, got back a bland look, and settled to his sausage with a faint shrug, and one of those small subterranean noises common to Scottish males.</p><p>The plaid cloth was old\u2014she could see the fading along the creases and the wornness at the hem\u2014but carefully kept. It would have been hidden away after Culloden, along with the pistols and the swords, with the pipes and their pibrochs\u2014all the symbols of pride conquered.</p><p>No, not quite conquered, she thought, with a queer small tug at her heart. She remembered Roger Wakefield, squatting beside her under a gray sky on the battlefield at Culloden, his face lean and dark, eyes shadowed with knowledge of the dead nearby.</p><p>\u201cScots have long memories,\u201d he\u2019d said, \u201cand they\u2019re not the most forgiving of people. There\u2019s a clan stone out there with the name of MacKenzie carved on it, and a good many of my relatives under it.\u201d He had smiled then, but not in jest. \u201cI don\u2019t feel quite so personal about it as some, but I haven\u2019t forgotten either.\u201d</p><p>No, not conquered. Not through a thousand years of strife and treachery, and not now. Defeated, scattered, but still surviving. Like Ian, maimed but upright. Like her father, exiled but still a Highlander.</p><p>With an effort she put Roger from her mind, and hurried to keep up with Ian\u2019s long, limping stride.</p><p>His lean face had lighted with pleasure when she had asked him to show her Lallybroch. It had been arranged that Young Jamie would take her to Inverness in a week\u2019s time, to see her safely aboard a ship to the Colonies, and she meant to use her time here to good advantage.</p><p>They walked\u2014at a good pace, despite Ian\u2019s leg\u2014over the fields toward the small foothills that rimmed the valley to the north, rising toward the pass through the black crags. It was a beautiful place, she thought. The pale green fields of oats and barley rippled with shifting light, cloud-shadows scudding through the spring sunshine, driven by the breeze that bent the stems of budding grass.</p><p>One field lay in long, dark ridges, the dirt humped and bare. At the side of the field stood a large heap of rough stones, neatly stacked.</p><p>\u201cIs that a cairn?\u201d she asked Ian, voice lowered in respect. Cairns were the memorials of the dead, her mother had told her\u2014sometimes the very long dead\u2014new rocks added to the heap by each passing visitor.</p><p>He glanced at her in surprise, caught the direction of her gaze, and grinned.</p><p>\u201cAh, no, lass. Those are the stones we turned up wi\u2019 the plow in the spring. Every year we take them out, and every year there come new ones. Damned if I ken where they come from,\u201d he added, shaking his head in resignation. \u201cStone fairies come and sow them in the night, I expect.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t know whether this was a joke or not. Uncertain whether to laugh, she asked a question instead.</p><p>\u201cWhat will you plant here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, it\u2019s planted already.\u201d Ian shaded his eyes, squinting across the long field with pride. \u201cThis is the tattie field. The new vines will be up by the end of the month.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTattie\u2014oh, potatoes!\u201d She looked at the field with new interest. \u201cMama told me about that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, it was Claire\u2019s notion\u2014and a good one, too. There\u2019s more than once the tatties have kept us from starving.\u201d He smiled briefly but said nothing more, and moved off, heading for the wild hills beyond the fields.</p><p>It was a long walk. The day was breezy, but warm, and Brianna was sweating by the time they paused at last, halfway up a rough track through the heather. The narrow path seemed to perch precariously between a steep hillside and an even steeper fall down a sheer rock face into a small, splashing burn.</p><p>Ian stopped, wiping his brow with his sleeve, and motioned her to a seat amid the heaps of granite boulders. From this vantage point, the valley lay below them, the farmhouse seeming small and incongruous, its fields a feeble intrusion of civilization on the surrounding wilderness of crag and heather.</p><p>He brought out a stone bottle from the sack he carried, and drew the cork with his teeth.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019ll be your mother\u2019s doing, too,\u201d he said with a grin, handing her the bottle. \u201cThat I\u2019ve kept my teeth, I mean.\u201d He passed the tip of his tongue meditatively over his front teeth, shaking his head.</p><p>\u201cA great one for eatin\u2019 weeds, your mother, but who\u2019s to argue, eh? Half the men my age are eatin\u2019 naught but porridge now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was always telling me to eat up my vegetables, when I was little. And brush after every meal.\u201d Brianna took the bottle from him and tilted it into her mouth; the ale was strong and bitter, but welcomely cool after the long walk. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhen ye were little, eh?\u201d Amused, Ian cast an eye over her length. \u201cI\u2019ve seldom seen a lass sae braw. I\u2019d say your mother kent her business, aye?\u201d</p><p>She smiled back and gave him back the bottle.</p><p>\u201cShe knew enough to marry a tall man, at least,\u201d she said wryly.</p><p>Ian laughed and wiped the back of his hand across his mouth. He gazed affectionately at her, brown eyes warm.</p> <p>\u201cAh, it\u2019s fine to see ye, lassie. You\u2019re verra much like him, it\u2019s true. Christ, what I wouldna give to be there when Jamie sees you!\u201d</p><p>She looked down at the ground, biting her lip. The ground was thick with bracken, and their path up the hill showed plain, where the green fronds that had overgrown the track had been crushed and knocked aside.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know whether he knows or not,\u201d she blurted. \u201cAbout me.\u201d She glanced up at him. \u201cHe didn\u2019t tell you.\u201d</p><p>Ian rocked back a little, frowning.</p><p>\u201cNo, that\u2019s true,\u201d he said slowly. \u201cBut I am thinking he maybe hadna time to say, even if he knew. He\u2019ll not have been here long, that last time he came, with Claire. And then, it was such a moil, wi\u2019 all that happened\u2014\u201d He stopped, pursing his lips, and glanced at her.</p> <p>\u201cYour auntie\u2019s been troubled about that,\u201d he said. \u201cThinking that ye might blame her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBlame her for what?\u201d She stared at him, puzzled.</p><p>\u201cFor Laoghaire.\u201d The brown eyes held hers, intent.</p><p>A faint chill came over Brianna at the memory of those pale eyes, cold as marbles, and the woman\u2019s hateful words. She had dismissed them as simple malice, but the echoes of \u201cwhoremaster\u201d and \u201ccheat\u201d lingered unpleasantly in her ear.</p><p>\u201cWhat did Aunt Jenny have to do with Laoghaire?\u201d</p><p>Ian sighed, brushing back a thick lock of brown hair that fell down across his face.</p> <p>\u201cIt was her doing that Jamie married the woman. She meant it well, mind,\u201d he said warningly. \u201cWe did think Claire was dead these many years.\u201d</p><p>His tone held a question, but Brianna merely nodded, looking down and smoothing the fabric across her knee. This was dangerous ground; better to say nothing, if she could. After a moment, Ian went on.</p><p>\u201cIt was after he\u2019d come home from England\u2014he was a prisoner there for some years after the Rising\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>Ian\u2019s brows shot up in surprise, but he said nothing; simply shook his head.</p><p>\u201cAye, well. When he came back, he was\u2014different. Well, he would be, aye?\u201d He smiled briefly, then dropped his eyes, pleating the fabric of his kilt between his fingers.</p><p>\u201cIt was like talking to a ghost,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cHe would look at me, and smile, and answer\u2014but he wasna really there.\u201d He took a deep breath, and she could see the lines between his brows, carved deep in concentration.</p><p>\u201cBefore\u2014after Culloden\u2014it was different, then. He was sair wounded\u2014and he\u2019d lost Claire\u2014\u201d He glanced briefly at her, but she kept still, and he went on.</p> <p>\u201cBut it was a desperate time then. A great many folk died; of the fighting, of sickness or of starving. There were English soldiers in the country, burning, killing. When it\u2019s like that, ye canna even think of dying, only because the struggle to live and keep your family takes all your time.\u201d</p><p>A small smile touched Ian\u2019s lips, the rue of memory oddly lightened with a private amusement.</p><p>\u201cJamie hid,\u201d he said, with an abrupt gesture toward the hillside above them. \u201cThere. There\u2019s a wee cave behind that big gorse bush, halfway up. It\u2019s what I brought ye here to show ye.\u201d</p><p>She looked where he pointed, up the tangled slope of rock and heather, the hillside a riot of tiny flowers. There was no sign of a cave, but the gorse bush stood out in a blaze of yellow blossom, brilliant as a torch.</p><p>\u201cI came up to bring him food once, when he was sick of the ague. I told him he must come down to the house wi\u2019 me; that Jenny was scairt he\u2019d die up here, all alone. He opened one eye, all bright with the fever, and his voice was sae hoarse I could scarcely hear him. He said Jenny needna be worrit; even though everything in the world seemed set on killin\u2019 him, he didna mean to make it easy for them. Then he closed his eye and went to sleep.\u201d</p><p>Ian gave her a wry glance. \u201cI wasna so sure he had that much to say about whether he was going to die or no, so I stayed with him through the night. But he was right, after all; he\u2019s verra stubborn, ye ken?\u201d His tone held a note of a mild apology.</p><p>Brianna nodded, but her throat felt too tight to speak. Instead she stood up abruptly, and headed up the hill. Ian made no protest, but stayed on his rock, watching her.</p><p>It was a steep climb, and small thorny plants caught at her stockings. Near the cave, she had to scramble upward on all fours, to keep her balance on the steep granite slope.</p><p>The cave mouth was little more than a crack in the rock, the opening widening into a small triangle at the bottom. She knelt down and thrust her head and shoulders inside.</p><p>The chill was immediate; she could feel dampness condense on her cheeks. It took a moment for her sight to adapt to the dark, but enough light trickled into the cave past her shoulders for her to see.</p><p>It was perhaps eight feet long and six feet wide, a dim, dirt-floored cavity, with a ceiling so low that one could stand upright only near the entrance. To stay inside for any length of time would be like being entombed.</p><p>She pulled her head out quickly, breathing in deep gulps of the fresh spring air. Her heart was beating heavily.</p><p>Seven years! Seven years to have lived here, in cold grime and gnawing hunger. I wouldn\u2019t last seven days, she thought.</p><p>Wouldn\u2019t you? said another part of her mind. And then it came again, that tiny click of recognition that she had felt when she had looked at Ellen\u2019s portrait, and felt her fingers close on an invisible brush.</p><p>She turned around slowly and sat down, the cave behind her. It was very quiet here on the mountainside, but quiet in the way of hills and forests, a quiet that was not silent at all, but composed of constant tiny sounds.</p><p>There were small buzzings in the gorse bush nearby, of bees working the yellow flowers, dusty with pollen. Far below was the rushing of the burn, a low note echoing the rush of the wind above, stirring leaves and rattling twigs, sighing past the jutting boulders.</p><p>She sat still, and listened, and thought she knew what Jamie Fraser had found here.</p><p>Not loneliness, but solitude. Not suffering, but endurance, the discovery of grim kinship with the rocks and sky. And the finding here of a harsh peace that would transcend bodily discomfort, a healing instead of the wounds of the soul.</p><p>He had perhaps found the cave not a tomb, but a refuge; drawn strength from its rocks, like Antaeus thrown to earth. For this place was part of him, who had been born here, as it was part of her, who had never seen it before.</p><p>Ian was still sitting patiently below; hands clasped about his knees, looking out over the valley. She reached up and carefully broke off a bit of the gorse-bush, mindful of its spines. She laid it at the entrance of the cave, weighted with a small stone, then stood and made her way precariously down the hill.</p><p>Ian must have heard her approach, but didn\u2019t turn around. She sat down beside him.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s safe for you to wear that, now?\u201d she said abruptly, with a nod at his kilt.</p><p>\u201cOh, aye,\u201d he said. He glanced down, his fingers rubbing the soft, worn wool. \u201cIt\u2019s been some years now since the soldiers last came. After all, what\u2019s left?\u201d He gestured over the valley below.</p><p>\u201cThey carried away all they could find of value. Ruined what they couldna carry. There\u2019s no much left, save the land, is there? And I think they hadna much interest in that.\u201d She could see he was disturbed in some way; his wasn\u2019t a face that hid its owner\u2019s feelings.</p><p>She watched him for a moment, then said quietly, \u201cYou\u2019re still here. You and Jenny.\u201d</p><p>His hand stilled, and lay against the plaid. His eyelids were closed, his homely, weathered face raised to the sun.</p><p>\u201cAye, that\u2019s true,\u201d he said at last. He opened his eyes again, and turned to look at her. \u201cAnd so are you. We talked a bit last night, your auntie and I. When ye see Jamie, and all\u2019s well between ye\u2014then ask him, if ye will, what would he have us do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo? About what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout Lallybroch.\u201d He waved, taking in the valley and the house below. He turned to her, eyes troubled.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll maybe know\u2014maybe not\u2014that your father made a deed of sassine before Culloden, to give over the place to Young Jamie, should it all come to smash and he be killed or condemned as a traitor. But that would be before you were born; before he kent that he\u2019d have a bairn of his own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I did know that.\u201d She had a sudden awareness of what he was leading up to, and put her hand on his arm, startling him with the touch.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t come for that, Uncle,\u201d she said softly. \u201cLallybroch isn\u2019t mine\u2014and I don\u2019t want it. All I want is to see my father\u2014and my mother.\u201d</p><p>Ian\u2019s long face relaxed, and he put his hand over hers where it lay on his arm. He didn\u2019t say anything for a moment; then squeezed her hand gently and let it go.</p><p>\u201cAye, well. You\u2019ll tell him, nonetheless; if he wishes it\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe won\u2019t,\u201d she interrupted firmly.</p><p>Ian looked at her, a faint smile at the back of his eyes.</p><p>\u201cYe ken a lot about what he\u2019ll do, for a lass that\u2019s never met him.\u201d</p><p>She smiled at him, the spring sun warm on her shoulders.</p><p>\u201cMaybe I do.\u201d</p><p>The smile broke through to Ian\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cAye, your mother will ha\u2019 told ye, I suppose. And she did know him, for all she was a Sassenach. But then, she was always...special, your mother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d She hesitated for a moment, wanting to hear more about the topic of Laoghaire, but unsure how to ask. Before she could think of something, he stood, brushed down his kilt, and started down the track, forcing her to rise and follow.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s a fetch, Uncle Ian?\u201d she asked the back of his head. Preoccupied with the difficulties of descent, he didn\u2019t turn, but she saw him lurch slightly, wooden leg sinking into the loose earth. At the bottom of the hill he waited for her, leaning on his stick.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be thinking of what Laoghaire said?\u201d he asked. Without waiting for her nod, he turned and began making his way along the bottom of the hill, toward the small stream that flowed down through the rocks.</p><p>\u201cA fetch is the sight of a person, when the person himself is far awa\u2019,\u201d he said. \u201cSometimes it will be a person that\u2019s died, far from home. It\u2019s ill luck to see one, but worse luck to meet your own\u2014for if you do, ye die.\u201d</p><p>It was the absolute matter-of-factness of his tone that made a shiver run down her spine.</p><p>\u201cI hope I don\u2019t,\u201d she said. \u201cBut she said\u2014Laoghaire\u2014\u201d She stumbled on the name.</p><p>\u201cL\u2019heery,\u201d Ian corrected. \u201cAye, well. It was at her wedding to Jamie that Jenny saw your mother\u2019s fetch, that\u2019s true. She kent then that it was a bad match, but it was too late to be undone.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He knelt awkwardly on his good knee, and splashed water from the burn over his face. Brianna did likewise, and gulped several handfuls of the cold, peaty-tasting water. Having no towel, she pulled her long shirttail from her breeks and wiped her face. She caught Ian\u2019s scandalized look at the glimpse of her bare stomach thus afforded, and dropped the shirttail abruptly, her cheeks flushing.</p><p>\u201cYou were going to tell me why my father married her,\u201d she said, to hide her embarrassment.</p><p>Ian\u2019s cheeks had gone a dull red, and he turned hastily away, talking to cover his confusion.</p><p>\u201cAye. It was as I told ye\u2014when Jamie came from England, it was like the spark had gone out o\u2019 him, and there was nothing here to kindle it again. I dinna ken what it was that happened in England, but something did, sure as I\u2019m born.\u201d</p> <p>He shrugged, the back of his neck fading to its normal sunburnt brown.</p><p>\u201cAfter Culloden, he was bad hurt, but there was fighting still to do, of a kind, and that kept him alive. When he came home from England\u2014there wasna anything here for him, really.\u201d He spoke quietly, eyes cast down, watching his footing on the rocky ground.</p><p>\u201cSo Jenny made the match for him, with Laoghaire.\u201d He glanced at her, eyes bright and shrewd.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll maybe be old enough to know, for all you\u2019re unwed yet. What a woman can do for a man\u2014or he for her, I suppose. To heal him, I mean. Fill his emptiness.\u201d He touched his maimed leg absently. \u201cJamie wed Laoghaire from pity, I think\u2014and if she had truly needed him\u2014aye, well.\u201d He shrugged again, and smiled at her.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s no use to say what might have been or should be, is it? But he had left Laoghaire\u2019s house some time before your mother came back, you should know that.\u201d</p> <p>Brianna felt a small surge of relief.</p><p>\u201cOh. I\u2019m glad to know that. And my mother\u2014when she came back\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was verra glad to see her,\u201d Ian said simply. This time the smile lighted his whole face, like sunshine. \u201cSo was I.\u201d</p><p>35</p><p>BON VOYAGE</p><p>It reminded her uncomfortably of Boston\u2019s city dog pound. A large, halfdark space whose rafters rang with yelping, and an atmosphere dense with animal smells. The big building on the market square in Inverness sheltered a great many enterprises\u2014food vendors, cattle and swine brokers, assurance agents, ship-chandlers and Royal Navy recruiters, but it was the group of men, women and children bunched in one corner that lent most force to the illusion.</p> <p>Here and there a man or a woman stood upright amid the group, chin out and shoulders set in a show of good health and spirit, putting themselves forward. But for the most part, the people who offered themselves for sale eyed the passersby warily, in darting glances whose expressions were fixed between hope and fear\u2014much too reminiscent of the dogs in the animal shelter where her father had now and then taken her to adopt a pet.</p><p>There were several families, too, with children clinging to their mothers, or standing blank-faced beside their parents. She tried not to look at them; it was always the puppies that had broken her heart.</p><p>Young Jamie was sidling slowly around the group, hat held against his chest to save it being crushed by the crowd, eyes half closed as he considered the prospects on offer. Her uncle Ian had gone to the shipping office to arrange her passage to America, leaving her cousin Jamie to choose a servant to accompany her on the journey. In vain had she protested that she didn\u2019t need a servant; after all, she had\u2014so far as they knew\u2014traveled from France to Scotland by herself, in perfect safety.</p><p>The men had nodded and smiled and listened with every evidence of polite attention\u2014and here she was, obediently following Young Jamie through the crowd like one of her aunt Jenny\u2019s sheep. She was beginning to understand exactly what her mother had meant by describing the Frasers as \u201cstubborn as rocks.\u201d</p><p>Despite the hubbub around her and her annoyance at her male relatives, her heart gave a small, excited bounce at thought of her mother. It was only now, when she knew for sure that Claire was safe, that she could admit to herself how sorely she had missed her. And her father\u2014that unknown Highlander who had come so suddenly and vividly to life for her as she read his letters. The minor fact of an intervening ocean seemed no more than a small inconvenience.</p><p>Her cousin Jamie interrupted these rosy thoughts by taking her arm and leaning close to shout in her ear.</p><p>\u201cYon fellow wi\u2019 the cast in one eye,\u201d he said in a subdued bellow, indicating the gentleman in question by pointing with his chin. \u201cWhat d\u2019ye say to him, Brianna?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d say he looks like the Boston Strangler,\u201d she muttered, then louder, shouting into her cousin\u2019s ear, \u201cHe looks like an ox! No!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s strong, and he looks honest!\u201d</p><p>Brianna thought the gentleman in question looked too stupid to be dishonest, but refrained from saying so, merely shaking her head emphatically.</p><p>Young Jamie shrugged philosophically and resumed his scrutiny of the would-be bondsmen, walking around those who took his particular interest and peering at them closely, in a way she might have thought exceedingly rude had a number of other potential employers not been doing likewise.</p><p>\u201cBridies! Hot bridies!\u201d A high-pitched screech cut through the rumble and racket of the hall, and Brianna turned to see an old woman elbowing her way robustly through the crowd, a steaming tray hung round her neck and a wooden spatula in hand.</p><p>The heavenly scent of fresh hot dough and spiced meat cut through the other pungencies in the hall, noticeable as the old woman\u2019s calling. It had been a long time since breakfast, and Brianna dug in her pocket, feeling saliva fill her mouth.</p><p>Ian had taken her purse to pay for her passage, but she had two or three loose coins; she held one up and waved it to and fro. The bridie seller spotted the flash of silver and at once altered course, tacking through the chattering mob. She hove to in front of Brianna and reached up to snatch the coin.</p><p>\u201cMary save us, a giantess!\u201d she said, showing strong yellow teeth in a grin as she tilted her head back to look up at Brianna. \u201cYe\u2019d best take twa, my dearie. One will never do a great lass like you!\u201d</p><p>Heads turned, and faces grinned up at her. She stood half a head higher than most of the men nearby. Mildly embarrassed by the attention, Brianna gave the nearest offender a cold look. This seemed to entertain the young man quite a lot; he staggered back against his friend, clutching his breast and pretending to be overcome.</p><p>\u201cMy God!\u201d he said. \u201cShe looked at me! I\u2019m heartstruck!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOch, awa\u2019 wi\u2019 ye,\u201d his friend scoffed, shoving him upright. \u201c \u2019Twas me she was looking at; who\u2019d look at you if they\u2019d a choice?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing of the sort,\u201d his friend protested stoutly. \u201cIt was me\u2014wasn\u2019t it, darlin\u2019?\u201d He languished, making calf\u2019s eyes at Brianna and looking so ridiculous that she laughed, along with the crowd around her.</p><p>\u201cAnd what would ye be doing with her, if ye got her, eh? She\u2019d make two of ye. Now, off wi\u2019 ye, spawn,\u201d the bridie seller said, casually smacking the young man across the buttocks with her wooden spatula. \u201cI\u2019ve business, if you haven\u2019t. And the young woman will starve if ye dinna leave off playin\u2019 the fool and let her buy her dinner, aye?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe looks in fine flesh to me, grannie.\u201d Brianna\u2019s admirer, ignoring both assault and admonition, ogled her shamelessly. \u201cAnd as for the rest\u2014fetch me a ladder, Bobby, I\u2019m no afraid of heights!\u201d</p><p>Amid gales of laughter, the young man was dragged away by his friends, making loud kissing noises over his shoulder as he moved reluctantly off. Brianna took her change in coppers and retired into a corner to eat two of the hot beef pasties, her face still warm with laughter and self-consciousness.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t been so aware of her height since she had been a gawky seventh-grader, towering over all her classmates. Among her tall cousins, she had felt at home, but it was true; here she stuck out like a sore thumb, despite her having abided by Jenny\u2019s insistence and changed from her men\u2019s clothes to a dress of her cousin Janet\u2019s, hastily altered and let out in the seams.</p><p>Her sense of self-consciousness was not helped by the fact that no underclothes went with the dress, beyond a shift. No one seemed to find any lack in this state of affairs, but she was intensely conscious of the unaccustomed feeling of airiness about her nether parts, and the odd feeling of her nak*d thighs sliding past each other as she walked, her silk stockings gartered just above the knee.</p><p>Both self-consciousness and drafts were forgotten as she bit into the first hot pastry. A bridie was a plump hot pie in a half-moon shape, filled with minced steak and suet and spiced with onion. A rush of hot, rich juice and flaky pastry filled her mouth, and she closed her eyes in bliss.</p><p>\u201cThe food was either terribly bad or terribly good,\u201d Claire had said, describing her adventures in the past. \u201cThat\u2019s because there\u2019s no way of keeping things; anything you eat has either been salted or preserved in lard, if it isn\u2019t half rancid\u2014or else it\u2019s fresh off the hoof or out of the garden, in which case it can be bloody marvelous.\u201d</p><p>The bridie was bloody marvelous, Brianna decided, even if it did keep dropping crumbs down the top of her bodice. She brushed at her bosom, trying to be unobtrusive, but the crowd\u2019s attention had turned\u2014no one was looking at her now.</p><p>Or almost no one. A slight, fair man in a shabby coat had materialized by her elbow, making small nervous movements as though he wanted to pluck her sleeve but hadn\u2019t quite got up the nerve. Not sure whether he was a beggar or another importunate suitor, she looked suspiciously down her nose at him.</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2014you are requiring a servant, ma\u2019am?\u201d</p><p>She dropped her aloofness, realizing that he must be one of the crowd of indentures.</p><p>\u201cOh. Well, I wouldn\u2019t say I require one, exactly, but it looks as though I\u2019m going to get one anyway.\u201d She glanced at Young Jamie, who was now interrogating a squat, beetle-browed individual with shoulders like the Village Blacksmith. Young Jamie\u2019s notion of the ideal servant seemed to be limited to muscle. She looked back at the small man in front of her; he wasn\u2019t much by Young Jamie\u2019s standards, but by hers...</p><p>\u201cAre you interested?\u201d she asked.</p><p>The expression of haggard nervousness didn\u2019t leave his face, but a fugitive gleam of hope showed in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2014I\u2014that is\u2014not me, no. But will you think\u2014perhaps consider\u2014will you take my daughter?\u201d he said abruptly. \u201cPlease!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour daughter?\u201d Brianna looked down at him, startled, her half-eaten bridie forgotten.</p><p>\u201cI beg you, ma\u2019am!\u201d To her surprise, tears stood in the man\u2019s eyes. \u201cYe cannot think how urgently I pray you, or what gratitude I must bear ye!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014ah\u2014\u201d Brianna brushed crumbs from the corner of her mouth, feeling desperately awkward.</p><p>\u201cShe is a strong girl in spite of her appearance, and most willing! She will be content to do any service whatever for ye, ma\u2019am, and ye\u2019ll buy her contract!\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBut why should\u2014look, what\u2019s the trouble?\u201d she said, moved past awkwardness by curiosity and pity for his obvious distress. She took him by the arm and drew him into the shelter of a corner, where the racket was slightly diminished.</p><p>\u201cNow, why are you so anxious that I should hire your daughter?\u201d</p><p>She could see the muscles move in his throat as he swallowed convulsively.</p><p>\u201cThere is a man. He\u2014he desires her. Not as a servant. As a\u2014as a\u2014concubine.\u201d The words came out in a hoarse whisper, and a flood of ugly crimson stained his face.</p> <p>\u201cMmphm,\u201d said Brianna, discovering all at once the utility of this ambiguous expression. \u201cI see. But you needn\u2019t let your daughter go to him, surely?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have no choice.\u201d His agony was patent. \u201cHer contract has been bought by Mr. Ransom\u2014the broker.\u201d He jerked his head backward, indicating a tough-looking gentleman in a tie-wig, who was talking to Young Jamie. \u201cHe can dispose of it to whom he will\u2014and he will sell her without a moment\u2019s hesitation to this...this...\u201d He choked, overcome by despair.</p><p>\u201cHere, take this.\u201d She hastily untucked the wide kerchief from her bodice, took it off her neck, and handed it to him. It left her slightly less than modest, but this seemed like an emergency.</p><p>Clearly it was, to him. He swabbed blindly at his face, then dropped the cloth and seized her free hand in both of his.</p><p>\u201cHe is a drover; he has gone to the cattle market to sell his beasts. When he has done so, he will return with the money for her contract, and take her away to his house in Aberdeen. When I heard him say so to Ransom, I was thrown into the most violent despair. I prayed most urgently to the Lord for her deliverance. And then\u2014\u201d He gulped.</p> <p>\u201cI saw you\u2014so proud and noble and kind-seeming\u2014and it did come to me as my prayers were answered. Oh, ma\u2019am, I pray ye, do not disdain a father\u2019s plea. Take her!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I\u2019m going to America! You\u2019d never\u2014\u201d She bit her lip. \u201cI mean, you wouldn\u2019t see her\u2014for a very long time.\u201d</p><p>The desperate father went quite white at this. He closed his eyes, and seemed to sway slightly, giving at the knees.</p><p>\u201cThe Colonies?\u201d he whispered. Then he opened his eyes once more and set his jaw.</p><p>\u201cBetter she should be gone from me forever to a wild place, than to meet dishonor before my eyes.\u201d</p><p>Brianna had no idea what to say to this. She glanced helplessly over the man\u2019s head at the sea of bobbing heads.</p> <p>\u201cEr...your daughter...which one...?\u201d</p><p>The flicker of hope in his eyes sprang into sudden flame, shocking in its intensity.</p><p>\u201cBless ye, lady! I will fetch her to ye directly!\u201d</p><p>He pressed her hand fervently, then darted away into the crowd, leaving her staring after him. After a moment, she shrugged helplessly, and bent to pick up her fallen kerchief. How had this happened? And what in the name of goodness would her uncle and her cousin say, if she\u2014</p><p>\u201cThis is Elizabeth,\u201d a voice announced breathlessly. \u201cDo your duty to the lady, Lizzie.\u201d</p><p>Brianna looked down and found the decision made for her.</p><p>\u201cOh, dear,\u201d she murmured, seeing the neat white parting down the middle of the small head that bent in a deep curtsy before her. \u201cA puppy.\u201d</p><p>The head bobbed upright, presenting her with a thin, starved-looking face, in which scared gray eyes occupied most of the available space.</p> <p>\u201cYour servant, mum,\u201d said the small, white-lipped mouth. Or at least that\u2019s what it looked like it said; the girl spoke so softly, she couldn\u2019t be heard above the surrounding racket.</p><p>\u201cShe will serve ye well, ma\u2019am, aye, indeed she will!\u201d The father\u2019s anxious voice was more audible. She glanced at him; there was a strong resemblance between father and daughter, both with the same flyaway fair hair, the same thin, anxious faces. They were nearly the same height, though the girl was so frail, she seemed like her father\u2019s shadow.</p><p>\u201cEr...hello.\u201d She smiled at the girl, trying to seem reassuring. The girl\u2019s head tilted fearfully back, looking up. She swallowed visibly, and licked her lips.</p><p>\u201cAh...how old are you, Lizzie? May I call you Lizzie?\u201d</p><p>The small head bobbed on a neck that looked like a wild mushroom\u2019s stalk; long, colorless, and infinitely fragile. The girl whispered something that Brianna didn\u2019t catch; she looked at the father, who answered eagerly.</p><p>\u201cFourteen, ma\u2019am. But she\u2019s a rare hand with cooking and sewing, clean in her person and ye\u2019ll never find a soul more biddable and willing!\u201d</p><p>He stood behind his daughter, hands on her shoulders, gripped tight enough to show his knuckles white. His eyes met Brianna\u2019s. They were pale blue, pleading. His lips moved\u2014without sound, but she heard him clearly.</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d he said.</p><p>Beyond him, Brianna could see her uncle, who had come into the hall. He was talking to Young Jamie, smooth head and curly bent together in close conversation. In a moment they would be looking for her.</p><p>She took a deep breath and drew herself up to her full height. Well, and if you came right down to it, she thought, she was as much a Fraser as her cousin. Let them find out just how stubborn a rock could be.</p><p>She smiled at the girl and held out a hand, offering the second, uneaten bridie.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a bargain, Lizzie. Will you have a bite to seal it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s eaten my food,\u201d Brianna said, with as much assurance as she could conjure up. \u201cShe\u2019s mine.\u201d</p><p>Rather to her surprise, this statement finally put a stop to the argument. Her cousin looked as though he meant to go on remonstrating, but her uncle put a hand on Young Jamie\u2019s arm to silence him. The look of surprise on Ian\u2019s face turned to a sort of amused respect.</p><p>\u201cHas she, now?\u201d He looked at Lizzie, cowering behind Brianna, and his lips twitched. \u201cMmphm. Well, then, not much more to be said, is there?\u201d</p><p>Young Jamie evidently didn\u2019t share his father\u2019s assessment of this point; he could think of quite a lot more to be said.</p><p>\u201cBut a wee lassie like that\u2014she\u2019s useless!\u201d He waved a dismissive hand at Lizzie, frowning. \u201cWhy, she isna big enough even to carry baggage, let alone\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m big enough to carry my own bags, thanks,\u201d Brianna put in. She lowered her brows and gave her cousin back scowl for scowl, straightening up to emphasize her height.</p><p>He lifted an eyebrow in acknowledgment, but didn\u2019t give up.</p><p>\u201cA woman shouldna be traveling alone\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t be alone, I\u2019ll have Lizzie.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2014and certainly not to a place like America! Why, it\u2019s\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d think it was the ends of the earth to hear you talk, and you haven\u2019t even seen it!\u201d Brianna said in exasperation. \u201cI was born in America, for heaven\u2019s sake!\u201d</p><p>Uncle and cousin gaped at her, identical expressions of shock on their faces. She seized the opportunity to press her advantage.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s my money, and my servant, and my journey. I\u2019ve given my word, and I\u2019ll keep it!\u201d</p><p>Ian rubbed a knuckle across his upper lip, suppressing a grin. He shook his head.</p><p>\u201cThey say it\u2019s a wise bairn that kens its father, but I dinna think there\u2019s much doubt who yours is, lass. Ye might have had the lang nebbit and red locks from anyone, but ye didna get the stubbornness from any man but Jamie Fraser.\u201d</p><p>A self-conscious flush rose to her cheeks, but Brianna felt an odd flutter of something like pleasure.</p><p>His feathers ruffled from the argument, Young Jamie made one last attempt.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s verra unseemly for a woman to be givin\u2019 her opinions sae free, and her with menfolk to look after her,\u201d he said stiffly.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t think women ought to have opinions?\u201d Brianna asked sweetly.</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t!\u201d</p><p>Ian gave his son a long look.</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019ll have been marrit what, eight years?\u201d He shook his head. \u201cAye, well, your Joan\u2019s a tactful woman.\u201d Ignoring Young Jamie\u2019s black look, he turned back to Lizzie.</p><p>\u201cVerra well, then. Go and take farewell of your father, lassie. I\u2019ll see to the papers.\u201d He watched Lizzie scurry away, thin shoulders hunched against the crowd. He shook his head a little doubtfully, and turned back to Brianna.</p><p>\u201cWell, she\u2019ll maybe be better company for ye than a manservant, lass, but your cousin\u2019s right about the one thing\u2014she\u2019ll be no protection. It\u2019ll be you lookin\u2019 out for her, likely.\u201d</p><p>Brianna straightened her shoulders and thrust out her chin, summoning up as much self-confidence as she could, in spite of the sudden hollow feeling that assailed her.</p><p>\u201cI can manage,\u201d she said.</p><p>She kept her hand curled tight, holding on to the stone in her palm. It was something to cling to, as the Moray Firth widened into the sea, and the cradling shore of Scotland fell away to either side.</p><p>Why ought she to feel so strongly for a place she hardly knew? Lizzie, born and raised in Scotland, had spared no glance for the receding land but had gone below at once, to lay claim to their space and arrange the few belongings they had brought aboard.</p><p>Brianna had never thought of herself as Scottish\u2014had not known she was Scottish until quite recently\u2014yet she had scarcely felt more bereft by her mother\u2019s leaving or her father\u2019s death than by this parting from people and places she had known for so short a time.</p><p>Perhaps it was only the contagious emotion of the other passengers. Many of them were standing at the rail as she was, several weeping openly. Or fear of the long journey ahead. But she knew quite well it was none of those things.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s that, I expect.\u201d It was Lizzie, appearing at her elbow after all, to see the last sight of the land fade away. Her small pale face was expressionless, but Brianna didn\u2019t mistake lack of expression for lack of feeling.</p><p>\u201cYes, we\u2019re on our way.\u201d Moved by impulse, Brianna put out a hand and drew the girl to stand in front of her at the rail, sheltered alike from freshening wind and from jostling passengers and seamen. Lizzie was a good foot shorter than Brianna, and fine-boned as the delicate sooty terns that circled the masts, squawking overhead.</p><p>The sun did not really set at this time of year but hung low above the dark hills, and the air had grown quite cold in the Firth. The girl was thinly dressed; she shivered, and pressed quite unselfconsciously against Brianna for warmth. Brianna had a blue woolen arisaid provided by Jenny; she wrapped her arms and the shawl ends around the younger girl, finding as much comfort in the embrace as she gave.</p><p>\u201cIt will be all right,\u201d she said, to herself as much as to Lizzie.</p><p>The pale blond head bobbed briefly under her chin; she couldn\u2019t tell whether it was a nod, or only Lizzie\u2019s attempt to get the wind-whipped strands of hair out of her eyes. Elf-locks snatched from her own thick plait fluttered in the stiff salt breeze, echoing the pull of the huge sails above. Despite her misgivings, she felt her spirits start to rise with the wind. She had survived a good many partings so far; she would survive this. That was what made this leaving hard, she thought. She had already lost father, mother, lover, home, and friends. She was alone by necessity, and also by choice. But then to find both home and family again so unexpectedly at Lallybroch had caught her unaware. She would have given almost anything to stay\u2014just a little longer. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>But there were promises to keep, losses to be made good. Then she could come back. To Scotland. And to Roger.</p><p>She shifted her arm, feeling his thin silver band warm on her wrist under the shawl, the metal heated by her own flesh. Un peu...beaucoup...Her other hand gripped the cloth together, exposed to the wind and damp with sea spray. If it hadn\u2019t been so cold, she might not have noticed the sudden warmth of the drop that fell on the back of her hand.</p><p>Lizzie stood stiff as a stick, her arms hugged tight around herself. Her ears were large and transparent, her hair fine and thin, sleek to her skull. Her ears poked out like a mouse\u2019s, tender and fragile in the soft deep light of the low night sun.</p><p>Brianna reached up and wiped away the tears by touch. Her own eyes were dry, and her mouth set firm as she looked out at the land over Lizzie\u2019s head, but the cold face and quivering lips against her hand might as well have been her own.</p> <p>They stood for some time silently, until the last of the land was gone.</p><p>36</p><p>YOU CAN\u2019T GO HOME AGAIN</p><p>Inverness, July 1769</p><p>Roger walked slowly through the town, looking around him with a mixture of fascination and delight. Inverness had changed a bit in two hundred-odd years, no doubt of it, and yet it was recognizably the same town; a good deal smaller, to be sure, with half its muddy streets unpaved, and yet he knew this street he was walking down, had walked down it a hundred times before.</p> <p>It was Huntly Street, and while most of the small shops and buildings were unfamiliar, across the river stood the Old High Church\u2014not so Old, now\u2014its stubby steeple blunt as ever. Surely if he went inside, Mrs. Dunvegan, the minister\u2019s wife, would be setting out flowers in the chancel, ready for the Sunday service. But she wouldn\u2019t\u2014Mrs. Dunvegan hadn\u2019t happened yet, with her thick wool sweaters and the terrible pot pies with which she tormented the sick of her husband\u2019s parish. Yet the small stone kirk stood solid and familiar, in the charge of a stranger.</p><p>His father\u2019s own church wasn\u2019t here; it had been\u2014would be?\u2014built in 1837. Likewise the manse, which had always seemed so elderly and decrepit, had not been built until the early 1900s. He had passed the site on his way; there was nothing there now save a tangle of cinquefoil and sweet broom, and a single small rowan sapling that sprouted from the underbrush, leaves fluttering in the light wind.</p><p>There was the same damp coolness to the air, tingling with freshness\u2014but the overlying stink of motor exhaust was gone, replaced by a distant reek of sewage. The most striking absence was the churches; where both banks of the river would one day sport a noble profusion of steeples and spires, now there was nothing save a scatter of small buildings.</p><p>There was only the one stone footbridge, but the River Ness itself was naturally much the same. The river was low and the same gulls sat in the riffles, squawking companionably to one another as they picked small fish from among the stones just under the water\u2019s surface.</p><p>\u201cLuck to you, mate,\u201d he said to a fat gull who sat on the bridge, and crossed the river into the town.</p><p>Here and there, a gracious residence sat comfortably insulated by its wide grounds, a grand lady spreading her skirts, ignoring the presence of the hoi polloi nearby. There was Mountgerald in the distance, the big house looking precisely as he had always known it, save that the great copper beeches that would in future surround the house had not yet been planted; instead, a row of spindly Italian cypresses leaned dismally against the garden wall, looking homesick for their sunny birthplace.</p> <p>For all its elegance, Mountgerald was reputed to have been built in the oldest of the old ways\u2014with the foundation laid over the body of a human sacrifice. By report, a workman had been lured into the hole of the cellar, and a great stone dropped onto him from the top of the newly built wall, crushing him to death. He had\u2014so local history said\u2014been buried there in the cellar, his blood a propitiation to the hungry spirits of the earth, who thus satisfied, had allowed the edifice to stand prosperous and untroubled through the years.</p><p>The house could be no more than twenty or thirty years old now, Roger thought. There might easily be people in the town who had worked on its building; who knew exactly what had happened in that cellar, to whom, and why.</p><p>But he had other things to do; Mountgerald and its ghost would have to keep their secrets. With a mild pang of regret, he left the big house behind, and turned his scholar\u2019s nose into the road that led to the docks downriver.</p><p>With a feeling of what could only be called d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, he pushed open the door of a pub. The half-timbered entry, with its stone flags, was as he had seen it a week before\u2014and two hundred years hence\u2014and the familiar smell of hops and yeast in the air was a comfort to his spirit. The name had changed, but not the smell of beer.</p><p>Roger took a deep gulp from his wooden cup and nearly choked. \u201cAll right, man?\u201d The barman paused, a bucket of sand in his hand, to peer at Roger.</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d Roger said hoarsely. \u201cJust fine.\u201d</p><p>The barman nodded and went back to scattering sand, but kept a practiced eye on Roger in case he looked like vomiting on the freshly swept and sanded floor.</p><p>Roger coughed and cleared his throat, then essayed a further cautious sip. The flavor was fine; very good, in fact. It was the alcohol content that was unexpected; this stuff packed a wallop far greater than any modern beer Roger had ever encountered. Claire had said that alcoholism was endemic to the time, and Roger could easily see why. Still, if drunkenness were the greatest hazard he faced, he could deal with that.</p> <p>He sat quietly by the hearth and drank, savoring the dark, bitter brew as he watched and listened.</p><p>It was a port pub, and a busy one. So near the docks on the Moray Firth, it hosted sea captains and merchants, as well as sailors from the ships in port and longshoremen and laborers from the nearby warehouses. A great deal of business of one kind and another was being transacted over the beer-stained surfaces of its many small tables.</p><p>With half an ear Roger could hear a contract being arranged for the shipping of three hundred bolts of cheap drugget cloth from Aberdeen, bound for the Colonies, with an exchange to be made for a cargo of rice and indigo from the Carolinas. A hundred head of Galloway cattle, six hundred-weight of rolled copper, casks of sulfur, molasses, and wine. Quantities and prices, delivery dates and conditions floated through the babble and beer fumes of the pub like the thick blue clouds of tobacco smoke that floated near the low ceiling-beams.</p><p>Not only goods were being bargained for. In one corner sat a ship\u2019s captain, marked by the cut of his long, full-skirted coat and the fine black tricorne that lay on the table by his elbow. He was attended by a clerk, a ledger and a money box on the table before him, interviewing a steady stream of people, emigrants seeking passage to the Colonies for themselves and their families.</p><p>Roger watched the proceedings covertly. The ship was bound for Virginia, and after listening for some time he deduced that the cost of passage for a male passenger\u2014for a gentleman, that is\u2014was ten pounds, eight shillings. Those willing to travel in the steerage, packed like casks and cattle in the lower holds, might ship aboard for four pounds, two shillings each, bringing their own food for a six-weeks voyage. Fresh water, he gathered, was provided.</p><p>For those desiring passage but lacking funds, there were other means available.</p><p>\u201cIndenturement for yourself, your wife, and your two elder sons?\u201d The captain tilted his head appraisingly, looking over the family that stood before him. A small, wiry man, who might be in his early thirties but looked much older, shabby and bowed with labor. His wife, perhaps a little younger, standing behind her husband, eyes glued to the floor, tightly grasping the hands of two little girls. One of the girls held on to her baby brother, a lad of three or four. The elder boys stood by their father, trying to look manly. Roger thought they might be ten and twelve, allowing for the puny stature caused by malnutrition.</p><p>\u201cYourself and the boys, aye, that\u2019ll do,\u201d the captain said. He frowned at the woman, who didn\u2019t look up. \u201cNo one will buy a woman with so many young ones\u2014she might keep one, perhaps. You\u2019ll have to sell the girls, though.\u201d</p><p>The man glanced back at his family. His wife kept her head down, unmoving, not looking at anything. One of the girls twitched and jerked, though, complaining in an undertone that her hand was being crushed. The man turned back.</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d he said, low-voiced. \u201cCan they\u2014might they\u2014go together?\u201d</p><p>The captain rubbed a hand across his mouth, and nodded indifferently.</p><p>\u201cLikely enough.\u201d</p><p>Roger didn\u2019t wait to witness the details of the transaction. He got up abruptly and left the pub; the dark beer had lost its taste.</p><p>He paused in the street outside, fingering the coins in his pocket. It was all he had been able to collect of suitable money, in the time he\u2019d had. He had thought that it would be enough, though; he was good-sized and had a fair amount of confidence in his own abilities. Still, the little scene he had witnessed in the pub had shaken him.</p><p>He had grown up with the history of the Highlands. He knew well enough the sorts of things that drove families to such a pitch of desperation that they would accept permanent separation and semislavery as the price of survival.</p><p>He knew all about the sale of lands that forced small crofters off the lands their families had tended for hundreds of years, all about the dreadful conditions of penury and starvation in the cities, the simple insupportableness of life in Scotland in these days. And not all his years of reading and study had prepared him for the look of that woman\u2019s face, her eyes fixed on the fresh-sanded floor, her daughters\u2019 hands clutched hard in her own.</p><p>Ten pounds, eight shillings. Or four pounds, two. Plus whatever it might cost for food. He had exactly fourteen shillings, threepence in his pocket, together with a handful of copper doits and a couple of farthings.</p><p>He walked slowly down the lane that led along the seaside, glancing at the collection of ships that lay moored by the wooden docks. Fishing ketches, for the most part, small galleys and brigs that plied their trade up and down the Firth, or at most ran across the Channel, carrying cargo and passengers to France. Only three large ships lay at anchor in the Firth, those of a size to brave the winds of the Atlantic crossing.</p><p>He could cross to France, of course, and take ship from there. Or travel overland to Edinburgh, a much larger port than Inverness. But it would be late in the year then, for sailing. Brianna was six weeks before him already; he could waste no time in finding her\u2014God knew what could happen to a woman alone here.</p><p>Four pounds, two shillings. Well, he could work, certainly. With neither children nor wife to support, he could save most of his earnings. But given that the average clerk earned something like twelve pounds per year, and that he was much more likely to find work shoveling stables than keeping accounts, the chances of his saving up passage money in any reasonable time were fairly slim.</p><p>\u201cFirst things first,\u201d he muttered. \u201cBe sure where she\u2019s gone, before you trouble about getting there yourself.\u201d</p><p>Taking his hand out of his pocket, he turned right between two warehouses, and into a narrow lane. His high spirits of the morning had largely evaporated, but they lifted slightly, nonetheless, when he saw that he had been right in his guess; the harbormaster\u2019s office was where he had known it must be\u2014in the same squat stone building where it still would be, two hundred years hence. Roger smiled with wry humor; Scots were not inclined to make changes purely for the sake of change. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>It was crowded and busy inside, with four harried clerks behind a battered wooden counter, scribbling and stamping, carrying bundles of paper to and fro, taking money and conveying it carefully into an inner office, from which they issued moments later, bearing receipts on japanned tin trays.</p><p>A crush of impatient men pressed against the counter, each endeavoring to signal by means of voice and posture that his business was much more urgent than that of the fellow standing next him. Once Roger had succeeded in capturing the attention of one of the clerks, though, there turned out to be no great difficulty in seeing the registers of the ships that had sailed from Inverness within the last few months.</p><p>\u201cHere, wait,\u201d he said to the young man who pushed a large, leather-bound book across the counter to him.</p><p>\u201cAye?\u201d The clerk was flushed with hurry, and had a smut of ink on his nose, but paused politely, arrested in flight.</p> <p>\u201cHow much d\u2019ye get paid for working here?\u201d Roger asked.</p><p>The clerk\u2019s fair eyebrows lifted, but he was in too much hurry either to ask questions or to take offense at the inquiry.</p><p>\u201cSix shillings the week,\u201d he said briefly, and promptly disappeared in response to an irritable shout of \u201cMunro!\u201d from the office beyond the counter.</p><p>\u201cMmphm.\u201d Roger pushed back through the crowd and took the book of registers away to a small table by the window, out of the main stream of traffic.</p><p>Having seen the conditions under which the clerks worked, Roger was impressed at the legibility of the handwritten registers. He was well accustomed to archaic spelling and eccentric punctuation, though those he was used to seeing were always yellowed and fragile, on the verge of disintegration. It gave him an odd little historian\u2019s thrill to see the page before him fresh and white, and just beyond, the clerk who sat at a high table, copying as fast as quill could write, shoulders hunched against the hubbub in the room.</p> <p>You\u2019re shilly-shallying, said a cold little voice in the middle of his brain. She\u2019s here or she\u2019s not; being afraid to look won\u2019t change it. Get on!</p><p>Roger took a deep breath and flipped open the big ledger book. The ships\u2019 names were neatly lettered at the tops of pages, followed by the names of their masters and mates, their main cargoes and dates of sailing. Arianna. Polyphemus. Merry Widow. Tiburon. Despite his apprehensions, he couldn\u2019t help admiring the names of the ships as he thumbed through the pages.</p><p>Half an hour later, he had ceased to marvel over both poetry and picturesqueness, barely noting each ship\u2019s name as he ran his finger down the pages in increasing desperation. Not here, she wasn\u2019t here!</p><p>But she had to be, he argued with himself. She had to have taken a ship to the Colonies, where else could she bloody be? Unless she hadn\u2019t found the notice, after all...but the sick feeling under his ribs assured him that she had; nothing else would have made her risk the stones.</p><p>He took a deep breath and closed his eyes, which were starting to feel the strain of the handwritten pages. Then he opened his eyes, turned back to the first relevant register, and began to read again, doggedly muttering each name beneath his breath, to be sure of not missing one out.</p><p>Mr. Phineas Forbes, gentleman.</p> <p>Mrs. Wilhelmina Forbes.</p><p>Master Joshua Forbes.</p><p>Mrs. Josephine Forbes.</p><p>Mrs. Eglantine Forbes.</p><p>Mrs. Charlotte Forbes...</p><p>He smiled to himself at the thought of Mr. Phineas Forbes, surrounded by his womenfolk. Even knowing that \u201cMrs.\u201d here was sometimes merely the abbreviated form of \u201cMistress,\u201d and thus used for both married and unmarried women\u2014rather than the \u201cMiss\u201d for little girls\u2014he found himself with an irresistible mental picture of Phineas marching stoutly aboard at the head of a train of four wives, Master Joshua no doubt bringing up the rear.</p><p>Mr. William Talbot, merchant.</p><p>Mr. Peter Talbot, merchant.</p> <p>Mr. Jonathan Bicknell, physician.</p><p>Mr. Robert MacLeod, farmer.</p><p>Mr. Gordon MacLeod, farmer.</p><p>Mr. Martin MacLeod...</p><p>No Randalls this time through, either. Not for the Persephone, the Queen\u2019s Revenge, or the Phoebe. He rubbed his aching eyes, and began on the register of the Phillip Alonzo. A Spanish name, but it was listed under Scottish registry. Sailing from Inverness, under the command of Captain Patrick O\u2019Brian.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t given up, but had already begun to think what to do next, if she should not be listed in the registers. Lallybroch, of course. He had been there once, in his own time, to the abandoned remains of the estate; could he find it now, without the guidance of roads and signposts?</p><p>His thoughts stopped with a jolt as his gliding finger came to a halt, near the bottom of a page. Not Brianna Randall, not the name he\u2019d been looking for, but a name that rang bells of recognition in his mind. Fraser, read the slanted, crisp black writing. Mr. Brian Fraser. No, not Brian. And not Mr., either. He bent closer, squinting at the cramped black lettering.</p><p>He closed his eyes, feeling his heart thump hard in his chest, and relief flowed through him, intoxicating as the pub\u2019s special dark beer. Mrs., not Mr. And what had first seemed merely an exuberant tail on the \u201cn\u201d of Brian was on closer inspection almost surely instead a careless \u201ca.\u201d</p><p>Her, it was her, it had to be! It was an unusual first name\u2014he had seen no other Briannas or Brianas anywhere in the massive register. And even Fraser made sense, of a sort; embarked on a quixotic quest to find her father, she had taken his name, the name she was entitled to by right of birth.</p><p>He slammed the register closed, as though to keep her from escaping from the pages, and sat for a moment, breathing. Got her! He saw the fairhaired clerk eyeing him curiously from the counter and, flushing, opened the book again.</p><p>The Phillip Alonzo. Sailed from Inverness on the fourth of July, Anno Domini 1769. For Charleston, South Carolina.</p><p>He frowned at the name, suddenly uncertain. South Carolina. Was that her real destination, or only as close as she could get? A quick glance at the rest of the registers showed no ships in July for North Carolina. Perhaps she had simply taken the first ship for the southern colonies, intending to journey overland.</p><p>Or maybe he was wrong. A chill gripped him that had nothing to do with the river wind seeping through the cracks of the window next to him. He looked at the page again, and was reassured. No, there was no profession given, as there was for all the men. It was certainly \u201cMrs.\u201d and therefore it must be \u201cBriana\u201d as well. And if \u201cBriana\u201d it was, then Brianna it was, too, he knew it.</p><p>He rose and handed the book across the counter to his fair-haired acquaintance.</p><p>\u201cThanks, man,\u201d he said, relaxing into his own soft accent. \u201cCan ye be tellin\u2019 me, is there a ship in port bound for the American Colonies soon, now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, aye,\u201d the clerk said, deftly stowing the register with one hand and accepting a bill of lading from a customer with the other. \u201cHappen it will be Gloriana; she sails day after tomorrow for the Carolinas.\u201d He looked Roger up and down. \u201cEmigrant or seaman?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cSeaman,\u201d Roger said promptly. Ignoring the other\u2019s raised eyebrow, he waved toward the forest of masts visible through the paned windows. \u201cWhere do I go to sign on?\u201d</p><p>Both eyebrows high, the clerk nodded in the direction of the door.</p><p>\u201cHer master works from the Friars when he\u2019s in port. Likely he\u2019ll be there now\u2014Captain Bonnet.\u201d He forbore adding what was obvious from his skeptical expression; if Roger was a seaman, he, the clerk, was an African parrot.</p><p>\u201cRight, mo ghille. Thanks.\u201d Sketching a salute, Roger turned away, but turned back at the door to find the clerk still watching him, ignoring the press of impatient customers.</p><p>\u201cWish me luck!\u201d Roger called, with a grin.</p><p>The clerk\u2019s answering grin was tinged with something that might have been either admiration or wistfulness.</p><p>\u201cLuck to ye, man!\u201d he called, and waved in farewell. By the time the door swung shut, he was deep in conversation with the next customer, quill pen poised in readiness.</p><p>He found Captain Bonnet in the pub, as advertised, settled in a corner under a thick blue haze of smoke, to which the Captain\u2019s own cigar was adding.</p><p>\u201cYour name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMacKenzie,\u201d Roger said on sudden impulse. If Brianna could do it, so could he.</p><p>\u201cMacKenzie. Any experience, Mr. MacKenzie?\u201d</p><p>A bar of sunlight cut across the Captain\u2019s face, making him squint. Bonnet drew back into the shadow of the settle, and the lines around his eyes relaxed, leaving Roger exposed to a gaze of uncomfortable penetration.</p><p>\u201cIt is myself has fished the herring now and then, in the Minch.\u201d</p><p>It was no lie, at that; he\u2019d had several teenage summers as hand on a herring boat captained by an acquaintance of the Reverend\u2019s. The experience had left him with a useful layer of muscle, an ear for the singsong cadence of the Isles, and a fixed dislike of herring. But he knew the feel of a rope in his hands, at least.</p><p>\u201cAh, ye\u2019re a good-sized lad. But a fisherman will not be the same as a sailor, sure.\u201d The man\u2019s soft Irish lilt left it open whether this was question, statement\u2014or provocation.</p><p>\u201cI shouldna have thought it an occupation requiring great skill.\u201d For no reason he could name, Captain Bonnet raised the hairs on the back of his neck.</p><p>The green eyes sharpened.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps more than ye think\u2014but sure it\u2019s nothing a willing man can\u2019t learn. But what would it be, now, that makes a fellow of your sort crave the sea of a sudden?\u201d</p><p>The eyes flickered in the tavern\u2019s shadows, taking him in. Of your sort. What was it? Roger wondered. Not his speech\u2014he had taken care to suppress any hint of the Oxford scholar, by taking on the \u201cteuchter\u201d cant of the Isles. Was he too well dressed for a would-be sailor? Or was it the singed collar and the burn mark on the breast of his coat?</p><p>\u201cThat will be none of your business, I am thinking,\u201d he answered evenly. With a minor effort, he kept his hands relaxed at his sides.</p><p>The pale green eyes studied him dispassionately, unblinking. Like a leopard watching a passing wildebeest, Roger thought, wondering whether it would be worth the chase.</p><p>The heavy lids dropped; not worth it\u2014for the moment.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be aboard by sundown,\u201d Bonnet said. \u201cFive shillings the month, meat three days in the week, plum duff on Sundays. You\u2019ll have a hammock, but find your own clothes. You will be free to leave the ship once the cargo is unloaded, not until that time. We are agreed, sir?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is agreed,\u201d Roger said, suddenly dry-mouthed. He would have given a lot for a pint, but not now, not here, under that pale green gaze.</p><p>\u201cAsk for Mr. Dixon when yez come aboard. He\u2019s paymaster.\u201d Bonnet leaned back, took a small leather-bound book from his pocket and flipped it open. Audience concluded.</p><p>Roger turned smartly and went out, without a backward glance. There was a small cold spot at the base of his skull. If he looked back, he knew, he would see that lucent green gaze fixed unwaveringly over the edge of the unread book, taking note of every weakness.</p><p>The cold spot, he thought, was where the teeth would meet.</p><p>37 </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>GLORIANA</p><p>Before shipping with the Gloriana, Roger had assumed himself to be in reasonably good condition. In fact, compared to most of the obviously malnourished and wizened specimens of humanity who constituted the rest of the crew, he considered himself well endowed, indeed. It took precisely fourteen hours\u2014the length of one day\u2019s work\u2014to disabuse him of this notion.</p><p>Blisters he had bargained for, and sore muscles; heaving crates, lifting spars, and hauling ropes was familiar labor, though he hadn\u2019t done it for some time.</p><p>What he had forgotten was the bone-deep fatigue that sprang as much from the constant chill of damp clothes as from the work. He welcomed the heavy labor in the cargo hold, because it warmed him temporarily, even though he knew the warmth would be succeeded by a fine, constant shiver as soon as he emerged on deck, where the wind could resume its icy probe of his sweat-soaked clothes.</p> <p>Hands roughened and scraped by wet hemp were painful, but expected; by the end of his first day, his palms were black with tar, and the skin of his fingers cracked and bled at the joints, scraped raw. But the gnawing ache of hunger had been something of a surprise. He hadn\u2019t thought it possible to be as hungry as he was.</p><p>The knobbled lump of humanity working beside him\u2014one Duff by name\u2014was similarly damp, but seemed unfazed by the condition. The long, pointed nose that quested, ferret-like, from the upturned collar of a ragged jacket was blue at the tip and dripped regularly as a stalactite, but the pale eyes were sharp and the mouth beneath grinned wide, displaying teeth the color of the water in the Firth.</p><p>\u201cTake hairt, man. Grub in twa bells.\u201d Duff gave him a companionable elbow in the ribs and disappeared nimbly down a hatchway, from whose cavernous recesses echoed blasphemous shouts and loud bangings.</p><p>Roger resumed his unloading of the cargo net, heartened indeed at the prospect of supper.</p><p>The after hold had already been half filled. The water casks were loaded; tier upon tier of wooden hogsheads, squatting in the shadowy gloom, each hundred-gallon cask weighing more than seven hundred pounds. But the forward hold still gaped empty, and a constant procession of loaders and quaymen streamed like ants across the dock, piling up such a heap of boxes and barrels, rolls and bundles, that it seemed inconceivable that the mass should ever be condensed sufficiently to fit within the ship.</p> <p>It took two days to finish the loading: barrels of salt, bolts of cloth, huge crates of ironmongery that had to be lowered with rope slings because of their weight. It was here that Roger\u2019s size proved of benefit. At the end of a rope belayed round the capstan, he leaned back against the weight of a crate suspended at the other end and, muscles popping with the strain, lowered it slowly enough that the two men below could catch and guide it into place in the increasingly crowded hold.</p><p>The passengers came aboard in the late afternoon, a straggling line of emigrants, burdened with bags, bundles, caged chickens, and children. These were the cargo of the steerage\u2014a space created by erection of a bulk-head across the forward hold\u2014and as profitable in their way as the harder goods aft.</p><p>\u201cBondsmen and redemptioners,\u201d Duff had told him, looking over the incomers with a practiced eye. \u201cWorth fifteen pund each on the hoof in the plantations, weans three or four. Bairns at the teat go free wi\u2019 their mithers.\u201d</p><p>The seaman coughed, a deep, rattling noise like an ancient motor starting up, and hawked a glob of phlegm, narrowly missing the side rail as he spat. He shook his head as he looked the shuffling line over.</p><p>\u201cHappen some can pay their way, but no many in this lot. They\u2019ll have had a job to come up wi\u2019 twa pund a family for their feed on the voyage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Captain doesn\u2019t feed them, then?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, aye.\u201d Duff rumbled in his chest again, coughed and spat. \u201cFor a price.\u201d He grinned at Roger, wiped his mouth, and jerked his head toward the gangplank. \u201cGo and lend a hand, laddie. We wouldna want the Captain\u2019s profit to be fallin\u2019 intae the water, now, would we?\u201d</p><p>Surprised by the padded feel of a little girl as he swung her aboard, Roger looked closer and saw that the stout build of many of the women was illusion, occasioned by their wearing several layers of clothes; all they owned in the world, apparently, beyond small bundles of personal possessions, boxes of food put by for the journey\u2014and the scrawny children for whose sake they took this desperate step.</p><p>Roger squatted, smiling at a reluctant toddler who clung to his mother\u2019s skirts. He was no more than two, still in smocks, with a riot of soft blond curls, his fat little mouth drawn down in fearful disapproval of everything around him.</p><p>\u201cCome on, man,\u201d Roger said softly, putting out a hand in invitation. It was no longer an effort to control his accent; his usual clipped Oxbridge had elided to the gentler Highland speech with which he had grown up, and he used it now without conscious thought. \u201cYour Mam can\u2019t be pickin\u2019 ye up now; you come with me.\u201d</p><p>Grossly mistrustful, the boy snuffled and glowered at him, but suffered him to peel the grubby little fingers away from his mother\u2019s skirts. Roger carried the little boy across the deck, the woman following him silently. She looked up at him as he handed her down the ladder, her eyes fixed on his; her face disappeared in the darkness like a white rock dropped down a well, and he turned away with a feeling of unease, as though he had abandoned someone to drowning.</p><p>As he turned back to his work, he saw a young woman, just coming down above the quay. She was the sort of girl called \u201cbonny\u201d\u2014not beautiful, but lively and nicely made, with something about her that took the eye.</p><p>Perhaps it was only her posture; straight as a lily stem among the hunched and drooping backs around her. Or her face, which showed apprehension and uncertainty, but had still about it the brightness of curiosity. A darer, that one, he thought, and his heart\u2014oppressed by so many downcast faces among the emigrants\u2014lightened at the sight of her.</p><p>She hesitated at sight of the ship and the crowd around it. A tall fair-haired young man was with her, a baby in his arms. He touched her shoulder in reassurance, and she glanced up at him, an answering smile lighting her face like the striking of a match. Watching them, Roger felt a mild pang of something that might have been envy.</p> <p>\u201cYou, MacKenzie!\u201d The bosun\u2019s shout pulled him from his contemplation. The bosun jerked his head aft. \u201cThere\u2019s cargo a-waitin\u2019\u2014it\u2019s no goin\u2019 to walk aboard by itself!\u201d</p><p>Once embarked and under sail, the voyage went smoothly for some weeks. The stormy weather that accompanied their exodus from Scotland quickly diminished into good winds and rolling seas, and while the immediate effect of this on the passengers was to make the majority of them seasick, this ailment also faded in time. The smell of vomit from the steerage subsided, becoming only a minor note in the symphony of stinks aboard the Gloriana.</p><p>Roger had been born with an acute sense of smell, an attribute he was finding a marked liability in close quarters. Still, even the keenest nose grew accustomed in time, and within a day or so he had ceased to note any but the most novel stenches.</p><p>He was fortunately not subject to seasickness himself, though his experiences with the herring fishers had been enough to give him a keen appreciation of the weather, with the sailor\u2019s unsettling knowledge that his life might depend on whether the sun was shining that day.</p><p>His new shipmates were not friendly, but neither were they hostile. Whether it was his \u201cteuchter\u201d accent from the Isles\u2014for most of the Gloriana\u2019s hands were English-speakers from Dingwall or Peterhead\u2014the occasional odd things that he said, or simply his size, they regarded him with a certain watchful distance. No overt antagonism\u2014his size prevented that\u2014but distance nonetheless.</p><p>Roger wasn\u2019t disturbed by the coolness. He was pleased enough to be left to his thoughts, his mind ranging free while his body dealt with the daily round of shipboard duties. There was plenty to think about.</p><p>He had taken no heed to the reputation of the Gloriana or her captain before signing on; he would have sailed with Captain Ahab, provided only that that gentleman was bound for North Carolina. Still, from the talk he heard among the crew, he gathered that Stephen Bonnet was known as a good captain; hard but fair, and a man whose voyages always turned a profit. To the seamen, many of whom sailed on shares rather than wages, this latter quality plainly more than compensated for any small defects of character or address.</p><p>Not that Roger had seen open evidence of such defects. But he did see that Bonnet stood always as though an invisible circle had been drawn around him, a circle that few were bold enough to enter. Only the first mate and the bosun spoke directly to the Captain; the crewmen kept their heads down as he passed. Roger remembered the cool green leopard-eyes that had looked him over; little wonder that no one wanted to attract their notice.</p><p>He was more interested in the passengers, though, than in either crew or captain. Little was seen of them normally, but they were allowed on deck briefly twice each day, to take a bit of air, to empty their slop jars over the side\u2014for the ship\u2019s heads were woefully inadequate for so many\u2014and to carry down again the small amounts of water carefully rationed to each family. Roger looked forward to these brief appearances, and tried to see to it that he was employed as often as possible near the end of the deck where they took their fleeting exercise.</p><p>His interest was both professional and personal; his historian\u2019s instincts were roused by their presence, and his loneliness soothed by the homeliness of their talk. Here were the seeds of the new country, the legacy of the old. What these poor emigrants knew and valued, was what would endure to be passed on.</p><p>If one were handpicking the repository of Scottish culture, he thought, it might not contain such things as the recipe for warts about which an elderly woman was berating her long-suffering daughter-in-law (\u201cI did tell ye, Katie Mac, and why ye chose tae leave my nice dried toadie behind, when ye could find room to bring all yon rubbish that we be squattin\u2019 on and pickin\u2019 oot from under our hurdies day and night...\u201d), but that would last too, right along with the folksongs and prayers, with the woven wool and the Celtic patterns of their art.</p><p>He glanced at his own hand; he vividly remembered Mrs. Graham rubbing a large wart on his third finger with what she said was a dried toad. He grinned, rubbing a thumb across the spot. Must have worked; he\u2019d never had another.</p><p>\u201cSir,\u201d said a small voice by his side. \u201cSir, may we go and touch the iron?\u201d</p><p>He glanced down and smiled at the tiny girl, holding two tinier brothers by their hands.</p><p>\u201cAye, a leannan,\u201d he said. \u201cGet on; yourself will be minding the men, though.\u201d</p><p>She nodded and the three of them pattered off, looking anxiously up and down to be sure they were not in the way, before scrambling up to touch the horseshoe nailed to the mast for luck. Iron was protection and healing; the mothers often sent the little ones who were ailing to touch it.</p><p>They could have used iron to better effect internally, Roger thought, seeing the rash on the pasty white faces, and hearing the high-pitched complaints of itching boils, of loose teeth and fever. He resumed his job, measuring out water by the dipperful into the buckets and dishes the emigrants held out to him. They were living on oatmeal, the lot of them\u2014that, with dried peas now and then and a bit of hard biscuit, was the sum total of the \u201cprovisions\u201d supplied them for the voyage. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>At that, he\u2019d heard no complaint; the water was clean, the biscuit was not moldy, and if the allowance of \u201ccorn\u201d was not generous, neither was it niggardly. The crew was fed better, but still on meat and starch, with only the occasional onion for relief. He ran his tongue round his teeth, testing, as he did every few days. The faint taste of iron was nearly always in his mouth now; his gums were beginning to bleed from the lack of fresh vegetables.</p><p>Still, his teeth were strongly rooted, and he had no sign of the swollen joints or bruised nails that several of the other crewmen showed. He\u2019d looked it up, during his weeks of waiting; a normal adult male in good health should be able to endure from three to six months of prolonged vitamin deficiency before suffering any real symptoms. If the good weather held, they\u2019d be across in only two.</p><p>\u201cIt will be good weather tomorrow, aye?\u201d His attention recalled by this apparent reading of his thoughts, he looked down to find that it was the bonny brown-haired girl he\u2019d admired on the quay in Inverness. Morag, her friends called her.</p><p>\u201cI am hoping it may be,\u201d he said, taking her bucket with an answering smile. \u201cWhy do ye say so?\u201d</p> <p>She nodded, pointing over his shoulder with a small sharp chin. \u201cThere\u2019s the new moon in the arms o\u2019 the old; if that means fine weather on the land, I should think it is the same on the sea, no?\u201d</p><p>He glanced back to see the pale clean curve of a silver moon, holding a glowing orb in its cup. It rode high and perfect in an endless evening sky of pale violet, its reflection swallowed by the indigo sea.</p><p>\u201cDinna be wasting time chattering, lass\u2014go on and ask him!\u201d He turned back in time to hear this hissed over Morag\u2019s shoulder by the middle-aged woman behind her. Morag glared back.</p><p>\u201cWill ye hush?\u201d she hissed back. \u201cI\u2019ll not, I said I won\u2019t!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYe\u2019re a stubborn lass, Morag,\u201d the older woman declared, stepping boldly forward, \u201cand if ye willna be asking for yourself, I shall do it for ye!\u201d</p> <p>The good-lady laid a broad hand on Roger\u2019s arm and gave him a charming smile.</p><p>\u201cAnd what might your name be, lad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMacKenzie, ma\u2019am,\u201d Roger said respectfully, holding back a smile.</p><p>\u201cAh, MacKenzie, is it! Well, there, ye see, Morag, and belike he\u2019ll be some kinsman of your man\u2019s, and happy to do ye a service, at that!\u201d The woman turned triumphantly to the girl, then swung back to let Roger have the full force of her personality.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s suckling a wean, and dyin\u2019 o\u2019 thirst in the doin\u2019 of it. A woman needs to drink when she\u2019s giving suck, or her milk dries; everyone kens that weel enough. But the silly lass cannae bring herself to ask ye for a bittie more water. There\u2019s nane here grudge it to her\u2014is there?\u201d she demanded rhetorically, turning round to glare at the other women in line. Not surprisingly, all the heads shook back and forth like clockwork toys.</p><p>It was getting dark, but Morag\u2019s face was visibly pink. Lips pressed tight together, she accepted the brimming bucket of water with a brief bob of her head.</p> <p>\u201cI thank ye, Mr. MacKenzie,\u201d she murmured. She didn\u2019t look up until she had reached the hatchway\u2014but then she stopped, and looked back over her shoulder at him, with a smile of such gratitude that he felt himself grow warm, in spite of the sharp evening wind that blew through his shirt and jacket.</p><p>He was sorry to see the water line finish and the emigrants go below, the hatch battened down over them for the night watches. He knew they told stories and sang songs to pass the time, and would have given much to hear them. Not only from curiosity, but from longing\u2014what moved him was neither pity for their poverty nor thought of their uncertain future; it was envy of the sense of connection among them.</p><p>But the Captain, the crew, the passengers, even the all-important weather, occupied no more than a fragment of Roger\u2019s thoughts. What he thought about, day and night, wet or dry, hungry or fed, was Brianna.</p><p>He went down to the mess when the signal came for supper, and ate without much noticing the contents of his trencher. His was the second watch; he went to his hammock after eating, choosing solitude and rest over the possibility of companionship on the forecastle.</p><p>Solitude was an illusion, of course. Swinging gently in his hammock, he could feel each twitch and turn of the man next to him, the sweating heat of sleeping flesh clammy against his own through the thick cotton mesh. Each man had eighteen inches of sleeping space to call his own, and Roger was uncomfortably aware that when he lay upon his back, his shoulders exceeded that allowance by a good two inches on either side.</p><p>After two nights of sleep interrupted by the bumps and muttered insults of his shipmates, he had swapped places and ended in the space next the bulkhead, where he would have only one companion to discommode. He learned to lie on one side, his face an inch or two from the wooden partition, back turned to his companions, and tune his ears to the sounds of the ship, blocking out the noises of the men around him.</p><p>A very musical thing was a ship\u2014lines and hawsers singing in the wind, the timber knees creaking with each rise and fall, the faint thumps and murmurs on the far side of the bulkhead, in the dark recesses of the passengers\u2019 hold in the steerage. He stared at the dark wood, lit by the shadows of the swinging lantern overhead, and began to re-create her, the lines of face and hair and body all vivid in the dark. Too vivid.</p><p>He could conjure her face without difficulty. What lay behind it was a good deal harder.</p> <p>Rest was also an illusion. When she had gone through the stones, she had taken with her all peace of mind. He lived in a mixture of fear and anger, spiced with the hurt of betrayal, rubbed like pepper into the wounds. The same questions ran round and round inside his mind without answers, a snake chasing its tail.</p><p>Why had she gone?</p><p>What was she doing?</p><p>Why didn\u2019t she tell him?</p><p>It was the effort to come up with an answer to the first of these that kept him going over and over it, as though the answer might afford him the key to the whole mystery of Brianna.</p><p>Yeah, he\u2019d been lonely. Knew bloody well what it felt like to have no one in the world who belonged to you, or you to them. But surely that was one reason why they had reached out to each other\u2014he and Brianna.</p><p>Claire knew, too, he thought suddenly. She\u2019d been orphaned, lost her uncle\u2014of course, she\u2019d been married then. But she\u2019d been separated from her husband during the war...yes, she knew a lot about being alone. And that was why she\u2019d taken care not to leave Bree alone, to assure herself that her daughter was loved.</p><p>Well, he\u2019d tried to love her properly\u2014was still trying, he thought grimly, twisting uncomfortably in his hammock. During the day, the demands of work suppressed the growing needs of his body. At night, though...she was a deal too vivid, the Brianna of his memory.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t hesitated; he\u2019d known from the first moment of realization that he must follow her. Sometimes, though, he was not sure whether he had come to save her or to savage her\u2014anything, so long as it was settled once and for all between them. He\u2019d said he\u2019d wait\u2014but he\u2019d waited long enough.</p><p>The worst of it was not the loneliness, he thought, flinging restlessly over again, but the doubt. Doubt of her feelings, and of his. Panic that he did not truly know her.</p><p>For the first time since his passage through the stones, he realized what she had meant in refusing him, and knew her hesitance for wisdom. But was it wisdom, and not only fear?</p><p>If she had not gone through the stones\u2014would she have turned to him at last, wholeheartedly? Or turned away, always looking for something else?</p><p>It was a leap of faith\u2014to throw one\u2019s heart across a gulf, and trust another to catch it. His own was still in flight across the void, with no certainty of landing. But still in flight.</p><p>The sounds on the other side of the bulkhead had faded to silence, but now they started up again, in a stealthy, rhythmic fashion with which he was thoroughly familiar. They were at it again, whoever they were.</p><p>They did it almost every night, when the others had gone to sleep. At first the sounds had made him feel only his isolation, alone with the burning ghost of Brianna. There seemed no possibility of true human warmth, no joining of heart or mind, no more than the animal consolation of a body to cling to in the dark. Was there really any more for a man than this?</p><p>But then he began to hear something else in the sounds, half-caught words of tenderness, small furtive sounds of affirmation, that made him in some way not a voyeur, but a participant in their joining.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t tell, of course. It might have been any of the couples, or a random pairing of lust\u2014and yet he put faces to them, this unknown pair; in his mind, he saw the tall, fair-haired young man, the brown-haired lass with the open face, saw them look at each other as they had on the quay, and would have sold his soul to know such certainty.</p><p>38</p><p>FOR THOSE IN PERIL ON THE SEA</p><p>A sudden hard squall kept the passengers belowdecks for three days, and the sailors at their posts with no more than scant minutes snatched for rest or food. At the end of it, when the Gloriana rode high on the dying storm-swell and the dawn sky was filled with racing mare\u2019s-tails, Roger staggered down to his hammock, too exhausted even to shuck his wet clothes.</p><p>Crumpled, damp, crusted with salt and feeling fit for nothing but a hot bath and another week\u2019s sleep, he answered the bosun\u2019s whistle for the afternoon watch after four hours rest, and staggered through his duties.</p><p>He was so tired by sunset that his muscles quivered as he helped to heave up a fresh water barrel from the hold. He caved in the top with a hatchet, thinking that he might just manage the exertion of ladling out water rations without falling headfirst into the barrel. Then again, he might not. He splashed a cool handful of the fresh water into his face, in hopes of soothing his burning eyes, and gulped down a whole dipperful, ignoring for once the strictures imposed by that constant contradiction of the sea\u2014always both too much water, and too little.</p><p>The folk bringing up their jars and buckets to be filled looked as though they felt even worse than he did; green-gilled as mushrooms, bruised from being pitched to and fro in the hold like billiard balls, reeking of renewed seasickness and overflowing chamber pots.</p><p>In marked contrast to the general air of pallid malaise, one of his old acquaintances was skipping in rings around him, singing in a monotonous chant that grated on his ears.</p><p>\u201cSeven herrings are a salmon\u2019s fill,</p><p>Seven salmon are a seal\u2019s fill,</p><p>Seven seals are a whale\u2019s fill,</p><p>And seven whales the fill of a Cirein Croin!\u201d</p><p>Bubbling with the freedom of release from the hold, the little girl hopped around like a demented chickadee, making Roger smile in spite of his tiredness. She hopped to the rail, then stood on tiptoe, and peeked cautiously over.</p><p>\u201cD\u2019ye think \u2019twas a Cirein Croin caused the storming, Mr. MacKenzie? Grandda says it was, like enough. They lash their great huge tails about, ye ken,\u201d she informed him. \u201cThat\u2019s what makes the waves go sae big.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI shouldna be thinking such a thing, myself. Where\u2019s your brothers, then, a leannan?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cFevered,\u201d the girl answered, indifferently. It was nothing out of the way; half the emigrants in line were coughing and sneezing, three days in darkness and damp clothes having done nothing for their precarious state of health.</p><p>\u201cHave ye seen a Cirein Croin, then?\u201d she asked, leaning far over the rail, a hand shading her eyes. \u201cAre they really big enough to swallow the boat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMyself has not seen one.\u201d Roger dropped his dipper and grabbed her by the apron sash, pulling her firmly off the rail. \u201cHave a care, aye? It would take no more than a spratling to swallow you, lassie!\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook!\u201d she shrieked, leaning farther over in spite of his grasp. \u201cLook, it is, it is!\u201d</p> <p>Drawn as much by the terror in her voice as what she said, Roger leaned over the rail involuntarily. A dark shape hovered just below the surface, smooth and black, graceful as a bullet\u2014and half the length of the ship. It kept pace for a few moments with the racing vessel, then was outdistanced and left behind.</p><p>\u201cShark,\u201d Roger said, shaken in spite of himself. He gave the girl a small shake, to stop her steam-whistle screeches. \u201cIt\u2019s no but a shark, hear? Ye ken what\u2019s a shark, do ye not? We ate one, only last week!\u201d</p><p>She had quit shrieking, but was still white-faced and wide-eyed, tender mouth quivering.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sure?\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2014it wasna a Cirein Croin?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Roger said gently, and gave her a dipper of water to drink, by herself. \u201cOnly a shark.\u201d The biggest shark he had ever seen, with an air of blind ferocity that raised the hair on his forearms to see\u2014but only a shark. They hung about the ship whenever her speed slowed, eager for the garbage and slops tossed overboard.</p> <p>\u201cIsobe\u00e0il!\u201d An indignant cry summoned his erstwhile companion to come and lend a hand with the family chores. With dragging step and out-thrust lip, Isobe\u00e0il slouched off to help her mother with the water buckets, leaving Roger to finish his job without further distraction.</p><p>No further distraction than his thoughts, at least. For the most part, he succeeded in forgetting that the Gloriana had nothing below her save leagues of empty water; that the ship was not, in fact, the small and solid island that it seemed, but instead no more than a fragile shell, at the mercy of forces that could crush her in moments\u2014and everyone aboard.</p><p>Had the Phillip Alonzo reached port in safety? he wondered. Ships did sink, and fairly often; he\u2019d read enough accounts of it. Having lived through the last three days, he could only be amazed that more of them didn\u2019t sink. Well, and there was precisely nothing he could do about that prospect, except pray.</p><p>For those in peril on the deep, Lord, have mercy.</p><p>With sudden vividness, he understood exactly what the maker of that line had meant.</p><p>Finished, he dropped the dipper into the barrel and reached for a board to cover the open top; rats tended to fall in and drown otherwise. One of the women clutched him by the arm as he turned away. She gestured at the little boy she held, fussing against his mother\u2019s neck.</p> <p>\u201cMr. MacKenzie, might the Captain gie us a wee rub wi\u2019 his ring? Our Gibbie has a touch o\u2019 sore eyes from bein\u2019 in the dark sae long.\u201d</p><p>Roger hesitated, but then ridiculed himself. He, like the rest of the crew, tended to steer clear of Bonnet, but there was no reason to refuse the woman\u2019s request; the Captain had obliged before with a rub of his gold ring, this being a popular remedy for sore eyes and inflammations.</p><p>\u201cYeah, sure,\u201d he said, forgetting himself for a moment. \u201cCome on.\u201d The woman blinked in surprise, but followed him obediently. The Captain was on his quarterdeck, engaged in close conversation with the mate; Roger motioned to the woman to wait for a bit, and she nodded, shrinking modestly behind him.</p><p>The Captain looked as tired as any of them, the lines of dissipation carved deeper in his face. Lucifer after a week of running Hell, and finding it no picnic, Roger thought, sourly amused.</p><p>\u201c...damage to the tea chests?\u201d Bonnet was saying to the mate.</p><p>\u201cOnly two, and not soaked through,\u201d Dixon replied. \u201cWe can salvage a bit; maybe get rid of it upriver in Cross Creek.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, they\u2019re more particular in Edenton and New Bern. We\u2019ll get the best prices there, though; we\u2019ll get rid of what we can before we go to Wilmington.\u201d</p><p>Bonnet turned slightly and caught sight of Roger. His expression hardened, but relaxed again when he heard the request. Without comment, he reached down and rubbed the gold ring he wore on his little finger gently over little Gilbert\u2019s closed eyes. A plain wide band, Roger saw; it almost looked like a wedding ring, though smaller\u2014a woman\u2019s ring, maybe. The formidable Bonnet with a love token? Could be, Roger supposed; some women might find the Captain\u2019s air of subdued violence attractive.</p> <p>\u201cThe wean\u2019s ailing,\u201d Dixon remarked. He pointed, there was a prickle of red bumps behind the boy\u2019s ears, and his pale cheeks bloomed with fever.</p><p>\u201cNo but milk fever,\u201d the woman said, pulling her child defensively against her bosom. \u201cHe\u2019s a new tooth coming, likely.\u201d</p><p>The Captain nodded indifferently and turned away. Roger escorted the woman to the galley to beg a bit of hard biscuit for the child to gnaw on, then sent her back to the forward hold with the others.</p><p>He had little thought for Gilbert\u2019s gums, though; as he climbed the ladderway to the deck, his mind was occupied by the conversation he had overheard.</p><p>Stops in New Bern and Edenton, before Wilmington. And plainly Bonnet was in no rush; he\u2019d be looking for good prices for his cargo, and taking the time to broker the indentures of his passengers\u2014Christ, it could be weeks before they made Wilmington!</p><p>It wouldn\u2019t do, Roger thought. God knew where Brianna could get to\u2014or what sort of thing happen to her. The Gloriana had made swift passage, in spite of the squall\u2014God willing, they\u2019d make North Carolina in only eight weeks, if the winds held. He didn\u2019t want to sacrifice the valuable time so gained to lallygagging in the northern Carolina ports, mooching their way south.</p><p>He\u2019d be off the Gloriana in the first port they touched, he resolved, and make his way south as best he could. True, he\u2019d given his word to stay with the ship until the cargo was disposed of, but then, he wouldn\u2019t be taking his wages, either, so the exchange seemed fair enough.</p><p>The fresh cold air above decks did a little bit to rouse him. His head still felt stuffed with damp cotton wool, though, and the back of his throat was raspy with salt. Three hours more to go on his watch; he made his way forward for another dipper of water, hoping it would help him stay on his feet.</p><p>Dixon had left the Captain, and was strolling through the clusters of passengers, nodding to the men, stopping to say something to a woman with children. Odd, Roger thought. The mate wasn\u2019t a sociable man with the crew, let alone with the passengers, whom he regarded as nothing more than an unusually inconvenient form of cargo.</p><p>Something stirred in his mind at the mention of cargo, something uncomfortable, but he couldn\u2019t bring it to the forefront of recognition. It hung in the shadows of exhaustion, just out of sight, nearly close enough to smell. Yes, that was it, it had to do with a smell. But what\u2014</p><p>\u201cMacKenzie!\u201d One of the seamen was calling from the afterdeck, waving for him to come and help with the mending of sails torn by the storm; huge stacks of folded canvas lay like dirty snowdrifts on the boards, their upper layers billowing in the wind.</p><p>Roger groaned, and stretched his aching muscles. No matter what happened in North Carolina, he would be very glad to get off this ship.</p><p>Two nights later, Roger was deep in dreams when the shouting roused him. His feet hit the deck and he was running for the companionway, heart pumping at full bore, before his mind had grasped the fact that he was awake. He sprang for the ladder, only to be knocked sprawling by a blow to his chest.</p><p>\u201cStay where ye are, fool!\u201d Dixon\u2019s voice growled from the rungs above. He could see the mate\u2019s head, outlined against the starry square of the hatchway overhead.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it? What\u2019s happening?\u201d He shook off the confusion of his dreams, to find no less confusion in the waking.</p><p>There were others in the dark near him, he could feel bodies stumble over him as he struggled to his feet. All the noise was up above, though; a thunder of feet on the deck and a shouting and shrieking like nothing he had ever heard.</p><p>\u201cMurderers!\u201d A woman\u2019s voice cut through the racket, shrill as a fife. \u201cWicked mur\u2014\u201d The voice cut off abruptly, with a heavy thump on the deck above.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d On his feet again, Roger shoved his way through the men by the ladder, shouting up to Dixon, \u201cWhat? Are we boarded?\u201d His words were drowned by the shouting above; the steam-whistle shrieks of women and children, cutting through men\u2019s bellowing and curses.</p><p>Red light flickered somewhere above. Was the ship afire? He shoved through the press of men and grabbed the ladder, reached up and seized Dixon\u2019s foot.</p><p>\u201cGerrof!\u201d The foot jerked free, aimed a kick at his head. \u201cStay down there! Christ, man, ye want to catch pox?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPox? What the hell is going on up there?\u201d Eyes accustomed to the dark by now, Roger grabbed the stabbing foot and gave it a vicious twist, jerked downward. Unprepared for assault, Dixon lost his grip on the ladder and fell heavily, sliding over Roger\u2019s head and into the men below.</p><p>Roger ignored the cries of rage and surprise behind him and clambered out onto the deck. There was a group of men clustered thick about the forward hatchway. Lanterns hung above in the rigging, shooting beams of red and white and yellow light that caught the gleam of blades.</p><p>He looked quickly for another ship, but the ocean was black and empty on all sides. No boarders, no pirates; all the struggle was taking place near the hatchway, where half the crew was gathered in a knot, armed with knives and clubs.</p><p>Mutiny? he thought, and dismissed it, even as he pushed forward; Bonnet\u2019s head showed above the crowd, hatless, fair hair gleaming in the flash of lantern light. Roger shoved his way into the mob, ruthlessly shouldering smaller seamen aside.</p><p>Shrieks and shouts echoed from the hold, and a flicker of light showed below. A bundle of rags was handed up, passed rapidly from hand to hand, disappeared behind the shifting mass of limbs and clubs. There was a heavy splash to port, and then another.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it, what\u2019s happening?\u201d He bellowed in the ear of the bosun, who stood near the hatchway, holding a lantern. The man jerked round and glared at him.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve not had pox, have you? Get below!\u201d Hutchinson\u2019s attention had already gone back to the open hatchway.</p><p>\u201cYes, I have! What\u2019s that got to\u2014\u201d</p><p>The bosun swung back, surprised.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve had pox? You\u2019re not marked. Ach, let it go\u2014get you down, then, we need all hands!\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor what?\u201d Roger leaned forward, to make himself heard above the noise from below.</p><p>\u201cSmallpox!\u201d the bosun bellowed back. He gestured at the open hatchway, as one of the seamen appeared at the top of the ladder, a child under one arm, feebly kicking. Hands clawed and beat at the man\u2019s hunched back, and a woman\u2019s voice rose high above the other noises, shrill with terror. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She got a grip on the seaman\u2019s blouse, and as Roger watched, she began to climb the man\u2019s body, dragging him backward as she struggled to reach the child, screaming as she clawed the man\u2019s back, digging handfuls of cloth and flesh.</p><p>The man roared and swatted at her, trying to dislodge her. The ladder was fixed, but the seaman, one-handed and pulled off balance, swayed wildly, his look of rage turning to alarm as his feet slipped on the rung.</p><p>Reflex alone made Roger lunge forward, grabbing the child like a rugger ball as the seaman threw his arms out in a last effort to save himself. Entangled like lovers, man and woman fell backward together into the open maw of the hatchway. There was a crash and more screams from below, then the sudden, momentary silence of shock. Then the outcries began again, below, and a muttering babble around him.</p><p>Roger righted the child, trying to stop its whimpering with awkward pats. It seemed curiously loose-jointed in his arms, and it felt hot, even through its layers of clothes. Light flashed over Roger as the bosun lifted his lantern high, looking at the child with distaste.</p> <p>\u201cHope you have had the pox, MacKenzie,\u201d he said.</p><p>It was wee Gilbert, the lad with sore eyes\u2014but two days had made such a change that Roger scarcely recognized him. The boy was thin as a wraith, the round face gone so thin that the skullbones showed. The fair, dirt-smudged skin had gone, too, submerged under a mass of suppurating pustules so thick that the eyes were mere slits in the lolling head.</p><p>He had barely time to register the sight before hands plucked the small, burning body from him. Before he could grasp the sudden emptiness in his arms, there was another splash to port.</p><p>He swung toward the rail in vain reflex, hands curled in fists of shock, but then turned back as a new roar came from the hatchway behind.</p><p>The passengers had recovered from the surprise of the attack. A rush of men boiled up the ladder, armed with anything they could seize, and fell upon the seamen at the top, bearing them down with sheer frenzy.</p> <p>Someone cannoned into Roger and he fell, rolling to the side as a stool leg thudded into the deck near his head. He got to his hands and knees, was kicked in the ribs, shied and was pushed, heaved back against obstruction, and with a moment\u2019s opportunity, threw himself blindly at a pair of legs, having no idea whether he fought crew or passengers, fighting only for room to stand up and breathe.</p><p>The stink of sickness rolled out of the hold, a sweet, rotting smell that overlaid the usual harsh reek of ripe bodies and sewage. The lanterns swung with the wind, and light and shadow cut the scene to pieces, so that here showed a face, wild-eyed and shouting, there an arm upraised, here a nak*d foot, only to vanish in the darkness and be replaced at once by elbows and knives and thrusting knees, so the deck seemed awash in dismembered bodies.</p><p>So strong was the confusion that Roger felt dismembered himself; he glanced down, feeling numbness in his left arm, half expecting to find the limb struck off. It was there, though, and he raised it by reflex, fending off an unseen blow that jarred through bone.</p><p>Someone grasped his hair; he jerked free and swung round, elbowed someone hard in the ribs and swung again, hitting air. He found himself momentarily standing clear of the fight, gasping for breath. Two figures crouched before him, in the shadow of the rail; as he shook his head to clear it, the taller stood up and launched itself at him.</p><p>He reeled backward under the impact, clutching his attacker. They struck the foremast and fell together, then rolled over and over, hammering each other in blind earnest. Caught in the web of noise and blows, he paid no mind to the disjointed words that panted in his ear.</p><p>Then a boot struck him, and another, and as he loosed his hold on his opponent, two crewmen kicked them apart. Someone seized the other man and pulled him upright, and Roger saw the flash of the bosun\u2019s lantern held high, revealing the face of the tall fair-haired passenger\u2014Morag MacKenzie\u2019s husband, green eyes dark and wild with fury.</p> <p>MacKenzie was the worse for wear\u2014so was Roger, as he discovered when he passed a hand across his face and felt his split lip\u2014but his skin was clear of pustules.</p><p>\u201cGood enough,\u201d said Hutchinson briefly, and the man was thrust unceremoniously toward the hatchway.</p><p>His comrades gave Roger a rough hand up, and then left him swaying, dazed and ignored, as they finished their work. The resistance had been short-lived; though armed with the fury of despair, the passengers were weakened by six weeks under hatches, by sickness and scanty food. The stronger had been clubbed into submission, the weaker forced back, and those sick of pox\u2014</p><p>Roger looked out at the rail and the path of the moon\u2019s aisle, serene on the water. He grabbed the rail and vomited, retching till no more than bile came up, burning the back of nose and throat. The water below was black, and empty.</p><p>Drained and shaking from exertion, he made his way slowly across the deck. Those seamen he passed were silent, but from the battened forward hatchway, a single thin wail rose up, and up, an endless keen that drew no breath and knew no respite.</p><p>He nearly fell down the companionway into the crew\u2019s quarters, went to his hammock, ignoring all questions, and wrapped his blanket over his head, trying to shut out the sound of the wailing\u2014to shut out everything.</p><p>But there was no oblivion to be found in the suffocating woolen folds, and he jerked the blanket off, heart pounding, with a sensation of drowning so strong in his chest that he gulped air, again and again until he felt dizzy, and still breathed deep, as though he must breathe for those who could not.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s for the best, lad,\u201d Hutchinson had said to him with gruff sympathy, passing by as he puked his guts out over the rail. \u201cPox spreads like wildfire; none in that hold would live to make landfall, did we not take out the sick.\u201d</p> <p>And was this better than the slower death of scabs and fever? Not for those left behind; the wail went on and on, lancing the silence, piercing wood and heart alike.</p><p>Maimed pictures flashed in his mind, truncated scenes caught by the popping of invisible flashbulbs: the sailor\u2019s contorted face as he fell into the hold; the little boy\u2019s half-open mouth, the inside scabbed with pustules. Bonnet standing above the fray, with his face of a fallen angel, watching. And the dark hungry water, empty under the moon.</p><p>Something bumped softly, sliding past the hull, and he rolled into a shivering ball, oblivious alike to the sweltering heat in the hold, and the sleepy complaint of the man next to him. No, not empty. He had heard the seamen say that sharks never sleep.</p><p>\u201cOh, God,\u201d he said aloud. \u201cOh, God!\u201d He should have been praying for the dead, but could not.</p><p>He rolled again, squirming, trying to escape, and in the echo of the futile prayer found memory\u2014the misplaced hearing of those few frantic words, panted in his ear during those moments of unthinking frenzy.</p><p>For the love of God, man, the fair-haired man had said. For the love of God, let her go!</p><p>He straightened and lay stiff, bathed in cold sweat.</p><p>Two figures in the shadow. And the open hatchway to the stores hold some twenty feet away.</p><p>\u201cOh, God,\u201d he said again, but this time, it was a prayer.</p><p>It was the middle of the dogwatch next day before Roger found an opportunity to go down to the hold. He made no effort to avoid being seen; watching his shipmates had taught him quickly that in close quarters, nothing drew attention faster than furtiveness.</p><p>If anyone asked, he had heard a bumping noise, and thought perhaps the load had shifted. Close enough to the truth, at that.</p><p>He hung from the edge of the hatch by his hands; less chance of being followed if he didn\u2019t put down the ladder. He dropped into the dark and landed hard, jarring his bones. Anyone down here would have heard that\u2014and by the same token, if anyone followed him, he would be warned.</p><p>He took a moment to recover from the shock of landing, then began to move cautiously through the looming dim bulks of the stacked cargo. Everything seemed blurred round the edges. It wasn\u2019t only the faint light, he thought; everything in the hold was vibrating very slightly, thrumming to the shiver of the hull beneath. He could hear it, if he listened closely; the lowest note in the ship\u2019s song.</p><p>Through the narrow aisles between the ranks of crates, past the huge bellies of the serried water casks. He breathed in; the air was full of the smell of wet wood, overlaid by the faint perfume of tea. There were rustlings and creakings, plenty of odd noises\u2014but no sign of any human presence. Still, he was sure that someone was here.</p><p>And why are you here, mate? he thought. What if one of the steerage passengers had taken refuge here? If someone lay hidden here, chances were good that they had the pox; Roger could do nothing for them\u2014why bother to look?</p><p>Because he couldn\u2019t not look, was the answer. He didn\u2019t reproach himself for failing to save the pox-stricken passengers; nothing could have helped them in any case, and perhaps a quick death by drowning was not in fact more terrible than the slow agony of the disease. He\u2019d like to believe that.</p><p>But he hadn\u2019t slept; the events of the night filled him with such a sense of horror and sick futility that he could find no rest. Whether he could do anything now, or not, he must do something. He had to look.</p><p>Something small moved in the deep shadows of the hold. Rat, he thought, and turned reflexively to stamp on it. The movement saved him; a heavy object whizzed past his head and landed with a splash in the bilges below.</p><p>He put his head down and lunged in the direction of the movement, shoulders hunched against an expected blow. There was nowhere to run, and not much place to hide. He saw it again, lunged, and grabbed cloth. Jerked hard, and got flesh. A quick scuffle in the dark, and a cry of alarm, and he found himself pressing a body hard against a bulkhead, clutching the skinny wrist of Morag MacKenzie.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell?\u201d She kicked at him, and tried to bite, but he ignored this. He got a good grip on the scruff of her neck and hauled her out of the shadows, into the dim brown light of the hold. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing! Let go! Let me go, please! Please, I beg ye, sir\u2014\u201d Force not availing to free herself\u2014she weighed perhaps half what he did\u2014she turned to pleading, words pouring out in a half-whispered stream of desperation. \u201cFor the sake of your own mother, sir! Ye canna do it, please ye cannot let them kill him please!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to kill anyone. For God\u2019s sake, hush yourself!\u201d he said, and gave her a small shake.</p><p>From the blackest shadows behind the anchor chain came the high, thin wail of a fretful baby.</p><p>She gave a small gasp and looked up at him, frantic.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ll hear him! God, man, let me go to him!\u201d Such was her desperation that she succeeded in wrenching herself free, and fled toward the sound, clambering over the great rusted links of the anchor chain, heedless of filth.</p><p>He followed, more slowly; she couldn\u2019t get away\u2014there was nowhere for her to go. He found them in the darkest spot, crouched against one of the ship\u2019s knees, the huge angled timbers that framed the hull. There was barely a foot of clearance between the rough wood of the hull and the piled mass of the anchor chain; she was no more than a darker blot on the stygian blackness.</p><p>\u201cI will not hurt you,\u201d he said softly. The shadow seemed to shrink away from him, but she didn\u2019t answer. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>His eyes were slowly growing accustomed to the dark; even back here, a faint light seeped through from the distant hatch. A patch of white\u2014her breast was bared, giving suck to the child. He could hear the small wet noises as it fed.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell are you doing here?\u201d he asked, though he knew well enough. His stomach clenched tight, and not just because of the foul smell of the bilges. He squatted next to her, barely able to fit in the tiny space.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m hiding!\u201d she said fiercely. \u201cSurely to goodness ye see that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs the child sick?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo!\u201d She hunched herself over the baby, squirming as far away from him as she could get.</p><p>\u201cThen\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s no but a wee rash! All bairns get them, my mither said so!\u201d He could hear the fear in her voice, underneath the furious denial.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d he said, as gently as he could. He reached a tentative hand toward the dark blotch she held.</p><p>She struck at him, awkwardly one-handed, and he jerked back with a hiss of pain.</p> <p>\u201cJesus! Ye stabbed me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cStay back! I\u2019ve my husband\u2019s dirk,\u201d she warned. \u201cI won\u2019t let ye take him, I\u2019ll kill ye first, I swear I will!\u201d</p><p>He believed her. Hand to his mouth, he could taste his own blood, sweet and salt on his tongue. It was no more than a scratch, but he believed her. She\u2019d kill him\u2014or die herself, which was a great deal more likely if one of the crew found her.</p><p>But no, he thought. She was worth money. Bonnet wouldn\u2019t kill her\u2014only have her dragged on deck and forced to watch as her child was torn out of her arms and thrown into the sea. He remembered the dark shadows that dogged the ship, and shuddered with a cold that had nothing to do with the dank surroundings.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t take him. But if it\u2019s the pox\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not! I swear to Bride, it\u2019s not!\u201d A small hand shot out of the shadows and gripped him by the sleeve. \u201cIt\u2019s as I tell ye, it\u2019s no but a milk rash, I\u2019ve seen it, man\u2014a hundred times before! I\u2019m the eldest o\u2019 nine, I ken weel enough when a bairn\u2019s sick and when he\u2019s but teething!\u201d</p> <p>He hesitated, then made up his mind abruptly. If she was wrong, and the child had smallpox, she was likely already infected; to return her to the hold would be only to spread the disease. And if she was right\u2014he knew as well as she that it didn\u2019t matter; any rash would condemn the child on sight.</p><p>He could feel her quivering, on the brink of hysteria. He wanted to touch her in reassurance, but thought better of it. She wouldn\u2019t trust him, and no wonder.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t give you away,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>He was met by suspicious silence.</p><p>\u201cYou need food, don\u2019t you? And fresh water. You\u2019ll have no milk soon, without it, and then what of the bairn?\u201d</p><p>He could hear her breathing, ragged and phlegmy. She was ill, but it needn\u2019t be pox; all the hold passengers coughed and wheezed\u2014the damp had got into their lungs early on.</p><p>\u201cShow him to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Her eyes shone in the dark, fearful as a cornered rat\u2019s, and the edge of her lip lifted over small white teeth.</p> <p>\u201cI swear I will not take him from you. I need to see, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat will ye swear on?\u201d</p><p>He groped his memory for a suitable Celtic oath, then gave up and said what was in his mind.</p><p>\u201cOn my own woman\u2019s life,\u201d he said, \u201cand on the heads of my unborn sons.\u201d</p><p>He could feel doubt, and then a small easing of the tension in her; the round knee pressed against his leg moved slightly as she relaxed. There was a stealthy rustling in the chains nearby. Real rats this time.</p><p>\u201cI canna leave him here alone while I steal food.\u201d He saw the faint tilt of her head toward the noise. \u201cThey\u2019ll eat him alive; they\u2019ve bitten me in my sleep already, the filthy vermin.\u201d</p><p>He reached out his hands, conscious all the time of the sounds from the deck above. It wasn\u2019t likely that anyone would come down here, but how long before he was missed above?</p><p>She still hesitated, but at last reached a finger toward her breast, and freed the child\u2019s mouth with a tiny pop! It made a small sound of protest, and wriggled slightly as he took it.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t held babies very often; the feel of the dirty little bundle was startling\u2014inert but lively, soft yet firm.</p><p>\u201cMind his head!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got it.\u201d Cradling the warm round skull in one careful palm, he duck-walked backward a step or two, bringing the child\u2019s face into dim light.</p><p>The cheeks were splotched with reddish pustules, topped with white\u2014they looked for all the world like pox to Roger, and he felt a tremor of revulsion in the palms of his hands. Immunity or not, it took courage to touch contagion and not flinch.</p><p>He squinted at the child, then carefully undid its wrappings, ignoring the mother\u2019s hissed protest. He slid a hand under its dress, feeling first the soggy clout that hung between its chubby legs, and then the smooth, silky skin of chest and stomach.</p><p>The child didn\u2019t really seem so sick; his eyes were clear, not gummy. And while the tiny boy seemed feverish, it wasn\u2019t the searing heat he had felt the night before. The baby whined and squirmed, true, but he kicked with a fretful strength in the tiny limbs, not the weak spasms of a dying child.</p><p>The very young go quickly, Claire had said. You have no notion how fast disease moves, when there\u2019s nothing to fight it with. He had some notion, after last night.</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d he whispered at last. \u201cI think you\u2019re maybe right.\u201d He felt, rather than saw, the easing of her arm\u2014she had held her dagger ready.</p><p>He gingerly handed back the child, with a mingled sense of relief and reluctance. And the terrifying realization of the responsibility he had accepted.</p><p>Morag was cooing to the boy, cuddling him against her breast as she hastily rewrapped him.</p><p>\u201cSweet Jemmy, aye, that\u2019s a good laddie. Hush, bittie, hush now, it\u2019ll be all right, Mammy\u2019s here for ye.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long?\u201d Roger whispered, laying a hand on her arm. \u201cHow long will the rash last, if it\u2019s milk rash?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe four days, maybe five,\u201d she whispered back. \u201cBut it\u2019s no but maybe twa more, and the rash will be different\u2014less. Anyone can see then that it\u2019s not the pox. I can come out, then.\u201d</p><p>Two days. If it was pox, the child would be dead in two days. But if not\u2014he might just manage. And so might she.</p><p>\u201cCan you keep awake that long? The rats\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, I can,\u201d she said fiercely. \u201cI can do what I must. Will ye help me, then?\u201d</p><p>He drew a deep breath, ignoring the stench.</p><p>\u201cAye, I will.\u201d He stood up, and gave her his hand. After a moment\u2019s hesitation, she took it, and stood too. She was small, she barely reached his shoulder, and her hand in his was the size of a child\u2019s\u2014in the shadows, she looked like a young girl cradling her doll.</p><p>\u201cHow old are you?\u201d he asked suddenly.</p><p>He caught the gleam of her eyes, surprised, and then the flash of teeth.</p><p>\u201cYesterday I was two-and-twenty,\u201d she said dryly. \u201cToday, I\u2019m maybe a hundred.\u201d</p><p>The small damp hand pulled free of his, and she melted back into the darkness.</p><p>39</p><p>A GAMBLING MAN</p><p>The fog gathered through the night. By dawn the ship rode in a cloud so thick that the sea below could not be seen from the rail, and only the susurrus of the hull\u2019s passage indicated that the Gloriana still floated on water, not air.</p><p>There was no sun, and little wind; the sails hung limp, shuddering now and then with a passing air. Oppressed by the dimness, men walked the decks like ghosts, appearing out of the murk with a suddenness that startled one another.</p><p>This obscurity served Roger well; he was able to pass almost unseen through the ship, and slip unobserved into the hold, the small store of food he had kept back from his own meals concealed in his shirt.</p><p>The fog had gotten into the hold as well; clammy white tendrils touched his face, drifting out between the looming water casks, and hovered near his feet. It was darker than ever here below, gone from dusty-gold dimness to the black-brown of cold, wet wood.</p><p>The child was asleep; Roger saw no more than the curve of its cheek, still spattered with red pustules. They looked angry and inflamed. Morag saw his look of doubt and said nothing, but took his hand in her own and pressed it to the baby\u2019s neck.</p><p>The tiny pulse went bump-bump-bump under his finger, and the soft creased skin was warm but damp. Reassured, he smiled at Morag, and she gave him back a tiny glimmer.</p><p>A month in steerage had left her thin and grimy; the last two days had stamped her face with permanent lines of fear. Her hair straggled lank around her face, caked with grease and thick with lice. Her eyes were bruised with tiredness, and she smelled of feces and urine, sour milk and stale sweat. Her lips were tight and pale as the rest of her face. Roger took her very gently by the shoulders, bent, and kissed her mouth.</p><p>At the top of the ladder, he looked back. She was still standing there looking up at him, the child in her arms.</p><p>The deck was quiet save for the murmur of helmsman and bosun, invisible at the wheel. Roger eased the hatch cover back in place, his heart beginning to slow again, the touch of her still warming his hands. Two days. Maybe three. Perhaps they would make it; Roger at least was convinced she was right, the child did not have pox.</p><p>There should be no occasion for anyone to go into the hold soon\u2014a fresh water-cask had been brought up only the day before. He could contrive to feed her\u2014if only she could stay awake long enough...the sharp ting of the ship\u2019s bell pierced the fog, a reminder of time that no longer seemed to exist, its passage unmarked by any change of light or dark.</p><p>It was as Roger crossed toward the stern that he heard it; a sudden loud whoosh in the mist off the rail, very near at hand. The next instant, the ship trembled slightly underfoot, her boards brushed by something huge.</p><p>\u201cWhale!\u201d came a cry from aloft. He could see two men near the main-mast, dimly outlined in the fog. At the cry, they froze, and he realized that he, too, was standing rigid, listening.</p><p>There was another whoosh nearby, another farther off. The crew of the Gloriana stood silent, each man charting in his head the great exhalations, marking an invisible map on which the ship drifted through moving shoals, mountains of silent, intelligent flesh.</p><p>How big were they? Roger wondered. Big enough to damage the ship? He strained his eyes, vainly trying to see anything at all through the fog.</p><p>It came again, a thump hard enough to jar the rail under his hands, followed by a long, grating rasp that shuddered through the boards. There were muffled cries of fear from below; to those in the steerage, it would be right next to them, no more than the planks of the hull between them and rupture\u2014a sudden smash and the frightful inrush of the sea. Three-inch oak planks seemed no more substantial than tissue paper against the great beasts that floated nearby, breathing unseen in the fog.</p><p>\u201cBarnacles,\u201d said a soft Irish voice from the mist behind him. Despite himself, Roger jumped, and a low chuckle materialized into Bonnet\u2019s shadowed bulk. The Captain held a cheroot between his teeth, a spill from the galley fire illumining the lines and planes of his face, dissolute in red light. The rasping shudder came again through the boards. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThey scratch themselves to rid their skins of parasites,\u201d Bonnet said casually. \u201cWe are no more to them than a floating stone.\u201d He drew heavily to start the flame, blew fragrant smoke, and tossed the burning paper overboard. It vanished in the mist like a falling star.</p><p>Roger let out a breath only slightly less noisy than the whales\u2019. How close had Bonnet been? Had the Captain seen him coming out of the hold?</p><p>\u201cThey will not damage the ship, then?\u201d he said, matching the Captain\u2019s casual tone.</p><p>Bonnet smoked for a moment in silence, concentrating on the draw of his cigar. Without the illumination of the open flame, he was once more a shadow, marked only by the glowing coal of the tip.</p> <p>\u201cWho knows?\u201d he said at last, small spurts of smoke puffing out between his teeth as he spoke. \u201cAny one of the beasts might sink us, should he have a mind in him for mischief. I saw a ship once\u2014or what was left of it\u2014battered to pieces by an angry whale. Three feet of board, and a bit of spar left floating\u2014sunk with all hands, two hundred souls.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t seem troubled by the possibility.\u201d</p><p>There was a long sound of exhalation, a faint echo of the whales\u2019 sighing, as Bonnet blew smoke between pursed lips.</p><p>\u201c \u2019Twould be a waste of strength to worry myself. A wise man leaves those things beyond his power to the gods\u2014and prays that Danu will be with him.\u201d The edge of the Captain\u2019s hat turned toward him. \u201cYe\u2019ll know of Danu, will ye, MacKenzie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDanu?\u201d Roger said stupidly, and then the penny dropped, an old chant coming back to him from the mists of childhood\u2014something Mrs. Graham had taught him to say. \u201cCome to me, Danu, change my luck. Make me bold. Give me wealth\u2014and love to hold.\u201d</p> <p>There was an amused grunt behind the coal.</p><p>\u201cAh, and you not even an Irishman. But sure I knew you from the first for a man of learning, MacKenzie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know Danu the Luck-Giver,\u201d Roger said, hoping against hope that that particular Celtic goddess was both a good sailor and on his side. He took a step backward, meaning to go, but a hand descended on his wrist, holding tight.</p><p>\u201cA man of learning,\u201d Bonnet repeated softly, all levity gone from his voice, \u201cbut no wisdom. And are you a praying man at all, MacKenzie?\u201d</p><p>He tensed, but felt the force of Bonnet\u2019s grip and did not pull away. Strength gathered in his limbs, his body knowing before he did that the fight had come.</p><p>\u201cI said a wise man does not trouble himself with things beyond his power\u2014but on this ship, MacKenzie, everything is in my power.\u201d The grip on his wrist tightened. \u201cAnd everyone.\u201d</p> <p>Roger jerked his wrist sideways, breaking the grip. He stood alone, knowing there was neither help nor escape. There was no world beyond the ship, and within it, Bonnet was right\u2014all were in the Captain\u2019s power. If he died, it would not help Morag\u2014but that choice was made already.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d said Bonnet, sounding only mildly interested. \u201cThe woman\u2019s no looker, sure. And a man of such learning, too; would you risk my ship and my venture, then, only for the sake of a warm body?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo risk.\u201d The words came out hoarse, forced through a tight throat. Come at me, he thought, and his hands curled at his sides. Come at me, and give me a chance to take you with me. \u201cThe child doesn\u2019t have pox\u2014a harmless rash.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou will forgive my putting my ignorant opinion above your own, Mr. MacKenzie, but I am Captain here.\u201d The voice was still soft, but the venom was clear.</p><p>\u201cIt is a child, for God\u2019s sake!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is\u2014and of no value.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo value to you, perhaps!\u201d</p><p>There was a moment\u2019s silence, broken only by a distant whoosh in the empty white.</p> <p>\u201cAnd what value to you?\u201d the voice asked, implacable. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>For the sake of a warm body. Yes, for that. For the touch of humanity, the memory of tenderness, for the feeling of life stubborn in the face of death.</p><p>\u201cFor pity,\u201d he said. \u201cShe is poor; there was no one to help her.\u201d</p><p>The rich perfume of tobacco reached him, narcotic, enchanting. He breathed it in, taking strength from it.</p><p>Bonnet moved, and he moved, too, settling himself in preparation. But there was no blow forthcoming; the shadow dug in a pocket, held out a ghostly hand in which he caught a magpie glitter from the diffuse lantern light\u2014coins and bits of rubbish and what might have been a jewel\u2019s quick gleam. Then the Captain plucked out a silver shilling, and thrust the rest back into his pocket.</p><p>\u201cAh, pity,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd did yez say you were a gambling man at all, MacKenzie?\u201d</p><p>He held out the shilling, dropped it. Roger caught it, only by reflex.</p><p>\u201cFor the suckling\u2019s life, then,\u201d Bonnet said, and the tone of light amusement was back. \u201cA gentleman\u2019s wager, shall we call it? Heads it lives, and tails it dies.\u201d</p><p>The coin was warm and solid in his palm, an alien thing in this world of drifting chill. His hands were slick with sweat, and yet his mind had gone cold and sharp, focused to an ice pick\u2019s point.</p><p>Heads he lives, and tails he dies, he thought quite calmly, and did not mean the child below. He marked throat and crotch on the other man; grip and lunge, a blow and heave\u2014the rail was no more than a foot away, the empty realm of the whales beyond.</p><p>There was no room beyond his calculations for any sense of fear. He saw the coin spin up as though it were thrown by another hand, then fall to the deck. His muscles bunched themselves, slowly.</p><p>\u201cIt seems Danu is with ye the night, sir.\u201d Bonnet\u2019s soft Irish voice seemed to come to him from a great way off, as the Captain bent and picked up the coin.</p><p>Realization was only beginning to bloom in his chest, when the Captain gripped his shoulder, turning him down the deck.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll walk with me awhile, MacKenzie.\u201d</p><p>Something had happened to his knees; he felt as though he would sink down with every step, and yet somehow stayed upright, keeping pace with the shadow. The ship was silent, the deck under his feet a mile away; but the sea beyond was a live thing, breathing. He felt the breath in his own lungs rise and fall with the shifting deck, and felt as though there were no boundaries to his body. It might have been wood under his feet, or water, for all he could feel.</p><p>It was some time before he made sense of Bonnet\u2019s words, and realized, with a vague sense of amazement, that the man seemed to be recounting the story of his life, in a quiet, matter-of-fact sort of way.</p><p>Orphaned in Sligo at an early age, he had learned quickly to fend for himself, he said, working as a cabin boy aboard trading ships. But one winter, with ships scarce, he had found work ashore in Inverness, digging the foundation for a grand house that was building near the town.</p><p>\u201cI was just seventeen,\u201d he said. \u201cThe youngest of the crew of workmen. I could not say why it was they hated me. Mayhap it was my manner, for that was rough enough\u2014or jealousy for my size and strength; they were an unchancy, whey-faced lot. Or maybe that the lasses smiled on me. Or maybe \u2019twas only that I was a stranger.</p><p>\u201cStill, I knew well enough I was unpopular with them\u2014little did I know quite how unpopular, though, until the day the cellar was finished and the foundation ready to be laid.\u201d</p><p>Bonnet paused to draw on his cigar, lest it go out. He let out puffs of smoke from the corners of his mouth, white wisps that curled past his head into the greater white of the fog.</p><p>\u201cThe trenches were dug,\u201d he went on, the cigar clenched between his teeth, \u201cand the walls started; the great block of the cornerstone standin\u2019 ready. I had gone to my supper, and was just walkin\u2019 back to the place where I slept, when to my surprise I was caught up by a pair of the lads with whom I worked.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019d a bottle; they sat down on a wall and urged me to drink with them. I should\u2019ve known better, for they were friendly, which they\u2019d never been before. But I did drink, and drink again, and in no time at all I was reelin\u2019 drunk, for I\u2019d no head for liquor, havin\u2019 never the money to buy strong drink. I was well fuddled by the time \u2019twas full dark, and scarcely thought to pull away when they took me by the arms and hastened me down the lane. Then they seized me, tossed me over a half-built wall, and to my surprise, I found myself lyin\u2019 in the damp dirt of the cellar I\u2019d helped dig.</p><p>\u201cAll of them were there, the workmen. Another man was with them, too; one o\u2019 them had a lantern, and when he held it up, I could see the man was Daft Joey. Daft Joey was a beggarman that lived beneath the bridge\u2014he had nay teeth, and he ate rotten fish and floating dung from the river, and he stank worse than a blackbirder\u2019s hold.</p><p>\u201cI was so dazed with the whisky and the fall that I lay where I was, only half hearin\u2019 them as they talked\u2014or argued, rather, for the chief o\u2019 the gang was angry that the two had brought me. The daftie would do, he said; a mercy to him, at that. But them that brought me said no, better me. Someone might miss the beggarman, they said. Then someone laughed and said aye, and they would not have to pay me my last week\u2019s wages, and \u2019twas then I began to know they meant to kill me.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019d talked before, while we worked. A sacrifice, they said, for the foundation, lest the earth tremble and the walls collapse. But I had not listened\u2014and if I had, would not have guessed that they meant any more than to chop the head off a cockerel and bury it, as was usual.\u201d</p><p>He had not looked at Roger through this recital, his eyes instead fixed on the mist, as though the events he described were happening again, somewhere just beyond the white curtain of fog.</p><p>Roger\u2019s clothing hung on him, clinging, wringing wet with mist and cold sweat. His stomach clenched, and the cesspool smell of the steerage might have been the stink of Daft Joey in the cellar.</p><p>\u201cSo they palavered for a bit,\u201d Bonnet went on, \u201cand the beggarman began to make noise, for he wanted more drink. And at last the chief said it was not worth so much talk, he would throw for the choice. Then he took a coin from his pocket and he said to me, laughin\u2019, \u2018Will ye take heads or tails, then, man?\u2019</p><p>\u201cI was too sick to say a word; the sky was black and whirling round and bits of light kept flickering at the edges of my eyes, like fallin\u2019 stars. So he said it for me; by Geordie\u2019s head should I live, and by his arse I should die, and he threw the shilling up in the air. It came down in the dirt by my head, but I had nay strength to turn and look.</p><p>\u201cHe bent to see and gave a grunt, then he stood up and took nay more notice of me.\u201d</p><p>They had reached the stern in their quiet pacing. Bonnet stopped there, hands on the rail, smoking silently. Then he took the cigar from his mouth.</p><p>\u201cThey pulled the daftie to the wall that was built, and made him sit down on the ground at its foot. I do remember his foolish face,\u201d he said softly. \u201cHe took a drink and he laughed wi\u2019 them, and his mouth was open\u2014slack and wet as a old whore\u2019s cunt. The next moment, the stone came down from the top of the wall, and crushed his head.\u201d</p><p>Drops of moisture had gathered on the spikes of hair at the back of Roger\u2019s neck; he could feel them run down, one at a time, trickling cold down the crease of his back. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThey rolled me on my face and hit me,\u201d Bonnet continued matter-of-factly. \u201cWhen I came to myself again, I was in the bottom of a fishing boat. The fisherman left me on the shore near Peterhead and said he would advise me to find a new ship\u2014he could see, he said, I was not meant for the land.\u201d</p><p>He held up the cigar and tapped it gently with a finger to loosen the ash.</p><p>\u201cAt that,\u201d he said, \u201cthey did give me my wages; when I came to look, the shilling was in my pocket. Ah, they were honest men, sure.\u201d</p><p>Roger leaned against the rail, gripping its wood as the single solid thing in a world gone soft and nebulous.</p> <p>\u201cAnd did you go back to the land?\u201d he asked, and heard his own voice, preternaturally calm, as though it belonged to someone else.</p><p>\u201cDid I find them, ye mean.\u201d Bonnet turned and leaned back against the rail, half facing Roger. \u201cOh, yes. Years later. One at a time. But I found them all.\u201d He opened the hand that held the coin, and held it cupped thoughtfully before him, tilting it back and forth so the silver gleamed in the lantern light.</p><p>\u201cHeads you live, and tails you die. A fair chance, would yez say, MacKenzie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor you.\u201d</p> <p>The soft Irish voice was as unemphatic as it might be were it making observations of the weather.</p><p>As in a dream, Roger felt the weight of the shilling drop once more into his hands. He heard the suck and hiss of the water on the hull, the blowing of the whales\u2014and the suck and hiss of Bonnet\u2019s breath as he drew on his cigar. Seven whales the fill of a Cirein Croin.</p><p>\u201cA fair chance,\u201d Bonnet said. \u201cLuck was with you before, MacKenzie. See will Danu come for you again\u2014or will it be the Soul-Eater this time?\u201d</p><p>The fog had closed over the deck. There was nothing visible save the glowing coal of Bonnet\u2019s cigar, a burning cyclops in the mist. The man might be a devil indeed, one eye closed to human misery, one eye open to the dark. And here Roger stood quite literally between the devil and the deep blue sea, with his fate shining silver in the palm of his hand.</p><p>\u201cIt is my life; I\u2019ll make the call,\u201d he said, and was surprised to hear his voice calm and steady. \u201cTails\u2014tails is mine.\u201d He threw, and caught, clapped his one hand hard against the back of the other, trapped the coin and its unknown sentence.</p><p>He closed his eyes and thought just once of Brianna. I\u2019m sorry, he said silently to her, and lifted his hand.</p> <p>A warm breath passed over his skin, and then he felt a spot of coolness on the back of his hand as the coin was picked up, but he didn\u2019t move, didn\u2019t open his eyes.</p><p>It was some time before he realized that he stood alone.</p><p>PART NINE</p><p>Passionn\u00e9ment</p><p>40</p><p>VIRGIN SACRIFICE</p><p>Wilmington, the Colony of North Carolina, September 1, 1769</p><p>This was the third attack, of whatever Lizzie\u2019s sickness was. She had seemed to recover after the first bad fever, and after a day spent regaining her strength, had insisted she was able to travel. They had got no more than a day\u2019s ride north of Charleston, though, before the fever struck again.</p> <p>Brianna had hobbled the horses, and made a hasty camp near a small creek, then made trip after trip through the night, scrabbling up and down a muddy bank in the dark, carrying water in a small canteen to dribble down Lizzie\u2019s throat and over her steaming body. She wasn\u2019t afraid of dark woods or lurking animals, but the thought of Lizzie dying in the wilderness, miles from any sort of help, was terrifying enough to make her want to head straight back to Charleston as soon as Lizzie could sit a horse.</p><p>By morning, however, the fever had broken, and though Lizzie was weak and pale, she had been able to ride. Brianna had hesitated, but finally decided to press on toward Wilmington, rather than turn back. The urge that had driven her all this way now had a sharper spur; she had to find her mother, for Lizzie\u2019s sake as well as her own.</p><p>Brianna hadn\u2019t appreciated her size for most of a life spent looming in the back row of class pictures, but she had begun to feel the advantages of height and strength as she grew older. And the longer she spent in this miserable place, the more advantageous they seemed.</p><p>She braced one arm against the bed frame as she eased the chamber pot out from under Lizzie\u2019s frail white buttocks with the other hand. Lizzie was scrawny but surprisingly heavy, and no more than half conscious; she moaned and twitched restlessly, the twitch suddenly springing into the full-fledged convulsion of a chill.</p><p>The shivering was beginning to ease a little now, though Lizzie\u2019s teeth were still clenched hard enough to make the sharp bones of her jaws stand out like struts beneath her skin.</p><p>Malaria, Brianna thought, for the dozenth time. It must be, to keep coming back like this. A number of small pink welts showed on Lizzie\u2019s neck, reminders of the mosquitoes that had plagued them ever since the Phillip Alonzo drew within sight of land. They had made landfall too far south, and wasted three weeks in meandering through the shallow coastal waters to Charleston, gnawed incessantly by bloodsucking bugs.</p><p>\u201cThere now. Feeling a little better?\u201d</p><p>Lizzie nodded feebly, and tried to smile, succeeding only in looking like a white mouse that had taken poisoned bait.</p><p>\u201cWater, honey. Try a little, just a sip.\u201d Brianna held the cup to Lizzie\u2019s mouth, coaxing. She felt a strange sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu and realized that her voice was the echo of her mother\u2019s, both in words and tone. The realization was oddly comforting, as though her mother somehow stood behind her, speaking through her.</p><p>If it were her mother speaking, though, next would have come the orange-flavored St. Joseph\u2019s aspirin, a tiny pill to be sucked and savored, as much treat as medicine, the aches and fever seeming to subside as quickly as the sweet tart pill dissolved on her tongue. Brianna cast a bleak glance at her saddlebags, bulging in the corner. No aspirin there; Jenny had sent a small bundle of what she called \u201csimples,\u201d but the chamomile and peppermint tea had only made Lizzie vomit.</p><p>Quinine was what you gave people for malaria; that\u2019s what she needed. But she had no idea whether it was even called quinine here, or how it was administered. Malaria was an old disease, though, and quinine came from plants\u2014surely a doctor would have some, whatever it was called?</p><p>Only the hope of finding medical help had kept her going through Lizzie\u2019s second bout. Afraid to stop on the road again, she had taken Lizzie up in front of her, cradling the girl\u2019s body against her as they rode, leading Lizzie\u2019s horse. Lizzie had alternately blazed with heat and shaken with chill, and both of them had arrived in Wilmington limp with exhaustion.</p><p>But here they were, in the midst of Wilmington, and as far from real help as they had ever been. Bree glanced at the bedside table, lips tight. A wadded cloth lay there, dabbled with blood.</p><p>The landlady had taken one look at Lizzie and sent for an apothecary. Despite what her mother had said about the primitive state of medicine and its practitioners here, Brianna had felt a sudden instinctive surge of relief at sight of the man.</p><p>The apothecary was a decently dressed young man with a kindly air and reasonably clean hands. No matter what his state of medical knowledge, he was likely to know as much about fevers as she herself did. More important, she could feel that she wasn\u2019t alone in caring for Lizzie.</p><p>Modesty prompted her to step outside when the apothecary drew down the linen sheet to make his examination, and it was not until she heard a small cry of distress that she flung open the door, to find the young apothecary, fleam in hand, and Lizzie, her face white as chalk, red blood streaming from a cut in the crook of her elbow.</p><p>\u201cBut it is to draw the humors, miss!\u201d the apothecary had pleaded, trying to shield both himself and the body of his patient. \u201cDo you not understand? You must draw the humors! If it is not done, hot bile will toxify within her organs and fill her body entirely, to her certain detriment!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt will be to your certain detriment if you don\u2019t leave,\u201d Brianna had informed him, through clenched teeth. \u201cGet out of here this minute!\u201d</p><p>Medical zeal disappearing in favor of self-preservation, the young man had picked up his case and left with what dignity he could, pausing at the foot of the stairs to shout dire warnings up at her.</p><p>The warnings kept echoing in her ears, between trips downstairs to fill the basin from the kitchen copper. Most of the apothecary\u2019s words were simple ignorance\u2014ranting about humors and bad blood\u2014but there were some that came back with uncomfortable force.</p><p>\u201cIf you will not take heedful advice, miss, you may well condemn your maid to death!\u201d he had called, indignant face upturned in the darkness of the stairwell. \u201cYou do not know how to care for her yourself!\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t. She didn\u2019t even know for sure what Lizzie\u2019s sickness was; the apothecary had called it an \u201cague,\u201d and the landlady had talked of \u201cseasoning.\u201d It was quite common for new immigrants to fall ill repeatedly, exposed as they were to an unfamiliar array of new germs. From the landlady\u2019s unguarded remarks, it seemed apparent that it was also quite common for such immigrants not to survive this seasoning process.</p><p>The basin tilted, slopping hot water over her wrists. Water was the only thing she had. God knew whether the well behind the inn was sanitary or not; better to use the boiling water from the copper and let it cool, even if it took longer. There was cool water in the pitcher; she dribbled a little between Lizzie\u2019s dry, cracked lips, then eased the girl down on the bed. She washed Lizzie\u2019s face and neck, pulled back the quilt and soaked the linen nightdress again, the tiny n**ples showing as dark pink points beneath.</p><p>Lizzie managed a small smile, eyelids drooping, then sank back with a tiny sigh and fell asleep, loose joints relaxing like a rag doll\u2019s.</p><p>Brianna felt as though her own stuffing had been removed as well. She dragged the single stool over to the window and collapsed on it, leaning on the sill in a vain effort to get a breath of fresh air. The atmosphere had lain on them like a thick blanket all the way from Charleston\u2014little wonder that poor Lizzie had crumpled under its weight.</p><p>She scratched uneasily at a bite on her own thigh; the bugs were not nearly as fond of her as they were of Lizzie, but she had suffered a few bites. Malaria wasn\u2019t a danger; she had had the shots for that, as well as for typhoid, cholera, and anything else she could think of. But there was no vaccine for things like dengue fever, or any of a dozen other diseases that haunted the thick air like malevolent spirits. How many of those were spread by biting insects?</p><p>She closed her eyes and leaned her head against the wooden frame, blotting trickles of sweat from her breastbone with the folds of her shirt. She could smell herself; how long had she been wearing these clothes? It didn\u2019t matter; she had been awake for most of two days and two nights, and was too tired to undress, let alone make the effort to wash.</p><p>Lizzie\u2019s fever seemed to have broken\u2014but for how long? If it kept coming back, it was sure to kill the little maidservant; she had already lost all the weight she had gained on the voyage, and her fair skin was beginning to show a yellow tinge in sunlight.</p><p>There was no help to be found in Wilmington. Brianna sat up straight, stretching and feeling the bones of her back pop into place. Tired or not, there was only one thing to do. She had to find her mother, and as quickly as possible. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She would sell the horses and find a boat to take them up the river. Even if the fever came back, she could take care of Lizzie as well on a boat as she could in this hot, smelly little room\u2014and they would still be traveling toward their goal.</p><p>She got up and splashed a little water on her face, twisting her sweat-soaked hair up out of the way. She loosened the crumpled breeches and stepped out of them, making plans in a dreamy, disconnected sort of way.</p><p>A boat, on the river. Surely it would be cooler on the river. No more riding; her thigh muscles ached from four days in the saddle. They would sail to Cross Creek, find Jocasta MacKenzie.</p><p>\u201cAunt,\u201d she murmured, swaying slightly as she reached for the oil-dip lamp. \u201cGreat-aunt Jocasta.\u201d She imagined a kindly white-haired old lady who would greet her with the same joy she had found at Lallybroch. Family. It would be so good to have family again. Roger drifted into her thoughts, as he did so often. She resolutely pushed him out again; time enough to think of him when her mission was accomplished.</p> <p>A tiny cloud of gnats hovered over the flame, and the wall nearby was spattered with the arrowed shapes of moths and lacewings, taking respite from their quest. She pinched out the flame, scarcely hotter than the air in the room, and pulled the shirt off over her head in darkness.</p><p>Jocasta would know exactly where Jamie Fraser and her mother were\u2014would help her get to them. For the first time since stepping through the stones, she thought of Jamie Fraser with neither curiosity nor trepidation. Nothing mattered but finding her mother. Her mother would know what to do for Lizzie; her mother would know how to take care of everything.</p><p>She spread a folded quilt on the floor and lay down nak*d on it. She was asleep in moments, dreaming of the mountains, and clean white snow.</p><p>By the next evening, things looked better. The fever had broken, just as before, leaving Lizzie spent and weak, but clearheaded, and as cool as the climate allowed. Restored by a night\u2019s rest, Brianna had washed her hair and sponge-bathed in the basin, then had paid the landlady to keep an eye on Lizzie while she, dressed in breeches and coat, went about her business.</p><p>It had taken most of the day\u2014and the suffering of a good many widened eyes and gaping mouths as men realized her sex\u2014to sell the horses at what she hoped was an honest price. She had heard of a man named Viorst, who took passengers between Wilmington and Cross Creek in his canoe for a price. She hadn\u2019t found Viorst before dark, though\u2014and wasn\u2019t about to hang around the docks at night, breeches or no breeches. Morning would be time enough.</p> <p>Still more heartening, Lizzie had been downstairs when she returned to the inn toward sunset, being cosseted by the landlady and fed morsels of corn pudding and chicken fricassee.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re better!\u201d Brianna exclaimed. Lizzie nodded, beaming, and gulped her mouthful.</p><p>\u201cI am, so,\u201d she said. \u201cI feel quite myself again, and Mrs. Smoots has been so kind as to let me wash all of our things. Oh, it\u2019s so nice to feel clean again!\u201d she said fervently, laying a pale hand on her kerchief, which looked freshly ironed.</p><p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t be washing and ironing,\u201d Brianna scolded, sliding into the bench beside her maid. \u201cYou\u2019ll wear yourself out, and get sick again.\u201d</p><p>Lizzie looked down her thin nose, a prim smile perched at the corners of her mouth.</p><p>\u201cWell, I didna think ye\u2019d be wanting to meet your Da in clothes all spotted wi\u2019 filth. Not but what even a clarty gown would be better than what ye\u2019ve got on.\u201d The little maid\u2019s eyes passed reprovingly over Brianna\u2019s breeches; she didn\u2019t approve at all of her mistress\u2019s penchant for male costume.</p> <p>\u201cMeet my Da? What do you\u2014Lizzie, have you heard something?\u201d A flare of hope shot up inside her, a sudden bright puff like the lighting of a gas stove.</p><p>Lizzie looked smug.</p><p>\u201cI have that. And \u2019twas all because of the washin\u2019, too\u2014my Da did always say as how virtue brings its reward.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure it does,\u201d Brianna said dryly. \u201cWhat did you find out, and how?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I was just after hanging out your petticoat\u2014the nice one, aye, wi\u2019 the lace about the hem\u2014\u201d</p><p>Brianna picked up a small jug of milk, and held it menacingly over her maid\u2019s head. Lizzie squeaked and ducked away, giggling.</p><p>\u201cAll right! I\u2019m telling! I\u2019m telling!\u201d</p><p>In the middle of her washing, one of the tavern\u2019s patrons had come out into the yard to smoke a pipe, the day being fine. He had admired Lizzie\u2019s domestic skills and taken up a pleasant conversation, in the course of which it was revealed that this gentleman\u2014one Andrew MacNeill by name\u2014 had not only heard of James Fraser but was well acquainted with him.</p> <p>\u201cHe is? What did he say? Is this MacNeill still here?\u201d</p><p>Lizzie put out a hand and made small quelling motions.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sayin\u2019 it as quick as I can. No, he\u2019s not here; I did try to make him stay, but he was bound for New Bern by the packet boat, and couldna bide.\u201d She was nearly as excited as Brianna; her cheeks were still pale and sallow, but the tip of her nose had gone pink.</p><p>\u201cMr. MacNeill knows your Da, and your great-auntie Cameron as well\u2014she\u2019s a great lady, he says, verra rich, with a tremendous great house, and lots of slaves, and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever mind about that now, what did he say about my father? Did he mention my mother?\u201d</p><p>\u201cClaire,\u201d Lizzie said triumphantly. \u201cYe did say that was your Mam\u2019s name? I asked, and he said yes, Mrs. Fraser\u2019s name was Claire. And he said she was a most amazing healer\u2014did ye not say as your mother was a fine physician? He said as he had seen her do a desperate operation on a man, laid him smack in the middle of the dinner table and cut off his ballocks and then stitched them back on, right there on the spot, wi\u2019 all the dinner party lookin\u2019 on!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s my mother, all right.\u201d There were tears of what might have been laughter in the corners of her eyes. \u201cAre they well? Had he seen them lately?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOch, that\u2019s the best of it!\u201d Lizzie leaned forward, eyes big with the importance of her news. \u201cHe\u2019s in Cross Creek\u2014your Da, Mr. Fraser! A man he knows is on trial there for assault, and your Da\u2019s come down to be witness for him.\u201d She patted her handkerchief against her temple, mopping up tiny beads of sweat.</p><p>\u201cMr. MacNeill says the court willna sit again till Monday week because the judge fell ill, and another is coming from Edenton, and the trial canna go on until he arrives.\u201d</p><p>Brianna brushed back a lock of hair and blew out her breath, hardly daring to believe their luck.</p><p>\u201cA week from Monday...and it\u2019s Saturday now. God, I wonder how long it will take to get upriver?\u201d</p><p>Lizzie crossed herself hastily in atonement for her mistress\u2019s casual blasphemy, but shared in her excitement.</p><p>\u201cI dinna ken, but Mrs. Smoots did say as her son\u2019s made the trip once before\u2014we could ask him.\u201d</p><p>Brianna swung round on her bench, looking over the room. Men and boys had begun coming in as darkness fell, stopping for a drink or a supper on their way from work to bed, and now there were fifteen or twenty people crammed into the small space.</p><p>\u201cWhich one is Junior Smoots?\u201d Brianna asked, craning her neck to see through the press of bodies.</p><p>\u201cYonder\u2014the laddie wi\u2019 the sweet brown eyes. I\u2019ll fetch him to ye, shall I?\u201d Emboldened by excitement, Lizzie slipped out of her seat and pushed her way into the throng.</p><p>Brianna was still holding the jug of milk, but made no move to pour it into her cup. Her throat was too choked with excitement to swallow. Little more than a week!</p><p>Wilmington was a small town, Roger thought. How many places could she be? If she was here at all. He thought there was a good chance of it; inquiries in the dockside taverns in New Bern had given him the valuable information that the Phillip Alonzo had reached Charleston safely\u2014and only ten days before the Gloriana had docked in Edenton.</p><p>It might have taken Brianna anything from two days to two weeks to make her way from Charleston to Wilmington\u2014assuming that she was indeed headed there.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s here,\u201d he muttered. \u201cDamn it, I know she\u2019s here!\u201d Whether this conviction was the result of deduction, intuition, hope, or merely stubbornness, he clung to it like a drowning sailor to a spar.</p><p>He had managed the journey from Edenton to Wilmington with a fair amount of ease, himself. Put to work unloading cargo from the Gloriana\u2019s hold, he had carried a chest of tea into a warehouse, set it down, walked back to the door, and busied himself in retying the sweat-soaked kerchief round his head. As soon as the next man had passed him, he stepped out onto the dock, turned right instead of left, and within seconds was headed up the narrow cobbled lane that led from docks to town. By the next morning he\u2019d found a berth as loader on a small cargo boat, transporting naval stores from Edenton to the main depot at Wilmington, there to be transferred to a larger ship for transport to England.</p><p>He jumped ship again in Wilmington, without a moment\u2019s compunction. He hadn\u2019t time to waste; there was Brianna to be found.</p><p>He knew she was here. Fraser\u2019s Ridge was in the mountains; she\u2019d need a guide, and Wilmington was the most likely port in which to find one. And if she was here, someone would have noticed her; he\u2019d bet money on that. He could only hope the wrong sort of person hadn\u2019t noticed her already.</p><p>A quick reconnoiter of the main street and the harbor gave him a count of twenty-three taverns. Christ, these people drank like fish! There was the chance she\u2019d taken a room in a private house, but the taverns were the place to start.</p><p>By evening he\u2019d covered ten of the taverns, slowed by the necessity of avoiding any of his erstwhile shipmates. Being in the presence of so much drink, and he without an extra penny to spend, had given him a raging thirst. He hadn\u2019t eaten all day, either, which didn\u2019t help matters.</p><p>At the same time, he scarcely noticed the physical discomfort. A man in the fifth tavern had seen her, so had a woman in the seventh. \u201cA tall man wi\u2019 red hair,\u201d the man had said, but \u201cA great huge girl, dressed in men\u2019s breeches,\u201d the woman had said, clicking her tongue in shock. \u201cWalkin\u2019 down the street, plain as you please, with her coat over her arm and her backside in view of everyone!\u201d</p><p>Let Roger get that particular backside in his view, he thought with some grimness, and he\u2019d know what to do with it. He begged a cup of water from a kindhearted landlady, and set off with renewed determination.</p><p>By the time it was full dark, he had covered another five taverns. The taprooms were full now, and he discovered that the tall redheaded girl in men\u2019s clothing had been causing public comment for nearly a week. The quality of some of this comment caused the blood to throb in his cheeks with outrage, and only the fear of being arrested kept him from outright assault.</p><p>As it was, he left the fifteenth tavern after an ugly exchange of words with two drunkards, boiling with fury. Christ, had the woman no sense at all? Did she have no notion what men were capable of?</p><p>He stopped in the street and wiped a sleeve across his sweating face. He breathed heavily, wondering what to do next. Keep on, he supposed, though if he didn\u2019t find something to eat soon, he was going to fall flat on his face in the road. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The Blue Bull, he decided. He\u2019d glanced into the shed there as he passed earlier, and seen a good pile of clean straw. He\u2019d spend a penny or two for dinner, and perhaps the owner would let him sleep in the stable for the sake of Christian kindness.</p><p>Turning, his eye caught sight of a sign on the house across the road.</p><p>WILMINGTON GAZETTEER, JNO. GILLETTE. PROP., it read. Wilmington\u2019s newspaper; one of the few in the Colony of North Carolina. One too many, if you asked Roger. He fought the urge to pick up a rock and hurl it through Jno. Gillette\u2019s window. Instead, he yanked the sodden band off his head and, making an effort to tidy himself into some semblance of decency, turned toward the river and the Blue Bull.</p><p>She was there.</p> <p>She was sitting by the hearth, her tailed hair sparking in the firelight, engaged in conversation with a young man whose smile Roger wanted to wipe off forcibly. Instead, he slammed the door behind him with a crash and started toward her. She turned, startled, and stared blankly at the bearded stranger. Recognition flashed in her eyes, then joy, and a huge smile spread across her face.</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s you.\u201d Then her eyes changed, as realization flared up like a brushfire. She screamed. It was a good full-bodied scream, and every head in the tavern snapped round at the sound of it.</p><p>\u201cDamn you!\u201d He lunged across the table, and got her by the arm. \u201cWhat the devil do you think you\u2019re doing?\u201d</p><p>Her face had gone dead white, her eyes round and dark with shock. She jerked away, trying to free herself.</p><p>\u201cLet go!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat I won\u2019t! You\u2019ll come with me, and ye\u2019ll do it this moment!\u201d</p><p>Sidling round the table, he got hold of her other arm, jerked her up, whirled her around and pushed her in front of him toward the door.</p><p>\u201cMacKenzie!\u201d Damn, it was one of the seamen from the cargo boat. Roger glowered at the man, willing him to keep out of it. Luckily the man was both smaller and older than Roger; he hesitated, but then took courage from the company and lifted his chin pugnaciously.</p><p>\u201cWhat you doing to the lass, MacKenzie? Leave her be!\u201d There was a stir among the crowd, men turning from their drinks, attracted by the uproar. He had to get out of here now, or he wouldn\u2019t get out at all.</p><p>\u201cTell them it\u2019s all right, tell them you know me!\u201d he whispered into Brianna\u2019s ear.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right.\u201d Brianna spoke, voice husky with shock, but loud enough to be heard over the growing hubbub. \u201cIt\u2019s all right. I\u2014I know him.\u201d The seaman dropped back a little, still dubious. A scrawny young girl in the inglenook had gotten to her feet; she looked frightened to death, but bravely clutched a stone ale bottle in one fist, evidently intending to hit Roger with it, if necessary. Her high-pitched voice rang out above the suspicious grumble of voices.</p> <p>\u201cMiss Bree! Ye\u2019ll not go wi\u2019 yon black villain, surely?\u201d</p><p>Brianna made a sound that might have been laughter, choked by hysteria. Reaching up, she dug her nails hard into the back of his hand. Startled by the pain, he loosened his grip and she yanked her arm out of his grasp.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right,\u201d she repeated, more firmly to the room at large. \u201cI know him.\u201d She made a small shooing gesture at the girl. \u201cLizzie, go on up to bed. I\u2019ll\u2014I\u2019ll be back later.\u201d She whirled on her bootheel and headed for the door, walking fast. Roger gave the taproom a menacing glare, to discourage anyone who thought of interfering, and followed her.</p><p>She was waiting right outside the door; her fingers sank into his arm with a fierceness that might have been gratifying were it prompted solely by joy at seeing him. He doubted it.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He detached her fingers and gripped them firmly.</p><p>\u201cNot here,\u201d he snapped. He took her arm and dragged her a little way down the road, to the shelter of a big horse-chestnut tree. The sky still glowed with the remnants of twilight, but the drooping branches reached nearly to the ground, and it was dark enough underneath to hide them from any curious souls who thought of venturing after them.</p><p>She whirled on him the instant they reached its shadows.</p> <p>\u201cWhat are you doing here, for God\u2019s sake?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLooking for you, ye wee fool! And what in the name of all holy are you doing here? And dressed like that, God damn you!\u201d He\u2019d had the briefest look at her in her breeches and shirt, but it was enough.</p><p>In her own time, the clothes would have been so baggy as to be sexless. After months of seeing women in long skirts and arisaids, though, the blatant division of her legs, the sheer bloody length of thigh and curve of calf, seemed so outrageous that he wanted to wrap a sheet around her.</p><p>\u201cBloody woman! You might as well walk down the street nak*d!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be an idiot! What are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you\u2014looking for you.\u201d</p><p>He took her by the shoulders, then, and kissed her, hard. Fear, anger, and the sheer relief of finding her were fused at once into a solid bolt of desire, and he found he was shaking with it. So was she. She was clinging to him, shaking in his arms.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right,\u201d he whispered to her. He buried his mouth in her hair. \u201cIt\u2019s all right, I\u2019m here. I\u2019ll take care of you.\u201d</p><p>She jerked upright, out of his arms.</p><p>\u201cAll right?\u201d she cried. \u201cHow can you say that? For God\u2019s sake, you\u2019re here!\u201d</p><p>There was no mistaking the horror in her voice. He grabbed her by the arm.</p><p>\u201cAnd where the hell else should I be, with you tearing off into f**king nowhere and risking your bloody neck, and\u2014why the hell did you do it?!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m looking for my parents. What else would I be doing here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that, for God\u2019s sake! I mean why in hell did you not tell me what you meant to do?\u201d</p><p>She jerked her arm out of his grasp and gave him a healthy shove in the chest that all but sent him staggering.</p><p>\u201cBecause you wouldn\u2019t have let me go, that\u2019s why! You\u2019d have tried to stop me, and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn right I would! God, I\u2019d have locked you in a room, or tied you hand and foot! Of all the flea-brained notions\u2014\u201d</p><p>She hit him, a full-palmed slap that caught him hard across the cheekbone.</p><p>\u201cShut up!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBloody woman! D\u2019ye expect me to let you go off into\u2014into nothing, and I sit at home twiddling my thumbs while you\u2019re having your womb paraded on a pike in the marketplace? What sort of man d\u2019ye think I am?\u201d</p><p>He felt her movement rather than saw it, and grabbed her wrist before she could slap him again.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m in no mood for that, girl! Hit me once more, and by Christ, I will do you violence!\u201d</p><p>She folded her other hand into a fist and punched him in the belly, quick as a striking snake.</p><p>He wanted to hit her back. Instead, he grabbed her, and with a handful of her hair wrapped round his fist, kissed her as hard as he could.</p><p>She squirmed and struggled against him, making strangled noises, but he didn\u2019t stop. Then she was kissing him back, and they sank to their knees together. Her arms came round his neck as he bore her down beneath him to the leaf-matted ground beneath the tree. Then she was crying in his arms, choking and gasping, tears running down her face as she clutched him.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d she sobbed. \u201cWhy did you have to follow me? Didn\u2019t you realize? Now what are we going to do!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo? Do about what?\u201d He couldn\u2019t tell whether she was crying from anger or fear\u2014both, he thought.</p><p>She stared up at him through strands of tangled hair.</p><p>\u201cGetting back! You have to have somebody to go to\u2014somebody you care for. You\u2019re the only person I love at that end\u2014or you were! How am I going to get back, if you\u2019re here? And how will you get back, if I\u2019m here?\u201d</p><p>He stopped dead, fear and anger both forgotten, and his hands clamped tight on her wrists to stop her hitting him again.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why? That\u2019s why you wouldn\u2019t tell me? Because you love me? Jesus Christ!\u201d</p><p>He let go of her wrists and lay on top of her instead. He grabbed her face with both hands and tried to kiss her again. She gave a sudden snap of her hips, swung her legs up on either side, and scissored him neatly across the back, crushing his ribs.</p><p>He rolled, breaking the hold, and brought her with him, ending on his back, with her on top. He got a hand in her hair and drew her face down to his panting.</p><p>\u201cStop,\u201d he said. \u201cChrist, what is this, a wrestling match?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet go of my hair.\u201d She shook her head, trying to dislodge his grip. \u201cI hate having my hair pulled.\u201d</p><p>He let go of her hair, and slid his hand up the length of her neck, fingers curled round the slender nape, a thumb resting on the pulse in her throat. It was going like a trip-hammer; so was his.</p><p>\u201cRight, how are ye on being choked?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t like it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeither do I. Get your arm off my neck, aye?\u201d</p><p>Very slowly, her weight eased back. He still felt short of breath, but not from being choked. He didn\u2019t want to let go of her neck. Not from fear of her cutting loose again, but because he couldn\u2019t bear to lose the feel of her. It had been too long.</p><p>She reached up and took hold of his wrist, but didn\u2019t pull his hand away. He felt her swallow.</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d he whispered. \u201cSay it. I want to hear it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...love...you,\u201d she said, between her teeth. \u201cGot it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, I\u2019ve got it.\u201d He took her face between his hands, very gently, and drew her down. She came, arms trembling and giving way beneath her.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sure?\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cYes. What are we going to do?\u201d she said, and began to cry.</p><p>\u201cWe.\u201d She\u2019d said we. She\u2019d said she was sure.</p><p>Roger lay in the dust of the road, bruised, filthy, and starving, with a woman trembling and weeping against his chest, now and then giving him a small thump with her fist. He had never felt happier in his life.</p><p>\u201cHush,\u201d he whispered, half rocking her. \u201cIt\u2019s all right; there\u2019s another way. We\u2019ll get back; I know how. Don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll take care of you.\u201d</p><p>Finally, she wore herself out, and lay still in the crook of his arm, sniffling and hiccuping. There was a large wet spot on the front of his shirt. The crickets in the tree, startled into silence by the uproar, cautiously resumed their songs overhead.</p><p>She freed herself and sat up, fumbling in the dark.</p><p>\u201cI have to blow my dose,\u201d she said thickly. \u201cDo you have a hadky?\u201d</p><p>He gave her the damp rag he used to tie back his hair. She made whooshing noises, and he smiled in the dark.</p><p>\u201cYou sound like a can of shaving cream.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd when was the last time you saw one of those?\u201d She lay down on him again, head tucked into the curve of his shoulder, and reached up to touch his jaw. He\u2019d shaved two days ago; there had been neither time nor opportunity since.</p><p>Her hair still smelled faintly of grass, though no longer of artificial flowers. It must be her natural scent.</p><p>She sighed deeply, tightened her arm around him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she said. \u201cI didn\u2019t want you to come after me. But...Roger, I\u2019m awfully glad you\u2019re here!\u201d</p><p>He kissed her temple; she was damp and salty with sweat and tears.</p><p>\u201cSo am I,\u201d he said, and for the moment all the trials and dangers of the past two months seemed insignificant. All but one.</p><p>\u201cHow long have you been planning this?\u201d he asked. He thought he could have told her, to the day. Since her letters had begun to change.</p> <p>\u201cOh...about six months,\u201d she said, confirming his guess. \u201cIt was when I went to Jamaica during last Easter vacation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye?\u201d To Jamaica, instead of to Scotland. She\u2019d asked him to join her, and he\u2019d refused, foolishly hurt that she hadn\u2019t planned to come to him automatically.</p><p>She took a deep breath and let it out, blotting the neck of her shirt against her skin.</p><p>\u201cI kept dreaming,\u201d she said. \u201cAbout my father. Fathers. Both of them.\u201d</p><p>The dreams were little more than fragments; vivid glimpses of Frank Randall\u2019s face, longer stretches now and then, in which she saw her mother. And now and then a tall, red-haired man whom she knew to be the father she had never seen.</p> <p>\u201cThere was one dream in particular...\u201d It had been night in the dream, somewhere tropical, with fields of tall green plants that might have been sugarcane, and fires burning in the distance.</p><p>\u201cThere were drums beating, and I knew something was hiding, waiting in the canes; something horrible,\u201d she said. \u201cMy mother was there, drinking tea with a crocodile.\u201d Roger grunted, and her voice grew sharper. \u201cIt was a dream, all right?</p><p>\u201cThen he stepped out of the canes. I couldn\u2019t see his face very well, because it was dark, but I could see that he had red hair; there were copper glints when he turned his head.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas he the dreadful thing in the canes?\u201d Roger asked.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He could hear the susurrus of her hair as she shook her head. It had gone quite dark by now, and she was little more than a comforting weight on his chest, a soft voice beside him, speaking from the shadows.</p><p>\u201cHe was standing between my mother and the awful thing. I couldn\u2019t see it, but I knew it was there, waiting.\u201d She gave a small, involuntary shudder and Roger tightened his hold on her.</p> <p>\u201cThen I knew my mother was going to stand up and walk right toward it. I tried to stop her, but I couldn\u2019t make her hear me or see me. So I turned to him, and I called to him to go with her\u2014to save her from whatever it was. And he saw me!\u201d The hand on his arm squeezed tight. \u201cHe did, he saw me, and he heard me. And then I woke up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye?\u201d Roger said skeptically. \u201cAnd this made you go to Jamaica, and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt made me think,\u201d she said sharply. \u201cYou\u2019d looked; you couldn\u2019t find them anywhere in Scotland after 1766, and you couldn\u2019t find them on any of the emigration rolls to the Colonies. That was when you said you thought we should give up; that there wasn\u2019t any more we could find out.\u201d</p><p>Roger was glad of the darkness that hid his guilt. He kissed the top of her head, quickly.</p><p>\u201cBut I wondered; the place I saw them in the dream was in the tropics. What if they were in the Indies?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI looked,\u201d Roger said. \u201cI checked the passenger rolls of every ship that left Edinburgh or London in the late 1760s and \u201970s\u2014headed for anyplace. I did tell you,\u201d he added, an edge in his voice.</p><p>\u201cI know that,\u201d she said, with a matching edge. \u201cBut what if they weren\u2019t passengers? Why did people go to the Indies then\u2014 now, I mean?\u201d She caught herself, voice cracking a little in realization.</p><p>\u201cFor trade, mostly.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cRight. So what if they went on a cargo ship? They wouldn\u2019t show up on the passenger rolls.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d he said slowly. \u201cRight, they wouldn\u2019t. But then how would you look for them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWarehouse registers, plantation account books, port manifests. I spent the whole vacation in libraries and museums. And\u2014and I found them,\u201d she said, with a small catch in her voice.</p><p>Christ, she\u2019d seen the notice.</p><p>\u201cAye?\u201d he said, striving for calmness.</p><p>She laughed, a little tremulously.</p><p>\u201cA Captain James Fraser, of a ship named Artemis, sold five tons of bat guano to a planter in Montego Bay on April 2, 1767.\u201d</p><p>Roger couldn\u2019t help a grunt of amusement, but at the same time, couldn\u2019t help objecting.</p><p>\u201cAye, but a ship\u2019s captain? After all your mother said about the man\u2019s seasickness? And not to be discouraging, but there must be literally hundreds of James Frasers; how could you possibly know\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere might; but on April the first, a woman named Claire Fraser bought a slave from the slave market in Kingston.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know why,\u201d Brianna said firmly, \u201cbut I\u2019m sure she had a good reason.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, sure, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe papers gave the slave\u2019s name as \u2018Temeraire,\u2019 and described him as having one arm. Makes him stand out, doesn\u2019t it? Anyway, I started looking through collections of old newspapers; not just from the Indies, from all the southern colonies, looking for that name\u2014my mother wouldn\u2019t keep a slave; if she bought him, she\u2019d free him somehow, and the notices of manumission were sometimes printed in the local papers. I thought I could maybe find where the slave was freed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd did you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She was quiet for a minute. \u201cI\u2014I found something else. A notice of their...deaths. My parents.\u201d</p><p>Even knowing that she must have found it, to hear it from her lips was still a shock. He pulled her tight against him, wrapping his arms around her.</p><p>\u201cWhere?\u201d he said softly. \u201cHow?\u201d</p><p>He should have known better. He wasn\u2019t listening to her half-choked explanation; he was too busy cursing himself. He should have known she was too stubborn to be dissuaded. All he\u2019d done with his fatheaded interference was to drive her into secrecy. And it had been he who\u2019d paid for that\u2014in months of worry.</p><p>\u201cBut we\u2019re in time,\u201d she said. \u201cIt said 1776; we\u2019ve got time to find them.\u201d She sighed hugely. \u201cI\u2019m so glad you\u2019re here. I was so worried you\u2019d find out before I could get back and I didn\u2019t know what you\u2019d do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat I did do....You know,\u201d he said conversationally, \u201cI have a friend with a two-year-old child. He says that he\u2019d never in life condone child abuse\u2014but by God, he understands what makes people do it. I feel very much the same about wife beating just now.\u201d</p><p>There was a small quiver of laughter from the heavy weight on his chest.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean by that?\u201d</p><p>He slid a hand down her back and got a firm grip on one round buttock. She wore no underclothes beneath the loose breeches.</p><p>\u201cI mean that were I a man of this time, instead of my own, nothing would give me greater pleasure than to lay my belt across your arse a dozen times or so.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t seem to consider this a serious threat. In fact, he thought she was laughing.</p><p>\u201cSo since you\u2019re not from this time, you wouldn\u2019t do it? Or you would, but you wouldn\u2019t enjoy it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019d enjoy it,\u201d he assured her. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing I\u2019d like better than to take a stick to you.\u201d</p><p>She was laughing.</p><p>Suddenly furious, he shoved her off and sat up.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you\u2019d found someone else! Your letters, the last few months...and then that last one. I was sure of it. It\u2019s that I want to beat you for\u2014not for lying to me or going off without telling me\u2014for making me think I\u2019d lost you!\u201d</p><p>She was silent for a moment. Her hand came out of darkness and touched his face, very softly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she said quietly. \u201cI never meant for you to think that. I only wanted to keep you from finding out, until it was too late.\u201d Her head turned toward him, silhouetted by the faint light from the road outside their refuge. \u201cHow did you find out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour boxes. They came to the college.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? But I told them not to send those until the end of May, when you\u2019d be in Scotland!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would have been; only for a last-minute conference that kept me in Oxford. They came the day before I left.\u201d</p><p>There was a sudden spill of light and noise as the door of the tavern opened, disgorging a knot of patrons into the road. Voices and footsteps passed by their refuge, startlingly close. Neither of them spoke until the sounds had disappeared. In the renewed silence, he heard the sound of a conker falling through the leaves, to bounce on the leaves nearby.</p><p>Brianna\u2019s voice was oddly husky.</p><p>\u201cYou thought I\u2019d found somebody else...and you still came after me?\u201d</p><p>He sighed, anger gone as suddenly as it had come, and wiped the damp hair off his face.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d have come if you were married to the King of Siam. Bloody woman.\u201d</p><p>She was no more than a pale blur in the darkness; he saw the brief movement as she leaned to pick up the fallen conker, and sat toying with it. Finally, she drew a very deep breath and let it out slowly.</p><p>\u201cYou said wife beating.\u201d</p><p>He paused. The crickets had stopped again.</p><p>\u201cYou said you were sure. Did you mean it?\u201d</p><p>There was a silence, long enough to fill a heartbeat, long enough to fill forever.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said softly.</p><p>\u201cIn Inverness, I said\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said you\u2019d have me all\u2014or not at all. And I said I understood. I\u2019m sure.\u201d</p><p>Her shirt had pulled free of her breeches in their struggle, and billowed loose around her in the faint hot breeze. He reached under the floating hem and touched bare skin, which rippled into gooseflesh at his touch. He pulled her close, ran his hands over bare back and bare shoulders under the cloth, buried his face in her hair, her neck, exploring, asking with his hands\u2014did she mean it?</p><p>She gripped his shoulders and leaned back, urging him. Yes, she did. He answered, wordless, opening the front of her shirt, spreading it apart. Her br**sts were white and soft.</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d she said. Her hand was at the back of his head, pulling him toward her. \u201cPlease!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I take you now, it\u2019s for always,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>She scarcely breathed, but stood stock-still, letting his hands go where they would.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said.</p><p>The tavern door opened again, startling them apart. He let her go and stood up, reaching down a hand to help her, then stood with her hand in his, waiting while the voices receded into distance.</p><p>\u201cCome on,\u201d he said, and ducked under the drooping branches.</p><p>The shed was some distance from the tavern, dark and quiet. They stopped outside, waiting, but there was no sound from the back of the inn; all the windows on the upper floor were dark.</p><p>\u201cI hope Lizzie\u2019s gone to bed.\u201d</p><p>He wondered dimly who Lizzie was, but didn\u2019t care. At this distance he could see her face clearly, though the night washed all color from her skin. She looked like a harlequin, he thought; white cheek planes slashed by leaf shadows, framed by the dark of her hair, her eyes black triangles set above a dash of vivid mouth. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He took her hand in his, palm to palm.</p><p>\u201cD\u2019ye know what handfasting is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot exactly. Sort of a temporary marriage?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA bit. In the Isles and the remoter parts of the Highlands, where folk were a long way from the nearest minister, a man and a woman now would be handfast; vowed to each other for a year and a day. At the end of it, they find a minister and wed more permanently\u2014or they go their own ways.\u201d</p> <p>Her hand tightened in his.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want anything temporary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeither do I. But I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll find a minister easily. There are no churches here yet; the nearest minister is likely in New Bern.\u201d He lifted their linked hands. \u201cI did say I wanted it all, and if ye did not care enough to wed me...\u201d</p><p>Her hand tightened, hard.</p><p>\u201cI do.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAll right.\u201d</p><p>He took a deep breath and began.</p><p>\u201cI, Roger Jeremiah, do take thee, Brianna Ellen, to be my lawful wedded wife. With my goods I thee endow, with my body I thee worship...\u201d Her hand twitched in his, and his balls tightened. Whoever had worded this vow had understood, all right.</p><p>\u201c...in sickness and in health, in richness and in poverty, so long as we both shall live.\u201d</p><p>If I make a vow like that, I\u2019ll keep it\u2014no matter what it costs me. Was she thinking of that now?</p><p>She brought their linked hands down together, and spoke with great deliberation.</p> <p>\u201cI, Brianna Ellen, take thee, Roger Jeremiah...\u201d Her voice was scarcely louder than the beating of his own heart, but he heard every word. A breeze came through the tree, rattling the leaves, lifting her hair.</p><p>\u201c...as long as we both shall live.\u201d</p><p>The phrase meant a good bit more to each of them now, he thought, than it would have even a few months before. The passage through the stones was enough to impress anyone with the fragility of life.</p><p>There was a moment\u2019s silence, broken only by the rustle of leaves overhead and a distant murmur of voices from the tavern\u2019s taproom. He raised her hand to his mouth and kissed it, on the knuckle of her fourth finger, where one day\u2014God willing\u2014her ring would be.</p><p>It was more of a large shed than a barn, though some beast\u2014a horse or mule\u2014stirred in its stall at one end. There was a strong, clean tang of hops in the air, enough to overpower the milder scents of hay and manure; the Blue Bull brewed its own ale. Roger felt drunk, but not from alcohol.</p><p>The shed was very dark, and undressing her was both frustration and delight.</p><p>\u201cAnd I thought it took blind people years to develop a keen sense of touch,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>The warm breath of her laugh brushed his neck, making the tiny hairs at his nape stir and prickle.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re sure it\u2019s not like the poem about the five blind men and the elephant?\u201d she said. Her own hand groped, found the opening of his shirt, and slid inside.</p><p>\u201c \u2018No, the beast is like a wall,\u2019 \u201d she quoted. Her fingers curved and flattened, curiously exploring the sensitive flesh around his nipple. \u201cA wall with hair. Goodness, a wall with goose bumps, too.\u201d</p><p>She laughed again, and he bent his head, finding her mouth on the first try, sightless and unerring as a bat snatching a moth from the air.</p><p>\u201cAmphora,\u201d he murmured against the wide, sweet curve of her lips. His hands slid over the wide, sweet curve of her hips, cupping smoothness cool and solid, timeless and graceful as the swell of ancient pottery, promising abundance. \u201cLike a Grecian vase. God, you\u2019ve got the most beautiful arse!\u201d</p><p>\u201cJug-butt, huh?\u201d</p><p>She vibrated against him, the quiver of laughter passing from her lips to his and into his bloodstream like infection. Her hand slid down his own hip, and up, long fingers fumbling loose the flap of his breeches, groping hesitantly and then more surely, gradually rucking his shirt up to disentangle him from the layers of fabric.</p><p>\u201c \u2018No, the beast is like a rope\u2019...oops...\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop laughing, damn you.\u201d</p><p>\u201c...like a snake...no...well, maybe a cobra...gosh, what would you call that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had a friend once who called it \u2018Mr. Happy,\u2019 \u201d Roger said, feeling light-headed, \u201cbut that\u2019s a bit whimsical for my tastes.\u201d He grabbed her by the arms and kissed her again, long enough to put a stop to any further comparisons.</p><p>She was still quivering, but he didn\u2019t think it was laughter. He slid his arms around her and pulled her closely against him, amazed as always by the sheer size of her\u2014a good deal more amazed now that she was nak*d, those complex planes of bone and muscle transformed to immediate sensation in his arms.</p><p>He paused for breath. He wasn\u2019t sure whether the sensation was more akin to drowning or to mountain climbing, but whatever it was, there wasn\u2019t much oxygen left between them.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never been able to kiss a girl without stooping before,\u201d he said, making conversation in hopes of getting his breath back.</p><p>\u201cOh, good; we wouldn\u2019t want you to have a stiff neck.\u201d The quiver was back in her voice, and it definitely was laughter, though he thought it stemmed as much from nervousness as humor.</p><p>\u201cHa ha,\u201d he said, and grabbed her again, oxygen be damned. Her br**sts were high and round, pressed against his chest with that unique mixture of softness and firmness that so intrigued him whenever he touched her. One of her hands slid hesitantly between them, groping, then withdrew.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t bring himself to stop kissing her long enough to finish undressing, but arched his back to let her push the breeches down over his hips. They were loose enough to fall in a puddle around his feet, and he stepped free of them, still holding her, only making a small noise in his throat when her hand came back between them.</p><p>She had eaten onions with her dinner. Blindness sharpened not only touch, but taste and smell as well. He tasted roast meat, and sour ale, and bread. And a faint sweet taste that he couldn\u2019t identify, that reminded him somehow of green meadows full of waving grass. Did he taste it, or smell it in her hair? He couldn\u2019t tell; he seemed to be losing track of his senses as he lost the boundaries between them, breathing her breath, feeling her heart beat as though it lay in his own chest.</p><p>She was grasping him a trifle too tightly for comfort, and he broke the kiss at last, breathing heavily.</p><p>\u201cWould you consider letting go for a moment? I grant you, it\u2019s an effective handle, but it\u2019s got better uses.\u201d</p><p>Instead of letting go, she dropped to her knees.</p><p>Roger made a slight move back, startled.</p><p>\u201cChrist, are you sure you want to do that?\u201d He wasn\u2019t sure whether he hoped she did or not. Her hair tickled against his thighs, and his c*ck was quivering, desperate for engulfment. At the same time, he didn\u2019t want to frighten or repulse her.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you want me to?\u201d Her hands moved up the backs of his thighs, tentative and ticklish. He could feel every hair on his body spring erect, from knees to waist. It made him feel like a satyr, goat-legged and reeking.</p><p>\u201cWell...yes. But I haven\u2019t bathed in days,\u201d he said, rather awkwardly trying to detach himself.</p><p>Deliberately, she brushed her nose over his stomach and down, inhaling deeply. His skin pebbled with gooseflesh, the shiver having nothing to do with the temperature of the room.</p><p>\u201cYou smell good,\u201d she whispered. \u201cLike some kind of big male animal.\u201d</p><p>He grasped her head hard, fingers twisted in the thick, silky hair.</p><p>\u201cToo right about that,\u201d he whispered. Her hand rested on his wrist, light and warm\u2014God, she was warm.</p><p>Without his actually intending it, his grip loosened; he felt the fall of her hair brush his thighs and then stopped thinking anything coherent, as all of the blood left his brain, heading south at a high rate of speed.</p><p>\u201cMi oing i\u2019 i\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d He came out of his daze a few moments later as she drew back, brushing the hair away from her face.</p><p>\u201cI said, am I doing it right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Ah...I think so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think so? You don\u2019t know for sure?\u201d Brianna seemed to have been regaining her composure as fast as Roger had been losing his; he could hear the suppressed laughter in her voice.</p><p>\u201cWell...no,\u201d he said. \u201cI mean, I haven\u2019t...that is, no one\u2019s...yeah, I think so.\u201d He had hold of her head again, urging her gently forward.</p><p>He thought she was making a low humming noise, somewhere deep in her throat. It might be his own blood, though, thrumming through distended veins, purling in violent eddies like the trapped water of the ocean, seething through the rocks. Another minute, and he was going off like a waterspout.</p><p>He pulled away and before she could protest, lifted her to her feet, then urged her down, onto the heap of straw where he had thrown her clothes.</p><p>His eyes had adjusted to the dark, but the starlight from the window was still so faint that he could see no more of her than shapes and outlines, white as marble. Not cold, though; not cold at all.</p><p>He approached his own duty with mingled excitement and caution; he had tried this exactly once, only to be met with a faceful of a feminine hygiene product that smelled like the flowers in his father\u2019s church on Sunday\u2014an off-putting idea if ever there was one.</p><p>Brianna was not hygienic. The scent of her was enough to make him want to dispense with any preliminaries and throw himself on her in a pure abandonment of lust.</p><p>Instead, he breathed deeply, and kissed her just above the dark smudge of curls.</p><p>\u201cDamn,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d She sounded faintly alarmed. \u201cDo I smell terrible?\u201d</p><p>He closed his eyes and breathed. His head was spinning slightly, and he felt giddy with a combination of lust and laughter.</p><p>\u201cNo. It\u2019s only that I\u2019ve been wondering for more than a year what color your hair is here.\u201d He tugged gently on the curls. \u201cNow here I am face-to-face with it, and I still can\u2019t tell.\u201d</p><p>She giggled, the vibration making her belly shake gently under his hand.</p><p>\u201cDo you want me to tell you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, let me be surprised in the morning.\u201d He bent his head to his work, surprised now by the amazing variety of textures, all in such a small space\u2014a smoothness like glass, tickling roughness, a yielding rubberiness, and that sudden slippery slickness, musk and tang and salt together.</p><p>After a few moments, he felt her hands come to rest gently on his head, as though in benediction. He hoped the stubble of his beard wasn\u2019t hurting her, but she didn\u2019t seem to mind. A subterranean quiver ran through the warm flesh of her thighs and she made a small sound that made a similar quiver dart through his belly.</p><p>\u201cAm I doing it right?\u201d he inquired half jokingly, lifting his head.</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah,\u201d she said softly. \u201cYou sure are.\u201d Her hands tightened in his hair.</p><p>He had started to lower his head again, but jerked it up at this, staring up across the dim white reaches of her body toward the pale oval of her face.</p><p>\u201cAnd just how the hell do you know that?\u201d he asked. His only answer was a deep, gurgling laugh. Then he was beside her, with no real notion how he\u2019d got there, his mouth on her mouth, the length of his body pressed to hers, aware only of the heat of her, burning like fever. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She tasted of him, and he of her, and God help him, he wasn\u2019t going to be able to go slowly.</p><p>He did, though. She was eager, but awkward, trying to lift her h*ps to him, touching him too quickly, too lightly. He took her hands, one at a time, and placed them flat against his chest. Her palms were hot, and his n**ples tightened.</p><p>\u201cFeel my heart,\u201d he said. His voice sounded thick to his own ears. \u201cTell me if it stops.\u201d</p><p>He hadn\u2019t actually meant to be funny, and was faintly surprised when she gave a nervous laugh. The laugh disappeared as he touched her. Her hands tightened on his chest; then he felt her relax, opening her legs to him.</p> <p>\u201cI love you,\u201d he murmured. \u201cOh, Bree, I do love you.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t answer, but a hand floated up from the dark and lay along his cheek, gentle as a tendril of seaweed. She kept it there while he took her, laid open in trust, while her other hand held his beating heart.</p><p>He felt more drunk than before. Not groggy or sleepy, though; alive to everything. He could smell his own sweat; he could smell hers, smell the faint tang of fear that tinged her desire.</p><p>He closed his eyes and breathed. Tightened his grip on her shoulders. Pressed slowly. Slid in. Felt her tear and bit his own lip, hard enough to draw blood.</p><p>Her fingernails dug into his chest.</p> <p>\u201cGo on!\u201d she whispered.</p><p>One sharp hard thrust, and he possessed her.</p><p>He stayed that way, eyes closed, breathing. Balanced on an edge of pleasure sharp enough to cause him pain. Dimly he wondered if the pain he felt was hers.</p><p>\u201cRoger?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you...really big, do you think?\u201d Her voice was slightly tremulous.</p> <p>\u201cAh...\u201d He groped for remnants of coherence. \u201cAbout the usual.\u201d A flash of concern penetrated the feelings of drunkenness. \u201cAm I hurting you a lot?\u201d</p><p>\u201cN-no, not exactly. Just...can you not move for a minute?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA minute, an hour. All my life, if you want.\u201d He thought it would kill him not to move, and would have died gladly.</p><p>Her hands moved slowly down his back, touching his buttocks. He shivered and ducked his head, eyes closed, painting her face before his mind\u2019s eye with a dozen small and mindless kisses.</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d She whispered in his ear, and like an automaton he began to move, as slowly as he could, restrained as he went by the pressure of her hand on his back.</p><p>She stiffened very slightly and relaxed, stiffened and relaxed, he knew he was hurting her, did it again, he ought to stop, she lifted up against him, taking him, and there was a deep and bestial noise that he must have made, now, it had to be now, he had to...</p><p>Shaking and gasping like a landed fish, he jerked free of her body and lay on her, feeling her br**sts crushed against him as he jerked and moaned.</p><p>Then he lay still, no longer drunk but wrapped in guilty peace, and felt her arms around him and the warm breath of the whisper in his ear.</p> <p>\u201cI love you,\u201d she said, her voice husky in the hop-scented air. \u201cStay with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll my life,\u201d he said, and wrapped his arms around her.</p><p>They lay peacefully together, welded with the sweat of their efforts, listening to each other breathe. Roger stirred at last, lifting his face from her hair, his limbs at once weightless and heavy as lead.</p><p>\u201cAll right, love?\u201d he whispered. \u201cHave I hurt you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but I didn\u2019t mind.\u201d Her hand passed lightly down the length of his back, making him shiver despite the heat. \u201cWas it all right? Did I do it right?\u201d She sounded faintly anxious.</p><p>\u201cOh, God!\u201d He bent his head and kissed her, long and lingering. She tensed a little, but then her mouth relaxed under his.</p><p>\u201cIt was all right, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Jesus!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou certainly swear a lot, for a minister\u2019s son,\u201d she said, with a faint note of accusation. \u201cMaybe those old ladies in Inverness were right; you have gone to the devil.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot blasphemy,\u201d he said. He put his forehead against her shoulder, breathing in the deep, ripe scent of her, of them. \u201cPrayers of thanksgiving.\u201d</p><p>That made her laugh.</p><p>\u201cOh, it was all right, then,\u201d she said, with an unmistakable note of relief.</p><p>He lifted his head.</p><p>\u201cChrist, yes,\u201d he said, making her laugh again. \u201cHow could you possibly think otherwise?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you didn\u2019t say anything. You just lay there like somebody\u2019d hit you over the head; I thought maybe you were disappointed.\u201d</p><p>Now it was his turn to laugh, his face half buried in the smooth damps of her neck.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said finally, coming up for air. \u201cBehaving as though your spinal column\u2019s been removed is a fair indication of male satisfaction. No very gentleman-like, maybe, but honest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, okay.\u201d She seemed satisfied with that. \u201cThe book didn\u2019t say anything about that, but then it wouldn\u2019t; it didn\u2019t bother with what happens afterward.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat book is this?\u201d He moved cautiously, their skins separating with a noise like two strips of flypaper being parted. \u201cSorry about the mess.\u201d He groped for his wadded shirt and handed it to her.</p><p>\u201cThe Sensuous Man.\u201d She took the shirt and dabbed fastidiously. \u201cThere was a lot of stuff about ice cubes and whipped cream that I thought was pretty extreme, but it was good about how to do things like fellatio, and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou learned that from a book?\u201d Roger felt as scandalized as one of the ladies of his father\u2019s congregation.</p><p>\u201cWell, you don\u2019t think I go around doing that with people I go out with!\u201d She sounded truly shocked in turn.</p><p>\u201cThey write books telling young women how to\u2014that\u2019s terrible!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s terrible about it?\u201d she said, rather huffy. \u201cHow else would I know what to do?\u201d</p><p>Roger rubbed a hand over his face, at a loss for words. If asked an hour before, he would have stoutly claimed to be in favor of sexual equality. Under the veneer of modernity, though, there was apparently enough of the Presbyterian minister\u2019s son left to feel that a nice young woman really ought to be an ignoramus on her wedding night.</p><p>Manfully suppressing this Victorian notion, Roger brought a hand up over the smooth white curves of hip and flank, and cupped a soft full breast.</p><p>\u201cNot a thing,\u201d he said. \u201cOnly,\u201d he said, and dipped his head to touch his lips to hers, \u201cthere\u2019s a bit more to it,\u201d and lightly nipped her lower lip, \u201cthan ye read in books, aye?\u201d</p><p>She moved suddenly, turning to bring all that long white heat against his bare skin, and he shuddered at the shock of it.</p><p>\u201cShow me,\u201d she whispered, and bit the lobe of his ear.</p><p>A rooster crowed, somewhere nearby. Brianna woke from a light doze, berating herself for sleeping. She felt disoriented, tired enough from emotion and exertion to feel light-headed, as though she were floating a foot or two off the ground. At the same time, she didn\u2019t want to miss a moment.</p><p>Roger stirred by her side, feeling her move. He groped, put an arm around her, and rolled her over, curving himself to fit behind her, knees to knees, belly to buttocks. He brushed the tangles of her hair away from his face, making little pfft! noises that made her want to laugh.</p><p>He\u2019d made love to her three times. She was very sore, and very happy. She\u2019d imagined it a thousand times, and been wrong every time. There wasn\u2019t any way to imagine the sheer terrifying immediacy of being taken like that\u2014stretched suddenly beyond the limits of flesh, penetrated, rent, entered. Nor was there any way she could have imagined the sense of power in it.</p><p>She had expected to be helpless, the object of desire. Instead, she had held him, felt him quiver with need, all his strength leashed for fear of hurting her\u2014hers to unleash as she would. Hers, to touch and rouse, to call to her, to command.</p><p>Nor had she ever thought such tenderness existed as when he cried out and shuddered in her arms, pressing his forehead hard against her own, trusting her with that moment when his strength turned so suddenly to helplessness.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he said softly in her ear.</p><p>\u201cFor what?\u201d She reached back, stroked his thigh. She could do that, now. She could touch him anywhere, delighting in the textures and tastes of his body. She couldn\u2019t wait for the daylight, to see him nak*d.</p><p>\u201cFor this.\u201d He made a small movement with his hand, encompassing the dark around them, the hard straw under them. \u201cI should have waited. I wanted it to be...good for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was very good for me,\u201d she said softly. There was a shallow groove down the side of his thigh, where the muscle was indented.</p><p>He laughed, a little ruefully.</p><p>\u201cI wanted you to have a proper wedding night. Soft bed, clean sheets...it should have been better, for your first time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve had soft beds and clean sheets,\u201d she said. \u201cBut not this.\u201d She turned in his arms, reached down and cupped him, that fascinating mass of changeability between his legs. He stiffened for a second in surprise, then relaxed, letting her handle him as she liked. \u201cIt couldn\u2019t have been better,\u201d she said softly, and kissed him.</p><p>He kissed her back, slow and lazy, exploring all the depths and hollows of her mouth, letting her have his. He moaned a little, far back in his throat, and reached down to take her hand away.</p><p>\u201cOh, God, you\u2019re going to kill me, Bree.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she said, anxious. \u201cDid I squeeze too hard? I didn\u2019t mean to hurt you.\u201d</p><p>He laughed at that.</p><p>\u201cNot that. But give the poor thing a wee rest, hm?\u201d With a firm hand, he turned her over again, nuzzling her shoulder.</p><p>\u201cRoger?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMm?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever been so happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye? Well, that\u2019s good, then.\u201d He sounded drowsy.</p><p>\u201cEven if\u2014if we don\u2019t get back, as long as we\u2019re together, I don\u2019t mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll get back.\u201d His hand cupped her breast, gentle as seaweed coming to rest round a rock. \u201cI told you, there\u2019s another way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think so.\u201d He told her about the grimoire, the mixture of careful notes and crazed rambling\u2014and about his own passage through the stones of Craigh na Dun.</p><p>\u201cThe second time, I thought of you,\u201d he said softly, and traced her features with a finger in the dark. \u201cI lived. And I did come to the right time. But the diamond Fiona gave me was no more than a smear of lampblack in my pocket.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo it might be possible to\u2014to steer, somehow?\u201d Brianna couldn\u2019t keep a hint of hope from her voice.</p><p>\u201cThere might be.\u201d He hesitated. \u201cThere was a\u2014I suppose it must have been a poem, or maybe meant to be a spell\u2014in the book.\u201d His hand fell away as he recited it.</p><p>\u201cI raise my athame to the North</p><p>Where is the home of my power,</p><p>To the West</p><p>Where is the hearth of my soul,</p><p>To the South</p><p>Where is the seat of friendship and refuge,</p><p>To the East</p><p>From whence rises the Sun.</p><p>\u201cThen lay I my blade on the altar I have made. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I sit down amid three flames.</p><p>\u201cThree points define a plane, and I am fixed.</p><p>Four points box the earth and mine is the fullness thereof.</p><p>Five is the number of protection; let no demon hinder me.</p> <p>My left hand is wreathed in gold</p><p>And holds the power of the sun.</p><p>My right hand is sheathed in silver</p><p>And the moon reigns serene.</p><p>\u201cI begin.</p> <p>Garnets rest in love about my neck.</p><p>I will be faithful.\u201d</p><p>Brianna sat up, arms wrapped around her knees. She was silent for moment.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s nuts,\u201d she said, finally.</p><p>\u201cBeing certifiably insane is unfortunately no guarantee that someone is likewise wrong,\u201d Roger said dryly. He stretched, groaning, and sat up crosslegged on the straw.</p><p>\u201cPart of it is traditional ritual, I think\u2014given that the tradition is ancient Celt. The bits about the directions; those are the \u2018four airts,\u2019 which you\u2019ll find running through Celtic legend for some way back. As for the blade, the altar, and the flames, it\u2019s straight witchcraft.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShe stabbed her husband through the heart and set him on fire.\u201d She still remembered as well as he did the stink of petrol and burning flesh in the circle of Craigh na Dun, and shivered, though it was warm in the shed.</p><p>\u201cI hope we won\u2019t be forced to find someone for a human sacrifice,\u201d Roger said, trying and failing to make a joke of it. \u201cThe metal, though, and the gems...were you wearing any jewelry when you came through, Bree?\u201d</p><p>She nodded in reply.</p><p>\u201cYour bracelet,\u201d she said softly. \u201cAnd I had my grandmother\u2019s pearl necklace in my pocket. The pearls weren\u2019t hurt, though; they came through fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPearls aren\u2019t gemstones,\u201d he reminded her. \u201cThey\u2019re organic\u2014like people.\u201d He rubbed a hand across his face; it had been a long day, and his head was starting to throb. \u201cSilver and gold, though; you had the silver bracelet, and the necklace has gold, as well as the pearls. Ah\u2014and your mother; she wore both silver and gold, too, didn\u2019t she? Her wedding rings.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh. But \u2018three points define a plane, Four points box the earth, five is the number of protection...\u2019 \u201d Brianna murmured under her breath. \u201cCould she mean that you need gemstones to\u2014to do whatever she was trying to do? Are those the \u2018points\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCould be. She had drawings of triangles and pentagrams, and lists of different gemstones, with the supposed \u2018magickal\u2019 properties listed alongside. She wasn\u2019t laying out her theories in any great detail\u2014didn\u2019t need to, since she was talking to herself\u2014but the general notion seemed to be that there are lines of force\u2014\u2018ley lines,\u2019 she called them\u2014running through the earth. Every now and again, the lines run close to each other, and sort of curl up into knots; and wherever you get such a knot, you\u2019ve got a place where time essentially doesn\u2019t exist.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo if you step into one, you might step out again...anytime.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSame place, different time. And if you believe that gemstones have a force of their own, which might warp the lines a bit...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould any gemstone do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod knows,\u201d Roger said. \u201cBut it\u2019s the best chance we have, aye?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Brianna agreed, after a pause. \u201cBut where are we going to find any?\u201d She waved an arm toward the town and its harbor. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen anything like that anywhere\u2014in Inverness or here. I think you\u2019d need to go to a large city\u2014London, or maybe Boston or Philadelphia. And then\u2014how much money do you have, Roger? I managed to get twenty pounds, and I still have most of it, but that wouldn\u2019t be nearly enough for\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the point,\u201d he interrupted. \u201cI was thinking of that, while you were sleeping. I know\u2014I think I know\u2014where I might lay hands on one stone, at least. The thing is\u2014\u201d He hesitated. \u201cI\u2019ll have to go at once, to find it. The man who has it is in New Bern right now, but he won\u2019t be there for long. If I take a bit of your money, I can get a boat in the morning and be in New Bern by the next day. I think it\u2019s best you stay here, though. Then\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t stay here!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d He reached for her, groping in the dark. \u201cI don\u2019t want you with me. Or rather I do,\u201d he corrected himself, \u201cbut I think it\u2019s a lot safer for you here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t mean I want to come with you; I mean I can\u2019t stay here,\u201d she repeated, though she grasped his groping hand. She had nearly forgotten, but now all the excitement of discovery flooded back again. \u201cRoger, I found him\u2014I found Jamie Fraser!\u201d</p><p>\u201cFraser? Where? Here?\u201d He turned toward the door, startled.</p><p>\u201cNo, he\u2019s in Cross Creek, and I know where he\u2019ll be on Monday. I have to go, Roger. Don\u2019t you understand? He\u2019s so close\u2014and I\u2019ve come so far.\u201d She wanted suddenly and irrationally to weep, with the thought of seeing her mother again.</p><p>\u201cAye, I see.\u201d Roger sounded faintly anxious. \u201cBut could you not wait a few days? It\u2019s only a day or so by sea to New Bern, the same back\u2014and I think I can manage what I have to do within a day or two.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said. \u201cI can\u2019t. There\u2019s Lizzie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s Lizzie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy maid\u2014you saw her. She was going to hit you with a bottle.\u201d Brianna grinned at the memory. \u201cLizzie\u2019s very brave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, I daresay,\u201d Roger said dryly. \u201cBe that as it may\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut she\u2019s sick,\u201d Brianna interrupted him. \u201cDidn\u2019t you see how pale she is? I think it\u2019s malaria; she has horrible fevers and chills that last for a day or so and then stop\u2014and then a few days later, they\u2019re back again. I have to find my mother as soon as I can. I have to.\u201d</p><p>She could feel him struggling, choking back arguments. She reached out in the darkness and stroked his face.</p><p>\u201cI have to,\u201d she repeated softly, and felt him surrender.</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d he said. \u201cAll right! I\u2019ll come to join you, as soon as may be. Do me the one favor, though, aye? Wear a bloody dress!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t like my breeches?\u201d Laughter fizzed up like the bubbles in carbonated soda\u2014then stopped abruptly, as something occurred to her.</p><p>\u201cRoger,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat you\u2019re going to do\u2014are you going to steal this stone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he said simply.</p><p>She was quiet for a minute, her long thumb rubbing slowly over the palm of his hand.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d she said at last, very quietly. \u201cDon\u2019t do it; Roger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t trouble yourself over the man who\u2019s got it.\u201d Roger reached for her, trying to reassure her. \u201cIt\u2019s odds-on he stole it from someone else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not him I\u2019m worried about\u2014it\u2019s you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019ll be all right,\u201d he assured her, with casual bravado.</p><p>\u201cRoger, they hang people in this time for stealing!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t be caught.\u201d His hand sought hers in the darkness, found it, and squeezed. \u201cI\u2019ll be with you before ye know it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it isn\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt will be all right,\u201d he said firmly. \u201cI said I would take care of you, aye? I will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>He rose up on one elbow and silenced her with his mouth. Very slowly, he brought her hand toward him, pressed it between his legs.</p><p>She swallowed, the hairs on her arms rising suddenly with anticipation.</p><p>\u201cMm?\u201d he murmured, against her mouth, and without waiting for an answer, pulled her down on the straw, and rolled onto her, nudging her legs apart with his knee.</p><p>She gasped and bit his shoulder when he took her, but he made no sound.</p><p>\u201cD\u2019ye know,\u201d Roger said sleepily, some time later, \u201cI think I\u2019ve just married my great-aunt six times removed? I\u2019ve only just thought.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, it\u2019s nowhere close enough to be incest,\u201d he assured her.</p><p>\u201cOh, good,\u201d she said, with a certain amount of sarcasm. \u201cI was really worried about that. How can I be your great-aunt, for heaven\u2019s sake?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, as I said, I just thought; I hadn\u2019t realized it before. But your father\u2019s uncle was Dougal MacKenzie\u2014and it was him that caused all the trouble by getting a child on Geilie Duncan, aye?\u201d</p><p>It was the unsatisfactory method of contraception he had been forced to adopt that had caused him to think of it, in fact, but he thought it more tactful not to mention that. Neither shirt was fit to be worn by now. All things considered, he supposed it was just as well that Dougal MacKenzie hadn\u2019t had his sense of conscientiousness, since that would effectively have prevented Roger\u2019s own existence.</p><p>\u201cWell, I don\u2019t think it was all his fault.\u201d Brianna sounded pleasantly drowsy as well. It couldn\u2019t be much off dawn; birds were already making noises outside, and the air had changed, growing fresher as the wind came in off the harbor.</p><p>\u201cSo if Dougal is my great-uncle, and your six-times great-grandfather...no, you\u2019re wrong. I\u2019m about your sixth or seventh cousin, not your aunt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, that would be right if we were in the same generation of descent, but we\u2019re not; you\u2019re up about five\u2014on your father\u2019s side, at least.\u201d</p><p>Brianna was silent, trying to work this out in her head. Then giving up, she rolled over with a faint groan, nestling her bottom snugly into the hollow of his thighs.</p><p>\u201cThe hell with it,\u201d she said. \u201cAs long as you\u2019re sure it\u2019s not incest.\u201d</p><p>He clasped her to his bosom, but his sleepy brain had grasped the point and wouldn\u2019t let it go.</p><p>\u201cI really hadn\u2019t thought of it,\u201d he marveled. \u201cYou know what it means, though? I\u2019m related to your father, too\u2014in fact, I suppose he\u2019s my only living relation, besides you!\u201d Roger felt thoroughly nonplussed by this discovery, and rather moved. He had long since reconciled himself to having no close family at all\u2014not that a seven-times great-uncle was all that close, but\u2014</p><p>\u201cNo, he isn\u2019t,\u201d Brianna mumbled.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot the only one. Jenny, too. And her kids. And grandkids. My aunt Jenny\u2019s your\u2014hm, maybe you\u2019re right, after all. \u2019Cause if she\u2019s my aunt, she\u2019s your umpty-great aunt, so maybe I\u2019m your...gahh.\u201d She let her head loll back against Roger\u2019s shoulder, the spill of her hair soft against his chest. \u201cWho\u2019d you tell them you were?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJenny and Ian.\u201d She shifted, stretching. \u201cWhen you went to Lallybroch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever been there.\u201d He shifted, too, fitting his body to hers. His hand settled in the dip of her waist, and he sank back into drowsiness, giving up the abstract complexities of genealogical calculation for more immediate sensations. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo? But then...\u201d her voice died away. Fogged with sleep and the exhaustions of pleasure, Roger paid no attention, only snuggling closer with a luxurious moan. A moment later, her voice sliced through his personal fog like a knife through butter.</p><p>\u201cHow did you know where I was?\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cHm?\u201d</p><p>She twisted suddenly, leaving him with empty arms, and a pair of dark eyes a few inches from his own, slanted with suspicion.</p> <p>\u201cHow did you know where I was?\u201d she repeated slowly, each word a splinter of ice. \u201cHow did you know I\u2019d gone to the Colonies?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh...I...why...\u201d Much too late, he woke to the realization of his danger.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t have any way of knowing I\u2019d left Scotland,\u201d she said, \u201cunless you went to Lallybroch, and they told you where I was going. But you\u2019ve never been to Lallybroch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...\u201d He groped frantically for an explanation\u2014any explanation\u2014but there was none, other than the truth. And from the stiffening of her body, she had deduced that too.</p><p>\u201cYou knew,\u201d she said. Her voice wasn\u2019t much above a whisper, but the effect was as great as if she\u2019d shouted in his ear. \u201cYou knew, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p> <p>She was sitting up now, looming over him like one of the Erinyes.</p><p>\u201cYou saw that death notice! You already knew, you knew all the time, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said, trying to gather his scattered wits. \u201cI mean yes, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long have you known? Why didn\u2019t you tell me?\u201d she cried. She stood up and snatched at the pile of clothes under them.</p><p>\u201cWait,\u201d he pleaded. \u201cBree\u2014let me explain\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, explain! I want to hear you explain!\u201d Her voice was ragged with fury, but she did stop her rummaging for a moment, waiting to hear.</p> <p>\u201cLook.\u201d He was up himself by now. \u201cI did find it. Last spring. But I\u2014\u201d He took a deep breath, searching desperately for words that might make her understand.</p><p>\u201cI knew it would hurt you. I didn\u2019t want to show it to you because I knew there was nothing you could do\u2014there was no point in you breaking your heart for the sake of\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean there\u2019s nothing I could do?\u201d She jerked a shirt over her head, and glared toward him, fists clenched.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t change things, Bree! Don\u2019t you know that? Your parents tried\u2014they knew about Culloden, and they did everything they possibly could have, to stop Charles Stuart\u2014but they couldn\u2019t, could they? They failed! Geillis Duncan tried to make Stuart a king. She failed! They all failed!\u201d He risked a hand on her arm; she was stiff as a statue.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t help them, Bree,\u201d he said, more quietly. \u201cIt\u2019s part of history, it\u2019s part of the past\u2014you\u2019re not from this time; you can\u2019t change what\u2019s going to happen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know that.\u201d She was still rigid, but he thought he heard a hint of doubt in her voice.</p><p>\u201cI do!\u201d He wiped a bead of sweat from his jaw. \u201cListen\u2014if I\u2019d thought there was the slightest chance\u2014but I didn\u2019t. I\u2014God, Bree, I couldn\u2019t stand the thought of you being hurt!\u201d</p><p>She stood still, breathing heavily through her nose. If she\u2019d had the choice, he was sure it would have been fire and brimstone rather than air.</p> <p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t your business to make up my mind for me,\u201d she said, speaking through clenched teeth. \u201cNo matter what you thought. And about something so important\u2014Roger, how could you do something like that!?\u201d</p><p>The tone of betrayal in her voice was too much.</p><p>\u201cDamn it, I was afraid if I told you, ye\u2019d do just what you did!\u201d he burst out. \u201cYou\u2019d leave me! You\u2019d try to go through the stones by yourself. And now look what you\u2019ve done\u2014here\u2019s the both of us in this godforsaken\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re trying to blame me for you being here? When I did everything I possibly could to keep you from being such an idiot as to follow me?\u201d</p><p>Months of toil and terror, days of worry and fruitless searching caught up with Roger in a scorching blast.</p><p>\u201cAn idiot? That\u2019s the thanks I get for killing myself to find you? For risking my f**king life to try to protect you?\u201d He rose from the straw, meaning to get hold of her, not sure if he meant to shake her or bed her again. He had the chance to do neither; a hard shove caught him off balance, square in the chest, and he went sprawling into the hay.</p><p>She was hopping on one foot, cursing incoherently as she struggled into her breeches.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2014bloody\u2014arrogant\u2014damn you, Roger!\u2014damn you!\u201d She jerked up the breeches and, leaning down, snatched up her shoes and stockings.</p><p>\u201cGo!\u201d she said. \u201cDamn you, go! Go and get hanged if you want to! I\u2019m going to find my parents! And I\u2019m going to save them, too!\u201d</p><p>She whirled away, reached the door and jerked it open before he could reach her. She stood for a moment, silhouetted in the paler square of the doorway, dark strands of hair afloat in the wind, live as the strands of Medusa\u2019s mane.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going. Come, or don\u2019t come, I don\u2019t care. Go back to Scotland\u2014go back through the stones by yourself, for all I care! But by God, you can\u2019t stop me!\u201d</p><p>And then she was gone.</p><p>Lizzie\u2019s eyes shot wide as the door banged open against the wall. She hadn\u2019t been asleep\u2014how could she sleep?\u2014but had been lying with her eyes closed. She struggled up out of the bedclothes and fumbled for the tinderbox.</p><p>\u201cAre ye all right, Miss Bree?\u201d</p><p>It didn\u2019t sound like it; Brianna was stamping to and fro, hissing through her teeth like a snake, stopping to kick the wardrobe with a resounding thud. There were two more thuds in succession; by the wavering light of the newly lit candle, Lizzie could see that these were caused by Brianna\u2019s shoes, which had hit the wall and fallen to the floor.</p><p>\u201cAre ye all right?\u201d she repeated, uncertainly.</p><p>\u201cFine!\u201d said Brianna.</p><p>From the black air beyond the window a voice roared, \u201cBrianna! I shall come for you! Do ye hear me! I will come!\u201d</p><p>Her mistress made no answer, but strode to the window, seized the shutters and crashed them shut with a bang that made the room echo. Then she turned like a panther striking, and dashed the candlestick to the floor, plunging the room in suffocating dark.</p><p>Lizzie eased herself back into bed and lay frozen, afraid to move or speak. She could hear Brianna tearing off her clothes in silent frenzy, the hiss of indrawn breath punctuating the rustle of cloth and the stamp of bare feet on the wooden floor. Through the shutter, she heard outside the muffled sound of cursing, then nothing.</p><p>She had seen Brianna\u2019s face for a moment in the light; white as paper and hard as bone, with the eyes black holes. Her gentle, kindly mistress had vanished like smoke, taken over by a deamhan, a she-devil. Lizzie was a town lass, born long after Culloden. She had never seen the wild clansmen of the glens, or a Highlander in the grip of blood fury\u2014but she\u2019d heard the auld stories, and now she knew them true. A person who looked like that might do anything at all.</p><p>She tried to breathe as though she were sleeping, but the air came through her mouth in strangled gasps. Brianna seemed not to notice, though; she walked about the room in quick, hard steps, poured water in the bowl and splashed it on her face, then slid between the quilts and lay flat, rigid as a board.</p><p>Summoning all her courage, she turned her head toward her mistress.</p><p>\u201cAre ye...all right, a bann-sielbheadair?\u201d she asked, in a voice so low that her mistress could pretend not to have heard it if she wanted.</p><p>For a moment she thought that Brianna meant to ignore her. Then, \u201cYes\u201d came the answer, in a voice so flat and expressionless, it didn\u2019t sound like Brianna\u2019s at all. \u201cGo to sleep.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t, of course. A body didn\u2019t sleep, lying next to someone who might turn into a ursiq next thing. Her eyes had adjusted to the dark again, but she was afraid to look, in case the red hair lying on the pillow next to her should suddenly be a mane, and the delicate straight nose changed to a curved, soft muzzle, over teeth that would rend and devour.</p><p>It was a few moments before Lizzie realized that her mistress was trembling. Not weeping; there was no sound\u2014but shaking hard enough to make the bedclothes rustle.</p><p>Fool, she scolded herself. It\u2019s no but your friend and your lady, with something terrible that\u2019s happened to her\u2014and you lyin\u2019 here sniveling over fancies!</p><p>On impulse she rolled toward Brianna, reaching for the other girl\u2019s hand.</p><p>\u201cBree,\u201d she said softly. \u201cCan I be helpin\u2019 ye at all, then?\u201d</p><p>Brianna\u2019s hand curled round hers and squeezed, quick and hard, then let go.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Brianna said, very softly. \u201cGo to sleep, Lizzie; everything will be all right.\u201d</p><p>Lizzie took leave to doubt that, but said no more, lying back down and breathing quietly. It was a very long time, but at last Brianna\u2019s long body shuddered gently and relaxed into sleep. Lizzie couldn\u2019t sleep\u2014with the fever gone again, she was alert and restless. The single quilt lay heavy and damp on her, and with the shutters closed, the air in the tiny room was like breathing hot molasses.</p><p>Finally, unable to stand it any longer, Lizzie slid quietly out of bed. Keeping an ear out for any sound from the bed, she crept to the window and eased open the shutters.</p><p>The air was still hot and muggy outside, but it had begun to move a little; the dawn breeze was coming, with the turn of the air from sea to land. It was still dark, but the sky had begun to lighten as well; she could make out the line of the road below, blessedly empty.</p><p>Not knowing what else to do, she did what she always did when troubled or confused; set about to make things tidy. Moving quietly about the room, she picked up the clothes Brianna had so violently discarded, and shook them out.</p><p>They were filthy; covered with streaks of leaf stain and dirt, riddled with bits of straw; she could see it even in the dim light from the window. What had Brianna been doing, rolling about on the ground? The instant the thought came into her head, she saw it in her mind, so plain that the notion froze her with shock\u2014Brianna pinned to the ground, struggling with the black devil who had taken her away.</p><p>Her mistress was a fine big woman, but yon MacKenzie was a great tall brute of a man; he could have\u2014she stopped herself abruptly, not wanting to imagine. She couldn\u2019t help it, though; her mind had gone too far already.</p><p>With great reluctance, she brought the shirt to her nose and sniffed. Yes, there it was, the reek of a man, strong and sour as the smell of a rutting goat. The thought of the wicked creature with his body pressed to Brianna\u2019s, rubbing against her, leaving his scent on her like a dog who marks his ground\u2014she shuddered in revulsion.</p><p>Trembling, she snatched up the breeches and stockings, and bore all the clothes to the basin. She would wash them out, rinse away the reminder of MacKenzie with the dirt and the grass stains. And if the clothes were too wet for her mistress to wear in the morning...well, so much the better for that. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She still had the pot of soft yellow lye soap the landlady had given her for laundering; that would take care of it. She plunged the breeks into the water, added a finger\u2019s dollop of the soap, and began to work it into a scummy lather, pressing it through and through the fabric.</p><p>The window\u2019s square was lightening. She cast a stealthy glance over her shoulder at her mistress, but Brianna\u2019s breath came slow and steady; good, she wouldn\u2019t wake for a time yet.</p><p>She looked back to her work, and froze, feeling a chill colder than those that came with her fevers. The thin suds that covered her hands were dark, and small black eddies spread through the water like the ink stains of a cuttlefish.</p><p>She didn\u2019t want to look, but it was too late to pretend she hadn\u2019t seen. She turned back the wet fabric carefully, and there it was; a large, dark blotch, discoloring the cloth just where the seams crossed in the crotch of the breeks.</p> <p>The rising sun oozed a sullen red through the hazy sky, turning the water in the basin, the air in the room, the whole spinning world, the color of fresh blood.</p><p>41</p><p>JOURNEY\u2019S END</p><p>Brianna thought she might scream. Instead, she patted Lizzie\u2019s back and spoke softly.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, it\u2019ll be all right. Mr. Viorst says he\u2019ll wait for us. As soon as you feel better, we\u2019ll leave. But for now, don\u2019t worry about anything, just rest.\u201d</p> <p>Lizzie nodded, but couldn\u2019t answer; her teeth were chattering too hard, in spite of the three blankets over her and the hot brick at her feet.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go and get your drink, honey. Just rest,\u201d Brianna repeated, and with a final pat, rose and left the room.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t Lizzie\u2019s fault, of course, Brianna thought, but she could scarcely have picked a worse moment to have another attack of fever. Brianna had slept late and restlessly after the dreadful scene with Roger, waking to find her clothes washed and hung to dry, her shoes polished, her stockings folded, the room ruthlessly swept and tidied\u2014and Lizzie collapsed in a shivering heap on the empty hearth.</p><p>For the thousandth time, she counted the days. Eight days until Monday. If Lizzie\u2019s attack followed its usual pattern, she might be able to travel the day after tomorrow. Six days. And according to Junior Smoots and Hans Viorst, five to six days to make the trip upriver at this time of year.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t miss Jamie Fraser, she couldn\u2019t! She had to be in Cross Creek by Monday, come hell or high water. Who knew how long the trial might take, or whether he would leave as soon as it was over? She would have given anything to be able to go at once.</p><p>The burning ache to move, to go, was so intense it obliterated all the other aches and burnings of her body\u2014even the deep heart-burning of Roger\u2019s betrayal\u2014but there was nothing to be done. She could go nowhere until Lizzie was better.</p> <p>The taproom was full; two new ships had come into the harbor during the day, and now at evening the benches were full of seamen, with a game of cards loud and lively at the table in the corner. Brianna edged through the blue clouds of tobacco smoke, ignoring the whistles and ribald remarks. Roger had wanted her to wear a dress, had he? Damn him. Her breeches normally kept men at a safe distance, but Lizzie had washed them, and they were still too damp to wear.</p><p>She gave one man who reached for her buttocks a glare fit to sear his eyebrows. He stopped in mid-grab, startled, and she slid by him, through the door to the kitchen breezeway.</p><p>On the way back, with the jug of steaming catmint tea wrapped in a cloth to keep from burning her, she made a detour around the edge of the room to avoid her would-be assailant. If he touched her, she would pour boiling water in his lap. And while that would be no more than he deserved, and some palliative to her own volcanic feelings, it would waste the tea, which Lizzie badly needed.</p><p>She stepped carefully sideways, squeezing between the raucous cardplayers and the wall. The table was scattered with coins and other small valuables: silver and gilt and pewter buttons, a snuffbox, a silver penknife, and scribbled scraps of paper\u2014IOUs, she supposed, or the eighteenth-century equivalent. Then one of the men moved, and beyond his shoulder she caught the gleam of gold.</p><p>She glanced down, looked away, then looked back, startled. It was a ring, a plain gold band, but wider than most. It wasn\u2019t the gold alone that had caught her eye, though. The ring was no more than a foot away, and while the light in the taproom was more than dim, a candlestick sat on the cardplayers\u2019 table, shedding its light in the inner curve of the golden band.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t quite read the letters engraved there, but she knew the pattern so well that the legend sprang into her mind, unbidden.</p><p>She laid a hand on the shoulder of the man who had the ring, interrupting him in mid-jest. He turned, half frowning, the frown clearing as he saw who had touched him.</p><p>\u201cAye, sweetheart, and have ye come to change my luck, then?\u201d He was a big man, with a heavy-boned, handsome face, a broad mouth and a broken nose, and a pair of light green eyes that moved over her with quick appraisal.</p> <p>She forced her lips to smile at him.</p><p>\u201cI hope so,\u201d she said. \u201cShall I give your ring a rub for luck?\u201d Without waiting for permission, she snatched the ring from the table and gave it a brisk rub on her sleeve. Then holding it up to admire the shine, she could see plainly the words written inside.</p><p>From F. to C. with love. Always.</p><p>Her hand was trembling as she gave it back.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s very pretty,\u201d she said. \u201cWhere did you get it?\u201d</p><p>He looked startled, then wary, and she hastened to add, \u201cIt\u2019s too small for you\u2014won\u2019t your wife be angry if you lose her ring?\u201d How? she thought wildly. How did he get it? And what\u2019s happened to my mother?</p><p>The full lips curved in a charming smile.</p><p>\u201cAnd if I had a wife, sweetheart, sure I\u2019d leave her for you.\u201d He looked her over more closely, long lashes dropping to hide his gaze. He touched her waist in a casual gesture of invitation.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m busy just now, sweetheart, but later...eh?\u201d</p><p>The jug was burning through the cloth, but her fingers felt cold. Her heart had congealed into a small lump of terror.</p><p>\u201cTomorrow,\u201d she said. \u201cIn the daylight.\u201d</p><p>He looked at her, startled, then threw his head back and laughed.</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019ve heard men say I\u2019m not a one to be met in the dark, poppet, but the women seem to prefer it.\u201d He ran a thick finger down her forearm in play; the red-gold hairs rose at his touch.</p><p>\u201cIn the daylight, then, if ye like. Come to my ship\u2014Gloriana, near the naval yard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGracious, you vill not how long haf eaten?\u201d Miss Viorst peered at Brianna\u2019s empty bowl with good-willed incredulity. About the same age as Brianna herself, she was a broad-built, placid-tempered Dutchwoman whose motherly manner made her seem a good deal older.</p><p>\u201cDay before yesterday, I think.\u201d Brianna gratefully accepted a second helping of dumplings and broth, and yet another thick slab of salt-rising bread slathered with curls of fresh white butter. \u201cOh, thank you!\u201d The food did something to fill the hollow space that yawned inside her, a small warm comfort around which to center herself.</p><p>Lizzie\u2019s fever had come on again, two days upriver. This time the attack was longer and more severe, and Brianna had been seriously afraid that Lizzie would die, right there in the middle of the Cape Fear River.</p><p>She had sat in mid-canoe for all of a day and a night, while Viorst and his partner paddled like maniacs, she alternately pouring handfuls of water over Lizzie\u2019s head and wrapping her in all the coats and blankets available, all the time praying to see the girl\u2019s small bosom rise with the next breath.</p><p>\u201cIf I die, will ye tell my father?\u201d Lizzie had whispered to her in the rushing dark.</p><p>\u201cI will, but you won\u2019t, so dinna fash yourself,\u201d Brianna said firmly. It was successful; Lizzie\u2019s frail back quivered with laughter at Brianna\u2019s attempted Scots, and a small bony hand reached up to hers, holding on until sleep loosened its grip and the fleshless fingers slipped free.</p><p>Viorst, alarmed at Lizzie\u2019s state, had taken them to the house he shared with his sister a little way below Cross Creek, carrying Lizzie\u2019s blanket-wrapped body up the dusty trail from the river to a small framed cottage. The girl\u2019s stubborn spirit had brought her through once more, but Brianna thought that the fragile flesh might not be equal to many more such demands.</p><p>She cut a dumpling in half and ate it slowly, savoring the rich warm juices of chicken and onion. She was grubby, travel-worn, starved, and exhausted, every bone in her body aching. They had made it, though. They were in Cross Creek, and tomorrow was Monday. Somewhere nearby was Jamie Fraser\u2014and God willing, Claire as well.</p><p>She touched the leg of her breeches, and the secret pocket sewn into the seam. It was still there, the small round hardness of the talisman. Her mother was still alive. That was all that mattered.</p><p>After eating, she went once more to check on Lizzie. Hanneke Viorst was sitting by the bed darning socks. She nodded to Brianna, smiling.</p><p>\u201cShe is gut.\u201d</p><p>Looking down at the wasted, sleeping face, Brianna wouldn\u2019t have said that much. Still, the fever was gone; a hand on Lizzie\u2019s brow came away cool and damp, and a half-empty bowl on the table nearby showed that she had managed a little nourishment.</p><p>\u201cYou vill rest, too?\u201d Hanneke half rose, gesturing toward the trundle bed pulled out in readiness.</p><p>Brianna cast a glance of longing at the clean quilts and puffy bolster, but shook her head.</p><p>\u201cNot yet, thank you. What I\u2019d really like is to borrow your mule, if I might.\u201d</p><p>There was no telling where Jamie Fraser was now. Viorst had told her that River Run was a good distance from the town; he might be there, or he might be staying somewhere in Cross Creek, for convenience. She couldn\u2019t leave Lizzie long enough to ride all the way to River Run, but she did want to go into town and find the courthouse where the trial would be held tomorrow. She was taking no chance of missing him by not knowing where to go.</p><p>The mule was large and elderly, but not averse to ambling along the riverbank road. He walked somewhat slower than she could have done herself, but that didn\u2019t matter; she was in no hurry, now.</p><p>Despite her tiredness, she began to feel better as she rode, her bruised, stiff body relaxing into the easy rhythm of the mule\u2019s slow gait. It was a hot, humid day, but the sky was clear and blue, and great elms and hickory trees overhung the road, cool leaves filtering the sun.</p><p>Torn between Lizzie\u2019s illness and her own painful memories, she had noticed nothing of the second half of their voyage, taken no notice of change in the countryside they passed. Now it was like being magically transported during sleep, waking up in a different place. She put everything else aside, determined to forget the last few days and everything in them. She was going to find Jamie Fraser.</p><p>The sandy roads, scrub-pine forests, and marshy swamps of the coast were gone, replaced by thickets of cool green, by tall, thick-trunked, canopied trees, and a soft orange dirt that darkened to black mold where the dead leaves lay matted at the edge of the road. The shrieks of gulls and terns were gone, replaced by the muted chatter of a jay, and the soft liquid song of a whippoorwill, far back in the forest. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>How would it be? she wondered. She had wondered the same thing a hundred times, and a hundred times imagined different scenes: what she would say, what he would say\u2014would he be glad to see her? She hoped so; and yet he would be a stranger. Likely he would bear no resemblance at all to the man of her imagination. With some difficulty, she fought back the memory of Laoghaire\u2019s voice: A liar and a cheat...Her mother hadn\u2019t thought so.</p><p>\u201c \u2018Sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof,\u2019 \u201d she murmured to herself. She had come into the town of Cross Creek itself; the scattered houses thickened, and the dirt track widened into a cobbled street, lined with shops and larger houses. There were people about, but it was the hottest part of the afternoon, when the air lay still and heavy on the town. Those who could be, were inside in the shade.</p><p>The road curved out, following the riverbank. A small sawmill stood by itself on a point of land, and near it, a tavern. She\u2019d ask there, she decided. Hot as it was, she could use something to drink.</p><p>She patted the pocket of her coat, to be sure she had money. She felt instead the prickly outline of a horse chestnut\u2019s hull, and pulled her hand away as though she\u2019d been burned.</p> <p>She felt hollow again, in spite of the food she\u2019d eaten. Lips pressed tight together, she tethered the mule and ducked into the dark refuge of the tavern.</p><p>The room was empty save for the landlord, perched in somnolence on his stool. He roused himself at her step, and after the usual goggle of surprise at her appearance, served her beer and gave her courteous directions to the courthouse.</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d She wiped the sweat from her forehead with a coat sleeve\u2014even inside, the heat was stifling.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll have come for the trial, then?\u201d the landlord ventured, still looking at her curiously.</p><p>\u201cYes\u2014well, not really. Whose trial is it?\u201d she asked, belatedly realizing that she had no idea.</p> <p>\u201cOh, it\u2019ll be Fergus Fraser,\u201d the man said, as though assuming that naturally everyone knew who Fergus Fraser was. \u201cAssault on an officer of the Crown is the charge. He\u2019ll be acquitted, though,\u201d the landlord went on matter-of-factly. \u201cJamie Fraser\u2019s come down from the mountain for him.\u201d</p><p>Brianna choked on her beer.</p><p>\u201cYou know Jamie Fraser?\u201d she asked breathlessly, swabbing at the spilled foam on her sleeve.</p><p>The landlord\u2019s brows went up.</p><p>\u201cWait but a moment and you\u2019ll know him, too.\u201d He nodded at a pewter tankard full of beer, sitting on the nearby table. She hadn\u2019t noticed it when she came in. \u201cHe went out the back, just as you came in. He\u2014hey!\u201d He fell back with a cry of surprise as she dropped her own tankard on the floor, and shot out the back door like a bat out of hell.</p><p>The light outside was dazzling after the taproom\u2019s gloom. Brianna blinked, eyes tearing at the shafts of sun that stabbed through the shifting greens of a screen of maples. Then a movement caught her eye, below the flickering leaves.</p> <p>He stood in the shade of the maples, half turned away from her, head bent in absorption. A tall man, long-legged, lean and graceful, with his shoulders broad under a white shirt. He wore a faded kilt in pale greens and browns, casually rucked up in front as he urinated against a tree.</p><p>He finished and, letting the kilt fall, turned toward the post house. He saw her then, standing there staring at him, and tensed slightly, hands half curling. Then he saw past her men\u2019s clothes, and the look of wary suspicion changed at once to surprise as he realized that she was a woman.</p><p>There was no doubt in her mind, from the first glimpse. She was at once surprised and not surprised at all; he was not quite what she had imagined\u2014he seemed smaller, only man-sized\u2014but his face had the lines of her own; the long, straight nose and stubborn jaw, and the slanted cat-eyes, set in a frame of solid bone.</p><p>He moved toward her out of the maples\u2019 shadow, and the sun struck his hair with a spray of copper sparks. Half consciously she raised a hand and pushed a strand of hair back from her face, seeing from the corner of her eye the matching gleam of thick red-gold.</p><p>\u201cWhat d\u2019ye want here, lassie?\u201d he asked. Sharp, but not unkind. His voice was deeper than she had imagined; the Highland burr slight but distinct.</p><p>\u201cYou,\u201d she blurted. Her heart seemed to have wedged itself in her throat; she had trouble forcing any words past it.</p><p>He was close enough that she caught the faint whiff of his sweat and the fresh smell of sawn wood; there was a golden scatter of sawdust caught in the rolled sleeves of his linen shirt. His eyes narrowed with amusement as he looked her up and down, taking in her costume. One reddish eyebrow rose, and he shook his head.</p><p>\u201cSorry, lass,\u201d he said, with a half-smile. \u201cI\u2019m a marrit man.\u201d</p> <p>He made to pass by, and she made a small incoherent sound, putting out a hand to stop him, but not quite daring to touch his sleeve. He stopped and looked at her more closely.</p><p>\u201cNo, I meant it; I\u2019ve a wife at home, and home\u2019s not far,\u201d he said, evidently wishing to be courteous. \u201cBut\u2014\u201d He stopped, close enough now to take in the grubbiness of her clothes, the hole in the sleeve of her coat and the tattered ends of her stock.</p><p>\u201cOch,\u201d he said in a different tone, and reached for the small leather purse he wore tied at his waist. \u201cWill ye be starved, then, lass? I\u2019ve money, if you must eat.\u201d</p><p>She could scarcely breathe. His eyes were dark blue, soft with kindness. Her eyes fixed on the open collar of his shirt, where the curly hairs showed, bleached gold against his sunburnt skin.</p><p>\u201cAre you\u2014you\u2019re Jamie Fraser, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>He glanced sharply at her face.</p><p>\u201cI am,\u201d he said. The wariness had returned to his face; his eyes narrowed against the sun. He glanced quickly behind him, toward the tavern, but nothing stirred in the open doorway. He took a step closer to her.</p><p>\u201cWho asks?\u201d he said softly. \u201cHave you a message for me, lass?\u201d</p><p>She felt an absurd desire to laugh welling up in her throat. Did she have a message?</p><p>\u201cMy name is Brianna,\u201d she said. He frowned, uncertain, and something flickered in his eyes. He knew it! He\u2019d heard the name and it meant something to him. She swallowed hard, feeling her cheeks blaze as though they\u2019d been seared by a candle flame.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m your daughter,\u201d she said, her voice sounding choked to her own ears. \u201cBrianna.\u201d</p><p>He stood stock-still, not changing expression in the slightest. He had heard her, though; he went pale, and then a deep, painful red washed up his throat and into his face, sudden as a brushfire, matching her own vivid color.</p><p>She felt a deep flash of joy at the sight, a rush through her midsection that echoed that blaze of blood, recognition of their fair-skinned kinship. Did it trouble him to blush so strongly? she wondered suddenly. Had he schooled his face to immobility, as she had learned to do, to mask that telltale surge?</p><p>Her own face felt stiff, but she gave him a tentative smile.</p><p>He blinked, and his eyes moved at last from her face, slowly taking in her appearance, and\u2014with what seemed to her a new and horrified awareness\u2014her height.</p><p>\u201cMy God,\u201d he croaked. \u201cYou\u2019re huge.\u201d</p><p>Her own blush had subsided, but now came back with a vengeance.</p><p>\u201cAnd whose fault is that, do you think?\u201d she snapped. She drew herself up straight and squared her shoulders, glaring. So close, at her full height, she could look him right in the eye, and did.</p><p>He jerked back, and his face did change then, mask shattering in surprise. Without it, he looked younger; underneath were shock, surprise, and a dawning expression of half-painful eagerness.</p><p>\u201cOch, no, lassie!\u201d he exclaimed. \u201cI didna mean it that way, at all! It\u2019s only\u2014\u201d He broke off, staring at her in fascination. His hand lifted, as though despite himself, and traced the air, outlining her cheek, her jaw and neck and shoulder, afraid to touch her directly.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s true?\u201d he whispered. \u201cIt is you, Brianna?\u201d He spoke her name with a queer accent\u2014Breeanah\u2014and she shivered at the sound.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s me,\u201d she said, a little huskily. She made another attempt at a smile. \u201cCan\u2019t you tell?\u201d</p><p>His mouth was wide and full-lipped, but not like hers; wider, a bolder shape, that seemed to hide a smile in the corners of it, even in repose. It was twitching now, not certain what to do.</p><p>\u201cAye,\u201d he said. \u201cAye, I can.\u201d</p><p>He did touch her then, his fingers drawing lightly down her face, brushing back the waves of ruddy hair from temple and ear, tracing the delicate line of her jaw. She shivered again, though his touch was noticeably warm; she could feel the heat of his palm against her cheek.</p><p>\u201cI hadna thought of you as grown,\u201d he said, letting his hand fall reluctantly away. \u201cI saw the pictures, but still\u2014I had ye in my mind somehow as a wee bairn always\u2014as my babe. I never expected...\u201d His voice trailed off as he stared at her, the eyes like her own, deep blue and thick-lashed, wide in fascination.</p><p>\u201cPictures,\u201d she said, feeling breathless with happiness. \u201cYou\u2019ve seen pictures of me? Mama found you, didn\u2019t she? When you said you had a wife at home\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cClaire,\u201d he interrupted. The wide mouth had made its decision; it split into a smile that lit his eyes like the sun in the dancing tree leaves. He grabbed her arms, tight enough to startle her.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll not have seen her, then? Christ, she\u2019ll be mad wi\u2019 joy!\u201d</p><p>The thought of her mother was overwhelming. Her face cracked, and the tears she had been holding back for days spilled down her cheeks in a flood of relief, half choking her as she laughed and cried together.</p><p>\u201cHere, lassie, dinna weep!\u201d he exclaimed in alarm. He let go of her arm and snatched a large, crumpled handkerchief from his sleeve. He patted tentatively at her cheeks, looking worried.</p><p>\u201cDinna weep, a leannan, dinna be troubled,\u201d he murmured. \u201cIt\u2019s all right, m\u2019 annsachd; it\u2019s all right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m all right; everything\u2019s all right. I\u2019m just\u2014happy,\u201d she said. She took the handkerchief, wiped her eyes and blew her nose. \u201cWhat does that mean\u2014a leannan? And the other thing you said?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll not have the Gaelic, then?\u201d he asked, and shook his head. \u201cNo, of course she wouldna have been taught,\u201d he murmured, as though to himself.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll learn,\u201d she said firmly, giving her nose a last wipe. \u201cA leannan?\u201d</p><p>A slight smile reappeared on his face as he looked at her.</p><p>\u201cIt means \u2018darling,\u2019 \u201d he said softly. \u201cM\u2019 annsachd\u2014my blessing.\u201d</p><p>The words hung in the air between them, shimmering like the leaves. They stood still, both stricken suddenly with shyness by the endearment, unable to look away from each other, unable to find more words.</p><p>\u201cFa\u2014\u201d Brianna started to speak, then stopped, suddenly seized with doubt. What should she call him? Not Daddy. Frank Randall had been Daddy to her all her life; it would be a betrayal to use that name to another man\u2014any other man. Jamie? No, she couldn\u2019t possibly; rattled as he was by her appearance, he had still a formidable dignity that forbade such casual use. \u201cFather\u201d seemed remote and stern\u2014and whatever Jamie Fraser might be, he wasn\u2019t that; not to her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He saw her hesitate and flush, and recognized her trouble.</p><p>\u201cYou can...call me Da,\u201d he said. His voice was husky; he stopped and cleared his throat. \u201cIf\u2014if ye want to, I mean,\u201d he added diffidently.</p><p>\u201cDa,\u201d she said, and felt the smile bloom easily this time, unmarred by tears. \u201cDa. Is that Gaelic?\u201d</p><p>He smiled back, the corners of his mouth trembling slightly.</p> <p>\u201cNo. It\u2019s only...simple.\u201d</p><p>And suddenly it was all simple. He held out his arms to her. She stepped into them and found that she had been wrong; he was as big as she\u2019d imagined\u2014and his arms were as strong about her as she had ever dared to hope.</p><p>Everything after that seemed to happen in a daze. Overcome by emotion and fatigue, Brianna was conscious of events more as a series of images, sharp as stop-frame photos, than as a moving flow of life.</p><p>Lizzie, gray eyes blinking in the sudden light, tiny and pale in the arms of a sturdy black groom with an improbable Scottish accent. A wagon piled with glass and fragrant wood. The polished rumps of horses, and the jolt and creak of wooden wheels. Her father\u2019s voice, deep and warm in her ear, describing a house to be built, high on a mountain ridge, explaining that the windows were a surprise for her mother.</p><p>\u201cBut no such a surprise as you, lassie!\u201d And a laugh of deep joy that seemed to echo in her bones.</p> <p>A long ride down dusty roads, and sleeping with her head on her father\u2019s shoulder, his free arm around her as he drove, breathing the unfamiliar scent of his skin, his strange long hair brushing her face when he turned his head.</p><p>Then the cool luxury of the big, breezy house, filled with the scent of beeswax and flowers. A tall woman with white hair and Brianna\u2019s face, and a blue-eyed gaze that looked disconcertingly beyond her. Long cool hands that touched her face and stroked her hair with abstract curiosity.</p><p>\u201cLizzie,\u201d she said, and a pretty woman bent over Lizzie, murmuring, \u201cJesuit bark,\u201d her black hands beautiful against the yellow porcelain of Lizzie\u2019s face.</p><p>Hands\u2014so many hands. Everything was done as if by magic, with soft murmurs as they passed her from hand to hand. She was stripped and bathed before she could protest, scented water poured over her, firm, gentle fingers that massaged her scalp as lavender soap was sluiced from her hair. Linen towels and a small black girl who dried her feet and sprinkled them with rice powder.</p><p>A fresh cotton gown and floating barefoot over polished floors, to see her father\u2019s eyes light at sight of her. Food\u2014cakes and trifles and jellies and scones\u2014and hot, sweet tea that seemed to replace the blood in her veins.</p><p>A pretty blond girl with a frown on her face, who seemed peculiarly familiar; her father called her Marsali. Lizzie, washed and wrapped in a blanket, both frail hands round a mug of pungent liquid, looking like a steppedon flower newly watered.</p> <p>Talk, and people coming, and more talk, with only the occasional phrase penetrating through her growing fog.</p><p>\u201c...Farquard Campbell has more sense...\u201d</p><p>\u201cFergus, Da, did ye see him? Is he all right?\u201d</p><p>Da? she thought, half puzzled, faintly indignant that someone else should call him that, because...because...</p><p>Her aunt\u2019s voice, coming from a great distance, saying, \u201cThe poor child is asleep where she sits; I can hear her snoring. Ulysses, take her up to bed.\u201d</p><p>And then strong arms that lifted her with no sense of strain, but not the candlewax smell of the black butler; the sawdust and linen scent of her father. She gave up the struggle and fell asleep, her head on his chest.</p><p>Fergus Fraser might sound like a Scottish clansman; he looked like a French noble. A French noble on his way to the guillotine, Brianna silently amended her first impression.</p><p>Handsomely dark, slightly built, and not very tall, he sauntered into the dock, and turned to face the room, long nose lifted an inch above the usual. The shabby clothes, the unshaven jaw, and the large purple bruise over one eye subtracted nothing from his air of aristocratic disdain. Even the curved metal hook that he wore in replacement of a missing hand only added to his impression of disreputable glamour.</p> <p>Marsali gave a small sigh at sight of him, and her lips grew tight. She leaned across to Brianna to whisper to Jamie.</p><p>\u201cWhat have they done to him, the bastards?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing that matters.\u201d He made a small motion, gesturing her back, and she subsided into her seat, glowering at bailiff and sheriff in turn.</p><p>They had been lucky to procure seats; every space in the small building was filled, and people were jostling and muttering at the back of the room, kept in order only by the presence of the red-coated soldiers who guarded the doors. Two more soldiers stood to attention at the front of the room, beside the Justice\u2019s bench, an officer of some sort lurking in the corner behind them.</p><p>Brianna saw the officer catch Jamie Fraser\u2019s eye, and a look of malign satisfaction crept over the man\u2019s broad features, a look almost of gloating. It made the small hairs rise on the back of her neck, but her father met the man\u2019s gaze squarely, then turned away, indifferent.</p><p>The Justice arrived and took his place, and the ceremonies of justice being duly performed, the trial began. Evidently, it was not intended to be a trial by jury, since no such body was present; only the Justice and his minions.</p><p>Brianna had made out little from the conversation the evening before, though over breakfast she had managed to disentangle the confusion of persons. The young black woman\u2019s name was Phaedre, one of Jocasta\u2019s slaves, and the tall homely boy with the charming smile was Jamie\u2019s nephew, Ian\u2014her cousin, she thought, with the same small thrill of discovered kinship she had felt at Lallybroch. The lovely blond Marsali was Fergus\u2019s wife, and Fergus, of course, was the French orphan whom Jamie had informally adopted in Paris, before the Stuart Rising.</p><p>Mr. Justice Conant, a tidy gentleman of middle age, settled his wig, arranged his coat, and called for the charges to be read. These were, to wit, that one Fergus Claudel Fraser, resident of Rowan County, had on August 4 of this year of our Lord 1769, feloniously assaulted the person of one Hugh Berowne, a deputy sheriff of said county, and stolen from him Crown property, then lawfully in the deputy\u2019s custody.</p><p>The said Hugh, being called to the stand, proved to be a gangling fellow of some thirty years and a nervous disposition. He twitched and stammered through his testimony, averring that he had encountered the defendant on the Buffalo Trail Road, while he, Berowne, was in pursuit of his lawful duties. He had been roughly abused by the defendant in the French tongue, and upon his endeavoring to leave, had been pursued by the defendant, who had apprehended him, struck him in the face, and taken away the property of the Crown in Berowne\u2019s custody, to wit, one horse, with bridle and saddle.</p><p>Upon the invitation of the court, the witness here pulled back the right side of his mouth in a grimace, disclosing a broken tooth, suffered in the assault.</p><p>Mr. Justice Conant peered interestedly at the shattered remains of the tooth, and turned to the prisoner.</p><p>\u201cIndeed. And now, Mr. Fraser, might we hear your account of this unfortunate event?\u201d</p><p>Fergus lowered his nose half an inch, awarding the justice the same regard he might have bestowed on a cockroach.</p><p>\u201cThis loathsome wad of dung,\u201d he began in measured tones, \u201chad\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe prisoner will refrain from insult,\u201d Justice Conant said coldly.</p><p>\u201cThe deputy,\u201d Fergus resumed, without turning a hair, \u201chad come upon my wife as she returned from the flour mill, with my infant son upon her saddle. This\u2014the deputy\u2014hailed her, and without ceremony dragged her from the saddle, informed her that he was taking the horse and its equipment in payment of tax, and left her and the child on foot, five miles from my home, in the blazing sun!\u201d He glared ferociously at Berowne, who narrowed his own gaze in reply. Next to Brianna, Marsali exhaled strongly through her nose.</p><p>\u201cWhat tax did the deputy claim was owed?\u201d</p><p>A dark flush had mantled Fergus\u2019s cheeks.</p><p>\u201cI owe nothing! It was his claim that my land is subject to an annual rent of three shillings, but it is not! My land is exempt from this tax, by virtue of the terms of a land grant made to James Fraser by Governor Tryon. I told the stinking salaud as much, when he visited my home to try to collect the money.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI heard nothing of such a grant,\u201d Berowne said sulkily. \u201cThese folks will tell you any tale at all, to put off paying. Lallygags and cheats, the lot of them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOreilles en feuille de chou!\u201d</p><p>A small ripple of laughter ran through the room, nearly drowning out the Justice\u2019s rebuke. Brianna\u2019s high-school French was just about adequate to translate this as \u201cCauliflower ears!\u201d and she joined in the general smile.</p><p>The Justice lifted his head and peered into the courtroom.</p><p>\u201cIs James Fraser present?\u201d</p><p>Jamie rose and bowed respectfully.</p><p>\u201cHere, milord.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSwear the witness, Bailiff.\u201d</p><p>Jamie, having been duly sworn, attested to the facts that he was in fact the proprietor of a grant of land, that said grant had been made and its terms agreed to by Governor Tryon, that said terms did include a quitment of land rent to the Crown for a period of ten years, such period to expire some nine years hence, and finally, that Fergus Fraser did maintain a house upon and farm crops within the boundaries of the granted territory, under license from himself, James Alexander Malcolm MacKenzie Fraser.</p><p>Brianna\u2019s attention had at first been fixed upon her father; she could scarcely get enough of looking at him. He was the tallest man in the courtroom, and by far the most striking, attired in snowy linen and a coat of deep blue that set off his slanted eyes and fiery hair.</p><p>A movement in the corner attracted her eye, though, and she looked to see the officer she had noticed before. He was no longer looking at her father, but had fixed Hugh Berowne with a penetrating stare. Berowne gave the shadow of a nod, and sat back to await the end of Fraser\u2019s testimony.</p><p>\u201cIt would appear that Mr. Fraser\u2019s claim of exemption holds true, Mr. Berowne,\u201d the Justice said mildly. \u201cI must therefore hold him acquitted of the charge of\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe cannot prove it!\u201d Berowne blurted out. He glanced at the officer, as though for moral support, and stiffened his long chin. \u201cThere is no documentary proof; only James Fraser\u2019s word.\u201d</p><p>Another stir went through the courtroom; this one uglier in tone. Brianna had no trouble hearing the shock and outrage that her father\u2019s word had been called in question, and felt an unexpected pride.</p><p>Her father showed no anger, though; he rose again, and bowed to the Justice.</p><p>\u201cAnd your Lordship will permit me.\u201d He reached into his coat and removed a folded sheet of parchment, with a blob of red sealing wax affixed.</p><p>\u201cYour Lordship will be familiar with the Governor\u2019s seal, I am sure,\u201d he said, laying it on the table before Mr. Conant. The Justice raised one eyebrow, but looked carefully at the seal, then broke it open, examined the document within, and laid it down.</p><p>\u201cThis is a duly witnessed copy of the original grant of land,\u201d he announced, \u201csigned by His Excellency, William Tryon.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHow did you get that?\u201d Berowne blurted. \u201cThere wasn\u2019t time to get to New Bern and back!\u201d Then all the blood drained from his face. Brianna looked at the officer; his pudgy face seemed to have acquired all the blood Berowne had lost.</p><p>The Justice cast him a sharp glance, but merely said, \u201cGiven that documentary proof is now entered in evidence, we find that the defendant is plainly not guilty of the charge of theft, since the property in question was his own. On the matter of assault, however\u2014\u201d At this point he noticed that Jamie had not sat down, but was still standing in front of the bench.</p><p>\u201cYes, Mr. Fraser? Had you something else to tell the court?\u201d Justice Conant dabbed at a trickle of sweat that ran down from under his wig; with so many bodies packed into the small room, it was like a sweatbath.</p><p>\u201cI beg the court might gratify my curiosity, your Lordship. Does Mr. Berowne\u2019s original charge describe more fully the attack upon him?\u201d</p> <p>The Justice raised both eyebrows, but shuffled quickly through the papers on the table before him, then handed one to the bailiff, pointing to a spot on the page.</p><p>\u201cComplainant stated that one Fergus Fraser struck him in the face with his fist, causing complainant to fall stunned upon the ground, whereat the defendant seized the bridle of the horse, leapt upon it, and rode away, calling out remarks of an abusive nature in the French tongue. Complainant\u2014\u201d</p><p>A loud cough from the dock pulled all eyes to the defendant, who smiled charmingly at Mr. Justice Conant, plucked a handkerchief from his pocket and elaborately wiped his face\u2014using the hook at the end of his left arm.</p><p>\u201cOh!\u201d said the Justice, and swiveled cold eyes toward the witness chair, where Berowne squirmed in hot-faced agony.</p><p>\u201cAnd would you care to explain, sir, how you have sustained injury upon the right side of your face, when struck by the left fist of a man who does not have one?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, crottin,\u201d Fergus said cheerfully. \u201cExplain that one.\u201d</p><p>Perhaps feeling that Berowne\u2019s attempts at explanation were best conducted in privacy, Justice Conant mopped his neck and put a summary end to the trial, dismissing Fergus Fraser with no stain upon his character.</p><p>\u201cIt was me,\u201d Marsali said proudly, clinging to the arm of her husband at the celebratory feast that followed the trial.</p><p>\u201cYou?\u201d Jamie gave her an amused glance. \u201cThat fisted yon deputy in the face, ye mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot my fist, my foot,\u201d she corrected. \u201cWhen the wicked salaud tried to drag me off the horse, I kicked him in the jaw. He\u2019d never ha\u2019 got me down,\u201d she added, glowering at the memory, \u201csave he snatched Germaine from me, so of course I had to go and get him.\u201d</p><p>She petted the sleek blond head of the toddler who clung to her skirts, a piece of biscuit clutched in one grubby fist.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t quite understand,\u201d Brianna said. \u201cDid Mr. Berowne not want to admit that a woman hit him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, no,\u201d Jamie said, pouring another cup of ale and handing it to her. \u201cIt was only Sergeant Murchison making a nuisance of himself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSergeant Murchison? That would be the army officer who was at the trial?\u201d she asked. She took a small sip of the ale, for politeness\u2019 sake. \u201cThe one who looks like a half-roasted pig?\u201d</p><p>Her father grinned at this characterization.</p><p>\u201cAye, that\u2019ll be the man. He\u2019s a mislike of me,\u201d he explained. \u201cThis wilna be the first time\u2014or the last\u2014that he\u2019s tried such a trick to cripple me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe could not hope to succeed with such a ridiculous charge,\u201d Jocasta chimed in, leaning forward and reaching out a hand. Ulysses, standing by, moved the plate of bannocks the necessary inch. She took one, unerringly, and turned her disconcerting blind eyes toward Jamie.</p><p>\u201cWas it really necessary for you to subvert Farquard Campbell?\u201d she asked, disapproving.</p><p>\u201cAye, it was,\u201d Jamie answered. Seeing Brianna\u2019s confusion, he explained.</p> <p>\u201cFarquard Campbell is the usual justice of this district. If he hadna fallen ill so conveniently\u201d\u2014and here he grinned again, mischief dancing in his eyes\u2014\u201cthe trial would have been held last week. That was their plan, aye? Murchison and Berowne. They meant to bring the charge, arrest Fergus, and force me down from the mountain in the midst of the harvest\u2014and they succeeded in that much, damn them,\u201d he added ruefully.</p><p>\u201cBut they counted on my not being able to obtain a copy of the grant from New Bern before the trial\u2014as indeed I could not, had it been last week.\u201d He gave Ian a smile, and the boy, who had ridden hellbent to New Bern to procure the document, blushed pink and buried his face in a bowl of punch.</p><p>\u201cFarquard Campbell is a friend, Auntie,\u201d Jamie said to Jocasta, \u201cbut ye ken as well as I that he\u2019s a man of the law; it wouldna make a bit of difference that he knows the terms of my grant as well as I do; if I couldna produce the proof in court, he would feel himself forced to rule against me.</p><p>\u201cAnd if he had,\u201d he went on, returning to Brianna, \u201cI should have been forced to appeal the verdict, which would mean Fergus being taken to prison in New Bern, and a new trial scheduled there. The end of it would have been the same\u2014but it would have taken both Fergus and myself off the land for most of the harvest season, and cost me more in fees than the harvest will bring.\u201d</p><p>He looked at Brianna over the rim of his cup, blue eyes suddenly serious.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll no be thinking me rich, I hope?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI hadn\u2019t thought of it at all,\u201d she replied, startled, and he smiled.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s as well,\u201d he said, \u201cfor while I\u2019ve a good bit of land, there\u2019s little of it under cultivation as yet; we\u2019ve enough\u2014barely\u2014to seed the fields and feed ourselves, wi\u2019 a bit left over for the cattle. And capable as your mother is\u201d\u2014the smile widened\u2014\u201cshe canna bring in thirty acres of corn and barley by herself.\u201d He set down his empty cup and stood up.</p><p>\u201cIan, will ye see to the supplies and drive up the wagon with Fergus and Marsali? The lass and I will go ahead, I think.\u201d He glanced down at Brianna questioningly.</p><p>\u201cJocasta will care for your wee maid here. Ye dinna mind going so soon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said, putting down her cup and standing up too. \u201cCan we go today?\u201d</p><p>I took down the bottles from the cupboard, one by one, uncorking one now and then to sniff at the contents. If not thoroughly dry before storage, fleshy-leaved herbs would rot in the bottle; seeds would grow exotic molds.</p><p>The thought of molds made me think once more of my penicillin plantation. Or what I hoped might one day be one, were I lucky enough, and observant enough to know my luck. Of the hundreds of molds that grew easily on stale, damp bread, Penicillium was only one. What were the odds of a stray spore of that one precious mold taking root on the slices of bread I laid out weekly? What were the odds of an exposed slice of bread surviving long enough for any spores to find it? And lastly, what were the odds that I would recognize it if I saw it?</p><p>I had been trying for more than a year, with no success so far.</p><p>Even with the marigolds and yarrow I scattered for repellency, it was impossible to keep the vermin away. Mice and rats, ants and cockroaches; one day I had even found a party of burglarious squirrels in the pantry, holding riot over scattered corn and the gnawed ruins of half my seed potatoes.</p><p>The only recourse was to lock all edibles in the big hutch Jamie had built\u2014that, or keep them in thick wooden casks or lidded jars, resistent to the efforts of tooth and claw. But to seal food away from four-footed thieves was also to seal it away from the air\u2014and the air was the only messenger that might one day bring me a real weapon against disease.</p><p>Each of the plants carries an antidote to some illness\u2014if we only knew what it was. I felt a renewed pang of loss when I thought of Nayawenne; not only for herself but for her knowledge. She had taught me only a fraction of the things she knew, and I regretted that most bitterly\u2014though not as bitterly as the loss of my friend.</p><p>Still, I knew one thing she had not\u2014the manifold virtues of that smallest of plants, the lowly bread mold. To find it would be difficult, to recognize it, and to use it, even more so. But I never doubted it was worth the search.</p><p>To leave bread exposed in the house was to draw the mice and rats inside. I had tried setting it on the sideboard\u2014Ian had absentmindedly consumed half of my budding antibiotic incubator, and mice and ants made short work of the rest while I was away from the house.</p><p>It was simply impossible, in summer, spring, or autumn, either to leave bread exposed and unguarded or to stay inside to look after it. There were too many urgent chores to be done outside, too many calls to attend births or illness, too much opportunity for foraging.</p><p>In the winter, of course, the vermin went away, to lay their eggs against the spring, and hibernate under a blanket of dead leaves, secure from the cold. But the air was cold, too; too cold to bring me living spores. The bread I laid out either curled and dried, or went soggy, depending on its distance from the fire; in either case, sporting nothing but the occasional orange or pink crust: the molds that lived in the crevices of the human body.</p><p>I would try again in the spring, I thought, sniffing at a bottle of dried marjoram. It was good; musky as incense, smelling of dreams. The new house on the ridge was already rising, foundation laid and rooms marked out. I could see the skeletal framework from the cabin door, black against the clear September sky on the ridge.</p><p>By the spring, it would be finished. I would have plastered walls and laid oak floors, glass windows with stout frames that kept out mice and ants\u2014and a nice snug, sunny surgery in which to conduct my medical practice.</p><p>My glowing visions were interrupted by a raucous bellow from the penfold; Clarence announcing an arrival. I could hear voices in the distance, in between Clarence\u2019s shrieks of ecstasy, and I hastily began to tidy away the scatter of corks and bottles. It must be Jamie returning with Fergus and Marsali\u2014or at least I hoped so.</p><p>Jamie had been confident of the trial\u2019s outcome, but I worried nonetheless. Raised to believe that British law in the abstract was one of the great achievements of civilization, I had seen a good deal too many of its concrete applications to have much faith in its avatars. On the other hand, I had quite a bit of faith in Jamie.</p><p>Clarence\u2019s vocalizations had dropped to the wheezing gargle he used for intimate converse, but the voices had stopped. That was odd. Perhaps things had gone wrong after all?</p><p>I thrust the last of the bottles back into the cupboard and went to the door. The dooryard was empty. Clarence hee-hawed enthusiastically at my appearance, but nothing else moved. Someone had come, though\u2014the chickens had scattered, fleeing into the bushes.</p><p>A brisk chill ran up my spine and I whirled, trying to look in front of me and over my shoulder at the same time. Nothing. The chestnut trees behind the house sighed in the breeze, a shimmer of sun filtered through their yellowing leaves.</p><p>I knew beyond the shadow of a doubt that I wasn\u2019t alone. Damn, and I\u2019d left my knife on the table inside! </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSassenach.\u201d My heart nearly stopped at the sound of Jamie\u2019s voice. I spun toward it, relief being rapidly overcome by annoyance. What did he think he\u2014</p><p>For a split second, I thought I was seeing double. They were sitting on the bench outside the door, side by side, the afternoon sun igniting their hair like matchheads.</p><p>My eyes focused on Jamie\u2019s face, alight with joy\u2014then shifted right.</p><p>\u201cMama.\u201d It was the same expression; eagerness and joy and longing all together. I had no time even to think before she was in my arms, and I was in the air, knocked off my feet both literally and figuratively.</p> <p>\u201cMama!\u201d</p><p>I hadn\u2019t any breath; what hadn\u2019t been taken away by shock was being squeezed out by a rib-crushing hug.</p><p>\u201cBree!\u201d I managed to gasp, and she put me down, though she didn\u2019t let go. I looked disbelievingly up, but she was real. I looked for Jamie, and found him standing beside her. He said nothing, but gave me an face-splitting grin, his ears bright pink with delight.</p><p>\u201cI, ah, I wasn\u2019t expecting\u2014\u201d I said idiotically.</p><p>Brianna gave me a grin to match her father\u2019s, eyes bright as stars and damp with happiness.</p> <p>\u201cNobody expects the Spanish Inquisition!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d said Jamie blankly.</p><p>PART TEN</p><p>Impaired Relations</p><p>42</p><p>MOONLIGHT</p> <p>September 1769</p><p>She woke from a dreamless sleep, a hand on her shoulder. She jerked and started up on one elbow, blinking. Jamie\u2019s face was barely distinguishable above her in the gloom; the fire had burned down to nothing more than a glow, and it was nearly pitch-black in the cabin.</p><p>\u201cI shall be hunting up the mountain, lass; will ye come wi\u2019 me?\u201d he whispered.</p><p>She rubbed her eyes, trying to reassemble her sleep-scattered thoughts, and nodded.</p><p>\u201cGood. Wear your breeks.\u201d He rose silently and went out, letting in a breath of piercing-sweet cold air as the door opened.</p><p>By the time she had pulled on breeks and stockings, he was back, moving just as silently, despite the armload of firewood he carried. He nodded to her and knelt to rekindle the fire; she thrust her arms into her coat and went out herself, in search of the privy.</p><p>The world outside was black and dreamlike; if not for the chill, she might have thought herself still asleep. Stars burned coldly bright, but seemed to hang low, as though they might fall from the sky any minute and be extinguished, sizzling, in the mist-damp trees on the ridges beyond.</p><p>What time was it? she wondered, shivering at the touch of damp wood on her sleep-warmed thighs. Somewhere in the small hours; surely it was a long time until dawn. Everything was hushed; no insects hummed yet in her mother\u2019s garden, and there were no rustlings, even from the dry corn-stooks propped in the field.</p> <p>When she pushed open the door of the cabin, the air inside seemed almost solid; a block of stale smoke, fried food, and the smell of sleeping bodies. By contrast, the air outside was sweet but thin\u2014she kept taking large gulps, to get enough.</p><p>He was ready; a leather bag was tied at his belt with ax and powder horn, a bigger canvas sack slung over his shoulder. She didn\u2019t come in, but stood in the doorway watching as he bent quickly and kissed her mother in the bed.</p><p>He knew she was there, of course\u2014and it was no more than a light kiss on the forehead\u2014but she felt like an intruder, a voyeur. The more so when Claire\u2019s long, pale hand floated up from the quilts and touched his face with a tenderness that squeezed her heart. Claire murmured something, but Brianna didn\u2019t hear it.</p><p>She turned away quickly, face hot in spite of the chilly air, and was standing by the edge of the clearing when he came out. He shut the door behind him, waiting for the clunk within as it was barred. He had a gun, a long-barreled thing that seemed nearly as tall as she was.</p><p>He didn\u2019t speak, but smiled at her and cocked his head toward the wood. She followed, keeping up easily as he took a faint trail that led through groves of spruce and chestnut. His feet knocked the dew from clumps of grass, and left a dark trail through tussocks of shimmering silver.</p><p>The trail wound to and fro, nearly level for a long time, but then began to head uphill. She felt the shift, rather than saw it. It was still very dark, but suddenly the silence was gone. In the next breath, a bird began to call from the wood nearby.</p><p>Then the whole mountainside was alive with birdsong, screeches and trills and whirrs. Under the calling was a sense of movement, of fluttering and scratching just below the threshold of hearing. He stopped, listening.</p><p>She stopped, too, looking at him. The light had changed so slowly that she was scarcely aware of it; her eyes adapted to the dark, she could see easily by the starlight, and knew the change to daylight only when she glanced from the ground and saw the vivid color of her father\u2019s hair.</p><p>He had food in his bag; they sat on a log and shared apples and bread. Then she drank from a trickle that dropped from a ledge, filling her hands with cold crystal. Looking back, she could no longer see any trace of the small settlement; houses and fields were gone, as though the mountain had silently drawn her forests together, swallowing them up.</p><p>She wiped her hands on the skirts of her coat, feeling the prickly shape of the conker in her pocket. No horse chestnuts on these wooded slopes; that was an English tree, planted by some expatriate in the hope of creating a memory of home; a living link to another life. She curled her hand around it briefly, wondering whether her own links had been severed for good, then let it go, and turned to follow her father uphill.</p><p>At first her heart had pounded and her thigh muscles strained at the unaccustomed labor of climbing, but then her body had found the rhythm of the ground. With the coming of light, she no long stumbled. By the time they emerged at the top of a steep slope, her feet trod so lightly on the spongy leaves that she felt she might float off into the sky that seemed so near, cut free of the earth.</p><p>For a single moment, she wished that she could. But the links still held in the chain that bound her to the earth\u2014her mother, her father, Lizzie...and Roger. The morning sun was rising, a great ball of flame above the mountains. She had to shut her eyes for a moment, not to be blinded.</p><p>Here it was; the place he had meant to bring her. At the foot of a towering escarpment, part of the rock had fallen into a loose tumble, overgrown by moss and lichen, small saplings jutting drunkenly from cracks in the rock. He tilted his head, gesturing her to follow him. There was a way through the huge boulders, hard to see, but there. He felt her hesitate behind him, and looked back.</p><p>She smiled and waved a hand at the rock. A huge piece of limestone had fallen and split in two; he stood between the pieces.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right,\u201d she said softly. \u201cIt just reminded me.\u201d</p><p>That reminded him, and raised the hairs on his forearms. He had to stop and watch as she stepped through, only to be sure. But it was fine; she stepped through carefully, and joined him. He felt the need to touch her, though, only to be sure; he held out a hand, and felt reassured by the solid clasp of his fingers around hers.</p><p>He had judged it right; the sun was just coming over the farthest ridge as they came out into the open space at the top of the slope. Below them spread ridges and valleys, so full of mist that it looked like smoke boiling through the hollows. From the mountain opposite, the waterfall arched out and down in a thin white plume, falling into the mist.</p><p>\u201cHere,\u201d he said, stopping at a place where the rocks lay scattered, surrounded by thick grass. \u201cLet\u2019s rest for a bit.\u201d Chilly as the early mornings were, the climb had heated him; he sat on a flat rock, legs stretched out to let the air come under his kilt, and pushed the plaid off his shoulders.</p><p>\u201cIt feels so different here,\u201d she said, brushing back a lock of the soft red hair whose flames warmed him more than the sun. She glanced back at him, smiling. \u201cDo you know what I mean? I rode from Inverness to Lallybroch, through the Great Glen, and that was wild enough\u201d\u2014she shivered slightly at the recollection\u2014\u201cbut it wasn\u2019t like this at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said. He knew exactly what she meant; the wildness of the glens and the moors was inhabited, in a way that this place of forests and rushing waters was not.</p><p>\u201cI think\u2014\u201d he began, then stopped. Would she think him daft? But she was looking up at him, wanting him to say. \u201cThe spirits that live there,\u201d he said, a little awkwardly. \u201cThey are auld, and they\u2019ve seen men for thousands on thousands of years; they ken us weel, and they\u2019re none so wary of showing themselves. What lives here\u201d\u2014he laid a hand on the trunk of a chestnut tree that rose a hundred feet above them, whose girth measured more than thirty feet around\u2014\u201cthey havena seen our like before.\u201d</p><p>She nodded, seeming not at all taken back.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re curious, though, aren\u2019t they,\u201d she said, \u201csome of them?\u201d and tipped back her head to look up into the dizzy spiral of the branches overhead. \u201cDon\u2019t you feel them watching, now and then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow and then.\u201d</p><p>He sat on the rock beside her and watched the light spread, spilling over the edge of the mountain, lighting the distant falls the way kindling catches from a spark, filling the mist with a glow like pearls, then burning it away altogether. Together they saw the slope of the mountain come to the light of day, and he said a quiet word to the spirit of this place, in thanks. If it had no Gaelic, still it might catch his meaning.</p><p>She stretched her long legs, breathing in the scent of the morning.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t really mind, did you?\u201d Her voice was soft, and she kept her eyes on the valley below, careful not to look at him. \u201cLiving in the cave near Broch Mhorda.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said. The sun was warm on his breast and face, and filled him with a sense of peace. \u201cNo, I didna mind it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly hearing about it\u2014I thought it must have been terrible. Cold and dirty and lonely, I mean.\u201d She did look at him then, and the morning sky lived in her eyes.</p><p>\u201cIt was,\u201d he said, and smiled a little.</p><p>\u201cIan\u2014Uncle Ian\u2014took me there to show me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid he, then? It\u2019s none so bleak, in the summertime, when the yellow\u2019s on the broom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. But even when it was\u2014\u201d She hesitated.</p><p>\u201cNo, I didna mind it.\u201d He closed his eyes and let the sun heat his eyelids.</p><p>At first he had thought the loneliness would kill him, but once he had learned it would not, he came to value the solitude of the mountainside. He could see the sun clear, though his eyes were closed; a great red ball, flaming round the edges. Was that how Jocasta saw it behind her blind eyes?</p><p>She was silent for a long time, and so was he, content to listen. There were wee birds working in the spruce nearby, hanging upside down from the branches, hunting the bugs that they ate and talking to themselves about what they found.</p><p>\u201cRoger\u2014\u201d she said suddenly, and his heart was struck by a dart of jealousy, the more painful for being unexpected. Was he not to have her to himself, even for so short a time? He opened his eyes and did his best to look interested.</p><p>\u201cI tried to tell him, once, about being alone. That I thought it maybe wasn\u2019t a bad thing.\u201d She sighed, the heavy brows drawn down. \u201cI don\u2019t think he understood.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He made a noncommittal sound in his throat.</p><p>\u201cI thought\u2014\u201d She hesitated, glanced at him, then away. \u201cI thought maybe that was why it\u2019s\u2014why you and Mama...\u201d Her skin was so clear, he could see the blood bloom under it. She took a deep breath, hands braced on the rock.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s like that too. She doesn\u2019t mind being alone.\u201d</p><p>He glanced at her, wanting badly to know what made her say so. What had Claire\u2019s life been in their years apart to give her that knowledge? It was so; Claire knew the flavor of solitude. It was cold as spring water, and not all could drink it; for some it was not refreshment, but mortal chill. But she had lived daily with a husband; how had she drunk deep enough of loneliness to know?</p> <p>Brianna could maybe tell him, but he wouldn\u2019t ask; the last name he wished to hear spoken in this place was Frank Randall\u2019s.</p><p>He coughed instead.</p><p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s maybe true,\u201d he agreed cautiously. \u201cI\u2019ve seen women\u2014and men too, sometimes\u2014as canna bear the sound of their own thoughts, and they maybe dinna make such good matches with those who can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said, brooding. \u201cMaybe they don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>The small pang of jealousy eased. So she had doubts about this Wakefield, did she? She\u2019d told him and Claire everything, about her search, the death notice, the journey from Scotland, the visit to Lallybroch\u2014damn Laoghaire!\u2014and about the man Wakefield, who\u2019d come after her. She wasn\u2019t telling everything there, he thought, but that was as well; he didn\u2019t want to hear it. He was less bothered at the prospect of a distant death by fire than by the more imminent interruption of his idyll with his long-lost daughter.</p> <p>He drew up his knees and sat quiet. Much as he wanted to recapture his sense of tranquility, he could not free his mind from the thought of Randall.</p><p>He had won. Claire was his; so was this glorious child\u2014this young woman, he corrected himself, looking at her. But Randall had had the keeping of them for twenty years; there was no doubt he had set his mark on them. But what mark had it been?</p><p>\u201cLook.\u201d Brianna\u2019s hand squeezed his arm as she breathed the word.</p><p>He followed her gaze and saw them; two does, standing just under the shadow of the trees, not twenty feet away. He didn\u2019t move, but breathed quietly. He could feel Brianna beside him, enchanted into stillness too.</p><p>The deer saw them; delicate heads upraised, dark, moist nostrils flaring for scent. After a moment, though, one doe stepped out, dainty, nervous footsteps leaving streaks in the dew-wet grass. The other followed, cautious, and they grazed along the grassy strips between the rocks, turning now and then to lift their head and cast tranquil eyes on the strange but harmless creatures on the ledge.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t have come within a mile of a Scottish red deer that had his scent. The red stags kent weel what a man was.</p> <p>He watched the deer graze, with the innocence of perfect wildness, and felt the sun\u2019s benediction on his head. This was a new place, and he was content to be alone here with his daughter.</p><p>\u201cWhat are we hunting, Da?\u201d He was standing still, eyes squinted as he scanned the horizon, but she was reasonably sure he wasn\u2019t looking at an animal; she could speak without scaring the game.</p><p>They\u2019d seen a good many animals in the course of the day; the two deer at dawn, a red fox that sat watching on a rock, licking dainty black paws until they came too close, then vanishing like a blown-out flame. Squirrels\u2014dozens of them\u2014chattering through the treetops, playing hide-and-seek past the tree boles. Even a flock of wild turkey, with two males strutting, chests puffed and tail fans spread for the edification of a gobbling harem.</p><p>None of these were the chosen prey, for which she was glad. She had no objection to killing for food, but would have been sorry to have the beauty of the day soiled by blood.</p><p>\u201cBees,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cBees? How do you hunt bees?\u201d</p><p>He picked up his gun and smiled at her, nodding downhill toward a brilliant patch of yellow.</p><p>\u201cLook for flowers.\u201d</p> <p>There were certainly bees in the flowers; close enough, and she could hear the hum. There were several different kinds: huge black bumblebees, a smaller kind, striped with black and yellow fuzz, and the smooth lethal shapes of wasps, bellies pointed as daggers.</p><p>\u201cWhat ye want to do,\u201d her father told her, slowly circling the patch, \u201cis to watch and see which direction the honeybees go. And not get stung.\u201d</p><p>A dozen times, they lost sight of the tiny messengers they followed, lost in the broken light over a stream, disappearing into brush too thick to follow. Each time, Jamie cast to and fro, finding another patch of flowers.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s some!\u201d she cried, pointing to a flash of brilliant red in the distance.</p><p>He squinted at them and smiled, shaking his head.</p><p>\u201cNay, not red,\u201d he said. \u201cThe wee hummingbirds like the red ones, but bees like yellow and white\u2014yellow\u2019s best.\u201d He plucked a small white daisy from the grass near her feet and handed it to her\u2014the petals were streaked with pollen, fallen from the delicate stamens in the round yellow center of the bloom. Looking closer, she saw a tiny beetle the size of a pinhead crawl out of the center, its shiny black armor dusted with gold.</p><p>\u201cThe hummingbirds drink from the long-throated flowers,\u201d he explained. \u201cBut the bees canna get all the way inside. They like the broad, flat flowers like this, and the ones that grow in heavy bunches. They light on them and wallow, till they\u2019re covered over wi\u2019 the yellow.\u201d</p><p>They hunted up and down the mountainside, laughing as they dodged the bomber assaults of enraged bumblebees, hunting telltale patches of yellow and white. The bees liked the mountain laurel, but too many of those patches were too high to see over, too dense to pass through.</p><p>It was late afternoon before they found what they were looking for. A snag, the remnants of a good-sized tree, its branches reduced to stumps, bark worn away to show weathered silver wood beneath\u2014and a wide split in the wood, through which the bees were crowding, hanging in a veil around it.</p><p>\u201cOh, good,\u201d Jamie said, with satisfaction at the sight. \u201cSometimes they hive in the rocks, and then there\u2019s little ye can do.\u201d He unslung the ax at his belt, and his bags, and gestured to Brianna to sit down on a nearby rock.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s best to wait till dark,\u201d he explained. \u201cFor then all the swarm will be inside the hive. Meanwhile, will ye have a bite to eat?\u201d</p><p>They shared the rest of the food, and talked sporadically, watching the light fade from the nearby mountains. He let her fire the long musket when she asked, showing her how to load a new round: swab the barrel, patch the ball, ram home ball, patch, and wadding with a charge of powder from the cartridge; pour the rest of the powder into the priming pan of the flintlock.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re no a bad shot at all, lass,\u201d he said, surprised. He bent and picked up a small chunk of wood, setting it on top of a large boulder as a target. \u201cTry again.\u201d</p><p>She did, and again, and again, growing used to the awkward weight of the weapon, finding the lovely balancing point of its length and its natural seat in the curve of her shoulder. It kicked less than she\u2019d expected; black powder hadn\u2019t the force of modern cartridges. Twice chips flew from the boulder; the third time the chunk of wood disappeared in a shower of fragments.</p><p>\u201cVerra nice,\u201d he said, one eyebrow raised. \u201cAnd where in God\u2019s name did ye learn to shoot?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy father was a target shooter.\u201d She lowered the gun, cheeks flushed with pleasure. \u201cHe taught me to shoot with a pistol or a rifle. A shotgun, too.\u201d Then her cheeks flushed a deeper hue, remembering. \u201cUm. You wouldn\u2019t have seen a shotgun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I dinna suppose I have,\u201d was all he said, his face a careful blank.</p><p>\u201cHow will you move the hive?\u201d she asked, wanting to cover the awkward moment. He shrugged.</p><p>\u201cOh, once the bees have gone to their rest, I shall blow a bit o\u2019 smoke into the hive, to keep them stunned. Then chop free the part of the trunk that\u2019s got the combs in it, slide a bit of flat wood beneath it, and wrap it in my plaid. Once at the house, I\u2019ll nail a bit of wood top and bottom, to make a bee gum.\u201d He smiled at her. \u201cCome morning, the bees will come out, look around, and venture out for the nearest flowers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWon\u2019t they realize they aren\u2019t in their proper place?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged again.</p><p>\u201cAnd what will they do about it, if they do? They\u2019ve no means to find their way back, and they\u2019ll have no home left here to come to. Nay, they\u2019ll be content in the new place.\u201d He reached for the gun. \u201cHere, let me clean it; the light\u2019s too bad for shooting.\u201d</p><p>Conversation died, and they sat in silence for half an hour or so, watching darkness fill the hollows below, an invisible tide that crept higher by the minute, engulfing the trunks of the trees so that the green canopies seemed to float on a lake of darkness.</p><p>At last she cleared her throat, feeling that she must say something.</p><p>\u201cWon\u2019t Mama be worried about us, coming back so late?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head, but didn\u2019t answer; only sat, a grass blade drooping idle in his hand. The moon was edging its way above the trees, big and golden, lopsided as a smudged teardrop.</p><p>\u201cYour mother did tell me once that men meant to fly to the moon,\u201d he said abruptly. \u201cThey hadna done it yet, that she knew, but they meant to. Will ye know about that?\u201d</p><p>She nodded, eyes fixed on the rising moon.</p><p>\u201cThey did. They will, I mean. She smiled faintly. \u201cApollo, they called it\u2014the rocket ship that took them.\u201d</p><p>She could see his smile in answer; the moon was high enough to shed its radiance on the clearing. He tilted his face up, considering.</p><p>\u201cAye? And what did they say of it, the men who went?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey didn\u2019t need to say anything\u2014they sent back pictures. I told you about the television?\u201d</p><p>He looked a little startled, and she knew that like most things she had told him from her time, he had no real grasp of the reality of moving, talking pictures, let alone the notion that such things could be sent through thin air.</p><p>\u201cAye?\u201d he said, a little unsurely. \u201cYou\u2019ve seen these pictures, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d She rocked back a little, hands clasped around her knees, looking up at the misshapen globe above them. There was a faint nimbus of light around it, and farther out in the starlit sky, a perfect, hazy ring, as though it were a big yellow stone dropped into a black pond, frozen in place as the first ripple formed.</p><p>\u201cFair weather tomorrow,\u201d he said, looking up at it.</p><p>\u201cWill it be?\u201d She could see everything around them, almost as clearly as in the daylight, but the color had fled now; everything was black and gray\u2014like the pictures she described.</p><p>\u201cIt took hours, waiting. No one could say exactly how long it would take them to land and get out in their space suits\u2014you know there isn\u2019t any air on the moon?\u201d She raised a questioning brow, and he nodded, attentive as a schoolboy.</p><p>\u201cClaire told me so,\u201d he murmured. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThe camera\u2014the thing that made the pictures\u2014was looking out of the side of the ship, so we could see the foot of the ship itself, settled in the dust, and the dust rising up over it like a horse\u2019s hoof when it puts its foot down.</p><p>\u201cIt was flat where the ship came down; covered with a soft, powdery kind of dust, with little rocks scattered on it here and there. Then the camera moved\u2014or maybe another one started sending pictures\u2014and you could see that there were rocky cliffs off in the distance. It\u2019s barren\u2014no plants, no water, no air\u2014but sort of beautiful, in an eerie kind of way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt sounds like Scotland,\u201d he said. She laughed at the joke, but thought she heard under the humor his longing for those barren mountains.</p><p>Wanting to distract him, she waved upward at the stars, beginning to burn brighter in the velvet sky.</p> <p>\u201cThe stars are really suns, like ours. It\u2019s only that they\u2019re so far away from us, they look tiny. They\u2019re so far away that it may take years and years for their light to reach us; in fact, sometimes a star has died and we still see its light.\u201d</p><p>\u201cClaire told me that, long ago,\u201d he said softly. He sat a moment, then got up with an air of decision.</p><p>\u201cCome then,\u201d he said. \u201cLet\u2019s take the hive, and be off home.\u201d</p><p>The night was warm enough that we had left the hide window-covering unpinned and rolled aside. Occasional moths and June bugs blundered in to drown themselves in the cauldron or commit fiery suicide on the hearth, but the cool leaf-scented air that washed over us was worth it.</p><p>On the first night, Ian had gallantly given Brianna the trundle bed and gone off to sleep with Rollo on a pallet in the herb shed, assuring her that he liked the privacy. Leaving, his quilt over one arm, he had clapped Jamie solidly on the back and squeezed his shoulder in a surprisingly adult gesture of congratulation that made me smile.</p> <p>Jamie had smiled, too; in fact, he had scarcely stopped smiling in several days. He wasn\u2019t smiling now, though his face bore a tender, inward look. There was a half-full moon riding the sky, and enough light came through the window for me to see him clearly as he lay on his back beside me.</p><p>I was surprised that he wasn\u2019t asleep yet. He had risen well before dawn and spent the day with Brianna on the mountain, returning long after dark with a plaid full of smoke-stunned bees, who were likely to be more than irritated when they woke in the morning and discovered the trick perpetrated on them. I made a mental note to keep away from the end of the garden where the row of bee gums sat; newly moved bees were inclined to sting first and ask questions afterward.</p><p>Jamie gave a massive sigh, and I rolled toward him, curving myself to fit against him. The night wasn\u2019t cold, but he wore a shirt to bed, in deference to Brianna\u2019s modesty.</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t sleep?\u201d I asked softly. \u201cDoes the moonlight bother you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He was looking out at the moon, though; it rode high above the ridge, not yet full, but a luminous white that flooded the sky.</p><p>\u201cIf it\u2019s not the moon, it\u2019s something.\u201d I rubbed his stomach lightly, and let my fingers curve around the wide arch of his ribs.</p> <p>He sighed again, and squeezed my hand.</p><p>\u201cOch, it\u2019s no more than a foolish regret, Sassenach.\u201d He turned his head toward the trundle bed, where the dark spill of Brianna\u2019s hair fell in a moon-polished mass across the pillow. \u201cI am only sorry that we must lose her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMm.\u201d I let my hand rest flat on his chest. I had known it would come\u2014both the realization and the parting itself\u2014but I hadn\u2019t wanted to speak of it, and break the temporary spell that had bound the three of us so closely.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t really lose a child,\u201d I said softly, one finger tracing the small, smooth hollow in the center of his chest.</p><p>\u201cShe must go back, Sassenach\u2014ye know it as well as I do.\u201d He stirred impatiently but didn\u2019t move away. \u201cLook at her. She\u2019s like Louis\u2019s camel, no?\u201d</p><p>Despite my own regrets, I smiled at the thought. Louis of France kept a fine menagerie at Versailles, and on good days the keepers would exercise certain of the animals, leading them through the spreading gardens, to the edification of startled passersby.</p><p>We had been walking in the gardens one day, and turned a corner to find the Bactrian camel advancing toward us down the path, splendid and stately in its gold and silver harness, towering in calm disdain above a crowd of gawking spectators\u2014strikingly exotic, and utterly out of place among the formalized white statues.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I said, though with a reluctance that squeezed my heart. \u201cYes, of course she\u2019ll have to go back. She belongs there.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI ken that well enough.\u201d He put his own hand over mine, but kept his face turned away, looking at Brianna. \u201cI shouldna grieve for it\u2014but I do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo do I.\u201d I put my forehead against his shoulder, breathing in the clean male scent of him. \u201cIt\u2019s true, though\u2014what I said. You can\u2019t truly lose a child. Do you\u2014do you remember Faith?\u201d</p><p>My voice trembled slightly as I asked it; we had not spoken in years of our first daughter, stillborn in France.</p><p>His arm curled around me, pulling me against him.</p><p>\u201cOf course I do,\u201d he said softly. \u201cD\u2019ye think I would ever forget?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d The tears were flowing down my face, but I was not truly weeping; it was no more than the overflow of feeling. \u201cThat\u2019s what I mean. I never told you\u2014when we were in Paris, to see Jared\u2014I went to the H\u00f4pital des Anges; I saw her grave there. I\u2014I brought her a pink tulip.\u201d</p><p>He was quiet for a moment.</p><p>\u201cI took her violets,\u201d he said, so softly I almost didn\u2019t hear him.</p><p>I was quite still for a moment, tears forgotten.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t tell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeither did you.\u201d His fingers traced the bumps of my spine, brushing softly up and down the line of my back.</p><p>\u201cI was afraid you\u2019d feel...\u201d My voice trailed off. I had been afraid he would feel guilty, worry that I blamed him\u2014I once had\u2014for the loss. We were newly reunited, then; I had no wish to jeopardize the tender link between us.</p><p>\u201cSo was I.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry that you never saw her,\u201d I said at last, and felt him sigh. He turned toward me and put his arms around me, his lips brushing my forehead.</p><p>\u201cIt doesna matter, does it? Aye, it\u2019s true, what ye say, Sassenach. She was\u2014and we will have her, always. And Brianna. If\u2014when she goes\u2014she will still be with us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. It doesn\u2019t matter what happens; no matter where a child goes\u2014how far or how long. Even if it\u2019s forever. You never lose them. You can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t answer, but his arms tightened round me, and he sighed once more. The breeze stirred the air above us with the sound of angels\u2019 wings, and we fell slowly asleep together, as the moonlight bathed us in its ageless peace.</p><p>43</p><p>WHISKY IN THE JAR</p><p>I didn\u2019t like Ronnie Sinclair. I never had liked him. I didn\u2019t like his half-handsome face, his foxy smile, or the way his eyes met mine: so direct, so openly honest, that you knew he was hiding something even when he wasn\u2019t. I particularly didn\u2019t like the way he was looking at my daughter.</p><p>I cleared my throat loudly, making him jump. He turned a sharp-toothed smile on me, idly turning a truss ring in his hands.</p><p>\u201cJamie says he\u2019ll need a dozen more of the small whisky casks by the end of the month, and I\u2019ll need a large barrel of hickory wood for the smoked meat, as soon as you can manage.\u201d</p><p>He nodded and made a number of cryptic marks on a slab of pine that hung on the wall. Oddly for a Scot, Sinclair couldn\u2019t write but had some sort of private shorthand that enabled him to keep track of orders and accounts.</p><p>\u201cRight, Missus Fraser. Anything else?\u201d</p><p>I paused, trying to reckon up all the possible necessities for cooperage that might spring up before snowfall. There would be fish and meat to salt down, but those did better in stoneware jars; wooden casks left them tasting of turpentine. I had a good seasoned barrel for apples and another for squash already; the potatoes would be stored on shelves to keep from rotting.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I decided. \u201cThat will be all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, missus.\u201d He hesitated, twirling the cask band faster. \u201cWill Himself be coming down before the casks are ready?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo; he has the barley to get in, and the slaughtering to do, as well as the distilling. Everything\u2019s late, because of the trial.\u201d I raised an eyebrow at him. \u201cWhy, though? Do you have a message for him?\u201d</p><p>Sited at the foot of the cove nearest the wagon road, the cooper\u2019s shop was the first building most visitors encountered, and thus a reception point for most gossip that came from outside Fraser\u2019s Ridge.</p><p>Sinclair tilted his gingerly head, considering.</p><p>\u201cOch, likely it\u2019s nothing. Only that I\u2019ve heard of a stranger in the district, asking questions about Jamie Fraser.\u201d</p><p>From the corner of my eye, I saw Brianna\u2019s head snap round, distracted at once from her inspection of the spokeshavers, mallets, saws, and axes on the wall. She turned, skirt rustling in the wood shavings that littered the shop, ankle-deep.</p><p>\u201cDo you know the stranger\u2019s name?\u201d she asked anxiously. \u201cOr what he looks like?\u201d</p><p>Sinclair shot her a look of surprise. He was oddly proportioned, with slender shoulders but muscular arms, and hands so huge that they might have belonged to a man twice his height. He looked at her, and his broad thumb unconsciously stroked the metal of the ring, slowly, over and over again.</p><p>\u201cWhy, I couldna speak to his appearance, mistress,\u201d he said, politely enough, but with a hungry look in his eyes that made me want to take the truss ring away from him and wrap it around his neck. \u201cHe gave his name as Hodgepile, though.\u201d</p><p>Brianna\u2019s face lost its look of hope, though the muscle at the edge of her mouth curved slightly at the name.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t suppose that could be Roger,\u201d she murmured to me.</p><p>\u201cLikely not,\u201d I agreed. \u201cHe wouldn\u2019t have any reason to use a false name, anyway.\u201d I turned back to Sinclair.</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t have heard of a man called Wakefield, will you? Roger Wakefield?\u201d</p><p>Sinclair shook his head decisively.</p><p>\u201cNo, missus. Himself has put word about that if such a one should come, he\u2019s to be taken to the Ridge at once. If yon Wakefield sets foot within the county, you\u2019ll hear of it as soon as I do.\u201d</p><p>Brianna sighed, and I heard her swallow her disappointment. It was mid-October, and while she said nothing, she was clearly growing more anxious by the day. She wasn\u2019t the only one, either; she had told us what Roger was trying to do, and the thought of the variety of disasters that might have befallen him in the attempt was enough to keep me wakeful at night.</p><p>\u201c\u2014about the whisky,\u201d Sinclair was saying, jerking my attention back to him.</p><p>\u201cThe whisky? Hodgepile was asking about Jamie and whisky?\u201d</p><p>Sinclair nodded, and set down the truss ring.</p><p>\u201cIn Cross Creek. No one would say a word to him, o\u2019 course. But the one who told me did say as the one who spoke to the man thought him a soldier.\u201d He grimaced briefly. \u201cHard for a lobsterback to wash the flour from his hair.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHe wasn\u2019t dressed as a soldier, surely?\u201d Foot soldiers wore their hair in a tight folded queue, wrapped round a core of lamb\u2019s wool and powdered with rice flour\u2014which, in this climate, rapidly turned to paste as the flour mixed with sweat. Still, I imagined Sinclair meant the man\u2019s attitude rather than his appearance.</p><p>\u201cOch, no; he did claim to be a fur trader\u2014but he walked wi\u2019 a ramrod up his arse, and ye could hear the leather creak when he talked. So Geordie McClintock said.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLikely one of Murchison\u2019s men. I\u2019ll tell Jamie\u2014thank you.\u201d</p><p>I left the cooper\u2019s shop with Brianna, wondering just how much trouble this Hodgepile might prove to be. Likely not much; the sheer distance from civilization and the inaccessibility of the Ridge was protection against most intrusions; one of Jamie\u2019s purposes in choosing it. The multiple inconveniences of remoteness would be outweighed by its benefits, when it came to war. No battle would be fought on Fraser\u2019s Ridge, I was sure of that.</p> <p>And no matter how virulent Murchison\u2019s grudge might be, or how good his spies, I couldn\u2019t see his superiors allowing him to mount an armed expedition more than a hundred miles into the mountains, for the sole purpose of extirpating an illegal distillery whose total output was less than a hundred gallons a year.</p><p>Lizzie and Ian were waiting for us outside, occupied in gathering kindling from Sinclair\u2019s rubbish heap. A cooper\u2019s work generated immense quantities of shavings, splinters, and discarded chunks of wood and bark, and it was worth the labor of picking them up, to save splitting kindling by hand at home.</p><p>\u201cCan you and Ian load the barrels, honey?\u201d I asked Brianna. \u201cI want a look at Lizzie in the sunlight.\u201d</p><p>Brianna nodded, still looking abstracted, and went to help Ian heave the half-dozen small kegs outside the shop into the wagon. They were small, but heavy.</p><p>It was the skill that went into these particular barrels that had earned Ronnie Sinclair his land and shop, in spite of his less than prepossessing personality; not every cooper knew the trick of charring the inside of an oak barrel so as to lend a beautiful amber color and deep smoky flavor to the whisky aging gently inside.</p> <p>\u201cCome here, sweetie. Let me see your eyes.\u201d Lizzie obediently widened her eyes, and let me pull down the lower lid to see the white sclera of the eyeball.</p><p>The girl was still shockingly thin, but the nasty yellow tinge of jaundice was fading from her skin, and her eyes were nearly white again. I cupped my fingers gently under her jaw; lymph glands only slightly swollen\u2014that was better, too.</p><p>\u201cFeeling all right?\u201d I asked. She smiled shyly, and nodded. It was the first time she had been outside the cabin since her arrival with Ian three weeks before; she was still wobbly as a new calf. Frequent infusions of Jesuit bark had helped, though; she had had no fresh attacks of fever in the last week, and I had hopes of clearing up the liver involvement in short order.</p><p>\u201cMrs. Fraser?\u201d she said, and I jumped, startled to hear her talk. She was so shy that she could seldom bring herself to say anything to me or to Jamie directly; she murmured her needs to Brianna, who conveyed them to me.</p><p>\u201cYes, dear?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014I couldna help hearing what yon cooper said\u2014about how Mr. Fraser\u2019s asked word of Miss Brianna\u2019s man. I did wonder\u2014\u201d Her words trailed off in a spasm of shyness, and a faint rose-pink blush showed in her transparent cheeks.</p> <p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCould he ask for my father, do ye think?\u201d The words came out in a rush, and she blushed still harder.</p><p>\u201cOh, Lizzie! I\u2019m sorry.\u201d Brianna, finished with the barrels, came and hugged her little maid. \u201cI hadn\u2019t forgotten, but I hadn\u2019t thought, either. Just a minute, I\u2019ll go and tell Mr. Sinclair.\u201d With a whiff of skirts, she vanished into the cool dimness of the cooper\u2019s shop.</p><p>\u201cYour father?\u201d I asked. \u201cHave you lost him?\u201d</p><p>The girl nodded, pressing her lips together to prevent their quivering.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll ha\u2019 gone as a bondsman, but I dinna ken where; only it would be to the southern colonies.\u201d</p><p>Well, that limited the search to several hundred thousand square miles, I thought. Still, it could do no harm to ask Ronnie Sinclair to put out word. Newspapers and other printed matter were scarce in the South; most real news still passed by word of mouth, handed on in shops and taverns, or carried by slaves and servants between far-flung plantations.</p><p>The thought of newspapers gave me a small nasty jolt of remembrance. Still, seven years seemed comfortingly far away\u2014and Brianna must be right; whether the house was doomed to burn on January 21 or not, surely it would be possible for us not to be in it on that date?</p> <p>Brianna appeared, rather red in the face, swung aboard the wagon, and picked up the reins, waiting impatiently for the rest of us.</p><p>Ian, seeing her flushed face, frowned and glanced toward the cooper\u2019s shop.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it, Coz? Did yon wee mannie say aught amiss to ye?\u201d He flexed his hands, nearly as large as Sinclair\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said tersely. \u201cNot a word. Are we ready to go?\u201d</p><p>Ian picked Lizzie up and swung her into the wagon bed, then put out a hand and helped me up on the seat by Brianna. He glanced at the reins in Brianna\u2019s hands; he had taught her to drive the mules, and took professional pride in her skill.</p><p>\u201cWatch the bugger on the gee side,\u201d he advised her. \u201cHe\u2019ll no be pullin\u2019 his share o\u2019 the load, unless ye touch him up now and again wi\u2019 a slap across the rump.\u201d</p><p>He subsided into the wagon bed with Lizzie as we set off up the road. I could hear him telling her outlandish stories, and her faint giggle in reply. The baby of his own family, Ian was charmed by Lizzie and treated her like a younger sister, by turns nuisance and pet.</p><p>I glanced over my shoulder at the receding cooper\u2019s shop, then at Brianna.</p><p>\u201cWhat did he do?\u201d I asked, quietly.</p><p>\u201cNothing. I interrupted him.\u201d The flush across her wide cheekbones grew deeper.</p><p>\u201cWhat on earth was he doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDrawing pictures on a piece of wood,\u201d she said, and bit the inside of her cheek. \u201cOf nak*d women.\u201d</p><p>I laughed, as much from shock as from amusement.</p><p>\u201cWell, he hasn\u2019t got a wife, and not likely to get one soon; women are very scarce in the colony generally, and even more so up here. I suppose one can\u2019t blame him.\u201d</p><p>I felt an unexpected pang of sympathy for Ronnie Sinclair. He\u2019d been alone for a very long time, after all. His wife had died in the terrible days after Culloden, and he himself had spent more than ten years in prison before being transported to the Colonies. If he had made connections here, they had not endured; he was a solitary man, and suddenly I saw his avid questing for gossip, his stealthy watching\u2014even his use of Brianna for artistic inspiration\u2014in a different light. I knew what it was like to be lonely.</p><p>Brianna\u2019s embarrassment had faded, and she was whistling softly under her breath, hunched casually over the reins\u2014a Beatles\u2019 tune, I thought, though I never could keep pop groups straight.</p><p>The idle thought floated insidiously through my mind; if Roger didn\u2019t come, she wouldn\u2019t be left alone for long, either here or when she returned to the future. But that was ridiculous. He would come. And if not...</p><p>A thought I had been trying to keep at bay sneaked past my defenses and appeared in my mind, full-blown. What if he had chosen not to come? I knew they had had some sort of argument, though Brianna had been tight-lipped about it. Had he been so infuriated that he would go back without her?</p><p>I rather thought the possibility had occurred to her, too; she had stopped speaking much of Roger, but I saw the anxious light spring up in her eyes whenever Clarence announced a visitor, and saw it die each time the visitor proved to be one of Jamie\u2019s tenants, or some of Ian\u2019s Tuscaroran friends.</p><p>\u201cHurry up, you blighter,\u201d I muttered under my breath. Brianna caught it, and smartly snapped the reins over the left mule\u2019s rump.</p><p>\u201cGee up!\u201d she shouted, and the wagon rattled faster, jolting over the narrow track toward home.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a far cry from the still-cellar at Leoch,\u201d Jamie said, ruefully poking at the makeshift pot still at the edge of the small clearing. \u201cIt does make whisky, though\u2014of a sort.\u201d</p><p>In spite of his diffidence, Brianna could see that he was proud of his infant distillery. It was nearly two miles from the cabin, located\u2014as he explained\u2014close to Fergus\u2019s place, so that Marsali could come up several times a day to keep an eye on the operation. In return for this service, she and Fergus had a slightly larger share in the resulting whisky than did the other farmers on the Ridge, who supplied the raw barley and helped in the distribution of the liquor.</p><p>\u201cNo, darlin\u2019, ye dinna want to be eating that nasty wee thing,\u201d Marsali said firmly. She grasped her son\u2019s wrist and began prying open his fingers, one by one, in an effort to free the large and madly wriggling insect that\u2014in open contradiction of his mother\u2019s adjuration\u2014he very obviously did want to be eating.</p><p>\u201cFeh!\u201d Marsali dropped the cockroach on the ground and stamped on it.</p><p>Germaine, a stoic, stubby child, didn\u2019t cry at the loss of his treat, but glowered balefully under his blond fringe. The cockroach, nothing daunted by rough treatment, rose out of the leaf mold and walked off, staggering only slightly.</p><p>\u201cOh, I shouldna think it would do him harm,\u201d Ian said, amused. \u201cI\u2019ve eaten them, now and again, wi\u2019 the Indians. The locusts are better, though\u2014especially the smoked ones.\u201d</p><p>Marsali and Brianna both made gagging noises, causing Ian to grin even wider. He picked up another bag of barley and poured a thick layer into a flat rush basket. Two more roaches, suddenly exposed to the light of day, skittered madly over the side of the basket, fell to the ground and dashed away, disappearing under the edge of the crudely built malting floor.</p><p>\u201cNo, I said!\u201d Marsali kept a tight hold on Germaine\u2019s collar, preventing his determined attempts to follow them. \u201cStay, ye wee fiend, d\u2019ye want to be smoked, too?\u201d Small wisps of transparent smoke rose up through the cracks of the wooden platform, permeating the small clearing with the breakfast-like scent of roasting grain. Brianna felt her stomach gurgle; it was nearly suppertime.</p><p>\u201cMaybe you should leave them in,\u201d she suggested, joking. \u201cSmoked roaches might add a nice flavor to the whisky.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI doubt they\u2019d harm it any,\u201d her father agreed, coming up beside her. He wiped his face with a handkerchief, looked at it, and made a slight face at the sooty smudges on it before tucking it back up his sleeve. \u201cAll right, Ian?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, it\u2019ll do. It\u2019s only the one bag that\u2019s spoilt all through, Uncle Jamie.\u201d Ian rose with his tray of raw barley, and kicked negligently at a split bag, where the soft green of mold and black tinge of rot showed the ill effects of seeping damp. Two more opened bags, with the spoiled top layer scooped off, sat by the edge of the malting floor.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s finish, then,\u201d Jamie said. \u201cI\u2019m starved.\u201d He and Ian each seized a burlap bag and scattered the fresh barley in a thick layer over the clear space on the platform, using a flat wooden spade to flatten and turn the grain. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHow long does it all take?\u201d Brianna poked her nose over the edge of the mash tub, where Marsali was stirring the fermenting grain of the last smoking. The mash had only begun to work; there was no more than a faint whiff of alcohol in the air.</p><p>\u201cOh, it will depend on the weather, a bit.\u201d Marsali cast an experienced eye skyward. It was late afternoon, and the sky had begun to darken into a clear deep blue, with no more than streaks of white cloud floating over the horizon. \u201cClear as it is, I should say\u2014Germaine!\u201d Germaine\u2019s bottom was the only part of him visible, the top half having disappeared under a log.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get him.\u201d Brianna took three quick strides across the clearing, and scooped him up. Germaine made a deep sound of protest at this unwarranted interference, and began to kick, hammering his sturdy heels against her legs.</p><p>\u201cOw!\u201d Brianna set him on the ground, rubbing her thigh with one hand.</p> <p>Marsali made a sound of exasperation and dropped her ladle. \u201cNow what have ye got, ye wicked thing?\u201d Germaine, having learned from experience, popped his latest acquisition into his mouth and swallowed convulsively. He immediately turned purple and began to choke.</p><p>With a cry of alarm, Marsali dropped to her knees and tried to pry his mouth open. Germaine gagged, wheezed, and staggered backward, shaking his head. His blue eyes bulged, and a thin line of drool snaked down his chin.</p><p>\u201cHere!\u201d Brianna grabbed the little boy by the arm, pulled his back against her, and with both hands fisted into his stomach, jerked them sharply back.</p><p>Germaine made a loud whooping noise, and something small and round shot out of his mouth. He gurgled, gasped for air, got a good lungful and started to howl, his face going from dusky purple to a healthy red within seconds.</p><p>\u201cIs he all right?\u201d Jamie peered anxiously at the little boy, who was crying in his mother\u2019s arms, then, satisfied, glanced at Brianna. \u201cThat was verra quick, lass. A good job.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThanks. I\u2014thanks. I\u2019m glad it worked.\u201d</p><p>Brianna felt a little shaky. Seconds. It hadn\u2019t taken more than a few seconds. Life to death and back again, in nothing flat. Jamie touched her arm, giving her a brief squeeze, and she felt a little better.</p><p>\u201cBest take the laddie down to the house,\u201d he told Marsali. \u201cGive him his supper and put him to bed. We\u2019ll finish here.\u201d</p><p>Marsali nodded, looking shaken herself. She brushed a strand of pale hair out of her eyes, and gave Brianna a poor attempt at a smile.</p><p>\u201cI thank ye, good-sister.\u201d</p><p>Brianna felt a surprising small glow of pleasure at the title. She gave Marsali back the smile.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m glad he\u2019s all right.\u201d</p><p>Marsali picked up her bag from the ground, and with a nod to Jamie, turned and made her way carefully down the steep path, toddler in her arms, Germaine\u2019s chubby fists twined tightly in her hair.</p><p>\u201cThat was pretty work, Coz.\u201d Ian had finished the spreading, and jumped down from the platform to congratulate her. \u201cWhere did ye learn a thing like that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrom my mother.\u201d</p><p>Ian nodded, looking impressed. Jamie bent over, searching the ground nearby.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it the laddie swallowed, I wonder?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis.\u201d Brianna spotted the object, half buried under fallen leaves, and plucked it out. \u201cIt looks like a button.\u201d The object was a lopsided circle, crudely carved from wood, but indisputably a button, with a long shank and holes bored for thread.</p><p>\u201cLet me see.\u201d Jamie held out a hand, and she dropped the button into it.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019ll no be missing any buttons, will ye, Ian?\u201d he asked, frowning at the small object in his palm.</p><p>Ian peered over Jamie\u2019s shoulder, and shook his head. \u201cMaybe Fergus?\u201d he suggested.</p><p>\u201cMaybe, but I dinna think so. Our Fergus is too much the dandy to be wearin\u2019 something like this. All the buttons on his coat are made of polished horn.\u201d He shook his head slowly, still frowning, then shrugged. Picking up his sporran, he put the button into it before fastening it about his waist.</p><p>\u201cAh, well. I\u2019ll ask about. Will ye finish here, Ian? There\u2019s no much left to do.\u201d He smiled at Brianna and cocked his head toward the path. \u201cCome then, lass; we\u2019ll ask at Lindseys\u2019, on our way home.\u201d</p><p>In the event, Kenny Lindsey was not at home.</p><p>\u201cDuncan Innes came to fetch him, not an hour since,\u201d Mrs. Lindsey said, shading her eyes against the late sun as she stood in the doorway of her house. \u201cI make nay doubt they\u2019ll be to your house the noo. Will ye and your lassie no step in, Mac Dubh, and have a taste of something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, no, I thank ye, Mrs. Kenny. My wife will be having the supper ready for us. But perhaps ye could be tellin\u2019 me whether this wee bawbee is from Kenny\u2019s coat?\u201d</p><p>Mrs. Lindsey peered at the button in his hand, then shook her head.</p><p>\u201cNo, indeed. Have I not just finished sewing on a whole fresh set of buttons for him, that\u2019s he\u2019s carved from the bone of a deer? The bonniest things ye ever saw, too,\u201d she declared, with pride in her husband\u2019s craftsmanship. \u201cEach one has got a wee face on it, grinnin\u2019 like an imp, and each one different!\u201d</p><p>Her eye ran speculatively over Brianna.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s Kenny\u2019s brother, now,\u201d she said. \u201cWith a fine wee place near Cross Creek\u2014twenty acres in tobacco, and a good creek through it. He\u2019ll be at the Gathering at Mount Helicon; perhaps you\u2019ll be going, Mac Dubh?\u201d</p><p>Jamie shook his head, smiling at the bald hint. There were few available women in the colony, and even though Jamie had given it out that Brianna was promised elsewhere, this had not by any means put a stop to the matchmaking attempts.</p><p>\u201cI fear not this year, Mrs. Kenny. Perhaps the next, but I canna spare the time just now.\u201d</p><p>They took their leave politely, and turned toward home, the sinking sun at their backs casting long shadows on the path ahead of them.</p><p>\u201cDo you think the button\u2019s important?\u201d Brianna asked curiously.</p><p>Jamie shrugged slightly. A light breeze lifted the hair on the crown of his head, and tugged at the leather thong that held it back.</p><p>\u201cI canna say. It could be nothing\u2014but it could be something, too. Your mother told me what Ronnie Sinclair said, about the man in Cross Creek, asking about the whisky.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHodgepile?\u201d Brianna couldn\u2019t help smiling at the name. Jamie returned the smile briefly, then became serious again.</p><p>\u201cAye. If the button belongs to someone on the Ridge\u2014they ken well enough where the still is, and they might stop to look and no harm done. But if it was to be a stranger...\u201d He glanced at her and shrugged again.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s none so easy for a man to pass unnoticed here\u2014unless he should be hiding a-purpose. A man come for any innocent reason would stop at a house for a bit of food and drink, and I\u2019d hear of it the same day. But there\u2019s been nothing of the sort. Nor would it be an Indian; they dinna use such things in their clothing.\u201d</p><p>A gust of wind whirred across the path in a swirl of brown and yellow leaves, and they turned uphill, toward the cabin. They walked in near silence, affected by the growing quiet of the woods; the birds were still singing twilight songs, but the shadows were lengthening under the trees. The northern slope of the mountain across the valley had already gone dark and silent, as the sun edged behind it.</p><p>The cabin\u2019s clearing was still filled with sunlight, though, filtered through a yellow blaze of chestnut trees. Claire was in the palisaded garden, a basin on one hip, snapping beans from poled vines. Her slender figure was silhouetted dark against the sun, her hair a great aureole of curly gold.</p><p>\u201cInnisfree,\u201d Brianna said involuntarily, stopping dead at the sight.</p><p>\u201cInnisfree?\u201d Jamie glanced at her, bewildered.</p><p>She hesitated, but there was no way out of explaining.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a poem, or part of one. Daddy always used to say it, when he\u2019d come home and find Mama puttering in her garden\u2014he said she\u2019d live out there if she could. He used to joke that she\u2014that she\u2019d leave us someday, and go find a place where she could live by herself, with nothing but her plants.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d Jamie\u2019s face was calm, its broad planes ruddy in the dying light. \u201cHow does the poem go, then?\u201d</p><p>She was conscious of a small tightness round her heart as she said it.</p><p>\u201cI will arise and go now, and go to Innisfree,</p><p>And a small cabin build there, of clay and wattles made:</p><p>Nine bean-rows will I have there, a hive for the honey-bee.</p><p>And live alone in the bee-loud glade.\u201d</p><p>The thick red brows drew together slightly, sparking in the sun.</p><p>\u201cA poem, is it? And where is Innisfree?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIreland, maybe. He was Irish,\u201d Brianna said in explanation. \u201cThe poet.\u201d The row of bee gums stood squat on their stones at the edge of the wood.</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>Tiny motes of gold and black drifted past them through honeyed air\u2014bees homing from the fields. Her father made no move to go forward, but stood silent by her side, watching her mother pick beans, black and gold among the leaves.</p><p>Not alone, after all, she thought. But the small tightness stayed in her chest, not quite an ache.</p><p>Kenny Lindsey took a sip of whisky, closed his eyes, and rolled the liquor round his tongue like a professional wine taster. He paused, frowning in concentration, then swallowed with a convulsive gulp.</p><p>\u201cHoo!\u201d He drew breath, shuddering all over.</p><p>\u201cChrist,\u201d he said hoarsely. \u201cThat\u2019ll strip your tripes!\u201d</p><p>Jamie grinned at the compliment, and poured another small measure, shoving it toward Duncan.</p><p>\u201cAye, it\u2019s better than the last,\u201d he agreed, with a cautious sniff before essaying his own drink. \u201cThis one doesna take the hide off your tongue\u2014quite.\u201d</p><p>Lindsay wiped his mouth with the back of his hand, nodding in agreement.</p><p>\u201cWeel, it\u2019ll find a good home. Woolam wants a cask\u2014that\u2019ll last him a year, the way yon Quakers dole it out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYe\u2019ve agreed a price?\u201d</p><p>Lindsay nodded, sniffing appreciatively at the platter of bannocks and savories that Lizzie set in front of him.</p><p>\u201cA hundredweight of barley for the cask; another, if ye\u2019ll go halves wi\u2019 him in the whisky from it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s fair.\u201d Jamie took a bannock and chewed absently for a moment. Then he raised one brow at Duncan, seated across the table.</p><p>\u201cWill ye ask MacLeod on Naylor\u2019s Creek will he make us the same bargain? You\u2019ll pass that way going home, aye?\u201d</p><p>Duncan nodded, chewing, and Jamie lifted his cup to me in a silent toast of celebration\u2014Woolam\u2019s offer made a total of eight hundred pounds of barley, scraped together by barter and promise. More than the surplus output of every field on the Ridge; the raw material for next year\u2019s whisky.</p><p>\u201cA cask each to the houses on the Ridge, two to Fergus\u2014\u201d Jamie pulled absently at his earlobe, calculating. \u201cTwo, maybe, to Nacognaweto, one kept back to age\u2014aye, we can spare maybe a dozen casks for the Gathering, Duncan.\u201d</p><p>Duncan\u2019s coming was opportune. While Jamie had managed to barter the first year\u2019s crop of raw whisky to the Moravians in Salem for the tools, cloth, and other things we so urgently needed, there was no doubt that the wealthy Scottish planters of the Cape Fear would make a better market. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>We couldn\u2019t possibly spare time away from the homestead for long enough to make the week-long journey to Mount Helicon, but if Duncan could take the whisky down and sell it...I was already making lists in my head.

Wool, cloth, tools, food, animals...I urgently needed a small copper kettle, and six lengths of fresh muslin for shifts, and...</p><p>\u201cDo you think you should give alcohol to the Indians?\u201d Brianna\u2019s question pulled me from my greedy reverie.</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d Lindsey asked, a little disapproving of her intrusion. \u201cAfter all, we\u2019re no going to give it to them, lass. They\u2019ve little silver, but they pay in hides\u2014and they pay well.\u201d</p><p>Brianna glanced at me for support, then at Jamie.</p> <p>\u201cBut Indians don\u2019t\u2014I mean I\u2019ve heard that they can\u2019t handle alcohol.\u201d</p><p>All three men looked at her uncomprehendingly, and Duncan looked at his cup, turning it round in his hand.</p><p>\u201cHandle it?\u201d</p><p>The corner of her mouth quirked inward.</p><p>\u201cThey get drunk easily, I mean.\u201d</p> <p>Lindsey peered into his cup, then looked at her, rubbing a hand over the balding crown of his head.</p><p>\u201cYe\u2019ve a point, lass?\u201d he said, more or less politely.</p><p>Brianna\u2019s full mouth compressed itself, then relaxed.</p><p>\u201cI mean,\u201d she said, \u201cit seems wrong to encourage people to drink, who can\u2019t stop drinking if they start.\u201d She looked at me, a little helplessly. I shook my head.</p><p>\u201c \u2018Alcoholic\u2019 isn\u2019t a noun yet,\u201d I said. \u201cIt\u2019s not a disease now\u2014just weak character.\u201d</p><p>Jamie glanced up at her quizzically.</p> <p>\u201cWell, I\u2019ll tell ye, lass,\u201d he said, \u201cI\u2019ve seen many a drunkard in my day, but I\u2019ve yet to see a bottle leap off a table and pour itself down anyone\u2019s throat.\u201d</p><p>There were general grunts of agreement with this, and another small round to accompany the change of subject.</p><p>\u201cHodgepile? No, I\u2019ve not seen the man, though I do believe I\u2019ve heard the name.\u201d Duncan swilled the rest of his drink and set down his cup, wheezing gently. \u201cYou\u2019ll want me to ask at the Gathering?\u201d</p><p>Jamie nodded, and took another bannock. \u201cAye, if ye will, Duncan.\u201d</p><p>Lizzie was bent over the fire, stirring the stew for supper. I saw her shoulders tighten, but she was too shy to speak before so many men. Brianna suffered no such inhibitions.</p><p>\u201cI have someone to ask after, too, Mr. Innes.\u201d She leaned over the table toward him, eyes fixed on him in earnest entreaty. \u201cWill you ask for a man named Roger Wakefield? Please?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOch, indeed. Indeed I will.\u201d Duncan went pink at the proximity of Brianna\u2019s bosom, and in confusion drank down the rest of Kenny\u2019s whisky. \u201cIs there aught else I can do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I said, putting down a fresh cup in front of the disgruntled Lindsey. \u201cWhile you\u2019re asking after Hodgepile and Bree\u2019s young man, would you also ask for a man named Joseph Wemyss? He\u2019ll be a bondsman.\u201d From the corner of my eye, I saw Lizzie\u2019s thin shoulders slump in relief.</p> <p>Duncan nodded, his composure restored as Brianna disappeared into the pantry to fetch butter. Kenny Lindsey looked after her, interested.</p><p>\u201cBree? Is that the name ye call your daughter?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I said. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>A smile showed briefly on Lindsey\u2019s face. Then he glanced at Jamie, coughed, and buried the smile in his cup.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a Scots word, Sassenach,\u201d Jamie said, a rather wry smile appearing on his own face. \u201cA bree is a great disturbance.\u201d</p><p>44</p><p>THREE-CORNERED CONVERSATION</p><p>October 1769</p><p>The shock of impact juddered through his arms. With a rhythm born of long practice, Jamie jerked the axhead free, swung it back and brought it down in a tchunk! of splintered bark and yellow wood chips. He shifted his foot on the log and struck again, the ax blow judged to a nicety, sharp metal embedded in the wood a scant two inches from his toes.</p><p>He could have told Ian off to do the chopping, and gone himself to fetch the flour from the tiny mill at Woolam\u2019s Point, but the lad deserved the treat of a visit with the three unmarried Woolam daughters who worked with their father in the mill. They were Quaker girls, dressed drab as sparrows, but lively of wit and fair of face, and they made a pet of Ian, vying with each other to offer him small beer and meat pies when he came.</p><p>A good deal better the lad should spend his time flirting with virtuous Quakers than with the bold-eyed Indian lassies over the ridge, he thought, with a little grimness. He hadn\u2019t forgotten what Myers had said about Indian women taking men to their beds as they liked.</p><p>He had sent the wee bondmaid with Ian as well, thinking the brisk fall air might bring a bit of color to the lassie\u2019s face. The wean was white-skinned as Claire, but with the sickly blue-white cast of skimmed milk, not Claire\u2019s pale glow, rich and grainless as the silk-white heartwood of a poplar tree.</p><p>The log was nearly split; one more blow, and a twist of the ax, and two good chunks lay ready for the hearth, smelling clean and sharp with resin. He stacked them neatly on the growing woodpile next to the pantry, and rolled another half log into place beneath his foot.</p><p>The truth of it was that he liked chopping wood. Quite different from the damp, backbreaking, foot-freezing job of cutting peats, but with that same feeling of soul-deep satisfaction at seeing a good stock of fuel laid by, which only those who have spent winters shivering in thin clothes can know. The woodpile reached nearly to the eaves of the house by now, dry split chunks of pine and oak, hickory and maple, the sight of them warming his heart as much as the wood itself would warm his flesh.</p><p>Speak of warmth; it was a warm day for late October, and his shirt was clinging to his shoulders already. He wiped a sleeve across his face and examined the damp patch critically.</p><p>If he got wringing, Brianna would insist on washing it again, protest as he might that sweat was clean enough. \u201cPhew,\u201d she would say, with a disapproving nostril-flare, wrinkling her long nose up like a possum. He had laughed out loud when he first saw her do it; as much from surprise as from amusement.</p><p>His mother had died long ago, in his childhood, and while the odd memory of her came now and then in dreams, he had mostly replaced her presence with static pictures, frozen images in his mind. But she had said \u201cPhew!\u201d to him when he came in mucky, and wrinkled up her long nose in just that way\u2014it had come back with a flash when he saw Brianna do it.</p><p>What a mystery blood was\u2014how did a tiny gesture, a tone of voice, endure through generations like the harder verities of flesh? He had seen it again and again, watching his nieces and nephews grow, and accepted without thought the echoes of parent and grandparent that appeared for brief moments, the shadow of a face looking back through the years\u2014that vanished again into the face that was now.</p><p>Yet now that he saw it in Brianna...he could watch her for hours, he thought, and was reminded of his sister, bending close over each of her newborn bairns in fascination. Perhaps that was why parents watched their weans in such enchantment, he thought; finding out all the tiny links between them, that bound the chains of life, one generation to the next.</p><p>He shrugged, and pulled the shirt off. It was his own place, after all; there was no one to see the marks on his back, and no one whose business it would be to care if they did. The air was chill and sudden on his damp skin, but a few swings of the ax brought the warm blood pulsing back again.</p><p>He loved all Jenny\u2019s children deeply\u2014especially Ian, the wee gowk whose mixture of foolishness and pigheaded courage reminded him so much of himself at that age. They were his blood, after all. But Brianna...</p><p>Brianna was his blood, and his flesh as well. An unspoken promise kept to his own parents; his gift to Claire, and hers to him.</p><p>Not for the first time, he found himself wondering about Frank Randall. And what had Randall thought, holding the child of another man\u2014and a man he had no cause to love?</p><p>Perhaps Randall had been the better man, come to that\u2014to harbor a child for her mother\u2019s sake, and not his own; to search her face with joy only in its beauty, and not because he saw himself reflected there. He felt vaguely ashamed, and struck down with greater force to exorcise the feeling.</p><p>His mind was concerned entirely with its thoughts, and not at all with his actions. While he used it, though, the ax was as much a part of his body as the arms that swung it. Just as a twinge in wrist or elbow would have warned him instantly of damage, some faint vibration, some subtle shift in weight arrested him in midswing, so that the loosened axhead flew harmlessly across the clearing, rather than slamming into his vulnerable foot.</p><p>\u201cDeo gratias,\u201d he muttered, with rather less thankfulness than the words indicated. He crossed himself perfunctorily and went to pick up the slab of metal. Damn the dry weather; it hadn\u2019t rained in nearly a month, and the shrunken haft of his ax was less worrying than the drooping heads of the plants in Claire\u2019s garden near the house.</p><p>He cast a glance at the half-dug well, shrugging in irritation. Another thing that must be done, which there wasn\u2019t time to do. It would have to wait a bit; they could haul water from the creek or melt snow, but without wood to burn they would starve or freeze, or both.</p><p>The door opened and Claire came out, cloak on against the chill of autumn shadows, her basket over her arm. Brianna was behind her, and at sight of them he forgot his annoyance.</p><p>\u201cWhat have you done?\u201d Claire said at once, seeing him with the axhead in one hand. Her eyes flicked over him quickly, looking for blood.</p><p>\u201cNay, I\u2019m whole,\u201d he assured her. \u201cIt\u2019s only I\u2019ve got to mend the handle. You\u2019ll be foraging?\u201d He nodded at Claire\u2019s basket.</p><p>\u201cI thought we\u2019d try up the stream, for wood ears.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh? Dinna go too far, aye? There are Indians hunting the far mountain. I smelt them on the ridge this morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou smelled them?\u201d Brianna asked.</p><p>One red brow went up in inquiry. He saw Claire glance from Brianna to him and smile slightly, to herself; it was one of his own gestures, then. He lifted one brow, looking at Claire, and saw her smile grow wider.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s autumn, and they\u2019re dryin\u2019 venison,\u201d he explained to Brianna. \u201cYe can smell the smoking fires a great ways away, if the wind sets right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe won\u2019t go far,\u201d Claire assured him. \u201cJust above the trout pool.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, well. I daresay it\u2019s safe enough.\u201d He felt some reluctance at letting the women go, but he could scarcely keep them mewed up in the house only because there were savages nearby\u2014the Indians were no doubt peacefully employed as he was himself, in making winter preparations.</p><p>If he knew for sure it was Nacognaweto\u2019s folk, he wouldn\u2019t worry, but as it was, the hunting parties often roamed far afield and it could as easily be Cherokee, or the odd small tribe that called themselves the Dog People. There was only one village of them left, and they were deeply suspicious of white strangers\u2014not without reason.</p><p>Brianna\u2019s eyes rested on his bare chest for a moment, at the tiny knot of puckered scar tissue, but she showed no sign of disgust or curiosity\u2014nor did she when she laid her hand briefly on his shoulder, kissing his cheek in goodbye, though he knew she must feel the healed welts beneath her fingers. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Claire would have told her, he supposed\u2014all about Jack Randall, and the days before the Rising. Or perhaps not quite all. A small shiver that had nothing to do with cold ran up the crease of his spine, and he stepped back, away from her touch, though he still smiled at her.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s bread in the hutch, and a little stew left in the kettle for you and Ian and Lizzie.\u201d Claire reached up and flicked a stray wood chip from his hair. \u201cDon\u2019t eat the pudding in the pantry; that\u2019s for supper.\u201d</p><p>He caught her fingers in his and kissed her knuckles lightly. She looked surprised, and then a faint warm glow came up under her skin. She came up a-tiptoe and kissed his mouth, then hurried after Brianna, already at the edge of the clearing.</p><p>\u201cBe careful!\u201d he called after them. They waved, and disappeared into the woods, leaving him with their kisses soft on his face.</p> <p>\u201cDeo gratias,\u201d he murmured again, watching them, and this time spoke with heartfelt gratitude. He waited until the last flicker of Brianna\u2019s cloak had vanished, before returning to his work.</p><p>He sat on the chopping block, a handful of square-headed nails on the ground beside him, carefully driving them one at a time into the end of the ax handle with a small mallet. The dry wood split and spread, but held by the iron enclosure of the axhead, could not splinter.</p><p>He twisted the head, then finding it firm, stood up and brought the ax down in a mighty blow on the chopping block, by way of test. It held.</p><p>He was chilled now, from sitting, and pulled his shirt back on. He was hungry, too, but he would wait a bit for the young ones. Not but what they had likely stuffed themselves already, he thought cynically. He could almost smell the meat pies Sarah Woolam made, the rich scent twining in his memory through the actual autumn smells of dead leaves and damp earth.</p><p>The thought of meat pies lingered in his mind as he went on with his work, along with the thought of winter. The Indians said it would be hard, this winter, not like the last. How would it be, hunting in deep snow? It snowed in Scotland, of course, but often enough it lay light on the ground, and the trodden paths of the red deer showed black on the steep, bare mountainsides.</p> <p>Last winter had been like that. But this wilderness was given to extremes. He had heard stories of snowfalls that lay six feet deep, valleys where a man might sink to his oxters, and ice that froze so thick on the creeks that a bear could walk across. He smiled a little grimly, thinking of bears. Well, and that would be eating for the whole winter if he could kill another, and the skin would not come amiss, either.</p><p>His thoughts drifted slowly into the rhythm of his work, one part of his mind dimly occupied with the words to \u201cDaddy\u2019s Gone A-Hunting,\u201d while the other was taken up with a intriguingly vivid picture of Claire\u2019s white skin, pale and intoxicant as Rhenish wine against the glossy black of a bearskin.</p><p>\u201cDaddy\u2019s gone to fetch a skin / To wrap his baby bunting in,\u201d he murmured tunelessly under his breath.</p><p>He wondered just how much Claire had told Brianna. It was odd, though pleasant, their three-cornered way of talking; he and the lassie were a bit shy yet with each other\u2014inclined to say personal things to Claire instead, confident that she would pass on their essence; their interpreter in this new and awkward language of the heart.</p><p>Thankful though he was for the miracle of his daughter, he wanted to make love to his wife in his bed again. It was getting overchilly to be having at it in the herb shed or the forest\u2014though he would admit that floundering nak*d in the huge drifts of yellow chestnut leaves had a certain charm, even if it lacked dignity.</p><p>\u201cAye, well,\u201d he muttered, smiling slightly to himself. \u201cAnd when did a man ever worry for his dignity, doin\u2019 that?\u201d</p> <p>He glanced thoughtfully at the pile of long, straight pine logs that lay at the side of the clearing, then at the sun. If Ian was quick enough returning, they might shape and notch a dozen or so before sunset.</p><p>Setting down the ax for a moment, he crossed to the house and began to pace out the dimensions of the new room he planned, to make do while the big house was a-building. She was a grown woman, Brianna\u2014she should have a wee place of her own, to be private in, she and the maid. And if that restored his own privacy with Claire, well, so much the better, aye?</p><p>He heard the small crackling noises among the dried leaves in the yard, but didn\u2019t turn round. There was a tiny cough behind him, like a squirrel sneezing.</p><p>\u201cMrs. Lizzie,\u201d he said, eyes still on the ground. \u201cAnd did ye enjoy your ride? I trust ye found all the Woolams well.\u201d Where was Ian and the wagon? he wondered. He hadn\u2019t heard it on the road below.</p><p>She didn\u2019t speak, but made an inarticulate noise that made him swing round in surprise to look at her.</p><p>She was pale and pinch-faced and looked like a scared white mouse. This was not unusual; he knew he frightened her with his size and deep voice, and so he spoke gently to her, slowly, as he would have done to a mistreated dog.</p><p>\u201cHave ye had an accident, lass? Has something come amiss wi\u2019 the wagon or the horses?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head, still wordless. Her eyes were nearly round, gray as the hem of her washed-out gown, and the tip of her nose had gone bright pink.</p> <p>\u201cIs Ian all right?\u201d He didn\u2019t want to upset her further, but she was beginning to alarm him. Something had happened, that was sure.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine, Uncle. So are the horses.\u201d Quiet as an Indian, Ian appeared round the corner of the cabin. He moved to Lizzie\u2019s side, offering her the support of his presence, and she took his arm as though by reflex.</p><p>He glanced from one to the other; Ian was outwardly calm, but his inner agitation was plain to see.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s happened?\u201d he asked, more sharply than he\u2019d intended. The lassie flinched.</p><p>\u201cYe\u2019d better tell him,\u201d Ian said. \u201cThere might not be much time.\u201d He touched her shoulder in encouragement, and she seemed to take strength from his hand; she stood up straighter and bobbed her head.</p><p>\u201cI\u2014there was\u2014I saw a man. At the mill, sir.\u201d</p><p>She tried to speak further, but her nerve had dried up; the tip of her tongue protruded between her teeth with effort, but no words came out.</p><p>\u201cShe kent him, Uncle,\u201d Ian said. He looked disturbed, but not afraid; excited, rather, in an unfamiliar way. \u201cShe\u2019d seen him before\u2014with Brianna.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye?\u201d He tried to speak encouragingly, but the hair on the back of his neck was rising with premonition.</p><p>\u201cAt Wilmington,\u201d Lizzie got out. \u201cMacKenzie was his name; I heard a sailor call him so.\u201d</p><p>Jamie glanced quickly at Ian, who shook his head.</p><p>\u201cHe didna give his place, but I dinna ken any from Leoch like him. I saw him and heard him speak; he\u2019s maybe a Highlander, but schooled in the south, I\u2019d say\u2014an educated man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd did this Mr. MacKenzie seem to know my daughter?\u201d he asked. Lizzie nodded, frowning in concentration.</p><p>\u201cOh, aye, sir! And she kent him, too\u2014she was afraid of him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfraid? Why?\u201d He spoke sharply, and she blanched, but she was well started now, and the words came out, tripping and stumbling, but still coming.</p><p>\u201cI dinna ken, sir. But she turned white when she saw him, sir, and let out a wee skelloch. Then she went red and white and red again\u2014oh, she was fair upset, anyone could see it!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did he do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy\u2014why\u2014nothing, then. He came close to her, and held her by the arms, and said to her that she must come awa\u2019 with him. Everyone in the taproom was looking. She pulled herself away, white as my shift, but she said to me as it was all right, I was to wait, and she would come back. And\u2014and then she went out with him.\u201d</p><p>Lizzie drew in a quick breath and wiped the end of her nose, which had begun to drip.</p><p>\u201cAnd ye let her go?\u201d</p><p>The little bondmaid shrank back, cowering.</p><p>\u201cOoh, I should have gone after her, I ken weel I should, sir!\u201d she cried, face twisted with misery. \u201cBut I was afraid, sir, and may God forgive me!\u201d</p><p>With an effort, Jamie smoothed the frown from his face and spoke as patiently as he might.</p><p>\u201cAye, well. And what happened, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I went upstairs as she told me, and I lay in the bed, sir, prayin\u2019 for all I was worth!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that was verra helpful, I\u2019m sure!\u201d</p><p>\u201cUncle\u2014\u201d Ian\u2019s voice was soft but not at all tentative, and his brown eyes were steady on Jamie\u2019s. \u201cShe\u2019s no but a wee lassie, Uncle; she did her best.\u201d</p><p>Jamie rubbed his hand hard over his scalp.</p><p>\u201cAye,\u201d he said. \u201cAye, I\u2019m sorry, lass; I didna mean to bite your head off. But will ye no get on wi\u2019 it?\u201d</p><p>A hot pink spot had begun to burn on each of Lizzie\u2019s cheeks.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2014she didna come back till nearly dawn. And\u2014and\u2014\u201d</p><p>Jamie had very little patience left, and no doubt it showed on his face.</p><p>\u201cI could smell him on her,\u201d she whispered, voice dropping almost to inaudibility. \u201cHis...seed.\u201d</p><p>The surge of rage took him unaware, like a white-hot bolt of lightning through chest and belly. He felt half choked with it, but clamped it down tight, hoarding it like coals in a hearth.</p><p>\u201cHe bedded her, then; you\u2019re sure of that?\u201d</p><p>Thoroughly mortified at this bluntness, the little bondmaid could do no more than nod.</p><p>Lizzie was twisting her hands in the stuff of her gown, leaving her skirt all bunched and crumpled. Her paleness was replaced with a hot flush; she looked like one of Claire\u2019s tomatoes. She couldn\u2019t look at him, but hung her head, staring at the ground.</p><p>\u201cOh, sir. She\u2019s wi\u2019 child, can ye not see? It must be him\u2014she was virgin when he took her. He\u2019s come after her\u2014and she\u2019s afraid of him.\u201d</p><p>Quite suddenly, he could see it, and felt the hairs rise all up his arms and shoulders. The autumn breeze struck cold through shirt and skin, and the rage turned to sickness. All the small things he had half seen and half thought, not allowing them to rise to the surface of his mind, came together at once in a logical pattern.</p><p>The look of her, and the way she acted; one moment lively and another lost in troubled thought. And the glow in her face that was not all from the sun. He knew the look of a woman breeding well enough; if he had known her before, he would have seen the change; but as it was...</p><p>Claire. Claire knew. The thought came to him, cold in its certainty. She knew her daughter, and she was a physician. She must know\u2014and hadn\u2019t told him.</p><p>\u201cAre ye sure of this?\u201d The coldness froze his rage. He could feel it stuck in his chest\u2014a dangerous, jagged object that seemed to point in every direction.</p><p>Lizzie nodded, wordless, and blushed deeper, if such a thing were possible.</p><p>\u201cI am her maid, sir,\u201d she whispered, eyes on the ground.</p><p>\u201cShe means Brianna hasna had her courses in two months,\u201d Ian provided matter-of-factly. The youngest of a family containing several older sisters, he was not constrained by Lizzie\u2019s delicacy. \u201cShe\u2019s sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014I wouldna have said anything at all, sir,\u201d the girl went on wretchedly. \u201cOnly, when I saw the man...\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cD\u2019ye think he\u2019s come to claim her, Uncle?\u201d Ian interrupted. \u201cWe must stop him, aye?\u201d The look of angry excitement was clear now, flushing the lad\u2019s lean cheeks with feeling.</p><p>Jamie took a deep breath, only then realizing that he had been holding it.</p><p>\u201cI dinna ken,\u201d he said, surprised at the calmness of his own tone. He had barely had time to take in the news, let alone to draw conclusions, but the lad was right, there was a danger to be dealt with.</p><p>If this MacKenzie wished it, he might claim Brianna as his wife by right of common law, with the coming bairn as evidence of his claim. A court of law would not necessarily force a woman to wed a rapist, but any magistrate would uphold the right of a man to his wife and child\u2014regardless of the wife\u2019s feelings in the matter.</p> <p>His own parents had wed by such device: fleeing and hiding among the Highland crags until his mother was well with child, so that her brothers were forced to accept the unwelcome marriage. A child was a permanent, undeniable bond between man and woman, and he had cause to know it.</p><p>He glanced toward the path that came up through the lower wood.</p><p>\u201cWill he not be here on your heels? The Woolams will have told him the way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNooo,\u201d said Ian thoughtfully. \u201cI shouldna think so. We took his horse, aye?\u201d He grinned suddenly at Lizzie, who giggled faintly in reply.</p><p>\u201cAye? And what\u2019s to stop him taking the wagon, or one of the wagon mules?\u201d</p> <p>The grin widened substantially on Ian\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cI left Rollo in the wagon bed,\u201d he said. \u201cI think he\u2019ll walk it, Uncle Jamie.\u201d</p><p>Jamie was forced to a grudging smile in return.</p><p>\u201cThat was quick of ye, Ian.\u201d</p><p>Ian shrugged modestly.</p><p>\u201cWell, I didna want the bastard to take us unawares. And though I\u2019ve not heard Cousin Brianna talk about her laddie lately\u2014yon Wakefield, aye?\u201d He paused delicately. \u201cI didna think she\u2019d want to see this MacKenzie. Especially if\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI should say Mr. Wakefield has left his coming ower-long,\u201d Jamie said. \u201cEspecially if.\u201d It was no wonder she had stopped looking forward to Wakefield\u2019s coming\u2014once she\u2019d realized. After all, how would a woman explain a swelling belly to a man who\u2019d left her virgin?</p><p>He slowly and consciously unclenched his fists. There would be time enough for all that later. For the moment, there was the one thing to be dealt with.</p><p>\u201cFetch my pistols from the house,\u201d he said, turning to Ian. \u201cAnd you, lassie\u2014\u201d He gave Lizzie something intended for a smile, and reached for the coat he\u2019d hung on the edge of the woodpile.</p><p>\u201cBide ye here, and wait for your mistress. Tell my wife\u2014tell her I\u2019ve gone to give Fergus a hand with his chimney. And dinna speak a word about this to my wife or daughter\u2014or I\u2019ll have your guts for garters.\u201d This last threat was spoken half in jest, but the girl went white as though he\u2019d meant it literally.</p><p>Lizzie sank down on the chopping block, her knees wabbling beneath her. She fumbled for the tiny medallion at her neck, seeking reassurance from the cold metal. She watched Mr. Fraser stride down the path, menacing as a great red wolf. His shadow stretched out black before him, and the late autumn sun touched him with fire.</p><p>The medal in her hand was cold as ice.</p><p>\u201cO dear Mother,\u201d she murmured, over and over. \u201cO Blessed Mother, what have I done?\u201d</p><p>45</p> <p>FIFTY-FIFTY</p><p>The oak leaves were dry and crackling underfoot. There was a constant fall of leaves from the chestnut trees that towered overhead, a slow yellow rain that mocked the dryness of the ground.</p><p>\u201cIs it true that Indians can move through the woods without making a sound, or is that just something they tell you in Girl Scouts?\u201d Brianna kicked at a small drift of oak leaves, sending them flying. Dressed in wide skirts and petticoats that caught at leaves and twigs, we sounded like a herd of elephants ourselves.</p><p>\u201cWell, they can\u2019t do it in dry weather like this, unless they swing through the trees like chimpanzees. In a wet spring, it\u2019s another story\u2014even I could walk through here quietly then; the ground is like a sponge.\u201d</p><p>I drew in my skirts to keep them away from a big elderberry bush, and stooped to look at the fruit. It was dark red, but not yet showing the blackish tinge of true ripeness.</p><p>\u201cTwo more days,\u201d I said. \u201cIf we were going to use them for medicine, we\u2019d pick them now. I want them for wine, though, and to dry like raisins\u2014and for that, you want them to have a lot of sugar, so you wait until they\u2019re nearly ready to drop from their stems.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. What landmark is it?\u201d Brianna glanced around, and smiled. \u201cNo, don\u2019t tell me\u2014it\u2019s that big rock that looks like an Easter Island head.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery good,\u201d I said approvingly. \u201cRight, because it won\u2019t change with the seasons.\u201d</p><p>Reaching the edge of a small stream, we separated, working our way slowly down the banks. I had set Brianna to collect cress, while I poked about the trees in search of wood ears and other edible fungi.</p><p>I watched her covertly as I hunted, one eye on the ground, one on her. She was knee-deep in the stream with her skirts kilted up, showing an amazing stretch of long, muscular thigh as she waded slowly, eyes on the rippling water.</p><p>There was something wrong; had been for days. At first I had assumed her air of tension was due to the obvious stresses of the new situation in which she found herself. But over the past weeks she and Jamie had settled into a relationship that, while still marked by shyness on both sides, was increasingly warm. They delighted each other\u2014and I was delighted to see them together.</p><p>Still, there was something troubling her. It had been three years since I had left her\u2014four since she had left me, to live on her own, and she had changed; had grown entirely into a woman now. I could no longer read her as easily as I once had. She had Jamie\u2019s trick of hiding strong feeling behind a mask of calmness\u2014I knew it well in both of them.</p><p>In part, I had arranged this foraging expedition as an excuse to talk to her alone; with Jamie, Ian, and Lizzie in the house, and the constant traffic of tenants and visitors come to see Jamie, private conversation there was impossible. And if what I suspected was true, this wasn\u2019t a conversation I wished to have where anyone could hear.</p><p>By the time I had my basket half filled with thick, fleshy orange wood ears, Brianna had emerged dripping from the stream, her own basket overflowing with clumps of wet green cress and bunches of jointed horsetail reeds to make into tapers.</p><p>She wiped her feet on the hem of her petticoat, and came to join me under one of the huge chestnut trees. I handed her the canteen of cider, and waited till she had had a drink.</p><p>\u201cIs it Roger?\u201d I said then, without preliminary.</p><p>She glanced at me, a flash of startlement visible in her eyes, and then I saw the tense line of her shoulder ease.</p><p>\u201cI wondered whether you could still do that,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cDo what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRead my mind. I sort of hoped you could.\u201d Her wide mouth quirked awkwardly, trying to smile.</p><p>\u201cI expect I\u2019m a bit out of practice,\u201d I said. \u201cBut give me a moment.\u201d I reached up and smoothed the hair off her face. She looked at me, but beyond me, too shy to meet my eyes. A whippoorwill called in the far green shadows.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right, baby,\u201d I said quietly. \u201cHow far gone are you?\u201d</p><p>The breath left her in a huge sigh. Her face went slack with relief.</p><p>\u201cTwo months.\u201d</p><p>Now she met my eyes, and I felt a small shock of difference, the kind I had been getting since her arrival. Once, her relief would have been a child\u2019s; a fear confided, and half eased already by the knowledge that I would somehow deal with it. But now it was only the relief of sharing an unbearable secret; she was not expecting me to remedy things. The knowledge that I couldn\u2019t do anything in any case didn\u2019t stop my irrational feeling of loss.</p><p>She squeezed my hand, as though reassuring me, and then sat down with her back against a tree trunk, stretching out her legs in front of her, long feet bare.</p><p>\u201cDid you know already?\u201d</p><p>I sat down next to her, less gracefully.</p><p>\u201cI expect so; but I didn\u2019t know I knew, if that makes sense.\u201d Looking at her now, it was plain to see; the faint pallor of her skin and tiny alterations in her color, the fleeting look of inwardness. I had noticed, but had put the changes down to unfamiliarity and strain\u2014to the flurry of emotions over finding me, meeting Jamie, to worry over Lizzie\u2019s sickness, worry over Roger.</p><p>That particular worry now took on a sudden new dimension.</p><p>\u201cOh, Jesus. Roger!\u201d</p><p>She nodded, pale in the filtered yellow shade of the chestnut leaves overhead. She looked jaundiced, and no wonder.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been nearly two months. He should have been here\u2014unless something happened.\u201d</p><p>My mind was busy calculating.</p><p>\u201cTwo months, and now it\u2019s nearly November.\u201d The leaves under us lay thick and soft, yellow and brown, fresh-fallen from the hickory and chestnut trees. My heart dropped suddenly in my chest. \u201cBree\u2014you\u2019ve got to go back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Her head jerked up. \u201cGo back where?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo the stones.\u201d I waved a hand in agitation. \u201cTo Scotland, and right away!\u201d</p><p>She stared at me, thick brows drawn down.</p><p>\u201cNow? What for?\u201d</p><p>I took a deep breath, feeling a dozen different emotions collide. Concern for Bree, fear for Roger, a terrible sorrow for Jamie, who would have to give her up again, so soon. And for myself.</p><p>\u201cYou can go through, pregnant. We know that much, because I did it, with you. But honey\u2014you can\u2019t take a baby through that...that...you can\u2019t,\u201d I ended, helpless. \u201cYou know what it\u2019s like.\u201d It had been three years since I came through the stones, but I recalled the experience vividly.</p><p>Her eyes went black as the little blood remaining in her face drained away.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t take a child through,\u201d I repeated, trying to get myself under control, think logically. \u201cIt would be like jumping off Niagara Falls with the baby in your arms. You\u2019ll have to go back before it\u2019s born, or\u2014\u201d I broke off, making calculations.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s almost November. Ships won\u2019t make the passage between late November and March. And you can\u2019t wait till March\u2014that would mean making a two-month trip across the Atlantic, six or seven months pregnant. If you didn\u2019t deliver on the ship\u2014which would likely kill you or the baby or both\u2014you\u2019d still have to ride thirty miles to the circle, and then make the passage, find your way to help on the other side...Brianna, you can\u2019t do it! You have to go now, as soon as we can manage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd if I do go now\u2014how will I make sure I end up in the right time?\u201d</p><p>She spoke quietly, but her fingers were pleating the fabric of her skirt.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2014I think\u2014well, I did,\u201d I said, my initial panic beginning to subside into rational thought.</p><p>\u201cYou had Daddy at the other end.\u201d She glanced up at me sharply. \u201cWhether you wanted to go to him or not, you had strong feelings for him\u2014he would have pulled you. Or me. But he isn\u2019t there anymore.\u201d Her face tightened, then relaxed. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cRoger knew\u2014knows\u2014how,\u201d she corrected herself. \u201cGeillis Duncan\u2019s book said you could use gems to travel\u2014for protection and navigation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you and Roger are both only guessing!\u201d I argued. \u201cAnd so was bloody Geilie Duncan! You might not need either gemstones or a strong attachment. In the old fairy tales, when people go inside a fairy\u2019s dun and then return, it\u2019s always two hundred years. If that\u2019s the usual pattern, then\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you risk finding out it\u2019s not? And it\u2019s not\u2014Geilie Duncan went far-ther than two hundred years.\u201d</p><p>It occurred to me, a little belatedly, that she had thought all this out herself. Nothing I was saying came as any surprise. And that meant she had also reached her own conclusion\u2014which did not involve taking ship back to Scotland.</p> <p>I rubbed a hand between my brows, making an effort to match her calmness. The mention of Geillis had called to mind another memory\u2014though one I had tried to forget.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s another way,\u201d I said, fighting for calm. \u201cAnother passage, I mean. It\u2019s on Haiti\u2014they call it Hispaniola now. In the jungle, there are standing stones on a hill, but the crack, the passage, is underneath, in a cave.\u201d</p><p>The forest air was cool, but it wasn\u2019t the shadows that made my skin ripple into gooseflesh. I rubbed my forearms, trying to erase the chill. I would willingly have erased all memory of the cave of Abandawe as well\u2014I\u2019d tried\u2014but it wasn\u2019t a place easily forgotten.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been there?\u201d She leaned forward, intent.</p><p>\u201cYes. It\u2019s a horrible place. But the Indies are a good deal closer than Scotland is, and ships sail between Charleston and Jamaica nearly all year.\u201d I took a deep breath, feeling a little better. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be easy to go through the jungle\u2014but it would give you a little longer\u2014long enough for us to find Roger.\u201d If he could still be found, I thought, but didn\u2019t say so. That particular fear could be dealt with later.</p> <p>One of the chestnut leaves spiraled down onto Brianna\u2019s lap, vivid yellow against the soft brown homespun, and she picked it off, smoothing the waxy surface absently with her thumb. She looked at me, blue eyes intent.</p><p>\u201cDoes this place work like the other one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know how any of them work! It sounded different, a bell sound instead of a buzzing noise. But it was a passage, all right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been there,\u201d she said slowly, looking at me under her brows.</p><p>\u201cWhy? Did you want to go back? After you\u2019d found\u2014him?\u201d There was still a slight hesitation in her voice; she couldn\u2019t quite bring herself to refer to Jamie as \u201cmy father.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. It was to do with Geillis Duncan. She found it.\u201d</p> <p>Brianna\u2019s eyes sprang wide.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. She\u2019s dead.\u201d</p><p>I took a deep breath, feeling the remembered shock and tingle of an ax blow run up my arm. Sometimes I thought of her, of Geillis, when I was alone in the forest. Sometimes I thought I heard her voice behind me, and turned around swiftly, but saw no more than the hemlock branches, soughing in the wind. But now and then I felt her eyes on me, green and bright as the springtime wood.</p><p>\u201cQuite dead,\u201d I said firmly, and changed the subject. \u201cHow did this happen, anyway?\u201d</p><p>There wasn\u2019t any pretence of not knowing what I was talking about. She gave me a straight look, one eyebrow raised.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the doctor. How many ways are there?\u201d</p><p>I gave her back the look, with interest.</p> <p>\u201cDidn\u2019t you even think of taking any precautions?\u201d</p><p>She glowered, thick brows drawn down.</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t planning to have sex here!\u201d</p><p>I clutched my head, digging my fingers into my scalp in exasperation.</p><p>\u201cYou think people plan it? Good God, how many times did I come to that school of yours and give talks about\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll the time! Every year! My mother the sex encyclopedia! Do you have any idea how mortifying it is to have your own mother standing up in front of everybody, drawing pictures of penises?\u201d</p><p>Her face went the color of the scarlet maples, flushed with the memory.</p><p>\u201cI must not have done it all that well,\u201d I said tartly, \u201csince you seem not to have recognized one when you saw it.\u201d</p><p>Her face jerked toward me, blood in her eye, but then relaxed when she saw that I was joking\u2014or trying to.</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d she said. \u201cWell, they look different in 3-D.\u201d</p><p>Taken unawares, I laughed. After a moment\u2019s hesitation, she joined me, a hesitant giggle.</p><p>\u201cYou know what I mean. I gave you that prescription before I left.\u201d</p><p>She looked down her long, straight nose at me.</p><p>\u201cYes, and I was never so shocked in my life! You thought I\u2019d run right out and have sex with everybody in sight the minute you left?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re implying that it was only my presence stopping you?\u201d The corner of her wide mouth twitched.</p><p>\u201cWell, not only that,\u201d she conceded. \u201cBut you had something to do with it, you and Daddy. I mean, I\u2014I wouldn\u2019t have wanted to disappoint you.\u201d The twitch had turned to a quiver in an instant, and I hugged her hard, her smooth bright hair against my cheek.</p><p>\u201cYou couldn\u2019t, baby,\u201d I murmured, rocking her slightly. \u201cWe\u2019d never be disappointed in you, never.\u201d</p><p>I felt both tension and worry ebb as I held her. Finally, she took a deep breath and let go of me.</p><p>\u201cMaybe not you or Daddy,\u201d she said. \u201cBut what about\u2014?\u201d She tilted her head toward the now invisible house.</p><p>\u201cHe won\u2019t\u2014\u201d I began, but then stopped. The truth was that I didn\u2019t know what Jamie would do. On the one hand, he was strongly inclined to think that Brianna hung the moon. On the other hand, he had opinions regarding sexual honor that could only be described\u2014for obvious reasons\u2014as old-fashioned, and no inhibitions at all about expressing them.</p><p>He was worldly, well educated, tolerant, and compassionate. This did not in any way, shape, or form mean that he shared or understood modern sensibilities; I knew quite well he didn\u2019t. And I couldn\u2019t think that his attitude toward Roger would be tolerant in the slightest.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d I said dubiously, \u201cI shouldn\u2019t wonder if he didn\u2019t want to punch Roger in the nose or something. But don\u2019t worry,\u201d I added, seeing her look of alarm. \u201cHe loves you,\u201d I said, and smoothed the tumbled hair off her flushed face. \u201cHe won\u2019t stop.\u201d</p><p>I got up, brushing yellow leaves from my skirt.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll have a bit of time, then, but none to waste. Jamie can send word downriver, to keep an eye out for Roger. Speaking of Roger...\u201d I hesitated, picking a bit of dried fern from my sleeve. \u201cI don\u2019t suppose he knows about this, does he?\u201d</p><p>Brianna took a deep breath, and her fist closed tight on the leaf in her hand, crushing it.</p><p>\u201cWell, see, there\u2019s a problem about that,\u201d she said. She looked up at me, and suddenly she was my little girl again. \u201cIt isn\u2019t Roger\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I said stupidly.</p><p>\u201cIt. Isn\u2019t. Roger\u2019s. Baby,\u201d she said, between clenched teeth.</p><p>I sank down beside her once more. Her worry over Roger suddenly took on new dimensions.</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d I said. \u201cHere, or there?\u201d Even as I spoke, I was calculating\u2014it had to be someone here, in the past. If it had been a man in her own time, she\u2019d be farther along than two months. Not only in the past, then, but here, in the Colonies.</p><p>I wasn\u2019t planning to have sex, she\u2019d said. No, of course not. She hadn\u2019t told Roger, for fear he would follow her\u2014he was her anchor, her key to the future. But in that case\u2014</p><p>\u201cHere,\u201d she said, confirming my calculations. She dug in the pocket of her skirt, and came out with something. She reached toward me, and I held out my hand automatically.</p><p>\u201cJesus H. Roosevelt Christ.\u201d The worn gold wedding band sparked in the sun, and my hand closed reflexively over it. It was warm from being carried next to her skin, but I felt a deep coldness seep into my fingers.</p><p>\u201cBonnet?\u201d I said. \u201cStephen Bonnet?\u201d</p><p>Her throat moved convulsively, and she swallowed, head jerking in a brief nod.</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t going to tell you\u2014I couldn\u2019t; not after Ian told me about what happened on the river. At first I didn\u2019t know what Da would do; I was afraid he\u2019d blame me. And then when I knew him a little better\u2014I knew he\u2019d try to find Bonnet\u2014that\u2019s what Daddy would have done. I couldn\u2019t let him do that. You met that man, you know what he\u2019s like.\u201d She was sitting in the sun, but a shudder passed over her, and she rubbed her arms as though she was cold.</p><p>\u201cI do,\u201d I said. My lips were stiff. Her words were ringing in my ears.</p><p>I wasn\u2019t planning to have sex. I couldn\u2019t tell...I was afraid he\u2019d blame me.</p><p>\u201cWhat did he do to you?\u201d I asked, and was surprised that my voice sounded calm. \u201cDid he hurt you, baby?\u201d</p><p>She grimaced, and pulled her knees up to her chest, hugging them against herself.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t call me that, okay? Not right now.\u201d</p><p>I reached to touch her, but she huddled closer into herself, and I dropped my hand.</p><p>\u201cDo you want to tell me?\u201d I didn\u2019t want to know; I wanted to pretend it hadn\u2019t happened, too.</p><p>She looked up at me, lips tightened to a straight white line.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t want to. But I think I\u2019d better.\u201d</p><p>She had stepped aboard the Gloriana in broad daylight, cautious, but feeling safe by reason of the number of people around; loaders, seamen, merchants, servants\u2014the docks bustled with life. She had told a seaman on the deck what she wanted; he had vanished into the recesses of the ship, and a moment later, Stephen Bonnet had appeared.</p><p>He had on the same clothes as the night before; in the daylight, she could see that they were of fine quality, but stained and badly crumpled. Greasy candle wax had dripped on the silk cuff of his coat, and his jabot had crumbs in it.</p><p>Bonnet himself showed fewer marks of wear than did his clothes; he was fresh-shaven, and his green eyes were pale and alert. They passed over her quickly, lighting with interest.</p><p>\u201cI did think ye comely last night by candlelight,\u201d he said, taking her hand and raising it to his lips. \u201cBut a-many seem so when the drink is flowin\u2019. It\u2019s a good deal more rare to find a woman fairer in the sun than she is by the moon.\u201d</p><p>Brianna tried to extract her hand from his grasp, giving him a polite smile.</p><p>\u201cThank you. Do you still have the ring?\u201d Her heart beat fast in her throat. He could still tell her about the ring\u2014about her mother\u2014even if he had lost it gambling. But she wanted very badly to have it in her hands. She suppressed the fear that had haunted her all night; that the ring might be all that was left of her mother. It couldn\u2019t be, not if the newspaper clipping was right, but\u2014</p><p>\u201cOh, indeed. The luck of Danu herself was with me the night\u2014and still is, by the looks of it.\u201d He gave her a charming smile, still keeping hold of her hand. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2014ah, I wondered if you would sell it to me.\u201d She had brought nearly all the money she had with her, but had no idea what the cost of a gold ring might be.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d The blunt question took her unawares, and she fumbled for an answer.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2014it looks like one my mother had,\u201d she answered, unable to invent an answer better than the truth. \u201cWhere did you get it?\u201d</p><p>Something moved behind his eyes, though he still smiled at her. He gestured toward the dark companionway, and tucked her hand in the crook of his elbow. He was taller than she, a big man. She pulled, cautiously, but he held her hand fast.</p> <p>\u201cSo ye want the ring? Come down to my cabin, my dear, and we shall see if an accommodation might be reached.\u201d</p><p>Below, he poured her brandy; she took the barest sip, but he drank deeply, draining one glass and pouring another.</p><p>\u201cWhere?\u201d he said carelessly, in answer to her persistent questions. \u201cAh\u2014well, a gentlemen should not be tellin\u2019 tales of his ladies, should he?\u201d He winked at her. \u201cA love token,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>The smile on her own face felt stiff, and the sip of brandy she had taken burned in her stomach.</p><p>\u201cThe lady who\u2014gave it to you,\u201d she said. \u201cIs she in good health?\u201d</p> <p>He gaped at her, lower jaw fallen slightly open.</p><p>\u201cLuck,\u201d she said hastily. \u201cIt\u2019s bad luck to wear jewelry that belongs to someone who\u2019s\u2014who\u2019s dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it?\u201d The smile returned. \u201cI cannot say I have noticed that effect myself.\u201d He set down the glass and gave a slight, pleasurable belch.</p><p>\u201cStill, I can assure ye, the lady from whom I had that ring was both alive and well when I left her.\u201d</p><p>The burning sensation in her stomach eased slightly.</p><p>\u201cOh. I\u2019m glad to hear that. Will you sell it to me, then?\u201d</p> <p>He rocked back in his chair, eyeing her, a small smile on his lips.</p><p>\u201cSell it. And what will ye offer me, sweetheart?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFifteen pounds sterling.\u201d Her heart began to beat faster again, as he stood up. He was going to agree! Where did he keep it?</p><p>He stood up, took her hand, and pulled her up out of her chair.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve enough money, sweetheart,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat color\u2019s the hair between your legs?\u201d</p><p>She jerked her hand out of his grasp, and backed up as quickly as she could, slamming into the wall of the cabin within a few steps.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve mistaken me,\u201d she said. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe not,\u201d he said, and the edges of his teeth showed in his smile. \u201cBut I do. And I do think perhaps you\u2019ve mistaken me, sweetheart.\u201d</p> <p>He took a step toward her. She snatched the brandy bottle from the table, and swung it at his head. He ducked adroitly, plucked the bottle from her hand, and slapped her hard across the face.</p><p>She staggered, half blinded by the sudden pain. He grasped her by the shoulders, and forced her to her knees. His fingers twisted tight in her hair, close to the scalp, and jerked her head, hard. He held her, head canted at an awkward angle, while he fumbled with the other hand at the front of his breeches. He grunted slightly with satisfaction and took a half step closer, thrusting his h*ps forward.</p><p>\u201cMeet Leroi,\u201d he said.</p><p>Leroi was both uncircumcised and unwashed, and gave off a powerful smell of stale urine. She felt a bolus of vomit rise in her throat, and tried to turn her head away. The answer to that was a vicious yank on her hair that brought her back, stifling a cry of pain.</p><p>\u201cPut out that little pink tongue and give us a kiss, sweetheart.\u201d Bonnet sounded cheerful and unconcerned, his grip on her hair tight as ever. She lifted her hands toward him in unspoken protest; he saw it and tightened his grip, making tears start in her eyes. She put out her tongue.</p><p>\u201cNot bad, not bad,\u201d he said, judiciously. \u201cAll right, open your mouth.\u201d He let go of her hair quite suddenly and her head snapped back. Before she could jerk away, he had seized her by one ear, twisting slightly.</p><p>\u201cBite me, sweetheart, and I\u2019ll mash your nose flat. Eh?\u201d He brushed his closed fist lightly under her nose, nudging the tip with a massive knuckle. Then he took a firm grip on her other ear, holding her head immobile between his big hands.</p><p>She concentrated on the taste of the blood from her cut lip, the taste and the pain of it. With her eyes closed, she could see the taste, salt and metal, a burnished copper, shining pure in the dark inside her eyes.</p><p>If she vomited, she would choke. She would choke, and he would not notice. She would strangle and die, and he wouldn\u2019t stop. She put her hands on his thighs to brace herself, and dug her fingers into the heavy muscle, pushing back as hard as she could, to resist the battering. He was humming, deep in his throat. From Ushant to Scilly is thirty-five leagues. Wiry hairs brushed her lips.</p><p>Then Leroi was gone. He let go of her ears and stepped back; unbalanced, she fell forward on hands and knees, gagging and coughing, the strings of saliva from her mouth tinged pink with blood. She coughed and spat, and spat again, trying to clear her mouth of foulness. Her lips were swollen, and throbbing with her heartbeat.</p><p>He lifted her effortlessly, hands under her arms, and kissed her, tongue thrusting, one palm cupping the back of her head to keep her from pulling away. He tasted overpoweringly of brandy, with a faint nastiness of decaying teeth. The other hand, at her waist, roamed slowly downward, kneading her buttocks.</p><p>\u201cMmm,\u201d he said, sighing pleasurably. \u201cBedtime, eh, sweetheart?\u201d</p><p>She lowered her head and butted him in the face. Her forehead struck hard against bone, and he uttered a sharp cry of surprise and loosened his grip. She wrenched free and ran. Her flying skirt caught on the doorlatch and tore, disregarded as she hurled herself out into the dark companionway.</p><p>The sailors were at supper; twenty men sat at a long table in the mess at the end of the companionway, twenty faces turned toward her in expressions ranging from startlement to lascivious interest. It was the cook who tripped her, sticking out a foot as she dashed past the galley. Her knees hit the deck with numbing force.</p><p>\u201cLike games, do you, sweetheart?\u201d It was Bonnet\u2019s voice in her ear, jovial as ever, as a pair of hands scooped her up with disconcerting ease. He whirled her to face him, and smiled. She had hit him in the nose; a thick trickle of blood flowed down from one nostril. It ran over his upper lip, and followed the grooves of his smile, thin lines of red showing between his teeth, and dark drops dripping slowly from his chin.</p><p>His grip on her arms tightened, but the merry glint shone as ever in his light green eyes.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s all right, sweetheart,\u201d he said. \u201cLeroi likes games. Don\u2019t you, Leroi?\u201d He glanced down, and she followed his gaze. He had shed his breeches in the cabin, and stood half nak*d, Leroi brushing against her skirts, quivering with eagerness.</p><p>He took her by one elbow, and bowing gallantly, gestured toward the cabin. Numbly, she stepped forward, and he took his place beside her, arm in arm, nonchalantly exposing the white cheeks of his buttocks to the stares of his gaping crew.</p><p>\u201cAfter that...it wasn\u2019t so bad.\u201d She could hear her own voice, unnaturally calm, as though it belonged to someone else. \u201cI didn\u2019t\u2014didn\u2019t fight him anymore.\u201d</p><p>He hadn\u2019t bothered to make her undress, merely untucked her kerchief. Her dress was made in the usual fashion, with a low, square neckline, and her br**sts were high and round; it took no more than a casual downward yank to bare them, popping them up over the edge of the bodice like a pair of apples.</p><p>He mauled them idly for a moment, pinching her n**ples between a large thumb and forefinger to make them stand up, then pushed her toward his tumbled bed.</p><p>The sheets were stained with spilled liquor and stank of perfume and wine, and overwhelmingly of the rank, heavy odor of Bonnet himself. He shoved up her skirt and arranged her legs to suit him, humming all the while beneath his breath. Farewell to you all, ye fine Spanish ladies...</p><p>In her mind\u2019s eye, she could see herself thrusting him away, flinging herself off the bed and running for the door, skimming light as a gull down the dark companionway and bursting up through the grated deck to freedom. She could feel the wooden boards under her bare feet, and the glare of the hot summer sun in her dark-blind eyes. Almost. She lay in the dim cabin, wooden as a figurehead, tasting blood in her mouth.</p><p>There was a blind, insistent prodding between her thighs and she convulsed in panic, scissoring her legs. Still humming, he thrust a muscular leg between her own, brutally nudging her thighs apart. Naked from the waist downward, he still wore his shirt and stock. The long tails drooped around Leroi\u2019s pale stalk as he rose up on his knees above her.</p><p>He stopped humming long enough to spit copiously into his palm. Rubbing roughly and thoroughly, he eased the path and then set to business. With one hand clutched firmly on her breast, he guided himself with the other to an inescapable berth, making a jovial remark about the snugness of the accommodation, and then loosed Leroi on his mindless\u2014and mercifully brief\u2014gallop to pleasure.</p><p>Two minutes, maybe three. And then it was over, and Bonnet lay heavily collapsed upon her, sweat crumpling his linen stock, one hand still crushing her breast. His lank fair hair fell soft against her cheek and his exhalations purled hot and damp on her neck. At least he\u2019d stopped humming.</p><p>She lay frozen for endless long minutes, staring up at the ceiling, where the reflections from the water danced across the polished beams. He sighed at last, and rolled slowly off her onto his side. He smiled at her, dreamily scratching one bared and hairy hip.</p><p>\u201cNot bad, sweetheart, though I\u2019ve had livelier rides. Move your arse more next time, hm?\u201d He sat up, yawned, and began to straighten his attire. She edged toward the side of the bed, then, sure that he didn\u2019t mean to restrain her, rolled abruptly off and onto her feet. She felt light-headed and desperately short of air, as though his bulk still pressed upon her.</p><p>Moving in a daze, she went to the door. It was bolted. As she struggled to lift the bolt, her hands shaking, she heard him say something behind her, and swung around in amazement.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI said the ring\u2019s on the desk,\u201d he said, straightening up from retrieving his stockings. He sat down on the bed and began to pull them on, waving casually at the desk that stood against the wall. \u201cThere\u2019s money, too. Take what you want.\u201d</p><p>The top of the desk was a magpie\u2019s nest, littered with inkpots, trinkets, bits of jewelry, bills of lading, tattered quills, silver buttons, ragged bits of paper and crumpled clothing, and a scatter of coins in silver and bronze, copper and gold, currency of several colonies, several countries.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re offering me money?\u201d</p><p>He looked up quizzically, fair brows arched.</p><p>\u201cI pay for my pleasures,\u201d he said. \u201cDid you think I wouldn\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>Everything in the cabin seemed unnaturally vivid, detailed and individual as the objects in a dream, which would vanish with waking.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t think anything,\u201d she said, her voice sounding very clear, but distant, someone speaking from far away. Her kerchief lay on the floor where he had thrown it, by the desk. She walked there, carefully, trying not to think of the warm slipperiness that streaked down her thighs. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m an honest man\u2014for a pirate,\u201d he said behind her, and laughed. He stamped once on the deck to settle his foot in its shoe, then brushed past her and lifted the bolt easily with one hand.</p><p>\u201cHelp yourself, sweetheart,\u201d he said, with another casual wave toward the desk as he went out. \u201cYou were worth it.\u201d</p><p>She heard his footsteps going away down the companionway, a burst of laughter and a muffled remark as he met someone, then a shift of his voice, suddenly clear and harsh, shouting orders to someone above, and the tramp and scurry of feet overhead, rushing to obey. Back to business.</p><p>It was sitting in a bowl made of cowhorn, jumbled with a collection of bone buttons, string, and other bits of rubbish. Like him, she thought, with a cold clarity. Acquisition for its own sake; a reckless and savage delight in the taking, with no knowledge at all of the value of what he stole.</p> <p>Her hand was shaking; she saw it with a vague sense of surprise. She tried to grasp the ring, failed, gave up. She scooped up the bowl and emptied its contents into her pocket. She walked down the dark companionway, her fist wrapped tight around the pocket, holding it like a talisman. There were seamen all around, too busy about their tasks to spare her more than a glance of lewd speculation. Her shoes were perched on the end of the mess table, bows perky in a shaft of light from the grating overhead.</p><p>She put them on, and with an even tread walked up the ladder, across the deck and gangplank, onto the dock. Tasting blood.</p><p>\u201cI thought at first I could just pretend it didn\u2019t happen.\u201d She took a deep breath, and looked at me. Her hands folded over her stomach, as though to hide it. \u201cBut I guess that won\u2019t work, will it?\u201d</p><p>I was silent for a moment, thinking. It was no time for delicacy.</p><p>\u201cWhen?\u201d I said. \u201cHow long after...um, after Roger?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTwo days.\u201d</p><p>My eyebrows lifted at that.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you so sure it isn\u2019t Roger\u2019s, then? You weren\u2019t using pills, obviously, and I\u2019ll bet my life Roger didn\u2019t use what passes for condoms in these times.\u201d</p><p>She half smiled at that, and a small flush rose in her cheeks.</p><p>\u201cNo. He...um...he...ah...\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, coitus interruptus?\u201d</p> <p>She nodded.</p><p>I took a deep breath and blew it out through pursed lips.</p><p>\u201cThere is a word,\u201d I said, \u201cfor people who depend on that particular method of birth control.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d she asked, looking wary.</p><p>\u201cParents,\u201d I said.</p><p>46</p><p>COMES A STRANGER</p><p>Roger bent his head and drank from cupped hands. A piece of luck, that flash of green, pointed out by a finger of sunlight stabbing down through the trees. Without it, he would never have seen the spring, so far off the trail as it was.</p> <p>A clear trickle bubbled through a crack in the rock, cooling his hands and face. The rock itself was a smooth blackish green, and the ground all round was boggy, rumpled by tree roots and furred with a moss that grew brilliant as emeralds in the fleeting patch of sun.</p><p>The knowledge that he would see Brianna shortly\u2014perhaps within the hour\u2014soothed his annoyance as effectively as the cool water eased his dry throat. If he\u2019d had to have his horse stolen, it was some consolation that he\u2019d been close enough to reach his destination on foot.</p><p>The horse itself had been an ancient nag, barely worth stealing. At least he\u2019d had the sense to keep his valuables on his person, not in the saddlebags. He clapped a hand against the side seam of his breeches, reassured to feel the small hardness snuggled against his thigh.</p><p>Beyond the horse itself, he hadn\u2019t lost much more than a pistol\u2014nearly as ancient as the horse and not half so reliable\u2014a bit of food, and a leather water flask. The loss of the flask had troubled him for the last few miles of hot, dusty walking, but now that minor inconvenience was remedied.</p><p>His feet sank into the damp ground as he stood up, leaving dark streaks in the emerald moss. He stepped back and wiped the mud from his shoe soles on the carpet of dry leaves and crusted needles. Then he dusted down the skirts of his coat as well as he could, and straightened the grimy stock at his throat. His knuckles rasped the stubble on his jaw; his razor had been in the saddlebag.</p><p>He looked a right villain, he thought ruefully. No way to meet your in-laws. In truth, though, he wasn\u2019t much concerned with what Claire and Jamie Fraser might think of him. His thoughts were all on Brianna.</p><p>She\u2019d found her parents now; he could only hope that the reunion had been so satisfactory that she\u2019d be in a mood to forgive his betrayal. Christ, he\u2019d been stupid!</p><p>He made his way back toward the path, feet sinking in the soft leaf-layer. Stupid in underestimating her stubbornness, stupid not to have been honest with her, he amended. Stupid to have bullied her into secrecy. Trying to keep her safely in the future\u2014no, that hadn\u2019t been stupid at all, he thought, with a grimace at the things he\u2019d seen and heard in the last few months.</p><p>He pushed aside an overhanging limb of loblolly pine, then ducked with an exclamation of alarm, as something black shot past his head.</p><p>A hoarse craawk! announced that his assailant was a raven. Similar cries gave notice of the arrival of reinforcements in the trees nearby, and within seconds, another black missile whizzed past, within inches of his ear.</p><p>\u201cHey, bugger off!\u201d he exclaimed, ducking away from yet another croaking buzz bomb. He was plainly near a nest, and the ravens didn\u2019t like it.</p><p>The first raven sailed back for another try. This pass knocked his hat into the dirt. The mobbing was unnerving, the sense of hostility out of all proportion to the size of his adversaries. Another came in, zooming low, and struck him a glancing blow as its claws ripped at the shoulder of his coat. Roger snatched up his hat and ran.</p><p>A hundred yards up the trail, he slowed to a walk and looked round. The birds were nowhere in sight; he\u2019d passed their nesting place, then.</p><p>\u201cAnd where\u2019s Alfred Hitchcock when you need him?\u201d he muttered to himself, trying to shake off the sense of danger.</p><p>His voice was damped at once by the thick vegetation; it was like talking into a pillow. He was breathing heavily, and his face felt flushed. All at once, it seemed very quiet in the forest. With the ceasing of the ravens\u2019 racket, all the other birds seemed to have stopped as well. It was no wonder the old Scots thought ravens birds of bad omen; spend much longer here, and all the old ways that had been no more than curiosities would be flourishing away in his mind.</p><p>Dangerous, dirty, and uncomfortable as it was, he had to admit the fascination of being here\u2014of experiencing at firsthand things he\u2019d read about, seeing objects he knew as museum artifacts being casually used in daily life. If it wasn\u2019t for Brianna, he might not regret the adventure, in spite of Stephen Bonnet and the things he had seen aboard the Gloriana.</p><p>Once more his hand went to his thigh. He had been luckier than he\u2019d dared hope; Bonnet had had not one gemstone, but two. Would they really work? He ducked again, having to walk half crouched for several steps before the branches opened up again. Hard to believe that people lived up here, save that someone had cut this trail, and it must lead somewhere.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t miss it,\u201d the girl at the mill had assured him, and he could see why. There wasn\u2019t anyplace else to go.</p><p>He shaded his eyes, looking up the trail, but the drooping branches of pine and maple hid everything, presenting only a shadowy, mysterious tunnel through the trees. No telling how far it might be to the top of the ridge.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll make it by sundown, easy,\u201d the girl had told him, and it was late midafternoon now. But that had been when he had a horse. Not wanting to be caught on the mountainside in the dark, he picked up his pace, straining his eyes for sunlight ahead that would show him the openness of the ridge at the end of the trail.</p><p>As he walked, his thoughts ran inevitably ahead of him, quick with speculation.</p><p>And how had it gone, Brianna\u2019s reunion with her parents? What had she thought of Jamie Fraser? Was he the man she\u2019d been imagining for the last year, or only a pale reflection of the image she had built up from her mother\u2019s stories?</p><p>At least she had a father to know, he thought, with a queer little pang at the memory of Midsummer\u2019s Eve, and that burst of light in the passage through the stones.</p><p>There it was! A lightening of the dense green shadow ahead; a brightening as tongues of sun struck autumn leaves in a flare of orange and yellow.</p><p>The sun dazzled him for a moment as he came out of the tunnel of greenery. He blinked once, and found himself not on the ridge, as he had expected, but in a small natural clearing, edged with scarlet maples and yellow scrub oak. It held the sunlight like a cup, dark forest spreading beyond on all sides.</p><p>As he turned about, searching for the continuation of the trail, he heard a horse\u2019s whicker and whirled to find his own elderly mount, jerking its head against the pull of a rein tied to a tree at the edge of the clearing.</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019ll be buggered!\u201d he exclaimed in astonishment. \u201cHow the hell did you get up here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe same way you did,\u201d a voice answered him. A tall young man emerged from the wood beside the horse, and stood pointing a pistol at Roger; his own, he saw, with a sense of outrage as well as apprehension. He took a deep breath and choked down his fear.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got my horse and my gun,\u201d Roger said coolly. \u201cWhat else d\u2019you want? My hat?\u201d He held out the battered tricorne in invitation. The robber couldn\u2019t possibly know what else he carried; he hadn\u2019t shown them to anyone.</p><p>The young man\u2014couldn\u2019t be more than in his teens, in spite of his size, Roger thought\u2014didn\u2019t smile.</p><p>\u201cA bit more than that, I expect.\u201d For the first time, the young man took his eyes off Roger, shifting his glance to one side. Following the direction of his gaze, Roger felt a jolt like an electric shock.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t seen the man at the edge of the clearing, though he must have been there all the time, standing motionless. He wore a faded hunting kilt whose browns and greens blended into the grass and brush, as his flaming hair blended with the brilliant leaves. He looked as if he\u2019d grown out of the forest.</p><p>Beyond the sheer unexpectedness of his appearance, it was his looks that stunned Roger into speechlessness. It was one thing to have been told that Jamie Fraser resembled his daughter. It was another to see Brianna\u2019s bold features transmuted into power by the stamp of years, and fronting a personality not only thoroughly masculine, but fierce in aspect.</p><p>It was like lifting his hand from the fur of a handsome ginger cat, only to find himself staring into the unblinking gaze of a tiger. Roger barely kept himself from taking an involuntary step backward, thinking as he did so that Claire had not exaggerated a single thing in her descriptions of Jamie Fraser.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be Mr. MacKenzie,\u201d the man said. It wasn\u2019t a question. The voice was deep but not loud, barely lifted above the sound of the rustling leaves, but Roger had no difficulty hearing him.</p><p>\u201cI am,\u201d he said, taking a step forward. \u201cAnd you\u2019ll be...ah...Jamie Fraser?\u201d He stretched out a hand, but quickly let it drop. Two pairs of eyes rested coldly on him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI am,\u201d said the red-haired man. \u201cYou\u2019ll know me?\u201d The tone of the question was distinctly unfriendly.</p><p>Roger took a deep breath, cursing his own dishevelment. He didn\u2019t know how Brianna might have described him to her father, but Fraser had evidently expected something a good deal more prepossessing.</p><p>\u201cWell, you\u2014look quite a bit like your daughter.\u201d</p><p>The young man gave a loud snort, but Fraser didn\u2019t look around.</p> <p>\u201cAnd what business have ye wi\u2019 my daughter?\u201d Fraser moved for the first time, stepping out from the shadow of the trees. No, Claire hadn\u2019t exaggerated. He was big, even an inch or two taller than Roger himself.</p><p>Roger felt a stab of alarm, mingled with his confusion. What the hell had Brianna told him? Surely she couldn\u2019t have been so angry that\u2014well, he\u2019d sort that out when he saw her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve come to claim my wife,\u201d he said boldly.</p><p>Something changed in Fraser\u2019s eyes. Roger didn\u2019t know what it was, but it made him drop his hat, and half raise his hands in reflex.</p><p>\u201cOh, no, ye\u2019re not.\u201d It was the boy who had spoken, in an odd tone of satisfaction.</p> <p>Roger glanced at him, and was still more alarmed to see the lad\u2019s big, bony knuckles white on the pistol\u2019s grip.</p><p>\u201cHere be careful! You don\u2019t want that to go off by accident,\u201d he said.</p><p>The young man\u2019s lip lifted in a sneer.</p><p>\u201cIf it goes off, it\u2019ll be no accident.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIan.\u201d Fraser\u2019s voice stayed level, but the pistol lowered, reluctantly. The big man took another step forward. His eyes were fixed on Roger\u2019s, deep blue and slanted; unnervingly like Brianna\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll ask only the once, and I mean to hear the truth,\u201d he said, quite mildly. \u201cHave ye taken my daughter\u2019s maidenheid?\u201d</p> <p>Roger felt his face grow hot as a flood of warmth washed up from chest to hairline. Christ, what had she told her father? And for God\u2019s sake, why? The last thing he had expected to meet was an infuriated father, bent on avenging his daughter\u2019s virtue.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s...ah...well, it\u2019s not what you think,\u201d he blurted. \u201cI mean, we...that is...we meant to...\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid ye or no?\u201d Fraser\u2019s face was no more than a foot away, completely expressionless, save for whatever it was that burned, far back in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cLook\u2014I\u2014damn it, yes! She wanted to\u2014\u201d</p><p>Fraser hit him, just under the ribs.</p><p>Roger doubled and staggered back, gasping from the blow. It didn\u2019t hurt\u2014yet\u2014but he\u2019d felt the force of it all the way to his spine. His principal feeling was one of amazement, tinged with anger.</p><p>\u201cStop,\u201d he said, trying to get enough breath to talk. \u201cStop! For God\u2019s sake, I said I\u2014\u201d</p><p>Fraser hit him again, this time on the side of the jaw. That one hurt, a glancing blow that scraped the skin and left his jawbone throbbing. Roger jerked back, fear turning rapidly to fury. The bloody sod was trying to kill him!</p> <p>Fraser swung at him again, but missed as Roger ducked and whirled. Well, to f**k with good family relations, then!</p><p>He took a giant step backward, shrugging out of his coat. To his surprise, Fraser didn\u2019t come after him, but stood there, fists at his sides, waiting.</p><p>The blood was drumming in Roger\u2019s ears, and he had no eyes for anyone but Fraser. If it was a fight the bugger wanted, that\u2019s what he\u2019d get, then.</p><p>Roger crouched, hands up and ready. He\u2019d been taken by surprise, but he wouldn\u2019t be caught that way again. No brawler, still he\u2019d been in his share of pub fights. They were well matched for height and reach, and he had more than fifteen years\u2019 advantage on the man.</p><p>He saw Fraser\u2019s right, ducked and countered, felt his fist brush linen as it passed Fraser\u2019s side and then the left he hadn\u2019t seen took him in the eye. Bloody stars and streaks of light exploded through the side of his head, and tears ran down his cheek as he launched himself at Fraser, roaring.</p><p>He hit the man; he could feel his fists strike flesh, but it seemed to make no difference. Through his one sound eye, he could see that broad-boned face, set in eerie calm, like a Viking berserker. He swung, and it disappeared, bobbed up again; he swung, grazing an ear. A blow struck him in the shoulder; he swung half around with it, recovered, and launched himself headfirst.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s...mine,\u201d Roger gritted between clenched teeth. He had his arms wrapped around Fraser\u2019s body, felt the deep-sprung ribs give as he squeezed. He\u2019d crack the bastard like a nut. \u201cMine...hear?\u201d</p><p>Fraser rabbit-punched him in the back of the neck, a glancing blow, but hard enough to numb his left arm and shoulder. He let go his grip, hunched and drove his right shoulder hard into Fraser\u2019s chest, trying to drive the older man off his feet.</p><p>Fraser took a short step back and hooked him hard, but the blow struck his ribs, not the soft flesh below. Still, it was hard enough to make him grunt and jerk back, crouching to protect himself.</p><p>Fraser lowered his head and butted him, straight on; he flew backward and landed hard. Blood from his nose ran down his mouth and chin; with a sense of remoteness, he watched the spatter of dark red drops grow and run together into a splotch on his shirt.</p><p>He rolled to one side to avoid the kick he saw coming, but not far enough. As he rolled frantically the other way, it occurred to him, in a detached sort of way, that while he might be fifteen years younger than his opponent, Jamie Fraser had likely spent every one of those fifteen years engaged in physical combat.</p><p>He had got momentarily out of range. Gulping air, he rolled up onto his hands and knees. Blood gurgled through smashed cartilage with each breath; he could taste it in the back of his throat, a taste like sheared metal.</p><p>\u201cNuff,\u201d he panted. \u201cNo. \u2019Nuff!\u201d</p><p>A hand grabbed his hair and jerked back his head. Blue eyes glittered six inches away, and he felt the man\u2019s breath hot on his face.</p><p>\u201cNot nearly enough,\u201d Fraser said, and kneed him in the mouth. He fell over and rolled once, then struggled to his feet. The clearing blurred in a throb of orange and yellow; only instinct got him up and moving.</p><p>He was fighting for his life, and knew it. He hurled himself blindly at the weaving figure, got a grip of Fraser\u2019s shirt and drove a punch at the man\u2019s belly, as hard as he could. Fabric tore and his fist struck bone. Fraser shifted like a snake and shot a hand down between them. He grabbed Roger\u2019s testicles and squeezed with all his strength.</p><p>Roger stood stock-still, then dropped as though his spinal cord had been severed. There was a split second, before the pain hit, when Roger was conscious of one last thought, cold and clear as a shard of ice. My God, he thought, I\u2019m going to die before I\u2019ve been born.</p><p>47</p><p>A FATHER\u2019S SONG</p><p>It was well after dark before Jamie came in, and my nerves were thoroughly on edge from the waiting; I could only imagine Brianna\u2019s. We had eaten supper\u2014or I should say, supper had been served. None of us had any appetite, either for food or conversation; even Lizzie\u2019s normal voracity was noticeably impaired. I hoped the girl wasn\u2019t ill; pale and silent, she had pled a headache and gone to bed in the herb shed. Still, it was fortunate in the circumstances; it saved me having to invent an excuse to get rid of her once Jamie did arrive.</p><p>The candles had been lit for over an hour when I finally heard the goats bleat in greeting at his step on the path. Brianna looked up at once at the sound, her face pale in the yellow light.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be all right,\u201d I said. She heard the confidence in my voice and nodded, slightly reassured. The confidence was authentic, but not unalloyed. I thought everything would be all right eventually\u2014but God knew, it wasn\u2019t going to be a jolly family evening. Well as I knew Jamie, there were still a good many circumstances in which I had no idea how he would react\u2014and hearing that his daughter was pregnant by a r**ist was certainly one of them.</p><p>In the hours since Brianna had made my suspicions a certainty, I had envisioned virtually every possible response he might make, several of them involving shouting or the putting of his fists through solid objects, behavior which I always found upsetting. So might Bree, and I knew rather better what she might do when upset.</p><p>She was under a tight control for the moment, but I knew how precarious her calm demeanor was. Let him say a bruising word to her, and she would flare like a striking match. Beyond red hair and arresting height, she had from Jamie both a passionate nature and a perfect readiness to speak her mind.</p><p>So unfamiliar and so anxious to please each other, they had both so far stepped delicately\u2014but there seemed no delicate way of handling this. Unsure whether I should prepare myself to be advocate, interpreter, or referee, it was with rather a hollow feeling that I lifted the latch to let him in.</p><p>He had washed at the creek; his hair was damp at the temples, and he had wiped his face on his shirttail, judging by the moist patches on it.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re very late; where were you?\u201d I asked, standing on tiptoe to give him a kiss. \u201cAnd where\u2019s Ian?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFergus came and asked could we give him a hand wi\u2019 his chimney stones, as he couldna manage verra well by himself. Ian\u2019s stayed ower, to help finish the job.\u201d He dropped an absent kiss on top of my head, and patted my bottom. He\u2019d been working hard, I thought; he was warm to my touch and smelled pungently of sweat, though the skin of his face was cool and fresh from washing.</p><p>\u201cDid Marsali feed you supper?\u201d I peered at him in the gloom. Something seemed different about him, though I couldn\u2019t think what.</p><p>\u201cNo. I dropped a stone and I\u2019ve maybe broken my blasted finger again; I thought I\u2019d best come home and have ye tend to it.\u201d That was it, I thought; he\u2019d patted me with his left hand instead of his right.</p><p>\u201cCome into the light and let me see.\u201d I drew him to the fire, and made him sit down on one of the oak settles. Brianna was on the other, her sewing spread around her. She got up and came to look over my shoulder.</p><p>\u201cYour poor hands, Da!\u201d she said, seeing the swollen knuckles and scraped skin.</p><p>\u201cOch, it\u2019s no great matter,\u201d he said, glancing dismissively at them. \u201cSave for the bloody finger. Ow!\u201d</p><p>I felt my way gently over the fourth finger of his right hand, from base to nail, disregarding his small grunt of pain. It was reddened and slightly swollen, but not visibly dislocated.</p><p>It always troubled me slightly to examine this hand. I had set a number of broken bones in it long ago, before I knew anything of formal surgery, and working under far from ideal conditions. I had managed; I had saved the hand from amputation, and he had good use of it, but there were small awkwardnesses; slight twistings and thickenings that I was aware of whenever I felt it closely. Still, at the moment, I blessed the opportunity for delay.</p><p>I closed my eyes, feeling the fire\u2019s warm flicker on my lids as I concentrated. The fourth finger was always stiff; the middle joint had been crushed, and healed frozen. I could see the bone in my mind; not the polished dry surface of a laboratory specimen, but the faintly luminous matte glow of living bone, all the tiny osteoblasts busily laying down their crystal matrix, and the hidden pulse of the blood that fed them. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Once more, I drew my own finger down the length of his, then took it gently between my thumb and index finger, just below the distal joint. I could feel the crack in my mind, a thin dark line of pain.</p><p>\u201cThere?\u201d I asked, opening my eyes.</p><p>He nodded, a faint smile on his lips as he looked at me.</p><p>\u201cJust there. I like the way ye look when ye do that, Sassenach.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat way is that?\u201d I asked, a bit startled to hear that I looked any way in particular.</p><p>\u201cI canna describe it, exactly,\u201d he said, head tilted to one side as he examined me. \u201cIt\u2019s maybe like\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMadame Lazonga with her crystal ball,\u201d Brianna said, sounding amused.</p><p>I glanced up, taken aback to find Brianna gazing down at me, head cocked at the same angle, with the same appraising look. She switched her gaze to Jamie. \u201cA fortune-teller, I mean. A seer.\u201d</p><p>He laughed.</p> <p>\u201cAye, I think you\u2019re maybe right, a nighean. Though it was a priest I was thinking of; the way they look saying Mass, when they look past the bread and see the flesh of Christ instead. Not that I should think to compare my measly finger wi\u2019 the Body of Our Lord, mind,\u201d he added, with a modest nod toward the offending digit.</p><p>Brianna laughed, and a smile curved his mouth on one side, as he looked up at her, his eyes soft despite the lines of tiredness round them. He\u2019d had a long day, I thought. And likely to be a lot longer. I would have given anything to hold that fleeting moment of connection between them, but it had passed already.</p><p>\u201cI think you are both ridiculous,\u201d I said. I touched his finger lightly at the spot I\u2019d held. \u201cThe bone is cracked, just there below the joint. It\u2019s not bad, though; no more than a hairline fracture. I\u2019ll splint it, just in case.\u201d</p><p>I got up and went to rummage through my medical chest for a linen bandage and one of the long, flat wood chips I used as tongue depressors. I glanced covertly over the raised lid, watching him. Something was definitely odd about him this evening, though I still couldn\u2019t put my finger on it.</p><p>I had sensed it from the first, even through my own agitation, and sensed it even more strongly when I held his hand to examine it; a sort of energy pulsed through him, as though he were excited or upset, though he gave no outward sign of it. He was bloody good at hiding things when he wanted to; what the hell had happened at Fergus\u2019s house?</p><p>Brianna said something to Jamie, too low for me to catch, and then turned away without waiting for an answer, and came to join me by the open chest.</p> <p>\u201cDo you have some ointment, for his hands?\u201d she asked. Then, leaning close on pretext of looking into the chest, said in a low voice, \u201cShould I tell him tonight? He\u2019s tired and he\u2019s hurt. Hadn\u2019t I better let him rest?\u201d</p><p>I glanced at Jamie. He was leaning back against the settle, eyes wide open as he watched the flames, hands resting flat on his thighs. He wasn\u2019t relaxed, though; whatever strange current was flowing through him, it had him strung like a telegraph wire.</p><p>\u201cHe might rest better not knowing, but you won\u2019t,\u201d I said, equally low-voiced. \u201cGo ahead and tell him. You might let him eat first, though,\u201d I added practically. I was a strong believer in meeting bad news on a full stomach.</p><p>I splinted Jamie\u2019s finger while Brianna sat down beside him and dabbed gentian ointment onto the abraded knuckles of his other hand. Her face was quite calm; no one would ever guess what was going on behind it.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve torn your shirt,\u201d I said, finishing off the last bandage with a small square knot. \u201cGive it to me after supper and I\u2019ll mend it. How\u2019s that, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVerra nice, Madame Lazonga,\u201d he said, gingerly wiggling his freshly splinted finger. \u201cI shall be getting quite spoilt, wi\u2019 so much attention paid me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen I start to chew your food for you, you can worry,\u201d I said tartly.</p><p>He laughed, and gave the splinted hand to Bree for anointing.</p> <p>I went to the cupboard to fetch a plate for him. As I turned back toward the hearth, I saw him watching her intently. She kept her head bent, eyes on the large, callused hand she held between her own. I could imagine her search for words with which to begin, and my heart ached for her. Perhaps I should have told him privately myself, I thought; not let him near her until the first rush of feeling was safely past and he had himself in hand again.</p><p>\u201cCiamar a tha tu, mo chridhe?\u201d he said suddenly. It was his customary greeting to her, the beginning of their evening Gaelic lesson, but his voice was different tonight; soft, and very gentle. How are you, darling? His hand turned and covered hers, cradling her long fingers.</p><p>\u201cTha mi gle mhath, athair,\u201d she replied, looking a bit surprised. I am well, Father. Normally he began the lesson after dinner.</p><p>Slowly he reached out with his other hand and rested it gently on her stomach.</p><p>\u201cAn e \u2019n fhirinn a th\u2019agad?\u201d he asked. Do you tell me true? I closed my eyes and let out a breath I didn\u2019t realize I\u2019d been holding. No need to break all the news, after all. And now I knew the reason for his taut-strung strangeness; he knew, and whatever the knowledge cost him to hold, hold it he would, and treat her gently.</p><p>She didn\u2019t know enough Gaelic yet to tell what he\u2019d asked, but she knew well enough what he meant. She stared at him for a moment, frozen, then lifted his sound hand to her cheek and bent her head over it, the loose hair hiding her face.</p><p>\u201cOh, Da,\u201d she said, very quietly. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>She sat quite still, holding to his hand as though it were a lifeline.</p><p>\u201cAh, now, m\u2019 annsachd,\u201d he said softly, \u201cit will be all right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it won\u2019t,\u201d she said, her voice small but clear. \u201cIt can\u2019t ever be right. You know that.\u201d</p><p>He glanced at me out of habit, but only briefly. I couldn\u2019t tell him what to do, now. He drew a deep breath, took her by the shoulder and gave her a gentle shake.</p><p>\u201cAll I know,\u201d he said softly, \u201cis that I\u2019m here by ye, and your mother, too. We willna see ye shamed or hurt. Not ever. D\u2019ye hear me?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t answer or look up, but kept her eyes on her lap, her face hidden by the rich fall of her hair. A maiden\u2019s hair, thick and unbound. His hand traced the shining curve of her head, then his fingers trailed along her jaw and lifted her chin so her eyes looked into his.</p><p>\u201cLizzie\u2019s right?\u201d he asked gently. \u201cIt was rape?\u201d</p><p>She pulled her chin away and looked down at her knotted hands, the gesture as much an admission as her nod.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t think she knew. I didn\u2019t tell her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe guessed. But it\u2019s no your fault, and dinna ever think so,\u201d he said firmly. \u201cCome here to me, a leannan.\u201d He reached for her, and gathered her awkwardly onto his knee.</p><p>The oakwood creaked alarmingly under their combined weight, but Jamie had built it after his usual sturdy fashion; it could have held six of him. Tall as Brianna was, she looked almost small cradled in his arms, her head tucked into the curve of his shoulder. He stroked her hair gently, and murmured small things to her, half in Gaelic.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see ye safe marrit, and your bairn wi\u2019 a good father,\u201d he murmured to her. \u201cI swear it to ye, a nighean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t marry anybody,\u201d she said, sounding choked. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be right. I can\u2019t take somebody else when I love Roger. And Roger won\u2019t want me now. When he finds out\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll make no difference to him,\u201d Jamie said, grasping her harder, almost fiercely, as though he could make things right by pure force of will. \u201cIf he\u2019s a decent man, it\u2019ll make no difference. And if it does\u2014well, then he doesna deserve ye, and I shall beat him into pulp and stamp on the pieces, and then go and find ye a better man.\u201d</p><p>She gave a small laugh that turned into a sob, and buried her head in the cloth of his shoulder. He patted her, rocking and murmuring as though she were a tiny girl with a skinned knee, and his eyes met mine over her head.</p><p>I hadn\u2019t wept when she had told me; mothers are strong. But now she couldn\u2019t see me, and Jamie had taken the burden of strength from my shoulders for the moment.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t cried when she told me, either. But now she clung to him and wept, as much from relief, I thought, as from grief. He simply held her and let her cry, stroking her hair again and again, his eyes on my face.</p><p>I blotted my eyes on my sleeve, and he smiled at me, faintly. Brianna had subsided into long, sighing breaths, and he patted her gently on the back.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m hungry, Sassenach,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I should imagine a wee drop wouldna come amiss for any of us, aye?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d I said, and cleared my throat. \u201cI\u2019ll go and fetch some milk from the shed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s no what I meant by drink!\u201d he called after me in mock outrage.</p><p>Ignoring both this and Brianna\u2019s choked laugh, I pushed open the door.</p><p>The night outside was cold and bright, the autumn stars bright sparks overhead. I wasn\u2019t dressed to be outdoors\u2014my face and hands were already beginning to tingle\u2014but I stood quite still nonetheless, letting the cold wind sweep past me, taking with it the tension of the last quarter hour.</p><p>Everything was quiet; the crickets and cicadas had long since died or gone underground with the rustling mice, the skunks and possums who left off their endless search for food and went to dream their winter dreams, the rich fat of their efforts wrapped warm about their bones. Only wolves hunted in the cold, starry nights of late autumn, and they went silent, fur-footed on the frozen ground.</p><p>\u201cWhat are we going to do?\u201d I said softly, addressing the question to the overwhelming depths of the vast dark sky overhead.</p><p>I heard no sound but the rush of wind in the pine trees; no answer, save the form of my own question\u2014the faint echo of \u201cwe\u201d that rang in my ears. That much was true at least; whatever happened, none of us need face things alone. And I supposed that was after all as much answer as I needed, for now.</p><p>They were still on the settle when I came back in, red heads close together, haloed by the fire. The smell of gentian ointment mingled with the pungent scent of burning pine and the mouth-watering aroma of the venison stew\u2014quite suddenly, I was hungry.</p><p>I let the door close quietly behind me, and slid to the heavy bolt. I went to poke the fire and lay a new supper, fetching down a fresh loaf of bread from the shelf, then went to get sweet butter from the crock in the pantry. I stayed a moment there, glancing over the loaded shelves.</p><p>\u201cPut your trust in God, and pray for guidance. And when in doubt, eat.\u201d A Franciscan monk had once given me that advice, and on the whole, I had found it useful. I picked out a jar of black currant jam, a small round goat cheese, and a bottle of elderflower wine, to go with the meal.</p><p>Jamie was talking quietly when I came back. I finished my preparations, letting the deep lilt of his voice soothe me, as well as Brianna.</p><p>\u201cI used to think of you, when ye were small,\u201d Jamie was saying to Bree, his voice very soft. \u201cWhen I lived in the cave; I would imagine that I held ye in my arms, a wee babe. I would hold ye so, against my heart, and sing to ye there, watching the stars go by overhead.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat would you sing?\u201d Brianna\u2019s voice was low, too, barely audible above the crackle of the fire. I could see her hand, resting on his shoulder. Her index finger touched a long, bright strand of his hair, tentatively stroking its softness.</p><p>\u201cOld songs. Lullabies I could remember, that my mother sang to me, the same that my sister Jenny would sing to her bairns.\u201d</p><p>She sighed, a long, slow sound.</p><p>\u201cSing to me now, please, Da.\u201d</p> <p>He hesitated, but then tilted his head toward hers and began to chant softly, an odd tuneless song in Gaelic. Jamie was tone-deaf; the song wavered oddly up and down, bearing no resemblance to music, but the rhythm of the words was a comfort to the ear.</p><p>I caught most of the words; a fisher\u2019s song, naming the fish of loch and sea, telling the child what he would bring home to her for food. A hunter\u2019s song, naming birds and beasts of prey, feathers for beauty and furs for warmth, meat to last the winter. It was a father\u2019s song\u2014a soft litany of providence and protection.</p><p>I moved quietly around the room, taking down the pewter plates and wooden bowls for supper, coming back to cut bread and spread it with butter.</p><p>\u201cDo you know something, Da?\u201d Bree asked softly.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d he said, momentarily suspending his song.</p> <p>\u201cYou can\u2019t sing.\u201d</p><p>There was a soft exhalation of laughter and the rustle of cloth as he shifted to make them both more comfortable.</p><p>\u201cAye, that\u2019s true. Shall I stop, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She snuggled closer, tucking her head into the curve of his shoulder.</p><p>He resumed his tuneless crooning, only to interrupt himself a few moments later.</p><p>\u201cD\u2019ye ken something yourself, a leannan?\u201d</p> <p>Her eyes were closed, her lashes casting deep shadows on her cheeks, but I saw her lips curve in a smile.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that, Da?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYe weigh as much as a full-grown deer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShall I get off, then?\u201d she asked, not moving.</p><p>\u201cOf course not.\u201d</p><p>She reached up and touched his cheek.</p><p>\u201cMi gradhaich a thu, athair,\u201d she whispered. My love to you, Father.</p><p>He gathered her tightly against him, bent his head and kissed her forehead. The fire struck a knot of pitch and blazed up suddenly behind the settle, limning their faces in gold and black. His features were harsh-cut and bold; hers, a more delicate echo of his heavy, clean-edged bones. Both stubborn, both strong. And both, thank God, mine.</p> <p>Brianna fell asleep after supper, worn out from emotion. I was feeling rather limp, myself, but not yet in any mood to sleep. I was at once exhausted and jittery, with that horrible battlefield feeling, of being in the midst of events beyond my ability to control, but which must be dealt with anyway.</p><p>I didn\u2019t want to deal with anything. What I wanted was to push away all thought of both present and future, and go back to the peace of the night before.</p><p>I wanted to crawl into bed with Jamie, and lie warm against him, the two of us sealed safe beneath the quilts against the growing chill of the room. Watch the embers fade as we talked softly, colloquy changing from the gossip and small jokes of the day to the language of the night. Let our talk go from words to touch, from breath to the small movements of the body that were in themselves question and answer; the completion of our conversation come at last to silence in the unity of sleep.</p><p>But trouble lay on the house tonight, and there was no peace between us.</p><p>He roamed the house like a caged wolf, picking things up and putting them down. I tidied away the things from dinner, watching him from the corners of my eyes. I wanted nothing more than to talk to him\u2014and at the same time, dreaded it. I had promised Bree not to tell him about Bonnet. But I was a bad enough liar at any time\u2014and he knew my face so well.</p><p>I filled a bucket of hot water from the big cauldron, and took the pewter plates outside to rinse clean.</p><p>I came back to find Jamie standing by the small shelf where he kept his inkhorn, quills and paper. He had not undressed for bed, but he made no move to take them down and begin the usual evening\u2019s work. But of course\u2014he couldn\u2019t write, with his damaged hand.</p><p>\u201cDo you want me to write something for you?\u201d I asked, seeing him pick up a quill and put it down again.</p><p>He turned away with a restless gesture.</p><p>\u201cNo. I must write to Jenny, of course\u2014and there are other things that must be done\u2014but I canna bear to sit down and think just now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know how you feel,\u201d I said sympathetically. He looked at me, a trifle startled.</p><p>\u201cI canna tell quite how I feel myself, Sassenach,\u201d he said, with a queer laugh. \u201cIf ye think ye know, tell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTired,\u201d I said, and laid a hand on his arm. \u201cAngry. Worried.\u201d I glanced at Brianna asleep in the trundle. \u201cHeartbroken, maybe,\u201d I added softly.</p><p>\u201cAll of that,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd a good bit more.\u201d He wore no stock, but plucked at the collar of his shirt, as though it choked him.</p><p>\u201cI canna stay in here,\u201d he said. He glanced at me; I was still dressed in my day clothes; skirt, shift, and bodice. \u201cWill ye come out and walk wi\u2019 me a bit?\u201d</p><p>I went at once to fetch my cloak. It was dark outside; he wouldn\u2019t be able to watch my face.</p><p>We paced slowly together, across the dooryard and past the sheds, down to the penfold and the field beyond. I held his arm, feeling it tense and stiff under my fingers.</p><p>I had no notion how to begin, what to say. Perhaps I should simply keep quiet, I thought. Both of us were still upset, though we had done our best to be calm for Brianna.</p><p>I could feel the rage boiling just under his skin. Very understandable, but anger is as volatile as kerosene\u2014bottled under pressure, with no target on which to unleash it. An unwary word of mine might be enough to trigger an explosion. And if he exploded at me, I might either cry or go for his throat\u2014my own mood was far from certain.</p><p>We walked for quite a long time, through the trees to the dead cornfield, all round the edge and back, moving all the time soft-footed through a minefield of silence.</p><p>\u201cJamie,\u201d I said at last, as we reached the edge of the field, \u201cwhat have you been doing with your hands?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d He swung toward me, startled.</p><p>\u201cYour hands.\u201d I caught one of them, held it between my own. \u201cYou didn\u2019t do that kind of damage stacking chimney stones.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d He stood still, letting me touch the swollen knuckles of his hand.</p><p>\u201cBrianna,\u201d he said. \u201cShe\u2014she didna tell ye anything about the man? Did she tell ye his name?\u201d</p><p>I hesitated\u2014and was lost. He knew me very well.</p><p>\u201cShe did tell ye, no?\u201d His voice was thick with danger.</p><p>\u201cShe made me promise not to tell you,\u201d I blurted. \u201cI told her you\u2019d know I was keeping something from you; but Jamie, I did promise\u2014don\u2019t make me tell you, please!\u201d</p><p>He snorted again, in half-amused disgust.</p><p>\u201cAye, I ken ye well, Sassenach; ye couldna keep a secret from anyone who knows ye in the slightest. Even wee Ian can read ye like a book.\u201d</p><p>He flapped a hand in dismissal.</p><p>\u201cDinna trouble your conscience. Let her tell me herself, when she will. I can wait.\u201d His bruised hand curled slowly against his kilt, and a small shiver ran up my back.</p><p>\u201cYour hands,\u201d I said again.</p><p>He took a deep breath and held them out before him, backs up. He flexed them, slowly.</p><p>\u201cD\u2019ye recall, Sassenach, once when we were first acquent? Dougal deviled me to where I thought I must pound him, and yet I couldna do it, then. You told me, \u2018Hit something, you\u2019ll feel better.\u2019 \u201d He gave me a wry, lopsided smile. \u201cAnd I hit a tree. It hurt, but you were right, no? I did feel better, at least for a bit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d I let out my breath, relieved that he didn\u2019t mean to press the matter. Let him wait, then; I doubted that he quite realized yet that his daughter could be as stubborn as he was himself.</p><p>\u201cDid she\u2014did she tell ye what happened?\u201d I couldn\u2019t see his face, but the hesitation in his speech was noticeable. \u201cI mean\u2014\u201d He drew in his breath with a deep hiss. \u201cDid the man hurt her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, not physically.\u201d</p><p>I hesitated myself, imagining that I could feel the weight of the ring in my pocket, though of course I couldn\u2019t. Brianna had not asked me to keep anything to myself, other than Bonnet\u2019s name, but I would not tell Jamie any of the details she had told me, unless he asked. And I did not think he would ask; it was the last thing he would want to know.</p><p>He didn\u2019t ask; only muttered something under his breath in Gaelic and walked on, head bent.</p><p>The silence once broken, I found that I could not bear it any longer. Better to explode than suffocate. I took my hand from his arm.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you thinking?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am wondering\u2014if it is as terrible to be\u2014to be violated...if it is\u2014is not...if there is not...damage.\u201d He shifted his shoulders restlessly, half shrugging as though his coat were too tight.</p><p>I knew very well what was in his mind. Wentworth prison, and the faint scars that webbed his back, a net of dreadful memory.</p><p>\u201cBad enough, I suppose,\u201d I said. \u201cThough I expect you\u2019re right, it would be easier to stand if there were no physical reminder of it. But then, there is a physical reminder of it,\u201d I felt obliged to add. \u201cAnd a bloody noticeable one, come to that!\u201d His left hand curled at his side, clenching involuntarily.</p><p>\u201cAye, that\u2019s so,\u201d he muttered. He glanced uncertainly at me, the half-moon\u2019s light gilding the planes of his face. \u201cBut still\u2014he didna hurt her, that\u2019s something. If he had...killing would be too good for him,\u201d he finished abruptly.</p><p>\u201cThere is the very minor detail that you don\u2019t precisely \u2018recover\u2019 from pregnancy,\u201d I said with a marked edge to my voice. \u201cIf he\u2019d broken her bones or shed her blood, she\u2019d heal. As it is\u2014she isn\u2019t ever going to forget it, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know!\u201d</p><p>I flinched slightly, and he saw it. He made a sketchy gesture of apology.</p><p>\u201cI didna mean to shout.\u201d</p><p>I gave him back a brief nod of acknowledgment, and we walked on, side by side, but not touching.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2014\u201d he began, and then broke off, glancing at me. He grimaced, impatient with himself.</p><p>\u201cI do know,\u201d he said, more quietly. \u201cYe\u2019ll forgive me, Sassenach, but I ken the hell of a lot more about the matter than you do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t arguing with you. But you haven\u2019t borne a child; you can\u2019t know what that\u2019s like. It\u2019s\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are arguing wi\u2019 me, Sassenach. Don\u2019t.\u201d He squeezed my arm, hard, and let it go. There was a touch of humor in his voice, but he was dead serious overall.</p><p>\u201cI am trying to tell ye what I know.\u201d He stood still for a minute, gathering himself.</p><p>\u201cI havena put myself in mind of Jack Randall for some good time,\u201d he said at last. \u201cI dinna want to do it now. But there it is.\u201d He shrugged again, and rubbed a hand hard down one cheek. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThere is body, and there is soul, Sassenach,\u201d he said, speaking slowly, ordering his ideas with his words. \u201cYou\u2019re a physician; ye\u2019ll ken the one well. But the other is more important.\u201d</p><p>I opened my mouth to say that I knew that as well as he did, if not better\u2014but then shut it without saying anything. He didn\u2019t notice; he wasn\u2019t seeing the dark cornfield, or the maple wood with its leaves gone silver with moonlight. His eyes were fixed on a small room with thick stone walls, furnished with a table and stools and a lamp. And a bed.</p><p>\u201cRandall,\u201d he said, and his voice was meditative. \u201cThe most of what he did to me\u2014I could have stood it.\u201d He spread out the fingers of his right hand; the dressing on the cracked finger shone white.</p><p>\u201cI would have been afraid, been hurt; I would have meant to kill him for doing it. But I could have lived, after, and not felt his touch always on my skin, felt filthy in myself\u2014were it not that he wasna satisfied with my body. He wanted my soul\u2014and he had it.\u201d The white bandage vanished as his fist folded.</p> <p>\u201cAye, well\u2014ye ken all that.\u201d He turned away abruptly and began to walk. I had to scurry to catch him up.</p><p>\u201cWhat I am saying, I suppose, is\u2014was this man a stranger to her, who only took her for a moment\u2019s pleasure? If it was only her body that he wanted...then I think she will heal.\u201d</p><p>He took a deep breath and let it out again; I saw the faint white mist surround his head for a moment, the steam of his anger made visible.</p><p>\u201cBut if he knew her\u2014was close enough to want her, and not just any woman\u2014then perhaps it might be that he could touch her soul, and do real damage\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t think he did real damage?\u201d My voice rose, despite myself. \u201cWhether he knew her or not\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt is different, I tell ye!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s not. I know what you mean\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do! But why\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause it is not your body that matters when I take you,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd ye ken that well enough, Sassenach!\u201d</p><p>He turned and kissed me fiercely, taking me completely by surprise. He crushed my lips against my teeth, then took my whole mouth with his, half biting, demanding.</p> <p>I knew what he wanted of me; the same thing I wanted so desperately of him\u2014reassurance. But neither of us had it to give, tonight.</p><p>His fingers dug into my shoulders, slid upward and grasped my neck. The hairs rose up on my arms as he pressed me to him\u2014and then he stopped.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d he said. He squeezed my neck hard, and then let go. His breath came raggedly. \u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>He stepped back and turned away from me, groping for the fence rail before him as though blind. He grasped the wood hard with both hands, and stood there, eyes closed.</p><p>I was shaking, my legs gone watery. I wrapped my arms around myself under my cloak and sat down at his feet. And waited, my heart beating painfully loud in my ears. The night wind moved through the trees on the ridge, murmuring through the pines. Somewhere, far away in the dark hills, a panther screamed, sounding like a woman.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that I dinna want ye,\u201d he said at last, and I caught the faint rustle of his coat as he turned toward me. He stood for a moment, head bowed, his bound hair gleaming in the moonlight, face hidden by the darkness, with the moon behind him. At last he leaned down and took my hand in his bruised one, lifting me to my feet.</p><p>\u201cI want ye maybe more than I ever have,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cAnd Christ! I do need ye, Claire. But I canna bear even to think of myself as a man just now. I cannot touch you, and think of what he\u2014I can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>I touched his arm.</p> <p>\u201cI do understand,\u201d I said, and did. I was glad that he hadn\u2019t asked for the details; I wished I didn\u2019t know them. How would it be, to make love with him, envisioning all the time an act identical in its motions, but utterly different in its essence?</p><p>\u201cI understand, Jamie,\u201d I said again.</p><p>He opened his eyes and looked at me.</p><p>\u201cAye, ye do, don\u2019t you? And that\u2019s what I mean.\u201d He took my arm and drew me close to him.</p><p>\u201cYou could tear me limb from limb, Claire, without touching me,\u201d he whispered, \u201cfor ye know me.\u201d His fingers touched the side of my face. They were cold, and stiff. \u201cAnd I could do the same to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could,\u201d I said, feeling a little faint. \u201cBut I really wish you wouldn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>He smiled a little at that, bent and kissed me, very gently. We stood together, barely touching save our lips, breathing each other\u2019s breath.</p><p>Yes, we said silently to each other. Yes, I am still here. It was not rescue, but at least a tiny lifeline, stretched across the gulf that lay between us. I did know what he meant, about the difference between damage to body or soul; what I couldn\u2019t explain to him was the link between the two that centered in the womb. At last I stepped back, looking up at him.</p><p>\u201cBree\u2019s a very strong person,\u201d I said quietly. \u201cLike you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike me?\u201d He gave a small snort. \u201cGod help her, then.\u201d</p><p>He sighed, then turned and began to walk slowly along the line of the fence. I followed, hurrying a little to catch up.</p><p>\u201cThis man, this Roger she speaks of. Will he stand by her?\u201d he asked abruptly.</p><p>I took a deep breath and let it out slowly, not knowing how to answer. I\u2019d known Roger only a few months. I liked him; was very fond of him, in fact. From everything I knew of him, he was a thoroughly decent, honorable young man\u2014but how could I even pretend to know what he might think, do, or feel, upon finding that Brianna had been raped? Even worse, that she might well carry the rapist\u2019s child?</p><p>The best of men might not be able to deal with such a situation; in my years as a doctor, I had seen even well-established marriages shatter under the strain of smaller things. And those that did not shatter, but were crippled by mistrust...involuntarily, I pressed a hand against my leg, feeling the tiny hardness of the gold circle in my pocket. From F. to C. with love. Always.</p><p>\u201cWould you do it?\u201d I said at last. \u201cIf it were me?\u201d</p><p>He glanced at me sharply, and opened his mouth as though to speak. Then he closed it and looked at me, searching my face, his brows knotted with troubled thought.</p><p>\u201cI meant to say \u2018Aye, of course!\u2019 \u201d he said slowly, at last. \u201cBut I did promise ye honesty once, did I not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did,\u201d I said, and felt my heart sink beneath its guilty burden. How could I force him to honesty when I couldn\u2019t give it him back? And yet he had asked.</p><p>He struck the fencepost a light blow with his fist.</p><p>\u201cIfrinn! Yes, damn it\u2014I would. You would be mine, even if the child was not. And if you\u2014yes. I would,\u201d he repeated firmly. \u201cI should take you, and the child with ye, and damn the whole world!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd never think about it afterward?\u201d I asked. \u201cNever let it come into your mind when you came to my bed? Never see the father when you looked at the child? Never throw it back at me or let it make a difference between us?\u201d</p><p>He opened his mouth to reply, but closed it without speaking. Then I saw a change come over his features, a sudden shock of sick realization.</p><p>\u201cOh, Christ,\u201d he said. \u201cFrank. Not me. It\u2019s Frank ye mean.\u201d</p><p>I nodded, and he gripped my shoulders.</p><p>\u201cWhat did he do to ye?\u201d he demanded. \u201cWhat? Tell me, Claire!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe stood by me,\u201d I said, sounding choked even to my own ears. \u201cI tried to make him go, but he wouldn\u2019t. And when the baby\u2014when Brianna came\u2014he loved her, Jamie. He wasn\u2019t sure, he didn\u2019t think he could\u2014neither did I\u2014but he truly did. I\u2019m sorry,\u201d I added.</p><p>He took a deep breath and let go of my shoulders.</p><p>\u201cDinna be sorry for that, Sassenach,\u201d he said gruffly. \u201cNever.\u201d He rubbed a hand across his face, and I could hear the faint rasp of his evening stubble.</p><p>\u201cAnd what about you, Sassenach?\u201d he said. \u201cWhat ye said\u2014when he came to your bed. Did he think\u2014\u201d He broke off abruptly, leaving all the questions hanging in the air between us, unstated, but asked nonetheless.</p><p>\u201cIt might have been me\u2014my fault, I mean,\u201d I said at last, into the silence. \u201cI couldn\u2019t forget, you see. If I could...it might have been different.\u201d I should have stopped there, but I couldn\u2019t; the words that had been dammed up all evening rushed out in a flood.</p><p>\u201cIt might have been easier\u2014better\u2014for him if it had been rape. That\u2019s what they told him, you know\u2014the doctors; that I had been raped and abused, and was having delusions. That\u2019s what everyone believed, but I kept saying to him, no it wasn\u2019t that way, I insisted on telling him the truth. And after a time\u2014he believed me, at least halfway. And that was the trouble; not that I\u2019d had another man\u2019s child\u2014but that I\u2019d loved you. And I wouldn\u2019t stop. I couldn\u2019t,\u201d I added, in a softer tone. \u201cHe was better than me, Frank was. He could put the past away, at least for Bree\u2019s sake. But for me\u2014\u201d The words caught in my throat and I stopped.</p><p>He turned then, and looked at me for a long time, his face quite expressionless, eyes hidden by the shadows of his brows.</p><p>\u201cAnd so ye lived twenty years with a man who couldna forgive ye for what was never your fault? I did that to ye, no?\u201d he said. \u201cI am sorry, too, Sassenach.\u201d</p><p>A small breath escaped me, not quite a sob.</p><p>\u201cYou said you could tear me limb from limb without touching me,\u201d I said. \u201cYou were right, damn you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am sorry,\u201d he whispered again, but this time he reached for me, and held me tight against him.</p><p>\u201cThat I loved you? Don\u2019t be sorry for that,\u201d I said, my voice half muffled in his shirt. \u201cNot ever.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t answer, but bent his head and pressed his cheek against my hair. It was quiet; I could hear his heart beating, over and under the wind in the trees. My skin was cold; the tears on my cheeks chilled instantly.</p><p>At last I let my arms drop from around him and stepped back.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019d better go back to the house,\u201d I said, trying for a normal tone. \u201cIt\u2019s getting awfully late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, I suppose so.\u201d He offered me his arm, and I took it. We passed in an easier silence down the path to the edge of the gorge above the stream. It was cold enough that tiny ice crystals glinted among the rocks where the starlight struck them, but the creek was far from frozen. Its gurgle and rush filled the air, and kept us from being too quiet.</p><p>\u201cAye, well,\u201d he said, as we turned up the path past the pigsty. \u201cI hope Roger Wakefield is a better man than the two of us\u2014Frank and I.\u201d He glanced at me. \u201cMind ye, if he\u2019s not, I shall beat him to a pudding.\u201d</p><p>Despite myself I laughed.</p><p>\u201cThat will be a great help to the situation, I\u2019m sure.\u201d</p><p>He snorted briefly and walked on. At the bottom of the hill, we turned without speaking, and came back in the direction of the house. Just short of the path that led to the door, I stopped him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cJamie,\u201d I said hesitantly. \u201cDo you believe I love you?\u201d</p><p>He turned his head and looked down at me for a long moment before replying.

Perhaps it\u2019s only that I wasn\u2019t raised to say such things; I lived with my uncle, and he was affectionate, but not\u2014well, I didn\u2019t know how married people\u2014\u201d</p><p>He put his hand lightly over my mouth, a faint smile touching his lips. After a moment, he took it away.</p><p>I took a deep breath, steadying my voice.</p><p>\u201cLook, what I mean to say is\u2014if I don\u2019t say it, how do you know I love you?\u201d</p> <p>He stood still, looking at me, then nodded in acknowledgment.</p><p>\u201cI know because ye\u2019re here, Sassenach,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cAnd that\u2019s what ye mean, aye? That he came after her\u2014this Roger. And so perhaps he will love her enough?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a thing you\u2019d do, just for friendship\u2019s sake.\u201d</p><p>He nodded again, but I hesitated, wanting to tell him more, to impress him with the significance of it.</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t told you a great deal about it, because\u2014there aren\u2019t words for it. But one thing about it I could tell you. Jamie\u2014\u201d I shivered involuntarily, and not from the cold. \u201cNot everyone who goes through the stones comes out again.\u201d</p><p>His look sharpened.</p> <p>\u201cHow d\u2019ye ken that, Sassenach?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2014I could\u2014hear them. Screaming.\u201d</p><p>I was shaking outright by this time, from a mixture of cold and memory, and he caught my hands between his own and drew me close. The autumn wind rattled the branches of the willows by the stream, a sound like dry, bare bones. He held me until the shivering stopped, then let me go.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s cold, Sassenach. Come inside.\u201d He turned toward the house, but laid my hand on his shoulder to stop him again.</p><p>\u201cJamie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShould I\u2014would you\u2014do you need me to say it?\u201d</p><p>He turned around and looked down at me. With the light behind him, he was haloed in moonlight, but his features were once more dark.</p> <p>\u201cI dinna need it, no.\u201d His voice was soft. \u201cBut I wouldna mind if ye wanted to say it. Now and again. Not too often, mind; I wouldna want to lose the novelty of it.\u201d I could hear the smile in his voice, and couldn\u2019t help smiling in return, whether he could see it or not.</p><p>\u201cOnce in a while wouldn\u2019t hurt, though?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>I stepped close to him and put my hands on his shoulders.</p><p>\u201cI love you.\u201d</p><p>He looked down at me for a long moment.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad of it, Claire,\u201d he said quietly, and touched my face. \u201cVerra glad. Come to bed now; I\u2019ll warm ye.\u201d</p><p>48</p><p>AWAY IN A MANGER</p><p>The tiny stable was in a shallow cave under a rocky overhang, walled in along the front with a stockade of unpeeled cedar logs, sunk two feet deep in packed earth, stout enough to deter the most resolute bear. Light spilled out through the open upper half of the stable door, and ruddy, light-filled smoke shimmered up the face of the cliff above, rippling like bright water over the stone.</p><p>\u201cWhy a double door?\u201d she had asked. It seemed excessive labor; an unnecessary refinement for such a crude structure.</p><p>\u201cYe must give the beasts a place to look out,\u201d her father had explained, showing her where to smooth the leather strap hinges tight around the curve of the wood. He picked up the hammer to tack down the leather and smiled at her, kneeling over the half-made gate. \u201cKeeps them happy, aye?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t know if the animals were happy in the stable, but she was; cool and shadowy, smelling pungently of cut straw and the droppings of grass-fed animals, it was a peaceful refuge during the day, when its inhabitants were out grazing in the meadow. In bad weather or at night, the little stockade was a pocket of coziness; once she had passed near enough after dark to see the soft, misty exhalations of the animals drifting through the gap between wood and rock, as though the earth itself were breathing through pursed lips, warmly asleep in the autumn cold.</p><p>It was cold tonight, the stars sharp as needle points in the hard, clear air. It was only five minutes\u2019 walk from the house, but Brianna was shivering under her cloak by the time she reached the stable. The light spilling out came not only from a hanging lantern, she saw, but also from a small makeshift brazier in the corner, providing heat and light for the vigil within.</p><p>Her father lay curled up on a bed of straw, his plaid drawn over him, within arm\u2019s reach of the small brindled cow. The heifer lay on her chest, feet tucked to the side, grunting now and then, a look of mild concentration on her broad white face.</p><p>His head lifted abruptly at the sound of her step on the gravel, and his hand went by reflex to his belt, under his plaid.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s me,\u201d she said, and saw him relax as she came into the light. He swung his feet to the side and sat up, rubbing a hand over his face as she came in, carefully latching the lower gate behind her.</p><p>\u201cYour mother\u2019s not back yet?\u201d She was clearly alone, but he glanced briefly over her shoulder as though hoping to see Claire materialize out of the darkness.</p><p>Brianna shook her head. Claire had gone with Lizzie as escort to attend a birth at one of the farms at the far side of the cove; if the child hadn\u2019t arrived before sunset, they would stay the night at the Lachlans\u2019.</p><p>\u201cNo. She said if she wasn\u2019t back, I was to bring you up some supper, though.\u201d She knelt and began to unpack the small basket she had brought, laying out small loaves of bread stuffed with cheese and tomato-pickle, a dried-apple tart, and two stone bottles\u2014one of hot vegetable broth, the other of cider.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s kind, lassie.\u201d He smiled at her and picked up one of the bottles. \u201cWill ye have eaten yet, yourself?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes,\u201d she assured him. \u201cPlenty.\u201d She had eaten, but couldn\u2019t resist a quick look of longing at the fresh rolls; the early faint sense of malaise had left her, replaced by an appetite mildly alarming in its intensity.</p><p>He saw her glance, and with a smile, drew his dirk and sliced one of the rolls in half, handing her the bigger piece.</p><p>They munched companionably for a few moments, sitting side by side on the straw, the silence broken only by soft snuffles and grunts from the stable\u2019s other inhabitants. The far end of the stable was fenced off to provide a pen for the gigantic sow and her new brood of piglets; Brianna could just make them out in the gloom\u2014a row of plump bodies packed in the straw, prophetically sausage-shaped.</p><p>The rest of the small space was divided into three rough stalls. One belonged to the red cow, Magdalen, who lay in the straw peacefully chewing her cud, her month-old calf curled in sleep against her massive chest. The second stall was empty, filled with fresh straw, ready for the brindled cow and her tardy calf. The third stall held Ian\u2019s mare, sides glossy and bulging with the weight of an impending foal.</p><p>\u201cIt looks like a maternity ward in here,\u201d Brianna said, nodding toward Magdalen as she brushed crumbs off her skirt. Jamie smiled and raised a brow, as he always did when she said something he didn\u2019t understand.</p><p>\u201cOh, aye?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a special part of a hospital, where they put the new mothers and their babies,\u201d she explained. \u201cMama would take me to work with her sometimes, and let me go look at the nursery while she did her rounds.\u201d</p><p>She had a sudden memory of the smell of the hospital corridor, faintly acrid with the scent of disinfectant and floor polish, the babies lying bundled, plump as piglets in their bassinets, their blankets coded pink and blue. She always spent a long time going up and down the row, trying to pick which one she would take home with her, if she could keep one.</p><p>Pink or blue? For the first time, she wondered what the one she would now keep might wear. The thought of \u201cit\u201d as male or female was strangely upsetting, and she pushed the thought away with words.</p><p>\u201cThey put the babies all behind a glass wall, so you could look at them, but not breathe germs on them,\u201d she said, with a glance at Magdalen, contentedly oblivious to the strings of green saliva that dripped from her placidly moving jaws onto the head of her calf.</p><p>\u201cGerms,\u201d he said thoughtfully. \u201cAye, I\u2019ve heard about the germs. Dangerous wee beasties, are they not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey can be.\u201d She had a vivid memory of her mother checking her box of medical supplies for the visit to Lachlans\u2019, carefully refilling the large glass bottle of distilled alcohol from the barrel in the pantry. And a more distant but equally vivid memory, of her mother explaining the past to Roger Wakefield.</p><p>\u201cChildbirth was the most dangerous thing a woman could do,\u201d Claire had said, frowning in memory of the sights she had seen. \u201cInfection, ruptured placenta, abnormal presentation, miscarriage, hemorrhage, puerperal fever\u2014in most places, surviving birth was roughly a fifty-fifty proposition.\u201d</p><p>Brianna\u2019s fingers felt cold, in spite of the hissing pine chunks in the brazier, and her ravenous appetite seemed suddenly to have deserted her. She set the rest of her roll down on the straw, swallowing hard, feeling as though a bite of the thick bread had wedged itself in her throat.</p><p>Her father\u2019s broad hand touched her knee, warm even through the wool of her skirt.</p><p>\u201cYour mother willna let ye come to harm,\u201d he said gruffly. \u201cShe\u2019s fought the germs before; I\u2019ve seen her. She didna let them have the better of me, and she willna let them trouble you, either. She\u2019s a verra stubborn person, aye?\u201d</p><p>She laughed, and the choking feeling eased.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019d say it takes one to know one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI expect she\u2019s right about that.\u201d He rose and walked around the brindled heifer, squatting down and squinting at her tail. He stood up, shaking his head, and came to sit down again. He settled comfortably back and picked up the discarded part of Brianna\u2019s roll.</p><p>\u201cIs she doing all right?\u201d Brianna bent and scooped up a twist of straw, holding it invitingly under the heifer\u2019s nose. The cow breathed heavily on her knuckles, but otherwise ignored the attention, the long-lashed brown eyes rolling restlessly to and fro. Now and then the bulging brindled sides rippled, the cow\u2019s thick winter coat rough but shining in the light of the hanging lantern.</p><p>Jamie frowned slightly.</p><p>\u201cAye, I think she\u2019ll maybe do all right. It\u2019s her first calf, though, and she\u2019s small for it. She\u2019s no much more than a yearling herself; she shouldna have been bred so early, but...\u201d He shrugged, and took another bite of roll.</p><p>Brianna wiped the sticky moisture from her hand with a fold of her skirt. Feeling suddenly restless, she stood up and walked over to the pigpen.</p><p>The vast curve of the sow\u2019s belly rose up out of the hay like a swollen balloon, pink flesh visible beneath the soft, sparse white hair. The sow lay in stuporous dignity, breathing slow and deep, ignoring the squirms and squeaks of the hungry brood that scrabbled at her underside. One piglet was nudged too roughly by a fellow and momentarily lost his hold; there was a high-pitched shriek of protest, and a jet of milk spurted from the suddenly released nipple, hissing softly into the hay. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Brianna felt a slight tingle in her own br**sts; they seemed suddenly heavier than usual, resting on her folded forearms as she leaned on the fence.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t a particularly aesthetic picture of motherhood\u2014not exactly Madonna and Child\u2014but there was something vaguely reassuring about the sow\u2019s nonchalant maternal torpor, nonetheless\u2014a sort of careless confidence, a blind trust in natural processes.</p><p>Jamie had another look at the brindled cow, and came to stand beside Brianna by the pigpen.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a good wee lass,\u201d he said approvingly, with a nod at the sow. As though in reply, the sow released a long, rumbling fart, and shifted a bit, stretching out in the straw with a voluptuous sigh.</p> <p>\u201cWell, she does look as though she knows what she\u2019s doing,\u201d Brianna agreed, biting her lip.</p><p>\u201cThat she does. She\u2019s a wicked temper, but she\u2019s an able mother, for-bye. This will be her fourth litter, and not one lost or a runt weaned yet.\u201d He nodded approvingly at the sow, then glanced at the brindled heifer. \u201cI could hope that one does half so well.\u201d</p><p>She took a deep breath.</p><p>\u201cWhat if she doesn\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t answer at once, but stood leaning on the fence, looking down at the gently squirming litter. Then his shoulders rose slightly.</p> <p>\u201cIf she canna bring forth the calf alone, and I canna pull it for her, then I shall have to slaughter her,\u201d he said, matter-of-factly. \u201cIf I can save the calf, I can maybe foster it on Magdalen.\u201d</p><p>Her insides clenched tight, making lumps and knots of the food she\u2019d eaten. She\u2019d seen the dirk at his belt, of course, but it was so much a part of his normal costume, she hadn\u2019t thought to question its presence in this pastoral setting. The small round presence in her belly lay still and heavy, like a time bomb waiting.</p><p>He crouched beside the brindled heifer, and ran a light hand over the bulging flank. Evidently satisfied for the moment, he scratched the cow between the ears, muttering in Gaelic.</p><p>How could he murmur endearments to it, she thought, knowing that within hours he might be slicing into its living flesh? It seemed cold-blooded; did a butcher whisper \u201cSweet lass\u201d to his victims? A small icy doubt dropped into her stomach, to join the other cold weights that lay there, like a collection of ball bearings.</p><p>He stood up and stretched himself, groaning as his spine crackled. He shifted his shoulders, settled, blinked, and smiled at her.</p><p>\u201cWill I walk ye to the house, lassie? It will be some time before aught happens here.\u201d</p> <p>She looked up at him, hesitating, but then made up her mind.</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019ll wait with you a little while. If you don\u2019t mind?\u201d</p><p>Now, she decided on impulse. She would ask now. She had been waiting for days for the right time, but when could a time possibly be right for something like this? At least they would be alone now, with no chance of disturbance.</p><p>\u201cAs ye like. I shall be glad of the company.\u201d</p><p>Not for long, she thought, as he turned away to rummage in the basket she had brought. She would much have preferred darkness. It would have been a lot easier to ask what she needed to know, on the dark trail to the house. But words wouldn\u2019t be enough; she had to see his face.</p><p>Her mouth was dry; she accepted gratefully when he offered her a cup of cider. It was strong and rich, and the slight buzz of alcohol seemed to lighten the weight in her belly a little.</p><p>She gave him the cup but didn\u2019t wait for him to drink, afraid the momentary heartening effect of the cider would desert her before she could get the words out.</p><p>\u201cDa\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAye, lass?\u201d He was pouring more cider, his eyes fixed on the cloudy golden stream.</p><p>\u201cI need to ask you something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMm?\u201d</p><p>She took a deep breath and got it out in a rush.</p><p>\u201cDid you kill Jack Randall?\u201d</p><p>He froze for a moment, the jug still tilted over the cup. Then he turned the jug carefully upright, and set it down on the floor.</p><p>\u201cAnd where will ye have heard that name?\u201d he asked. He looked at her straight on, his voice as level as his eyes. \u201cFrom your father, maybe? From Frank Randall?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMother told me about him.\u201d</p><p>A muscle twitched near the corner of his mouth, the only outward indication of shock.</p><p>\u201cDid she.\u201d</p><p>It wasn\u2019t a question, but she answered it anyway.</p><p>\u201cShe told me what\u2014what happened. What he d-did to you. At Wentworth.\u201d</p><p>Her small spurt of courage was exhausted, but it didn\u2019t matter; she was in too deep to go back now. He simply sat and looked at her, the gourd cup forgotten in his hand. She longed to take it and drain it herself, but didn\u2019t dare.</p><p>It occurred to her, much too late, that he might think it a betrayal that Claire had told anyone, let alone her. She rushed ahead, babbling in her nervousness.</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t now; it was before\u2014I didn\u2019t know you\u2014she thought I\u2019d never meet you. I mean\u2014I don\u2019t think\u2014I know she didn\u2019t mean to\u2014\u201d He raised one eyebrow at her.</p><p>\u201cBe still, aye?\u201d</p><p>She was only too glad to stop talking. She couldn\u2019t look at him, but sat staring down at her lap, her fingers pleating the russet cloth of her skirt. The silence lengthened, broken only by the shiftings and muffled squeals of the piglets, and an occasional digestive rumbling from Magdalen.</p><p>Why hadn\u2019t she found some other way? she wondered, in an agony of embarrassment. Thou shalt not uncover they father\u2019s nak*dness. To invoke Jack Randall\u2019s name was to invoke the images of what he had done\u2014and that was not something she could bear even to think about. She should have asked her mother, let Claire ask him...but no. There hadn\u2019t been any choice, not really. She had to find out from him...</p><p>Her racing thoughts were interrupted by his words, calmly spoken.</p><p>\u201cWhy are ye asking, lass?\u201d</p><p>She jerked her head up, to find him watching her over his undrunk cider. He didn\u2019t look upset, and the jelly in her backbone stiffened a little. She clenched her fists on her knees to steady herself, and met his eyes, straight on.</p><p>\u201cI need to know whether it will help. I want to kill...him. The man who\u2014\u201d She made a vague gesture at her belly, and swallowed hard. \u201cBut if I do, and it doesn\u2019t help\u2014\u201d She couldn\u2019t go on.</p><p>He didn\u2019t seem shocked; abstracted, rather. He raised the cup to his mouth and took a sip, slowly.</p><p>\u201cMmphm. And will ye have killed a man before?\u201d He phrased it as a question, but she knew it wasn\u2019t. The muscle quivered near his mouth again\u2014with amusement, she thought, not shock\u2014and she felt a quick spurt of anger.</p><p>\u201cYou think I can\u2019t, don\u2019t you? I can. You\u2019d better believe me, I can!\u201d Her hands spread out, gripping her knees, broad and capable. She thought she could do it; though her image of how it might happen wavered. In cold blood, shooting seemed the best, perhaps the only certain way. But trying to imagine this, she had realized vividly the truth of the old saying \u201cShooting\u2019s too good for him.\u201d</p><p>It might be too good for Bonnet; it wouldn\u2019t be nearly good enough for her. In the night when she flung off her blankets, unable to bear even this slight weight and its reminder of restraint, she didn\u2019t just want him dead\u2014she wanted to kill him, purely and passionately\u2014kill him with her hands, taking back by the flesh what had been taken from her by that means.</p><p>And yet...what good would it be to murder him, if he would still haunt her? There was no way to know\u2014unless her father could tell her.</p><p>\u201cWill you tell me?\u201d she blurted. \u201cDid you kill him, finally\u2014and did it help?\u201d</p><p>He seemed to be thinking it over, his eyes traveling slowly over her, narrowed in assessment.</p><p>\u201cAnd what would be helped by your doing murder?\u201d he asked. \u201cIt willna take the child from your belly\u2014or give ye back your maidenheid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that!\u201d She felt her face flush hot, and turned away, irritated both with him and herself. They spoke of rape and murder, and she was embarrassed to have him mention her lost virginity? She forced herself to look back at him.</p><p>\u201cMama said you tried to kill Jack Randall in Paris, in a duel. What did you think you\u2019d get back?\u201d</p><p>He rubbed his chin hard, then drew in his breath through his nose and let it out slowly, eyes fixed on the stained rock of the ceiling.</p><p>\u201cI meant to take back my manhood,\u201d he said softly. \u201cMy honor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think my honor isn\u2019t worth taking back? Or do you figure it\u2019s the same thing as my maidenheid?\u201d She mocked his accent nastily.</p><p>Sharp blue eyes swung back to hers.</p><p>\u201cIs it the same thing to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it is not,\u201d she said, through clenched teeth.</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d he said, shortly.</p><p>\u201cThen answer me, damn it!\u201d She struck a fist on the straw, finding no satisfaction in the soundless blow. \u201cDid killing him give you back your honor? Did it help? Tell me the truth!\u201d</p><p>She stopped, breathing heavily. She glared at him, and he met her eyes with a cold stare. Then he raised the cup abruptly to his mouth, swallowed the cider in one gulp, and set the cup down on the hay beside him.</p><p>\u201cThe truth? The truth is that I dinna ken whether I killed him or no.\u201d</p><p>Her mouth dropped open in surprise.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know whether you killed him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI said so.\u201d A slight jerk of the shoulders betrayed his impatience. He stood up abruptly, as if unable to sit any longer.</p><p>\u201cHe died at Culloden, and I was there. I woke on the moor after the battle, with Randall\u2019s corpse on top of me. I ken that much\u2014and not much more.\u201d He paused as though thinking, then, mind made up, he thrust one knee forward, pulled up his kilt and nodded downward. \u201cLook.\u201d</p><p>It was an old scar, but no less impressive for its age. It ran up the inner side of his thigh, nearly a foot in length, its lower end starred and knotted like the head of a mace, the rest of it a cleaner line, though thick and twisted.</p><p>\u201cA bayonet, I expect,\u201d he said, looking at it dispassionately. He dropped the kilt, hiding the scar once more.</p><p>\u201cI remember the feel of the blade strikin\u2019 bone, and no more. Not what came after\u2014or before.\u201d</p><p>He took a deep, audible breath, and for the first time she realized that his apparent calmness was taking a good deal of effort to maintain.</p><p>\u201cI thought it a blessing\u2014that I couldna remember,\u201d he said at last. He wasn\u2019t looking at her, but into the shadows at the end of the stable. \u201cThere were gallant men who died there; men I loved well. If I didna know their deaths; if I couldna recall them or see them in my mind\u2014then I didna have to think of them as dead. Maybe that was cowardice, maybe not. Perhaps I chose not to remember that day; perhaps I cannot if I would.\u201d He looked down at her, his eyes gone softer, but then turned away, plaid swinging, not waiting for an answer.</p><p>\u201cAfterward\u2014aye, well. Vengeance didna seem important, then. There were a thousand dead men on that field, and I thought I should be one of them in hours. Jack Randall...\u201d He made an odd, impatient gesture, brushing aside the thought of Jack Randall as he might a biting deerfly. \u201cHe was one of them. I thought I could leave him to God. Then.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She took a deep breath, trying to keep her feelings under control. Curiosity and sympathy struggled with an overwhelming feeling of frustration.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re...all right, though. I mean\u2014in spite of what he\u2014did to you?\u201d</p><p>He gave her a look of exasperation, understanding mingled with half-angry amusement.</p><p>\u201cNot many die of it, lass. Not me. And not you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot yet.\u201d Involuntarily, she put a hand over her belly. She stared up at him. \u201cI guess we\u2019ll see in six months if I die of it.\u201d</p><p>That rattled him; she could see it. He blew out his breath and scowled at her.</p><p>\u201cYe\u2019ll do fine,\u201d he said curtly. \u201cYe\u2019re wider through the hip than yon wee heifer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike your mother? Everybody says how much I\u2019m like her. I guess she was wide through the hip, too, but it didn\u2019t save her, did it?\u201d</p><p>He flinched. Quick and sharp as though she\u2019d slapped him across the face with a stinging nettle. Perversely, seeing it filled her with panic, rather than the satisfaction she\u2019d expected.</p> <p>She understood then that his promise of protection was in good part illusion. He would kill for her, yes. Or willingly die himself, she had no doubt. He would\u2014if she let him\u2014avenge her honor, destroy her enemies. But he could not defend her from her own child; he was as powerless to save her from that threat as if she had never found him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll die,\u201d she said, cold certainty filling her belly like frozen mercury. \u201cI know I will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYe won\u2019t!\u201d He rounded on her fiercely, and she felt his hands bite into her upper arms. \u201cI will not let you!\u201d</p><p>She would have given anything to believe him. Her lips were numb and stiff, rage giving way to a cold despair.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t help,\u201d she said. \u201cYou can\u2019t do anything!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour mother can,\u201d he said, but sounded only half convinced. His grip slackened, and she wrenched herself free.</p> <p>\u201cNo, she can\u2019t\u2014not without a hospital, without drugs and things. If it\u2014if it goes wrong, all she can do is try to save the b-baby.\u201d Despite herself, her gaze flickered to his dirk, blade gleaming cold against the straw where he had left it.</p><p>Her knees felt watery, and she sat down suddenly. He snatched up the jug and slopped cider into a cup, pushing it under her nose.</p><p>\u201cDrink it,\u201d he said. \u201cDrink up, lass, you\u2019re pale as my sark.\u201d His hand was on the back of her head, urging her. She took a sip, but choked and drew back, waving him off. She drew a sleeve across her wet chin, wiping off the spilled cider.</p><p>\u201cYou know what\u2019s the worst? You said it wasn\u2019t my fault, but it is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is not!\u201d</p><p>She flapped a hand at him, bidding him be quiet.</p><p>\u201cYou talked about cowardice; you know what it is. Well, I was a coward. I should have fought, I shouldn\u2019t have let him...but I was scared of him. If I\u2019d been brave enough, this wouldn\u2019t have happened, but I wasn\u2019t, I was scared! And now I\u2019m even more scared,\u201d she said, voice breaking. She took a deep breath to steady herself, bracing her hands on the straw.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t help, and neither can Mama, and I can\u2019t do anything either. And Roger\u2014\u201d Her voice did crack then, and she bit her lip hard, forcing back tears.</p> <p>\u201cBrianna\u2014a leannan...\u201d He made a move to comfort her, but she drew back, arms folded tight across her stomach.</p><p>\u201cI keep thinking\u2014if I kill him, that\u2019s something I can do. It\u2019s the only thing I can do. If I\u2014if I have to die, at least I\u2019ll take him with me, and if I don\u2019t\u2014then maybe I can forget, if he\u2019s dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYe willna forget.\u201d The words were blunt and uncompromising as a blow to the stomach. He was still holding the cup of cider. Now he tilted back his head and drank, quite deliberately.</p><p>\u201cIt doesna matter, though,\u201d he said, setting down the cup with an air of businesslike finality. \u201cWe shall find you a husband, and once the babe\u2019s born, ye willna have much time to fret.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d She gaped at him. \u201cWhat do you mean, find me a husband?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll need one, aye?\u201d he said, in tones of mild surprise. \u201cThe bairn must have a father. And if ye willna tell me the name of the man who\u2019s given ye a swollen belly, so that I might make him do his duty by ye\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think I\u2019d marry the man who did this?\u201d Her voice cracked again, this time with astonishment.</p><p>His voice sharpened slightly.</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m thinkin\u2019\u2014are ye maybe playin\u2019 wi\u2019 the truth a bit, lass? Perhaps it wasna rape at all; perhaps it was that ye took a mislike to the man, and ran\u2014and made up the story later. Ye were not marked, after all. Hard to think a man could force a lass of your size, if ye were unwilling altogether.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think I\u2019m lying?\u201d</p><p>He raised one brow in cynicism. Furious, she swung a hand at him, but he caught her by the wrist.</p><p>\u201cAh, now,\u201d he said, reprovingly. \u201cYe\u2019re no the first lass to make a slip and try to hide it, but\u2014\u201d He caught the other wrist as she struck at him, and pulled them both up sharply.</p><p>\u201cYe dinna need to make such a fuss,\u201d he said. \u201cOr is it that ye wanted the man and he threw ye over? Is that it?\u201d</p><p>She swiveled in his grip, used her weight to swing aside, brought her knee up hard. He turned only slightly, and her knee collided with his thigh, not the vulnerable flesh between his legs she had been aiming for.</p><p>The blow must have bruised him, but didn\u2019t lessen his grip on her wrists in the least. She twisted, kicking, cursing her skirts. She hit his shin dead-on at least twice, but he only chuckled, as though finding her struggles funny.</p><p>\u201cIs that all ye can do, lassie?\u201d He broke his grip then, but only to shift both her wrists to one hand. The other prodded her playfully in the ribs.</p><p>\u201cThere was a man</p><p>In Muir of Skene,</p><p>He had dirks</p><p>And I had none;</p><p>But I fell on him</p><p>With my thumbs,</p><p>And wot you how,</p><p>I dirkit him,</p><p>Dirkit him,</p><p>Dirkit him?\u201d</p><p>With each repetition, he dug a thumb hard between her ribs.</p><p>\u201cYou f**king bastard!\u201d she screamed. She braced her feet and yanked down on his arm as hard as she could, bringing it into biting range. She lunged at his wrist, but before she could sink her teeth in his flesh, she found herself jerked off her feet and whirled through the air.</p><p>She ended hard on her knees, one arm twisted up behind her back so tightly that her shoulder joint cracked. The strain on her elbow hurt; she writhed, trying to turn into the hold, but couldn\u2019t budge. An arm like an iron bar clamped across her shoulders, forcing her head down. And farther down.</p><p>Her chin drove into her chest; she couldn\u2019t breathe. And still he forced her head down. Her knees slid apart, her thighs forced wide by the downward pressure.</p><p>\u201cStop!\u201d she grunted. It hurt to force sound through her constricted windpipe. \u201cGd\u2019s sk, stp!\u201d</p><p>The relentless pressure paused, but did not ease. She could feel him there behind her, an inexorable, inexplicable force. She reached back with her free hand, groping for something to claw, something to hit or bend, but there was nothing.</p><p>\u201cI could break your neck,\u201d he said, very quietly. The weight of his arm left her shoulders, though the twisted arm still held her bent forward, hair loose and tumbled, nearly touching the floor. A hand settled on her neck. She could feel thumb and index fingers on either side, pressing lightly on her arteries. He squeezed, and black spots danced before her eyes.</p><p>\u201cI could kill you, so.\u201d</p><p>The hand left her neck, and touched her, deliberately, knee and shoulder, cheek and chin, emphasizing her helplessness. She jerked her head away, not letting him touch the wetness, not wanting him to feel her tears of rage. Then the hand pressed sudden and brutal on the small of her back. She made a small, choked sound and arched her back to keep her arm from breaking, thrusting out her h*ps backward, legs spread to keep her balance.</p><p>\u201cI could use ye as I would,\u201d he said, and there was a coldness in his voice. \u201cCould you stop me, Brianna?\u201d</p><p>She felt as though she would suffocate with rage and shame.</p><p>\u201cAnswer me.\u201d The hand took her by the neck again, and squeezed.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d</p><p>She was free. So suddenly released, she pitched forward onto her face, barely getting one hand down in time to save herself.</p><p>She lay on the straw, panting and sobbing. There was a loud whuffle near her head\u2014Magdalen, roused by the noise, leaning out of her stall to investigate. Slowly, painfully, she raised herself to a sitting position.</p><p>He was standing over her, arms folded.</p><p>\u201cDamn you!\u201d she gasped. She slammed a hand down in the hay. \u201cGod, I want to kill you!\u201d</p><p>He stood quite still, looking down at her.</p><p>\u201cAye,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cBut ye can\u2019t, can you?\u201d</p><p>She stared up at him, not understanding. His eyes were intent on hers, not angry, not mocking. Waiting.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t,\u201d he repeated, with emphasis.</p><p>And then realization came, flooding down her aching arms to her bruised fists.</p><p>\u201cOh, God,\u201d she said. \u201cNo. I can\u2019t. I couldn\u2019t. Even if I\u2019d fought him...I couldn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Quite suddenly she began to cry, the knots inside her slipping loose, the weights shifting, lifting, as a blessed relief spread through her body. It hadn\u2019t been her fault. If she had fought with all her strength\u2014as she had fought just now\u2014</p><p>\u201cCouldn\u2019t,\u201d she said, and swallowed hard, gasping for air. \u201cI couldn\u2019t have stopped him. I kept thinking, if only I\u2019d fought harder...but it wouldn\u2019t have mattered. I couldn\u2019t have stopped him.\u201d</p><p>A hand touched her face, big and very gentle.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a fine, braw lassie,\u201d he whispered. \u201cBut a lassie, nonetheless. Would ye fret your heart out and think yourself a coward because ye couldna fight off a lion wi\u2019 your bare hands? It\u2019s the same. Dinna be daft, now.\u201d</p><p>She wiped the back of her hand under her nose, and sniffed deeply.</p><p>He put a hand under her elbow and helped her up, his strength no longer either threat or mockery, but unutterable comfort. Her knees stung, where she had scraped them on the ground. Her legs wobbled, but she made it to the haypile, where he let her sit down.</p><p>\u201cYou could just have told me, you know,\u201d she said. \u201cThat it wasn\u2019t my fault.\u201d</p><p>He smiled faintly.</p><p>\u201cI did. Ye couldna believe me, though, unless ye knew for yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I guess not.\u201d A profound but peaceful weariness had settled on her like a blanket. This time she had no urge to tear it off.</p><p>She watched, feeling too limp to move, as he wetted a cloth from the trough and wiped her face, straightened her twisted skirts, and poured out a drink for her.</p><p>When he handed her the freshly filled cup of cider, though, she laid a hand on his arm. Bone and muscle were solid, warm under her hand.</p><p>\u201cYou could have fought back. But you didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>He laid a big hand over hers, squeezed and let it go. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo, I didna fight,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cI gave my word\u2014for your mother\u2019s life.\u201d His eyes met hers squarely, neither ice nor sapphire now, but clear as water. \u201cI dinna regret it.\u201d</p><p>He took her by the shoulders, and eased her down onto the piled hay.</p><p>\u201cDo ye rest a bit, a leannan.\u201d</p><p>She lay down, but reached up to touch him as he knelt by her.</p> <p>\u201cIs it true\u2014that I won\u2019t forget?\u201d</p><p>He paused for a moment, hand on her hair.</p><p>\u201cAye, that\u2019s true,\u201d he said softly. \u201cBut it\u2019s true, too, that it willna matter after a time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWon\u2019t it?\u201d She was too tired even to wonder what he might mean by this. She felt almost weightless; strangely remote, as though she no longer inhabited her troublesome body. \u201cEven if I\u2019m not strong enough to kill him?\u201d</p><p>A clear cold draft from the open door cut through the warm fog of smoke, making all the animals stir. The brindled cow shifted her weight in sudden irritation and let out a low-throated mwaaah, not of distress so much as of querulous complaint.</p> <p>She felt her father glance at the cow before turning back to her.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a verra strong woman, a bheanachd,\u201d he said at last, very softly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not strong. You just proved I\u2019m not\u2014\u201d</p><p>His hand on her shoulder stopped her.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not what I mean.\u201d He stopped, thinking, his hand smoothing her hair, over and over.</p><p>\u201cShe was ten when our mother died, Jenny was,\u201d he said at last. \u201cIt was the day after the funeral when I came into the kitchen and found her kneeling on a stool, to be tall enough to stir the bowl on the table.</p> <p>\u201cShe was wearing my mother\u2019s apron,\u201d he said softly, \u201cfolded up under the arms, and the strings wrapped twice about her waist. I could see she\u2019d been weepin\u2019, like I had, for her face was all stained and her eyes red. But she just went on stirring, staring down into the bowl, and she said to me, \u2018Go and wash, Jamie; I\u2019ll have supper for you and Da directly.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>His eyes closed altogether, and he swallowed once. Then he opened them, and looked down at her again.</p><p>\u201cAye, I ken fine how strong women are,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cAnd you\u2019re strong enough for what must be done, m\u2019 annsachd\u2014believe me.\u201d</p><p>He stood up then, and went to the cow. It had risen to its feet and was moving restlessly in a small circle, swaying and shuffling on its tether. He caught it by the tether rope, gentled it with hands and words, made his way behind the heifer, frowning in concentration. She saw him turn his head and look, to check his dirk, then turn back, murmuring.</p><p>Not a loving butcher, no. A surgeon in his way, like her mother. From this odd plateau of remoteness, she could see how much her parents\u2014so wildly different in temperament and manner\u2014were alike in this one respect; that odd ability to mingle compassion with sheer ruthlessness.</p><p>But they were different even in that, she thought; Claire could hold life and death together in her hands, and yet preserve herself, hold aloof; a doctor must go on living, for the sake of her patients, if not for her own sake. Jamie would be ruthless toward himself, as much as\u2014or more than\u2014he would be to anyone else.</p><p>He had thrown off his plaid; now he unfastened his shirt, with no haste but neither with any wasted motion. He pulled the pale linen over his head and laid it neatly aside, returning to his watching post at the heifer\u2019s tail, ready to assist.</p><p>A long ripple ran down the cow\u2019s rounded side, and the torchlight glimmered white on the tiny knot of a scar over his heart. Uncover his nak*dness? He would strip himself to the bone, if he thought it necessary. And\u2014a much less comforting thought\u2014if he thought it necessary, he would do the same to her, without a moment\u2019s hesitation.</p> <p>He had a hand at the base of the cow\u2019s tail, speaking to it in Gaelic, soothing, encouraging. She felt as though she could almost grasp the sense of his words\u2014but not quite.</p><p>All might be well, or it might not. But whatever happened, Jamie Fraser would be there, fighting. It was a comfort.</p><p>Jamie paused by the upper fence of the cowpen, on the rise above the house. It was late, and he was more than tired, but his mind kept him wakeful. The calving completed, he had carried Brianna down to the cabin\u2014she sleeping sound as a babe in his arms\u2014and then gone out again, to seek relief in the solitude of the night.</p><p>His shins ached where she had kicked him, and there were deep bruises on his thighs; she was amazingly powerful for a woman. None of that troubled him in the least; in fact, he felt an odd and unexpected pride in this evidence of her strength. She will be all right, he thought. Surely she will.</p><p>There was more hope than confidence behind this thought. Yet it was on his own account that he was wakeful, and he felt at once troubled and foolish at the knowledge. He had thought himself thoroughly healed, old hurts so far behind him that they could safely be dismissed from mind. He had been wrong about that, and it unsettled him to find just how close to the surface the buried memories lay.</p><p>If he were to find rest tonight, they would have to be exhumed; the ghosts raised in order to lay them. Well, he had told the lass it took strength. He stopped, gripping the fence.</p><p>The rustle of night sounds faded slowly from his mind as he waited, listening for the voice. He had not heard it for years, had thought never to hear it again\u2014but he had already heard its echo once tonight; seen the blaze of anger\u2019s phantom in his daughter\u2019s eyes, and felt its flames singe his own heart.</p><p>Better to call it forth and face it boldly than let it lie in ambush. If he could not face his own demons, he could not conquer hers. He touched a bruise on his thigh, finding an odd comfort in the soreness.</p><p>No one dies of it, he\u2019d said. Not you; not me.</p><p>The voice did not come at first; for a moment he hoped it would not\u2014perhaps it had been long enough...but then it was there again, whispering in his ear as though it had never left, its insinuations a caress that burned his memory as once they had burned his skin.</p><p>\u201cGently at first,\u201d it breathed. \u201cSoftly. Tender as though you were my infant son. Gently, but for so long you will forget there was a time I did not own your body.\u201d</p><p>The night stood still around him, paused as time had paused so long before, poised on the edge of a gulf of dread, waiting. Waiting for the next words, known beforehand and expected, but nonetheless...</p><p>\u201cAnd then,\u201d the voice said, loving, \u201cthen I\u2019ll hurt you very badly. And you will thank me, and ask for more.\u201d</p><p>He stood quite still, face turned upward to the stars. Fought back the surge of fury as it murmured in his ear, the pulse of memory in his blood. Then made himself surrender, let it come. He trembled with remembered helplessness, and clenched his teeth in rage\u2014but stared unblinking at the brightness of heaven overhead, invoking the names of the stars as the words of a prayer, abandoning himself to the vastness overhead as he sought to lose himself below.</p><p>Betelgeuse. Sirius. Orion. Antares. The sky is very large, and you are very small. Let the words wash through him, the voice and its memories pass over him, shivering his skin like the touch of a ghost, vanishing into darkness.</p><p>The Pleiades. Cassiopeia. Taurus. Heaven is wide, and you are very small. Dead, but none the less powerful for being dead. He spread his hands wide, gripping the fence\u2014those were powerful, too. Enough to beat a man to death, enough to choke out a life. But even death was not enough to loose the bands of rage.</p><p>With great effort, he let go. Turned his hands palm upward, in gesture of surrender. He reached beyond the stars, searching. The words formed themselves quietly in his mind, by habit, so quietly he was not aware of them until he found them echoed in a whisper on his lips.</p><p>\u201c \u2018...Forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>He breathed slowly, deeply. Seeking, struggling; struggling to let go. \u201c \u2018Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>Waited, in emptiness, in faith. And then grace came; the necessary vision; the memory of Jack Randall\u2019s face in Edinburgh, stricken to bare bone by the knowledge of his brother\u2019s death. And he felt once more the gift of pity, calm in its descent as the landing of a dove.</p><p>He closed his eyes, feeling the wounds bleed clean again as the succubus drew its claws from his heart.</p><p>He sighed, and turned his hands over, the rough wood of the fence comforting and solid under his palms. The demon was gone. He had been a man, Jack Randall; nothing more. And in the recognition of that common frail humanity, all power of past fear and pain vanished like smoke.</p><p>His shoulders slumped, relieved of their burden.</p><p>\u201cGo in peace,\u201d he whispered, to the dead man and himself. \u201cYou are forgiven.\u201d</p><p>The night sounds had returned; the cry of a hunting cat rose sharp on the air, and rotting leaves crunched soft underfoot as he made his way back toward the house. The oiled hide that covered the window glowed golden in the dark, with the flame of the candle he had left burning in the hope of Claire\u2019s return. His sanctuary.</p><p>He thought that he should perhaps have told Brianna all this, too\u2014but no. She couldn\u2019t understand what he had told her; he had had to show her, instead. How to tell her in words, then, what he had learned himself by pain and grace? That only by forgiveness could she forget\u2014and that forgiveness was not a single act, but a matter of constant practice.</p><p>Perhaps she would find such grace herself; perhaps this unknown Roger Wakefield could be her sanctuary, as Claire had been his. He found his natural jealousy of the man dissolved in a passionate wish that Wakefield could indeed give her what he himself could not. Pray God he would come soon; pray God he would prove a decent man.</p><p>In the meantime, there were other matters to be dealt with. He walked slowly down the hill, oblivious to the wind that blew the kilt about his knees and billowed through his shirt and plaid. Things must be done here; winter was coming, and he could not leave his women here alone with only Ian to hunt for them and defend them. He couldn\u2019t leave to search for Wakefield.</p><p>But if Wakefield did not come? Well, there were other ways; he would see Brianna and the child protected, one way or another. And at least his daughter was safe from the man who had harmed her. Permanently safe. He rubbed a hand across his face, smelling blood still on his skin from the calving.</p><p>Forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us. Yes, but what of those who trespass against the ones we love? He could not forgive on another\u2019s behalf\u2014and would not, if he could. But if not...how should he expect forgiveness in return?</p><p>Educated in the universities of Paris, confidant of kings and friend to philosophers, still he was a Highlander, born to blood and honor. The body of a warrior and the mind of a gentleman\u2014and the soul of a barbarian, he thought wryly, to whom neither God\u2019s nor mortal law stood more sacred than the ties of blood.</p><p>Yes, there was forgiveness; she must find a way to forgive the man, for her own sake. But he was a different matter.</p><p>\u201c \u2018Vengeance is mine, sayeth the Lord.\u2019 \u201d He whispered it to himself. Then he looked up, away from the safe small glow of hearth and home, to the flaming glory of the stars above. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThe hell it is,\u201d he said, aloud, shamed but defiant. It was ungrateful, he knew. And wrong, forbye. But there it was, and no use to lie either to God or to himself about it.</p><p>\u201cThe hell it is,\u201d he repeated, louder. \u201cAnd if I am damned for what I\u2019ve done\u2014then let it be! She is my daughter.\u201d</p><p>He stood still for a moment, looking up, but there was no answer from the stars. He nodded once, as though in reply, and went on down the hill, the wind cold behind him.</p><p>49</p> <p>CHOICES</p><p>November 1769</p><p>I opened Daniel Rawlings\u2019s box, and stared at the rows of bottles filled with the soft greens and browns of powdered root and leaf, the clear gold of distillations. There was nothing among the bottles to help. Very slowly, I lifted the covering that lay over the top compartment, over the blades.</p><p>I lifted out the scalpel with the curved edge, tasting cold metal in the back of my throat. It was a beautiful tool, sharp and sturdy, well balanced, part of my hand when I chose it to be. I balanced it on the end of my finger, letting it tilt gently back and forth.</p><p>I set it down, and picked up the long, thick root that lay on the table. Part of the stem was still attached, the remnants of leaves hanging limp and yellow. Only one. I had searched the woods for nearly two weeks, but it was so late in the year that the leaves of the smaller herbs had yellowed and fallen; it was impossible to recognize plants that were no more than brown sticks. I had found this one in a sheltered spot, a few of the distinctive fruits still clinging to its stalk. Blue cohosh, I was sure. But only one. It wasn\u2019t enough.</p> <p>I had none of the European herbs, no hellebore, no wormwood. I could perhaps get wormwood, though with some difficulty; it was used to flavor absinthe.</p><p>\u201cAnd who makes absinthe in the backwoods of North Carolina?\u201d I said aloud, picking up the scalpel again.</p><p>\u201cNo one that I know of.\u201d</p><p>I jumped, and the blade jabbed deep into the side of my thumb. Blood spattered across the tabletop, and I snatched the corner of my apron, wadding the cloth hard against the wound in reflex.</p><p>\u201cChrist, Sassenach! Are ye all right? I didna mean to startle ye.\u201d</p><p>It didn\u2019t hurt a great deal yet, but the shock of sudden injury made me bite my lower lip. Looking worried, Jamie took my wrist and lifted the edge of the wadded cloth. Blood promptly welled from the cut and ran down my hand, and he clamped the cloth back in place, squeezing tight.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right; just a cut. Where did you come from? I thought you were up at the still.\u201d I felt surprisingly shaky, perhaps from the shock.</p><p>\u201cI was. The mash isna ready for distilling yet. You\u2019re bleeding like a pig, Sassenach. Are ye sure you\u2019re all right?\u201d I was bleeding badly; besides the splashes of blood across the table, the corner of my apron was soaked with dark red.</p><p>\u201cYes. I probably severed a tiny vein. It\u2019s not an artery, though; it will stop. Hold my hand up, will you?\u201d I fumbled one-handed with the strings of my apron, seeking to free it. Jamie undid it with a quick yank, wrapped the apron round my hand, and held the whole clumsy bundle up over my head.</p><p>\u201cWhat were ye doing with your wee knife?\u201d he asked, eyeing the dropped scalpel, where it lay alongside the twisted cohosh root.</p><p>\u201cAh...I was going to slice up that root,\u201d I said, waving weakly at it.</p><p>He gave me a sharp look, glanced across to the sideboard, where my paring knife lay in plain sight, then looked back at me with raised brows.</p><p>\u201cAye? I\u2019ve never seen ye use one of these\u201d\u2014he nodded at the open array of scalpels and surgical blades\u2014\u201csave on people.\u201d</p><p>My hand twitched slightly in his, and he tightened his grip on my thumb, squeezing hard enough to make me catch my breath in pain. He loosened his grip, then looked intently into my face, frowning.</p> <p>\u201cWhat in heaven\u2019s name are ye about, Sassenach? Ye look as though I\u2019d surprised ye about to commit murder.\u201d</p><p>My lips felt stiff and bloodless. I pulled my thumb out of his grasp and sat down, holding the wounded digit against my bosom with my other hand.</p><p>\u201cI was...deciding,\u201d I said, with great reluctance. It was no good to lie; he would have to know, sooner or later, if Bree\u2014</p><p>\u201cDeciding what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout Bree. What was the best way to do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo do it?\u201d His eyebrows shot up. He glanced at the open medicine case, then at the scalpel, and a look of sudden shocked comprehension washed over his face.</p><p>\u201cYou mean to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf she wants me to.\u201d I touched the knife, its small blade stained with my own blood. \u201cThere are herbs\u2014or this. There are awful risks to using herbs\u2014convulsions, brain damage, hemorrhage\u2014but it doesn\u2019t matter; I don\u2019t have enough of the right kind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cClaire\u2014have you done it before?\u201d</p><p>I looked up, to see him looking down at me with something I had never seen in his eyes before\u2014horror. I pressed my hands flat on the table, to stop them trembling. I didn\u2019t do as well with my voice.</p><p>\u201cWould it make a difference to you if I had?\u201d</p><p>He stared at me for a moment, then eased himself down on the bench opposite, slowly, as though afraid he might break something.</p><p>\u201cYe havena done it,\u201d he said softly. \u201cI know it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I said. I stared down at his hand, covering mine. \u201cNo, I haven\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>I could feel the tension go out of his hand; it relaxed, curling over mine, enfolding it. But my own lay limp in his grasp.</p><p>\u201cI knew ye couldna do murder,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI could. I have.\u201d I didn\u2019t look up at him, but spoke to the tabletop. \u201cI killed a man, a patient in my care. I told you about Graham Menzies.\u201d</p><p>He was silent for a moment, but held on to my hand, squeezing slightly.</p><p>\u201cI think it isna the same,\u201d he said at last. \u201cTo ease a doomed man to a death he wishes...it seems to me that that is mercy, not murder. And duty, too, perhaps.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDuty?\u201d That did make me look at him, startled. The look of shock had faded from his eyes, though he was still solemn.</p><p>\u201cDo ye not recall Falkirk Hill, and the night Rupert died in the chapel there?\u201d</p><p>I nodded. It wasn\u2019t something easily forgotten\u2014the cold dark of the tiny church, the eerie sounds of pipes and battle far outside. Inside the black air thick with the sweat of frightened men, and Rupert dying slowly on the floor at my feet, choking on his blood. He had asked Dougal MacKenzie, as his friend and his chief, to hasten him...and Dougal had.</p><p>\u201cIt will be a doctor\u2019s duty, too, I think,\u201d Jamie said gently. \u201cIf you are sworn to heal\u2014but cannot\u2014and to save men pain\u2014and can?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d I took a deep breath and curled my hand around the scalpel. \u201cI am sworn\u2014and by more than a doctor\u2019s oath. Jamie, she\u2019s my daughter. I would rather do anything in the world but this\u2014anything.\u201d I looked up at him and blinked, holding back tears.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you think I haven\u2019t thought about it? That I don\u2019t know what the risks are? Jamie, I could kill her!\u201d I pulled the cloth off my wounded thumb; the cut was still oozing.</p><p>\u201cLook\u2014it shouldn\u2019t bleed like that, it\u2019s a deep cut but not a bad one. But it does! I hit a vein. I could do the same to Bree and never know it, until she began to bleed\u2014and if so...Jamie, I couldn\u2019t stop it! She\u2019d bleed to death under my hand, and there isn\u2019t a thing I could do about it, not a thing!\u201d</p><p>He looked at me, eyes dark with shock.</p><p>\u201cHow could ye think of doing such a thing, knowing that?\u201d His voice was soft with disbelief.</p><p>I drew a deep, trembling breath, and felt despair wash over me. There was no way to make him understand, no way.</p><p>\u201cBecause I know other things,\u201d I said at last, very softly, not looking at him. \u201cI know what it is to bear a child. I know what it is to have your body and your mind and your soul taken from you and changed without your will. I know what it is to be ripped out of the place you thought was yours, to have choice taken from you. I know what it is, do you hear me? and it isn\u2019t something anyone should do without being willing.\u201d I looked up at him, and my fist clenched hard on my wounded thumb.</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2014for God\u2019s sake\u2014you know what I don\u2019t; what it\u2019s like to live with the knowledge of violation. Do you mean to tell me that if I could have cut that from you after Wentworth, that you wouldn\u2019t have had me do it, no matter what the risks? Jamie, that may be a rapist\u2019s child!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, I know,\u201d he began, and had to stop, too choked to finish. \u201cI know,\u201d he began again, and his jaw muscles bulged as he forced the words. \u201cBut I know the one thing else\u2014if I dinna ken his father, I ken his grandsire well enough. Claire, that is a child of my blood!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour blood?\u201d I echoed. I stared at him, the truth dawning on me. \u201cYou want a grandchild badly enough to sacrifice your daughter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSacrifice? It isna me that\u2019s meaning to commit slaughter in cold blood!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t mind the angel-makers at the H\u00f4pital des Anges; you had pity for the women they helped, you said so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThose women had nay choice!\u201d Too agitated to sit, he got up and paced restlessly back and forth in front of me. \u201cThey had no one to protect them, no way to feed a child\u2014what else could they do, poor creatures? But it isna so, for Brianna! I will never let her be hungry or cold, never let aught harm her or the bairn, never!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat isn\u2019t all there is to it!\u201d</p><p>He stared at me, brows drawn down in stubborn incomprehension.</p><p>\u201cIf she bears a child here, she won\u2019t leave,\u201d I said unsteadily. \u201cShe can\u2019t\u2014not without tearing herself apart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you mean to tear her apart?\u201d I flinched, as though he\u2019d struck me.</p><p>\u201cYou want her to stay,\u201d I said, striking back. \u201cYou don\u2019t care that she has a life somewhere else, that she wants to go back. If she\u2019ll stay\u2014and better yet, if she\u2019ll give you a grandchild\u2014then you bloody don\u2019t care what it does to her, do you?\u201d</p><p>It was his turn to flinch, but he turned on me squarely.</p><p>\u201cAye, I care! That doesna mean I think it right for you to force her into\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean, force her?\u201d The blood was burning hot in my cheeks. \u201cFor God\u2019s sake, you think I want to do this? No! But, by God, she\u2019ll have the choice if she wants it!\u201d</p><p>I had to press my hands together to stop them shaking. The apron had fallen to the floor, stained with blood, reminding me much too vividly of operating theaters and battlefields\u2014and of the terrible limits of my own skill.</p><p>I could feel his eyes on me, narrowed and burning. I knew that he was as torn in the matter as I was. He did indeed care desperately for Bree\u2014but now I had spoken the truth, we both recognized it; deprived of his own children, living for so long as an exile, there was nothing he wanted more in life than a child of his blood.</p><p>But he couldn\u2019t stop me, and he knew it. He wasn\u2019t used to feeling helpless, and he didn\u2019t like it. He turned abruptly and went to the sideboard, where he stood, fists resting on top of it. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I had never felt so desolate, so in need of his understanding. Did he not realize how horrible the prospect was for me, as well as him? Worse, because it was my hand that must do the damage.</p><p>I came up behind him, and laid a hand on his back. He stood unmoving, and I stroked him lightly, taking some comfort from the simple fact of his presence, of the solid strength of him.</p><p>\u201cJamie.\u201d My thumb left a slight smear of red on the linen of his shirt. \u201cIt will be all right. I\u2019m sure it will.\u201d I was talking to convince myself, as much as him. He didn\u2019t move, and I ventured to put my arm around his waist, laying my cheek against the curve of his back. I wanted him to turn and take me in his arms, to assure me that it would indeed somehow be all right\u2014or at the least, that he would not blame me for whatever happened.</p><p>He moved abruptly, dislodging my hand.</p> <p>\u201cYe\u2019ve a high opinion of your power, have ye no?\u201d He spoke coldly, turning to face me.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean by that?\u201d</p><p>He grasped my wrist in one hand, pinning it to the wall above my head. I could feel the tickle of blood down my wrist, flowing from my wounded thumb. His fingers wrapped around my hand, squeezing tight.</p><p>\u201cYe think it\u2019s yours alone to say? That life and death is yours?\u201d I could feel the small bones of my hand grind together, and I stiffened, trying to pull free.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not mine to say! But if she says\u2014then yes, it\u2019s my power. And yes, I\u2019ll use it. Just like you would\u2014like you have, when you\u2019ve had to.\u201d I shut my eyes, fighting down fear. He wouldn\u2019t hurt me...surely? It occurred to me with a small shock that he could indeed stop me. If he broke my hand...</p> <p>Very slowly, he bent his head and rested his forehead against mine.</p><p>\u201cLook at me, Claire,\u201d he said, very quietly.</p><p>Slowly, I opened my eyes and looked. His eyes were no more than an inch away; I could see the tiny gold flecks near the center of his iris, the black ring surrounding it. My fingers in his were slippery with blood.</p><p>He let go of my hand, and touched my breast lightly, cupping it for a moment.</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d he whispered, and then was gone.</p><p>I stood quite still against the wall, and then slowly slid to the floor in a bloom of skirts, the cut on my thumb throbbing with my heartbeat.</p> <p>I was so shaken by the quarrel with Jamie that I couldn\u2019t settle to anything. At last, I put on my cloak and went out, walking up the ridge. I avoided the path that led across the Ridge toward Fergus\u2019s cabin, and down toward the road. I didn\u2019t want to risk meeting anyone at all.</p><p>It was cold and cloudy, with a light rain sputtering intermittently among the leaf-bare branches. The air was heavy with cold moisture; let the temperature drop a few degrees more, and it would snow. If not tonight, tomorrow\u2014or next week. Within a month at the most, the Ridge would be cut off from the lowlands.</p><p>Ought I to take Brianna to Cross Creek? Whether she decided to bear the child or not, might she be safer there?</p><p>I shuffled through layers of wet, yellow leaves. No. My impulse was to think that civilization must offer some advantage, but not in this case. There was nothing Cross Creek could offer that would truly be of help in case of any obstetrical emergency; in fact, she might well be in active danger from the medical practitioners of the time.</p><p>No, whatever she decided, she was better off here, with me. I wrapped my arms about myself under my cloak, and flexed my fingers, trying to work some warmth and suppleness into them, to feel some sense of surety in touch.</p><p>Please, he\u2019d said. Please what? Please don\u2019t ask her, please don\u2019t do it if she asks? But I had to. I swear by Apollo the physician...not to cut for the stone, nor to procure abortion...Well, and Hippocrates was neither a surgeon, a woman...nor a mother. As I\u2019d told Jamie, I\u2019d sworn by something a lot older than Apollo the physician\u2014and that oath was in blood.</p><p>I never had done an abortion though I had had some experience as a resident, in the post-care of miscarriage. On the rare occasions a patient had asked it of me, I had referred them to a colleague. I had no absolute objection; I had seen too many women killed in body or spirit by untimely children. If it was killing\u2014and it was\u2014then I thought it not murder, but a justifiable homicide, undertaken in desperate self-defense.</p><p>At the same time, I could not bring myself to do it. The surgeon\u2019s sense that gave me knowledge of the flesh under my hands gave me also an acute awareness for the living contents of the womb. I could touch a pregnant woman\u2019s belly, and feel in my fingertips the second beating heart; could trace unseeing the curve of limb and head, and the snakelike curl of the umbilicus with its rush of blood, all red and blue.</p> <p>I could not bring myself to destroy it. Not until now; when it was a matter of killing my own flesh and blood.</p><p>How? It would have to be surgical. Dr. Rawlings had evidently not done such procedures; he had no uterine \u201cspoon\u201d for scraping the womb, nor any of the slender rods for dilation of the cervix. I could manage, though. One of the ivory knitting needles, its point blunted; the scalpel, bent to a shallow curve, its deadly edge sanded down for the delicate\u2014but no less deadly\u2014job of scraping.</p><p>When? Now. She was already three months gone; if it was to be done, it must be as soon as possible. Neither could I bear to be in the same room with Jamie while the matter was unresolved, feeling his anguish added to my own.</p><p>Brianna had taken Lizzie to Fergus\u2019s house. Lizzie was to stay and help Marsali, who had her hands full with the distillery, little Germaine, and the farm work that Fergus couldn\u2019t manage single-handed. It was a terrible load for an eighteen-year-old girl to be carrying, but she managed, with tenacity and style. Lizzie could at least help with the household chores, and mind the little fiend long enough to let his mother rest now and then.</p><p>Brianna would come back before suppertime. Ian was away, hunting with Rollo. Jamie...without being told, I knew that Jamie would not be back for some time. We would have a little while alone.</p><p>Would it be a suitable moment to ask her such a question, though\u2014fresh from seeing Germaine\u2019s cherubic face? Though on reflection, exposure to a two-year-old boy was probably the best possible object lesson in the dangers of motherhood, I thought wryly.</p><p>Vaguely lightened by the faint whiff of humor, I turned back, drawing my cloak around me against the increasing wind. As I came down the hill I saw Brianna\u2019s horse in the penfold; she was home. My stomach clenched in dread, I went to lay the choice before her.</p><p>\u201cI thought of it,\u201d she said, with a deep breath. \u201cAs soon as I realized. I wondered if you could do\u2014something like that, here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be easy. It would be dangerous\u2014and it would hurt. I don\u2019t even have any laudanum; only whisky. But yes, I can do it\u2014if you want me to.\u201d I forced myself to sit still, watching her pace slowly back and forth before the hearth, hands folded behind her in thought.</p><p>\u201cIt would have to be surgical,\u201d I said, unable to keep quiet. \u201cI don\u2019t have the right herbs\u2014and they aren\u2019t always reliable, in any case. At least surgery is...certain.\u201d I laid the scalpel on the table; she should not be under any illusions as to what I was suggesting. She nodded at my words, but didn\u2019t stop her pacing. Like Jamie, she always thought better while moving.</p><p>A trickle of sweat ran down my back, and I shivered. The fire was warm enough, but my fingers were still cold as ice. Christ, if she wanted it, would I even be able to do it? My hands had begun to tremble, with the strain of waiting.</p><p>She turned at last to look at me, eyes clear and appraising under thick, ruddy brows.</p><p>\u201cWould you have done it? If you could?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I could\u2014?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said once that you hated me, when you were pregnant. If you could have not been\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod, not you!\u201d I blurted, horror-stricken. \u201cNot you, ever. It\u2014\u201d I knotted my hands together, to still their trembling. \u201cNo,\u201d I said, as positively as I could. \u201cNever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did say so,\u201d she said, looking at me intently. \u201cWhen you told me about Da.\u201d</p><p>I rubbed a hand across my face, trying to focus my thoughts. Yes, I had told her that. Idiot.</p><p>\u201cIt was a horrible time. Terrible. We were starving, it was war\u2014the world was coming apart at the seams.\u201d Wasn\u2019t hers? \u201cAt the time, it seemed as though there was no hope; I had to leave Jamie, and the thought drove almost everything else out of my mind. But there was one other thing,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cWhat was that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t rape,\u201d I said softly, meeting her eyes. \u201cI loved your father.\u201d</p><p>She nodded, her face a little pale.</p><p>\u201cYes. But it might be Roger\u2019s. You did say that, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. It might. Is the possibility enough for you?\u201d</p><p>She laid a hand over her stomach, long fingers gently curved.</p><p>\u201cYeah. Well. It isn\u2019t an it, to me. I don\u2019t know who it is, but\u2014\u201d She stopped suddenly and glanced at me, looking suddenly shy.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know if this sounds\u2014well...\u201d She shrugged abruptly, dismissing doubt. \u201cI had this sharp pain that woke me up in the middle of the night, a few days...after. Quick, like somebody had stabbed me with a hatpin, but deep.\u201d Her fingers curled inward, her fist pressing just above her pubic bone, on the right side.</p><p>\u201cImplantation,\u201d I said softly. \u201cWhen the zygote takes root in the womb.\u201d When that first, eternal link is formed between mother and child. When the small blind entity, unique in its union of egg and sperm, comes to anchor from the perilous voyage of beginning, home from its brief, free-floating existence in the body, and settles to its busy work of division, drawing sustenance from the flesh in which it embeds itself, in a connection that belongs to neither side, but to both. That link, which cannot be severed, either by birth or by death.</p><p>She nodded. \u201cIt was the strangest feeling. I was still half asleep, but I...well, I just knew all of a sudden that I wasn\u2019t alone.\u201d Her lips curved in a faint smile, reminiscent of wonder. \u201cAnd I said to...it...\u201d Her eyes rested on mine, still lit by the smile, \u201cI said, \u2018Oh, it\u2019s you.\u2019 And then I went back to sleep.\u201d</p><p>Her other hand crossed the first, a barricade across her belly.</p><p>\u201cI thought it was a dream. That was a long time before I knew. But I remember. It wasn\u2019t a dream. I remember.\u201d</p><p>I remembered, too.</p><p>I looked down and saw beneath my hands not the wooden tabletop nor gleaming blade, but the opal skin and perfect sleeping face of my first child, Faith, with slanted eyes that never opened on the light of earth.</p><p>Looked up into the same eyes, open now and filled with knowledge. I saw that baby, too, my second daughter, filled with bloody life, pink and crumpled, flushed with fury at the indignities of birth, so different from the calm stillness of the first\u2014and just as magnificent in her perfection.</p><p>Two miracles I had been given, carried beneath my heart, born of my body, held in my arms, separated from me and part of me forever. I knew much too well that neither death nor time nor distance ever altered such a bond\u2014because I had been altered by it, once and forever changed by that mysterious connection. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYes, I understand,\u201d I said. And then said, \u201cOh, but Bree!\u201d as the knowledge of what her decision would mean to her flooded in on me anew.</p><p>She was watching me, brows drawn down, lines of trouble in her face, and it occurred to me belatedly that she might take my exhortations as the expression of my own regrets.</p><p>Appalled at the thought that she might think I had not wanted her, or had ever wished she had not been, I dropped the blade and reached out across the table to her.</p><p>\u201cBree,\u201d I said, seized with panic at the thought. \u201cBrianna. I love you. Do you believe I love you?\u201d</p> <p>She nodded without speaking, and stretched out a hand toward me. I grasped it like a lifeline, like the cord that had once joined us.</p><p>She closed her eyes, and for the first time I saw the glitter of tears that clung to the delicate, thick curve of her lashes.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve always known that, Mama,\u201d she whispered. Her fingers tightened around mine; I saw her other hand press flat against her stomach. \u201cFrom the beginning.\u201d</p><p>50</p><p>IN WHICH ALL IS REVEALED</p> <p>By late November, the days as well as the nights were cold, and the rain clouds began to hang lower on the slopes above us. The weather unfortunately had no dampening effect on people\u2019s tempers; everyone was increasingly edgy, and for obvious reason: There was still no word of Roger Wakefield.</p><p>Brianna was still silent about the cause of their argument; in fact, she almost never referred to Roger anymore. She had made her decision; there was nothing to do but to wait, and let Roger make his\u2014if he hadn\u2019t already. Still, I could see fear warring with anger when she left her face unguarded\u2014and doubt hung over everyone like the clouds over the mountains.</p><p>Where was he? And what would happen when\u2014or if\u2014he finally appeared?</p><p>I took some respite from the prevailing mood of edginess by taking stock of the pantry. Winter was nearly here; the foraging was over, the garden harvested, the preserving done. The pantry shelves bulged with sacks of nuts, heaps of squash, rows of potatoes, jars of dried tomatoes, peaches, and apricots, bowls of dried mushrooms, wheels of cheese, and baskets of apples. Braids of onions and garlic and strings of dried fish hung from the ceiling; bags of flour and beans, barrels of salt beef and salt fish, and stone jars of sauerkraut stood on the floor.</p><p>I counted over my hoard like a squirrel reckoning nuts, and felt soothed by our abundance. No matter what else happened, we would neither starve nor go hungry.</p><p>Emerging from the pantry with a wedge of cheese in one hand and a bowl of dry beans in the other, I heard a tap on the door. Before I could call out, it opened and Ian\u2019s head poked in, cautiously surveying the room.</p> <p>\u201cBrianna\u2019s no here?\u201d he asked. As she clearly wasn\u2019t, he didn\u2019t wait for an answer but stepped in, trying to smooth back his hair.</p><p>\u201cHave ye a bit o\u2019 looking glass, Auntie?\u201d he asked. \u201cAnd maybe a comb?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, of course,\u201d I said. I set down the food, got my small mirror and the tortoiseshell comb from the drawer of the sideboy and handed them to him, peering upward at his gangling form.</p><p>His face seemed abnormally shiny, his lean cheeks blotched with red, as though he had not only shaved but had scrubbed the skin to the point of rawness. His hair, normally a thick, stubborn sheaf of soft brown, was now slicked straight back on the sides of his head with some kind of grease. Liberally pomaded with the same substance, it erupted in an untidy quiff over his forehead, making him look like a deranged porcupine.</p><p>\u201cWhat have you got on your hair, Ian?\u201d I asked. I sniffed at him and recoiled slightly at the result.</p><p>\u201cBear fat,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it stank a bit, so I mixed in a wee scoop of incense soap to make it smell better.\u201d He peered critically at himself in the mirror and made small jabs at his coiffure with the comb, which seemed pitifully inadequate to the task.</p><p>He was wearing his good coat, with a clean shirt and\u2014unheard of touch for a workday\u2014a clean, starched stock wrapped about his throat, looking tight enough to strangle him.</p><p>\u201cYou look very nice, Ian,\u201d I said, biting the inside of my cheek. \u201cUm...are you going somewhere special?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAye, well,\u201d he said awkwardly. \u201cIt\u2019s just if I\u2019m meant to be courting, like, I thought I must try to look decent.\u201d</p><p>Courting? I wondered at his haste. While he was certainly interested in girls\u2014and there were a few girls in the district who made no secret of returning his interest\u2014he was barely seventeen. Men did marry that young, of course, and Ian had both his own land and a share in the whisky making, but I hadn\u2019t thought his affections so strongly engaged yet.</p><p>\u201cI see,\u201d I said. \u201cAh...is the young lady anyone I know?\u201d He rubbed at his jaw, raising a red flush along the bone.</p><p>\u201cAye, well. It\u2019s\u2014it\u2019s Brianna.\u201d He wouldn\u2019t meet my eyes, but the flush rose slowly over his face.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I said incredulously. I set down the slice of bread I was holding and stared at him. \u201cDid you say Brianna?\u201d</p><p>His eyes were fixed on the floor, but his jaw was set stubbornly.</p><p>\u201cBrianna,\u201d he repeated. \u201cI\u2019ve come to make her a proposal of marriage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIan, you can\u2019t possibly mean that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do,\u201d he said, sticking out his long, square chin in a determined manner. He glanced toward the window, and shuffled his feet. \u201cWill she\u2014is she comin\u2019 in soon, d\u2019ye think?\u201d</p><p>The sharp scent of nervous perspiration reached me, mingled with soap and bear fat, and I saw that his hands were clenched in fists, tight enough to make the knobby knuckles stand out white against his tanned skin.</p><p>\u201cIan,\u201d I said, torn between exasperation and tenderness, \u201care you doing this because of Brianna\u2019s baby?\u201d</p><p>The whites of his eyes flashed as he glanced at me, startled. He nodded, shifting his shoulders uncomfortably inside the stiff coat.</p><p>\u201cAye, of course,\u201d he said, as though surprised that I should ask.</p><p>\u201cThen you\u2019re not in love with her?\u201d I knew the answer quite well, but thought we had better have it all out.</p><p>\u201cWell...no,\u201d he said, the painful blush renewing itself. \u201cBut I\u2019m no promised to anyone else,\u201d he hastened to add. \u201cSo that\u2019s all right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is not all right,\u201d I said firmly. \u201cIan, that\u2019s a very, very kind notion of yours, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, it\u2019s not mine,\u201d he interrupted, looking surprised. \u201cUncle Jamie thought of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe what?\u201d A loud, incredulous voice spoke behind me, and I whirled to find Brianna standing in the doorway, staring at Ian. She advanced slowly into the room, hands fisted at her sides. Just as slowly, Ian retreated, fetching up with a bump against the table.</p><p>\u201cCousin,\u201d he said, with a bob of his head that dislodged a spike of greased hair. He brushed at it, but it stuck out, hanging disreputably over one eye. \u201cI...ah...I...\u201d He saw the look on Brianna\u2019s face and promptly shut his eyes.</p><p>\u201cI-have-come-to-express-my-desire-to-ask-for-your-hand-in-the-blessed-sacrament-of-matrimony,\u201d he said in one breath. He took in another, with an audible gasp. \u201cI\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up!\u201d</p><p>Ian, his mouth opened to continue, immediately shut it. He opened one eye in a cautious slit, like one viewing a bomb momentarily expected to go off.</p><p>Bree glared from Ian to me. Even in the dim room, I could see the tight look of her mouth and the crimson rising in her cheeks. The tip of her nose was red, whether from the nippy air outside or from annoyance, I couldn\u2019t tell.</p><p>\u201cDid you know about this?\u201d she demanded of me.</p><p>\u201cOf course not!\u201d I said. \u201cFor heaven\u2019s sake, Bree\u2014\u201d Before I could finish, she had whirled on her heel and run out of the door. I could see the quick flash of her rusty skirts as she hurried up the slope leading to the stable.</p><p>I pulled off my apron and flung it hastily over the chair. \u201cI\u2019d better go after her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go, too,\u201d Ian offered, and I didn\u2019t stop him. Reinforcements might be needed.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think she\u2019ll do?\u201d he asked, panting in my wake as I hastened up the steep slope.</p><p>\u201cGod knows,\u201d I said. \u201cBut I\u2019m afraid we\u2019re going to find out.\u201d I was entirely too familiar with the look of a Fraser roused to fury. Neither Bree nor Jamie lost their temper easily, but when they did, they lost it thoroughly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad she didna strike me,\u201d Ian said thankfully. \u201cI thought for a moment she was going to.\u201d He pulled even with me, his long legs outstripping mine, hurrying though I was. I could hear uplifted voices from the open half-door of the stable.</p><p>\u201cWhy on earth would you put poor little Ian up to such a thing?\u201d Brianna was saying, her voice high with indignation. \u201cI\u2019ve never heard of such a high-handed, arrogant\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cPoor little Ian?\u201d Ian said, vastly affronted. \u201cWhat does she\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, high-handed, am I?\u201d Jamie\u2019s voice interrupted. He sounded both impatient and irritable, though not yet angry. Perhaps I was in time to avert full-scale hostilities. I peeked through the stable door, to see them face-to-face, glaring at each other over a large pile of half-dried manure.</p><p>\u201cAnd what better choice could I make, will ye tell me that?\u201d he demanded. \u201cLet me tell ye, lassie, I thought of every bachelor in fifty miles before I settled on Ian. I wouldna have ye wed to a cruel man or a drunkard, nor yet a poor man\u2014nor one auld enough to be your grandsire, either.\u201d</p><p>He shoved a hand through his hair, sure sign of mental agitation, but made a masterful effort to calm himself. He lowered his voice a bit, trying to be conciliatory.</p><p>\u201cWhy, I even put aside Tammas McDonald, for while he\u2019s a fine stretch of land and a good temper, and he\u2019s an age for you, he\u2019s a bittie wee fellow forbye, and I thought ye wouldna care to stand up side by side with him before a priest. Believe me, Brianna, I\u2019ve done my best to see ye well wed.\u201d</p><p>Bree wasn\u2019t having any; her own hair had come loose during her dash up the hill, and was floating round her face like the flames of a vengeful archangel.</p><p>\u201cAnd what makes you think I want to be married to anybody at all?\u201d</p><p>His mouth dropped open.</p><p>\u201cWant?\u201d he said incredulously. \u201cAnd what has want to do with it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverything!\u201d She stamped her foot.</p><p>\u201cNow there you\u2019re wrong, lassie,\u201d he advised her, turning to pick up his fork. He eyed her stomach with a nod. \u201cYou\u2019ve a bairn coming, who needs a name. Your time to be choosy is long since past, aye?\u201d</p><p>He dug his fork into the pile of manure and heaved the load into the waiting barrow, then dug again, with a smooth economy of motion born of years of labor.</p><p>\u201cNow, Ian\u2019s a sweet-tempered lad, and a hard worker,\u201d he said, eyes on his task. \u201cHe\u2019s got his own land; he\u2019ll have mine, too, in time, and that will\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am not going to marry anybody!\u201d Brianna drew herself up to her full height, fists balled at her sides, and spoke in a voice loud enough to disturb the bats in the corners of the ceiling. One small dark form detached itself from the shadows and flittered out into the gathering dusk, ignored by the combatants underneath. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWell, then, make your own choice,\u201d Jamie said shortly. \u201cAnd I wish ye well of it!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou...are...not...listening!\u201d Brianna said, grinding each word between her teeth. \u201cI\u2019ve made my choice. I said I won\u2019t...marry...anyone!\u201d She punctuated this with another stamp of her foot.</p><p>Jamie thrust the fork into the pile with a thump. He straightened up and eyed Brianna, rubbing his fist across his jaw.</p><p>\u201cAye, well. I seem to recall hearin\u2019 a verra similar opinion expressed by your mother\u2014the night before our wedding. I havena asked her lately does she regret bein\u2019 forced to wed me or not, but I flatter myself she\u2019s maybe not been miserable altogether. Perhaps ye should go and have a word wi\u2019 her?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not the same thing at all!\u201d Brianna snapped.</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s not,\u201d Jamie agreed, keeping a firm grip on his temper. The sun was low behind the hills, flooding the stable with a golden light in which the creeping tide of red in his skin was nonetheless quite visible. Still, he was making every attempt to be reasonable.</p><p>\u201cYour mother wed me to save her life\u2014and mine. It was a brave thing she did, and generous, too. I\u2019ll grant it\u2019s no a matter of life or death, but\u2014have ye no idea what it is to live branded as a wanton\u2014or as a fatherless bastard, come to that?\u201d</p><p>Seeing her expression falter slightly at this, he pressed his advantage, stretching out a hand to her and speaking kindly.</p><p>\u201cCome, lassie. Can ye not bring yourself to do it for the bairn\u2019s sake?\u201d</p> <p>Her face tightened again and she stepped back.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said, sounding strangled. \u201cNo. I can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>He dropped his hand. I could see them both, despite the fading light, and saw the danger signs all too clearly, in the narrowing of his eyes and the set of his shoulders, squared for battle. \u201cIs that how Frank Randall raised ye, lass, to have no regard for what\u2019s right or wrong?\u201d</p><p>Brianna was trembling all over, like a horse that\u2019s run too far.</p><p>\u201cMy father always did what was right for me! And he would never have tried to pull something like this!\u201d she said. \u201cNever! He cared about me!\u201d</p><p>At this, Jamie finally lost his temper, which went off with a bang.</p> <p>\u201cAnd I don\u2019t?\u201d he said. \u201cI am not trying my best to do what\u2019s right for ye? In spite of your being\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cJamie\u2014\u201d I turned toward him, saw his eyes gone black with anger, and turned toward her. \u201cBree\u2014I know he didn\u2019t\u2014you have to understand\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf all the reckless, thoughtless, selfish ways in which to behave!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou self-righteous, insensitive bastard!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBastard! Ye\u2019ll call me a bastard, and your belly swellin\u2019 like a pumpkin with a child that ye mean to doom to finger-pointing and calumny for all its days, and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnybody points a finger at my child, and I\u2019ll break it off and stuff it down their throat!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYe senseless wee besom! Have ye no the faintest notion o\u2019 how things are? Ye\u2019ll be a scandal and a hissing! Folk will call ye whore to your face!\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet them try it!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, let them try it? And ye mean me to stand by and listen, I suppose?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not your job to defend me!\u201d</p><p>He was so furious that his face went white as fresh-bleached muslin.</p><p>\u201cNot my job to defend you? For Christ\u2019s sake, woman, who else is meant to do it?\u201d</p><p>Ian tugged gently on my arm, drawing me back.</p><p>\u201cYe\u2019ve only the twa choices now, Auntie,\u201d he murmured in my ear. \u201cDouse them both wi\u2019 a pan o\u2019 cold water, or come away with me and leave them to it. I\u2019ve seen Uncle Jamie and my Mam go at it before. Believe me, ye dinna want to step between two Frasers wi\u2019 their dander up. My Da said he\u2019s tried once or twice, and got the scars to prove it.\u201d</p><p>I took a final glance at the situation and gave up. He was right; they were nose to nose, red hair bristling and eyes slitted like a couple of bobcats, circling, spitting and snarling. I could have set the hay on fire, and neither one would have spared an instant\u2019s notice.</p><p>It seemed remarkably quiet and peaceful outside. A whippoorwill sang in the aspen grove, and the wind was in the east, carrying the faint sounds of the waterfall to us. By the time we reached the dooryard, we couldn\u2019t hear the shouting anymore.</p><p>\u201cDinna be worrit, Auntie,\u201d Ian said comfortingly. \u201cThey\u2019ll get hungry, sooner or later.\u201d</p><p>In the event, it was unnecessary to starve them out; Jamie stamped down the hill a few minutes later and without a word, fetched his horse from the paddock, bridled him, mounted, and rode bareback at a gallop down the track toward Fergus\u2019s cabin. As I watched his departing form, Brianna stalked out of the stable, puffing like a steam engine, and made for the house.</p><p>\u201cWhat does nighean na galladh mean?\u201d she demanded, seeing me at the door.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d I said. I did, but thought it much more prudent not to say. \u201cI\u2019m sure he didn\u2019t mean it,\u201d I added. \u201cEr...whatever it means.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHa,\u201d she said, and with an angry snort, stomped into the house, reappearing moments later with the egg basket over her arm. Without a word, she disappeared into the bushes, making a rustling noise like a hurricane.</p><p>I took several deep breaths and went in to start supper, cursing Roger Wakefield.</p><p>Physical exertion seemed to have dissipated at least some of the negative energy in the household. Brianna spent an hour in the bushes, and returned with sixteen eggs and a calmer face. There were leaves and stickers in her hair, and from the look of her shoes, she had been kicking trees.</p><p>I didn\u2019t know what Jamie had been doing, but he returned at suppertime, sweaty and windblown but outwardly calm. They pointedly ignored each other, a reasonably difficult feat for two large persons confined in a twenty-foot-square log cabin. I glanced at Ian, who rolled his eyes skyward and came to help carry the big serving bowl to the table.</p><p>Conversation over supper was limited to requests to pass the salt, and afterward, Brianna cleared the dishes, then went to sit at the spinning wheel, working the foot treadle with unnecessary emphasis.</p><p>Jamie gave her back a glare, then jerked his head at me and went out. He was waiting on the path to the privy when I followed him a moment later.</p><p>\u201cWhat am I to do?\u201d he demanded, without preamble.</p><p>\u201cApologize,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cApologize?\u201d His hair seemed to be standing on end, though it was likely only the effects of the wind. \u201cBut I havena done anything wrong!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, what difference does that make?\u201d I said, exasperated. \u201cYou asked me what you should do, and I told you.\u201d</p><p>He exhaled strongly through his nose, hesitated a moment, then turned and stalked back into the house, shoulders set for martyrdom or battle.</p><p>\u201cI apologize,\u201d he said, looming up in front of her.</p><p>Surprised, she nearly dropped the yarn, but caught it adeptly.</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d she said, and flushed. She took her foot off the treadle, and the great wheel creaked and slowed.</p><p>\u201cI was wrong,\u201d he said, with a quick look at me. I nodded encouragingly, and he cleared his throat. \u201cI shouldna have\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right.\u201d She spoke quickly, eager to meet him. \u201cYou didn\u2019t\u2014I mean, you were only trying to help.\u201d She looked down at the thread, slowing as it ran through her fingers. \u201cI\u2019m sorry too\u2014I shouldn\u2019t have been mad at you.\u201d</p><p>He closed his eyes briefly and sighed, then opened them and lifted one eyebrow at me. I smiled faintly and turned back to my work, pounding fennel seeds in the mortar.</p><p>He pulled up a stool and sat down beside her, and she turned toward him, putting one hand on the wheel to stop it.</p><p>\u201cI know you meant well,\u201d she said. \u201cYou and Ian both. But don\u2019t you see, Da? I have to wait for Roger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut if something has happened to the man\u2014if he\u2019s met with an accident of some kind...\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe isn\u2019t dead. I know he isn\u2019t.\u201d She spoke with the fervency of someone who means to bend reality to her will. \u201cHe\u2019ll come back. And how would it be if he did, and found me married to Ian?\u201d</p><p>Ian looked up, hearing his name. He sat on the floor by the fire, Rollo\u2019s great head resting on his knee, his yellow wolf-eyes mere slits of pleasure as Ian methodically combed through the thick pelt, pulling out ticks and burs as he found them.</p><p>Jamie ran his fingers through his hair in a gesture of frustration.</p><p>\u201cI have had word out since ye told me of him, a nighean. I sent Ian to Cross Creek to leave word at River Run, and with Captain Freeman to pass to the other rivermen. I\u2019ve sent Duncan wi\u2019 word, all through the Cape Fear valley and as far north as Edenton and New Bern, and wi\u2019 the packet boats that run from Virginia to Charleston.\u201d</p><p>He looked at me, pleading for understanding. \u201cWhat more can I do? The man is nowhere to be found. If I thought there were the slightest chance\u2014\u201d He stopped, teeth set in his lip.</p><p>Brianna dropped her gaze to the yarn in her hand, and with a quick, sharp gesture, snapped it. Leaving the loose end to flap from the spindle, she got up and crossed the room, sitting down at the table with her back to us.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, lass,\u201d Jamie said, more quietly. He reached out and laid a hand on her shoulder, gingerly, as though she might bite him.</p><p>She stiffened slightly, but didn\u2019t pull away. After a moment, she reached up and took his hand, squeezing it lightly, then putting it aside.</p><p>\u201cI see,\u201d she said. \u201cThank you, Da.\u201d She sat, eyes fixed on the flames, her face and figure utterly still, but managing to radiate complete desolation. I put my hands on her shoulders, rubbing gently, but she felt like a wax manikin under my fingers\u2014not resisting but not acknowledging the touch.</p><p>Jamie studied her for a moment, frowning, and glanced at me. Then, with an air of decision, he got up, reached to the shelf, brought down his inkhorn and quill jar, and set them on the table with a clank.</p><p>\u201cHere\u2019s a thought,\u201d he said firmly. \u201cLet us draw up a broadsheet, here, and I will take it to Gillette in Wilmington. He can print it up, and Ian and the Lindsey lads will take the copies up and down the coast, from Charleston to Jamestown. It may be that someone\u2019s not kent Wakefield, not hearing his name, but they\u2019ll maybe know him by his looks.\u201d</p><p>He shook ink powder made of iron and oak gall into the stained half-gourd he used as a well, and poured a little water from the pitcher, using the shaft of a quill to stir the ink. He smiled at Brianna, and took a sheet of paper from the drawer.</p><p>\u201cNow, then, lass, how is this man of yours to look at?\u201d</p><p>The suggestion of action had brought a spark of life back to Brianna\u2019s face. She sat up straighter, and a current of energy flowed up her spine, into my fingers.</p><p>\u201cTall,\u201d she said. \u201cNearly as tall as you, Da. People would notice; they always look at you. He has black hair, and green eyes\u2014bright green; it\u2019s one of the first things you notice about him, isn\u2019t it, Mama?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Ian gave a small start, and looked up from his grooming.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I said, sitting down on the bench next to Brianna. \u201cBut you can maybe do better than just the written description. Bree\u2019s a good hand with a likeness,\u201d I explained to Jamie. \u201cCan you draw Roger from memory, do you think, Bree?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d She reached for the quill, eager to try. \u201cYes, I\u2019m sure I can\u2014I\u2019ve drawn him before.\u201d</p><p>Jamie surrendered the quill and paper, the vertical lines between his brows showing in a slight frown.</p> <p>\u201cCan the printer work from an ink sketch?\u201d I asked, seeing it.</p><p>\u201cOh\u2014aye, I expect so. It\u2019s no great matter to make a woodblock, if the lines are clear.\u201d He spoke abstractedly, eyes fixed on the paper in front of Brianna.</p><p>Ian pushed Rollo\u2019s head off his knee and came to stand by the table, looking over Bree\u2019s shoulder in what seemed a rather exaggerated curiosity.</p><p>Lower lip fixed between her teeth, she drew clean and swiftly. High forehead, with a thick lock of black hair that rose from an invisible cowlick, then dipped almost to the strongly marked black brows. She drew him in profile; a bold nose, not quite beaky, a clean-lined, sensitive mouth and a wide, slanted jaw. Thick-lashed eyes, deepset, with lines of good humor marking a strong, appealing face. She added a neat, flat ear, then turned her attention to the elegant curve of the skull, drawing thick, wavy dark hair pulled back in a short tail.</p><p>Ian made a small, strangled noise in his throat.</p> <p>\u201cAre you all right, Ian?\u201d I looked up at him, but he wasn\u2019t looking at the drawing\u2014he was looking across the table, at Jamie. He was wearing a glazed sort of expression, like a pig on a spit.</p><p>I turned, to find precisely the same expression on Jamie\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cWhat on earth is the matter?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cOh...nothing.\u201d The muscles of his throat moved in a convulsive swallow. The corner of his mouth twitched, and twitched again, as though he couldn\u2019t control it.</p><p>\u201cLike hell it is!\u201d Alarmed, I leaned across the table, seizing his wrist and groping for his pulse. \u201cJamie, what is it? Are you having chest pains? Do you feel ill?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do.\u201d Ian was leaning over the table, looking as though he might be going to throw up any minute. \u201cCoz\u2014d\u2019ye mean honestly to tell me that...this\u201d\u2014he gestured feebly at the sketch\u2014\u201cis Roger Wakefield?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said, looking up at him in puzzlement. \u201cIan, are you all right? Did you eat something funny?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t answer, but dropped heavily onto the bench beside her, put his head in his hands, and groaned.</p><p>Jamie gently detached his hand from my grip. Even in the red of the firelight, I could see that he was white and strained. The hand on the table curled around the quill jar, as though seeking support.</p><p>\u201cMr. Wakefield,\u201d he said carefully to Brianna. \u201cHas he by any chance...another name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Brianna and I said in unison. I stopped and let her explain as I rose and went hurriedly to fetch a bottle of brandy from the pantry. I didn\u2019t know what was going on, but had the horrible feeling that it was about to be called for.</p><p>\u201c\u2014adopted. MacKenzie was his own family name,\u201d she was saying as I emerged with the bottle in hand. She glanced from father to cousin, frowning. \u201cWhy? You haven\u2019t heard of a Roger MacKenzie, have you?\u201d</p><p>Jamie and Ian exchanged an appalled glance. Ian cleared his throat. So did Jamie.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Brianna demanded, leaning forward, glancing anxiously from one to the other. \u201cWhat is it? Have you seen him? Where?\u201d</p> <p>I saw Jamie\u2019s jaw tighten as he summoned up words.</p><p>\u201cAye,\u201d he said carefully. \u201cWe have. On the mountain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2014here? On this mountain?\u201d She stood up, pushing back the bench. Alarm and excitement played over her face like flames. \u201cWhere is he? What happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d Ian said defensively, \u201che did say as he\u2019d taken your maidenheid, after all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe WHAT?\u201d Brianna\u2019s eyes sprang open so far that a rim of white showed all around the iris.</p><p>\u201cWell, your Da asked him, just to be sure, and he admitted that he\u2019d\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou what?\u201d Brianna rounded on Jamie, clenched fists on the table.</p><p>\u201cAye, well. It\u2014was a mistake,\u201d Jamie said. He looked utterly wretched.</p><p>\u201cYou bet it was! What in the name of\u2014what have you done?\u201d Her own cheeks had blanched, and blue sparks glinted in her eyes, hot as the heart of a flame.</p><p>Jamie took a deep breath. He looked up, straight into her face, and set his jaw.</p><p>\u201cThe wee lassie,\u201d he said. \u201cLizzie. She told me that ye were with child, and that the man who\u2019d got it on ye was a wicked brute called MacKenzie.\u201d</p><p>Brianna\u2019s mouth opened and shut, but no words came out. Jamie looked at her steadily.</p><p>\u201cYe did say to me that ye\u2019d been violated, did ye no?\u201d</p><p>She nodded, jerky as a badly sprung puppet.</p><p>\u201cSo, then. Ian and the lassie were at the mill, when MacKenzie came askin\u2019 for ye. They rode to fetch me, and Ian and I met him in the clearing just above the green spring.\u201d</p><p>Brianna had got her voice working, though only barely.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you do to him?\u201d she asked hoarsely. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was a fair fight,\u201d Ian said, still defensive. \u201cI wanted to shoot him on sight, but Uncle Jamie said no, he meant to have his hands on the\u2014the man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou hit him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, I did!\u201d Jamie said, stung at last. \u201cFor God\u2019s sake, woman, what would ye have me do to the man who\u2019d used ye that way? It was you wanting to do murder, aye?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBesides, he hit Uncle Jamie, too,\u201d Ian put in helpfully. \u201cIt was a fair fight. I said.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe quiet, Ian, there\u2019s a good lad,\u201d I said. I poured two fingers, neat, and pushed the cup in front of Jamie.</p><p>\u201cBut it was\u2014he wasn\u2019t\u2014\u201d Brianna was sputtering, like a firecracker with a short fuse lit. Then she caught fire, and slammed one fist on the table, going off like a rocket.</p><p>\u201cWHAT HAVE YOU DONE WITH HIM?\u201d she screamed.</p><p>Jamie blinked and Ian flinched. They exchanged haunted glances.</p><p>I put a hand on Jamie\u2019s arm, squeezing tight. I couldn\u2019t keep the quaver out of my own voice as I asked the necessary question.</p><p>\u201cJamie\u2014did you kill him?\u201d</p><p>He glanced at me, and the tension in his face relaxed, if only marginally.</p><p>\u201cAh...no,\u201d he said. \u201cI gave him to the Iroquois.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOch, now, Coz, it could have been worse.\u201d Ian patted Brianna tentatively on the back. \u201cWe didna kill him, after all.\u201d</p><p>Brianna made a small choking sound, and pulled her head up off her knees. Her face was white and damp as the inside of an oyster shell, her hair in a tangle round it. She hadn\u2019t vomited or fainted, but looked as though she still might do either.</p><p>\u201cWe did mean to,\u201d Ian went on, looking at her a little nervously. \u201cI\u2019d my pistol pressed behind his ear, but then I thought it was really Uncle Jamie\u2019s right to blow his brains out, but then he\u2014\u201d</p><p>Brianna choked again, and I hastily placed an ashet on the table in front of her, just in case.</p><p>\u201cIan, I really think she doesn\u2019t need to hear this just now,\u201d I said, narrowing my eyes at him.</p><p>\u201cYes, I do.\u201d Brianna pushed herself upright, hands gripping the edge of the table. \u201cI have to hear it all, I have to.\u201d She turned her head slowly, as though her neck was stiff, toward Jamie.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d she said. \u201cWHY?\u201d</p><p>He was as white and ill-looking as she was. He had pushed away from the table and gone to the chimney corner, as though trying to get as far away as possible from the drawing, with its damning likeness of Roger MacKenzie Wakefield.</p><p>He looked as though he would have done anything rather than answer, but answer he did, his eyes steady on hers.</p><p>\u201cI meant to kill him. I stopped Ian because shooting the prick seemed too easy a death\u2014too quick for what he\u2019d done.\u201d He took a deep breath, and I could see that the hand gripping his writing shelf was clenched so tight that the knuckles stood out white against his skin.</p><p>\u201cI stopped to think, how it should be; what I must do. I left Ian with him, and I walked away.\u201d He swallowed; I could see the muscles move in his throat, but he didn\u2019t look away.</p><p>\u201cI walked into the forest a wee way, and leaned my back against a tree to let my heart slow. It seemed best he should be awake, to know\u2014but I didna think I could bear to hear him speak again. He\u2019d said too much already. But then I began to hear it, over again, what he\u2019d said.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? What did he say?\u201d Even her lips were white.</p><p>So were Jamie\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cHe said...that ye\u2019d asked him to your bed. That you\u2014\u201d He stopped and bit his lip, savagely.</p><p>\u201cHe said ye wanted him; that ye\u2019d asked him to take your maidenheid,\u201d Ian said. He spoke coolly, his eyes on Brianna.</p><p>She drew in breath with a ragged sound, like paper being torn.</p><p>\u201cI did.\u201d</p><p>I glanced involuntarily at Jamie. His eyes were closed, his teeth fixed in his lip.</p><p>Ian made a shocked sound, and Brianna drew back a hand like lightning and slapped him across the face.</p><p>He jerked back, lost his balance, and half fell off the bench. He grabbed the edge of the table and staggered to his feet.</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d he shouted, his face contorted in sudden anger. \u201cHow could ye do such a thing? I told Uncle Jamie that ye\u2019d never play the whore, never! But it\u2019s true, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>She was on her feet like a leopard, her cheeks gone from white to blazing fury in a second.</p><p>\u201cWell, damn you for a self-righteous prig, Ian! Who gave you the right to call me a whore?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight?\u201d He sputtered for a moment, at a loss for words. \u201cI\u2014you\u2014he\u2014\u201d</p><p>Before I could intervene, she drew back a fist and punched him hard in the pit of the stomach. With a look of intense surprise, he sat down hard on the floor, mouth open like a suckling pig.</p><p>I moved, but Jamie was faster. In less than a second he was beside her, gripping her arm. She whirled, meaning to hit him, too, I think, but then froze. Her mouth was working soundlessly, tears of shock and fury running down her cheeks.</p><p>\u201cBe still,\u201d he said, and his voice was very cold. I saw his fingers dig into her flesh, and I made a small sound of protest. He paid no attention, too intent on Brianna.</p><p>\u201cI didna want to believe it,\u201d he said, in a voice like ice. \u201cI told myself he was only saying so to save himself, it wasna true. But if it was\u2014\u201d He seemed to become aware at last that he was hurting her. He let go of her arm.</p><p>\u201cI couldna take the man\u2019s life, without being sure,\u201d he said, and paused, his eyes searching her face. For regret? I wondered. Or remorse? Whatever he might be looking for, all he found was a smoldering rage. Her face was the echo of his own, her blue eyes hot as his.</p><p>His own face changed, and he looked away. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI did regret it,\u201d he said, very quietly. \u201cWhen I came that night, and saw ye, I was sorry then that I hadna killed him. I held ye in my arms\u2014and I felt my heart go sma\u2019 wi\u2019 shame, that I should doubt my daughter\u2019s virtue.\u201d He looked down, and I could see the mark where he had bitten his lip.</p><p>\u201cNow my heart is shrunk altogether. Not only that ye should be impure but that ye should lie to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLie to you?\u201d Her voice was no more than whisper. \u201cLie to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, lie to me!\u201d With sudden violence, he turned back to her. \u201cThat ye should bed a man from lust, and cry rape when ye find ye\u2019re with child! Do ye not realize that it\u2019s only chance I have not the sin of murder on my soul, and you the cause of it?\u201d</p> <p>She was too furious to speak; I saw her throat swell with words, and knew I had to do something, at once, before either of them had the opportunity to say more.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t speak, either. Blindly, I fumbled in the pocket of my gown, feeling for the ring. I found it, pulled it out, and dropped it on the table. It chimed against the wood; spun, and rattled to a stop, the gold of the tiny circlet gleaming red in the firelight.</p><p>From F. to C. with love. Always.</p><p>Jamie looked at it, his face gone completely blank. Brianna drew in her breath with a sob.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s your ring, Auntie,\u201d Ian said. He sounded dazed, and bent close to look, as though he couldn\u2019t believe his eyes. \u201cYour gold ring. The one that Bonnet took from ye, on the river.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes,\u201d I said. My knees felt weak. I sat down at the table, and laid my hand over the telltale ring as though to take it back, deny its presence.</p><p>Jamie took my wrist and lifted it. Like a man handling a dangerous insect, he picked the ring up gingerly between thumb and forefinger.</p><p>\u201cWhere did ye get this?\u201d he asked, his voice almost casual. He looked at me, and a bolt of terror shot through me at the look in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cI brought it to her.\u201d Brianna\u2019s tears had dried, evaporated by the heat of her fury. She stood behind me and gripped me by the shoulders. \u201cDon\u2019t you look at her that way, don\u2019t you dare!\u201d</p><p>He shifted the look to her, but she didn\u2019t flinch; only held on to me harder, her fingers digging into my shoulders.</p><p>\u201cWhere did ye get it?\u201d he asked again, his voice no more than a whisper. \u201cWhere?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFrom him. From Stephen Bonnet.\u201d Her voice was shaking, but from rage, not fear. \u201cWhen...he...raped...me.\u201d</p><p>Jamie\u2019s face cracked suddenly, as though some explosion had burst him from within. I made an incoherent sound of distress, and reached out for him, but he whirled away and stood rigid, back turned to us, in the middle of the room.</p><p>I felt Brianna draw herself upright, heard Ian say, rather stupidly, \u201cBonnet?\u201d I heard the ticking of the clock on the sideboard, felt the draft from the door. I was dimly aware of all these things, but had no eyes for anything but Jamie.</p><p>I pushed back the bench, stumbled to my feet. He stood as though rooted into the floor, fists clenched into his belly like a man gut-shot, trying to hold back the inevitable fatal spill of his insides.</p><p>I should be able to do something, to say something. I should be able to help them, to take care of them. But I could do nothing. I could not help one without betraying the other\u2014had already betrayed them both. I had sold Jamie\u2019s honor to keep him safe, and the doing of it had taken Roger and destroyed Bree\u2019s happiness.</p><p>I could go to neither of them now. All I could do was to stand there, feeling my heart crumble into small, jagged chunks.</p><p>Bree left me, and walked quietly around the table, across the room, around Jamie. She stood in front of him, looking up into his face, her own set like marble, cold as a saint\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cDamn you,\u201d she said, scarcely audible. \u201cDamn you very much, you bastard. I\u2019m sorry I ever saw you.\u201d</p> <p>PART ELEVEN</p><p>Pas du Tout</p><p>51</p><p>BETRAYAL</p><p>October 1769</p><p>Roger opened his eyes and threw up. Or rather, down. It didn\u2019t matter; The burning rush of bile through his nose and the trickle of vomitus that ran into his hair were unimportant by comparison with the agony in head and groin.</p><p>A thumping swerve of movement jarred him, shooting kaleidoscopic colors from crotch to brain. A damp smell of canvas filled his nose. Then a voice spoke somewhere near, and formless panic took sudden, jagged shape among the colors.</p><p>Gloriana! They\u2019d got him! He lurched in reflex, brought up short by a searing jolt through his temples\u2014but brought up a split-second earlier by something round his wrists. Tied, he was tied up in the hold.</p><p>The shape of panic blew up bold and black against his mind. Bonnet. They\u2019d caught him, taken back the stones. And now they\u2019d kill him.</p><p>He jerked convulsively, yanking at his wrists, teeth clenched against the pain. The deck dropped beneath him with a startled snort, and he slammed down hard.</p><p>He vomited again, but his stomach was empty. He retched, ribs grating with each spasm against the canvas-wrapped bundles he lay across. Not sails; not a hold. Not the Gloriana, not a ship at all. A horse. He was tied hand and foot, belly down across a f**king horse!</p><p>The horse jolted on a few more steps, then stopped. Voices muttered, hands fumbled at him, then he was pulled off roughly and dropped on his feet. He fell down at once, unable either to stand or to break his fall.</p><p>He lay half doubled on the ground, concentrating on breathing. Without the jouncing, it was easier. Nobody troubled him, and gradually he began to be aware of his surroundings.</p><p>Awareness didn\u2019t help much. There were damp leaves under his cheek, cool and smelling of sweet rot. He cracked a cautious eye. Sky above, an impossible deep color, between blue and purple. The sound of trees, the rush of nearby water.</p><p>Everything seemed to be revolving slowly around him, painfully vivid. He closed his eyes and pressed his hands flat against the ground.</p><p>Jesus, where am I? The voices were talking casually, words half lost in the stamping and whickering of nearby horses. He listened intently but couldn\u2019t make out the words. He felt a moment\u2019s panic at the inability; he couldn\u2019t even put a name to the language.</p><p>There was a large, tender lump behind one ear, another on the back of his head, and a pain that made his temples throb; he\u2019d been hit hard\u2014but when? Had the blows ruptured vessels in his brain, deprived him of language? He opened his eyes all the way, and\u2014with infinite caution\u2014rolled onto his back.</p><p>A square brown face glanced down at him, with no particular expression of interest, then looked back to the horse the man was tending.</p><p>Indians. The shock was so great that he forgot momentarily about his pain, and sat up abruptly. He gasped and put his face on his knees, eyes closed as he fought to keep from passing out again, blood pounding through a splitting head.</p><p>Where was he? He bit his knee, grinding the cloth savagely between his teeth, fighting for memory. Fragments of images came back to him, in mocking bits that stubbornly refused to fit together into sense.</p><p>The creak of boards and the smell of bilges. Blinding sun through panes of glass. Bonnet\u2019s face, and the breathing of whales in the mist, and a little boy named...named...</p><p>Hands clasped in dark and the tang of hops. I thee wed, with my body I thee worship...</p><p>Bree. Brianna. Cold sweat rolled down his cheek and his jaw muscles ached with clenching. The images hopped around in his mind like fleas. Her face, her face, he must not let it go!</p><p>Not gentle, not a gentle face. A nose dead straight and cold blue eyes...no, not cold...</p><p>A hand on his shoulder yanked him from the tortured pursuit of memory into the all too immediate present. It was an Indian, knife in hand. Numb with confusion, Roger simply looked at the man.</p><p>The Indian, a middle-aged man with a bone in his roached hair, and an air of no-nonsense about him, took Roger by his own hair and tilted his head back and forth with a critical air. Confusion evaporated, as it occurred to Roger that he was about to be scalped as he sat there.</p><p>He flung himself backward and lashed out with his feet, catching the Indian in the knees. The man went down with a cry of surprise, and Roger rolled, lurching and stumbling to his feet, running for his life.</p><p>He ran like a drunken spider, spraddle-legged, staggering toward the trees. Shadows, refuge. There were shouts behind him, and the sound of quick feet scattering leaves. Then something jerked his feet from under him and he fell headlong with a bone-shaking thud.</p><p>They had him on his feet before he had his breath back. No good to struggle; there were four of them, including the one Roger had knocked down. That one came toward them, limping, still holding the knife.</p><p>\u201cNot hurt you!\u201d he said crossly. He slapped Roger briskly across the face, then leaned over and sawed through the leather thong that bound Roger\u2019s wrists. With a loud snort, he turned on his heel and went back to the horses.</p><p>The two men holding Roger promptly let go of him and walked off, too, leaving him swaying like a sapling in a high wind.</p><p>Great, he thought blankly, I\u2019m not dead. What the bloody hell?</p><p>No answer to this presenting itself, he rubbed a hand gingerly over his face, discovering several bruises he\u2019d missed earlier, and looked around.</p><p>He stood in a small clearing, surrounded by huge oaks and half-shed hickory trees; the ground was thick with brown and yellow leaves, and the squirrels had left heaps of acorn caps and nut hulls scattered over the ground. He stood on a mountain; the slope of the ground told him that, as the chill air and jewel-deep sky told him the time was near sunset.</p><p>The Indians\u2014there were four, all men\u2014ignored him completely, going about the business of camp-building without a glance in Roger\u2019s direction. He licked dry lips and took a cautious step toward the small stream that burbled over algae-furred rocks a few yards away.</p><p>He drank his fill, though the cold water made his teeth ache; nearly all the teeth were loose on one side of his mouth, and the lining of his cheek was badly cut. He rinsed his face gingerly, with a feeling of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu. Sometime earlier, he had washed and drunk like this, cold water running over emerald rocks...</p><p>Fraser\u2019s Ridge. He sat back on his heels, memory dropping back in place, in large, ugly chunks.</p><p>Brianna, and Claire...and Jamie Fraser. Suddenly the confusing image he had sought so desperately came back unbidden; Brianna\u2019s face, with its broad, clean bones, blue eyes set slantwise above a long, straight nose. But Brianna\u2019s face grown older, weathered to bronze, rough-cut and toughened by masculinity and experience, blue eyes gone black with a murderous rage. Jamie Fraser.</p><p>\u201cYou bloody sod,\u201d Roger said softly. \u201cYou bloody, f**king sod. You tried to kill me.\u201d</p><p>His initial feeling was one of astonishment\u2014but anger wasn\u2019t far behind.</p><p>He remembered everything now; the meeting in the clearing, the autumn leaves like fire and honey and the blazing man among them; the brown-haired youth\u2014and who the hell was he? The fight\u2014he touched a sore spot under his ribs with a grimace\u2014and the end of it, lying flat in the leaves, sure that he was about to be killed.</p><p>Well, he hadn\u2019t been. He had a dim memory of hearing the man and the boy arguing somewhere over him\u2014one of them had been for killing him on the spot, the other said no\u2014but damned if he knew which one. Then one of them had hit him again, and he remembered nothing more until now. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>And now\u2014he glanced around. The Indians had a fire going, and a clay pot sitting by it. None of them paid him the least attention, though he was sure they were all aware of him.</p><p>Perhaps they had taken him from Fraser and the boy\u2014why, though? More likely, Fraser had given him to the Indians. The man with the knife had said they didn\u2019t mean to hurt him. What did they mean to do with him?</p><p>He looked around. It would be night, soon; already, the distant shadows under the oaks had thickened.</p><p>So what, sport? If you slope off after dark, where\u2019re you going to? The only direction you know is down. The Indians were apparently ignoring him because they were confident that he wasn\u2019t going anywhere.</p> <p>Dismissing the uncomfortable truth of this observation, he stood up. First things first. It was the last thing he wanted to do at the moment, but his bladder was bursting. His fingers were slow and clumsy, congested with blood, but he managed to fumble loose the lacing of his breeches.</p><p>His first feeling was one of relief; it wasn\u2019t as bad as it felt. Very sore, but ginger prodding seemed to indicate that he was basically intact and unruptured.</p><p>It was only as he turned back toward the fire that simple relief was succeeded by a burst of rage so pure and blinding as to burn away both pain and fear. On his right wrist was a smudged black oval\u2014a thumbprint, clear and mocking as a signature.</p><p>\u201cChrist,\u201d he said, very softly. Fury burned hot and thick in the pit of his belly. He could taste it, sour in his mouth. He looked down the mountain-side behind him, not knowing whether he faced Fraser\u2019s Ridge or not.</p><p>\u201cWait for me, bugger,\u201d he said, under his breath. \u201cBoth of you\u2014wait for me. I\u2019m coming back.\u201d</p> <p>Not right away, though. The Indians allowed him to share the food\u2014a sort of stew, which they scooped up with their hands in spite of its near-boiling temperature\u2014but were otherwise indifferent to him. He tried them in English, French\u2014even the small bits of German that he knew, but got no response.</p><p>They did tie him when they lay down to sleep; his ankles were bound and a noose put round his neck, tied to the wrist of one of his captors. Whether from indifference or because there wasn\u2019t one, they didn\u2019t give him a blanket, and he spent the night shivering, huddled as close to the dwindling fire as he could get without choking himself.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t thought he could sleep, but did, exhausted with pain. It was a restless sleep, though, filled with violent, fragmentary dreams and broken by the constant illusion of being strangled.</p><p>In the morning, they set off again. No question of riding this time; he walked, and as fast as he could; the noose was left around his neck, hanging loose, but a short length of rope bound his wrists to the harness leathers of one of the horses. He stumbled and fell several times, but managed to scramble to his feet, in spite of bruises and aching muscles. He had the distinct impression that they would allow him to be dragged without compunction if he didn\u2019t.</p><p>They were heading roughly north; he could tell as much by the sun. Not that that helped a lot, since he had no notion where they had started from. Still, they could be no great distance from Fraser\u2019s Ridge; he couldn\u2019t have been unconscious for more than a few hours. He looked at the churning hooves of the horse beside him, trying to estimate its speed. No more than two or three miles per hour; he was managing to keep up without great strain.</p><p>Landmarks. There was no telling where they meant to take him\u2014or why\u2014but if he was ever to get back, he had to memorize the shape of the terrain through which they passed.</p> <p>A cliff, forty feet high and overgrown with shaggy plants, a twisted persimmon tree protruding from a crack in the rock like a jack-in-the-box popping out, covered in bright orange bobbles.</p><p>They emerged onto the crest of a ridge, to a breathtaking view of distant mountains; three sharp peaks, clustered together against a blazing sky, the left one higher than the other two. He could remember that. A stream\u2014a river?\u2014that fell through a small gorge; they drove the horses through a shallow ford, soaking Roger to the waist in icy water.</p><p>The routine of travel lasted for days, moving ever northward. His captors did not talk to him, and by the fourth day he realized that he was beginning to lose track of time, falling into a dreamlike trance, overcome by fatigue and the silence of the mountains. He pulled a long thread from the hem of his coat and began to knot it, one knot for each day, both as some small hold on reality, and as a crude method of estimating the distance traveled.</p><p>He was going back. Whatever it took, he was going back to Fraser\u2019s Ridge.</p><p>It was on the eighth day that he found his chance. They were high in the mountains by now. They had crossed through one pass the day before, and come down a steep slope, the ponies grunting, slowing to brace each careful step as the loads on their saddles creaked and shifted.</p><p>Now they were headed up again, and the ponies slowed their pace still further as the ground sloped sharply upward. Roger was able to gain a little ground, to pull even with the pony\u2019s side and cling to the harness leather, letting the tough little beast pull him along.</p><p>The Indians had dismounted, walking and leading the ponies. He kept a narrow eye on the long black scalp lock hanging down the back of the brave leading the pony he clung to. He held on with one hand; the other was busy under cover of a hanging flap of canvas, picking at the knot that bound him to the harness.</p><p>Strand by strand, the hemp came free, until no more than a single thread of rope held him to the pony. He waited, sweat streaming down his ribs from fear and the effort of the climb, rejecting one opportunity after another, worrying from moment to moment that he had left it too late, that they would stop to make camp, that the brave who led his pony would turn and see him, would think to check.</p> <p>But they didn\u2019t stop, and the brave didn\u2019t turn. There, he thought, and his heart beat fast, seeing the first pony in the string step out along a narrow deer trail cut into the hillside. The ground fell away sharply below the trail, then leveled out about six feet down. Below was a thickly wooded slope, ideal for concealment.</p><p>One pony, then another, negotiated the narrow stretch of trail, putting down their feet with finicking care. A third, and then it was Roger\u2019s turn. He squeezed in close to the pony\u2019s side, smelling the sweet, pungent foam of its sweat. One step, then another, and they were on the narrow trail.</p><p>He jerked the rope loose and jumped. He hit with a jolt and sank halfway to his knees, sprang up and ran downhill. His shoes came off and he left them behind. He splashed across a tiny creek, scrabbled up its bank on hands and knees, and clambered to his feet, running before he\u2019d got upright.</p><p>He heard calls behind him, then silence, but knew he was pursued. He had no breath to waste; neither would they.</p><p>The landscape slid past in a blur of leaves and rocks as he swung his head from side to side, looking for which way to go, someplace to hide. He chose a grove of birch, burst through and into a sloping meadow, careened down across the slippery grass, bare feet stubbing on roots and rocks. At the far side, he took a second to glance back. Two of them; he saw the round dark heads among the leaves.</p><p>On into another copse, out again, zigzagging madly through a field of broken rocks, breath coming hard in his throat. One thing the bloody past had done for him, he thought grimly; improved his wind. Then there was no room for any thought\u2014nothing but the blind instincts of flight.</p><p>And down again, a scrambling drop down the wet, cracked face of a twenty-foot cliff, grabbing at the plants as he half fell past them, roots ripping, hands sinking into pockets of mud, blunting his fingers on unseen rocks. He landed hard at the bottom, bent over, gasping.</p><p>One of them was right behind him, coming backward down the cliff. He snatched off the noose still around his neck, and whipped it hard at the Indian\u2019s hands. The man\u2019s hold slipped; he let go and slithered down, landing askew. Roger flung the noose over the man\u2019s head, gave it a vicious yank, and fled, leaving the man on his knees, choking and clawing at the rope round his neck.</p><p>Trees. He needed cover. He vaulted a fallen log, stumbled and rolled, was up again running. Up, a spruce thicket up a little way. Heart laboring, he jabbed his feet down hard, bounding up the slope.</p><p>He flung himself into the spruces, fighting through the pricks of a million needles, blind, eyes shut against the lashing twigs. Then the ground gave way underneath him and he fell in a blur of sky and branches.</p><p>He hit, half curled, his breath knocked out; had barely sense to curl up further and keep on rolling, bashing off rocks and saplings, setting off showers of dirt and fallen needles, bouncing and smashing his way to the bottom.</p><p>He fetched up with a crash amid a tangle of woody stems, hung a moment, then slid down, to end with a thud. Dazed and bleeding, he lay still for a moment, then rolled painfully onto his side, wiping dirt and blood from his face.</p><p>He looked up, searching. There they were. The two of them, at the top of the slope, coming carefully down beside the ledge he had fallen from.</p><p>On hands and knees, he dived between the woody stems, and crawled for his life. Twigs bent, sharp ends jabbed him, and cascades of dust, dead leaves and insects fell from the higher branches above as he heaved his way forward, forcing a passage through the close-grown stems, twisting and turning, following such openings as he found.</p><p>Hell was his first coherent thought. Then he realized that it was as much description as curse. He was in a rhododendron hell. With that belated realization, he slowed his flight\u2014if crawling at roughly ten feet per hour could be called \u201cflight.\u201d</p><p>The tunnel-like opening in which he found himself was too narrow to allow him to turn around, but he managed to see behind him by thrusting his head to one side and craning his neck. There was nothing there; nothing but damp and musty darkness, illumined by a faint scatter of light, swirling with dust motes. Nothing was visible but the stems and limber branches of the rhododendron thicket.</p><p>His shaking limbs gave way, and he collapsed. He lay for a moment, curled up between the stems, breathing the musk of rotting leaves and damp earth.</p><p>\u201cYou wanted cover, mate,\u201d he murmured to himself. Things were beginning to hurt. He was ripped and bleeding in a dozen places. Even in the dim light, the ends of his fingers looked like raw meat.</p><p>He took a slow inventory of the damage, listening all the while for sounds of pursuit. Not surprisingly, there were none. He had heard talk about rhododendron hells in the taverns in Cross Creek; half-boasting stories of hunting dogs who had chased a squirrel into one of the huge tangles and become hopelessly lost, never to be seen again.</p><p>Roger hoped there was a fair amount of exaggeration to these stories, though a good look around wasn\u2019t reassuring. What light there was had no direction. Any way he looked, looked the same. Drooping clusters of cool, leathery leaves, thick stems and slender branches laced together in a nearly impenetrable snarl.</p><p>With a slight feeling of panic, he realized that he had no idea from which direction he had come.</p><p>He put his head on his knees and breathed deeply, trying to think. All right, first things first. His right foot was bleeding from a deep gash on the edge of the sole. He took off his tattered stockings and used one to bind his foot. Nothing else seemed bad enough to need a bandage, save the shallow gouge in his scalp; that was still seeping blood, wet and sticky to his touch. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>His hands were shaking; it was hard to tie the stocking round his head. Still, the small action made him feel better. Now, then. He\u2019d climbed countless Munros in Scotland, those endless craggy peaks, and more than once had helped to find day-trippers lost among the rocks and heather.</p><p>If you were lost in the wilderness, the usual caution was to stay put; wait for someone to find you. That would seem not to apply, he thought, if the only people looking for you were ones you didn\u2019t want to be found by.</p><p>He looked upward, through the snarl of branches. He could see small patches of sky, but the rhododendrons rose nearly twelve feet over his head. There was no way to stand up; he could barely sit upright under the interlacing branches.</p><p>There was no way of telling how big this particular hell was; on their journey through the mountains, he had seen entire slopes covered with heath balds, valleys filled with the deep green of rhododendron, only a few ambitious trees protruding above the waving sea of leaves. Then again, they had detoured round small tangles of the stuff, no more than a hundred feet square. He knew he was fairly close to one edge of the thing, but that knowledge was useless, with no idea in which direction the edge lay.</p> <p>He became aware that he was very cold, his hands still shaking. Shock, he thought dimly. What did you do for shock? Hot liquids, blankets. Brandy. Yeah, right. Elevate the feet. That much, he could do.</p><p>He scooped a shallow, awkward little depression and eased himself into it, scraping the clammy, half-rotted leaves over his chest and shoulders. He propped his heels in the fork of a stem and closed his eyes, shivering.</p><p>They wouldn\u2019t come in after him. Why should they? A lot better to wait, if they were in no hurry. He\u2019d have to come out eventually\u2014if he still could.</p><p>Any movement here below would shake the leaves above, and pinpoint his movements to the watchers. That was a cold thought; they undoubtedly knew where he was now, and were simply waiting for his next move. The patches of sky were the deep blue of sapphires; it was still afternoon. He would wait till dark before he moved, then.</p><p>Hands clasped together on his chest, he willed himself to rest, to think of something beyond his present situation. Brianna. Let him think of her. Without the rage or bewilderment, now; there was no time for that.</p> <p>Let him pretend that all was still between them as it had been on that night, their night. Warm against him in the dark. Her hands, so frank and curious, eager on his body. The generosity of her nak*dness, freely given. And his momentary, mistaken conviction that all was forever right with the world. Gradually, the shivering eased, and he slept.</p><p>He woke sometime after moonrise; he could see brightness suffusing the sky, though not the moon itself. He was stiff and cold, and very sore. Hungry, too, and with a desperate thirst. Well, if he got himself out of this bloody tangle, at least he could find water; streams were everywhere in these mountains. Feeling awkward as a turtle on its back, he turned slowly over.</p><p>One direction was as good as another. On hands and knees, he started off, pushing through crevices, breaking branches, trying his best to go in a straight line. One fear haunted him more than thought of the Indians; he could so easily lose his bearings, moving blindly through this maze. He could end by going in endless circles, trapped forever. The stories of the hunting dogs had lost any element of exaggeration.</p><p>Some small animal ran over his hand and he jerked, hitting his head on the branches overhead. He gritted his teeth and kept on, a few inches at a time. Crickets chirped all around him, and countless small rustlings let him know that the inhabitants of this particular hell didn\u2019t appreciate his intrusion. He couldn\u2019t see anything at all; it was almost pitch-black here below. There was the one good thing, though: The constant effort heated him; sweat stung the gouge in his scalp and dripped from his chin.</p><p>Whenever he had to stop for breath, he listened for some clue\u2014to either his location or his pursuers\u2019\u2014but he heard nothing beyond the occasional night bird\u2019s call and the rustle of the leaves all around. He wiped his sweating face on his sleeve and pushed on.</p><p>He didn\u2019t know how long he had been going when he found the rock. Or not so much found it as ran headfirst into it. He reeled back, clutching his head and gritting his teeth to keep from crying out.</p> <p>Blinking from the pain, he put out a hand and found what he had struck. Not a boulder; a flat-faced rock. A tall one, too; the hard surface extended up as high as he could reach.</p><p>He groped to the side, and made his way around the rock. There was a thick stem growing near it; his shoulders stuck in the narrow space between. He wrenched and heaved, squirming, and finally shot forward, losing his balance and landing on his face.</p><p>Doggedly, he rose up onto his hands again\u2014and realized that he could see his hands. He looked up, and around, in complete amazement.</p><p>His head and shoulders protruded into a clear space. Not merely clear, but empty. Eagerly, he wriggled forward, out of the claustrophobic grip of the rhododendrons.</p><p>He was standing in an open space, facing a cliff wall that rose on the far side of a small clearing. It really was a clearing, too; nothing at all grew in the soft dirt beneath his feet. Astonished, he turned slowly round, gulping great lungfuls of cold, sharp air.</p><p>\u201cMy God in heaven,\u201d he said softly, aloud. The clearing was roughly oval in shape, ringed by standing stones, with one end of the oval closed by the cliff face. The stones were evenly spaced around the ring, a few of them fallen, a couple more dislodged from their places by the press of roots and stems behind them. He could see the dense black mass of the rhododendrons, showing between and above the stones\u2014but not one plant grew within the perimeter of the ring.</p><p>Feeling gooseflesh ripple over his body, he walked softly toward the center of the ring. It couldn\u2019t be\u2014but it was. And why not, after all? If Geillis Duncan had been right...he turned and saw in the moonlight the scratchings on the cliff face.</p><p>He walked closer to look at them. There were several petroglyphs, some the size of his hand, others nearly as tall as he was; spiral shapes, and what might be a bent man, dancing\u2014or dying. A nearly closed circle, that looked like a snake chasing its tail. Warning signs.</p> <p>He shuddered again, and his hand went to the seam of his breeches. They were still there: the two gems he had risked his life to get, tiny passports to safety\u2014he hoped\u2014for him and for Brianna.</p><p>He could hear nothing; no humming, no buzzing. The autumn air was cold, a light wind stirring the rhododendron leaves. Damn, what was the date? He didn\u2019t know, had lost track long since. He thought it had been near the beginning of September, though, when he left Brianna in Wilmington. It had taken much longer than he\u2019d thought, to track Bonnet and find an opportunity to steal the gems. It must be nearly the end of October now\u2014the feast of Samhain, the Eve of All Hallows, was nearly come, or only recently past.</p><p>Would this ring follow the same dates, though? He supposed that it would; if the Earth\u2019s lines of force shifted with its revolution around the sun, then all the passages should stand open or closed with the shift.</p><p>He stepped closer to the cliff and saw it; an opening near the base of the cliff, a split in the rock, perhaps a cave. A chill ran over him that had nothing to do with the cold night wind. His fingers closed tightly over the small round hardness of the gems. He heard nothing; was it open? If so...</p><p>Escape. It would be that. Escape to when, though? And how? The words of Geilie\u2019s spell chanted in his mind. Garnets rest in love about my neck; I will be faithful.</p><p>Faithful. To try that avenue of escape was to abandon Brianna. And hasn\u2019t she abandoned you?</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m damned if she has!\u201d he whispered to himself. There was some reason for what she\u2019d done, he knew it.</p><p>She\u2019s found her parents; she\u2019ll be safe enough. \u201cAnd for this reason, a woman shall leave her parents, and cleave to her husband.\u201d Safety wasn\u2019t what mattered; love was. If he\u2019d cared for safety, he wouldn\u2019t have crossed that desperate void to begin with.</p><p>His hands were sweating; he could feel the damp grain of the rough cloth under his fingers, and his torn fingertips burned and throbbed. He took one more step toward the split in the cliff face, his eyes fixed on the pitch-black inside. If he didn\u2019t step inside...there were only two things to do. Go back to the suffocating grip of the rhododendrons, or try to scale the cliff before him.</p><p>He tilted his head back to gauge its height. A face was looking down at him, featureless in the dark, silhouetted against the moon-bright sky. He hadn\u2019t time to move or think before the rope noose settled gently over his head and tightened, pressing his arms against his body.</p><p>52</p><p>DESERTION</p><p>River Run, December 1769</p><p>It had been raining, and soon would be again. Drops of water hung trembling under the petals of the marble Jacobite roses on Hector Cameron\u2019s tomb, and the brick walk was dark with wet.</p><p>Semper Fidelis, it said, beneath his name and dates. Semper Fi. She had dated a Marine cadet once; he\u2019d had it carved on the ring he had tried to give her. Always faithful. And who had Hector Cameron been faithful to? His wife? His prince?</p><p>She hadn\u2019t spoken to Jamie Fraser since that night. Nor he to her. Not since the final moment, when in a fury of fear and outrage, she had screamed at him, \u201cMy father would never have said such a thing!\u201d</p><p>She could still see what his face had looked like when she spoke her final words to him; she wished she could forget. He had turned without a word and left the cabin. Ian had risen, and quietly gone after him; neither of them had come back that night.</p><p>Her mother had stayed with her, comforting, petting, stroking her head and murmuring small soothing things as she alternately raged and sobbed. But even as her mother held Brianna\u2019s head in her lap and wiped her face with cool cloths, Bree could feel a part of her yearning toward that man, wanting to follow him, wanting to comfort him. And she blamed him for that as well.</p><p>Her head throbbed with the effort of staying stone-faced. She didn\u2019t dare relax the muscles of eyes and jaw until she was sure they had left; it would be too easy to break down.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t; not since that night. Once she had pulled herself together, she had assured her mother that she was all right, insisted that Claire go to bed. She had herself sat up till dawn, eyes burning from rage and woodsmoke, with the drawing of Roger on the table before her.</p><p>He had come back at dawn, called her mother to him, not looking at Brianna. Murmured a bit in the dooryard, and sent her mother back, face hollow-eyed with worry, to pack her things.</p><p>He had brought her here, down the mountain to River Run. She had wanted to go with them, had wanted to go at once to find Roger, without a moment\u2019s delay. But he had been obdurate, and so had her mother.</p><p>It was late December, and the winter snows lay thick on the mountainside. She was nearly four months gone; the taut curve of her belly was tightly rounded now. There was no telling how long the journey might take, and she was reluctantly compelled to admit that she didn\u2019t want to give birth on a raw mountainside. She might have overridden her mother\u2019s opinion, but not when it was buttressed by his stubbornness.</p><p>She leaned her forehead against the cool marble of the mausoleum; it was a cold day, spitting rain, but her face felt hot and swollen, as though she were coming down with a fever. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She couldn\u2019t stop hearing him, seeing him. His face, congested with rage, sharp-edged as a devil\u2019s mask. His voice, rough with fury and contempt, reproaching her\u2014reproaching her!\u2014for the loss of his bloody honor!</p><p>\u201cYour honor?\u201d she had said incredulously. \u201cYour honor? Your f**king notion of honor is what\u2019s caused all the trouble in the first place!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYe willna use that sort of language to me! Though if it\u2019s f**king we\u2019re speaking of\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll f**king well say anything I want!\u201d she bellowed, and slammed a fist on the table, rattling the dishes.</p> <p>She had, too. So had he. Her mother had tried once or twice to stop them\u2014Brianna flinched at the belated memory of the distress in Claire\u2019s deep golden eyes\u2014but neither of them had paid a moment\u2019s notice, too intent on the savagery of their mutual betrayal.</p><p>Her mother had told her once that she had a Scottish temper\u2014slow-fused, but long-burning. Now she knew where it came from, but the knowing didn\u2019t help.</p><p>She put her folded arms against the tomb and rested her face on them, breathing in the faint sheep-smell of the wool. It reminded her of the hand-knit sweaters her father\u2014her real father, she thought, with a fresh burst of desolation\u2014had liked to wear.</p><p>\u201cWhy did you have to die?\u201d she whispered to the hollow of damp wool. \u201cOh, why?\u201d If Frank Randall hadn\u2019t died, none of this would have happened. He and Claire would still be there, in the house in Boston, her family and her life would be intact.</p><p>But her father was gone, replaced by a violent stranger; a man who had her face, but could not understand her heart, a man who had taken both family and home from her, and not satisfied with that, had taken love and safety, too, leaving her bereft in this strange, harsh land.</p> <p>She pulled the shawl closer around her shoulders, shivering at the wind that cut through the loose weave. She should have brought a cloak. She had kissed her white-lipped mother goodbye and then left, running through the dead garden, not looking at him. She\u2019d wait here until she was sure they were gone, no matter if she froze.</p><p>She heard a step on the brick path above her and stiffened, though she didn\u2019t turn around. Perhaps it was a servant, or Jocasta come to persuade her inside.</p><p>But it was a stride too long and a footfall too strong for any but one man. She blinked hard, and gritted her teeth. She wouldn\u2019t turn around, she wouldn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cBrianna,\u201d he said quietly behind her. She didn\u2019t answer, didn\u2019t move.</p><p>He made a small snorting noise\u2014anger, impatience?</p><p>\u201cI have a thing to say to ye.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSay it,\u201d she said, and the words hurt her throat, as though she\u2019d swallowed some jagged object.</p><p>It was beginning to rain again; fresh spatters slicked the marble in front of her, and she could feel the icy pat! of drops that struck through her hair.</p><p>\u201cI will bring him home to you,\u201d Jamie Fraser said, still quiet, \u201cor I will not come back myself.\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t bring herself to turn around. There was a small sound, a click on the pavement behind her, and then the sound of his footsteps, going away. Before her tear-blurred eyes, the drops on the marble roses gathered weight and began to fall.</p><p>When at last she turned around, the brick-lined walk was empty. At her feet was a folded paper, damp with rain, weighted with a stone. She picked it up, and held it crumpled in her hand, afraid to open it.</p><p>February 1770</p><p>In spite of worry and anger, she found herself easily absorbed into the flow of daily life at River Run. Her great-aunt, delighted at her company, encouraged her to find distraction; finding that she had some skill in drawing, Jocasta had brought out her own painting equipment, urging Brianna to make use of it.</p><p>By comparison with the cabin on the ridge, life at River Run was so luxurious as to be almost decadent. Still, Brianna woke at dawn, out of habit. She stretched langourously, wallowing in the physical delight of a feather bed that embraced and yielded to her every move\u2014a definite contrast to lumpy quilts spread over a chilly straw tick.</p> <p>There was a fire burning on the hearth, and a large copper can on the washstand, its burnished sides glowing. Hot water for washing; she could see the tiny shimmers of heat wavering over the metal. There was still a chill in the room, and the light outside was winter-blue with cold; the servant who had come and gone in silence must have risen in the black predawn and broken ice to get the water.</p><p>She ought to feel guilty at being waited on by slaves, she thought drowsily. She must remember to, later. There were a lot of things she didn\u2019t mean to think about until later; one more wouldn\u2019t hurt.</p><p>For now, she was warm. Far away, she could hear small noises in the house; a comforting scuffle of domesticity. The room itself was wrapped in silence, the occasional pop of kindling from the fire the only sound.</p><p>She rolled onto her back and, mind still half afloat in sleep, began to reacquaint herself with her body. This was a morning ritual; something she had begun to do half consciously as a teenager, and found necessary to do on purpose now\u2014to find and make peace with the small changes of the night, lest she look suddenly during the day and find herself a stranger in her own body.</p><p>One stranger in her body was enough, she thought. She pushed the bedclothes down, running her hands slowly over the dormant swell of her stomach. A tiny ripple ran across her flesh as the inhabitant stretched, turning slowly as she had turned in the bed a few minutes before, enclosed and embraced.</p><p>\u201cHi, there,\u201d she said softly. The bulge flexed briefly against her hand and then fell still, the occupant returned to its mysterious dreams.</p><p>Slowly, she ruffled up the nightgown\u2014it was Jocasta\u2019s, warm soft flannel\u2014registering the smooth long muscle at the top of each thigh, the soft hollow curving in at the top. Then up and down and over, bare skin to bare skin, palms to legs and belly and br**sts. Smooth and soft, round and hard; muscle and bone...but now not all her muscle and bone.</p><p>Her skin felt different in the morning, like a snake\u2019s skin, newly shed, all tender and light-lucent. Later, when she rose, when the air got at it, it would be harder, a duller but more serviceable envelope.</p><p>She lay back against the pillow, watching the light fill the room. The house was awake beyond her. She could hear the myriad faint noises of people at work, and felt soothed. When she was small, she would wake on summer mornings to hear the chatter of her father\u2019s lawnmower underneath her window; his voice calling out in greeting to a neighbor. She had felt safe, protected, knowing he was there.</p><p>More recently, she had waked at dawn and heard Jamie Fraser\u2019s voice, speaking in soft Gaelic to his horses outside, and had felt that same feeling return with a rush. No more, though.</p><p>It had been true, what her mother said. She was removed, changed, altered without consent or knowledge, learning only after the fact. She threw aside the quilts and got up. She couldn\u2019t lie in bed mourning what was lost; it was no longer anyone\u2019s job to protect her. The job of protector was hers, now.</p><p>The baby was a constant presence\u2014and, oddly enough, a constant reassurance. For the first time she felt blessing in it, and an odd reconciliation; her body had known this long before her mind. So that was true, too\u2014her mother had said it often\u2014\u201cListen to your body.\u201d</p><p>She leaned against the window frame, looking out on the patchy snow that lay on the kitchen garden. A slave, muffled in cloak and scarf, was kneeling on the path, digging overwintered carrots from one of the beds. Tall elms bordered the walled garden; somewhere beyond those stark bare branches lay the mountains.</p><p>She stayed still, listening to the rhythms of her body. The intruder in her flesh stirred a little, the tides of its movement merging with the pulsing of her blood\u2014their blood. In the beating of her heart, she thought she heard the echo of that other, smaller heart, and in the sound found at last the courage to think clearly, with the assurance that if the worst happened\u2014she pressed hard against the window frame, and felt it creak under the force of her urgency\u2014if the worst happened, still she would not be totally alone.</p><p>53</p><p>BLAME</p><p>Jamie spoke barely a word to anyone, between our departure from Fraser\u2019s Ridge, and our arrival at the Tuscaroran village of Tennago. I rode in a state of misery, torn between guilt at leaving Brianna, fear for Roger, and pain at Jamie\u2019s silence. He was short with Ian, and had said no more than absolutely necessary to Jocasta at Cross Creek. To me, he said nothing.</p><p>Plainly, he blamed me for not telling him at once about Stephen Bonnet. In retrospect, I blamed myself bitterly, seeing what had come of it. He had kept the gold ring I had thrown at him; I had no idea what he had done with it.</p><p>The weather was intermittently bad, the clouds hanging so low to the mountains that on the higher ridges, we traveled for days on end through a thick, cold fog, water droplets condensing on the horses\u2019 coats, so that a constant rain dripped from their manes and moisture shone on their flanks. We slept at night in whatever shelter we could find, each rolled in a damp cocoon of blankets, lying separately around a smoldering fire.</p><p>Some of the Indians who had known us at Anna Ooka made us welcome when we reached Tennago. I saw several men eye the casks of whisky as we unloaded our pack mules, but no one made any move to molest them. There were two mule-loads of whisky; a dozen small casks, all of the Fraser share of the year\u2019s distilling\u2014most of our income for the year. A king\u2019s ransom, in terms of trade. Enough to ransom one young Scotsman, I hoped.</p><p>It was the best\u2014and the only\u2014thing we had to trade with, but it was also a dangerous one. Jamie presented one cask to the sachem of the village, and he and Ian disappeared into one of the longhouses to confer. Ian had given Roger to some of his friends among the Tuscarora, but did not know where they had taken him. I hoped against hope that it was Tennago. If so, we could be back at River Run within a month.</p><p>This was a faint hope, though. In the midst of the bitter quarrel with Brianna, Jamie had admitted telling Ian to make sure that Roger didn\u2019t come back again. Tennago was about ten days journey from the Ridge; much too close for the purposes of an enraged father.</p><p>I wanted to ask the women who entertained me about Roger, but no one in the house had any French or English, and I had only enough words of Tuscaroran to allow for basic politeness. Better to let Ian and Jamie handle the diplomatic negotiations. Jamie, with his gift for languages, was competent in Tuscaroran; Ian, who spent half his time hunting with the Indians, was thoroughly fluent.</p><p>One of the women offered me a platter containing steaming mounds of grain cooked with fish. I leaned to scoop up a bit with the flat piece of wood provided for the purpose, and felt the amulet swing forward under my shirt, its small weight both a reminder of grief and a comfort to it.</p><p>I had brought both Nayawenne\u2019s amulet, and the carved opal I had found under the red cedar tree. I had brought the former, intending to give it back\u2014to whom, I had no idea. The latter might augment the whisky, if additional bargaining power was needed. For the same reason, Jamie had brought every small valuable he possessed\u2014not many\u2014with the exception of his father\u2019s ruby ring, which Brianna had brought to him from Scotland. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>We had left the ruby with Brianna, just in case we did not return\u2014the possibility had to be faced. There was no telling whether Geillis Duncan had been right or wrong in her theories regarding the use of gemstones, but at least Brianna would have one.</p><p>She had hugged me fiercely and kissed me when we left River Run. I hadn\u2019t wanted to go. Nor had I wanted to stay. I was torn between them once more; between the necessity to stay and look after Brianna, and the equally urgent necessity to go with Jamie.</p><p>\u201cYou have to go,\u201d Brianna had said firmly. \u201cI\u2019ll be fine; you said yourself I\u2019m healthy as a horse. You\u2019ll be back a long time before I need you.\u201d</p><p>She had glanced at her father\u2019s back; he stood in the stableyard, supervising the loading of the horses and mules. She turned back to me, expressionless.</p> <p>\u201cYou have to go, Mama. I trust you to find Roger.\u201d There was an uncomfortable emphasis on the you, and I hoped very much that Jamie couldn\u2019t hear her.</p><p>\u201cSurely you don\u2019t think Jamie would\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d she interrupted. \u201cI don\u2019t know what he\u2019d do.\u201d Her jaw was set in a way I recognized all too well. Argument was futile, but I tried anyway.</p><p>\u201cWell, I know,\u201d I said firmly. \u201cHe\u2019d do anything for you, Brianna. Anything. And even if it weren\u2019t you, he\u2019d do everything he possibly could to get Roger back. His sense of honor\u2014\u201d Her face shut up like a trap, and I realized my mistake.</p><p>\u201cHis honor,\u201d she said flatly. \u201cThat\u2019s what matters. I guess it\u2019s all right, though; as long as it makes him get Roger back.\u201d She turned away, bending her head against the wind.</p> <p>\u201cBrianna!\u201d I said, but she only hunched her shoulders, pulling the shawl tight around them.</p><p>\u201cAuntie Claire? We\u2019re ready now.\u201d Ian had appeared nearby, glancing from me to Brianna, his face troubled. I looked from him to Brianna, hesitating, not wanting to leave her like this.</p><p>\u201cBree?\u201d I said again.</p><p>Then she had turned back in a flurry of wool and embraced me, her cheek cold against mine.</p><p>\u201cCome back!\u201d she whispered. \u201cOh, Mama\u2014come back safe!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t leave you, Bree, I can\u2019t!\u201d I held her tight, all strong bone and tender flesh, the child I had left, the child I had regained\u2014and the woman who now put my arms away from her and stood straight, alone.</p> <p>\u201cYou have to go,\u201d she whispered. The mask of indifference had fallen and her cheeks were wet. She glanced over my shoulder at the archway to the stableyard. \u201cBring him back. You\u2019re the only one who can bring him back.\u201d</p><p>She kissed me quickly, turned and ran, the sound of her steps ringing on the brick path.</p><p>Jamie came through the stable arch and saw her, flying through the stormy light like a banshee. He stood still, looking after her, his face expressionless.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t leave her like this,\u201d I said. I wiped my own wet cheeks with the corner of my shawl. \u201cJamie, go after her. Please, go and say goodbye, at least.\u201d</p><p>He stood still for a moment, and I thought he was going to pretend he hadn\u2019t heard me. But then he turned and walked slowly down the path. The first drops of rain were beginning to fall, splatting on the dusty brick, and the wind belled his cloak as he went.</p><p>\u201cAuntie?\u201d Ian\u2019s hand was under my arm, gently urging. I went with him, and let him give me a hand under my foot to mount. Within a few minutes Jamie was back. He had mounted, not looking at me, and, with a signal to Ian, ridden out of the stableyard without looking back. I had looked back, but there was no sign of Brianna.</p><p>Night had long since fallen, and Jamie was still in the longhouse with Nacognaweto and the sachem of the village. I looked up whenever anyone came into the house, but it was never him. At length, though, the hide flap over the doorway lifted, and Ian came in, a small, round figure behind him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve a surprise for ye, Auntie,\u201d he said, beaming, and stepped aside to show me the smiling round face of the slavewoman Pollyanne.</p> <p>Or rather, the ex-slave. For here, of course, she was free. She sat down beside me, grinning like a jack-o\u2019-lantern, and turned back the deerskin mantle she wore to show me the little boy in the crook of her arm, his face as round and beaming as her own.</p><p>With Ian as interpreter, her own bits of English and Gaelic, and the odd bit of female sign language, we were soon deep in conversation. She had, as Myers surmised, been welcomed by the Tuscarorans and adopted into the tribe, where her skills at healing were valued. She had taken as husband a man who had been widowed in the measles epidemic, and had presented him with this new addition to the family a few months before.</p><p>I was delighted that she had found both freedom and happiness, and congratulated her warmly. I was reassured, too; if the Tuscarorans had treated her so kindly, perhaps Roger had not fared as badly as I feared.</p><p>A thought struck me, and I pulled Nayawenne\u2019s amulet from the neck of my buckskin shirt.</p><p>\u201cIan\u2014will you ask if she knows who I should give this to?\u201d</p><p>He spoke to her in Tuscaroran, and she leaned forward, fingering the amulet curiously as he spoke. At last she shook her head and sat back, replying in her curious deep voice.</p><p>\u201cShe says they will not want it, Auntie,\u201d Ian translated. \u201cIt is the medicine bundle of a shaman, and it is dangerous. It should have been buried with the person to whom it belonged; no one here will touch it, for fear of attracting the shaman\u2019s ghost.\u201d</p><p>I hesitated, holding the leather pouch in my hand. The strange sense of holding something alive had not recurred since Nayawenne\u2019s death. Surely it was no more than imagination that seemed to stir against my palm.</p><p>\u201cAsk her\u2014what if the shaman wasn\u2019t buried? If the body couldn\u2019t be found?\u201d</p><p>Pollyanne\u2019s round face was solemn, listening. She shook her head when Ian had finished and replied.</p><p>\u201cShe says that in that case the ghost walks with you, Auntie. She says you should not show it to anyone here\u2014they will be frightened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe isn\u2019t frightened, is she?\u201d Pollyanne caught that on her own; she shook her head, and touched her massive bosom.</p><p>\u201cIndian now,\u201d she said simply. \u201cNot always.\u201d She turned to Ian, and explained through him that her own people revered the spirits of the dead; in fact, it was not unusual for a man to keep by him the head or some other part of his grandfather or other ancestor, for protection or advice. No, the thought of a ghost walking with me did not trouble her.</p><p>Nor did the notion trouble me. In fact, I found the thought of Nayawenne walking with me to be rather a comfort, under the circumstances. I put the amulet back in my shirt. It brushed soft and warm against my skin, like the touch of a friend.</p><p>We talked for some time, until long after the others in the longhouse had gone to their separate cubicles, and the sound of snoring filled the smoky air. We were surprised, in fact, by Jamie\u2019s arrival, which let in a draft of cold air.</p><p>It was as Pollyanne made her farewells that she hesitated, trying to decide whether to tell me something. She glanced at Jamie, then shrugged her massive shoulders and made up her mind. She leaned close to Ian, murmured something that sounded like honey trickling over rocks, putting both hands to her face, fingertips against the skin. She then embraced me quickly and left.</p><p>Ian stared after her in astonishment.</p><p>\u201cWhat did she say, Ian?\u201d</p><p>He turned back to me, his sketchy brows drawn together in concern.</p><p>\u201cShe says I should tell Uncle Jamie, that the night the woman died in the sawmill, she saw a man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat man?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head, still frowning.</p><p>\u201cShe didna ken him. Only that he was a white man, heavy and square, not so tall as Uncle or I. She saw him come out of the mill, and walk fast into the forest. She was sitting in the door to her hut, in the dark, so she thinks he didna see her\u2014but he passed close enough to the fire that she saw his face. She says he was pockmarked\u201d\u2014here he put his fingertips against his face, as she had\u2014\u201cwith a face like a pig.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMurchison?\u201d My heart skipped a beat.</p><p>\u201cDid the man wear a uniform?\u201d Jamie asked, frowning.</p><p>\u201cNo. But she was curious to know what he had been doing there; he wasna one of the plantation owners, nor yet a hand or an overseer. So she crept to the mill to see, but when she put her head inside, she knew something evil had happened. She said she smelt blood, and then she heard voices, so she didna go in.\u201d</p><p>So it had been murder, and Jamie and I had missed preventing it by a matter of moments. It was warm in the longhouse, but I felt cold at the memory of the thick, bloody air in the sawmill, and the hardness of a kitchen skewer in my hand.</p><p>Jamie\u2019s hand settled on my shoulder. Without thinking, I reached up and took it. It felt very good in mine, and I realized that we had not purposely touched each other in nearly a month.</p><p>\u201cThe dead lass was an army laundress,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cMurchison has a wife in England; I suppose he might have found a pregnant mistress to be an encumbrance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo wonder he was making such a fuss of hunting for whoever was responsible\u2014and then seizin\u2019 on yon poor woman who couldna even speak for herself.\u201d Ian\u2019s face was flushed with indignation. \u201cIf he could have got her hanged for it, he\u2019d ha\u2019 thought himself safe, I daresay, the wicked wee scut.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps I will pay a call on the Sergeant, when we return,\u201d Jamie said. \u201cPrivately.\u201d</p><p>The thought made my blood run cold. His voice was soft and even, and his face calm when I turned to look, but I seemed to see the surface of a dark Scottish pool reflected in his eyes, the water ruffled as though something heavy had just sunk below.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you think you\u2019ve enough vengeance to keep you occupied for the moment?\u201d</p><p>I spoke more sharply than I intended, and his hand slipped abruptly out of mine.</p><p>\u201cI expect so,\u201d he said, both face and voice without expression. He turned to Ian.</p><p>\u201cWakefield\u2014or MacKenzie, or whatever the man\u2019s name is\u2014is a good way to the north. They sold him to the Mohawk; a small village below the river. Your friend Onakara has agreed to guide us; we\u2019ll leave at first light.\u201d</p><p>He rose and walked away, toward the far end of the house. Everyone else had already retired for the night. Five hearths burned, down the length of the house, each with its own smokehole, and the far wall was divided into cubicles, one for each couple or family, with a low, wide shelf for sleeping and space beneath for storage.</p><p>Jamie stopped at the cubicle assigned for our use, where I had left our cloaks and bundles. He slipped off his boots, unbelted the plaid he wore over breeches and shirt, and disappeared into the darkness of the sleeping space without a backward glance.</p><p>I scrambled to my feet, meaning to follow him, but Ian stopped me with a hand on my arm.</p><p>\u201cAuntie,\u201d he said hesitantly. \u201cWill ye not forgive him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cForgive him?\u201d I stared at him. \u201cFor what? For Roger?\u201d</p><p>He grimaced.</p><p>\u201cNo. It was a grievous mistake, but we would do the same again, thinking matters as we did. No\u2014for Bonnet.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cFor Stephen Bonnet? How can he possibly think I blame him for that? I\u2019ve never said such a thing to him!\u201d And I had been too busy thinking that he blamed me, to even consider it.</p><p>Ian scratched a hand through his hair.</p><p>\u201cWell...do ye not see, Auntie? He blames himself for it. He has, ever since the man robbed us on the river; and now wi\u2019 what he\u2019s done to my cousin...\u201d He shrugged, looking mildly embarrassed. \u201cHe\u2019s fair eaten up with it, and knowing that you\u2019re angry wi\u2019 him\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I\u2019m not angry with him! I thought he was angry with me, because I didn\u2019t tell him Bonnet\u2019s name right away.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOch.\u201d Ian looked as though he didn\u2019t know whether to laugh or look distressed. \u201cWell, I daresay it would ha\u2019 saved us a bit of trouble if ye had, but no, I\u2019m sure it\u2019s not that, Auntie. After all, by the time Cousin Brianna told ye, we\u2019d already met yon MacKenzie on the mountainside and done him a bit of no good.\u201d</p><p>I took in a deep breath and blew it out again.</p><p>\u201cBut you think he thinks I\u2019m angry at him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, anyone could see ye are, Auntie,\u201d he assured me earnestly. \u201cYe dinna look at him or speak to him save for what ye must\u2014and,\u201d he said, clearing his throat delicately, \u201cI havena seen ye go to his bed, anytime this month past.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, he hasn\u2019t come to mine, either!\u201d I said hotly, before reflecting that this was scarcely a suitable conversation to be having with a seventeen year-old boy.</p> <p>Ian hunched his shoulders and gave me an owlish look.</p><p>\u201cWell, he\u2019s his pride, hasn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod knows he has,\u201d I said, rubbing a hand over my face. \u201cI\u2014look, Ian, thank you for saying something to me.\u201d</p><p>He gave me one of the rare sweet smiles that transformed his long, homely face.</p><p>\u201cWell, I do hate to see him suffer. I\u2019m fond of Uncle Jamie, aye?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo am I,\u201d I said, and swallowed the small lump in my throat. \u201cGood night, Ian.\u201d</p> <p>I walked softly down the length of the house, past cubicles in which whole families slept together, the sound of their mingled breathing a peaceful descant to the anxious beating of my heart. It was raining outside; water dripped from the smokeholes, sizzling in the embers.</p><p>Why had I not seen what Ian had? That was easy to answer; it wasn\u2019t anger, but my own sense of guilt that had blinded me. I had kept back my knowledge of Bonnet\u2019s involvement as much because of the gold wedding ring as because Brianna had asked me to; I could have persuaded her to tell Jamie, had I tried.</p><p>She was right; he would undoubtedly go after Stephen Bonnet sooner or later. I had somewhat more confidence in Jamie\u2019s success than she did, though. No, it had been the ring that had made me keep silence.</p><p>And why should I feel guilty over that? There was no sensible answer; it had been instinct, not conscious thought, to hide the ring. I had not wanted to show it to Jamie, to put it back on my finger in front of him. And yet I had wanted\u2014needed\u2014to keep it.</p><p>My heart squeezed small, thinking of the past few weeks, of Jamie, going grimly about the necessities of reparation in loneliness and guilt. That was why I had come with him, after all\u2014because I was afraid that if he went alone, he might not come back. Spurred by guilt and courage, he might go to reckless lengths; with me to consider, I knew he would be careful. And all the time he had thought himself not only alone but bitterly reproached by the one person who could\u2014and should\u2014have offered him comfort.</p><p>\u201cEaten up with it\u201d indeed.</p><p>I paused by the cubicle. The shelf was some eight feet wide, and he lay well back; I could see little more of him than a humped shape under a blanket made of rabbit skins. He lay very still, but I knew he wasn\u2019t asleep.</p><p>I climbed onto the platform, and once safe within the shadows of the cubicle, slipped out of my clothes. It was fairly warm in the longhouse, but my bare skin prickled and my n**ples tightened. My eyes had grown accustomed to the dimness; I could see that he lay on his side facing me. I caught the shine of his eyes in the dark, open and watching me.</p> <p>I knelt down and slid under the blanket, the fur soft against my skin. Without stopping to think too much, I rolled to face him, pressing my nak*dness against him, face buried in his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cJamie,\u201d I whispered to him. \u201cI\u2019m cold. Come and warm me. Please?\u201d</p><p>He turned to me, wordless, with a quiet ferocity that I might have thought the hunger of desire long stifled\u2014but knew now for simple desperation. I sought no pleasure for myself; I wanted only to give him comfort. But opening to him, urging him, some deep wellspring opened too, and I cleaved to him in a sudden need as blind and desperate as his own.</p><p>We clung tight together, shuddering, heads buried in each other\u2019s hair, unable to look at each other, unable to let go. Slowly, as the spasms died away, I became aware of things outside our own small mortal coil, and realized that we lay in the midst of strangers, nak*d and helpless, shielded only by darkness.</p><p>And yet we were alone, completely. We had the privacy of Babel; there was a conversation going on at the far end of the longhouse, but its words held no meaning. It might as well have been the hum of bees.</p><p>Smoke from the banked fire wavered up outside the sanctuary of our bed, fragrant and insubstantial as incense. It was dark as a confessional inside the cubicle; I could see no more of Jamie than the faint curve of light that rimmed his shoulder, a transient gleam in the locks of his hair.</p><p>\u201cJamie, I\u2019m sorry,\u201d I said softly. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t your fault.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho else?\u201d he said, with some bleakness.</p><p>\u201cEveryone. No one. Stephen Bonnet, himself. But not you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBonnet?\u201d His voice was blank with surprise. \u201cWhat has he to do with it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell...everything,\u201d I said, taken aback. \u201cEr...doesn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>He rolled halfway off me, brushing hair out of his face.</p><p>\u201cStephen Bonnet is a wicked creature,\u201d he said precisely, \u201cand I shall kill him at the first opportunity I have. But I dinna see how I can blame him for my own failings as a man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat on earth are you talking about? What failings?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t answer right away, but bent his head, a humped shadow in the dark. His legs were still entangled with mine; I could feel the tension of his body, knotted in his joints, rigid in the hollows of his thighs.</p><p>\u201cI hadna thought ever to be so jealous of a dead man,\u201d he whispered at last. \u201cI shouldna have thought it possible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf a dead man?\u201d My own voice rose slightly, with astonishment, as it finally dawned on me. \u201cOf Frank?\u201d</p><p>He lay still, half on top of me. His hand touched the bones of my face, hesitant.</p><p>\u201cWho else? I have been worm-eaten wi\u2019 it, all these days of riding. I see his face in my mind, waking and sleeping. Ye did say he looked like Jack Randall, no?\u201d</p><p>I gathered him tight against myself, pressing his head down so that his ear was near my mouth. Thank God I hadn\u2019t mentioned the ring to him\u2014but had my face, my traitorous, transparent face, somehow given away that I thought of it?</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d I whispered to him, squeezing hard. \u201cHow could you think of such a thing?\u201d</p><p>He broke loose, rising on one elbow, his hair falling down over my face in a mass of flaming shadows, the firelight sparking gold and crimson through it.</p><p>\u201cHow could I not?\u201d he demanded. \u201cYe heard her, Claire; ye ken well what she said to me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrianna?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe said she would gladly see me in hell, and sell her own soul to have her father back\u2014her real father.\u201d He swallowed; I heard the sound of it, above the murmur of distant voices.</p><p>\u201cI keep thinking he would not have made such a mistake. He would have trusted her; he would have known that she...I keep thinking that Frank Randall was a better man than I am. She thinks so.\u201d His hand faltered, then settled on my shoulder, squeezing tight. \u201cI thought...perhaps ye felt the same, Sassenach.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFool,\u201d I whispered, and didn\u2019t mean him. I ran my hands down the long slope of his back, digging my fingers into the firmness of his buttocks. \u201cWee idiot. Come here.\u201d</p><p>He dropped his head, and made a small sound against my shoulder that might have been a laugh.</p><p>\u201cAye, I am. Ye dinna mind it so much, though?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d His hair smelt of smoke and pinesap. There were still bits of needles caught in it; one pricked smooth and sharp against my lips.</p><p>\u201cShe didn\u2019t mean it,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cAye, she did,\u201d he said, and I felt him swallow the thickness in his throat. \u201cI heard her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI heard you both.\u201d I rubbed slowly between his shoulder blades, feeling the faint traces of the old scars, the thicker, more recent welts left by the bear\u2019s claws. \u201cShe\u2019s just like you; she\u2019ll say things in a temper she\u2019d never say in cold blood. You didn\u2019t mean all the things you said to her, did you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I could feel the tightness in him lessening, the joints of his body loosening, yielding reluctantly to the persuasion of my fingers. \u201cNo, I didna mean it. Not all of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeither did she.\u201d</p><p>I waited a moment, stroking him as I had stroked Brianna, when she was small, and afraid.</p><p>\u201cYou can believe me,\u201d I whispered. \u201cI love you both.\u201d</p><p>He sighed, deeply, and was quiet for a moment.</p><p>\u201cIf I can find the man and bring him back to her. If I do\u2014d\u2019ye think she\u2019ll forgive me one day?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I said. \u201cI know it.\u201d</p><p>On the other side of the partition, I heard the small sounds of lovemaking begin; the shift and sigh, the murmured words that have no language.</p><p>\u201cYou have to go.\u201d Brianna had said to me. \u201cYou\u2019re the only one who can bring him back.\u201d</p><p>It occurred to me for the first time that perhaps she hadn\u2019t been speaking of Roger.</p><p>It was a long trek through the mountains, made longer by the winter weather. There were days when it was impossible to travel; when we crouched all day under rocky overhangs or in the shelter of a grove of trees, huddled against the wind.</p><p>Once we were through the mountains, the traveling was somewhat easier, though the temperatures grew colder as we headed north. Some nights we ate cold food, unable to keep a fire alight in snow and wind. But each night I lay with Jamie, closely huddled together within a single cocoon of furs and blankets, sharing our warmth.</p><p>I kept close count of the days, marking them by means of a length of knotted twine. We had left River Run in early January; it was mid-February before Onakara pointed out to us the smoke rising in the distance that marked the Mohawk village where he and his companions had taken Roger Wakefield. \u201cSnake-town,\u201d he said it was called.</p><p>Six weeks, and Brianna would be nearly six months gone. If we could get Roger back quickly\u2014and if he was capable of travel, I added grimly to myself\u2014we should be back well before the child was due. If Roger wasn\u2019t here, though\u2014if the Mohawk had sold him elsewhere...or if he was dead\u2014said a small cold voice inside my head, we would return without delay. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Onakara declined to accompany us into the village, which did absolutely nothing to increase my confidence in our prospects. Jamie thanked him and saw him off, with one of the horses, a good knife, and a flask of whisky in payment for his services.</p><p>We buried the rest of the whisky, hiding it carefully some distance outside the village.</p><p>\u201cWill they understand what we want?\u201d I asked, as we remounted. \u201cIs Tuscarora close enough to Mohawk for us to talk to them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s no quite the same, Auntie, but close,\u201d Ian said. It was snowing lightly, and the flakes clung melting to his eyelashes. \u201cLike the differences between Italian and Spanish, maybe. But Onakara says that the sachem and a few others have a bit of English, though they mostly dinna choose to use it. But the Mohawk fought with the English against the French; there will be some who ken it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell, then.\u201d Jamie smiled at us and laid his musket across the saddle in front of him. \u201cLet\u2019s go and try our luck.\u201d</p><p>54</p><p>CAPTIVITY I</p><p>February 1770</p><p>He had been in the Mohawk village nearly three months, by the reckoning of his knotted string. At first he had not known who they were; only that they were a different kind of Indian than his captors\u2014and that his captors were afraid of them.</p> <p>He had stood numb with exhaustion while the men who had brought him talked and pointed. The new Indians were different; they were dressed for the cold, in fur and leather, and many of the men\u2019s faces were tattooed.</p><p>One of them prodded him with the point of a knife, and made him undress. He was forced to stand nak*d in the middle of a long wooden house while several men\u2014and women\u2014poked and jeered at him. His right foot was badly swollen; the deep cut had become infected. He could still walk, but each step sent jabs of pain through his leg, and he burned intermittently with fever.</p><p>They shoved him, pushing him to the door of the house. There was a lot of noise outside. He recognized the gauntlet; a double row of shouting savages, all armed with sticks and clubs. Someone behind poked him in the buttock with the point of a knife, and he felt a warm trickle of blood run down his leg. \u201cCours!\u201d they said. Run.</p><p>The ground was trampled, snow packed into grimy ice. It burned his feet as a shove in his back sent him staggering into pandemonium.</p><p>He stayed upright most of the way, lurching one way, then another, as the clubs struck him to and fro and sticks lashed at his legs and back. There was no way to avoid the blows. All he could do was keep going, as fast as possible.</p><p>Close to the end, a club swung straight and took him hard across the belly; he doubled over and another swatted him behind the ear. He rolled bonelessly into the snow, barely feeling the cold on his broken skin.</p> <p>A switch stung his legs, then lashed him hard just under the balls. He jerked his legs up in reflex, rolled again, and found himself on hands and knees, still somehow going, the blood from his nose and mouth mixing with the frozen mud.</p><p>He reached the end, and with the last blows still stinging on his back, grasped the poles of a longhouse and pulled himself slowly to his feet. He turned to face them, holding on to the poles to keep from falling. They liked that; they were laughing, with high-pitched yips that made them sound like a pack of dogs. He bowed low, and straightened up, head whirling. They laughed harder. He\u2019d always known how to please a crowd.</p><p>They took him inside then, gave him water to wash with, some food. They gave him back his ragged shirt and filthy breeches, but not his coat or shoes. It was warm in the house; there were several fires burning at intervals down the length of the long structure, each with its own open smokehole above. He crawled into a corner and fell asleep, his hand on the lumpy seam of his breeches.</p><p>After this reception, the Mohawk treated him with general indifference but no great cruelty. He was the slave of the longhouse, at the use of anyone who lived there. If he did not understand an order, they would show him\u2014once. If he refused or pretended not to understand, they beat him, and he refused no more. Still, he shared equally in their food and was given a decent place to sleep, at the end of the house.</p><p>As it was winter, the main work was in gathering wood and fetching water, though now and then a hunting party would take him along to help in butchering and carrying meat. The Indians made no great effort to communicate with him, but by careful listening he acquired a little of the language.</p><p>He began, with great caution, to try a few words. He chose a young girl to begin with, feeling her less dangerous. She stared at him, then laughed, delighted as if she had heard a crow talk. She called a friend to come and hear, and another, and the three of them crouched in front of him, laughing softly behind their hands and looking sideways at him from the corners of their eyes. He said all the words he knew, pointing at the objects\u2014fire, pot, blanket, corn\u2014then pointed at a string of dried fish overhead and raised his eyebrows.</p><p>\u201cYona\u2019kensyonk,\u201d said his new friend promptly, and giggled when he repeated it. Over the next days and weeks, the girls taught him a great deal; it was from them that he finally learned where he was. Or not where, precisely, but in whose hands.</p><p>They were Kahnyen\u2019kehaka, they told him proudly, with looks of surprise that he did not know that. Mohawk. Keepers of the Eastern Gate of the Iroquois League. He, on the other hand, was Kakonhoaerhas. It took a certain amount of discussion to determine the exact meaning of this term; he finally discovered, when one of the girls dragged in a mongrel in illustration, that it meant \u201cdogface.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThanks,\u201d he said, fingering the thick growth of his beard. He bared his teeth at them and growled, and they shrieked with laughter.</p><p>One of the girls\u2019 mothers became interested; seeing that his foot was still swollen, she brought ointment and bathed it, bandaging it for him with lichen and corn husks. The women began to speak to him when he brought them wood or water.</p><p>He made no attempt at escape; not yet. Winter kept its grip on the village, with frequent snows and bitter wind. He wouldn\u2019t get far, unarmed, lame, and with no protection from the weather. He bided his time. And he dreamed at night of lost worlds, waking often in the dawn to the smell of fresh grass, with the ache of his need spilled warm on his belly.</p><p>The edges of the river were still frozen when the Jesuit came.</p><p>Roger had the run of the village; he was outside when the dogs began to bark and yelps from the sentries signaled the arrival of visitors. People began to gather, and he went with them, curious.</p><p>The new arrivals were a large group of Mohawk, men and women both, all on foot, burdened with the usual bundles of traveling gear. That seemed odd; such visitors as had come to the village before were small hunting parties. What was odder was that the visitors had with them a white man\u2014the pale winter sun gleamed on the man\u2019s fair hair.</p><p>Roger moved closer, eager to see, but was shoved back by some of the villagers. Not before seeing that the man was a priest, though; the tattered remnants of a long black robe showed beneath a bearskin cape, over leather leggings and moccasins.</p><p>The priest didn\u2019t act like a prisoner, nor was he bound. And yet Roger had the feeling that he traveled under compulsion; there were lines of strain in an otherwise young face. The priest and several of his companions disappeared into the longhouse where the sachem held council; Roger had never been inside, but had heard the women talk.</p><p>One of the older women from his own longhouse saw him loitering in the crowd, and ordered him sharply to fetch more wood. He went, and didn\u2019t see the priest again, though the faces of the new arrivals showed in the village, scattered among the longhouses to share the hospitality of their hearths.</p><p>Something was happening in the village; he could feel the currents of it eddying around him but did not understand them. The men sat later by the fires in the evenings, talking, and the women murmured to each other as they worked, but the discussion was far beyond the grasp of Roger\u2019s rudimentary comprehension. He asked one of the little girls about the new visitors; she could tell him only that they came from a village to the north\u2014why they had come, she did not know, save it had to do with the Black Robe, the Kahontsi\u2019yatawi.</p><p>It was more than a week later that Roger went out with a hunting party. The weather was cold but clear, and they traveled far, eventually finding and killing a moose. Roger was stunned, not only by the size of the thing but by its stupidity. He could understand the attitude of the hunters: There was no honor in killing such a thing; it was only meat.</p><p>It was a lot of meat. He was burdened like a pack mule, and the extra weight bore hard on his lame foot; by the time they returned to the village, he was limping so badly that he couldn\u2019t keep up with the hunting party, but lagged far behind, desperately trying to keep them in view lest he be lost in the forest.</p><p>To his surprise, several men were waiting for him when he finally limped into view of the village palisades. They grabbed him, relieved him of the burden of meat, and hustled him into the village. They didn\u2019t take him to his own longhouse, but to a small hut that stood at the far end of the central clearing.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t enough Mohawk to ask questions, and didn\u2019t think they would be answered in any case. They shoved him inside the hut, and left him.</p><p>There was a small fire burning, but the interior was so dark after the brightness of the day outside that he was momentarily blinded.</p><p>\u201cWho are you?\u201d said a startled voice in French.</p><p>Roger blinked several times, and made out a slight figure rising from its seat beside the fire. The priest.</p><p>\u201cRoger MacKenzie,\u201d he said. \u201cEt vous\u201d He experienced a sudden and unexpected flood of happiness at the simple speaking of his name. The Indians didn\u2019t care what his name was; they called him dogface when they wanted him.</p><p>\u201cAlexandre.\u201d The priest came forward, looking both pleased and incredulous. \u201cP\u00e8re Alexandre Ferigault. Vous \u00eates anglais?\u201d</p><p>\u201cScots,\u201d said Roger, and sat down suddenly, his lame leg giving way.</p><p>\u201cA Scotsman? How do you come here? You are a soldier?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA prisoner.\u201d</p><p>The priest squatted by him, looking him over curiously. He was fairly young\u2014in his late twenties or early thirties, though his fair skin was chapped and weathered by the cold.</p><p>\u201cYou will eat with me?\u201d He gestured to a small collection of clay pots and baskets that held food and water.</p><p>Speaking in his own language seemed to be as much a relief for the priest as speaking freely was for Roger. By the time the meal was concluded, they had gleaned a cautious knowledge of each other\u2019s basic past\u2014if no explanation as yet for their present situation.</p><p>\u201cWhy have they put me here with you?\u201d Roger asked, wiping grease from his mouth. He didn\u2019t think it was to provide the priest with company. Thoughtfulness was not an outstanding Mohawk characteristic, so far as he\u2019d noticed.</p><p>\u201cI cannot say. I was in fact astonished to see another white man.\u201d</p><p>Roger glanced at the door of the hut. It moved slightly; there was someone outside.</p><p>\u201cAre you a prisoner?\u201d he asked, in some surprise. The priest hesitated, then shrugged, with a small smile.</p><p>\u201cI cannot say that, either. With the Mohawk, one is Kahnyen\u2019kehaka or one is\u2014other. And if one is other, the line between guest and prisoner can alter in a moment. Leave it that I have lived among them for several years\u2014but I have not been adopted into the tribe. I am still \u2018other.\u2019 \u201d He coughed and changed the subject. \u201cHow did you come to be taken captive?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Roger hesitated, not really knowing how to answer.</p><p>\u201cI was betrayed,\u201d he said at last. \u201cSold.\u201d</p><p>The priest nodded sympathetically.</p><p>\u201cIs there anyone who might ransom you? They will take care to keep you alive if they have some hope of ransom.\u201d</p> <p>Roger shook his head, feeling hollow as a drum.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no one.\u201d</p><p>Conversation ceased as the light from the smokehole dimmed into dusk, leaving them in darkness below. There was a firepit, but no wood; the fire died out. The hut seemed to have been abandoned; there was a bed frame built of poles, but nothing else in the hut save a couple of tattered deerskins and a small heap of domestic debris in one corner.</p><p>\u201cHave you been here\u2014in this hut\u2014long?\u201d Roger asked at last, breaking the silence. He could barely see the other man, though the last remnants of twilight were visible through the smokehole.</p><p>\u201cNo. They brought me here today\u2014shortly before you came.\u201d The priest coughed, shifting uneasily on the packed dirt floor.</p> <p>That seemed sinister, but Roger thought it more tactful\u2014and less frightening\u2014not to mention it. It was no doubt as obvious to the priest as to himself that the line between \u201cguest\u201d and \u201cprisoner\u201d had been crossed. What had the man done?</p><p>\u201cYou are a Christian?\u201d Alexandre broke the silence abruptly.</p><p>\u201cYes. My father was a minister.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh. May I ask\u2014if they take me away, will you pray for me?\u201d</p><p>Roger felt a sudden chill that had nothing to do with the cheerless surroundings.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he said awkwardly. \u201cOf course. If you like.\u201d</p> <p>The priest rose and began to walk restlessly about the confines of the hut, unable to keep still.</p><p>\u201cIt may be all right,\u201d he said, but it was the voice of a man trying to convince himself. \u201cThey are still deciding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDeciding what?\u201d</p><p>He felt rather than saw the priest\u2019s shrug.</p><p>\u201cWhether I live.\u201d</p><p>There seemed no good response to that, and they fell once more into silence. Roger sat huddled by the cold firepit, resting his lame foot, while the priest paced to and fro, finally settling beside him. Without comment, the two moved close together, pooling their warmth; it was going to be a cold night.</p><p>Roger had dozed off, one of the deerskins pulled over him, when there was a sudden noise at the door. He sat up, blinking, to a blaze of fire.</p><p>There were four Mohawk warriors in the hut; one dumped a load of wood into the firepit and thrust the brand he held into the pile. Ignoring Roger, the others pulled P\u00e8re Ferigault to his feet and roughly stripped him of his clothes.</p> <p>Roger moved instinctively, half rising, and was knocked flat. The priest gave him a quick, open-eyed look that begged him not to interfere.</p><p>One of the warriors held his own brand close to P\u00e8re Ferigault\u2019s face. He said something that sounded like a question, then, receiving no answer, passed his brand downward, so close to the priest\u2019s body that the white skin glowed red.</p><p>Sweat stood out on Alexandre\u2019s face as the fire hovered near his gen**als, but his face remained carefully blank. The warrior with the brand poked it suddenly at the priest, who could not keep from flinching. The Indians laughed, and did it again. This time he was prepared; Roger smelled singed hair, but the priest didn\u2019t move.</p><p>Tiring of this sport, two of the warriors seized the priest by the arms, and dragged him out of the hut.</p><p>If they take me away\u2014pray for me. Roger sat up slowly, the hairs on his body prickling with dread. He could hear the voices of the Indians, talking among themselves, receding in the distance; no sound from the priest.</p><p>Alexandre\u2019s discarded clothes were flung around the hut; Roger picked them up, carefully beating the dust from them and folding them. His hands were shaking.</p><p>He tried to pray, but found it hard to focus his mind upon devotion. Over and around the words of his prayer, he could hear a small, cold voice, saying, And when they come to take me away\u2014who will pray for me?</p><p>They had left him a fire; he tried to believe that meant that they did not mean to kill him right away. The granting of comforts to a condemned prisoner was not the Mohawk way, either. After a time he lay down under the deerskins, curled on his side, and watched the flames until he fell asleep, worn out by terror.</p><p>He was roused from uneasy sleep by the shuffle of feet and many voices. He sprang awake, rolled away from the fire and crouched, looking frantically for some means of defense.</p><p>The door flap lifted, and the nak*d body of the priest fell into the hut. The noises outside moved away.</p><p>Alexandre stirred and moaned. Roger came quickly and knelt by him. He could smell fresh blood, a hot-copper smell he recognized from the slaughtering of the moose.</p><p>\u201cAre you hurt? What have they done?\u201d</p><p>The answer to that was quick in coming. He turned the half-conscious priest over, to see blood streaming over face and neck in a shiny red glaze. He snatched the priest\u2019s discarded robe to stanch the wound, pushed back the matted blond hair, and found that the priest\u2019s right ear was missing. Something sharp had taken a patch of skin some three inches square from just behind the jaw, removing both ear and a section of scalp.</p><p>Roger clenched his stomach muscles and pressed the cloth tight against the raw wound. Holding it in place, he dragged the limp body to the fire, and piled the remnants of clothes and both deerskins on top of P\u00e8re Ferigault.</p><p>The man was moaning now. Roger washed his face, made him drink a little water.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right,\u201d he muttered, over and over, though he was uncertain whether the other could hear him. \u201cIt\u2019s all right, they didn\u2019t kill you.\u201d He couldn\u2019t help wondering whether it might have been better if they had; did they mean this only as a warning to the priest, or was it only the preliminary to greater tortures?</p><p>The fire had burned itself to coals; in the reddish light, the seeping blood was black.</p><p>Father Alexandre moved constantly in small jerks, the restlessness of his body at once caused and constrained by the pain of his wound. He could not by any means settle to sleep, and consequently neither could Roger, nearly as aware as the priest of each interminably passing minute.</p><p>Roger cursed himself for helplessness; he would have given anything to assuage the other man\u2019s pain, even for a moment. It wasn\u2019t merely sympathy, and he knew it; Father Alexandre\u2019s small, breathless sounds kept the knowledge of the mutilation fresh in Roger\u2019s mind, and terror alive in his blood. If the priest could only sleep, the sounds would stop\u2014and perhaps in the darkness, the horror would recede a bit.</p><p>For the first time, he thought he understood what it was that made Claire Randall tick; made her walk onto battlefields, to lay her hands on wounded men. To ease pain and death in another was to soothe the fear of it in oneself\u2014and to soothe his own fear, he would do almost anything.</p><p>At last, unable to bear the whispered prayers and stifled whimpering any longer, he lay down beside the priest, and took Alexandre in his arms.</p><p>\u201cHush,\u201d he said, his lips close to P\u00e8re Alexandre\u2019s head. He hoped he had the side with the ear. \u201cBe still now. Reposez-vous.\u201d</p><p>The priest\u2019s lean body quivered against his own, the muscles knotted with cold and agony. Roger rubbed the man\u2019s back briskly, chafed his palms over the chilled limbs, and pulled both tattered deerskins over them.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be all right.\u201d Roger spoke in English, aware that it didn\u2019t matter what he said, only that he said something. \u201cHere now, it\u2019s all right. Yes, go on, then.\u201d He talked as much to distract himself as the other man; the feel of Alexandre\u2019s nak*d body was vaguely shocking\u2014as much because it didn\u2019t feel unnatural as because it did.</p><p>The priest clung to him, head pressed into his shoulder. He said nothing, but Roger could feel the wetness of tears against his skin. He made himself hug the priest tightly, rubbing up and down the spine with its small lumps of knobby bone, forcing himself to think only of stopping the terrible shaking.</p><p>\u201cYou could be a dog,\u201d Roger said. \u201cA mistreated stray of some kind. I\u2019d do it if you were a dog, of course I would. No, I wouldn\u2019t,\u201d he muttered to himself. \u201cCall the ruddy RSPCA, I expect.\u201d</p><p>He patted Alexandre\u2019s head, careful where his fingers went, cold with gooseflesh at the thought of touching that raw, bloody patch by inadvertence. The hair at the priest\u2019s nape was lank with sweat, though the flesh of his neck and shoulders was like ice. His lower body was warmer, but not by much.</p><p>\u201cNobody\u2019d treat a dog like this,\u201d he muttered. \u201cFucking savages. Set the police onto them. Put their bloody pictures in the Times. Complain to my MP.\u201d</p><p>A small ripple of something too frightened to be called laughter went through him. He gripped the priest fiercely, and rocked him to and fro in darkness.</p><p>\u201cReposez-vous, mon ami. C\u2019est bien, l\u00e0, c\u2019est bien.\u201d</p><p>55</p><p>CAPTIVITY II</p><p>River Run, March 1770</p><p>Brianna rolled the wet brush along the edge of the palette, squeezing out the excess turps to form a good point. She touched the point briefly to the viridian-cobalt mix and added a fine line of shadow to the river\u2019s edge.</p><p>There were footsteps on the path behind her, coming from the house. She recognized the arrythmic double step; it was the Deadly Duo. She tensed slightly, fighting the urge to snatch the wet canvas and put it out of sight behind Hector Cameron\u2019s mausoleum. She didn\u2019t mind Jocasta, who often came to sit with her while she painted in the mornings, to discuss techniques of painting, grinding pigments, and the like. In fact, she welcomed her great-aunt\u2019s company and treasured the older woman\u2019s stories of her girlhood in Scotland, of Brianna\u2019s grandmother, and of the other MacKenzies of Leoch. But when Jocasta brought her faithful Seeing-eye Dog along, it was a different matter.</p><p>\u201cGood morning, Niece! Is it not too cold for you the morn?\u201d</p><p>Jocasta halted, her own cloak drawn around her, and smiled at Brianna. If she hadn\u2019t known better, she wouldn\u2019t have realized her aunt\u2019s blindness.</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s fine here; the...er...tomb blocks the wind. I\u2019m finished for now, though.\u201d She wasn\u2019t, but stabbed her brush into the turpentine jar and began to scrape the palette. Damned if she\u2019d paint with Ulysses describing her every brushstroke out loud.</p><p>\u201cAh? Well, leave your things, then; Ulysses will take them up for you.\u201d</p><p>Reluctantly abandoning her easel, Brianna picked up her private sketchbook and tucked it under one arm, giving her other to Jocasta. She wasn\u2019t leaving that for Mr. Sees-all, Tells-all to flip through.</p><p>\u201cWe have company today,\u201d Jocasta said, turning back toward the house. \u201cJudge Alderdyce, from Cross Creek, and his mother. I thought perhaps ye\u2019d wish time to change, before luncheon.\u201d Brianna bit the inside of her cheek, to prevent any rejoinder to this less than subtle hint. More visitors.</p><p>Under the circumstances, she could scarcely refuse to meet her aunt\u2019s guests\u2014or even to change clothes for them\u2014but she could have wished that Jocasta were a good deal less sociable. There was a constant stream of visitors; for luncheon, for tea, for supper, overnight, for breakfast, come to buy horses, sell cows, trade lumber, borrow books, bring gifts, play music. They came from neighboring plantations, from Cross Creek, and from as far away as Edenton and New Bern. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The array of Jocasta\u2019s acquaintance was staggering. Still, Brianna had noticed an increasing tendency of late for the callers to be men. Single men.</p><p>Phaedre verified Brianna\u2019s suspicions, voiced as the maid dug in the wardrobe for a fresh morning gown.</p><p>\u201cThere ain\u2019t a lot of single women in the colony,\u201d Phaedre observed, when Brianna mentioned the peculiar coincidence that most of the recent visitors appeared to be bachelors. Phaedre cast an eye at Brianna\u2019s midsection, which was bulging noticeably under the loose muslin shift. \u201c \u2019Specially not young ones. To say nothing of women who\u2019s got River Run a-coming to them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s got what?\u201d Brianna said. She stopped, hair half pinned, and stared at the maid.</p> <p>Phaedre laid one graceful hand across her mouth, eyes wide above it.</p><p>\u201cYour auntie ain\u2019t told you yet? Thought sure you knew, or I\u2019d not\u2019ve said.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, now you\u2019ve said that much, go on saying. What do you mean?\u201d Phaedre, a born gossip, took little coaxing.</p><p>\u201cYour daddy and them hadn\u2019t been gone but a week, before Miss Jo sent for Lawyer Forbes and had her will changed. When Miss Jo dies, they\u2019s some little bits of money goes to your daddy, and some personal things to Mr. Farquard and some of her other friends\u2014but everything else, that\u2019s yours. The plantation, the timber, the sawmill...\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I don\u2019t want it!\u201d</p> <p>Phaedre\u2019s elegantly lifted eyebrow expressed profound doubt, then dropped, dismissing it.</p><p>\u201cWell, it ain\u2019t what you want, I reckon. Miss Jo is kind of inclined to get what she wants.\u201d</p><p>Brianna laid the hairbrush down, slowly.</p><p>\u201cAnd just what does she want?\u201d she asked. \u201cDo you happen to know that, too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAin\u2019t any big secret. She wants River Run to last longer than she does\u2014and to belong to somebody from her blood. Seems sense to me; she got no children, no grandchildren. Who else is there to carry on after her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell...there\u2019s my father.\u201d</p> <p>Phaedre laid the fresh dress across the bed and frowned at it appraisingly, glancing back at Brianna\u2019s middle.</p><p>\u201cThis one going to last no more than another couple weeks, the way that belly\u2019s growing. Oh, yes, there\u2019s your daddy. She done tried to make him her heir, but the way I hears it, he wasn\u2019t havin\u2019 none of it.\u201d She pursed her lips in amusement.</p><p>\u201cNow there\u2019s a stubborn man for you. Go off into the mountains and live like a red man, just to keep from doing what Miss Jo want him to do. But Mr. Ulysses reckons your daddy had the right of it, at that. Be him and Miss Jo buttin\u2019 heads day and night, if he\u2019d a-stayed.\u201d</p><p>Brianna slowly twisted up the other side of her hair, but the hairpin slipped out again, letting it fall.</p><p>\u201cHere, you be lettin\u2019 me do that, Miss Bree.\u201d Phaedre slid behind her, pulled out the slipshod pinning, and began deftly to braid the sides of her hair.</p><p>\u201cAnd all these visitors\u2014these men\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMiss Jo out to pick you a good one,\u201d Phaedre assured her. \u201cYou can\u2019t run the place alone, no more than Miss Jo can. That Mr. Duncan, he\u2019s a godsend; don\u2019t know what she\u2019d do without him.\u201d</p><p>Sheer astonishment was giving way to outrage.</p> <p>\u201cShe\u2019s trying to pick a husband for me? She\u2019s showing me off like\u2014like some prize heifer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh.\u201d Phaedre appeared to see nothing wrong with this. She frowned, drawing a straying lock skillfully into the main braid.</p><p>\u201cBut she knows about Roger\u2014about Mr. Wakefield! How can she be trying to marry me off to\u2014\u201d</p><p>Phaedre sighed, not without sympathy.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t reckon she thinks they\u2019re going to find the man, tell you true. Miss Jo, she knows a bit about the Indians; we\u2019ve all heard Mr. Myers tell about the Iroquois.\u201d</p><p>It was chilly in the room, but prickles of sweat broke out along Brianna\u2019s hairline and jaw.</p><p>\u201cBesides,\u201d Phaedre went on, weaving a blue silk ribbon into the braid, \u201cMiss Jo don\u2019t know this Wakefield. Might be he\u2019d not be a good manager. Better\u2014she thinks\u2014to get you married to a man she knows will take good care of her place; add it to his own, maybe, make a truly grand place for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want a grand place! I don\u2019t want this place!\u201d Outrage in turn was giving way to panic.</p><p>Phaedre tied the end of the ribbon with a small flourish.</p><p>\u201cWell, like I say\u2014it ain\u2019t so much what you want. It\u2019s what Miss Jo wants. Now, let\u2019s try this dress.\u201d</p><p>There was a sound in the hallway, and Brianna hastily flipped the page of her sketchbook over, to a half-finished charcoal drawing of the river and its trees. The steps went by, though, and she relaxed, turning back the page.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t working; the drawing was complete. She only wanted to look at it.</p><p>She\u2019d drawn him in three-quarter profile, head turned to listen as he tuned his guitar strings. It was no more than a sketch, but it caught the line of head and body with a rightness that memory confirmed. She could look at this and conjure him, bring him close enough almost to touch.</p><p>There were others; some botched messes, some that came close. A few that were good drawings in themselves, but that failed to capture the man behind the lines. One or two, like this one, that she could use to comfort herself in the late gray afternoons, when the light began to fail and the fires burned low.</p><p>The light was fading over the river now, the water dimming from bright silver to the gentler glow of pewter.</p><p>There were others; sketches of Jamie Fraser, of her mother, of Ian. She had begun to draw them out of loneliness, and looked at them now with fear, hoping against hope that these fragments of paper were not the only remnants of the family she had known so briefly.</p><p>Tell you true, I don\u2019t reckon Miss Jo thinks they going to find the man...Miss Jo knows about Indians.</p><p>Her hands were damp; the charcoal smeared at the corner of a page. A soft step sounded just outside the parlor door, and she closed her book at once.</p><p>Ulysses came in, a lighted taper in his hand, and began to light the branches of the great candelabrum.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need to light all those for me.\u201d Brianna spoke as much from a desire not to disturb the quiet melancholy of the room as from modesty. \u201cI don\u2019t mind the dark.\u201d</p><p>The butler smiled gently and went on with his work. He touched each wick precisely, and the tiny flames sprang up at once, jinni called up by a magician\u2019s wand.</p><p>\u201cMiss Jo will be down soon,\u201d he said. \u201cShe can see the lights\u2014and the fire\u2014so she knows where she is in the room.\u201d</p><p>He finished and blew out the taper, then moved about the room in his usual soft-footed way, tidying the small disorder left by the afternoon guests, adding wood to the fire, puffing it into crackling life with the bellows.</p><p>She watched him; the small, precise movements of the well-kept hands, his complete absorption in the correct placement of the whisky decanter and its glasses. How many times had he straightened this room? Put back each piece of furniture, each tiny ornament precisely in its place, so that its mistress\u2019s hand would fall upon it without groping?</p><p>A whole life devoted to the needs of someone else. Ulysses could read and write both French and English; could reckon numbers, could sing and play the harpsichord. All that skill and learning\u2014used only for the entertainment of an autocratic old lady.</p><p>To say to one, \u201cCome,\u201d and he cometh, to say to another \u201cGo,\u201d and he goeth. Yes, that was Jocasta\u2019s way.</p><p>And if Jocasta had her way...she would own this man.</p><p>The thought was unconscionable. Worse, it was ridiculous! She shifted impatiently in her seat, trying to push it away. He caught the slight movement, and turned inquiringly, to see if anything was wanted.</p><p>\u201cUlysses,\u201d she blurted. \u201cDo you want to be free?\u201d</p><p>The moment the words were out, she bit her tongue, and felt her cheeks go red with mortification.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she said at once, and looked down at her hands, twisted in her lap. \u201cThat was a terribly rude question. Please forgive me.\u201d</p><p>The tall butler didn\u2019t say anything, but regarded her quizzically for a moment. Then he touched his wig lightly, as though to settle it in place, and turned back to his work, picking up the scattered sketches on the table and tapping them neatly into a stack.</p><p>\u201cI was born free,\u201d he said at last, so quietly that she wasn\u2019t sure she\u2019d heard him. His head was bent, eyes on the long black fingers that plucked the ivory counters from the game table and placed each one neatly in its box.</p><p>\u201cMy father had a tiny farm, not too far from here. But he died of a snake\u2019s bite, when I was six or so. My mother could not manage to keep us\u2014she was not strong enough for farming\u2014and so she sold herself, putting the money with a carpenter for my apprenticeship once I should come of age, that I might learn a useful trade.\u201d</p><p>He set the ivory box in its slot in the game table, and wiped away a crumb of tea cake that had fallen on the cribbage board.</p><p>\u201cBut then she died,\u201d he went on matter-of-factly. \u201cAnd the carpenter, instead of taking me as an apprentice, claimed that as I was the child of a slave, I was by law a slave myself. And so he sold me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut that\u2019s not right!\u201d</p><p>He looked at her in patient amusement, but didn\u2019t speak. And what had right ever had to do with it? his dark eyes said.</p><p>\u201cI was fortunate,\u201d he said. \u201cI was sold\u2014cheaply, for I was very small and puny\u2014to a schoolmaster, whom several plantation owners on the Cape Fear had hired to teach their children. He would ride from one house to another, staying in each for a week or a month, and I would go with him, perched behind him on the horse\u2019s rump, tending the horse when we stopped, and doing such small services as he required.</p><p>\u201cAnd because the journeys were long and tedious, he would talk to me as we rode. He sang\u2014he loved to sing, that man, and he had a most delightful voice\u2014\u201d To Brianna\u2019s surprise, Ulysses looked faintly nostalgic, but then he shook his head, recalling himself, and took out a cloth from his pocket, with which he wiped the sideboard.</p><p>\u201cIt was the schoolmaster who gave me the name Ulysses,\u201d he said, back turned to her. \u201cHe knew some Greek, and some Latin as well, and for his own amusement, he taught me to read, on the nights when darkness befell us and we were forced to encamp on the road.\u201d</p><p>The straight, lean shoulders rose in the faintest of shrugs.</p><p>\u201cWhen the schoolmaster died as well, I was a young man of twenty or so. Hector Cameron bought me, and discovered my talents. Not all masters would value such endowments in a slave, but Mr. Cameron was not a common man.\u201d Ulysses smiled faintly.</p><p>\u201cHe taught me to play chess, and would wager upon my success, playing against his friends. He had me taught to sing, and to play the harpsichord, that I might provide entertainment for his guests. And when Miss Jocasta began to lose her sight, he gave me to her, to be her eyes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat was your name? Your real name?\u201d</p><p>He paused, thinking, then gave her a smile that did not reach his eyes. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI am not sure that I remember,\u201d he said politely, and went out.</p><p>56</p><p>CONFESSIONS OF THE FLESH</p><p>He woke a little before dawn. It was still black dark, but the air had changed; the embers had burned to staleness and the forest\u2019s breath moved past his face.</p> <p>Alexandre was gone. He lay alone under the tattered deerskin, very cold.</p><p>\u201cAlexandre?\u201d he whispered hoarsely. \u201cP\u00e8re Ferigault?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am here.\u201d The young priest\u2019s voice was soft, somehow remote, though he sat no more than a yard away.</p><p>Roger rose up on one elbow, squinting. Once the sleep had left his eyes, he could see dimly. Alexandre was sitting cross-legged, his back very straight, his face turned up to the square of the smokehole overhead.</p><p>\u201cAre you all right?\u201d One side of the priest\u2019s neck was stained dark with blood, though his face\u2014what Roger could see of it\u2014seemed serene.</p> <p>\u201cThey will kill me soon. Perhaps today.\u201d</p><p>Roger sat up, clutching the deerskin to his chest. He was already cold; the calm tone of this froze him.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said, and had to cough to clear his throat of soot. \u201cNo, they won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Alexandre didn\u2019t bother contradicting him. Didn\u2019t move. He sat nak*d, oblivious of the cold morning air, looking up. At last he lowered his gaze, and turned his head toward Roger.</p><p>\u201cWill you hear my confession?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not a priest.\u201d Roger scrambled to his knees and scuffled across the floor, the skin held awkwardly before him. \u201cHere, you\u2019ll freeze. Get under this.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt does not matter.\u201d</p><p>Roger wasn\u2019t sure whether he meant being cold didn\u2019t matter, or whether Roger\u2019s not being a priest didn\u2019t matter. He laid a hand on Alexandre\u2019s bare shoulder. Whether it mattered or not, the man was cold as ice.</p><p>Roger sat down next to Alexandre, as close as could be managed, and spread the skin over them both. Roger could feel his own skin ripple into gooseflesh where the other man\u2019s icy skin touched him, but it didn\u2019t trouble him; he leaned closer, wanting urgently to give Alexandre some of his own warmth.</p><p>\u201cYour father,\u201d Alexandre said. He had turned his head; his breath touched Roger\u2019s face, and his eyes were dark holes in his face. \u201cYou told me he was a priest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA minister. Yes, but I\u2019m not.\u201d</p><p>He sensed, rather than saw, the other\u2019s small gesture of dismissal.</p><p>\u201cIn time of need, any man may do the office of a priest,\u201d Alexandre said. Cold fingers touched Roger\u2019s thigh, briefly. \u201cWill you hear my confession?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf that\u2019s\u2014yes, if you like.\u201d He felt awkward, but it couldn\u2019t hurt, and if it helped the other at all...The hut, and the village outside, were quiet around them. There was no sound but the wind in the pine trees.</p> <p>He cleared his throat. Did Alexandre mean to begin, or was he to say something first?</p><p>As though the sound had been a signal, the Frenchman turned to face him, bowing his head so the soft light smoothed the gold hair of his crown.</p><p>\u201cBless me, brother, for I have sinned,\u201d Alexandre said in a low voice. And with his head bowed, hands folded in his lap, he made confession.</p><p>Sent out from Detroit with an escort of Hurons, he had ventured down the river as far as the settlement of Ste. Berthe de Ronvalle, to relieve the elderly priest in charge of the mission, whose health had broken down.</p><p>\u201cI was happy there,\u201d Alexandre said, in the half-dreaming voice that men use for events that have taken place decades ago. \u201cIt was a wild place, but I was very young, and ardent in my faith. I welcomed hardship.\u201d</p><p>Young? The priest couldn\u2019t be much older than himself.</p><p>Alexandre shrugged, dismissing the past.</p><p>\u201cI spent two years with the Huron, and converted many. Then I went with a group of them to Ft. Stanwix, where there was a great gathering of the tribes of the region. There I met Kennyanisi-t\u2019ago, a war chief of the Mohawk. He heard me preach, and being moved of the Holy Spirit, invited me to return with him to his village.\u201d</p><p>The Mohawk were notoriously wary of conversion; it had seemed a heaven-sent chance. So P\u00e8re Ferigault had traveled down the river by canoe, in company with Kennyanisi-t\u2019ago and his warriors.</p><p>\u201cThat was my first sin,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cPride.\u201d He lifted one finger to Roger, as though suggesting that he keep count. \u201cStill, God was with me.\u201d The Mohawk had sided with the English during the recent French and Indian War, and were more than suspicious of the young French priest. He had persevered, learning the Mohawk language, that he might preach to them in their own tongue.</p><p>He had succeeded in converting a number of the village, though by no means all. However, among his converts was the war chief, so he was protected from interference. Unfortunately, the sachem of the village opposed his influence, and there was continued uneasiness between Christian and non-Christian in the village.</p><p>The priest licked dry lips, then picked up the water jar and drank.</p><p>\u201cAnd then,\u201d he said, taking a deep breath, \u201cthen I committed my second sin.\u201d</p><p>He had fallen in love with one of his own converts.</p><p>\u201cHad you had women, before\u2014?\u201d Roger choked off the question, but Alexandre answered quite simply, without hesitation.</p><p>\u201cNo, never.\u201d There was a breath there, not quite a laugh, of bitter self-mockery. \u201cI had thought I was immune to that temptation. But man is frail in the face of Satan\u2019s fleshly lures.\u201d</p><p>He had lived in the girl\u2019s longhouse for some months. Then, one morning, he had risen early, and going to the stream to wash, had seen his own reflection in the water.</p><p>\u201cThere was a sudden disturbance in the water, and the surface broke. A huge and gaping mouth rose through the surface, shattering the reflection of my face.\u201d</p><p>It had been no more than a rising trout, leaping for a dragonfly, but the priest, shaken by the experience, had seen it as a sign from God that his soul was in danger of being swallowed by the mouth of Hell. He had gone at once to the longhouse and removed his things, going to live alone in a small shelter outside the village. However, he had left his lover pregnant.</p><p>\u201cWas that what caused the trouble that brought you here?\u201d Roger asked.</p><p>\u201cNo, not in itself. They do not see matters of marriage and morality as we do,\u201d Alexandre explained. \u201cWomen take men as they will, and marriage is an agreement that endures so long as the partners are in amity; if they should fall out, then the woman may expel the man from her house\u2014or he may leave. The children, if there are children, stay with the mother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut then\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe difficulty was that I had always, as a priest, refused to baptize infants unless both parents were Christian and in a state of grace. This is necessary, you understand, if the child is to be raised in faith\u2014for the Indians are inclined otherwise to view the sacrament of baptism as no more than one of their pagan rituals.\u201d</p><p>Alexandre drew a deep breath.</p><p>\u201cAnd of course I could not baptize this child. This offended and horrified Kennyanisi-t\u2019ago, who insisted that I must do so. Upon my refusing, he ordered me to be tortured. My\u2014the girl\u2014interceded for me, and was abetted in this by her mother and several other influential persons.\u201d</p><p>Consequently the village had been torn by controversy and schism, and at last the sachem had decreed that they must take P\u00e8re Alexandre to Onyarekenata, where an impartial council might judge what must be done to restore the harmony amongst them.</p><p>Roger scratched at his beard;perhaps the Indian dislike of hairy Europeans was the association with lice.</p><p>\u201cI am afraid I don\u2019t quite understand,\u201d he said carefully. \u201cYou refused to baptize your own child because the mother was not a good Christian?\u201d</p><p>Alexandre looked surprised.</p><p>\u201cAh, non! She retains her faith\u2014though she would have every excuse if she did not,\u201d he added ruefully. He sighed. \u201cNo. I cannot baptize the child, not because of its mother\u2014but because its father is not in a state of grace.\u201d</p><p>Roger rubbed his forehead, hoping his face didn\u2019t betray his astonishment.</p><p>\u201cAh. Is this why you wished to make confession to me? That you might be restored to a state of grace, and thus able to\u2014\u201d</p><p>The priest stopped him with a small gesture. He sat quietly for a moment, slender shoulders slumped. He must have brushed his wound accidentally; the clotted mass had cracked, and blood was once more seeping slowly down his neck.</p><p>\u201cForgive me,\u201d Alexandre said. \u201cI should not have asked you; it was only that I was so grateful to be able to speak in my own language; I could not resist the temptation to ease my soul by telling you. But it is no good; there can be no absolution for me.\u201d</p><p>The man\u2019s despair was so plain, Roger laid a hand on the priest\u2019s forearm, wanting urgently to assuage it.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure? You said that in time of need\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is not that.\u201d He laid his hand on top of Roger\u2019s, squeezing tight, as though he might draw strength from the other\u2019s grip.</p><p>Roger said nothing. After a moment, Alexandre\u2019s head rose and the priest looked him in the face. The light outside had changed; there was a faint glow, a brightness in the air just short of light. His own breath rose white from his mouth, like smoke rising toward the hole above.</p><p>\u201cEven though I confess, I will not be forgiven. There must be true repentance in order to obtain absolution; I must reject my sin. And that I cannot do.\u201d</p><p>He fell silent. Roger didn\u2019t know whether to speak, or what to say. A priest, he supposed, would have said something like \u201cYes, my son?\u201d but he couldn\u2019t. Instead, he took Alexandre\u2019s other hand in his, and held it tightly.</p><p>\u201cMy sin was to love her,\u201d Alexandre said, very softly, \u201cand that I cannot stop.\u201d</p><p>57</p><p>A SHATTERED SMILE</p><p>Two Spears is agreeable. The matter must be spoken of before the Council, and accepted, but I think it will be done.\u201d Jamie slouched against a pine tree, slumping a little in exhaustion. We had been in the village for a week; he had been with the sachem of the village for the greater part of the last three days. I had barely seen him or Ian, but had been entertained by the women, who were polite but distant. I kept my amulet carefully out of sight.</p><p>\u201cThen they do have him?\u201d I asked, and felt the knot of anxiety that had traveled with me for so long begin to loosen. \u201cRoger\u2019s really here?\u201d So far, the Mohawks had been unwilling to admit either to Roger\u2019s continued existence\u2014or the alternative.</p><p>\u201cAye, well, as to that, the auld bugger\u2019s no admitting it\u2014for fear I should try to steal him away, I suppose\u2014but either he\u2019s here or he\u2019s not far off. If the Council approves the bargain, we\u2019ll exchange the whisky for the man in three days time\u2014and be off.\u201d He glanced at the heavy-laden clouds that hid the distant mountains. \u201cGod, I hope that\u2019s rain coming, and not snow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think there\u2019s any chance the Council won\u2019t agree?\u201d</p><p>He sighed deeply and ran a hand through his hair. It was unbound and fell rumpled over his shoulders; evidently the negotiations had been difficult. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAye, there\u2019s a chance. They want the whisky, but they\u2019re wary of it. Some of the older men will be against the bargain, for fear of the damage liquor might do to the folk; the younger men are all for it. Some in the middle say aye, take it; they can use the liquor in trade if they\u2019re fearful of using it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWakatihsnore told you all that?\u201d I was surprised. The sachem, Acts Fast, seemed much too cool and wily a customer for such openness.</p><p>\u201cNot him: wee Ian.\u201d Jamie smiled briefly. \u201cThe lad shows great promise as a spy, I will say. He\u2019s eaten at every hearth in the village, and he\u2019s found a lassie who\u2019s taken a great liking to him. She tells Ian what the Council of Mothers is thinking.\u201d</p><p>I hunched my shoulders and pulled my cloak tight around them; our perch on the rocks outside the village made us safe from interruption, but the price of visibility was exposure to the bitter wind.</p> <p>\u201cAnd what does the Council of Mothers say?\u201d A week spent in a longhouse had given me some idea of the importance of the women\u2019s opinions in the scheme of things; though they didn\u2019t make direct decisions about general affairs, very little would be done without their approval.</p><p>\u201cThey could wish I offered some ransom other than whisky, and they\u2019re none so sure about giving up the man; more than one lady has a small fancy for him. They wouldna mind adopting him into the tribe.\u201d Jamie\u2019s mouth twisted at that, and I laughed despite my worry.</p><p>\u201cRoger\u2019s a nice-looking lad,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve seen him,\u201d Jamie said shortly. \u201cMost of the men think he\u2019s an ugly, hairy bastard. Of course, they think that of me, too.\u201d One side of his mouth lifted reluctantly, as he brushed a hand over his jaw; knowing the Indians\u2019 dislike of facial hair, he was careful to shave every morning.</p><p>\u201cAs it is, that may be what makes the difference.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat, Roger\u2019s looks? Or yours?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe fact that more than one lady wants the bugger. Ian says his lassie says her aunt thinks it will make trouble to keep him; she\u2019s thinking better to give him back to us than to have ill-feeling amongst the women over him.\u201d</p><p>I rubbed my cold-reddened knuckles over my lips, trying to keep from laughing.</p><p>\u201cHas the men\u2019s Council any idea that some of the women are interested in Roger?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI dinna ken. Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause if they knew, they\u2019d give him to you for free.\u201d</p> <p>Jamie snorted at that, but gave me a reluctant lift of one eyebrow.</p><p>\u201cAye, maybe. I\u2019ll have Ian mention the matter among the young men. It canna hurt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said the women wished you would offer something instead of whisky. Did you mention the opal to Acts Fast?\u201d</p><p>He sat up straight at that, interested.</p><p>\u201cAye, I did. They couldna have been taken more aback had I pulled a snake from my sporran. They got verra excited\u2014angry and fearful both, and I think they might well have done me harm, save I\u2019d already mentioned the whisky.\u201d</p><p>He reached into the breast of his coat and drew out the opal, dropping it into my hand.</p><p>\u201cBest you take it, Sassenach. But I think you\u2019ll maybe not want to show it to anyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow odd.\u201d I looked down at the stone, its spiral petroglyph shimmering with color. \u201cSo it did mean something to them.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, that it did,\u201d he assured me. \u201cI couldna say what, but whatever it was, they didna like it a bit. The war chief demanded to know where I\u2019d got it, and I told them ye\u2019d found it. That made them back off a bit, but they were like a kettle on the boil over it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy are you wanting me to take it?\u201d The stone was warm from his body, and felt smooth and comfortable in my hand. Instinctively, my thumb ran round and round the spiraled carving.</p><p>\u201cThey were shocked when they saw it, as I said\u2014and then angry. One or two of them made as though to strike me, but they held back. I watched for a bit, wi\u2019 the stone in my hand, and I realized that they were afraid of it; they wouldna touch me while I held it.\u201d</p><p>He reached out and closed my fist around the stone.</p><p>\u201cKeep it by ye. If there should be danger, bring it out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re more likely to be in danger than I am,\u201d I protested, trying to hand it back.</p><p>He shook his head, though, the ends of his hair lifting in the wind.</p><p>\u201cNo, not now they ken about the whisky. They\u2019d not harm me until they\u2019ve heard where it is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut why should I be in any danger?\u201d The thought was disquieting; the women had been cautious but not hostile, and the men of the village had largely ignored me.</p><p>He frowned, and looked down toward the village. From here, little was visible save the outer palisades, with trails of smoke drifting above them from the unseen longhouses beyond.</p><p>\u201cI canna say, Sassenach. Only that I have been a hunter\u2014 and I have been hunted. Ye ken how when something strange is near, the birds stop singing, and there is a stillness in the wood?\u201d</p><p>He nodded toward the village, eyes fixed on the swirl of smoke as though some shape might emerge from it.</p><p>\u201cThere is a stillness there. Something is happening that I canna see. I dinna think it is to do with us\u2014and yet...I am uneasy,\u201d he said abruptly. \u201cAnd I have lived too long to dismiss such a feeling.\u201d</p><p>Ian, who joined us shortly at the rendezvous, seconded this opinion.</p><p>\u201cAye, it\u2019s like holding the edge of a fishing net that\u2019s underwater,\u201d he said, frowning. \u201cYe can feel the wriggling through your hands, and ye ken there\u2019s fish there\u2014but ye canna see where.\u201d The wind ruffled his thick brown hair; as usual, it was half plaited, with strands coming loose. He thumbed one absently behind an ear.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s something happening among the people; some disagreement, I think. And something happened last night, in the Council house. Emily willna answer me when I ask about it; she only looks away and tells me it\u2019s naught to do with us. But I think it is, somehow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEmily?\u201d Jamie lifted one eyebrow, and Ian grinned.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s what I call her for short,\u201d he said. \u201cHer own name\u2019s Wakyo\u2019teyehsnonhsa; it means Works with Her Hands. She\u2019s a rare carver, is wee Emily. See what she\u2019s made for me?\u201d He reached into his pouch and proudly displayed a tiny otter carved in white soapstone. The animal stood alert, head up and ready for mischief; just to look at it made me smile.</p><p>\u201cVerra nice.\u201d Jamie examined the carving with approval, stroking the sinuous curve of the body. \u201cThe lassie must like ye fine, Ian.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, well, I like her too, Uncle.\u201d Ian was very casual, but his lean cheeks were slightly redder than the cold wind could account for. He coughed and changed the subject slightly.</p><p>\u201cShe said to me that she thinks the Council might be swayed a bit in our favor, if ye were to give some of them a taste of the whisky, Uncle Jamie. If it\u2019s all right wi\u2019 you, I\u2019ll fetch up a cask and we\u2019ll have a wee ceilidh tonight. Emily will manage it.\u201d</p><p>Jamie lifted both eyebrows at that, but nodded after a moment.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll trust your judgment, Ian,\u201d he said. \u201cIn the Council House?\u201d</p><p>Ian shook his head.</p><p>\u201cNay. Emily says it will be better if it\u2019s done at the longhouse of her aunt\u2014auld Tewaktenyonh is the Pretty Woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs what?\u201d I asked, startled.</p><p>\u201cThe Pretty Woman,\u201d he explained, wiping his running nose on his sleeve. \u201cOne woman of influence in the village has it in her power to decide what\u2019s done wi\u2019 captives; they call her the Pretty Woman, no matter what she looks like. So ye ken, it\u2019s to our advantage if Tewaktenyonh can be convinced the bargain we offer is a good one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose to a captive that\u2019s been freed, the woman would seem beautiful, regardless,\u201d Jamie said wryly. \u201cAye, I see. Go ahead then; can ye fetch the whisky by yourself?\u201d</p><p>Ian nodded and turned to go.</p><p>\u201cWait a minute, Ian,\u201d I said, and held out the opal as he turned back to me. \u201cCould you ask Emily if she knows anything about this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, Auntie Claire, I\u2019ll mention it. Rollo!\u201d He whistled sharply through his teeth, and Rollo, who had been nosing suspiciously under a rock shelf, left off and bounded after his master. Jamie watched them go, a slight frown between his eyebrows.</p><p>\u201cD\u2019ye ken where Ian\u2019s spending his nights, Sassenach?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you mean in which longhouse, yes. If you mean in whose bed, no. I could guess, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmphm.\u201d He stretched and shook his hair back. \u201cCome on, Sassenach, I\u2019ll see ye back to the village.\u201d</p><p>Ian\u2019s ceilidh got underway soon after dark; the invited guests included the most prominent members of the Council, who came one at a time to Tewaktenyonh\u2019s longhouse, paying their respects to the sachem, Two Spears, who sat at the main hearth with Jamie and Ian flanking him. A slight, pretty girl, who I assumed must be Ian\u2019s Emily, sat quietly behind him, on the keg of whisky.</p><p>With the exception of Emily, women were not involved in the whisky-tasting. I had come along, though, to watch, and sat at one of the smaller hearths, keeping an eye on the proceedings while helping two of the women to braid onions, exchanging occasional politenesses in a halting mixture of Tuscarora, English, and French.</p><p>The woman at whose hearth I sat offered me a gourd of spruce beer and some kind of cornmeal mush as refreshment. I did my best to accept with cordiality, but my stomach was knotted too tightly to make more than a token attempt at eating.</p><p>Too much depended on this impromptu party. Roger was here; somewhere in the village, I knew it. He was alive; I could only hope he was well\u2014well enough to travel, at least. I glanced at the far end of the longhouse, at the largest hearth. I could see no more of Tewaktenyonh than the curve of a white-streaked head; a queer jolt went through me at the sight, and I touched the small lump of Nayawenne\u2019s amulet, where it hung beneath my shirt.</p><p>Once the guests were assembled, a rough circle was formed around the hearth, and the opened keg of whisky brought into the center of it. To my surprise, the girl also came into the circle, and took a place beside the keg, a dipping gourd in her hand.</p><p>After some words from Two Spears, the festivities commenced, with the girl measuring out portions of the whisky. She did this not by pouring the whisky into the cups, but by taking mouthfuls from the gourd, carefully spitting three mouthfuls into each cup before passing it to one of the men in the circle. I glanced at Jamie, who looked momentarily taken aback, but who politely accepted his cup and drank without hesitation.</p><p>I rather wondered just how much whisky the girl was absorbing through the lining of her mouth. Not nearly as much as the men, though I thought it might take quite a bit to lubricate Two Spears, who was a taciturn old bastard with a face like a dyspeptic prune. Before the party had got well underway, though, I was distracted by the arrival of a young boy, the offspring of one of my companions. He came in silently and sat down by his mother, leaning heavily against her. She looked sharply at him, then set down her onions and rose with an exclamation of concern. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The firelight fell on the boy, and I could see at once the peculiar hunched way he sat. I rose hastily to my knees, pushing aside the basket of onions. I knelt forward and took him by the other arm, turning him toward me. His left shoulder had been slightly dislocated; he was sweating, his lips pressed tightly together in pain.</p><p>I gestured to his mother, who hesitated, frowning at me. The boy made a small, whimpering noise, and she pulled him away, holding him tight. With sudden inspiration, I pulled Nayawenne\u2019s amulet from my shirt; she wouldn\u2019t know whose it was but might recognize what it was. She did; her eyes widened at the sight of the tiny leather bag.</p><p>The boy made no more noise, but I could see the sweat run down his hairless chest, clear in the firelight. I fumbled at the thong that held the pouch shut, digging inside for the rough blue stone. Pierre sans peur, Gabrielle had called it. The fearless stone. I took the boy\u2019s good hand and pressed the stone firmly into his palm, folding his fingers around it.</p><p>\u201cJe suis une sorciere,\u201d I said softly. \u201cC\u2019est medecine, la.\u201d Trust me, I thought. Don\u2019t be afraid. I smiled at him.</p> <p>The boy stared round-eyed at me; the two women at the hearth exchanged a look, then as one, looked toward the distant hearth where the old woman sat.</p><p>There was talk from the ceilidh; someone was telling an old story\u2014I recognized the rise and fall of the formal rhythms. I had heard Highlanders tell their stories and legends in Gaelic, in just that way; it sounded much the same.</p><p>The mother nodded; her sister went quickly down the length of the house. I didn\u2019t turn, but felt the stir of interest behind me as she passed the other hearths; heads were turning, looking toward us. I kept my eyes on the boy\u2019s face, smiling, holding his hand tightly in my own.</p><p>The sister\u2019s footsteps came softly behind me. The boy\u2019s mother reluctantly released her hold on him, leaving him to me. Permission had been received.</p><p>It was a simple matter to put back the joint; he was a small boy and the injury was minor. His bones were light under my hand. I smiled at him as I felt the joint, assessing damage. Then a quick bending of the arm, rotation of the elbow, whipping the arm upward\u2014and it was done.</p> <p>The boy looked intensely surprised. It was a most satisfactory operation, in that pain was relieved almost instantly. He felt his shoulder, then smiled shyly back at me. Very slowly, he opened his hand and held out the stone to me.</p><p>The minor sensation created by this occupied my attention for some time, with the women crowding close, touching the boy and peering at him, summoning their friends to stare at the murky sapphire. By the time I had attention to spare for the whisky party at the far hearth, the festivities were well advanced. Ian was singing in Gaelic, very off-key, accompanied in a haphazard way by one or two of the other men, who chimed in with the weird, high-pitched Haihai! that I had heard now and then among Nayawenne\u2019s people.</p><p>As though my thought had conjured her, I felt eyes on my back, and turned, to see Tewaktenyonh watching me steadily from her own hearth at the end of the longhouse. I met her eyes and nodded to her. She leaned across to say something to one of the young women at her hearth, who rose and came toward me, stepping carefully around a couple of toddlers playing under their family bed-cubicle.</p><p>\u201cMy grandmother asks if you will come to her.\u201d The young woman squatted beside me, speaking quietly in English. I was surprised, though not astonished, to hear it. Onakara had been right, some of the Mohawk had some English. They would not use it, though, except from necessity, preferring their own language.</p><p>I rose and accompanied her to Tewaktenyonh\u2019s hearth, wondering what necessity impelled the Pretty Woman. I had my own necessities; the thought of Roger, and of Brianna.</p><p>The old woman nodded to me, inviting me to sit down, and spoke to the girl, not taking her eyes off me.</p> <p>\u201cMy grandmother asks if she may see your medicine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d I could see the old lady\u2019s eyes on my amulet, watching curiously as I took out the sapphire. I had added to Nayawenne\u2019s woodpecker feather two of my own; a raven\u2019s stiff black wing quills.</p><p>\u201cYou are the wife of Bear Killer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. The Tuscarora call me White Raven,\u201d I said, and the girl jerked, startled. She translated quickly for her grandmother. The old lady\u2019s eyes flew wide and she glanced at me in consternation. Evidently this was not the most auspicious name she\u2019d ever heard. I smiled at her, keeping my mouth closed; the Indians usually bared their teeth only when laughing.</p><p>The old lady handed me back the stone, very gingerly. She studied me narrowly, then spoke to her granddaughter, not taking her eyes off me.</p><p>\u201cMy grandmother has heard that your man bears a bright stone also,\u201d the girl said, interpreting. \u201cShe would hear more of this; what it is like, and how you came to have it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s welcome to see it.\u201d The girl\u2019s eyes widened in surprise as I reached into the pouch at my waist and drew out the stone. I held out the opal to the old woman; she bent and peered closely at it, but made no move to take it from me.</p><p>Tewaktenyonh\u2019s arms were brown and hairless, wrinkled and smooth as weathered satinwood to the eye. But as I watched I saw the prick of goose-flesh rising, raising vanished hairs in vain defense. She\u2019s seen it, I thought. Or at least she knows what it is.</p> <p>I didn\u2019t need the interpreter\u2019s words; her eyes met mine directly and I heard the question clearly, for all that the words were strange.</p><p>\u201cHow did this come to you?\u201d she said, and the girl echoed it faithfully.</p><p>I let my hand lie open; the opal fit snugly in my palm, its weight belied by its colors, glimmering like a soap bubble in my hand.</p><p>\u201cIt came to me in a dream,\u201d I said at last, not knowing how else to explain.</p><p>The old woman\u2019s breath went out in a sigh. The fear didn\u2019t quite leave her eyes, but was overlaid with something else\u2014curiosity, perhaps? She said something, and one of the women at the hearth rose, digging in a basket under the bed frame at her back. She came back and bent by the old lady, handing her something.</p><p>The old lady began to sing, quietly, in a voice cracked with age, but still strong. She rubbed her hands together over the fire, and a shower of small brown particles rained down, only to rise up again at once as smoke, thick with the scent of tobacco.</p><p>It was a quiet night; I could hear the rise and fall of voices and loud laughter from the far hearth, where the men were drinking. I could pick out the odd word in Jamie\u2019s voice\u2014he was speaking French. Was Roger perhaps close enough to hear it too?</p><p>I took a deep breath. The smoke rose straight up from the fire in a thin white pillar, and the strong sweet scent of tobacco mingled with the smell of cold air, triggering incongruous memories of Brianna\u2019s high school football games; cozy scents of wool blankets and thermoses of cocoa, wisps of cigarette smoke drifting from the crowd. Farther back were other, harsher memories, of young men in uniform, in the shattered light of airfields, crushing out glowing fag ends and running to their battles, leaving no more of themselves behind than the smell of smoke on winter air.</p><p>Tewaktenyonh spoke, her eyes still on me, and the girl\u2019s soft voice chimed in.</p><p>\u201cTell me this dream.\u201d</p><p>Was it truly a dream I would tell her, or a memory like these, brought to life on the wings of smoke from a burning tree? It didn\u2019t matter; here, all my memories were dreams.</p><p>I told her what I could. The memory\u2014of the storm and my refuge among the red cedar\u2019s roots, the skull buried with the stone\u2014and the dream; the light on the mountain and the man with his face painted black\u2014making no distinction between them.</p><p>The old lady leaned forward, the astonishment on her features mirroring that of her granddaughter.</p><p>\u201cYou have seen the Fire-Carrier?\u201d the girl blurted. \u201cYou have seen his face?\u201d She shrank away from me, as though I might be dangerous.</p><p>The old lady said something peremptory; her startlement had faded into a piercing gaze of interest. She poked the girl, and repeated her question impatiently.</p><p>\u201cMy grandmother says, can you say what he looked like; what did he wear?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing. A breech-clout, I mean. And he was painted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPainted. How?\u201d the girl asked, in response to her grandmother\u2019s sharp question.</p><p>I described the body paint of the man I had seen, as carefully as I could. This wasn\u2019t difficult; if I closed my eyes, I could see him, as clearly as he had appeared to me on the mountainside.</p><p>\u201cAnd his face was black, from forehead to chin,\u201d I ended, opening my eyes.</p><p>When I described the man, the interpreter became visibly upset; her lips trembled, and she glanced fearfully from me to her grandmother. The old woman listened intently, though, her eyes searching, straining to discern meaning from my face before the slower words could reach her ears.</p><p>When I finished, she sat silent, dark eyes still fastened on my own. At last she nodded, reached up a wrinkled hand and took hold of the purple wampum strings that lay across her shoulder. Myers had told me enough so that I recognized the gesture. The wampum was her family record, badge of her office; speech made while holding it was tantamount to testimony made upon the Bible.</p><p>\u201cAt the feast of Green Corn, this many years ago\u201d\u2014the interpreter\u2019s fingers flashed four times\u2014\u201ca man came among us from the north. His speech was strange, but we could understand him; he spoke like Canienga, or maybe Onondaga, but he would not tell us his tribe or village\u2014only his clan, which was the Turtle.</p><p>\u201cHe was a wild man, but a brave one. He was a good hunter, and a warrior. Oh, a fine man; all the women liked to look at him, but we were afraid to come too close.\u201d Tewaktenyonh paused a moment, a far-off look in her eye that made me count back; she would have been a full-grown woman then, but perhaps young enough still to have been impressed by the frightening, intriguing stranger.</p><p>\u201cThe men were not so careful; men aren\u2019t.\u201d She gave a brief, sardonic glance at the ceilidh, growing louder by the minute. \u201cSo they would sit and smoke with him, and drink spruce beer and listen. He would talk from midday till the dark, and then again in the night by the fires. His face was always fierce, because he talked of war.\u201d</p><p>She sighed, fingers curling over the purple shell strands.</p><p>\u201cAlways war. Not against the frog-eaters of the next village, or the ones who eat moose dung. No, we must lift our tomahawks against the O\u2019seronni. Kill them all, he said, from the oldest to the youngest, from the Treaty Line to the big water. Go to the Cayuga, send messengers to the Seneca, let the League of the Iroquois go forth as one. Go before it is too late, he said.\u201d</p><p>One frail shoulder lifted, fell.</p><p>\u201c \u2018Too late for what?\u2019 the men asked. \u2018And why shall we make war for no cause? We need nothing this season; there is no war treaty\u2019\u2014this was before the Time of the French, you understand.</p><p>\u201c \u2018It is our last chance,\u2019 he said to them. \u2018Already it may be too late. They seduce us with their metal, bring us close to them in the hope of knives and guns, and destroy us for the sake of cooking pots. Turn back, brothers! You have left the ways of years too great to count. Go back, I say\u2014or you will be no more. Your stories will be forgotten. Kill them now or they will eat you.\u2019 </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAnd my brother\u2014he was sachem then, and my other brother war chief\u2014said that this was foolishness. Destroy us with tools? Eat us? The whites do not consume the hearts of their enemies, even in battle.</p><p>\u201cThe young men listened; they listen to anyone with a loud voice. But the older ones looked at the stranger with a narrow eye, and said nothing.</p><p>\u201cHe knew,\u201d she said, and the old lady nodded emphatically, speaking almost faster than her granddaughter could translate. \u201cHe knew what would happen\u2014that the British and the French would fight with each other, and would seek our help, each against the other. He said that that would be the time; when they fought each other, then we must rise up against them both and cast them out.</p><p>\u201cTawineonawira\u2014Otter-Tooth\u2014that was his name\u2014said to me, \u2018You live in the moment. You know the past, but you don\u2019t look to the future. Your men say, \u201cWe need nothing this season,\u201d and so they will not move. Your women think it is easier to cook in a iron kettle than to make clay pots. You don\u2019t see what will happen because of your laziness, your greed.\u2019</p> <p>\u201c \u2018It\u2019s not true,\u2019 I said to him. \u2018We are not lazy. We scrape hides, we dry the meat and the corn, we press the oil from sunflowers and put it in jars; we take heed for the next season\u2014always. If we didn\u2019t, we would die. And what have pots and kettles to do with it?\u2019</p><p>\u201cHe laughed at that, but his eyes were sad. He was not always fierce with me, you see.\u201d The young woman\u2019s eyes slid toward her grandmother at this, but then she looked away, eyes once more on her lap.</p><p>\u201c \u2018A woman\u2019s heed,\u2019 he said, and shook his head. \u2018You think of things to eat, what to wear. None of this matters. Men can\u2019t think of such things.\u2019</p><p>\u201c \u2018You can be Hodeenosaunee and think this?\u2019 I said. \u2018Where do you come from that you don\u2019t take heed of what the women think?\u2019</p><p>\u201cHe shook his head again and said, \u2018You cannot see far enough.\u2019 I asked him how far then did he see, but he would not answer me.\u201d</p> <p>I knew the answer to that, and my skin prickled with gooseflesh, too, in spite of the fire. I knew too bloody well how far he\u2019d seen\u2014and how dangerous the view was from that particular precipice.</p><p>\u201cBut nothing I said was any use,\u201d the old lady continued, \u201cnor what my brothers said. Otter-Tooth grew more angry. One day he came out and danced the war dance. He was painted\u2014his arms and legs were striped with red\u2014and he sang and shouted through the village. Everyone came out to watch, to see who would follow him, and when he drove his tomahawk into the war tree and shouted that he went to gain horses and plunder from the Shawnee, a number of the young men followed him.</p><p>\u201cThey were gone for the rising and setting of a moon, and came back with horses, and with scalps. White scalps, and my brothers were angry. It would bring soldiers from the fort, they said\u2014or revenge parties from the Treaty Line settlements, where they had taken the scalps.</p><p>\u201cOtter-Tooth answered boldly that he hoped this was so; then we would be forced to fight. And he said plainly that he would lead such raids again\u2014again and again, until the whole land was roused and we saw that it was as he said; that we must kill the O\u2019seronni or die ourselves.</p><p>\u201cNo one could stop him doing what he said, and there were a few of the young men whose blood was hot; they would follow him, no matter what anyone said. My brother the sachem made his medicine tent, and called the Great Turtle to counsel with him. He stayed in the tent for a day and a night. The tent shook and heaved, and voices came out of it, and the people were afraid.</p><p>\u201cWhen my brother came out of the tent, he said that Otter-Tooth must leave the village. He would do what he would do, but we would not let him bring destruction to us. He caused disharmony among the people; he must go.</p> <p>\u201cOtter-Tooth became more angry then than we had ever seen him. He stood up in the center of the village and he shouted until the veins stood out in his neck and his eyes were red with rage.\u201d The girl\u2019s voice dropped. \u201cHe shouted terrible things.</p><p>\u201cThen he became very quiet, and we were afraid. He said things that took the hearts from our bodies. Even those who had followed him were afraid of him, then.</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t sleep or eat. For all of a day, and all of a night, and all of the next day, he went on talking, walking round and round the village, stopping at the doors of the houses and talking, until the people in the house drove him away. And then he left.</p><p>\u201cBut he came back again. And again. He would go away, and hide in the forest, but then he would be back again, by the fires at night, thin and hungry, with his eyes glowing like a fox\u2019s, always talking. His voice filled the village at night, and no one could sleep.</p><p>\u201cWe began to know that he had an evil spirit in him; perhaps it was Atatarho, from whose head Hiawatha combed the snakes; perhaps the snakes had come to this man, looking for a home. Finally, my brother the war chief said that it must stop; he must leave or we would kill him.\u201d</p><p>Tewaktenyonh paused. Her fingers, which had stroked the wampum continuously, as though she drew strength from it for her story, were now still.</p><p>\u201cHe was a stranger,\u201d she said softly. \u201cBut he didn\u2019t know he was a stranger. I think he never understood.\u201d</p><p>At the other end of the longhouse the drinking party was growing riotous; all the men were laughing, rocking to and fro with mirth. I could hear the girl Emily\u2019s voice, higher, laughing with them. Tewaktenyonh glanced that way, frowning slightly.</p> <p>Mice were creeping briskly up and down my spine. A stranger. An Indian, by his face, by his speech; his slightly strange speech. An Indian\u2014with silver fillings in his teeth. No, he hadn\u2019t understood. He had thought they were his people, after all. Knowing what their future held, he had come to try to save them. How could he believe that they meant to do him harm?</p><p>But they had meant it. They stripped him, said Tewaktenyonh, her face remote. They tied him to a pole in the center of the village, and painted his face with an ink made from soot and oak galls.</p><p>\u201cBlack is for death; prisoners who are to be killed are always painted so,\u201d the girl said. One eyebrow lifted slightly. \u201cYou knew this when you met the man on the mountain?\u201d</p><p>I shook my head, mute. The opal had grown warm in my palm, slick with sweat.</p><p>They had tortured him for a time; prodding his nak*d body with sharpened sticks, and then with hot embers, so that blisters rose up and burst, and his skin hung in tatters. He stood this well, not crying out, and this pleased them. He seemed still strong, so they left him overnight, still tied to the pole.</p><p>\u201cIn the morning, he was gone.\u201d The old woman\u2019s face was smooth with secrets. If she had been pleased, or relieved, or distressed by the escape, no one would ever have known.</p><p>\u201cI said that they should not follow him, but my brother said it was no good; he would only come back again, if we did not finish the matter.\u201d</p><p>So a party of warriors left the village, on Otter-Tooth\u2019s track. Bloody as he was, it was not difficult to follow.</p><p>\u201cThey chased him to the south. They thought to catch him, time after time, but he was strong. He ran on. For four days, they followed him, and finally they caught him, in a grove of aspens, leafless in the snow and their branches white as finger bones.\u201d</p><p>She saw the question in my eyes at this, and nodded.</p><p>\u201cMy brother the war chief was there. He told me, afterward.</p><p>\u201cHe was alone, and unarmed. He had no chance, and knew it. But he faced them nonetheless\u2014and he talked. Even after one of the men had struck him in the mouth with a war club, he talked through the blood, spitting out words with his broken teeth.</p><p>\u201cHe was a brave man,\u201d she said, reflectively. \u201cHe didn\u2019t beg. He told them the same things he had said before, but my brother said this time it was different. Before, he had been hot as fire; dying, he was cold as snow\u2014and because they were so cold, his words terrified the warriors.</p><p>\u201cEven when the stranger lay dead in the snow, his words seemed to go on ringing in the warriors\u2019 ears. They lay down to sleep, but his voice talked to them in their dreams, and kept them from sleeping. You will be forgotten, he said. The Nations of the Iroquois will be no more. No one will tell your stories. Everything you are and have been will be lost.</p><p>\u201cThey turned toward home, but his voice followed them. At night, they could not sleep for the evil words in their ears. In the day, they heard cries and whispers from the trees along their trail. Some of them said it was only ravens calling, but others said no, they heard him plainly.</p><p>\u201cAt last, my brother said it was clear this man was a sorcerer.\u201d</p><p>The old lady glanced sharply at me. Je suis une sorciere, I\u2019d said. I swallowed, and my hand went to the amulet at my neck.</p><p>\u201cThe thing to do, my brother said, was to cut off his head, and then he would talk no more. So they went back, and they cut off his head, and tied it in the branches of a spruce. But when they slept that night, they still heard his voice, and they woke with shriveled hearts. The ravens had picked out his eyes, but the head still spoke.</p><p>\u201cOne man, very brave, said he would take the head, and bury it far away.\u201d She smiled briefly. \u201cThis brave man was my husband. He wrapped the head in a piece of deerskin, and he ran with it, far to the south, and the head still talking under his arm all the time, so he had to put plugs of beeswax in his ears. At last he saw a very big red cedar tree, and he knew this was the place, because the red cedar has a strong spirit for healing.</p><p>\u201cSo he buried the head under the tree\u2019s roots, and when he took the beeswax from his ears, he could hear nothing but the wind and water. So he came home, and no one has spoken the name of Otter-Tooth in this village, from that day until this one.\u201d</p><p>The girl finished this, eyes on her grandmother. Evidently this was true; she had never heard this story.</p><p>I swallowed, and tried to get a clear breath. The smoke had ceased to rise as she talked; it had gathered instead in a low cloud overhead, and the air was thick with narcotic perfume.</p><p>The hilarity from the drinking circle had lessened. One of the men got up and, stumbling, went outside. Two more lay on their sides by the fire, half asleep.</p><p>\u201cAnd this?\u201d I said, holding out the opal. \u201cYou\u2019ve seen it? It was his?\u201d</p><p>Tewaktenyonh reached out as though to touch the stone, but then drew back.</p><p>\u201cThere is a legend,\u201d the girl said softly, not taking her eyes from the opal. \u201cMagic snakes carry stones in their heads. If you kill such a snake and take the stone, it will give you great power.\u201d She shifted uneasily, and I had no trouble imagining with her the size of the snake that might have carried a stone like this.</p><p>The old lady spoke suddenly, nodding at the stone. The girl jumped, but repeated the words obediently.</p><p>\u201cIt was his,\u201d she said. \u201cHe called it his tika-ba.\u201d</p><p>I looked at the interpreter, but she shook her head. \u201cTika-ba,\u201d she said, enunciating clearly. \u201cThis is not an English word?\u201d</p><p>I shook my head.</p><p>Her story finished, the old woman sat back in her furs, watching me with deep speculation. Her eyes rested on the amulet around my neck. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhy did he speak to you? Why has he given you that?\u201d She nodded at my hand, and my fingers closed over the opal\u2019s curve in reflex.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d I said\u2014but she had taken me unaware; I had had no time to prepare my face.</p><p>She fixed me with a piercing look. She knew I was lying, all right\u2014and yet how could I tell her the truth? Tell her what Otter-Tooth\u2014whatever his real name\u2014had been? Much less that his prophecies were true.</p><p>\u201cI think perhaps he was a part of my...family,\u201d I said at last, thinking of what Pollyanne had told me about the ghosts of one\u2019s ancestors. There was no telling from where\u2014or when\u2014he had come; he must, I supposed, be an ancestor or a descendant. If not of me, then of someone like me.</p> <p>Tewaktenyonh sat up very straight at that, and looked at me in astonishment. Slowly the look faded, and she nodded.</p><p>\u201cHe has sent you to me to hear this. He was wrong,\u201d she declared, with confidence. \u201cMy brother said that we must not speak of him; we must let him be forgotten. But a man is not forgotten, as long as there are two people left under the sky. One, to tell the story; the other, to hear it. So.\u201d</p><p>She reached out and touched my hand, careful not to touch the stone. The glitter of moisture in her black eyes might have been from the tobacco smoke.</p><p>\u201cI am one. You are the other. He is not forgotten.\u201d</p><p>She motioned to the girl, who rose silently and brought us food and drink.</p> <p>When I rose finally to go back to the longhouse where we were lodged, I glanced toward the drinking party. The ground was littered with snoring bodies, and the keg lay empty on its side. Two Spears lay peacefully on his back, a beatific smile creasing the wrinkles of his face. The girl, Ian, and Jamie were gone.</p><p>Jamie was outside, waiting for me. His breath rose white in the night air, and the scents of whisky and tobacco wafted from his plaid.</p><p>\u201cYou seemed to be having fun,\u201d I said, taking his arm. \u201cAny progress, do you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think so.\u201d We walked side by side across the big central clearing to the longhouse where we were lodged. \u201cIt went well. Ian was right, bless him; now they\u2019ve seen this wee ceilidh did no harm, I think they\u2019ll maybe be disposed to make the bargain.\u201d</p><p>I glanced at the row of longhouses with their floating clouds of smoke, and the glow of firelight from smokeholes and doorways. Was Roger in one of them now? I counted automatically, as I did every day\u2014seven months. The ground was thawing; if we traveled partway by river, we could perhaps make the trip in a month\u2014six weeks at the most. Yes, if we left soon, we would be in time.</p><p>\u201cAnd you, Sassenach? Ye seemed to be having a most earnest discussion wi\u2019 the auld lady. Did she ken aught of that stone?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes. Come inside and I\u2019ll tell you about it.\u201d</p><p>He lifted the skin over the doorway, and I walked inside, the opal a solid weight in my hand. They hadn\u2019t known what he had called it, but I did. The man called Otter-Tooth, who had come to raise a war, to save a nation\u2014with silver fillings in his teeth. Yes, I knew what it was, the tika-ba.</p><p>His unused ticket back. My legacy.</p><p>58</p><p>LORD JOHN RETURNS</p><p>River Run, March 1770</p><p>Phaedre had brought a dress, one of Jocasta\u2019s, yellow silk, very full in the skirt.</p><p>\u201cWe got better company tonight than ol\u2019 Mr. Cooper or Lawyer Forbes,\u201d Phaedre said with satisfaction. \u201cWe got us a real live lord, how \u2019bout that?\u201d</p> <p>She let down a huge armload of fabric on the bed and began to pull bits and pieces from the frothing billows, issuing instructions like a drill sergeant.</p><p>\u201cHere, you strip off and put on these yere stays. You need somethin\u2019 strong, keep that belly pushed down. Ain\u2019t nobody but backcountry trash goes \u2019thout stays. Your auntie wasn\u2019t blind as a bat, she\u2019d \u2019a had you fitted out proper long since\u2014long since. Then put on the stockins and garters\u2014ain\u2019t those pretty? I always did like that pair with the little bitty leaves on \u2019em\u2014then we\u2019ll tie on the petticoats, and then\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat lord?\u201d Brianna took the proferred stays and frowned at them. \u201cMy God, what\u2019s this made of, whalebones?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh. Ain\u2019t no cheap tin or iron for Miss Jo, surely not.\u201d Phaedre burrowed like a terrier, frowning and muttering to herself. \u201cWhere that garter gone to?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need these. And what lord is it that\u2019s coming?\u201d</p><p>Phaedre straightened up, staring at Brianna over the folds of yellow silk.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t need \u2019em?\u201d she said censoriously. \u201cAnd you with a six-month belly? What you thinking of, girl, come into dinner all pooched out, and a lordship sittin\u2019 by the soup a-gogglin\u2019 at you through his eyeglass?\u201d</p><p>Brianna couldn\u2019t help smiling at this description, but replied with considerable dryness nonetheless.</p><p>\u201cWhat difference would it make? The whole county knows by now that I\u2019m having a baby. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if that circuit rider\u2014Mr. Urmstone, is it? didn\u2019t preach a sermon about me up on the Buttes.\u201d</p><p>Phaedre uttered a short laugh.</p><p>\u201cHe did,\u201d she said. \u201cTwo Sundays back. Mickey and Drusus was there\u2014they thought it was right funny, but your auntie didn\u2019t. She set Lawyer Forbes on to law him for the slander, but ol\u2019 Reverend Urmstone, he said \u2019twasn\u2019t slander if it was the truth.\u201d</p><p>Brianna stared back at the maid.</p><p>\u201cAnd just what did he say about me?\u201d</p><p>Phaedre shook her head and resumed her rummaging.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019 want to know,\u201d she said darkly. \u201cBut be that as it might, whether the county knows ain\u2019t the same thing as you flauntin\u2019 your belly through the dining room and leavin\u2019 his lordship in no doubt, so you put on them stays.\u201d</p><p>Her authoritative tone left no room for argument. Brianna struggled resentfully into the stiff garment, and suffered Phaedre to lace it tight. Her waist was still slender, and the remaining bulge in front would be easily disguised by the full skirt and petticoats.</p><p>She stared at herself in the mirror, Phaedre\u2019s dark head bobbing near her thighs as the maid adjusted the green silk stockings to her own satisfaction. She couldn\u2019t breathe, and being squeezed like that couldn\u2019t be good for the baby. The stays laced in front; as soon as Phaedre left, she\u2019d undo them. The hell with his Lordship, whoever he was.</p><p>\u201cAnd who is this lord we\u2019re having for dinner?\u201d she asked for the third time, stepping obediently into the billow of starched white linen the maid held for her.</p><p>\u201cThis be Lord John William Grey, of Mount Josiah plantation in Virginia.\u201d Phaedre rolled out the syllables with great ceremony, though seeming rather disappointed by the unfortunately brief and simple names of the lord. She would, Brianna knew, have preferred a Lord FitzGerald Vanlandingham Walthamstead if she could have got one.</p><p>\u201cHe a friend of your daddy\u2019s, or so Miss Jo says,\u201d the maid added, more prosaically. \u201cThere, that\u2019s good. Lucky you got nice bosoms, this dress is made for \u2019em.\u201d</p><p>Brianna hoped this didn\u2019t mean the dress wasn\u2019t going to cover her br**sts; the stays ended just beneath, pushing them up so that they swelled startlingly high, like something bubbling over the rim of a pot. Her n**ples stared at her in the mirror, gone a rich dark color, like raspberry wine.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t worry over which bulges she was exposing that made her oblivious to the rest of Phaedre\u2019s brisk ministrations, though; it was the maid\u2019s casual He a friend of your daddy\u2019s.</p><p>It was not a crowd; Jocasta seldom had crowds. Dependent on her ears for the nuances of social byplay, she would not risk commotion. Still, there were more people here in the drawing room than was usual; Lawyer Forbes, of course, with his spinster sister; Mr. MacNeill and his son, Judge Alderdyce and his mother, a couple of Farquard Campbell\u2019s unmarried sons. No one, though, resembling Phaedre\u2019s lordship.</p><p>Brianna smiled sourly to herself. \u201cLet \u2019em look, then,\u201d she murmured, straightening her back so that her bulge swelled proudly before her, glistening under the silk. She gave it an encouraging pat. \u201cCome on, Osbert, let\u2019s be social.\u201d</p><p>Her entrance was greeted by a general outcry of cordiality that made her mildly ashamed of her cynicism. They were kind men and women, including Jocasta; and the situation, after all, was none of their doing.</p><p>Still, she did enjoy the expression of mild shock that the Judge tried to hide, and the too-sweet smile on his mother\u2019s face, as her beady little parrot eyes registered the blatant fact of Osbert\u2019s unbound presence. Jocasta might propose, but the Judge\u2019s mother would dispose, no doubt of that. Brianna met Mrs. Alderdyce\u2019s eye with a sweet smile of her own.</p><p>Mr. MacNeill\u2019s weatherbeaten face twitched slightly with amusement, but he bowed gravely and asked after her health with no sign of embarrassment. As for Lawyer Forbes, if he noticed anything amiss in her appearance, he drew the veil of his professional discretion over it and greeted her with his customary suavity.</p><p>\u201cAh, Miss Fraser!\u201d he said. \u201cPrecisely whom we were wanting. Mrs. Alderdyce and myself have just been engaged in amiable dispute concerning a question of aesthetics. You, with your instinct for loveliness, would have a most valuable opinion, should you be willing to oblige me by giving it.\u201d Taking her arm, he drew her smoothly to his side\u2014away from MacNeill, who twitched a bushy brow at her but made no move to interfere.</p><p>He led her to the hearthside, where four small wooden boxes sat on the table. Ceremoniously removing the lids of these, the lawyer displayed in turn four jewels, each the size of a marrow-fat pea, each nestled in a pad of dark blue velvet, the better to set off its brilliance.</p><p>\u201cI think of purchasing one of these stones,\u201d Forbes explained. \u201cTo have made into a ring. I had them sent from Boston.\u201d He smirked at Brianna, plainly feeling that he had stolen a march on the competition\u2014and judging from the faint glower on MacNeill\u2019s face, he had.</p><p>\u201cTell me, my dear\u2014which do you prefer? The sapphire, the emerald, the topaz or the diamond?\u201d He rocked back on his heels, waistcoat swelling with his own cleverness.</p><p>For the first time in her pregnancy, Brianna felt a sudden qualm of nausea. Her head felt light and giddy, and her fingertips tingled with numbness.</p><p>Sapphire, emerald, topaz, diamond. And her father\u2019s ring held a ruby. Five stones of power, the points of a traveler\u2019s pentagram, the guarantors of safe passage. For how many? Without thinking, she spread a hand protectively over her belly.</p><p>She realized the trap Forbes thought he was luring her toward. Let her make a choice and he would present her with the unmounted stone on the spot, a public proposal that would\u2014he thought\u2014force her either to accept him at once, or cause an unpleasant scene by rejecting him outright. Gerald Forbes really knew nothing about women, she thought.</p><p>\u201cI\u2014ah\u2014I should not like to venture my own opinion without first hearing Mrs. Alderdyce\u2019s choice,\u201d she said, forcing a cordial smile and a nod toward the Judge\u2019s mother, who looked both surprised and gratified by being so deferred to. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Brianna\u2019s stomach clenched, and she surreptitiously wiped sweaty hands on her skirt. There they were, all together and in one place\u2014the four stones she had thought it would take a lifetime to find.</p><p>Mrs. Alderdyce was jabbing an arthritic finger at the emerald, explaining the virtues of her choice, but Brianna paid no attention to what the woman said. She glanced at Lawyer Forbes, his round face still reflecting smugness. A sudden wild impulse filled her.</p><p>If she said yes, now, tonight, while he still had all four stones...could she bring herself to that? Inveigle him, kiss him, lull him into complacency\u2014and then steal the stones?</p><p>Yes, she could\u2014and then what? Run off into the mountains with them? Leave Jocasta disgraced and the county in an uproar, run and hide like a common thief? And how would she get to the Indies before the baby came? She counted in her head, knowing it was insanity, but still\u2014it could be done.</p> <p>The stones glittered and winked, temptation and salvation. Everyone had come to look, heads bent over the table, murmuring their admiration, herself temporarily overlooked.</p><p>She could hide, she thought, the steps of the plan unfolding inevitably before her mind\u2019s eye, quite without her willing it. Steal a horse, head up the Yadkin valley into the backcountry. Despite the nearness of the fire, she shivered, feeling cold at the thought of flight through the winter snows. But her mind ran on.</p><p>She could hide in the mountains, at her parents\u2019 cabin, and wait for them to come back with Roger. If they came back. If Roger was with them. Yes, and what if the baby came first, and she was there on the mountain, all alone with no one at hand, and nothing to help but a handful of stolen brightness?</p><p>Or should she ride at once for Wilmington and find a ship to the Indies? If Jocasta was right, Roger was never coming back. Was she sacrificing her only chance at return to wait for a man who was dead\u2014or who, if not dead, might reject her and her child?</p><p>\u201cMiss Fraser?\u201d</p> <p>Lawyer Forbes was waiting, swollen with expectation.</p><p>She took a deep breath, feeling sweat trickle down between her br**sts, beneath the loosened stays.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re all very lovely,\u201d she said, surprised at how coolly she was able to speak. \u201cI could not possibly choose among them\u2014but then, I have no particular liking for gems. I have very simple tastes, I\u2019m afraid.\u201d</p><p>She caught the flicker of a smile on Mr. MacNeill\u2019s face, and the deep flush of Forbes\u2019s round cheeks, but turned her back on the stones with a polite word.</p><p>\u201cI think we will not wait dinner,\u201d Jocasta murmured in her ear. \u201cIf his Lordship should be delayed...\u201d</p><p>On cue, Ulysses appeared in the doorway, elegant in full livery, to announce dinner. Instead, in a mellifluous voice that carried easily over the chatter, he said, \u201cLord John Grey, ma\u2019am,\u201d and stepped aside.</p> <p>Jocasta breathed a sigh of satisfaction, and urged Brianna forward, toward the slight figure that stood in the doorway.</p><p>\u201cGood. You shall be his partner at dinner, my dear.\u201d</p><p>Brianna glanced back at the table by the hearth, but the stones were gone.</p><p>Lord John Grey was a surprise a surprise. She had heard her mother speak of John Grey\u2014soldier, diplomat, nobleman\u2014and expected someone tall and imposing. Instead, he was six inches shorter than she was, fine-boned and slight, with large, beautiful eyes, and a fair-skinned handsomeness that was saved from girlishness only by the firm set of mouth and jaw.</p><p>He had looked startled upon seeing her; many people did, taken aback by her size\u2014but then had set himself to exercise his considerable charm, telling her amusing anecdotes of his travel, admiring the two paintings that Jocasta had hung upon the wall, and regaling the table at large with news of the political situation in Virginia.</p><p>What he did not mention was her father, and for that she was grateful.</p><p>Brianna listened to Miss Forbes\u2019s descriptions of her brother\u2019s importance with an absent smile. She felt more and more as though she were drowning in a sea of kind intentions. Could they not leave her alone? Could Jocasta not even have the decency to wait a few months?</p><p>\u201c...and then there\u2019s the wee sawmill he\u2019s just bought, up to Averasboro. Heavens, how the man manages, I couldna tell you!\u201d</p> <p>No, they couldn\u2019t, she thought, with a kind of despair. They couldn\u2019t leave her alone. They were Scots, kindly but practical, and with an iron conviction of their own rightness\u2014the same conviction that had got half of them killed or exiled after Culloden.</p><p>Jocasta was fond of her, but clearly had made up her mind that it would be foolish to wait. Why sacrifice the chance of a good, solid, respectable marriage, to a will-o\u2019-the-wisp hope of love?</p><p>The horrible thing was that she knew herself it was foolish to wait. Of all the things she had been trying not to think of for weeks, this was the worst\u2014and here it was, rising up in her mind like the shadow of a dead tree, stark against snow.</p><p>If. If they came back\u2014if, if, IF. If her parents came back at all, Roger would not be with them. She knew it. They wouldn\u2019t find the Indians who had taken him\u2014how could they, in a trackless wilderness of snow and mud? Or they would find the Indians, only to learn that Roger was dead\u2014of injuries, disease, torture.</p><p>Or he would be found, alive, and refuse to come back, not wanting to see her ever again. Or he would come back, with that maddening sense of Scottish honor, determined to take her, but hating her for it. Or he would come back, see the baby, and...</p><p>Or none of them would come back at all. I will bring him home to you\u2014or I will not come home myself. And she would live here alone forever, drowned in the waves of her own guilt, her body bobbing in the swirl of good intentions, anchored by a rotting umbilical cord to the child whose dead weight had pulled her under.</p><p>\u201cMiss Fraser! Miss Fraser, are ye quite weel, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot very, no,\u201d she said. \u201cI think I\u2019m going to faint.\u201d And did, shaking the table with a crash as she fell forward into a whirling sea of china and white linen.</p><p>The tide had turned again, she thought. She was buoyed up on a flood of kindness as people bustled to and fro, fetching warm drinks and a brick to her feet, seeing her tucked up warmly on the sofa in the little parlor, with a pillow to her head and salts to her nose, a thick shawl round her knees.</p><p>At last they were gone. She could be alone. And now that the truth was out in her own mind, she could cry for all her losses\u2014for father and lover, family and mother, for the loss of time and place and all that she should have been and would never be.</p><p>Except that she couldn\u2019t.</p><p>She tried. She tried to summon up the sense of terror she had felt in the drawing room, alone among the crowd. But now that she truly was alone, paradoxically she wasn\u2019t afraid anymore. One of the house slaves popped a head in, but she waved a hand, sending the girl away again.</p><p>Well, she was Scottish, too\u2014\u201cWell, half,\u201d she muttered, cupping a hand over her belly\u2014and entitled to her own stubbornness. They were coming back. All of them; mother, father, Roger. If it felt as though that conviction were made of feathers rather than iron...still it was hers. And she was hanging on to it like a raft, until they pried her fingers off and let her sink.</p><p>The door to the small parlor opened, silhouetting the tall, spare figure of Jocasta against the lighted hall.</p><p>\u201cBrianna?\u201d The pale oval face turned unerringly toward the sofa; did she only guess where they had put her, or could she hear Brianna breathing?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here, Aunt.\u201d</p><p>Jocasta came into the room, followed by Lord John, with Ulysses bringing up the rear with a tea tray.</p><p>\u201cHow are you, child? Had I best send for Dr. Fentiman?\u201d She frowned, laying a long hand across Brianna\u2019s forehead.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Brianna had met Dr. Fentiman, a small, damp-handed golliwog of a man with a strong faith in lye and leeches; the sight of him made her shudder. \u201cEr...no. Thank you, but I\u2019m quite all right; I was just taken queer for a moment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, good.\u201d Jocasta turned blind eyes toward Lord John. \u201cHis Lordship will be going on to Wilmington in the morning; he wished to pay you his regards, if you are well enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, of course.\u201d She sat up, swinging her feet to the floor. So the lord wasn\u2019t going to linger; that would be a disappointment to Jocasta, if not to her. Still, she could be polite for a little while.</p><p>Ulysses set down the tray, and soft-footed out the door behind her aunt, leaving them alone.</p><p>He drew up an embroidered footstool and sat down, not waiting for invitation.</p><p>\u201cAre you truly well, Miss Fraser? I have no desire to see you prostrate among the teacups.\u201d A smile pulled at the corner of his mouth, and she flushed.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d she said shortly. \u201cDid you have something to say to me?\u201d</p><p>He wasn\u2019t taken aback by her abruptness.</p><p>\u201cYes, but I thought perhaps you would prefer that I not mention it in the midst of the company. I understand that you are interested in the whereabouts of a man named Roger Wakefield?\u201d</p><p>She had been feeling fine; at this, the wave of faintness threatened to return.</p><p>\u201cYes. How do you\u2014do you know where he is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He saw her face change, and took her hand between his. \u201cNo, I am sorry. Your father had written to me, some three months ago, asking me to assist him in finding this man. It had occurred to him that if Mr. Wakefield was anywhere in the ports, he might have been taken up by a press-gang, and thus be now at sea in one of His Majesty\u2019s ships. He asked if I would make use of my acquaintance in naval circles to determine whether such a fate had in fact befallen Mr. Wakefield.\u201d</p><p>Another wave of faintness passed over her, this one tinged with remorse, as she realized the lengths her father had gone to, in attempting to find Roger for her.</p><p>\u201cHe isn\u2019t on a ship.\u201d</p><p>He looked surprised at her tone of certainty.</p><p>\u201cI have found no evidence that he was impressed anywhere between Jamestown and Charleston. Still, there is the possibility that he was taken up on the eve of sailing, in which case his presence on the crew would not be registered until the ship reached port. That is why I travel tomorrow to Wilmington, to make inquiries\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need to. I know where he is.\u201d In as few words as possible, she acquainted him with the basic facts.</p><p>\u201cJamie\u2014your father\u2014that is, your parents\u2014have gone to rescue this man from the Iroquois?\u201d Looking shaken, he turned and poured two cups of tea, handing her one without asking if she wanted it.</p><p>She held it between her hands, finding a small comfort in the warmth; a greater comfort in being able to speak frankly to Lord John.</p><p>\u201cYes. I wanted to go with them, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I see.\u201d He glanced at her bulge and coughed. \u201cI collect there is some urgency in finding Mr. Wakefield?\u201d</p><p>She laughed, unhappily.</p><p>\u201cI can wait. Can you tell me something, Lord John? Have you ever heard of handfasting?\u201d</p><p>His fair brows drew together momentarily.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he said slowly. \u201cA Scottish custom of temporary marriage, is it not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. What I want to know is, is it legal here?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He rubbed his jaw, thinking. Either he\u2019d shaved recently or he had a light beard; late as it was, he showed no sign of stubble.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he said finally. \u201cI have never seen the question addressed in law. Still, any couple who dwells together as man and wife are considered married, by common law. I should think handfasting would fall into that class, would it not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt might, except that we\u2019re rather obviously not dwelling together,\u201d Brianna said. She sighed. \u201cI think I\u2019m married\u2014but my aunt doesn\u2019t. She keeps insisting that Roger won\u2019t come back, or that if he does, I\u2019m still not legally bound to him. Even by the Scots custom, I\u2019m not bound beyond a year and a day. She wants to pick a husband for me\u2014and God, she\u2019s trying! I thought you were the newest candidate, when you showed up.\u201d</p><p>Lord John looked amused at the idea.</p> <p>\u201cOh. That would explain the oddly assorted company at dinner. I did notice that the rather florid gentleman\u2014Alderdyce? A judge?\u2014seemed inclined to pay you attention beyond the normal limits of gallantry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMuch good it will do him.\u201d Brianna snorted briefly. \u201cYou should have seen the looks Mrs. Alderdyce kept giving me, all through dinner. She\u2019s not going to have her ewe lamb\u2014God, he must be forty, if he\u2019s a day\u2014marry the local whore of Babylon. I\u2019d be surprised if she ever lets him set foot over the doorstep again.\u201d She patted her small bulge. \u201cI think I\u2019ve seen to that.\u201d</p><p>One brow rose, and Grey smiled wryly at her. He set down his teacup and reached for the sherry decanter and a glass.</p><p>\u201cAh? Well, while I admire the boldness of your strategy, Miss Fraser\u2014may I call you \u2018my dear\u2019?\u2014I regret to inform you that your tactics do not suit the terrain upon which you\u2019ve chosen to employ them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean by that?\u201d</p> <p>He leaned back in his chair, glass in hand, surveying her kindly.</p><p>\u201cMrs. Alderdyce. Not being blind\u2014though by no means as astute as your aunt\u2014I did indeed observe her observing you. But you mistake the nature of her observations, I\u2019m afraid.\u201d He shook his head, looking at her over the rim of his glass as he sipped.</p><p>\u201cNot the look of outraged respectability, by any means. It\u2019s granny lust.\u201d</p><p>Brianna sat up straight.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGranny lust,\u201d he repeated. He sat up himself and topped his glass, pouring the golden liquid carefully. \u201cYou know; an elderly woman\u2019s urgent desire for grandchildren to dandle upon her knee, spoil with sweetmeats, and generally corrupt.\u201d He raised his glass to his nose and reverently breathed in the vapors. \u201cOh, ambrosia. I haven\u2019t had a decent sherry in two years, at least.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2014you mean Mrs. Alderdyce thinks that I\u2014I mean, because I\u2019ve shown I\u2019m\u2014that I can have children, then she\u2019s sure to get grandchildren out of me later on? That\u2019s ridiculous! The Judge could pick any healthy girl\u2014of good character,\u201d she added bitterly, \u201cand be fairly sure of having children by her.\u201d</p><p>He took a drink, let it drift across his tongue, and swallowed, relishing the final ghost of the taste before answering. \u201cWell. No. I rather think that she realizes he could not. Or would not; it makes no difference.\u201d He looked at her directly, pale blue eyes unblinking.</p><p>\u201cYou said it yourself\u2014he is forty and unmarried.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean he\u2014but he\u2019s a judge!\u201d The moment her horrified exclamation came out, she realized the idiocy of it, and clapped a hand over her mouth, blushing furiously. Lord John laughed, though with a wry edge to it.</p><p>\u201cThe more certainty therefore,\u201d he said. \u201cYou are quite right; he could have his choice of any girl in the county. If he has not so chosen...\u201d He paused delicately, then lifted his glass to her in ironic toast. \u201cI rather think that Mrs. Alderdyce has realized that her son\u2019s marriage to you is her best\u2014possibly her only\u2014expectation of having the grandchild she so ardently desires.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn!\u201d She couldn\u2019t make a move right, she thought with despair. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter what I do. I\u2019m doomed. They\u2019ll have me married off to somebody, no matter what I do!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou must give me leave to doubt that,\u201d he said. His smile quirked sideways, a little painfully. \u201cFrom what I have seen of you, you have your mother\u2019s bluntness and your father\u2019s sense of honor. Either would be sufficient to preserve you from such entrapment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t talk to me about my father\u2019s honor,\u201d she said sharply. \u201cHe\u2019s who got me into this mess!\u201d</p> <p>His eyes dropped to her waistline, frankly ironical.</p><p>\u201cYou shock me,\u201d he said politely, seeming not shocked at all.</p><p>She felt the blood surge up in her face once more, hotter than before.</p><p>\u201cYou know perfectly well that\u2019s not what I mean!\u201d</p><p>He hid a smile in his sherry cup, eyes crinkling at her.</p><p>\u201cMy apologies, Miss Fraser. What did you mean, then?\u201d</p><p>She took a deep sip of tea to cover her confusion, and felt the comforting heat run down her throat and into her chest.</p><p>\u201cI mean,\u201d she said through her teeth, \u201cthis particular mess; being put on show like a piece of bloodstock with doubtful lines. Being held up by the scruff of the neck like an orphaned kitten, in hopes somebody will take me in! Being\u2014being left alone here in the first place,\u201d she ended, her voice trembling unexpectedly.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you alone here?\u201d Lord John asked, quite gently. \u201cI should have thought that your mother might have\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe wanted to. I wouldn\u2019t let her. Because she had to\u2014that is, he\u2014oh, it\u2019s all such a f**king mess!\u201d She dropped her head into her hands and stared wretchedly at the tabletop; not crying, but not far from it, either.</p><p>\u201cI can see that.\u201d Lord John leaned forward and put his empty glass back on the tray. \u201cIt\u2019s very late, my dear, and if you will pardon my observing it, you are in need of rest.\u201d He stood up and laid a hand lightly on her shoulder; oddly, it seemed only friendly, and not condescending, as another man\u2019s might.</p><p>\u201cAs it seems my journey to Wilmington is unnecessary, I think I will accept your aunt\u2019s kind invitation to remain here for a little. We will speak again, and see whether perhaps there is at least some palliative for your situation.\u201d</p><p>59</p><p>BLACKMAIL</p><p>The commode was magnificent, a beautiful piece of smooth carved walnut that mingled appeal with convenience. Particularly convenient on a rainy, cold night like this. She fumbled sleepily with the lid in the dark, lit by lightning flashes from the window, then sat down, sighing with relief as the pressure on her bladder eased.</p><p>Evidently pleased with the additional internal space thus provided, Osbert performed a series of lazy somersaults, making her belly undulate in ghostly waves beneath her white flannel nightgown. She stood up slowly\u2014she did almost everything slowly these days\u2014feeling pleasantly drugged with sleep.</p><p>She paused by the rumpled bed, looking out at the stark beauty of the hills and the rain-lashed trees. The glass of the window was icy to the touch, and the clouds rolled down from the mountains, black-bellied and growling with thunder. It wasn\u2019t snowing, but it was a nasty night and no mistake.</p><p>And what was it like in the high mountains now? Had they reached a village that would shelter them? Had they found Roger? She shivered involuntarily, though the embers still glowed red in the hearth and the room was warm. She felt the irresistible pull of her bed, promising warmth and, even more, the lure of dreams in which she might escape the chronic nag of fear and guilt.</p><p>She turned to the door, though, and pulled her cloak from the peg behind it. The urgency of pregnancy might necessitate her using the commode in her room, but she was resolved that no slave would ever carry a chamber pot for her\u2014not as long as she could walk. She wrapped the cloak tightly around her, took the lidded pewter receptacle from its cabinet, and stepped quietly into the corridor.</p><p>It was very late; all the candles had been put out, and the stale smell of dead fires lay in the stairwell, but she could see clearly enough by the flicker of the lightning as she made her way downstairs. The kitchen door was unbolted, a piece of carelessness for which she blessed the cook; no need to make noise struggling one-handed with the heavy bolt.</p><p>Freezing rain struck her face and whooshed up beneath the hem of her nightgown, making her gasp. Once past the first shock of cold, though, she enjoyed it; the violence of it was exhilarating, the wind strong enough to lift her cloak in billowing surges that made her feel light on her feet for the first time in months.</p><p>She swept in a flurry to the necessary house, rinsed out the pot in the drench of rain that poured from its gutters, then stood in the paved yard, letting the fresh wind sweep into her face and slash her cheeks with rain. She wasn\u2019t sure if this was expiation or exultation\u2014a need to share the discomfort her parents might be facing, or some more pagan rite\u2014a need to lose herself by joining in the ferocity of the elements. Either or both, it didn\u2019t matter; she stepped deliberately under the spout of the gutter, letting the water pound against her scalp and soak her hair and shoulders.</p><p>Gasping and shaking water from her hair like a dog, she stepped back\u2014and stopped, her eye caught by a sudden flash of light. Not lightning; a steady beam that shone for a moment, then vanished.</p><p>A door in the slave quarters opened for a moment, then closed. Was someone coming? Someone was; she could hear footsteps on the gravel, and took another step back into the shadows\u2014the last thing she wanted was to explain what she was doing out here.</p><p>The lightning showed him clearly as he passed, and she felt a jar of recognition. Lord John Grey, hurrying shirt sleeved and bareheaded, his fair hair unbound and blowing in the wind, evidently oblivious to the cold and rain. He passed without seeing her, and vanished under the overhang of the kitchen porch.</p><p>Realizing that she was in danger of being locked out, she ran after him, awkward but still fast. He was just closing the door when she hit it with her shoulder. She burst into the kitchen and stood dripping, Lord John goggling at her in disbelief.</p><p>\u201cNice night for a walk,\u201d she said, half breathless. \u201cIsn\u2019t it?\u201d She wiped back her wet hair, and with a cordial nod slipped past him, out, and up the stairs, her bare feet leaving wet half-moon prints on the dark, polished wood. She listened, but heard no steps behind her as she reached her room.</p><p>She left cloak and gown spread out before the fire to dry, and having toweled her hair and face, climbed nak*d into bed. She was shivering, but the feel of the cotton sheets on her bare skin was wonderful. She stretched, wiggling her toes, then rolled on her side, curling tightly around her center of gravity, letting the constant heat from within tendril outward, gradually reaching her skin, forming a small cocoon of warmth around her.</p><p>She replayed the scene on the footpath once more in memory, and very gradually, the shadowy thoughts that had been rattling around in her mind for days fell together into a rational shape.</p><p>Lord John treated her always with attention and respect\u2014often with amusement or admiration\u2014but there was something missing. She had not been able to identify it\u2014for some time had not even been aware of it\u2014but now she knew what it was, without doubt. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She was accustomed, as are most striking women, to the open admiration of men, and this she had from Lord John as well. But below such admiration was usually a deeper awareness, more subtle than glance or gesture, a vibration like the distant chime of a bell, a visceral acknowledgment of herself as female. She had thought she felt it from Lord John when they met\u2014but it had been gone on subsequent meetings, and she had concluded that she had mistaken it at first.</p><p>She should have guessed before, she thought; she\u2019d encountered that inner indifference once before, in the roommate of a casual boyfriend. But then, Lord John hid it very well; she might never have guessed, were it not for that chance encounter in the yard. No, he didn\u2019t chime for her. But when he came out of the servants\u2019 quarters, he had been ringing like a firebell.</p><p>She wondered briefly if her father knew, but dismissed the possibility. After his experiences in Wentworth Prison, he couldn\u2019t possibly hold a man with that preference in such warm regard as she knew he felt for Lord John.</p><p>She rolled onto her back. The polished cotton of the sheet slid across the bare skin of br**sts and thighs, caressing. She half noticed the feeling, and as her nipple hardened she raised a hand to cup her breast in reflex, felt Roger\u2019s large warm hand in memory, and a sudden surge of wanting. Then in memory she felt the sudden grasp of rougher hands, pinching and mauling, and wanting changed at once to sickened fury. She flipped onto her stomach, arms crossed beneath her br**sts and face buried in her pillow, legs clenched and teeth gritted in futile defense.</p> <p>The baby was a large, uncomfortable lump; impossible to lie that way now. With a small half-spoken curse, she rolled over and jerked out of bed, out from under the betraying, seductive sheets.</p><p>She walked nak*d through the half-lit room, and stood again by the window, looking out at the pounding rain. Her hair hung damp down her back, and cold was coming through the glass, pebbling the white flesh of arms and thighs and belly. She made no move either to cover herself or to go back to bed, but only stood there, one hand on the gently squirming bulge, looking out.</p><p>It would be too late soon. She had known when they left that it was already too late\u2014so had her mother. Neither of them had wanted to admit it to the other, though; they had both pretended that Roger would come back in time, that he and she would sail to Hispaniola, and find their way back through the stones\u2014together.</p><p>She laid her other hand against the glass; at once, a mist of condensation sprang up, outlining her fingers. It was early March; maybe three months left, maybe less. It would take a week, maybe two, to travel to the coast. No ship would risk the treacherous Outer Banks in March, though. Early April, at the soonest, before a journey could be undertaken. How long to the West Indies? Two weeks, three?</p><p>The end of April, then. And a few days to make their way inland, find the cave; it would be slow, fighting through the jungle, more than eight months pregnant. And dangerous, though that didn\u2019t matter much, considering.</p> <p>That would be if Roger were here now. But he wasn\u2019t. He might never come, though that was a possibility she fought hard against envisioning. If she didn\u2019t think about all the ways he could die, then he wouldn\u2019t die; it was one article of her stubborn faith; the others were that he wasn\u2019t dead yet, and that her mother would come back before the child was born. As to her father\u2014rage boiled up again, as it did whenever she thought of him\u2014him or Bonnet\u2014so she tried to think of either of them as little as possible.</p><p>She prayed, of course, as hard as she could, but she wasn\u2019t constituted for praying and waiting; she was made for action. If only she could have gone with them, to find Roger!</p><p>She hadn\u2019t had a choice about that, though. Her jaw tightened, and her hand splayed flat against her belly. She hadn\u2019t had a choice about a lot of things. But she had made one choice\u2014to keep her child\u2014and now she\u2019d have to live with the consequences of it.</p><p>She was beginning to shiver. Abruptly she turned away from the storm, and went to the fire. A small tongue of flame played along the blackened back of a red-crackled log, the heart of the embers glowing gold and white.</p><p>She sank down on the hearth rug, closing her eyes as the heat of the fire sent waves of comfort over her cold skin, caressing as the stroke of a hand. This time she kept all thought of Bonnet at bay, refusing him entrance to her mind, concentrating fiercely instead on the few precious memories she had of Roger.</p><p>...put your hand on my heart. Tell me if it stops...She could hear him, half breathless, half choked between laughter and passion.</p> <p>How the hell do you know that? The rough feel of curly hairs under her palms, the smooth hard curves of his shoulders, the throb of the pulse in the side of his throat when she\u2019d pulled him down to her and put her mouth on him, wanting in her urgency to bite him, to taste him, to breathe the salt and dust of his skin.</p><p>The dark and secret places of him, that she knew only by feel, recalled as soft weight, rolling and vulnerable in her palm, a complexity of curve and depth that yielded reluctantly to her probing fingertips (Oh, God, don\u2019t stop, but careful, aye? Oh!), the strange wrinkled silk that grew taut and smooth, filled her hand rising, silent and incredible as the stalk of a night-blooming flower that opens as you watch.</p><p>His gentleness as he touched her (Christ, I wish I could see your face, to know how it is for you, am I doing well by ye. Is it good, just here? Tell me, Bree, talk to me...), as she explored him, and then the moment when she had pushed him too far, her mouth on his nipple. She felt again the sudden amazing surge of power in him, as he lost all sense of restraint and seized her, lifting her as though she weighed nothing, rolled her back against the straw and took her, half hesitating as he remembered her freshly riven flesh, then answering the demand of her nails in his back to come to her fiercely, forcing her past the fear of impalement, into acceptance, and welcome, and finally into a frenzy that matched his own, rupturing the last membrane of reticence between them, joining them forever in a flood of sweat and musk and blood and sem*n.</p><p>She moaned out loud, shuddered and lay still, too weak even to move her hand away. Her heart was thumping, very slowly. Her belly was tight as a drum, the last of the spasms slowly relaxing its grip on her swollen womb. One half of her body blazed with heat, the other was cool and dark.</p><p>After a moment she rolled onto her hands and knees, and crawled away from the fire. She hauled herself onto the bed like a wounded beast, and lay half stunned, ignoring the currents of heat and cold that played over her.</p><p>At last she stirred, pulled a single quilt over her, and lay staring at the wall, hands crossed in protection above her baby. Yes, it was too late. Sensation and yearning must be put aside, along with love and anger. She must resist the mindless pull of both body and emotion. There were decisions to be made.</p><p>It took three days to convince herself of the virtue of her plan, to overcome her own scruples, and, at last, to find a suitable time and place in which to catch him alone. But she was thorough and she was patient; she had all the time in the world\u2014nearly three months of it.</p><p>On Tuesday, her opportunity came at last. Jocasta was closeted in her study with Duncan Innes and the account books, Ulysses\u2014with a brief, inscrutable look at the closed door of the study\u2014had gone to the kitchen to superintend the preparations for yet another lavish dinner in his Lordship\u2019s honor, and she had gotten rid of Phaedre by sending her on horseback to Barra Meadows to fetch a book Jenny Ban Campbell had promised her.</p> <p>With a fresh blue camlet gown that matched her eyes, and a heart beating in her chest like a trip-hammer, she set out to stalk her victim. She found him in the library, reading the Meditations of Marcus Aurelius by the French windows, the morning sun streaming over his shoulder making his smooth fair hair gleam like buttered toffee.</p><p>He looked up from his book when she came in\u2014a hippopotamus could have made a more graceful entrance, she thought crossly, catching her skirt on the corner of a bric-a-brac table in her nervousness\u2014then graciously laid it aside, springing to his feet to bow over her hand.</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t want to sit down, thank you.\u201d She shook her head at the seat he was offering her. \u201cI wondered\u2014that is, I thought I\u2019d go for a walk. Would you like to come with me?\u201d</p><p>There was frost on the lower panes of the French door, a stiff breeze whining past the house, and soft chairs, brandy, and blazing fire within. But Lord John was a gentleman.</p><p>\u201cThere is nothing I should like better,\u201d he gallantly assured her, and abandoned Marcus Aurelius without a backward glance.</p><p>It was a bright day, but very cold. Muffled in thick cloaks, they turned into the kitchen garden, where the high walls gave them some shelter from the wind. They exchanged small, breathless comments on the brightness of the day, assured each other that they were not cold at all, and came through a small archway into the brick-walled herbary. Brianna glanced around them; they were quite alone, and she would be able to see anyone coming along the walk. Best not waste time, then.</p><p>\u201cI have a proposal to make to you,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI am sure any notion of yours must necessarily be delightful, my dear,\u201d he said, smiling slightly.</p><p>\u201cWell, I don\u2019t know about that,\u201d she said, and took a deep breath. \u201cBut here goes. I want you to marry me.\u201d</p><p>He kept smiling, evidently waiting for the punch line.</p><p>\u201cI mean it,\u201d she said.</p><p>The smile didn\u2019t altogether go away, but it altered. She wasn\u2019t sure whether he was dismayed at her gaucherie or just trying not to laugh, but she suspected the latter.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want any of your money,\u201d she assured him. \u201cI\u2019ll sign a paper saying so. And you don\u2019t need to live with me, either, though it\u2019s probably a good idea for me to go to Virginia with you, at least for a little while. As for what I could do for you...\u201d She hesitated, knowing that hers was the weaker side of the bargain. \u201cI\u2019m strong, but that doesn\u2019t mean much to you, since you have servants. I\u2019m a good manager, though\u2014I can keep accounts, and I think I know how to run a farm. I do know how to build things. I could manage your property in Virginia while you were in England. And...you have a young son, don\u2019t you? I\u2019ll look after him; I\u2019d be a good mother to him.\u201d</p><p>Lord John had stopped dead in the path during this speech. Now he leaned slowly back against the brick wall, casting his eyes up in a silent prayer for understanding.</p><p>\u201cDear God in heaven,\u201d he said. \u201cThat I should live to hear an offer like that!\u201d Then he lowered his head and gave her a direct and piercing look.</p><p>\u201cAre you out of your mind?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said, with an attempt at keeping her own composure. \u201cIt\u2019s a perfectly reasonable suggestion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have heard,\u201d he said, rather cautiously, with an eye to her belly, \u201cthat women in an expectant condition are somewhat...excitable, in consequence of their state. I confess, though, that my experience is distressingly limited with respect to...that is\u2014perhaps I should send for Dr. Fentiman?\u201d</p><p>She drew herself up to her full height, put a hand on the wall and leaned toward him, deliberately looking down on him, menacing him with her size. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo, you should not,\u201d she said, in measured tones. \u201cListen to me, Lord John. I\u2019m not crazy, I\u2019m not frivolous, and I don\u2019t mean it to be an inconvenience to you in any way\u2014but I\u2019m dead serious.\u201d</p><p>The cold had reddened his fair skin, and there was a drop of moisture glistening on the tip of his nose. He wiped it on a fold of his cloak, eyeing her with something between interest and horror. At least he\u2019d stopped laughing.</p><p>She felt mildly sick, but she\u2019d have to do it. She\u2019d hoped it could be avoided, but there seemed no other way.</p><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t agree to marry me,\u201d she said, \u201cI\u2019ll expose you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019ll do what?\u201d His usual mask of urbanity had disappeared, leaving puzzlement and the beginnings of wariness in its stead.</p><p>She was wearing woolen mittens, but her fingers felt frozen. So did everything else, except the warm lump of her slumbering child.</p><p>\u201cI know what you were doing\u2014the other night, at the slave quarters. I\u2019ll tell everyone; my aunt, Mr. Campbell, the sheriff. I\u2019ll write letters,\u201d she said, her lips feeling numb even as she uttered the ridiculous threat. \u201cTo the Governor, and the Governor of Virginia. They put p-pederasts in the pillory here; Mr. Campbell told me so.\u201d</p><p>A frown drew his brows together; they were so fair that they scarcely showed against his skin when he stood in strong light. They reminded her of Lizzie\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cStop looming over me, if you please.\u201d</p> <p>He took hold of her wrist and pulled it down with a force that surprised her. He was small but much stronger than she had supposed, and for the first time, she was slightly afraid of what she was doing.</p><p>He took her firmly by the elbow and propelled her into motion, away from the house. The thought struck her that perhaps he meant to take her down to the river, out of sight, and try to drown her. She thought it unlikely, but still resisted the direction of his urging, and turned back into the square-laid paths of the kitchen garden instead.</p><p>He made no demur, but went with her, though it meant walking head-on into the wind. He didn\u2019t speak until they had turned once more, and reached a sheltered corner by the onion bed.</p><p>\u201cI am halfway tempted to submit to your outrageous proposal,\u201d he said at last, the corner of his mouth twitching\u2014whether with fury or amusement, she couldn\u2019t tell.</p><p>\u201cIt would certainly please your aunt. It would outrage your mother. And it would teach you to play with fire, I do assure you.\u201d She caught a gleam in his eye that gave her a sudden surge of doubt about her conclusions as to his preferences. She drew back from him a bit.</p><p>\u201cOh. I hadn\u2019t thought of that\u2014that you might...men and women both, I mean.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI was married,\u201d he pointed out, with some sarcasm.</p><p>\u201cYes, but I thought that was probably the same kind of thing I\u2019m suggesting now\u2014just a formal arrangement, I mean. That\u2019s what made me think of it in the first place, once I realized that you\u2014\u201d She broke off with an impatient gesture. \u201cAre you telling me that you do like to go to bed with women?\u201d</p><p>He raised one eyebrow.</p><p>\u201cWould that make a substantial difference to your plans?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell...\u201d she said uncertainly. \u201cYes. Yes, it would. If I\u2019d known that, I wouldn\u2019t have suggested it.\u201d</p><p>\u201c \u2018Suggested,\u2019 she says,\u201d he muttered. \u201cPublic denunciation? The pillory? Suggested?\u201d</p><p>The blood burned so hotly in her cheeks, she was surprised not to see the cold air turn to steam around her face.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she said. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have done it. You have to believe me, I really wouldn\u2019t have said a word to anybody. It\u2019s only when you laughed, I thought\u2014anyway, it doesn\u2019t matter. If you did want to sleep with me, I couldn\u2019t marry you\u2014it wouldn\u2019t be right.\u201d</p> <p>He closed his eyes very tight and held them squinched shut for a minute. Then he opened one light blue eye and looked at her.</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cBecause of Roger,\u201d she said, and was infuriated to hear her voice break on the name. Still more infuriated to feel a hot tear escape to run down her cheek.</p><p>\u201cDamn it!\u201d she said. \u201cDamn it to hell! I wasn\u2019t even going to think about him!\u201d</p><p>She swiped the tear angrily away, and clenched her teeth.</p><p>\u201cMaybe you\u2019re right,\u201d she said. \u201cMaybe it is being pregnant. I cry all the time, over nothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI rather doubt it is nothing,\u201d he said dryly.</p><p>She took a deep breath, the cold air hollowing her chest. There was one last card to play, then.</p><p>\u201cIf you do like women...I couldn\u2019t\u2014I mean, I don\u2019t want to sleep with you regularly. And I wouldn\u2019t mind your sleeping with anybody else\u2014male or female\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you for that,\u201d he muttered, but she ignored him, bent only on the need to get it all out.</p><p>\u201cBut I can see that you might want a child of your own. It wouldn\u2019t be right for me to keep you from having one. I can give you that, I think.\u201d She glanced down at herself, arms clasped across the round of her belly. \u201cEveryone says I\u2019m made for childbearing,\u201d she went on steadily, eyes on her feet. \u201cI\u2019d\u2014just until I got pregnant again, though. You\u2019d have to put that in the contract, too\u2014Mr. Campbell could draw it up.\u201d</p><p>Lord John massaged his forehead, evidently suffering the onslaught of a massive headache. Then he dropped his hand and took her by the arm.</p><p>\u201cCome and sit down, child,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cYou\u2019d best tell me what the devil you\u2019re up to.\u201d</p><p>She took a deep, savage breath to steady her voice.</p><p>\u201cI am not a child,\u201d she said. He glanced up at her and seemed to change his mind about something.</p><p>\u201cNo, you\u2019re not\u2014God help us both. But before you startle Farquard Campbell into an apoplexy with your notion of a suitable marriage contract, I beg you to sit with me for a moment and share the processes of your most remarkable brain.\u201d He motioned her through the archway into the ornamental garden, where they would be invisible from the house.</p><p>The garden was bleak, but orderly; all the dead stalks of the year before had been pulled out, the dry stems chopped and scattered as mulch over the beds. Only in the circular bed around the dry fountain were there signs of life; green crocus spikes poked up like tiny battering rams, vivid and intransigent.</p><p>They sat, but she couldn\u2019t sit. Not and face him. He got up with her, and walked beside her, not touching her but keeping pace, the wind whipping strands of blond hair across his face, not saying a word, but listening, listening as she told him almost everything.</p><p>\u201cSo I\u2019ve been thinking, and thinking,\u201d she ended wretchedly. \u201cAnd I never get anywhere. Do you see? Mother and\u2014and Da, they\u2019re out there somewhere\u2014\u201d She waved an arm toward the distant mountains. \u201cAnything could happen to them\u2014anything might have happened to Roger already. And here I sit, getting bigger and bigger, and there\u2019s nothing I can do!\u201d</p><p>She glanced down at him and drew the back of a mittened hand under her dripping nose.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not crying,\u201d she assured him, though she was.</p><p>\u201cOf course not,\u201d he said. He took her hand and drew it through his arm.</p><p>\u201cRound and round,\u201d he murmured, eyes on the path of crazy paving as they circled the fountain.</p><p>\u201cYes, round and round the mulberry bush,\u201d she agreed. \u201cAnd it\u2019ll be Pop! goes the weasel in three months or so. I have to do something,\u201d she ended, miserably.</p><p>\u201cBelieve it or not, in your case waiting is doing something, though I admit it may not seem so,\u201d he answered dryly. \u201cWhy is it that you will not wait to see whether your father\u2019s quest is successful? Is it that your sense of honor will not allow you to bear a fatherless child? Or\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not my honor,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s his. Roger\u2019s. He\u2019s\u2014he followed me. He gave up\u2014everything\u2014and came after me, when I came here to find my father. I knew he would, and he did.</p><p>\u201cWhen he finds out about this\u2014\u201d She grimaced, cupping a hand to the swell of her stomach. \u201cHe\u2019ll marry me; he\u2019ll feel as though he has to. And I can\u2019t let him do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I love him. I don\u2019t want him to marry me out of obligation. And I\u2014\u201d She clamped her lips tight on the rest of it. \u201cI won\u2019t,\u201d she ended firmly. \u201cI\u2019ve made up my mind, and I won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Lord John pulled his cloak tighter as a fresh blast of wind came rocketing in off the river. It smelled of ice and dead leaves, but there was a hint of freshness in it; spring was coming.</p><p>\u201cI see,\u201d he said. \u201cWell, I quite agree with your aunt that you require a husband. Why me, though?\u201d He raised one pale brow. \u201cIs it my title or my wealth?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeither one. It was because I was sure that you didn\u2019t like women,\u201d she said, giving him one of those candid blue looks.</p><p>\u201cI do like women,\u201d he said, exasperated. \u201cI admire and honor them, and for several of the sex I feel considerable affection\u2014your mother among them, though I doubt the sentiment is reciprocated. I do not, however, seek pleasure in their beds. Do I speak plainly enough?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said, the small lines between her eyes vanishing like magic. \u201cThat\u2019s what I thought. See, it wouldn\u2019t be right for me to marry Mr. MacNeill or Barton McLachlan or any of those men, because I\u2019d be promising something I couldn\u2019t give them. But you don\u2019t want that anyway, so there isn\u2019t any reason why I can\u2019t marry you.\u201d</p><p>He repressed a strong urge to bang his head against the wall.</p><p>\u201cThere most assuredly is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo name only the most obvious, your father would undoubtedly break my neck!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat for?\u201d she demanded, frowning. \u201cHe likes you; he says you\u2019re one of his best friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am honored to be the recipient of his esteem,\u201d he said shortly. \u201cHowever, that esteem would very shortly cease to exist, upon Jamie Fraser\u2019s discovering that his daughter was serving as consort and brood mare to a degenerate sodomite.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd how would he discover that?\u201d she demanded. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t tell him.\u201d Then she flushed and, meeting his outraged eye, suddenly dissolved into laughter, in which he helplessly joined.</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m sorry, but you said it,\u201d she gasped at last, sitting up and wiping her streaming eyes with the hem of her cloak.</p><p>\u201cOh, Christ. Yes, I did.\u201d Distracted, he thumbed a strand of hair out of his mouth, and wiped his running nose on his sleeve again. \u201cDamn, why haven\u2019t I a handkerchief? I said it because it\u2019s true. As for your father finding out, he\u2019s well aware of the fact.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe is?\u201d She seemed disproportionately surprised. \u201cBut I thought he\u2019d never\u2014\u201d</p><p>A flash of yellow apron interrupted her; one of the kitchen maids was in the adjoining garden. Without comment, Lord John stood up and gave her a hand; she got ponderously to her feet and they sailed out onto the dry brown scurf of the dead lawn, cloaks billowing like sails around them. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The stone bench under the willow tree was devoid of its usual charm at this time of year, but it was at least sheltered from the icy blasts off the river. Lord John saw her seated, sat down himself, and sneezed explosively. She opened her cloak and dug in the bosom of her dress, finally coming out with a crumpled handkerchief, which she handed to him with apologies.</p><p>It was warm and smelled of her\u2014a disconcerting odor of girl-flesh, spiced with cloves and lavender.</p><p>\u201cWhat you said about teaching me to play with fire,\u201d she said. \u201cJust what did you mean by that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d he said, but now it was his turn to flush.</p> <p>\u201cNothing, hm?\u201d she said, and gave him the ghost of an ironic smile. \u201cThat was a threat if I ever heard one.\u201d</p><p>He sighed, and wiped his face once more with her handkerchief.</p><p>\u201cYou have been frank with me,\u201d he said. \u201cTo the point of embarrassment and well beyond. So yes, I suppose I\u2014no, it was a threat.\u201d He made a small gesture of surrender. \u201cYou look like your father, don\u2019t you see?\u201d</p><p>She frowned at him, his words obviously meaning nothing. Then realization flickered, sprang to full life. She sat bolt upright, staring down at him.</p><p>\u201cNot you\u2014not Da! He wouldn\u2019t!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d Lord John said, very dryly. \u201cHe wouldn\u2019t. Though your shock is scarcely flattering. And for what the statement is worth, I would under no circumstances take advantage of your likeness to him\u2014that was as much an idle threat as was your menacing me with exposure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere did you...meet my father?\u201d she asked carefully, her own troubles superseded for the moment by curiosity.</p><p>\u201cIn prison. You knew he was imprisoned, after the Rising?\u201d</p><p>She nodded, frowning slightly.</p><p>\u201cYes. Well. Leave it as said that I harbor feelings of particular affection for Jamie Fraser, and have for some years.\u201d He shook his head, sighing.</p><p>\u201cAnd here you come offering me your innocent body, with its echoes of his flesh\u2014and add to that the promise of giving me a child who would mingle my blood with his\u2014and all this, because your honor will not let you wed a man you love, or love a man you wed.\u201d He broke off and sank his head in his hands.</p> <p>\u201cChild, you would make an angel weep, and God knows I am no angel!\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy mother thinks you are.\u201d</p><p>He glanced up at her, startled.</p><p>\u201cShe thinks what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe she wouldn\u2019t go quite that far,\u201d she amended, still frowning. \u201cShe says you\u2019re a good man, though. I think she likes you, but she doesn\u2019t want to. Of course, I understand that now; I suppose she must know\u2014how you...er...feel about...\u201d She coughed, hiding her blushes in a fold of her cloak.</p><p>\u201cHell,\u201d he muttered. \u201cOh, hell and thundering damnation. I ought never to have come out with you. Yes, she does. Though in all truth, I am not sure why she regards me with suspicion. It cannot be jealousy, surely.\u201d</p><p>Brianna shook her head, chewing thoughtfully on her lower lip.</p><p>\u201cI think it\u2019s because she\u2019s afraid you\u2019ll hurt him, somehow. She\u2019s afraid for him, you know.\u201d</p> <p>He glanced up at her, startled.</p><p>\u201cHurt him? How? Does she think I will overpower him and commit depraved indignities upon his person?\u201d</p><p>He spoke lightly, but a flicker in her eyes froze the words in his throat. He tightened his grip on her arm. She bit her lip, then gently detached his hand, laying it on his knee.</p><p>\u201cHave you ever seen my father with his shirt off?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you mean the scars on his back?\u201d</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>He drummed his fingers restlessly on his knees, soundless on the fine broadcloth.</p><p>\u201cYes, I\u2019ve seen them. I did that.\u201d</p><p>Her head jerked back, eyes wide. The end of her nose was cherry-red, but the rest of her skin so pale that her hair and eyebrows seemed to have leached all the life from it.</p><p>\u201cNot all of it,\u201d he said, staring off into a bed of dead hollyhocks. \u201cHe\u2019d been flogged before, which made it all the worse\u2014that he knew what he was doing, when he did it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid...what?\u201d she asked. Slowly, she rearranged herself on the bench, not so much turning toward him as flowing in her garments, like a cloud changing shape in the wind.</p><p>\u201cI was the commander at Ardsmuir prison; did he tell you? No, I thought not.\u201d He made an impatient gesture, brushing back the strands of fair hair that whipped across his face.</p><p>\u201cHe was an officer, a gentleman. The only officer there. He spoke for the Jacobite prisoners. We dined together, in my quarters. We played chess, we spoke of books. We had interests in common. We...became friends. And then...we were not.\u201d</p><p>He stopped speaking.</p><p>She drew away from him a bit, distaste in her eyes.</p><p>\u201cYou mean\u2014you had him flogged because he wouldn\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, damn it, I did not!\u201d He snatched the handkerchief and scrubbed angrily at his nose. He flung it down on the seat between them and glared at her. \u201cHow dare you suggest such a thing!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you said yourself you did it!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe did it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t flog yourself!\u201d</p><p>He started to reply, then snorted. He raised one brow at her, still angry, but with his feelings coming back under control.</p><p>\u201cThe hell you can\u2019t. You\u2019ve been doing it for months, according to what you\u2019ve told me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe aren\u2019t talking about me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course we are!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, we\u2019re not!\u201d She leaned toward him, heavy brows drawn down. \u201cWhat the hell do you mean, he did it?\u201d</p><p>The wind was blowing from behind her, into his face. It made his eyes sting and water, and he looked away.</p><p>\u201cWhat am I doing here?\u201d he muttered to himself. \u201cI must be mad to be talking with you in this manner!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care if you\u2019re mad or not,\u201d she said, and gripped him by the sleeve. \u201cYou tell me what happened!\u201d</p><p>He pressed his lips tight together, and for a moment, she thought he wouldn\u2019t. But he had already said too much to stop, and he knew it. His shoulders rose under his cloak and dropped, slumping in surrender.</p><p>\u201cWe were friends. Then...he discovered my feeling for him. We were no longer friends, by his choice. But that was not enough for him; he wished a final severance. And so he deliberately brought about an occasion so drastic that it must alter our relation irrevocably and prevent any chance of friendship between us. So he lied. During a search of the prisoners\u2019 quarters, he claimed a piece of tartan publicly as his own. Possession was against the law, then\u2014it still is, in Scotland.\u201d</p><p>He drew a deep breath and let it out. He wouldn\u2019t look at her, but kept his eyes focused on the ragged fringe of bare trees across the river, raw against the pale spring sky.</p><p>\u201cI was the governor, charged with execution of the law. I was obliged to have him flogged. As he damn well knew I would be.\u201d</p><p>He tilted his head back, resting it against the carved stone back of the bench. His eyes were closed against the wind.</p><p>\u201cI could forgive his not wanting me,\u201d he said, with quiet bitterness. \u201cBut I couldn\u2019t forgive him for making me use him in that fashion. Not forcing me merely to hurt him, but to degrade him. He could not merely refuse to acknowledge my feeling; he must destroy it. It was too much.\u201d</p><p>Bits of debris boiled past on the flood; storm-cracked twigs and branches, a broken board from the hull of a boat, wrecked somewhere upstream. Her hand covered his where it rested on his knee. It was slightly larger than his own, and warm from sheltering in her cloak.</p><p>\u201cThere was a reason. It wasn\u2019t you. But it\u2019s for him to tell you, if he wants to. You did forgive him, though,\u201d she said quietly. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>He sat up then, and shrugged, but didn\u2019t put away her hand.</p><p>\u201cI had to.\u201d He glanced at her, eyes straight and level. \u201cI hated him for as long as I could. But then I realized that loving him...that was part of me, and one of the best parts. It didn\u2019t matter that he couldn\u2019t love me, that had nothing to do with it. But if I could not forgive him, then I could not love him, and that part of me was gone. And I found eventually that I wanted it back.\u201d He smiled, faintly. \u201cSo you see, it was really entirely selfish.\u201d</p><p>He squeezed her hand then, stood up, and pulled her to her feet.</p><p>\u201cCome, my dear. We shall both freeze solid if we sit here any longer.\u201d</p><p>They walked back toward the house, not talking, but walking close together, arm in arm. As they came back through the gardens he spoke abruptly.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right, I think. To live with someone you love, knowing that they tolerate the relation only for the sake of obligation\u2014no, I wouldn\u2019t do it, either. Were it only a matter of convenience and respect on both sides, then yes; such a marriage is one of honor. As long as both parties are honest\u2014\u201d His mouth twisted briefly as he glanced in the direction of the servants\u2019 quarters. \u201cThere is no need for shame on either side.\u201d</p><p>She looked down at him, brushing a strand of windblown copper hair out of her eyes with her free hand.</p><p>\u201cThen you\u2019ll accept my proposal?\u201d The hollow feeling in her chest didn\u2019t feel like the relief she had expected.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said bluntly. \u201cI may have forgiven Jamie Fraser for what he did in the past\u2014but he would never forgive me for marrying you.\u201d He smiled at her, and patted the hand he held tucked in the curve of his arm.</p><p>\u201cI can give you some respite from both your suitors and your aunt, though.\u201d He glanced at the house, whose curtains hung unstirring against the glass.</p><p>\u201cDo you suppose anyone\u2019s watching?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d say you can bet on it,\u201d she said, a little grimly.</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d Pulling off the sapphire ring he wore, he turned to face her and took her hand. He pulled off her mitten and ceremoniously slid the ring onto her little finger\u2014the only one it would fit. Then he rose smoothly on his toes and kissed her on the lips. Leaving her no time to recover from surprise, he clasped her hand in his, and turned once more toward the house, his expression bland.</p><p>\u201cCome along, my dear,\u201d he said. \u201cLet us announce our engagement.\u201d</p><p>60</p><p>TRIAL BY FIRE</p><p>They were left alone all day. The fire was dead, and there was no food left. It didn\u2019t matter; neither man could eat, and no fire would have reached Roger\u2019s soul-deep chill.</p><p>The Indians came back in late afternoon. Several warriors, escorting an elderly man, dressed in a flowing lace shirt and a woven mantle, his face painted with red and ocher\u2014the sachem, bearing a small clay pot in his hand, filled with black liquid.</p><p>Alexandre had put on his clothes; he stood when the sachem approached him, but neither spoke nor moved. The sachem began to sing in a cracked old voice, and as he sang, dipped a rabbit\u2019s foot into the pot and painted the priest\u2019s face in black, from forehead to chin.</p><p>The Indians left, and the priest sat down on the ground, his eyes closed. Roger tried to speak to him, to offer him water, or at least the knowledge of company, but Alexandre made no response, sitting as though he had been carved of stone. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>In the last of the twilight, he spoke, finally.</p><p>\u201cThere is not much time,\u201d he said softly. \u201cI asked you once before to pray for me. I did not know then what I would have you pray for\u2014for the preservation of my life, or my soul. Now I know that neither is possible.\u201d</p><p>Roger moved to speak, but the priest twitched a hand, stopping him.</p><p>\u201cThere is only the only thing I can ask for. Pray for me, brother\u2014that I might die well. Pray that I may die in silence.\u201d He looked at Roger for the first time, then, his eyes glinting with moisture. \u201cI would not shame her by crying out.\u201d</p> <p>It was some time after dark that the drums began. Roger had not heard them in his time in the village. Impossible to say how many there were; the sound seemed to come from everywhere. He felt it in the marrow of his bones and the soles of his feet.</p><p>The Mohawks returned. When they came in, the priest stood up at once. He undressed himself, and walked out, nak*d, without a backward glance.</p><p>Roger sat staring at the hide-covered doorway, praying\u2014and listening. He knew what a drum could do; had done it himself\u2014evoked awe and fury with the beating of a stretched hide, calling to the deep and hidden instincts of the listener. Knowing what was happening, though, didn\u2019t make it any less frightening.</p><p>He could not have said how long he sat there listening to the drums, hearing other sounds\u2014voices, footsteps, the noises of a large assembly\u2014trying not to listen for Alexandre\u2019s voice.</p><p>Suddenly the drumming stopped. It started again, no more than a few tentative thumps, and then quit altogether. There were shouts, and then a sudden cacophany of yells. Roger started up, and hobbled toward the door. The guard was still there, though; he thrust his head through the flap and gestured menacingly, one hand on his war club.</p> <p>Roger stopped, but couldn\u2019t return to the fire. He stood in the half-dark, sweat rolling down his ribs, listening to the sounds outside.</p><p>It sounded like all the devils in hell had been let loose. What in God\u2019s name was going on out there? A terrific fight, obviously. But who, and why?</p><p>After the first salvo of shrieks, the vocal part of it had lessened, but there were still individual high-pitched yelps and ululations from every part of the central clearing. There were thuds, too; moans, and other noises indicative of violent combat. Something struck the wall of the longhouse; the wall shivered and a bark panel cracked down the middle.</p><p>Roger glanced at the door flap; no, the guard wasn\u2019t looking. He dashed across to the panel and tore at it with his fingers. No good; the wood fibers shredded away beneath his nails and wouldn\u2019t give him purchase. In desperation, he pressed his eye to the hole he had made, trying to see what was happening outside.</p><p>No more than a narrow slice of the central clearing was visible. He could see the longhouse opposite, a strip of churned earth between, and over everything, the flickering light of an enormous fire. Red and yellow shadows fought with black ones, peopling the air with fiery demons.</p><p>Some of the demons were real; two dark figures reeled past and out of sight, locked in violent embrace. More figures streaked across his line of sight, running toward the fire.</p> <p>Then he stiffened, pressing his face against the wood. Among the incomprehensible Mohawk yells, he could have sworn he had heard someone bellowing in Gaelic.</p><p>He had.</p><p>\u201cCaisteal Dhuni!\u201d somebody shouted nearby, followed by a hair-raising screech. Scots\u2014white men! He had to get to them! Roger smashed his fists on the shattered wood in a frenzy, trying to batter his way through the panel by main force. The Gaelic voice broke loose again.</p><p>\u201cCaisteal Dhuni!\u201d No, wait\u2014God, it was another voice! And the first one, answering. \u201cDo mi! Do mi!\u201d To me! To me! And then a fresh wave of Mohawk shrieks rose up and drowned the voices\u2014women, it was women screaming now, their voices even louder than the men\u2019s.</p><p>Roger flung himself at the panel, shoulder first; it cracked and splintered further, but would not give way. He tried again, and a third time, with no result. There was nothing in the longhouse that could be used as a weapon, nothing. In desperation he seized the lashings of one of the bed cubicles and tore at it with hands and teeth, ripping until he had loosened part of the frame.</p><p>He grabbed the wood, heaved; shook it and heaved again, until with a rending crack it came free in his hands, leaving him panting, holding a six-foot pole with a shattered, sharpened end. He tucked the butt end under his arm and charged the doorway, pointed end aimed like a spear at the hide flap.</p><p>He shot out into dark and flame, cold air and smoke, into noise that singed his blood. He saw a figure ahead of him, and charged it. The man danced aside, and raised a war club. Roger couldn\u2019t stop, couldn\u2019t turn, but threw himself flat, and the club smashed down inches from his head.</p><p>He rolled to the side and swung his pole wildly. It crashed against the Indian\u2019s head, and the man stumbled and went down, falling over Roger.</p> <p>Whisky. The man reeked of whisky. Not stopping to wonder, Roger wriggled out from under the squirming body, staggering to his feet, pole still in his hand.</p><p>A scream came from behind him and he whirled, stabbing with all his strength as he pivoted on the ball of his foot. The shock of impact shuddered up his arms and through his chest. The man he had struck was clawing at the pole; it jerked and quivered, then was wrenched from his grasp as the man fell over.</p><p>He staggered, caught himself, then whirled toward the fire. It was an immense pyre; flames billowing in a wall of pure and ardent scarlet, vivid against the night. Through the bobbing heads of the watchers, he saw the black figure in the heart of the flame, arms spread in a gesture of benediction, lashed to the pole from which he hung. Long hair fluttered up, strands catching fire with a burst of flame, surrounding the head with a halo of gold, like Christ in a missal. Then something crashed down on Roger\u2019s head, and he dropped like a rock.</p><p>He didn\u2019t quite lose consciousness. He couldn\u2019t see or move, but he could still hear, dimly. There were voices near him. The yelling was still there, but fainter, almost a background noise, like the roar of the ocean.</p><p>He felt himself rise in the air, and the crackle of the flames got louder, it matched the roar in his ears...Christ, they were going to throw him into the fire! His head spun with effort and light blazed behind his shut lids, but his stubborn body wouldn\u2019t move.</p><p>The roar diminished, but paradoxically he felt warm air brush his face. He struck the ground, half bounced, and rolled, ending up on his face, his arms flung out. Cool earth was under his fingers.</p><p>He breathed. Mechanically, one breath at a time. Very slowly, the spinning sensation began to ebb.</p><p>There was noise, a long way away, but he couldn\u2019t hear anything near him but his own loud breathing. Very slowly, he opened one eye. Firelight flickered on poles and bark panels, a dim echo of the brilliance outside. Longhouse. He was inside again.</p><p>His breathing was loud and ragged in his ears. He tried to hold his breath, but couldn\u2019t. Then he realized that he was holding his breath; the gasping noise was coming from someone else.</p><p>It was behind him. With immense effort, he got his hands under him, and rose onto hands and knees, swaying, eyes squinted against the pain in his head.</p><p>\u201cJesus Christ,\u201d he muttered to himself. He rubbed a hand hard over his face and blinked, but the man was still there, six feet away.</p><p>Jamie Fraser. He was lying on his side in a huddle of limbs, a crimson plaid tangled round his body. Half his face was obscured with blood, but there wasn\u2019t any mistaking him.</p><p>For a moment, Roger just looked at him blankly. For months the greater part of his waking moments had been devoted to imagining a meeting with this man. Now it had happened, and it seemed simply impossible. There was room for no feeling beyond a sort of dull amazement.</p><p>He rubbed his face again, harder, forcing aside the fog of fear and adrenaline. What...what was Fraser doing here?</p><p>When thought and feeling connected again, his first recognizable feeling was neither fury nor alarm, but an absurd burst of joyful relief.</p><p>\u201cShe didn\u2019t,\u201d he muttered, and the words sounded queer and hoarse to his ears, after so long without spoken English. \u201cOh, God, she didn\u2019t do it!\u201d</p><p>Jamie Fraser could be here for only one reason\u2014to rescue him. And if that was so, it was because Brianna had made her father come. Whether it was misunderstanding or malevolence that had put him through the hell of the last few months, it had not been hers.</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t,\u201d he said again. \u201cShe didn\u2019t.\u201d He shuddered, both with nausea from the blow and with relief.</p><p>He had thought he would be hollow forever, but suddenly there was something there; something small, but very solid. Something he could hold in the cup of his heart. Brianna. He had her back.</p><p>There was another set of high-pitched screams from just outside; ululations that went on and on, sticking into his flesh like a thousand pins. He jerked, and shuddered again, all other feelings subsumed in renewed realization.</p><p>Dying with the reassurance that Brianna loved him was better than dying without it\u2014but he hadn\u2019t wanted to die in the first place. He remembered what he had seen outside, felt his gorge rise, and choked it down.</p><p>With a trembling hand he began the unfamiliar sign of the Cross. \u201cIn the name of the Father,\u201d he whispered, and then the words failed him. \u201cPlease,\u201d he whispered instead. \u201cPlease, don\u2019t let him have been right.\u201d</p><p>He crawled shakily to Fraser\u2019s body, hoping that the man was still alive. He was; blood was flowing from a gash on Fraser\u2019s temple, and when he thrust his fingers under the man\u2019s jaw, he could feel the steady bump of a pulse.</p><p>There was water in one of the pots under the shattered bed frame; luckily it hadn\u2019t spilled. He dipped the end of the plaid in water and used it to mop Fraser\u2019s face. After a few minutes of this ministration, the man\u2019s eyelids began to flutter.</p><p>Fraser coughed, gagged heavily, turned his head to one side, and threw up. Then his eyes shot open, and before Roger could speak or move, Fraser had rolled up onto one knee, his hand on the sgian dhu in his stocking.</p><p>Blue eyes glared at him, and Roger raised an arm in instinctive defense. Then Fraser blinked, shook his head, groaned, and sat down heavily on the earthen floor.</p><p>\u201cOh, it\u2019s you,\u201d he said. He closed his eyes and groaned again. Then his head snapped up, eyes blue and piercing, but this time with alarm rather than fury.</p><p>\u201cClaire!\u201d he exclaimed. \u201cMy wife, where is she?\u201d</p><p>Roger felt his jaw drop.</p><p>\u201cClaire? You brought her here? You brought a woman into this?\u201d</p><p>Fraser gave him a glance of extreme dislike, but wasted no words. Palming the knife from his stocking, he glanced at the doorway. The flap was down; no one was visible. The noise outside had died down, though the rumble of voices was still audible. Now and then one stood out, shouting or raised in exhortation.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a guard,\u201d Roger said.</p><p>Fraser glanced at him and rose to his feet, smooth as a panther. Blood was still running down the side of his face, but it didn\u2019t seem to trouble him. Silently, he flattened himself along the wall, glided to the edge of the door flap, and eased the flap aside with the tip of the tiny dagger. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Fraser grimaced at whatever he saw. Letting the flap swing back in place, he returned and sat down, putting the knife away in his stocking.</p><p>\u201cA good dozen of them just outside. Is that water?\u201d He put out a hand, and Roger silently scooped a gourdful of water and handed it to him. He drank deeply, splashed water in his face, then poured the rest of it over his head.</p><p>Fraser wiped a hand over his battered face, then opened bloodshot eyes and looked at Roger.</p><p>\u201cWakefield, is it?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI go by my own name, these days. MacKenzie.\u201d</p><p>Fraser gave a brief, humorless snort.</p><p>\u201cSo I\u2019ve heard.\u201d He had a wide, expressive mouth\u2014like Bree\u2019s. His lips compressed briefly, then relaxed.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve done wrong to ye, MacKenzie, as ye\u2019ll know. I\u2019ve come to put it right, so far as may be, but it may be as I\u2019ll not have the chance.\u201d He gestured briefly toward the door. \u201cFor now, you\u2019ve my apology. For what satisfaction ye may want of me later\u2014I\u2019ll bide your will. But I\u2019d ask ye to let it wait until we\u2019re safe out of this.\u201d</p><p>Roger stared at him for a moment. Satisfaction for the last months of torment and uncertainty seemed as farfetched a notion as the thought of safety. He nodded.</p> <p>\u201cDone,\u201d he said.</p><p>They sat in silence for several moments. The fire in the hut was burning low, but the wood to feed it was outside; the guards kept charge of anything that might be used as a weapon.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Roger asked at last. He nodded toward the door. \u201cOut there?\u201d</p><p>Fraser took a deep breath and let it out in a sigh. For the first time, Roger noticed that he held the elbow of his right arm cradled in his left palm, the arm itself held close to the body.</p><p>\u201cI will be damned if I know,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cThey did burn the priest? He\u2019s dead?\u201d There could be no doubt of it after what he\u2019d seen, but still Roger felt compelled to ask.</p> <p>\u201cHe was a priest?\u201d Thick reddish brows rose in surprise, then fell. \u201cAye, he\u2019s dead. And not only him.\u201d An involuntary shudder went over the Highlander\u2019s big frame.</p><p>Fraser hadn\u2019t known what they meant to do when the drums began to sound, and everyone went out to gather by the great fire. There was plenty of talk, but his knowledge of the Mohawk tongue was insufficient to make out what was happening, and his nephew, who spoke the tongue, was nowhere to be found.</p><p>The whites had not been invited, but no one made any move to keep them away. And so it was that he and Claire had come to be standing on the edge of the crowd, curious onlookers, when the sachem and the Council came out and the old man began to speak. Another man had spoken, too, very angrily.</p><p>\u201cThen they brought the man out, nak*d as a tadpole, bound him to a stake, and started in upon him.\u201d He paused, eyes shadowed, and glanced at Roger.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll tell ye, man, I\u2019ve seen French executioners keep a man alive who wished he weren\u2019t. It wasna worse than that\u2014but no a great deal better.\u201d Fraser drank again, thirstily, and lowered the cup.</p><p>\u201cI tried to take Claire away\u2014 I didna ken but what they meant to attack us next.\u201d The crowd was pressed so tight around them, though, that movement was impossible; there was no choice but to go on watching.</p><p>Roger\u2019s mouth felt dry, and he reached for the cup. He didn\u2019t want to ask, but he felt a perverse need to know\u2014whether for Alexandre\u2019s sake or for his own.</p><p>\u201cDid he\u2014cry out at all?\u201d</p> <p>Fraser gave him another glance of surprise, then something like understanding crossed his face.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said slowly. \u201cHe died verra well\u2014by their lights. Ye will have been knowing the man?\u201d</p><p>Roger nodded, wordless. It was difficult to believe Alexandre was gone, even hearing this. And where had he gone? Surely he could not have been right. I will not be forgiven. Surely not. No just God\u2014</p><p>Roger shook his head hard, pushing the thought away. It was plain that Fraser had no more than half his mind on his story, horrific as it was. He kept glancing at the door, a look of anxious expectation on his face. Was he expecting rescue?</p><p>\u201cHow many men did you bring with you?\u201d</p><p>The blue eyes flashed, surprised.</p><p>\u201cMy nephew Ian.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s all?\u201d Roger tried to keep the stunned disbelief out of his voice, but patently failed.</p><p>\u201cYe were expecting the 78th Hieland regiment?\u201d Fraser asked sarcastically. He got to his feet, swaying slightly, arm pressed to his side. \u201cI brought whisky.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhisky? Did that have anything to do with the fighting?\u201d Remembering the reek of the man who had fallen over him, Roger nodded toward the wall of the longhouse.</p><p>\u201cIt may have.\u201d</p><p>Fraser went to the wall with the cracked panel, and pressed an eye against the opening, staring out at the clearing for some time before returning to the dwindling fire. Things had gone quiet outside.</p><p>The big Highlander was looking more than unwell. His face was white and sheened with sweat under the streaks of dried blood. Roger silently poured more water; it was as silently accepted. He knew well enough what was wrong with Fraser, and it wasn\u2019t the effects of injury.</p><p>\u201cWhen you last saw her\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen the fighting broke out.\u201d Unable to stay seated, Fraser set down the cup and got to his feet again, prowling the confines of the longhouse like a restless bear. He paused, glancing at Roger.</p><p>\u201cWill ye maybe ken a bit what happened there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could guess.\u201d He acquainted Fraser with the priest\u2019s story, finding some small respite from worry in the telling.</p><p>\u201cThey wouldn\u2019t have harmed her,\u201d he said, trying to reassure himself as much as Fraser. \u201cShe\u2019d nothing to do with it.\u201d</p><p>Fraser gave a derisory snort.</p><p>\u201cAye, she did.\u201d Without warning, he smashed a fist against the ground, in a muffled thump of fury. \u201cDamn the woman!\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019ll be all right,\u201d Roger repeated stubbornly. He couldn\u2019t bear to think otherwise, but he knew what Fraser plainly knew as well\u2014if Claire Fraser was alive, unhurt, and free, nothing could have kept her from her husband\u2019s side. And as for the unknown nephew...</p><p>\u201cI heard your nephew\u2014in the fight. I heard him call out to you. He sounded all right.\u201d Even as he offered this bit of information, he knew how feeble it was as reassurance. Fraser nodded, though, head bent on his knees.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a good lad, Ian,\u201d he murmured. \u201cAnd he has friends among the Mohawk. God send they will protect him.\u201d</p><p>Roger\u2019s curiosity was coming back, as the shock of the evening began to fade.</p><p>\u201cYour wife,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat did she do? How could she possibly have been involved in this?\u201d</p><p>Fraser sighed. He scrubbed his good hand over his face and through his hair, rubbing until the loose red locks stood up in knots and snarls.</p><p>\u201cI shouldna have said so,\u201d he said. \u201cIt wasna her fault in the least. It\u2019s only\u2014she\u2019ll not be killed, but God, if they\u2019ve harmed her...\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey won\u2019t,\u201d Roger said firmly. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>Fraser shrugged and closed his eyes. Head tilted back, he described the scene as though he could still see it, engraved on the inside of his eyelids. Perhaps he could.</p><p>\u201cI didna take heed of the girl, in such a crowd. I couldna even say what she looked like. It was only at the last that I saw her.\u201d</p><p>Claire had been by his side, white-faced and rigid in the press of shouting, swaying bodies. When the Indians had nearly finished with the priest, they untied him from the stake and fastened his hands instead to a long pole, held above his head, from which to suspend him in the flames.</p><p>Fraser glanced at him, wiping the back of a hand across his lips.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve seen a man\u2019s heart pulled beating from his chest before,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I hadna seen it eaten before his eyes.\u201d He spoke almost shyly, as though apologizing for his squeamishness. Shocked, he had looked to Claire. It was then that he had seen the Indian girl standing on Claire\u2019s other side, with a cradleboard in her arms.</p><p>With great calmness, the girl had handed the board to Claire, then turned and slipped through the crowd.</p><p>\u201cShe didna look to left or right, but walked straight into the fire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Roger\u2019s throat closed with shock, the exclamation emerging in a strangled croak.</p><p>The flames had embraced the girl in moments. A head taller than the folk near him, Jamie had seen everything clearly.</p><p>\u201cHer clothes caught, and then her hair. By the time she reached him, she was burning like a torch.\u201d Still, he had seen the dark silhouette of her arms, raised to embrace the empty body of the priest. Within moments, it was no longer possible to distinguish man or woman; there was only the one figure, black amid the towering flames.</p><p>\u201cIt was then everything went mad.\u201d Fraser\u2019s wide shoulders slumped a little, and he touched the gash in his temple. \u201cAll I ken is one woman set up a howl, and then there was the hell of a screech, and of a sudden, everyone was either fleeing or fighting.\u201d</p><p>He had himself tried to do both, shielding Claire and her burden while fighting his way out of the thrashing press of bodies. There were too many of them, though. Unable to escape, he had pushed Claire against the wall of a longhouse, seized a stick of wood with which to defend them, and shouted for Ian, while wielding his makeshift club on anyone reckless enough to come near.</p><p>\u201cThen a wee fiend leapt out o\u2019 the smoke, and struck me with his club.\u201d He shrugged, one-shouldered. \u201cI turned to fight him off, and then there were three of them on me.\u201d Something had caught him in the temple, and he had known no more till waking in the longhouse with Roger.</p><p>\u201cI havena seen Claire since. Nor Ian.\u201d</p><p>The fire had burned itself to coals, and it was growing cold in the longhouse. Jamie unfastened his brooch and pulled the plaid around his shoulders as well as he could, one-handed, and leaned gingerly back against the wall.</p><p>His right arm might be broken; he\u2019d taken a blow from one of the war clubs just below the shoulder, and the stricken spot went from numbness to blinding pain with no warning. That was of no moment, though, compared with his worry for Claire and wee Ian.</p><p>It was very late. If Claire hadn\u2019t been hurt in the fighting, she was likely safe enough, he told himself. The old woman wouldn\u2019t countenance harm done to her. As for Ian, though\u2014he felt a moment\u2019s pride in the lad, in spite of his fear. Ian was a bonny fighter, and a credit to the uncle who\u2019d taught him.</p><p>If he should have been overcome, though...there had been so many of the savages, and with the fighting so hot...</p><p>He shifted restlessly, trying not to think of facing his sister with ill news of her youngest boy. Christ, he\u2019d rather have his own heart torn from his breast and eaten before his eyes; it would feel much the same.</p><p>Seeking distraction\u2014any distraction\u2014from his fears, he shifted again, taking random stock of the shadowy insides of the house. Bare as a Skyeman\u2019s cupboard, for the most part. A jug of water, a broken bed frame, and one or two tattered skins for bedding lying crumpled on the earthen floor. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>MacKenzie was sitting hunched across the fire, heedless of the growing chill. His arms were wrapped about his knees, head bent in thought. He was half turned away, unaware of Jamie\u2019s eye on him.</p><p>He grudged to admit it, but the man was decently made. Long shanks and a good breadth through the shoulders; he\u2019d have a fair reach with a sword. He was tall as the MacKenzies of Leoch\u2014and why not? he thought suddenly. The man was Dougal\u2019s get, if a few generations onward.</p><p>He found that notion both disturbing and oddly comforting. He\u2019d killed men when he must, and mostly their ghosts let him sleep at night with no great rattling of bones. Dougal\u2019s death, though, was one that he had lived through more than once, and woke from sweating, with the sound of those last silent words of Dougal\u2019s ringing in his ears; words mouthed in blood.</p><p>There\u2019d been not the slightest choice; it was kill or be killed, and a near thing either way. And yet...Dougal MacKenzie had been his foster father, and if he was honest, a part of him had loved the man.</p> <p>Yes, it was some comfort to know that a small part of Dougal was left. The other part of this MacKenzie\u2019s heritage was a wee bit more troubling. He\u2019d seen the man\u2019s eyes first thing when he woke, bright green and intent, and for one second his wame had shriveled up into a ball, thinking of Geillis Duncan.</p><p>Did he much want his daughter linked with a witch\u2019s spawn? He eyed the man covertly. Perhaps it was as well if Brianna\u2019s child was not of this man\u2019s blood.</p><p>\u201cBrianna,\u201d MacKenzie said, lifting his head suddenly from his knees. \u201cWhere is she?\u201d</p><p>Jamie jerked, and a hot knife-blade seared his arm, leaving him sweating.</p><p>\u201cWhere?\u201d he said. \u201cAt River Run, with her aunt. She\u2019s safe.\u201d His heart was thundering in his ears. Christ, was the man able to read thoughts? Or had he the Sight?</p> <p>The green eyes were steady, dark in the dim light.</p><p>\u201cWhy did you bring Claire, and not Brianna? Why did she not come with you?\u201d</p><p>Jamie returned the man\u2019s cool look. They\u2019d see if it was a matter of mind reading or not. If not, the last thing he meant to tell MacKenzie now was the truth; time enough for that when\u2014if\u2014they were safely away.</p><p>\u201cI should have left Claire as well, if I thought I could. She\u2019s a stubborn wee besom. Short of tying her hand and foot, I couldna prevent her coming.\u201d</p><p>Something dark flickered in MacKenzie\u2019s eyes\u2014doubt, or pain?</p><p>\u201cI should not have thought Brianna the kind of lass to mind her father\u2019s word overmuch,\u201d he said. His voice had an edge to it\u2014yes, pain, and a sort of jealousy.</p> <p>Jamie relaxed slightly. No mind reading.</p><p>\u201cDid ye no? Well, and perhaps ye dinna ken her so well as all that,\u201d he said. Pleasantly enough, but with a jeering undertone that would make one sort of man go for his throat.</p><p>MacKenzie wasn\u2019t that sort. He sat up straight, and drew a deep breath.</p><p>\u201cI know her well,\u201d he said levelly. \u201cShe is my wife.\u201d</p><p>Jamie sat up straight in turn, and clenched his teeth on a hiss of pain.</p><p>\u201cThe hell she is.\u201d</p><p>MacKenzie\u2019s black brows drew down at that.</p><p>\u201cWe are handfast, she and I. Did she not tell you that?\u201d</p> <p>She hadn\u2019t\u2014but he hadn\u2019t given her much chance to tell him, either. Too furious at the thought of her willing to bed a man, stung at thinking she\u2019d made a fool of him, proud as Lucifer and suffering the Devil\u2019s pains for it, in wishing her perfect and finding her only as human as himself.</p><p>\u201cWhen?\u201d Jamie asked.</p><p>\u201cEarly September, in Wilmington. When I\u2014just before I left her.\u201d The admission came unwillingly, and through the black veil of his own guilt he saw a reflection of it on MacKenzie\u2019s face. As well deserved as his own, he thought viciously. If the coward had not left her...</p><p>\u201cShe didna tell me.\u201d</p><p>He saw the doubt and the pain in MacKenzie\u2019s eyes quite clearly now. The man worried that Brianna did not want him\u2014for if she did, she would have come. He knew well enough that no power on earth or below it would keep Claire from his side if she thought him in danger\u2014and felt a jolt of fear renewed at that thought; for where was she?</p><p>\u201cI suppose she thought you wouldn\u2019t see handfasting as a legal form of marriage,\u201d MacKenzie said quietly.</p><p>\u201cOr perhaps she didna see it so herself,\u201d Jamie suggested cruelly. He could relieve the man\u2019s mind by telling him a part of the truth\u2014that Brianna had not come because she was with child\u2014but he was in no charitable mood.</p><p>It was getting quite dark, but even so he could see MacKenzie\u2019s face flush at that, and his hands clench on the ragged deerskin.</p><p>\u201cI saw it so,\u201d was all he said.</p><p>Jamie closed his eyes, and said no more. The last coals in the fire died slowly, leaving them in darkness.</p><p>61</p><p>THE OFFICE OF A PRIEST</p><p>The smell of burnt things hung in the air. We passed close by the pit and I couldn\u2019t help seeing from the corner of my eye the heap of charred fragments, shattered ends frosted white with ash. I hoped it was wood. I was afraid to look directly.</p><p>I stumbled on the frozen ground, and my escort caught me by the arm. Pulled me up without comment and pushed me toward a longhouse where two men stood on guard, huddled against a cold wind that filled the air with drifting ashes.</p><p>I had not slept and had not eaten, though food was offered. My feet and my fingers were cold. There was keening from a longhouse at the far end of the village, and over it the louder formal chant of a death song. Was it for the girl that they sang, or someone else? I shivered.</p><p>The guards glanced at me and stood aside. I lifted the hide flap at the door and went in.</p><p>It was dark; the fire inside as dead as the one outside. Gray light from the smokehole gave me enough illumination to see an untidy heap of skins and cloth on the floor, though. A patch of red tartan showed amid the jumble, and I felt a surge of relief.</p><p>\u201cJamie!\u201d</p><p>The pile heaved and came apart. Jamie\u2019s rumpled head popped up, alert but looking a good deal the worse for wear. Next to him was a dark, bearded man who seemed oddly familiar. Then he moved into the light, and I caught the flash of green eyes above the shrubbery.</p><p>\u201cRoger!\u201d I exclaimed.</p><p>Without a word he rose out of the blankets and clasped me in his arms. He held so tight, I could hardly breathe.</p><p>He was terribly thin; I could feel every one of his ribs. Not starved, though; he stank, but with the normal scents of dirt and stale sweat, not the yeasty effluvium of starvation.</p><p>\u201cRoger, are you all right?\u201d He let go, and I looked him up and down, searching for any signs of injury.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he said. His voice was husky, from sleep and emotion. \u201cBree? She\u2019s all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s fine,\u201d I assured him. \u201cWhat\u2019s happened to your foot?\u201d He wore nothing but a tattered shirt and a stained rag wrapped around one foot.</p><p>\u201cA cut. Nothing. Where is she?\u201d He clutched my arm, anxious.</p><p>\u201cAt a place called River Run, with her great-aunt. Didn\u2019t Jamie tell you? She\u2019s\u2014\u201d</p><p>I was interrupted by Jamie clutching my other arm.</p><p>\u201cAre ye all right, Sassenach?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, of course I\u2014my God, what happened to you?\u201d My attention was momentarily distracted from Roger by the sight of Jamie. It wasn\u2019t the nasty contusion on his temple or the dried blood on his shirt that struck my notice, so much as the unnatural way he held his right arm.</p><p>\u201cMy arm\u2019s maybe broken,\u201d he said. \u201cHurts like a bugger. Will ye come and tend to it?\u201d</p><p>Without waiting for an answer he turned and walked away, sitting down heavily near the broken bed frame. I gave Roger a brief pat and went after him, wondering what the hell. Jamie wouldn\u2019t admit to being in pain in front of Roger Wakefield, if splintered raw bone were sticking out of his flesh.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you up to?\u201d I muttered, kneeling beside him. I felt the arm gingerly through his shirt\u2014no compound fractures. I rolled it carefully up for a better look.</p><p>\u201cI havena told him about Brianna,\u201d he said, very softly. \u201cAnd I think it better you do not.\u201d</p><p>I stared at him.</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t do that! He has to know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKeep your voice down. Aye, he maybe should know about the bairn\u2014but not the other, not Bonnet.\u201d</p><p>I bit my lip, feeling gingerly down the swell of his biceps. He had one of the worst bruises I had ever seen; a huge mottled splotch of purple-blue\u2014but I was fairly sure the arm wasn\u2019t broken.</p><p>I wasn\u2019t so sure about his suggestion.</p><p>He could see the doubt on my face; he squeezed my hand hard.</p><p>\u201cNot yet; not here. Let it wait, at least until we\u2019re safe away.\u201d</p><p>I thought for a moment, as I ripped the sleeve of his shirt and used it to make a rough sling. Learning that Brianna was pregnant was going to be a shock by itself. Perhaps Jamie was right; there was no telling how Roger would react to the news of the rape, and we were a long way from being home free yet. Better he should have his head clear. At last I nodded, reluctantly.</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d I said aloud, getting up. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s broken, but the sling will help.\u201d</p><p>I left Jamie sitting on the ground and went to Roger, feeling like a Ping-Pong ball.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s the foot?\u201d I knelt to unwrap the unsanitary-looking rag around it, but he stopped me with an urgent hand on my shoulder.</p><p>\u201cBrianna. I know there\u2019s something wrong. Is she\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s pregnant.\u201d</p><p>Whatever possibilities he had been turning over in his mind, that hadn\u2019t been among them. It isn\u2019t possible to mistake sheer amazement. He blinked, looking as though I\u2019d hit him on the head with an ax.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019ll be seven months gone by now; it\u2019s noticeable.\u201d Jamie had come up so quietly that neither of us had heard him. He spoke coldly, and looked even colder, but Roger was well beyond noticing subtleties.</p><p>Excitement brightened his eyes, and his shocked face came alive beneath the black whiskers.</p><p>\u201cPregnant. My God, but how?\u201d</p><p>Jamie made a derisive noise in the back of his throat. Roger glanced at him, then quickly away.</p><p>\u201cThat is, I never thought\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow? Aye, ye didna think, and it\u2019s my daughter left to pay the price of your pleasure!\u201d</p><p>Roger\u2019s head snapped round at that, and he glared at Jamie.</p><p>\u201cShe is not left, in any way! I told you she is my wife!\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe is?\u201d I said, startled in the midst of my unwrapping.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re handfast,\u201d Jamie said, very grudgingly. \u201cWhy could the lass not have told us, though?\u201d</p><p>I thought I could answer that one\u2014in more than one way. The second answer wasn\u2019t one I could suggest in front of Roger, though.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t said, because she was with child, and thought it was Bonnet\u2019s. Believing that, she might have thought it better not to reveal their handfasting, so as to leave Roger an escape\u2014if he wanted it.</p><p>\u201cMost likely because she thought you wouldn\u2019t see that as a true marriage,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019d told her about our wedding; about the contract and how you insisted on marrying me in church, with a priest. She wouldn\u2019t want to tell you anything she thought you might not approve of\u2014she wanted so badly to please you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Jamie had the grace to look abashed at this, but Roger ignored the argument.</p><p>\u201cIs she well?\u201d he asked, leaning forward and grasping my arm.</p><p>\u201cYes, she\u2019s fine,\u201d I assured him, hoping it was still true. \u201cShe wanted to come with us, but of course we couldn\u2019t let her do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe wanted to come?\u201d His face lighted up, joy and relief plain to see, even through the hair and filth. \u201cThen she didn\u2019t\u2014\u201d He stopped abruptly, and glanced from me to Jamie and back. \u201cWhen I met...Mr. Fraser on the mountainside, he seemed to think that she\u2014er\u2014had said\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cA terrible misunderstanding,\u201d I put in hastily. \u201cShe hadn\u2019t told us about the handfasting, so when she turned up pregnant, we, er...assumed...\u201d Jamie was brooding, looking at Roger with no particular favor, but jerked into awareness when I nudged him sharply.</p><p>\u201cOh, aye,\u201d he said, a little grudgingly. \u201cA mistake. I\u2019ve given Mr. Wakefield my apologies and told him I shall do my best to see it right. But we\u2019ve other things to think of now. Have ye seen Ian, Sassenach?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I became aware for the first time that Ian was not with them, and felt a small lurch of fear in the pit of my stomach. Jamie looked grim.</p><p>\u201cWhere have ye been all night, Sassenach?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was with\u2014oh, Jesus!\u201d</p> <p>I ignored his question for a moment, caught up in the sight of Roger\u2019s foot. The flesh was swollen and reddened over half his foot, with a severe ulceration on the outer margin of the sole. I pressed firmly, a little way in, and felt the nasty give of small pockets of pus under the skin.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI cut it, trying to get away. They bound it and put things on it, but it\u2019s been infected on and off. It gets better, and then it gets worse.\u201d He shrugged; his attention wasn\u2019t on his foot, ugly as it was. He looked up at Jamie, evidently having come to a decision.</p><p>\u201cBrianna didn\u2019t send you to meet me, then? She didn\u2019t ask you to\u2014get rid of me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Jamie said, taken by surprise. He smiled briefly, his features suffused with sudden charm. \u201cThat was my own notion.\u201d</p><p>Roger drew a deep breath and closed his eyes briefly.</p> <p>\u201cThank God,\u201d he said, and opened them. \u201cI thought perhaps she\u2019d\u2014we\u2019d had a terrible argument, just before I left her, and I thought maybe that was why she hadn\u2019t told you about the handfasting; that she\u2019d decided she didn\u2019t want to be married to me.\u201d There was sweat on his forehead, either from the news or from my handling of his foot. He smiled, a little painfully. \u201cHaving me beaten to death or sold into slavery seemed a trifle extreme, though, even for a woman with her temper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmphm.\u201d Jamie was slightly flushed. \u201cI did say I was sorry for it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d Roger looked at him for a minute, evidently making up his mind about something. He took a deep breath, then bent down and put my hand gently away from his foot. He straightened up and met Jamie\u2019s eyes, dead-on.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve something to tell you. What we fought over. Has she told you what brought her here\u2014to find you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe death notice? Aye, she\u2019s told us. Ye dinna think I\u2019d allow Claire to come with me otherwise?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Puzzled wariness showed in Roger\u2019s eyes.</p><p>\u201cYe canna have it both ways. If she and I are to die at Fraser\u2019s Ridge six years from now, we canna very well be killed by the Iroquois any time before that, now can we?\u201d</p><p>I stared at him; that particular implication had escaped me. Rather staggering; practical immortality\u2014for a time. But that was assuming\u2014</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s assuming that you can\u2019t change the past\u2014that we can\u2019t, I mean. Do you believe that?\u201d Roger leaned forward a little, intent.</p><p>\u201cI will be damned if I know. Do you think so?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Roger said flatly. \u201cI do think the past can\u2019t be changed. That\u2019s why I did it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid what?\u201d</p><p>He licked his lips, but went doggedly on.</p><p>\u201cI found that death notice long before Brianna did. I thought, though, that it would be useless to try to change things. So I\u2014I kept it from her.\u201d He looked from me to Jamie. \u201cSo now you know. I didn\u2019t want her to come; I did everything I could to keep her away from you. I thought it was too dangerous. And\u2014I was afraid of losing her,\u201d he ended simply.</p><p>To my surprise, Jamie was looking at Roger with sudden approval.</p><p>\u201cYe tried to keep her safe, then? To protect her?\u201d</p><p>Roger nodded, a certain relief lessening the tension in his shoulders.</p><p>\u201cSo you understand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, I do. That\u2019s the first thing I\u2019ve heard that gives me a good opinion of ye, sir.\u201d</p><p>It wasn\u2019t an opinion I shared at the moment.</p><p>\u201cYou found that thing\u2014and didn\u2019t tell her?\u201d I could feel the blood climbing into my cheeks.</p><p>Roger saw the look on my face, and looked away.</p><p>\u201cNo. She...um...she saw it your way, I\u2019m afraid. She thought\u2014well, she said I\u2019d betrayed her, and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you did! Her and us both! Of all the\u2014Roger, how could you do such a thing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe did right,\u201d Jamie said. \u201cAfter all\u2014\u201d I turned on him fiercely, interrupting.</p><p>\u201cHe did not! He deliberately kept it from her, and tried to keep her from\u2014don\u2019t you realize, if he\u2019d succeeded, you\u2019d never have seen her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, I do. And what\u2019s happened to her would not have happened.\u201d His eyes were deep blue, steady on mine. \u201cI would it had been so.\u201d</p><p>I swallowed down my grief and anger, until I thought I could speak again without choking.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think she would have had it so,\u201d I said softly. \u201cAnd it was hers to say.\u201d</p><p>Roger jumped in, before Jamie could reply.</p><p>\u201cYou said what\u2019s happened to her wouldn\u2019t have\u2014you mean, being pregnant?\u201d He didn\u2019t wait for a reply; he had plainly recovered from the shock of the news sufficiently to begin thinking, and was rapidly reaching the same unpleasant conclusions Brianna had come to, some months earlier. He swung his head toward me, eyes wide with shock.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s seven months along, you said. Jesus! She can\u2019t go back!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot now,\u201d I said, with bitter emphasis. \u201cShe might have, when we first found out. I tried to make her go back to Scotland, or at least to the Indies\u2014there\u2019s another...opening, there. But she wouldn\u2019t do it. She wouldn\u2019t go without finding out what happened to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened to me,\u201d he repeated, and glanced at Jamie. Jamie\u2019s shoulders tensed, and he set his jaw.</p><p>\u201cAye,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s my fault, and no remedy for it. She\u2019s trapped here. And I can do nothing for her\u2014save bring ye back to her.\u201d And that, I realized, was why he had not wanted to tell Roger anything; for fear that when he realized Brianna was trapped in the past, Roger would refuse to come back with us. Following her into the past was one thing; staying there forever with her was something else again. Neither was it guilt over Bonnet alone that had eaten Jamie up on our journey here; the Spartan boy with the fox gnawing at his vitals would have recognized a kindred soul on the spot, I thought, looking at him with exasperated tenderness.</p><p>Roger gazed at him, completely at a loss for words.</p><p>Before he could find any, a noise of shuffling footsteps approached the door of the hut. The flap lifted, and a large number of Mohawks came in, one after the other.</p><p>We looked at them in astonishment; there were about fifteen of them, men and women and children, all dressed for traveling, in leggings and furs. One of the older women held a cradleboard, and without hesitation she walked up to Roger and pressed it into his arms, saying something in Mohawk.</p><p>He frowned at her, not understanding. Jamie, suddenly alert, leaned toward her and said a few halting words. She repeated what she had said, impatiently, then looked behind her and motioned to a young man.</p><p>\u201cYou are...priest,\u201d he said haltingly to Roger. He pointed at the cradleboard. \u201cWater.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not a priest.\u201d Roger tried to give the board back to the woman, but she refused to take it.</p><p>\u201cPrees,\u201d she said definitely. \u201cBabtize.\u201d She motioned to one of the younger women, who stepped forward, holding a small bowl made of horn, filled with water.</p><p>\u201cFather Alexandre\u2014he say you priest, son of priest,\u201d said the young man. I saw Roger\u2019s face go pale beneath the beard.</p><p>Jamie had stepped aside, murmuring in French patois to a man he recognized among the crowd. Now he pushed his way back to us.</p><p>\u201cThese are what is left of the priest\u2019s flock,\u201d he said softly. \u201cThe council has told them to leave. They mean to travel to the Huron mission at Ste. Berthe, but they would have the child baptized, lest it die on the journey.\u201d He glanced at Roger. \u201cThey think ye are a priest?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEvidently.\u201d Roger looked down at the child in his arms.</p><p>Jamie hesitated, glancing at the waiting Indians. They stood patiently, their faces calm. I could only guess what lay behind them. Fire and death, exile\u2014what else? There were marks of sorrow on the face of the old woman who brought the baby; she would be its grandmother, I thought.</p><p>\u201cIn case of need,\u201d Jamie said quietly to Roger, \u201cany man may do the office of a priest.\u201d</p><p>I wouldn\u2019t have thought it was possible for Roger to go any whiter, but he did. He swayed briefly, and the old lady, alarmed, reached out a hand to steady the cradleboard.</p><p>He caught himself, though, and nodded to the young woman with the water, to come closer.</p><p>\u201cParlez-vous fran\u00e7ais?\u201d he asked, and heads nodded, some with certainty, some with less.</p><p>\u201cC\u2019est bien,\u201d he said, and taking a deep breath, lifted the cradleboard, showing the child to the congregation. The baby, a round-faced charmer with soft brown curls and a golden skin, blinked sleepily at the change of perspective.</p><p>\u201cHear the words of our Lord Jesus Christ,\u201d he said clearly in French. \u201cObeying the word of our Lord Jesus, and sure of his presence with us, we baptize those whom he has called to be his own.\u201d</p><p>Of course, I thought, watching him. He was the son of a priest, so to speak; he would often enough have seen the Reverend administer the sacrament of baptism. If he didn\u2019t recall the entire service, he seemed to know the general form of it.</p><p>He had the baby passed from hand to hand among the congregation\u2014for so his agreement had made them\u2014following and asking questions of each person there, in a low voice.</p><p>\u201cQui est votre Seigneur, votre Sauveur?\u201d Who is your Lord and Savior?</p><p>\u201cVoulez-vous placer votre foi en Lui?\u201d Do you have faith in Him?</p><p>\u201cDo you promise to tell this child the good news of the gospel, and all that Christ commands, and by your fellowship, to strength his family ties with the household of God?\u201d</p><p>Head after head bobbed in reply.</p><p>\u201cOui, certainement. Je le promets. Nous le ferons.\u201d Yes, of course. I promise. We will. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>At last Roger turned and gave the child to Jamie.</p><p>\u201cWho is your Lord and Savior?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus Christ,\u201d he answered without hesitation, and the baby was handed on to me.</p><p>\u201cDo you trust in him?\u201d</p> <p>I looked down into the face of innocence, and answered for it. \u201cI do.\u201d</p><p>He took the cradleboard, gave it to the grandmother, then dipping a sprig of juniper into the bowl of water, sprinkled water on the baby\u2019s head.</p><p>\u201cI baptize you\u2014\u201d he began, and stopped, with a sudden panicked glance at me.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a girl,\u201d I murmured, and he nodded, lifting the sprig of juniper again.</p><p>\u201cI baptize you, Alexandra, in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, Amen.\u201d</p> <p>After the small band of Christians had left, there were no more visitors. A warrior brought us wood for the fire, and some food, but he ignored Jamie\u2019s questions and left, saying nothing.</p><p>\u201cDo you think they\u2019ll kill us?\u201d Roger asked suddenly, after a period of silence. His mouth twitched in an attempted smile. \u201cKill me, I suppose I mean. Presumably the two of you are safe.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t sound worried. Looking at the deep shadows and lines in his face, I thought that he was simply too exhausted to be afraid anymore.</p><p>\u201cThey won\u2019t kill us,\u201d I said, and pushed a hand through the tangle of my hair. I dimly realized that I, too, was exhausted; I had been without sleep for more than thirty-six hours.</p><p>\u201cI started out to tell you. I spent last night in Tewaktenyonh\u2019s house. The Council of Mothers met there.\u201d</p><p>They hadn\u2019t told me everything; they never would. But at the end of the long hours of ceremony and discussion, the girl who spoke English had told me as much as they wanted me to know, before they sent me back to Jamie.</p> <p>\u201cSome of the young men found the whisky cache,\u201d I said. \u201cThey brought it back to the village yesterday, and started to drink. The women thought they didn\u2019t mean anything dishonest, that they thought the bargain was already made. But then some argument started among them, just before they lit the fire to\u2014to execute the priest. A fight broke out, and some of the men ran into the crowd, and\u2014one thing led to another.\u201d I rubbed a hand hard over my face, trying to keep my thoughts clear enough to speak.</p><p>\u201cA man was killed in the fighting.\u201d I glanced at Roger. \u201cThey think you killed him; did you?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head, shoulders slumping with tiredness.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I\u2014probably. What will they do about it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, it took them a long time to decide, and it isn\u2019t settled yet; they\u2019ve sent word to the main Council, but the sachem hasn\u2019t made a decision yet.\u201d I took a deep breath.</p><p>\u201cThey won\u2019t kill you, because the whisky was taken, and that was offered as the price of your life. But since they\u2019ve decided not to kill us in revenge for their dead, what they usually do instead is to adopt an enemy into the tribe, in replacement of the dead man.\u201d</p><p>That shook Roger out of his numbness.</p><p>\u201cAdopt me? They want to keep me?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOne of us. One of you. I don\u2019t suppose I\u2019d be a suitable replacement, since I\u2019m not a man.\u201d I tried to smile, but failed completely. All the muscles of my face had gone numb.</p><p>\u201cThen it must be me,\u201d Jamie said quietly.</p><p>Roger\u2019s head jerked up, startled.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve said yourself; if the past canna be changed, then nothing will happen to me. Leave me, and as soon as it can be managed, I will escape and come home.\u201d</p><p>He laid a hand on my arm before I could protest.</p><p>\u201cYou and Ian will take MacKenzie back to Brianna.\u201d He looked at Roger, his face inscrutable. \u201cAfter all,\u201d he said quietly, \u201cit\u2019s the two of you she needs.\u201d</p><p>Roger started in at once to argue, but I butted in.</p><p>\u201cMay the Lord deliver me from stubborn Scotsmen!\u201d I said. I glared at the two of them. \u201cThey haven\u2019t decided yet. That\u2019s only what the Council of Mothers says. So there\u2019s no sense in arguing about it until we know for sure. And speaking of knowing things for sure,\u201d I said, in hopes of distracting them, \u201cwhere\u2019s Ian?\u201d</p><p>Jamie stared at me.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he said, and I saw his throat ripple as he swallowed. \u201cBut I hope to God he\u2019s safe in that girl\u2019s bed.\u201d</p><p>No one came. The night passed quietly, though none of us slept well. I dozed fitfully, through sheer exhaustion, waking every time there was a sound outside, my dreams a vivid crazy-quilt of blood and fire and water.</p><p>It was midday before we heard the sound of voices approaching. My heart leapt as I recognized one of them, and Jamie was on his feet before the door flap lifted.</p><p>\u201cIan? Is that you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, Uncle. It\u2019s me.\u201d</p><p>His voice sounded odd; breathless and uncertain. He stepped into the light from the smokehole and I gasped, feeling as though I had been punched in the stomach.</p><p>The hair had been plucked from the sides of his skull; what was left stood up in a thick crest from his scalp, a long tail hanging down his back. One ear had been freshly pierced and sported a silver earring.</p><p>His face had been tattooed. Double crescent lines of small dark spots, most still scabbed with dried blood, ran across each cheekbone, to meet at the bridge of his nose.</p><p>\u201cI\u2014canna stay long, Uncle,\u201d Ian said. He looked pale, under the lines of tattooing, but stood erect. \u201cI said they must let me come to say goodbye.\u201d</p><p>Jamie had gone white to the lips.</p><p>\u201cJesus, Ian,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>\u201cThe naming ceremony is tonight,\u201d Ian said, trying not to look at us. \u201cThey say that after that I will be Indian, and I must not speak any tongue but the Kahnyen\u2019kehaka; I canna speak again in English, or the Gaelic.\u201d He smiled painfully. \u201cAnd I ken ye didna have much Mohawk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIan, ye canna be doing this!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve done it, Uncle Jamie,\u201d Ian said softly. He looked at me then.</p><p>\u201cAuntie. Will ye say to my mother that I willna forget her? My Da will know, I think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Ian!\u201d I hugged him hard, and his arms went gently around me.</p><p>\u201cYe can leave in the morning,\u201d he said to Jamie. \u201cThey willna prevent ye.\u201d</p><p>I let him go, and he crossed the hut to where Roger stood, looking stunned. Ian offered him a hand.</p><p>\u201cI am sorry for what we did to ye,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cYe\u2019ll take good care of my cousin and the bairn?\u201d</p><p>Roger took his hand and shook it. He cleared his throat and found his voice.</p><p>\u201cI will,\u201d he said. \u201cI promise.\u201d</p><p>Then Ian turned to Jamie.</p><p>\u201cNo, Ian,\u201d he said. \u201cGod, no, lad. Let it be me!\u201d</p><p>Ian smiled, though his eyes were full of tears. \u201cYe said to me once, that my life wasna meant to be wasted,\u201d he said. \u201cIt won\u2019t be.\u201d He held out his arms. \u201cI willna forget you, either, Uncle Jamie.\u201d</p><p>They took Ian to the bank of the river, just before sunset. He stripped and waded into the freezing water, accompanied by three women, who ducked and pummeled him, laughing and scrubbing him with handfuls of sand. Rollo ran up and down the bank, barking madly, then plunged into the river and joined in what he plainly saw as fun and games, coming close to drowning Ian in the process.</p><p>All of the spectators who lined the bank found it hilarious\u2014save the three whites.</p><p>Once the white blood had been thus ceremonially scrubbed from Ian\u2019s body, more women dried him, dressed him in fresh clothing, and took him to the Council longhouse for the naming ceremony.</p><p>Everyone crowded inside; all of the village was there. Jamie, Roger, and I stood silently in a corner, watching as the sachem sang and spoke over him, as the drums beat, as the pipe was lit and passed from hand to hand. The girl he called Emily stood near him, eyes shining as she looked at him. I saw him look back at her, and the light that sprang up in his own eyes did a little to ease the soreness of my heart.</p><p>They called him Wolf\u2019s Brother. His brother wolf sat panting at Jamie\u2019s feet, viewing the proceedings with interest.</p><p>At the end of the ceremony a small hush fell on the crowd, and at that moment Jamie stepped out of the corner. All heads turned as he crossed to Ian, and I saw more than one warrior tense in disapproval.</p><p>He unpinned the brooch from his plaid, unbelted it, and laid the length of bloodstained crimson tartan across his nephew\u2019s shoulder.</p><p>\u201cCuimhnich,\u201d he said softly, and stepped back. Remember.</p><p>All of us were quiet as we made our way down the narrow trail that led away from the village next morning. Ian had taken a formal, white-faced farewell of us as he stood with his new family. I hadn\u2019t been so stalwart, though, and seeing my tears made Ian bite his lip to hold back his own emotion. Jamie had embraced him, kissed his mouth and left him, without speaking a word.</p><p>Jamie went about the business of setting camp that night with his usual efficiency, but I could tell that his mind was somewhere else. And no wonder if it was; my own was divided in worry between Ian behind us and Brianna ahead of us, with very little attention to spare for present circumstances.</p><p>Roger dumped an armload of wood beside the fire and sat down next to me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been thinking,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cAbout Brianna.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you? So have I.\u201d I was so tired, I thought I might tumble headfirst into the flames before I got the water boiling.</p><p>\u201cYou said there was another circle\u2014opening, whatever it is\u2014in the Indies?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d I thought briefly of telling him all about Geilie Duncan and the cave at Abandawe, and dismissed it. I hadn\u2019t the energy. Another time. Then I jerked out of my mental fog, catching what he was saying.</p><p>\u201cAnother one? Here?\u201d I looked wildly around, as though expecting to see a menhir standing menacingly at my back.</p><p>\u201cNot here,\u201d he said. \u201cSomewhere between here and Fraser\u2019s Ridge, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d I tried to gather my scattered thoughts. \u201cYes, I know there is, but\u2014\u201d Then it penetrated, and I grabbed his arm. \u201cYou mean you know where it is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou knew about it?\u201d He stared at me in astonishment.</p><p>\u201cYes, I\u2014here, look...\u201d I scrabbled in my pouch and came up with the opal. He grabbed it from me before I could explain.</p><p>\u201cLook! It\u2019s the same; this same symbol\u2014it\u2019s carved on the rock in the circle. Where the hell did you get this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a long story,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you later. But for now\u2014do you know where this circle is? You\u2019ve actually seen it?\u201d</p><p>Jamie, attracted by our excitement, had come to see what was going on.</p><p>\u201cA circle?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA time-circle, an opening, a\u2014a\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been there,\u201d Roger said, interrupting my stuttering explanations. \u201cI found it by accident while I was trying to escape.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCould you find it again? How far is it from River Run?\u201d My mind was making frantic calculations. A little more than seven months. If it took six weeks to return, Brianna would be eight and a half months gone. Could we possibly take her into the mountains in time? And if we could\u2014what would be the greater risk, to travel through a time-passage on the verge of delivery, or to stay in the past permanently? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Roger dug in the waistband of his ragged breeches and brought out a strand of thread, grimy and knotted. \u201cHere,\u201d he said, grasping a double knot. \u201cIt was eight days past the day that they took me. Eight days from Fraser\u2019s Ridge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd a week, at least, from River Run to the Ridge.\u201d I let myself breathe again, not sure whether I felt disappointment or relief. \u201cWe\u2019d never make it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut the weather is turning,\u201d Jamie said. He nodded toward a big blue spruce, its needles wet and dripping. \u201cWhen we came, that tree was cased in ice.\u201d He looked at me. \u201cThe traveling may be easier; we may make better time\u2014or not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr not.\u201d I shook my head reluctantly. \u201cYou know as well as I do that spring means mud. And mud is worse to travel in than snow.\u201d I felt my heart begin to slow down, accepting it. \u201cNo, it\u2019s too late, too risky. She\u2019ll have to stay.\u201d</p> <p>Jamie was gazing at Roger, over the fire.</p><p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t,\u201d he said.</p><p>Roger looked at him, startled.</p><p>\u201cI\u2014\u201d he began, then firmed his jaw and started over. \u201cI do. You don\u2019t think I\u2019d leave her? And my child?\u201d</p><p>I opened my mouth, and felt Jamie stiffen beside me in warning.</p> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d I said sharply. \u201cNo. We have to tell him. Brianna will. Better he should know now. If it makes a difference to him, then it\u2019s better he knows before he sees her.\u201d</p><p>Jamie\u2019s lips pressed tight together, but he nodded.</p><p>\u201cAye,\u201d he said. \u201cTell him, then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me what?\u201d Roger\u2019s dark hair was loose, rising around his head in the evening wind. He looked more alive than he had since we had found him, alarmed and excited at once. I bit the bullet.</p><p>\u201cIt may not be your child,\u201d I said.</p><p>His expression didn\u2019t change for a moment; then the words fell into place. He grabbed me by the arms, so suddenly that I yelped with alarm.</p> <p>\u201cWhat do you mean? What\u2019s happened?\u201d</p><p>Jamie moved like a striking snake. He caught Roger a short, sharp blow under the chin that loosened his grip and sent him sprawling backward on the ground.</p><p>\u201cShe means that when ye left my daughter to her own devices, she was raped,\u201d he said roughly. \u201cTwo days past the time ye lay with her. So maybe the wean\u2019s yours, and maybe it\u2019s not.\u201d</p><p>He glared down at Roger.</p><p>\u201cSo. D\u2019ye mean to stand by her, or no?\u201d</p><p>Roger shook his head, trying to clear it, and got slowly back to his feet.</p><p>\u201cRaped. Who? Where?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn Wilmington. A man named Stephen Bonnet. He\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBonnet?\u201d It was only too clear from Roger\u2019s expression that the name was familiar. He stared wildly from me to Jamie and back. \u201cBrianna was raped by Stephen Bonnet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I said.\u201d Suddenly all the rage Jamie had been holding since our exit from the village broke loose. He seized Roger by the throat and slammed him into a tree trunk.</p><p>\u201cAnd where were you when it was done, ye coward? She was angry with ye, and so ye ran away and left her! If ye thought ye must go, why did ye not see her safe into my keeping first?\u201d</p><p>I grabbed Jamie\u2019s arm and yanked.</p><p>\u201cLet go of him!\u201d</p><p>He did, and whirled away, breathing hard. Roger, shaken and almost as furious as Jamie, shook down his ruffled clothing.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t leave because we argued! I left to find this!\u201d He snatched a handful of his loose breeches, and ripped at the cloth. A spark of green brightness glowed in the palm of his hand.</p><p>\u201cI risked my life to get that, to see her safe back through the stones! Do you know where I went to get it, who I got it from? Stephen Bonnet! That\u2019s why it took me so long to come to Fraser\u2019s Ridge; he wasn\u2019t where I expected him to be; I had to ride up and down the coast to find him.\u201d</p><p>Jamie was frozen, staring at the gemstone. So was I.</p><p>\u201cI shipped with Stephen Bonnet, from Scotland.\u201d Roger was growing a little calmer. \u201cHe is a\u2014a\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI ken what he is.\u201d Jamie stirred, breaking his trance. \u201cBut what he also may be, is the father of my daughter\u2019s child.\u201d He gave Roger a long, cold look. \u201cSo I\u2019m askin\u2019 ye, MacKenzie; can ye go back to her, and live with her, knowing that it\u2019s likely Bonnet\u2019s child she bears? For if ye canna do it\u2014then say so now, for I swear, if ye come to her and treat her badly...I will kill ye without a second thought.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor God\u2019s sake!\u201d I burst out. \u201cGive him a moment to think, Jamie! Can\u2019t you see that he hasn\u2019t had a chance even to take it in, yet?\u201d</p><p>Roger\u2019s fist closed tight over the jewel, then opened. I could hear him breathing, harsh and ragged.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t know!\u201d</p><p>Jamie stooped and picked up the stone, where Roger had dropped it. He flung it hard between Roger\u2019s feet.</p><p>\u201cThen go!\u201d he said. \u201cTake yon cursed stone and find your wicked circle. Get ye gone\u2014for my daughter doesna need a coward!\u201d</p><p>He had not yet unsaddled the horses; he seized his saddlebags and heaved them across the horse\u2019s back. He untied both his horse and mine, and mounted in one fluid motion.</p><p>\u201cCome,\u201d he said to me. I looked helplessly at Roger. He was staring up at Jamie, green eyes glinting with firelight, bright as the emerald in his hand.</p><p>\u201cGo,\u201d he said softly to me, not taking his eyes off Jamie. \u201cIf I can\u2014then I\u2019ll come.\u201d</p><p>My hands and feet seemed not to belong to me; they moved smoothly, without my direction. I walked to my horse, put my foot in the stirrup, and was up.</p><p>When I looked back, even the light of the fire had disappeared. There was nothing behind us but the dark.</p><p>62</p><p>THREE-THIRDS OF A GHOST</p><p>River Run, April 1770</p><p>They have captured Stephen Bonnet.\u201d</p><p>Brianna dropped the game box on the floor. Ivory counters exploded in every direction, and rolled off under the furniture. Speechless, she stood staring at Lord John, who set down his glass of brandy and came hastily to her side.</p><p>\u201cAre you all right? Do you require to sit down? I apologize most profoundly. I should not have\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you should. No, not the sofa, I\u2019ll never get out of it.\u201d She waved away his offered hand, and made her way slowly toward a plain wooden chair near the windows. Once solidly on it, she gave him a long, level look.</p><p>\u201cWhere?\u201d she said. \u201cHow?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t trouble asking whether he ought to send for wine or burnt feathers; she plainly wasn\u2019t going to swoon.</p><p>He drew up a stool beside her, but then thought better, and went to the parlor door. He glanced out into the dark hallway; sure enough, one of the maids was dozing on a stool in the curve of the staircase, available in case they should want anything. The woman\u2019s head snapped up at his step, eyes showing white in the dimness.</p><p>\u201cGo to bed,\u201d he said. \u201cWe shall not require anything further this evening.\u201d</p><p>The slave nodded and shuffled off, relief in the droop of her shoulders; she would have been awake since dawn, and it was near midnight now. He was desperately tired himself, after the long ride from Edenton, but it wasn\u2019t news that could wait. He had arrived in the early evening, but this had been his first opportunity to make an excuse to see Brianna alone.</p><p>He closed the double doors and placed a footstool in front of them, to prevent any interruptions.</p><p>\u201cHe was taken here, in Cross Creek,\u201d he said without preamble, sitting down beside her. \u201cAs to how, I could not say. The charge brought was smuggling. Once they discovered his identity, of course, there were others added.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSmuggling what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTea and brandy. At least this time.\u201d He rubbed the back of his neck, trying to relieve the stiffness caused by hours in the saddle. \u201cI heard of it in Edenton; evidently the man is notorious. His reputation extends from Charleston to Jamestown.\u201d</p><p>He looked closely at her; she was pale, but not ghastly.</p><p>\u201cHe is condemned,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cHe will hang next week, in Wilmington. I thought you would wish to know.\u201d</p><p>She took a deep breath, and let it out slowly, but said nothing. He stole a closer look at her, not wanting to stare, but amazed at the sheer size of her. By God, she was immense! In the two months since their engagement, she had doubled in size, at least.</p><p>One side of her enormous abdomen bulged suddenly out, startling him. He was having second thoughts about the wisdom of having told her; if the shock of his news brought on her confinement prematurely, he would never forgive himself. Jamie wouldn\u2019t forgive him, either.</p><p>She was staring off into space, her brow wrinkled in concentration. He\u2019d seen broodmares in foal look that way; thoroughly absorbed in inward matters. It had been a mistake to send the slave away. He got his feet under him, meaning to go and fetch assistance, but the movement brought her out of her trance.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she said. The frown was still there, but her eyes had lost that distant look; they were fixed on him with a disconcerting blue directness\u2014the more disconcerting for being so familiar.</p><p>\u201cWhen will they hang him?\u201d She leaned forward a little, hand pressed against her side. Another swell rippled across her belly in apparent response to the pressure.</p><p>He sat back, eyeing her stomach uneasily.</p><p>\u201cFriday week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs he in Wilmington now?\u201d</p><p>Slightly reassured by her calm demeanor, he reached for his abandoned glass. He took a sip and shook his head, feeling the comfort of the warm liquor spread through his chest.</p><p>\u201cNo. He is still here; there was no need for trial, as he had been previously convicted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo they\u2019ll move him to Wilmington for the execution? When?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have no idea.\u201d The distant look was back; with deep misgiving, he recognized it this time\u2014not motherly abstraction; calculation.</p><p>\u201cI want to see him.\u201d</p><p>Very deliberately, he swallowed the rest of the brandy.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said definitely, setting down the glass. \u201cEven if your state allowed of travel to Wilmington\u2014which it assuredly does not,\u201d he added, glancing sidelong at her dangerous-looking abdomen\u2014\u201cattendance at an execution could not but have the worst effects upon your child. Now, I am in complete sympathy with your feelings, my dear, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo you aren\u2019t. You don\u2019t know what my feelings are.\u201d She spoke without heat, but with complete conviction. He stared at her for a moment, then got up and went to fetch the decanter.</p><p>She watched the amber liquid purl up in the glass and waited for him to pick it up before she went on.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to watch him die,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cThank God for that,\u201d he muttered, and took a mouthful of brandy.</p><p>\u201cI want to talk to him.\u201d</p><p>The mouthful went down the wrong way and he choked, spluttering brandy over the frills of his shirt.</p><p>\u201cMaybe you should sit down,\u201d she said, squinting at him. \u201cYou don\u2019t look so good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t think why.\u201d Nonetheless, he sat down, and groped for a kerchief to wipe his face. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNow, I know what you\u2019re going to say,\u201d she said firmly, \u201cso don\u2019t bother. Can you arrange for me to see him, before they take him to Wilmington? And before you say no, certainly not, ask yourself what I\u2019ll do if you do say that.\u201d</p><p>Having opened his mouth to say \u201cNo, certainly not,\u201d Lord John shut it and contemplated her in silence for a moment.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t suppose you are intending to threaten me again, are you?\u201d he asked conversationally. \u201cBecause if you are...\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not.\u201d She had the grace to blush slightly at that.</p> <p>\u201cWell, then, I confess I do not see quite what you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll tell my aunt that Stephen Bonnet fathered my baby. And I\u2019ll tell Farquard Campbell. And Gerald Forbes. And Judge Alderdyce. And then I\u2019ll go down to the garrison headquarters\u2014that must be where he is\u2014and I\u2019ll tell Sergeant Murchison. If he won\u2019t let me in, I\u2019ll go to Mr. Campbell for a writ to make him admit me. I have a right to see him.\u201d</p><p>He looked at her narrowly, but he could see it was no idle threat. She sat there, solid and immobile as a piece of marble statuary, and just as susceptible of persuasion.</p><p>\u201cYou do not shrink from creating a monstrous scandal?\u201d It was a rhetorical question; he sought only to buy himself a moment to think.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said calmly. \u201cWhat have I got to lose?\u201d She lifted one eyebrow in a half-humorous quirk.</p> <p>\u201cI suppose you\u2019d have to break our engagement. But if the whole county knows who the baby\u2019s father is, I think that would have the same effect as the engagement, in terms of keeping men from wanting to marry me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour reputation\u2014\u201d he began, knowing it was hopeless.</p><p>\u201cIs not real hot to start with. Though come to that, why should it be worse for me to be pregnant because I was raped by a pirate than because I was wanton, as my father so charmingly put it?\u201d There was a small note of bitterness in her voice that stopped him from saying any more.</p><p>\u201cAnyway, Aunt Jocasta isn\u2019t likely to throw me out, just because I\u2019m scandalous. I won\u2019t starve; neither will the baby. And I can\u2019t say I care whether the Misses MacNeill call on me or not.\u201d</p><p>He took up his glass and drank again, carefully this time, with an eye on her to prevent further shocks. He was curious to know what had passed between her and her father\u2014but not reckless enough to ask. Instead he put down the glass and asked, \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy do you feel you must speak with Bonnet? You say I do not know your feelings, which is undeniably true.\u201d He allowed a tinge of wryness to creep into his voice. \u201cWhatever they are, though, they must be exigent, to cause you to contemplate such drastic expedients.\u201d</p><p>A slow smile grew on her lips, spreading into her eyes.</p><p>\u201cI really like the way you talk,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI am exceeding flattered. However, if you would contemplate answering my question...\u201d</p><p>She sighed, deeply enough to make the flame of the candle flicker. She stood up, moving ponderously, and groped in the seam of her gown. She had evidently had a pocket sewn into it, for she extracted a small piece of paper, folded and worn with much handling.</p><p>\u201cRead that,\u201d she said, handing it to him. She turned away, and went to the far end of the room, where her paints and easel stood in a corner by the hearth.</p><p>The black letters struck him with a small jolt of familiarity. He had seen Jamie Fraser\u2019s hand only once before, but once was enough; it was a distinctive scrawl.</p><p>Daughter\u2014</p> <p>I cannot say if I shall see you again. My fervent hope is that it shall be so, and that all may be mended between us, but that event must rest in the Hand of God. I write now in the event that He may will otherwise.</p><p>You asked me once whether it was right to kill in revenge of the great Wrong done you. I tell you that you must not. For the sake of your Soul, for the sake of your own Life, you must find the grace of forgiveness. Freedom is hardwon, but it is not the fruit of Murder.</p><p>Do not Fear that he will escape Vengeance. Such a man carries with him the seeds of his own Destruction. If he does not Die at my Hand, it will be by another. But it must not be your Hand that strikes him down.</p><p>Hear me, for the sake of the Love I bear you.</p><p>Below the text of the letter, he had written Your most affectionate and loving Father, James Fraser. This was scratched out, and below it was written simply, Da.</p><p>\u201cI never said goodbye to him.\u201d</p><p>Lord John looked up, startled. Her back was turned to him; she was staring at the half-finished landscape on the easel as though it were a window.</p><p>He crossed the carpet to stand beside her. The fire had burned down in the hearth, and it was growing cold in the room. She turned to face him, clutching her elbows against the chill.</p><p>\u201cI want to be free,\u201d she said quietly. \u201cWhether Roger comes back or not. Whatever happens.\u201d</p><p>The child was restless; he could see it kicking and squirming below her crossed arms, like a cat in a sack. He drew a deep breath, feeling chilled and apprehensive.</p><p>\u201cYou are sure you must see Bonnet?\u201d</p><p>She gave him another of those long blue looks.</p><p>\u201cI have to find a way to forgive him, Da says. I\u2019ve been trying, ever since they left, but I can\u2019t do it. Maybe if I see him, I can. I have to try.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right.\u201d He let his breath out in a long sigh, shoulders slumping in capitulation.</p><p>A small light\u2014relief?\u2014showed in her eyes, and he tried to smile back.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll do it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. God knows how, but I\u2019ll do it.\u201d</p><p>He put out all the candles save one, keeping that to light their way to bed. He gave her his arm and they walked in silence through the empty hall, the unpeopled quiet wrapping them in peace. At the foot of the stair, he paused, letting her go ahead of him.</p><p>\u201cBrianna.\u201d</p><p>She turned, questioning, on the stair above him. He stood hesitant, not knowing how to ask for what he suddenly wanted so badly. He reached out a hand, lightly poised.</p><p>\u201cMay I\u2014?\u201d</p><p>Without speaking, she took his hand and pressed it against her belly. It was warm and very firm. They stood quite still for a moment, her hand locked over his. Then it came, a small hard push against his hand, which sent a thrill through his heart.</p><p>\u201cMy God,\u201d he said, in soft delight. \u201cHe\u2019s real.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes met his in rueful amusement.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said. \u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>It was well past dark when they drove up beside the garrison headquarters. It was a small, unprepossessing little building, dwarfed by the loom of the warehouse behind it, and Brianna eyed it askance.</p><p>\u201cThey have him in there?\u201d Her hands felt cold, in spite of being muffled under her cloak.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Lord John glanced around, as he got down to tie the horses. A light burned in the window, but the small dirt yard was empty, the narrow street silent and deserted. There were no houses or shops nearby, and the warehousemen had long since gone home to their suppers and their beds.</p><p>He reached up both hands to help her down; alighting from a wagon was easier than getting out of a carriage, but still no small task.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s in the cellar below the warehouse,\u201d he told her, his voice pitched low. \u201cI\u2019ve bribed the soldier on duty to admit us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot us,\u201d she said, her voice pitched as low as his, but no less firm for that. \u201cMe. I\u2019ll see him alone.\u201d</p><p>She saw his lips compress tightly for a moment, then relax as he nodded.</p><p>\u201cPrivate Hodgepile assures me he is in chains, or I would not countenance such a suggestion. As it is...\u201d He shrugged, half irritably, and took her arm to guide her over the rutted ground.</p><p>\u201cHodgepile?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPrivate Arvin Hodgepile. Why? Are you acquainted?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head, holding her skirts out of the way with her free hand.</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019ve heard the name, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>The door of the building opened, spilling light into the yard.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019ll be you, will it, my lord?\u201d A soldier looked out warily. Hodgepile was slight and narrow-faced, tight-jointed as a marionette. He jerked, startled, as he saw her.</p><p>\u201cOh! I didn\u2019t realize\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou needn\u2019t.\u201d Lord John\u2019s voice was cool. \u201cShow us the way, if you please.\u201d</p><p>With an apprehensive glance at Brianna\u2019s looming bulk, the private brought out a lantern, and led them to a small side door into the warehouse.</p><p>Hodgepile was short as well as slight, but held himself more erect than usual in compensation. He walks with a ramrod up his arse. Yes, she thought, watching him with interest as he marched ahead of them. It had to be the man Ronnie Sinclair had described to her mother. How many Hodgepiles could there be, after all? Perhaps she could talk to him when she\u2019d finished with\u2014her thoughts stopped abruptly as Hodgepile unlocked the warehouse door.</p><p>The April night was cool and fresh, but the air inside was thick with the reek of pitch and turpentine. Brianna felt suffocated. She could almost feel the tiny molecules of resin floating in the air, sticking to her skin. The sudden illusion of being trapped in a block of solidifying amber was so oppressive that she moved suddenly forward, almost dragging Lord John with her.</p><p>The warehouse was nearly full, its vast space crowded with bulky shapes. Kegs of pitch bled sticky black in the farthest shadows, while wooden racks near the huge double doors at the front held piles of barrels; brandy and rum, ready to roll down the ramps and out onto the dock, to barges waiting in the river below.</p><p>Private Hodgepile\u2019s shadow stretched and shrank by turns as he passed between the towering ranks of casks and boxes, his steps muffled by the thick layer of sawdust on the floor.</p><p>\u201c...must be careful of fire...\u201d His high, thin voice floated back to her, and she saw his puppet shadow wave an etiolated hand. \u201cYou will be careful where you set the lantern, won\u2019t you? Though there should be no danger, no danger at all down below...\u201d</p><p>The warehouse was built out over the river, to facilitate loading, and the front part of the floor was wood; the back half of the building was brick-floored. Brianna heard the echo of their footsteps change as they crossed the boundary. Hodgepile paused by a trapdoor set into the bricks.</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t be long, my lord?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo longer than we can help,\u201d Lord John replied tersely. He took the lantern and waited in silence as Hodgepile heaved up the door and propped it. Brianna\u2019s heart was beating heavily; she could feel each separate thump, like a blow to the chest.</p><p>A flight of redbrick stairs ran down into darkness. Hodgepile took out his ring of keys and counted them over in the pool of lantern light, making sure of the right one before descending. He squinted dubiously at Brianna, then motioned them to follow him.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a good thing they made the stairs wide enough for rum casks,\u201d she murmured to Lord John, holding on to his arm as she edged herself down, one step at a time.</p><p>She could see at once why Private Hodgepile wasn\u2019t worried about fire down here; the air was so damp, she wouldn\u2019t have been surprised to see mushrooms sprouting from the walls. There was a sound of dripping water somewhere, and the light of the lantern shone off wet brick. Cockroaches scattered in panic from the light, and the air smelled of mold and mildew. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She thought briefly of her mother\u2019s penicillin farm, less briefly of her mother, and her throat closed tight. Then they were there, and she could no longer distract herself from the realization of what she was doing.</p><p>Hodgepile struggled with the key, and the panic she had been suppressing all day swept over her. She had no idea what to say, what to do. What was she doing here?</p><p>Lord John squeezed her arm in encouragement. She took a deep breath of the dank wet air, ducked her head, and stepped inside.</p><p>He sat on a bench at the far side of the cell, eyes fixed on the door. He\u2019d clearly been expecting someone\u2014he\u2019d heard the footsteps outside\u2014but it wasn\u2019t her. He jerked in startlement, and his eyes flashed briefly green as the light swept over him.</p> <p>She heard a faint metallic clink; of course, they\u2019d said he was in chains. The thought gave her a little courage. She took the lantern from Hodgepile, and shut the door behind her.</p><p>She leaned against the wooden door, studying him in silence. He seemed smaller than she remembered. Perhaps it was only that she was now so much bigger.</p><p>\u201cDo you know who I am?\u201d It was a tiny cell, low-ceilinged, with no echo. Her voice sounded small, but clear.</p><p>He cocked his head to one side, considering. His eyes traveled slowly over her.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think ye were after tellin\u2019 me your name, sweetheart.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t call me that!\u201d The spurt of rage took her by surprise, and she choked it back, clenching her fists behind her. If she had come here to administer forgiveness, it wasn\u2019t a good start.</p><p>He shrugged, good-natured but cool.</p><p>\u201cAs ye will. No, I don\u2019t know who you are. I\u2019ll know your face\u2014and a few other things\u201d\u2014his teeth gleamed briefly in the blond stubble of his beard\u2014\u201cbut not your name. I suppose you\u2019ll mean to tell me, though?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do recognize me?\u201d</p><p>He drew in air and blew it out through pursed lips, looking her over carefully. He was a good bit the worse for wear, but it hadn\u2019t impaired his assurance.</p><p>\u201cOh, indeed I do.\u201d He seemed amused, and she wanted to cross the room and slap him, hard. Instead, she took a deep breath. That was a mistake\u2014she could smell him.</p> <p>Without warning, her gorge rose suddenly and violently. She hadn\u2019t been sick before, but the stench of him brought up everything in her. She had barely time to turn away before the flood of bile and half-digested food came hurtling up, splattering the damp brick floor.</p><p>She leaned her forehead against the wall, waves of hot and cold running over her. Finally, she wiped her mouth and turned around.</p><p>He was still sitting there, watching her. She\u2019d set the lantern on the floor. It threw a yellow flicker upward, carving his face from the shadows behind him. He might have a been a beast, chained in its den; only wariness showed in the pale green eyes.</p><p>\u201cMy name is Brianna Fraser.\u201d</p><p>He nodded, repeating it.</p><p>\u201cBrianna Fraser. A lovely name, sure.\u201d He smiled briefly, lips together. \u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy parents are James and Claire Fraser. They saved your life, and you robbed them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p> <p>He said it with complete matter-of-factness, and she stared at him. He stared back.</p><p>She felt a wild urge to laugh, as unexpected as the surge of nausea had been. What had she expected? Remorse? Excuses? From a man who took things because he wanted them?</p><p>\u201cIf ye\u2019ve come in the hopes of getting back the jewels, I\u2019m afraid you\u2019ve left it too late,\u201d he said pleasantly. \u201cI sold the first to buy a ship, and the other two were stolen from me. Perhaps you\u2019ll find that justice; I should think it cold comfort, myself.\u201d</p><p>She swallowed, tasting bile.</p><p>\u201cStolen. When?\u201d</p><p>Don\u2019t trouble yourself over the man who\u2019s got it, Roger had said. It\u2019s odds-on he stole it from someone else.</p><p>Bonnet shifted on the wooden bench and shrugged.</p><p>\u201cSome four months gone. Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo reason.\u201d So Roger had made it; had got them\u2014the gems that might have been safe transport for them both. Cold comfort.</p><p>\u201cI recall there was a trinket, too\u2014a ring, was it? But you got that back.\u201d He smiled, showing his teeth this time.</p><p>\u201cI paid for it.\u201d One hand went unthinking to her belly, gone round and tight as a basketball under her cloak.</p><p>His gaze stayed on her face, mildly curious.</p><p>\u201cHave we business still to do then, darlin\u2019?\u201d</p><p>She took a deep breath\u2014through her mouth, this time.</p><p>\u201cThey told me you\u2019re going to hang.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey told me the same thing.\u201d He shifted again on the hard wooden bench. He stretched his head to one side, to ease the muscles of his neck, and peered up sidelong at her. \u201cYou\u2019ll not have come from pity, though, I shouldn\u2019t think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said, watching him thoughtfully. \u201cTo be honest, I\u2019ll rest a lot easier once you\u2019re dead.\u201d</p><p>He stared at her for a moment, then burst out laughing. He laughed hard enough that tears came to his eyes; he wiped them carelessly, bending his head to swipe his face against a shrugged shoulder, then straightened up, the marks of his laughter still on his face.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it you want from me, then?\u201d</p><p>She opened her mouth to reply, and quite suddenly, the link between them dissolved. She had not moved, but felt as though she had taken one step across an impassable abyss. She stood now safe on the other side, alone. Blessedly alone. He could no longer touch her.</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d she said, her voice clear in her own ears. \u201cI don\u2019t want anything at all from you. I came to give you something.\u201d</p><p>She opened her cloak, and ran her hands over the swell of her abdomen. The small inhabitant stretched and rolled, its touch a blind caress of hand and womb, both intimate and abstract.</p><p>\u201cYours,\u201d she said.</p><p>He looked at the bulge, and then at her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve had whores try to foist their spawn on me before,\u201d he said. But he spoke without viciousness, and she thought there was a new stillness behind the wary eyes.</p><p>\u201cDo you think I\u2019m a whore?\u201d She didn\u2019t care if he did or not, though she doubted he did. \u201cI\u2019ve no reason to lie. I already told you, I don\u2019t want anything from you.\u201d</p><p>She drew the cloak back together, covering herself. She drew herself up then, feeling the ache in her back ease with the movement. It was done. She was ready to go.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to die,\u201d she said to him, and she who had not come for pity\u2019s sake was surprised to find she had some. \u201cIf it makes the dying easier for you, to know there\u2019s something of you left on earth\u2014then you\u2019re welcome to the knowledge. But I\u2019ve finished with you, now.\u201d</p><p>She turned to pick up the lantern, and was surprised to see the door half cracked ajar. She had no time to feel anger at Lord John for eavesdropping, when the door swung fully open.</p><p>\u201cWell, \u2019twas a gracious speech, ma\u2019am,\u201d Sergeant Murchison said judiciously. He smiled broadly then, and brought the butt of his musket up even with her belly. \u201cBut I can\u2019t say I\u2019ve finished, quite, with you.\u201d</p><p>She took a quick step back, and swung the lantern at his head in a reflex of defense. He ducked with a yelp of alarm, and a grip of iron seized her wrist before she could dash the lamp at him again.</p><p>\u201cChrist, that was close! You\u2019re fast, girl, if not quite so fast as the good Sergeant.\u201d Bonnet took the lantern from her and released her wrist.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not chained after all,\u201d she said stupidly, staring at him. Then her wits caught up with the situation, and she whirled, plunging for the door. Murchison shoved his musket in front of her, blocking her way, but not before she had seen the darkened corridor through the doorway\u2014and the dim form sprawled facedown on the bricks outside.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve killed him,\u201d she whispered. Her lips were numb with shock, and a dread deeper than nausea sickened her to the bone. \u201cOh, God, you\u2019ve killed him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKilled who?\u201d Bonnet held the lantern up, peering at the spill of butter-yellow hair, blotched with blood. \u201cWho the hell is that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA busybody,\u201d Murchison snapped. \u201cHurry, man! There\u2019s no time to waste. I\u2019ve taken care of Hodgepile and the fuses are lit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait!\u201d Bonnet glanced from the Sergeant to Brianna, frowning.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no time, I said.\u201d The Sergeant brought up his gun and checked the priming. \u201cDon\u2019t worry; no one will find them.\u201d</p><p>Brianna could smell the brimstone scent of the gunpowder in the priming pan. The Sergeant swung the stock of the gun to his shoulder, and turned toward her, but the quarters were too cramped; with her belly in the way, there was no room to raise the long muzzle.</p><p>The Sergeant grunted with irritation, reversed the gun, and raised it high, to club her with the butt.</p><p>Her hand was clenched around the barrel before she knew she had reached for it. Everything seemed to be moving very slowly, Murchison and Bonnet both standing frozen. She herself felt quite detached, as though she stood to one side, watching.</p><p>She plucked the musket from Murchison\u2019s grip as though it were a broomstraw, swung it high, and smashed it down. The jolt of it vibrated up her arms, into her body, her whole body charged as though someone had thrown a switch and sent a white-hot current pulsing through her.</p><p>She saw so clearly the man\u2019s face hanging drop-jawed in the air before her, eyes passing from astonishment through horror to the dullness of unconsciousness, so slowly that she saw the change. Had time to see the vivid colors in his face. A plum lip caught on a yellow tooth, half lifted in a sneer. Slow tiny blossoms of brilliant red unfolding in a graceful curve across his temple, Japanese water flowers blooming on a field of fresh-bruised blue.</p><p>She was entirely calm, no more than a conduit for the ancient savagery that men call motherhood, who mistake its tenderness for weakness. She saw her own hands, knuckles stark and tendons etched, felt the surge of power up her legs and back, through wrists and arms and shoulders, swung again, so slowly, it seemed so slowly, and yet the man was still falling, had not quite reached the floor when the gun butt struck again.</p><p>A voice was calling her name. Dimly, it penetrated through the crystal hum around her.</p><p>\u201cStop, for God\u2019s sake! Woman\u2014Brianna\u2014stop!\u201d</p><p>There were hands on her shoulders, dragging, shaking. She pulled free of the grip and turned, the gun still in hand.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t touch me,\u201d she said, and he took a quick step back, his eyes filled with surprise and wariness\u2014perhaps a touch of fear. Afraid of her? Why would anyone be afraid of her? she thought dimly. He was talking; she saw his mouth moving, but she couldn\u2019t catch the words, it was just noise. The current in her was dying, making her dizzy.</p><p>Then time readjusted itself, began to move normally again. Her muscles quivered, all their fibers turned to jelly. She set the stained butt of the gun against the floor to balance herself.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you say?\u201d</p><p>Impatience flickered across his face.</p><p>\u201cI said, it\u2019s no time we have to be wasting! Did ye not hear your man sayin\u2019 that the fuses are lit?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat fuses? Why?\u201d She saw his eyes flick toward the door behind her. Before he could move, she stepped back into the doorway, bringing up the muzzle of the gun. He backed away from her instinctively, hitting the bench with the backs of his legs. He fell back, and struck the chains fastened to the wall; empty manacles chimed against the brick.</p><p>Shock was beginning to steal over her, but the memory of the white-hot current still burned through her spine, keeping her upright.</p><p>\u201cYou do not mean to kill me, surely?\u201d He tried to smile, and failed; couldn\u2019t keep the panic from his eyes. She had said she would rest easier with him dead.</p><p>Freedom is hard-won, but is not the fruit of Murder. She had her hard-won freedom now, and would not give it back to him.</p> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said, and took a firmer hold on the gun, the butt snugged solid into her shoulder. \u201cBut I will by God shoot you through the knees and leave you here, if you don\u2019t tell me right this minute what the hell is going on!\u201d</p><p>He shifted his weight, big body hovering, pale eyes on her, judging. She blocked the door entirely, her bulk filling it from side to side. She saw the doubt in his posture, the shift of his shoulders as he thought to rush her, and cocked the gun with a single loud click!</p><p>He stood six feet from the muzzle\u2019s end; too far to lunge and grab it from her. One move, one pull of her trigger finger. She couldn\u2019t miss, and he knew it.</p><p>His shoulders slumped.</p><p>\u201cThe warehouse above is laid with gunpowder and fuses,\u201d he said, speaking quick and sharp, anxious to get it done. \u201cI can\u2019t say how long, but it\u2019s goin\u2019 up with an almighty bang. For God\u2019s sake, let me out of here!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Her hands were sweating, but solid on the gun. The baby stirred, a reminder that she had no time to waste, either. She would risk one minute to know, though. She had to know, with John Grey\u2019s body limp on the floor behind her. \u201cYou\u2019ve killed a good man here, and I want to know why!\u201d</p><p>He made a gesture of frustration.</p><p>\u201cThe smuggling!\u201d he said. \u201cWe were partners, the Sergeant and I. I\u2019d bring him in cheap contraband, he\u2019d stamp it with the Crown\u2019s mark. He\u2019d steal the licensed stuff, I\u2019d sell it for a good price and split with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKeep talking.\u201d</p><p>He was nearly dancing with impatience.</p><p>\u201cA soldier\u2014Hodgepile\u2014he was on to it, asking questions. Murchison couldn\u2019t say if he\u2019d told anyone, but it wasn\u2019t wise to wait and see, not once I was taken. The Sergeant moved the last of the liquor from the warehouse, substituted barrels of turpentine, and laid the fuses. It all goes up, no one can say it wasn\u2019t brandy burning\u2014no evidence of theft. That\u2019s it, that\u2019s all. Now let me go!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAll right.\u201d She lowered the musket a few inches, but didn\u2019t yet uncock it. \u201cWhat about him?\u201d She nodded toward the fallen Sergeant, who was beginning to snort and mumble.</p><p>He stared at her blankly.</p><p>\u201cWhat about him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you going to take him with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He sidled to one side, looking for a way past her. \u201cFor Christ\u2019s sweet sake, woman, let me go, and leave yourself! There\u2019s twelve hundred-weight of pitch and turpentine overhead. It\u2019ll go off like a bomb!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut he\u2019s still alive! We can\u2019t leave him here!\u201d</p><p>Bonnet gave her a look of sheer exasperation, then crossed the room in two strides. He bent, jerked the dagger from the Sergeant\u2019s belt, and drew it hard across the fat throat, just above the leather stock. A thick spray of blood soaked Bonnet\u2019s shirt, and whipped against the wall.</p><p>\u201cThere,\u201d he said, straightening up. \u201cHe\u2019s not alive. Leave him.\u201d</p> <p>He dropped the dagger, pushed her aside, and lunged out into the corridor. She could hear his footsteps going away, quick and ringing on the brick.</p><p>Trembling all over with the shock of action and reaction, she stood still for a second, staring down at John Grey\u2019s body. Grief ripped through her, and her womb clenched hard. There was no pain, but every fiber had contracted; her stomach bulged as though she\u2019d swallowed a basketball. She felt breathless, unable to move.</p><p>No, she thought quite clearly, to the child inside. I am not in labor, I absolutely, positively am not. I won\u2019t have it. Stay put. I haven\u2019t got time right now.</p><p>She took two steps down the black corridor, then stopped. No, she had to check, at least, make sure. She turned back, and knelt by John Grey\u2019s body. He had looked dead when she first saw him lying there, and still did; he hadn\u2019t moved or even twitched since she had first seen his body.</p><p>She leaned forward but couldn\u2019t reach easily over the bulge of her belly. She grasped his arm instead, and pulled at him, trying to turn him over. A small, fine-boned man, he was still heavy. His body tilted up, rolled boneless toward her, head lolling, and her heart sank anew, seeing his half-closed eyes and slack mouth. But she reached beneath the angle of his jaw, feeling frantically for a pulse point.</p><p>Where the hell was it? She\u2019d seen her mother do it in emergencies; faster to find than a wrist pulse, she\u2019d said. She couldn\u2019t find one. How long had it been, how long were the fuses set to burn?</p><p>She wiped a fold of her cloak across her clammy face, trying to think. She looked back, judging the distance to the stairs. Jesus, could she risk it, even alone? The thought of popping out into the warehouse above, just as everything went off\u2014She cast one look upward, then bent to her work and tried again, pushing his head far back. There! She could see the damn vein under his skin\u2014that\u2019s where the pulse should be, shouldn\u2019t it?</p><p>For a moment, she wasn\u2019t sure she felt it; it might be only the hammering of her own heart, beating in her fingertips. But no, it was\u2014a different rhythm, faint and fluttering. He might be close to dead, but not quite.</p><p>\u201cClose,\u201d she muttered, \u201cbut no cigar.\u201d She felt too frightened to be greatly relieved; now she\u2019d have to get him out, too. She scrambled to her feet, and reached down to get hold of his arms, to drag him. But then she stopped, a memory of what she had seen a moment before penetrating her panic.</p><p>She turned and lumbered hastily back into the cell. Averting her eyes from the sodden red mound on the floor, she snatched up the lantern and brought it back to the corridor. She held it high, casting light on the low brick ceiling. Yes, she\u2019d been right!</p><p>The bricks curved up from the floor in groynes, making arches all along both sides of the corridors. Storage alcoves and cells. Above the groynes, though, ran sturdy beams made of eight-inch pine. Over that, thick planking\u2014and above the planks, the layer of bricks that formed the floor of the warehouse.</p><p>Going up like a bomb, Bonnet had said\u2014but was he right? Turpentine burned, so did pitch; yes, they\u2019d likely explode if they burned under pressure, but not like a bomb, no. Fuses. Fuses, in the plural. Long fuses, plainly, and likely running to small caches of gunpowder; that was the only true explosive Murchison would have; there were no high explosives now.</p><p>So the gunpowder would explode in several places, and ignite the barrels nearby. But the barrels would burn slowly; she\u2019d seen Sinclair make barrels like those; the staves were half an inch thick, watertight. She remembered the reek as they walked through the warehouse; yes, Murchison would likely have opened the bungs of a few barrels, let the turpentine flow out, to help the fire along.</p><p>So the barrels would burn, but likely they wouldn\u2019t explode\u2014or if they did, not all at once. Her breathing eased a little, making calculations. Not a bomb; a string of firecrackers, maybe.</p><p>So. She took a deep breath\u2014as deep a breath as she could manage, with Osbert in the way. She put her hands across her stomach, feeling her racing heart begin to slow.</p><p>Even if some of the barrels did explode, the force of the explosion would be out, and up, through the thin plank walls and the roof. Very little force would be deflected down. And what was\u2014she reached up a hand and pushed against a beam, reassuring herself of its strength.</p><p>She sat down quite suddenly on the floor, skirts puffed out around her.</p><p>\u201cI think it\u2019ll be all right,\u201d she whispered, not sure if she was talking to John, to the baby, or to herself.</p><p>She sat huddled for a moment, shaking with relief, then rolled awkwardly onto her knees again, and began with fumbling fingers to administer first aid.</p><p>She was still struggling to tear a strip from the hem of her petticoat when she heard the footsteps. Coming fast, almost running. She turned sharply toward the stairs, but no\u2014the footsteps came from the other way, behind her.</p><p>She whirled around, to see the form of Stephen Bonnet looming out of the darkness.</p><p>\u201cRun!\u201d he shouted at her. \u201cFor Christ\u2019s sweet sake, why have ye not gone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause it\u2019s safe here,\u201d she said. She had laid the musket down on the floor beside Grey\u2019s body; she stooped and picked it up, lifted it to her shoulder. \u201cGo away.\u201d</p><p>He stared at her, mouth half open in the gloom.</p><p>\u201cSafe? Woman, you\u2019re an eedjit! Did ye not hear\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI heard, but you\u2019re wrong. It\u2019s not going to explode. And if it did, it would still be safe down here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe hell it is! Sweet bleeding Jesus! Even if the cellar doesn\u2019t go, what happens when the fire burns through the floor?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt can\u2019t, it\u2019s brick.\u201d She jerked her chin upward, not taking her eyes off him.</p><p>\u201cBack here it is\u2014up front, by the river, it\u2019s wood, like the wharf. It\u2019ll burn through, then collapse. And what happens back here then, eh? Do ye no good for the ceiling to hold, when the smoke comes rolling back to smother ye!\u201d</p><p>She felt a wave of sickness roil up from her depths.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s open? The cellar isn\u2019t sealed? The other end of the corridor\u2019s open?\u201d Knowing even as she spoke that of course it was\u2014he had run that way, heading for the river, not for the stairs.</p><p>\u201cYes! Now come!\u201d He lunged forward, reaching for her arm, but she jerked away, back against the wall, the muzzle of the gun trained on him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going without him.\u201d She licked dry lips, nodding at the floor.</p><p>\u201cThe man\u2019s dead!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not! Pick him up!\u201d</p><p>An extraordinary mixture of emotions crossed Bonnet\u2019s face; fury and astonishment preeminent among them.</p><p>\u201cPick him up!\u201d she repeated fiercely. He stood still, staring at her. Then, very slowly, he squatted, and gathering John Grey\u2019s limp form into his arms, got the point of his shoulder into Grey\u2019s abdomen and heaved him up.</p><p>\u201cCome on, then,\u201d he said, and without another glance at her started off into the dark. She hesitated for a second, then seized the lantern and followed him.</p><p>Within fifty feet, she smelled smoke. The brick corridor wasn\u2019t straight; it branched and turned, encompassing the many partitions of the cellar. But all the time it slanted down, heading toward the riverbank. As they descended through the multiple turnings, the scent of smoke thickened; a layer of acrid haze swirled lazily around them, visible in the lantern light. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Brianna held her breath, trying not to breathe. Bonnet was moving fast, despite Grey\u2019s weight. She could barely keep up, burdened with gun and lantern, but she didn\u2019t mean to give up either one, just yet. Her belly tightened again, another of those breathless moments.</p><p>\u201cNot yet, I said!\u201d she muttered through gritted teeth.</p><p>She had had to stop for a moment; Bonnet had disappeared into the haze ahead. Evidently he\u2019d noticed the fading of the lantern light, though\u2014she heard him bellow, from somewhere up ahead.</p><p>\u201cWoman! Brianna!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m coming!\u201d she called, and hurried as fast as she could, waddling, discarding any pretense of grace. The smoke was much thicker, and she could hear a faint crackle, somewhere in the distance\u2014overhead? Before them?</p><p>She was breathing heavily, in spite of the smoke. She drew in a ragged gulp of air, and smelled water. Damp and mud, dead leaves and fresh air, slicing through the smoky murk like a knife.</p><p>A faint glow shone through the smoke and grew as they hurried toward it, dwarfing the light of her lantern. Then a dark square loomed ahead. Bonnet turned and seized her arm, dragging her out into the air.</p><p>They were under the wharf, she realized; dark water lapped ahead of them, brightness dancing on it. Reflection; the brightness came from up above, and so did the crackle of flame. Bonnet didn\u2019t stop or let go of her arm; he pulled her to one side, into the long, dank grass and mud of the bank. He let go within a few steps, but she followed, gasping for breath, slipping and sliding, tripping on the soggy edges of her skirts.</p><p>At last he stopped, in the shadow of the trees. He bent, and let Grey\u2019s body slide to the ground. He stayed bent for a moment, chest heaving, trying to get his breath back.</p> <p>Brianna realized that she could see both men plainly; could see every bud on the twigs of the tree. She turned and looked back, to see the warehouse lighted like a jack-o\u2019-lantern, flames licking through cracks in the wooden walls. The huge double doors had been left ajar; as she watched, the blast of hot air forced one open, and small tongues of fire began to creep across the dock, deceptively small and playful-looking.</p><p>She felt a hand on her shoulder, and whirled, looking up into Bonnet\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve a ship waiting,\u201d he said. \u201cA little way upriver. Will you come with me, then?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. She still held the gun, but didn\u2019t need it now. He was no threat to her.</p><p>Still he didn\u2019t go, but lingered, staring down at her, a small frown between his brows. His face was gaunt, hollowed and shadowed by the distant fire. The surface of the river was aflame now, small tongues of fire flickering from the dark water as a slick of turpentine spread across it.</p><p>\u201cIs it true?\u201d he asked abruptly. He asked no permission, but set his hands on her belly. It tightened at his touch, rounding in another of those breathless, painless squeezes, and a look of astonishment crossed his face.</p> <p>She jerked away from his touch, pulling her cloak together, and nodded, unable to speak.</p><p>He seized her chin in his hand and peered into her face\u2014assessing her truthfulness, perhaps? Then he let go, and stuck a finger into his mouth, groping in the recesses of his cheek.</p><p>He took her hand, and put something wet and hard in her palm.</p><p>\u201cFor his maintenance, then,\u201d he said, and grinned at her. \u201cTake care of him, sweetheart!\u201d</p><p>And then he was gone, bounding long-legged up the riverbank, silhouetted like a demon in the flickering light. The turpentine flowing into the water had caught fire, and roiling billows of scarlet light shot upward, floating pillars of fire that lit the riverbank bright as day.</p><p>She half raised the musket, finger on the trigger. He was no more than twenty yards away, a perfect shot. Not by your hand. She lowered the gun, and let him go.</p><p>The warehouse was fully ablaze by now; the heat from it beat against her cheeks and blew the hair back from her face.</p><p>\u201cI have a ship upriver,\u201d he\u2019d said. She squinted into the glare. The fire had nearly filled the river, a great floating slick that bloomed from bank to bank in a fiery garden of unfolding flames. Nothing could come through that blinding wall of light.</p> <p>Her other fist was still closed around the object he had given her. She opened her hand and looked down at the wet black diamond that gleamed in her palm, the fire glowing red and bloody in its facets.</p><p>PART TWELVE</p><p>Je T\u2019Aime</p><p>63</p><p>FORGIVENESS</p><p>River Run, May 1770</p><p>That is the most stubborn woman I have ever met!\u201d Brianna huffed into the room like a ship in full sail, and subsided onto the love seat by the bed, billowing.</p><p>Lord John Grey opened one eye, bloodshot under his turban of bandages.</p><p>\u201cYour aunt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have a looking glass in your room, do you not?\u201d His mouth curved, and after a reluctant moment, so did hers.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s her bloody will. I told her I don\u2019t want River Run, I can\u2019t own slaves\u2014but she won\u2019t change it! She just smiles as though I were a six-year-old having a tantrum and says by the time it happens, I\u2019ll be glad of it. Glad of it!\u201d She snorted and flounced into a more comfortable position. \u201cWhat am I going to do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing?\u201d She turned the force of her displeasure on him. \u201cHow can I do nothing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo begin with, I should be extremely surprised if your aunt were not immortal, several of that particular race of Scots seem to be. However\u201d\u2014he waved a hand in dismissal\u2014\u201cshould this prove untrue, and should she persist in her delusions that you would prove a good mistress to River Run\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat makes you think I wouldn\u2019t?\u201d she said, pride stung.</p><p>\u201cYou cannot run a plantation of this size without slaves, and you decline to own them for reasons of conscience, or so I was given to understand. Though a less likely Quaker I have never seen.\u201d He narrowed his open eye, indicating the immense tent of purple-striped muslin in which she was swathed. \u201cReturning to the point at issue\u2014or one of them\u2014should you find yourself the unwilling recipient of a number of slaves, arrangements can undoubtedly be made to free them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot in North Carolina. The Assembly\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, not in North Carolina,\u201d he agreed patiently. \u201cIf the occasion should arise, and you find yourself in possession of slaves, you will simply sell them to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut that\u2019s\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I will take them to Virginia, where manumission is much less stringently controlled. Once they are freed, you will return my money. At this point, you will be totally destitute and lacking in property, which appears to be your chief desire, second only to preventing any possibility of personal happiness by ensuring that you cannot marry the man you love.\u201d</p><p>She pleated a handful of muslin between her fingers, frowning at the big sapphire that shone on her hand.</p><p>\u201cI promised I\u2019d listen to him first.\u201d She cast a narrow eye at Lord John. \u201cThough I still say it\u2019s emotional blackmail.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo much more effective than any other kind,\u201d he agreed. \u201cAlmost worth a cracked pate, to finally hold the whip hand on a Fraser.\u201d</p><p>She ignored this.</p><p>\u201cAnd I only said I\u2019d listen. I still think when he knows everything, he\u2019ll\u2014he can\u2019t.\u201d She put a hand on her enormous belly. \u201cYou couldn\u2019t, could you? Care\u2014really care, I mean\u2014for a child that wasn\u2019t yours?\u201d</p><p>He moved higher on the pillow, grimacing slightly.</p><p>\u201cFor the sake of its parent? I expect I could.\u201d He opened both eyes and looked at her, smiling. \u201cIndeed, I was under the impression that I had been doing so for some time.\u201d</p><p>She looked momentarily blank, before a tide of pink flowed up from the scooped neck of her bodice. She was charming when she blushed.</p><p>\u201cYou mean me? Well, yes, but\u2014I mean\u2014I\u2019m not a baby, and you\u2019re not having to claim me as your own.\u201d She gave him a direct blue look, at odds with the lingering pinkness of her cheeks. \u201cAnd I did hope it wasn\u2019t all for my father\u2019s sake.\u201d</p><p>He was quiet for a moment, then reached out and squeezed her hand.</p><p>\u201cNo, it wasn\u2019t,\u201d he said gruffly. He let go, and lay back with a small groan.</p><p>\u201cAre you feeling worse?\u201d she asked anxiously. \u201cShall I get you something? Some tea? A poultice?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s only the blasted headache,\u201d he said. \u201cThe light makes it throb.\u201d He shut his eyes again.</p><p>\u201cTell me,\u201d he said without opening them, \u201cwhy is it that you seem so convinced that a man could not care for a child unless it were the fruit of his loins? As it is, my dear, I did not mean to refer to you when I said I had been doing such a thing myself. My son\u2014my stepson\u2014is in fact the son of my late wife\u2019s sister. By tragic accident, both of his parents died within a day of each other, and my wife Isobel and her parents raised him from babyhood. I married Isobel when Willie was six or so. So you see, there is no blood between us at all\u2014and yet were any man to impugn my affection for him, or to say he is not my son, I would call him out on the instant for it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see,\u201d she said, after a moment. \u201cI didn\u2019t know that.\u201d He cracked an eyelid; she was still twisting her ring, looking pensive.</p><p>\u201cI think...\u201d she began, and glanced at him. \u201cI think I\u2019m not so worried about Roger and the baby. If I\u2019m honest\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHeaven forfend you should be otherwise,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>\u201cIf I\u2019m honest,\u201d she went on, glowering at him, \u201cI think I\u2019m worried more about how it would be between us\u2014between Roger and me.\u201d She hesitated, then took the plunge.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know Jamie Fraser was my father,\u201d she said. \u201cNot all the time I was growing up. After the Rising, my parents were separated; they each thought the other was dead. And so my mother married again. I thought Frank Randall was my father. I didn\u2019t find out otherwise until after he died.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d He viewed her with increased interest. \u201cAnd was this Randall cruel to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo! He was...wonderful.\u201d Her voice broke slightly, and she cleared her throat, embarrassed. \u201cNo. He was the best father I could have had. It\u2019s just that I thought my parents had a good marriage. They cared for each other, they respected each other, they\u2014well, I thought everything was fine.\u201d</p><p>Lord John scratched at his bandages. The doctor had shaved his head, a condition which, in addition to affronting his vanity, itched abominably.</p><p>\u201cI fail to see the difficulty, as applied to your present situation.\u201d</p><p>She heaved a huge sigh.</p><p>\u201cThen my father died, and...we found out that Jamie Fraser was still alive. My mother went to join him, and then I came. And\u2014it was different. I saw how they looked at each other. I never saw her look at Frank Randall that way\u2014or him at her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, yes.\u201d A small gust of bleakness swept through him. He\u2019d seen that look once or twice; the first time, he had wanted desperately to put a knife through Claire Randall\u2019s heart. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDo you know how rare such a thing is?\u201d he asked quietly. \u201cThat peculiar sort of mutual passion?\u201d The one-sided kind was common enough.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d She had half turned, her arm along the back of the love seat, and was looking out through the French doors, over the burgeoning spread of the spring flower beds below.</p><p>\u201cThe thing is\u2014I think I had it,\u201d she said, even more quietly. \u201cFor a little while. A very little while.\u201d She turned her head and looked at him, with eyes that let him see clear through her.</p><p>\u201cIf I\u2019ve lost it\u2014then I have.

I couldn\u2019t stand that.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt looks like you may get me by default.\u201d Brianna put the breakfast tray over his lap and collapsed heavily into the love seat, making the joints groan.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t riddle with a sick man,\u201d he said, picking up a piece of toast. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDrusus just came racing into the cookhouse, saying he saw two riders coming down through Campbell\u2019s fields. He said he was sure one of them was my father\u2014he said it was a big man with red hair; God knows there aren\u2019t that many like him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot many, no.\u201d He smiled briefly, his eyes traveling over her. \u201cSo, two riders?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt must be Da and my mother. So they haven\u2019t found Roger. Or they did, and he\u2014didn\u2019t want to come back.\u201d She twisted the big sapphire on her finger. \u201cGood thing I have a fallback, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p> <p>Lord John blinked, and made haste to swallow his mouthful of toast.</p><p>\u201cIf by that extraordinary metaphor, you mean that you intend to marry me after all, I assure you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She gave him a halfhearted smile. \u201cJust teasing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, good.\u201d He took a gulp of tea, closing his eyes to enjoy the fragrant steam. \u201cTwo riders. Did your cousin not go with them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, he did,\u201d she said slowly. \u201cGod, I hope nothing\u2019s happened to Ian.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt might be that they experienced any variety of disasters on the journey, which obliged your cousin and your mother to travel behind your father and Mr. MacKenzie. Or your cousin and MacKenzie behind your parents.\u201d He waved a hand, indicating innumerable possibilities.</p> <p>\u201cI guess you\u2019re right.\u201d She still looked peaked, and Lord John suspected she had cause. Comforting possibilities were all very well for the short term, but the colder probabilities were inclined to triumph over the longer course\u2014and whoever accompanied Jamie Fraser, they would be arriving shortly, with the answers to all questions.</p><p>He pushed back the unfinished breakfast and leaned back against his pillows.</p><p>\u201cTell me\u2014how far does your remorse extend for having nearly gotten me killed?\u201d</p><p>She colored and looked uncomfortable.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I ask you to do something you do not wish to, will your sense of guilt and obligation compel you to do it nonetheless?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, more blackmail. What is it?\u201d she asked warily.</p><p>\u201cForgive your father. Whatever has happened.\u201d</p> <p>Pregnancy had made her complexion more delicate; all her emotions ebbed and flowed just under the surface of that apricot skin. A touch would bruise her.</p><p>He reached out and laid a hand very gently along her cheek.</p><p>\u201cFor your sake, as well as his,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI already have.\u201d Her lashes covered her eyes as she looked down; her hands lay still in her lap, the blue fire of his sapphire glowing on her finger.</p><p>The sound of hooves came clearly through the open French doors, rattling on the gravel drive.</p><p>\u201cThen I think you had better go down and tell him so, my dear.\u201d</p><p>She pursed her lips, and nodded. Without a word, she stood up and floated out the door, disappearing like a storm cloud over the horizon.</p><p>\u201cWhen we heard that there were two riders coming, and one of them Jamie, we feared lest something had happened to your nephew, or MacKenzie. Somehow, it occurred to neither of us to think that anything had happened to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m immortal,\u201d she murmured, peering alternately into his eyes. \u201cDidn\u2019t you know?\u201d The pressure of her thumbs lifted from his eyelids and he blinked, still feeling her touch.</p><p>\u201cYou have a slight enlargement of one pupil, but very small. Grip my fingers and squeeze as hard as you can.\u201d She held out her index fingers and he obliged, annoyed to feel the weakness of his grip.</p><p>\u201cDid you find MacKenzie?\u201d He was further annoyed not to be able to control his curiosity.</p><p>She gave him a quick, wary glance from those sherry-colored eyes, and returned her gaze to his hands.</p><p>\u201cYes. He\u2019ll be coming along. A little later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill he?\u201d She caught the tone of his question and hesitated, then looked at him directly.</p><p>\u201cHow much do you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverything,\u201d he said, and had the momentary satisfaction of seeing her startled. Then one side of her mouth curved up.</p><p>\u201cEverything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEnough,\u201d he amended sardonically. \u201cEnough to ask whether your statement of Mr. MacKenzie\u2019s return is knowledge on your part or wishful thinking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCall it faith.\u201d Without so much as a by-your-leave, she tugged loose the strings of his nightshirt and spread it open, exposing his chest. Rolling a sheet of parchment deftly into a tube, she applied one end of it to his breast, putting her ear to the other end.</p><p>\u201cI beg your pardon, madame!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHush, I can\u2019t hear,\u201d she said, making small shushing motions with one hand. She proceeded to move her tube to different parts of his chest, pausing now and then to thump experimentally or prod him in the liver.</p><p>\u201cHave you moved your bowels yet today?\u201d she inquired, poking him familiarly in the abdomen.</p><p>\u201cI decline to say,\u201d he said, pulling his nightshirt back together with dignity.</p><p>She looked more outrageous even than usual. The woman must be forty at least, yet she showed no more sign of age than a fine webbing of lines at the corners of her eyes, and threadings of silver in that ridiculous mass of hair.</p><p>She was thinner than he remembered, though it was hard to judge of her figure, dressed as she was in a barbaric leather shirt and trouserings. She\u2019d plainly been in the sun and weather for some time; her face and hands had baked a delicate soft brown, that made the big golden eyes that much more startling when they turned full on one\u2014which they now did.</p><p>\u201cBrianna says that Dr. Fentiman trephined your skull.\u201d</p><p>He shifted uncomfortably under the sheets.</p><p>\u201cI am told that he did. I am afraid I was not aware of it at the time.\u201d</p><p>Her mouth quirked slightly.</p><p>\u201cJust as well. Would you mind if I look at it? It\u2019s only curiosity,\u201d she went on, with unaccustomed delicacy. \u201cNot medical necessity. It\u2019s only that I\u2019ve never seen a trepanation.\u201d</p><p>He closed his eyes, giving up.</p><p>\u201cBeyond the state of my bowels, I have no secrets from you, madame.\u201d</p><p>He tilted his head, indicating the location of the hole in his head, and felt her cool fingers slide under the bandage, lifting the gauze and allowing a breath of air to soothe his hot head.</p><p>\u201cBrianna is with her father?\u201d he asked, eyes still closed.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Her voice was softer. \u201cShe told me\u2014us\u2014a little of what you\u2019d done for her. Thank you.\u201d</p><p>The fingers left his skin and he opened his eyes.</p><p>\u201cIt was my pleasure to be of service to her. Perforated skull and all.\u201d</p><p>She smiled faintly.</p><p>\u201cJamie will be up to see you in a bit. He\u2019s...talking to Brianna in the garden.\u201d</p><p>He felt a small stab of anxiety.</p><p>\u201cAre they\u2014in accord?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee for yourself.\u201d She put an arm behind him, and with amazing strength for a woman with such fine bones, levered him upright. Just beyond the balustrade he could see the two figures at the bottom of the garden, heads close together. As he watched, they embraced, then broke apart, laughing at the awkwardness caused by Brianna\u2019s shape.</p><p>\u201cI think we got here just in time,\u201d Claire murmured, looking at her daughter with a practiced eye. \u201cIt isn\u2019t going to be much longer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI confess to some gratitude at your prompt arrival,\u201d he said, letting her ease him back onto the pillows and smooth his bedding. \u201cI have barely survived the experience of being your daughter\u2019s nursemaid; I fear serving as her midwife would finish me completely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I nearly forgot.\u201d Claire reached into a nasty-looking leather pouch around her neck. \u201cBrianna said to give this back to you\u2014she won\u2019t need it anymore.\u201d</p><p>He held out his hand, and a tiny spark of brilliant blue fell into his palm.</p><p>\u201cJilted, by God!\u201d he said, and grinned.</p><p>64</p><p>BOTTOM OF THE NINTH</p><p>It\u2019s like baseball,\u201d I assured her. \u201cLong stretches of boredom, punctuated by short periods of intense activity.\u201d</p><p>She laughed, then stopped abruptly, grimacing.</p><p>\u201cUgh. Intense, yeah. Whew.\u201d She smiled, a little lopsidedly. \u201cAt least at baseball games you get to drink beer and eat hot dogs in the boring parts.\u201d</p><p>Jamie, grasping at the only part of this conversation that made sense, leaned forward.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a crock of small beer, cool in the pantry,\u201d he said, peering anxiously at Brianna. \u201cWill I fetch it in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I said. \u201cNot unless you want some; alcohol wouldn\u2019t be good for the baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh. What about the hot dog?\u201d He stood up and flexed his hands, obviously preparing to dash out and shoot one.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a sort of sausage in a roll,\u201d I said, rubbing my upper lip in an effort not to laugh. I glanced at Brianna. \u201cI don\u2019t think she wants one.\u201d Small beads of sweat had popped out quite suddenly on her wide brow, and she was looking white around the eye sockets.</p><p>\u201cOh, barf,\u201d she said faintly.</p><p>Correctly interpreting this remark from the look on her face, Jamie hastily applied the damp cloth to her face and neck.</p><p>\u201cPut your head between your knees, lass.\u201d</p><p>She glared at him ferociously.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t get...my head...near my knees!\u201d she said, teeth clenched. Then the spasm relaxed and she took a deep breath, the color coming back into her face.</p><p>Jamie glanced from her to me, frowning worriedly. He took a hesitant step toward the door.</p><p>\u201cI expect I\u2019d best go, then, if you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t leave me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it\u2019s\u2014I mean, you\u2019ve your mother, and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t leave me!\u201d she repeated. Agitated, she leaned over and grabbed his arm, shaking it for emphasis. \u201cYou can\u2019t!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said I wouldn\u2019t die.\u201d She was staring intently into his face. \u201cIf you stay, it will be all right. I won\u2019t die.\u201d She spoke with such intensity that I felt a sudden spasm of fear clutch my own innards, hard as the pain of labor.</p><p>She was a big girl, strong and healthy. She should have no great trouble delivering. But I was large enough, healthy as well\u2014and twenty-five years before, I had lost a stillborn child at six months, and nearly died myself. I might be able to protect her from childbed fever, but there was no defense against a sudden hemorrhage; the best I could do under such circumstances would be to try to save her child via Caesarian section. I resolutely kept my eyes off the chest in which the sterile blade lay ready, just in case. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re not going to die, Bree,\u201d I said. I spoke as soothingly as I could, and put a hand on her shoulder, but she must have felt the fear under my professional facade. Her face twisted, and she grabbed my hand, clinging so tightly the bones rubbed together. She closed her eyes and breathed through her nose, but didn\u2019t cry out.</p><p>She opened her eyes and looked straight at me, her pupils dilated so that she seemed to be looking past me, into a future that only she could see.</p><p>\u201cIf I do...\u201d she said, putting a hand to her swollen belly. Her mouth worked, but whatever she\u2019d been meaning to say couldn\u2019t force its way out.</p><p>She struggled to her feet, then, and leaned heavily on Jamie, her face muffled in his shoulder, repeating, \u201cDa, don\u2019t leave me, don\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI willna leave ye, a leannan. Dinna be afraid, I\u2019ll stay wi\u2019 ye.\u201d He put an arm around her, looking helplessly over her head at me.</p><p>\u201cWalk her,\u201d I said to Jamie, seeing her restlessness. \u201cLike a horse with colic,\u201d I added, as he looked blank.</p><p>That made her laugh. With the ginger air of a man approaching an armed bomb, he put an arm around her waist and towed her slowly around the room. Given their respective sizes, it sounded a lot like someone leading a horse, too.</p><p>\u201cAll right?\u201d I heard him ask anxiously, on one circuit.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll tell you when I\u2019m not,\u201d she assured him.</p> <p>It was warm for mid-May; I opened the windows wide, and the scents of phlox and columbine flowed in, mixed with cool, damp air from the river.</p><p>The house was filled with an air of expectation: eagerness, with a hint of fear beneath. Jocasta walked up and down the terrace below, too nervous to stay put. Betty put her head in every few minutes to ask if anything was needed; Phaedre came up from the pantry with a jug of fresh buttermilk, just in case. Brianna, her eyes focused inwardly, merely shook her head at it; I sipped a glass myself, mentally checking off the preparations.</p><p>The fact was that there wasn\u2019t a hell of a lot you needed to do for a normal birth, and not the hell of a lot you could do if it wasn\u2019t. The bed was stripped and old quilts laid to protect the mattress; there was a stack of clean cloths to hand, and a can of hot water, renewed every half hour or so from the kitchen copper. Cool water for sipping and brow-mopping, a small vial of oil for rubbing, my suture kit to hand, just in case\u2014and beyond that, everything was up to Brianna.</p><p>After nearly an hour\u2019s walking, she stopped dead in the middle of the floor, gripping Jamie\u2019s arm and breathing through her nose like a horse at the end of a twenty-furlong race.</p><p>\u201cI want to lie down,\u201d she said.</p><p>Phaedre and I got her gown off, and got her safely onto the bed in her shift. I laid my hands on the huge mound of her belly, marveling at the sheer impossibility of what had happened already, and what was about to happen next.</p> <p>The rigidity of the contraction passed off, and I could clearly feel the curves of the child below the thin rubbery covering of skin and muscle. It was large, I could tell that, but it seemed to be lying well, head down and fully engaged.</p><p>Normally, babies about to be born were fairly quiet, intimidated by the upheaval of their surroundings. This one was stirring; I felt a small, distinct surge against my hand as an elbow poked out.</p><p>\u201cDaddy!\u201d Brianna reached out blindly, flailing as a contraction took her unaware. Jamie lunged forward and caught her hand, squeezing tight.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here, a bheanachd, I\u2019m here.\u201d</p><p>She breathed heavily, face bright red, then relaxed, and swallowed.</p><p>\u201cHow long?\u201d she asked. She was facing me but not looking at me; she wasn\u2019t looking at anything outside.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. Not an awfully long time, I don\u2019t think.\u201d The contractions were roughly five minutes apart, but I knew they could continue like that for a long time, or speed up abruptly; there was simply no telling.</p><p>There was a light breeze from the window, but she was sweating. I wiped her face and neck again, and rubbed her shoulders.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re doing fine, lovey,\u201d I murmured to her. \u201cJust fine.\u201d I glanced up at Jamie, and smiled. \u201cSo are you.\u201d</p><p>He made a game try at returning the smile; he was sweating, too, but his face was white, not red.</p><p>\u201cTalk to me, Da,\u201d she said suddenly.</p><p>\u201cOch?\u201d He looked at me, frantic. \u201cWhat shall I say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d I said. \u201cTell her stories; anything to take her mind off things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Ah...will ye have heard the one about...Habetrot the spinstress?\u201d</p><p>Brianna grunted in reply. Jamie looked apprehensive, but started in nonetheless.</p><p>\u201cAye, well. It happened that in an old farmhouse that stood by the river, there lived a fair maid called Maisie. She\u2019d red hair and blue een, and was the bonniest maid in all the valley. But she had no husband, because...\u201d He stopped, appalled. I glared at him.</p><p>He coughed and went on, plainly not knowing what else to do. \u201cAh...because in those days men were sensible, and instead of looking for lovely lasses to be their brides, they looked out for girls who could cook and spin, who might make notable housewives. But Maisie...\u201d</p><p>Brianna made a deep inhuman noise. Jamie clenched his teeth for a moment, but went on, holding tight to both her hands.</p><p>\u201cBut Maisie loved the light in the fields and the birds of the glen...\u201d</p><p>The light faded gradually from the room, and the smell of sun-warmed flowers was replaced by the damp green smell of the willows by the river, and the faint scent of woodsmoke from the cookhouse.</p><p>Brianna\u2019s shift was wet through, and stuck to her skin. I dug my thumbs into her back, just above the hips, and she squirmed hard against me, trying to ease the ache. Jamie sat with his head down, clinging doggedly to her hands, still talking soothingly, telling stories of silkies and seal catchers, of pipers and elves, of the great giants of Fingal\u2019s Cave, and the Devil\u2019s black horse that passes through the air faster than the thought between a man and a maid.</p><p>The pains were very close together. I motioned to Phaedre, who ran away and came back with a lighted taper, to light the candles in the sconces.</p><p>It was cool and dim in the room, the walls lit with flickering shadows. Jamie\u2019s voice was hoarse; Brianna\u2019s was nearly gone.</p><p>Suddenly she let go of him and sat up, grabbing at her knees, face dark red with effort, pushing.</p><p>\u201cNow, then,\u201d I said. I stacked pillows quickly behind her, made her lean back against the bedstead, called Phaedre to hold the candlestick for me.</p><p>I oiled my fingers, reached under her shift, and touched flesh I had not touched since she was a baby herself. I rubbed slowly, gently, talking to her, knowing it made no great difference what I said.</p><p>I felt the strain, the sudden change under my fingers. A relaxation, then once more. There was a sudden gush of amniotic fluid, that splashed across the bed and dripped on the floor, filling the room with the scent of fecund rivers. I rubbed and eased, praying that it would not come too fast, not tear her.</p><p>The ring of flesh opened suddenly, and my fingers touched something wet and hard. Relaxation, and it moved back, away, leaving the ends of my fingers tingling with the knowledge that I had touched someone entirely new. Once more the great pressure, the stretching came, and once more eased slowly back. I pushed back the edge of the shift, and with the next push the ring stretched to impossible size, and a head like a Chinese gargoyle popped out, with a flood of amniotic fluid and blood.</p><p>I found myself nose to nose with a waxy-white head with a face like a fist, that grimaced at me in utter fury.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it? Is it a boy?\u201d Jamie\u2019s hoarse question cut through my startlement.</p><p>\u201cI hope so,\u201d I said, hastily thumbing mucus from nose and mouth. \u201cIt\u2019s the ugliest thing I\u2019ve ever seen; God help it if it\u2019s a girl.\u201d</p><p>Brianna made a noise that might have started as a laugh, and turned into an enormous grunt of effort. I barely had time to get my fingers in and turn the wide shoulders slightly to help. There was an audible pop, and a long, wet form slithered out onto the soggy quilt, wriggling like a landed trout.</p><p>I seized a clean linen towel and wrapped him\u2014it was him, the scrotal sac swelled up round and purple between fat thighs\u2014checking quickly for his Apgar signs: breathing, color, activity...all good. He was making thin, angry noises, short explosions of breath, not really crying, and punching the air with clenched tiny fists.</p><p>I laid him on the bed, one hand on the bundle as I checked Brianna. Her thighs were smeared with blood, but there was no sign of hemorrhage. The cord was still pulsing, a thick wet snake of connection between them.</p><p>She was panting, lying back on the crushed pillows, hair plastered wetly to her temples, an enormous smile of relief and triumph on her face. I laid a hand on her belly, suddenly flaccid. Deep inside, I felt the placenta give way, as her body surrendered its last physical link with her son.</p><p>\u201cOnce more, honey,\u201d I said softly to her. The last contraction shivered over her belly, and the afterbirth slid out. I tied off the cord and cut it, and placed the solid little bundle of her child in her arms.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s beautiful,\u201d I whispered.</p><p>I left him to her, and turned my attention to immediate matters, kneading her belly firmly with my fists, to encourage the uterus to contract and stop the bleeding. I could hear the babble of excitement spreading through the house as Phaedre rushed downstairs to spread the news. I glanced upward once, to see Brianna glowing, still smiling from ear to ear. Jamie was behind her, also smiling, his cheeks wet with tears. He said something to her in husky Gaelic, and brushing the hair away from her neck, leaned forward and kissed her gently, just behind the ear.</p><p>\u201cIs he hungry?\u201d Brianna\u2019s voice was deep and cracked, and she tried to clear her throat. \u201cShall I feed him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTry him and see. Sometimes they\u2019re sleepy right afterward, but sometimes they want to nurse.\u201d</p><p>She fumbled at the neck of her shift and pulled loose the ribbon, baring one high, full breast. The bundle made small growf noises as she turned it awkwardly toward her, and her eyes sprang open in surprise as the mouth fastened on her nipple with sudden ferocity.</p><p>\u201cStrong, isn\u2019t he?\u201d I said, and realized that I was crying only when I tasted the salt of my tears running into the corners of my smile.</p><p>Sometime later, with mother and child cleaned up and made comfortable, food and drink brought for Brianna, and a last check assuring that all was well, I walked out into the deep shadows of the upper gallery. I felt pleasantly detached from reality, as though I were walking a foot or so off the ground.</p><p>Jamie had gone down to tell John; he was waiting for me at the foot of the stairs. He drew me into his arms without a word and kissed me; as he let me go I saw the deep red crescents of Brianna\u2019s nailmarks on his hands, not yet faded.</p><p>\u201cYe did brawly too,\u201d he whispered to me. Then the joy in his eyes bloomed bright and flowered in a face-splitting grin. \u201cGrannie!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs he dark or fair?\u201d Jamie asked suddenly, rising on one elbow beside me in bed. \u201cI counted his fingers, and I didna even think to look.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou can\u2019t really tell yet,\u201d I said drowsily. I\u2019d counted his toes, and I\u2019d thought of it. \u201cHe\u2019s sort of reddish-purple, and he\u2019s still got the vernix\u2014the white stuff\u2014all over him. It will probably be a day or two before his skin fades into a natural color. He\u2019s got just a bit of dark hair, but it\u2019s the sort that rubs off soon after birth.\u201d I stretched, enjoying the pleasant ache in legs and back; labor was hard work, even for the midwife. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t prove anything, even if he were fair, since Brianna is; he could be, either way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye...but if he were dark, we\u2019d know for sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe not. Your father was dark; so was mine. He could have recessive genes and come out dark even if\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe could have what?\u201d</p> <p>I tried without success to think whether Gregor Mendel had yet started messing about with his pea plants, but gave up the effort, too sleepy to concentrate. Whether he had or not, Jamie evidently hadn\u2019t heard of him.</p><p>\u201cHe could be any color, and we wouldn\u2019t know for sure,\u201d I said. I yawned widely. \u201cWe won\u2019t know until he gets old enough to start resembling...somebody. And even then...\u201d I trailed off. Did it matter a great deal who his father had been, if he wasn\u2019t going to have one?</p><p>Jamie rolled toward me and scooped me into a spooned embrace. We slept nak*d, and the hair on his body brushed against my skin. He kissed me softly on the back of the neck and sighed, his breath warm and tickling on my ear.</p><p>I hovered on the edge of sleep, too happy to fall completely over into dreams. Somewhere nearby, I heard a small stifled squawk, and the murmur of voices.</p><p>\u201cAye, well,\u201d Jamie\u2019s voice roused me, some moments later. He sounded defiant. \u201cIf I dinna ken his father, at least I\u2019m sure who his grandsire is.\u201d</p> <p>I reached back and patted his leg.</p><p>\u201cSo am I\u2014Grandpa. Hush up and go to sleep. \u2018Sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>He snorted, but his arms relaxed around me, hand curved on my breast, and in moments, he was asleep.</p><p>I lay wide-eyed, watching stars through the open window. Why had I said that? It was Frank\u2019s favorite quotation, one he always used to soothe Brianna or me when we worried over things: Sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof.</p><p>The air in the room was live; a light breeze stirred the curtains, and coolness touched my cheek.</p><p>\u201cDo you know?\u201d I whispered, soundless. \u201cDo you know she has a son?\u201d</p> <p>There was no answer, but peace came gradually over me in the quiet of the night, and I fell at last over the edge of dreams.</p><p>65</p><p>RETURN TO FRASER\u2019S RIDGE</p><p>Jocasta was loath to part with her newest relative, but the spring planting was already very late, and the homestead sadly neglected; we needed to return to the Ridge without delay, and Brianna would not hear of staying behind. Which was a good thing, as it would have taken dyn**ite to separate Jamie from his grandson.</p><p>Lord John was well enough to travel; he came with us as far as the Great Buffalo Trail Road, where he kissed Brianna and the baby, embraced Jamie and\u2014to my shock\u2014me, before turning north toward Virginia and Willie.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll trust you to take care of them,\u201d he said quietly to me, with a nod toward the wagon, where two bright heads bent together in mutual absorption over the bundle in Brianna\u2019s lap.</p><p>\u201cYou may,\u201d I said, and pressed his hand. \u201cI\u2019ll trust you, too.\u201d He lifted my hand to his lips, briefly, smiled at me, and rode away without looking back.</p><p>A week later, we bumped over the grass-choked ruts to the ridge where the wild strawberries grew, green and white and red together, constancy and courage, sweetness and bitterness mingled in the shadows of the trees.</p> <p>The cabin was dirty and uncared for, its sheds empty and full of dead leaves. The garden was a tangle of old dried stalks and random shoots, the paddock an empty shell. The framework of the new house stood black and skeletal, reproachful on the Ridge. The place looked barely habitable, a ruin.</p><p>I had never felt such joy in any homecoming, ever.</p><p>Name, I wrote, and paused. God knew, I thought. His last name was open to question; his Christian name not yet even considered.</p><p>I called him \u201csweetie\u201d or \u201cdarling,\u201d Lizzie called him \u201cdear lad,\u201d Jamie addressed him with Gaelic formality either as \u201cgrandson\u201d or \u201ca Ruaidh,\u201d the Red One\u2014his dark infant fuzz and dusky skin having given way to a blazing fair ruddiness that made it clear to the most casual observer just who his grandsire was\u2014whoever his father might have been.</p><p>Brianna found no need to call him anything; she kept him always with her, guarding him with a fierce absorption that went beyond words. She would not give him a formal name, she said. Not yet.</p><p>\u201cWhen?\u201d Lizzie had asked, but Brianna didn\u2019t answer. I knew when; when Roger came.</p><p>\u201cAnd if he doesna come,\u201d said Jamie privately to me, \u201cI expect the poor wee lad will go to his grave wi\u2019 no name at all. Christ, that lass is stubborn!\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe trusts Roger,\u201d I said evenly. \u201cYou might try to do the same.\u201d</p><p>He gave me a sharp look.</p><p>\u201cThere is a difference between trust and hope, Sassenach, and ye ken that as well as I do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, have a stab at hope, then, why don\u2019t you?\u201d I snapped, and turned my back on him, dipping my quill and shaking it elaborately. Little Query Mark had a rash on his bottom, that had kept him\u2014and everyone else in the house\u2014awake all night. I was grainy\u2014eyed and cross, and not inclined to tolerate any show of bad faith.</p><p>Jamie walked deliberately around the table and sat down opposite me, resting his chin on his folded arms, so that I was forced to look at him.</p><p>\u201cI would,\u201d he said, a shadow of humor in his eyes. \u201cIf I could decide whether to hope he comes or hope he does not.\u201d</p><p>I smiled, then reached across and ran the feathered tip of my quill down the bridge of his nose in token of forgiveness, before returning to my work. He wrinkled his nose and sneezed, then sat up straight, peering at the paper.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that you\u2019re doing, Sassenach?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaking out little Gizmo\u2019s birth certificate\u2014so far as I can,\u201d I added.</p><p>\u201cGizmo?\u201d he said doubtfully. \u201cThat will be a saint\u2019s name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI shouldn\u2019t think so, though you never know, what with people named Pantaleon and Onuphrius. Or Ferreolus.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFerreolus? I dinna think I ken that one.\u201d He leaned back, hands linked over his knee.</p><p>\u201cOne of my favorites,\u201d I told him, carefully filling in the birthdate and time of birth\u2014even that was an estimate, poor thing. There were precisely two bits of unequivocal information on this birth certificate\u2014the date and the name of the doctor who\u2019d delivered him.</p><p>\u201cFerreolus,\u201d I went on with some enjoyment, \u201cis the patron saint of sick poultry. Christian martyr. He was a Roman tribune and a secret Christian. Having been found out, he was chained up in the prison cesspool to await trial\u2014I suppose the cells must have been full. Sounds rather a daredevil; he slipped his chains and escaped through the sewer. They caught up with him, though, dragged him back and beheaded him.\u201d</p><p>Jamie looked blank.</p><p>\u201cWhat has that got to do wi\u2019 chickens?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t the faintest idea. Take it up with the Vatican,\u201d I advised him.</p><p>\u201cMmphm. Aye, well, I\u2019ve always been fond of Saint Guignole, myself.\u201d I could see the glint in his eye, but couldn\u2019t resist.</p><p>\u201cAnd what\u2019s he the patron of?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s invoked against impotence.\u201d The glint got stronger. \u201cI saw a statue of him in Brest once; they did say it had been there for a thousand years. \u2019Twas a miraculous statue\u2014it had a c*ck like a gun muzzle, and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cA what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, the size wasna the miraculous bit,\u201d he said, waving me to silence. \u201cOr not quite. The townsfolk say that for a thousand years, folk have whittled away bits of it as holy relics, and yet the c*ck is still as big as ever.\u201d He grinned at me. \u201cThey do say that a man wi\u2019 a bit of St. Guignole in his pocket can last a night and a day without tiring.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot with the same woman, I don\u2019t imagine,\u201d I said dryly. \u201cIt does rather make you wonder what he did to merit sainthood, though, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>He laughed.</p><p>\u201cAny man who\u2019s had his prayer answered could tell ye that, Sassenach.\u201d He swiveled on his stool, looking out the open door. Brianna and Lizzie sat on the grass, skirts blooming around them, watching the baby, who lay nak*d on an old shawl on his stomach, red-arsed as a baboon.</p><p>Brianna Ellen, I wrote neatly, then paused.</p><p>\u201cBrianna Ellen Randall, do you think?\u201d I asked. \u201cOr Fraser? Or both?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t turn around, but his shoulder moved in the faintest of shrugs.</p><p>\u201cDoes it matter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt might.\u201d I blew across the page, watching the shiny black letters go dull as the ink dried. \u201cIf Roger comes back\u2014whether he stays or not\u2014if he chooses to acknowledge little Anonymous, I suppose his name will be MacKenzie. If he doesn\u2019t or won\u2019t, then I imagine the baby takes his mother\u2019s name.\u201d</p><p>He was silent for a moment, watching the two girls. They had washed their hair in the creek that morning; Lizzie was combing out Brianna\u2019s mane, the long strands shimmering like red silk in the summer sun.</p><p>\u201cShe calls herself Fraser,\u201d he said softly. \u201cOr she did.\u201d</p><p>I put down my quill and reached across the table to lay a hand on his arm.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s forgiven you,\u201d I said. \u201cYou know she has.\u201d</p><p>His shoulders moved; not quite a shrug, but the unconscious attempt to ease some inner tightness.</p><p>\u201cFor now,\u201d he said. \u201cBut if the man doesna come?\u201d</p><p>I hesitated. He was quite right; Brianna had forgiven him for his original mistake. Still, if Roger did not appear soon, she would be bound to blame Jamie for it\u2014not without reason, I was forced to admit.</p><p>\u201cUse both,\u201d he said abruptly. \u201cLet her choose.\u201d I didn\u2019t think he meant last names.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll come,\u201d I said firmly, \u201cand it will be all right.\u201d</p><p>I picked up the quill, and added, not quite under my breath. \u201cI hope.\u201d</p><p>He stooped to drink, the water splashing over dark green rock. It was a warm day; spring now, not autumn, but the moss was still emerald-green underfoot.</p><p>The memory of a razor was far behind him; his beard was thick and his hair hung past his shoulders. He\u2019d bathed in a creek the night before, and done his best to wash himself and his clothes, but he had no illusions about his appearance. Neither did he care, he told himself. What he looked like didn\u2019t matter.</p><p>He turned toward the path where he had left his horse, limping. His foot ached, but that didn\u2019t matter either.</p><p>He rode slowly through the clearing where he had first met Jamie Fraser. The leaves were new and green, and in the distance he could hear the raucous calling of the ravens. Nothing stirred among the trees but the wild grasses. He breathed deep and felt a stab of memory, a broken remnant from a past life, a shard sharp as glass. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He turned his horse\u2019s head toward the top of the Ridge and urged it on, kicking gently with his good foot. Soon now. He had no idea what his reception might be, but that didn\u2019t matter.</p><p>Nothing mattered now save the fact that he was here.</p><p>66</p><p>CHILD OF MY BLOOD</p> <p>Some enterprising rabbit had dug its way under the stakes of my garden again. One voracious rabbit could eat a cabbage down to the roots, and from the looks of things, he\u2019d brought friends. I sighed and squatted to repair the damage, packing rocks and earth back into the hole. The loss of Ian was a constant ache; at such moments as this, I missed his horrible dog as well.</p><p>I had brought a large collection of cuttings and seeds from River Run, most of which had survived the journey. It was mid-June, still time\u2014barely\u2014to put in a fresh crop of carrots. The small patch of potato vines was all right, so were the peanut bushes; rabbits wouldn\u2019t touch those, and didn\u2019t care for the aromatic herbs either, except the fennel, which they gobbled like licorice.</p><p>I wanted cabbages, though, to preserve as sauerkraut; come midwinter, we would want food with some taste to it, as well as some vitamin C. I had enough seed left, and could raise a couple of decent crops before the weather turned cold, if I could keep the bloody rabbits off. I drummed my fingers on the handle of my basket, thinking. The Indians scattered clippings of their hair around the edges of the fields, but that was more protection against deer than rabbits.</p><p>Jamie was the best repellent, I decided. Nayawenne had told me that the scent of carnivore urine would keep rabbits away\u2014and a man who ate meat was nearly as good as a mountain lion, to say nothing of being more biddable. Yes, that would do; he\u2019d shot a deer only two days ago; it was still hanging. I should brew a fresh bucket of spruce beer to go with the roast venison, though...</p><p>As I wandered toward the herb shed to see if I had any maypop fruits for flavoring, my eye caught a movement at the far edge of the clearing. Thinking it was Jamie, I turned to go and inform him of his new duty, only to be stopped dead in my tracks when I saw who it was.</p> <p>He looked worse than he had the last time I\u2019d seen him, which was saying quite a bit. He was hatless, hair and beard a glossy black tangle, and his clothes hung on him in tatters. He was barefoot, one foot wrapped in a bundle of filthy rags, and he limped badly.</p><p>He saw me at once, and stopped while I came up to him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad it\u2019s you,\u201d he said. \u201cI wondered who I\u2019d meet first.\u201d His voice sounded soft and rusty, and I wondered whether he had spoken to a living soul since we had left him in the mountains.</p><p>\u201cYour foot, Roger\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d He gripped my arm. \u201cAre they all right? The baby? And Brianna?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re fine. Everybody\u2019s in the house.\u201d His head turned toward the cabin, and I added, \u201cYou have a son.\u201d</p> <p>He jerked sharply back toward me, green eyes wide with startlement.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s mine? I have a son?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose you do,\u201d I said. \u201cYou\u2019re here, aren\u2019t you?\u201d The look of startlement\u2014and hope, I realized\u2014faded slowly. He looked into my eyes and seemed to see how I felt, for he smiled\u2014not easily, no more than a painful lifting of the corner of his mouth\u2014but he smiled.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here,\u201d he said, and turned toward the cabin and its open doorway.</p><p>Jamie sat in his rolled-up shirt sleeves at the table, shoulder to shoulder with Brianna, frowning at a set of house drawings as she pointed with her quill. Both of them were liberally covered with ink, being inclined to enthusiasm when discussing architecture. The baby snored peacefully in his cradle nearby; Brianna was rocking it absently with one foot. Lizzie was spinning by the window, humming softly under her breath as the great wheel went round.</p><p>\u201cVery domestic,\u201d Roger said under his breath, stopping in the door-yard. \u201cSeems a shame to disturb them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you have a choice?\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cAye, I do,\u201d he replied. \u201cBut I\u2019ve made it already.\u201d He walked purposefully up to the open door and stepped inside.</p> <p>Jamie reacted instantly to this unfamiliar darkening of his door; he pushed Brianna off the bench and lunged for his pistols on the wall. He had one leveled at Roger\u2019s chest before he realized what\u2014or whom\u2014he was looking at, and lowered it with a small exclamation of disgust.</p><p>\u201cOh, it\u2019s you,\u201d he said.</p><p>The baby, rudely wakened by the crash of the overturned bench, was shrieking like a fire engine. Brianna scooped him out of his cradle and clasped him to her breast, looking wild-eyed at the apparition in the door.</p><p>I had forgotten that she hadn\u2019t had the benefit of seeing him even as recently as I had; he must be substantially changed from the young history professor who\u2019d left her in Wilmington nearly a year before.</p><p>Roger took a step toward her; instinctively, she took a step back. He stood quite still, looking at the child. She sat down on the nursing stool, fumbling at her bodice, bending protectively over the baby. She pulled a shawl across her shoulder and gave him a breast in its shelter, and he stopped squawking at once.</p><p>I saw Roger\u2019s eyes shift from the baby to Jamie. Jamie stood beside Brianna with that utter stillness that so frightened me\u2014straight and still as a stick of dyn**ite, with a lit match laid a hairsbreadth from the fuse.</p><p>The flame of Brianna\u2019s head moved slightly, looking from one to the other, and I saw what she saw; the echo of Jamie\u2019s dangerous stillness in Roger. It was both unexpected and shocking; I had never seen any resemblance between them at all\u2014and yet at the moment they might have been day and dark, images of fire and night, each mirroring the other.</p><p>MacKenzie, I thought suddenly. Viking beasts, bloody-minded and big. And saw the third echo of that flaming heritage blaze up in Brianna\u2019s eyes, the only thing alive in her face.</p><p>I should say something, do something, to break the awful stillness. But my mouth was dry, and there was nothing I could say in any case.</p><p>Roger\u2019s reached his hand toward Jamie, palm up, and the gesture held no hint of supplication.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t imagine it pleases you any more than it does me,\u201d he said, in his rusty voice, \u201cbut you are my nearest kinsman. Cut me. I\u2019ve come to swear an oath in our shared blood.\u201d</p><p>I couldn\u2019t tell whether Jamie hesitated or not; time seemed to have stopped, the air in the room crystallized around us. Then I watched Jamie\u2019s dirk cut the air, honed edge draw swift across the thin, tanned wrist, and blood well red and sudden in its path.</p><p>To my surprise, Roger didn\u2019t look at Brianna, or reach for her hand. Instead, he swiped his thumb across his bleeding wrist, and stepped close to her, eyes on the baby. She pulled back instinctively, but Jamie\u2019s hand came down on her shoulder.</p><p>She stilled at once under its weight, at once a promise of restraint and protection, but she held the child tight, cradled against her breast. Roger knelt in front of her, and reaching out, pushed the shawl aside and smeared a broad red cross upon the downy curve of the baby\u2019s forehead.</p><p>\u201cYou are blood of my blood,\u201d he said softly, \u201cand bone of my bone. I claim thee as my son before all men, from this day forever.\u201d He looked up at Jamie, challenging. After a long moment, Jamie gave the slightest nod of acknowledgment, and stepped back, letting his hand fall from Brianna\u2019s shoulder.</p><p>Roger\u2019s gaze shifted to Brianna.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you call him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing\u2014yet.\u201d Her eyes rested on him, questioning. It was only too clear that the man who had come back was not the man who\u2019d left her.</p><p>Roger\u2019s eyes were fixed on hers as he stood. Blood was still dripping from his wrist. With a small shock, I realized that she was as changed to him as he to her.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s my son,\u201d Roger said quietly, nodding at the baby. \u201cAre you my wife?\u201d</p><p>Brianna had gone pale to the lips.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis man says that you are handfast.\u201d Jamie took a step closer to her, watching Roger. \u201cIs that true?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2014we were.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe still are.\u201d Roger took a deep breath, and I realized suddenly that he was about to fall over, whether from hunger, exhaustion, or the shock of being cut. I took his arm, made him sit down, sent Lizzie to the dairy shed for milk, and fetched down my small medical box to bind his wrist.</p><p>This small bustle of normality seemed to break the tension a little. Meaning to help things along in that direction, I broke out a bottle of brandy from River Run, pouring a cup for Jamie, and putting a good-sized dollop in Roger\u2019s milk. Jamie gave me a wry look, but sat back on the replaced bench and sipped his drink.</p><p>\u201cVerra well, then,\u201d he said, calling the meeting to order. \u201cIf you\u2019re handfast, Brianna, then you\u2019re married and this man is your husband.\u201d</p><p>Brianna\u2019s flush deepened, but she looked at Roger, not Jamie.</p><p>\u201cYou said handfasting was good for a year and a day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you said ye did not want anything temporary.\u201d</p><p>She flinched at that, but then set her lips firmly.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t. But I didn\u2019t know what was going to happen.\u201d She glanced at me and Jamie, then back at Roger. \u201cThey told you\u2014that the baby isn\u2019t yours?\u201d</p><p>Roger raised his eyebrows.</p><p>\u201cOh, but he is mine. Mm?\u201d He lifted his bandaged wrist in illustration.</p><p>Brianna\u2019s face had lost its frostbitten look; she was pink around the edges.</p><p>\u201cYou know what I mean.\u201d</p><p>He met her eyes straight on.</p><p>\u201cI know what you mean,\u201d he said softly. \u201cI am sorry for it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t your fault.\u201d</p><p>Roger glanced at Jamie.</p><p>\u201cAye, it was,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cI should have stayed with you; seen you safe.\u201d</p><p>Brianna\u2019s brows drew together.</p><p>\u201cI told you to go, and I meant it.\u201d She twitched her shoulders impatiently. \u201cBut it doesn\u2019t matter now.\u201d She took a firmer hold on the baby and sat up straight.</p><p>\u201cI just want to know one thing,\u201d she said, her voice trembling only a little. \u201cI want to know why you came back.\u201d</p><p>He set his empty cup down deliberately.</p><p>\u201cDid ye not want me to come back?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever mind what I wanted. What I want now is to know. Did you come back because you wanted to\u2014or because you thought you should?\u201d</p><p>He looked at her for a long moment, then down at his hands, still clasped around the cup.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps both. Perhaps neither. I don\u2019t know,\u201d he said very softly. \u201cThat\u2019s God\u2019s truth; I don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you go to the stone circle?\u201d she asked. He nodded, not looking at her. He fumbled in his pocket, and laid the big opal stone on the table.</p><p>\u201cI went there. That\u2019s why I was long in coming; it took me a long time to find it.\u201d</p><p>She was silent for a moment, then nodded.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t go back. But you can. Maybe you should.\u201d She looked at him straight on, her gaze the twin of her father\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to live with you, if you came back for duty,\u201d she said. She looked at me then, her eyes soft with pain. \u201cI\u2019ve seen a marriage made from obligation\u2014and I\u2019ve seen one made for love. If I hadn\u2019t\u2014\u201d She stopped and swallowed, then went on, looking at Roger. \u201cIf I hadn\u2019t seen both, I could have lived with obligation. But I have seen both\u2014and I won\u2019t.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I felt as though someone had struck me in the breastbone. My marriages, she meant. I looked for Jamie, and found him looking at me with the same expression of shock I knew was on my own face. He coughed to break the silence, and cleared his throat, turning to Roger.</p><p>\u201cWhen were ye handfast?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeptember the second,\u201d Roger answered promptly.</p><p>\u201cAnd now it is mid-June.\u201d Jamie glanced from one to the other, frowning.</p> <p>\u201cWell, mo nighean, if you are handfast with this man, then you are bound to him; there\u2019s no question.\u201d He turned and gave Roger a dark blue stare. \u201cSo you\u2019ll live here, as her husband. And on September the third, she will choose whether she\u2019ll wed ye by priest and book\u2014or whether ye\u2019ll leave and trouble her no more. Ye\u2019ve that long to decide why you\u2019re here\u2014and convince her of it.\u201d</p><p>Roger and Brianna both started to speak, to protest, but he stopped them, picking up the dirk he had left on the table. He lowered the blade gently, until it touched the cloth over Roger\u2019s chest.</p><p>\u201cYe\u2019ll live here as her husband, I said. But if ye touch her unwilling, I\u2019ll cut your heart out and feed it to the pig. Ye understand me?\u201d</p><p>Roger stared down at the gleaming blade for a long moment, no expression visible beneath the thick beard, then lifted his head to meet Jamie\u2019s eyes.</p><p>\u201cYou think I\u2019d trouble a woman who didn\u2019t want me?\u201d</p> <p>A rather awkward question, given that Jamie had beaten him to pulp under precisely that mistaken assumption. Roger put a hand on Jamie\u2019s and shoved the dirk point-first into the table. He pushed back his stool abruptly and stood up, turned on his heel, and left.</p><p>Just as quickly, Jamie stood and went after him, sheathing his dirk as he went.</p><p>Brianna looked at me helplessly.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think he\u2019ll\u2014\u201d</p><p>She was interrupted by a loud thud and an equally loud grunt, as a heavy body struck the wall outside.</p><p>\u201cTreat her badly and I\u2019ll rip your balls off and cram them down your throat,\u201d Jamie\u2019s voice said softly, in Gaelic.</p> <p>I glanced at Brianna, and saw that her mastery of Gaelic was sufficient to have appreciated the gist of this. Her mouth opened, but she didn\u2019t get a word out.</p><p>There was the sound of a quick scuffle outside, ending in an even louder thump, as of a head striking logs.</p><p>Roger didn\u2019t have Jamie\u2019s air of quiet menace, but his voice rang with sincerity. \u201cLay hands on me once more, you f**king sod, and I\u2019ll stuff your head back up your arse where it came from!\u201d</p><p>There was a moment\u2019s silence, and then the sound of feet moving off. A moment later, Jamie made a Scottish noise deep in his throat, and moved off too.</p><p>Brianna\u2019s eyes were round as she looked at me.</p><p>\u201cTestosterone poisoning,\u201d I said, with a shrug.</p><p>\u201cCan you do anything about it?\u201d she asked. The corner of her mouth twitched, though I couldn\u2019t tell whether with laughter or incipient hysteria.</p><p>I pushed a hand through my hair, considering.</p> <p>\u201cWell,\u201d I said finally, \u201cthere are only two things they do with it, and one of them is try to kill each other.\u201d</p><p>Brianna rubbed her nose.</p><p>\u201cUh-huh,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd the other...\u201d Our eyes met with a perfect understanding.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take care of your father,\u201d I said. \u201cBut Roger\u2019s up to you.\u201d</p><p>Life on the mountain was a trifle tense, with Brianna and Roger behaving respectively like a trapped hare and a cornered badger, Jamie fixing Roger with brooding looks of Gaelic disapproval over the supper table, Lizzie falling over her feet to apologize to everyone in sight, and the baby deciding that the time was ripe to have nightly attacks of screaming colic.</p><p>It was probably the colic that spurred Jamie into a frenzy of activity on the new house. Fergus and some of the tenants had kindly put in a small planting for us, so that while we would have no extra corn this year to sell, at least we would eat. Freed of the need to tend a large acreage, Jamie instead spent every free moment on the ridge, hammering and sawing.</p><p>Roger was doing his best to assist with the other farm chores, though hampered by his lame foot. He had several times brushed off my attempts to treat it, but now I refused to be put off any longer. A few days after his arrival, I made my preparations and informed him firmly that I meant to deal with it first thing in the morning.</p><p>The time come, I made him lie down, and unwrapped the layers of rags wound around his foot. The sweet-rotten smell of deep infection tickled my nose, but I thanked God to see neither the red streaks of blood poisoning nor the black tinges of incipient gangrene. It was bad enough, for all that.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got chronic abscesses, deep in the tissue,\u201d I said, probing firmly with my thumbs. I could feel the squishy yielding of pockets of pus, and as I squeezed harder, the half-healed wounds broke open and a nasty yellow-gray slime oozed from an inflamed crack at the edge of the sole.</p><p>Roger went white under his tan, and his hands clenched on the wooden frame of the bed, but he didn\u2019t make a sound.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re lucky,\u201d I said, still working his foot back and forth, flexing the tiny joints of the metacarpals. \u201cYou\u2019ve been breaking open the abscesses and partially draining them by walking on it. They re-form, of course, but the movement\u2019s kept the infection from moving much deeper, and it\u2019s kept your foot flexible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, good,\u201d he said faintly.</p><p>\u201cBree, I need you to help,\u201d I said, turning casually toward the far end of the room, where the two girls sat, taking turns between baby and spinning wheel.</p><p>\u201cI could; let me do it.\u201d Lizzie sprang up, eager to help. Remorseful over her part in Roger\u2019s ordeal, she had been trying to make amends in any way possible, constantly bringing him bits of food, offering to mend his clothes, and driving him mad generally with her expressions of contrition.</p><p>I smiled at her.</p><p>\u201cYes, you can help. Take the baby so Brianna can come here. Why don\u2019t you take him outside for a little air?\u201d</p><p>With a dubious glance, Lizzie did as I said, scooping little Gizmo into her arms and murmuring endearments to him as they went out. Brianna came to stand beside me, carefully keeping her eyes off Roger\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to open this up and drain it the best I can,\u201d I said, indicating the long black-crusted slit. \u201cThen we\u2019ll have to debride the dead tissue, disinfect it, and hope for the best.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what exactly does \u2018debride\u2019 mean?\u201d Roger asked. I let go of his foot and his body relaxed, very slightly.</p><p>\u201cCleansing of a wound by the surgical or nonsurgical removal of dead tissue or bone,\u201d I said. I touched his foot. \u201cLuckily, I don\u2019t think the bone\u2019s been affected, though there may be a bit of damage in the cartilage between the metacarpals. Don\u2019t worry,\u201d I said, patting his leg. \u201cThe debridement isn\u2019t going to hurt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. It\u2019s the draining and disinfecting that will hurt.\u201d I glanced up at Bree. \u201cGo take hold of his hands, please.\u201d</p><p>She hesitated no more than a second, then moved to the head of the couch and held out her hands to him. He took them, his eyes on her. It was the first time they had touched each other in nearly a year.</p><p>\u201cHold on tight,\u201d I instructed them. \u201cThis is the nasty part.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t look up, but worked quickly, opening the half-healed wounds cleanly with a scalpel, pressing out as much pus and dead matter as I could. I could feel the tension quivering in his leg muscles, and the slight arcing of his body as the pain lifted and bent him, but he didn\u2019t say a word.</p><p>\u201cDo you want something to bite down on, Roger?\u201d I asked, taking out my bottle of dilute alcohol-water mixture for irrigating. \u201cIt\u2019s going to sting a bit, now.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t answer; Brianna did.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s all right,\u201d she said steadily. \u201cGo ahead.\u201d</p><p>He made a muffled noise when I began to wash out the wounds, and rolled halfway onto his side, his leg convulsing. I kept tight hold of his foot and finished the job as quickly as possible. When I let go and recorked the bottle, I looked up toward the head of the bed. She was sitting on the bed, her arms locked tight around his shoulders. His face was buried in her lap, his arms around her waist. Her face was white, but she gave me a strained smile.</p><p>\u201cIs it over?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe bad part is. Just a little more to do,\u201d I assured them. I had made my preparations two days before; at this time of year, there was no difficulty. I went outside to the smoking shed. The venison carcass hung in the shadows, bathing in clouds of protectively fragrant hickory smoke. My goal was less thoroughly preserved meat, though.</p><p>Good, it had been out long enough. I picked up the small saucer from its place near the door and carried it back to the house.</p><p>\u201cPhew!\u201d Brianna wrinkled her nose as I came in. \u201cWhat\u2019s that? It smells like rotten meat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what it is.\u201d The partial remains of a snare-killed rabbit, to be exact, retrieved from the edge of the garden and set out to wait for visitors.</p><p>She was still holding his hands. I smiled to myself and resumed my place, picking up the wounded foot and reaching for my long-nosed forceps.</p><p>\u201cMama! What are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt won\u2019t hurt,\u201d I said. I squeezed the foot slightly, spreading one of my surgical incisions. I picked one of the small white grubs out of the stinking scraps of rabbit meat and inserted it deftly into the gaping slit.</p><p>Roger\u2019s eyes had been closed, his forehead sheened with sweat.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d he said, lifting his head and squinting over his shoulder in an effort to see what I was doing. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPutting maggots in the wounds,\u201d I said, intent on my work. \u201cI learned it from an old Indian lady I used to know.\u201d</p><p>Twin sounds indicative of shock and nausea came from the bedhead, but I kept a tight hold on his foot and went on with it.</p><p>\u201cIt works,\u201d I said, frowning slightly as I opened another incision and deposited three of the wriggling white larvae. \u201cMuch better than the usual means of debridement; for that, I\u2019d have to open up your foot much more extensively, and physically scrape out as much dead tissue as I could reach\u2014which would not only hurt like the dickens, it would likely cripple you permanently. Our little friends here eat dead tissue, though; they can get into tiny places where I couldn\u2019t reach, and do a nice, thorough job.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOur friends the maggots,\u201d Brianna muttered. \u201cGod, Mama!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat, exactly, is going to stop them eating my entire leg?\u201d Roger asked with a thoroughly spurious attempt at detachment. \u201cThey...um...they spread, don\u2019t they?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no,\u201d I assured him cheerfully. \u201cMaggots are larval forms; they don\u2019t breed. They also don\u2019t eat live tissue\u2014only the nasty dead stuff. If there\u2019s enough to get them through their pupal cycle, they\u2019ll develop into tiny flies and fly off\u2014if not, when the food\u2019s exhausted, they\u2019ll simply crawl out, searching for more.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Both faces were a pale green by now. Finished with the work, I wrapped the foot loosely in gauze bandages, and patted Roger\u2019s leg.</p><p>\u201cThere now,\u201d I said. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019ve seen it before. One brave told me that they tickle a bit, gnawing, but it doesn\u2019t hurt at all.\u201d</p><p>I picked up the saucer and took it outside to wash. At the edge of the dooryard I met Jamie, coming down from the new house, Ruaidh in his arms.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s Grannie,\u201d he informed the baby, removing his thumb from Ruaidh\u2019s mouth and wiping saliva from it against the side of his kilt. \u201cIs she no a bonny woman?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGleh,\u201d said Ruaidh, focusing a slightly cross-eyed look on his grandfather\u2019s shirt button, which he began to mouth in a meditative fashion.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t let him swallow that,\u201d I said, standing on tiptoe and kissing first Jamie, then the baby. \u201cWhere\u2019s Lizzie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI found the lassie sitting on a stump, greetin\u2019,\u201d he said. \u201cSo I took the lad and sent her off to be by herself for a bit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was crying? What\u2019s the matter?\u201d</p><p>A small shadow crossed Jamie\u2019s face.</p> <p>\u201cShe\u2019ll be grieving for Ian, won\u2019t she?\u201d Putting that and his own grief aside, he took my arm and turned back toward the trail up the ridge.</p><p>\u201cCome up wi\u2019 me, Sassenach, and see what I\u2019ve done the day. I\u2019ve laid the floor for your surgery; all that\u2019s needed now is a bit of a temporary roof, and it\u2019ll do for sleeping.\u201d He glanced back toward the cabin. \u201cI was thinking that MacKenzie might be put there\u2014for the time being.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood idea.\u201d Even with the additional small room to the cabin that he had built for Brianna and Lizzie, conditions were more than crowded. And if Roger was to be bedridden for several days, I would as soon not have him lying in the middle of the cabin.</p><p>\u201cHow are they faring?\u201d he asked, with assumed casualness.</p><p>\u201cWho? Brianna and Roger, you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho else?\u201d he asked, dropping the casualness. \u201cIs it well between them?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, I think so. They\u2019re getting used to each other again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey are?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I said, with a glance back at the cabin. \u201cHe\u2019s just thrown up in her lap.\u201d</p><p>67</p><p>THE TOSS OF A COIN</p><p>Roger rolled onto his side and sat up. There was no glass in the windows as yet\u2014none needed, so long as the summer weather kept fine\u2014and the surgery was at the front of the new house, facing the slope. If he craned his neck to one side, he could watch Brianna most of the way down to the cabin, before the chestnut trees hid her from view.</p><p>A last flick of rusty homespun, and she was gone. She\u2019d come without the baby this evening; he didn\u2019t know whether that was progress or the reverse. They\u2019d been able to talk without the incessant interruptions of wet diapers, squawking, fussing, feeding, and spitting up; that was a rare luxury.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t stayed as long as usual, though\u2014he could feel the presence of the child pulling her away, as though she were tethered to it by a rubber band. He did not resent the little bugger, he told himself grimly. It was only that...well, only that he resented the little bugger. Didn\u2019t mean he didn\u2019t like him.</p> <p>He hadn\u2019t eaten yet; hadn\u2019t wanted to waste any of their rare solitude. He uncovered the basket she\u2019d brought and inhaled the warm, rich scent of squirrel stew and salt-rising bread with fresh butter. Apple tart, too.</p><p>His foot still throbbed, and it took considerable effort not to think of the helpful maggots, but in spite of that, his appetite had returned with a vengeance. He ate slowly, savoring both the food and the quiet dusk creeping over the mountainside below.</p><p>Fraser had known what he was about when he\u2019d chosen the site of this house. It commanded the entire slope of the mountain, with a view that ran to the distant river and beyond, with mist-filled valleys in the distance and dark peaks that touched a star-strewn sky. It was one of the most solitary, magnificent, heart-wrenchingly romantic spots he had ever seen.</p><p>And Brianna was down below, nursing a small bald parasite, while he was here\u2014alone with a few dozen of his own.</p><p>He put the empty basket on the floor, hopped to the slop jar in the corner, then back to his lonely bed on the new surgery table. Why in hell had he told her he didn\u2019t know, when she\u2019d asked why he\u2019d come back?</p><p>Well, because just then, he hadn\u2019t known. He\u2019d been wandering in the bloody wilderness for months, half starved and off his head with solitude and pain. He hadn\u2019t seen her in nearly a year\u2014a year in which he\u2019d gone through hell and back. He\u2019d sat on the cliff above that bloody stone circle for three solid days without food or fire, thinking things over, trying to decide. And in the end he\u2019d simply gotten up and begun walking, knowing that it was the only possible choice.</p><p>Obligation? Love? How in hell could you have love without obligation?</p><p>He turned restlessly onto his other side, turning his back on the glorious night of scent and sun-warmed winds. The trouble with being restored to health was that some parts of him were getting a damn sight too healthy for comfort, given that the chance of their having any proper exercise was something below nil.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t even suggest such a thing to Brianna. One, she might think he\u2019d come back solely for that, and two, the bloody Great Scot had not been joking about the pig.</p><p>He knew now. He\u2019d come back because he couldn\u2019t live on the other side. If it were guilt over abandoning them\u2014or the simple knowledge that he would die without her...either or both, take your choice. He knew what he was giving up, and none of it bloody mattered; he had to be here, that was all.</p><p>He flopped onto his back, staring up at the dim paleness of the pine boards that roofed his shelter. Thumps and skitterings announced the nightly visitation of squirrels from the nearby hickory tree, who found it a convenient shortcut.</p><p>How to tell her that, so she would believe it? Christ, she was so jumpy that she\u2019d barely let him touch her. A brush of lips, a touch of hands, and she was sidling away. Except for the day when she\u2019d held him while Claire had tortured his foot. Then, she\u2019d been truly there for him, hanging on with all her strength. He could still feel her arms around him, and the memory gave him a small thump of satisfaction in the pit of his stomach.</p><p>Thinking on that, he wondered a bit. True, the doctoring had hurt like buggery, but it was nothing he couldn\u2019t have stood with a little tooth-gritting, and Claire, with her battlefield experience, would certainly have known that.</p><p>Done it on purpose, had she? Given Bree a chance to touch him without feeling pressured or pursued? Given him a chance to remember just how strong the pull between them was? He rolled again, onto his stomach this time, and lay with his chin on his folded arms, looking out into the soft dark outside.</p><p>She could have the other foot, if she\u2019d do it again.</p><p>Claire looked in on him once or twice each day, but he waited until the end of the week, when she came to remove the bandages, the maggots having presumably done their dirty work and\u2014he hoped to God\u2014cleared out.</p><p>\u201cOh, lovely,\u201d she said, poking his foot with a surgeon\u2019s ghoulish delight. \u201cGranulating beautifully; almost no inflammation left.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat,\u201d he said. \u201cAre they gone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe maggots? Oh, yes,\u201d she assured him. \u201cThey pupate within a few days. Did a nice job, didn\u2019t they?\u201d She ran a delicate thumbnail along the side of his foot, which tickled.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take your word for it. I\u2019m clear to walk on it, then?\u201d He flexed the foot experimentally. It hurt a bit, but nothing compared to what it had before.</p><p>\u201cYes. Don\u2019t wear shoes for a few more days, though. And for God\u2019s sake, don\u2019t step on anything sharp.\u201d</p><p>She began to put away her things, humming to herself. She looked happy but tired; there were shadows under her eyes.</p><p>\u201cKid still howling at night?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cYes, poor thing. Can you hear him up here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. You just look tired.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not surprised. Nobody\u2019s had a good night\u2019s sleep all week, especially poor Bree, since she\u2019s the only one who can feed him.\u201d She yawned briefly and shook her head, blinking. \u201cJamie\u2019s got the back bedroom here nearly floored; he wants to move up here as soon as it\u2019s ready\u2014give Bree and the baby more room, and, not incidentally, have a little peace and quiet ourselves.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood idea. Ah\u2014speaking of Bree...\u201d</p><p>\u201cMm?\u201d</p><p>No use dragging it out; better say it straight.</p><p>\u201cLook\u2014I\u2019m trying all I can. I love her, and I want to show her that, but\u2014she sheers off. She comes and we talk, and it\u2019s great, but then I go to put an arm around her or kiss her, and suddenly she\u2019s across the room, picking leaves off the floor. Is there something wrong, something I should do?\u201d</p><p>She gave him one of those disconcerting yellow looks of hers; straightforward and ruthless as a hawk.</p><p>\u201cYou were her first, weren\u2019t you? The first man she slept with, I mean.\u201d</p><p>He felt the blood rising his cheeks.</p><p>\u201cI\u2014ah\u2014yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, then. So far her entire experience of what one might call the delights of sex consists of being deflowered\u2014and I don\u2019t care how gentle you were about it, it tends to hurt\u2014being raped two days later, then giving birth. You think this is calculated to make her fall swooning into your arms in anticipation of your reclaiming your marital rights?\u201d</p><p>You asked for it, he thought, and you got it. Right between the eyes. His cheeks burned hotter than they ever had with fever.</p><p>\u201cI never thought of that,\u201d he muttered to the wall.</p><p>\u201cWell, naturally not,\u201d she said, sounding torn between exasperation and amusement. \u201cYou\u2019re a bloody man. That\u2019s why I\u2019m telling you.\u201d</p><p>He took a deep breath, and reluctantly turned back to face her.</p><p>\u201cAnd just what are you telling me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat she\u2019s afraid,\u201d she said. She cocked her head to one side, evaluating him. \u201cThough it\u2019s not you she\u2019s afraid of, by the way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said bluntly. \u201cShe may have convinced herself that she has to know why you came back, but that\u2019s not it\u2014a regiment of blind men could see that. It\u2019s that she\u2019s afraid she won\u2019t be able to\u2014mmphm.\u201d She raised one brow at him, encompassing a wealth of indelicate suggestion.</p><p>\u201cI see,\u201d he said, taking a deep breath. \u201cAnd just what do you suggest I do about it?\u201d</p><p>She picked up her basket and put it over her arm.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d she said, giving him another yellow look. \u201cBut I think you should be careful.\u201d</p><p>He had just about recovered his equanimity after this unsettling consultation, when another visitor darkened his door. Jamie Fraser, bearing gifts.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve brought ye a razor,\u201d Fraser said, looking critically at him. \u201cAnd some hot water.\u201d</p><p>Claire had clipped his beard short with her surgical scissors a few days earlier, but he had felt too shaky then to attempt shaving with what was called a \u201ccutthroat\u201d razor for good reason. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>Fraser had brought a small looking glass and a pot of shaving soap as well. Very thoughtful. He could have wished that Fraser might have left him alone, rather than leaning against the doorframe, lending a critical eye to the proceedings, but under the circumstances Roger could scarcely ask him to leave.</p><p>Even with the unwelcome spectator, it was a sublime relief to get rid of the beard. It itched like a fiend, and he hadn\u2019t seen his own face in months.</p><p>\u201cWork going well?\u201d He tried for a bit of polite conversation, rinsing the blade between strokes. \u201cI heard you hammering in the back this morning.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, aye.\u201d Fraser\u2019s eyes followed his every move with interest\u2014sizing him up, he thought. \u201cI\u2019ve got the floor laid, and a bit of roof on. Claire and I will sleep up here tonight, I think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d Roger stretched his neck, negotiating the turn of his jaw. \u201cClaire\u2019s told me I can walk again; let me know which chores I can take over.\u201d</p><p>Jamie nodded, arms crossed.</p><p>\u201cAre ye handy wi\u2019 tools?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHaven\u2019t done a lot of building,\u201d Roger admitted. A birdhouse done in school didn\u2019t count, he suspected.</p> <p>\u201cI dinna suppose you\u2019ll be much hand wi\u2019 a plow, or a farrowing hog?\u201d There was a definite glimmer of amusement in Fraser\u2019s eyes.</p><p>Roger lifted his chin, clearing the last of the stubble from his neck. He\u2019d thought about it, the last few days. Not much call for the skills of either a historian or a folk singer, on an eighteenth-century hill farm.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said evenly, putting down the razor. \u201cNor do I know how to milk a cow, build a chimney, split shingles, drive horses, shoot bears, gut deer, or spit someone with a sword.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo?\u201d Overt amusement.</p><p>Roger splashed water on his face and toweled it dry, then turned to face Fraser.</p><p>\u201cNo. What I\u2019ve got is a strong back. That do you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, aye. Couldna ask better, could I?\u201d One side of Fraser\u2019s mouth curled up. \u201cKnow one end of a shovel from the other, do ye?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat much I know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen ye\u2019ll do fine.\u201d Fraser shoved himself away from the doorframe. \u201cClaire\u2019s garden needs spading, there\u2019s barley to be turned at the still, and there\u2019s an almighty heap of manure waitin\u2019 in the stable. After that, I\u2019ll show ye how to milk a cow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d He wiped the razor, put it back in the bag, and handed the lot over.</p><p>\u201cClaire and I are going to Fergus\u2019s place the eve,\u201d Fraser said casually, accepting it. \u201cTakin\u2019 the wee maid to help Marsali for a bit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh? Well...enjoy yourselves.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I expect we will.\u201d Fraser paused in the doorway. \u201cBrianna thought she\u2019d stay; the bairn\u2019s settled a bit, and she doesna want to upset him wi\u2019 the walk.\u201d</p><p>Roger stared hard at the other man. You could read anything\u2014or nothing\u2014in those slanted blue eyes.</p> <p>\u201cOh, aye?\u201d he said. \u201cSo you\u2019re telling me they\u2019ll be alone? I\u2019ll keep an eye on them, then.\u201d</p><p>One ruddy brow lifted an inch.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure ye will.\u201d Fraser\u2019s hand reached out and opened over the empty basin. There was a small metallic clink and a red spark glowed against the pewter. \u201cYe\u2019ll mind I told ye, MacKenzie\u2014my daughter doesna need a coward.\u201d</p><p>Before he could reply, the brow dropped, and Fraser gave him a level blue look.</p><p>\u201cYe\u2019ve cost me a lad I loved, and I\u2019m no inclined to like ye for it.\u201d He glanced down at Roger\u2019s foot, then up. \u201cBut I\u2019ve maybe cost ye more than that. I\u2019ll call the score settled\u2014or not\u2014at your word.\u201d</p><p>Astonished, Roger nodded, then found his voice.</p><p>\u201cDone.\u201d</p><p>Fraser nodded, and disappeared as quickly as he\u2019d come, leaving Roger staring at the empty doorway.</p><p>He lifted the latch and pushed gently on the cabin\u2019s door. It was bolted. So much for the notion of waking Sleeping Beauty with a kiss. He lifted a fist to knock, then stopped. Wrong her**ne. Sleeping Beauty hadn\u2019t had an irascible dwarf in bed with her, ready to yell the house down at any disturbance.</p><p>He circled the small cabin, checking the windows, names like Sneezy and Grumpy drifting through the back of his mind. What would they call this one? Noisy? Smelly?</p><p>The house was snug as a drum, oiled skins nailed over the windows. He could punch one loose, but the last thing he wanted was to scare her by breaking in on her.</p><p>Slowly, he circled the house once more. The sensible thing was to go back to the surgery and wait till morning. He could talk to her then. Better than waking her out of a sound sleep, waking the kid.</p><p>Yes, that was plainly the thing to do. Claire would take the little bas\u2014the baby, if he asked her. They could talk calmly, without fear of interruption, walk in the wood, get things settled between them. Right. That was it, then.</p><p>Ten minutes later he had circled the house twice more, and was standing in the grass at the back, looking at the faint glow of the window.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell do you think you are?\u201d he muttered to himself. \u201cA bloody moth?\u201d</p><p>The creak of boards prevented his answering himself. He shot around the end of the house in time to see a white-gowned figure float ghostlike down the path toward the privy.</p><p>\u201cBrianna?\u201d</p><p>The figure whirled, with a small yelp of fright.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s me,\u201d he said, and saw the dark blotch of her hand press against the white of her nightdress, over her heart.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter with you, sneaking up on me like that?\u201d she demanded furiously.</p><p>\u201cI want to talk to you.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t answer, but whipped round and made off down the path.</p><p>\u201cI said, I want to talk to you,\u201d he repeated more loudly, following.</p><p>\u201cI want to go to the bathroom,\u201d she said. \u201cGo away.\u201d She shut the door of the privy with a decisive slam.</p><p>He retreated a short distance up the path and waited for her to emerge. Her step slowed when she saw him, but there was no way around him without stepping into the long, wet grass.</p><p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t be up walking on that foot,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cThe foot\u2019s fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you should go back to bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d he said, and moved solidly into the center of the path in front of her. \u201cWhere?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere?\u201d She froze, but made no pretense of not understanding.</p><p>\u201cUp there?\u201d He jerked a thumb at the ridge. \u201cOr here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014ah\u2014\u201d</p><p>Be careful, her mother said, and my daughter doesna need a coward, said her father. He could flip a bloody coin, but for the moment he was taking Jamie Fraser\u2019s advice, and damn the torpedoes.</p><p>\u201cYou said you\u2019d seen a marriage of obligation and one of love. And do you think the one cuts out the other? Look\u2014I spent three days in that godforsaken circle, thinking. And by God, I thought. I thought of staying, and I thought of going. And I stayed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo far. You don\u2019t know what you\u2019d be giving up, if you stay for good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do! And even if I did not, I know bloody well what I\u2019d be giving up by going.\u201d He gripped her shoulder, the light gauze of her shift coarse under his hand. She was very warm.</p><p>\u201cI could not go, and live with myself, thinking I\u2019d left behind a child who might be mine\u2014who is mine.\u201d His voice dropped a little. \u201cAnd I could not go, and live without you.\u201d</p><p>She hesitated, drawing back, trying to escape his hand.</p><p>\u201cMy father\u2014my fathers\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook, I\u2019m neither one of your bloody fathers! Give me credit for my own sins, at least!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t committed any sins,\u201d she said, her voice sounding choked.</p><p>\u201cNo, and neither have you.\u201d</p><p>She looked up at him, and he caught the gleam of a dark, slanted eye.</p><p>\u201cIf I hadn\u2019t\u2014\u201d she began.</p><p>\u201cAnd if I hadn\u2019t,\u201d he interrupted roughly. \u201cDrop it, aye? It doesn\u2019t matter what you\u2019ve done\u2014or I. I said I was neither of your fathers, and I meant it. But there they are, the two of them, and you know them well\u2014far better than I.</p><p>\u201cDid Frank Randall not love you as his own? Take you as the child of his heart, knowing you were the blood of another man, and one he\u2019d good reason to hate?\u201d</p><p>He took her other shoulder and gave her a little shake.</p><p>\u201cDid that redheaded bastard not love your mother more than life? And love you enough to sacrifice even that love to save you?\u201d</p><p>She made a small, choked noise, and a pang went through him at the sound, but he would not release her.</p><p>\u201cIf you believe it of them,\u201d he said, his voice little more than a whisper, \u201cthen by God you must believe it of me. For I am a man like them, and by all I hold holy, I do love you.\u201d</p><p>Slowly her head rose, and her breath was warm on his face.</p><p>\u201cWe have time,\u201d he said softly, and knew suddenly why it had been so important to talk to her now, here in the dark. He reached for her hand, clasped it flat against his breast.</p><p>\u201cDo you feel it? Do you feel my heart beat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she whispered, and slowly brought their linked hands to her own breast, pressing his palm against the thin white gauze.</p><p>\u201cThis is our time,\u201d he said. \u201cUntil that shall stop\u2014for one of us, for both\u2014it is our time. Now. Will ye waste it, Brianna, because you are afraid?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said, and her voice was thick, but clear. \u201cI won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>There was a sudden thin wail from the house, and a surprising gush of moist heat against his palm.</p><p>\u201cI have to go,\u201d she said, pulling away. She took two steps, then turned. \u201cCome in,\u201d she said, and ran up the path in front of him, fleet and white as the ghost of a deer.</p><p>By the time he reached the door, she had already fetched the baby from his cradle. She had been in bed; the quilt was thrown back and the hollow of her body was printed on the feather bed. Looking self-conscious, she sidled past him and lay down.</p><p>\u201cI usually feed him in bed at night. He stays asleep longer if he\u2019s next to me.\u201d</p><p>Roger made some murmur of assent, and drew up the low nursing chair before the fire. It was very warm in the room, and the air was thick with smells of cooking, used diapers\u2014and Brianna. Her scent was slightly different these days; the tang of wild grass tempered with a light, sweet smell that he thought must be milk.</p><p>Her head was bent, loose red hair falling over her shoulders in a cascade of sparks and shadows. The front of her gown was open to her waist, and the full round curve of one breast showed plainly, only the nipple obscured by the roundness of the baby\u2019s head. There was a faint sound of sucking.</p><p>As though feeling his eyes on her, she raised her head.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he said softly, not to disturb the baby. \u201cI cannot pretend not to be looking.\u201d</p><p>He couldn\u2019t tell if she flushed; the fire cast a red glow over face and br**sts alike. She glanced down, though, as if she was embarrassed. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cGo ahead,\u201d she said. \u201cNothing much worth looking at.\u201d</p><p>Without a word, he stood up and began to undress.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Her voice was low, but shocked.</p><p>\u201cNot fair for me to sit here gawking at you, is it? It\u2019s much less worth looking at, I expect, but...\u201d He paused, frowning at a knot in the lacing of his breeches. \u201cBut at least you\u2019ll not feel you\u2019re on display.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh.\u201d He didn\u2019t look up to see, but he thought that had made her smile. He\u2019d got his shirt off; the fire felt good on his bare back. Feeling unspeakably self-conscious, he stood up and eased his breeches halfway down before stopping.</p><p>\u201cIs this a striptease?\u201d Brianna\u2019s mouth quivered as she tried to keep from laughing out loud, joggling the baby.</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t decide whether to turn my back or not.\u201d He paused. \u201cHave you got a preference?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTurn your back,\u201d she said softly. \u201cFor now.\u201d</p><p>He did, and got the breeches off without falling into the fire.</p> <p>\u201cStay that way for a minute,\u201d she said. \u201cPlease. I like to look at you.\u201d</p><p>He straightened up and stood still, looking into the fire. The heat played over him, uncomfortably warm, and he took a step back, a sudden memory of Father Alexandre vivid in his mind. Christ, and why would he think of that now?</p><p>\u201cYou have marks on your back, Roger,\u201d Brianna said, her voice softer than ever. \u201cWho hurt you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Indians. It doesn\u2019t matter. Not now.\u201d He hadn\u2019t bound or cut his hair; it fell over his shoulders, tickling the bare skin of his back. He could imagine the tickle of her eyes, going lower, over back and arse and thighs and calves.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to turn around now. All right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t be shocked,\u201d she assured him. \u201cI\u2019ve seen pictures.\u201d</p> <p>She had her father\u2019s trick of hiding her expressions when she wanted to. He couldn\u2019t tell a thing from the soft, wide mouth or the slanted cat-eyes. Was she shocked, frightened, amused? Why ought she to be any of those things? She had touched everything she was now looking at; had caressed and handled him with such intimacy that he had lost himself in her hands, yielded himself to her without reservation\u2014and she to him.</p><p>But that had been a lifetime ago, in the freedom and frenzy of hot darkness. Now he stood before her for the first time nak*d in the light, and she sat there watching him with a baby in her arms. Which of them had changed more, since their wedding night?</p><p>She looked at him carefully, head on one side, then smiled, her eyes rising to meet his. She sat up, shifting the child easily to the other breast, leaving her gown open, the one breast bared.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t stand there any longer; the fire was singeing the hair on his arse. He moved to the side of the hearth and sat down again, watching her.</p><p>\u201cWhat does that feel like?\u201d he asked, partly from a need to break the silence before it got too heavy, partly from a deep curiosity.</p><p>\u201cIt feels good,\u201d she answered softly, head bent over the child. \u201cSort of a pulling. It tingles. When he starts to feed, something happens, and there\u2019s a rushing feeling, like everything in me is surging toward him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not\u2014you don\u2019t feel drained? I should have thought it would feel like your substance being taken, somehow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no, not like that at all. Here, look.\u201d She put a finger in the infant\u2019s mouth and detached it with a soft pop! She lowered the small body for an instant, and Roger saw the nipple drawn up taut, milk jetting out in a thin stream of incredible force. Before the child could start to wail, she put him back, but not before Roger had felt the spray of tiny droplets, warm and then suddenly cool against the skin of his chest.</p> <p>\u201cMy God,\u201d he said, half shocked. \u201cI didn\u2019t know it did that! It\u2019s like a squirt gun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeither did I.\u201d She smiled again, her hand cupping the tiny head. Then the smile faded. \u201cThere are lots of things I couldn\u2019t have imagined before they happened to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBree.\u201d He sat forward, forgetting his nak*dness in the need to touch her. \u201cBree, I know you\u2019re scared. So am I. I don\u2019t want you to be afraid of me\u2014but Bree, I do want ye so.\u201d</p><p>His hand rested on the round of her knee. After a moment, her free hand came down on his, light as a landing bird.</p><p>\u201cI want you, too,\u201d she whispered. They sat frozen together for what seemed a long time; he had no notion what to do next, only that he must not go too fast, not frighten her. Be careful.</p><p>The tiny sucking sounds had ceased and the bundle had gone limp and heavy in the curve of her arm.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s asleep,\u201d she whispered. Moving as cautiously as one holding a vial of nitroglycerine, she scooted to the edge of the bed and stood up.</p><p>She might have meant to lay the child in its cradle, but Roger lifted his hands instinctively. She hesitated for no more than a second, then bent to lay the child in his arms. Her br**sts hung full and heavy in the shadow of her open gown, and he smelled the deep musk of her body as she brushed him.</p><p>The baby was surprisingly heavy; dense, for the size of the bundle. He was amazingly warm, too; warmer even than his mother\u2019s body.</p><p>Roger boosted the tiny body cautiously, cuddling it against him; the small, curved buttocks fit in the palm of his hand. It\u2014he\u2014wasn\u2019t quite bald, after all. There was a soft red-blond fuzz all over the head. Tiny ears. Almost transparent; the one he could see was red and crumpled from being pressed against his mother\u2019s arm.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t tell by looking.\u201d Brianna\u2019s voice jerked him out of his contemplation. \u201cI\u2019ve tried.\u201d She was standing across the room, one drawer of the sideboard open. He thought it might be regret on her face, but the shadows were too deep to tell.</p><p>\u201cThat wasn\u2019t what I was looking for.\u201d He lowered the baby carefully to his lap. \u201cIt\u2019s only\u2014this is the first time I\u2019ve had a proper look at my son.\u201d The words sounded peculiar, stiff to his tongue. She relaxed a little, though.</p><p>\u201cOh. Well, he\u2019s all there.\u201d There was a small note of pride in her voice that caught at his heart, and made him look closer. The little fists were curled up tight as snail shells; he picked one up and gently stroked it with his thumb. Slowly as an octopus moving, the hand opened, enough for him to insert the tip of his index finger. The fist closed again in reflex, astonishing in the strength of its grip.</p><p>He could hear a rhythmic whish across the room, and realized that she was brushing her hair. He would have liked to watch her, but was too fascinated to look up.</p><p>The body had feet like a frog\u2019s; wide at the toes, narrow at the heel. Roger stroked one with a fingertip, and smiled as the tiny toes sprang wide apart. Not webbed, at least.</p><p>My son, he thought, and wasn\u2019t sure what he felt at the thought. It would take time to get used to.</p><p>But he could be, came the next thought. Not just Brianna\u2019s child, to be loved for her sake\u2014but his own flesh and blood. That thought was even more foreign. He tried to push it from his mind, but it kept coming back. That coupling in the dark, that bittersweet mix of pain and joy\u2014had he started this, in the midst of that?</p><p>He hadn\u2019t meant to\u2014but he hoped like hell he had.</p><p>The child was wearing some long thing made of white gauzy stuff; he lifted it, looking at the sagging diaper and the perfect oval of the tiny navel just above. Moved by a curiosity he didn\u2019t think to question, he hooked a finger in the edge of the clout and pulled it down.</p><p>\u201cI told you he was all there.\u201d Brianna was standing at his elbow.</p><p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s there,\u201d Roger said dubiously. \u201cBut isn\u2019t it a bit...small?\u201d</p><p>She laughed.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll grow,\u201d she assured him. \u201cIt\u2019s not like he needs it for much yet.\u201d</p><p>His own penis, gone flaccid between his thighs, gave a small twitch at that reminder.</p><p>\u201cShall I take him?\u201d She reached for the baby, but he shook his head and picked up the child again.</p><p>\u201cNot just yet.\u201d It\u2014he\u2014smelled of milk and something sweetly putrid. Something else, his own indefinable smell, like nothing else Roger had ever encountered.</p><p>\u201cEau de baby, Mama calls it.\u201d She sat on the bed, a faint smile on her face. \u201cShe says it\u2019s a natural protective device; one of the things babies use to keep their parents from killing them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKilling him? But he\u2019s a sweet wee lad,\u201d Roger protested.</p><p>One eyebrow quirked up in derision.</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t been living with the little fiend for the last month. This is the first night he hasn\u2019t had colic in three weeks. I would have exposed him on a hillside if he wasn\u2019t mine.\u201d</p><p>If he wasn\u2019t mine. That certainty was a mother\u2019s reward, he supposed. She\u2019d always know\u2014had always known. For a brief, surprising moment, he envied her.</p><p>The baby stirred and made a small, faint yawp! noise against his neck. Before he could move, she was up and had the child back in her arms, patting the rounded little back. There was a soft belch, and he subsided into limpness once more.</p><p>Brianna set him on his stomach in the cradle, carefully, as if he were wired to a stick of dyn**ite. He could see the faint outline of her body through the gauze, highlighted by the fire behind her. When she turned around, he was ready.</p><p>\u201cYou could have gone back, once you knew. There would have been time.\u201d He held her eyes, not letting her look away. \u201cSo it\u2019s my turn to ask, then, isn\u2019t it? What made you wait for me? Love\u2014or obligation?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBoth,\u201d she said, her eyes nearly black. \u201cNeither. I\u2014just couldn\u2019t go without you.\u201d</p><p>He breathed deeply, feeling the last small doubt in the pit of his stomach melt away.</p><p>\u201cThen you do know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d She lifted her shoulders and let them fall, and the loose gown fell too, leaving her as nak*d as he was. It was red, by God. More than red; she was gold and amber, ivory and cinnabar, and he wanted her with a longing that went beyond flesh.</p><p>\u201cYou said that you loved me, by all you hold holy,\u201d she whispered. \u201cWhat is it that\u2019s holy to you, Roger?\u201d</p><p>He stood and reached for her, gently, carefully. Held her against his heart, and remembered the stinking hold of the Gloriana and a thin, ragged woman who smelled of milk and ordure. Of fire and drums and blood, and an orphan baptized with the name of the father who had sacrificed himself for fear of the power of love.</p><p>\u201cYou,\u201d he said, against her hair. \u201cHim. Us. There isn\u2019t anything else, is there?\u201d</p><p>68</p><p>DOMESTIC BLISS</p><p>August 1770</p><p>It was a peaceful morning. The baby had slept all night, for which feat he was the recipient of general praise. Two hens had obligingly laid eggs in their coop rather than scattering them round the landscape, so I was not required to crawl through the blackberry bushes in search of breakfast before cooking it.</p><p>The bread had risen to a perfect snowy mound in its bowl, been molded into loaves by Lizzie, and\u2014the new Dutch oven sharing the general mood of cooperation\u2014had been baked into a delicate brown fragrance that suffused the house with contentment. Spiced ham and turkey hash sizzled pleasantly on the griddle, adding their aromas to the softer morning scents of damp grass and summer flowers that came through the open window. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>These things all helped, but the general atmosphere of drowsy well-being owed more to the night before than to the events of the morning.</p><p>It had been a perfect moon-drenched night. Jamie had put out the candle and gone to bolt the door, but instead he stood, arms braced on the doorframe, looking down the valley.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d he said softly. \u201cCome and see.\u201d</p> <p>Everything seemed to be floating, deprived of depth by the eerie light. Far off, the spurt of the falls seemed frozen, suspended in air. The wind was toward us, though, and I could hear the faint rumble of tons of falling water.</p><p>The night air was scented with grass and water, and the breath of pine and spruce blew down cool from the mountaintops. I shivered in my shift, and drew closer to him for warmth. His shirttails were split at the side, open nearly to his waist. I slid my hand inside the opening nearest me, and cupped one round, warm buttock. The muscles tensed under my grip, then flexed as he turned.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t pulled away; only stepped back in order to yank the shirt off over his head. He stood on the porch nak*d, and held out a hand to me.</p><p>He was furred with silver and the moonlight carved his body from the night. I could see every small detail of him, long toes to flowing hair, clear as the clean black canes of the blackberry bushes at the bottom of the yard. Yet like them he was dimensionless; he might have been within hand\u2019s touch or a mile away.</p><p>I shrugged the shift from my shoulders and let it fall from my body, left it puddled by the door and took his hand. Without a word we had floated through the grass, walked wet-legged and cool-skinned into the forest, turned wordless toward each other\u2019s warmth and stepped together into the empty air beyond the ridge.</p> <p>We had wakened in the dark after moonset, leaf-spattered, twig-strewn, bug-bitten, and stiff with cold. We had said not a word to each other, but laughing and staggering drunkenly, stumbling over roots and stones, had helped each other through the moonless wood and made our way back to bed for an hour\u2019s brief sleep before dawn.</p><p>I leaned over his shoulder now and deposited a bowl of oatmeal in front of him, pausing to pluck an oak leaf from his hair. I laid it on the table beside his bowl.</p><p>He turned his head, a smile hiding in his eyes, caught my hand and kissed it lightly. He let me go, and went back to his parritch. I touched the back of his neck, and saw the smile spread to his mouth.</p><p>I looked up, smiling myself, and found Brianna watching. One corner of her mouth turned up, and her eyes were warm with understanding. Then I saw her gaze shift to Roger, who was spooning in his parritch in a absentminded sort of way, his gaze intent on her.</p><p>This picture of domestic bliss was broken by the stentorian tones of Clarence, announcing a visitor. I missed Rollo, I reflected, going to the door to see, but at least Clarence didn\u2019t leap on visitors and knock them flat or chase them round the dooryard.</p><p>The visitor was Duncan Innes, who had come bearing an invitation.</p> <p>\u201cYour aunt asks if perhaps ye will be coming to the Gathering at Mount Helicon this autumn. She says ye did give her your word, twa year past.\u201d</p><p>Jamie shoved the platter of eggs in front of Duncan.</p><p>\u201cI hadna thought of it,\u201d he said, frowning a little. \u201cThere\u2019s the devil of a lot to do, and I\u2019m to have a roof on this place before snowfall.\u201d He gestured upward with his chin, indicating the slats and branches that were temporarily shielding us from the vagaries of weather.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a priest coming, down from Baltimore,\u201d Duncan said, carefully avoiding looking at Roger or Brianna. \u201cMiss Jo did think as how ye might be wishing to have the wean baptized.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Jamie sat back, lips pursed in thought. \u201cAye, that\u2019s a thought. Perhaps we will go, then, Duncan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s fine; your auntie will be pleased.\u201d Something appeared to be caught in Duncan\u2019s throat; he was turning slowly red as I watched. Jamie squinted at him and pushed a jug of cider in his direction.</p><p>\u201cYe\u2019ve something in your throat, man?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh...no.\u201d Everyone had stopped eating by now, viewing the changes to Duncan\u2019s complexion in fascination. He had gone a sort of puce by the time he managed to squeeze out the next words.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2014errr\u2014wish to ask your consent, an fhearr Mac Dubh, to the marriage of Mistress Jocasta Cameron and...and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd who?\u201d Jamie asked, the corner of his mouth twitching. \u201cThe governor of the colony?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd myself?\u201d Duncan seized the cup of cider and buried his face in it with the relief of a drowning man seeing a life raft float past.</p><p>Jamie burst out laughing, which seemed to be no great solace to Duncan\u2019s embarrassment.</p><p>\u201cMy consent? D\u2019ye not think my aunt\u2019s of an age, Duncan? Or you, come to that?\u201d</p><p>Duncan was breathing a little easier now, though the purple tinge hadn\u2019t yet begun to fade from his cheeks.</p><p>\u201cI thought it only proper,\u201d he said, a little stiffly. \u201cSeeing as how ye\u2019re her nearest kinsman.\u201d He swallowed, and unbent a bit. \u201cAnd...it didna seem entirely right, Mac Dubh, that I should be takin\u2019 what might be yours.\u201d</p><p>Jamie smiled and shook his head.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve no claim on any of my aunt\u2019s property, Duncan\u2014and wouldna take it when she offered. You\u2019ll be married at the Gathering? Tell her we\u2019ll come, then, and dance at the wedding.\u201d</p><p>69</p><p>JEREMIAH</p><p>October 1770</p><p>Roger rode with Claire and Fergus, close to the wagon. Jamie, not trusting Brianna to drive a vehicle containing his grandson, insisted on driving, with Lizzie and Marsali in the wagon bed and Brianna on the seat beside him.</p><p>From his saddle Roger caught snatches of the discussion that had been going on ever since his arrival.</p><p>\u201cJohn, for sure,\u201d Brianna was saying, frowning down at her son, who was burrowing energetically under her shawl. \u201cBut I don\u2019t know if it should be his first name. And if it was\u2014should it maybe be Ian? That\u2019s \u2018John\u2019 in Gaelic\u2014and I\u2019d like to name him that, but would it be too confusing, with Uncle Ian and our Ian, too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSince neither one of them is here, I think it wouldna be too troublesome,\u201d Marsali put in. She glanced up at her stepfather\u2019s back. \u201cDid ye not say ye wanted to use one of Da\u2019s names, as well?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but which one?\u201d Brianna twisted around to talk to Marsali. \u201cNot James, that would be confusing. And I don\u2019t think I like Malcolm much. He\u2019ll already have MacKenzie, of course, so maybe\u2014\u201d She caught Roger\u2019s eye and smiled up at him.</p><p>\u201cWhat about Jeremiah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJohn Jeremiah Alexander Fraser MacKenzie?\u201d Marsali frowned, saying the names over to taste them.</p><p>\u201cI rather like Jeremiah,\u201d Claire chipped in. \u201cVery Old Testament. It\u2019s one of your names, isn\u2019t it, Roger?\u201d She smiled at him and drew closer to the wagon, leaning over to talk to Brianna.</p><p>\u201cBesides, if Jeremiah seems too formal, you can call him Jemmy,\u201d she said. \u201cOr is that too much like Jamie?\u201d</p><p>Roger felt a small chill prickle down his spine, at the sudden recollection of another child whose mother had called him Jemmy\u2014a child whose father was fair-haired, with eyes as green as Roger\u2019s own.</p><p>He waited until Brianna had turned to rummage through her bag for a fresh diaper, handing the fussing baby to Lizzie to mind. He kneed his horse, urging it up close to Claire\u2019s mare.</p><p>\u201cDo you recall something?\u201d he asked in a low voice. \u201cWhen you first came to call on me in Inverness, with Brianna\u2014you\u2019d had my genealogy researched beforehand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d She quirked a brow at him.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been some time, and you likely wouldn\u2019t have noticed in any case...\u201d He hesitated, but he had to know, if it could be known. \u201cYou pointed out the place on my family tree where the substitution was made; where Geilie Duncan\u2019s child by Dougal was adopted in place of another child who\u2019d died, and given his name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWilliam Buccleigh MacKenzie,\u201d she said promptly, and smiled at his look of surprise. \u201cI went over that genealogy at some length,\u201d she said dryly. \u201cI could probably tell you every name on it.\u201d</p><p>He took a deep breath, uneasiness curling at the back of his neck.</p><p>\u201cCan you? What I\u2019m wondering\u2014do you know the name of the changeling\u2019s wife\u2014my six-times great-grandmother? Her name wasn\u2019t listed on my own family tree; only William Buccleigh.\u201d</p><p>Soft lashes dropped over the golden eyes as she thought, lips pursed.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said at last, and looked at him. \u201cMorag. Her name was Morag Gunn. Why?\u201d</p><p>He only shook his head, too shaken to reply. He glanced at Brianna; the baby lay half nak*d in her lap, the soggy diaper in a heap on the seat beside her\u2014and remembered the smooth damp skin and soggy clout of the little boy named Jemmy.</p><p>\u201cAnd their son\u2019s name was Jeremiah,\u201d he said at last, so softly that Claire had to lean close to hear it.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d She watched him curiously, then turned her head to look down the twisting road ahead, disappearing between the dark pines.</p><p>\u201cI asked Geilie,\u201d Claire said suddenly. \u201cI asked her why. Why we can do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd did she have an answer?\u201d Roger stared at a deerfly on his wrist without seeing it.</p><p>\u201cShe said\u2014\u2018To change things.\u2019 \u201d Claire smiled at him, her mouth curled wryly. \u201cI don\u2019t know whether that\u2019s an answer or not.\u201d</p><p>70</p><p>THE GATHERING</p><p>It had been nearly thirty years since the last Gathering I had seen; the Gathering at Leoch, and the oath-taking of clan MacKenzie. Colum MacKenzie was dead now, and his brother Dougal\u2014and all the clans with them. Leoch lay in ruins, and there would be no more Gatherings of the clans in Scotland.</p><p>Yet here were the plaids and the pipes, and the remnants of the Highlanders themselves, undiminished in fierce pride, among the the new mountains they claimed for their own. MacNeills and Campbells, Buchanans and Lindseys, MacLeods and MacDonalds; families, slaves and servants, indentured men and lairds.</p><p>I looked out over the stir and bustle of the dozens of encampments to see if I could find Jamie, and spotted instead a familiar tall form, striding loose-jointed through the scattered throng. I stood up and waved, calling out to him.</p><p>\u201cMyers! Mr. Myers!\u201d</p><p>John Quincy Myers spotted me and, beaming, made his way up the slope to our encampment.</p><p>\u201cMrs. Claire!\u201d he exclaimed, sweeping off his disreputable hat and bowing over my hand with his usual courtliness. \u201cI\u2019m right uplifted to see ye.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe feeling is mutual,\u201d I assured him, smiling. \u201cI didn\u2019t expect to see you here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I usually reckon to come to a Gathering,\u201d he said, straightening up and beaming down at me. \u201cIf I\u2019m down from the mountains in time. Fine place to sell my hides; any little bits of things I have to get rid of. Speakin\u2019 of which...\u201d He began a slow, methodical rummage through the contents of his big buckskin pouch.</p><p>\u201cWill you have been far to the north, Mr. Myers?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOh, \u2019deed I have, \u2019deed I have, Mrs. Claire. Halfway up the Mohawk River, to the place they call the Upper Castle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Mohawk?\u201d My heart began to beat faster.</p><p>\u201cMm.\u201d He withdrew something from his bag, squinted at it, put it back, and rummaged further. \u201cImagine my surprise, Mrs. Claire, when I stopped at a Mohawk village to the south, to see a familiar face.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIan! You\u2019ve seen Ian? Is he all right?\u201d I was so excited, I grasped him by the arm.</p> <p>\u201cOh, aye,\u201d he assured me. \u201cFine-lookin\u2019 boy\u2014though I will say it did give me a right turn to see him rigged out like a brave, and his face burnt dark enough that I might ha\u2019 taken him for one, did he not hail me by name.\u201d</p><p>At last he found what he was looking for, and handed me a small package wrapped in thin leather and tied with a strip of buckskin\u2014a woodpecker\u2019s feather thrust through the knot.</p><p>\u201cHe trusted me with that, ma\u2019am, to bring to you and your goodman.\u201d He smiled kindly. \u201cReckon as you\u2019ll want to read that right promptly; I\u2019ll meet up with ye a mite later, Mrs. Claire.\u201d He bowed with solemn formality, and walked away, hailing acquaintances as he passed.</p><p>I wouldn\u2019t read it without waiting for Jamie; luckily, he appeared no more than a few minutes later. The letter was written on what seemed to be the torn-out flyleaf of a book, its ink the pale brown of oak-galls, but legible enough. Ian salutat avunculus Jacobus, the note began, and a grin broke out on Jamie\u2019s face.</p><p>Ave! That exhausting my Remembrance of the Latin tongue, I must now lapse into Plain English, of which I recall much more. I am well, Uncle, and Happy\u2014I ask you to believe it. I have been married, after the custom of the Mohawk, and live in the house of my Wife. You will remember Emily, who carves so cleverly. Rollo has sired a Great many puppies; the village is littered with small wolfish Replicas. I cannot hope to claim the same profligacy of Procreation\u2014yet I hope you will write to my Mother with the wish that she has not yet so many Grandchildren that she will overlook the addition of one more. The birth will be in spring; I will send Word of its outcome so soon as I may. In the meantime, you will oblige me by Remembering me to all at Lallybroch, at River Run, and Fraser\u2019s Ridge. I remember them all most Fondly, and will, so long as I shall live. My love to Auntie Claire, to Cousin Brianna, and most of all to yourself. Your most affectionate nephew, Ian Murray. Vale, avunculus.</p> <p>Jamie blinked once or twice, and folding the torn page carefully, tucked it in his sporran.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s avuncule, ye wee idiot,\u201d he said softly. \u201cA greeting takes the vocative case.\u201d</p><p>Looking over the dotted campfires that evening, I would have said that every Scottish family between Philadelphia and Charleston had come\u2014and yet more arrived with the dawn next day, and kept coming.</p><p>It was on the second day, while Lizzie, Brianna, and I were comparing babies with two of Farquard Campbell\u2019s daughters, that Jamie made his way through a mass of women and children, a wide smile on his face.</p><p>\u201cMrs. Lizzie,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve a wee surprise for ye. Fergus!\u201d</p><p>Fergus, likewise beaming, came from behind a wagon, ushering a slight man with windblown, thin fair hair.</p> <p>\u201cDa!\u201d Lizzie shrieked, and flung herself into his arms. Jamie put a finger in his ear and wiggled it, looking amazed.</p><p>\u201cI dinna think I\u2019ve ever heard her make a noise that loud before,\u201d he said. He grinned at me and handed me two pieces of paper; originally part of one document, they had been carefully torn apart so that the notched edge of one fitted the jagged edge of the other.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019ll be Mr. Wemyss\u2019s indenture,\u201d he said. \u201cPut it away for now, Sassenach; we\u2019ll burn it at the bonfire tonight.\u201d</p><p>Then he vanished back into the crowd, summoned by a wave and a shout of Mac Dubh! from across the clearing.</p><p>By the third day of the Gathering, I had heard so much news, gossip, and general chatter that my ears rang with the sound of Gaelic. Those who were not talking were singing; Roger was in his element, wandering through the grounds and listening. He was hoarse from singing himself; he had been up most of the night before, strumming a borrowed guitar and singing to a crowd of enchanted listeners while Brianna sat curled by his feet, looking smug.</p><p>\u201cIs he any good?\u201d Jamie had murmured to me, squinting dubiously at his putative son-in-law.</p><p>\u201cBetter than good,\u201d I assured him.</p><p>He lifted one eyebrow and shrugged, then leaned down to take the baby from me.</p> <p>\u201cAye, well, I\u2019ll take your word for it. I think wee Ruaidh and I will go and find a game of dice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going gambling with a baby?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d he said, and grinned at me. \u201cHe\u2019s never too young to learn an honest trade, in case he canna sing for his supper like his Da.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen you make bashed neeps,\u201d I said, \u201cbe sure to boil the tops along with the turnips. Then save the pot liquor and give it to the children; you take some too\u2014it\u2019s good for your milk.\u201d</p><p>Maisri Buchanan pressed her smallest child to her breast and nodded solemnly, committing my advice to memory. I could not persuade most of the new immigrants either to eat fresh greens or to feed them to their families, but now and then I found opportunity to introduce a bit of vitamin C surreptitiously into their usual diet\u2014which consisted for the most part of oatmeal and venison.</p><p>I had tried the expedient of making Jamie eat a plate of sliced tomatoes in public view, in hopes that the sight of him would ease some of the new immigrants\u2019 fears. This had not been successful; most of them regarded him with a half-superstitious awe, and I was given to understand that Himself could naturally survive the eating of things that would kill a normal person dead on the spot.</p><p>I dismissed Maisri, and welcomed the next visitor to my impromptu clinic, a woman with two little girls, covered with an eczematous rash that I at first thought evidence of more nutritional deficiency, but which fortunately proved to be only poison ivy.</p><p>I became aware of a stir in the crowd, and paused in my ministrations, turning to see who had arrived. Sunlight glinted from metal near the edge of the clearing, and Jamie\u2019s was not the only hand to go to gun or knife hilt.</p><p>They came into the sun in marchstep, though their drums were muffled, with no more than a soft tap-tap! of stick on rim to guide them. Muskets pointing skyward, broadswords waggling like scorpion tails, they emerged from the grove in small bursts of scarlet, two by two, green kilts aswish around their knees.</p><p>Four, and six, and eight, and ten...I was counting silently, with everyone else. Forty men came on, eyes straight ahead beneath their bearskin caps, looking neither to left nor to right, with no sound but the shuffle of feet and the tap of their drum.</p><p>Across the clearing, I saw MacNeill of Barra rise from his seat and straighten up; there was a subtle stir around him, a few steps bringing his men to stand near him. I didn\u2019t need to look around to sense the same thing happening behind me; felt, rather than saw, the eddies of similar small rallyings around the mountain\u2019s foot, each group with one eye on the intruders, one eye on its chief for direction.</p><p>I looked for Brianna and was startled, if not surprised, to find her just behind me, the baby in her arms, watching intently over my shoulder.</p><p>\u201cWho are they?\u201d she asked, low-voiced, and I could hear the echo of the question running through the Gathering like ripples in water.</p><p>\u201cA Highland regiment,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cI see that,\u201d she said tartly. \u201cFriend or foe?\u201d</p><p>That was plainly the question\u2014were they here as Scots, or as soldiers? But I didn\u2019t have an answer, nor did anyone else, judging from the shiftings and mutterings among the crowd. There were incidents of troops coming to disperse unruly groups, of course. But surely not a peaceable gathering like this, which had no political purpose?</p><p>At one time, though, the mere presence of a number of Scots in one place was a political declaration, and most of those present remembered those times. The murmuring got louder, Gaelic spoken with the muffled sibilance of vehemence, sighing round the mountain like the wind before a storm.</p><p>There were forty soldiers coming up the road with guns and swords. There were two hundred Scotsmen here, most of them armed, many with slaves and servants. But also with their wives and children.</p><p>I thought of the days after Culloden, and without looking round, said to Brianna, \u201cIf anything happens\u2014anything at all\u2014take the baby up into the rocks.\u201d</p><p>Roger appeared suddenly in front of me, his attention focused on the soldiers. He didn\u2019t look at Jamie but moved silently so they stood, shoulder to shoulder, a bulwark before us. All over the clearing, the same thing was happening; the women gave not an inch, but their men stepped out before them. Anyone coming into the clearing would think that the women had melted into invisibility, leaving an implacable phalanx of Scotsmen staring down the glen.</p><p>Then two men rode out from the shelter of the trees; an officer on horseback, his aide by his side, regimental banner flying. Spurring up, they rode past the column of soldiers into the edge of the crowd. I saw the aide lean down from his horse to ask a question, saw the officer\u2019s head turn toward us in acknowledgment of the answer.</p><p>The officer barked an order and the soldiers stood to rest, muskets planted in the dust, their checkered legs apart. The officer turned his horse into the crowd, slowly nosing his way among the throng, who gave way reluctantly before him.</p><p>He was coming toward us; I saw his eyes fix on Jamie from a distance, so conspicuous by his height and his hair, bright as scarlet maple leaves.</p><p>The man drew up before us, and took off his feathered cap. He slid off his horse, took two steps toward Jamie, and bowed, rigidly correct. He was a short man, but solid, maybe thirty, with dark eyes that glittered bright as the gorget at his throat. Closer now, I saw what I had missed before, the smaller bit of metal pinned to the shoulder of his red coat; a battered brooch of tarnished gilt.</p><p>\u201cMa name is Airchie Hayes,\u201d he said in broad Scots. His eyes were fixed on Jamie\u2019s face, dark with hope. \u201cThey say ye kent my faither.\u201d</p><p>71</p><p>CIRCLE\u2019S CLOSE</p><p>I have a thing to say to you,\u201d Roger said. He\u2019d waited for some time to catch Jamie Fraser alone. Fraser was much in demand; everyone wanted his ear for a moment. For this moment, though, he was by himself, sitting on the fallen log from which he held court. He looked up at Roger, brows raised, but nodded toward a seat on the log.</p><p>Roger sat down. He had the baby with him; Brianna and Lizzie were making the dinner, and Claire had gone to visit with the Camerons of Isle Fleur, whose fire was nearby. The night air was thick with the scent of woodsmoke rather than peat fires, but in many ways it might be Scotland, he thought.</p><p>Jamie\u2019s eye lighted on the curve of little Jemmy\u2019s skull, dusted with copper fuzz that shone in the firelight. He held out his arms, and with only the slightest hesitation, Roger carefully passed the sleeping baby to him.</p><p>\u201cBalach Boidheach,\u201d Jamie murmured as the baby stirred against him. \u201cThere now, it\u2019s fine.\u201d He looked across at Roger. \u201cYou\u2019ve a thing to say to me, you said.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Roger nodded.</p><p>\u201cI have, though not on my own account. You might say it is a message to be passed on for someone else.\u201d</p><p>Jamie lifted one quizzical brow, in a gesture so reminiscent of Brianna that Roger felt a small internal start. To cover it, he coughed.</p><p>\u201cI\u2014ah\u2014when Brianna went to the stones on Craigh na Dun, I was forced to wait a few weeks until I could follow after her.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAye?\u201d Jamie looked wary, as he always did at any mention of stone circles.</p><p>\u201cI went to Inverness,\u201d Roger continued, keeping his eyes on his father-in-law. \u201cI stayed at the house that my father had lived in, and I spent part of the time in sorting through his papers; he was a great saver of letters and bits of old rubbish.\u201d</p><p>Jamie nodded, evidently wondering what Roger was on about, but too polite to interrupt him.</p><p>\u201cI found a letter.\u201d Roger took a deep breath, feeling his heart thump in his chest. \u201cI committed it to memory, thinking that if I found Claire, I would tell her of it. But then when I found her\u201d\u2014he shrugged\u2014\u201cI was not sure whether I should tell her or not\u2014or tell Brianna.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you are asking me if you should tell them?\u201d Fraser\u2019s brows rose, thick and ruddy, showing his puzzlement.</p> <p>\u201cPerhaps I am. But thinking on it, it occurred to me that the letter was perhaps of more concern to you than to them.\u201d Now that the moment was at hand, Roger found himself feeling some sympathy for Fraser.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll know my father was a minister? The letter was to him. I suppose it was written under the seal of confession, in a way\u2014but I imagine death has dissolved this particular seal.\u201d</p><p>Roger took a deep breath and closed his eyes, seeing the black letters slanting across the page, in the neat, angular handwriting. He\u2019d read it over more than a hundred times; he was sure of every word.</p><p>Dear Reg (the letter said);</p><p>I\u2019ve something the matter with my heart. Besides Claire, I mean (says he, with irony). The doctor says it might be years yet, with care, and I hope it is\u2014but there\u2019s the odd chance. The nuns at Bree\u2019s school used to scare the kids into fits about the horrible fate in store for sinners who died unconfessed and unforgiven; damned (if you\u2019ll pardon the expression) if I\u2019m afraid of whatever comes after\u2014if anything. But again\u2014there\u2019s the odd chance, isn\u2019t there?</p><p>Not a thing I could say to my parish priest, for obvious reasons. I doubt he\u2019d see the sin in it, even if he didn\u2019t slip out to telephone discreetly for psychiatric help!</p> <p>But you\u2019re a priest, Reg, if not a Catholic\u2014and more importantly, you\u2019re my friend. You needn\u2019t reply to this; I don\u2019t suppose a reply is possible. But you can listen. One of your great gifts, listening. Had I told you that before?</p><p>I\u2019m delaying, though I don\u2019t know why I should. Best have it out.</p><p>You\u2019ll recall the favor I asked you a few years ago\u2014about the gravestones at St. Kilda\u2019s? Kind friend that you are, you never asked, but it\u2019s time I should tell you why.</p><p>God knows why old Black Jack Randall should have been left out there on a Scottish hill instead of taken home to Sussex for burial. Perhaps no one cared enough to bring him home. Sad to think of; I rather hope it wasn\u2019t that.</p><p>There he is, though. If Bree\u2019s ever interested in her history\u2014in my history\u2014she\u2019ll look, and she\u2019ll find him there; the location of his grave is mentioned in the family papers. That\u2019s why I asked you to have the other stone put up nearby. It will stand out\u2014all the other stones in that kirkyard are crumbling away with age.</p><p>Claire will take her to Scotland one day; I\u2019m sure of that much. If she goes to St. Kilda\u2019s, she\u2019ll see it\u2014no one goes into an old churchyard and doesn\u2019t have a browse round the stones. If she wonders, if she cares to look further\u2014if she asks Claire\u2014well, that\u2019s as far as I\u2019m prepared to go. I\u2019ve made the gesture; I shall leave it to chance what happens when I\u2019ve gone.</p><p>You know all the rubbish Claire talked when she came back. I did all I could to get it out of her head, but she wouldn\u2019t be budged; God, she is a stubborn woman!</p><p>You\u2019ll not credit this, perhaps, but when I came last to visit you, I hired a car and went to that damned hill\u2014to Craigh na Dun. I told you about the witches dancing in the circle, just before Claire disappeared. With that eerie sight in mind, standing there in the early light among those stones\u2014I could almost believe her. I touched one. Nothing happened, of course.</p> <p>And yet. I looked. Looked for the man\u2014for Fraser. And perhaps I found him. At least I found a man of that name, and what I could dredge up of his connections matched what Claire told me of him. Whether she was telling the truth, or whether she had grafted some delusion onto real experience...well, there was a man, I\u2019m sure of that!</p><p>You\u2019ll scarcely credit this, but I stood there with my hand on that bloody stone, and wanted nothing more than that it should open, and put me face-to-face with James Fraser. Whoever he was, whenever he was, I wanted nothing more in life than to see him\u2014and to kill him.</p><p>I have never seen him\u2014I don\u2019t know that he existed!\u2014and yet I hate this man as I have never hated anyone else. If what Claire said and what I found was true\u2014then I\u2019ve taken her from him, and kept her by me through these years by a lie. Maybe only a lie of omission, but nonetheless a lie for that. I could call that revenge, I suppose.</p><p>Priests and poets call revenge a two-edged sword; and the other edge of it is that I\u2019ll never know\u2014if I gave her the choice, would she have stayed with me? Or if I told her that her Jamie survived Culloden, would she have been off to Scotland like a shot?</p><p>I cannot think Claire would leave her daughter. I hope she\u2019d not leave me, either...but...if I had any certainty of it, I swear I\u2019d have told her, but I haven\u2019t, and that\u2019s the truth of it.</p><p>Fraser\u2014shall I curse him for stealing my wife, or bless him for giving me my daughter? I think these things, and then I stop, appalled that I should be giving a moment\u2019s credence to such a preposterous theory. And yet...I have the oddest sense of James Fraser, almost a memory, as though I must have seen him somewhere. Though likely this is just the product of jealousy and imagination\u2014I know what the bastard looks like, well enough; I see his face on my daughter, day by day!</p><p>That\u2019s the queer side of it, though\u2014a sense of obligation. Not just to Bree, though I do think she\u2019s a right to know\u2014later. I told you I had a sense of the bastard? Funny thing is, it\u2019s stayed with me. I can almost feel him, sometimes, looking over my shoulder, standing across the room.</p><p>Hadn\u2019t thought of this before\u2014do you suppose I\u2019ll meet him in the sweet by-and-by, if there is one? Funny to think of it. Should we meet as friends, I wonder, with the sins of the flesh behind us? Or end forever locked in some Celtic hell, with our hands wrapped round each other\u2019s throat?</p><p>I treated Claire badly\u2014or well, depending how one looks at it. I won\u2019t go into the sordid details; leave it that I\u2019m sorry.</p><p>So there it is, Reg. Hate, jealousy, lying, stealing, unfaithfulness, the lot. Not much to balance it save love. I do love her\u2014love them. My women. Maybe it\u2019s not the right kind of love, or not enough. But it\u2019s all I\u2019ve got.</p><p>Still, I won\u2019t die unshriven\u2014and I\u2019ll trust you for a conditional absolution. I raised Bree as a Catholic; do you suppose there\u2019s some forlorn hope that she\u2019ll pray for me?</p><p>\u201cIt was signed, \u2018Frank,\u2019 of course,\u201d Roger said.</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Jamie echoed softly. He sat quite still, his face unreadable.</p><p>Roger didn\u2019t need to read it; he knew well enough the thoughts that were going through the other\u2019s mind. The same thoughts he\u2019d wrestled with, during those weeks between Beltane and Midsummer\u2019s Eve, during the search for Brianna across the ocean, during his captivity\u2014and at the last, in the circle in the rhododendron hell, hearing the song of the standing stones.</p><p>If Frank Randall had chosen to keep secret what he\u2019d found, had never placed that stone at St. Kilda\u2019s\u2014would Claire have learned the truth anyway? Perhaps; perhaps not. But it had been the sight of that spurious grave that had led her to tell her daughter the story of Jamie Fraser, and to set Roger on the path of discovery that had led them all to this place, this time.</p><p>It had been the stone that had at once sent Claire back to the arms of her Scottish lover\u2014and possibly to her death in those arms. That had given Frank Randall\u2019s daughter back to her other father, and simultaneously condemned her to live in a time not her own; that had resulted in the birth of a red-haired boy who might otherwise not have been\u2014the continuance of Jamie Fraser\u2019s blood. Interest on the debt owed? Roger wondered.</p><p>And then there were Roger\u2019s private thoughts, of another boy who might not have been, save for that cryptic stone hint, left by Frank Randall for the sake of forgiveness. Morag and William MacKenzie were not at the Gathering; Roger was unsure whether to be disappointed or relieved.</p><p>Jamie Fraser stirred at last, though his eyes stayed fixed on the fire.</p><p>\u201cEnglishman,\u201d he said softly, and it was a conjuration. The hair rose very slightly on the back of Roger\u2019s neck; he could believe he saw something move in the flames.</p><p>Jamie\u2019s big hands spread, cradling his grandson. His face was remote, the flames catching sparks from hair and brows.</p><p>\u201cEnglishman,\u201d he said, speaking to whatever he saw beyond the flames. \u201cI could wish that we shall meet one day. And I could hope that we shall not.\u201d</p><p>Roger waited, hands loose on his knees. Fraser\u2019s eyes were shadowed, his face masked by the flicker of the dancing fire. At last, something like a shudder seemed to go over the big frame; he shook his head as though to clear it, and seemed to realize for the first time that Roger was still there.</p><p>\u201cDo I tell her?\u201d Roger said. \u201cClaire?\u201d</p><p>The big Highlander\u2019s eyes sharpened.</p><p>\u201cWill ye have told Brianna?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet; but I will.\u201d He gave back Fraser\u2019s stare, eye for eye. \u201cShe is my wife.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cForever\u2014if she will.\u201d</p><p>Fraser looked toward the Camerons\u2019 fire. Claire\u2019s lithe shape was visible, dark against the brightness.</p><p>\u201cI did promise her honesty,\u201d he said at last, very quietly. \u201cAye, tell her.\u201d</p><p>By the fourth day, the slopes of the mountain were filled with new arrivals. Just before dusk, the men began to bring wood, piling it in the burnt space at the foot of the mountain. Each family had its campfire, but here was the great fire, around which everyone gathered each night to see who had come during the day.</p><p>As the dark came on, the fires bloomed on the mountainside, dotted here and there among the shallow ledges and sandy pockets. For a moment, I had a vision of the MacKenzie clan badge\u2014a \u201cburning mountain\u201d\u2014and realized suddenly what it was. Not a volcano, as I had thought. No, it was the image of a Gathering like this one, the fires of families burning in the dark, a signal to all the clan was present\u2014and together. And for the first time, I understood the motto that went with the image: Luceo non uro; I shine, not burn. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Soon the mountainside was alive with fires. Here and there were smaller, moving flames, as the head of each family or plantation thrust a brand into his fire and brought it down the hill, to add to the blazing pyre at the foot. From our perch high on the mountainside, the figures of the men showed small and dark in silhouette against the huge fire.</p><p>A dozen families had declared themselves before Jamie finished his conversation with Gerald Forbes, and rose himself. He handed me the baby, who was sleeping soundly in spite of all the racket around him, and bent to light a brand from our fire. The shouts came from far below, thin but audible on the clear autumn air.</p><p>\u201cThe MacNeills of Barra are here!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Lachlans of Glen Linnhe are here!\u201d</p> <p>And after a little, Jamie\u2019s voice, loud and strong on the dark air.</p><p>\u201cThe Frasers of the Ridge are here!\u201d There was a brief spatter of applause from those around me\u2014whoops and yelps from the tenants who had come with us, just as there had been from the followers of the other heads of families.</p><p>I sat quietly, enjoying the feel of the limp, heavy little body in my arms. He slept with the abandonment of total trust, tiny pink mouth half open, his breath warm and humid on the slope of my breast.</p><p>Jamie came back smelling of woodsmoke and whisky, and sat down on the log behind me. He took me by the shoulders and I leaned back against him, enjoying the feeling of him behind me. Across the fire, Brianna and Roger were talking earnestly, their heads close together. Their faces shone in the firelight, each reflecting the other.</p><p>\u201cYe dinna suppose they\u2019re going to change his name again, do you?\u201d Jamie said, frowning slightly at them.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so,\u201d I said. \u201cThere are other things ministers do besides christenings, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, aye?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s well past the third of September,\u201d I said, tilting back my head to look at him. \u201cYou did tell her to choose by then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I did.\u201d A lopsided moon floated low in the sky, shedding a soft light over his face. He leaned forward and kissed my forehead.</p><p>Then he reached down and took my free hand in his own.</p><p>\u201cAnd will ye choose, too?\u201d he asked softly. He opened his hand, and I saw the glint of gold. \u201cDo ye want it back?\u201d</p> <p>I paused, looking up into his face, searching it for doubt. I saw none there, but something else; a waiting, a deep curiosity as to what I might say.</p><p>\u201cIt was a long time ago,\u201d I said softly.</p><p>\u201cAnd a long time,\u201d he said. \u201cI am a jealous man, but not a vengeful one. I would take you from him, my Sassenach\u2014but I wouldna take him from you.\u201d</p><p>He paused for a moment, the fire glinting softly from the ring in his hand. \u201cIt was your life, no?\u201d</p><p>And he asked again, \u201cDo you want it back?\u201d</p><p>I held up my hand in answer and he slid the gold ring on my finger, the metal warm from his body.</p><p>From F. to C. with love. Always.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you say?\u201d I asked. He had murmured something in Gaelic above me, too low for me to catch.</p> <p>\u201cI said, \u2018Go in peace,\u2019 \u201d he answered. \u201cI wasna talking to you, though, Sassenach.\u201d</p><p>Across the fire, something winked red. I glanced across in time to see Roger lift Brianna\u2019s hand to his lips; Jamie\u2019s ruby shone dark on her finger, catching the light of moon and fire.</p><p>\u201cI see she\u2019s chosen, then,\u201d Jamie said softly.</p><p>Brianna smiled, her eyes on Roger\u2019s face, and leaned to kiss him. Then she stood up, brushing sand from her skirts and bent to pick up a brand from the campfire. She turned and held it out to him, speaking in a voice loud enough to carry to us where we sat across the fire.</p><p>\u201cGo down,\u201d she said, \u201cand tell them the MacKenzies are here.\u201d</p>  </body></html>"]
