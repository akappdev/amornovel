You know I don't fly.\"</p><p>Harper ignored her breakdown. \"Shaundra, dear, it's for the opening of my new publishing company.\" He straightened out the cuffs of his expensive designer suit before staring at her with mesmerizing hazel eyes and bestowing a glorious smile her way. Any other time that might have worked on her...not today.</p> <p>\"So what does that have to do with me?\"</p><p>Harper looked down on her. At five-eleven he posed a threat just being alive. Add swarthy, handsome, and a tight muscular body and you had the total package.</p><p>Shaundra gulped, trying not to look into his eyes. She had this thing for odd-colored eyes.</p><p>\"You are one of our best authors. Who else would we chose to represent us?\"</p><p>His cologne nearly stole her breath away. It had an earthy aroma. His natural male scent wasn't bad either. \"I can think of several other authors who are better than me. Lopez, Brown or Hymel.\"</p> <p>Harper straightened his stance but continued to watch her. \"They have already agreed to be a part of the promotion.\"</p><p>Rat finks. And she thought they were her friends.</p><p>Harper lifted her chin with his manicured finger so he could stare into her eyes.</p><p>Shaundra gulped again. She bet anything he knew what that did to her.</p><p>\"Just say yes.\"</p><p>Shaundra moved her chin out of his hand and scooted away from him.</p> <p>\"I can't. I have a family and responsibilities. I just can't go flying off to Tokyo on a whim.\"</p><p>Harper walked over to his dark brown, maple executive desk and sat down in a matching brown chair. \"Your kids are grown with kids of their own.\"</p><p>\"Exactly. I can't go off to Japan and leave my grandbabies to the mercy of their parents. They need me.\"</p><p>\"I need you.\"</p><p>Damn.</p><p>\"For God's sake, let them grow up. You're a beautiful, desirable woman. It's time for you to live a little.\"</p><p>Shaundra's head lifted. Huh? Did he say beautiful? Harper was hot and an unscrupulous bastard using sweet words to woo her into doing what he wanted. His turning forty just improved him like cheese and wine.</p><p>There wasn't anything about him she didn't find sexy. She gazed over at him, taking in his thick, dark brown hair, that handsome chiseled face and that muscular body. Class reeked from his pores. Damn, it was so tempting just to say yes and get it over with.</p> <p>True, time had been kind to her too...on the outside. Inside, especially emotionally, she had some serious issues. \"Flying terrifies the hell out of me.\"</p><p>\"There's nothing to it and you won't be alone. I'll sit right beside you holding your hand.\"</p><p>Shaundra raised an eyebrow. \"Hmm.\" She liked the visual. She shook her head to clear that fantasy. \"I'm sorry, but you're not close enough to God to save me if the plane crashes.\"</p><p>Harper laughed. \"Your words wound me. That man up above and I have an understanding. He pilots the plane when I fly and I don't sacrifice virgins.\"</p><p>Shaundra managed a weak smile. \"That's good to know, but I'm still not going. There's nothing that can be offered in this world to get me on a plane.\"</p><p>Harper rose, unloosened his tie and removed it. He unbuttoned a couple of buttons and revealed a very masculine chest. \"Oh no?\"</p><p>Shaundra frowned. \"That is so unfair.\" Leave it to him to play the sexy male card. The offer was so tempting. \"It's going to take more than that.\"</p><p>Ooh, I can't believe I just turned down this sexy white man.</p><p>Harper didn't seem offended. He sat down again. \"I know this doctor who can help you.\"</p><p>\"You mean drugs.\"</p><p>\"Prescription, not street. I'll find out if he can see you. He can probably sedate you.\"</p><p>Shaundra frowned. \"For how long?\"</p><p>\"For the duration of the trip.\"</p><p>\"How long is that?\" Shaundra asked. She also had a poor sense of direction.</p><p>\"Twenty-five or twenty-six hours.\"</p><p>\"I'll be a damn junkie by then. I can't stay sedated for an entire day.</p><p>There must be another way.\"</p><p>Harper chuckled deep. The sound went straight down to her crotch. \"I can think of one other thing we can do to suppress that anxiety of yours.\"</p><p>\"What?\" Shaundra asked curiously.</p><p>\"We can become members of the mile high club.\"</p><p>She wondered if she was blushing. Twenty-six hours of non-stop sex with Harper aboard a jet heading for Japan. Tempting. \"What the doctor's name?\"</p><p>\"I think Harper's lost his mind this time,\" Shaundra said to her best friend, Charlotte Martin, when she left Harper's office a couple of minutes later. Charlotte was not only her best friend, but also the editor of her last novel at Kehoe Publishing. They'd been friends since she signed her first contract with Harper. Charlotte was a short, honey blonde-haired female with big blue eyes and voluptuous curves. At forty-five she still maintained a youthful appearance on the outside because she pampered herself and stayed active at the gym a couple days a week.</p><p>\"Oh you mean about the trip to Japan?\"</p><p>\"Yes, you know about it?\" Shaundra sat down in a comfortable red and gold brocade winged chair across from Charlotte's glass modular desk.</p><p>Charlotte sat in a black leather chair unconsciously tapping a pencil against the desk.</p><p>\"You know I don't fly.\"</p><p>Charlotte put the pencil down on the desk. \"But you know this is a wonderful opportunity for you and Kehoe Publishing? Just think of all the interesting people you will meet, and Japan is a superb place to meet men.\"</p><p>\"I don't date short men,\" Shaundra replied. She stood five-eight, and she liked to look up at her dates. It was better on the neck.</p><p>\"It's also a great place for sight-seeing.\"</p><p>\"So is New Orleans,\" Shaundra argued. \"I haven't been home in a while. Maybe I'll go visit my mother while the rest of the group goes off to Japan.\"</p><p>Charlotte rolled the chair back and stretched. \"Shaundra, girl, you're just looking for an excuse. Your latest book is the hottest thing on the market and, by going there, you're bound to take the International market by storm. It'll make you rich.\"</p><p>\"Not everything is about money.\"</p><p>\"Shush,\" Charlotte teased. \"Don't let Harper hear you say that.\" She sat back down. \"Sales are everything.\"</p><p>\"I understand that, but I don't think I can be on a plane for twenty-five hours. I could die from a heart attack up there. I get nervous just going down south on the train.\"</p><p>Charlotte smirked. \"There are medications that can help with your anxiety.</p><p>Valium can take the edge off or render you unconscious...depending on the dosage.\"</p><p>\"Why does everyone want to get me fucked up? Harper already suggested that I visit a doctor friend of his.\"</p><p>\"We don't want to get you fucked up, as you say. Go see the doctor and take your ass to Japan. You've run out of excuses.\"</p><p>\"I can see the headlines now. Erotic romance writer, Shaundra Love Morrison, dies from an overdose of Valium while on a plane headed for the Orient.\"</p><p>\"Your books will fly off the shelves,\" Charlotte said with a little laugh.</p><p>\"Unfunny, best friend.\"</p><p>\"Harper will be there. He won't let anything happen to you.\"</p><p>\"Is that supposed to be a selling point?\"</p><p>\"You really need to loosen up about him. He does like you.\"</p><p>\"And you like him.\"</p><p>\"He's gorgeous and rich,\" Charlotte replied. \"What's not to like?\"</p><p>\"Both admirable qualities,\" Shaundra replied, \"if I was in the market for a new love interest, which I'm not.\"</p><p>\"Why not? It's not like you're in love with Donald.\"</p><p>She would have to go there. She had been in an on/off relationship with Donald Frantz for ten years. Shaundra frowned. The sparks had long since died in their relationship. \"He just doesn't do it for me anymore.\"</p><p>She wouldn't admit this to anyone but Charlotte.</p><p>\"Then why are you still with him?\"</p><p>\"Because I'm stupid and I don't want to hurt his feelings.\" She sighed.</p><p>\"We're the same age, yet he can't keep up with me in the sex department anymore. He uses that little blue pill, which just makes things worse.\"</p><p>\"It's supposed to keep men erect for four hours.\"</p><p>\"We're in our fifties. I don't know about you, but four hours is a long time to have someone huffing, puffing and sweating on top of you with no ejaculation in sight. It's pathetic.\"</p><p>Charlotte nearly choked on laughter. \"You're just fifty years old.\"</p><p>\"It's not funny. I get pissed because I'm sore and it never ends. He still thinks he's some kind of stud, and then when it finally ends, he just rolls over and goes to sleep.\"</p><p>\"So what do you want?\"</p><p>\"For time to turn back. Sex was much better when we were in our twenties.\"</p><p>Charlotte picked the pencil back up. \"I know what your problem is.</p><p>You have the forty-year itch. You're still sexually overactive and you need a mate who can keep up with you...probably a younger man.\"</p><p>\"Younger?\" Shaundra asked. \"How much younger?\"</p><p>\"Younger that fifty-one,\" Charlotte replied. \"One that can keep it up without the little blue pill. Maybe someone in his thirties.\"</p><p>Shaundra gasped. \"I have a thirty-year-old son.\"</p><p>\"So. What about Harper?\"</p><p>\"Harper is forty,\" Shaundra answered.</p><p>\"Yes, and he's a stud muffin. He also has a great ass. Have you seen him at the gym?\"</p><p>Shaundra smiled. \"Harper is my publisher. I don't think it's wise to mix business with pleasure, no matter how tempting. I'll stay out of his bed while in Japan.\"</p><p>\"So you've changed your mind about the trip?\"</p><p>\"Maybe. Why is it so important that I go?\"</p><p>\"Well, I don't know if I should be telling you this or not, but Harper plans to score some brownie points with his new Japanese business partner, Goro Niigata, by using you guys to help promote Niigata's boy band.\"</p><p>\"You're losing me here.\"</p><p>\"Goro Niigata runs this big entertainment business in Japan and Korea, and one of his bands, Aomori, will be making their American debut here in New York in a couple of months, and what better way to help them than by pairing them up with Kehoe's hottest romance authors?\"</p><p>\"Aomori? Never heard of them.\"</p><p>Charlotte got out of her chair, walked over to a file cabinet and took out a manila folder. She walked over to Shaundra and handed it to her.</p><p>Shaundra opened the folder and looked down. \"Oh my. They're beautiful.\" Her stomach clenched and her panties dampened. She moved around on her chair and crossed her ankles to stave off the quivering between the legs.</p><p>Charlotte chuckled. \"Yeah, I had the same reaction the first time I saw that picture. Aren't they something?\"</p><p>Shaundra looked down at the picture again. They were four Japanese men, each pleasing to the eye, but very young. Her stomach clenched again. Did that mean she was attracted to them? Hell, she had stretch marks older than them. No, it couldn't mean that. The one in the center of the picture had very pale skin and his lips were incredibly pink and full.</p><p>Charlotte cleared her throat.</p><p>Shaundra closed the folder and slid it back on Charlotte's desk.</p><p>\"Maybe a trip to Japan might not be such a bad idea after all.\"</p><p>Charlotte smirked at her. \"Yes, I kind of thought you'd change your mind once you saw them.\"</p><p>Shaundra rose from the seat. \"Girl, this is silly.\"</p><p>\"Where are you going?\"</p><p>\"To get that doctor's phone number from Harper.\"</p><p>Charlotte's girlish laughter followed her out of the door. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Yori Morioka played around with a glass paperweight on his manager's desk while his other three band members, Satoshi Hayashi, Takumijo Yamazaki and Ichiro Yoshida sat haphazardly in chairs around Masaaki Fugimoto's office while they waited for him to enter. Masaaki had sent them each an email to meet with him to discuss some important matters about their future.</p><p>Yori liked Masaaki. He was a bit of a nerd, but he was a very good manager. He hoped Masaaki would discuss their upcoming tour in the United States, which he was very interested in. Satoshi had been teaching all of them English and he had a pretty good grasp on it. Satoshi was the only one of the four of them that had been there and Satoshi always bragged about what a great place it was. His father was an ambassador, which meant he'd gotten to travel with him from time to time when he was growing up. He especially liked Los Angeles and New York, where they were scheduled to perform.</p><p>Yori looked over at Satoshi who dozed on and off while he waited. His face was hidden behind thick black hair and a New York Yankee baseball cap. Their hair stylist had him growing his hair longer so he wouldn't need extensions added for their next video. He'd been wearing it in a ponytail, which allowed a rare glimpse at his handsome face. Yori had no problems considering other men handsome. There was no other way to describe him.</p><p>Ichiro noticed Satoshi sleeping and rose to mess with him. He gently ran a finger across Satoshi's cheek.</p> <p>Satoshi's lids slid back as he lifted his head, revealing dark brown eyes. \"What?\"</p><p>\"Wake up. Masaaki will be here shortly.\" Ichiro walked back to his seat and sat down.</p><p>Satoshi yawned, stretched, and tried to be attentive.</p><p>Yori smiled. Satoshi still appeared very sleepy.</p><p>Their manager entered several minutes later dressed in a dark blue business suit with a matching tie. Masaaki, as he allowed them to call him, was thirty years old and had been their business manager for five years.</p> <p>His father and Goro Niigata were childhood friends. Goro hired Masaaki on as soon as he graduated at the top of his college class.</p><p>It was easy to talk with Masaaki since he was only five years older than them. Unfortunate for him, he was also shorter than them, and often ridiculed about his five-foot-six stature. Each member of Aomori stood about six feet tall. Masaaki had a complex about his height, which always drew attention when he accompanied them anywhere. Yori understood his discomfort. Sometimes being taller than the average Japanese citizen had its disadvantages too.</p><p>Masaaki sat down at his desk and put his paperweight back on a stack of papers. His feet barely touched the floor. He adjusted his eyeglasses on his nose. \"First topic. Mr. Niigata has arranged for you guys to give two nights of concerts at the Tokyo Dome to promote your latest album. \" Some of the band members squawked. Two back-to-back shows were hard on their bodies.</p><p>\"It's out of my control, fellows. Both nights are sold out already. Mr.</p><p>Niigata is a man of his word and will not back out of this deal.\"</p><p>Yori already knew this. Goro Niigata was a true businessman and he had guided their careers from the beginning. None of them would complain, since it wouldn't do them any good.</p> <p>\"We've done two nights before,\" Ichiro replied. He was the youngest of their group and the shortest at six feet tall. His function in the family was to take care of the home and prepare their meals. Ichiro took to his job with relish. He was a great chef, taught by his grandmother and a master chef when he was just a child, and he hoped one day to open restaurants all over Asia when he retired from Aomori.</p><p>He brushed his long bangs back away from his eyes. \"I don't think it will be a problem.\"</p><p>Usually Ichiro never uttered a sound in meetings except when he was spoken to. He was the same way around the apartment that they shared.</p><p>The only time he wasn't silent was on stage. Yori felt comfortable having Ichiro at his left when they performed.</p><p>Member number four, Takumijo Yamazaki, had yet to utter a sound.</p><p>He just sat there like a beautiful statue listening to the conversation going on around him. Takumijo's main concern in life was himself. His unique characteristics was that he was vain, spent money as fast as he earned it on cars or the latest electronics, and he never bought clothes off the rack.</p><p>Takumijo had grown up poor and swore never to be in that predicament again.</p><p>\"So, we all agree?\" Masaaki asked.</p> <p>Four hands flew up in the air to accept the concert dates. Although the four of them had different personalities, they all agreed on one thing - Aomori came first. It took fifteen long years to get them where they were today, at the top of the charts. Their last album, Motion, had been nominated as album on the year, and it had made them Japan's best band.</p><p>Motion changed them from amateurs to professionals and Yori still felt awed by it all.</p><p>\"Second topic, promotion. Mr. Niigata has lined you up for many television and media appearances in the next few weeks. As you know, he has had formed a partnership with the American publishing mogul, Harper Kehoe, and the grand opening of their new publishing company is slated to open in two weeks in Tokyo.\"</p><p>\"What does that have to do with us?\" Takumijo asked.</p><p>\"Everything,\" Masaaki answered. \"He plans to use you guys to help promote his new business by having you join forces with four American romance writers.\"</p><p>Takumijo frowned as if he'd smelt something unpleasant.</p><p>Yori raised an eyebrow. \"That's odd. Do they speak Japanese?\"</p><p>\"I doubt it,\" Masaaki replied. \"And even if they do, it's only a couple of words.\" He paused. \"Besides, you guys know enough English to communicate with them. Satoshi can interpret if you run into a problem. \"</p><p>Satoshi opened his mouth, but closed it quickly. \"Okay.\"</p><p>\"I knew you would agree,\" Masaaki replied. \"You have a better grasp on the English language than the rest of them. We're depending on you.\"</p><p>\"What other plans has he made?\" Yori asked. He was quite curious where this would lead, especially since Satoshi had agreed so quickly.</p><p>Masaaki flipped through some paperwork on his desk until he found what he searched for. \"A photo session for a magazine, a couple of personal appearances at stores and on television, followed up by the announcement about the opening of the publishing company. There will be some kind of formal party for this too. So be prepared to be photographed a lot.\"</p><p>Ichiro cringed. Of the four of them, Ichiro hated to be photographed.</p><p>Yori never understood why. Ichiro was beautiful with small, delicate features and amazing, rare blue eyes. The stylist insisted that he keep it in a ponytail until he performed, at which time he would release it, much to the delight of the female fans. The fan girls loved Ichiro and they sent him lots of gifts and made him the topic of a lot of YouTube videos. Ichiro's main problem was that he was very shy.</p><p>\"Mr. Niigata wants you to be on your best behavior during this time and you're not to embarrass this company in any way, shape or form.\"</p><p>Takumijo muttered something under his breath.</p><p>\"Yes, I'm talking about you, demon boy,\" Masaaki said to Takumijo.</p><p>Try to keep your clothes on during the performances, and try not to get hooked up with some empty-headed starlet while the Americans are in town.\"</p><p>Yori stifled a grin. Takumijo always got them in trouble with his antics.</p><p>\"Boy, do one thing and you get permanently known as a trouble- maker.\"</p><p>\"If it was only one thing, we wouldn't have a problem. Photographers love you and cavorting around with a bevy of beauties in a pool in the buff draws their attention.\"</p><p>Satoshi and Ichiro did not try to hide their chagrin. They outright laughed, which made Takumijo angry.</p><p>\"You guys aren't innocent either. You get into just as much shit as I do, but Mr. Niigata does not ban you to your room or take away your privileges.\"</p><p>\"You could have drowned in that pool,\" Masaaki replied. \"You were very drunk at the time of the incident.\"</p><p>Yori agreed. The media had a field day with that little fiasco.</p><p>Takumijo craved attention and sometimes went out of the way to get it.</p><p>One of these days, he was going to get his ass in a whole lot of trouble that Mr. Niigata couldn't buy him out of. He just wasn't satisfied that his face donned the cover of most of all the magazines since his debut. His calendar was filled with requests for personal appearance appointments and more photo sessions. It surprised him that Takumijo wasn't more enthusiastic about the situation.</p><p>Niigata Enterprises played up their looks and bodies, sparing no expense to transform them into a desirable package. It had been fun at first until the first time he was mistaken for a girl. Till this day, people questioned his sexuality. Yori frowned. He couldn't help it if he was born that way...more feminine looking than male. He had a penis. That had to count for something.</p><p>Anyway, it wasn't anyone's business but his own if he was gay or not.</p><p>The media didn't consider it so by always printing stories about him dating some guy. It got to a point where he couldn't even hang out with his friends for fear that he'd be linked to one of them sexually. He wondered if the others felt the same way about themselves or about him.</p><p>Of course, they were much too polite to ask. On the flip side, Ichiro had it worse than the others. Sometimes it was even hard for them to remember that Ichiro was a male.</p><p>\"The last thing on the agenda is your upcoming trip to the United States. Everything has been arranged and all we have to do is show up.</p><p>We're going to do a total of forty concerts in the next six months and I'm hoping you guys will give it your all. Aomori needs to take America by storm.\"</p><p>\"Then we have no problem,\" Yori replied. \"I'm looking forward to visiting Los Angeles and New York and meeting our fans from all around America.\" In reality, he needed a change of scenery. Life was getting a bit stale in Japan and if something different didn't happen in his life, he'd go stir crazy. The group was his life, but he needed some him time.</p><p>\"That's all I have,\" Masaaki said. \"Do you have any more questions?\"</p><p>Ichiro raised his hand. \"About those authors? What are we supposed to do with them?\"</p><p>\"Take pictures with them and maybe be seen in public together. Mr.</p><p>Niigata thinks it could be good for your image to be seen with some of the most brilliant minds in the publishing world.\"</p><p>\"Why would I want to be associated with a bunch of stuffy old men?\"</p><p>Takumijo asked.</p><p>Masaaki rolled his dark eyes behind his glasses. \"That's the kind of attitude Mr. Niigata was afraid of. It wouldn't harm you to hang around with people outside the music world. You'd be surprised what you can learn from a bunch of stuffy old men.\" He gathered up his paperwork and prepared to dismiss them. \"I think we're covered just about everything we need to cover today. Try to stay out of trouble.\"</p><p>Yori looked over at the others.</p><p>Takumijo stared at him. \"Yeah, he's talking about you too. You're not innocent, Yori. Not by a long shot.\"</p><p>Yori smirked innocently.</p><p>\"Ms. Morrison, it's time to wake up.\"</p><p>Shaundra opened her eyes slowly and found a stewardess smiling down at her and Harper seated beside her.</p><p>\"I've been trying to wake her for the last ten minutes,\" Harper explained to the stewardess.</p><p>Shaundra yawned and moved the blanket down her chest. \"Where are we?\"</p><p>\"Narita Airport, in Tokyo,\" Harper explained as he sent the stewardess on her way. He opened the curtain.</p><p>Shaundra looked over at the window, but didn't make a move because she would have to bend over him to see out. It was dark anyway. What did she expect to see? \"Welcome back to reality,\" Dorothy Brown, one of her fellow authors accompanying her on the tour, said. She was seated across the aisle of the smaller than she imagined plane. Dorothy, at fifty-five, was the oldest author at Kehoe Publishing, but there was nothing old about her mind.</p><p>Dorothy created wonderful Regency and Historical novels. Her short, black hair was fashionably spiky, styled on the top of her head. Her alert brown eyes twinkled as she smiled.</p><p>\"Thanks. How long have I been out?\"</p><p>\"Pretty much the entire trip,\" Harper explained. \"You woke up when we got to California to pick up some passengers and to refuel.\"</p><p>\"I don't remember that.\"</p><p>He chuckled. \"I guess not. You woke up long enough to drug yourself up again.\"</p><p>Shaundra rose. \"I have to go to the restroom before I get off of this tuna can.\"</p><p>\"Perfectly understandable,\" Riley Hymel said as he stood up from the seat in front of her. He reached up and took his carryon bag from the overhead compartment. He stood six foot tall with thick blond hair, baby blue eyes, and had a Texas accent. He was Kehoe's resident paranormal romance writer and gorgeous pretty boy. He looked like he should grace the cover of one of Dorothy's novels.</p><p>The fourth author, Jackson Lopez, scooted out from the seat next to Riley. Jackson was a tad bit shorter than both Riley and Harper. He spoke with a rich Hispanic accent that he exaggerated when he tried to be funny.</p><p>With dark brown hair that curled softly down his neck and sparkling green eyes, he was every gay man's fantasy. At times, he could be catty and sarcastic, which he used to make the words burn the pages of his gay romance novels. Los Angeles born and raised, but Jackson loved New York, had moved there permanently, and refused to return to California.</p><p>Shaundra scooted off to the restroom while the others gathered their things. Most of the passengers had already started getting off the plane.</p><p>She opened the door. The place was so small she began to hyperventilate.</p><p>Once she finished, she washed her hands and joined the others back by their seats. Harper handed her the smaller bag she'd brought along and he carried her precious laptop.</p><p>\"Let's get off this thing,\" he replied. \"I need bath, food and sleep.\"</p><p>\"Me too,\" Jackson agreed.</p><p>They didn't have to tell her twice. Shaundra followed Harper off the plane, and the rest of their party followed. They hurried down the ramp and stepped into the terminal. Solid ground, Shaundra thought, thanking the Lord for getting all of them to Japan safely.</p><p>The terminal was busy and bustling with life as they got the rest of their luggage on the second floor. Japanese, Americans, and just about every walk of life roamed the terminal boarding and disembarking from planes. Harper escorted them to customs on the first floor. After what seemed to be the longest hour of her life, they were finally ready to leave.</p><p>\"There's our ride,\" Harper said as he pointed to a chauffeur clothed in white, holding his name up on a sign.</p><p>Shaundra and the others followed Harper over to the man, dragging their luggage behind them.</p><p>The humidity smacked her dead in the face as the chauffer escorted them to a white limousine and began loading their luggage onboard.</p><p>\"Damn, it's hotter than Texas,\" Riley exclaimed as he helped her and Dorothy into the limousine. \"I heard it was humid here, but this is ridiculous.\"</p><p>Harper entered the limousine from the left side, which put him right next to her with Dorothy on her right. Riley sat across from Harper and Jackson crawled in and sat next to Riley. The chauffer made sure both of the doors were secured before entering the front seat.</p><p>Dorothy fanned herself furiously. \"It's like having hot flashes on top of hot flashes.\"</p><p>Shaundra chuckled. \"You won't melt, and besides, the driver just put on the air conditioner.\"</p><p>\"You don't seem too bothered by the heat,\" Dorothy replied.</p><p>\"I grew up in the south where it's hot six months of the year.\" They left the loading area, traveled through the airport and then exited down a long roadway. She couldn't see much out of the tinted windows. \"It looks spooky out there,\" Shaundra replied with a yawn.</p><p>\"You'll get to see more of it tomorrow,\" Harper assured her. \"And don't yawn. You'll make the rest of us sleepy.\"</p><p>\"I'm not sleepy.\"</p><p>\"You shouldn't be,\" he teased.</p><p>They rode for about an hour before the chauffer turned the car into the drive of a huge hotel and parked. He came around to open the right passenger side of the door. Riley and Jackson stepped out first, followed by Dorothy, Shaundra, and then Harper.</p><p>\"Would you look at this place,\" Dorothy exclaimed. \"It's huge.\"</p><p>She did not exaggerate. Mr. Niigata had arranged for them to stay in a five star hotel. Bell boys arrived to get their luggage and piled them on golden, rolling carts. Moments later, they led the way to the reservation desk.</p><p>Friendly young Japanese women welcomed them and quickly checked them in. Everyone was on the same floor except her. Her room was located on the floor just above them. Shaundra didn't care. All she required was bed, television and a bathroom. Location and scenic view was just an option.</p><p>\"Order room service and then rest,\" Harper told them as their respective bell boy took them off. \"I'll call all of you when I wake up.\"</p><p>Shaundra smirked, wondering if he had been awake the entire trip there or if he was just feeling the effect of the time change.</p><p>Harper and Dorothy disappeared in one elevator and then Riley and Jackson got on another, leaving her to wait for another one to arrive.</p><p>The door finally opened and Shaundra allowed the bell boy to enter first with her luggage cart. She walked in and pressed the button for the twelfth floor. Once there, the bell boy exited with the cart while she held open the door. She exited and followed him down a carpeted hall. A faint scent of cigarette smoke and disinfectant clung in the air. The bell boy turned another curb and she followed. Her peace was disturbed by the sound of loud voices, and then someone ran into the back of her. Shaundra closed her eyes and prepared herself to hit the floor, but instead, she found herself in someone's arms. She opened her eyes. It was a young Japanese man. Well, she thought it was a male. It was hard to tell with all that hair.</p><p>Most of his face was hidden behind it and a pair of sunglasses.</p><p>\"Sorry,\" he said, righting her to her feet. \"You are fine?\"</p><p>Shaundra smiled at his attempt at English. \"Yes, I'm fine.\" She walked away from him quickly to catch up with the bell boy, passing a group of young men who walked over and stood by the young man.</p><p>The bell boy stopped in front of a room. He used a key card and entered, turning on the light and dragging the cart behind him. She entered, taking in the scent of cleaning products, and just stood there gawking at the sight of the opulent suite. After the luggage was unloaded, Shaundra tipped the bell boy, closed and locked the door after he left. She turned to face the room again.</p><p>The part she stood in had a sofa, desk, chair, telephone, and a DVD player. On the other side of the room was a kitchenette with full-sized appliances and cabinets. She walked over and opened one of the cabinets.</p><p>It was filled with dishes and glassware. There were utensils and chopsticks in the drawer like she knew how to use it. Shaundra closed up the drawer and cabinet and went to check out the bed and bathroom.</p><p>\"Wow,\" she uttered as she opened the door and turned on the light.</p><p>\"This is awesome.\" She could fit her bedroom back home in this one and still have space. An oil portrait of a Japanese shrine hung above the dark wood king-sized headboard. Pictures of waterfalls, cherry blossom trees and exotic birds hung on the surrounding walls. There was a flat screen television mounted on the wall facing the bed just above a full-sized dresser and chest of drawers. Near the window she spotted another desk and a chair for her to work with while she wrote if she was too lazy to walk into the outer room.</p><p>The room was beautifully decorated in brown, tan and yellow, which made it feel quite comfortable.</p><p>Shaundra walked toward the bathroom, passing the sink and vanity mirror in an alcove just outside the room. On the opposite wall, she spotted an ironing board, a blow dryer and room accessories. She turned the knob and opened the door. Inside were a full-sized sunken tub and a standalone shower. \"This is nice.\" But she didn't see the toilet. There was another door. Shaundra opened it. Inside, she found a toilet. It looked a bit different from the ones back in the United States, but she guessed it served the same purpose.</p><p>Shaundra closed the door and turned to eye the tub again and the shower, trying to decided which one to use. She chose the shower since she was still a bit loopy from the anti-anxiety medicine and she feared she'd drown if she got too comfortable. Besides, she needed to wash her hair. She left the bathroom and walked back into the bedroom to unpack her luggage. Once she finished, she grabbed her toiletries and hurried back into the bathroom. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The phone rang in Shaundra's room just as she exited the bathroom after showering. She plodded across the dark green carpeted floor to the nightstand where the telephone rested. She sat down on the edge of the bed and reached for it. \"Hello.\" Loud music blared in her ear.</p><p>\"Shaundra, it's Dorothy. The guys and I are down in the lounge. Haul your ass down here and join us.\"</p><p>Shaundra moved the receiver to her right ear because her left ear still felt clogged with water. \"I just got out of the shower. What are you doing down in the lounge? Did Harper call a meeting?\" She looked down at the red button on the base of the phone to see if she'd missed his message.</p><p>\"No, Harper didn't call a meeting. We're down here having a nightcap.</p> <p>That was one hell of a long plane ride.\"</p><p>Shaundra was still reeling from the effects of the Valium. \"I'm glad I don't remember much about the ride.\"</p><p>\"So you're going to join us?\"</p><p>It was nice of Dorothy not to mention how drugged out she'd been.</p><p>\"Give me a few minutes to throw on some clothes.\"</p> <p>Dorothy relayed her message to the other two authors. \"Hurry up, this place is jumping.\"</p><p>Shaundra looked down at the clock. It was close to midnight on a Thursday. What could possibly be happening? She heard singing in the background. It sounded like a live band. \"I'll be there shortly. Bye.\" She hung up before Dorothy could entertain her with more conversation.</p><p>Within minutes, she had donned a red dress she'd purchased right before she left New York and accessorized with matching red earrings, watch and beads. Shaundra grabbed the black clutch that matched her heels and left the room, stuffing her key card inside on the way to the elevator.</p><p>Five minutes later, she exited the elevator on the first floor and followed the signs to the lounge. Music met her at the door. The singer sung a hip song in Japanese as she entered. Dorothy was right. The dance floor was packed with young people. Her older friends sat at the bar.</p><p>Dorothy waved her over.</p><p>Shaundra side-stepped around the dancers as she walked over to the bar. Jackson Lopez moved over to the next seat so she could sit next to Dorothy, who sat at Riley Hymel's left. All of them were decently dressed and looking like they still were suffering from jet lag.</p> <p>Riley nursed a Bloody Mary and leaned on an elbow, half awake. The bartender appeared, dressed entirely in white. He spoke to her in broken English. \"Would you like to order?\"</p><p>\"A Coke please.\"</p><p>\"Diet or regular?\"</p><p>\"Regular.\"</p><p>He stepped aside to the fountain to prepare it.</p><p>Dorothy nudged her. \"What, not drinking tonight?\"</p><p>\"No, I don't think it's wise to mix alcohol with tranquilizers.\"</p><p>The bartender handed her the soda. Shaundra raised the glass to her lips and swallowed. The liquid burned the back of her throat. \"Ah, real Coke.\" Not that watered down mess bars usually served. The sugar rushed quickly to her brain to keep her awake.</p> <p>Shaundra looked around the place. She could see well now that her eyes were adjusted to the lighting. The lounge was a pretty good size. The tables were covered in red cloths that reminded her of an Italian restaurant.</p><p>There was a bandstand, instruments and microphones in the center of the room, but near the front wall. The band that was playing when she entered had just finished a set and was walking around, mixing with the crowd. A picture of a Japanese shrine covered the wall behind the bandstand. Paper lanterns hung from the ceiling, each decorated in pictures of Japanese culture from the past. The rest rooms were located on the north side of the room away from the bar and the dance floor, and there were a few private booths nearby that were crammed full of young people in their early twenties, all dressed in faddish club clothes.</p><p>Dancers moved past them and returned to their seats as canned music filtered out of the speakers. Another band appeared. This time, it was four young men in their twenties. They moved into position near a piano. She stared, recognizing one of them as the guy who'd come to her aid in the hallway upstairs when she arrived. Wait. She knew all of them. It was Aomori, the guys from the photo Charlotte showed her in her office back in New York. Her stomach did that clenching thing again. She almost didn't recognize them because their hair was different...longer and untamed. The clothes they wore were more contemporary, low riding jeans and chest revealing T-shirts. Okay, they had her attention.</p><p>One of them sat down at the piano and then someone dimmed the lights, leaving the spotlight on them. The audience quieted as the piano intro began. Dorothy, Jackson and Riley turned on their stools to watch and listen.</p><p>One of them raised a mike and a beautiful tenor voice eased out. A few seconds later, three more soulful voices joined his.</p><p>They can sing too. Shit. She'd hoped they could so she would have an excuse for thinking about them. Shaundra settled back, watching the way they moved, listening to their harmony and wondering why the sound was getting to her. Hopefully, it was just her imagination.</p><p>The next song was a more upbeat tune, which had the crowd back on their feet, including Dorothy and Riley, who looked a bit out of place with the youngsters. Jackson ordered a beer. \"Would you like something else?\"</p><p>he asked her.</p><p>\"No, I'm fine.\" She paused. \"These guys are good.\"</p><p>\"They're okay. Cute too.\"</p><p>Shaundra smirked. Jackson never hid the fact that he was gay. In fact, he built his writing career on the sexuality. His Facebook page was crammed with young gay males trying to get to know him.</p><p>\"Yeah, but young,\" Shaundra finally answered.</p><p>The band performed a few more songs and then Dorothy and Riley returned to their seats. Dorothy frantically fanned herself to cool off as she hopped back onto the bar stool. She ordered a Long Island Iced Tea.</p><p>\"Those guys are so good,\" she said once she had her drink in her hand. \"I wonder who they are.\"</p><p>\"Our pet project,\" Shaundra announced. \"That's Aomori, the group Harper told us about.\"</p><p>Dorothy looked back over at the band that had finished playing and had moved on to a table close by. No other band appeared, just music for the speakers. \"Do you know them?\"</p><p>\"Not really, why?\"</p><p>\"Because two of them are looking at you.\"</p><p>\"I'm the lone African American in a Japanese lounge. I'm bound to draw attention.\" Shaundra raised her eyes. Sure enough, the lead singer and the one who played the piano were staring directly at her. \"Oh, them.</p><p>They nearly knocked me down when I arrived earlier. They were running down the hall, playing like a bunch of kids. I guess they remember me from that.\"</p><p>\"Look, one of them is coming over.\" Dorothy adjusted her clothes and smoothed down her hair.</p><p>Shaundra smirked. Dorothy was older than she was and had no business getting all excited about meeting some boy band member. It was the piano player.</p><p>He stopped before them and bowed from the waist. \"My name is Satoshi Hayashi. Are you a Ms. Shaundra Morrison?\"</p><p>\"Yes,\" Shaundra said coolly, wondering how the handsome Japanese youth knew her name. \"How can I help you?\" She looked him over.</p><p>Satoshi was a tantalizing sight, six feet tall or taller with shoulder length black hair and brown eyes. He was dressed in a pair of blue jeans that rode his slim hips like a glove. She raised her eyes up to his face. He had perfect skin, a slender nose and thin lips. He also spoke flawless English.</p><p>Satoshi pointed toward his table. \"Our leader, Yori Morioka, would like you to join us at our table.\"</p><p>Shaundra glanced over at their table. Yori, fetching. The name fit him and he didn't even bother to look their way. He just kept talking like he was in deep conversation with the other two. \"Sorry, I'm with friends. It would be rude to just leave them.\" Even ruder not to invite them too.</p><p>Satoshi bowed again and walked away.</p><p>Shaundra checked out his butt. Tiny, but cute.</p><p>Dorothy nudged her. \"Are you crazy? Why did you pass up that opportunity?\"</p><p>Shaundra swiveled her stool around until she faced the bar again.</p><p>\"What opportunity? So a group of b-boys invited me to sit at their table and I refused. What do you think was going to happen?\"</p><p>Someone tapped her on her shoulder. Shaundra eased the stool around and her eyes landed directly at the chest of a man. Her eyes continued to journey up until they met with a pair of dark brown ones, set in a face so beautiful it took her breath away. Yori.</p><p>He, too, bowed once he had her full attention. \"Good evening, Ms.</p><p>Morrison. My name is Yori Morioka and I'm the leader of Aomori. Please dance with me.\" He extended his hand to her.</p><p>Damn, a direct refusal would be considered bad manners. What am I going to do? Before she knew it, her hand was locked in his and they were standing on the dance floor amongst a crowd of kids young enough to be hers. The music began. A fast Japanese pop song. The audience seemed to recognize it and went wild, flailing arms and wiggling hips on the floor next to them. Yori joined them, moving around her like his tall young body was made for dancing.</p><p>Dance, the voice said inside her head. Her body moved, thankful that shed kept up with the trendy steps over the years. She had no choice since her children kept the walls vibrating with the latest hip-hop beats and insisted that she dance and go clubbing with them. She'd accompanied them a couple of times just to get out for a breather, but she didn't go often because she didn't want to cramp their style.</p><p>Shaundra looked around. The crowd had disappeared, leaving her on the dance floor with Yori. It reminded her of a scene out of Saturday Night Fever. All eyes felt penned on them as they moved. Their efforts were rewarded by jaunts of encouragement and a lot of clapping. Any other time, she would be totally mortified being the center of attention, but Yori fixed that by keeping his dark eyes locked on her.</p><p>The music finally ended. It was replaced by a slower one, which she planned to use as her way out to return to her friends. Yori grabbed her hand and pulled her to him as soon as she attempted to move.</p><p>\"You dance well,\" he whispered into her ear.</p><p>His warm breath tickled against her skin. He spoke English clearly.</p><p>\"Thank you.\"</p><p>No more words were spoken. There was no need as he moved her slowly around the floor. The problem of being watched slowly disappeared as she got into the dance, pressed tightly against his strong, young chest. Shaundra closed her eyes, trying to listen to his heartbeat and the rhythm of the music since she didn't understand the words. Maybe she'd better pick up that Japanese language book Harper had given her and learn a few words.</p><p>The song was nice and mellow and made her feel spongy inside. Her dance partner wasn't a slouch in the slow dance department either. He used that fantastic body of his to move her around the floor gracefully.</p><p>\"Why did you turn down my invitation?\"</p><p>\"Because I'm here with friends and you didn't invite them.\"</p><p>\"My mistake. I will remember next time.\"</p><p>Shaundra frowned. There wasn't going to be a next time. Aomori was kids. Why would she want to hang out with them? Or worse, why would Aomori want to hang out with a bunch of middle-aged writers? The song ended and he escorted her back to the bar, bowed again, and then went back to his table. It was followed by some laughter and one of them rewarded Yori with a punch on the arm.</p><p>Dorothy leaned in. \"Shocked the hell out of them, didn't you? I bet they thought you couldn't dance. You have some killer moves.\"</p><p>\"I can hold my own, but I bet I'll be aching something fierce when I wake up.\" She glanced down at her watch. \"Speaking of which, it's nearly two in the morning.\" She slid off the bar stool. \"I'm exhausted. I think I'm going up to my room to crash.\"</p><p>\"Do you need me to escort you upstairs?\" Riley asked.</p><p>\"No thanks. I know the way.\" She left the other three writers sitting there and headed toward the door, not missing the evil stare a young female seated by the door gave her.</p><p>\"What were you thinking, leader?\" Satoshi asked after he drew Yori's attention away from the exit door.</p><p>\"What do you mean?\"</p><p>\"That author, the dancing?\"</p><p>\"Because she turned down my invitation to join us.\"</p><p>\"So you asked her to dance because she snubbed you?\" Takumijo asked. \"I don't get it.\"</p><p>He lifted his glass and saluted them. \"Kanpai.\"</p><p>\"Kanpai,\" the others repeated.</p><p>\"No, I did it to get back at her,\" Yori confessed. \"I figured I'd embarrass her to get even.\"</p><p>\"Very petty,\" Satoshi replied. \"Not to mention that it backfired.\"</p><p>Ichiro chuckled, but did not comment.</p><p>Takumijo wasn't as nice. \"She has some nice moves for her age.\"</p><p>\"What's wrong with her age?\" Satoshi asked.</p><p>\"She's older than he is. Hot, but still much older.\"</p><p>\"Definitely hot,\" Satoshi agreed. \"And so out of his league.\"</p><p>Yori punched him on the arm playfully. \"You're supposed to be my friend, and anyway, I'm not interested in her in that way. Amaya would kill me.\"</p><p>Amaya and Yori had been dating since elementary, and their engagement had been arranged by their parents since they were kids. The two of them planned to marry soon or after Yori completed his military duty.</p><p>Takumijo called the waiter over and ordered another round of drinks for them.</p><p>Satoshi sighed. He was drunk already and sleepy.</p><p>The waiter arrived quickly with their drinks and returned to the bar.</p><p>Three of them drank Shochu, a drink distilled from barley, while Ichiro stuck to iced tea. Ichiro never ate anything unhealthy and only on special occasions would he drink sake. He didn't talk much either, which didn't make sense since he had the voice of an angel. They'd been together for fifteen years and there were still things locked inside Ichiro's head that he refused to share, and they shared everything except women and underwear.</p><p>Takumijo stared at some of the dancers on the floor and then rejoined the conversation, which had veered onto another topic...the upcoming concerts. \"Masaaki must be out of his head allowing Mr. Niigata to book us with back to back concerts. When are we supposed to rest?\" He sipped his drink.</p><p>\"When we die,\" Yori replied. \"Mr. Niigata knows what he's doing.</p><p>The more experience we get, the better the reception we'll receive in the United States. If he wants us to hang out with the authors, we'll hang out with the authors.\"</p><p>\"Speaking of which, how did you know you had the right people when they entered the lounge? You've never met them.\"</p><p>\"Elementary,\" Yori explained. \"I did my homework and searched their names on the Internet after we met with Masaaki. That's what a good leader does. One writes paranormal romance, one writes gay romance, one writes historical romance, and one writes erotica. Can you guess which one does what?\"</p><p>\"What type of erotica?\" Takumijo asked suddenly, a little more interested in the conversation.</p><p>\"The real good stuff,\" Yori replied.</p><p>Ichiro chuckled again and continued to nurse his iced tea.</p><p>\"What's so funny, Ich?\" Takumijo asked.</p><p>\"Nothing. I was just imagining the surprised look on Masaaki's face when he found that out. You know how uptight he gets with that type of stuff.\"</p><p>\"He'd better get over that,\" Yori explained. \"I heard this new company is only going to feature gay novels.\"</p><p>Takumijo made a face. \"You do a lot of reading, Ichiro. Have you ever heard of any of them?\"</p><p>\"Only one of them,\" Ichiro replied. \"And I'm not saying which.\"</p><p>Satoshi gently tugged Ichiro's long hair.</p><p>\"Ouch.\"</p><p>\"What else are you hiding from us?\"</p><p>Ichiro went back to his tea, ending the conversation.</p><p>\"That's okay, we'll find out tomorrow at the meeting,\" Satoshi replied.</p><p>Yori looked down at his watch. \"It's tomorrow already. We better get up to our rooms before Masaaki wakes up and comes down to get us.\" He rose and the others followed, much to the disappointment of the crowd.</p><p>Satoshi looked over at the bar. Only the two men remained, which meant the other female must have left shortly after Shaundra Morrison.</p><p>Like Ichiro, he noticed that she did not drink alcohol. He hadn't smelled any on her when he approached, just sweet soap and shampoo.</p><p>Yori led them out of the door and into the bright lobby to the elevator.</p><p>Satoshi pushed the button. Shaundra Morrison was the first woman he'd ever seen Yori take an interest in besides Amaya. He sighed. And the two women were as different as night and day. The elevator door opened.</p><p>Hmm, this is going to be interesting. He followed his friends inside the door and it closed behind them. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Masaaki listened intently as his boss, Goro Niigata, and his new business partner, Harper Kehoe, discussed the opening of their new publishing company while they waited for the eight writers and Aomori to arrive. They were seated in the large board room upstairs on the twenty- third floor at Niigata Enterprises in Tokyo. The main office was in Osaka where they all lived.</p><p>The four Asian authors they were expecting all were from Tokyo, a deal Goro Niigata worked out to synch a successful opening and no problems from the Japanese government. Masaaki had already met the two men and women, who all had very big followings throughout Asia. The two females, Chirau Narita and Izanami Kudo wrote romance, and the two men, Hideahi Chiba and Iwao Kimura, wrote romance and horror. Each has stepped out of the realm of their specialty to write yaoi for Niigata and Kehoe. Oh my word, Masaaki thought. Boy love garbage. At first, he'd thought Mr. Niigata was out of his mind until he'd done some research on the subject of gay romance and discovered that the sales were skyrocketing all around the world.</p><p>\"Did your authors arrive safely?\" Goro asked Harper. He was dressed in a black business suit with a classical pearl button shirt beneath. His jet black hair was parted on the right, differently than he normally wore it...giving him a young, stylish look.</p><p>Masaaki smiled. Being around Aomori was rubbing off on him.</p> <p>\"Yes, even Ms. Morrison,\" Harper answered. He was dressed in a dark gray suit with a red shirt and grey tie. His dark brown hair was short, revealing a very nice, clean shaven face. His voice was deep and eloquent and had a bit of a western accent. Luckily, both he and Goro were well- versed in English and Japanese and could act as interpreters for the meeting.</p><p>\"You mean the one afraid to fly?\"</p><p>Harper chuckled. \"Yes, I had to promise her the world to get her to come.\"</p><p>\"The world?\" Goro asked.</p><p>\"Yes, I promised I'd hold her hand all the way here and I even offered her my body if that would help.\"</p> <p>Goro cracked a seldom seen smile. \"And she agreed after that?\"</p><p>Harper continued to smile. \"No, Shaundra Morrison isn't like that unfortunately. So I had to give her the next best thing. I introduced her to a doctor who specialized in phobias and anxiety.\"</p><p>\"You mean you found a doctor who would drug her.\"</p><p>\"Exactly. She slept most of the way here.\"</p><p>\"Was that wise?\" Goro asked.</p><p>\"She's one of the best authors in the world and a real sweet woman. I couldn't allow her to miss out on an opportunity of a lifetime because she's afraid to fly.\"</p> <p>\"I suppose you're right. My wife is also afraid to fly. \"</p><p>The door to the office opened and Emiko Hana, Goro's secretary, walked in. \"Four of the authors have arrived, Mr. Niigata,\" she replied.</p><p>\"And four more are on the way up on the elevator.\"</p><p>Masaaki wondered which ones had arrived first. His question was answered when four American authors walked through the door. He looked down at his watch. Right on time. Punctuality was always a good thing.</p><p>Harper got up to greet and introduce them. \"You guys have perfect timing. I was just talking about you.\" He introduced the two men first.</p><p>\"Mr. Niigata and Mr. Fugimoto, this is Jackson Lopez and Riley Hymel, our paranormal and gay romance authors.\"</p><p>The two authors bowed respectfully. Masaaki liked that they'd taken the time to learn about Asian culture and tradition. The women were introduced next.</p><p>\"And this is Dorothy Brown. She writes historical and regency romance.\" He pulled an African American woman over. \"This is Shaundra Morrison, our erotic romance author. Her latest novel, Temptation, has just made it to the number one spot on the New York Best Seller's list this morning.\"</p> <p>The two women bowed, but the one named Shaundra Morrison did not show delight in hearing the good news about her book.</p><p>Mr. Niigata bowed to them. \"Congratulations on the success of your book, Ms. Morrison. I'm looking forward to your current book with KiNii doing the same thing.\"</p><p>\"Nice to meet both of you, Mr. Niigata and Mr. Fugimoto. I look forward to working with both of you.\"</p><p>She had a nice voice, kind of throaty and sensual. He guessed she fit the description of what an erotic romance writer should look like, pretty with a nice body. The enamored look on Harper Kehoe's face meant she was something special to him too.</p><p>The authors joined them at the conference table. A few minutes later, Emiko knocked on the door again and brought in the Asian writers. The meeting began after the introductions were over.</p><p>It went a lot better than expected and communication wasn't a problem. All four of the Japanese authors spoke English and two were fluent.</p><p>\"What exactly is expected of us, Mr. Niigata?\" Chirau Narita asked.</p><p>She was in her mid-twenties, about five-feet-four inches tall and very thin.</p><p>\"As I explained earlier, the eight of you will be doing numerous interviews at television stations and personal appearances in Tokyo to promote the opening of the new publishing company. On Sunday, you will be taken to one of my fashion magazine companies where you'll do some photo shoots for the next edition.\"</p><p>Dorothy squealed. \"I've always wanted to see myself in a magazine.</p><p>What do we need to bring?\"</p><p>Masaaki answered. \"Just yourself. Give Emiko your sizes on the way out. We'll have wardrobe people, hair stylists and makeup artists waiting your arrival.\"</p><p>Dorothy reached over and squeezed Shaundra's arm in delight.</p><p>Shaundra didn't seem at all excited about the upcoming photo shoot. In fact, she looked quite dumbfounded. He suspected she was still a bit overwhelmed by it all. Harper had explained that she was a bit reclusive.</p><p>She was calm and composed and just taking it all in.</p><p>Someone knocked at the door for the third time. This time, Aomori entered. The two female Asian writers and the American author, Dorothy, started fanning themselves frantically with their hands. Shaundra seemed to shrink deeper into her chair. The first reaction he expected since women always did that when they first saw Aomori. The second reaction, he did not expect. Was Ms. Morrison shy? \"Come on in and meet everyone,\" Goro told the young men.</p><p>Masaaki looked them over as they entered. Luckily, they had taken the time to dress appropriately. Normally, they would just toss on some jeans and T-shirts, even though they had fancy clothes at their disposal. Today, each was dressed in suits with their hair combed, and in dress shoes no less. He wondered what was up and whose idea it was.</p><p>\"Ladies and gentlemen, this is Aomori. From the front, the group leader, Yori Morioka and lead vocalist; Satoshi Hayashi, piano player and tenor; Takumijo Yamazaki, bass-baritone and lead choreographer, and last but not least, Ichiro Yoshida, tenor and music composer.\"</p><p>The band members bowed to their guests.</p><p>\"Have a seat,\" Goro told them. \"I'll introduce the others.\"</p><p>Yori sat down in a vacant seat next to Shaundra Morrison while the others sat on the opposite side of the table as Goro introduced the authors to the singers. Once Goro finished, he caught the singers up on what they'd missed.</p><p>\"So, what's on the agenda for tonight and tomorrow?\" Harper asked.</p><p>\"Mr. Niigata has arranged for you to see Tokyo's nightspots, and tomorrow, a tour of the city,\" Masaaki explained.</p><p>\"Clubbing?\" Izanami Kudo asked. It was the first time she'd spoken.</p><p>\"Yes, do you have a problem with that?\" Masaaki asked.</p><p>\"No, it's just that, well, won't Aomori be mobbed when someone recognizes them?\"</p><p>\"We've already taken care of this, and they never travel anywhere without guards.\"</p><p>Dorothy looked around the room like she expected to see some guards hovering nearby.</p><p>\"They're positioned outside in the lobby. We have to protect them from our other employees as well. You'd be surprised how many, male and female, want to get next to these young men.\"</p><p>\"Can't say that I blame them,\" Dorothy admitted. \"They're gorgeous.\"</p><p>Satoshi stifled a chuckle and Ichiro blushed. The other two singers didn't respond because they were smart enough to know better, but Masaaki could imagine what they were thinking. He'd have to protect them from this one too. Make a note to self - don't allow band members to be smothered by old cougar.</p><p>\"Clubbing? What the hell am I going to wear?\" Shaundra asked as she went through the dresses she had brought along for the trip.</p><p>Someone knocked at her door. Shaundra left her bedroom to answer it.</p><p>The bell boy who had assisted her with her luggage stood on the other side carrying two large boxes.</p><p>\"What's this?\"</p><p>\"Mr. Kehoe sent these,\" the young man explained. \"He said it's for you to wear tonight.\" Shaundra took the boxes from him and placed them on a table in the suite's living room, got her purse to tip him, and then closed the door behind him when he left. She picked up the boxes and carried them into the bedroom \"What in the world?\" she asked, staring down at them. \"What did he go and do?\" She opened the first box and gasped. Inside was a black mini dress, matching black underwear, and stockings. \"Oh no, he didn't.\" She held the dress up to her and walked over to the mirror. \"This is positively shocking. I'm going to be run out of town in this.\" She twirled around, still holding the dress up to her. \"It's cute...for a twenty- year-old.\" She laid the dress out on the bed so it wouldn't wrinkle and then examined the underwear. \"French cut and just the correct size.</p><p>Deviant.\" The other box contained a pair of high heeled, black, strappy pumps, size eight and a half, and a matching black clutch. There were also silver earrings, bracelets and a necklace. \"Hmm, he's going out of his way to impress someone.\"</p><p>A card fell out of the tissue as she pulled it out of the box. \"I expect to see you in this tonight and I don't want any of your sass about being fifty,\"</p><p>signed Harper.</p><p>Shaundra cracked a smile. Her publisher knew her very well. \"Oh, I guess I don't have any other choice.\" She wondered if he supplied clothes for the other writers as well. Hopefully, he allowed someone else to choose Dorothy's clothes.</p><p>The telephone rang.</p><p>Shaundra moved away from the bed to answer it. \"Hello.\"</p><p>\"Hey, Mama.\"</p><p>It was Tricia, her youngest daughter.</p><p>\"Hey baby, what's up?\"</p><p>\"How's Japan?\"</p><p>\"I don't really know. I haven't seen much of it yet. We arrived late last night and I'm still out of sorts from the time change.\" She paused. \"So how are things back home?\"</p><p>\"Pretty much how you left it. Juanda is still upset that you left town and left her with the twins, and of course, Donald called.\"</p><p>\"What did he want?\" It irked her to no end how he called behind her.</p><p>\"He just wanted to know if you arrived safely.\"</p><p>\"I left him a message when I arrived, just like I left one for you, Juanda, and the boys. It's not my fault he didn't return the call.\"</p><p>\"When are you going to end it with him? It's obvious even to me that it's been over between the two of you for quite some time.\"</p><p>Shaundra sighed. \"You're right. I guess I'll do it when I get back. In the meantime, don't feed him any unnecessary information.\"</p><p>\"You mean about you and Harper?\"</p><p>\"There's no me and Harper.\"</p><p>\"Um hmm,\" Tricia replied like she was older and wiser than her twenty-four years. \"You're just saying that because you think we'll go all militant because he's a white man.\"</p><p>\"No I'm not. Besides, I brought all of you up not to let something like that be an issue. Harper's my boss and nothing else.\"</p><p>\"But you'd like it to be something else?\"</p><p>\"No, I mean, I don't know. He's handsome, rich and he picks out nice dresses.\"</p><p>\"Huh?\"</p><p>\"Never mind.\"</p><p>\"You're going to fill me in later, aren't you?\"</p><p>\"Yes, but right now, I have to get off this phone and get dressed.\"</p><p>\"Where are you going?\"</p><p>\"Out clubbing.\"</p><p>Tricia giggled. \"Don't break anything and don't get drunk.\"</p><p>\"Who is the parent here?\"</p><p>Tricia giggled again. \"Who are you going clubbing with?\"</p><p>\"A bunch of authors. We'll be lucky if they don't toss our old butts out.\"</p><p>\"Have fun.\"</p><p>\"I'll try to call you when I get back if it's not too late.\"</p><p>\"Bye, Mama.\"</p><p>\"Bye, baby.\" Shaundra hung up the phone and trotted off to the bathroom for a bath in the luxurious sunken tub. Sometimes being a writer really did have some cool perks. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Shaundra guessed Harper liked the way the dress fit her from the way he stopped talking in midsentence the moment she exited the elevator and walked into the lobby to meet him and the others. Even Jackson smiled wickedly at her.</p><p>Shaundra pulled at the hem, which didn't do any good since there wasn't much dress. The high heels probably made it look shorter and she was thankful for the hose. She hated to be all dressed up with bare legs.</p><p>\"Ooh, look at you,\" Riley commented. \"Who would have thought you were hiding that killer body beneath those business suits?\"</p><p>Shaundra rolled her eyes at him. \"Let's get this over with before I get arrested.\"</p> <p>Dorothy walked up to her. \"Honey, if I had your body, I'd be exposing more than that.\" Of course, she could say that. Dorothy was nicely dressed in a blue pants suit, tan pumps and accessories. The men looked sleek in their lightweight suits and matching ties. She had to give it to Harper. He did have excellent taste in clothing.</p><p>The limousine driver waited. They entered the car and the driver drove away from the curb. He turned on the stereo and Japanese pop music filtered out of all the speakers. Shaundra had to admit that some of the songs sounded pretty good. Not understanding the words wasn't a problem as long as she could move to the rhythm of the music.</p><p>The driver drove them to a club located in Shibuya. They exited the car and gathered stares from a line of young people curious to see who was arriving in the limousine. Some of them seemed disappointed not to recognize them.</p><p>Japanese youngsters with ages ranging from early twenties to early thirties stood in line waiting to enter. Jackson and Riley would fit right in, she thought as they walked to the back of the line. The young people were dressed in popular club clothes. The women had on short dresses and high heels while the men donned suits or casual clothes they could dance in.</p><p>Most of them had cell phones up to their ears or in their hands, texting.</p> <p>The line moved swiftly despite their dawdling and preoccupation with technology.</p><p>The music filtered out through the door each time it opened. It was loud, but she guessed it had to be that way. Inside, the place looked like most clubs back home, except most of the patrons were Asian. The disk jockey was tearing up the place, spinning records and talking to the crowd.</p><p>Dancers were on the floor, sweating and shaking with delight. Harper found them a couple of tables and they sat down, leaving enough room for the other singers and Aomori.</p><p>A waitress appeared to get their drink order. Shaundra wasn't much of a drinker. She ordered a soda while the others ordered alcohol.</p><p>\"There are the other authors,\" Harper told then over the din of the music and the noise. He waved them over.</p><p>The young women wore mini dresses and high heels and the men dressed similarly to the male writers in suits, minus the ties. They sat down at the table and ordered drinks when the waitress returned with their order. That only left Aomori. Shaundra wondered how they were going to pull this off and not draw attention to themselves.</p> <p>Masaaki Fugimoto entered the lounge and looked around the room until he spotted them. He joined them at the table. \"I'm glad you made it.</p><p>What do you think of the place?\"</p><p>\"It's nice,\" Dorothy answered for the group. \"Lot of young people who like to party.\"</p><p>Masaaki nodded. \"We come here sometimes when we are in Tokyo and Mr. Niigata gives us time off.\" The waitress returned with the Asian authors' drinks and then went off again to get a beer for Masaaki.</p><p>\"Where's Aomori?\" Riley asked after he drew his eyes off a young woman near the bar he'd been watching since they arrived.</p><p>\"They are on their way,\" Masaaki replied.</p><p>Aomori entered a few minutes later, accompanied by their bodyguards, and made a beeline for a table across from the authors. They were still recognizable even under the disguises. There was just no way to hide perfection. Shaundra sighed. One of them even waved at the disk jockey, a Japanese man with a blond Mohawk haircut. The disk jockey waved back, but did not call out Takumijo's name.</p><p>Satoshi, Yori and Takumijo were quickly set upon by three young women who persuaded them to join them on the dance floor. A fourth approached Ichiro, but he turned her down, which Shaundra thought odd.</p> <p>In her day, there'd be this one girl...a plain Jane or a wallflower who would be left behind at the table guarding purses and watching drinks.</p><p>There was nothing plain about Ichiro. Even from where she sat, she could see how handsome he was behind his disguise. She'd noticed it a little too much during their meeting with Mr. Niigata.</p><p>Ichiro had tiny perfect features, creamy unblemished porcelain skin and a lithe frame. He also had blue eyes, a rarity in Japanese. His movements were graceful. That's what she'd seen as she sat across from him yesterday at the meeting. If he'd been a woman, she would have had to consider him beautiful. The others were stunning, too, but they were not as feminine-looking as Ichiro. Damn, why did this bother her so? It wasn't like they were her type. She liked strong, rugged men with rippling muscles and strong enough to toss a bull. Aomori was tall and had muscle, but they had a delicacy about them...like they needed to be protected. Did being lovely and delicate make them less of a man? For some reason, she didn't think so.</p><p>\"What are you watching so intently?\" Harper asked her once the disk jockey took a break and the dancers returned to their seats.</p><p>\"Ichiro,\" Shaundra replied.</p><p>Everyone at the table turned in his direction and then looked back at her.</p><p>\"What about him?\" Harper asked.</p><p>\"He's the only one who didn't get up to dance even though a young woman asked him.\"</p><p>\"Maybe he can't dance,\" Jackson replied as he picked up his drink.</p><p>\"Ichiro is a quiet one,\" Masaaki explained. \"He's into books and cooking and hopes to one day to be a great restaurateur.\"</p><p>\"I just figured he was gay,\" Jackson said.</p><p>Masaaki chuckled. \"Ichiro? No, I don't think so. He has a bigger female fan base than the other three. He's just the quiet type. I can't wait for you to hear him sing. I was brought to tears the first time I heard him audition. He sang Ave Maria. Took all of us by surprise, including Mr.</p><p>Niigata. No, Ichiro isn't gay or vain. He's just Ichiro. He cooks a mean ramen too.\"</p><p>Shaundra looked over at Ichiro again and found him staring directly at her. She gulped. Those weren't the eyes of a man interested in another man. Nope. Those were the eyes of a man who was interested in her. Shit.</p><p>What am I going to do now? The disk jockey returned and started spinning records again. This time, he chose the American song...Michael Jackson's Smooth Criminal.</p><p>Young people immediately sprung to their feet and headed back to the dance floor. Harper grabbed her hand and rose. \"Come on, let's show these kids a thing a two.\"</p><p>Masaaki moved aside so she could pass by him and, before she knew it she and Harper were on the dance floor dancing like they were two teens.</p><p>Dorothy and Jackson and the Asian authors joined them, leaving Riley and Masaaki alone at the table.</p><p>Harper was surprising light on his feet and knew the latest dance steps, but he was no match for the young Japanese once the disk jockey changed the music back to Japanese pop. Someone tapped him on the shoulder.</p><p>Shaundra looked up. It was Yori.</p><p>\"I would like to dance with Ms. Morrison.\"</p><p>From the look on Harper's face, Shaundra deduced that Yori's bluntness surprised him. \"Sure, if Ms. Morrison doesn't mind.\" \"She doesn't,\" Yori answered for her. He stepped around Harper and took Shaundra's hand.</p><p>Harper looked at her and all she could do was shrug her shoulders.</p><p>Harper gave up and returned to the table.</p><p>\"That was quite rude,\" Shaundra replied as the music changed to a slow number. Yori pulled her into his arms.</p><p>\"What is rude? I just wanted to dance with you.\"</p><p>His English was not as limited as she thought.</p><p>He pressed her closer and her body molded into his. Her head rested comfortably against his chest. His earthy cologne tickled her nose and worked its way through her body like an aphrodisiac. \"But I was already dancing with someone.\"</p><p>\"He's your boss.\"</p><p>\"So?\"</p><p>\"I'm not.\" He flawlessly dipped her and then pulled her back to him.</p><p>She heard clapping, but chose to ignore it. Then, several cameras flashed.</p><p>That, she could not ignore. She stiffened in Yori's arms.</p><p>\"What is wrong?\" he asked.</p><p>\"Someone took a picture of us.\"</p><p>\"So?\"</p><p>\"So? We can't be photographed together.\"</p><p>\"Why not?\"</p><p>\"We just can't. It's not good for our careers.\"</p><p>\"People take pictures of me every day,\" he said. \"What's one more?\"</p><p>He twirled her around and someone got a picture of that too.</p><p>Shaundra tried to look around him to see if she could spot the photographer. Damn, there were just too many people. Maybe Yori was accustomed to having his life in the news, but she wasn't. He escorted her back to the table once the song ended and then went back to his friends.</p><p>\"You're one crazy dude,\" Satoshi said to Yori when he returned to their table. \"Amaya is going to kick our ass for messing with Ms.</p><p>Morrison.\"</p><p>Yori sat down. \"I am not missing with Ms. Morrison. I just like to dance with her. She is pretty good.\"</p><p>\"That dress is smoking,\" Satoshi replied. \"She's put together nicely.\"</p><p>\"I hadn't noticed,\" Yori replied as he sampled his drink.</p><p>\"Liar.\"</p><p>Takumijo watched him intently from across the table. \"Of all the ladies in this club, why her? What's so special about her?\"</p><p>\"There's nothing special. She's a real good dancer and she's tall enough so I don't have to stoop over when we dance slowly.\"</p><p>\"I think she's pretty,\" Ichiro announced.</p><p>Yori glanced over at him. This was a fine time for him to speak. \"Yes, she's very pretty.\"</p><p>\"And she has nice legs.\"</p><p>Yori looked back on the dance floor. Shaundra was dancing with the Asian writer, Hideohi Chiba to DBSK's Miortic and busting some very serious moves. Her \"booty\" bounced sensually beneath the black mini dress. His body stirred. The sight awoke all of his senses. A big behind was something most Asian women lacked.</p><p>\"Hideohi is a real good dancer,\" Satoshi replied. \"The two of them look good together on the dance floor.\"</p><p>Yori rolled his eyes at his friend. Satoshi had a way of prying, but not prying. How could he explain to them why he did the things he did with Shaundra Morrison when he did not understand why he did them? He had to remember that she was here on business and that she was older than he was, and that meant he should not be imagining what it would be like to kiss those full, brown lips.</p><p>A young woman approached the table and asked him to dance. Yori looked up at her. She was Korean, about twenty, with short brown hair and a pretty smile. She'd do. He rose and followed her. Miortic had ended and the disc jockey now played Mystery by B2ST. The young woman was a good dancer, but she lacked rhythm. His eyes wandered back toward the other table. Shaundra had returned and was busy pulling Masaaki to the dance floor. This was a first. Masaaki never danced when he accompanied them to a club, but here he was, moving around the floor with Shaundra and obviously knowing what he was doing.</p><p>The older woman, Dorothy, danced with Harper Kehoe while the other American men guarded the table.</p><p>Yori bowed to his partner after the song ended and returned to his friends. Satoshi and Takumijo were talking about lyrics to some song, but Ichiro continued to stare at the other table. \"What's up, baby brother?\"</p><p>Yori asked him.</p><p>\"Nothing.\" Ichiro lowered his eyes as if embarrassed.</p><p>Yori turned his attention on the group of authors. Shaundra Morrison had her legs crossed and was revealing quite a bit of thigh. That answered his question. Ichiro was embarrassed because he was caught ogling the author's beautiful legs. No problem. At least that answered another question. Ichiro was definitely interested in women, and he had good taste.</p><p>\"Aren't we supposed to be socializing with them?\" Satoshi asked. \"Or at least sitting with them?\"</p><p>\"Probably,\" Yori answered. He had entertained the idea when they first arrived, but not so much now that he knew that Shaundra was camera shy and that Ichiro was interested in her. He didn't want to make either of them uncomfortable. \"But this seems to be working out fine for all of us.</p><p>We're close enough.\"</p><p>Satoshi rose.</p><p>\"Where are you going?\"</p><p>\"To ask Ms. Morrison to dance.\"</p><p>\"Why?\" Takumijo asked.</p><p>\"Because I feel like it.\" Satoshi strolled over to the other table.</p><p>Shaundra looked over toward them and then accepted.</p><p>Yori lowered his sunglasses, looked over at her, and then pushed the glasses up and pretended disinterest.</p><p>\"Would you like to join us for dinner?\" Masaaki asked everyone at the table once they'd given up dancing and were all nursing sore feet. He'd just returned after receiving a phone call.</p><p>Harper looked around to see if everyone was in agreement. Heads nodded up and down furiously.</p><p>\"Good. I'm starved and my head hurts from the noise.\"</p><p>Shaundra found his bluntness comical.</p><p>Masaaki pulled out his cell phone and dialed a number. \"Tell the boys we are leaving for dinner.\" He hung up and rose, signaling to one of the guards. The guard leaned over and said something to Yori, who, in turn, told the other three. The four young men rose and walked around the dance floor until they arrived at the table with the authors. \"We're all going out to dinner,\" Masaaki announced. He turned and everyone followed him out of the club.</p><p>\"Where are we going?\" Riley asked Harper as Masaaki began to walk.</p><p>\"I have no idea. Since they're Japanese, I think it's safe to say that we're going to a Japanese restaurant.\"</p><p>The idea both delighted and frightened Shaundra. To eat authentic Japanese food would be fun and interesting. She just hoped she wasn't required to use chopsticks. She'd hate to waste anything on her dress.</p><p>Shaundra and Harper caught up with Masaaki. \"Where are the limousines?\" Harper asked.</p><p>\"I sent them ahead to the restaurant parking lot. Too much traffic.\"</p><p>They stood on a busy sidewalk near the club and waited for the others to catch up. Bumper to bumper traffic passed on the street before them.</p><p>\"So, how are we supposed to get there?\" Harper asked.</p><p>\"Walk,\" Masaaki answered him. \"It's just three blocks away.\"</p><p>The announcement was met with several groans from the Americans.</p><p>Shaundra looked down at her heels. Had she known, she would have opted for different shoes.</p><p>\"Shibuya is beautiful by night,\" Masaaki explained as they began walking again down Dogenzaka. They had enough people with them to be considered a tour group. The only problem they had was moving quickly amongst the hundreds of people out walking with them.</p><p>\"What is this area called?\" Jackson asked as he looked around like a kid.</p><p>\"Center Gai,\" Masaaki explained. They walked through a narrow street, which had a Starbucks. \"It is the birthplace of many fashion trends.\" They passed by a busy pedestrian zone lined with stores, boutiques, nightclubs and restaurants. He took them pass Tuntanna Silver Shop, a small cafe and a Sapporo ramen restaurant. \"Over there is Shibuya Station,\" Masaaki continued to explain. He pointed. People exited it as he spoke.</p><p>Shaundra looked up. There were three huge televisions screens attached to the sides of three buildings. As if by magic, they all three began playing the same announcement simultaneously.</p><p>\"Look, it's our commercial,\" Takumijo said to Yori and the others.</p><p>Everyone stopped and watched the promotion for Aomori's upcoming concerts at the Tokyo Dome. It featured a couple of clips from their previous concerts. Harper told them that they were all going to attend. She didn't like the idea at first, but the promotion had peaked her interest, especially when she'd seen Aomori in costume.</p><p>They started walking again once the commercial ended, stopping at a corner. Traffic came to a complete stop from every direction to allow for the massive crowd of walkers to cross the streets safely. This would never happen back home, she mused as she walked alongside Dorothy. Drivers weren't that courteous. She looked back. Aomori had stopped and were looking through a big glass window. They spoke to each other rapidly in Japanese.</p><p>\"Arcade,\" Masaaki explained. \"They're still just boys at heart.\"</p><p>Aomori rejoined them shortly. Yori ended up at her left with Satoshi at her right while the others sort of blended into the crowd. They passed another building. Shaundra stopped to look at it. There weren't any windows to the place, just a door. \"What's this place?\"</p><p>Several of the Asians laughed.</p><p>\"What's so funny?\" she asked as she walked around to inspect it.</p><p>Yori took her hand and led her away. \"This is love hotel.\"</p><p>\"Love hotel? Who would rent a room in a place with no windows?\"</p><p>\"Lovers,\" Yori explained.</p><p>Shaundra did not understand at first. \"Oh!\"</p><p>The Asians continued to laugh at her naivety.</p><p>\"In the middle of a shopping district?\"</p><p>\"It's very discrete,\" Satoshi said, looking down at her and Yori's interlocked hands.</p><p>Shaundra pulled her hand away. \"You mean it's for secret liaisons?\"</p><p>\"We have a lot of lonely single men in Japan.\"</p><p>There was no way Satoshi or any of Aomori had to visit a place like that. She couldn't imagine them lacking companionship.</p><p>\"It's a very lucrative business,\" Masaaki explained. \"It is operated solely for the purpose of allowing couples privacy to have sexual intercourse. It's windowless so no one can see in. There is minimal interaction with the staff, and the bills are paid through the use of pneumatic tubes or given to a pair of hands behind a pane of frosted glass.\"</p><p>She looked back, half expecting to see scantily clad prostitutes lurking about. They walked past another strip of shops with tiny cafes that served snacks and coffee, clothing shops and more video arcades before Masaaki turned the corner and stopped in front of a restaurant. There was also a long line of people waiting to go inside.</p><p>\"Maybe we should have made reservations,\" Dorothy replied.</p><p>\"Already taken care of,\" Masaaki answered. \"Mr. Niigata has planned ahead.\" He walked away from them and to the front of the line to speak with the young woman at the door. He signaled for them to follow him in.</p><p>Shaundra expected some groans from the waiting crowd, but they didn't offer a peep.</p><p>Delicious aromas assaulted her nostrils as soon as she stepped into the waiting area. Masaaki spoke with the kimono dressed hostess who led them into the restaurant to a large room in the back. Shaundra was thankful to see chairs because she doubted that she could sit down on cushions in the mini dress without flashing everyone.</p><p>Each little area had a small hibachi grill place in front of them.</p><p>Surprisingly enough, the waitress positioned them in an odd seating arrangement with Yori at her right and Ichiro at her left. The impact of their colognes sent conflicting emotions through her body. Damn, what are they wearing? Usually, cologne and body sprays made her cough.</p><p>Thankfully, not this time, she mused as she crossed her legs at her ankles to ignore her raging hormones and dampening panties. This is so embarrassing.</p><p>\"Is something wrong, Ms. Morrison?\" Chirau Narita asked from across the table. \"You look a bit flushed.\" Chirau was seated across the table from her between Satoshi and Riley and her cheeks were very rosy too.</p><p>Shaundra looked down shyly. \"No, it's probably from the heat of the grill.\"</p><p>Chirau giggled. \"Yes, I know exactly what you mean.\"</p><p>Shaundra rose. \"Excuse me a minute. I need to use the little girl's room.\"</p><p>\"I'll go with you,\" Dorothy replied, hopping up from her seat between Harper and Masaaki.</p><p>Dorothy was standing next to her before she could reply. They had to walk out of the room and back into the main dining room to access the ladies room. Shaundra pushed the door open slowly so she wouldn't knock anyone down. There were a couple of ladies standing before mirrors fixing their hair and makeup. Shaundra ducked into one stall while she heard Dorothy go into the one next to her. She really didn't have to go, but she needed to get some air and quiet the thoughts in her head. Her bladder complied to justify with Dorothy that she had to go. The next thing she knew, both she and Dorothy were standing at the sink washing their hands.</p><p>Dorothy dried her hands under the blow dryer. \"He's cute,\" she replied.</p><p>\"Who?\"</p><p>\"Ichiro.\"</p><p>\"Oh, him. Well, I think the correct description is beautiful.\" She pressed the button on the dryer.</p><p>\"Have you ever seen guys as handsome as those four?\"</p><p>Shaundra rubbed her hands vigorously under the air to dry them. \"No, I haven't. Where the hell were men like that when I was in my twenties?\"</p><p>\"These weren't born yet,\" Dorothy said into a girlish chuckle. \"He likes you.\"</p><p>\"Who?\" Shaundra asked as she stepped over to the mirror to check her hair and makeup.</p><p>\"Ichiro.\"</p><p>\"Huh?\"</p><p>\"Don't tell me you haven't noticed the way he's been watching you.\"</p><p>\"No, I haven't,\" she lied. \"He's just a kid.\"</p><p>\"So is Yori.\"</p><p>Ah hell, where is this conversation leading? \"I'm flattered, but I didn't come all the way to Tokyo to get involved in some scandalous triangle with two Japanese pop stars.\"</p><p>Dorothy hugged herself and giggled with glee. \"Wow, wouldn't that make one hell of a novel premise?\"</p><p>\"Probably.\" She finished with her hair, and washed and dried her hands again. \"We'd better get back before they think we've fallen in or something,\" Shaundra said, changing the subject. She led the way to the door and Dorothy followed.</p><p>\"Do you think I can get one of them interested in me? You know, if you're not in interested in dating either one.\"</p><p>\"Sure. You're a pretty nice lady, but don't be disappointed if it doesn't happen. They have some pretty strange customs in some of these places where they can only date their own race, or worse, they have to stay pure until they're married.\"</p><p>\"Yuck. What an antiquated, Victorian idea.\" They re-entered the dining area. The waiter had arrived with the food and there were several red-clad chefs preparing meat on the hibachis. Shaundra and Dorothy scooted back into their seats as the chef set the meat on plates and passed them around to the diners. The waiters returned with steamed rice and soups. Everything looked delicious.</p><p>\"Ooh, what's that?\" Shaundra asked.</p><p>\"Yakimono,\" Ichiro answered. \"Grilled fish.\" Mostly everyone stopped what they were doing when they heard him speak.</p><p>Shaundra looked over at him and smiled.</p><p>Ichiro shook his bangs back out of his eyes, revealing his adorable face and capturing her full attention. He began scooping some of the fish into a bowl and then he reached for Shaundra's set of chopsticks, opened them and began feeding her.</p><p>Shaundra chewed, never removing her stare from his. She swallowed.</p><p>\"Thank you. It is very delicious.\"</p><p>Ichiro handed the chopsticks to her.</p><p>\"I don't know how to use them.\"</p><p>\"Let me show you.\"</p><p>Those were the most words she'd heard him say since she met him.</p><p>She pitied the world for not hearing his silky and mesmerizing voice. She bet there were a lot of wet panties in the audience when he performed.</p><p>Ichiro demonstrated how to use the chopsticks and then reached them back to her to try.</p><p>Shaundra lifted the chopsticks, noticing the stares she was receiving from around the table. She maneuvered the sticks between her fingers, ignoring the onlookers, picked up the meat between the two sticks and put it into her mouth without spilling.</p><p>\"See, I knew you could do it,\" Ichiro replied with an impish smile.</p><p>Shaundra smiled back at him. \"I can manage big things, but what about rice?\"</p><p>Ichiro picked up his bowl to demonstrate. \"The object is not to waste.\"</p><p>He put the bowl closer to his mouth.</p><p>Shaundra followed his movements up to his lips, checking out their fullness as he shoveled the rice into his mouth. Ichiro lowered the bowl, licking the rice residue from his bottom lip. That little movement nearly stole her breath away. \"I feel so silly. I thought I had to pick up the rice with the sticks.\"</p><p>\"Ichiro is a very good teacher,\" Yori said from her right. \"And very talkative this evening.\"</p><p>\"Ms. Morrison brings out the best in him,\" Masaaki replied from his seat as he speared a piece of roasted meat. \"Maybe we should arrange for her to join him when he is composing music. I have a feeling she can be his muse.\"</p><p>Ichiro flushed pink at the collar and went silent. His hair covered most of his angelic face again.</p><p>\"He's blushing,\" Jackson replied. \"I like that.\"</p><p>Shaundra thought Jackson's statement embarrassed Ichiro even more.</p><p>\"I think I'd like to watch him rehearse,\" Shaundra replied.</p><p>\"That can be done,\" Masaaki said between chews. \"They are rehearsing after the photo shoot tomorrow. I'll arrange for you to be there if the band doesn't have a problem with you watching them.\"</p><p>\"I don't have a problem,\" Satoshi replied as he picked up his bowl of rice.</p><p>\"Neither do I,\" Yori stated.</p><p>Takumijo did not answer. He just pretended indifference, an act she'd witnessed a lot that evening.</p><p>\"Then it is settled,\" Masaaki replied.</p><p>\"What about the rest of us?\" Dorothy asked.</p><p>\"Anyone who wants to come,\" Masaaki told her. \"But you have to be very quiet and not get into their way. \" \"I promise.\"</p><p>Neither the men nor the Asian writers seemed enthusiastic about attending the rehearsal. Shaundra went back to her food acutely aware that a male knee touched her from both sides beneath the table. Heat radiated up through her body. She finished eating without much waste. The meal was followed up by a cup of hot tea. The evening ended once Masaaki settled the bill and called for the drivers. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\"Ichiro likes Shaundra,\" Takumijo teased in the car on the way back to the hotel.</p><p>Ichiro blushed and Satoshi pulled his hair. \"I believe he does. Who would have thought that Ichiro would make such a suave move on her? Feeding a woman is a very sensual act.\"</p><p>\"I just showed her how to use chopsticks. It's called common courtesy.\"</p><p>\"Yes, but you also fed her some fish first. I'm jealous. You never show me such attention.\" Satoshi teased.</p> <p>Ichiro buried deeper into the seat.</p><p>\"You better be on your best behavior tomorrow, Ichiro, and none of your silent routine. You're going to have to talk to both those women since its apparent the're coming to see you rehearse.\"</p><p>\"Leave him alone,\" Yori said once he got tired or them teasing Ichiro.</p><p>He could see his friend's blush deepen even in the dark limousine.</p><p>\"You should be jealous,\" Takumijo told Yori. \"He just moved in on your girl.\"</p> <p>\"Ms. Morrison is not my girl.\" Then why did he feel so betrayed? Yori berated himself for his jealousy. He'd never seen Ichiro so happy. His cell phone vibrated in his pocket. Yori lifted it out and answered it. \"Hello.\"</p><p>\"Hello, Yori.\"</p><p>It was Amaya. Why wasn't he surprised? She always had a sixth sense about things. \"Amaya.\" The other three men chuckled loudly in the background.</p><p>\"What's wrong with those idiots?\" Amaya asked.</p><p>Yori smiled. Amaya considered his friends below her and a bad influence on him. \"Just being idiots.\"</p><p>\"What are you doing?\"</p> <p>\"We're on our way back to the hotel. Masaaki took us out to dinner.\"</p><p>\"When are you coming home?\"</p><p>Here it goes. Amaya didn't like him on the road so much. She kept asking him to leave the group, which he always refused. This was his job.</p><p>Sure, he had a business degree, but what good was it without any marketable skills? He'd been a part of a singing group since he was a child and these idiots, as she called them, were his family. They'd been there for him when she hadn't. \"Not for another couple of months. After the tour is over.\"</p><p>\"Can't you sneak away before then? I miss you and my friends think you're fooling around with your female fans.\"</p><p>Yori rubbed his temple as a headache attacked him. \"Have they actually seen me messing around with anyone?\"</p><p>His three friends laughed loudly again as they eavesdropped on his conversation.</p><p>\"No, but Kikio is sure that you are. She says a lot of pretty girls throw themselves at your feet at concerts.\"</p> <p>\"Kikio is crazy. The guards don't let fans get near the stage. You've been to our concerts. You know what happens there.\" The fact that she hadn't come to one of his concerts in a long time still hurt his feelings. She was too busy now that she attended the university. Learning fashion designing and joining her family's fashion business was now as important to her as Aomori was to him.</p><p>The conversation continued with her telling him about what her folks thought about his career and their future together. Yori sighed. He'd heard it all a thousand times before. Their plan to marry hadn't changed. It had just been pushed back for a while. No one, including him, knew that Aomori would be this big and have such a large following. \"Look, I'll call you once I get up to my room,\" Yori told Amaya. He disconnected the call.</p><p>The chauffer entered the driveway in front of the hotel and stopped in front of the door. Another limousine with the Americans drove in behind them and everyone exited both cars. The driver left to park the cars in the garage.</p><p>Satoshi, Takumijo and Ichiro headed directly for the elevators, along with the others. Yori noticed that Shaundra remained in the lobby and then headed for the registration desk. He lagged behind to see what she was up to.</p><p>\"Do you have an Ethernet wire?\" she asked the lady behind the desk.</p><p>The other woman nodded, bent behind the desk and came back up with a wire for Shaundra.</p><p>\"Thanks. I'll return it when I check out.\" Shaundra moved from the desk and nearly ran into him. \"Oh, you startled me.\"</p><p>\"Are you ready to go up to your room?\"</p><p>\"Is that why you waited? You didn't have to do that. I know my way up.\"</p><p>\"It's late and it's not safe.\" He followed her toward the elevator. \"Are you planning to work tonight?\" He pointed to the Ethernet wire.</p><p>\"Yes, I need to work on my new novel.\"</p><p>\"Can't it wait until tomorrow?\"</p><p>\"It's already tomorrow.\"</p><p>The elevator arrived and opened. Shaundra entered first and he followed her inside. Yori pressed the button for their floor and then they rode up in silence. When the elevator stopped, he exited first to make sure no one lurked in the halls.</p><p>\"I had a really nice time,\" Shaundra said, striking up conversation as they walked. \"I haven't danced so much in years.\"</p><p>\"Why not?\" Yori asked as they turned a curve.</p><p>\"Because I'm getting too old to go out clubbing.\"</p><p>\"You're not that old.\"</p><p>\"I have three children older than you are.\"</p><p>\"Three? You don't look old enough to have three kids.\"</p><p>\"I have four. My youngest daughter is your age. \" Four kids. She must be very fertile. \"Do you plan to have a fifth?\"</p><p>Shaundra laughed. \"Not in this lifetime.\"</p><p>\"Don't you like children?\"</p><p>\"I love children, but I'm too old to have any more, and now it's my time to have a life.\"</p><p>\"Do kids stop you from having a life?\"</p><p>\"In a way. You'll find out once you get married and start raising a family. When my children were small, I had to spend a lot of time with them, making sure they ate and did their homework. I spent almost all of my waking hours with them. Now I'm free to do anything or go anywhere I want to.\"</p><p>He supposed what she said was true. He had a lot of responsibilities now that stopped him from having a normal life. It would probably get more time consuming once he married Amaya.</p><p>\"We're here,\" Shaundra announced outside her door. \"Thanks for a lovely evening and for making sure I made it safely back to my room.\"</p><p>Yori bowed respectfully. On his way up, he took her hand, brought it up to his lips and kissed it. \"I look forward to seeing you at the photo shoot later on,\" he replied. He let go of her hand and continued his walk to his room.</p><p>Harper pushed the red button on the telephone to retrieve his messages. He unloosened his tie, removed it and then tossed it on the dresser. There were three calls, one from his kids asking him about Japan, one from his ex-wife asking him to increase her spousal support and a third one from a very frantic Charlotte. He returned the call to his boys, but not his ex-wife. She wasn't getting another penny out of him. Their sons were grown and if she needed more money, she would just have to get off her ass and get a job. Harper looked down at his watch. It was close to one o'clock in the morning in Japan, which meant it was three in the afternoon back home. He dialed Charlotte's office phone number.</p><p>\"Hello?\"</p><p>\"Hello, gorgeous.\"</p><p>\"Harper, is that you?\"</p><p>\"How many men call you gorgeous?\" he teased his senior editor. They had been together for years and had a very relaxed relationship.</p><p>\"Quite a few,\" she replied back sarcastically. \"What are you and Shaundra Morrison doing in Japan?\"</p><p>\"Working, or have you forgotten that we are on a promotion tour?\"</p><p>\"What kind of promoting are you doing at a nightclub?\"</p><p>\"How do you know that we were at a nightclub?\"</p><p>\"It's all over the Internet. You, Shaundra, Dorothy and Aomori are dancing it up in a Japanese nightclub. What is Shaundra wearing?\"</p><p>\"A very beautiful dress,\" Harper replied. \"Black and very short.\"</p><p>\"That's exactly what I'm talking about. Have you guys lost your minds? Shaundra does not wear mini dresses and spiked heels. She's business suits and conservative shoes.\"</p><p>\"That's the old Shaundra. The new Shaundra wears mini dresses and dances.\"</p><p>\"Why do I smell your handiwork in this scenario?\"</p><p>\"The dress was a present from me. Mr. Niigata arranged an outing with all of us and I knew she wouldn't bring party clothes with her because she is all about the work.\"</p><p>\"Couldn't you pick her out something more appropriate for her age? The dress is so short I can see the dimples in her ass.\"</p><p>Harper chuckled into the receiver.</p><p>\"Shaundra is bouncing around the dance floor with you and one of those singers in one video and slow dancing with the lead singer in another.\"</p><p>\"Stop panicking, and since when do you watch YouTube?\"</p><p>\"Since I don't have a life. I was uploading book trailers for our authors' upcoming releases.\"</p><p>\"And you just happen to find the ones with us on it?\"</p><p>\"It's on the front page of the website. The one with you on it has had several visits...close to a thousand.\"</p><p>He could hear her fingers on her keyboard as she surfed through YouTube. \"You mean I'm a YouTube success?\"</p><p>\"This isn't funny, Harper. Think about Kehoe Publishing. Do you want to be the laughing stock of New York?\"</p><p>\"Calm down, Charlotte. Of course I don't. I'll have YouTube pull the videos.\" He paused. \"Thousands of hits. It's only been a couple of hours since we left the club.\"</p><p>\"The one with Shaundra and Yori Morioka has more than that. The fan girls are going crazy. You should read some of their comments. They don't like the fact that their favorite idol is having a fling with an older American writer.\"</p><p>\"They are not having a fling,\" Harper replied. \"They are just dancing.</p><p>We didn't even share a table with them.\"</p><p>\"You better fix this,\" Charlotte told him. \"Now go to bed.\"</p><p>\"Yes, Charlotte. I'll fix it and then I'll go off to sleep.\" Harper disconnected the call. He got off the bed, walked over to his closet and took out his laptop. He hooked it to the Ethernet wire on the desk and waited for it to turn on, and then he went directly to YouTube. Sure enough, their videos were on the front of the page. He clicked on the one with him and Shaundra and viewed it.</p><p>\"Mother, that dress is simply scandalous,\" Juanda, her eldest daughter, said to her once she returned her call.</p><p>It's a wonder she was able to pick up the phone after that heart- stopping kiss Yori bestowed on her a couple of minutes ago. \"What dress?\"</p><p>\"The one you had on in that nightclub while you were dancing with Harper.\"</p><p>\"I still don't know what you're talking about?\"</p><p>\"You are on YouTube dancing in a black mini dress. I can make out everything you own very clearly, if you know what I mean?\"</p><p>Shaundra gasped. \"I'm on YouTube?\" She'd known something like this was going to happen when that camera took their picture.</p><p>\"Yes, you, Harper, and some long-haired Asian guys. Have you completely lost your mind?\"</p><p>\"Hold on, let me get my laptop.\" Shaundra made a beeline to the desk, hooked the Ethernet wire to her laptop and turned it on. Moments later, she was on the Internet and typing in YouTube. \"Damn.\" She didn't have to search far. She had made the front page. Her fingers touched the link.</p><p>\"Oh my God.\" She clicked on another link...the one with her and Yori.</p><p>\"I'm dead.\" Shaundra went back to the phone. \"Are you still there?\" she asked Juanda.</p><p>\"Where do you think I'm going?\"</p><p>Sometimes she wondered how she'd given birth to such a smart-alecky child.</p><p>\"Did you see the videos?\"</p><p>\"Yes,\" Shaundra replied. \"What do you want me to say? We all went out clubbing tonight. I had no idea someone was taping us.\"</p><p>\"Mother, this is scandalous. You are fifty years old. You should not be out dancing and having a good time.\"</p><p>Shaundra sat down on the edge of the bed. \"What am I supposed to be doing?\"</p><p>\"You're supposed be home being a grandmother.\"</p><p>\"You mean being a baby-sitter so you can go out dancing.\"</p><p>\"Yes. You had your fun when you were young so now it's our time.\"</p><p>Such an ungrateful child. \"You should have thought about having that kind of life before you gave birth to those twins. And as for me having fun when I was young, that never happened because I was busy being a mother and holding down a full-time job. Yes, those videos are quite shocking, but I'm a grown woman and if I want to have my ass nearly out in a mini dress, or dance with some handsome men, I can do it.\"</p><p>\"I didn't mean it that way.\"</p><p>\"Yes, you did. You never say what you don't mean.\"</p><p>\"Who is that Asian guy you're slow dancing with?\"</p><p>\"His name is Yori Morioka. He's the lead singer of Asia's most famous pop band, Aomori.\"</p><p>\"How do you know him? Is that the real reason you went off to Japan?\"</p><p>Shaundra shook her head. It was going to be one of those conversations. Maybe she shouldn't have let Juanda visit her father's people when she was younger. Most of her ways she'd obtained from them. \"Harper and a man named Goro Niigata has formed a publishing partnership over in Japan. Mr. Niigata also runs this big entertainment organization in Osaka. Aomori is one of the groups that he has under contract. So, to make a long story short, the two publishing giants have decided to use four American authors, four Asian authors and Aomori to help promote their new company. We met each other earlier today and Harper suggested we all go out to get to know each other.\"</p><p>\"You look very comfortable in his arms.\"</p><p>\"He is a very good dancer and you know I like to dance. Your father had two left feet.\"</p><p>\"How old is he?\"</p><p>\"I don't know...twenty-four or twenty-five.\"</p><p>Juanda gasped. \"He's younger than I am. My mother is a cougar.\"</p><p>\"Don't think I don't know what that means. You need to stop the dramatics. There is no relationship.\"</p><p>\"What do you know about him?\"</p><p>It was like talking to a box of rocks. \"Not much, but I'm sure you're going to look him up on the Internet after we get off the phone.\"</p><p>\"No, I'm looking up the group now. Oh my, they look like a bunch of girls.\"</p><p>\"This is one of those instances when looks can be deceiving.\"</p><p>\"Are they gay?\"</p><p>\"What difference does that make?\"</p><p>\"Then I could understand why he's dancing with a middle-aged woman instead of some hot young groupie.\"</p><p>\"No, they are not gay. There are a lot of young men out there who like older women.\"</p><p>\"Oh my gawd. My mother is a damn cougar. Donald is just going to flip out when he sees these videos.\"</p><p>\"Donald does not know a thing about computers unless you count a slot machine. You better not tell him.\"</p><p>\"What difference does it make if I tell him or not if nothing is going on between you and the pretty boy?\"</p><p>\"So you're going to sell out your own mother?\"</p><p>\"No, but I won't lie for you either if he does find out.\"</p><p>\"Are you sure you are my child?\"</p><p>\"Yes.\"</p><p>Shaundra yawned. \"Listen, it's late here and I'm getting sleepy. I'll call you when I wake up and we can finish this conversation.\"</p><p>\"Are you trying to get me off the phone because you have a twenty- five year old guy in your bed?\"</p><p>Shaundra laughed. \"If I had a twenty-five year old in my bed I never would have returned your call. Bye.\" She hung up, pissed at her daughter's accusations and narrow-mindedness. What damn difference did it make if Yori was twenty-five and she was fifty? Shaundra groaned. \"It's a big difference.\" In twenty years, he'd be forty-five and in his prime and she'd be seventy with either one foot in the grave or dead.</p><p>Amaya's shrill voice nearly burst Yori's eardrum as he answered the phone in his room. \"Who is that woman you're dancing with on YouTube, Yori? I knew you were cheating on me.\"</p><p>\"What woman?\" Yori asked as he quickly typed YouTube into his laptop and accessed the website. He groaned. \"Shaundra Morrison. She's one of the new authors working for Mr. Niigata. We were at this club to promote our upcoming concert tour and the opening of Mr. Niigata's new publishing company.\"</p><p>\"You told me that Masaaki took you guys out to dinner.\"</p><p>\"He did. All thirteen of us...four American writers, Mr. Niigata's new business partner, four Asian writers and Aomori.\"</p><p>\"That dress she's wearing is positively shocking.\"</p><p>\"There was nothing wrong with her dress. In fact, she looked quite pretty. Anyway, that's what women wear clubbing nowadays. The female Japanese authors wore similar dresses.\" He knew he was digging himself deeper into a hole.</p><p>\"That does not make it right,\" Amaya said in a less shrill tone.</p><p>He still had the headache she'd caused earlier.</p><p>\"So why did you have to dance with her and not let one of the others dance with her like Takumijo?\"</p><p>\"Because I am the leader of Aomori. Takumijo was dancing nearby and so was Satoshi. Nothing inappropriate happened.\"</p><p>\"Then why did only you make YouTube?\"</p><p>\"Maybe because it was one of my fans and not theirs. I don't know, and I don't know why you're making such a big deal about it. I've been on YouTube before hundreds of times.\"</p><p>\"But not like this. You're slow dancing with an older African American woman. Think about your reputation and your career.\"</p><p>\"What about it do you have a problem with? Is it because she's older or is it because she's an African American?\"</p><p>\"Both,\" Amaya answered honestly. \"She is not Japanese. What can you two possibly have in common?\"</p><p>That was true on so many levels and he had just learned that his future bride harbored some deep prejudices. \"We both work for Mr. Niigata.\"</p><p>\"Are you going to see her again?\"</p><p>\"Yes, later on. We're all doing a photo shoot for a magazine.\"</p><p>Amaya cursed in Japanese.</p><p>\"It is part of my job. She is a real nice lady and please don't make a scene.\"</p><p>\"Nice ladies don't dance with other people's fiances.\"</p><p>\"To be fair, she does not know that I am engaged. I do not know her well enough to discuss my personal life with her. It was just a dance.</p><p>Satoshi danced with her too. We were just being courteous.\"</p><p>\"Well, if you say that's all it is, I guess I'll have to take your word for it.\"</p><p>\"Believe me. That's all it is. I will be seeing her and the rest of the authors until this promotion tour is over. Hopefully, this YouTube thing will blow over quickly.\" He yawned. \"I'll call you later after I get some sleep. Mr. Niigata has planned a full day for all of us later.\"</p><p>\"Okay,\" Amaya said. \"Call me later after the photo shoot.\"</p><p>Yori disconnected the call, feeling like a cad for deceiving Amaya and knowing full well she wasn't going to let this drop any time soon. He walked toward the bathroom. If he got his hands on whoever took that video, he'd break their neck. Another disadvantage of being on the top of the charts - someone was always trying to make you tumble down.</p><p>Yori relieved his aching bladder, and then turned on the shower. After he washed, he put on his pajamas and crawled into bed, wondering if any of the others knew about the videos. Takumijo and Satoshi were going to tease him unmercifully for this, if Mr. Niigata and Masaaki didn't kill him first.</p><p>His mind drifted to that little scenario in the hall with Shaundra earlier.</p><p>What had made him do something so forward, and why did he enjoy it after he'd done it? Was he attracted to her or simply jealous of her attentiveness to Ichiro? Both probably.</p><p>He'd lost women to both Takumijo and Satoshi before, but never Ichiro. Hell, what was he thinking? He was not in competition with his fellow band member. So what if she brought out the best in Ichiro? They were friends, and he wanted Ichiro to be happy. Anyway, it would all be over in a month. He could last that long and things would go back to normal.</p><p>But there was the American tour. Would he see Shaundra again when Aomori arrived in New York? No, they'd probably be too busy and she'd be back to her life with her four children.</p><p>Yori closed his eyes and sleep overtook him quickly. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Shaundra drug herself out of bed around nine and went into the bathroom for a quick shower. While she was in there, she removed every strand of hair from her body except for the ones on her head in preparation for the photo shoot. She didn't know what she would be wearing, but she didn't want to gross anyone out with unsightly body hair.</p><p>She pinned her hair up while she dressed casually in a pair of tan slacks and a creme-colored blouse. She topped the outfit with a tan, short- sleeved blazer before slipping her feet into a pair of sandals. \"Not bad for an old broad,\" she said as she checked out herself in a mirror. She really didn't feel fifty...she just felt like Shaundra.</p><p>The telephone rang. \"Hello?\"</p><p>\"Hey, it's Dorothy. Are you ready?\"</p> <p>\"Yes.\"</p><p>\"Good, meet us down in the lobby.\"</p><p>\"Okay.\" Shaundra hung up the phone, grabbed her purse and left her hotel room. She found the others in the lobby talking to Harper.</p><p>\"Aomori left already,\" he announced.</p><p>\"Good,\" Shaundra replied, hoping he hadn't made that little announcement for her benefit. She was glad to see that everyone else was casually dressed, except for Harper who always looked like he fell out of the pages of GQ magazine. They had been instructed not to put on makeup or do their hair. She looked over at Dorothy. The older woman really needed her makeup. Without it, she looked a bit pale.</p> <p>\"I hope they have some nice strong coffee waiting for us,\" Dorothy replied as Harper led them out of the lobby. \"I'm still dragging ass from last night.\"</p><p>\"Don't be disappointed if you only get tea,\" Shaundra teased to lighten the moment.</p><p>\"It will do as long as it has caffeine in it.\"</p><p>They loaded into a van this time, but with the same driver. He turned on the music. Shaundra sat back in her seat and listened to the song. It was a nice ballad. \"I like this,\" she announced. \"Do any of you know who is singing that song?\"</p><p>She was met by blank stares.</p><p>Harper pressed the button for the chauffer.</p> <p>\"Yes, sir?\"</p><p>\"Do you happen to know who is singing that song?\"</p><p>\"Aomori,\" the driver announced.</p><p>\"Thank you,\" Harper replied. He turned his attention back to her.</p><p>\"Satisfied?\"</p><p>Shaundra just smirked at him. She looked out of the window. The windows weren't tinted this time, to her delight, and she finally got a chance to see what Tokyo looked like by daylight.</p><p>\"Look at all those people and cars,\" Harper said as they traveled.</p><p>Tokyo's streets and sidewalks were bustling with people walking, driving cars and riding bikes. Traffic stopped at several intersections to let hordes of people cross. Tokyo also had some of the tallest buildings in the world. \"Can you imagine living here with a population of twelve million people?\" she asked the others.</p> <p>\"Not really,\" Riley replied. \"Texas is pretty big and that was too much for me. I have enough just getting used to New York.\"</p><p>\"It's pretty pricey to live here too,\" Harper added. \"And the apartments are small.\"</p><p>\"I might consider it,\" Jackson replied. \"The technology is phenomenal.</p><p>But I'd probably go broke just trying to keep up with phones, computers and MP3 players.\"</p><p>Shaundra settled back in her seat. It was all so overwhelming. If someone had told her a month ago that she would be halfway across the world in Japan, she'd have called them crazy. Move to Japan, no way. It was unthinkable. Pretty as it was, she didn't do typhoons.</p><p>Harper nudged her. \"I heard we are the hit of YouTube.\"</p><p>Shaundra groaned. She knew it was too much to ask that no one else found out. That little announcement caught everyone's attention. \"Go on, fill them in.\"</p><p>\"Apparently, someone captured the two of us dancing at the club last night and posted it on the Internet. Of course, Charlotte is back home having a fit.\"</p><p>Dorothy laughed.</p><p>\"Don't laugh. They got all of you too.\"</p><p>\"I hope they captured my good side,\" Jackson joked.</p><p>\"What good side?\" Riley asked. He struck a pose. \"I'm ready for my close up, Mr. DeMille.\"</p><p>Shaundra chuckled. \"This isn't funny. They also got me dancing with Yori. My eldest daughter had a fit when she saw that, especially that dress.</p><p>She called me every version of old she could think of.\"</p><p>Harper patted her hand. \"She's just jealous because her mother has a rocking body.\"</p><p>\"Thanks, but that's not helpful. In a way, she's right. I shouldn't be dancing with someone like him.\"</p><p>\"What's wrong with him?\" Riley asked.</p><p>\"He's twenty-five.\"</p><p>\"So, like you have one foot in the grave? If he didn't want to dance, he wouldn't have asked. And if my two cents mean anything, you did rock that dress.\"</p><p>\"Thanks, anyway, I don't plan to get caught like that again. I'll do the photo shoot, but I plan to stay as far away from Aomori as I can after the rehearsal.\"</p><p>\"Good,\" Harper replied. \"At least three of them are after you now.</p><p>That's steep competition for me.\"</p><p>Shaundra rolled her eyes at him and smiled. \"Who is the third?\"</p><p>\"Satoshi?\"</p><p>\"Be serious.\"</p><p>\"I am serious. He had his eyes on you all night too. He's just better at hiding it than Ichiro and Yori.\"</p><p>\"Well, I don't have to worry about Takumijo. I don't think he likes me much.\"</p><p>\"Takumijo is stuck on himself,\" Jackson told her. \"I know the signs.</p><p>He's probably in the mirror more than I am.\"</p><p>\"You're both gorgeous men,\" Dorothy replied.</p><p>\"Thank you, darling.\"</p><p>The car swerved to the left and then the driver left the road and drove into the parking lot of a big building.</p><p>\"We're here,\" Harper announced. \"I want you all to be on your best behavior and do Kehoe Publishing proud.\"</p><p>\"I need coffee,\" Dorothy announced aloud. \"Or some tea bags for these big rings beneath my eyes.\"</p><p>The chauffer opened the door and they scrambled out one by one.</p><p>Shaundra looked the outside of the building over. It had at least fifty floors. The grounds were nicely landscaped with bonsai bushes and cherry blossom trees.</p><p>\"This way,\" Harper told them as he started walking. They followed him up a large flight of stairs and into the building to the information desk.</p><p>\"We have an appointment with Flowing Magazine.\"</p><p>\"Your name, please?\" the man behind the desk asked as he looked them all over.</p><p>\"Harper Kehoe and company.\"</p><p>The man checked the list for Harper's name. \"Nice to meet you, Mr.</p><p>Kehoe. Flowing Magazine is on the thirtieth floor. They're expecting you.\"</p><p>\"Which way to the elevators?\"</p><p>The young man pointed. \"Around that corner to the left.\"</p><p>Harper thanked him and followed the directions. The lobby was pretty nice with gold and white flooring, wallpaper and furniture. Harper pressed the button for the elevator and they climbed in when it arrived.</p><p>Shaundra pressed the button for the thirtieth floor. Her stomach began to wobble and her ears popped as soon as it began to move. \"Why do people insist on renting office space in the nose bleed areas?\" she moaned.</p><p>\"Just five more floors,\" Dorothy told her. \"Then you can relax.\"</p><p>\"I've never met anyone with so many travel issues,\" Harper replied.</p><p>\"I'm surprised you don't get car sick.\"</p><p>\"Nope. Cars, trucks, buses and trains I can handle as long as we don't cross over large bodies of water.\"</p><p>\"I am so glad that you were sedated on the way here.\"</p><p>Shaundra chuckled. \"And I plan to be just as drugged up on the way back,\" she reminded him.</p><p>The door opened and they stepped out into what she could only describe as a fashion magazine wonderland. Beautiful, tall models littered the waiting area flipping through magazines, and sat around drinking water and tea. Harper went up to the desk and gave the young woman their names. She looked at the group, raised an eyebrow and then picked up the phone and made a call. A few minutes later, Goro Niigata arrived and whisked them all off through a double plated glass door. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\"Right this way,\" a young Japanese woman told Shaundra, Dorothy, Chirau and Izanami. The men had been taken off in another direction, and who knew where Aomori was. Harper and Mr. Niigata went off to meet someone and she hadn't seen Masaaki since they'd arrived. \"My name if Chie Arai and I will be your assistant.\"</p><p>Shaundra and the others followed her out of one room and into a long hallway that was also crowded with people, but these were carrying or pushing racks of clothing. It reminded her of fashion week in New York.</p><p>Chie walked so fast the rest of them barely kept up with her. She ushered them into a room where four people waited to wash their hair. A male hairdresser called Dorothy over to a chair.</p><p>\"Ooh, I got lucky,\" Dorothy replied as she sat down and he put a plastic drape around her neck. The two other women went to their waiting hairdressers.</p> <p>A beautician beckoned her over and Shaundra sat down in the chair.</p><p>\"You have nice hair,\" the young woman said to her. \"It's thick and full.\"</p><p>Shaundra had always been proud of her hair. She'd learned how to take care of it at an early age and hoped she wouldn't go bald as she aged.</p><p>\"The plan is to wash and condition and then plait the hair so you can switch wigs for each photo. That way, we won't damage the natural hair with chemicals or cut it into some strange style you might not like.\"</p><p>\"Sounds great to me,\" Shaundra replied, trying to imagine what she'd look like in a wig. It would be a good thing to know just in case her hair fell out.</p> <p>The hairstylist's name was Ai and she had magical fingers that relaxed Shaundra as she massaged her scalp. She was even gentle as she plaited the hair into cornrows. The other women went through similar processes, but it took a little more work since their hair was baby fine.</p><p>\"The wigs will go on after the costume,\" Ai told her as Chie arrived to get them. \"See you again in a couple of minutes in the wardrobe room.\"</p><p>They followed Chie to another large room filled with clothes. All four women stopped and gawked at the beautiful gowns and party dresses. Chie told something to the wardrobe people and left. She returned a few minutes later. \"The men are getting ready and will probably have their preliminary pictures done. They're doing the rock shoot first.\"</p><p>\"The rock shoot?\" Izanami asked, looking at Chie oddly. \"What is rock shoot?\"</p><p>\"Oh, I'm sorry. All the photos for our next issue will feature a music genre.\" She turned to Shaundra. \"You won't be included in this first picture. But don't feel left out. While they're doing this, you'll be getting ready for the classical music shoot.\"</p><p>\"Seems like that should be me,\" Dorothy replied with a yawn. \"Since I'm older than the dinosaurs.\"</p> <p>\"No, Mr. Niigata put a lot of thought into this. He definitely wants you in the rock shoot. I've seen the costumes. You're going to love them.\"</p><p>Chie picked up the phone. \"They're ready.\"</p><p>A young Japanese man entered, looked the four women over and began pulling clothing bags from one of the racks. He was nicely dressed in a well-tailored brown suit and a yellow shirt beneath. \"Which one of you is Ms. Brown?\"</p><p>Dorothy raised her hand. He handed her a garment bag.</p><p>\"Narita?\"</p><p>Chirau's hand flew up.</p><p>He handed her one of the bags.</p><p>\"And you must be Kudo?\"</p> <p>\"Yes,\" Izanami said, looking a little perplexed by everything.</p><p>He handed her a bag too. \"My name is Katsou and I'll be assisting you with wardrobe today.\" He turned to Shaundra. \"You must be Ms.</p><p>Morrison.\"</p><p>\"Yes,\" Shaundra answered shyly.</p><p>\"I have something special for you. You are going to love it.\"</p><p>Shaundra was amazed by how well most of them spoke English. From the beginning, she'd thought there was going to be a problem understanding people, but so far, the only ones who didn't speak much were Aomori, and she didn't think that was because they couldn't. They just chose not to.</p><p>Dorothy, Izanami and Chirau giggled from the dressing room.</p><p>\"We'll let them get finished first and then we'll concentrate on you.\"</p><p>He showed her to a seat. A few minutes later, the other ladies appeared.</p><p>Shaundra gasped. \"You girls look far out.\"</p><p>The two Japanese looked lost with her choice of words.</p><p>\"You look great.\" She rephrased the words.</p><p>They both bowed thanks.</p><p>Dorothy's costume consisted of tight blue jeans and a light blue T-shirt with a peace sign in the center. She also wore some pretty white sandals.</p><p>Chirau wore a red halter top, a white mini skirt and black go-go boots, while Izanami wore a pair of low-riding, white bikini jeans, a red midi-top and had on a pair of black sandals similar to the ones Dorothy wore.</p><p>\"They're on their way to hair and makeup,\" Katsou replied, handing Shaundra a garment bag. \"Your turn.\" He gently pushed her toward the dressing room. Dorothy waved to her as she went off with Izanami and Chirau.</p><p>Shaundra walked out of the room and headed back into the dressing room, found an empty booth, and began removing her clothes. She unzipped the bag. \"It's white and strapless,\" she muttered as she removed her costume. \"And a long, white a slip, great.\" There was also a smaller bag inside with gloves and jewelry. At the bottom of the bag she found a box containing a pair of white heels adorned with pearls and a pair of hosiery. She paused, not sure if she should put on the shoes first so she wouldn't muss the gown by sitting down in it. White wasn't exactly her favorite color because stains always managed to get on her clothes for no reason.</p><p>The decision was made when she checked out the short zipper. There was no way she could just step into the dress because it wouldn't get past her generous hips that way. She would have to put it on over her head and work it down. Hell, she might need assistance getting out of it. She sat on the bench, put on the shoes, adjusted the straps and then rose. In a final act, she slipped the gown from the padded hanger and wiggled into it, pulling the slip down first and then the actual gown. Miraculously, she was able to get the zipper up without assistance.</p><p>Katsou was waiting for her when she exited. \"I knew it would fit you like a glove. Speaking of which, where are the accessories?\"</p><p>Shaundra handed the bag to him.</p><p>\"You can add them after your face is done. Come on. The makeup room is free.\"</p><p>Shaundra followed him out and down the hall to another room. This one was smaller with only two people in attendance. Ai appeared.</p><p>\"Black hair would be nice, but does not go well with dark skin and a white gown.\"</p><p>Shaundra did not take offense at the remark.</p><p>\"Auburn would bring out your complexion more.\" She opened a door to a closet full of more wigs than Shaundra had ever seen in her life. \"Get to work on her makeup,\" Ai told the two young women. \"I'll find something appropriate.\"</p><p>Shaundra hoped the makeup artist had something to match her skin tone. She hated buying makeup. Either the color was too dark or too light.</p><p>Normally, she only wore moisturizer and lipstick, and that was only on special occasions.</p><p>After about thirty minutes of being waxed, plucked, powdered and rouged, she was finished.</p><p>Ai applied a short, bobbed auburn wig that had a part on the right side, and then one of the makeup girls helped her into the gloves and jewelry.</p><p>All three women spoke very rapidly in Japanese. Rude, Shaundra thought.</p><p>One of them finally turned her chair around so she could see herself in a large mirror.</p><p>\"Is this me?\" Shaundra asked, hardly recognizing herself.</p><p>\"Mr. Harper is going to love the way you look,\" one of the makeup artists replied.</p><p>\"What does he have to do with this?\"</p><p>\"He picked out the gown and had it sent over especially for you. The accessories too. He has very good taste for a man. He's not gay, is he?\"</p><p>Shaundra chuckled. \"No, he is very much not gay.\"</p><p>The phone in the room rang and the other makeup artist answered it.</p><p>\"Hello, okay. They're ready for you, Ms. Morrison. Chie is on the way to escort you to the room where you'll be photographed.\"</p><p>Chie was at the door before she could get out of the seat. \"They're waiting for you, Ms. Morrison. The other three ladies are changing for their next picture.\"</p><p>Shaundra caught a glimpse of them as they hurried back to wardrobe.</p><p>Dorothy and Chirau wore spiky wigs while Izanami sported a long, black one.</p><p>\"Radical,\" Shaundra muttered as Chie entered another room across the hall. She stopped in the entrance, amazed to see an American photographer and big lights positioned around the room. There was also a piano and a big cello. The biggest surprised were the two young men waiting...Yori and Ichiro. They were both dressed in white tuxedos and tails. The photographer introduced himself as Jay Adams.</p><p>Jay sent Yori to the piano, her to the cello and put a violin and bow into Ichiro's hands like they actually knew how to play. She'd seen a picture of a cello, before but that was the extent of her musical instrument knowledge. Jay sensed her dilemma, walked over to her, arranged her hands on the strings, positioned her head and then walked over to the cameras. \"Don't move,\" he ordered. The next thing she knew, he snapped the picture.</p><p>Shaundra blinked, hoping it wasn't in the shot.</p><p>Jay took another round of pictures after moving the instruments around the room and repositioning them and his models. \"Smile.\" She caught Ichiro looking her way. She smiled at him at the same time that Jay took the picture. \"That's a wrap,\" he said to them. \"You can change for your next photos.\"</p><p>Shaundra was in two more photos...the pop and the soul photos. In the pop photo, they dressed her in a childish school girl outfit with pigtails guaranteed to make dirty old men pant. The soul photo was just a tad bit better. She wore an afro wig, a navy blue mini skirt, a red halter top and platform clogs. Jackson, Riley, Ichiro and Takumijo wore similar garb.</p><p>The two Japanese men looked a tad bit out of their element as Jay and another photographer set the scene to look like a smoky little nightclub.</p><p>Jay dismissed everyone except her when the shot was over. Ichiro looked back once and followed the others out of the door.</p><p>\"You did an excellent job and I think you're really going to like the proofs,\" Jay replied.</p><p>\"Thanks, it was fun.\" She turned to walk toward the door.</p><p>\"Don't leave, Ms. Morrison,\" Jay called behind her. \"I wanted to ask you if you'd pose for one more photograph.\"</p><p>\"I thought that was the last one.\"</p><p>\"This one is for the cover of Flowing Magazine.\"</p><p>\"What? Why would you want me on the cover of a Japanese magazine?\"</p><p>\"Because you are very photogenic and I think you'd get more publicity on the cover, if you'd stop being so reclusive.\"</p><p>Shaundra put her hands on her hips. \"What do you know about that?\"</p><p>\"I've read most of your books. I'm a big fan and couldn't wait to meet you as soon as I learned you were coming to Japan.\"</p><p>Blush, but not too much, she told herself. \"That still doesn't explain the statement about me being reclusive.\"</p><p>\"Harper did a PR spill earlier for a television station upstairs. I kind of listened to it.\"</p><p>\"You know Harper?\"</p><p>Jay nodded and sat down on a stool behind his camera. \"He and I are old friends. We grew up together.\"</p><p>\"Figures,\" Shaundra replied. \"Did he ask you to put me on the cover?\"</p><p>\"No, that was my decision. I do know a thing or two about making people into overnight successes.\"</p><p>\"Not interested.\"</p><p>\"Why not? You're beautiful.\"</p><p>\"I hope Harper didn't tell the press about having to drug me to get me on a plane,\" she replied, playing off the compliment.</p><p>Jay chuckled. \"He didn't mention the drug part, but he did allude to the fact that you have a fear of flying and that you turned down his offer to join the mile high club.\"</p><p>\"I am going to kill him.\"</p><p>Jay took a picture of her.</p><p>Shaundra looked up, startled.</p><p>\"Shows you have taste as well as character. That's why I want you for the cover. You have fire.\"</p><p>\"Okay, I guess I've gone this far. I can go a little further.\"</p><p>\"Good, wardrobe is waiting for you with the perfect outfit.\"</p><p>\"Did Harper pick that one out too?\"</p><p>\"No,\" Jay replied. \"I did.\"</p><p>\"But won't I hold up the others if I have to take another photo?\"</p><p>\"Don't worry about your friends. They're eating and it won't take but an hour.\"</p><p>\"Okay.\" Shaundra headed toward the door once she ran out of excuses.</p><p>She knew it was an honor to be asked the grace the cover of any magazine.</p><p>She left and walked down the hall to wardrobe where Chie waited.</p><p>\"I knew you would agree if Jay asked you.\"</p><p>\"He's very persuasive and good with the compliments.\"</p><p>Chie agreed. \"Girl needs a little ego boosting at least once a week.\"</p><p>Katsou entered and handed her a garment bag and Shaundra disappeared into the changing booth wondering what kind of taste Jay had since he and Harper were old friends. She removed the white gown, put it neatly back on the hanger and placed the rest of the stuff into the bag.</p><p>Moments later, she opened the other bag. Inside was slinky red dress like a flapper's costume. \"Shit, they're going to run me out of Asia if I keep wearing stuff like this.\" She eased the seamed stockings out of the bag and put them on and then the dress. It fit like a glove. Once she was dressed, Chie escorted her back to the room. Mr. Niigata was there talking to Jay.</p><p>The conversation stopped once they spotted her. That was the first time she'd ever seen Mr. Niigata smile.</p><p>\"Right as always, Mr. Jay,\" he replied as he walked over to meet her at the door. \"Ms. Morrison is going to take this town by storm.\"</p><p>Jay beamed like he had just given birth to her.</p><p>The red heels made her tall and she had to tug the dress down a couple of times to keep it from rising up on her hips and butt. Mr. Niigata walked her over to the props. The room had been transformed into a romantic Victorian backdrop with lots of flowers. Next to the partition was a snow white chaise lounge. Jay walked her over and positioned her on it. She had to flash a lot of thigh in the process.</p><p>Shaundra heard the door open, but she could not see who entered.</p><p>\"Oh, you're here,\" she heard Jay replied.</p><p>\"Yes.\"</p><p>She knew that voice. It was Yori. What is he doing here? Her question was answered when he appeared in eye-sight dressed in a black tuxedo with a red shirt that matched her dress. His hair had been combed back from his forehead, exposing those dark brown eyes, that creamy porcelain skin and full lips. Her stomach clenched and her panties dampened like they had in Charlotte's office. This is going to be so embarrassing.</p><p>\"Mr. Morika has agreed to share the cover with you,\" Jay told her when she stopped gawking. He positioned Yori with his arm over the head of the chaise and looking down on her. Jay walked away and got behind his camera. \"Smile, Yori.\"</p><p>Yori smiled down at her.</p><p>Oh no, the smile was too much. Wicked and predatory.</p><p>Shaundra's eyes widened and Jay took the picture.</p><p>\"We're going to sell every copy we print,\" Mr. Niigata said proudly.</p><p>Jay posed them a couple more times and, each time, Shaundra was oddly aware of the tall Japanese's ease in front of the camera. She wasn't so comfortable. In fact, her body felt on fire.</p><p>\"Just one more,\" Jay replied as he posed them again. This time, he put Yori on the chaise and put her on her knees draped against Yori's midsection. His abs tightened when she touched him.</p><p>\"Sorry, am I too heavy?\"</p><p>\"No, it just surprised me. You're not heavy at all.\"</p><p>\"No talking please,\" Jay scolded. \"Hold that pose.\" He took the picture. \"Excellent. This is going to be Flowing's best cover this year.\"</p><p>Shaundra lifted her weight off of Yori and rose.</p><p>Yori rose and tugged his coat hem down.</p><p>\"Oh!\" Shaundra said with alarm, turning her head, quite embarrassed at Yori's dilemma.</p><p>Jay chuckled. \"Do you want me to immortalize that on film? It's quite impressive. The women would hound you more if they knew what was lurking behind those tight jeans you guys wear.\"</p><p>Yori frowned. \"Please don't. It is just a temporary reaction.\"</p><p>Jay started packing up his equipment. \"Be glad you can still get one.</p><p>That little blue pill has some wicked side effects, I've heard.\"</p><p>Shaundra didn't know if Yori knew what the little blue pill was, but she was embarrassed for him.</p><p>\"I'll send you both copies of these proofs tomorrow. I should have them ready by then.\"</p><p>\"Can I undress now?\" Shaundra asked, trying to pull up the neck of the dress to cover her breasts.</p><p>Both Yori and Jay stopped what they were doing to watch.</p><p>\"I mean, is it okay to go to the changing room?\"</p><p>\"I know what you meant,\" Jay teased. \"But I was just struck by the fantasy of you undressing in front of him and me. Harper is one lucky man.\"</p><p>Yori's gaze shifted from her breasts to her eyes.</p><p>\"Why is he lucky?\" Shaundra asked.</p><p>\"Aren't the two of you dating?\" Jay asked.</p><p>Shaundra shook her head. \"Only in his dreams. Harper is my boss.\"</p><p>\"Women date their bosses all the time.\"</p><p>\"Not this woman.\"</p><p>\"Then what about him?\" he said, nodding toward Yori.</p><p>\"I think I better leave,\" Yori said as his cheeks flushed pink with color.</p><p>\"He's blushing,\" Jay teased. \"Hey, your secret is safe with me. Ms.</p><p>Morrison is really a beautiful woman. I can see why your body responds to her.\"</p><p>Shaundra looked back at Yori once, smiled, and dashed out of the studio. Her heart pounded wildly in her chest just thinking about the erection she'd incited from Yori. Impossible, she thought as she walked.</p><p>Did she still have it? Oh gawd, he must be just as confused as I am over what happened. What does it mean to him getting a boner after posing with a woman old enough to be his mother? Not good, Yori thought as he donned the last of his own clothes in the dressing room. And how inappropriate. He also hated the fact that the photographer got a laugh at his expense. Why did his body act that way whenever Shaundra was around? She was just a woman and he had been around women before. Amaya, for that fact, but for some reason he could not recall that ever happening when the two of them were together.</p><p>He looked down at his crotch. He still hadn't recovered and the jeans got tighter as he conjured up her face. How was he going to get past his friends in such a condition? Think unpleasant thoughts. Kissing Dorothy Brown. He then tried imaging the older woman in a bikini. Oh, that did it a little. He pulled the T-shirt down to try to hide the remainder and walked out of the dressing room to the hall in search for the elevator. He ran into Shaundra roaming the hall. His penis hardened again.</p><p>\"Where are those elevators?\" Shaundra asked. \"I have no sense of direction inside buildings.\"</p><p>\"Follow me. I think they are this way.\"</p><p>\"Thanks.\"</p><p>He walked away and she followed.</p><p>Yori looked back at her. \"You looked really pretty in that white gown earlier.\"</p><p>\"But you didn't like the red dress.\"</p><p>Her nearness made him nervous. \"It was okay.\"</p><p>Shaundra caught up to him.\"Yes, I know what you mean. It was a little too tight. I don't know what Jay and Mr. Niigata was thinking when they picked it out.\"</p><p>Yori looked down at her. \"They were thinking like men.\"</p><p>\"Yes, I suppose,\" she agreed. \"But you seemed a bit uncomfortable.</p><p>\"I don't like having my picture taken. That's more Takumijo's thing.</p><p>So let's change the subject\"</p><p>He spotted the elevator. Finally. Those big brown eyes were going to be the death of him. \"Ichiro liked the white one too. He said you looked like a princess.\"</p><p>Shaundra chuckled and leaned against the wall. \"That was a lot of words even for him. He's really sweet.\"</p><p>\"I hadn't noticed,\" Yori lied as he pressed the button to call for the elevator. It arrived quickly and they stepped inside. He pushed the button for the first floor.</p><p>\"You speak English well,\" Shaunda said once the elevator started to move.</p><p>\"Satoshi taught me most of it and we've been taking lessons.\"</p><p>Shaundra moved in closer to him, tugging at his sleeve to demand his attention. \"Now, back to the other subject.\"</p><p>Why isn't this elevator getting to the bottom floor? Yori wondered.</p><p>Her scent is intoxicating.</p><p>\"You are a celebrity and a very handsome one too. Photographers love to photograph beautiful things.\"</p><p>The elevator finally stopped and the door opened. \"I am not a thing.\"</p><p>\"That's not what I meant, but you are beautiful.\" She followed him off the elevator. \"Does it bother you that I think you're beautiful?\"</p><p>\"Yes, only women are beautiful. I am not a woman.\" He walked off.</p><p>Shaundra followed. \"Ah ha. I see what the problem is. No, you're certainly not a woman. Only a fool would make that mistake.\"</p><p>\"A lot of fools have.\" She knew what had been ailing him all these years. Shaundra Morrison was very perceptive. He'd have to stay his distance from her.</p><p>\"I never will. Jay was right. It is very impressive.\"</p><p>Yori groaned and covered the erection with his hands, in pain and humiliated that she noticed that he could not control his feelings for her.</p><p>\"American women are too forward. You could have pretended not to notice.\"</p><p>\"I'm flattered,\" she replied. \"At least I know now that the attraction between us is not all in my head.\" They continued walking until they met up with the others and went their separate ways to the vans.</p><p>Yori watched as the van carrying the Japanese authors drove away first, followed by the one with the Americans. He climbed the stairs of the van with Satoshi close on his heels. Takumijo and Ichiro had already boarded and were in their usual seats. He sat down with Satoshi next to him. \"What is on your mind Yori? You haven't said much all day.\"</p><p>\"I don't know what you mean. I've been busy just the same as you guys.\"</p><p>\"Busier, I heard. Congratulations on the cover.\"</p><p>\"Thanks. Mr. Niigata insisted.\"</p><p>\"You could have turned it down,\" Takumijo replied.</p><p>\"Are you jealous that they didn't ask you?\" Satoshi inquired.</p><p>\"No. I had enough covers this year.\"</p><p>Satoshi wouldn't let up. \"How about you, Ichiro? Are you upset that you were not asked to be on the cover with Yori and Ms. Morrison?\"</p><p>Ichiro shook his head and looked out of the window.</p><p>Satoshi laughed. \"He probably would have fainted.\"</p><p>Takumijo laughed too. \"What is Amaya going to say when she sees it?\"</p><p>Yori had not thought about that. \"I suppose she will be a bit upset.\"</p><p>\"She is going to be more than just a little upset,\" Satoshi reminded him. \"You better get yourself together and come up with some type of excuse.\"</p><p>\"I don't need an excuse. I will just tell her the truth. It is a part of my job.\"</p><p>Satoshi slid back into his seat. \"This is one of those things that the group can't help you with.\"</p><p>\"Did I ask for help? I don't need help.\"</p><p>\"Which one are you going to choose?\" Satoshi asked.</p><p>\"I don't understand what you mean.\"</p><p>\"Will you remain faithful to Amaya, or will you put the moves on Ms.</p><p>Morrison?\"</p><p>\"Don't be silly. Ms. Morrison has children our age.\"</p><p>\"What if she didn't?\"</p><p>\"I don't see the point in this conversation, Satoshi.\"</p><p>\"Make a decision. We're not blind. She has some type of effect on you. Either you make a decision or let Ichiro have her.\"</p><p>Ichiro head turned slowly at the mention on his name, but he did not comment.</p><p>\"I am engaged to Amaya,\" Yori replied in his defense.</p><p>Takumijo rejoined the conversation. \"So what is taking the two you so long to make the official announcement?\"</p><p>\"We plan to do it after I return from the American tour.\"</p><p>Takumijo snorted. \"I would like to place a wager that it will never happen.\"</p><p>\"You'd lose,\" Yori replied, upset that Takumijo and Satoshi were ganging up on him. He felt like he was losing his leadership control over them. When had they grown up and become men? \"I don't think so,\" Takumijo replied, closing his eyes. \"That was quite some hard-on you were sporting when the two of you walked off that elevator.\"</p><p>Yori fidgeted in his seat while Satoshi snickered at his discomfort.</p><p>\"What's so funny?\" Yori asked Satoshi.</p><p>\"Nothing, but this is one bet you're going to lose.\" </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The phone started ringing the moment Shaundra finished tying her shoe laces. \"Hello?\"</p><p>It was Dorothy.</p><p>\"I think you're going to have to do the rehearsal without me. I am so tired. That photo shoot wore me out.\"</p><p>Shaundra panicked. \"Go by myself?\"</p> <p>\"You'll be fine. Tell me all about it tomorrow.\" She hung up.</p><p>Shaundra replaced the receiver and looked over at the clock. \"Shit, I'm going to be late.\" Masaaki was sending the car for her. She grabbed her purse and left her hotel room headed for the elevator. She made it down to the lobby just as the limousine pulled up to the door. The driver got out and helped her into the front seat and then he walked around and climbed in behind the wheel.</p><p>\"Weren't there supposed to be two of you?\" he asked as he drove out into the street.</p><p>Shaundra fastened her seatbelt. \"Dorothy is still tired from the photo shoot, so you're stuck with me.\"</p><p>\"Not a problem.\" He leaned over, turned on the CD player and then straightened back up in his seat to watch the road.</p> <p>\"What is your name, if I might ask? I don't want to call you Mr.</p><p>Chauffer Driver.\"</p><p>\"My name is Kenshin Ichikawa, but everyone calls me Kenny.\"</p><p>\"Then I'll call you Kenshin.\"</p><p>He chuckled. \"Mr. Masaaki told me to take extra special care with you.\"</p><p>\"But you've been an excellent driver so far. Why the extra precaution?\"</p> <p>He maneuvered the car out of traffic and got on the highway. \"He likes you.\"</p><p>Shaundra moved nervously in her seat and turned a little to face him.</p><p>\"What?\"</p><p>\"Not in that way. He likes the way the boys respond to you.\"</p><p>\"You call them boys. You don't look much older than they are. How long have you been their driver?\"</p><p>\"Since the beginning\" \"So, are you close to Aomori?\" Maybe she could find out more information on them, especially Yori. \"What are they really like?\"</p><p>\"A real bunch of demons.\" That part she had figured out for herself. \"And you like their music?\"</p><p>\"Yes, they're very talented and they work hard. Sometimes too hard.</p> <p>It's not often they get out of Osaka or have any fun.\"</p><p>\"I bet it's hard on them not being able to walk the streets or go to the movies without getting mobbed.\"</p><p>\"That's the worse part. Darn fan girls hop up on the car and try to attack them in hotel rooms.\"</p><p>Shaundra giggled at the image and then faced forward to admire the scenery. Tokyo was really very pretty in the daylight.</p><p>Kenshin continued to talk to her as he drove, telling her about where he grew up and about the young woman he was going to marry after he completed his military duty.</p><p>\"Are you enlisting in the military?\"</p><p>\"Not exactly. All young men have to serve at least two years before they turn thirty.\"</p><p>\"Oh, I didn't know that. Even Aomori?\"</p><p>\"Even them. We'll probably all go in at the same time.\"</p><p>Kenshin drove the limousine into the parking lot of a white building with an oriental styled roof and awnings. It was an older place and, thankfully, not a high rise. He got out and helped her out.</p><p>\"I enjoyed our conversation.\"</p><p>\"Any time,\" Kenshin said as Masaaki came out of the door.</p><p>\"You're here,\" Masaaki said, coming over and bowing to her. \"Where is Miss Brown?\"</p><p>\"Back at the hotel sleeping. She is exhausted from the photo shoot, so you're stuck with just me.\"</p><p>\"Very well.\" He turned to Kenshin. \"Are you coming up?\"</p><p>\"Later, Mr. Masaaki. I have to wash the limousine.\"</p><p>\"Okay.\" He waved good-bye to Kenshin and led her up the stairs. \"The boys are expecting you. They are in the rehearsal room with their music arranger.\"</p><p>Shaundra looked around the lobby as they entered. \"This is nice and cozy.\" There was a fireplace, sofa and a television in the waiting room.</p><p>\"Mr. Niigata wants them to feel at home when they come to Tokyo.</p><p>This place is similar to the one they use in Osaka.\"</p><p>\"Oh, that's right. I forgot that they're not from Tokyo.\" She admired the pictures along the walls as they walked down a hall. \"What is that delicious smell?\"</p><p>\"A feast,\" Masaaki answered. \"Ichiro has prepared dinner for us.\"</p><p>\"Really?\"</p><p>\"Yes, he wants to impress you with his culinary skills.\"</p><p>\"I'm impressed that he even tried. Where is he?\"</p><p>Masaaki led her down another hall and then stop. \"He's inside rehearsing.\" He opened the door.</p><p>All eyes turned in their direction. The smile on Ichiro's face was worth the trip there. Yori looked at her and quickly looked back down at the sheet music in his hand. The rest continued to practice with the arranger.</p><p>Masaaki escorted her over and the music ended as a man stood up.</p><p>\"Ms. Morrison, this is John Sampson, Aomori's music arranger.\" John Sampson was in his early forties, with short brown hair and deep blue eyes. He was also an American.</p><p>Shaundra bowed. \"Konnichi wa.\"</p><p>John bowed to her. \"Konnichi wa. You said that perfectly.\"</p><p>\"I've been practicing,\" Shaundra confessed.</p><p>\"She's kawaii,\" he told Masaaki.</p><p>\"Kawaii?\" Shaundra asked.</p><p>\"That means, cute,\" Satoshi replied.</p><p>Shaundra blushed. \"Thank you.\"</p><p>\"Another American. Where are you from?\" John asked.</p><p>\"New York, but originally from New Orleans, Louisiana.\"</p><p>\"I've been there a couple of times during my career. I'm originally from Florida.\"</p><p>\"You're a long way from home.\"</p><p>He laughed. \"I came here on vacation many years ago and fell in love with the place. I never went back.\"</p><p>\"Wow. What did your family think about that?\"</p><p>\"I don't have any family. That's what made it so easy.\"</p><p>\"My daughter would have a fit.\"</p><p>John looked her over. \"You have a daughter? You look like a young girl yourself.\"</p><p>\"I have four children. My youngest is about to graduate from college.\"</p><p>\"That means she's our age,\" Takumijo said. \"Maybe you can arrange a date between her and Yori when we come to America on tour.\"</p><p>Shaundra knew a slight when she heard one. \"He's not her type,\"</p><p>Shaundra replied. \"She's into basketball players.\"</p><p>\"Why would you want her to fix her daughter up with Yori?\" Masaaki asked. \"You know he's engaged.\"</p><p>The look on Yori's face when Masaaki spilled the beans was priceless.</p><p>\"I didn't know you were engaged. Congratulations. I hope you send me in invitation. It will give me an excuse to return to Japan.\"</p><p>\"We haven't set a date yet,\" Yori replied, throwing Masaaki a heated look.</p><p>\"He plans to do it after the American tour,\" Takumijo added. \"You'll like Amaya. Her family runs a very successful fashion design company in Osaka.\"</p><p>\"Enough with the small talk you guys,\" Masaaki replied. \"Time to get back to work.\"</p><p>\"I was just finishing up,\" John said to Masaaki. \"Ichiro was just about to introduce a new song he's written.\"</p><p>\"Then let's leave them alone while we have tea.\"</p><p>John bowed to Shaundra again. \"Will you be joining us for dinner?\"</p><p>\"Yes, she will,\" Ichiro answered.</p><p>John laughed. \"He talked.\"</p><p>\"She has that affect on him,\" Masaaki replied happily.</p><p>\"Oh, I can see why.\" He left the room with Masaaki, leaving her at the mercy of the band.</p><p>Ichiro walked over to the piano and sat down. He beckoned her over.</p><p>Shaundra ignored the stares from the rest of the group, walked over and sat down next to Ichiro on the bench. He handed them a sheet of music. \"It is called Romanticism.\"</p><p>\"What is that smell?\" Takumijo asked as all of them left the rehearsal studio and headed toward the dining room. Ichiro had gone ahead to reheat the food.</p><p>Satoshi sniffed the air. \"Hayashi Raisu and Tempura,\" Satoshi answered.</p><p>\"Ichiro hasn't prepared Hayashi Raisu for us in a long time. He must be in a good mood.\"</p><p>John entered the dining room before them along with Masaaki. John smiled and waved to her before he disappeared behind the door.</p><p>Shaundra ignored him and put her mind off the delightful aromas filtering out in the hall. She never heard of either of those dishes, but she was game to try it if Ichiro had gone to so much trouble.</p><p>Satoshi opened the door and allowed her to enter before him. The rest of the members followed. The dining room matched the rest of the place...traditional except for the American-styled dining table and brown upholstered chairs. The walls were decorated with sunny pictures of fields and forests, and there was one near the window with a babbling mountain brook. Kenshin entered just as they were about to be seated.</p><p>Masaaki helped her into a seat, placing her exactly like she had been in the Japanese restaurant he'd taken them to with Yori at her right and an empty seat at her left reserved for Ichiro. Right on cue, Ichiro entered wearing a white apron with pot holders on both hands. He pushed a silver cart laden with bowls and platters. He unloaded the bowls one after the other. Shaundra took a little peep at the rice, soup, fish and vegetables. He next took a huge tureen from the cart and placed it on the table in front of his seat and then placed the platter at the other end. He took his place and began ladling into bowls and handing them to her to pass around the table.</p><p>\"It is Ramen soup,\" he explained.</p><p>\"It does not look like the Ramen soup I'm used to. They sell in stores back home for a quarter a pack and the kids boil it in a bowl in the microwave until they noodles get soggy and then they add this package of salty seasoning on it.\"</p><p>Ichiro made a face.</p><p>\"I agree with you. I never touch the stuff.\" \"Then you're in for a treat.\"</p><p>The soup contained huge Chinese noodles, a variety of vegetables and tiny pieces of pork. There were also pieces of boiled eggs floating in the brown liquid mixture.</p><p>Ichiro removed the oven mitts and said a prayer to bless the food.</p><p>He's Christian, she noticed, wondering if all of them were. Did the Christians in this country practice abstinence until marriage? Clear your mind girl. She sampled the soup. Heavenly. \"This is delicious.\"</p><p>\"Thank you,\" Ichiro said.</p><p>Hayashi Raisu, she discovered, was a hash style stew made with thinly sliced beef and onions in a demi-glaze sauce. Also delicious. Okay, she wasn't going to starve with them. And being the only girl at the table did have its advantages. Each man tried to entertain her with conversation, except for Yori, who sat quietly at her right, eating. The only time they had any contact was when he passed her the Yakitori - grilled chicken on skewers and the seafood Tempura that was fried with a golden crispy batter. Ichiro was nice enough to explain what was in each dish, describing the ingredients and why each was so important to the meal. Of course, there was rice, which she managed to eat without wasting on herself. After dinner, Ichiro served them tea in little porcelain cups, and briefly filled her in on the history of the ancient custom.</p><p>\"My grandmother instructed me on the proper way to prepare tea,\" he explained. \"By the time I was six, I could perform a tea ceremony to perfection.\"</p><p>If any other man would have told her that, she would have had to struggle to keep a straight face. But not with Ichiro because watching him was like watching a piece of precious art in motion. His long, slender fingers moved gracefully as he handled the delicate, fragile porcelain.</p><p>Their hands touched as he handed the cup to her. It was all quite sexy and not going unnoticed by the others at the table. She caught Masaaki smiling from behind his tea cup as he talked to John.</p><p>A good thing about being alive for fifty years was being able to recognize a set up when she saw one. From what she could gather, Ichiro rarely talked to anyone except her and he was being especially candid today. So if she could get Ichiro out of his shell, then he'd compose better songs for them, which would make everyone happy and sell records. Hum, a good strategy, but what was in for her? Not that she couldn't get use to looking into that beautiful face or feeling her skin sizzle when he touched her hand. For some reason, her heart was also doing that funny pump the way it had last night when Yori kissed her hand.</p><p>After tea, Masaaki took her on a tour of the rest of the place and the grounds while Aomori finished with the rest of the rehearsal. John had left right after tea, but promised to talk with her about the United States when they met again.</p><p>\"Ichiro has taken quite a liking to you,\" he said as they passed a well- maintained garden and some shrubbery.</p><p>\"I like him, too. He's a really nice young man and a very good cook.\"</p><p>\"No, I mean he really likes you. How do I say it? He is fond of you like a man is to a very special woman.\"</p><p>Shaundra stopped walking. \"You do realize that I am much older than he is?\"</p><p>Masaaki stopped beside her. \"What does age have to do with anything?\"</p><p>\"Well, if I was a man, I would say my age would not be a problem.</p><p>But I'm an older woman and that might not set well with your society.\"</p><p>Masaaki shook his head and chuckled. \"Would it matter if I told you that Ichiro does not care how old you are?\"</p><p>\"I would prefer to hear it from him, and anyway, I'm in Japan on business.\"</p><p>Masaaki stopped laughing and started walking again. \"But you are not opposed to dating a younger man?\"</p><p>Having this conversation with him seemed so wrong. Why is so interested in Ichiro's love life? \"No, but I've never dated anyone young enough to be my son. And while I'm putting it out there, long distance romances never work.\"</p><p>\"Ichiro would be perfect for you. He's young and virile.\"</p><p>\"You sound like his father arranging a marriage.\"</p><p>\"I'm just trying to look out for what's best for him.\"</p><p>\"And it doesn't hurt if he gets a bit creative with the songs when I'm around him. I heard his latest, Romanticism. It was excellent.\" She frowned. He and Harper shared the same ideals. When it came to making money, nothing was out of bounds. Why did men assumed that she was stupid just because she was a woman? \"See, you're perfect for him.\"</p><p>Kenshin pulled up with the limousine just as they made it to the stairs.</p><p>\"I'll go in and get the boys, but I want you to think about what we've discussed.\"</p><p>\"I need Ichiro to speak to me for himself.\"</p><p>Masaaki laughed again. \"You have a great sense of humor.\" He disappeared inside the door without looking back to catch her expression.</p><p>Aomori and Masaaki piled into the limousine after they locked up the place. Satoshi won the honors of being seated next to her, with Ichiro and Yori across from them. Takumijo and Masaaki sat in the rear discussing the upcoming concerts. From what she could make out, both nights were sold out and were being held at the Tokyo Dome the following weekend.</p><p>Apparently, she and the others authors were going as their guests.</p><p>Kenshin drove them straight to the hotel. She never realized how late it was until she saw Masaaki use his pass key to let them into the building.</p><p>Yori caught her hand as soon as everyone else had gone inside. \"I will escort you up.\"</p><p>\"I'm perfectly capable of finding my own room.\"</p><p>He rubbed his fingertip over the back of her hand while he held it.</p><p>\"Join me for a drink before we go up.\"</p><p>It was on the tip of his tongue to say no. \"I don't really drink alcohol.\"</p><p>\"One drink,\" he insisted. He used his pass key to let them into the lobby.</p><p>Against her better judgment, she followed him to the lounge. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>What was he thinking? Yori didn't know. He didn't even know why he was doing it. Things would have much simpler just to have allowed her to go up to her room. But she was looking kawaii, as John had put it, and he was jealous of all the attention she had received from the rest of the men at dinner earlier. Even Takumijo had softened up some toward her on the way back to the hotel and had talked to her about the concert.</p><p>It was still early by club standards. The disc jockey was spinning a melody of songs for lovers. I'll Keep Holding On filtered out through the speakers when they entered. It was the type of song not to be wasted.</p><p>\"Dance with me.\"</p><p>Shaundra did not resist him and wrapped her arms around his waist like American women preferred do when dancing slowly. He was not opposed to the closeness, even though he had been taught that a man should keep a proper distance. Now he understood why as one of Dido's slower songs replaced the previous song. Its haunting rhythm and synthesized sounds woke up something inside of him as Shaundra rocked against him. What an odd time to get an erection, he thought as she snuggled closer to him. She did not act repulsed or try to pull away from him. She just continued to move slowly until the song ended and he escorted her to a private booth. A waitress appeared.</p> <p>The young woman came over, recognized him and rewarded him with an inviting smile. \"What will it be?\" she asked him in Japanese.</p><p>\"Two Shochu on ice,\" he ordered.</p><p>Only then did she seem to notice Shaundra's presence at the table.</p><p>\"Are you drinking both of them? That might be too strong for the American.\"</p><p>\"The American will be all right. Just bring us what I ordered.\"</p> <p>The waitress left, but not before rolling her eyes at Shaundra.</p><p>\"What is her problem?\" Shaundra asked.</p><p>\"Nothing,\" Yori lied. \"How do you say it? Good workers are hard to find.\"</p><p>\"She looks upset. Do you know her?\"</p><p>\"No.\"</p><p>The waitress returned with the drinks and placed them on the table in front of them, then walked away shaking her head.</p> <p>Shaundra picked up her drink. \"You sure you don't know her?\" She sipped and her eyes widened. \"Ooh, this has quite a kickback.\"</p><p>Yori sampled his drink, hoping the waitress hadn't poisoned both of them. \"Sip it slowly to get used to the taste.\"</p><p>Shaundra tried the drink again. This time, she made a face but didn't comment.</p><p>\"Do you want to date Ichiro?\"</p><p>Shaundra put the glass down. \"Why does everyone have that impression?\"</p><p>\"He likes you.\"</p><p>\"I barely know him and there's that age thing.\"</p><p>\"You're thinking like a mother.\"</p> <p>\"I am a mother, which is another reason why I shouldn't get involved with Ichiro.\"</p><p>\"You said shouldn't, not can't.\"</p><p>She picked up the glass again. \"Same thing.\"</p><p>\"No it is not.\"</p><p>Shaundra smiled at him from behind the clear glass. \"Either way I don't have an answer for you. Ichiro has not expressed his interest to me yet, so this conversation is senseless. I prefer a man to be direct with me.</p><p>If he wants more, he has to ask me himself.\"</p><p>Yori, too, liked the direct approach. \"I understand.\" Good, she had not said yes. That meant there was still hope...for him. He polished off his drink and signaled for another. The waitress returned, still in a funky mood. \"Another round.\"</p><p>\"Not for me,\" Shaundra replied. \"This one already has me lightheaded.\"</p><p>\"Would you care for something different? Beer or maybe champagne?\"</p><p>\"Champagne does weird things to me.\"</p><p>Yori chuckled. \"Change my order. A bottle of champagne and two glasses.\"</p><p>Shaundra giggled. The Shochu had her giddy. \"What the hell? How often do I come to Japan?\"</p><p>The waitress raised an eyebrow at him.</p><p>\"You heard it yourself. If the lady wants champagne, then bring her the best.\"</p><p>The waitress left and returned with the champagne bottled buried in ice inside a bucket and two frosted fluted glasses. Yori sent her off with his black charge card and a hefty tip to buy her silence. He lifted the champagne from the bucket, popped the cork and then filled both their glasses. He raised his. \"A toast. To new friends and new relationships.</p><p>Kanpai.\"</p><p>Shaundra raised her glass. \"Maybe.\" She sipped and then emptied the glass.</p><p>Yori refilled it. The more she sipped, the more she giggled. He liked that. He polished off his drink.</p><p>\"Ooh, I like this song,\" Shaundra said as she struggled to her feet.</p><p>He liked it, too, especially since he sang the lead. Where had she heard it? He finished the champagne, rose and then took her hand. She wasn't drunk, but she wasn't acting exactly like herself either. Moments later, they were pressed together on the dance floor with his conscience bugging the hell out of him.</p><p>Satoshi stepped away from the entrance of the lounge perplexed by what he'd just witnessed. Yori and Shaundra Morrison were locked in an embrace, dancing very slowly to one of Aomori's ballads, and they looked oblivious to everything going on around them. So that's where he had disappeared to when they'd gotten out of the limousine.</p><p>Satoshi turned and headed back toward the elevator, trying to find an excuse for not bringing Yori back with him. In this case, it was much easier to lie than tell the truth. There was no way he could say tell the others that he'd found Yori romancing Ichiro's prospective girlfriend. No, that would cause much friction and send their youngest singer into a depressed funk again.</p><p>The elevator reached his floor and Satoshi walked down the long hallway toward their room, passing Shaundra's room that was located around the corner from theirs. Takumijo and Ichiro were waiting back in his room so they could come up with some skits to do in-between songs at next week's concerts. Maybe he should go back and get Yori. Sure, he'd be mad, but what the hell? It was better than inciting a war between his two best friends.</p><p>Satoshi was almost to his room when he finally made the decision to turn around and go back for Yori. He frowned, hating to be the one they depended on to do the right thing. He headed back down the long hallway and turned the corner. He stopped dead in his tracks. Yori and Shaundra stood outside her door locked in a passionate embrace. Neither of them noticed him, or anything around them for that matter. Yori held the shorter Shaundra up in his arms like a groom carrying his bride over the threshold.</p><p>The lust radiated off of them and made the air hot around him.</p><p>Satoshi stepped back around the corner and listened as they uttered endearments to each other.</p><p>\"What's wrong? Don't you like me?\"</p><p>\"It's not that,\" Shaundra replied.</p><p>Good, Satoshi thought. Shaundra is resisting. He slipped away from the area and headed back to his room, fearing being discovered, yet hoping no one else came out of their door and saw the mating couple. He hurried to his room, slipped the key card into the lock and entered. He found Takumijo and Ichiro playing cards.</p><p>\"Where's Yori?\" Ichiro asked.</p><p>\"He's coming.\"</p><p>Someone knocked on the door. Satoshi turned to answer it. Yori stood on the other side looking a bit disheveled and wiping his lips.</p><p>Satoshi smirked. Yori had struck out.</p><p>Shaundra entered her hotel room and sat down on the sofa, trying to regain her composure. Her heart beat erratically in her chest and her face felt flushed and damp. \"Whew, that was a close one.\" She burped, tasting the champagne. The last time she'd drank champagne she ended up pregnant with Tricia. \"Note to self, stay away from champagne.\" Her eyes landed on her laptop, idle for the last couple of days since she'd met Aomori. She'd been in Japan nearly a week and hadn't written a single word. \"Too many damn distractions.\"</p><p>Shaundra rose from the sofa. After a quick run to the bathroom to get rid of the alcohol, she returned to the living room, sat down at the desk and turned on the computer. She surfed the Internet for about an hour and caught up on the world news and what was happening back home in New York. The surfed to the New York Times, checked the crime stories, the fashion section, the obituaries and then, finally, the book section. It did her good to finally see her name up by the number one seller. Harper had eluded to it a couple of days ago, but she'd been too afraid to check.</p><p>She had to give it to herself. Drinking did make her braver and pulled her out of her comfort zone. Once her curiosity was appeased, she went to Facebook to check on her friends who probably thought she'd deserted them. An hour or so later, she turned off the Internet, shoved a flash drive into the USB port and opened the last file she had been working on before she left home.</p><p>\"Oh yeah, a gay romance.\" That would keep her mind off of the lusty Yori Morioka.</p><p>Shaundra tried to concentrate, but her head felt fuzzy and disoriented.</p><p>She was tired and still reeling under the effects of the champagne and whatever the hell Yori ordered before that. Another reason she didn't like alcohol was because it made her do foolish things that were out of the norm for her like almost sleeping with a twenty-five year old, no matter how handsome he was, and Yori Morioka was one delectable-looking man. Fortunately, common sense had kicked in just before things got too carried away.</p><p>Damn, but he could kiss. She pressed her finger to her swollen lips as she remembered. The last one he'd bestowed on her had been deep, passionate and very effective. No one had ever kissed her like that before and he had been beginning to break down the barrier until reason reared its ugly head. He seemed disappointed that she turned him down, but he hadn't tried to force her. She smiled. He scored many brownie points with her because of this.</p><p>Shaundra pounded away at a scene that just jumped into her head.</p><p>Hopefully, her muse wasn't drunk. Hours passed and ideas kept popping up. Nope, her muse was sober and nourishing her. One scene turned into another and then, finally, a completed chapter. Shaundra yawned and saved her document. She was too tired to go on. The thirteen or fourteen hour difference between the United States and Japan still had her all screwed up. And just when her body adjusted, she'd be back on a plane headed home.</p><p>She rose from her seat and headed into the bathroom for a quick shower. Afterwards, she crawled into the bed and closed her eyes.</p><p>Tomorrow, they were doing some promoting on a local talk show. It would be two American authors and two Japanese authors while the other four were promoting at a local bookstore. Aomori wouldn't be accompanying them because they had to rehearse at the Tokyo Dome.</p><p>Shaundra smiled, thinking that she wouldn't have to face Yori for a while, and by then, he'd probably have forgotten about what happened between them earlier. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\"Move that pretty ass of yours,\" Takumijo said to Satoshi as he tried to teach them some new dance steps. He knew it was early in the morning, but he had lots to show them. It also wasn't his fault that Satoshi wasn't a morning person. He could sleep it away if no one woke him. Yori also looked like he'd seen better days.</p><p>Both Satoshi and Yori had been acting out of sorts since last night, but he couldn't put his finger on it. Maybe the two of them had gotten into an argument in the lounge because everything had seemed okay between them at the recording studio.</p><p>\"I need you guys to get these steps right. You're making our background dancers look bad.\"</p><p>A few of the dancers snickered at his comment, but knew not to mess with him when it came to choreography. This was his specialty and contribution to Aomori, and not even Satoshi or Yori was going to mess this up. \"It's step, step, turn, step, and pause.\"</p> <p>Satoshi got it on the second attempt, but Yori still struggled with the combination. Usually, Yori got it on the first attempt, but now even the perfectionist, Ichiro, was getting upset with him.</p><p>\"Yori has two left feet,\" Ichiro said from behind a fan he had taken out of his back pocket. It was one of those old-time ones made of thin wood and decorated with a scenic Japanese design. Yes, Ichiro had some strange habits, but he meant well.</p><p>Yori rolled his eyes at him. \"I do not, you little geisha.\"</p><p>Ichiro did not seem offended by Yori's remark about his manhood.</p><p>\"I'm just a little distracted. Maybe it's from the champagne.\"</p> <p>\"What champagne?\" Takumijo asked. \"We're in training. Why are you drinking that shit?\"</p><p>Yori sat down on the floor and began doing stretching exercises. \"I didn't want the usual stuff. I wanted something different.\"</p><p>\"Champagne is for celebrating, and even the cheap stuff is expensive.</p><p>What were you celebrating?\"</p><p>The rest of the dancers joined Yori on the floor and began stretching out their muscles.</p><p>\"Our upcoming concerts.\"</p> <p>\"So you were just sitting in the lounge last night drinking champagne all by yourself?\"</p><p>\"Yeah, what's wrong with that?\"</p><p>Satoshi cleared his throat and played with his shoestring.</p><p>\"Nothing's wrong with it. It just seems odd. Are you sure you weren't with some young lady?\"</p><p>Yori shook his head. \"I got out of the limousine with you last night.</p><p>When did I have time to meet someone?\"</p><p>\"You had ample time to strike up a conversation with someone in the lounge.\"</p><p>Yori pulled down the cuffs of his blue exercise pants until they covered his ankles. \"No one I'd buy champagne for.\"</p> <p>Takumijo grunted. \"You wouldn't tell us if you had. What's the matter? Afraid one of us might steal her? You know us better than that.</p><p>We don't cross that line.\"</p><p>Satoshi's head popped up quickly and quite noticeably.</p><p>Takumijo walked over to him and bent over. \"What do you know?\"</p><p>\"Nothing,\" Satoshi answered quickly.</p><p>\"You answered too fast. You're hiding something. What did you see when you went down to the lounge to get Yori last night?\"</p><p>Yori looked over at both of them and then went back to his stretching.</p><p>The backup dancers and Ichiro stopped stretching and listened for Satoshi's answer.</p><p>\"Nothing, just Yori sitting in our usual booth drinking.\"</p><p>\"Was he alone?\"</p><p>\"As far as I know.\"</p><p>\"Okay,\" Takumijo said. He walked over and kicked the bottom of Yori's tennis shoes. \"Enough of that stretching, you slackers. Let's get back to work.\"</p><p>Yori moved slowly up to his feet and got back in line on the left side of Satoshi.</p><p>\"Take it from the top - step, step, turn, step, and pause.\" Somewhere before Takumijo's blood pressure rose, Yori got the hang of the exchange.</p><p>By noon, he had practiced them into exhaustion and figured it was time to stop and let them have lunch. This worked out good for him because he had a lunch date with his best friend, Osamu Nakaumura, the actor.</p><p>He hadn't seen Osamu since the last time he and Aomori had come to Tokyo. The two of them had met on the set of a drama where Takumijo had his first acting debut at the age of eighteen. Osamu had been twenty- five at the time, married, and he and his wife were expecting their first child. Osamu had just returned a couple of months early from completing his military duty and had returned to acting with a vengeance. He was now nominated for one of Japan's highest honors in acting for his portrayal of a Samurai in a period piece.</p><p>\"Okay, I guess that's enough practicing for today. Good job everyone,\" he told Aomori and the backup dancers.</p><p>Yori lumbered toward the door and Satoshi set out behind him. The dancers followed them out. Takumijo watched them leave. He wasn't stupid. Something was up with Yori and Satoshi. He looked over at Ichiro who was busying picking up the sweaty towels and tossing out the empty water bottles. \"You do know that they're hiding something from us, don't you?\"</p><p>Ichiro nodded his head.</p><p>\"Go behind them and see if you can find out what.\"</p><p>\"What are you about to do?\"</p><p>\"I'm meeting with Osamu.\"</p><p>Ichiro raised an eyebrow in concern. \"Do you think that is wise? Mr.</p><p>Niigata asked you to stay away from him.\"</p><p>\"It'll be okay. I won't get caught.\"</p><p>Ichiro hesitated, attempted to say something, and then hurried out behind Satoshi and Yori.</p><p>Quiet as he might be, a fool, he wasn't. Yori and Satoshi had stopped talking the moment they saw him in the locker room. Were they discussing him? Ichiro wondered. Probably, since Yori looked away the minute he tried to make eye contact.</p><p>Ichiro pretended to ignore them and began removing his sweaty workout clothes, turned on the shower and stepped beneath the spray, aware that the two of them watched him, hoping one day to discover that he didn't have a penis. They'd seen each other naked before, and drunk, sick and depressed. They'd lived together for fifteen years, sharing everything from nightmares to dreams. There had been no secrets until now.</p><p>Ichiro watched the two of them separate and prepare to shower. What did Takumijo expect him to overhear except the splashing of water against the metal bottom of the stall? Ichiro finished bathing, turned off the water and stepped out on the cold floor. He really had better things to do besides be a spy for Takumijo while he went off to meet Osamu. He sighed, thinking that he should be following Takumijo to make sure he stayed out of trouble, and trouble would certainly come to him if he didn't heed Mr.</p><p>Niigata's warning to stay away from the married actor.</p><p>Of the four of them, Takumijo caused the most trouble with his renegade ways and shitty-assed attitude. Yori had caused his share of problems, too, but at least he was smart enough now to be more discrete and not let the media find out about it.</p><p>Ichiro dried off and put the towel around his waist while he retrieved his clean underwear and street clothes. The other two had exited the shower and started dressing. Neither had spoken a word since his arrival.</p><p>Finally, he could not take the silence any longer. \"Okay, what are you two hiding?\"</p><p>\"Nothing,\" Yori replied as he tugged his T-shirt over his head, struggling to get it over his shoulders and down his chest. Yori and Takumijo always bought T-shirts a size smaller to emphasize their muscles. He and Satoshi were not as self-centered as those two.</p><p>\"I am not stupid. Most of the time I can't shut the two of you up. What did you do that is going to get all of us in trouble?\"</p><p>Satoshi playfully pulled Ichiro's hair as he had done since the first day they'd met. The act had been annoying at first, but he'd grown used to it and understood that it was Satoshi's way of saying that he liked him.</p><p>\"Nothing for you to worry about. Yori is just having some personal issues.\"</p><p>\"Maybe I can help,\" Ichiro said, leaning against the wall with his bag of dirty clothes. He didn't miss the interplay of eyes between Satoshi and Yori. That definitely meant that the two of them had been conspiring about something.</p><p>\"It's nothing really, Ich. Amaya is just all over my case again.\"</p><p>\"Oh, is that all? Why the big secret? She's been all over your case for years.\"</p><p>Satoshi laughed. \"Why are you so talkative all of a sudden?\"</p><p>\"I only speak when I have something important to say,\" Ichiro replied.</p><p>Yori slipped his feet into his shoes. \"Amaya wants me to come home for a visit.\"</p><p>\"I hope you explained that it is impossible.\"</p><p>Yori nodded. \"She misses me. She does not understand that I can't.\" \"How is she going to adjust to that when you're married?\" Ichiro asked.</p><p>\"I have no idea. If she wants a traditional husband, we're going to have severe problems. She's already accusing me of having affairs with our fans.\"</p><p>\"You've cheated on her before. Maybe you should just marry her and take her on the road with you,\" Ichiro suggested.</p><p>Satoshi zipped up his bag. \"I don't think that is a very good idea. She still won't see Yori that much. Maybe you should end your relationship with her.\"</p><p>Yori gathered up his things. \"I don't know.\"</p><p>\"He can't do that,\" Ichiro replied. \"They are in love.\"</p><p>Satoshi headed toward the door, and Ichiro and Yori followed. \"It would make your life a little easier. Your career is on an uphill climb.</p><p>Having a wife will only put pressure on you.\"</p><p>\"I'll think about it,\" Yori said as they walked into the lobby and headed out to the van.</p><p>Kenshin spoke to them as they entered and all conversation ceased.</p><p>Ichiro climbed into his seat and fixed his seatbelt. If either Yori or Satoshi thought he believed anything they said, they didn't know him very well.</p><p>\"I'm coming to Tokyo.\"</p><p>Yori stared at the phone as he sat in the restaurant. Maybe he shouldn't have lied earlier. \"Why?\"</p><p>\"What do you mean why, Yori? I'm coming to see you.\"</p><p>\"I don't think that's a very good idea, Amaya. We're very busy with rehearsing and I won't have much time to spend with you.\"</p><p>Satoshi made a surprised look at him from across the table. Even Ichiro stopped eating long enough to gawk.</p><p>\"That's okay. My parents are coming with me. They have some business in town and they want to see your concert. They're very excited about it.\"</p><p>Yori grimaced. This couldn't have happened at a worse time. \"How did you manage to get tickets? The concerts are sold out.\"</p><p>\"My father called Mr. Niigata. He arranged everything.\"</p><p>Great, they will probably be seated next to or very near Shaundra.</p><p>\"When will you be arriving?\"</p><p>\"In a couple of days. Father has to finalize his plans. Mr. Niigata suggested that we stay at the Dome Hotel since it is close to the concert site.\"</p><p>And close to him. Yori laid his head back against the seat. They were moving over to the Dome Hotel tomorrow so they could be close to the Dome to practice and for dress rehearsals. \"Okay, let me know so I can arrange some time off.\"</p><p>\"You act like all you do is practice and Mr. Niigata doesn't allow you time to sleep.\"</p><p>If she only knew. There were times when they went days without sleep and practiced to the point of exhaustion. Ichiro had been hospitalized twice for dehydration, and not to the mention the constant broken body parts and colds. To the fans, everything seemed perfect, but for the singers, it was hard work.</p><p>\"I'll call you later after I talk to father. I'm so excited.\"</p><p>They ended the conversation, Yori slipped his cell phone back into his pocket and went back to his meal. He grimaced again. His noodles were cold. He pushed the bowl of ramen aside.</p><p>\"Sounds like she's planning a romantic weekend,\" Satoshi said as he picked up a piece of sushi with wooden chopsticks.</p><p>\"More like a shopping excursion if she's brining her parents along.</p><p>They will also be attending our concert, which is odd since they never showed an interest in my work before.\"</p><p>Satoshi put down the chopsticks. \"Smells like a set up to me. Maybe they're coming to get you to set a date.\"</p><p>\"Then they are wasting their time,\" Yori said before he could stop himself. \"I won't be pressured into doing something I'm not ready to do.\"</p><p>Ichiro stopped eating his soup. \"What has happened in the last couple of weeks that has made you change your mind? Have you found someone else?\"</p><p>\"No, not exactly. I think maybe I've been too hasty. How do I know Amaya is the one I want to spend the rest of my life with?\"</p><p>\"You were sure about it up until now,\" Ichiro replied, watching him with those all-knowing, cool blue eyes. \"That must mean you have met someone else recently. Since the only time we've been out of each other's sight was the other day at the fashion magazine, it's safe to say something happened there.\"</p><p>Yori sighed. \"I think I prefer the silent Ich. The one who minds his own business.\"</p><p>\"You are my business. You are one-fourth of Aomori. If you're in trouble, we're in trouble. If you break up with Amaya, we break up with her too.\"</p><p>\"Ah, that's so sweet,\" Satoshi teased.</p><p>\"On the other hand, if Amaya shoots you for cheating on her, you're on your own.\"</p><p>Satoshi laughed. \"You sure are.\"</p><p>Yori called for the waitress, who'd been shyly peeping at them from behind a counter. Luckily, she wasn't one of those fans who gushed and screamed just because she was in the presence of a celebrity idol. It was bad enough fans were gawking at them from outside. Apparently, someone had found out that they were dining out.</p><p>\"Yes, Mr. Morioka.\"</p><p>\"We would like to settle our bill,\" Yori told her.</p><p>She gazed over at Ichiro. \"You have lovely eyes.\"</p><p>Ichiro blushed and looked away.</p><p>\"Don't mind him,\" Satoshi told her. \"Ichiro is shy.\"</p><p>\"And gorgeous.\" She giggled and went off to get the bill.</p><p>\"You are too old for blushing,\" Satoshi told Ichiro. \"Learn to take a compliment.\"</p><p>The waitress returned.</p><p>\"My treat,\" Satoshi told them. \"Since this may be Yori's last meal.\"</p><p>\"Funny,\" Yori replied. \"I can't wait until this situation is reversed.\"</p><p>Satoshi paid the waitress and she went away starry-eyed and smiling.</p><p>\"That won't be for a very long time. I have no immediate marriage plans.\"</p><p>He rose and called for the guards. They hurried over to escort them out of the restaurant.</p><p>Yori and Ichiro rose and followed them through the restaurant, past the other diners who had stopped eating to watch them leave. The wait staff waved good-bye courteously. Everyone in the place knew who they were, but were smart enough not to beg for autographs.</p><p>Unfortunately, the crowd of fans outside was not so generous. They lunged toward Ichiro, but the guards held them back.</p><p>\"I love Ichiro,\" one of them screamed. This set off a round of giggles and shouts.</p><p>Poor Ichiro looked like he was about to jump out of his skin.</p><p>\"Let's sign a couple of autographs and get this over with,\" Satoshi suggested.</p><p>The fans squealed, pushing toward him. Takumijo was usually the crowd favorite, but lately, Satoshi's popularity had been quickly soaring off the charts. Ichiro's too. A girl pushed a stuffed animal at Ichiro. He accepted it, bowed to her and quickly ducked behind Satoshi.</p><p>\"He's so shy,\" someone shouted. \"I just love him.\"</p><p>An older woman pushed an autograph book at him. Yori took it, asked her name, and wrote some meaningless drivel onto it.</p><p>The woman thanked him and pulled a younger girl off with her.</p><p>After satisfying all the fans, the guards pushed the singers into the waiting limousine. Ichiro climbed into his seat and put the stuffed animal in the seat next to him while he buttoned his seatbelt.</p><p>Yori and Satoshi got into their seats and buckled up just as Kenshin pulled away from the curb. The van with their security followed.</p><p>Satoshi picked this opportunity to toy with Ichiro. \"You certainly were popular with the fans today. I think I actually saw you smile at a couple of cute girls.\"</p><p>Ichiro's cheeks turned pink with embarrassment. \"I don't know what you're talking about.\"</p><p>Satoshi reached over and played with Ichiro's hair. \"They love you and those baby blue eyes. I think I'm jealous, Yori. Our baby is discovering girls and using that alluring smile of his to hypnotize them into giving him gifts.\"</p><p>Yori agreed. \"Yes, before we know it, he will be coming to us for advice on dating.\"</p><p>The pink in Ichiro's cheeks turned beet red. \"Stop teasing. The fans were just being generous with me since Takumijo wasn't there.\"</p><p>Satoshi released Ichiro's hair and settled back in his seat. \"I don't think so. They were very much coming on to you. After all, you are a gorgeous and desirable young man.\"</p><p>Yori agreed with him again. \"Maybe we need to go out more often without that fan-hogging Takumijo. Who knows, Ichiro might meet the future Mrs. Yoshida soon if this keeps up.\"</p><p>Satoshi disagreed with him. \"I think Ichiro has already found the future Mrs. Yoshida.\"</p><p>Ichiro lifted both hands to his face to hide behind.</p><p>\"Ah, come on, we're not blind. We know you like Ms. Morrison.\"</p><p>\"I do not,\" Ichiro said from behind his hands. \"She is a nice lady who I like to talk to.\"</p><p>Satoshi wouldn't let it go, even though Yori shook his head and rolled his eyes at him to get him to stop. \"You never wanted to talk to any other women before. What is it about her that brings out your voice?\"</p><p>Ichiro lowered his hands. \"She smells like sunshine, and I get this funny feeling in the pit of my stomach whenever she's around.\"</p><p>\"Ooh,\" Satoshi teased. \"That's lust. Do you hear that, Yori? Ichiro is hot in the pants for Shaundra.\"</p><p>\"Stop teasing him, Satoshi. We've been in that position before a time or two.\"</p><p>\"But I like to see Ich blush. Makes me feel so warm inside.\"</p><p>Ichiro couldn't help but smile at Satoshi's statement. \"I don't do men.\"</p><p>Satoshi pretended to be hurt by Ichiro's slight. \"But I've been saving myself all this time for you. I've been looking forward to the day when I have you on my bed with all that hair of yours spread out on my pillow.\"</p><p>\"You are one sick puppy, Satoshi,\" Yori replied. \"The fan girls would go crazy if they heard you say something like that to Ichiro. You'd be the star of YouTube.\" Of course, all of them had starred on YouTube a couple of times since they debut. Especially Ichiro. His fan-made videos were renowned and had been ever since the first time he had been mistaken for a girl. They'd paired him with Takumijo before, but never Satoshi.</p><p>\"They're already writing fan-fiction about us,\" Satoshi replied. \"I saw it the other night. They especially like you, Yori. You should read some of it.\"</p><p>\"No,\" Ichiro said, positively shocked.</p><p>\"Don't tell me you never go on the Internet and Google yourself?\"</p><p>\"No, I don't,\" Ichiro replied. \"I'm not as vain as you are, Satoshi.\"</p><p>\"I am not vain,\" Satoshi said, flipping his hair.</p><p>Ichiro smiled. \"You spend more time in the mirror than Takumijo.\"</p><p>\"No one stays in the mirror more than Takumijo,\" Satoshi corrected.</p><p>He turned to Yori. \"Are you going to check out your fan-fiction?\"</p><p>\"No thanks. I don't want to see what man they have me screwing.\"</p><p>\"Why do you think they have you paired up with some guy?\"</p><p>Yori stared at him. \"I'm not dumb when it comes to the comments I've heard from reporters. I know they think I look like a girl too.\"</p><p>\"We all do, but that doesn't make us so.\" He paused. \"I wonder how Takumijo's lunch date with Osamu Nakaumura went. Takumijo is always excited to see him.\"</p><p>\"I hope Mr. Niigata does not find out. He's afraid Osmau will lure him away from singing and try to make him an actor,\" Yori said.</p><p>\"I don't see why he can't do both,\" Satoshi replied. \"We've starred in mini-dramas before and it hasn't hurt our careers.\"</p><p>\"But we've never starred in a full-featured film before and I think Osamu wants to make a movie with Takumijo. I think if anyone can persuade him, Osamu can.\"</p><p>\"I don't really care for acting,\" Ichiro replied. \"Too much trouble and too many lines to rehearse.\"</p><p>Satoshi agreed. \"Speaking of which, what is next on our schedule for today?\"</p><p>\"Packing,\" Yori said, sliding back into place as their leader. \"We're moving over to the Dome Hotel in the morning.\"</p><p>\"It's not going to take that long to pack,\" Satoshi insisted. \"So does that mean we have some free time?\"</p><p>\"Yes,\" Yori answered. \"What do you plan to do with your freedom?\"</p><p>Satoshi looked at his watch. \"Watch television. Ms. Morrison and three of the authors are going to be on Around the Town this afternoon.\"</p><p>\"The talk show?\" Yori asked, trying not to sound excited. \"How do you know this?\"</p><p>\"I overheard them talking the other day. And four of the other authors are doing a promotion at a bookstore in Shibuya.\"</p><p>\"Not the bookstore,\" Ichiro begged. \"Fans will be there.\"</p><p>Satoshi chuckled. \"You didn't seem so upset to be around fans earlier.</p><p>Just a little shy.\"</p><p>\"None of them tried to touch me,\" Ichiro confessed. \"But I might not be so lucky at the bookstore with all those men and women discussing romance books.\"</p><p>Both Satoshi and Yori laughed.</p><p>\"Go on and laugh. They don't pinch your cheeks or try to feel you up to see if you're a boy or a girl.\"</p><p>\"You're going to learn to appreciate your looks one of these days,\"</p><p>Satoshi told him. \"So what if you're as pretty as a girl? I know you're a boy.\"</p><p>\"You do not count,\" Ichiro stated matter-of-factly. \"It's embarrassing.\"</p><p>\"Ms. Morrison doesn't seem to care. In fact, I think she likes everything about you,\" Satoshi told him.</p><p>\"Do you think she would go out with me?\" Ichiro asked.</p><p>\"I don't know. You'll have to ask her.\"</p><p>\"Shaundra isn't in Tokyo to date,\" Yori replied as he moved around in his seat. \"She is working and, besides, she has kids our age.\" For some reason, that didn't bother him.</p><p>\"How do you know so much about her?\" Ichiro asked suspiciously.</p><p>He couldn't bear to look into Ichiro's big blue eyes and tell the truth.</p><p>Damn Ich for being so needy. \"I've talked to her a time or two.\"</p><p>\"So you think I should not ask her because she is too old for me?\"</p><p>Yori groaned to himself. Why me? Just tell him how you feel about her and get it over with. The sooner the better. Yori chickened out. \"No, I'm not saying that. Go on, ask her out. What do you have to lose?\"</p><p>\"His virginity,\" Satoshi answered for him.</p><p>Ichiro's entire face turned red again.</p><p>Another little part of Yori died inside.</p><p>Harper handed the authors their proofs that had been delivered to him from Flowing Magazine. Everyone sat around the table in a small conference room inside the Dome Hotel where they had moved to earlier that day.</p><p>Shaundra pulled hers out of the envelope and looked at them.</p><p>Everything was there except the cover shot with her and Yori. \"Something is missing,\" she told Harper.</p><p>\"Oh, you're talking about the cover shot. Flowing is not going to release it until the concert this weekend. Jay is being very secretive about it too. I don't think Mr. Niigata has seen the proofs yet either.\"</p><p>Dorothy pulled her photos out and squealed. \"Shaundra, you just have to see these. I look thirty years younger.\"</p><p>Funny, Shaundra thought as she looked at her proofs. So did she. The wonders of modern photography. The two women exchanged proofs.</p><p>Shaundra smiled at Dorothy's rock photos. The women wore wild-looking wigs. Even the guys looked great in their sixties fashions and wigs.</p><p>\"Oh my,\" Dorothy exclaimed. \"You look so beautiful in this picture.\"</p><p>Shaundra looked up. \"Where?\"</p><p>\"Right here in this classical photo with Ichiro and Yori, and look how they're gazing at you. Honey, you're in serious trouble.\"</p><p>\"Let me see those,\" Harper ordered.</p><p>Dorothy passed the photos around to him.</p><p>\"Shit,\" he said as he looked through them. \"What did you say to them to have them look at you like two predatory wolves?\"</p><p>\"I didn't say anything to them. I just walked into the room and found the two of them there in white tuxedos. Your friend, Jay, posed us and then told us to smile at each other.\"</p><p>\"He said smile, not undress each other with your eyes. Those two are positively leering at you.\" He looked at the other proofs. \"And look at how short that mini-skirt is in this photo. It's shocking.\"</p><p>\"It's no shorter than the one you brought for me to go out clubbing in.\"</p><p>\"Maybe I made a mistake by choosing that particular outfit.\"</p><p>\"Let me see those,\" Riley replied. \"They must be something special if Harper's this riled up.\"</p><p>Harper passed the photos to Riley. \"I'm not riled up. I just don't like the way those two are looking at Shaundra. God, she's old enough to be their mother.\"</p><p>Shaundra ignored his last comment.</p><p>Riley whistled. \"Baby, you're hot. Look at those legs.\" He showed Jackson the soul music photo.</p><p>\"I'd do her if I was into women,\" Jackson confessed.</p><p>Riley looked at the other photo. \"Wow, I see what you mean. They want you so bad.\"</p><p>Dorothy spoke up. \"All three of you guys are just being ridiculous. So what if the pretty little Asian boys have the hots for Shaundra? She's single and beautiful. What did you expect to happen when you put a lamb into a lion's den? Those are virile young men. Of course they're going to go after her. They can smell a nice woman a mile away. \" \"Thanks,\" Shaundra said to Dorothy. \"But so not helping. Harper, they're only pictures. So what if they're sensual-looking? They're going to sell a lot of magazines and that's wonderful promotion for KiNii.\"</p><p>\"I'm more worried about what Mr. Niigata is going to say when he sees them.\"</p><p>\"What can he say?\" Shaundra argued. \"Those are his wolves. You don't think they looked like this when he discovered them years ago? No, he made them look and act like this.\" She really didn't see anything wrong with the photos. They were perfect for that type of magazine. The photos made it back around to her and she looked at the classical ones again.</p><p>Maybe she'd missed something. This time, she looked the entire picture over and not just the beautiful clothes. Shit, Harper is right. Both of them were looking at her like a piece of prime meat. If she didn't already know how they felt about her, this would come as a complete shock.</p><p>\"Under no circumstances are you to be alone with either of them,\"</p><p>Harper told her. \"In fact, the less they see of you, the better.\"</p><p>\"I am not a child, Harper. I know how to control two twenty-four or five-year old men. I have two sons of my own.\"</p><p>\"Your sons don't look at you like that. And I must say, I'm quite surprised at Ichiro.\"</p><p>\"Why are you surprised at Ichiro and not Yori?\"</p><p>\"Because I saw that look in Yori's eyes every time he danced with you. Up until now, I thought Ichiro was gay. Hell, he looks more like a woman than you two ladies. Boy, was I mistaken.\" \"Should I be offended?\" Dorothy asked as she put away her photos. \"I have more breasts than Shaundra and Ichiro, so technically, I'm more woman than he is.\"</p><p>Shaundra rose from her seat and walked over to the window. \"This conversation is getting ridiculous.\" She looked out the window, spotting the Tokyo Dome where Aomori would be performing in a couple of days.</p><p>She didn't know if she looked forward to that or not.</p><p>\"What's next on the agenda?\" Jackson asked Harper.</p><p>Shaundra returned to her seat.</p><p>\"We're going to visit the Dome Mall, soak in a hot spring and then get massages.\"</p><p>\"I'm for that,\" Jackson replied. \"I hope I get a cute little male masseuse with nimble fingers.\"</p><p>\"Will the other four authors be joining us?\" Dorothy asked.</p><p>\"No, this is just a special treat for us. Remember, they're from here and they do this type of thing all the time.\"</p><p>Shaundra moved her neck around. She could use some loosening up, too, and the hot springs sounded so inviting. \"What time are we leaving?\"</p><p>\"In a few minutes,\" Harper answered. \"We won't need a driver since everything is in walking distance. So, if any of you want to change shoes, do so now.\"</p><p>Shaundra didn't have to worry about that. She was casually dressed in jeans, a T-shirt and tennis shoes. No one else responded either.</p><p>\"Okay,\" Harper said as he collected the packages of proofs from them.</p><p>\"Just let me call Jay and tell him that you all approve of these.\" He picked up the phone and dialed a number. \"Yes, this is Harper. Everyone loves their proofs, especially the classical ones with Ms. Morrison and those two punks. Remind me to strangle you the next time I see you, buddy.\"</p><p>The last thing Shaundra heard before Harper hung up the phone was Jay laughing.</p><p>\"You look pretty good in a tux and tails,\" Satoshi told Ichiro as they looked through the proofs the photographer had sent to them.</p><p>\"Thanks,\" Ichiro replied, going through his. \"So does Yori.\"</p><p>\"Well, Yori looks good in anything he puts on,\" Satoshi admitted.</p><p>\"He's built like a model.\"</p><p>\"Hey, what about me?\" Takumijo asked as he posed seductively.</p><p>\"Stop fishing for compliments,\" Satoshi told him. \"You already know you're a stud.\"</p><p>Ichiro kept staring down at the photo of himself, Yori and Shaundra Morrison. \"I don't know if I like this one.\"</p><p>\"Why not?\" Takumijo asked, walking over to see it.</p><p>Ichiro handed it to him.</p><p>\"Oh!\"</p><p>\"What are you guys doing?\" Yori asked as he entered the room.</p><p>Ichiro got out of his chair and rushed out of the room.</p><p>\"What's wrong with him?\"</p><p>\"Depressed,\" Satoshi answered.</p><p>\"What for this time?\" Yori asked.</p><p>Takumijo handed him the photo.</p><p>\"Oh!\"</p><p>\"Same thing I said. What is the matter with you, Yori?\"</p><p>Yori continued to stare at the photo. \"I didn't know it would come out like this.\"</p><p>\"You two guys are looking at her like you want to devour her. I expected to see that expression on Ichiro's face, but not yours,\" Takumijo replied, quite upset. \"Have you lost your mind? You know Ichiro likes her.\"</p><p>Yori flipped through the other photos. \"The photographer posed us.\"</p><p>\"Yes, but he didn't put that look in your eyes,\" Satoshi teased. \"I'm shocked. What is Amaya going to say when she sees these?\"</p><p>\"Maybe she won't see them.\"</p><p>Satoshi laughed. \"This is getting better by the minute. Of course she's going to see it. Her folks are fashion designers. She's going to rip your head off. Both of them.\"</p><p>Yori groaned. \"It's not that bad.\"</p><p>\"Poor Ichiro ran out of here in tears,\" Takumijo said, adding his two cents. \"You've done some low things before, Yori, but I never thought you'd try to steal a woman from Ichiro.\"</p><p>\"You have it all wrong,\" Yori argued. \"It's just a photo. Ichiro can have Ms. Morrison. I have no plans of getting in his way.\"</p><p>\"You better not. He's been writing some kick ass songs since he met her. I'm beginning to like her, too, for that reason.\"</p><p>Satoshi chuckled, even though the situation was far from funny. Those two idiots were in love with the same woman. This could only end badly for all of them.</p><p>\"Don't you think you should apologize to Ich?\" Takumijo asked.</p><p>\"For what? I haven't done anything wrong.\"</p><p>\"Then just go out there and talk to him. It's his first love and he's hurting.\"</p><p>\"Shit,\" Yori replied. \"You guys need to stop babying him. Ich is a full- grown man. If he wants Shaundra, he better grow some balls and asked her out.\"</p><p>\"He won't do it as long as he thinks you're interested in her,\"</p><p>Takumijo replied.</p><p>\"Okay,\" Yori finally agreed. \"Anything to get you off my back.\" He stormed out of the room, leaving Takumijo and Satoshi alone.</p><p>\"This is going to end badly, isn't it?\" Takumijo asked.</p><p>\"Oh yes,\" Satoshi agreed. \"And we're going to suffer the repercussions.\"</p><p>Why me? Yori thought as he made his way into the other room. This was one of those times he hated being the leader. What am I going to say to him? He couldn't put his own feelings into words yet. He dug his hands into his pocket and sighed. Why was life so difficult? Just do the right thing, a tiny voice whispered into his head. Yori frowned. One of these days he was going to punch that little voice of reason right in the mouth.</p><p>He entered the room and stopped. Ichiro was seated slump-shouldered on a cement bench in the garden facing the wall. Guilt and envy gnawed at Yori's gut. Ichiro was his friend...his baby brother. \"You really like her, don't you?\"</p><p>Ichiro raised his head quickly and turned around to face him. \"I don't know what you mean.\"</p><p>Yori pulled his hands out of his pockets, walked over and sat down next to him on the bench. \"Don't lie to me, Ich,\" he said angrily. \"If you like her, why don't you ask her out for a date like I told you before?\"</p><p>Ichiro lowered his head. \"I'm afraid she'll turn me down. After all, I am just a boy to her.\"</p><p>Yori sighed, raised his hand and ruffled Ichiro's hair. \"Haven't you looked at yourself in the mirror lately? You're six feet tall, gorgeous, and definitely not a boy any longer.\"</p><p>Ichiro pulled away from him. \"But I look like a girl.\"</p><p>True, but it would not help things if he agreed. \"If that's your problem, then do something about it.\" I can't believe I'm saying this. \"Cut that hair and update your wardrobe. You're muscular and have a nice behind.</p><p>Women go for that. Shaundra won't be able to resist you.\" Shit. What am I saying? Ichiro dried his eyes. \"You think so?\"</p><p>Yori put his hand on Ichiro's shoulder. \"I'm sure of it. I'll even take you shopping.\"</p><p>Ichiro rose and took a step away from him. \"I saw the way you looked at her. You like her too.\"</p><p>Yori lowered his head so he didn't have to meet Ichiro's accusing stare. \"I'm engaged to Amaya.\"</p><p>\"Don't lie to me, Yori. I might be young but I am not stupid.\" He shook his finger at him. \"I knew something was wrong. That's the secret you have with Satoshi.\"</p><p>Yori hopped from the bench, walked over to him, grabbed his shoulders and gave him a stern shake. \"Let me repeat myself. I am engaged to Amaya.\"</p><p>\"But if you weren't?\"</p><p>Yori's voice broke and he fought to keep from sounding as broken hearted as he felt. He let go of Ichiro's shoulders and walked away before the tears stinging his eyes flowed. \"Then we wouldn't be having this conversation. Come on, they're waiting for us. We have an appointment.\"</p><p>Yori opened the door and Satoshi and Takumijo nearly fell in. \"Everything is fine,\" he told them. \"Let's go.\" </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\"This is the life,\" Shaundra said as she relaxed in the hot springs.</p><p>Dorothy sat next to her sipping on a large glass of iced tea.</p><p>\"It sure is. I feel rejuvenated already.\"</p><p>\"I wonder how the men are enjoying their soak on the other side of this wall.\"</p> <p>\"Probably embarrassed to be naked in front of each other. All except Jackson. He must be having the time of his life.\"</p><p>\"I wonder if Harper is still mad at me.\" Part of her didn't really care, but he was her employer.</p><p>Dorothy turned her nose up at the thought. \"Probably, but it's not your fault.\"</p><p>Shaundra turned her head so Dorothy could not see the pained look in her eyes. \"I could have prevented it. I know they both like me.\" Oh God, she felt like such a big tease.</p><p>\"I should be so lucky. I've never had two men interested in me and you have three.\"</p> <p>Shaundra sighed. \"I'm afraid it could be more than that. Add the photographer friend of Harper and Aomori's music arranger I met the other night. His name is John Sampson.\"</p><p>Dorothy perked up. \"I've heard of him. He was famous in the United States. You say he's here in Tokyo?\"</p><p>Damn, Dorothy's eyes lit up like two neon lights. Did others see her like that too, old and desperate? Shaundra shuddered, hoping not. \"Yes.</p><p>See what you missed the other night?\"</p><p>\"You have to arrange for another one of those rehearsal invites. I wouldn't mind meeting John Sampson. He's fine.\"</p><p>\"I don't know what's happening. I must be emitting some kind of female dog in heat scent.\"</p> <p>Dorothy laughed loudly. \"You think? Honey, you're beautiful, shapely and available. Add a gifted erotic author who's financially independent and you're going to draw men to you like flies.\"</p><p>Shaundra laughed, splashing water toward Dorothy. \"You're worse they are. Give me some advice. What would you do if you were in my shoes?\"</p><p>\"I would screw all of them.\"</p><p>Shaundra continued to laugh. \"I don't know why I asked you.\" It was not like the thought hadn't crossed her mind a time or two.</p><p>\"Ask yourself honestly which one you like best, and let me say Ichiro has the loveliest blue eyes, which is a rarity in Asia.\"</p><p>\"He also has the softest skin. I feel like putting talc all over him,\"</p><p>Shaundra confessed.</p><p>\"Listen to us,\" Dorothy said. \"We're old enough to be his mother.\"</p> <p>She shuddered in the warm water as an image of a naked Ichiro formed in her head. \"Then how come I'm not having motherly thoughts about him and Yori?\"</p><p>\"That Yori is so hot,\" Dorothy replied, lifting her leg out of the hot water and then lowering it. She did the same with the other one.</p><p>\"Yeah, I know. He makes my heart flutter and my skin sizzle when we dance together. And he's a great kisser.\" Oops, maybe I should not have said that.</p><p>\"Ooh, you've kissed him? When?\"</p><p>\"Shush. The other night when we came back from the photo shoot. We stopped for a drink in the lounge after you guys went upstairs to your rooms. He ordered champagne and the next thing I know, we were kissing like a couple of randy kids outside of my hotel room door.\" Shaundra touched her mouth. Yori's kiss had been so hot and demanding.</p><p>\"Outside the room? Are you crazy? Why didn't you bring the man into the room?\"</p><p>\"Don't think I wasn't tempted. But then reality sank in and I sent his horny ass to his room.\"</p><p>\"You're a cock tease.\"</p><p>Shaundra chuckled. \"I've been called worse.\" Hell, I've done worse.</p><p>\"I'm beginning to see a whole different side of you, darling. You're not the innocent woman the world thinks you are.\"</p><p>Shaundra chuckled. \"Hell no. I've done my fair share of dirt in my youth. But it all changed after my husband died.\" She stopped talking.</p><p>Maybe she had said too much. The anger she felt for him leaving her behind still hurt.</p><p>\"He died, honey, not you. Just because there's a little snow on the mountain doesn't mean you have to give up living.\"</p><p>Shaundra treaded water and then swam back. \"Yes, I know. I'm so confused. I don't want to make the wrong decision. Is it possible that I can have both of them?\" Joking was the way she covered up how she really felt.</p><p>\"You know the answer to that. You're one of the best erotic writers in the world. Of course you can.\"</p><p>Shaundra smirked wickedly. \"That's what I like about you, Dorothy.</p><p>Charlotte would have told me hell no.\"</p><p>\"That's why she's stuck in New York mooning over Harper. Maybe if she'd loosen up a bit, she'd have him by now.\"</p><p>\"Speaking of him, I hope he doesn't blow this partnership because of his one-sided affection for me. I've told him a thousand times that I'm not interested in him that way.\"</p><p>\"Harper is not stupid. This partnership is too important to him. He's not going to mess it up because Aomori is smitten with you.\"</p><p>\"Only two of Aomori. The other two just tolerate me.\" She stretched.</p><p>\"I think I've been in the water too long. I'm starting to wrinkle.\" She swam to the edge, got out and put on her robe.</p><p>Dorothy followed her. \"I've got enough wrinkles. It's time for our massages anyway.\"</p><p>Yori spotted Shaundra as she disappeared behind the door with her masseuse, moments after he finished with his massage. They had paired her up with a male. Yori shuddered. It took everything he had not to barge into the room and toss the man out and take his place. His cell phone rang.</p><p>Yori pulled it out of his pocket. \"Damn, it's Amaya.\" He pressed the green button. \"Hello.\"</p><p>\"Hello, Father has finalized his plans. We are arriving tomorrow.\"</p><p>\"I'll be waiting,\" he said, trying to sound convincing as he kept his eyes on the door. \"I'll call you later.\" He hung up before Amaya could respond and put his cell phone back into his pocket. What was he going to do now? And how was he going to keep Amaya from finding out about those photos? The photographer told them that the magazine would be printed tonight and they would be on newsstands tomorrow.</p><p>\"What are you doing?\" Satoshi asked as he came out of one of the rooms fixing his clothes.</p><p>\"Stalking,\" Yori answered.</p><p>Satoshi looked around. \"Who?\"</p><p>\"Shaundra Morrison.\"</p><p>\"Where is she?\"</p><p>Yori pointed toward the room. \"She just entered a short time ago wearing a short white robe and exposing those shapely brown legs.\"</p><p>\"Why are you torturing yourself?\" Satoshi asked.</p><p>\"I'm not doing it on purpose. I wish Ich and Takumijo would hurry up so we can get out of here before she's exits.\"</p><p>\"You know Takumijo. He's milking it for all it's worth.\"</p><p>\"That sounds so dirty.\"</p><p>\"Picked it up in America on my last trip.\"</p><p>Ichiro appeared next, followed by Takumijo.</p><p>\"I'm starved,\" Takumijo said. \"Are you hungry?\"</p><p>\"I'm starved,\" Satoshi answered. \"Come on, let's go get something to eat.\"</p><p>Yori made an attempt to leave with them. \"Damn, I left my wallet in the room. You guys go ahead. I'll meet you out front.\"</p><p>The other three waved good-bye and left.</p><p>Shaundra's head sprang up. Is that Yori's voice I hear? The masseuse pushed her head back down and continued to massage the back of her neck and down her spine. Shaundra relaxed. Ooh, he has magical fingers.</p><p>Still, she thought she heard Yori. Was he there about to get a massage too? She pictured him lying on his stomach with just a thin sheet across his waist. With her eyes closed, she could plainly see the taut muscles in his back, the bulging biceps of his arms and his tight buttocks. Ooh, it was enough to give her a hot flash.</p><p>Fingertips dug into the small of her back just above the rise of her behind. Yori's touch would be like this, she decided and the man massaged her waist.</p><p>The masseuse raised the sheet just as he got near her behind. Drat.</p><p>Yori would not have stopped. A buzzer went off in the room, ending her dream and calling an end to the massage. A half hour had gone by so quickly. The masseuse left the room to give her time to dress. The door opened and closed. She knew she should get up and dress, but she was too comfortable. The door opened and closed again. Shaundra tried to get up by using her elbows.</p><p>\"Don't move,\" a deep voice said.</p><p>Shaundra froze. \"Yori?\" She slid back down. What is he doing here? A warm hand landed on her back and slid down to where the sheet landed.</p><p>Shaundra tried to turn over as his fingers moved under the sheet and kneaded one of her cheeks.</p><p>\"Don't. Just allow me this one weak moment.\"</p><p>\"But the masseuse?\"</p><p>\"Won't be back. I've already taken care of that.\" He snatched the sheet away, exposing her bottom. \"So lovely. I knew it would be.\" He ran his hand over both cheeks. \"I can't stop thinking of you and, even though I know my best friend is in love with you, I can't stop myself.\"</p><p>\"But I...\"</p><p>\"No, let me finish, Shaundra. If things were different, I'd fight tooth and nail to have you. But I have to be honest with you. I have been engaged to a young woman named Amaya since I was four years old. It was one of those arranged marriages between our parents. The reason I'm telling you this now is because she and her family are on their way here to Tokyo. I didn't want you to find out any other way.\"</p><p>\"Amaya?\"</p><p>\"Yes. I would say you'd like her, but that would be a lie.\"</p><p>\"Are you in love with her?\"</p><p>\"No,\" Yori answered honestly. \"I thought I was until I met you.\"</p><p>Shaundra sighed. \"Don't use me as an excuse, Yori.\"</p><p>\"I'm not. But both you and I have responsibilities. And as leader of Aomori, I have to put my feelings for you aside for the better of my group.</p><p>I must stay with Amaya because the fan girls know of my relationship with her.\" He allowed his finger to dip between her cheeks until he touched her private area. \"Your skin is so soft.\"</p><p>Shaundra melted as the finger entered her. \"Don't. Oh.\"</p><p>Yori continued to finger her. He gently pried her legs apart to get at her better. It didn't take long to bring her to climax.</p><p>Shaundra's back arched and she drenched his fingers with her juices.</p><p>\"Why?\"</p><p>She felt Yori straighten up. \"Just to show how much I want you.\" He stepped away and Shaundra sat up, covering herself with the sheet. \"It has been a pleasure, Ms. Morrison.\"</p><p>Shaundra sat there, dumbfounded, after Yori left the room. \"Damn him,\" she mumbled as her heart settled down. She slid from the table and sniffed the air. His cologne still clung to the room, mixing with the scent of her orgasm. Why had he done that to her? Didn't he know how it would affect her? Did he care? She found her clothes and dressed. She was going to give him such a piece of her mind if she found him in the waiting room when she exited.</p><p>Shaundra slipped on her shoes and opened the door. Drat, everyone was there in the waiting room except Yori.</p><p>Had they seen him leave? She wondered. She looked them in the eye as she approached. She couldn't find a sign that they had.</p><p>\"I hope you're hungry,\" Harper said as he rose.</p><p>\"Starved,\" Shaundra replied quickly. Damn that Yori. Her body still tingled. \"Do you think you can find us some American food in this big mall? I can use a hamburger and lots of fries.\"</p><p>\"I can do fries,\" Riley agreed. \"And a steak. Japanese food is good, but it's not filling. I need beef.\"</p><p>They left the spa and re-entered the mall. There were a lot more people around than when they first entered. Harper led them past some clothing stores, a game arcade and snack bars.</p><p>Shaundra kept looking back over her shoulder, expecting to find Yori standing amongst the crowd. Two more days until the concert and then the grand opening of KiNii. A week later, she would be on her way back to the United States and putting a lot of distance between her and Aomori.</p><p>\"Yori!\" Amaya screamed at her boyfriend when she saw him waiting in the lobby of the hotel when they arrived. Her father was busy at the desk getting the keys to her room and that would buy her some time alone with him. He was dressed surprisingly neat in a dark blue suit cut to fit his tall, thin frame, and he had a haircut. She threw her arms around him.</p><p>He'd lost some weight, but not too much. He usually did during rehearsal time. He returned the hug, but it lacked emotion. He quickly released her when her parents approached.</p><p>Yori bowed to her parents. \"How was your trip?\"</p><p>At least he had sense not to show what he was feeling in front of her parents.</p><p>\"Most enjoyable,\" Dai Saitama said as he shook Yori's hand. \"No turbulence.\"</p><p>Yori turned to her mother, took her hand and kissed it. \"Always a pleasure, Mrs. Saitama.\"</p><p>\"You look good, Yori,\" Kaori Saitama said. \"I told Amaya that suits were made for your frame.\"</p><p>Amaya smirked. Her mother was putting on the charm real thick. Just the other day she had been blessing Yori out for leaving Osaka and not calling often.</p><p>\"How long will you be in town?\"</p><p>\"Just a couple of days,\" Dai answered. \"We're here on business and to see your concert.\"</p><p>\"And don't forget shopping,\" Amaya added as she inched her way toward Yori.</p><p>\"No, let's not forget shopping,\" her father replied. \"I promised her a new telephone.\"</p><p>\"What's wrong with her old phone?\" Yori asked.</p><p>\"Outdated,\" Amaya answered for herself. \"All my friends have the latest.\"</p><p>Dai rolled his eyes at the ceiling in mock horror.</p><p>Amaya smirked again. Her father was a comedian. \"Where are the rest of your friends?\"</p><p>\"Asleep in their room,\" Yori answered.</p><p>\"At this time of the day? What a bunch of slackers.\" Deep inside, she was glad to have some alone time with Yori.</p><p>\"Have you eaten?\"</p><p>\"No, not yet,\" Dai answered.</p><p>\"Good, then I'd like to take you all to breakfast after you bring your things up to your rooms.\" He signaled for a bell boy who came and began putting their luggage on a rack.</p><p>\"Mrs. Saitama and I won't be able to join you for breakfast because we have a meeting with one of our suppliers in an hour. But you and Amaya can go and enjoy yourselves,\" Dai replied.</p><p>Yori followed them on the elevator and up to their rooms. He pulled Amaya aside after her parents went inside. \"Meet me in the lobby in fifteen minutes, and please don't be late. Then, he walked away.</p><p>Amaya watched him leave. \"He's sure acting strange. What is he hiding?\"</p><p>Yori ran into Satoshi as he tried to get back to his own room. Satoshi was dressed in warm-up gear, which meant he was on his way for his morning workout. There was a time Satoshi used to go out jogging, but he was too popular now to do it without being mobbed. Fans would line the street just to get a look at him and some even joined him as he jogged and tried to talk to him. Satoshi gave up his favorite activity as soon as it began to cause traffic jams. Of course, Satoshi was the last person he expected to see, or wanted to see at the moment. He didn't feel like answering any questions.</p><p>\"What's with the suit?\" Satoshi asked once he neared.</p><p>\"The Saitamas have arrived.\"</p><p>\"Oh. See you later.\" He walked off.</p><p>Huh? Yori hadn't thought that would happen. He used the key card, entered his room, and listened while the door closed behind him. Then, he just stood there. He had planned to call Shaundra to let her know that Amaya had arrived. Now he didn't think that was a good idea. Eventually, she would see her with him. Why cause any unnecessary friction? He used the toilet to kill some time and then left the room and went down to the lobby, hoping to get Amaya into the restaurant without running into anyone else he knew. Hopefully, the authors were sleeping late or had already left the building.</p><p>He found Amaya waiting in the lobby.</p><p>\"The restaurant is down on this floor,\" he told her.</p><p>\"Where are your guards?\"</p><p>\"Sleeping probably,\" Yori answered. \"I didn't bother calling them. I know how uncomfortable they make you.\"</p><p>\"But what if someone recognizes you?\"</p><p>\"Then I'll sign an autograph and send them off. But I hope that won't happen.\" Amaya followed him through the lobby and down a couple of aisles until they reached the restaurant. He held the door open for her to step inside. He found the place teeming with life. A lot of families were there eating breakfast along with businessmen in suits. A waitress arrived quickly and escorted them to table in a spot where they could see what was happening around the entire room. She handed them menus.</p><p>\"What do you recommend?\" Amaya asked her once she opened the menu.</p><p>\"That depends on what you like. We serve an American breakfast, as well as a traditional Japanese breakfast.\"</p><p>\"Japanese,\" they both said together.</p><p>\"And a side order of Tamagoyahi,\" Yori told the waitress.</p><p>Moments later, the waitress returned with rice, grilled fish, omelets, pickled vegetables, and pieces of nori to pinch up bits of rice with.</p><p>\"Tamagoyahi?\" Amaya asked.</p><p>\"Eggs infused with maple syrup,\" Yori explained.</p><p>Amaya turned up her nose.</p><p>\"You have to try it. It's delicious.\"</p><p>They discussed life back in Osaka. They were midway through their breakfast when he heard two familiar voices. Yori looked up. Ichiro had arrived dressed in a linen suit, accompanied by Shaundra, also dressed fancy in a green suit. Ichiro's hair was pulled back, exposing his forehead, which caught Yori's attention because he could not recall the last time he'd seen Ichiro without bangs. The two of them made a striking couple and cause several heads to turn in their direction as the waitress seated them. Unfortunately for him, they were placed close to him and Amaya with only a couple of tables separating them.</p><p>Amaya turned around in her chair to see what had his attention and then she quickly turned around again. \"Is that Ichiro?\"</p><p>\"Yes,\" Yori answered.</p><p>\"And that woman from the YouTube video?\"</p><p>\"Yes.\"</p><p>Amaya took another look. \"Ichiro is with a woman?\"</p><p>Yori wished she wouldn't stare so openly at the couple. It would only encourage others to stare at them too. \"Yes, why is that a surprise?\"</p><p>Amaya turned back to face him and to continue eating. \"You know. I didn't think he liked women.\"</p><p>Yori picked up his cup of coffee and tasted it. He now preferred it to tea in the morning. \"Why not?\"</p><p>\"You know. I thought maybe he liked men because....\" She giggled.</p><p>\"No, Ich is not like that. Just because a man has a couple of feminine qualities does not make him gay.\"</p><p>\"Come on, Yori. You have to admit that Ichiro has more than just a couple of feminine quirks. I've never seen him in a suit and I've known him for years. He wears makeup; his movements are graceful, and let's not mention that tea ceremony thing he does.\"</p><p>Yori smiled. \"I will admit that he's a bit eccentric, but definitely not gay.\"</p><p>\"Bi?\"</p><p>Yori considered the possibility. \"No.\"</p><p>\"How do you know?\"</p><p>Amaya never gave up when she had something like this to talk about.</p><p>\"I have lived with him for fifteen years, shared countless bathhouse and shower experiences with him and haven't seen one erection for being around a bunch of naked men.\"</p><p>\"Maybe he just hides it well,\" she insisted.</p><p>\"I don't think he can hide something like that.\" He did recall an incident when that had happened to another one of his friends, but not Ichiro.</p><p>Amaya sipped her tea. \"So, why is he here with her this morning?\"</p><p>\"They are friends. Masaaki thinks she brings out the best in Ichiro.</p><p>He's more talkative when she is around.\"</p><p>Amaya nearly choked on her tea. \"Are they lovers?\"</p><p>\"No,\" Yori answered, almost upsetting his cup of coffee.</p><p>\"Why did you answer like that?\"</p><p>\"The two of them are not lovers. They barely know each other.\"</p><p>Amaya peeped around her chair again. \"He's feeding her. I think they know each other better than you think.\"</p><p>Yori refused to lift his eyes to watch.</p><p>\"They seem pretty friendly to me. Listen to her laugh. Since when is Ichiro so entertaining?\"</p><p>\"Ms. Morrison does that to him.\"</p><p>\"I think they're lovers.\"</p><p>\"No, they are fellow employees. Shaundra and three other authors are here to help with Mr. Niigata's new publishing company. I thought I told you that he asked us to get to know them and be seen with them as part as the promotion.\"</p><p>\"So he brought four female writers here from America? Do they all look like her?\"</p><p>\"No. One is an older female, and the others are two men in their thirties. He has also coupled them with four Asian writers to help with the promotion.\"</p><p>Amaya held her head. \"Too complicated and too many people.\" She paused. \"Why didn't he choose a Japanese female?\"</p><p>\"I don't know. You will have to ask him.\"</p><p>\"Don't think I won't do it.\"</p><p>\"You sound like you have a problem with interracial dating.\"</p><p>\"No, it's more like why look elsewhere for food when there's plenty of chickens walking around in your own back yard?\"</p><p>Yori chuckled. \"That's horrible, even for you.\" He never understood where Amaya came up with half the stuff she said. He had to remember that was one of the things that he liked about her. She could be amusing at times.</p><p>Ichiro laughed merrily as Shaundra told him something. Boy, he'd pay anything to get that on tape. No one was going to believe that the two of them had been talking throughout the entire meal. Ichiro seemed animated in his description about something and Shaundra just laughed.</p><p>\"Why are you staring at them?\"</p><p>Yori didn't realize that he'd been doing this until Amaya's words pierced through the haze. \"It's just nice to see Ich happy.\"</p><p>Amaya peered around at them again. \"I agree. He must really like her.\" Shaundra moved from the table and walked toward the ladies room.</p><p>Amaya ducked back. \"Hey, she's much older than he is.\"</p><p>\"Yes, that's what he likes about her. She's mature and not a giggling idiot.\"</p><p>\"And she has a killer body.\"</p><p>\"I hadn't noticed. Anyway, that's their business.\" He looked down at his watch. It was close to nine in the morning and Masaaki wanted all of them at the Dome for rehearsal at noon. \"Would you like to come see us rehearse today?\"</p><p>\"What time?\" Amaya asked.</p><p>\"Noon.\"</p><p>\"Can't,\" Amaya answered. \"Got plans.\" She didn't offer any further explanation.</p><p>Shaundra came back from the restroom. She nodded at him as she passed. Moments later, Ichiro settled their bill and the two of them rose from the table and prepared to leave.</p><p>Amaya took one last look. \"How long is she going to be in town?\"</p><p>\"Another two weeks. Why?\"</p><p>\"Just wondering.\"</p><p>He knew there was more to it than that.</p><p>Amaya stretched. \"I think it's time for a nap.\"</p><p>Yori signaled for the waitress. Maybe he had time to telephone Shaundra before rehearsal. The waitress came and he settled their bill.</p><p>Amaya rose and walked out of the restaurant ahead of him. Yori followed her out, catching a glimpse of Ichiro and Shaundra as they slipped into the limousine with Kenshin. Where are they off to? No wonder Satoshi hadn't been talkative this morning. Yori bet he knew that Ichiro had finally manned up and asked Shaundra out on a date. Leave it to Ichiro to grow some balls on the day Amaya arrived.</p><p>\"What are you going to do the rest of the morning while I rest?\"</p><p>Amaya asked as they walked toward the elevator. They stepped in once the elevator arrived.</p><p>\"I need to call home and check on my parents, and then it's off to rehearsal for the rest of day. I'm sorry I couldn't arrange more time off to be with you today, but it's going to be late when I return.\"</p><p>\"That's okay. I'll busy myself shopping and visiting the mall.\" She stretched again as the elevator door opened on the ninth floor. \"Maybe I'll get a massage. I heard there's a place in the mall that does excellent work.\"</p><p>Yori ordered his face not to twitch at the mention of the massage parlor. Instead, his mind replayed the little erotic episode of his seduction of Shaundra Morrison while she lay naked on one of the tables. It sent a bolt of adrenaline down to his jock. This was one of those times he was thankful that his suit jacket covered his pelvic area. He walked Amaya to her room and made sure she was safely inside. Then, he headed back to the elevator to find Satoshi and to find out what he knew.</p><p>\"This is Meiji Shrine,\" Ichiro explained as they walked through the courtyard of the temple he'd taken her to. \"It is dedicated to a deified spirits of Emperor Meiji and his consorts, Empress Shoken.\"</p><p>\"This place is really lovely,\" Shaundra replied as she followed him around. \"And so well-maintained.\" They had been together most of the morning and he was like a breath of fresh air, so young and innocent.</p><p>\"I used to come here often as a child with my grandmother, but not much now.\"</p><p>In some ways, he was still a child, but then again, that's what she liked about him. \"Why do I have the feeling that you regret becoming a singer?\"</p><p>Ichiro sent a dazzling smile her way as he walked her over to a bench to rest. \"Don't get me wrong. I love Aomori, the music and all the advantages it has accorded me, but sometimes I miss just being me. Like, for instance, today, I am on a date with a very beautiful woman, but I'm not exactly alone with her because there are three burly bodyguards lurking nearby.\"</p><p>Shaundra's eyes widened. He thinks I'm beautiful. \"That is for your protection,\" Shaundra reminded him when she came to her senses.</p><p>\"Yes, I know, but I have no privacy. What if I wanted to kiss you? You'd be embarrassed to do so in front of them.\"</p><p>Shaundra ran her tongue over her lips. \"Do you wish to kiss me?\"</p><p>Shaundra asked. Even she wasn't foolish enough to let that moment slip by. Would it be different than Yori's? She shook her head to get Yori's face out of it. Pretend he doesn't exist.</p><p>\"Ever since the first time I saw you.\"</p><p>Ooh, I didn't know that. Shaundra scooted closer to him and took both of his hands into hers. They were much bigger than hers, but smooth, and the nails were manicured.</p><p>Ichiro tried to snatch his hands away.</p><p>\"Kiss me,\" Shaundra told him.</p><p>\"Do what?\"</p><p>\"Kiss me.\" Suddenly, she very much wanted him to do it. Her eyes locked in on the delicate curve of his lips.</p><p>Ichiro looked away shyly. \"I can't. It is not appropriate in such a public place.\"</p><p>Damn these people and their antiquated ways, she said to herself.</p><p>Shaundra looked around. \"No one is paying any attention to us except the bodyguards and they look kind of bored.\"</p><p>Ichiro looked around, took a deep breath and leaned toward her.</p><p>Shaundra took the uncertainty from him by placing her mouth on his.</p><p>It was so soft. His lips parted and covered hers. Her eyes widened. Heat rushed up from her crotch to her collar as she leaned in closer to savor the sweetness.</p><p>Ichiro's hands gripped her shoulders. His tongue darted inside, pleasantly taking her by surprise with his forwardness. He groaned, obviously turned on by what they were doing.</p><p>The crotch in her panties dampened. Shaundra closed her eyes as her feelings got all tangled and her heart raced. She pulled away from him, breathing hard. Her body felt on fire with just one kiss from this blue-eyed babe. Shit, what am I going to do? Ichiro opened his eyes and nervously scooted away from her. He crossed his legs and looked away shyly. \"That was pleasant.\"</p><p>Shaundra nodded still overcome from the rush of emotion she'd just experience. Served her right for messing with an innocent. \"Yes, and the bodyguards didn't try to tackle me to the ground. In fact, one of them is even blushing.\" God, she was so embarrassed. What must they think of me? Ichiro turned around to see and then turned back toward her. He blushed even more.</p><p>\"See, it is possible to have a normal life if you're willing to work at it.\"</p><p>Ichiro cleared his throat. \"Speaking of work, I better take you back to the hotel before Masaaki kills me. We have to rehearse before the big concert tomorrow.\"</p><p>\"That's okay. I do understand deadlines and it's been a perfect morning. Thank you for taking me to see this shrine. I don't know when it was that I last had such a relaxing time.\"</p><p>Ichiro rose awkwardly and helped her to her feet.</p><p>Shaundra glanced down. He had an erection. She would pretend not to notice and not joke about it.</p><p>Ichiro started the conversation before her. \"How do you cope with all your fans back in the United States?\" He bravely took her hand and held it as they walked toward the gate of temple with the guards following close behind.</p><p>\"It's nothing compared to what you go through. The only time my fans are interested in me is at book signings.\"</p><p>He helped her back into the limo and sat down next to her. \"I've read some of your books,\" he replied as Kenshin pulled away from the curb and headed back to the hotel. \"You are a very good writer.\"</p><p>\"Really? You've actually read my books? Which one is your favorite?\"</p><p>\"The one about the older woman and the younger man. If I Could Turn Back Time.\"</p><p>Shaundra gasped. \"You have read my book. I am flabbergasted and honored. What did you like about it?\"</p><p>\"The ending,\" he replied, smiling at her.</p><p>Was he teasing her? \"That's odd. Why?\"</p><p>\"The couple found a way to be happy after all the obstacles put before them. I like those kinds of endings.\"</p><p>\"I do too, but real life is never that simple. I can manipulate my stories to make them end any way I want them to, but I can't get a happy ending in my own relationship.\"</p><p>\"Why not?\"</p><p>\"Because I've never found the right man.\"</p><p>\"I can't believe that. What about your husband?\"</p><p>\"Nice, but not without his share of issues. I loved him until the day he died, but our marriage still lacked the spontaneity of my novels.\"</p><p>\"But I bet the sex was great?\" He clasped his hand over his mouth in embarrassment.</p><p>Shaundra chuckled. \"Please stop blushing. You're going to have to get comfortable with what I write about if we're to be friends, and yes, it was pretty great most of the time.\"</p><p>Ichiro removed his hand. \"Are you in a relationship now?\"</p><p>\"Fine time to ask, but yes. I've been with him for years.\"</p><p>\"He does not make you happy.\"</p><p>\"No, he's nice enough, but I don't love him.\"</p><p>\"Then why are you with him, if you don't mind me asking?\"</p><p>Shaundra sighed. Why did twenty-five-year-olds see things so clearly? \"Because I haven't found a way to end it. I can't find the words to say &amp;#8222;you're a nice man, but I just want to be friends.'\"</p><p>\"Men don't like that sentence,\" Ichiro teased. \"See, you just said it.\"</p><p>Shaundra smiled. \"Yes, to you, but not to him.\"</p><p>\"What would happen if you did tell him? Would he hit you?\"</p><p>\"No, he'd probably ask why and then I'd have to make up a lie to spare his feelings.\"</p><p>Ichiro shook his head. \"You don't strike me as the lying type.\"</p><p>\"I'm not, but I can't tell him the truth without hurting him.\"</p><p>\"You're not attracted to him anymore?\"</p><p>Shaundra shook her head. \"No, when I look at him, I see friend, not lover.\"</p><p>Ichiro leaned closer. \"What does a lover look like?\"</p><p>Those blue eyes hypnotized her. \"Kind of like you, young, virile and with a nice body.\"</p><p>\"And he has none of these qualities?\"</p><p>He was so close his cologne made her dizzy. She wanted to kiss him again. \"No, he's fifty-one years old and everything has gone south, if you know what I mean.\" Shaundra blushed. \"Maybe I should not be telling you these things, but I've never had anyone that I can truly talk to. I feel comfortable talking to you.\"</p><p>He raised his hand and brushed her bangs away from her eyes. \"So he is no longer sexually appealing to you?\"</p><p>Shaundra trembled from his touch. \"That's exactly it and I feel so horrible for thinking this way since he's just a year older than I am. When I look into a mirror, I don't see a fifty-year-old woman staring back and maybe it's the same way with him when he looks into a mirror. But when we're together, I see that his body looks different than it did ten years ago.</p><p>He doesn't have that muscular build or nice abs that used to turn me on.\"</p><p>\"Oh, I see,\" Ichiro said. A light blush flushed his cheeks.</p><p>She leaned against his shoulder and rested his head on it. \"No, you don't. You're twenty-five and gorgeous, and I feel bad because I'm fifty and I find you attractive. I don't think things are supposed to work this way. I just know I would feel horrible if someone told me that they didn't want me anymore because I was old and saggy.\"</p><p>Ichiro raised her head, lowered his lips to hers and gently kissed her. \"I don't think that would happen. You're fifty now and I don't find you saggy.\"</p><p>The heat rushed up through her body again. \"You haven't seen me naked.\"</p><p>\"Are you saggy?\"</p><p>\"No.\" She felt like stripping and proving it to him.</p><p>\"Then don't worry about something that may never happen for another twenty years or so. Something like that isn't important to me.\"</p><p>Shaundra snuggled up to him. \"How did you get so smart?\"</p><p>\"By not talking and just listening.\"</p><p>She listened to the steady beat of his heart against his chest. \"I think you are good for my ego, Ichiro.\" They arrived back at the hotel sooner than she expected. Shaundra moved away from him and sat straight in the seat.</p><p>Ichiro reached over and touched her hand. \"Before we go in, I need to ask you something.\"</p><p>\"Sure, anything,\" Shaundra said staring down at his hand.</p><p>\"Are you sexually attracted to Yori?\"</p><p>Shaundra sighed. Damn. \"Yes.\"</p><p>\"I see.\" He paused. \"Are you sexually attracted to me?\"</p><p>Shaundra raised her head and looked deeply into his eyes. Lie, lie and end this now before you hurt him. \"Yes,\" she answered honestly. \"Now you see my dilemma. How do you choose between two angels when you're old enough to be both their mothers?\"</p><p>Kenshin opened the car door and helped both of them out.</p><p>Ichiro took her hand. \"I will not ask you to make such a decision.</p><p>Having you as a friend is more than I can ask.\"</p><p>\"That is nice of you to say, but I'm old enough to read your eyes even if you don't say the words, Ichiro. I don't want to hurt either of you so I don't think I can make that kind of decision. You do understand that I will be returning to the United States when all of this is over?\"</p><p>\"That is why I will not pressure you into choosing me or Yori. Just promise me that you will end your old relationship and find someone who will make you happy.\"</p><p>They walked up the stairs. \"I promise.\"</p><p>\"But in the meantime, please be my date for the duration of your stay.\"</p><p>Date? He wants to date me? Reality crept back in at that very moment.</p><p>\"Are you just asking this because you know Yori's fiancee is here and you don't want me to do anything that would put Aomori in an embarrassing situation?\"</p><p>Ichiro's hand tightened on hers and then he removed it and opened the door for her. \"He told you?\"</p><p>\"Yes.\"</p><p>\"Surprising. I was sure he would try to lie and cover it up.\"</p><p>\"No, he told me everything.\"</p><p>\"And you still like him?\"</p><p>Shaundra shrugged her shoulders. \"I don't know what I feel when it comes to him. It is completely different than what I feel for you. There, I've said it. I would never come between Yori and his fiancee, nor you and Yori.\" They entered the lobby.</p><p>\"I don't understand women, but I'm willing to be your knight in shining armor for the time you are here. You shouldn't have to be alone while he waits to come to his senses.\"</p><p>\"Then I accept. But it has nothing to do with whether he makes a decision or not.\" Not exactly a lie, or the truth either.</p><p>They walked toward the elevator, ignoring the stares as they held hands. The elevator arrived and they stepped in. Ichiro pulled her to him and planted a deep and sensual kiss upon her lips. Shaundra melted in his arms. He released her. \"What was that for?\"</p><p>\"Just to let you know that I also find you sexually attractive and don't care about sags. The Shaundra Morrison I admire is the fifty-year-old author in this elevator with me, and I would be honored to act as your friend, date or lover as long as you allow me to do so.\"</p><p>The elevator opened on their floor and Yori stood on the other side.</p><p>\"You're late,\" he told Ichiro. \"Where have you been?\"</p><p>\"On a date,\" Ichiro replied.</p><p>\"Masaaki was worried about you. You know how he is when it comes to rehearsals.\"</p><p>Ichiro stepped off the elevator, still holding her hand. \"Practice does not start for another hour.\"</p><p>The three walked toward her door. Ichiro bowed to her and left her with Yori.</p><p>\"What do you think you're doing?\" Yori asked her once Ichiro was out of ear range.</p><p>\"I'm not doing anything.\"</p><p>\"Looks like you're doing something to me. You had breakfast with him and went out on a date with him.\"</p><p>\"We spent a lovely morning at the Meiji Shrine. You can verify this with the bodyguards and Kenshin if you must. He thought I might like to see some of Tokyo since I'll only be here a couple more weeks. Is that a problem?\"</p><p>\"Not if you're just leading him on.\"</p><p>Shaundra leaned against the door. \"I don't understand what you want me to do. First, you seem interested and then you aren't. You tell me that Ichiro likes me and then you get upset when he takes me on an outing.</p><p>And let's not mention that little finger exercise you performed on me yesterday. Now as much as I enjoyed it, you went and ruined it by telling me that your fiancee was on her way to town. In my book, it means you're interested in a little fling with the older woman, but not at the expense of your girlfriend finding out.\"</p><p>\"That is not true. I did not know she was coming and did not mean to offend you.\" He leaned against the wall. \"Lately, I don't know what is wrong with me. I thought I was happy and knew what my future held for me. But now I'm not sure. Amaya and I have been engaged since we were kids.\"</p><p>\"Then why mess it up? You had every intention on marrying her before I arrived. Don't give up a lifetime commitment and a future with a woman you love because you're tempted by another woman. Don't you love her?\"</p><p>\"I don't know,\" Yori confessed. \"Things are so confused.\"</p><p>\"Let me make this easy for you. Don't hurt her by thinking you can have your cake and eat it too.\"</p><p>\"What does that mean?\"</p><p>\"It means you can't have a relationship with both of us. Anyway, she is a better choice. I'm so much older than you and I'll be returning to the United States when this is over.\" She put the key card in the door and opened it.</p><p>\"I don't care about your age,\" he said, suddenly filling the doorway.</p><p>Before she knew it, the door closed and locked with both of them on the inside of the room. \"What are you doing?\"</p><p>\"I don't know.\" He pulled her into his arms and kissed her senseless.</p><p>\"You're late,\" Masaaki said as Yori entered the Dome rehearsal room.</p><p>\"I'm just five minutes late.\"</p><p>\"Where were you?\" Satoshi asked. \"We sent you to get Ichiro and he beat you here.\"</p><p>\"Talking. It doesn't matter. I'm here now.\"</p><p>\"You need to change,\" Masaaki informed him. \"No sense in getting that suit sweaty.\"</p><p>Who was Masaaki kidding? He felt drenched from the run over from the hotel after Shaundra kicked him out of her room. Damn her. What did she expect him to do? He couldn't just drop Amaya or pretend the two of them didn't have a lifelong relationship. Didn't she understand that he was torn in two about the entire situation? He hurried to the back to get into his practice clothes. Maybe he needed to dance until the exhaustion set in. He removed his suit, put on a pair of sweat pants and a T-shirt and dashed back into the practice room just as the rest of the performers arrived. There were five other groups performing tomorrow besides Aomori and they took up much of the space.</p><p>\"Let's move this party to the stage,\" Masaaki ordered.</p><p>Everyone got up and followed him out of the practice hall.</p><p>Ichiro kept looking at him while they walked.</p><p>\"Nothing happened,\" Yori said. \"She turned me away.\"</p><p>\"Smart cookie,\" Ichiro replied as he found an empty seat to wait until it was their turn.</p><p>Bushido, the opening act took the stage as the other groups settled into seats to watch. Bushido consisted of five Japanese youngsters who also worked for Mr. Niigata. Aomori had taken then under their wing and were training them. The leader, Kei, had dyed his hair blond and sported a Mohawk. The other four had cut away their hair, too, to a shorter style that made them look older and more mature than their eighteen years. They reminded him a lot of Aomori when they had been that age.</p><p>Three acts later, Aomori took the stage with their back up dancers and, when their turn was over, they returned to their seats to watch the closing act. An hour later, Yori felt so exhausted he began to doze in his seat. He promised only to catch a couple of winks while Masaaki gave them a rousing speech to end their day... Satoshi nudged him. \"Wake up, princess. It's time to go.\"</p><p>Yori opened his eyes and found his three friends staring down at him.</p><p>\"What's wrong with you?\" Takumijo asked \"You never fell asleep in rehearsal before.\"</p><p>\"I'm just tired,\" Yori replied.</p><p>\"That's a guilty conscience,\" Satoshi replied, and walked away.</p><p>Yori rubbed his eyes, rose from his seat and followed his friends back to the changing room to get his things. \"Damn Ichiro,\" the muttered to himself. Why did he have to ask her out on a date? Hopefully, things would go better tomorrow. Maybe the concert and the crowds would pull him out of his misery. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Riley whistled. \"Look at this crowd.\"</p><p>Shaundra turned around in her seat. \"Oh my word. This place is packed.\" Mr. Niigata had arranged for them to enter the Dome earlier.</p><p>Smart man. Young girls and women screamed Aomori's name and held banners for their favorite groups from the balcony even though the super group was nowhere in sight.</p><p>\"Think of all the money being made,\" Harper said at her right. To him, everything revolved around money.</p> <p>Shaundra turned her attention back to the stage area. Six groups were slated to perform during the next five hours. There had been a lot of action earlier as the stage hands moved instruments and scenery around, but now the dark curtains were down and drawn. Multi-colored lights flickered and the intro music began to play. The huge dome went silent and the curtains lifted. The first group, Bushido, took the stage and the fans went wild, stamping their feet and clapping their hands to the rhythmic hip-hop song.</p><p>The group was decked out in bright colors with western-world haircuts. The leader, a blond, was cute, had a nice, sexy high voice that made the young women in the audience scream. This went on for about an hour or so. Bushido performed four songs in Japanese and then disappeared behind the curtain. There was a brief intermission, during which the ladies decided to go to the restroom. After waiting in a long line, all four women returned to their seats just in time for the next act to appear.</p><p>This time, a group of young women arrived on stage dressed in mini dresses and skirts and they performed a medley of juvenile songs that made Shaundra's stomach turn. They were cute, but the only girl group she liked was the Supremes.</p><p>Harper left during the second intermission and had not returned by the time the fourth group came on. The beautiful song made her stop squirming in her chair. The curtain opened and Aomori stood on stage dressed in black and white suits. None of the outfits were alike, probably designed to match the wearer's personality. Their hair was stylishly arranged, and they wore a ton of stage makeup to emphasize their perfect faces.</p><p>The crowd went wild and joined them in the song, nearly drowning out Aomori a couple of times. When the song ended, they didn't get a chance to relax because the boys broke into a fast number that showcased their sensational dance techniques. Ichiro had some pretty serious moves for someone who hardly ever talked. No wonder he'd turned down the girl in the club that night. Those hip movements and pelvis thrusts made Shaundra's body temperature spike.</p> <p>Satoshi performed a solo while the rest of the group went backstage.</p><p>He had a really nice voice, kind of deep and sensual, which made the women in the audience scream even more. When the rest of the group returned, they were dressed in jeans, tees and vests and performed some skits while Satoshi changed. He joined them a short time later and encouraged the audience to participate.</p><p>She found their antics delightful, including Takumijo, who used his looks and build to command attention. A giggling young woman was taken from the audience to participate in a skit, but all she managed to do was scream and fan herself with her hand while holding tightly to Yori.</p><p>Aomori performed another round of fast songs accompanied by their backup dancers. They disappeared backstage for a rest.</p><p>Shaundra looked down at her watch. Four hours had passed. The curtain rose again and Mr. Niigata, Harper and another Japanese man she didn't recognize appeared on stage. Mr. Niigata introduced him as the owner and CEO of Flowing Magazine. Shit, she had forgotten all about the cover.</p><p>After a brief mention about the opening of their joint publishing company, a huge covered billboard was lowered from the ceiling and Jay Adams, the photographer friend of Harper's, appeared to talk to the fans about Aomori's involvement with their latest edition. The fans screamed Aomori's name and then Jay unveiled the cover. There was a deafening silence and then stomping and excited screaming of Yori's name.</p> <p>\"Oh, my goodness,\" Shaundra said, staring at her image bigger than life on the billboard with Yori. Jay had captured them in a very provocative pose on the chaise lounge. She hardly recognized herself due to the hair, makeup and airbrushing of her imperfections. She had to admit that she did look beautiful, and Yori was so handsome. His image seemed to jump from the billboard. Fans pulled out their cameras and their dreaded cell phones. They began taking pictures of the poster and were probably emailing it to their friends and sending it directly to Facebook and YouTube.</p><p>\"Do you think the fan girls liked the cover?\" Shaundra asked Dorothy as she eased her sunglasses out of her purse and put them on.</p><p>\"I don't know,\" Dorothy admitted. \"But I wouldn't want to be in your shoes at the moment. How are we going to get you out of here without anyone finding out who you are?\"</p><p>True, she hadn't seen many African American females since they'd entered the Dome, if any. \"I hope Harper and Mr. Niigata have a plan for my escape. You know most of them have already seen the two of us together on YouTube. For all I know, they are already planning my demise.\"</p><p>\"They're a bunch of teenage girls and young women. What can they do to you?\"</p><p>The publisher lifted the billboard and left the stage under the shouts for Aomori to return to the stage. Mr. Niigata was smart enough to send in another act. Shaundra scooted down in her seat. She didn't want to think of all the awful things Aomori's fans could do to her before she left Japan.</p><p>\"Who is that woman?\" Kaori Saitama asked Yori after the concert ended and they were all backstage at the after-concert celebration.</p><p>\"Ichiro's girlfriend,\" Amaya answered for him.</p> <p>\"So why isn't she posing with him instead of your fiance?\"</p><p>\"That is a good question, Mother. Yori, why isn't she posing with Ichiro?\"</p><p>\"Because the photographer asked me. You know how shy Ich is.\"</p><p>\"But to pose so sexy with a stranger is...\" Kaori didn't get a chance to finish the sentence.</p><p>\"Good publicity strategy,\" her husband, Dai, replied. \"Flowing is trying broaden its readership by reaching beyond Japan.\"</p><p>Yori did not expect his future father-in-law to be in agreement or be so knowledgeable about trends.</p><p>\"I wish I would have known about this issue. I would have put in an ad for our business,\" Dai replied.</p><p>\"But, Father, don't you think it's shocking that a woman her age would agree to be photographed in such a way?\"</p><p>\"What's wrong with it?\" Dai asked. \"She's a beautiful middle-aged woman. Ichiro is a lucky man. It is an honor for an American woman to be asked to grace the cover of a Japanese magazine. It would have been rude for her to refuse.\"</p><p>\"Why are you taking her side?\" Amaya whined. \"She is trying to make a name for herself with her ties to Aomori.\"</p><p>\"Ms. Morrison is a successful romance writer in America. Her latest book is number one on the best sellers list. She does not need Aomori to gain fame,\" Yori said in Shaundra's defense.</p><p>\"Why are you sticking up for her?\" Amaya asked.</p><p>\"I'm not sticking up for her.\" He needed a nice stiff drink. He signaled for one of the waiters hired to cater the evening event. He brought with him a tray of mixed drinks. Dai, being the eldest, chose the first glass, and Yori reached for a glass of Bourbon. The women declined alcohol and chose iced tea instead.</p><p>Yori scanned the room for Shaundra. He found her off in a corner at a table talking to Ichiro. From where he stood, the two of them seemed pretty friendly. Satoshi and Takumijo were entertaining the other two female Japanese authors and the one named Dorothy was in a heated conversation with John Sampson, their music arranger, and some of his friends.</p><p>Ichiro rose from his seat, helped Shaundra up and walked her over to the food. Yori gulped. The black dress she wore hugged all the right places. He rejoined the conversation just in time to see the pissed look on Amaya's face. He finished his drink. Tonight, he'd entertained and pleased thousands of people, was on the top of the Asian music charts, engaged to a very lovely young woman, yet at that moment, he wished he could just walk away from the complication of it all. Maybe he should volunteer for his military duty early.</p><p>His body still ached from the performance. He would have preferred to go back to the hotel and go to bed, but Mr. Niigata and Masaaki insisted that they stay and fraternize with the public after their shows.</p><p>\"How did you business meeting go?\" Yori asked Dai as they headed toward the food. Amaya walked behind them with her mother, speaking rapidly in their dialect.</p><p>\"It went well. The suppliers had some great material and I spent a lot of money. They are supposed to deliver it next week so we can begin using it in our fall designs.\"</p><p>\"Have you finalized your plans for the fall fashion show?\" Every year, Dai and his company put on this fancy event to showcase their fashions.</p><p>\"Yes, I only wished you and Aomori were free to work the runway.</p><p>Just think of all the young women that would come if I had you there.\"</p><p>\"We'll be on tour, but maybe next year.\"</p><p>Satoshi and the others made it over to the buffet table and he introduced them to Mr. and Mrs. Saitama and, of course, they already knew Amaya. She quickly pulled Satoshi over to her. Luckily, Ichiro had taken Shaundra back to their seats before Amaya started asking Satoshi questions.</p><p>\"What's wrong with Ichiro?\"</p><p>\"What do you mean?\" Satoshi asked. He placed some food on Amaya's plate and then his own. Dai and Kaori went off to speak to the CEO of Flowing to see if maybe they still could take an ad out in the magazine, leaving him alone with their pissed off daughter.</p><p>\"Why is he acting so anti-social? I haven't seen you guys in a long time. The least he could do is come over and say hello.\"</p><p>\"You know Ichiro isn't much of a socializer, and besides, he has company.\"</p><p>\"Tell me the truth. Are the two of them dating?\"</p><p>\"Yes,\" Satoshi answered.</p><p>Yori made a face that Amaya did not see. \"See, I told you. She thinks I am lying to her.\"</p><p>Satoshi laughed. \"Why would Yori lie about Ichiro dating?\"</p><p>\"Amaya seems to think that Ichiro is more into men than women.\"</p><p>Satoshi chuckled. \"I wish.\"</p><p>Amaya punched Satoshi on the arm. \"Are you still teasing him?\"</p><p>\"Makes my day. You know how pretty he is.\"</p><p>\"Don't try to change the subject.\"</p><p>\"Amaya seems to think that Ms. Morrison and I have something going on since we have been photographed together lately.\"</p><p>\"It's part of a publicity promotion,\" Satoshi said to Amaya.</p><p>Takumijo entered the room with a man.</p><p>\"Isn't that Osamu Nakaumura?\" Amaya asked.</p><p>\"Yes,\" Satoshi answered. \"It's him.\"</p><p>Yori turned to the door and frowned. Was Takumijo crazy or what? He knew how Mr. Niigata felt about Nakaumura. Leave it to him to pull such a foolish stunt.</p><p>Takumijo walked over and introduced him to Amaya. \"This is my friend Osamu Nakaumura.\"</p><p>\"I've seen all your movies,\" Amaya said as she moved near him.</p><p>\"You're a very good actor.\"</p><p>Osamu bowed, obviously overwhelmed by the young woman. \"Thank you.\"</p><p>\"How do you know Takumijo?\"</p><p>\"We worked together on a drama a couple of years ago and became friends. We get together for drinks from time to time whenever he comes to town.\"</p><p>Yori kept his comment to himself. He didn't really like Osamu. The other man had never done a thing to him, but he didn't like the way Takumijo changed in his presence. Not to mention, he was notorious for getting drunk and causing problems.</p><p>\"Where is your lovely wife?\" Satoshi asked.</p><p>\"She has a headache and decided not to join me,\" Osamu answered.</p><p>I bet, Yori said to himself. In all the conversations he'd had with Takumijo about Osamu, not once had he mentioned that the man's wife ever joined them for any of their meetings.</p><p>An hour or so had passed when he noticed that he didn't see Ichiro or Shaundra. Amaya and her mother had gone off to the ladies room and Dai was still hobnobbing with the publisher, leaving him on his own to sulk.</p><p>He looked around and noticed Satoshi sitting off by himself, making him the prime source to ask. He walked over to him and sat down. \"Where is Ich?\"</p><p>\"He left,\" Satoshi answered. \"He said he was tired and was going back to the hotel to go to bed.\"</p><p>\"And Shaundra?\"</p><p>\"She went with him.\"</p><p>Yori scowled. \"She what?\"</p><p>\"Maybe they've gone to bed together.\"</p><p>Yori glared at him. \"Ich wouldn't know what to do with a woman.\"</p><p>\"Do not underestimate him. You also thought he would never ask her out on a date. So far, he's doing pretty well for himself, and everyone has seen her on his arm tonight.\"</p><p>\"You know it's not safe for her now that our fans have seen that billboard.\"</p><p>\"Ich won't let anything happen to her. He does know martial arts. He's been pretty protective of her all night.\"</p><p>\"You're enjoying this, aren't you?\"</p><p>\"Very much,\" Satoshi replied. \"I just love to see you squirm.\"</p><p>\"Why?\"</p><p>\"Because you caused it by avoiding the fact that you are in love with her.\"</p><p>\"I am not.\"</p><p>Satoshi raised an eyebrow. \"Oh, no, then why are you thinking about sneaking out of here and going over to the hotel to check up on them?\" God damn Satoshi. The man knew him better than he knew himself.</p><p>\"So, what do you advise?\"</p><p>\"See that your future in-laws get back to the hotel safely and spend the rest of the evening with your fiancee.\"</p><p>Yori sighed. \"I should have asked Takumijo. I have a feeling that he would have told me to go over to that hotel and kick Ichiro's ass.\"</p><p>\"Takumijo has his own demons to deal with,\" Satoshi answered without further explanation.</p><p>\"He better not put a finger on her,\" Yori replied.</p><p>\"Out of your control. You didn't see the way he looked at her when she came backstage after the concert in that dress. Or how he looked at her all evening. I wouldn't be surprised if Ichiro gets lucky tonight.\"</p><p>\"Go on, just rub it in. Have your chuckle at my expense.\"</p><p>\"And I'm enjoying every minute of it. But look at it this way. It could be me instead of Ichiro.\"</p><p>\"What do you mean?\"</p><p>\"I had the opportunity to put the moves on her from the first night at the club when we met. But I stepped back because I knew you wanted her.\"</p><p>\"Don't tell me you're interested in her too?\"</p><p>\"I'm not saying that, or denying it either. The point to this story is you need to make up your mind. If you want her, tell her. Break off this farce with Amaya and go to Shaundra. If not, just forget about her and let Ichiro be happy.\"</p><p>\"He won't be happy. She's leaving after the opening of the publishing company. They'll be separated by an ocean.\"</p><p>\"Maybe Ichiro will fly there to see her.\"</p><p>\"Ichiro's life is here. He has plans to open restaurants.\"</p><p>\"Sometimes plans change,\" Satoshi replied with much relevance. \"He can open his restaurants in the United States, and by the way, how were you going to manage a relationship with her?\"</p><p>\"I hadn't figured that out yet.\" He paused. \"Remind me to never talk to you again.\" He rose.</p><p>Satoshi laughed.</p><p>The Saitamas returned.</p><p>\"Are you ready to go back to the hotel?\" Amaya asked.</p><p>\"Whenever you're ready.\"</p><p>Kaori yawned. \"I think it's getting late.\"</p><p>\"Maybe I'll join you on the walk back,\" Satoshi said. \"This party is getting pretty lame and I need to check on Ichiro.\"</p><p>\"What's wrong with him?\" Amaya asked. \"Is he ill?\"</p><p>\"No, he's in love,\" Satoshi told her.</p><p>Shaundra stepped out of the shower, dried off and wrapped a big, luxurious robe around her to move from the bathroom to the bedroom. The night couldn't have been more perfect, she thought as she dried her hair with another towel. She removed the robe and slipped into a red gown and matching robe. She walked back over to the vanity mirror and finished drying her hair. She pinned it to the top of her head and headed for the bed. Someone knocked on the door, disturbing her.</p><p>Shaundra marched to the door and opened it.</p><p>Yori stood there, looking her over from head to toe. \"You better be alone,\" he said, scowling at her.</p><p>Shaundra stepped back and he entered, towering over her as he closed the door behind him and locked it without looking. He reached up and released her hair from the pins, swept her up into his arms and carried her to the bedroom.</p><p>\"What is the meaning of this?\" Shaundra asked as he lowered her on to the bed.</p><p>\"I have to be with you.\" He lay down on top of her and pressed his lips to hers.</p><p>Her arms wrapped around his neck as his tongue slipped between her lips. The taste of alcohol filled her mouth. Not truly unpleasant that way and real sexy. \"We really should not be doing this,\" she said as he flipped over until she was atop him.</p><p>\"I know, but we are going to do this now and worry about the consequences tomorrow.\" He pulled her head back down and continued to kiss her. Her breasts heaved and the nipples budded when she felt his erection pushing into her stomach.</p><p>\"What about your fiancee?\"</p><p>\"What about her?\" he asked as he kissed her neck. His hands inched up the back of the negligee until she felt the cold air from the air conditioner against both cheeks, which was quickly replaced by a pair of warm hands.</p><p>\"Convenient,\" he replied. \"Were you expecting company?\"</p><p>\"No,\" she gasped as he gave each cheek a hard squeeze.</p><p>\"Are you sure?\" He squeezed again. \"Not even Ichiro.\"</p><p>She froze. Why were men so stupid? \"No.\" She rolled off of him.</p><p>\"Why did you pause? Did I touch a nerve?\"</p><p>Of course he had. \"Why do you ask that?\"</p><p>Yori turned until he faced her. \"You left the after-concert party with him. I kind of thought you came back here with him.\"</p><p>\"Then you were wrong.\" The mood disappeared. \"Ichiro was tired, as you should be. Please leave.\"</p><p>\"But I thought we...\"</p><p>\"Think again. The only reason you're here is because you thought he was here. Well, you've wasted both our time.\"</p><p>Yori eased off the bed, still very much erect and very sexy with bed- tussled hair. \"Just tell me one thing. If he hadn't been tired, would you have gone to bed with him?\"</p><p>\"That is none of your business. At least I would be sure that he really wanted me and wasn't playing a childish game.\"</p><p>Yori smirked. \"It's not game. I don't want you to sleep with him. I know I'm being selfish, but that is just the way I am. And stay away from the bastard Satoshi too.\" He walked out of the bedroom and into the living room. She had half a mind to follow and give him a piece of her mind.</p><p>Arrogant assed man. She heard the door open and close and she waited to make sure he was gone before she walked into the living room and secured the door. She wouldn't be losing any sleep over him, she thought as she crawled between the covers. To hell with him. She closed her eyes and they slowly opened them again. \"Satoshi?\" Oh God, this was going to end so badly. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\"Congratulations on your success,\" Harper said to Shaundra the next morning after they had all gathered in the hotel restaurant for breakfast.</p><p>\"What are you talking about?\" She was still in a rotten mood and didn't want any shit from Harper.</p><p>He pushed the newspaper he had been reading toward her. \"You made front page news. The headlines.\"</p><p>Shaundra stared down and gulped. \"I'm dead.\" It was the magazine cover featuring her and Yori. It looked real sensual even in smaller print.</p> <p>She read the caption. \"America's most prolific erotic author and Japan's bad boy pop star make beautiful music together.\" She sighed. \"Crappy title and a bunch of lies. Can I sue them?\" She passed the newspaper to Dorothy who looked like she had a hard night. \"What time did you get in last night?\" The last time she'd seen Dorothy, she had been headed back to the hotel to have a few drinks with John Sampson.</p><p>\"About four hours ago and, yes, I do have a killer headache.\"</p><p>\"Sounds like you had fun.\"</p><p>\"Yes, and I got laid too,\" she announced.</p><p>Shaundra nearly choked on her coffee.</p> <p>\"I kind of like this caption,\" Dorothy replied. \"But I could change my mind once I have some more coffee.\" She passed the newspaper to Riley who hadn't recovered from Dorothy's admission. He looked over it and passed it to Jackson who also looked like he'd been drinking all night.</p><p>\"That's a mighty fine picture, Shaundra dear. When is the wedding?\"</p><p>\"Never,\" she said to Jackson. \"He's engaged to someone else.\"</p><p>\"Oh, yeah,\" Jackson replied. \"I think I met her last night. She was at the after-concert party with her parents.\"</p><p>\"Yes, that was her.\"</p><p>\"Did he introduce her to you?\" Dorothy asked.</p> <p>\"No. I stayed as far away from them as possible. I'm in enough idle gossip, not to mention I'm probably the most hated woman on the continent. I wouldn't be surprised if Aomori's fan club has a contract on my head.\"</p><p>\"Well, you did look extra cozy with Ichiro last night,\" Jackson replied.</p><p>Shaundra felt a blush heat up her face.</p><p>\"Don't think I didn't see the two of you leaving the party early.\" He winked at her.</p><p>Harper wasn't amused. \"Shaundra, really? He's a kid.\"</p><p>\"No, he isn't. He came back here and went to sleep. He was tired, and didn't any of you notice that he performed one hell of a concert last night? He wrote most of their songs including that beautiful Romanticism they performed at the end.\"</p><p>\"Did anyone notice that they didn't return to the stage?\" Riley asked.</p><p>\"Mr. Niigata probably thought the fans were going to storm the stage after seeing Shaundra getting busy with Yori on that billboard,\" Jackson replied.</p> <p>\"Why are you doing this to me, Jackson? What did I ever do to you?\"</p><p>\"Just funning with you, chica.\"</p><p>\"You're stepping on the wrong toes, Jackson. And besides, she's not sweet on either of them. I think she likes Satoshi,\" Harper replied.</p><p>\"My money's on Ichiro,\" Riley said. \"With that pretty face.\"</p><p>\"He's pretty sensitive about his looks,\" Shaundra warned. \"So lay off him.\"</p><p>\"Ooh, I'm into the sensitive types,\" Jackson replied. \"Maybe I should pay him a little visit.\"</p><p>\"He's not gay,\" Shaundra informed him.</p><p>\"How do you know?\" Jackson asked suspiciously.</p><p>\"Because women know these things. He's not gay.\"</p><p>The waitress finally brought their food, ending their conversation.</p><p>Yori and his soon-to-be in-laws walked into the restaurant and sat at a table not too far away. Shaundra looked over at Amaya. She was a really cute girl with long, black hair, a petite build and brown eyes.</p><p>Amaya raised her head and looked over at her. Then, she did the most childish thing. She rolled her eyes at her and tossed her hair before turning her head back around to face Yori.</p><p>\"I think you just made an enemy,\" Dorothy told her.</p><p>\"I'm not afraid of a little girl,\" Shaundra replied.</p><p>Dorothy laughed. \"Your ass is knee-deep in Kimchi. I hope you get home in one piece.\"</p><p>Shaundra attacked her breakfast with relish. She was halfway through her meal when her international cell phone rang. This was the first time it had done so since she'd arrived in Tokyo. She answered it quickly, fearing an emergency back home. \"Hello.\"</p><p>It was Donald. \"When are you coming home?\"</p><p>Was he crazy? International phone calls costed a fortune. \"In a couple of days. Why?\"</p><p>\"Why? Your face is posted all over the newspaper with some Asian guy.\"</p><p>\"Is that the only reason you are calling, Donald.\"</p><p>\"What do you mean by that? Who is this guy?\"</p><p>\"A singer. It's a publicity stunt. Why are you getting so upset?\" She rose, moved away from the table and walked out into the restaurant foyer to continue her conversation without further annoying the diners.</p><p>\"I don't like it.\"</p><p>She didn't expect he would. \"How did you get your hands on a Japanese newspaper? The story just broke this morning.\"</p><p>\"What are you talking about? I'm looking at the front page of our local newspaper.\"</p><p>Shaundra gulped.</p><p>\"Are you cheating on me?\" he asked.</p><p>\"No, I have no time for such foolishness.\"</p><p>\"Maybe not, but something is wrong. I've been sensing it for some time.\"</p><p>\"I don't understand what you're trying to say.\"</p><p>\"Maybe we need to separate for a while.\"</p><p>Shaundra took the phone away from her ear, not quite believing what she'd just heard, and then put it back to continue the conversation. \"You waited until I was across the world to say that?\"</p><p>\"I'm sorry,\" he said. \"I've been feeling this way for a while. I think the spark has gone out of our relationship.\"</p><p>\"Maybe so.\" She paused. \"Who is she?\"</p><p>\"Huh?\"</p><p>\"Who are you breaking up with me for?\"</p><p>Donald chuckled weakly. \"I never could pull anything over on you.</p><p>I've met someone else. You don't know her.\"</p><p>\"Look, I was having breakfast with my boss and the other authors I came here with. I better get back in before they get worried.\"</p><p>\"I'm sorry,\" Donald apologized.</p><p>\"Don't be,\" Shaundra replied. \"Have a nice life.\" She disconnected the call and walked back into the restaurant, still in shock.</p><p>\"Is anything wrong?\" Dorothy asked as Shaundra sat back down.</p><p>\"I just got dumped.\"</p><p>Everyone stopped eating.</p><p>\"What?\"</p><p>\"That was Donald. He saw the picture of me and Yori in a newspaper back home this morning. Then he told me he found someone else.\"</p><p>\"Is he telling you the truth about another woman or is his ego hurt because he saw the picture?\" Riley asked.</p><p>Shaundra shrugged her shoulders and poured herself another cup of coffee before answering Riley. \"No, he said something about we've been drifting apart.\"</p><p>\"Oh, you poor thing,\" Dorothy cooed. \"You must be devastated.\"</p><p>Shaundra sipped her coffee. \"Not really. I had plans to break it off with him when I got home. He just saved me the trouble.\"</p><p>\"So, what are you going to do now?\" Harper asked.</p><p>She could hear the hope in his voice.</p><p>Ichiro chose that moment to enter the restaurant.</p><p>\"Oh, I'll think of something.\"</p><p>Yori looked out of the curtain on the second night of the concert. The crowd was just as large as the previous night. \"Mr. Niigata is always right,\" he told the others who waited patiently for their turn to perform.</p><p>The only thing different was that they got to go home afterwards instead of attending a party. This, he was thankful for because he was meeting Amaya and her family for a late dinner.</p><p>\"Why are you so nervous?\" Satoshi asked, watching him suspiciously.</p><p>\"I've got plans later and I want to get this over with.\"</p><p>That piqued Satoshi's curiosity. \"Anything you want to share?\"</p><p>The other two members stopped doing what they were doing and waited for him to answer.</p><p>\"I'm having dinner with Amaya and her parents.\"</p><p>\"You poor thing,\" Takumijo teased with a grin. \"You're having dinner with a beautiful woman and her parents who think the world of you. You have our sympathy.\"</p><p>\"Bastard,\" Yori replied. \"You know they're going to get on my case about my posing with Ms. Morrison. That picture made all the world newspapers and the fan girls have been blowing up my website with comments about what a monster I am for doing this to them.\"</p><p>Ichiro snickered but did not comment.</p><p>\"It's not funny, Ich.\"</p><p>\"Yes, it is,\" he replied. His cell phone went off. He said hello and walked away.</p><p>\"One of these days, I am going to kick his ass,\" Yori threatened.</p><p>\"Why?\" Satoshi asked.</p><p>\"You know why. Ichiro has changed and not for the better.\"</p><p>\"You're just jealous because he's dating Ms. Morrison.\"</p><p>\"When did this happen?\" Takumijo asked. \"And why didn't you guys tell me?\"</p><p>Satoshi and Yori looked at him.</p><p>\"Where have you been?\" Satoshi asked.</p><p>\"Busy having a life,\" Takumijo replied. \"When did they start dating?\"</p><p>\"Yesterday,\" Satoshi answered. \"Didn't you see them together at the after-party? Oh, no, I forgot. They snuck out together before you arrived with Osamu.\" He paused. \"Speaking of which, didn't Mr. Niigata tell you to stay away from him?\"</p><p>Takumijo tossed his head, sending his hair flying around his eyes. He brushed it back with his hands. \"Mr. Niigata does not own me. I can be friends with anyone I choose.\"</p><p>Yori smirked. \"You talk shit. He doesn't own you until he has to get your ass out of trouble.\"</p><p>Takumijo rolled his eyes. \"This isn't about me. We were discussing Ichiro and his dating.\" He turned back to Satoshi. \"What do you mean he snuck out of here last night with her?\"</p><p>\"Just what I said.\"</p><p>Takumijo leaned against a wall. \"Do you think he scored?\"</p><p>Satoshi nodded his head and smiled. \"Yes.\"</p><p>\"No,\" Yori answered. \"He did not.\"</p><p>\"How do you know?\" Takumijo asked Yori. \"Did you follow him?\"</p><p>Yori turned his head sharply. \"Of course not. Why would I do something like that?\"</p><p>\"Because...\"Satoshi replied.</p><p>Yori glared at him, daring him to continue. \"You better go find Ich.</p><p>It's almost time for us to go on.\"</p><p>Satoshi rose and lumbered off, leaving him alone with Takumijo ,who had left his position on the wall and was busy primping in a full-length mirror. Satoshi returned a few minutes later with Ichiro in tow, fixing his clothes and wiping his lips.</p><p>\"Found him,\" Satoshi announced.</p><p>Yori glared at both of them and then went over to inspect Ichiro. He sniffed. It wasn't Ichiro's usual cologne that caught his attention, but Shaundra's.</p><p>\"Where were you?\"</p><p>\"Caught him sneaking back into the building,\" Satoshi announced.</p><p>\"You left this building and went somewhere unchaperoned?\" Yori asked angrily. Sometimes, being their leader worked his nerves. It had been okay when they were younger, but they were now full grown, headstrong men.</p><p>\"I wasn't alone,\" Ichiro announced.</p><p>\"Where is she?\" Yori asked.</p><p>\"Gone,\" Ichiro replied sheepishly. \"She came to wish me luck.\"</p><p>Yori used his thumb to wipe Shaundra's lipstick from Ichiro's lips.</p><p>\"Not your usual shade. Go fix yourself.\"</p><p>Ichiro damn near floated back to the dressing room to have someone repair is makeup.</p><p>\"Damn,\" Yori replied. \"It's true.\"</p><p>Satoshi gloated and nodded. \"See. He must have been real good in bed last night if she's sneaking out to meet him for a kiss.\"</p><p>Yori raised his hands in the air in defeat. There was no way he could prove to either of them that nothing had happened between Ichiro and Shaundra last night without revealing that he had snuck over there to check on them.</p><p>Ichiro came back in just as their intro music began and followed them out onto the stage, taking his place next to Yori like everything was fine between them. An hour and a half later, Yori rushed off the stage and into the dressing room to change and remove his makeup.</p><p>Ichiro came in the room behind him to do the same thing.</p><p>\"What are you in a hurry for?\" Yori asked him.</p><p>\"Date,\" Ichiro replied. He wiped the makeup off like a pro, washed his face and then changed into some street clothes. He dashed out of the door, leaving Yori dumbfounded and pissed, and he hated feeling that way.</p><p>Satoshi was right. It was all his fault.</p><p>But he didn't have time to dwell on his misfortune. Yori left out of the back stage door and walked down an alley until he reached a walkway that led to the Dome Mall. Traffic from the concert still streamed from every direction, which he avoided, trying to make it back to the hotel without being noticed by the fans as they made their way home.</p><p>Yori jumped over a low hedge and then hurried up the walkway that led to the lit front of the Dome Hotel. He used his key card to let himself in and then hurried to the elevator and boarded it. Moments later, he exited on his floor, hoping not to run into Ichiro or Shaundra as he quietly turned the corner to his room.</p><p>Once inside, he took a quick shower, dressed and then telephoned the Saitamas. He had a decision to make tonight before they left in the morning. Did he want for things to remain the way they were or did he want to take a chance on something new? Hopefully, the answer would come to him tonight over dinner.</p><p>He closed his door and then went back downstairs to the lobby to wait for the Saitamas to arrive. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\"How was the concert?\" Shaundra asked Ichiro as she rode in a car next to him unaccompanied by guards. Ichiro was looking kawaii in a dark brown suit, creme-colored dress shirt and dark brown tie.</p><p>\"A huge success,\" he replied as he maneuvered his way through traffic. He was a really good driver and the little black sports car had a lot of horsepower. She smiled. Ichiro was a man of many surprises. \"Another sold out concert. Mr. Niigata should be proud.\"</p><p>She rode in silence for a moment, but curiosity got the best of her.</p><p>\"Are you supposed to be out here driving unchaperoned?\"</p> <p>\"No,\" he answered. \"Mr. Niigata would have a fit if he knew.\"</p><p>\"But you're out here anyway and rented a sensational sports car, as well. I don't know why I thought you guys couldn't drive. Must be the fact that Kenshin is always chauffeuring you around.\"</p><p>\"Yes, we all know how to drive. As for the other answer, I was in the mood to take a chance. Sometimes it's good to do things out of the norm.</p><p>Besides, I am a grown man. Having a contract does not make a person a slave.\"</p><p>How well she knew that. \"I'm not complaining. I think it's nice.\" She settled back against the soft leather seat while he put a CD into the player.</p> <p>His music choice surprised her. It was Lionel Ritchie. \"Ooh, I like Lionel Ritchie.\"</p><p>\"I know,\" Ichiro replied as he left the bridge they were crossing and drove onto an open highway. \"I've read your biography on Facebook and MySpace. You also like Barry White, Elton John and the Beatles.\"</p><p>\"You pronounce their names so precise. How long have you been studying English?\"</p><p>\"Fifteen years. Satoshi began teaching us when the group formed and then we had formal lessons. Mr. Niigata has been preparing us for years for our United States debut.\"</p><p>\"How many other languages can you speak?\"</p><p>\"Too many,\" he replied with a smile. \"Sometimes I get mixed up.</p> <p>We've traveled so many places. But I like English and I can't wait to visit the United States. We'll be there for several months and then we'll return back to Osaka.\"</p><p>\"I wished I had time to see Osaka. I've heard some really nice things about it.\"</p><p>\"We can sneak back there before the tour or you can extend your stay and travel back with us when we return.\"</p><p>\"Tempting, but I need to check on my home and family.\"</p><p>\"Maybe on your next visit then.\"</p><p>Shaundra laughed. \"I had to be drugged and put on a plane to come here. I don't really know if I want to go through that again.\"</p><p>Ichiro chuckled as he drove. \"I heard the story from Masaaki. I got a big laugh out of it.\"</p><p>\"Yes, it did make an amusing tale.\"</p> <p>\"Why are you afraid to fly?\"</p><p>\"I don't think I have a fear of flying. I think it is more like a fear of dying.\"</p><p>\"Everyone has to die.\"</p><p>\"I know but I plan to go in my sleep. Falling thirty thousand feet is not an appealing way to meet my maker.\"</p><p>He turned the car into a parking lot of a restaurant. The building was large and had a black, sloping, slate Japanese-styled roof, common to most buildings she'd seen. There were several cars, but not overly crowded.</p><p>Ichiro turned off the engine, got out, walked around to her side of the car and helped her out.</p><p>\"What is this place?\"</p><p>\"It's called Daisuke's. It belongs to a friend of mine.\"</p><p>They walked up the stairs and Ichiro held the door open for her to enter. It was like stepping back into history. The restaurant resembled an ancient Japanese eatery with rustic posts and windows. The dark walls had weapons and armor and old war costumes. Japanese lanterns hung from the ceiling that gave it a warm and semi-dark atmosphere. The waiters and waitresses wore kimonos. The men's were black and the women wore bright red. The diners sat on the floor on pillows with short little tables before them. A waitress appeared and joked with Ichiro in Japanese as she led them through the restaurant. Women gasped as they recognized him.</p><p>They bowed respectfully and one or two of them smiled brazenly even though Shaundra accompanied him. She was hit by a tinge of jealousy she didn't expect, but quickly dispelled it. Other women ogling him was something she had to get used to if she planned to be in his company.</p><p>A man dressed in a white chef's outfit appeared out of the kitchen door. He grabbed Ichiro and hugged him, which looked a bit odd because the man was shorter than Ichiro. They spoke to each other in Japanese.</p><p>More and more, she regretted barely picking up the book Harper had given her to study.</p><p>Ichiro pulled her forward. \"Sensei, this is my friend, Shaundra Morrison. She is a writer from America who has come to Tokyo to help Mr. Niigata open his new publishing company.\" The man bowed before her. \"Always nice to meet a friend of Ichiro,\"</p><p>the man said in English.</p><p>Sensei, that means teacher. Shaundra bowed back.</p><p>\"This is Mr. Daisuke, my cooking mentor.\"</p><p>Shaundra bowed again. \"Pleased to meet you. I don't speak Japanese.\"</p><p>Mr. Daisuke laughed. \"Leave it to Ichiro to fall in love with the only woman in Tokyo who does not speak Japanese.\"</p><p>\"Ichiro's not in love with me,\" Shaundra replied.</p><p>\"Oh, no. You're the first woman he's ever brought to my restaurant.\"</p><p>\"That doesn't mean...\"</p><p>Ichiro stopped her. \"Ms. Morrison and I are friends.\"</p><p>Mr. Daisuke laughed again. \"Yes, if you say so.\" Behind him, the kitchen cooks were busy preparing meals in huge woks and roasting meat on large spits.</p><p>\"Something smells delicious,\" Shaundra said, trying to change the subject.</p><p>\"The cooks have been working hard all day since they found out that Ichiro was coming. I always tell them that he was my finest student before he got into singing. They prepare good meals to impress him.\" The master chef turned to the waitress that had returned. \"Put Mr. Yoshida in a private dining room. He is on a date and he needs privacy.\"</p><p>Shaundra smiled.</p><p>The waitress smiled back and nodded excitedly. \"This way, please.\"</p><p>Shaundra followed the young woman down the hall to another room.</p><p>This one was smaller and out of the way of any disturbance. There were pillows on the floor that caused her some concern. Tan Japanese lanterns hung from the ceiling to give it a romantic atmosphere. Ichiro said something to her and the young woman bowed and left.</p><p>\"This is nice,\" Shaundra said. Ichiro helped her down onto the pillows.</p><p>The skirt she wore rose up on her hips and she had to shift her weight to pull the hem down her thighs. The act did not go unnoticed by Ichiro.</p><p>\"You have very beautiful legs.\"</p><p>\"Thanks.\" It would have been easier to put them under the table if it had legs, which it didn't, so she had the choice of either kneeling or sitting sideways to keep from flashing Ichiro. She opted for the side sitting.</p><p>Ichiro sat cross-legged on the other side of the table.</p><p>The waitress returned carrying a tray with a decanter and two small cups. She poured some of the liquid into the cups, and then placed the decanter in front of Ichiro. She left the room again.</p><p>\"What is this?\"</p><p>\"Sake,\" Ichiro answered, picking up the tiny cup and sipping. \"It is a very smooth drink.\"</p><p>Shaundra picked up the cup and sampled. It was warm and possibly the worst thing she'd ever tasted.</p><p>Ichiro laughed. \"It is an acquired taste.\" He polished off his drink and then reclined on the pillows to watch her.</p><p>God, he truly looked scrumptious, she thought. She unloosened his hair with her mind, imagining it sprawled out on her pillow. She sipped the sake again and made a face.</p><p>Ichiro chuckled. \"It's not supposed to be served when you're having rice, but Mr. Daisuke knows that I like it.\"</p><p>\"Why not?\"</p><p>\"Because it is considered equal to a rice dish, so usually, you don't have the two at the same time.\"</p><p>\"I will remember that.\"</p><p>He continued to watch her. \"What are you thinking?\"</p><p>\"About how your hair would look spread out on my pillow.\"</p><p>Ichiro raised an eyebrow. \"I did not expect you to say that.\"</p><p>\"Did I surprise you?\"</p><p>\"Very much so. \" Her entire body sizzled as she peered down into his fathomless blue peepers. \"You have exquisite eyes.\"</p><p>The waitress returned before he could reply, but he could not hide the smile. He sat up. The waitress placed a bowl of rice to her and Ichiro's left and a bowl of Miso soup at their right. Behind the rice and soup, she placed three flat plates of meat, and then a bowl each of pickled vegetables to the side.</p><p>The chopsticks were placed at the very front of her tray with the pointed ends facing left on the chopstick rest. The waitress left for a moment and then returned with hot towels for them to cleanse their hands.</p><p>She left again, this time for good.</p><p>\"Itadakimasu,\" Ichiro said. \"I humbly receive.\"</p><p>\"Itadakimasu,\" Shaundra repeated.</p><p>Ichiro smiled at her again, making her feel the flush all the way down to her toes.</p><p>\"You learn fast.\"</p><p>\"That's because you said it so gracefully that I was able to understand.\"</p><p>He picked up his bowl of rice with his left hand and the chopsticks with his right. Ichiro lifted the bowl to his perfect mouth but he did not touch the bowl with it. He began eating the rice.</p><p>Shaundra's stomach clenched as eating took on a different meaning to her brain. She picked up the bowl and began to eat her rice.</p><p>Ichiro put down the bowl and picked up his soup, wrapping his lips around the rim.</p><p>Shaundra watched with interest as he swallowed. His Adam's apple bobbled. Hmm, definitely a man. If there was any doubt, this was a dead giveaway. She lowered her empty rice bowl and stared down at the Miso soup. It contained tofu, wakame and scallions. She drank the soup, but didn't remember what it tasted like because she was so distracted by Ichiro's presence.</p><p>Ichiro reached over, grabbed the chopsticks, picked up a piece of meat and fed it to her before eating a piece himself.</p><p>She'd been in Tokyo long enough to know that sharing food this way was a type of intimacy. \"Thank you.\"</p><p>\"You are welcome, Shaundra.\"</p><p>Ooh, she liked the way her name sounded coming out of his mouth.</p><p>\"That was so delicious.\"</p><p>He smirked. \"You are easily pleased.\" Before the meal was over, he had fed her Yakimon, Namasu, and Aemon, describing them as grilled fish, raw fish in vinegar sauce and vegetables. She had to take his word for it because she didn't remember tasting any of it. He polished off the sake and Shaundra made a face.</p><p>\"You're not much of a drinker, are you?\"</p><p>\"Not really. I've tried Shochu once.\"</p><p>He stopped drinking and curiously eyed her. \"You've tasted Shochu?\"</p><p>Shaundra nodded. \"Only once. It made me do bad things.\"</p><p>He raised that eyebrow again. \"I won't ask you to elaborate.\"</p><p>And she didn't want to. Yori, that bastard, had intentionally ordered it to see what it would do to her. \"Thank you.\" Fortunately, he did not try to get her to drink any more sake. She was tipsy enough as it was. It tasted awful and it had a powerful kickback.</p><p>Ichiro reclined back on his elbow. \"Tell me something about your family.\"</p><p>Shaundra relaxed. \"What do you want to know?\"</p><p>\"Tell me about your kids.\"</p><p>\"They're fairly good children, not too much trouble, but they do have their share of issues. My eldest daughter, Juanda, has a set of twin boys.\"</p><p>Ichiro's eyes widened. \"You're a grandmother?\"</p><p>\"Yes, is there a problem with that?\"</p><p>\"No, I love kids.\"</p><p>Shaundra sighed. She'd figured he might. \"Anyway, she thinks it's my job to take care of them on the weekends or any time she feels like dropping them off. I love my grandkids, but I need my free time to write.\"</p><p>\"And your youngest daughter?\"</p><p>\"My baby is similar to me. She worries about me and she wants me to have a life.\"</p><p>\"I think I like her already.\"</p><p>\"The boys are very protective. They have they own lives, but call every day to make sure I'm alive.\"</p><p>\"So what did they think when you told them you were coming to Tokyo?\"</p><p>Shaundra frowned. \"No one complained except Juanda and Donald.\"</p><p>\"Is Donald one of your sons?\"</p><p>She shook her head. \"No, my ex-boyfriend.\"</p><p>Ichiro perked up. \"Ex? You man the one we discussed the other day?\"</p><p>Shaundra pouted. \"Yes, he broke up with me this morning after he saw the picture of Yori and me in the newspaper. He accused me of having an affair with him.\"</p><p>\"Are you?\"</p><p>Shaundra shook her head. \"No.\"</p><p>Ichiro's smiled broadened at her admission. \"You wanted to end it with him anyway, so why care how it happened? Just be thankful that it happened and you didn't have to hurt his feelings.\"</p><p>\"I guess you're right. He found someone else.\"</p><p>\"He's a fast mover.\"</p><p>\"Not really. He's probably had his eye on her for a while. She's probably a younger, more attractive woman.\" She didn't feel like talking about Donald anymore. Not with Ichiro staring at her.</p><p>\"Younger like me?\"</p><p>Her panties dampened again. Shaundra blushed. \"Hell yeah.\"</p><p>Ichiro rose. \"Let's get out of here. I have other places to show you.\"</p><p>He helped her up to her feet and he got an eyeful of thigh again. He took out his wallet, extracted some money and put it into a leather billfold, then left it on the table for the waitress.</p><p>Shaundra swayed a little.</p><p>\"No more sake for you,\" he teased.</p><p>\"I'm not drunk.\" She followed him back past the kitchen where he said good-bye to Mr. Daisuke and thanked the other chefs for an excellent meal.</p><p>\"You bring her around here again,\" Mr. Daisuke replied. \"I like her and she brings out the best in you.\"</p><p>\"Will do,\" Ichiro answered.</p><p>\"How is your place coming?\"</p><p>\"I was just about to take Shaundra to see it.\"</p><p>\"Did I spoil the surprise?\"</p><p>\"No,\" Ichiro replied as he waved good-bye and led her through the restaurant and out the door. He helped her into the car.</p><p>The night air kept her awake after the food and the sake. \"What is this place the two of you were discussing?\"</p><p>\"My dream,\" Ichiro answered. He closed her door, then walked around, got into the car and started it. \"I've always dreamed of owning my own restaurant. Mr. Daisuke helped me find the perfect commercial location and it's just about finished.\" He drove for about a half hour telling her about his plans for the future. She could listen to his sweet voice forever, wondering why he chose only to use it for her and Mr. Daisuke.</p><p>Ichiro parked the car again. This time, they were in a bigger lot in a commercial part of town. This was perfect for this type of business. He helped her out once more and she took in the view of the new building designed with black, sloping Japanese roofs, and red brick outer walls.</p><p>Construction vehicles and machinery rested in the parking lot, but all the workers had gone home for the day. He escorted her up the stairs and then opened the door.</p><p>\"Wow,\" Shaundra exclaimed as they stepped inside. It didn't have any furniture yet, but the walls were painted, the baseboards and crown molding was in place, and it felt homey.</p><p>\"I really would like you to see it when it's finished.\" He described everything in detail as he took her around the place. There were even a couple of private rooms in back like at Mr. Daisuke's restaurant.</p><p>\"Do you plan to be the chef?\"</p><p>\"Not in the beginning,\" he said with a sigh. \"I will be busy with Aomori for a while. But I do intend to use my family's recipes and some that I have created. I have hired a manager to look after the place until I return from military duty and retire from the band. After that, I plan to devote myself to this business full time.\"</p><p>Military service. She had forgotten about that. He had to serve two years before he was thirty, which would probably extend his contract with Mr. Niigata for two extra years.</p><p>\"When is it expected to be completed?\"</p><p>\"In December. Hopefully it will open by Christmas.\"</p><p>\"But you won't be back off tour by then.\"</p><p>He sighed again. \"Yes, I know.\" He escorted her back through the restaurant and out the door. \"I'll get to enjoy it one day.\" He helped her back into the car. \"I have one more event planned for this evening,\" he announced as they headed back toward the freeway. \"Dancing.\"</p><p>Shaundra blushed, remembering Ichiro's erotic movements on stage last night. \"Are we going back to the club in Shibuya?\"</p><p>\"No, the lounge at the hotel. I don't want to give Mr. Niigata a heart attack once he discovers that I don't have the guards. There is a live band performing tonight and I'm in the mood to party.\"</p><p>So much for his freedom, she thought as they entered the city limits once again.</p><p>Ichiro parked the rental car a safe distance away from the other cars and they got out and went back inside the hotel to the lounge. A waitress escorted them to a booth. The place was crowded and the band played a mixture of songs. Ichiro turned to the waitress. \"I want to dance with the lovely lady first and then we will order drinks.\" Shaundra sat down, but Ichiro remained standing. He left her at the table for a moment, walked over to the band and spoke to the lead singer before returning to her.</p><p>\"A man's request,\" the lead singer announced to the audience.</p><p>The next thing she knew, Ichiro was leading her on the floor to the opening chords of Love Serenade by Barry White.</p><p>Shaundra gulped. This is serious love enhancement music. Before she could react, she was in Ichiro's arms, pressed against his chest and swaying slowly to the music.</p><p>Satoshi and Takumijo slid into a booth in the hotel lounge wearing dark clothes and dark shades to disguise themselves. Satoshi nudged Takumijo and pointed toward the dance floor at Ichiro and Shaundra Morrison.</p><p>Takumijo stared. \"Is that Ichiro dancing slowly with a Shaundra Morrison?\"</p><p>Satoshi nodded. \"I'm shocked too. Ichiro never dances at any other time except for practice and on the stage.\" The waitress arrived at their table again. \"Two beers.\" She left again. The music changed several times during the next couple of minutes, but Ichiro and Shaundra did not stop dancing.</p><p>\"This is serious,\" Takumijo stated. \"It's like the two of them are in a world all their own.\"</p><p>\"Maybe they are,\" Satoshi replied, a little upset inside to think straight.</p><p>Why hadn't he made a move when he had the chance to? \"I don't care what Yori says. I think the two of them have slept together already.\"</p><p>Satoshi watched the dancers' movements below the waist. Their pelvic areas touched. \"If they haven't made love yet, I suspect that it will happen before the night ends. There is just so much a man can take.\"</p><p>\"There's something I haven't figured out yet,\" Takumijo replied.</p><p>\"Why is she with Ichiro now when in the beginning she seemed to like Yori?\"</p><p>\"Yori is engaged to Amaya,\" Satoshi explained.</p><p>\"So?\"</p><p>\"So, you know Yori. He wants to do the honorable thing, so he's told Shaundra about his engagement, which is like giving Shaundra his permission to forget about him and to date Ichiro. I think Shaundra cares for both Ichiro and Yori, but in different ways.\"</p><p>\"Still confused.\" The waitress returned with their beers and left.</p><p>\"Yori is in love with Shaundra Morrison, but he can't have a relationship with her because he is engaged to Amaya. He has a decision to make, but he doesn't know what to do. So, while he's confused and terrified, Ichiro has fallen for her too. Since Ichiro doesn't think Yori will break up with Amaya, he's not wasting time moving in.\"</p><p>The beat of the music changed.</p><p>\"Shit, look at that,\" Satoshi said, pointing to the dance floor.</p><p>Takumijo put down his beer and put his eyes back on the dancers.</p><p>Shaundra's butt was bobbing up and down to the music and Ichiro was behind her rocking to the beat. \"I saw them do that on American television. It's a very popular dance in the United States.\" He laughed.</p><p>\"Where did Ichiro learn that dance? Masaaki would die if he walked in and saw him.\"</p><p>Takumijo turned toward the door. \"Oh, oh.\"</p><p>Satoshi turned toward the door. Yori and Amaya had just entered and Yori looked fit to be tied. He stalked toward the dance floor. \"Stop him,\"</p><p>Satoshi ordered.</p><p>Takumijo jumped from the booth, knocking aside dancers to get to Yori. Satoshi was close on his heels, drawing a lot of attention. Takumijo reached Yori just as the song ended and pulled him away from Shaundra and Ichiro. \"What do you think you're doing?\"</p><p>Yori tried to get away from Takumijo, but couldn't. \"I'm going to kick Ichiro's ass. He's nearly humping her on the dance floor.\"</p><p>\"It's a dance, you idiot,\" Takumijo told him. \"You're going to embarrass both of them and yourself.\"</p><p>The look on Yori's face said it all, Satoshi noted. He was in love with Shaundra and he didn't care if he punched the hell out of Ichiro or embarrassed himself in front of his future bride.</p><p>\"What is the matter with you?\" Amaya asked as she walked over to them. \"Why are you picking a fight with Ichiro?\"</p><p>Ichiro glared at Yori as he walked Shaundra past them.</p><p>\"We'll settle this later,\" Yori told him.</p><p>\"Nothing to settle,\" Ichiro replied. \"You've lost.\"</p><p>Amaya grabbed Yori's arm. \"What's the matter with the two of you?\"</p><p>Yori shook her off. \"Nothing. I am the leader and Ichiro is out and out disobeying an order. Come on, let's find a table.\"</p><p>Satoshi and Takumijo went back to their table, which was situated in an area where they could watch both couples.</p><p>\"This is going to turn out so bad,\" Satoshi replied.</p><p>Takumijo ordered them another round of drinks, which the waitress brought quickly.</p><p>\"Yori is an idiot,\" Satoshi replied. \"And Amaya is an ever bigger idiot if she does not see what is happening before her eyes.\"</p><p>\"Are you going to tell me what happened or do I have to go over and ask Ichiro?\" Amaya asked. She attempted to rise, but Yori caught her hand and pulled her back down in the seat.</p><p>\"Don't. It's really doesn't concern you.\"</p><p>\"Like hell it doesn't. You and your best friend were about to fight on the dance floor. Why?\"</p><p>\"Because he was being disrespectful.\"</p><p>\"I don't understand. All I saw was Ichiro having a good time with his girlfriend.\"</p><p>\"It was the type of dancing that they were doing. It wasn't appropriate.\"</p><p>Amaya laughed. \"You mean popping? It's the most popular dance in America.\"</p><p>Yori frowned. \"We are not in America.\"</p><p>\"We also don't have big butts. Ichiro's woman does and Ichiro was enjoying it.\"</p><p>\"Well, he shouldn't be.\"</p><p>Amaya sighed. \"Tell me the truth. Are you upset that Ichiro is having a good time with his girlfriend, or are you upset that Ichiro is having fun with Shaundra Morrison?\"</p><p>\"What's the difference?\"</p><p>\"The difference is, either you're jealous of Ichiro, or you're in love with Shaundra Morrison.\"</p><p>\"Neither.\"</p><p>\"I've known you for a long time, Yori, and I can usually tell when you're lying to me. I'm not blind. I see the way you look at her.\"</p><p>\"I don't look at her in any particular way,\" Yori replied.</p><p>Amaya sighed. This is not going well. \"My folks enjoyed your concert.</p><p>They said you have a very nice voice.\"</p><p>\"Thanks. I'm glad they had a good time.\"</p><p>Changing the subject didn't make his mood any better, she noted.</p><p>\"Would you care to dance?\"</p><p>He seemed to think about it for a moment. \"Yes, I think I still have a little energy left.\"</p><p>They rose and walked over to the dance floor. She wrapped her arms around his waist and he put his arms around her neck and they began to sway to the music. It had been a long time since they'd danced together this way, partially because of their conflicting careers.</p><p>His took him away from Osaka for months at a time while she had her college classes and part-time job with her parents. She kept thinking things between them would return to how it used to be once she graduated, but now she had her doubts. Yori had changed considerably since joining Aomori and, at first, his overly protective attitude toward his band members had been cute. Everything he did was for them and it made them a strong unit and the best band in Asia, but it also put a rift in their relationship. His phone calls were now few and far apart, and her best friend, Kikio, didn't make matters any better by constantly telling her that Yori was cheating on her. Up until now, she'd never thought he could. But she wasn't a fool or naive. There was something going on between him and Shaundra Morrison even if he didn't want to admit it. And poor Ichiro was stuck in the middle.</p><p>The song ended, but it was quickly followed by another so they continued to dance. Amaya could tell that his heart wasn't in it. Should she be the bigger person and just end it and put him out of his misery? Or hang on with the hopes that this little fascination would blow over? They returned to the table this time when the music ended.</p><p>Amaya looked over at the other two tables. Satoshi and Takumijo were still nursing drinks, but Ichiro and Shaundra were no longer in the lounge.</p><p>\"Yori's little stupid act of jealousy put a crimp in my plans,\" Ichiro told Shaundra as they stood outside her hotel room door.</p><p>\"Oh, what plans did he spoil?\"</p><p>Ichiro smiled wickedly. His blue eyes flashed lustfully as he looked down on her. \"You know, the hair and pillow thing.\"</p><p>Shaundra smirked. \"Maybe some other time.\" Damn, so close.</p><p>\"Yes, I hate to admit it, but I'm pretty tired and may not give a stellar performance.\"</p><p>\"Perfectly understandable. Because if and when we do the hair and pillow thing, I want you at your full potential.\" She grabbed his tie and pulled him toward her. Ichiro stood over her as she raised her face for a kiss. He lowered his head, capturing her lips possessively. The scent of his cologne and the heat from his body rendered her silly. She removed her hand from his tie and encircled his waist with her arms. The sound of approaching footsteps did not force them to break the embrace. If she could not have his body, she would not be denied his heart.</p><p>Ichiro broke the kiss that left her breathless. \"I'm going to sleep like a baby after that.\" He pulled away from her, waved good-bye and left her standing flustered in the hall.</p><p>Shaundra used her keycard and entered her room, happy about the end of the evening, yet very pissed off at Yori and Donald for messing with her karma.</p><p>A fist to the face was the last thing Ichiro expected when he stepped into his room. He should have expected it since he and Yori did have adjoining rooms. Ichiro retaliated by punching Yori in the gut - his weak spot - and sending him to his knees.</p><p>Satoshi and Takumijo appeared from out of nowhere after the two of them continued to fight.</p><p>\"What is the matter with the two of you?\" Takumijo asked as he grabbed Yori.</p><p>Satoshi, in turn, grabbed Ichiro.</p><p>Yori clutched his aching stomach. \"Did you guys know that Ichiro left here unchaperoned this evening?\"</p><p>\"So what?' Takumijo said, releasing him. \"We sneak away too when we get the chance.\" He flopped down in a chair.</p><p>\"This is different. We just performed a concert and this town is swarming with fans. He could have gotten seriously hurt.\"</p><p>\"I can take care of myself,\" Ichiro replied. \"I am no longer a child.\"</p><p>Yori continued to rub his stomach. \"I know you're not, but we're not only talking about your safety. You took Shaundra with you. Do you have any idea how many fans want to do her harm since that magazine cover appeared?\"</p><p>\"Yes, I am well aware of it. That is why I only took her to private places. I can protect her.\"</p><p>\"You shouldn't have to. That is why we have bodyguards. You may be a big boy now, but you still need to follow the rules.\"</p><p>\"And you need to stay out of my business,\" Ichiro replied. \"You chose Amaya. What I want to do or where I take my date is my business.\"</p><p>\"Like dry humping her on the dance floor tonight?\" Yori asked.</p><p>\"It was a dance, and thanks to your foolishness, I will be sleeping alone tonight.\"</p><p>Yori lunged at him again, but Takumijo sprang back to his feet and grabbed him. \"Your better stay away from her, you little fairy.\"</p><p>Ichiro punched him in the gut again. \"You look more like a girl than I do. And for future reference, I am not gay.\"</p><p>Yori broke away from Takumijo and swung his fist at Ichiro again, but missed. Ichiro slapped him across the face.</p><p>Yori stood there looking speechless.</p><p>\"Now get the hell out of my room so I can change and go to sleep. It's been a long day.\"</p><p>\"Ooh, he's so hot,\" Satoshi teased. \"Maybe we underestimated his silence.\"</p><p>Ichiro rolled his eyes at Satoshi. \"I don't have time for your jokes or sarcasm either, Satoshi. You guys do not understand how you make me feel when you treat me like a kid, or a girl, or anything else other than a man. Shaundra is the first person who has come into my life who treats me as an equal and with respect. I would never do anything to harm her or treat her like a whore. She is a very beautiful person both inside and out, and I am honored that she finds me attractive and wants to spend time with me.\"</p><p>Yori walked away, nursing his chin. \"Kissing her in the hallway in full view of everyone is not showing respect.\"</p><p>\"She kissed me. What was I supposed to do?\"</p><p>The reaction on Yori's face was enough to make up for the attack on his person. Ichiro walked over to the dresser and checked his face for bruising. That bastard had smacked him good.</p><p>\"You're jealous,\" Satoshi told Yori. \"At least he stayed outside her room like a gentleman.\"</p><p>Ichiro moved away from the mirror and walked over to Yori. \"You've been inside her room?\"</p><p>\"That is none of your business.\"</p><p>\"It is my business. I won't take sloppy seconds to you.\"</p><p>Satoshi laughed and Yori glared at him. \"Stop teaching him those disgusting terms.\" He turned back to Ichiro. \"If I would have gotten that far, there'd be no way you'd have a chance with her.\"</p><p>Someone cleared their throat behind them. He turned toward the door.</p><p>It was Masaaki. \"I can hear you idiots all the way down the hall.\" He closed the door and entered the room \"What are you fighting for this time?\"</p><p>\"Ichiro won't follow the rules,\" Yori replied. \"He snuck off tonight on a date with Ms. Morrison and he did not take security with him.\"</p><p>Masaaki glared at Ichiro, who didn't back down or apologize. \"Why did you do something so foolish?\"</p><p>\"Because I was on a date. Do you take security with you on a date?\"</p><p>\"I am not a member of Aomori. I don't need protection,\" Masaaki replied. \"Do not ever do something like that again.\"</p><p>Yori chuckled triumphantly.</p><p>Masaaki turned on him. \"I don't know why you're laughing. Don't think I don't know about your little antics either. Your reputation with your fans is at an all time low. True, it wasn't your fault that that magazine book cover depicted the two of you as lovers, but instead of staying away from Shaundra Morrison until this blows over, you have insisted on making a spectacle of yourself whenever you are around her. Even in front of your future bride and your in-laws.\"</p><p>Yori lowered his head in shame. \"That's not entirely true.\"</p><p>Masaaki walked over to Ichiro and examined him. \"What happened to your face?\"</p><p>\"Yori took his frustrations out on me.\"</p><p>Yori did not raise his head, embarrassed for the way Masaaki now saw him.</p><p>\"This is unacceptable. You are the leader. You should know better.</p><p>What is this all about?\"</p><p>\"Ms. Morrison,\" Ichiro replied. \"He can't stand the fact that she prefers my company to his.\"</p><p>\"She does not,\" Yori mumbled. \"It's just that...\"</p><p>\"Yes, we all know. You're engaged to Amaya Saitama. That is no excuse for hitting Ichiro. You need to get your relationships under control.</p><p>Now, I want you to apologize to Ichiro and both of you better find a way to get along before I ban you to your rooms for the remainder of our stay in Tokyo.\" With that, he stalked out of the room, leaving the four to them to just stare at the door.</p><p>\"Please leave my room,\" Ichiro asked his friends again.</p><p>Yori rose first and the other two followed. He securely locked the door separating the two adjoining rooms and began stripping out of his suit and tie. Both Takumijo and Masaaki were right. Something had to be done to fix this rift and it was up to him to do it. Shaundra would be in town for just two more weeks and then she'd been gone. If he wanted her, he had to do something and do it quick. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\"What do you mean you want to extend this trip by another two weeks?\" Shaundra asked Harper as they gathered in the conference room at the Dome Hotel. \"What the hell for?\"</p><p>\"Money and promotion.\"</p><p>\"But KiNii opens its doors tomorrow. I thought that's what the party after it is supposed to be for.\"</p><p>The other three authors agreed.</p> <p>\"What's left for us to do here?\" Jackson asked. \"I've got other priorities and deadlines to meet.\"</p><p>\"I have to agree with him,\" Dorothy replied. \"The faster we're out of here, the safer Shaundra is going to be.\"</p><p>Shaundra nodded her head quickly. There was nothing like a couple of death threats on her networking pages to make her want to leave Tokyo on the first thing flying out of there. She hoped her life meant more to him than money.</p><p>\"They're just kids,\" Harper replied. \"You don't seriously believe that they will try to harm you?\"</p><p>Well, maybe not. She nodded. \"Yes, I do, and when was the last time someone called you a bitch? That's the new nickname they've given me.</p> <p>Those fan girls are probably burning straw replicas of me right now that Flowing Magazine's latest issue has hit newsstands. I had to close my Facebook and MySpace accounts, and you know how I love to network with my fans. Those little girls are getting quite vicious.\"</p><p>\"I'll hire a bodyguard for you.\"</p><p>\"Thanks, but you're missing the point. I am ready to go home. I've had enough drama for this lifetime.\"</p><p>\"Ah, come on,\" Harper pleaded, smiling enticingly at her. \"You're going to love Osaka.\"</p><p>Shaundra did a double-take. \"Osaka?\" \"Yes, didn't I tell you? We're moving on to Osaka in two days. I want to do a story on Aomori for one of my entertainment magazines.\"</p><p>Shaundra sat down at the table. The least she could do was hear what he had to say. \"Why can't you do a story on them right here in Tokyo?\"</p> <p>\"Let me rephrase this. I want you to do a story on them.\"</p><p>\"What? Why? I am not a journalist.\"</p><p>\"You used to be, and they seem to like you. Who better to get a story out of the pretty boys than someone they admire?\"</p><p>\"Not lately,\" she muttered.</p><p>\"What do you mean by that?\" Harper asked.</p><p>\"They've been avoiding me like the plague, even Ichiro.\"</p><p>\"What have you done?\" Dorothy asked. \"That young man idolizes you.\"</p><p>\"Nothing. Hey, I thought you were on my side.\"</p> <p>\"I am, dear, but these old ears have heard a lot of stuff.\"</p><p>\"Does John talk in his sleep?\"</p><p>\"Yes, he does. Those two pretty boys got into a fight over you on the last night of their concert.\"</p><p>\"They did not have a fight. They were about to, but Satoshi and Takumijo stopped them. It just got very loud in the lounge.\"</p><p>Dorothy shook her head. \"No, afterwards. Yori and Ichiro came to blows in Ichiro's room. Rumor has it that he has a black eye.\"</p><p>Shaundra gasped. \"No.\" She turned to Harper. \"See what you've done.\"</p><p>\"What did I do?\"</p><p>\"You made me come here. I was perfectly content being in the United States writing, but no, you talked my ass on that plane and now I'm on a fan club's most wanted list. Now it seems that I've also broken up Asia's hottest boy band. So, if you want that story, you have to write it yourself.</p><p>I'm going home.\" She hopped out of her chair and left the conference room, angry at both herself and Harper. She wanted to put as much distance between them as possible. She just kept walking, and mumbling about what a big prick Harper was.</p><p>\"Whoa, who is a big prick?\" a familiar voice said.</p><p>Shaundra looked up. It was Satoshi.</p><p>\"Sorry, I didn't see you.\"</p><p>\"Obviously. Why are you in such a hurry?\"</p><p>\"I'm trying to get away from my asshole of a boss.\"</p><p>\"He wants you to do a story on us in Osaka.\"</p><p>\"How do you know this?\" He walked with her to the lobby, looking quite attractive for such an ungodly hour, dressed in white linen pants and a white linen jacket opened at the chest. Beneath it he wore a black T- shirt.</p><p>\"Masaaki has already spoken to us about this earlier while we were at the gym.\"</p><p>\"Good, then we're all in agreement that this is not going to happen.\"</p><p>\"On the contrary, all of us have agreed. We were just waiting for your reply.\"</p><p>Shaundra stopped walking. \"You can't be serious?\"</p><p>Satoshi nodded. \"But I am. Even Yori and Ichiro have agreed.\"</p><p>\"Speaking of which, is it true that the two of them had a fight after we left the lounge the other night?\"</p><p>Satoshi hesitated. \"It has all been taken care of.\"</p><p>\"That's not what I asked.\" Why did men continue to treat her like she needed to be protected? He sighed. \"Will you join me for breakfast?\"</p><p>Shaundra looked around. For some reason, they were standing outside the hotel restaurant. \"Yes, I guess so. Harper called us down for a meeting before I had a chance to eat.\"</p><p>Satoshi opened the door for her and he followed her in. A waitress appeared, led them over to a table and gave them menus.</p><p>Satoshi scooted in very close to her. She sniffed the air. Damn, he smells nice. She shook her head. Forget it. \"Pancakes, sausage, the fruit of the day, scrambled eggs and coffee,\" Shaundra ordered.</p><p>\"That's a lot of food,\" Satoshi replied as he leaned in closer to her.</p><p>\"I always eat like this when I have problems. It helps me stay focused.</p><p>I need real food and rice is not going to do it.\"</p><p>\"I'll have the same,\" Satoshi replied, sending the waitress off. \"I've lost some weight practicing for the concert and I need to build up more muscle.\"</p><p>Shaundra looked him over. \"You're kidding right? You're body is perfect.\" She looked around the room nervously. Where is that food? Maybe having breakfast with Satoshi wasn't the brightest thing to do.</p><p>Satoshi chuckled. \"Thanks, but that's just this suit. It's very flattering.\"</p><p>Shaundra smirked. He was such a tease. \"Now answer me. Did those two get into a fight?\"</p><p>\"Yes,\" he replied, staring into her eyes.</p><p>\"And does Ichiro have a black eye?\"</p><p>\"Yes.\" He smiled at her.</p><p>Shaundra gasped. \"The poor baby.\"</p><p>Satoshio reached out and touched a lock of her hair. \"Better not let him hear you call him that. He has a fragile ego when it comes to his age.\"</p><p>Shaundra slapped his hands away. She couldn't breathe with him so near. \"Why didn't you guys protect him?\"</p><p>Satoshi chuckled. \"Believe it or not, he doesn't need protection from Yori. They were going at it pretty good until Takumijo and I stopped them. He might be younger than we are, but he is a more skilled fighter.</p><p>Yori just got in a lucky hit.\"</p><p>Shaundra slapped her hands against her cheeks in disbelief. \"To that beautiful face. Is he crazy?\"</p><p>\"It's not that bad.\"</p><p>\"You can say that because yours is still perfect.\"</p><p>Satoshi leaned forward. \"You think my face is perfect.\"</p><p>Shit, why don't I think before I speak? \"Of course I do. You have very sexy dark eyes, a slim nose, and full lips. I don't even see a blemish. God, were you guys genetically engineered? If your face was any more perfect, it would be illegal.\" Ooh, dry panties, good. She was beginning to think that her mind was out to turn her into a slut.</p><p>Satoshi sat back. \"Wow, I can see why those two are fighting over you. I do believe that you have surprised me with your honesty. Most women tell me things just to feed my ego.\"</p><p>\"I'm not like most women. I'm just telling you what I see when I look at you.\" She sat back. \"What am I going to do about them two?\" Fighting at their age...ridiculous.</p><p>\"Come to Osaka and write the story.\"</p><p>Shaundra did a double take with her head. \"Are you crazy or do you not know about the fan girl contract on my head? I can't put Aomori in danger.\"</p><p>The waitress returned with their breakfast, poured their coffee, looked at both of them oddly and then left.</p><p>\"Yes, I know. Yori had to close down his networking websites and pages. They want to know why he chose you over them.\"</p><p>Shaundra raised an eyebrow. She just had to hear this. \"A good question.\"</p><p>Satoshi looked shocked. \"You don't know why?\"</p><p>\"No. I'm older, a different race, and an erotic writer.\"</p><p>\"Yes, yes, and yes, all fine qualities as a mate.\" He winked at her.</p><p>\"Who wants typical when he can have different?\" He paused. \"And he's in love with you.\"</p><p>Shaundra nearly choked on her coffee. \"He is not. He's engaged. All I am to him is a temporary fascination. I don't think you come across many African American females and he's curious.\"</p><p>Satoshio folded his arms in front of him. \"Then why do you think he hit Ichiro? They've been like brothers from the moment they met.\"</p><p>\"Because he's a bully.\"</p><p>\"No, because he's jealous. He doesn't want Ichiro in your bed.\"</p><p>Shaundra blushed as the image entered her head. \"But he'd look so good there with all that hair spread out on my pillow.\"</p><p>Satoshi's head bobbed up and down. \"You love his hair too?\"</p><p>Shaundra stopped the fantasy and stared at him.</p><p>He shook his head in denial. \"I'm not gay,\" Satoshi assured her. \"I just have this thing for his hair. Always have. I think I'm jealous because mine won't grow that long or feel so soft.\"</p><p>\"Is it really soft?\" Shaundra asked, forgetting about her food.</p><p>Satoshi lifted his cup and sipped. \"Yes, and he keeps it squeaky clean.\"</p><p>Shaundra trembled involuntarily. \"I think I better stop talking about Ichiro's hair before I...\" Shaundra clamped her legs tight.</p><p>Satoshi smiled wickedly at her. \"I would be glad to assist you with your little problem.\" He pointed downward toward his crotch.</p><p>\"I do not have a little problem.\" Think happy thoughts. Think happy thoughts.</p><p>He leaned closer. \"I am not an innocent like Ichiro. I do know that look. The thought of him and that hair has you aroused.\"</p><p>Shaundra fanned herself with a napkin. \"Okay, so I admit that it has me curious.\"</p><p>\"And wet.\"</p><p>She tossed the napkin at him. \"You are horrible.\"</p><p>\"And you are one sexy author.\"</p><p>She was going to strangle him if he didn't stop. Shaundra put her finger to her lip to silence him. \"Shush, that is a secret.\"</p><p>He leaned back in the seat. \"How long are you going to tease the two of them?\"</p><p>\"I'm not teasing. Something always comes up at the wrong moment.\"</p><p>\"It wouldn't with me.\"</p><p>Her head did that spin thing again. \"Huh?\" She looked over at him.</p><p>\"Does this come as a surprise that I might be interested in you too?\"</p><p>Shaundra shook her head. God, he was so beautiful too. \"No, you made it perfectly clear a moment ago when you offered to help me with my little problem. The only thing I can't figure out is why?\"</p><p>\"Because I have a feeling that there is more to Shaundra Morrison than meets the eye.\"</p><p>Shaundra reached for her glass of water and took a big sip before answering. \"No there isn't.\"</p><p>\"Come to Osaka and prove it to me.\"</p><p>\"Ichiro and Yori won't let you get near me.\"</p><p>\"I'm near you now and, besides, Masaaki has warned them to stop this bickering.\"</p><p>Takumijo entered the restaurant and headed toward their table. He was dressed in a pair of jeans that rode low on his narrow hips, a white sleeveless sweatshirt that had seen better days, and a pair of sandals. His long hair was mussed like he'd just stepped out of the showers.</p><p>Damn, is this misery ever going to end? \"Satoshi, this is low even for you.\"</p><p>Satoshi straightened up in the seat. \"What do you mean?\" he asked innocently.</p><p>Devil child. She picked up her cup of coffee and sipped as she eyed Takumijo's muscles.</p><p>Takumijo joined them at the table. \"Sneaking out with Ms. Morrison for an early morning rendezvous while Yori and Ichiro are stuck in their rooms like two caged animals.\"</p><p>Shaundra smiled from behind her cup of coffee and tried not to choke.</p><p>\"No, I believe I have done worse stuff, and you could at least say good morning.\"</p><p>Takumijo said something swiftly in Japanese and signaled for the waitress. The young woman hurried over bearing a menu and a very big smile. \"I'll have what they're having, but double portions. That workout has me famished.\" The waitress went off giggling. \"What are you two up to this morning?\" he asked, reaching for a piece of sausage from Satoshi's plate.</p><p>\"We are discussing Ms. Morrison's trip to Osaka with us.\"</p><p>\"You're going to like Osaka. It's very beautiful this time of year, and you have to see our home. It has a rehearsal and a dance studio.\"</p><p>Shaundra cut into a pancake and popped it into her mouth. She chewed carefully and then swallowed. \"I think those are the most words I've heard you say since we met.\" Dry panties, yeah. Takumijo did not see her as a conquest.</p><p>\"I figured it was about time I got acquainted with the woman who may or may not be the end of Aomori.\"</p><p>\"Damn,\" Shaundra replied as she frowned at him. \"Maybe you shouldn't talk to me.\"</p><p>\"All I'm saying is you have three of my friends all emotionally involved with you. So, if you're going to come with us to Osaka, I guess I have to be the one to protect you from them.\"</p><p>The waitress returned with his food and Takumijo rewarded her with a smile and sent her on her way.</p><p>Satoshi made a face. \"I don't see why all these women like you.\"</p><p>Takumijo flexed a muscle at him. \"Because they have good taste.\" He began eating his meal.</p><p>Satoshi touched her hair again. \"Ms. Morrison does not need protection from me. I am harmless.\"</p><p>Shaundra brushed it away.</p><p>Takumijo swallowed. \"About as harmless as a tarantula. I bet you've already made a pass at her. He turned to her. \"Don't be taken in by his sweet talk. Behind those big brown eyes beats the mind of a serial Romeo.\"</p><p>Shaundra laughed. She hadn't known Takumijo had such a sense of humor. \"I'll be on my guard.\"</p><p>\"So, you are agreeing to come to Osaka?\"</p><p>Ichiro entered the restaurant dressed in a pair of black jeans with silver chains running through the belt hoops and around one of his legs. He also wore a skin-tight, black sleeveless T-shirt that showed off the muscles of his well-developed chest. His hair was pulled back in a ponytail and the most of it was shoved beneath a baseball cap except the tail and the bangs.</p><p>Talk about adorable and sexy.</p><p>Satoshi followed her eyes to the door. The crotch of her panties dampened.</p><p>\"Your eyes didn't flicker like that when Takumijo walked in.\"</p><p>Shaundra blushed. Busted.</p><p>\"Our baby has grown into a babe magnet,\" he told Takumijo.</p><p>Shaundra fanned herself. \"He sure has.\"</p><p>Ichiro walked over to her at the table, bowed, and then kissed her hand as he sat down next to her. He smacked his lips. \"Maple syrup.\"</p><p>\"Care to join us?\" She spotted the bruise under his eye. She reached out and touched it. Ichiro winced. \"I guess that hurts.\"</p><p>\"Well worth it.\"</p><p>She ran her finger down his cheek to his chin. \"Hopefully it will never happen again.\" She beckoned him closer and kissed the spot.</p><p>\"I have a bruise right here,\" Satoshi told her for attention.\" He pointed to his lips.</p><p>Shaundra got over, walked over to him and kissed on him on the lips, surprising him, and then returned to her seat.</p><p>Ichiro chuckled. \"You better enjoy that because it is the only one you're going to get.\" Satoshi sat stunned. \"That was so delightful.\"</p><p>The waitress had returned and stood there staring at Ichiro, quite flustered, like she was about to faint in his presence. \"What can I get for you, Mr. Yoshida? Would you like some coffee?\"</p><p>\"Do you have any Shochu?\"</p><p>Shaundra laughed at the private joke.</p><p>\"What's so funny?\" Satoshi asked.</p><p>\"Shochu makes Ms. Morrison adventurous.\"</p><p>\"No,\" the waitress replied. \"We do not serve alcohol.\"</p><p>\"Then I'll have some tea, fresh fruit and wheat toast.\"</p><p>The young woman left, obviously shocked by their conversation.</p><p>\"I sure hope she's not a fan girl,\" Shaundra replied. \"I'd hate to have her poison my food.\" She looked up at the door. Aomori's leader entered.</p><p>\"Damn,\" Satoshi replied. \"Those eyes do that for him too.\"</p><p>\"What are you mumbling about?\" Ichiro asked Satoshi as Shaundra fed him from her plate.</p><p>\"Nothing, and since when do you eat pancakes?\"</p><p>\"I am suddenly developing a strange liking to them.\"</p><p>\"Good morning,\" Yori said as he approached.</p><p>\"Good morning,\" Shaundra replied. \"Would you care to join us?\"</p><p>He did so hesitantly and sat on the other side of Takumijo.</p><p>She fed Ichiro again and the young man licked the syrup from his lips.</p><p>Shaundra sighed. Heaven couldn't get any better than sitting around a table eating pancakes in the presence of the four handsomest men in the world.</p><p>The waitress returned with Ichiro's food and nearly fainted when she saw Yori. \"Good morning, Mr. Morioka.\"</p><p>Yori nodded at her and she broke into a big, stupid grin. She handed him a menu.</p><p>\"I don't need one,\" he said, watching Shaundra still feeding Ichiro. \"I know what I want.\"</p><p>\"Yes?\"</p><p>Shaundra looked over at him and he stared back.</p><p>\"What I want isn't on the menu.\"</p><p>Shaundra gulped. Apparently, he meant her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\"Do I look okay?\" Shaundra asked Dorothy as they walked into the ballroom after the grand opening of KiNii.</p><p>\"You look smashing, and red is definitely your color.\"</p><p>Shaundra hated formal events, dreaded wearing a long gown, and after an hour of walking in high heels, the balls of her feet would be screaming for mercy. She pulled at the straps of her gown. \"I hope I don't flash anyone in this halter top. My boobs are just popping out of this thing.\"</p><p>Dorothy chuckled. \"Like I told you before, if I had your figure, I'd be letting it all hang out.\"</p> <p>Dorothy was dressed for her age in a long blue gown with a matronly collar while she was showing a lot of cleavage. She had to stop Harper from choosing her clothes and underwear. The thong and garter he had picked out for her tonight was simply shocking.</p><p>\"You look beautiful. Stop fidgeting.\"</p><p>\"This thong is sliding up my butt and cutting off my circulation.\"</p><p>Dorothy chuckled, led her into the ballroom and up front to the podium stage where she and the rest of the authors would sit during the beginning of the program. Jackson, Riley and the four Asian writers were already seated.</p><p>The next couple of hours went through in a blur of boring speeches followed by the introduction of the authors to the audience. Hordes and hordes of publishers, editors and the news media made the evening complete with reporters pushing mikes and cameras in their faces, asking the same type of questions about their careers and seeming pretty shocked to learn that she wrote erotica. The highlight of her day so far had been the book signing, which had taken place earlier. Both Temptation and her latest, Rapture, literally flew off the shelves because they were translated in Japanese. The other authors did equally well and they even received orders that Harper and Mr. Niigata promised would be shipped the first thing in the morning.</p> <p>After another round of questions, Mr. Niigata thanked everyone for coming and announced that dinner and dancing was to take place shortly in another room. Crowds piled into the second ballroom, which also would serve as the dining room. Aomori had yet to put in an appearance.</p><p>Mr. Niigata had sectioned off tables for the authors and their guests.</p><p>She and Dorothy led the way over to the table to look for their spots.</p><p>\"Where is Aomori?\" Dorothy asked after they arrived at the table.</p><p>Shaundra found her spot. She was seated right in the middle between Yori and Ichiro. Her eyes landed on the place card to Yori's right...Amaya Saitama. She picked it up and showed it to Dorothy.</p><p>\"I thought she went home two weeks ago?\"</p> <p>\"I thought so too. Maybe she's flying back in for this special occasion.\"</p><p>\"Maybe,\" Dorothy replied.</p><p>They were both answered when the young woman entered wearing a cute purple evening gown that looked like it was made just for her, which it possiblly could have been since both her parents were famous fashion designers. There was nothing flashy about her, just pretty and polite with long, black hair styled in long waves.</p><p>She approached. \"Hello, my name is Amaya Saitama, Yori's fiancee. I have wanted to meet you for some time now...since I saw the two of you together on that magazine cover.\" She bowed and extended her small hand out to Shaundra, which Shaundra accepted with grace since most Japanese did not like to shake hands. She still didn't trust her, though, after that little rolling of the eyes incident in the restaurant.</p><p>\"Hello, it is nice to meet you. I didn't know that you were still in town.\"</p><p>\"I wasn't. I flew back in because Yori asked me to. I'll have to fly back out tomorrow because I have to attend class.\"</p><p>\"You're in college?\" Shaundra asked, trying to ignore the fact that Yori had sent for her.</p><p>\"Yes, my last year. I will be joining my parents full-time in their business when I graduate and Yori and I will be married shortly afterwards.\"</p> <p>There it was. Amaya had round about told her that Yori was hers and that she better keep her hands off of him. She did it so cool and calmly.</p><p>Shrewd for someone so young.</p><p>Dorothy nudged her from behind, which Shaundra chose to ignore.</p><p>\"That's nice, dear. I wish you happiness and success in both endeavors.\"</p><p>With that, Amaya bowed again and then sat down. Shaundra and Dorothy slid into their seats.</p><p>Harper finally broke away and came over to talk to them, looking stunning in a white tuxedo with a black cummerbund and bow tie.</p><p>\"Are you three ladies enjoying yourselves?\" he asked, grabbing three glasses of champagne from a passing waiter and giving it to them before taking one for himself.</p><p>\"I've just arrived,\" Amaya announced. \"Sorry that I missed your speech.\"</p><p>Shaundra put down her glass. Okay, when had the two of them become friends, and why? Had he made a pass at her the night of the after-concert party? \"I'll make sure you get a video of the entire event,\" Harper told Amaya.</p><p>\"Thank you.\"</p><p>Okay, they are too chummy, Shaundra thought.</p><p>Harper turned his attention back on her. \"Stand up and let me look at you.\"</p><p>\"Why?\" Shaundra asked, still perplexed by Harper's conversation with Amaya.</p><p>\"To see if it fits the way I imagined it would.\"</p><p>Harper had a warped sense of reality, but he had very good taste in female clothes. She wondered if he was a closeted cross-dresser. She rose and he spun her around.</p><p>\"You can still bounce a coin off that ass.\"</p><p>Shaundra slid back into her chair. \"How much have you had to drink today, boss man?\"</p><p>\"Not as much as you think. Mr. Niigata and I just shared a bottle of sake earlier to celebrate.\"</p><p>\"I must try some of that before I return to the United States,\" Dorothy announced.</p><p>Shaundra shook her head rapidly. \"No, you shouldn't,\" she replied.</p><p>\"You will not like it.\"</p><p>\"Have you tried some?\" Dorothy asked.</p><p>\"Yes, it takes like...\" She didn't want to finish the sentence and be insulting.</p><p>\"What does it taste like?\" Dorothy asked.</p><p>Shaundra stuck out her tongue. \"Not tasty.\"</p><p>Harper laughed. \"Yes, I thought it was horrible, too, at first, but after several of those tiny little cups, it grew on me.\"</p><p>\"You can't convince me of that,\" Shaundra said sarcastically.</p><p>\"Where is Aomori?\" Amaya asked as their table began to fill. Jackson and Riley had arrived with Chirau and Izanami in tow, and Hideohi and Iwao arrived with two female friends she did not know, but could possibly be their girlfriends. John Sampson also entered and sat down next to Dorothy, leaving two seats next to her and Amaya.</p><p>Harper pointed to the stage. Both she and Amaya turned to look.</p><p>Aomori had arrived and were about to perform. \"Mr. Niigata wanted it to be a surprise. He didn't want fans camped outside all night so he didn't mention that they were scheduled to entertain.\" He walked away for them and over to his seat on the opposite side of the table and sat down just as the lights dimmed.</p><p>Japanese young people hopped to their feet as soon as Aomori began to sing. It reminded her of when she'd attended concerts and dances when she was younger. Aomori performed five song and the then the lights were raised. The crowd applauded like crazy and begged for more songs. A half hour later, all four men came out through a side door wearing white suits.</p><p>Yori arrived at the table first and sat down next to Amaya, but not before winking at her and looking her directly in the eyes. Tease.</p><p>Satoshi arrived and sat across from them right next to a pretty young woman with blonde hair. Takumijo's date surprisingly turned out to be a young woman whom she later learned was a famous Japanese actress that he'd once performed with.</p><p>Ichiro bowed to her and then sat down. He had done something different with his hair. Instead of the long ponytail, he had wound it into a bun at his neck. It looked neat and went well with the tux. But the moment she saw it, Shaundra's mind started releasing it from the band and spreading it out on her pillow. Why does it do that? Dinner was a Japanese menu, during which they socialized and got to meet the other people at their table. Most of the women were very interested in Amaya once they learned that she not only was Yori's fiancee, but also the daughter of two famous Japanese fashion designers.</p><p>Shaundra caught a glimpse at something she hadn't noticed earlier, a diamond engagement ring on Amaya's finger. Jealousy stabbed her in a chest and then it subsided. What good would it do to fret about something that was done long before she'd arrived? The music started up again and people got out of their seats.</p><p>\"Would you care to dance?\" Ichiro asked her.</p><p>\"I'd be delighted, Mr. Yoshida.\" Ichiro helped her to her feet and did not miss the delighted look on his face when he finally saw her in that gown. \"You look so beautiful.\"</p><p>All she could do was smile as he led her onto the dance floor and took her into his arms.</p><p>\"I do believe I am the envy of every man here,\" he told her as they danced slowly to a song she'd never heard before.</p><p>\"Why would you say that?\"</p><p>\"Because it is true. That gown fits you perfectly.\"</p><p>\"Then you'll have to thank my boss because he picked it out for me.\"</p><p>Ichiro chuckled. \"He has excellent taste.\"</p><p>She thought it would bother him more that another man picked out her clothes. \"And the shoes and the underwear.\"</p><p>His grip tightened around her waist. \"Are you serious?\"</p><p>\"Yes. I think he used to play with dolls when he was a kid.\"</p><p>\"What type of underwear did he pick out for you?\"</p><p>\"A thong.\"</p><p>Ichiro's body hardened below the belt and an erection quickly rose.</p><p>\"That's going to be hard to hide in a white tuxedo,\" Shaundra teased.</p><p>\"I have a very vivid imagination when it comes to you.\"</p><p>\"So does Harper.\"</p><p>\"Is it red?\"</p><p>\"What?\"</p><p>\"The thong.\"</p><p>\"Yes, the same color as the gown.\" Ichiro groaned and Shaundra chuckled at his discomfort. \"Would it help if I told you that wearing a thong is the most uncomfortable thing I have ever worn in my life and I can't wait to take it off?\"</p><p>\"Not really,\" he said hoarsely. \"I think it made it worse.\"</p><p>Lucky for him, the dance floor was pretty dim and they managed to get back to their table without anyone noticing. Ichiro rushed off to the men's room to put his hands in very cold water.</p><p>\"What's wrong with him?\" Dorothy asked as both of them watched Ichiro walk away. He had a great butt.</p><p>\"He has an unexpected rise in a very tight pair of white pants.\"</p><p>Dorothy laughed. \"That's what I like about young men. It doesn't take much to get them motivated. You're so lucky.\"</p><p>\"At least you've gotten some since you've arrived. I'm still at the starting line.\"</p><p>\"May I have this dance?\" a man asked from behind her.</p><p>It was Satoshi.</p><p>\"I don't know. It wouldn't be nice if a fight broke out here tonight.\"</p><p>\"Go on,\" Dorothy told her. \"I'll entertain your little angel when he gets back. I'll keep him from blowing a gasket.\"</p><p>Shaundra rose, not sure that what she was doing was right, and let Satoshi lead her on the floor to dance. He, too, was good at it and he was just tad bit taller than Ichiro, which made him about six-one.</p><p>Satoshi wrapped his arms around her waist and pulled her close to him. \"What did you do to Ich that made him hurry away from the table?\"</p><p>\"What makes you assume I did something to him? The man had to use the restroom.\" She continued to dance and not pull away from him like her instincts told her to do.</p><p>\"He doesn't like to use public restrooms. He has this germ phobia.\"</p><p>\"Maybe he had to go real bad and couldn't hold his bladder.\"</p><p>Satoshi chuckled. \"I love your sense of humor and that gown you're wearing.\" He dipped her and then pulled her back into his arms.</p><p>She wasn't going to feed him the same story about Harper and the underwear. One horny pop singer was enough for her. \"My boss picked it out for me.\"</p><p>\"Why?\"</p><p>\"Because he wanted me to get noticed. He thinks it's great for publicity, me being an erotic author and all.\"</p><p>\"It worked,\" Satoshi replied. \"You're the prettiest woman here.\"</p><p>\"I would stand out like a sore thumb in anything I wore here. I think I may be the only African American female present.\"</p><p>\"Do you have a problem with that?\"</p><p>\"No, I can fit in anywhere I go.\"</p><p>\"But I still think you're the prettiest woman here,\" Satoshi insisted.</p><p>\"I doubt that. Amaya is a stunning young woman.\"</p><p>Satoshi missed a stepped and then got back on track. \"Oh, so you finally got to meet her.\"</p><p>Why did Ichiro and Satoshi think that she wouldn't find out about Amaya? \"It was pretty hard not to since she walked up to me and introduced herself. She's very pretty, pale and petite.\"</p><p>\"And she's quite the little bitch.\" He dipped her again.</p><p>Shaundra gasped. \"I didn't expect you to say that.\"</p><p>Satoshi moved back into position. \"But it's the truth,\" he whispered into her ear. \"Don't let that sweet smile and manners fool you. Beneath that designer gown and groomed hair lies the heart of a cunning little bitch.\" His body stiffened.</p><p>\"Let me guess, you do not like her.\" She didn't either, but it wasn't her place to say.</p><p>\"No, but I would never tell Yori that. He sees her differently than I do.</p><p>She has always had him wrapped around her little finger.\"</p><p>Had she hit a nerve? \"So you have to get along with her since she's about to marry your best friend.\"</p><p>\"I did not expect for you to be okay with that.\"</p><p>Shaundra finally felt relaxed in his arms. \"The two of them getting married has nothing to do with me. They were engaged long before I came here and will be after I leave.\"</p><p>\"But I thought you liked Yori,\" he whispered in her ear like it was a secret.</p><p>\"I do, but I am not foolish enough to believe that he would break his engagement just because he thinks he wants me. And I don't expect him to since I'll be leaving shortly.\"</p><p>\"Would you still leave if things were differently? If he did broke up with her?\"</p><p>\"I don't know. I have a life in the United States.\"</p><p>\"Poor Ichiro will be devastated when you leave. He is so different now that you're here.\"</p><p>\"I'm worried about that too. I like to hear his voice, but I'm afraid he'll crawl back into his shell once I leave.\"</p><p>\"And he knows you're leaving?\"</p><p>\"Yes, he says he understands.\"</p><p>\"But you don't believe him?\" Satoshi asked.</p><p>\"No, I do not. I care for Ichiro. I don't want to hurt him.\"</p><p>\"Then don't.\" The music ended and he walked her back to the table, bowed and turned her back over to Ichiro who had returned. Satoshi turned on his heels and left.</p><p>Shaundra frowned and sat down. What is wrong with these men? \"He didn't try anything, did he?\" Ichiro asked suspiciously.</p><p>Shaundra smiled at him. \"No, we just talked. He's really not so bad.\"</p><p>Ichiro smiled back at her and nodded his head up and down. \"Yes, he is. Don't let that innocent baby face fool you. Satoshi is a player.\"</p><p>She patted his hand. \"I already know that. But at least he talks to me and doesn't treat me like an outcast.\"</p><p>\"I don't know if I should be jealous or not. Even Takumijo thinks highly of you and usually he's only concerned with himself and his image in the mirror.\"</p><p>Shaundra laughed. \"Don't worry. I think your friends are great, even Takumijo.\"</p><p>A waiter came with another tray of champagne and Ichiro commandeered one for both of them. He handed one to her. \"How long do we have to stay here?\" he asked.</p><p>\"Probably until it's over since we have no other way of getting back to the hotel. Or did you rent another car and plot an escape?\"</p><p>Ichiro shook his head. \"Masaaki and Yori threatened to kick my ass if I did something like that again,\" he confessed.</p><p>She winked at him. \"It must be tough being the youngest.\"</p><p>Ichiro smiled and then looked around to see if anyone had noticed.</p><p>\"I'm just a couple of months younger that Satoshi, and yes, it is difficult.</p><p>Everything we do is for the group.\"</p><p>She leaned closer. \"So what's the plan? Even I know you're not going to let a little threat stop you.\"</p><p>Ichiro smiled innocently. \"There is a garden on the left side of the building. I think I can manage to sneak away for a couple of minutes without Masaaki having a heart attack.\"</p><p>Shaundra put her glass of champagne on the table. \"You want me to steal away with you to a garden outside?\" She smiled. \"I think I can handle that.\"</p><p>Yori watched Ichiro and Shaundra slip out the side door.</p><p>\"They seem happy,\" Amaya replied from his right. \"I thought the age difference might be a problem, but Ichiro seems to adore her.\"</p><p>\"He's comfortable with her.\" A little too comfortable, Yori thought as he moved around in his seat.</p><p>\"What is he going to do when she goes back to the United States?\"</p><p>\"I don't know.\" And he really didn't care.</p><p>\"And what about your heart? What will you do once she leaves?\"</p><p>Yori turned and looked at Amaya. Why the hell is she asking me this? It was on the tip of his tongue to tell her that he would die inside once Shaundra left. \"What do you mean? Her staying or leaving will not have any impact on me.\"</p><p>Amaya chuckled. \"I told you once before that I wasn't a fool. You feel something for her even if you won't admit it to yourself.\"</p><p>He dusted an imaginary piece of lint from his trousers. \"She's a very nice person, but there can never be anything between us. You and I are engaged. You don't have anything to worry about.\"</p><p>\"Then what is it that makes you stare at the door they just went out?\"</p><p>Was there no end to her questioning? \"Hoping he's just staying in the garden and not try to slip off with her again. He took a pretty big chance knowing some of our fans do not like her. Not to mention that a lot of them would kidnap him if they got the chance to.\"</p><p>\"I think it is romantic that he would break rules to have a few moments to be alone with her.\" She sighed. \"I wonder what they talk about.\"</p><p>\"Knowing Ich, it's probably food. His restaurant here in Tokyo is almost complete.\"</p><p>\"Yes, I've heard about it from father. He says he's going to send all his clients to eat there when it does open.\"</p><p>\"Ichiro will appreciate that. It has been his dream since he was young, in honor of his beloved grandmother.\"</p><p>\"Hmm, do you think there's a chance that he and Ms. Morrison might get married?\"</p><p>\"I don't know.\" He did care about that. He looked at the door again, wondering what they were doing. They were probably kissing and holding hands. He frowned and thought they'd better not be doing anything else.</p><p>Shaundra was his.</p><p>\"Do you know that Harper Kehoe picked out that gown she's wearing tonight?\"</p><p>\"No, I didn't know that,\" Yori replied. \"But it doesn't surprise me since he purchased all the other clothes she's been wearing to functions.\"</p><p>\"I got the info straight from one of our salesclerks from one of our clothing stores. She told me he came in and ordered several outfits for her and that other woman, Dorothy.\" She giggled. \"He even purchased lingerie for her...the good stuff.\"</p><p>Yori stiffened. \"The good stuff?\"</p><p>Amaya nodded. \"Yes, frilly, lacey and very expensive. My father said Mr. Kehoe has a good eye for fashion and the two of them have plans to get together to discuss some business plans before he leaves Japan.\"</p><p>The thought of man purchasing underwear for Shaundra did not appeal to him. \"Did he also purchase the underwear she's wearing right now beneath that red gown?\"</p><p>Amaya nodded. \"He purchased a red thong and a garter belt.\"</p><p>Yori crossed his legs. There was something not right with this picture.</p><p>\"Why would her boss buy her seductive underwear?\"</p><p>\"Maybe he wants to see her in it. He might be interested in her too.\"</p><p>\"That would make sense.\" Yori did not like that. If anyone was going to see her in that red thong, it was going to be him.</p><p>The door opened and Ichiro and Shaundra came in. Ichiro was fixing his clothes and wiping his lips again.</p><p>\"It looks like the two of them were getting busy in the garden,\" Amaya said with a giggle.</p><p>\"He would not do something like that in a public place. He might be coming out of his shell, but he's not that daring.\"</p><p>Amaya picked up her glass of champagne and sipped. \"I don't know.</p><p>Lust makes men do foolish things.\"</p><p>\"How do you know about what lusting men do?\"</p><p>\"I mean, I've heard,\" Amaya corrected.</p><p>Her legs were still trembling even though they had come from the garden nearly an hour ago. Ichiro was just too much. A private secluded garden under a starry summer sky in Tokyo had set the scene for the perfect liaison between lovers. His kisses were soft, yet demanding, and his rock hard erection pressed against her crotch through their clothes did nothing but keep them both very turned on, even though it was impossible to complete the act. She couldn't wait to leave the party so she could take him back to her room and make a mess of him in her bed. She looked down at her watch, wondering how much longer she had to sit there being tortured.</p><p>Masaaki and Mr. Niigata walked over to the podium and thanked everyone for coming to the party.</p><p>Not much longer, she thought.</p><p>Amaya got up excused herself and walked off to the restroom. Poor Ichiro had dashed back to the men's room just as soon as they came in from the garden. The thought made her thong more uncomfortable.</p><p>\"Are you okay?\"</p><p>Shaundra turned to her right and found Yori watching her with a little too much interest. \"I'm fine. I'm just a little tired.\" Her heart started beating fast again. The two of them hadn't spoken in a while and she actually missed hearing his voice and seeing him.</p><p>\"This is almost over and you can go back to the hotel and sleep.\"</p><p>Sleep was the furthest thing from her mind. \"Yes, I can't wait to get out of these clothes and get comfortable.\"</p><p>\"Yes, I suppose a red thong is uncomfortable.\"</p><p>Shaundra scowled at him. \"How do you know what I'm wearing under this gown? Can you see though the material?\"</p><p>\"No, Amaya told me that Harper Kehoe purchased this outfit for you along with some sexy underwear from one of her father's stores.\"</p><p>\"So, it's no big secret. He thinks I'm a doll that he likes to dress.\"</p><p>He moved in closer to her. \"Does he often buy you lingerie too?\"</p><p>Shaundra stepped back suddenly realizing that she was still emotionally attached to him. \"Not often, just since I've been here. He has had some really nice taste up until now. Thongs are for young women.\"</p><p>\"I bet it looks good on you against that chocolate skin.\"</p><p>Shaundra gasped and clamped her thighs together. \"Shush. Someone will hear you.\"</p><p>\"I don't care.\"</p><p>She sniffed at him. \"Are you drunk? You should care. What if Amaya hears you?\"</p><p>\"She's in the ladies room.\"</p><p>\"You still shouldn't say it.\"</p><p>He touched her face with his finger. \"You don't seem to have a problem with Ichiro seeing you in it.\"</p><p>Shaundra rolled her eyes at him and moved away from his hand. \"No one is going to see me in it. I plan to get out of it as soon as I get to my room.\"</p><p>\"Do you need any assistance getting out of it?\"</p><p>Heat roared up through her body like a hot flash. \"Stop teasing me, Yori. You are on a date with your fiancee. Should you be taking such liberties?\" Damn her traitorous body.</p><p>\"No, but I'm not stupid enough to pass up an opportunity like this.\"</p><p>\"Sorry, but you had the chance and you chose your fiancee.\"</p><p>Yori removed his finger.</p><p>Ichiro and Amaya walked back into the ballroom together just as the party ended. Ichiro winked at her.</p><p>Anticipation rushed through her. This was really going to happen between the two of them. She smiled back. In less than an hour, she'd have him naked and ready. Finally, this trip to the other side of the world was starting to be fun.</p><p>Masaaki approached as the group walked toward the exit. He called the band members aside and told the rest of them to get into the limousines.</p><p>Ichiro squeezed her hand. \"I'll be back in a second.\" He left and she followed Harper and the others out the door and into the waiting cars. Her cell phone went off. Shaundra dug into her clutch and retrieved it. \"Hello.\"</p><p>\"It's me, Ichiro. You're going to have to go back to the hotel without us. Mr. Niigata has arranged a business meeting for us at this very moment.\"</p><p>\"Crap.\"</p><p>\"What's wrong?\" Harper asked.</p><p>Shaundra pounded the seat next to her with her fist. \"Nothing. Aomori isn't coming back to the hotel with us. Mr. Niigata has called a meeting.\"</p><p>Stupid meeting.</p><p>Harper pushed the button and relayed the message to Kenshin.</p><p>The driver moved the car away from the curb.</p><p>\"I'm sorry, Shaundra,\" Ichiro said to her through the receiver. \"It's my job.\"</p><p>\"Yes, I know. I'll see you later.\"</p><p>\"If it's not too late. Sometimes these meetings go on to the wee hours of the morning.\"</p><p>\"Then I'll see you tomorrow.\" She disconnected the phone call. Damn Mr. Niigata. Once again, Ichiro had been torn from her grasp. She shoved the cell phone back into her purse.</p><p>Dorothy patted her hand. \"A cold shower will help.\"</p><p>She leaned her head back against the seat and through her hand over her forehead. \"Am I that transparent?\"</p><p>Dorothy fanned the air around her. \"Girl, I could feel the heat from the two of you all night.\"</p><p>Harper moved into the seat next to her. \"It's business. You do understand that Mr. Niigata has to keep them in the public eye?\"</p><p>Shaundra lowered her hand and straightened up in the seat. \"I don't know what's you are implying.\"</p><p>Harper chuckled. \"Mr. Niigata has put a cramp in your plans to get busy with Ichiro.\"</p><p>Shaundra placed him playfully on the shoulder. \"I think both of you are mean and are just doing things to torture me. First, you put those pretty men in my face and now you're taking them away. I think both of you are using me for your own selfish reasons.\"</p><p>\"Now would I do something like that?\" Harper asked, lying back in the seat.</p><p>\"Hell yes,\" Shaundra and Dorothy answered. Riley and Jackson laughed.</p><p>Harper patted her hand. \"You know me so well. Don't think I don't know what's been going on between you and those over-sexed boy toys.\"</p><p>Shaundra turned up her nose at the term. \"Nothing has been going on.\"</p><p>She looked at Dorothy for sympathy and Dorothy just shrugged her shoulders.</p><p>\"You've got them competing to see who you're going to sleep with.\"</p><p>\"I have nothing to do with that. I can't help it if they have overactive imaginations.\"</p><p>\"And overactive sexual appetites. I happened to run into Ichiro in the men's room earlier. He was in a bit of a fix and wearing lipstick the same shade as the one you're wearing right now.\"</p><p>Shaundra rolled her eyes. \"It was just a kiss.\"</p><p>\"And what I saw was just an erection and a pretty impressive one, if I might add.\"</p><p>\"Damn, how did I miss that?\" Jackson replied.</p><p>Shaundra giggled. \"He is so cute. He makes me feel like I'm twenty- one again.\"</p><p>\"I just bet he does,\" Harper replied. \"Just remember that you're not.\"</p><p>Boy, did she hate her boss right at that very moment. \"So what are you trying to tell me?\"</p><p>\"Just think how you would feel if someone was doing this to one of your sons.\"</p><p>\"You're not going to lay a guilt trip on me, Harper. You know I wouldn't care if my sons dated someone older than they are. Look at what they're dating now. Those lazy heifers don't care about anything except getting their hair and nails fixed.\"</p><p>\"You're leaving for the United States in a couple of days,\" Harper reminded her.</p><p>\"What does that have to do with now?\" She knew what he said was true, but her raging hormones weren't listening.</p><p>They arrived at the hotel and parted ways after the elevator dumped the others on their floor. This was one time she was thankful that she didn't have to talk to Harper any more about her morals. He was just pissed that she didn't want him. She went into her room, undressed and put the gown into the cleaner bag. The shoes got deposited into a box and then she returned calls to both her daughters who had left her messages.</p><p>She also called her mother down South to see how she was doing. Other than the usual eighty-year-old aches, she was well and asked Shaundra to bring her back a kimono to impress her friends at the senior citizen center she visited a couple of times a week.</p><p>She still hadn't heard from Donald, and she hadn't expected to. She guessed he was having a grand time with his new girlfriend. Having nothing better to do, she donned a robe, pulled out her laptop and went back to writing her new novel for KiNii. The book involved two young men who met while on a cross-country trek to Taiwan. She glanced over at the clock several hours later. It was two in the morning. Her telephone rang. Shaundra reached over to answer it.</p><p>\"I saw your light was still on when I passed your room.\" \"Ichiro?\"</p><p>\"Yes, can't you sleep?\"</p><p>\"I'm working on a book and lost track of time. How was your meeting?\"</p><p>\"It went well. Mr. Niigata introduced us to some entertainment people from China. They liked the songs we performed tonight and want us to do a concert in China next year when we return from the United States.\"</p><p>\"That's great. Aomori is going to take the world by storm and you'll make plenty of money and friends.\"</p><p>\"What are you wearing?\" Ichiro asked, abruptly changing the subject.</p><p>\"A robe and a smile.\"</p><p>\"Are you tired?\"</p><p>\"No.\"</p><p>\"I'll be there in five minutes.\" He hung up before she could stop him.</p><p>He was at the door in four minutes still dressed in his white suit. Shaundra pulled him in quickly. \"I hope you weren't followed.\"</p><p>He wrapped his arms around her and lifted her off the floor. \"No, I was stealth. Everyone thinks I'm in my room.\"</p><p>Shaundra raised her head and kissed him. He tasted so innocent and delicious, and he showed amazing upper body strength by carrying her into the bedroom. He placed her on the bed, removed his jacket and tie and tossed them on the chair.</p><p>\"Ooh, I think I like this new side of you.\" He was down to his black bikini briefs faster than any older, more experienced man. He had a nice body - brand new, young man muscles, a developed chest and a narrow waist. The legs weren't bad either. A healthy erection strained against the briefs. \"I think I have died and gone to heaven.\"</p><p>He reached up and unloosed his hair and it cascaded down past his shoulders.</p><p>The little triangle piece of cloth between her legs moistened.</p><p>He helped her off the bed and sat down on it. \"Please, remove the robe now.\"</p><p>Shaundra untied the belt and opened the robe just to give him a peek.</p><p>She wasn't prepared for the look of shock on his face when she fully removed the robe. \"Is something wrong?\" she asked. \"Do I not please you?\"</p><p>His head bobbed up and down quickly. \"You please me more than you'll ever know.\"</p><p>\"Then what's the problem?\"</p><p>\"You're the first naked woman I've ever seen.\"</p><p>\"Well, technically, I'm not naked.\" She pointed to the thong. \"Oh my.</p><p>Did I just hear you right? You mean you're a...?\"</p><p>Ichiro blushed.</p><p>\"I am honored.\" Ooh, hot damn, she had hit the mother lode.</p><p>Everything was falling into place. Everything was perfect. She turned, giving him a full glance at her buttocks as she started peeling the band of the thong from around her waist and over her hips. \"Are you sure you're ready for this?\"</p><p>\"Yes,\" he said huskily.</p><p>Shaundra moved the thong down her legs and then she kicked them away and turned around to face him.</p><p>Ichiro gulped and reached for her, burying his face into her stomach.</p><p>Shaundra shuddered from the softness of his lips on her abdomen. The fire alarm in the room sounded. She groaned. \"Do you think it's a real fire?\"</p><p>Ichiro said something in Japanese that no doubt was a swear word. \"It probably is. Let's get dressed.\"</p><p>Shaundra hurried into some clothes while Ichiro put the white suit back on. They slipped out of the door and into the hall. The alarm sounded much louder out there. They followed other people from the floor down the stairwell and out the hotel. Harper waved them over.</p><p>\"We're just trying to account for all our people.\"</p><p>The rest of Aomori arrived along with their manager, their chauffer and Mr. Niigata.</p><p>\"Everyone is here,\" he told Mr. Niigata.</p><p>The fire truck arrived.</p><p>\"This better be real,\" Ichiro said as he hugged Shaundra from behind.</p><p>Shaundra nodded her head in agreement. Ichiro still had a semi-hard erection.</p><p>Satoshi inched over toward them. \"What's up?\"</p><p>\"My patience,\" Shaundra replied.</p><p>\"Nothing,\" Ichiro said.</p><p>\"Why are you still in your suit?\"</p><p>\"I had just taken it off when the alarm went off. Then I had to put it back on.\" He kissed Shaundra on the back of the head and released her.</p><p>Satoshi reached up and tenderly touched Ichiro's hair. \"You better put that away before you start a couple of fires out here. Can't you see how all those women are gawking at you?\"</p><p>Ichiro looked around quickly. \"Damn.\" He took a band out of his pocket and fixed his hair.</p><p>The firemen went into the building and left them standing outside for a couple of hours.</p><p>\"I am so damn tired,\" Dorothy said as she sat down on a curb. \"I had just dosed off.\"</p><p>Shaundra sat down next to her. \"Yeah, it couldn't have happened at the worst time. I was preparing for bed myself.\" She looked over at Ichiro.</p><p>\"You're fighting a losing battle,\" Dorothy replied, getting her drift.</p><p>\"The fates are fucking with you.\"</p><p>\"Yes, I know.\" There was no way Ichiro could sneak back to her room tonight with this ruckus going on. Yori walked over with Amaya. She'd bet the two of them had been together getting busy when the alarm had gone off.</p><p>The firemen exited and told them that it had been a small electrical fire in the restaurant and that it was safe for them to return to the room. She walked back inside with Ichiro and the others, stopping just outside her door. He looked at his watch. \"It's very late.\"</p><p>\"Yeah, I know.\"</p><p>\"Do you need me to come tuck you in?\"</p><p>\"No,\" Satoshi answered for her. \"It is very late. Time for you to go to bed.\"</p><p>Shaundra rolled her eyes at Satoshi, knowing there was no way she could invite Ichiro back in without drawing suspicions. Masaaki had probably ordered them to keep a close eye on him. Ichiro smiled one of those devastating smiles at her.</p><p>She nodded and used her key to go inside her room. Her phone rang shortly after she undressed and crawled into bed. \"Yes, Ich.\"</p><p>\"It's not Ich.\"</p><p>\"Yori?\"</p><p>\"Yes, I just wanted to make sure that you're back into your room safe and sound.\"</p><p>\"Yes, thank you.\"</p><p>\"And alone.\"</p><p>\"What do you mean by that?\"</p><p>\"I saw the way Ichiro was looking at you while we were outside.\"</p><p>\"So what does that mean?\"</p><p>\"Nothing, good night.\"</p><p>\"Good night.\" She hung up. That man, she decided, was so strange. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\"You see, that wasn't so bad,\" Harper said as he unstrapped her seatbelt when the plane landed in Osaka.</p><p>Shaundra opened her eyes and unglued her hands from the seat rest.</p><p>Ichiro sat at her right, smiling at her discomfort. \"See, flying's really not bad. You have made it here alive and in one piece.\"</p><p>\"This time,\" she muttered as she stared down at her white knuckles.</p> <p>Ichiro had convinced her not to take the anti-anxiety medication before she flew. The knots in her stomach began to ease.</p><p>Ichiro rose first, giving her a delightful view of his behind encased in a pair of khaki shorts. She slid out of the seat next, and Harper slid out after her. Their group had lessened by three. Riley, Jackson and Dorothy had returned to the United States, leaving her to fend for herself with Harper.</p><p>Of course, Juanda had a fit once she learned that Shaundra wouldn't be returning for another two weeks.</p><p>\"What's wrong with her?\" Takumijo asked as he walked up from the back of the plane.</p><p>\"She's afraid of flying,\" Yori explained.</p> <p>\"Crazy fear. There's nothing to it and it's the fastest way to get around.\"</p><p>\"That's easy for you to say. You are always having concerts all over the world,\" Shaundra replied.</p><p>The Kansai Airport was just as busy as the one in Tokyo with businessmen, tourists and daily commuters. It didn't take quite as long to get their luggage or get through Customs as it had when they'd first arrived in Japan. The only thing that was really different was the scores of screaming girls and young women who were there for the arrival of Aomori and the security guards who kept the crowds at bay while the band entered and left the airport. Throughout it all, Ichiro held her hand, ignoring the calls and shouting of his name. Like the other three, he now donned a hat and sunglasses, as if their six-foot frames could slip by unnoticed. A few of the girls brazenly took pictures and videos with their digital cameras and cell phones, and a few even tried to touch them.</p><p>\"Look, it's her, Shaundra Morrison,\" someone shouted. \"Yori's new girlfriend.\"</p><p>The crowd pushed forward, knocked down the barricade and headed directly for her. Ichiro and Yori jumped in front of her like they could stop a crowd of charging women. \"Get her out of here,\" Yori shouted at Ichiro.</p><p>Ichiro forced her to run the rest of the way through the airport and out into the waiting limousine van while the guards held back the mobbing fans. Satoshi, Yori, and Takumijo arrived next, followed by Harper, Mr.</p> <p>Niigata and Masaaki. John Sampson and Kenshin were the last to arrive.</p><p>Kenshin changed places with the young man who had arrived with the van. The other young man jumped out and helped stack the luggage and instruments in a second van, then they climbed into the other van while the guards continued to hold back the crowd. Ten or fifteen minutes later, both vans moved out of the parking spots and drove out the airport.</p><p>\"Man, that was close,\" Takumijo said, removing his cap and sunglasses. \"It hasn't been this bad in a long time.\"</p><p>\"Do you mean you've been through this before?\" Shaundra asked, still trying to catch her breath.</p><p>\"Yes, it happened a lot after our debut,\" Takumijo explained. \"The girls would go crazy, pulling at our clothes and hair, and a few of them have even thrown themselves at the hood of our vans.\"</p><p>\"Sorry,\" Shaundra apologized. \"This wouldn't have happened to you if I hadn't been with you.\"</p><p>\"Don't be,\" Yori said. \"Without those fans, we'd be nothing.\"</p><p>\"True,\" Satoshi agreed. \"They are our fan club, they buy our records, and they care for us better than our parents. They just get a little crazy at times when they think we're in danger.\"</p> <p>\"So they're attacking me because they think I'm a threat?\"</p><p>\"Yes,\" Satoshi explained. \"Each and every one of those girls dream of being that special one to us. Now they think you've stolen Yori away from them.\"</p><p>\"That's crazy,\" Shaundra replied. \"It's a one in a trillion chance that one of them will end up with one of you.\"</p><p>\"Didn't you have someone you idolized when you were their age?\"</p><p>Takumijo asked.</p><p>\"Yes, I dreamed of marrying one of the Jackson Five, but as you can tell, that didn't happen.\"</p><p>\"Which one?\" Ichiro asked.</p><p>\"Never mind.\"</p><p>\"Sooner or later, they will realize that you aren't a threat,\" Harper replied after listening to them talk for a while.</p><p>\"I doubt that,\" Shaundra replied. \"You don't know women. We are prone to jealousy and we're very vindictive.\"</p><p>\"Really?\" Yori asked, acting like he didn't believe her.</p><p>\"Yes, haven't you heard the old adage, &amp;#8222;hell hath no fury like a woman scorned'?\"</p><p>\"No, and I don't like it. Why is it used?\"</p><p>\"It's usually used when a man breaks the heart of the woman he loves.\"</p><p>\"Oh, oh, Yori,\" Satoshi teased. \"You're going to be in so much trouble with Amaya.\"</p><p>Yori feigned indifference. \"Amaya is not the vindictive type. Why would you think she would do something to harm me? We've been friends for years.\"</p><p>\"Has another woman come between you before?\"</p><p>Yori stared at him with eyes that just wanted to kill.</p><p>\"Let me rephrase that. You better watch your back.\"</p><p>Ichiro squeezed her hand. \"He'll be all right as long as I'm by your side.\"</p><p>The look Yori gave him could have soured milk.</p><p>Shaundra winked at Yori, forcing a smile out of him. \"Don't worry, Yori. I won't let her get to you.\"</p><p>Takumijo was right. Osaka was very beautiful with lots of tall buildings similar to Tokyo, but with less people milling about. Aomori didn't exactly live in town. They lived in an area called Sumiyoshi, a rural ward that reminded her of down south in places like Mississippi and Alabama. The hotel Kenshin took her and Harper to was located just down the road from where the band members stayed. Ichiro offered to give her his room at their home, but Shaundra politely declined for all the obvious and right reasons. After an exhilarating nap, Shaundra got dressed, met up with Harper in the lobby and then went outside to wait on Kenshin to take them to Aomori's place for dinner.</p><p>Kenshin arrived and she and Harper climbed inside a utility vehicle this time, which she thought made sense since the band lived nearby. He drove away from the hotel and down a long highway road for about ten minutes, turning onto a dirt road. The house sat behind a secured gate manned by two guards. The gate opened and Kenshin drove up to a large farm house. There were lush lawns, a little bonsai tree, and on the front door was big letter A.</p><p>Harper got out of the car, helped her out and then Kenshin drove the car around to the side to park. She followed him up the stairs and waited while he knocked. A few minutes later, Yori appeared and welcomed them in.</p><p>In typical Japanese fashion, she and Harper removed their shoes and put on slippers that Yori provided them. They followed him through the foyer. The house was immaculately clean, she discovered, as she peeked into rooms with modern furniture and brightly painted walls.</p><p>The tantalizing aroma of food greeted her somewhere in the middle of the house.</p><p>\"Ichiro has been busy in the kitchen all evening,\" Yori explained. \"He made us stop at the store so he could have all the right ingredients.\" He escorted them to the back of the house where they found Satoshi and Takumijo huddled around a video game while Masaaki watched a soccer game on a big screen television. They looked so much like a true family with Masaaki watching over them like a big brother. He turned off the game and walked over to greet them. Yori walked out of the room.</p><p>\"Welcome to Aomori's domain,\" he said. \"This is where they hang out when they are not rehearsing.\"</p><p>Satoshi said something to Takumijo in Japanese about the game they were playing and Takumijo responded very loudly. They shouted and Satoshi rolled around on the floor, obviously after winning the game.</p><p>\"Pay no attention to them,\" Masaaki said. \"This is how they unwind when they're home.\"</p><p>Shaundra remembered those days quite fondly when Clarence and Earl had been younger. They'd begun with Atari and, as far as she knew, the both still played video games when they weren't working.</p><p>\"Would you like to play?\" Satoshi asked Shaundra when they finally noticed her.</p><p>\"No thanks. I never developed a skill for such things. I have enough trouble manipulating my laptop and cell phone.\"</p><p>\"Dinner should be ready shortly,\" Masaaki said. \"Why don't you go say hello to Ichiro while I talk to Mr. Harper?\" He pointed in the direction of the kitchen and sent her off like a child while the men discussed business.</p><p>She found Ichiro washing dishes and wearing an apron. \"Hmm, just the way I like my men.\"</p><p>Ichiro spun around at the sound of her voice. He dried his hands on a red and white checkered towel and walked over and hugged her.</p><p>\"Welcome to our home.\"</p><p>\"What are you cooking?\" she asked once he released her. Something simmered in a big wok that sat on a countertop grill. All four burners of the conventional stove were set to low and there was also something baking in the oven.</p><p>\"Dinner,\" he answered sarcastically. He backed her to a red kitchen cabinet and lowered his lips to hers. Suddenly, the atmosphere around them got very hot. His tongue pushed past her lips and into her mouth. He tasted so sweet.</p><p>\"Get a room,\" Takumijo said as he entered the kitchen.</p><p>Ichiro broke the kiss. \"Mine is right upstairs,\" he said to Shaundra as they watched Takumijo get a glass from a cabinet, rinse it and then walk over to the refrigerator and pour some juice.</p><p>\"Nice move,\" he told Ichiro.</p><p>\"Forget both of you,\" Shaundra replied. \"There are too many people in this house to even attempt sneaking off to your bedroom.\"</p><p>\"We'll be real quiet,\" Ichiro told her.</p><p>\"Speak for yourself. You're twenty-five and hot. There's no way I'm going to be quiet.\"</p><p>Takumijo nearly choked on his juice. \"I think I better leave you two alone.\" He rinsed the glass and put it in the sink. \"How long before dinner is ready?\"</p><p>\"Fifteen minutes,\" Ichiro answered. \"Or maybe an hour if I can get Shaundra to change her mind and follow me upstairs.\"</p><p>\"Fifteen minutes,\" Shaundra answered. \"There will be no hanky-panky while these guys are in ear range.\"</p><p>Takumijo teased Ichiro about striking out and left.</p><p>\"Why are you torturing me?\" Ichiro asked her.</p><p>\"Patience is a virtue.\"</p><p>\"I've been patient for twenty-five years.\" He went over to the stove to check on the food. \"There's soda in the refrigerator.\"</p><p>Shaundra got herself a soda. \"Can I help you with something?\"</p><p>\"Have you ever prepared Japanese food before?\"</p><p>\"No,\" she replied.</p><p>\"Then no.\" He pointed to the table. \"Sit.\"</p><p>Shaundra sat down, content to watch the master chef at work. She was also content to watch his butt since he had his back to her most of the time.</p><p>This kitchen was similar to the one in Tokyo but just a different color scheme. This one was red and white with red curtains at the two big windows. Ichiro's cookware and small appliances matched. He looked so comfortable doing what he was doing. \"Do you prepare all the meals?\"</p><p>\"Yes, it is my job in the family. I prepare the meals and keep the house.\"</p><p>\"I like a man who knows his way around the kitchen,\" Shaundra replied honestly.</p><p>He turned to face her. \"You do not think it is girly?\"</p><p>\"Hell no. Someone has to cook and clean, and I don't think those other three would do a good job at it.\"</p><p>\"You got that right,\" he said going back to his cooking.</p><p>\"What made Mr. Niigata change his mind about allowing you to come home?\"</p><p>\"His wife,\" Satoshi answered. \"She missed him and demanded that he come home to see her before going to the United States. We were just going to hang around Tokyo for another two weeks practicing so in order to save face and his marriage, he came home.\"</p><p>Shaundra laughed. \"Well, I guess that explains who the boss in that family is.\"</p><p>\"Mrs. Niigata is a very nice woman, but she doesn't like to travel. Like you, she's afraid of flying.\"</p><p>\"Smart woman.\"</p><p>\"The food is ready,\" he announced.</p><p>Shaundra rose from the chair and held out both hands. \"Point me to the bathroom. I'd like to wash up first.\"</p><p>\"Do you want me to take you there? I have often fantasized about making love to a woman in that tiny room.\"</p><p>Her heart did a flip flop. \"No, just point it out,\" she said with a chuckle. He was so cute. After finding her way to the immaculately cleaned and pristine white bathroom, she found her way back to the dining room where everyone had gathered, including Kenshin. Masaaki pointed to a seat and Shaundra sat down. Ichiro wheeled in the food a few minutes later, winked at her and served them.</p><p>\"Let's go for a walk,\" Ichiro suggested after the meal ended and he allowed her to help him wash the dishes and put them away.</p><p>Some exercise was exactly what she needed to walk down the filling meal, and it would give the two of them time to be alone.</p><p>\"I'm taking Shaundra to see the gardens,\" Ichiro announced to the others who were back in the den watching the rest of the soccer game.</p><p>Masaaki waved them off and cheered for his team at the same time.</p><p>Shaundra followed him through the house and out of the front door.</p><p>Night had arrived and the stars looked close enough to touch as she gazed over the landscape of the rural community.</p><p>Ichiro took her hand and walked her down a path that led to a beautiful garden filled with mixed green foliage, lilies and irises. The setting was perfect for a romance novel.</p><p>\"Are these cherry blossom trees?\" Shaundra asked as they stopped for a moment.</p><p>\"Yes, and during the spring they are beautiful with little pink and white petals.\"</p><p>Shaundra signed contently. \"It's the first image I get when I think of Japan. Too bad it's not spring. I would love to see the bright colors.\"</p><p>He pulled her to him and kissed her gently. \"I can just imagine you with the petals falling in your hair. Would make a beautiful picture.\"</p><p>Shaundra smiled and snuggled into his warm arms. He skin smelled like cinnamon, probably from all the baking and cooking. She liked that.</p><p>\"Why, Ich, I think you're quite the romantic.\"</p><p>\"I speak the truth, beautiful lady. Let me show you something.\" He took her further into the grove of trees and then stopped by a tall one.</p><p>\"This is Aomori's tree. Mr. Niigata planted it when we first came to live here. He said it would grow as we grew.\"</p><p>Shaundra looked up. The tree stood above all the other trees. \"That would explain why all of you are over six feet tall.\" The area was tranquil, a lot like him.</p><p>He walked her over to an open field. \"This is where we play soccer.\"</p><p>Images of him as a little boy running around in the area made her happy. It made her heart feel good to know he wasn't too traumatized about being separated from his family. \"Are you good at sports?\"</p><p>\"Soccer is my favorite, but I'm a pretty fast runner too.\" His eyes lit up as he described matches between he and the others when they had been younger. \"Yori is an excellent swimmer.\" He pointed. \"We have a pool over on the other side of the farmhouse, but we hardly have time to use it anymore.\" They stopped at a bench and sat down. \"Sometimes, I come out here and sit down when I need a little peace and quiet.\"</p><p>Shaundra looked around. \"It is peaceful. It's a shame you don't get to take advantage of it more often.\" She inhaled. \"What was it like growing up here?\" She snuggled up in his arms.</p><p>\"Aren't you supposed to save those types of questions for the interview?\" Ichiro asked, kissing the top of her head.</p><p>\"The interview has already started. It began the minute I arrived in Osaka.\"</p><p>\"But you're not writing.\" She pointed to her forehead. \"Good memory. I'll jot it all down later.</p><p>Usually, paper and pen make people uncomfortable and less talkative.\"</p><p>She touched her heart. \"I'm also writing it here.\"</p><p>He chuckled warmly. \"To answer your questions, it was wonderful growing up here. Well, eventually it was after we got over being separated from our families at such a young age. We do everything together and everything is for the group.\"</p><p>\"Is it hard being the youngest?\"</p><p>\"Yes. In the beginning, it was pretty nice. They'd make sure I had enough to eat and would protect me when others made fun of me for not talking. Then, one morning, I woke up and I was just as tall as they were, but they still see me as a small child with a pretty face and a soft voice.</p><p>And they still think they need to protect me.\"</p><p>\"I can vouch that you're very much grown up,\" Shaundra replied.</p><p>Ichiro blushed so sweetly under the starry sky and moonlight.</p><p>\"You keep doing that and I'm going to forget all about all those people in the house and sneak you up those stairs and have my way with you.\"</p><p>He sighed. \"With my luck, we'd get caught.\"</p><p>Shaundra chuckled. \"You're probably right.\"</p><p>He pulled her onto his lap. \"Would you settle for a kiss?\"</p><p>Shaundra nodded. \"Oh, yes, please.\"</p><p>Yori watched as Ichiro gently brushed a lock of bang away from Shaundra's face and heard her giggle. The sound went straight to his heart.</p><p>\"What are you watching?\" Satoshi asked as he approached.</p><p>\"Ichiro,\" Yori announced. He pointed. \"He's over there on the bench with Shaundra.\"</p><p>\"When are you going to give this up?\"</p><p>\"Don't think I haven't tried. I keep trying to walk away and get her out of my system. I was brought up to do the right thing, and by that, I mean marry the girl I'm engaged to. But the harder I try to convince myself to do the right thing, I see her smiling face and hear that husky deep voice.\"</p><p>Satoshi leaned against the tree Yori hid behind. \"Maybe inviting her to Osaka was not one of Mr. Niigata's most brilliant ideas.\"</p><p>Yori walked away from the tree and Satoshi followed. \"Maybe not, but we'll have to make the best of it.\"</p><p>\"What does Amaya think about her being here in Osaka?\"</p><p>\"I haven't told her yet. In fact, Amaya does not know I have returned.</p><p>I thought I should take this opportunity to make a decision about my future.\"</p><p>\"The answer is simple...marry Amaya. Shaundra will be gone soon and nothing but a sweet memory. There are too many obstacles in your way preventing you from having a future with her. Not to mention the fact that her life would always been in danger.\"</p><p>\"You're right. I got a very nasty fan email yesterday. The writer threatened to kill her if I didn't break up with her.\"</p><p>Satoshi gasped. \"What did you do?\"</p><p>\"I wrote back that there was no relationship and then gave it to Masaaki to handle.\"</p><p>They arrived back at the front porch and sat down. \"Do you think that Ichiro is receiving similar threats?\"</p><p>\"It's possible since they attended the concert and the after-party together. And who knows who saw them together the night he snuck away with her on their first date. But you know how he is. He likes to keep things to himself.\"</p><p>\"We both know that something like this is too much for him to handle.\"</p><p>\"I know,\" Yori replied. \"But until he's ready to share it with us, there's nothing much we can do.\"</p><p>\"You are the leader. Talk to him.\"</p><p>Ichiro and Shaundra approached. \"What are you two doing out here?\"</p><p>Ichiro asked.</p><p>\"Spying on you,\" Satoshi answered honestly with a little smile. He turned to Shaundra. \"Did you enjoy the tour?\"</p><p>\"Yes, it was very nice. You have a lovely place.\"</p><p>\"But you've only seen a small part of it. Ichiro needs to show you where we work and play.\"</p><p>\"I offered to show her my room, but she declined,\" Ichiro said with a little pout.</p><p>Yori cleared his throat as Satoshi laughed. \"Maybe she shouldn't have refused. It's the cleanest room and the house and has the loveliest furniture.\"</p><p>Shaundra eyed him suspiciously. \"Why are you being so nice to Ichiro all of a sudden?\"</p><p>\"Ichiro is my little brother whether or not he believes it at the moment.</p><p>I like the effect you have on him. I've never seen him so happy.\"</p><p>\"Me too,\" Satoshi replied. He took her hand. \"Allow me to show you the rest of the place while the two of them try to patch things up.\"</p><p>Shaundra looked at Ichiro for consent and he nodded.</p><p>\"Just make sure you don't allow him to lock you in any room.\"</p><p>Satoshi took Shaundra up the stairs, leaving Ichiro alone with Yori.</p><p>Yori patted the porch for Ichiro to sit down. \"I know we've had our differences these last few weeks, but I need to talk to you about something.\"</p><p>\"Like what?\"</p><p>\"Shaundra.\"</p><p>\"What about her?\" Ichiro asked.</p><p>\"Have you been getting any threatening emails about her from fans?\"</p><p>Ichiro sighed. \"Yes, quite a few.\"</p><p>\"Did you respond?\"</p><p>\"No, I figured it wouldn't do any good. I forwarded them to Masaaki to turn over to the police.\"</p><p>\"Good, but that still doesn't help the situation. I need to ask you a favor that you probably won't like.\"</p><p>\"Can't be worse than getting punched in the face.\" Yori grimaced. \"I would say I'm sorry, but you had it coming to you.\"</p><p>\"So what do you want me to do?\"</p><p>\"Stop seeing her.\"</p><p>Ichiro opened his mouth but remained silent.</p><p>\"You're putting her in danger every time she's seen with you.\"</p><p>\"I can't just walk away and pretend I don't care.\"</p><p>\"She's returning to the United States in a few weeks so what's the difference if you do it now or then?\"</p><p>Ichiro did not answer. He just sat silent for several minutes as if contemplating an answer. \"I can't desert her.\"</p><p>\"You're going to get her hurt because of your selfishness.\"</p><p>\"I love her,\" Ichiro confessed. \"Do you truly know what it means to find someone who makes you complete?\"</p><p>Ichiro's admission startled him. He had no idea their relationship had progressed so far. \"How can you be in love with her? You barely know her.\"</p><p>\"The same way you do. The only difference is that I am free to pursue her.\"</p><p>Yori sighed. \"This has nothing to do about the way I feel about her.</p><p>How do you plan to protect her?\"</p><p>\"I could officially announce that we are dating. That would take the pressure off of you.\"</p><p>\"I'm not worried about me.\"</p><p>\"You should be. You are the leader of Aomori. We would be nothing without you. If they hate you, they hate us.\"</p><p>Twenty-five and already philosophical, Yori mused. And in love for the very first time. \"If you can't give her up then promise me that you won't take her off anywhere without the guards. Or the two of you can meet here.\"</p><p>\"There is no privacy here,\" Ichiro stated matter-of-factly.</p><p>\"What do you need privacy for?\"</p><p>Ichiro looked away.</p><p>\"Oh.\" Yori chuckled. \"Don't get your hopes up so high. Shaundra's an experienced woman who needs a real man to please her. If you know what I mean? And you're young and inexperienced with women.\"</p><p>Ichiro smirked. \"Just because I've never been with a woman before does not mean that I can't please her. So don't try to con me. I'm closer to bedding her than you are, and she thinks I'm cute.\"</p><p>\"Satoshi thinks you're cute too, but I think he has a better chance of bedding you than you have of bedding Shaundra.\"</p><p>Ichiro folded his arms in front of him. \"Manhood jokes are so below you, Yori, and besides, Satoshi is not my type.\"</p><p>Yori reached over and rustled his hair. \"Okay. You win. But don't say I didn't warn you.\" He rose and started up the stairs.</p><p>Ichiro jumped up quickly and nearly knocked him down getting through the door.</p><p>\"What's the hurry?\"</p><p>\"I forgot. She's alone with Satoshi. He's after her too.\"</p><p>Yori sighed deeply. It was lucky for them that Shaundra would be leaving in a couple of weeks or she'd be the death of them.</p><p>\"When did you first know that you wanted to be a singer?\" Shaundra asked Satoshi as the fiddled with one of the synthesizers in the practice room.</p><p>\"The first time I saw Michael Jackson perform,\" he replied, playing around with a beat. \"I think I might have been six or seven. I was over at a friend's house. Of course, it was an old broadcast, but I knew right then and there that I wanted to be an entertainer like him.\"</p><p>\"You're not saying that to score brownie points because I mentioned that I wanted to marry one of the Jackson Five when I was a girl?\"</p><p>Satoshi shook his head. \"No, I don't have to stoop that low to win a woman's affection.\"</p><p>It was too easy not to take the bait. \"What would you do to win a woman's affection?\"</p><p>Satoshi stopped. \"Is that one of your interview questions?\"</p><p>Shaundra shook her head. \"No, I'm just curious.\"</p><p>\"It depends on the woman that I'm trying to impress.\"</p><p>\"What about the young lady you took to the publishing company's party.\"</p><p>\"Oh, you mean Miko. She's a singer. We trained together for a while before making our debut. Mr. Niigata thought it might be cute to make us a duo.\"</p><p>\"What happened?\"</p><p>\"Aomori,\" he answered. \"Or, I should say Ichiro. Mr. Niigata heard him sing and then he changed his mind thinking a boy band would make a better package. So he snatched Takumijo and Yori from other groups because we were similar in height and appearance and formed Aomori.\"</p><p>\"Now back to Miko. Are the two of you still close? Is she your girlfriend?\"</p><p>\"No, I only invited her because she is a friend and was a part of a girl group that performed at our concert.\" He paused. \"You don't remember her?\"</p><p>Shaundra sat down on a seat next to him. \"Not really. I didn't pay too much attention to the girl group.\"</p><p>\"Why not?\" Satoshi asked, looking deeply into her eyes. \"They're a very good group.\"</p><p>Shaundra smirked. \"I'm not into girls.\"</p><p>\"I don't understand.\"</p><p>\"Why look at a bunch of girls when there are so many beautiful men around to gaze at?\"</p><p>Satoshi actually blushed.</p><p>\"Oh, not you too. You guys need to stop that blushing. It makes me feel like a dirty old woman when I pay you a compliment.\"</p><p>Satoshi raised an eyebrow. \"Are you?\"</p><p>\"Am I what?\"</p><p>\"A dirty old woman.\"</p><p>Shaundra slapped him on the arm. \"No, you're the first guys younger than me that I've taken an interest in.\"</p><p>Satoshi tried to duck the hit. \"Why?\"</p><p>\"Why what?\"</p><p>\"Why us?\"</p><p>Shaundra lowered her head. \"I have no idea. I saw a picture of you guys before I came to Japan and, I don't know, I think something inside of me woke up. I've never been attracted to men outside my own race or age group before.\"</p><p>He used his finger to lift her chin. \"You mean we turned you on?\"</p><p>She nodded. \"Totally,\" she said, going back to her questions.</p><p>\"But you can't date all of us.\"</p><p>\"I know that. Where did you grow up?\"</p><p>\"Are you trying to change the subject?\"</p><p>\"I'm supposed to be working, not fantasizing about what I would do if I was stuck on a deserted island with all four of you.\"</p><p>\"Okay, let me make this easy for you. I know you don't like me that way, and you can barely tolerate Takumijo, so that just leaves Yori and Ichiro. How do you really feel about Ichiro?\"</p><p>Shaundra sighed. \"He's so hot. I think I lose my fricking mind whenever I'm around him. He makes me feel so alive.\"</p><p>\"But he doesn't talk,\" Satoshi said sarcastically.</p><p>\"He does to me.\"</p><p>\"That's what bothers me. What is it about you that makes him animated? We've been trying to get him out of his shell for years. And what do you see in him that you don't see in the rest of us?\"</p><p>Shaundra smirked. She could not possibly tell him that.</p><p>Satoshi laughed. \"It's the hair, isn't it?\" He laughed. \"I knew it.</p><p>You've got a thing for Ichiro's hair.\"</p><p>\"So do you, and that's down right freaky.\"</p><p>\"Would you still desire him if he was bald?\"</p><p>Shaundra stopped and thought about it. \"That's a good question. Hell yeah.\"</p><p>Satoshi moved away from her. \"Why? What is it about him that makes you desire him so?\"</p><p>Shaundra shrugged her shoulders. \"I don't know. I think when two people click, it just happens.\"</p><p>\"What about Yori?\"</p><p>Satoshi would have to go there. \"What about him? \"What do you desire about him?\"</p><p>Shaundra thought about it. \"Nothing anymore. He's engaged.\"</p><p>\"I saw the two of you dancing in the lounge one night and then making out in the hall outside of your hotel room.\"</p><p>\"That seems like a million years ago. What do you want me to say?\"</p><p>\"Explain to me how you can be in love with both of them.\"</p><p>\"I'm not, okay?\" she said angrily. \"I only love one of them.\"</p><p>Two weeks went by in a blur. It was hard to believe that she would be returning to the United States in a couple of days, ending her stint as a journalist and returning back to her normal life.</p><p>\"This is a pretty damn good story,\" Harper said as they ate lunch in the hotel restaurant.</p><p>\"You say that like it is a surprise.\"</p><p>\"It's not. I knew that you were a journalist before you started writing novels. Why did you give it up?\"</p><p>\"I wanted a family,\" she confessed. \"The next thing I knew, I was too old to compete with all those youngsters that came after me.\"</p><p>Harper flipped the page and continued reading. \"You surprised me, though. I thought you would have written a bigger story on Ichiro.\"</p><p>\"That would be bias and I wanted to give all of them equal treatment.</p><p>Besides, Ich is a very private fellow and doesn't like all the hoopla.\"</p><p>Harper put the paper down and reached from her hand. He held on to it. \"How long are you going to play this little cougar game? You're going to break his heart when we leave the day after tomorrow.\"</p><p>\"Why does everyone think that I'm playing a game? Is it that hard to believe that someone my age can actually fall for someone his age?\"</p><p>\"Yes, it is. But I get it. You're in a foreign country and you want to sow a little wild oats before you're back in grandma mode.\"</p><p>Shaundra removed his hand from his grasp. That response was another reason she and Harper couldn't date. He lacked depth and understanding beyond his own needs.</p><p>\"And what about Yori? You have him so confused. Don't you know that you piss him off by messing with Ichiro when he's obviously the want you want.\"</p><p>\"You're confusing me. You think I'm leading Ichiro on, but you have a soft spot for Yori?\"</p><p>Harper shook his head. \"No, I think they'd both be better off without you.\"</p><p>Shaundra clenched her fists. That's a cruel thing to say.\"</p><p>\"Not cruel, honest. They're young, impressionable young men and they are best friends. What do you think is going to happen if you choose one of them over the other?\"</p><p>\"Nothing, because I'm not going to make that decision. Hopefully, things will return to normal between them once I leave.\"</p><p>He grabbed her by the shoulders and shook her gently. \"You can't believe that's how it's going to turn out.\"</p><p>Why was he getting all over her case? If she was such an evil person, she would have slept with both of them.</p><p>Harper released her. \"Maybe we shouldn't attend the party tomorrow night.\"</p><p>\"That would be rude. Mrs. Niigata has gone out of her way to do this in our honor. The least we can do is show up to say good-bye to everyone.\"</p><p>\"You are aware that the Saitama's are going to be there?\" Harper asked.</p><p>\"So what? There's nothing going on between me and Yori. As far as I'm concerned, he's made his decision. And like you said, I'm going home in two days so what difference does any of this make? It was fun, but now it's over.\"</p><p>\"Maybe you have yourself convinced of that. Maybe you think by walking away you can forget about them and make them forget about you.</p><p>I know what I saw in your eyes when you danced with Yori that night at that club in Shibuya, and I know what I saw in your eyes when you danced with Ichiro at the publishing party.\"</p><p>Shaundra's eyes misted. Harper was too smart for his own good. She turned away, refusing to let him see her one moment of weakness.</p><p>\"I'm sorry if I hurt you, Shaundra, but you do realize that this farce can't go on any longer? Let's face it. You're really in love with one of them and I know which one. Why don't you tell him?\"</p><p>\"I can't, Harper,\" Shaundra cried.</p><p>\"Why not?\"</p><p>\"Because it just wouldn't be right. Look, I know I've made a mess of this. I didn't come here looking for a relationship or to fall in love. But when I did, I fell hard, and for a while I thought I could pull this off. But reality has a way of setting in late at night when I'm alone. I cannot tell him because I don't want to see the hurt look on his face. Long distance relationships don't work and I can't ask him to give up his career and his citizenship and come back with me to the United States. That would be unfair.\" She sat down in a chair tired and exhausted.</p><p>\"What about you? Don't you deserve to be happy?\"</p><p>\"I'm fifty and he's twenty-five. I can't give him kids or speak Japanese. It just wouldn't be fair. I think it is best just to walk away friends and let him go on with his life. In just two days it will all be over and I'll be doped up and on my way back to New York.\"</p><p>Harper patted her hand. \"You'll always have me.\"</p><p>\"That's not very comforting, especially since all of this is your fault anyway.\"</p><p>Good old American soil. Shaundra didn't even bitch about all the traffic two days later as the cab drove her from the airport to her home in suburbia. New York hadn't changed much in two months. The air was still polluted and the people still walked around caring only about themselves.</p><p>It was late when she arrived and she was glad that she hadn't told her family when she would be arriving because she wasn't prepared for all the questions. Shaundra paid the taxi driver, rolled her cases up to the front door and left them there, deciding to check the mail before entering.</p><p>Usually, Tricia got the mail, but she had gone off for the weekend with some friends and would not be returning until much later.</p><p>Shaundra opened the mailbox, reached in and pulled out the mail. She turned, walked back to the door and put the key in the lock. She turned the knob and prepared to take the luggage inside. All of a sudden, there was a very loud explosion and then, everything went black.</p><p>\"Mama, can you hear me?\"</p><p>It sounded like Tricia.</p><p>\"Please, wake up.\"</p><p>Shaundra tried to open her eyes, but it made her head hurt.</p><p>\"She's semi-comatose,\" another voice said. \"It may take some time before the medication wears off or she regains consciousness.\"</p><p>Medication? Where the hell am I at? What was the last thing she remembered? Everything was fuzzy. She remembered the Niigata's party, Yori's strained facial expression as he and Amaya announced the date of their wedding, Ichiro's beautiful new song that he played for everyone there, and the good-byes.</p><p>\"Wake up, Mama.\"</p><p>I just need a little more rest. I'm so tired. Even if she wanted to wake up, she couldn't. Hmm, Yori's marriage announcement. She felt her chest rise and fall.</p><p>\"What's wrong with her?\" Tricia asked.</p><p>\"Her blood pressure just spiked. I'll give her something to stabilize it.\"</p><p>Wedding date, January 16, 2011. Yori had tried to make eye contact with her, but she'd ignored him. She wasn't going to give either him or Harper the pleasure of seeing her reaction.</p><p>Ichiro's reaction to her leaving had been calm, peaceful and serene, which was an interesting parting surprise for Aomori. They thought he would cry and act like a child. Hmm, nothing was ever as it seems. She tried to move around, but her body and head ached. I'm injured. How? The house! It blew up. Why? Oh lord...the fan girl contract. Stupid Harper.</p><p>She'd told him that women were vindictive. She dozed off again. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Yori yawned, wondering how much longer before their plane touched down in New York. They had been flying over twenty-four hours and he was tired of being in his seat, and Ichiro and Takumijo's constant prattle and excitement about being in the United States. Satoshi was sleeping in his seat oblivious to anything around him.</p><p>The time change also had him a bit loopy. He looked down at his watch. It was six in the morning.</p><p>\"We'll be there in less than an hour,\" Masaaki told him as he left his seat across the aisle and sat down next to him.</p><p>\"I'm beginning to hate flying. There's nothing for me to do.\"</p> <p>\"You should be sleeping.\"</p><p>\"I can't sleep. I'm too excited.\"</p><p>The pilot made an announcement about landing. \"We will be arriving in New York shortly. Please fasten your seatbelt and turn off all cell phones and laptop computers. It's a beautiful eighty degrees. Thanks for flying with us.\"</p><p>Yori looked out of the window. It was smoggy. Then he saw the tall buildings and skyscrapers. It reminded him of Japan. The plane descended and he felt the wheels drop. Moments later, they touched down.</p><p>Masaaki rose, walked over and shook Satoshi awake. He opened his eyes, yawned and then stretched. Takumijo's long legs appeared and then the rest of his body. Ichiro bounced up and down excitedly, waiting to get off the plane to see New York. Yori had his suspicions that Ichiro was anxious to get to the hotel room so he could telephone Shaundra, which he promised not to do. They had made a pact that no contact with her was better than getting involved with her again.</p> <p>It had been a week since they'd seen her and poor Ichiro was climbing the walls. The announcement of Yori's and Amaya's wedding date guaranteed that he would not have any contact with her. It was the hardest thing he ever had to do, but in the end, he could see that it was for the best.</p><p>Hopefully, he could get through the next week without making contact with her. They were just there to do a concert and then off on the next leg of their tour, New Orleans.</p><p>He rose, grabbed his carryon bag and followed the rest of the passengers off the plane.</p><p>There was a long wait at the Custom line. After he finished, he sat down in one of the seats and watched the American news on a television while waiting for the others to get through Customs.</p><p>\"Local news. Romance writer, Shaundra Love Morrison, is still recovering at a local hospital after an explosion rocked her home two days ago. Ms. Morrison, known for her erotic romance Temptation had just arrived home from a two month publicity tour in Japan.\"</p><p>Everything in Yori's mind moved in slow motion as the news reporter continued to talk. Satoshi walked over and sat down next to him. \"What's wrong? You look like you've seen a ghost.\"</p> <p>Yori pointed at the screen.</p><p>Satoshi looked down, listened and then gasped, \"No!\"</p><p>Yori tried to quiet him before he could draw attention over to them.</p><p>The gasp drew Ichiro over. \"What's going on?\"</p><p>\"It's Shaundra,\" Yori explained. \"She's in a hospital.\"</p><p>Ichiro placed his bag in a chair. \"What happened?\"</p><p>\"Someone blew up her house.\"</p><p>Ichiro bolted for the exit doors. Satoshi and Yori ran and tackled him down to the floor to stop him from going off like a lunatic.</p> <p>Tons of fans waited as they hurried through the terminal. Normally, the sight would have pleased him and the others. Yori didn't remember much of what happened, recalling only hearing his name shouted countless times and flashes from cameras in his face. A news reporter tried to get an interview, but the guards ended it so they could get out of the terminal as quickly as possible once the others traveling with them found out what had happened.</p><p>Masaaki made a couple of calls to find out more information while he got Mr. Niigata and the rest of the entourage out of the airport and into the cars without incident. He advised the drivers to take them immediately to the hotel so they could get the details from the police on what had happened before storming the hospital.</p><p>Ichiro rode in silence, staring out the window at the crowds of fans that lined the streets. He'd gone silent again and was probably thinking of a way to get to see Shaundra.</p><p>On the way to the hotel, Yori saw their images flashing on big screens in Times Square. On a normal day, he would have been impressed, but his mind kept darting back to the previous two months when Shaundra Morrison had first entered their lives.</p><p>Fans were camped out all along the roadway and in front of the hotel when they arrived, but unfortunately, none of them could stop to give autographs because Masaaki didn't think it was safe. He didn't know whether most of these fans knew about what was going on or what their connection to Shaundra was, but until they found out, everyone was a threat.</p><p>Tourists and employees gawked at them as they got their keys at the registration desk and walked through the lobby to the elevators. Masaaki's phone went off just as the doors to the elevator opened. \"Yes, thank you very much,\" he said after a few minutes of conversation with whoever was on the other line. \"She's at a nearby hospital and she is unconscious.</p><p>Luckily, she does not have any serious physical burns or lacerations.\"</p><p>Yori said a silent prayer.</p><p>Ichiro tried to exit the elevator, but Masaaki stopped him. \"It will do you no good to go off angry and half-cocked. Let's take our things up to our rooms and plot our strategy. The police seem to think that someone intentionally set a small bomb in her home. Thankfully, no one else was there at the time. It happened just after she arrived from the airport.\"</p><p>The elevator door opened and Aomori and their entourage found their rooms and put away their luggage. Less than an hour later, they were on their way to the hospital.</p><p>\"She still hasn't awakened,\" Charlotte told Harper as he entered the hospital room baring two cups of coffee. Charlotte had volunteered to sit with Shaundra while her kids went home to rest and to change. The youngest daughter, Tricia, hadn't left her mother's side since she'd come home and learned of the explosion. \"Every now and then I can see her eyes move under her lids like she's dreaming.\" She accepted the coffee from her boss.</p><p>\"I have some good news. The police have taken someone into custody.\"</p><p>\"That's great news,\" Charlotte exclaimed. \"Who is it?\"</p><p>\"You're not going to believe this. It is one of Shaundra's male fans.</p><p>He's like the president of her New York fan club.\"</p><p>\"Shaundra has male fans?\"</p><p>\"Apparently. He told them that he was upset because he saw that picture of her and Yori in the newspaper. He's built some fantasy in his head that she was meant for him. The police found email messages on a laptop they confiscated from her home and there was even letters from him in her hand when they found her after the explosion. She must have just taken them out of the mailbox.\"</p><p>\"You think she knew about the emails? She did have a laptop with her.\"</p><p>\"Honey, Shaundra has been too busy with others things to even read her email.\" He sighed. \"Funny, we suspected that she might be in some type of danger when Yori and the others started getting threatening fan mail once the magazine cover was published. Shaundra kept making jokes about Aomori's fan girls having a contract on her head. Who would have thought the threat would be this close to home.\"</p><p>\"Still doesn't mean the fan girls won't try anything. He just got to her first.\"</p><p>\"I'm way ahead of you. There are security posted on this floor and all around the hospital.\"</p><p>\"Speaking of Aomori. Are they as impressive in person as they are on that picture you gave me of them?\"</p><p>\"Shaundra seems to think so.\" He paused. \"By the way, they're giving a concert here in New York next weekend.\"</p><p>\"I wonder if they know that she's been injured?\" Charlotte asked.</p><p>Flowers and cards had been arriving from her fans, but nothing from Japan.</p><p>\"Probably not. They were supposed to leave Japan yesterday. I don't know if their plane has landed yet.\"</p><p>The door to the room opened and Charlotte gasped. \"I think they know.\"</p><p>Harper turned and nodded. \"It is them.\"</p><p>Charlotte recognized the first one in the door as Aomori's leader, Yori.</p><p>She sighed. The magazine cover did not do him justice. He was tall, gorgeous and had a very concerned look on his face. Three other young men came in the door behind him. Oh, my, they were all over six feet tall and dressed in various states of hip, popular fashion. One of them wore a pair of shades and a baseball cap. She thought it was the youngest member, Ichiro, but she couldn't be sure.</p><p>\"Where is she?\" Yori asked.</p><p>Harper and Charlotte moved so he could see her sleeping form on the bed. The one with the baseball cap rushed over, took one of Shaundra's hands and held it gently.</p><p>\"What happened?\" Yori asked.</p><p>Harper relayed the story as the other two members approached the bed and began speaking to each other in Japanese. Charlotte sat down in one of the chairs to give them room and to recover from the sight of them.</p><p>\"The police have arrested the president of one of Shaundra's fan clubs.\"</p><p>\"One of her fans?\" Yori asked. \"Not one of ours?\"</p><p>\"No, it was some man who just got pissed off when he saw you and her on Flowing's magazine cover. He has confessed to everything.\"</p><p>Yori moved over to the bed and took Shaundra's other hand while Satoshi and Takumijo moved to the foot of the bed.</p><p>\"That is no reason to blow up someone's house,\" Takumijo said to Charlotte.</p><p>Charlotte blushed from the attention. She moved her eyes away to gaze over at the scene unfolding at Shaundra's bedside. She knew about Shaundra's blossoming romance with Yori, but not with the one in the baseball cap, who was obviously trying to hide his identity. Satoshi walked over and watched the monitors that Shaundra was hooked up to, but Takumijo just stood there and looked at Shaundra with his shoulders slumped.</p><p>A nurse entered the room. \"Oh, I didn't know she had this much company. Some of you will have to leave while I check her vitals.\" She moved over and grabbed the blood pressure machine.</p><p>Satoshi and Takumijo meandered over to the door. The nurse gave them more than just a passing glance.</p><p>\"Come on,\" Harper told Charlotte.</p><p>Charlotte rose from the chair. \"What about those two?\"</p><p>\"It is going to be very hard to pry either of them from her side.\"</p><p>\"Huh?\"</p><p>\"I'll explain it to you in the waiting area.\"</p><p>Harper took her hand and led her out. His warm hand sent a jolt of adrenaline throughout her body.</p><p>The waiting area was filled with Japanese people, which she deduced had to be the rest of Aomori's entourage and their security guards. Nurses giggled and glanced over at Takumijo and Satoshi who smiled at them, but continued to talk with two of the other men. Harper walked her over to them.</p><p>\"Mr. Niigata and Mr. Fugimoto, this is my senior editor and Shaundra's best friend, Charlotte Martin.\"</p><p>The two men rose and bowed.</p><p>\"It is nice to meet you,\" the one named Fugimoto replied. \"But I wished it could have been under better circumstances.\"</p><p>\"It is nice to meet you too.\"</p><p>The elevator door opened and four African Americans got off and headed toward them.</p><p>\"Who is that?\" Satoshi asked.</p><p>\"Those are Shaundra's kids. I sent them home to rest, but apparently, they just didn't listen.\" The two girls approached first. The youngest one, Tricia, eyed Satoshi and then Takumijo, obviously recognizing them.</p><p>Juanda, the eldest daughter, spoke up. \"My name is Juanda Morrison and this is my sister Tricia.\" She pointed to the boys. \"Those are our brothers Clarence and Earl. You must be Aomori. No wonder my mother didn't want to come home.\"</p><p>Clarence and Earl waved, but they stayed off to the side talking to each other.</p><p>Takumijo towered over her. \"Yes, we are Aomori. What do you mean by that statement?\"</p><p>\"Look at you. You're tall, gorgeous and obviously virile. You must be Yori.\"</p><p>Takumijo shook his head. \"No, I'm Takumijo. Yori is at your mother's bedside.\"</p><p>Satoshi walked over to Tricia. \"My name is Satoshi Hayashi. Your mother has told me so much about you.\"</p><p>Tricia bowed to him. \"Yes, I'm Tricia, but my mother failed to tell me about you.\" She looked around. \"One of you is missing.\"</p><p>Satoshi nodded toward Shaundra's room. \"He's at her bedside along with Yori.\"</p><p>\"Both of them?\" Tricia asked.</p><p>The door opened and Yori came out. Harper introduced him to Shaundra's children.</p><p>\"Has there been any change?\" Charlotte asked, not knowing what to make of the entire situation.</p><p>\"Her blood pressure is still elevated,\" Yori replied.</p><p>Juanda walked up to Harper. \"She's probably been eating too much salt in Japan and not taking her medication.\"</p><p>\"She's on medication?\" Harper asked.</p><p>\"Yes,\" Juanda replied. \"You're her boss. You drug her halfway around the world and didn't ask if she had any health problems?\"</p><p>\"Never came up in the conversations,\" Harper said in his own defense.</p><p>Yori rolled his eyes at Harper.</p><p>Charlotte saw it. Apparently, there was a bit of friction between the two men.</p><p>\"You know what size underwear to buy her, but not the condition of her health?\"</p><p>Everyone turned to stare at Harper. \"I needed to order her clothes for the photo shoots. Anyway, you're her lover and you didn't know she had high blood pressure.\" They all stopped fussing long enough to watch a doctor enter Shaundra's room.</p><p>Charlotte felt her own pressure spike as Clarence and Earl walked over and sized Yori up. Shaundra's sons were tall, but they had nothing on Yori, who towered over them.</p><p>\"How old are you, dude?\" Clarence asked.</p><p>Yori looked down at him. Yori was taller, but Clarence had more muscle. \"Twenty-five. Why?\"</p><p>\"Shit, you're younger than I am.\"</p><p>\"And taller,\" Yori corrected.</p><p>\"Does my mother know your real age?\"</p><p>Yori nodded. \"It has come up in conversation from time to time, but she does not have a problem with it.\" He paused. \"And to set the record straight, I am not Shaundra's lover.\"</p><p>Earl stepped around Yori, looking him over. \"Juanda was trying to tell me that Mama was seeing someone in Japan, but I assumed it was him.\"</p><p>He pointed to Harper.</p><p>Harper shook his head. \"No, Shaundra and I are just friends.\"</p><p>Earl looked at Harper like he didn't believe him. \"None of my friends buy me underwear.\"</p><p>Charlotte figured it was time to break up the conversation before it got out of hand. The testosterone flying in the air made her dizzy. \"What good is it doing any of us, or her, which one of these guys she is dating? We should be praying for her recovery.\" Knowing that Shaundra hadn't given Harper the time of day pleased her immensely.</p><p>The door to Shaundra's room opened and the doctor and the nurse exited. The nurse walked over to them while the doctor went into the room next to Shaundra's.</p><p>\"How is our mother?\" Juanda asked.</p><p>\"Her vitals are stable,\" the nurse replied, still gazing at the three members of Aomori. \"And she's awake.\"</p><p>\"Can we see her?\" Tricia asked.</p><p>\"As soon as her fiance comes out.\"</p><p>Both sisters looked at each other. \"What fiance?\" Juanda asked. \"Is Donald here?\"</p><p>\"Who is Donald?\" Takumijo asked.</p><p>\"Shaundra's ex-boyfriend,\" Yori told him.</p><p>\"His name isn't Donald,\" the nurse said, looking down at her clipboard. \"His name is Ichiro Yoshida. He asked that all the medical bills be charged to him and he wants her to be moved to a more private room so she can rest.\" She smiled. \"He is so attentive. He hasn't left her side since I walked into the room.\"</p><p>\"Who the hell is Ichiro?\" Clarence asked as he gained control of the conversation.</p><p>Charlotte smirked. Shaundra had told her that her boys were overprotective.</p><p>The door to Shaundra's room opened again and the young Japanese man exited, minus the baseball cap and sunglasses. There was a congregation of gasps from the females in the waiting room. Both Tricia and Juanda stood star-struck.</p><p>\"That is Ichiro,\" Satoshi announced. \"Isn't he something?\"</p><p>\"He sure is,\" Charlotte replied breathlessly as the blue-eyed angel walked toward them. He was the loveliest man she'd ever laid eyes on.</p><p>She rose from her chair and stood next to Harper.</p><p>\"Stop staring,\" Harper told her.</p><p>\"Shaundra has awakened,\" Ichiro announced.</p><p>Charlotte trembled at the sound of his voice. She could see why Shaundra had chosen him, but was pissed because her best friend hadn't told her about their relationship. Maybe she was too embarrassed because he was so young. She looked him over. Pearly white skin, a perfect nose, beautiful blue eyes and full, pink lips. What beautiful babies the two of them would make if Shaundra was still fertile.</p><p>\"You must be her kids,\" he said to Juanda and the others. \"She's asking for you.\"</p><p>All four kids hurried into the room while Ichiro joined his friends.</p><p>\"Fiance?\" Takumijo asked.</p><p>Ichiro smiled. \"I proposed the moment she opened her eyes.\"</p><p>Takumijo punched him playfully on the arm. \"You sly dog.\"</p><p>Yori didn't appear to be too excited about the announcement. In fact, he looked like he was about to blow a gasket. \"I need coffee,\" he replied, and stormed out of the waiting room.</p><p>Charlotte raised an eyebrow. Huh, this is interesting. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Her children crowded on her bed like they had done when they'd been younger, kissing her and talking loudly at the same time. After a few minutes, they gave her time to breathe. The girls sat down in the available chairs while the boys remained standing.</p><p>\"How are you feeling?\" Clarence asked.</p><p>To look at him was like staring at a younger version of her late husband. He had really grown into a fine, responsible young man who only came to her occasionally for advice. \"I have a slight headache, but I guess it could be worse.\"</p><p>\"You were out for a couple of days. You had me worried. I can't ever remember you being sick before.\"</p> <p>She'd tried to shield them from everything when they were growing up and tried never to let them see her sad.</p><p>\"Do you remember what happened?\" Clarence asked \"I didn't at first, but then it all came crushing back a few minutes ago.\"</p><p>She paused. \"How is the house?\"</p><p>\"A mess,\" Tricia answered. \"The insurance man said it needs a complete makeover.\"</p><p>\"How much of it was destroyed?\"</p> <p>\"The first couple of rooms. The living room, downstairs bathroom, foyer and the formal dining room. Everything else downstairs is smoky and wet.\"</p><p>Shaundra grimaced. \"Is the upstairs ruined?\" All their baby pictures, books, diplomas and childhood memories were stored in chests in the attic.</p><p>\"No damage, but we can't return to the house. It's been declared unsafe.\"</p><p>\"Don't worry,\" Earl replied. \"You two can stay with me until the house is repaired.\" Earl reminded her of her father. It was good of him to offer, but no way. As for Tricia, she had plans to stay on campus anyway and school would be starting shortly. \"Thanks, but I know how young men need their space. I'll be okay.\"</p><p>\"How was Japan?\" Earl asked, changing the subject and probably trying to be nosey at the same time.</p><p>\"Japan was great. Tokyo is a bit busy, but I liked Osaka because it reminds me of down south. The place where I stayed had a homey atmosphere.\"</p> <p>\"You know that's not what he's asking,\" Juanda replied.</p><p>\"Oh,\" Shaundra replied. \"Well, that's a very interesting story that you won't be hearing any time soon.\"</p><p>Tricia giggled. \"Ichiro is so cute, and did you see his eyes? They're blue.\"</p><p>Shaundra nodded.</p><p>\"Is Satoshi engaged?\"</p><p>Shaundra eyed her youngest daughter curiously. \"No, why?\"</p><p>\"Just asking.\"</p><p>Shaundra chuckled through the pain. \"Girl, you're more like me than you know.\"</p> <p>\"I still think they look like a bunch of girls,\" Juanda replied. \"But they're definitely men. Did you see the size of their hands and feet?\"</p><p>\"Huge,\" Tricia said, still giggling.</p><p>\"Yes, they are,\" Shaundra agreed.</p><p>\"Is it true that you're engaged?\" Clarence asked.</p><p>Shaundra raised her left hand, showing them the engagement ring she'd received earlier. \"I think I am. I can't be sure. I woke up and saw an angel smiling down on me. I think he proposed.\"</p><p>\"But, Mama, he's younger than I am,\" Clarence argued.</p><p>\"That just means the two of you will have things in common. Would you rather go to a ball game with an older step-father or one who can keep up with you?\"</p><p>\"How's he in bed?\" Juanda asked as if the two of them we girlfriends instead of mother and daughter.</p><p>\"I have no idea.\" That girl always made her head ache with her questions.</p><p>All four kids looked at her like she'd lost her mind.</p><p>\"What?\" Juanda asked. \"You mean the two of you never slept together?\"</p><p>\"No,\" Shaundra answered.</p><p>\"For some reason, I believe you,\" Juanda replied. \"But I don't know why because, if I were you, I'd have been all over him.\"</p><p>Shaundra chuckled. The things that came out of that girl's mouth.</p><p>\"What about Yori?\" Juanda asked. \"Don't think I was going to pass up this opportunity to ask about him. You think I don't remember you stepping out with him when you arrived in Tokyo.\"</p><p>Shaundra rubbed her head. \"Why do you insist in making me out to be a hoochie? I haven't slept with Yori either.\" \"What's wrong with them? Are they gay?\"</p><p>\"No, Juanda, they aren't gay.\"</p><p>\"You two looked pretty chummy to me on YouTube.\"</p><p>\"Looks can be deceiving. Why didn't you believe me before when I told you that nothing was going on between me and him?\" She didn't miss the look Tricia gave her. Baby girl could read her inside and out.</p><p>The door to her room opened and Yori entered.</p><p>\"Come on in and meet my kids.\"</p><p>\"We've already met,\" he said rudely. \"Can we talk?\"</p><p>The boys moved away from the bed and pulled their puzzled-faced sisters out of the room behind them.</p><p>\"Where's Ich?\"</p><p>\"Out in the waiting area talking with Mr. Niigata and Masaaki.\" He walked over to the bed, took her hand and kissed it like he had that night in the hallway outside her hotel room. Passion flowed through her body. If only things had been different. \"How are you feeling? You gave me quite the scare.\" He stood at the side of her bed.</p><p>\"I'm okay. I just have a slight headache.\"</p><p>\"You were lucky to survive such an explosion without a scar.\" He paused, still holding her hand. \"The police have the culprit in custody. It was a male fan of yours. He's the president of your New York fan club.\"</p><p>Shaundra groaned. \"Isn't that something? I thought for sure one of your fan girls decided to take me out.\" She chuckled weakly. \"They do love them some Yori.\"</p><p>\"Do you?\" Yori asked.</p><p>Shaundra didn't answer. She just raised her hand and showed him her engagement ring. He let go of her other hand.</p><p>\"Ichiro?\"</p><p>Shaundra nodded. \"I knew you were going to go there when you found out.\"</p><p>He moved away from the bed and paced the floor in the room. \"Damn right. What did you expect me to do when I heard the news?\"</p><p>\"Why does it matter so much to you? In a couple of months, you will be a married man.\" The pacing made her dizzy.</p><p>He ran his fingers through his hair, mussing up his bangs. \"Did you accept his proposal because of that? We could have made some kind of arrangement.\"</p><p>Shaundra's head popped up from the pillow. \"What? You think I wanted to be your mistress?\"</p><p>Yori stopped pacing. \"That was an option.\"</p><p>\"Not for me. I don't share men.\"</p><p>He turned back toward her. \"But Ichiro is a child.\"</p><p>\"He's six months younger than Satoshi.\"</p><p>He moved to the foot of the bed. \"But he's never been with a woman before.\"</p><p>Shaundra smirked. \"Yes, I know.\" Ichiro was a glorified virgin. The though made her feel all giggly inside.</p><p>\"I hope that's not the reason you accepted. He won't be able to satisfy you.\"</p><p>Shaundra raised up slightly in the bed. \"How do you know that?\"</p><p>He wiggled the middle finger of his right hand at her.</p><p>Shaundra rolled her eyes at him. \"Leave it to you to remember that.</p><p>No, I didn't accept his proposal because he was a virgin and I'm a cougar.</p><p>But I will admit, it was a bargaining chip.\"</p><p>Yori sat down in a chair. \"I thought I made a wise decision by setting that wedding date. I thought I could buy us more time and keep you safe from all those who threatened you. I didn't even mind Ichiro dating you after a while. I knew he wouldn't let anything happen to you and he would be there for you when I couldn't be.\" He paused. \"But if I knew the little fairy would have taken advantage of the situation, I would have kicked his ass. If I had only known...\"</p><p>\"What? What would you have done differently, and don't call him a fairy.\"</p><p>\"How can you marry him when we feel the way we feel toward each other? I've loved you from the moment you fell into my arms in that hotel lobby on the night you arrived in Tokyo.\"</p><p>\"Don't do this, Yori. It's too hard. I've already made my decision.\"</p><p>\"The wrong one. You chose Ichiro. I think that's a worse decision than the one I made. I could have accepted it, though, had it been Satoshi. He's wanted you from the first night he met you in that hotel lounge.\"</p><p>\"What would you have done if I had chosen Takumijo?\"</p><p>\"That never would have happened. You're not Takumijo's type.\"</p><p>\"What do you mean by that?\"</p><p>\"Never mind, this isn't about him.\"</p><p>\"What is wrong with Ichiro? He's good, kind and the most generous person I know.\"</p><p>\"That's the problem. He's too perfect. He's the only other man in the world who makes your eyes light up when he walks into the room. Your eyes used to do that for me until you met him.\"</p><p>It was true. \"No one is perfect, Yori. Not even Ichiro.\"</p><p>\"Can you honestly tell me that you love him?\"</p><p>\"No, I love you.\"</p><p>\"See, I thought so.\"</p><p>\"But I am in love with Ichiro.\"</p><p>The loud chuckle behind them made Yori turn his head around to see who it had come from. Ichiro stood in the doorway. \"Told you, Yori.\"</p><p>Yori rose. \"You were right. I just had to make sure.\" He and Ichiro hugged. \"Take good care of her.\"</p><p>\"I will,\" Ichiro replied.</p><p>Yori left, leaving her alone with her fiance. \"What was that all about?\"</p><p>Ichiro walked over to the bed and pressed a kiss to her forehead. He smelled like sunshine and reminded her of that starry Osaka night when she'd realized that she was in love with him. When he kissed her with the scent of cinnamon on his skin that made her feel warm and comforted like the way she used to feel as a child growing up in the south in her grandmother's kitchen. He felt like family.</p><p>\"He just gave me his blessing.\"</p><p>\"I don't understand.\"</p><p>\"It's a man thing. In Yori's eyes, I am now a man and he doesn't have to look after me anymore.\"</p><p>Shaundra smirked. In her eyes, he had always been a man. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\"Don't cry,\" Ichiro said as he and Shaundra walked around assaying the damage to her home.</p><p>Shaundra wiped her eyes. \"What am I supposed to do? I've lived in this house for twenty years.\" There were so many memories of the kids growing up there.</p><p>\"Sell it.\"</p><p>\"And do what?\" she asked.</p> <p>\"Move to Japan.\"</p><p>Shaundra laughed. \"You can't be serious.\"</p><p>\"Oh, but I am,\" he said taking her arm and leading her out to what was left of the front porch. \"I thought that was a given when you accepted my proposal.\"</p><p>\"That thought had crossed my mind, but I was still a bit groggy from the medication.\"</p><p>\"It would be perfect. You could still write and I could still perform with Aomori.\"</p> <p>Shaundra stopped walking and unwound herself out of his arms.</p><p>\"Where would we stay, and don't say the farmhouse.\"</p><p>\"Why not? Yori will be moving out shortly, and Satoshi and Takumijo have always wanted their own place. We've lived together for fifteen years and now it's time for us to part. The farmhouse would be perfect for when your grandchildren visit.\"</p><p>The fact she could not give him children still pained her.</p><p>Her pulled her to him. \"You know I don't care about that,\" he said as if reading her mind.</p><p>Shaundra lowered her head. \"But you might change your mind in the future.\"</p> <p>\"I don't think so. I want to selfishly have you to myself. But if you really must have a baby in the house, there are other alternatives like adoption and surrogacy. As for me, I am okay about not over populating Japan. I have an older brother and two sisters to carry on the family genes.\"</p><p>Hell no she didn't want to raise any more children. \"You have siblings? How come you never told me that? I thought you were an only child.\"</p><p>\"Yes, I have siblings. My two sisters are younger than me.\"</p><p>They began walking again. \"Have you discussed any of this with them?\"</p><p>\"Yes, and they can't wait to meet you. My brother is going to manage my restaurant until I am able to take over and my sisters have agreed to act as hostess and waitress. They've always wanted an older sister.\"</p><p>\"I'm old enough to be their mother. I don't think they will like hanging out with me.\"</p><p>\"Of course they will,\" he said, kissing her on the forehead. \"They will love you just as much as I do.\"</p><p>\"You have this all mapped out. Most young men your age don't give a damn about their futures.\"</p> <p>\"Masaaki and Mr. Niigata made sure of that. They knew I wanted to be a chef since I was a child so they suggested that all of us take business classes while we were in college. Just made sense to get a business degree since I plan to open up a chain of restaurants before I'm thirty.\"</p><p>They walked away from the damaged house and got back into the limousine. The security guard followed them inside. Shaundra didn't even mind them being there since she wasn't sure she was safe from Aomori's fans, or her own.</p><p>\"My kids are going to have a fit when they find out that I'll be moving to Japan.\"</p><p>\"They'll get over it,\" Ichiro assured her. \"You've done your job. It's time to cut the apron strings and have a life. So it's settled. You will return with me to Osaka once our tour is over.\"</p><p>\"That still leaves me without a place to stay until then. I can't keep renting a hotel room.\"</p><p>\"Masaaki is working on that. After all, we're going to need a place to stay here once we're married. Possibly a condo so we'll have it when we fly back to New York for concerts and to visit.\"</p><p>Shaundra gulped. \"Fly?\"</p><p>\"Yes, I thought you'd gotten over your fear.\"</p><p>\"Nope. I came back here high on Valium. That's probably what saved me from being harmed in the explosion.\"</p><p>Ichiro patted her hand. \"You'll get used to it. We have many states to hit before our tour is over.\"</p><p>\"You expect me to go on tour with you?\"</p><p>\"But of course. We'll be on our honeymoon.\"</p><p>What in the hell is he talking about? They wouldn't be married for a while.</p><p>\"The wedding will be next weekend. It has all been arranged. It will take place before our concert, with the reception following at the after- concert party.\"</p><p>\"This weekend? Are you crazy? That doesn't give me much time to get ready. There are people who need to be invited.\"</p><p>\"You've been married before. Nothing has changed. Everyone who needs to be invited has been invited. The invitations went out this morning with the concert tickets.\"</p><p>\"What about my mother? I might want her to be there.\"</p><p>\"She sends her love, but says she's not getting on a plane for you or anyone else. Hmm, now I see where you get your fear from.\"</p><p>\"Why so soon?\"</p><p>\"Because I love you and I don't want to wait forever to make love to you.\"</p><p>\"If that's the reason you're in a hurry, you do have a hotel room.\"</p><p>Ichiro looked over at her. \"I've waited this long. I can wait one more week.\"</p><p>One week, darn. She hoped she could hold out that long.</p><p>Shaundra didn't think that it was possible to be so happy.</p><p>\"Damn, this place is packed,\" Juanda said as she and her husband found their seats in the N. Y. Juanda had rounded her up a babysitter for the evening so they could attend the wedding and the concert.</p><p>\"You should have seen the people at the Tokyo Dome. It was filled wall to wall with screaming fans,\" Shaundra explained.</p><p>Clarence and Earl slipped into the seats next to her, followed by Harper, Charlotte, Dorothy, Jackson, Riley, Kenshin, and Mr. Niigata.</p><p>Tricia sat closer to the front with her friends in order to gawk at Satoshi.</p><p>Three groups performed first including Satoshi's friends in the all-girl group, which Shaundra forced herself to pay attention to. They were really good, but not as good as the men. Aomori took the stage around nine that night wearing black suits, black ties and white shirts. Each suit jacket was cut just a bit different to show off some wonderful feature of its wearer.</p><p>Ichiro wore a black hat that covered all that long hair and a pair of sunglasses to shield those baby blues from the glaring light. They sang a couple of fast songs, which made their fans sing along to and clap. Juanda was impressed by their dancing styles and surprised that Takumijo had choreographed every step. \"He's not just big, he's talented,\" Shaundra told her.</p><p>Both Satoshi and Yori sang ballads and then the group stopped to perform some skits that required the audience participation. They disappeared to do a wardrobe change, and then Ichiro returned alone, dressed in a white tuxedo. The young women in the audience went wild after he had let down his jet black hair. He sat down at the piano and a spotlight beamed down directly on him. \"This is a new song I wrote for someone special in the audience.\"</p><p>The screaming crowd went wild with each young woman hoping that he meant her.</p><p>\"It's called Cherry Blossom.\" He began to play. The introduction music was lovely. He started singing and the sound and words sent chills through her body. His sexy tenor voice sang the love song from the heart.</p><p>At the end, he said, \"To my lovely bride, Shaundra. I love you.\"</p><p>The crowd continued to scream and applaud. They shouted his name.</p><p>Juanda squeezed her hand. \"That pretty boy really does love you.\"</p><p>The lights came up a little and the rest of Aomori returned to perform Romanticism. An hour later, she and Ichiro danced their wedding dance to Barry White's I've Found Someone.</p><p>The only thing that would stop them this time would be if one of them had a heart attack. The clothes fell away from their bodies as they ran into the honeymoon suite. They were down to their underwear by the time they reached the bed.</p><p>Shaundra reached up and slid Ichiro's briefs down his hips, revealing a very healthy erection. She made him sit down on the side of the bed, unbuttoned her bra, took it off and tossed it to the floor. She reached up and removed the band from his hair and released it. It floated down in waves around his shoulders and down his back. Shaundra buried her fingers into it. Satoshi was so right. It was indeed soft, and the best thing she'd ever felt.</p><p>Ichiro pressed his face into her abdomen and kissed her belly right below her navel. The next thing she knew, she felt his hand move up to the waistband of her panties and slide them down her hips to the floor.</p><p>Shaundra removed them and then stepped back so he could get a good look at his first naked woman.</p><p>\"Your body is lovely.\"</p><p>\"Thank you.\" She approached the bed. \"Give me what I want, Mr.</p><p>Yoshida. Let me see that hair against my pillow.\"</p><p>Ichiro scooted up to the pillow and lay down. The hair spread out like one of his geisha fans.</p><p>\"Damn, it doesn't get any better than this,\" Shaundra replied as she climbed up on the bed and joined him. She went to work, making a mess of him all night long. </p> </body></html>"]
