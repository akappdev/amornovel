Whoever is there knows damn well that I\u2019m in here. I force my muscles to move, to stretch, as I stand and get out of the tub. Taking the only thing that I can use as a weapon, I grab a can of hairspray, intending to spray and smack the intruder with the can, if I get that lucky.</p><p>The shadow shifts and the floorboards creak. The nails jiggle the knob once more and then are dragged down the door in one slow sweeping motion. My heart climbs into my throat as my pulse goes into heart failure territory. Every inch of my body is shivering, but it has nothing to do with being cold. I want to grab the towel and wrap it around my body, but I\u2019m too afraid to turn away from the door. I stand there after I step out of the tub, letting the water roll off me and onto the floor. Puddles form under my feet. My fingers clutch the can of hairspray tighter. I shake it and pull the cap off, putting it down softly on the counter. My nerves are shot to hell. I know someone is on the other side of the door and for whatever reason, they haven\u2019t opened it yet.</p><p>I reach my hand slowly toward the knob, ignoring how my fingers shake, as I lift the can of hairspray in my other hand. My breath catches in my throat. My fingers touch the cold metal knob. Every last breath of air is crushed out of me. I stare, unblinking, ready to fight whatever assailant lies on the other side.</p> <p>Without warning, I yank the door open. I scream and spray, practically dancing in fear, trying to see who was waiting on the other side. After a second, I get enough of my brains back to realize that no one is at eye level. My gaze falls to the floor and I scream. A raccoon the size of a dog is hissing at me, and looks like it\u2019s ready to attack.</p><p>\u201cAwh, what the hell, what the hell, what the hell!\u201d I scream\u2014almost sing\u2014as I act without thinking and jump over it. When I leap over the thing\u2019s head, it twists to look at me. It must think I\u2019m attacking, because it fights back. It rears up on its hind legs when I\u2019m airborne over its body. My foot connects with the side of its head and the raccoon goes flying backwards into the bath, as I fall on the floor. It splashes in the tub, while making the most ear-piercing sounds I\u2019ve ever heard. The animal clings to the side of the tub, trying to climb out, soaked. And completely pissed. I gawk at it for a second and then scramble my naked butt across the hall and go running into the living room. The insane animal runs like I\u2019m the one attacking. It darts past me, soaking wet, and climbs our bookcases. The entire time, I\u2019m screaming like someone is killing me.</p><p>When the knock at the door comes, I throw it open to see the eighteen-year-old high school kid that lives next door. His gaze is downcast at first and he starts to ask, \u201cI heard yelling and wanted to make sure...\u201d His voice cuts off as he stares at me wide-eyed.</p><p>The blast of fresh air and James\u2019 unblinking brown eyes remind me that I\u2019m naked. I turn and snatch at a sweater that\u2019s hanging by the door and wrap it around me as quickly as possible. I slam the door shut behind James. Responding to him, I say, \u201cNo! That thing attacked me!\u201d I\u2019m breathing hard and can\u2019t catch my breath. My pulse won\u2019t slow and James looks like his brain melted. I blink at him as I tug the sweater tighter around my shoulders. The bottom of my ass is hanging out. I pull the sweater down, but then my boobs are hanging out. Hysterical sobs start to bubble up my throat and James seems to remember that I\u2019m a real person.</p><p>I\u2019m pointing at the raccoon. It\u2019s perched on top of the bookcase with its hackles raised, hissing at us. \u201cThat thing broke in. I thought....I thought,\u201d I blubber, motioning at it, \u201cit was a\u2014\u201d</p> <p>James finally snaps out of it. He says calmly, \u201cIt\u2019s fine, Miss Lamore. He\u2019s just spooked.\u201d James looks around and asks, \u201cHow\u2019d he get in here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have no clue,\u201d I say, my voice shaking, my entire body billowing like a reed in a breeze. I shiver and I can\u2019t stop.</p><p>James\u2019 eyes flick between me and the massive rodent snarling on my top shelf. Its little black muzzle looks like it\u2019ll rip my face off if I step closer. James seems to decide something and steps towards it. I grab his shoulder, and scold him like he\u2019s five, \u201cStay away from that thing! It\u2019s crazy.\u201d</p><p>James smiles and shakes his head. \u201cHe\u2019s just spooked.\u201d Ignoring me, James steps toward the animal, making cooing sounds. The raccoon stops hissing, but still looks mortified. It doesn\u2019t move. After a moment, James turns to ask, \u201cDo you have an apple or something?\u201d</p><p>Nodding, I go to the kitchen to grab one and return, giving it to the kid. \u201cDon\u2019t let it bite you. Your mother is going to kill me as it is.\u201d</p><p>James lifts the apple in the air. He uses a pocket knife to cut small pieces off. James can barely get the first few pieces to the psychotic rodent, but eventually its stomach overpowers its fear, and the giant fur ball climbs down. James opens the front door and throws the remains of the apple outside. The raccoon runs after it, and bounds down the front steps. I slam the door shut, and lean against it, splaying my fingers against the metal. I close my eyes, and tilt my head back. A major freak out is building inside of me.</p> <p>James clears his throat and seems to look anywhere but at me. \u201cIt looks like he got in through the chimney.\u201d The kid points at the old fireplace and the knocked over candles that had been on the hearth. \u201cI can tell the landlord to fix the trap, and you should board that up. I have no idea how he squeezed his way down. Usually squirrels are an issue, not raccoons.\u201d</p><p>I realize he\u2019s talking, and blink. Looking at him, I shake my head, saying, \u201cNo, I\u2019ll tell the landlord about it. You\u2019ve been enough help.\u201d My face is burning. I think I was running around naked in front of this kid for way longer than I should have. I bite my bottom lip to keep it from trembling. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>He smiles awkwardly at me and says, \u201cIt was my pleasure.\u201d James smirks and then disappears through the door. I push it shut behind him.</p><p>Then, I plaster my hands to my face and fall to the floor and cry. I cry because my emotions are so tangled that I can\u2019t tell which way is up. I thought someone was there, that the person who was following me was ready to butcher my body and hide me under the floorboards, and my only defense was a can of hairspray. I\u2019m pathetic. No one\u2019s been following me. I let me mind runaway with brains.</p><p>CHAPTER 2</p><p>After I pull myself together, I head back to my room to change. Something feels off, but I can\u2019t tell what. I glance around and everything looks the same. It\u2019s just the raccoon, I think to myself. He probably got in here and moved some things. Ignoring the ice swirling in my stomach, I go to my laundry basket and heft it onto the bed. I\u2019m still trying to find my favorite pair of panties. I dig through the basket, but they don\u2019t turn up. The dryer doesn\u2019t eat expensive panties. I\u2019m usually so careful with them and I cannot imagine what I\u2019ve done with them.</p><p>Annoyed, I suck in a gasp of air and sit down hard on the bed, letting the cold, damp, sweater I\u2019m wearing to slouch down a little bit. The window is closed. Sunlight pours into the room through the slats in the mini blinds. I pull my hair out of the towel. I take a second to figure out what else to wear, when I look up.</p><p>Across the room is my dresser. It\u2019s old, a hand-me-down, and the top is covered in make-up, blush brushes, and lip sticks that I didn\u2019t put away. A square mirror with a chipped edge hangs above the dresser. Scrawled across the glass in bright red lipstick is a single word.</p> <p>WHORE.</p><p>Every nerve in my body is already frayed. Seeing this makes me come apart. I feel myself unraveling bit by bit and I can\u2019t stop it. My heart climbs into my throat, pounding wildly. My jaw drops open as I stand and walk toward the piece of glass.</p><p>I glance around again, but no one is here. I\u2019m alone. There is no other sign that someone has been in my room. I touch my fingers to the cold pane, touching the W with my index finger. It\u2019s written in lipstick, my favorite cherry red lipstick. It\u2019s the one that I like to wear on dates. Shaking, I yank my hand back from the mirror like I\u2019ve been burned.</p><p>Someone was here. It wasn\u2019t my imagination. It wasn\u2019t a raccoon that freaked me out. Someone had stood outside my bathroom door and then come in here.</p><p>Frantic, I dress, pulling on jeans and a tank top. Fear slices me into little bits, making my mind freeze up and not work. The only thing I can think is to ask James if he saw someone leave my apartment. I walk outside, run next door, and bang on his front door too hard. His mother appears. She has bright red hair that\u2019s pulled away from her face with combs. A spattering of freckles line her pale cheeks. Her name is Gabby.</p><p>\u201cIs James around?\u201d I ask, breathing I little too hard.</p><p>Gabby\u2019s arms fold over her chest, \u201cWhat\u2019d he do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d I shake my head. \u201cWell, actually, he helped me get a raccoon out of my apartment earlier. I wanted to ask him if he saw something.\u201d</p><p>The square of Gabby\u2019s shoulders soften and she turns, bellowing for her son over her shoulder. \u201cThank God that\u2019s all you had to say. I thought you were going to tell me he knocked you up or something.\u201d She shakes her head and turns away from the door, leaving me on the porch alone.</p><p>I ignore her statement, which should have irked me, and glance up and down the street. It\u2019s filled with people. No raccoons. No one wearing a sign that says STALKER.</p><p>James appears at the door. I step back to let him out and he walks onto the porch. \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d he asks, pushing his hands into his pockets. \u201cMore rodent problems?\u201d</p><p>I shake my head. I can\u2019t look him in the eye. Something creeps down my back and suddenly, I wonder if it was him\u2014if this kid has been the one watching me, following me. I glance up at him, and think I\u2019m insane. James is a good kid. \u201cI think someone was in my apartment right before you came in. Any chance you saw someone come out when I started screaming?\u201d</p><p>James\u2019s eyes flick to the side like he\u2019s remembering. His hand touches his jaw, but he shakes his head. \u201cNo, just the scream. And your door was locked when I got there. I would have come in if it wasn\u2019t. I thought someone was hurting you.\u201d</p><p>I nod slowly, my hope sinking into my stomach. \u201cOh, okay.\u201d I turn to walk back. I feel the mental fog thicken. I don\u2019t know what to do.</p><p>James says, \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter? Why do you think someone was inside?\u201d I can\u2019t answer him. I don\u2019t want to admit it, because that will make it real. Right now it\u2019s an abstract idea, but if I say it... Oh God. I wrap my arms around my middle and turn off the steps. I start to walk away when James calls after me, \u201cHey, wait a second.\u201d He follows me back to my door, asking questions that I can\u2019t answer. Finally, he says, \u201cAre you all right, Miss Lamore?\u201d</p><p>No, I\u2019m not all right, but what am I supposed to say? He\u2019s a kid. I don\u2019t want to burden him with this, and if I say another word, the tears I\u2019m holding back will spill down my cheeks. James looks at me, waiting for an answer.</p><p>I glance at him, and force a smile. \u201cAnna, call me Anna. I\u2019m not that much older than you. Thanks for helping earlier.\u201d James nods slowly, like I might say something else, but I don\u2019t. He turns to walk away and I go back into my apartment. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I shut the door behind me and flip the deadbolt lock even though its daylight. My throat is so tight and dry that I can\u2019t swallow. Hysteria pushes its way through my veins. I want to get out of here and never come back.</p><p>I go back to my room, find my phone, and press in the numbers for Emma. I have to tell her even if I don\u2019t want to. If she comes back here alone and something happens to her, I\u2019ll never forgive myself. Em\u2019s voicemail picks up, since she\u2019s still at work.</p><p>I try to say it briefly, but as I\u2019m talking, I think that I sound way too scared for what happened. So someone wrote something nasty on my mirror?</p><p>Someone was in your apartment, Anna! My mind snaps back. Shaking my head, I change the reason for the call and tell her a raccoon got in and to be careful when she gets home. I hang up and tap my phone. For some reason, I can\u2019t say it. I can\u2019t admit what happened, yet. At the same time, I don\u2019t want her walking in here at night, alone. I have to do something.</p> <p>I call his number without thinking. He picks up on the second ring. \u201cEdward?\u201d</p><p>His voice sounds surprised, \u201cAnna? What\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAny chance you could come over later? I have an appointment and I don\u2019t want Em alone here.\u201d</p><p>He asks what happened. I tell him about the raccoon, and that I\u2019m a little on edge. I don\u2019t know where it came from and the more I think about it, the less likely it seems that it came down the chimney. I wonder if the perv threw it in the apartment when he came in. I fall silent and Edward says something, but I don\u2019t respond. I blink, looking at my mirror.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll head over now, okay? You sound out of sorts.\u201d I start to protest, but he\u2019s gone. I look at my phone and the screen\u2019s gone black.</p> <p>I run to the kitchen and get the Windex. I scrub away the letters before anyone else can see them. I pick up my make-up and put it away, but one tube of lipstick is missing. The one that was used to write on the mirror is gone. I can\u2019t think about it. I need Cole. My mind feels like its floating in glue and doesn\u2019t want to think. My thoughts are sluggish. The shakes calm down to a small tremor. I fold my arms over my chest to hide it.</p><p>I pace the apartment, looking for signs of entry, but there is nothing. Just the hole in the old chimney. That fireplace was part of the reason why we chose this apartment. Although it doesn\u2019t work, the hearth is really cute. I stare at the busted up wood and the door buzzes.</p><p>I check to make sure it\u2019s Edward first, and then let him in. His dark hair is wet like he just took a shower. He\u2019s wearing jeans with a cream colored shirt that\u2019s tucked in neatly at his waist. He looks me over once. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d</p><p>His question makes me want to cry, but I can\u2019t say it. It sounds stupid. I\u2019m crying because there was a nasty word on my mirror. I\u2019m crying because I\u2019m not a whore, but someone thinks I am. Biting my bottom lip, I shake my head and don\u2019t look him in the eye. \u201cNothing\u2019s wrong, just frazzled. That raccoon scared the hell out of me. I need to finish getting ready. Maybe you can seal up the fireplace? It looks like he came in that way.\u201d Lies, lies, lies. The pit of my stomach twists. I hate lying.</p><p>Edward nods and walks away from me, into the living room. I return to my bedroom and feel a little bit better since I\u2019m not alone. I hear Edward moving things and then the sound of wood snapping as he cleans up.</p><p>I pull the heated flat iron through my hair, careful not to burn myself. When I finish, I look like a different person. I put on a different outfit than I originally intended. I grab a pair of black leather pants and a tight tank. I put my make-up on darker than usual, trying to hide the fear in my eyes. I don\u2019t want this to ruin my night with Cole. He already has too much on his plate, and in comparison, this seems silly.</p> <p>Edward wraps his knuckles on my open door. He stands in the open doorway watching me as I apply a coat of mascara. \u201cIt\u2019s boarded up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d I say, trying not to stab myself in the eye. I hold the wand and glance at him, \u201cDo you mind hanging out until Emma gets here?\u201d I look at the mirror and carefully brush my lashes with the black goop. My hand shakes slightly. I rest it on the dresser and take a breath. Why can\u2019t I calm down?</p><p>Edward leans against the door frame and folds his arms over his chest. I can tell that he isn\u2019t going to cooperate unless he knows what\u2019s going on. \u201cWhat\u2019s this about, Anna? I can tell something\u2019s bothering you. Just tell me. Maybe I can fix it.\u201d His eyes burn a hole in the side of my face. He hated it when I wore makeup when we were dating. He likes that au natural thing going on.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to get into it now, Edward.\u201d I finish and put the make up back in my drawer. I turn to him and say, \u201cPlease, do this?\u201d</p><p>Edward nods once, but his eyes don\u2019t leave mine. I feel a chill work its way through my body. He never had sex with me and he\u2019s watching me get dressed to have sex with someone else. The way he looks me over makes me nervous, but then again, everything makes me nervous right now. I go to brush past him, when he gently takes me by the elbow and stops me. I turn toward him.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d tell me if you were in trouble, right?\u201d he asks. \u201cWe may not be lovers anymore, but I hope you still think of me as a friend.\u201d</p><p>Breathing slowly, I feel his fingers on my arm. The contact feels wrong. I turn toward him so his fingers slip away. I want to say that we were never lovers, but I know where he wants this conversation to go, and I don\u2019t want to rehash the past. I want to get to Cole and stay with him until all my apprehension fades away.</p><p>I smile and say, \u201cOf course, I do. Like you even need to ask that, Edward? I could have called anyone, but I called you.\u201d</p> <p>I walk down the hall and grab my helmet. Strapping it under my chin quickly, I grab my keys. Edward speaks as I get ready to go. His eyes are downcast, making him look vulnerable. \u201cYou only called me because I\u2019m Em\u2019s brother. If it was just you here, alone, we both know who you would have called.\u201d He means Cole.</p><p>\u201cBut I didn\u2019t. I called you. You\u2019re here now. And I could have called him anyway, but I didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Edward looks at me funny, his head tilting slightly, \u201cYou didn\u2019t tell him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell him what? That a rabid animal tried to take a bath with me? No. It seems more embarrassing than anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat else happened, Anna? I can see it in your eyes.\u201d He steps towards me and my heart ricochets off my ribs. I can\u2019t talk about it. I squirm away from him.</p><p>\u201cSomeone got in, okay. I don\u2019t want to talk about it, but I can\u2019t let Emma come home and find a pervert in her room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomeone broke in?\u201d he asks, his eyes narrowing as he shakes his head. \u201cAnna, did you call the cops?\u201d I shake my head. Edward looks at me, things finally clicking into place. \u201cYou didn\u2019t tell anyone, did you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you,\u201d I bit back. It feels like I ate a can of nails. I can\u2019t stand the way he\u2019s looking at me. I can\u2019t stand the way I feel, like my heart is going to explode at any moment. Just talking about it makes everything worse. \u201cJust watch out for Em.\u201d I turn toward the door and place my hand on the knob.</p><p>Edward shakes his head and follows me to the door. \u201cFine, fine,\u201d he says reassuringly. \u201cI\u2019ll be here when Em gets home, but I\u2019ve got to tell you that you\u2019re a real piece of work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight back at ya.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 3</p><p>I pick at a tomato on my plate. We\u2019re sitting in Cole\u2019s apartment. When I arrived he greeted me with the sexiest grin I\u2019ve ever seen. \u201cI didn\u2019t think you were into that,\u201d he says, eyeing my outfit.</p><p>I smile back, but I\u2019m still nervous. When I pulled my bike out the parking garage, I got spooked. My neck prickled and I\u2019m to the point that I\u2019m ready to jump out of my skin. The thing is, I don\u2019t know how to tell him. Cole is great, and it\u2019s not that he won\u2019t understand, it\u2019s more that he\u2019ll over-react. Saying what happened out loud makes the whole stalker thing real, although if I think about it at all, the lipstick letters on my mirror already did that.</p><p>We\u2019re sitting at his table, which is made from some exotic dark wood. I lean back in my chair and look up at him. \u201cI had something weird happen today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me about it.\u201d Cole grins at me. He expects a wild story and he\u2019s going to get one. My stomach twists as I think about telling him and a lump forms in my throat. The smile slips from his lips. Cole leans forward and takes my hand. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d It\u2019s a command. I can see it in his eyes.</p><p>I don\u2019t want to wriggle out of telling him, but it feels wrong to tell. Maybe I\u2019m stupid, yes, that\u2019s it\u2014I\u2019m a class A, completely insane idiot. I have to tell someone. Worry pinches my throat tight. What if he doesn\u2019t believe me? What if he thinks it\u2019s nothing? Stop it, Anna! Just tell him. I suck in air and dive into my story starting with the bathtub and ending with James flushing the raccoon out the front door. Cole\u2019s eyes widen as I tell it, but he doesn\u2019t laugh. He hears my voice hitch and become smaller, more strained as the story goes on.</p><p>\u201cAnd then what?\u201d His blue eyes lock with mine.</p><p>I can\u2019t look away and the feeling climbing up my throat won\u2019t subdue. It\u2019s raw fear. I try to keep it out of my voice when I speak, but I can\u2019t. I lick my lips and take a breath. \u201cWhen I got to my room, I noticed that someone had been there. They took my lipstick and wrote something on my mirror.\u201d</p><p>Cole\u2019s body tenses. Every muscle in his strong arms twitches. He\u2019s no longer eating. Cole looks at me, his lips parted slightly. His fingers ball into fists. He\u2019s fighting back the reaction he wants to have. Fury. \u201cWhat was written on the mirror, Anna?\u201d His voice is soft. It\u2019s the opposite of his body.</p><p>My lips are sealed shut. I can\u2019t speak. My voice won\u2019t come. My lips won\u2019t move. Cole comes around the table and pulls me into his arms. I start to sob into his shoulder. He pats my head and I manage to blubber out, \u201cWhore. He wrote \u2018whore\u2019 on my mirror with my lipstick. The tube is gone. He took it.\u201d</p><p>Cole says soothing things that don\u2019t register. He holds me tight and the crushing fear that I felt all day cracks and falls away. He pulls me from the embrace and holds me at arms-length for a moment, trying to see my face. Looking into my eyes, he says, \u201cYou didn\u2019t see anyone? Hear anyone?\u201d</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cNo. At first, I thought there was a person at the bathroom door, not an animal. I saw shadows and thought they were feet. Then I open the door and it\u2019s a raccoon. I was convinced that I was going nuts, that it was just an animal in the apartment, until I saw the mirror.\u201d My eyes are glassy, but I\u2019ve stopped crying. \u201cI asked James if he saw anyone leave, but he didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe apartment was locked up?\u201d</p><p>I nod. \u201cIt\u2019s not like it\u2019s Ft. Knox, but I\u2019m pretty sure everything was locked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs there anything else missing? Or out of place?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I nod slowly, feeling the realization creepy up my throat like bony fingers. \u201cA pair of panties is missing.\u201d</p><p>Cole just stares at me. His nostrils flare and he blinks. \u201cWhen? When did all this start?\u201d</p><p>I pull away from him and slip off his lap. I have to stand. Nervous energy floods my body and I start to pace. His eyes trail my movements and his arms fold over his chest. I try to swallow again, but it hurts. My mouth is too dry. \u201cI don\u2019t know. I felt like someone was following me, but there was never anyone there. And then I thought it was you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe?\u201d he says shocked.</p> <p>\u201cYeah, you said you were following me around, trying to talk to me. I assumed that you were following me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnna, I never followed you like that.\u201d Cole runs his hands through his hair. \u201cShit. I can\u2019t believe someone is doing this to you. I went to places where I knew you\u2019d be. I never stalked you. This is a fucking stalker and he\u2019s gotten into your house.\u201d Cole pauses a beat and lifts his eyes to meet mine. \u201cDoes Emma know?\u201d</p><p>I nod. \u201cYes, well, sort of. I felt weird telling anyone. I mean all that stuff in the beginning was just a feeling. No one was there, and I figured that I just lost the panties, but then today...\u201d I shake my head and my eyes sting with tears. I blink them away and rub my eyes with my hand. \u201cI called her brother over so she wasn\u2019t there alone after dark. I left her a message on her phone. I haven\u2019t had a chance to talk to her yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou told her brother?\u201d Cole asks. \u201cYou told him that someone was in the apartment?\u201d I nod again, trying to remember exactly what I said. The day had that white haze over it, like it was a memory from a long time ago. The part with the bathtub and the raccoon is vivid, but the rest grows fuzzy fast.</p><p>\u201cI told him that it wasn\u2019t safe for Em there alone. I asked him to stay the night and didn\u2019t really say why. He promised he\u2019d stay.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou need to tell her,\u201d Cole says. His eyes lock with mine. I\u2019m standing in front of him with my arms wrapped tightly around my middle. I hate feeling like this and talking about it makes it worse. Cole asks, \u201cWho do you think it is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d I answer, and close my eyes. I press my fingers to my temples and glance up at Cole as I speak. \u201cFor a second I thought it was James. He was there when I was screaming, but he was on the other side of the door. James doesn\u2019t have a key and the door was locked. If he got in, I don\u2019t know how.</p><p>\u201cAnd that doesn\u2019t make any sense anyway. The kid\u2019s in school. He\u2019d have to be cutting and ditching curfew to show up at the times when I\u2019ve felt spooked.\u201d Goosebumps spring up on my arms. I try to rub them away. Cole steps toward me and pulls me to his chest.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be okay. You stay with me,\u201d he kisses my head and holds me.</p><p>\u201cCole, I can\u2019t.\u201d I look up at him, not wanting to mention it. \u201cSottero wants to take everything you have. If you don\u2019t fight back... you\u2019ll have no home. Besides, whoever this is will just come at me when you aren\u2019t around. I\u2019d file a police report, but what am I supposed to say? I don\u2019t have a description or a name. I don\u2019t have anything.\u201d</p><p>Cole looks like I kicked him in the stomach when I mention the lawsuit. He turns from me and sits down at the table. He works his jaw and is quiet for a while. I walk to the kitchen and grab a bottle of wine and open it. After pouring two glasses, I return to the table and offer him one. I chug mine like it\u2019s a shot.</p> <p>Cole looks at me and I know something\u2019s changed. His back straightens. Cole stands and says, \u201cI need to make a phone call.\u201d</p><p>Cole disappears from the room. I hear his voice, but can\u2019t hear his words. I don\u2019t know what he\u2019s doing or who he\u2019s talking to. Tonight was supposed to be a night of passion, a night of sticky sex, and sultry smiles. Instead, I\u2019m spending it recanting how my day went to hell and that some nutjob thinks I\u2019m a whore. I down another glass of wine and lean my head on my hand. In a moment, my body feels warm as the wine works its way through me. The fear that\u2019s been coiled in my throat all day lessens.</p><p>Cole reappears and drops his phone on the table. He walks toward me and never takes his eyes off my face. Cole slips his hands around my waist and pulls me to my feet. Running his fingers through my straight hair he says, \u201cI\u2019ll protect you. I promise. Nothing will happen to you.\u201d</p><p>I nod. He watches me for a moment and something shifts. I feel safe with him. I know I am. It doesn\u2019t make sense to be so scared and then feel so frisky, but I do. I want him. I want his hands on me. I want him to hold me. I don\u2019t care what kind of kinky stuff he had planned for tonight. I want to show him that I love him. I want things to be soft.</p><p>I thread my fingers through his hair. They graze across his cheek as I do, feeling the stubble under my skin. He leans his head toward mine, and I feel his mouth on my lips. Cole kisses me lightly, like I might break. His tongue sweeps across the seam of my lips and I part them for him. The kiss deepens. It becomes hotter and possessive. Cole\u2019s hands slip over my body, pulling me to him, claiming that I\u2019m his.</p><p>I moan into his mouth and press my chest against him. His hands are on my back, drifting lower, feeling my curves. When he grabs on tight and pulls me up, I crash into his mouth and the kiss changes. Instead of being light, his tongue strokes my mouth like he\u2019ll die if I pull away. His lips smash down on mine. His fingers tangle in my hair and pull gently, tilting my head back and opening my mouth more. When his lips drift to my neck, I can\u2019t stand. I feel my knees give out and he catches me in his arms.</p><p>Without a word, Cole sweeps me up in his arms and carries me to his bed. He places me gently on the covers and looks down at me. \u201cYou\u2019re amazing, you know that?\u201d</p><p>I smile softly at him. \u201cWhat happens if I say that I\u2019m not so sure?\u201d I feel uncertain, like my life is spinning out of control. I don\u2019t know who I am any more. I don\u2019t understand why someone is stalking me or what they want, and the red letters burn behind my eyelids every time I blink. I pretend that it didn\u2019t bother me, at least I try, but there\u2019s a twisting inside my stomach that doesn\u2019t quiet. It chokes me. I tangle my fingers together as I look at him.</p> <p>Cole sees the worry in my eyes. He winks at me and turns away like he\u2019s decided something. Curiosity flames through me and I sit up. Cole takes something from behind his dresser. They\u2019re large prints in a black Le Femme box. \u201cThese will change your mind.\u201d His voice is soft.</p><p>\u201cWhat is that?\u201d I cross my leather-clad legs on the bed and sit up. Cole walks back to the bed and sits across from me.</p><p>He hands me the box and says, \u201cSee for yourself.\u201d</p><p>I lift the lid and set it down on the bed next to me. Tissue paper is folded over the contents. I push the thin papers back, parting the thin sheets until I see the photographs. My hand stills as I recognize the model. I glance up at him, \u201cThese are from that day...?\u201d</p><p>He nods. \u201cYes, and if there is any doubt in your mind about how incredibly seductive, alluring, or sexual you are after seeing those, well, I\u2019ll just have to take more.\u201d Cole grins wickedly.</p><p>I react wrong. I feel it coming and I know it\u2019s the wrong response, but I can\u2019t stop it. Instead of feeling better, tears well up in my eyes and spill down my cheeks. I suck in air so fast that I choke. Cole shifts so that he\u2019s sitting next to me, his gaze rapidly sweeping my face trying to figure out why I\u2019m crying. I hold the picture in my hands, trembling. It\u2019s beautiful. The trail of crystals that draped my body, the way he posed me, the light and shadows...</p><p>I rasp in a jagged breath and try to stop acting like a lunatic. \u201cThese are beautiful.\u201d</p><p>Cole takes his hand and rubs my back as I look at the portrait. He kisses a tear from my cheek and whispers in my ear, \u201cYou\u2019re amazing, Anna. You stun me into silence, and it\u2019s not just because of any one thing. It\u2019s you. It\u2019s who you are, everything from your sharp wit, to your amazing eyes, to the way you wear those pants like they\u2019re jeans\u2014which they\u2019re not by the way\u2014you\u2019re the best thing that\u2019s ever happened to me.\u201d His eyes are on the side of my face as he speaks. I can\u2019t turn. I\u2019ll explode into a ball of tears. As he says these things, a smile spreads across my face.</p><p>I look at one image, and then the next. I say nothing for a while, just gazing at his creations, seeing me how he sees me. The images that were painted with light showcase every curve. The stones glitter in the darkness, giving the impression of my curves that remain unseen. A pale violet light rims my waist and hips, trailing up to my breasts, and spilling onto my neck. My face is turned toward the light source, and unlike his old work, my eyes are prominent. There\u2019s a look on my face that I wish I could conceal. It makes me feel completely naked, as if being stripped wasn\u2019t enough. I feel like he\u2019s captured my soul.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s perfect,\u201d I finally say.</p><p>Cole is watching me, his blue gaze never leaving my face. He drinks in the look in my eyes, the way they devour the picture and take in every tiny detail. \u201cSo are you.\u201d He leans in and kisses my cheek. It\u2019s a gentle kiss, chaste even.</p><p>I smile in response when he pulls away. Glancing at him, I say, \u201cI\u2019m glad we met. I\u2019m glad you interviewed me and not someone else. I\u2019m glad I wore that hideous outfit and insulted you. If I hadn\u2019t, none of this would have happened. I\u2014\u201d</p><p>Cole doesn\u2019t let me say anything else. He takes the box from my hands and sets it on the dresser before leaning in and pressing his lips to mine.</p><p>The last few times we were together, everything felt hot to the point of combustion. This time it is different. Cole\u2019s kiss is soft and perfect. He makes no attempt to watch me the way he did last time. He stays with me, kissing my mouth like he\u2019s searching for something, like I\u2019m the one he needs, the one he wants. His hands slip over my body, feeling each curve as we lay back on his bed. I reach my arms around his neck and tangle my fingers in his hair, losing myself in the kiss. It\u2019s a good kiss. There\u2019s no other word for it. There are kisses that burn with lust and then there are others that are sweet. This one is both. It burns, but it doesn\u2019t make me crazy. Lust doesn\u2019t surge through my veins, something else does, but I\u2019m not entirely certain what.</p><p>I let the kiss linger and Cole is no hurry. His tongue seeks mine, playing, feeling the curves of my mouth. He tastes me like he could never get enough. Cole\u2019s hand lingers at my waist as the other finds my cheek. He brushes the back of his fingers across my jaw and down my neck as the kiss continues. I can barely breathe. My body is warm, yearning for his. I want to take Cole in my arms and never let go. The world around me vanishes. Every worry that occupied my mind disappears until there is only the two of us, lost in this kiss.</p><p>Cole slowly moves on top of me, leaning all his weight on one arm. His fingers play in my hair and his other hand slips beneath my shirt. He splays his fingers on my stomach and slides his hand around to the small of my back, pulling me closer to him. I feel the heat of the kiss, the desire building between us. That attraction has always been there, but this is more. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Breathing hard, Cole breaks the kiss and looks down at me. \u201cI love you, Anna.\u201d</p><p>His blue gaze makes me feel like I\u2019m flying. I smile widely and say, \u201cI love you, too.\u201d We continue kissing, maintaining a slow pace. Cole kisses me, enjoying my mouth before moving onto my neck. His teeth nip my ear, before pressing gentle kisses along the side of my neck.</p><p>I pull him to me, trying to flip him over so that I can spoil him with affection, but he won\u2019t let me. \u201cNo, Anna. I want you like this. I want to show you how much I love you.\u201d The way he says it sounds like a question, like he\u2019s asking me if it\u2019s all right.</p><p>My heart is pounding. The way Cole looks at me is wonderful and terrifying. I\u2019m not sure what he means, but I want to find out. I tuck my hair behind my ear. \u201cAll right.\u201d I hear my voice and am surprised at how frightened I sound. This is different for us. Lust burns hot and bright, but this\u2014whatever this is\u2014feels like forever. It feels like love, the kind that doesn\u2019t ever fade away.</p> <p>Cole\u2019s eyes follow my fingers as I move the curl. The corners of his mouth pull up. He looks down at me and asks, \u201cYou only do that when you\u2019re nervous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d I confess.</p><p>Pressing a kiss to my neck, he asks, \u201cWhat\u2019s making you nervous, Miss Lamore?\u201d</p><p>My eyes close as his lips press to my neck. God, his mouth is so warm. I enjoy the sensation. \u201cWell, my boss says he wants me...\u201d my lips twitch. I\u2019m trying to smile, but I can\u2019t. I\u2019m scared and unsure why. My eyes lock with his. I tell him the truth. \u201cI can do the lust thing, Cole, but I\u2019ve never done the love thing.\u201d My pulse pounds harder, until the only sound I can hear is my heart racing. I can\u2019t swallow. I can\u2019t breathe. I don\u2019t know what I expect him to do. Confessing that I\u2019ve never been in love before doesn\u2019t seem that intimate, but now, at this moment, it does. I wonder if he knows what I feel. The crash of ecstasy and fear are twisting together inside my chest. My jaw locks as I press my lips together.</p><p>Cole is quiet for a moment. He looks at me, his eyes slipping over my face. Finally, he says, \u201cAt one time, I thought love was so devastating when it was over, that it wasn\u2019t worth the risk. I don\u2019t think that anymore. I think love\u2019s worth chancing the agony that things may go wrong. Besides, I don\u2019t want to live like that, always wondering what I could have had, if we would have been happy. I\u2019ve done that. It\u2019s a lonely life, Anna.</p> <p>\u201cThere are only a few things I\u2019m certain of. I have here and now. I have today. I had thought that there were no promises in this life, nothing to grab hold of\u2014I used to think that nothing was forever, Anna. But this, me and you, it\u2019s worth the risk. You\u2019re already part of me, and it\u2019s not that I can\u2019t let you go, it\u2019s that I don\u2019t want to. I love you, Anna. You\u2019re worth the risk.\u201d He caresses my cheek with the back of his hand. His gaze doesn\u2019t stray from my eyes.</p><p>\u201cWhat made you change your mind?\u201d I lean into his hand. His touch makes my stomach fall away. I feel like I\u2019m flying or falling\u2014or both. The moment feels surreal, like it\u2019s passing in slow motion.</p><p>Cole\u2019s eyes lower. Answering, he breathes, \u201cYou. You changed my mind. You changed my world...\u201d</p><p>Taking Cole\u2019s face in my hands, I pull his lips down to meet mine. I kiss him. It feels like my life is in a free fall. I don\u2019t know which way is up and at that moment, I don\u2019t care. I feel found in Cole\u2019s arms. I feel whole. The feminazi inside my mind is screaming at me, but I ignore her. Relying on another person isn\u2019t weakness. Wanting a man doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m not a strong woman. It means I have a heart. It means I can love someone and for some crazy-ass reason, he loves me back.</p><p>We spend the night together in his bed, neither of us sleeping. Cole\u2019s hands study every inch of my body. His lips follow, and he touches me, kisses me, and learns my body. I lay on my back as he strips my clothes away, leaving me naked. His eyes rake my figure, but he quickly moves on to caresses and kisses so soft and adoring that I\u2019m floating in sheer bliss. My skin grows hot as my insides twist with each gentle touch. Every kiss is like a flame licking my skin. I feel Cole slide between my legs. He touches lightly before pushing his hard length inside of me. I moan and dig my nails into his back. I feel dizzy and giddy. There\u2019s a smile on my face and no matter how hard I try, I can\u2019t hide it.</p><p>Cole\u2019s hands tangle in my hair. He whispers in my ear, kissing my neck, as he rocks into me over and over again. I wrap my legs around his waist and pull him in farther. We stay like that, in that euphoric state for hours, until Cole finally pushes me over the edge. My body shatters as I come. Every inch of me is hypersensitive. I feel him inside me and want him there. My nails claw his back as he finds his release, saying my name. He moves to pull away, but I hold him there.</p> <p>Looking into his eyes, I say, \u201cI love you, Cole.\u201d</p><p>Our sweat covered bodies are tangled together. He lays on top of me as I stroke his hair. My heart is pounding and I can\u2019t stop smiling. My messed up cave-man has a soft side.</p><p>CHAPTER 4</p><p>The night passes slowly. When I try to fall asleep, I find that I can\u2019t. The red letters are there when I close my eyes, sending my pulse into panic mode. I refuse to be thrown out of my home, but this stalker has done more than that\u2014he\u2019s gotten into my head. Fear courses through me and I shudder. Cole lays next to me, dozing on and off. He feels me move and tightens his arms around me, hugging me to his chest.</p><p>I hear his heartbeat, slow and steady. The warmth of his body pressed to mine is perfect. We stay like that for a while. Eventually Cole kisses my brow and says, \u201cI\u2019ve been thinking about what you said, about my name.\u201d</p><p>Surprise fills me. I didn\u2019t expect him to decide anything. Actually, I realized his name is important to him. It is the only part of a life that he no longer has. I guessed that his last name is like a security blanket, that it gives him comfort in some way that I don\u2019t understand. I can\u2019t rip that away from him. It makes sense. It\u2019s also the only reason I can fathom as to why he\u2019s letting Sottero walk all over him and steal his fortune.</p><p>I don\u2019t lift my head from his chest. I lay in his arms and feel his smooth skin under my fingers. \u201cOh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you might be right\u2014that it isn\u2019t worth holding onto. Not anymore. I know who I am. I don\u2019t need a name to tell me that.\u201d</p> <p>Worry trickles through me. \u201cCole, I just want you to be happy. I\u2019m not sure if you should listen to me on that. I really don\u2019t know anything about it or what you went through... I just,\u201d I chose my words carefully, \u201cdidn\u2019t understand before, but I think I do now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think so?\u201d He shifts me in his arms and looks down at me. His eyebrows lift into his hair. A crooked grin lines his sleepy face. I nod. \u201cSo, tell me, then.\u201d</p><p>I squirm in his arms, but he holds me tighter, not letting me wiggle away like I want to. I relax and his grip loosens. \u201cMaybe I don\u2019t know my ass from my elbow, but it seems like that name means a lot to you. It anchors you, gives you security about who you are and who you want to be. I get why you want to keep it. I shouldn\u2019t have said anything. I was thoughtless. You should ignore me. I haven\u2019t lived your life. I have no idea about anything. I showed up in a tutu for godsakes. I seriously doubt you should be taking advice from a life-size Skittle.\u201d</p><p>I feel Cole smile against the top of my head as I speak. He trails his finger along my arm. \u201cI like your ass, and your elbows are lovely, Lamore. And\u2014a secret between you and me\u2014I actually think you know more than you let on. You see more than you let on, Anna. I love you. I want to hear what you think, and on this, you were right the other day.</p><p>\u201cThat damn name carries a ton of baggage with it. Every time someone says Mr. Stevens, I think of my father. I wonder if I\u2019m like him, even though I\u2019ve tried so hard not to be. I thought I needed the reminder. I thought it guided me and helped shape me into who I am, and maybe it did, but I was thinking and realized that I don\u2019t need it any more. I know who I am, with or without the name. And I want you, without all the crap that the Stevens name brings with it.\u201d</p><p>I turn on my side. There\u2019s a pillow under Cole\u2019s arm that is behind my head. I don\u2019t know what he\u2019s saying. I look at him and our eyes meet. \u201cCole?\u201d My voice is light. The moment feels fragile. I watch Cole\u2019s face, wondering what he\u2019s thinking and can\u2019t understand why he\u2019s suddenly silent.</p><p>His eyes lower, and when he lifts them again, they are completely vulnerable. \u201cAnna Lamore, you are the best thing that ever happened to me. I want to make you happy for the rest of your life. I want to hold you in my arms every night and see your face every morning. I want you to be mine and I want to be yours.\u201d His eyes don\u2019t leave mine. \u201cWill you marry me, Anna?\u201d</p><p>Shock hits me in the head like a pail of ice water. \u201cWhat?\u201d I eloquently blurt out. I push my naked body up on his bed and look down at him. Sheets cover his lower body. Cole folds his hands behind his head and smiles at me.</p><p>\u201cAre you really that surprised, Miss Lamore? Did you really think that I only took you into my bed, but managed to keep you out of my heart?\u201d</p><p>My jaw is hanging open. I can\u2019t breathe. I never expected a proposal. My lips press into a thin line and then lift into a smile. It\u2019s like my face can\u2019t decide if I should laugh or cry. \u201cAre you serious?\u201d I pull the sheet up, covering my chest.</p><p>Cole pushes up onto his side. He reaches for the sheet and gently pulls it from my fingers. His eyes drink in my curves, before his gaze meets mine. \u201cCompletely. I can\u2019t resist you, and if you say no, I\u2019m afraid that I\u2019ll have to keep asking until you say yes.\u201d He leans over me and presses a kiss to my neck. His lips are so warm. I enjoy the sensation for a moment before my mind starts yelling at me to pay attention.</p><p>\u201cUntil I say yes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmmmh,\u201d he says, pressing another kiss to the back of my neck.</p><p>I can\u2019t think. I don\u2019t want to think. I want to say yes, but fear won\u2019t leave me alone. I try to be light, to joke to avoid answering right then. I shudder as his kiss presses to the back of my neck, right at that lust-inducing spot. \u201cI might need some convincing,\u201d I say in breathy voice.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d be happy to.\u201d Cole doesn\u2019t press me. Instead he continues his kisses down my back. I slip face-down on the bed and turn my head so I can see him. I clutch the pillow under my head as Cole lights my body on fire. His touch is electric, his kisses drip with sensuality. I can\u2019t resist him. I know I can\u2019t, and I don\u2019t know why I feel like I have to. I give in to his caresses, to his hands. He loves me and shows me. It\u2019s more than I thought I\u2019d ever get. I thought I\u2019d have to settle for someone. Cole isn\u2019t settling. He\u2019s perfect, and yet, I notice that I couldn\u2019t say yes to his proposal.</p><p>The next morning Cole dresses quickly. He has a meeting with his lawyer and I have to show up for the hearing later in the afternoon. I don\u2019t want to go, but it\u2019s a necessary evil. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Cole looks beautiful in his suit. The color is so dark that it makes his eyes look like sapphires. He straightens his tie as he looks at me sitting on his blue chair, with my robe barely covering me. \u201cYou make it impossible to leave, you know that, right?\u201d</p><p>I pull my knees to my chest and see his eyes follow the sweep of my bare hip. \u201cI know.\u201d My heart is racing at the thought of being alone. I\u2019m afraid of the stalker. I wonder if he\u2019s waiting for me, watching me. I don\u2019t want Cole to leave, but I try to banish the crazy thoughts before they make me nuts. I\u2019m not living my life like this. A bolt of determination strikes me and I try to tempt Cole into staying a little longer.</p><p>A wicked grin crosses my lips. I stand and allow the robe to fall to the floor. Walking toward Cole, I wear nothing but a smile. Cole freezes. His eyes watch me move toward him. Tension lines his shoulders and spills down into his arms. God, that suit makes him look gorgeous. When I reach Cole, I thread my arms around his neck and gently kiss his lips. The feel soft and warm, completely perfect.</p><p>Cole sucks in a breath and slowly releases it after the kiss. His eyes close as he does it. I step away, loving the effect I have on him. Cole smiles for a moment and then his eyes open. He looks me over and says, \u201cI want you wearing that exact same outfit next time I see you.\u201d Cole grins, winking at me before he starts to gather his things and move towards the front door.</p> <p>I laugh, following him. \u201cI\u2019m sure Sottero will appreciate a buck-naked Anna at court.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know I would,\u201d he says, not looking back at me.</p><p>I fold my arms across my chest and lean against the doorway. \u201cMaybe I shouldn\u2019t come today. I mean, she\u2019s just going to try and use me against you\u2014to prove whatever whacked point she\u2019s trying to make.\u201d</p><p>Cole turns and meets my gaze. He only looks at my face, but I can tell he\u2019s fighting the urge to let his eyes dip lower. \u201cThere\u2019s no way for your testimony to support her claim since you weren\u2019t there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you were, and it doesn\u2019t seem to matter what you say.\u201d I wish I could make this go away. I can\u2019t stand watching this happen to him.</p> <p>\u201cI haven\u2019t been fighting this, Anna, but now I intend to. I\u2019m not letting it slide. I\u2019m changing my name before my father\u2019s attorney forces me to and I\u2019m fighting back.\u201d He looks at me for a moment. At first I think he\u2019s asking me if it\u2019s okay, and then I realize that he\u2019s telling me. There\u2019s no question in his voice. He knows what he wants. He knows what he\u2019s doing and he\u2019s informing me of his intentions.</p><p>\u201cThere are some things that are worth fighting for.\u201d He winks at me, repeating my words back to me. I nod and smile softly. I don\u2019t want him to get hurt, but I think he\u2019s made the right choice. I can\u2019t hide it. Cole smiles at me. \u201cDon\u2019t do anything stupid. Keep the doors locked until you leave. Get in and out of your apartment as fast as possible. Stay out of alleys and abandoned buildings. I\u2019ll see you this afternoon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCole,\u201d my voice catches. I step toward him, hesitant. \u201cDo you think he can get in here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, baby,\u201d he shakes his head. \u201cThe doorman doesn\u2019t let random people in, and your bike should be fine in the garage. No one can get in there either without the guard letting them through. There are a ton of cameras down there, too. Are you going to ride your motorcycle in later?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. Which is better? The bike or the train? I could end up in a car alone. With the bike, I\u2019ll end up in the parking garage alone. I can park the bike on the street when I get there.\u201d Goosebumps prickle my arms as I speak. I hate this. I\u2019m altering my life because of this douche. I rub the bumps away, but the creeped-out feeling still lingers on my skin.</p><p>\u201cTake your bike. I\u2019ll keep an eye out for you, and you better believe that if you\u2019re a second late, that I\u2019ll come looking for you.\u201d I smile. Cole crosses the room and pulls me to his chest. He presses a kiss firmly to the top of my head and says, \u201cNo one will hurt you.\u201d</p> <p>I nod as he pulls away. I watch Cole walk out the door and my pulse ticks up a notch. It nearly explodes when I shower. The scene from Psycho keeps playing through my mind in an endless loop. I watch the suds swirl down the drain and remember the ribbons of blood on the bottom of the tub from that movie. By the time I get out of the shower, I\u2019ve nearly peed myself twice.</p><p>\u201cStop it, Anna.\u201d I say out loud, just to prove that I\u2019m alone. The back of my neck won\u2019t stop prickling. It feels like a ghost is breathing down my beck. I go to Cole\u2019s stereo and turn it on, hoping that the noise will help. I blow out my damp hair and clip it back to the nape of my neck. I want to dress, but there\u2019s nothing here. I\u2019d already discussed this with Cole. Emma should be home and as long as she is, I\u2019m going to grab my suit. If not, the backup plan is to buy another one. Maybe it\u2019s a stupid time to be cheap, but I really want my suit. It fits me right and there\u2019s no way I\u2019m going to find another one in a few hours and make it to the courthouse on time.</p><p>I call Emma, hoping she\u2019s home. She picks up on the third ring. \u201cAnna, are you okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, Em. I\u2019m fine. I\u2019m at Cole\u2019s. Are you okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod!\u201d she spews swear words at me like a drunk gremlin and then asks, \u201cWhat the hell happened? Edward said an animal got in, and then James came by to make sure you were okay. He said you asked him if he saw someone leaving the apartment? Anna, what the hell is going on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEdward didn\u2019t tell you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me what?\u201d</p><p>Rage shot through me. I clenched my free hand and wanted to hurl the phone at the wall. \u201cThat someone got in yesterday? He was supposed to stay with you last night. Did he\u2014\u201d</p> <p>She cut me off, \u201cYeah, he stayed, but he didn\u2019t tell me crap. He just said that he wasn\u2019t leaving. The ass slept on the couch all night. He was really tense, so of course, we fought like crazy. Then, when I tried to call you, you didn\u2019t answer.\u201d Em breathes, trying to steady her tirade. \u201cHow\u2019d you know someone got inside?\u201d</p><p>My veins fill with ice when she asks the question. The red letters flash in my mind. I steady my voice. \u201cBecause they wrote something on my mirror with my lipstick\u2014\u2018whore.\u2019\u201d My voice is too soft. I can\u2019t hide how much this is freaking me out. Emma is silent. I expected that she\u2019d be spewing foul words, but she says nothing. \u201cEm?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry, Anna. Oh my God. I didn\u2019t know.\u201d She coughs and clears her through. It sounds normal when she speaks again. \u201cDo you think it was a fluke? Like a random break-in or something.\u201d</p><p>I want to say yes, but I know it\u2019s not. I can feel it. \u201cNo, it\u2019s not random. I\u2019ve felt like I\u2019ve been watched for a while now. Some nights, I would have sworn someone was following me, but I never saw anyone. Then this happened. Anyway, I wanted you to know. Our apartment isn\u2019t safe. Neither of us should be there alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEdward said the same thing. He wouldn\u2019t leave. I thought he was just being an ass. Damn, Anna. I had no idea. What do we do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I told you, Cole, and Edward. I guess we just hope that the guy stops. It\u2019s not like I can get a restraining order or something. There\u2019s nothing to report.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere was no broken glass?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d he get in?\u201d</p><p>I shrug and shift the phone to my other ear. \u201cI don\u2019t know. I\u2019m assuming he got in the same way the raccoon did\u2014through the chimney\u2014but I don\u2019t know.\u201d That doesn\u2019t make sense, but then again, neither does anything else. \u201cI need to run by there to grab a suit. I have to appear for Sottero later today and I don\u2019t have anything here. Any chance that you\u2019re still home?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. I\u2019m still here. Come by and get what you need. I\u2019ll wait for you.\u201d</p><p>I pull on my clothes and race down to the garage to grab my bike. When I enter the parking lot, I look around longer than usual and then try my best not to run. My skin prickles again and my entire body is covered in goosebumps. No one is there. Anger rushes through me, but it\u2019s not enough to choke back the fear.</p><p>I have the key in hand and have already strapped my helmet onto my head. As I get closer, I see something on the seat. The seat is black, but there is something on top of the leather that looks like a black tissue. When I\u2019m a foot from the bike, I recognize what it is. My spine goes straight and my heart jerks to a stop. My eyes go wide as I stare at my favorite pair of black panties that went missing. They are tucked under the seat strap. I\u2019m so creeped-out that I don\u2019t want to sit on the bike. I glance at the guard in the booth and then back at my bike, at the panties. Someone took them. Someone found me here and put them on my bike, on the seat, where I\u2019d be sure to find them. My heart is racing like a scared rabbit. The trembling in my hands is spilling into my stomach in icy waves. I feel sick, like I\u2019m going to puke. Anger bubbles into the mix. I\u2019m angry that someone is doing this to me. I\u2019m angry that he got so close and I didn\u2019t notice. How could I be so stupid?</p><p>I refuse to let this ass get to me. I whip my head around, feeling the blood coursing through me like a bottle of shaken champagne. I feel wired. If he steps out of the shadows now, I\u2019ll rip his eyes out with my nails. My muscles tense, waiting for someone to appear, but no one materializes. No one claims the fear that ignited within me. I\u2019m alone.</p><p>I take the panties and stuff them under the seat. I kickstart the bike and peel out, leaving skid marks behind. I speed all the way home.</p><p>CHAPTER 5</p><p>By the time I get home, I\u2019m calm again. I shove my key into the lock, ready to twist it open when Emma throws the door open and pulls me into her arms. She bear hugs me until my ribs are breaking. I can\u2019t breathe and try to pry her off of me.</p><p>Edward is sitting on the couch. He stands and walks over. Resting a hand on Em\u2019s shoulder, he says, \u201cShe needs to breathe, Emma. Let go. She\u2019s fine.\u201d</p><p>Emma releases me and looks me over. She tucks a strand of dark hair behind her ear, and acts like she doesn\u2019t believe that I\u2019m fine. \u201cLet me look at you. Did something else happen?\u201d</p><p>Damn it, Emma. How does she do that?</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I lie and walk into the kitchen. My brain asks, Why are you lying, but I don\u2019t want to think about it. I don\u2019t want any of this. I shake my head and smile lamely. \u201cI\u2019m just frazzled. Some ass in a truck almost ran me over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow can you be so calm about this?\u201d Emma scolds. \u201cWhat if it was the stalker?\u201d</p><p>Uhm, I\u2019m freaking out inside. Wow, did she read me wrong. \u201cI\u2019m not calm. I\u2019m freaked, okay?\u201d I turn to her and snap. I don\u2019t mean to. I shake my head and close my eyes. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Em. I\u2019m just kind of freaked. I\u2019m going to stay at Cole\u2019s for a while, until this blows over. I just wanted to be sure that someone could stay here with you. Or maybe you should crash at your mom\u2019s for a while.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She laughs at that. \u201cYeah right.\u201d Okay, maybe that\u2019s a bad idea. Em and her Mom fight like rabid cats. \u201cNo, I\u2019ll stay here. Edward will stick around for a while, right?\u201d He nods. While we\u2019re speaking, Edward crosses the room and slips himself up onto the kitchen counter. \u201cI should be okay as long as I\u2019m not alone. And you staying with Cole for a little while is a good idea.\u201d</p><p>I nod and look at my hands. My fingers twist together. I glance up at her. \u201cActually, it might be longer than a little while.\u201d I flick my eyes up to meet Em\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cHe asked you to move in with him?\u201d she asks, mouth hanging open. A wide grin spreads across her face. I glance at Edward, not wanting to say it in front of him, but he\u2019s going to be around for a while.</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cHe asked me to marry him, Emma.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHoly shit! What\u2019d you say?\u201d Emma\u2019s eyes are so big that they look like saucers. She practically bounces up and down as she grabs my hands. She thinks I said yes, but I didn\u2019t and I don\u2019t know why.</p><p>I do my best to treat Edward like a person, but I can\u2019t meet his gaze. I look back at Emma. \u201cI didn\u2019t answer. I didn\u2019t know what to say.\u201d</p><p>Emma drops my hands. She\u2019s shocked into silence and stares at me with her mouth in an O. Two seconds later she shakes her head and looks at the clock. \u201cI\u2019ve got to get to work, but we are talking about this later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDefinitely.\u201d Things feel normal for a second. Emma hugs me again, quickly this time. Her phone rings. Edward lifts it off the counter top and hands it to her.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s work.\u201d He says.</p> <p>\u201cDamn it,\u201d she mutters, and says, \u201cHello.\u201d Emma takes the phone into the other room. Her voice carries through the apartment for a moment until she closes the door.</p><p>Edward and I are alone. He sits on the counter, his spine ram-rod straight. \u201cSo, a proposal?\u201d</p><p>I nod, \u201cYeah, is that too weird? I didn\u2019t know if I should mention it in front of you.\u201d I don\u2019t want to hurt you more than I already have.</p><p>Edward smiles at me and shakes his head. \u201cNah, don\u2019t be silly. You and Emma are best friends. Tell her anything you want. Besides, I\u2019m not real keen on leaving her alone right now, not with someone breaking-in and all that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a good brother, Edward. Emma\u2019s lucky to have you.\u201d I say the words and mean them. He\u2019s a good brother.</p><p>Emma bursts through her door. She pulled on clothes, but doesn\u2019t have that polished look she\u2019s normally sporting. Em grabs an apple from the fridge. \u201cThat ass. He wants me there now. Thanks for telling me.\u201d Emma says to herself, muttering. She looks at me, \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t mean to run out on you like this. I should have had another forty minutes. I can\u2019t believe Stacy thinks he can call me in like this.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLooks like he can,\u201d Edward says, and Em shoots him a look that says drop dead.</p><p>\u201cStay with Anna until she leaves, okay? I\u2019ll be home at five. Let\u2019s have dinner, Edward. And I\u2019ll catch up with you later tonight, Anna. Call me when you have a second. I want to hear about Sottero and Cole. I can\u2019t believe he proposed!\u201d She bites the apple and runs for the door, practically tripping over her feet. Turning back, she says, \u201cI can\u2019t believe you said no!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t say \u2018no,\u2019\u201d I reply, but Em is already gone.</p><p>When the door slams, I look at Edward. \u201cMind hanging out for a few more minutes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, that\u2019s fine.\u201d He tilts his head toward me. \u201cThere\u2019s something black on the back of your arm.\u201d</p><p>I twist my arm and try to look. There\u2019s a thin black line that runs from my upper arm to my elbow. It looks like tar. I press my finger against it and it smears. \u201cShit. What is that?\u201d I look at my fingers.</p><p>Edward slips off the counter and comes over. He examines the black goo, but doesn\u2019t touch. \u201cIt looks like grease or something. You want me to try and wipe it off with a sponge?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah, I know how much dirt freaks you out. I\u2019ll do it.\u201d But as I do it, I smear the black goo across my arm. It doesn\u2019t come off and now there are black streaks of water running down my arm and into my shirt.</p> <p>Edward watches me for a second before snatching the sponge, \u201cI swear, Anna. It\u2019s a wonder you\u2019re\u2014\u201d he stops before he says it. \u201cJust stay still.\u201d He puts warm water on the sponge and uses dish soap to get the grease off my arm. When he\u2019s done, he throws the sponge in the sink and says, \u201cTake a shower to get the rest of it washed off.\u201d</p><p>I glance at the time. I need to get to the courthouse early. Cole\u2019s lawyer is supposed to go over stuff with me. \u201cDamn it.\u201d I look at the gray schmutz on my arm. He\u2019s right. I dart to my room.</p><p>Edward returns to the couch and flips on the TV. It\u2019s blaringly loud, like he\u2019s totally deaf, which is weird, but I\u2019m in too much of a hurry to think about it. I strip quickly and pull on a robe. Racing to the bathroom, I turn on the water and scrub my arms until they\u2019re raw.</p><p>When I return to my room, I\u2019m dripping wet. I leave a path of puddles on the floor. My robe clings to me because my skin is still damp. I towel off my legs and then turn my head to the side to dab the ends of my hair. My eyes drift across the room to my dresser. The top of it is exactly the way I left it with one glaring difference.</p><p>My heart stops. I drop the towel. It lands in a lump at my feet. Fear chokes me, making it impossible to swallow. I stare at the tube of lipstick and feel my heart slam into my ribs like I just got electrocuted. I step toward it, my hand shaking as I lift the tube. I stop in front of it, not wanting to touch it. This was gone. The perv took it with him and now it\u2019s back.</p><p>My panties on my bike.</p><p>The words on my mirror.</p><p>Horror washes over me in an icy wave. I lift the tube of lipstick and slip the cover off. It\u2019s the cherry red. The tip has been smashed like someone used it as chalk. Terror courses through me and I drop the stick. It falls to the floor and rolls under my dresser. My hand slaps over my mouth to muffle a noise that sounds like a cross between a cry and a sob.</p><p>Frantically, I look around the room. There are no signs of forced entry, no broken windows, no opened locks on the windows, no nothing. My body acts like it wants to run. The muscles in my legs twitch. I turn toward the closet, deciding to get dressed and get the hell out of here. I\u2019m never coming back. I\u2019ll never leave Cole\u2019s side again. And I\u2019m telling Emma to frickin\u2019 move.</p><p>My veins are coursing with panic. As I turn toward the closet, I catch movement out of the corner of my eye. Edward pulls the door open. He stands in the doorway, watching me in my robe. My wet hair is plastered to my face. A shiver slips down my spine like an ice cube. I stare at him for a second, wondering if he\u2019s twisted enough to do this to me. I think I\u2019m going insane and ignore the warning flags my mind is beating me with over the head.</p><p>Edward doesn\u2019t look at me. He looks past me, at the dresser, and asks, \u201cI heard something fall. Are you all right?\u201d I nod, too freaked to talk. I clutch my robe tighter at the neck. Edward finally turns and looks at me. \u201cDid you get the grease off? Are you clean?\u201d</p><p>Am I clean? That question would have pissed me off a few months ago. Now, it just sends a jolt of panic through my throat. I can\u2019t swallow. My mouth is so dry. My neck feels thick, like a log, and words won\u2019t form. I nod again.</p><p>Edward steps into my room, his body blocking the door. I feel like I\u2019m cornered. I glance over my shoulder at the window, wondering how much it will hurt to throw myself through it. Logic intercedes and tells me that this is Edward. I know him. He won\u2019t hurt me. He isn\u2019t the one that\u2019s been messing with me. But, memories that seemed odd, or didn\u2019t make sense before, come racing back.</p><p>Edward showing up when he didn\u2019t know where I was. Edward finding me outside of Cole\u2019s. Edward showing up at the beach. Emma knowing things she shouldn\u2019t have known, things I never told her. The missing panties. The cherry red lipstick that he hates. The way he said he\u2019d wait for me, that we weren\u2019t over.</p><p>My chest tightens. I shrink back from him, still not wanting to believe what I\u2019m thinking. Edward looks apologetic. I don\u2019t understand why. He presses his palms together and then parts his hands as he speaks, \u201cGood. I knew there\u2019d be a day that you came home and I\u2019d be here\u2014that you\u2019d want me here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEdward,\u201d I manage to choke out his name. I lift my hand without meaning to, the universal sign for STOP but he keeps coming toward me. \u201cI need to get dressed. I have to be at court. Can we talk later?\u201d My voice cracks. It\u2019s a pathetic attempt to placate him, to ward him off, so that I can run and never look back.</p><p>He stops in front of me, my hand pressing into his chest. Edward presses his hands on top of mine. \u201cNow\u2019s as good a time as any. I heard what you said before\u2014about not accepting his proposal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEdward, I\u2014\u201d I try to pull my hand away, but his fingers wrap around my wrist. Edward lifts my hand to his lips and brushes a kiss against the back of my hand. I yank harder, but he won\u2019t let me go.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re still in love with me. I know.\u201d He says it with complete certainty.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not!\u201d I jerk my wrist again and stumble backwards when he releases me. A pained expression draws his dark brows together. It\u2019s like he won\u2019t accept that I don\u2019t like him, that he intends to have me anyway.</p><p>\u201cYou are,\u201d he insists. \u201cYou told him no. You dumped Jessie. I can forgive your infidelity, Anna, but I won\u2019t tolerate your lying.\u201d Edward\u2019s eyes blaze with fury. His arm swings before I see it coming and he connects with my cheek in a loud WHACK.</p><p>Stunned, I stagger back into the corner. My back presses against the wall as my hands cradle my cheek. Pain splinters through my face, exploding behind my eye. I\u2019m trembling. I can\u2019t help it. Something is very wrong with him and I never saw it coming. I plead, \u201cEdward, this isn\u2019t like you. You\u2014\u201d</p><p>He steps toward me and lifts my chin. I can\u2019t pull away from him. I\u2019ve pinned myself against the wall. There\u2019s nowhere to run. No way to escape. \u201cI\u2019m a forgiving person, Anna. I\u2019ll take you back. You don\u2019t even have to ask, but... Do. Not. Lie. To. Me.\u201d His hand squeezes my face hard as he bites off the last words staccato, practically spitting in my face.</p><p>My body is jacked up. Part of me wants to attack him in order to get the hell away. The other part of me is falling to pieces, ready to fall at his feet and sob, hoping to God that he isn\u2019t this monster he seems to be. I don\u2019t decide what to do. My body trumps my mind, and before I know what I\u2019m doing, I tear my face out of his hands and jerk my knee up between his legs. Edward sucks in air as he staggers back from me. I have enough room to get by. I dart for the front door, intending to run screaming into the street.</p><p>Before I manage to make it down the hall, Edward is behind me. I hear only the heavy thumping footfalls and my clamoring heart. Although the TV is blasting, I no longer hear it. My bare feet slip on the hallway floor as I race forward. The puddles that I tracked from the bathroom are still there, gleaming, and knock me off balance. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>All I can think is too slow, I\u2019m too slow. My lungs burn. It feels like I can\u2019t breathe. I want to scream, but I have no voice. It\u2019s like a nightmare, where I can\u2019t run fast enough. My heel hits the floor hard and I slip. Frantically, my arms swing as I try to regain my balance. In that moment, Edward catches my elbow and rips me back. I jerk to a stop and whirl around, my robe swirling at my hips. His fingers dig into my arms and it feels like he\u2019ll crush my bones. Edward\u2019s face is twisted with rage. His eyes are narrow and dark. Without warning, Edward releases me and throws me into the wall.</p><p>My head hits the plaster hard, but I don\u2019t feel it. Adrenaline is pumping through me. I should be able to toss a dumpster like a superhero, but I can barely stand up. Terror courses through my body, consuming me whole. It makes my movements erratic, like I can\u2019t decide what to do or when. I twitch against the wall, and then try to go for the front door again. Edward blocks me. He uses his body to pin me in place, this time guarding his assets more carefully.</p><p>\u201cWhen are you going to learn, Anna?\u201d he growls at me. Edward\u2019s knee pushes between mine, parting my robe. A sob bubbles up my throat, which seems to make him smile. He grips my wrists, slamming them to the wall above my head. I can\u2019t move.</p><p>I take a few breaths to steady myself and intend to scream FIRE at the top of my lungs, hoping James is home and that he can hear me over the TV. Last time James heard me scream, he came running. But before I can exhale, Edward\u2019s massive palm covers my mouth. I scream into his hand. I use my free hand to try and pry him off of me, but he doesn\u2019t move. I don\u2019t know what to do. I writhe beneath him, trying to break free. I can\u2019t stand it. My heart is racing so hard that it\u2019s going to explode. I don\u2019t think. I act. I listen to the crazy girl inside my head that\u2019s telling me to bite down and lock my jaw. I listen to her when she says to take my nails and shove them straight into Edward\u2019s eyes.</p> <p>I bite and scratch. Edward yells, and shoves me hard. I\u2019m flung across the hall and land hard on my hip. I don\u2019t look back to see him pressing his hand to his eye. I don\u2019t want to see the blood on his palm. I taste the coppery tang in my mouth. I know I made him bleed. I round the corner on my hands and knees and go to the kitchen to look for a weapon. Backing myself into the corner, I grab a knife off the counter. I\u2019m standing by the time Edward enters the room. He comes at me again, even though there\u2019s a knife in my hand. It\u2019s the big, sharp one that Emma uses to cut up chicken. I don\u2019t want to kill Emma\u2019s brother with her chicken knife, but I don\u2019t know what else to do. Part of me thinks he\u2019ll stop, but the more feral part of me senses that he\u2019ll never stop.</p><p>I clutch the knife harder. \u201cI swear to God, I\u2019ll stab you. Stay the fuck away from me!\u201d I yell at him, spitting his blood out onto the floor when it leaks into my mouth as I speak. A streak of his blood must be smeared across my face.</p><p>Edward laughs, like I\u2019m a child and he can do whatever the hell he wants. \u201cYou really intend to cut me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou really intend to rape me?\u201d</p><p>His jaw drops. Edward manages to look insulted. He steps toward me and presses his hand to his chest. \u201cRape you? That\u2019s what you think this is?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, you crazy fucking bastard,\u201d I growl, aiming the tip of the knife at his heart. I wonder if I should be aiming for his stomach, but I don\u2019t move. My elbows lock. If he comes at me... Oh God.</p><p>He talks to me like I\u2019m a child, too na\u00efve to understand his intentions. \u201cAnna, darling, put down the knife and we can talk about this. You obviously can\u2019t tell, but I wouldn\u2019t let anything happen to you. You\u2019re mine. I intend to keep things that way.\u201d He steps toward me. Lifting his hand, he says, \u201cGive it to me, now.\u201d</p><p>I press my body backwards, but hit the cabinets. The draw pulls bite into my bare legs. I\u2019m pretty sure my robe is hanging open, but can\u2019t look. I don\u2019t move. Edward\u2019s eyes lock with mine. He moves towards me. He\u2019s too close. I jab the knife at him when he\u2019s within an inch of me.</p><p>Edward stops. He lifts his hands like he surrenders. \u201cAnna, please. You know me. You know I wouldn\u2019t hurt you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen leave.\u201d My arms are starting the shake, but my hands hold onto the knife like my life depends on it.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t do that,\u201d he growls. \u201cI can\u2019t let you continue to act this way. Give me the knife or I\u2019ll take it from you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019ll have to kill me first\u2014\u201d</p><p>Edward rolls his eyes, \u201cYou are so damn dramatic.\u201d He lunges at me.</p><p>I don\u2019t want to stab him. He\u2019s my best friend\u2019s brother. It makes my arms turn to jelly when he slams into me. I hear him scream, but I don\u2019t know why. Edward grabs my wrist, but I don\u2019t let go of the knife. The blade is streaked with crimson. I watch it as Edward slams my hand against the counter, forcing me to drop the blade. It clatters as I watch in horror. Then, Edward reaches to pick it up. My pulse is pounding in my ears. My mind is screaming at me to run, while every muscle in my body is corded tight and bursting with panic.</p><p>I press myself against the cabinets and slip past him as he twists to grab the knife. I\u2019m almost out of the tiny kitchen, but Edward grabs me. Pulling me into his arms, he turns me to face the counter top and presses the knife to my neck. It\u2019s already slick with blood. I suck in air and go still in his arms. If I move, he\u2019ll slice my throat. I know he will. Tears roll down my cheeks and I can\u2019t stop them.</p><p>Edward hisses at me as he slams my head down on the counter. The knife resumes the position, pressed to the side of my throat. I feel his hips press against my bottom and feel how much he wants me. I sob, and beg him to stop, but he doesn\u2019t. I hear the zipper on his jeans slowly open.</p><p>I try to scream, but can\u2019t. His weight on my back makes it so I can barely breathe. I babble incoherent pleas as my eyes blur with tears. He doesn\u2019t answer me. Instead I feel my robe being torn away and my legs being forced apart. He presses himself against me, and stays like that for a moment. The feel of him against me makes me want to vomit. My mind flips on again, and I stop begging him to let me go. I sniffle as thoughts fly through my mind. I try to think of any plan to escape, but nothing is within reach. I can\u2019t hit him. The way he has me pinned is going to make me pass out. I can barely breathe. Edward\u2019s arm is crushing me facedown into the counter. His leg is between mine, holding them open and the knife is at the side of my throat.</p><p>Edward\u2019s voice fills with triumph. I feel something warm and slick from him slip onto my side. Out of the corner of my eye, I see a trail of red drip from his waist and onto mine. I must have cut him with the knife before. The wound on Edward\u2019s side is deep and a steady stream of blood flows from it, but not enough to stop him.</p><p>\u201cThis is for your own good, Anna.\u201d He sounds like he\u2019s enjoying this. I can almost see the smile on his face. He leans harder on my back and I feel the pressure increase, and all the air is forced out of my lungs.</p> <p>I try to scream, but can\u2019t. Tears overflow from my eyes and soak the counter. I open my mouth and try to yell, but it\u2019s barely a whisper. I tense and close my eyes, not wanting to be here, wishing to God that this isn\u2019t happening. I tune out his voice, not wanting to hear his words. He gloats that he\u2019s won, that he knew he\u2019d have me in the end. I\u2019m aware of his hands on my body, touching me in ways he shouldn\u2019t, as the world goes fuzzy at the edges. Blood pools under my face and gets in my eye. I don\u2019t blink. I don\u2019t writhe. He has me and there is nothing I can do. My heart feels like it has exploded. My body starts to go numb. His hand is on the back of my head holding me to the counter, while he leans harder on my back with his elbow. My arms dangle lifelessly at my sides. If he lets go, I\u2019ll fall to the floor.</p><p>When he moves his hips, I want to cry, but can\u2019t. No breath fills my lungs. I sag under him as he gets ready to push into me. Just as Edward\u2019s about to rape me, the knife disappears. Then the arm that\u2019s crushing my ribs is gone and my head falls to the side. I hear his voice\u2014Cole\u2014as I slip to the floor. I lay on my side and my eyes flutter open. One is caked with blood and won\u2019t focus.</p><p>It is Cole. I blink slowly, trying to focus. Cole disarmed Edward and is beating him. Edward is on the floor in front of the refrigerator, covering his face with his hands. He doesn\u2019t fight back. The knife is lodged in the wall next to the door way. Blood drips down the wallpaper in tiny red beads.</p><p>It takes me a moment to realize what\u2019s happening. It feels like time is moving so slowly. Cole\u2019s fist connects with Edwards ribs. Blood is everywhere\u2014on Edward, on Cole, and on me. My robe is ripped any laying next to my feet. I want to reach for it. I want to cover myself, but it looks like Cole is going to kill Edward. Every time he punches him, Edward\u2019s head slams back into the fridge. Blood is flowing from a head wound and from his side where I stabbed him.</p><p>I push myself up and feel like I\u2019m going to hurl. Before I fall, I catch Cole\u2019s arm as he\u2019s about to swing another punch into Edward\u2019s battered body.</p><p>\u201cStop,\u201d I manage to choke out. The muscles in Cole\u2019s arms bulge. I try to hold Cole back, but can\u2019t. I start to fall, and lean into Cole.</p><p>When he sees me, the expression on his face is filled with fear. \u201cAnna,\u201d he breathes, pressing his hands to my face. He pulls me to him and kisses my face. \u201cI thought\u2014\u201d his voice catches. \u201cI saw you on the counter, and him on top of you. There was so much blood. I thought he...\u201d</p><p>Tears steak my face. I can\u2019t stand the look in his eyes. I lean against his chest as I speak. \u201cHe didn\u2019t... I\u2019m okay. He didn\u2019t stab me.\u201d I lean all my weight against Cole. After a moment, he supports me so I don\u2019t fall over and pulls back to look at my side. Cole presses his fingers against my skin, wiping away the blood. \u201cI\u2019m not bleeding.\u201d</p><p>Before Cole has a chance to respond, the door flies open. Two cops come in with their weapons drawn. The whole thing looks wrong. It appears that Cole is the one who attacked, not Edward. They move between us, pulling me away. They give me a blanket and I realize that I\u2019m shivering, even though I don\u2019t feel cold. They mutter something about shock and call for an ambulance.</p><p>They move through the apartment quickly and spot Edward laying on the floor in a puddle of blood. They sit me on the couch and one officer stays with me. He speaks to me, but I can\u2019t focus. I pull the blanket tighter. I hear Edward\u2019s voice and fear shoots through me in a cold burst.</p><p>\u201cMiss,\u201d the officer says again. Slowly, I turn my face and look up at him. I squint, trying to focus, \u201cDo you know what happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I rasp. Everything feels like it\u2019s happening in slow motion. Every time I hear Edward\u2019s voice from the other room, I crawl out of my skin.</p><p>The cop watches me squirm on the couch, pulling the blanket tighter to my throat. \u201cWhich one of them gave you that bruise on your cheek?\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m falling apart inside. I can\u2019t hold myself together much longer. My voice shakes as I speak. \u201cEdward. He hit me. He wouldn\u2019t leave. He tried to...,\u201d I choke on the words, but can\u2019t manage to force them out. I stare unblinking at the kitchen wall. \u201cCole came and saved me.\u201d I look at the cop. Tears start to flow again and leak out of the corners of my eye. My voice is barely a whisper as I start to shiver uncontrollably. \u201cI need Cole.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Cole has been standing across the room. One cop is watching both of us. They don\u2019t want us talking to each other. Cole moves toward me, but the officer shakes his head. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. One more minute. The medics will be here and you can tell us what happened.\u201d</p><p>I nod and sadness sticks to my insides like syrup. I feel like I can\u2019t breathe. Cole steps toward me. He\u2019s shaking, probably with rage, but he says nothing to me. Cole\u2019s face is pinched. His arms are folded across his chest. Blood streaks his shirt with tiny beads splattered on his cheek. He looks older somehow. It\u2019s his eyes. They reflect his fear and it\u2019s all I can do to sit still without shivering. Guilt slams into me. I did this. I made this happen. Edward did this because I led him on. I had to do something, didn\u2019t I? My eyes sting. I blink and look at my hands as I twist them together.</p><p>The paramedics arrive and swamp me and Edward. They poke me, ask me things that I know\u2014like my name, when I was born, and that kind of thing. Then they ask what happened. I glance across the room, but Cole has been separated from me. He stands with the officers who arrived earlier with his back turned toward me. Cole\u2019s speaking, but his eyes keep cutting across the room to me when he looks over his shoulder. Edward\u2019s blood is on Cole\u2019s shirt. They probably think Cole stabbed Edward.</p><p>\u201cIt was me,\u201d I croak, trying to speak loudly, but I find that I can\u2019t. The officers look at me and nod. Their eyes say they\u2019ve seen this before. One smiles sadly at me and says that everything will be taken care of, to let the medics do their work.</p> <p>Cole speaks to me, his voice filled with something that breaks my heart. \u201cIt\u2019s all right, Anna. Let them look at you.\u201d</p><p>The paramedic next to me wants me to open my mouth. They check my throat and offer a rape kit, but I wasn\u2019t raped. Edward didn\u2019t get that far. I want them gone, but no one leaves. They ask me what happened. I tell them.</p><p>My story stays the same, but the guilt is killing me. \u201cI must have done something,\u201d I say to one of the medics. \u201cBut I don\u2019t know what.\u201d</p><p>The guy is well over six foot and looks like he could carry a walrus up a flight of stairs. Anger flashes in his eyes. His voice is firm, but gentle. \u201cThere is nothing, and I mean nothing, that you could have done to make this happen.\u201d I nod, but I don\u2019t know what I think. Cole is hurt. Edward is hurt. I\u2019m hurt. I stabbed Emma\u2019s brother. I\u2019m going to lose my best friend.</p><p>My head feels hot and then cold. I shiver and the world goes fuzzy. Heat travels up my body in a wave and the world goes black.</p> <p>CHAPTER 6</p><p>The first thing I notice is the hard bed under my back. My fingers bunch the waffle-weave blanket in my hands. I recognize the texture. Between that and the scent of disinfectants, I know where I am. I peel my eyes open and look around the hospital room. I hate hospitals. I blink slowly and the world comes into focus.</p><p>Cole is sitting next to my bed, his arm dangling over the rail, stroking my cheek. \u201cHey,\u201d he says, and offers a weak smile. His hand feels so warm. I shiver and want to pull him into the bed with me. I want his arms around me. I want to feel safe, but I\u2019m too weak to move.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d I say back, confused. I don\u2019t know what happened. I don\u2019t remember getting here.</p><p>Cole sees the questions in my eyes and says, \u201cYou went through a lot. They wanted to check to make sure nothing was broken, and then you passed out. Nothing\u2019s broken, but you do have a sprained ankle.\u201d He watches me, his eyes holding mine. I see the remorse in his eyes. He wants to say, I\u2019m sorry I wasn\u2019t there. I\u2019m sorry I couldn\u2019t protect you.</p><p>But he did. We both feel guilt that we shouldn\u2019t feel. I wish I could take that away from him. He saved me. I press Cole\u2019s palm to my cheek and lean into his hand. \u201cIf you didn\u2019t come...\u201d I take a deep breath, \u201cHow\u2019d you know?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou were late and didn\u2019t answer your phone. Emma texted and said you were grabbing suit, and that she had to leave you. Then, when you didn\u2019t show, I thought something was wrong. I raced over there and found him\u2014\u201d Cole\u2019s jaw tenses, and he stops speaking. He works his jaw for a moment and finally says, \u201cWhen I saw you, you weren\u2019t moving. You were hanging there, limp. There was blood everywhere. My God, Anna, I thought he killed you.\u201d Cole\u2019s voice tightens as he speaks. It\u2019s barely audible by the time he\u2019s done. He rubs his hand across my cheek and takes a breath to steady himself. His gaze locks with mine. \u201cI love you, Anna. I thought I lost you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t,\u201d I say, my voice still raspy. \u201cI\u2019m right here. I\u2019m not going anywhere, dude.\u201d I grin at him, but my face hurts.</p><p>\u201cStop cracking jokes, Lamore. You\u2019ve got a couple of stitches in your cheek. You\u2019re not supposed to aggravate it.\u201d</p><p>I nod. \u201cSo, I have to ask how you kept my parents away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no force on earth that could do that. They were here fretting and pacing each other into a hysterical mess. I sent them to the cafeteria to get coffee. They\u2019ll be back in a minute.\u201d</p><p>I lean back into the flat plastic pillow and smile at him. It\u2019s a doped-up dreamy kind of smile. \u201cI love you, Cole.\u201d</p><p>He opens his mouth to say something, but there\u2019s a knock at the door. The doctor comes in. He speaks to me and explains a few things and is gone again.</p><p>Before he leaves the room, I ask, \u201cCan I go home?\u201d I don\u2019t want to stay here a second longer than I need to.</p> <p>The doctor looks back at me and nods. \u201cAs long as you have some help, yes. Stay off your feet for a few days until the ankle mends. No strenuous activities.\u201d His eyes cut to Cole when he says it, which makes me blush like my face caught fire. The doctor smiles and says to Cole, \u201cTake care of her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will,\u201d Cole replies. His blue eyes drift to me and he says, \u201cI\u2019ll always take care of you.\u201d</p><p>Things feel different after the attack. I stay at Cole\u2019s. He pushes back the court date a week, until I recover. I look like hell. My face has been beaten and is all shades of awesome. My entire body is sore, aching in places I didn\u2019t even know I had. Cole keeps giving me ice packs and heating pads. I can\u2019t believe he talked my parents into staying at his place, but he did.</p><p>I\u2019m laying on his couch, with a pillow under my head, when Emma comes over. She hands Cole a huge bouquet of mums for me. They\u2019re so big that I can\u2019t see her when she walks through the door. When Cole takes the flowers from her, Em sees me for the first time and gasps. Her fingers press to her lips as she mashes them into a thin line.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not supposed to tell people they look like hell, Em.\u201d I want to smile, but I can\u2019t. I pull up the blanket and twirl the fringes under my fingers. I\u2019m worried she\u2019ll hate me. Cole assured me that she wouldn\u2019t, but I\u2019m still worried. I can\u2019t undo any of this. I wish it never happened. Before I can say another word, Emma grabs my hands and starts talking.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry, Anna. I didn\u2019t know. I swear to God that I didn\u2019t\u2014\u201d Emma can\u2019t stop apologizing. Grief lines her face. Cole perches behind her on a stool. He flips through a magazine like he isn\u2019t listening, but I know that he is.</p><p>I cut her off, \u201cThere was no way for you to know. I didn\u2019t know. Nobody did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI should have known. He\u2019s my goddamn twin,\u201d she rubs her eyes with the heel of her hand. Emma\u2019s beautiful face is pinched, lining her forehead with wrinkles. \u201cI should have known.\u201d</p><p>I know how she feels. I feel the same way. I don\u2019t know why I didn\u2019t see it before, why I kept dismissing the warning signs. They were there, clear as glass, and I ignored them. We both ignored them.</p><p>Cole turns the page of his magazine, and doesn\u2019t look up. \u201cHis mistakes are his alone. You didn\u2019t do this to her, Emma. Edward did.\u201d Emma turns to him, her mouth hanging open.</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>Cole shakes his head, \u201cBut nothing. You had nothing to do with this. From the moment I met you, you\u2019ve been nothing but a great friend to Anna.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told her you were creepy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d he says. \u201cYou were looking out for her. You sure as hell wouldn\u2019t have done this to her. Blame the person who actually did it. He\u2019s not the guy you thought he was. Blood is strange like that. You\u2019d think the apple doesn\u2019t fall far from the tree, but some apples do. They roll so far away that they they\u2019re nothing like the rest of their family.\u201d Cole\u2019s tone is firm. He\u2019s speaking about himself as much as Edward. I feel the pain in his voice. I want to throw my arms around him. I hate hearing him speak about his father, but Emma needs to hear this, so he says it. \u201cBlood or not\u2014twin or not\u2014he\u2019s not you.\u201d</p><p>Emma\u2019s eyes fill with tears. It\u2019s what she needs to hear. She looks back at me and says, \u201cYou\u2019re my best friend. You always have been...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI always will be.\u201d</p><p>Emma and I share a snot-filled cry. Cole left the room at some point after we use an entire box of tissues. Emma dabs her dark eyes. \u201cI\u2019m not sure if my timing is crap or not, so I\u2019m just going to tell you.\u201d She takes a breath and pushes her dark hair over her shoulder. \u201cI met someone.\u201d</p><p>My brows inch up my face. \u201cReally? Who?\u201d Emma is never serious about anyone, but I can tell in the way her posture shifts, in the way her shoulders shrink in, that this is important to her and she\u2019s afraid of what I\u2019ll think. \u201cTell me, Em. Who is he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou already know him.\u201d She presses her lips together for a moment. After taking a deep breath, she says his name. \u201cJessie. After you two broke up, I saw him. We talked about you for a while, and then... I don\u2019t know what happened. He irritates the hell out of me, but I like him. A lot. I didn\u2019t want to date him until I told you about it, but then this happened and I didn\u2019t see you for a while.\u201d She glances up at me. \u201cAre you mad?\u201d</p><p>I forget myself and smile. \u201cNo, that\u2019s wonderful! I felt so bad for him. He\u2019s so nice, but Cole... I wanted Cole. I\u2019m happy for you, Em. I really am.\u201d</p><p>She talks to me for a while longer and tells me about Jessie, about why she likes him. She\u2019s so excited that it\u2019s hard not to feel excited, too. Then she starts talking about her internship and the paper. \u201cThen we ran this story on Sottero. Did you see it?\u201d I shake my head. Emma looks around for Cole, and leans in, whispering, \u201cI thought not. Apparently, it\u2019s gotten around her social circles that she\u2019s a two-faced bitch thanks to a loud-mouthed intern that quit a little while back.\u201d She winks at me and smiles, like it\u2019s wonderful. \u201cHer clients don\u2019t want to have anything to do with her. She\u2019s been an icon for years. The article was about how the mighty fall from grace. A few other names were in there too. It was a business piece on the importance of being genuine and remembering where your next paycheck is coming from. It seems that the arrogant fall faster and harder than anyone. I guess the article kind of double-damned her.\u201d She smiles at me. \u201cI thought you\u2019d like that.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>At first, I think I do.

How could you not be happy that she got hers?\u201d</p><p>I shrug. \u201cI don\u2019t know. Maybe my brain is broken, but I can\u2019t take joy in someone else\u2019s misery, even if it is Sottero\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>Cole\u2019s voice cuts through the room, \u201cAnd that\u2019s why I love you.\u201d He walks up behind me and kisses the top of my head.</p> <p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Emma protests, \u201cbut Sottero had it coming. You can\u2019t be a heinous bitch for two decades and not have it come back to bite you on the ass. Besides, she dropped the lawsuit, right?\u201d</p><p>Cole shakes his head, \u201cNo, she didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Emma\u2019s jaw drops as her eyes widen. \u201cWhat? Is she insane?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s playing the victim, Em.\u201d I say. \u201cIf she gets the press to portray her in that light, then it makes sense why she\u2019s been so bitter and fucked-up over the years. All will be forgiven. Kiss, kiss and all that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Em replies, looking shocked. \u201cYou think that\u2019s her goal?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI have no clue what her goal is,\u201d Cole mutters. \u201cShe\u2019s Sophia. This is typical Sophia.\u201d</p><p>I shake my head, \u201cIt doesn\u2019t seem like she wants money. She has plenty of that...\u201d</p><p>Cole says, \u201cRevenge. That\u2019s what she wants. She wants to rip out my guts, the way I ripped out hers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cShe thought I was loaded. She felt duped, Anna. Sophia was slightly off-balance before, but now, with the papers running stories about her\u2014she\u2019s like a rabid dog jumping at my throat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d Em says and shrinks back into the couch next to me, obviously feeling somewhat responsible for the increase in Sophia\u2019s crazy levels.</p> <p>Cole says, \u201cIt\u2019s not your fault. It\u2019s your job. Besides, Sophia made her decisions and I made mine.\u201d Cole shifts his weight. He looks at me for half a beat and then his eyes shift back to Em. \u201cHow would you like to run a story for me?\u201d</p><p>Em\u2019s dark eyebrow lifts. He\u2019s caught her attention. \u201cWhat\u2019d you have in mind?\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 7</p><p>My parents insist on checking in with me so frequently that my eye twitches. My cell rings and I pick it up. \u201cI\u2019m still fine, Ma. Cole\u2019s taking good care of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank God!\u201d She blares into the phone. I pull it back from ear a little, so I don\u2019t go deaf. Ma is one of those people who talks louder on a cell phone. She acts like it\u2019s a tin can on a string and practically screams into the thing. \u201cI\u2019m having palpitations out here worrying about you. I can\u2019t stand you living so far away. Come home, Anna. Your old room is\u2014\u201d</p><p>I groan, \u201cMa, I\u2019m fine. Really. And what happened could have happened anywhere. It\u2019s not like the whole stalker thing was random. He went to your house for Chrissakes. He seemed sane to you, too.\u201d I shouldn\u2019t have said it. Reminding her of her conversation with Edward is like a kick to the gut. Apparently his obsession with me was worse than anyone thought. When the police starting questioning my family, my Ma recognized him.</p><p>Ma\u2019s voice shrinks back to a muffle. \u201cI didn\u2019t know, honey. I swear to God, I had no idea that he\u2014\u201d</p><p>I cut her off, \u201cThat\u2019s the point. Nobody knew and it could have happened anywhere. I\u2019m safe here, Ma. I\u2019ll be at Cole\u2019s for a few more days and then I\u2019ll move back in with Emma.\u201d</p> <p>I don\u2019t pull the phone back in time for the wave of tyrannical threats that spew from the tiny speaker. I open my mouth to respond, but Cole snatches the phone from my hand.</p><p>He speaks over Ma, \u201cAnna\u2019s not going anywhere, Mrs. Lamore.\u201d He says it so calmly, so certainly. I cock my head at him and feel extra stubborn. I don\u2019t doubt for a second that he thinks I\u2019m staying here indefinitely, but I feel like I need to get on with my life. It feels like I\u2019m hiding here.</p><p>I can still hear Ma yelling back, \u201cShe better not!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI assure you, she is staying here with me, and if she insists on leaving, I will deposit her on your doorstep. She\u2019s not going anywhere alone until Edward is behind bars. You have my word on that.\u201d Edward\u2019s out on bail, which is why things are kind of hard right now. No one wants to leave me alone so that he can take another go at me.</p><p>Ma\u2019s voice lowers and I can\u2019t make out what she\u2019s saying. Cole avoids my angry gaze until he hangs up.</p><p>Cole sighs and hands me back my phone. \u201cWhen were you going to tell me this marvelous plan?\u201d</p><p>I squirm on the couch and pull my knees into my chest. \u201cNever.\u201d I knew he wouldn\u2019t like it.</p><p>\u201cI thought so.\u201d He sits down next to me. \u201cYou can do anything you want, but it\u2019s so far from smart that I can\u2019t let you go back there. He\u2019s out on bail. Edward could come after you again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe won\u2019t\u201d I say, staring straight ahead.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCole,\u201d I take a breath, and look at him. \u201cI don\u2019t want to hide for the rest of my life. I want to get on with things and that means going back to normal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if normal where here, with me?\u201d His eyes are like twin gems, deep and clear. His voice is so sincere, so loving. Cole hasn\u2019t mentioned the proposal since that night. Too many things happened.</p><p>My lips tug into a small smile. I lean my head against his shoulder. \u201cTell me what that would look like. Things are changing right now. I don\u2019t even know what tomorrow will be like and neither do you. It makes it hard to dream right now.\u201d</p><p>His arms wrap around me. \u201cAll I do is dream, right now. I dream about having you in my bed every night and seeing your beautiful face every morning. I dream about that lawsuit vanishing and having that part of my life over. I dream of being someone else\u2019s son, with someone else\u2019s name...\u201d he strokes my hair as I listen to him. He breathes, \u201cAll I do is dream. I\u2019m living in a fantasy world as long as you\u2019re next to me. I can\u2019t stand the thought of you leaving.\u201d</p><p>Silence fills the room. It\u2019s not the awkward kind, it\u2019s the peaceful kind. Cole wraps his arms around me tighter and holds me like that for a second. When he moves to release me and get up, I stop him. My fingers brush his forearms and press him against me. \u201cHope is important, Cole. Don\u2019t feel bad about that. As for your name, have you thought about what you want to change it to?\u201d</p><p>He looks down at me and smiles. \u201cDude. You inspired me and I had to pick that one. People can call me Mr. Dude, the artist.\u201d</p><p>I laugh way too loud and smack his arm. \u201cYou can\u2019t change your last name to Dude! Besides, if I said yes, that\u2019d make me Mrs. Dude and I am so not doing that.\u201d</p><p>Cole grins. He sits and pulls me onto his lap. I turn to face him. His face is a breath from mine. \u201cOh? So you\u2019ve thought about that a little bit, have you?\u201d</p><p>I nod. \u201cA little bit.\u201d My heart is pounding.</p><p>\u201cAnd that\u2019s the only conclusion you\u2019ve made?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a pretty good conclusion, right? There\u2019s no way in hell people are going to call me Anna Dude.\u201d I laugh and he smiles. It makes the corners of his eyes crinkle the way I Iove.</p><p>\u201cSo, then what would you have me do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPick a name that suits you, one that makes sense, and that you\u2019d be happy to have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure there is a name like that, Anna.\u201d</p><p>I want to smile, but I try to hide it. Taking his face in my hands, I say, \u201cLamore.\u201d I swallow hard, letting the idea sink in. I take a breath. The feeling that I\u2019m falling won\u2019t hush. My stomach is in my throat. \u201cI don\u2019t know what tomorrow will bring, but I know I want you in my life. I like my last name and what it stands for. Lamore\u2019s think love is worth fighting for, that love is worth more than life, that\u2014\u201d</p><p>He cuts me off with a kiss. Cole\u2019s lips press hard against mine and he pulls away grinning. \u201cI would love to take your name. Wedding or not.\u201d He\u2019s not certain that I\u2019ve accepted his proposal.</p><p>\u201cOh, there\u2019ll be a wedding. I thought I had to know everything before I got married. I thought that my life was going to be laid out for me, that I\u2019d go to college, graduate, get a job, get married, have kids\u2014in that order\u2014but it didn\u2019t happen like that. I don\u2019t have much, but what\u2019s mine is yours...\u201d he\u2019s still quiet, watching me. I want to choke or run or jump out the window. I blabber on, adding, \u201cIf you still want me.\u201d</p><p>Cole\u2019s eyes remain locked on mine. Without a word he stands up, with me on his lap. I scream as he chucks me in the air and catches me. He makes a very loud, happy, sound that almost sounds like a whoop, and whirls around with me in his arms, spinning in circles. We both laugh and scream. I cling to his chest and close my eyes, but it doesn\u2019t stop the joy from bursting like fireworks inside of me. By the time he falls onto the couch, my face hurts from smiling so hard.</p><p>I giggle, \u201cMr. Lamore, you\u2019re going to be a handful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLikewise, Mrs. Lamore.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 8</p><p>\u201cAre you sure that you want me to run this, Cole? It kind of sets things in stone.\u201d</p><p>He nods, his dark hair falling forward as he moves. \u201cIt\u2019s a warning shot. She needs to see it coming.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d I ask. \u201cSottero?\u201d</p><p>He nods. \u201cShe thinks that I won\u2019t fight back because I never have, because I\u2019ll lose my name. She knows my past and what that fucking name cost me.\u201d He glances up at Emma. \u201cSorry\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t apologize to me. I swear like a sailor. Anna made me tone it down so I don\u2019t offend her virgin ears.\u201d Emma flips her dark curtain of silky hair over her shoulder. Somehow she always manages to have this sleek look that could make a Pantene model jealous.</p><p>My face flames red, \u201cMy ears are not virgins.\u201d I hiss, and then realize it sounds weird and grin rather stupidly.</p><p>Cole\u2019s eyebrow lifts, \u201cWe\u2019ll need to discuss that later, Miss Lamore.\u201d I smack his arm.</p><p>We\u2019re sitting in Emma\u2019s apartment. It\u2019s the first time that I\u2019ve been back home since the day Edward attacked me. Em cleaned the place up. There\u2019s no blood, but the smells and the way the light cuts through the blinds is identical. I\u2019m glad Cole didn\u2019t want me to stay here. I think I wanted to do it to prove a point\u2014that Edward didn\u2019t break my brain, that I\u2019m not afraid. The thing is, I am, but the fear has changed. I know who he is and what he was doing now. Instead of feeling the choking panic, I feel jittery and stressed. It\u2019s like a nightmare that surfaces during daylight, even though it was scary when it happened, in the light of day the cold tentacles of fear are still laced around my throat. I shiver and Cole pulls me closer to him. We are sitting at the breakfast bar and Em is across from us on the couch.</p><p>Emma ignores our banter. \u201cWell, if you\u2019re sure. Once the article is submitted, I can\u2019t take it back. That\u2019s all I\u2019m saying.\u201d She waits, watching Cole. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDo it.\u201d</p><p>The article is short. It mentions that famed photographer Cole Stevens is changing his last name. While it might seem like a public interest story to everyone else, to Sophia it\u2019s a bomb. It\u2019s telling her to drop her lawsuit, that Cole is going to fight back, and that she will lose. It\u2019s a very gentle, tactful way to warn her to back down. He surprises me with that, especially since Sophia is so vicious.</p><p>The article runs the day before the rescheduled hearing. I lift the paper and am surprised at the prominent location. The article is small, but Sottero v. Stevens has been in the papers on and off for a while now. I suppose that\u2019s good, that there\u2019s no way she\u2019ll miss it.</p><p>Cole sees me sitting on the couch with the paper. He has a cup of coffee in his hand. He lifts it to his lips and sips it slowly before asking, \u201cWell? Do you think that was worth doing?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. Sophia seems kind of crazy. No one else will know what this means, but she will.\u201d I twiddle the edge of the paper between my fingers and look over it at him. \u201cWhat do you want her to do, exactly?\u201d</p><p>Cole takes a deep breath and sits at the table. The open floorplan makes it feel like he\u2019s not that far away. The living room bumps up against the dining room, and the couch where I\u2019m sitting is positioned in between. \u201cI want her to drop the lawsuit, but I don\u2019t think that\u2019ll happen.\u201d He looks at the black liquid in his mug. \u201cYa know, I can\u2019t help but notice that you didn\u2019t accept my proposal until after it was confirmed that I\u2019d lose everything.\u201d He looks up at me. \u201cI wasn\u2019t going to fight back, they seized my assets, and I lost many of my clients, and then you decided to stick around.\u201d He sounds like he can\u2019t believe it. He looks at me from under his brow, the steaming cup in his hand.</p><p>His tone worries me. It makes my stomach clench and twist. \u201cMoney doesn\u2019t matter to me, Cole. You have to know that by now. All my life, it\u2019s been this poison hanging over my head. I take what I need and nothing more.\u201d I shrug away the defensive feeling that\u2019s coming over me. \u201cI just don\u2019t want it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re afraid of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d I say honestly. \u201cThere\u2019s a duality with money, like you can chose to have money or love, but you can\u2019t have both. They negate each other, or at least it seems that way to me. So yeah, maybe your money terrifies me a little bit.\u201d I look up at him. The expression in his dark eyes is difficult to read. I can\u2019t tell if I offended or amazed him. Funny how those look so similar sometimes.</p> <p>Cole\u2019s eyes lower. He looks at his mug as he speaks. \u201cThat\u2019s part of the reason why I didn\u2019t fight back with Sottero. I really didn\u2019t want to. I thought I was being like my father, crushing a woman I already shattered. I never told Sophia that I was disinherited before I proposed to her. I couldn\u2019t, and she had no idea. It hit her like a train. The ring wasn\u2019t even taken out of the box. She slapped it from my hand, put it under her car, and ran it over. The look she gave me, Anna\u2014damn\u2014for the longest time I thought I deserved whatever she threw my way. My fortune, all of it was made because she inspired me in the first place.\u201d</p><p>A string of images form in my mind. A young Cole returning from the army, wearing that uniform. The Tiffany\u2019s box that was battered and locked in his safe. I blink these things away. They\u2019re his ghosts and I wish they didn\u2019t haunt him, but they do. I\u2019m quiet for a moment and then something he\u2019d said to me clicks into place. He owes her. He said it. He thinks that he\u2019s indebted to her in a way he can\u2019t repay. My mouth hangs open for a second and I think I understand. \u201cShe gave you your camera?\u201d</p><p>He nods. \u201cAfter I came back from the military, I was listless. I had nothing to do and nowhere to live. Sophia thought that I was on an international vacation for four years. I didn\u2019t correct her. I couldn\u2019t. She thought that I had no job because of my status, that I was a playboy like the papers made me out to be.\u201d His eyes flick up to me. \u201cMaybe I shouldn\u2019t be talking about this, but I wanted you to know how I felt about it. I deserved what I got from Sophia, as far as I was concerned. I did fuck her over, in a manner of speaking. And the gag on speaking about the agreement to use my name and my disownment made it so I couldn\u2019t respond. I deserve this Anna.\u201d The way he says it makes my heart ache. I slip off the couch and hobble over to him. Cole\u2019s eyes seek mine, looking for answers that he can\u2019t find.</p><p>I sit in the chair next to him and take his hands in mine. \u201cListen, I don\u2019t pretend to know what\u2019s right and what\u2019s wrong here. I hear the guilt in your voice when you talk about her, but Cole, I just don\u2019t see it. Even if you led her on to think you were still the heir\u2014which I don\u2019t think you did\u2014it\u2019s been twenty years. She should have let it go by now. Even if she was burned, it\u2019s unthinkable to stay mad this long.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought she loved me, Anna,\u201d he says, but I can hear it. He means, Will you leave me, too? Have I deceived you so gravely that you\u2019ll crush me as well?</p><p>The thread of insecurity is just that, a tiny string that tugs at Cole\u2019s past and connects to his present. I want to snap it. I want to cut that thread and let things fall where they may. \u201cThere\u2019s nowhere I\u2019d rather be right now, than here with you. I\u2019m not going anywhere. And if there\u2019s ever a time that we have too much money, that it\u2019s getting between us, we\u2019ll fix it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll give it away. Cole, this is about us, now. I\u2019m not Sophia. I want you for you\u2014all of your kinky, sophisticated, sexy self\u2014I want you. Nothing will ever change my mind. You think I\u2019d share my name with just anyone?\u201d I grin at him.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re too good for me.\u201d</p><p>I laugh. \u201cI\u2019d say the same thing about you. Apparently we both make each other better. Isn\u2019t that what love is all about? It seems we stumbled on the fairytale without even trying.\u201d</p><p>Cole smiles at me and something changes. I hear it in his voice when he speaks, \u201cSo, how far do you want to push this lawsuit? You want to just get her to back off or what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSophia\u2019s reputation is hanging by a thread. I think that\u2019ll do the most damage, if you want to do damage.\u201d I think about Sophia and how horrible she is, how incredible arrogant and bitchy she acts. Her clients are leaving her. They can\u2019t get away fast enough. One spark will ruin what she has left.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s see where we stand tomorrow and decide from there.\u201d Cole puts his coffee down and pulls me onto his lap. He kisses the side of my face, and then holds me tight. I love every second of it.</p><p>CHAPTER 9</p> <p>\u201cMiss Lamore, you mean to tell me that you have never seen any photographs or negatives of my client, Ms. Sottero, wearing this ring?\u201d The lawyer is as nasty as Sophia. She\u2019s a middle-aged lady with her dark blonde hair tied in a tight chignon at the base of her neck. Her gray suit fits her bean-pole body like a glove.</p><p>I shake my head and repeat myself, \u201cNo. I told you already.\u201d Cole\u2019s lawyer told me not to lie on the stand and I\u2019m not. I didn\u2019t see Sophia in any recognizable state, on a photograph or negative wearing that ring. I saw a naked chick on canvas wearing that ring.</p><p>The lawyer is exasperated. She comes at me again, her perfect face cracking with lines of fury. She presses her palms together. I look at the judge for a second, but he seems bored. The old guy is looking at something in front of him. I wonder what it is before I look back at Blondie. \u201cMiss Lamore. May I remind you that you are under oath?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou already have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen, I must ask you to tell the truth. For the last time, did you or did you not see this ring in a photograph or negative of Sophia Sottero while you were in Cole Steven\u2019s apartment?\u201d Blondie presses her pointer fingers to her lips and stares at me. If her eyes had lasers, I\u2019d be dead.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I say fervently, \u201cI did not.\u201d I look to my lawyer who squashes Blondie\u2019s next needling of me since my answer is still no.</p><p>\u201cVery well, Miss Lamore. Do you care to tell me how or why you recognized the ring my client was wearing the day you quit your internship at Sottero?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy does this matter?\u201d I blurt out.</p><p>Blondie opens her mouth to speak, but Cole\u2019s lawyer is on her feet. They quibble back and forth and eventually Cole\u2019s lawyer wins. I glance at Sophia. She looks mortified. I assume that Cole doesn\u2019t let his lawyer off the leash, ever.</p><p>\u201cEnough,\u201d the judge utters. \u201cIf you have no further questions of this witness, that pertain to this case, she may be excused.\u201d</p><p>Blondie bites her lip and returns to her seat. The judge hurries me off. I leave the stand and exit the courtroom. Reporters aren\u2019t allowed near the courtroom, but they are close enough to snap pictures of me as I walk out. Ignoring them, I turn and walk the other way.</p><p>My heart is thumping. I\u2019m lucky she didn\u2019t ask the questions differently. Sottero must have thought I saw something else. Maybe she doesn\u2019t know her photographs are paintings? I think about things as I stroll through the halls. I don\u2019t know how much time has passed, but I\u2019m aware that I lapped the building as I approach the ladies room. I don\u2019t know how much longer Cole will be in there today. I walk into the ladies room to check my make-up. My eyes itch like crazy. The building has that old musty scent that makes my eyes water. I stand in front of the mirror trying to rub my eyes without messing up my eyeliner and mascara. I give up and rub like crazy, smearing one eye. After it stops tearing, I take a few things from my purse, intending on fixing it when I hear Sophia\u2019s voice behind me.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe you perjured yourself for him.\u201d Her voice is flat, but I know she\u2019s livid. Sophia isn\u2019t supposed to talk to me, but she doesn\u2019t seem to care. \u201cI know you saw that ring in those portraits.\u201d</p><p>I turn to her, half my face rubbed clean of make-up. \u201cWhy do you even care? It\u2019s not like...\u201d those pictures matter anymore. I pause. It is like that. She wants those pictures. \u201cIs that what this is about? Is that why you\u2019re trying to seize all of his property, for those pictures?\u201d</p><p>Her dark eyes meet mine and don\u2019t stray. \u201cI\u2019ll hang you for this. Every single person of importance in Manhattan will believe whatever I tell them about you. It was bad enough when your hysterical boyfriend came to me about your relationship with Cole and I called the dean. I thought he was using you. I didn\u2019t realize you were so devious, Anna dear.\u201d</p><p>Rage shots through me. She did that? Sophia called the dean and cost me my internship. I want to slap Edward. He completely fucked up my life. Was there someone he didn\u2019t talk to? Furious, I hiss, \u201cDevious? What is it that I was trying to do? Bed a man you broke?\u201d</p><p>She laughs, \u201cAs if anyone could break that man\u2019s heart. He doesn\u2019t have one, Anna. Why do you think I\u2019m standing here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you\u2019re a money grubbing bitch.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She snarls, \u201cHe took everything from me. He\u2019ll do the same to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you think that I\u2019m listening to you again, you\u2019re mistaken. I only do stupid once per person. Sorry, you used your turn already.\u201d</p><p>Sophia\u2019s eyes burn a hole in my face. \u201cWhat will it take? A cut? You want his money? Fine. Consider it done. I\u2019ve spent the past twenty years trying to erase that man and he won\u2019t surrender the only thing I want.\u201d</p><p>I stare at her. \u201cCole\u2019s changing his name. There\u2019s nothing stopping him from crushing you. He\u2019s not going to let you win. Not this time.\u201d I toss my make-up back into my purse, and turn for the door. Sophia grabs my elbow. I jerk to a stop. When I turn back to look at her, she\u2019s in my face.</p> <p>\u201cThose pictures will destroy me. I built my name around being opposed to trash like that. I can\u2019t be seen modeling in one of Cole\u2019s risqu\u00e9 pieces. Find it, give it to me, and this is over.\u201d</p><p>I yank my arm back. \u201cBeing a two-faced bitch is your own damn fault. If people find out, good for them.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 10</p><p>I\u2019m sitting with Cole. We are at his favorite restaurant for dinner. It\u2019s quiet tonight. There are a scattering of people at the tables around us. They lean in close and speak softly. The candlelight flickers between us, highlighting his beautiful face. I\u2019m wearing a little black dress with my glittering Chucks. It earned us strange looks when we walked in, but my foot is still swollen. When I hobbled, holding onto Cole\u2019s arm, to our table, the waiter made that ah-ha face. No one appreciates juxtaposition in attire, except hobos and artists. Cole smiles at me.</p><p>After we\u2019re seated, I look at my hands and then back up at his face. \u201cI know we said we wouldn\u2019t talk about court tonight, but I need to tell you something.\u201d I haven\u2019t seen Cole since this afternoon. I didn\u2019t get to tell him what transpired between me and Sophia. \u201cIt\u2019s the paintings. She wants them.\u201d</p> <p>He has a wine glass in his hand. He stops, mid-sip, and his mouth falls open. He chokes out the words, \u201cWhat? Why would she...?\u201d he falls quiet and then nods, placing his glass back on the table. He shakes his head. \u201cI can\u2019t believe this. All this time, she wanted those pictures. Is that what she\u2019s been after?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCole, I don\u2019t understand why she even wants them. It\u2019s not like anyone would know it was her. They were taken twenty years ago. Not to be mean, but she doesn\u2019t look the same anymore and with her anti-smut campaign, no one would think it was her anyway.\u201d</p><p>Cole smiles softly, shaking his head. His dark hair moves like it\u2019s caught in a breeze. I want to run my fingers through his hair and tug. However, I manage to remain in my seat and keep my hands to myself. He explains, \u201cThe original images showed her face. When I processed them and put them onto canvas, I altered the pictures to what you saw. They were supposed to be a wedding gift.\u201d He smiles sheepishly. \u201cYeah, I stopped planning ahead after that. Anyway, Sophia never saw the images, but she knows what we shot. What you saw, well, those weren\u2019t the original crop lines. Sophia doesn\u2019t know what I have or what I don\u2019t\u2014she\u2019s guessing\u2014and after you mentioned that ring, she thinks you saw the portraits and assumed the worst.\u201d</p><p>An idea bumps around in my mind like a ping pong ball. It jumps back and forth, forming a cohesive plan. It pulls a smile across my lips. I lean forward and rub my palms together like an evil villain. \u201cYou want to freak her out and shut her up at the same time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re eyes are glittering in a savage, blood-thirsty way, Lamore. You\u2019re a little bit scary right now.\u201d Cole smirks as he says it. His foot gently brushes my good ankle and he winks at me. I smile back.</p><p>\u201cWhat if you did a gallery show with those portraits\u2014the version you showed me\u2014as the center pieces? The unseen, early work of Cole Stevens. It could be the last show you do before you change your name. We could hype the hell out of it. People would swamp to it, including the media. Sottero would wet herself, until she shows up and sees what you did, which is spectacular by the way.\u201d I grin at him and tap my fingertips together. Maybe it\u2019s not diabolical, but it would get rid of her. Plus, it gives the world a glimpse of the Cole that I think is utterly fantastic. \u201cMaybe she\u2019ll buy them all. It\u2019s the only way to make sure no one sees them again.\u201d</p> <p>Cole stares at me. I can\u2019t tell what he thinks. Sometimes I wonder if he was made without a revenge bone. I think I have two. They\u2019re both pretty small and weak, but when put together, they can be kick ass. Besides, Sophia needs to get over herself. She needs to see that she\u2019s a hypocritical idiot. I know she\u2019ll love those paintings, as much as I know she never saw them.</p><p>\u201cWhen?\u201d he finally asks. The waiter comes by with our order. The food smells heavenly.</p><p>After the waiter leaves, I say, \u201cThis weekend. It gives us a few days to pull things together. I can alert Em and she can tell the rest of the news people. I\u2019m not sure about the gallery...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can handle that,\u201d he says cutting into a huge steak.</p><p>\u201cAnd I want to design the invitations,\u201d I\u2019m giddy, bouncing up and down in my seat. I know exactly what I\u2019ll do. I\u2019ll use the left side of the purple painting that shows the curves of her waist and chest, but nothing else. They\u2019ll be elegant, black and white, with a touch of purple. The invitation will be written on sheer rice paper, and attached on top of the gallery image with a purple ribbon. Sophia will recognize it, but no one else will.</p><p>\u201cRemind me never to cross you,\u201d Cole mutters, looking up at me.</p><p>\u201cDude, it\u2019s been twenty years. It\u2019s time for Sophia to learn her lesson already.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 11</p> <p>The gallery is chic. That\u2019s the only way to describe it. The walls stretch up into a dark copper ceiling. The foyer walls are done in midnight blue with thick, flocked wallpaper that makes me want to reach out and touch the velvet. The color combination makes the place feel warm and posh. The way the light bounces softly on the ceiling gives the illusion of candlelight, but without the flicker. Once inside, there is a myriad of walls with different pieces of Cole\u2019s work hanging on each one. A single spotlight accents his art.</p><p>The series of works of Sottero line the center of the room. They stand out against gray walls, drawing the eye around the room. The entire show is breathtaking. As Cole leads me through the rooms, we enter the back wing. I stop short. There is a portrait of me\u2014an image that was not in the LeFemme box. It\u2019s a painting of me with angel wings made from paint and seemingly random objects. The exposure is perfect. My skin has a silky glow and is perfectly smooth. A piece of silk covers part of my chest, while crystals cover the rest of my naked self. My hair is blowing and I look completely and totally awesome. If someone thought I\u2019m a goddess, that\u2019s what it would look like. It is standing in a back corner, set apart from the rest. The entire show has a somber feel, like the artist feels lost. Looking at the rest of the pieces has a calming effect, but this one is different than the rest. It screams of hope and happiness. It doesn\u2019t belong.</p><p>\u201cCole, this shouldn\u2019t be here.\u201d I say, turning to him with my heart racing a mile a minute.</p><p>\u201cI should have asked you. I understand if you don\u2019t want anyone else to see it\u2014\u201d</p><p>I take his arm, stopping him midsentence, and turn him toward me. Cole thinks I\u2019m too prude to let him show it. \u201cThat\u2019s not it, Cole. You can leave it up if you want, but it doesn\u2019t blend with the rest of the show. Those works out there are all melancholy and pensive. This one...\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t know how to compare it. There is no comparison. The front of the show is all tortured artist, and this is happy dude. The only speck of black on the canvas is a crow that\u2019s in the tippie top of one of my wings. There are other things too, objects that mean something to me or us; a yellow sneaker, a tutu, a red ribbon. I can\u2019t help but smile when I look at it, and I want his last show to be amazing. This is so different that I don\u2019t know people will say.</p><p>Cole pulls me to him, wrapping his arms around my waist. \u201cIt\u2019s perfect. It\u2019s everything I was missing, everything that\u2019s important to me, now.\u201d He kisses my cheek lightly, searing my skin. My knees feel like jelly for a second and I lock them so I don\u2019t fall over. I smile at him shyly.</p><p>He says, \u201cI have something for you.\u201d Cole releases me and pulls a black box out of his pocket. My eyes grow wide and I glance between his face and the ring box\u2014that is totally a ring box. \u201cYou\u2019re the only woman who would accept a proposal without a ring.\u201d He grins and cracks open the lid.</p><p>Inside is the most beautiful ring that I\u2019ve ever seen. It\u2019s not a traditional engagement ring. There\u2019s no single diamond set on prongs. Instead it\u2019s a glittering blue stone the color of Cole\u2019s eyes, set in white gold. It\u2019s so simple and sophisticated at the same time. My hands cover my mouth as I gasp. I don\u2019t know why I\u2019m shocked, but I am.</p><p>I\u2019m shaking too much to move. Cole reaches for my left hand. He pulls the ring from the box and slips it on my finger. It fits perfectly. I smile, stunned into silence before throwing my arms around his neck and kissing his face over and over again.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s beautiful.\u201d I breathe after we part.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a diamond. I saw the color and that setting, and knew it was perfect for you, my beautiful bride.\u201d Cole leans close to my ear and presses his lips to my neck.</p><p>Someone says, \u201cAh-hem,\u201d and Cole pulls away from me with a wicked smile on his face. \u201cThis is the infamous Anna, I assume?\u201d</p><p>Cole nods. \u201cFrederick, may I introduce my bride-to-be, Anna Lamore.\u201d Fredrick extends a dainty hand toward me. He\u2019s five foot nothing with wavy black hair and tanned skin. His dark eyes glitter like he\u2019s stealing a cookie. I smile at him as we shake. \u201cAnna, this is Frederick Supoe, the gallery owner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nice to meet you,\u201d I say. \u201cThank you for arranging this show so quickly for Cole.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCole and I go way back. There\u2019s nothing that pleases me more. He never shows certain works and I can tell from looking around that this is indeed the lost works of a lost man.\u201d Frederick folds his arms over his narrow chest and moves towards the painting of me. He taps his front tooth and then points to the bright painting, \u201cExcept this one. This one is the most brilliant.\u201d Frederick stares at it like he\u2019s awestruck.</p><p>I don\u2019t understand. I step next to Frederick. We\u2019re nearly the same height. I glance at him. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>He doesn\u2019t look at me. Instead he continues to gaze at the canvas. \u201cAny man can be lost. Any man can capture that emotion in film or paint, but it takes a much more to pull up from the ashes and start again. That\u2019s what this says to me. It says we have a new Cole. The piece is symbolic of his new name, of his new life. The front rooms are filled with the secrets of his past, but this\u2014this is his future.\u201d Frederick turns and looks at me. \u201cYou\u2019re an impressive woman, Miss Lamore. I hope you\u2019ll consider putting on a show here.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I\u2019m flabbergasted. I open my mouth, but nothing comes out. Supoe\u2019s Gallery is the finest in the city.</p><p>When I make a squawking sound, Cole answers for me, \u201cShe would love to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be expecting it.\u201d He winks at me before walking to the front of the gallery. It\u2019s nearly time to open.</p><p>I want to jump up and down. Glee spreads across my face. Cole takes me in his arms and swings me around. Cole and I laugh as we whirl in a circle. I\u2019ve never seen him so happy.</p> <p>CHAPTER 12</p><p>Emma arrives about half way through the show. The gallery is packed with people. She moves through, asking them questions and smiling. Periodically, the guy from the paper with the camera snaps a picture and they move on to the next person. I remain in the front, away from my canvas. I want the limelight on Cole. Besides, Sottero has yet to show her face. I would have thought that she\u2019d arrive before anyone and snatch the pieces of her up.</p><p>I sit on a black bench in the center of the room. People move around me. I can hear them whispering about Cole\u2019s work, about how he\u2019s one of the most talented artists in New York. I\u2019m happy for him. I can\u2019t stop smiling.</p><p>I don\u2019t notice her until she\u2019s standing next to me. \u201cAnna, dear.\u201d Her voice is curt. Sophia Sottero stands rigidly at my side. She\u2019s dressed in her normal pristine suit. There isn\u2019t a wrinkle on the entire thing.</p><p>I don\u2019t stand up. \u201cSophia.\u201d</p> <p>She doesn\u2019t look at me. Her gaze is on the wall. Sophia\u2019s eyes rake the paintings. Her body twitches with tension. \u201cThis was your doing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d I confess, and stare straight ahead as I cross my ankles.</p><p>\u201cIs this because I helped the man who tried to rape you?\u201d</p><p>My eyes cut to the side. I glance up at her face. A million emotions rage through my body. She mentioned that during her rant the other day. \u201cNo, but thanks for that. Getting raped is every girl\u2019s dream. You basically pushed me straight into him.\u201d</p><p>Her spine straightens more, if that\u2019s possible. \u201cI didn\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a pretty lame apology.\u201d I don\u2019t expect her to stay here chatting me up. She looks like she wants to slash the paintings and break every piece of glass in the place.</p> <p>Sophia swallows hard, still keeping her chin high. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d Sophia doesn\u2019t blink. Her voice retains that hard tone she always has, but I can tell she means it. I say nothing because there\u2019s nothing to say, so I nod. She stands next to me for a few moments longer before saying, \u201cYou knew these weren\u2019t full nudes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you didn\u2019t.\u201d Sophia doesn\u2019t respond. I add, \u201cNice way to try and get them\u2014accusing a guy of molesting you and then trying to take all of his stuff when you notice he won\u2019t fight back\u2014that he can\u2019t fight back. If you asked, I\u2019m fairly certain that Cole would have given them to you.\u201d</p><p>She takes a breath, but doesn\u2019t look at me. \u201cThings didn\u2019t work like that, then. These pictures would have ruined me...\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf they were dirty like you thought, if Cole was the sleaze you made him out to be, but he\u2019s not and these are most definitely art. The only thing I find objectionable is the model. I heard she\u2019s a real bitch.\u201d</p><p>Sophia looks down at me. \u201cWell spoken.\u201d</p><p>I stand and step in front of her. Sophia\u2019s dark eyes meet mine. \u201cWhat are you going to do now? I heard you lost half your client base and the ones you retained hate your guts, but didn\u2019t want to lose their retainer fees.\u201d My brow lifts as I speak. I tilt my head to the side and fold my arms over my chest. \u201cIncidentally, most of your staff showed up tonight and asked Cole for employment\u2014the interns, too. It seems that you\u2019ve shot your studio in the head.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps I did.\u201d She doesn\u2019t fight. It irritates me. Sophia has vinegar running through her veins. She\u2019s as nasty as they come. This attitude is like her, but the comments are not. She turns and looks at the blue painting and says, \u201cWhere is Cole?\u201d</p><p>Cole must have been watching us, because he steps up behind her and says, \u201cI\u2019m right here, Ms. Sottero.\u201d</p> <p>Sophia turns. She looks at Cole with fear in her eyes. \u201cThis is all that remains of that shoot, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never believed you were capable of something like this. I thought everything with you would be panties and bare skin.\u201d She looks at him for a second. \u201cApparently I was wrong and you have a very fearsome way of demonstrating that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou forced my hand, Sophia. I would have left them unseen. I would have let things go, but you held onto the past so damn hard. It wasn\u2019t good enough to part ways. You had to destroy everything you touched.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd yet, I didn\u2019t destroy you.\u201d She sniffles a sad laugh, \u201cIt\u2019s quite the opposite, really. My studio is in shambles and I\u2019m financially drained from pursuing a lawsuit that\u2019s fallen apart. And your little intern here\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy fianc\u00e9,\u201d Cole corrects.</p><p>Sophia smiles slowly, \u201cAh, well, your fianc\u00e9 tells me that my staff has left me as well.\u201d Cole nods, but doesn\u2019t say anything else. Sophia sucks in a ragged breath and puts on a fake smile. She looks at me and then Cole. \u201cI\u2019m terminating the lawsuit.\u201d Neither of us answer.</p><p>Everything she made crumbled in her hands. Sophia built her own empire and destroyed it, single handedly. Without another word, Sophia turns and cuts through the crowd, heading towards the front door.</p><p>When she leaves, I turn to Cole. Every muscle in his body is taught, like he\u2019s ready to fight. \u201cAre you all right?\u201d</p><p>He pulls me into a hug, \u201cAs long as I have you, I am.\u201d He kisses my temple and smiles before disappearing back into the crowd of people.</p><p>I smile at him and sink back down onto the bench again. The rest of the night passes in a blur. Several paintings sell for astronomical amounts of money, including the angelic portrait of me. The critics will write up their reviews tomorrow, but I already know what they are going to say. I heard the words fall from their lips. The show was adequate, but the piece that defined it was the last work of an earthly angel. There are pieces that an artist is known for, a piece that defines him and that piece is Cole\u2019s.</p><p>CHAPTER 13</p><p>Sottero makes good on her claim. The lawsuit ends as quickly as it started. Suddenly, there is nothing pulling at us, demanding our attention. We spend hours at the Long Island studio, sitting on the beach and watching the surf. Cole\u2019s fingers weave together with mine.</p><p>The breeze blows his hair into his eyes and he pushes it back. The sky is gray, like it might rain and the air is nippy, like some artic air came this way early. We\u2019re both wearing sweatshirts and jeans. The ocean roars, pounding waves into the sand. I wiggle my bare toes in the sand and look at his beautiful eyes.</p><p>\u201cHave you given any thought to the wedding?\u201d Cole asks me.</p><p>I grin at him and nod. \u201cMaybe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen did you become so allusive?\u201d He smiles at me and bumps my shoulder with his.</p><p>\u201cWhen I figured out that it drives you crazy.\u201d I smirk at him in response and bump him back.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t make the mistake of thinking that I won\u2019t pin you on the sand and tickle you until you scream. I will get a date out of you one way or another.\u201d</p><p>I laugh, not believing him, which is stupid. \u201cYeah, right,\u201d I mutter.</p><p>Cole launches himself on me and within seconds he has me pinned. I squirm, trying to pull my arms or legs, but I can\u2019t move. When Cole goes to tickle me, I say, \u201cDon\u2019t you dare!\u201d</p><p>Cole\u2019s fingers find my sides under the thick sweatshirt and wiggle against my skin. I laugh hysterically and try to get away. I manage to get an arm free and tickle him back, but the bastard isn\u2019t ticklish.</p><p>\u201cPick a date, Miss Lamore.\u201d The sky opens up and it starts to rain. The drops fall to the ground in big globs. The water is freezing.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s raining!\u201d I manage to say, but Cole doesn\u2019t stop.</p><p>\u201cSo, pick a date.\u201d Cole tickles me more and I squirm in the sand. Rain pelts my face and feels like ice. I\u2019m the worst tickle ninja ever. I can\u2019t get away from Cole and he seems impervious to tickles. So, I curl into a ball to attempt a lame defense.</p><p>Cole rolls me around on the shore like a cat with a ball of yarn. \u201cNext summer?\u201d he asks.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d I laugh hysterically, tears filling my eyes. My clothes are soaking wet, as are Cole\u2019s. Water pours off his face and splatters on mine. \u201cWinter.\u201d I\u2019m breathing hard, but he hears me.</p><p>Cole\u2019s fingers stop. He climbs on top of me and tangles his fingers in my wet hair. \u201cWinter?\u201d he sounds surprised. It\u2019s fall. Winter is really soon.</p><p>\u201cYeah. I don\u2019t want to wait.\u201d I feel uncertain. The expression on his face is hard to read. \u201cIs that all right? Did you want daffodils or something?\u201d</p><p>Cole laughs, \u201cI just want you, Anna.\u201d He presses his lips to mine and I melt into his arms. </p> </body></html>"]
