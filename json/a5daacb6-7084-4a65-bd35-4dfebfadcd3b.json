He\u2019d marched many miles with three friends, but at a crossroads, each had chosen a different way and continued on while our soldier had stopped to pick a pebble from his shoe. Now he sat alone.</p><p>The soldier put his shoe back on, but he was not yet interested in continuing his journey. He\u2019d been many years away at war, and he knew no one waited for him at home. Those who might\u2019ve welcomed his return had long ago died. And if they hadn\u2019t, he wasn\u2019t sure they would recognize the man he\u2019d become over the years. When a man goes away to war, he never returns the same. Fear and want, courage and loss, killing and tedium all work on him subtly, minute by minute, day by day, year by year, until in the end he is entirely changed, a distortion for good or bad of the man he once was.</p><p>So our soldier sat on a rock and contemplated these things as the breeze blew coolly against his cheeks. By his side lay a great sword, and it was in honor of this sword that he was named.</p> <p>For he was called Longsword....</p><p>\u2014from Longsword</p><p>Chapter One</p><p>Longsword\u2019s sword was quite extraordinary, for not only was it heavy, sharp, and deadly, but also it could be wielded only by Longsword himself....</p><p>\u2014from Longsword</p> <p>LONDON, ENGLAND</p><p>OCTOBER 1765</p><p>Few events are as boring as a political tea. The hostess of such a social affair is often wildly desirous for something\u2014anything\u2014to occur at her party so as to make it more exciting.</p><p>Although, perhaps a dead man staggering into the tea was a little too exciting, Beatrice Corning reflected later.</p><p>Up until the dead-man-staggering-in bit, things had gone as usual with the tea party. Which was to say it was crashingly dull. Beatrice had chosen the blue salon, which was, unsurprisingly, blue. A quiet, restful, dull blue. White pilasters lined the walls, rising to the ceiling with discreet little curlicues at their tops. Tables and chairs were scattered here and there, and an oval table stood at the center of the room with a vase of late Michaelmas daisies. The refreshments included thinly sliced bread with butter and small, pale pink cakes. Beatrice had argued for the inclusion of raspberry tarts, thinking that they at least might be colorful, but Uncle Reggie\u2014the Earl of Blanchard to everyone else\u2014had balked at the idea.</p><p>Beatrice sighed. Uncle Reggie was an old darling, but he did like to pinch pennies. Which was also why the wine had been watered down to an anemic rose color, and the tea was so weak one could make out the tiny blue pagoda at the bottom of each teacup. She glanced across the room to where her uncle stood, his plump bandy legs braced and hands on hips, arguing heatedly with Lord Hasselthorpe. At least he wasn\u2019t sampling the cakes, and she\u2019d watched carefully to make sure his wineglass was filled only once. The force of Uncle Reggie\u2019s ire had made his wig slip askew. Beatrice felt a fond smile tug at her lips. Oh, dear. She gestured to one of the footmen, gave him her plate, and began slowly winding her way across the room to put her uncle to rights.</p> <p>Only, a quarter of the way to her goal she was stopped by a light touch at her elbow and a conspiratorial whisper. \u201cDon\u2019t look now, but His Grace is performing his famous imitation of an angry codfish.\u201d</p><p>Beatrice turned and looked into twinkling sherry-brown eyes. Lottie Graham was only a smidgen over five feet, plump, and dark-haired, and the innocence of her round, freckled face was entirely belied by the sharpness of her wit.</p><p>\u201cHe isn\u2019t,\u201d Beatrice murmured, and then winced as she casually glanced over. Lottie was quite correct, as usual\u2014the Duke of Lister did indeed look like an enraged fish. \u201cBesides, what does a codfish have to get angry about anyway?\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly,\u201d Lottie replied, as if having made her point. \u201cI don\u2019t like that man\u2014I never have\u2014and that\u2019s entirely aside from his politics.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShh,\u201d Beatrice hissed. They stood by themselves, but there were several groups of gentlemen nearby who could overhear if they\u2019d wished. Since every man in the room was a staunch Tory, it behooved the ladies to hide their Whig leanings.</p><p>\u201cOh, pish, Beatrice, dear,\u201d Lottie said. \u201cEven if one of these fine learned gentlemen heard what I\u2019m saying, none of them have the imagination to realize we might have a thought or two in our pretty heads\u2014especially if that thought doesn\u2019t agree with theirs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot even Mr. Graham?\u201d</p><p>Both ladies turned to look at a handsome young man in a snowy white wig in the corner of the room. His cheeks were pink, his eyes bright, and he stood straight and strong as he regaled the men about him with a story.</p> <p>\u201cEspecially not Nate,\u201d Lottie said, frowning at her husband.</p><p>Beatrice tilted her head toward her friend. \u201cBut I thought you were making headway in bringing him to our side?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was mistaken,\u201d Lottie said lightly. \u201cWhere the other Tories go, there goest Nate as well, whether he agrees with their views or no. He\u2019s as steadfast as a titmouse in a high wind. No, I\u2019m very much afraid he\u2019ll be voting against Mr. Wheaton\u2019s bill to provide for retired soldiers of His Majesty\u2019s army.\u201d</p><p>Beatrice bit her lip. Lottie\u2019s tone was nearly flippant, but she knew the other woman was disappointed. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>Lottie shrugged one shoulder. \u201cIt\u2019s strange, but I find myself more disillusioned by a husband who has such easily persuaded views than I would be by one whose views were entirely opposite but passionately held. Isn\u2019t that quixotic of me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it only shows your own strong feeling.\u201d Beatrice linked her arm with Lottie\u2019s. \u201cBesides, I wouldn\u2019t give up on Mr. Graham yet. He does love you, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I do know.\u201d Lottie examined a tray of pink cakes on the nearby table. \u201cThat\u2019s what makes the whole thing so very tragic.\u201d She popped a cake into her mouth. \u201cMmm. These are much better than they look.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLottie!\u201d Beatrice protested, half laughing.</p><p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s true. They\u2019re such proper little Tory cakes that I\u2019d\u2019ve thought they\u2019d taste like dust, but they have a lovely hint of rose.\u201d She took another cake and ate it. \u201cYou realize that Lord Blanchard\u2019s wig is crooked, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Beatrice sighed. \u201cI was on my way to setting it right when you waylaid me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm. You\u2019ll have to brave Old Fishy, then.\u201d</p><p>Beatrice saw that the Duke of Lister had joined her uncle and Lord Hasselthorpe. \u201cLovely. But I still need to save poor Uncle Reggie\u2019s wig.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou courageous soul, you,\u201d Lottie said. \u201cI\u2019ll stay here and guard the cakes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCoward,\u201d Beatrice murmured.</p><p>She had a smile on her lips as she started again for her uncle\u2019s circle. Lottie was right, of course. The gentlemen who gathered in her uncle\u2019s salon were the leading lights of the Tory Party. Most sat in the House of Lords, but there were commoners here as well, such as Nathan Graham. They would all be outraged if they found out that she held any political thoughts at all, let alone ones that ran counter to her uncle\u2019s. Generally she kept these thoughts to herself, but the matter of a fair pension for veteran soldiers was too important an issue to neglect. Beatrice had seen firsthand what a war wound could do to a man\u2014and how it might affect him for years after he left His Majesty\u2019s army. No, it was simply\u2014</p><p>The door to the blue salon was flung savagely open, cracking against the wall. Every head in the room swiveled to look at the man who stood there. He was tall, with impossibly wide shoulders that filled the doorway. He wore some type of dull leather leggings and shirt under a bright blue coat. Long black hair straggled wildly down his back, and an overgrown beard nearly covered his gaunt cheeks. An iron cross dangled from one ear, and an enormous unsheathed knife hung from a string at his waist.</p><p>He had the eyes of a man long dead.</p><p>\u201cWho the hell\u2019re\u2014\u201d Uncle Reggie began.</p><p>But the man spoke over him, his voice deep and rusty. \u201cO\u00f9 est mon p\u00e8re?\u201d</p><p>He was staring right at Beatrice, as if no one else in the room existed. She was frozen, mesmerized and confused, one hand on the oval table. It couldn\u2019t be...</p><p>He started for her, his stride firm, arrogant, and impatient. \u201cJ\u2019insiste sur le fait de voir mon p\u00e8re!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI... I don\u2019t know where your father is,\u201d Beatrice stuttered. His long stride was eating up the space between them. He was almost to her. No one was doing anything, and she\u2019d forgotten all her schoolroom French. \u201cPlease, I don\u2019t know\u2014\u201d</p><p>But he was already on her, his big, rough hands reaching for her. Beatrice flinched; she couldn\u2019t help it. It was as if the devil himself had come for her, here in her own home, at this boring tea of all places.</p><p>And then he staggered. One brown hand grasped the table as if to steady himself, but the little table wasn\u2019t up for the task. He took it with him as he collapsed to his knees. The vase of flowers crashed to the floor beside him in a mess of petals, water, and glass shards. His angry gaze was still locked with hers, even as he sank to the carpet. Then his black eyes rolled back in his head, and he fell over.</p><p>Someone screamed.</p><p>\u201cGood God! Beatrice, are you all right, my dear? Where in blazes is my butler?\u201d</p><p>Beatrice heard Uncle Reggie behind her, but she was already on her knees beside the fallen man, unmindful of the spilled water from the vase. Hesitantly, she touched his lips and felt the brush of his breath. Still alive, then. Thank God! She took his heavy head between her palms and placed it on her lap so that she might look at his face more closely.</p><p>She caught her breath.</p><p>The man had been tattooed. Three stylized birds of prey flew about his right eye, savage and wild. His commanding black eyes were closed, but his brows were heavy and slightly knit as if he disapproved of her even when unconscious. His beard was untrimmed and at least two inches long, but she made out the mouth beneath, incongruously elegant. The lips were firm, the upper one a wide, sensuous bow.</p><p>\u201cMy dear, please move away from that... that thing,\u201d Uncle Reggie said. He had his hand on her arm, urging her to get up. \u201cThe footmen can\u2019t remove him from the house until you move.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey can\u2019t take him,\u201d Beatrice said, still staring at the impossible face.</p><p>\u201cMy dear girl . . .\u201d</p><p>She looked up. Uncle Reggie was such a darling, even when red-faced with impatience. This might very well kill him. And her\u2014what did this mean for her? \u201cIt\u2019s Viscount Hope.\u201d</p><p>Uncle Reggie blinked. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cViscount Hope.\u201d</p><p>And they both turned to look at the portrait near the door. It was of a young, handsome man, the former heir to the earldom. The man whose death had made it possible for Uncle Reggie to become the Earl of Blanchard.</p><p>Black, heavy-lidded eyes stared from the portrait.</p><p>She looked back down at the living man. His eyes were closed, but she remembered them well. Black, angry, and glittering, they were identical to the eyes in the portrait.</p><p>Beatrice\u2019s heart froze in wonder.</p><p>Reynaud St. Aubyn, Viscount Hope, the true Earl of Blanchard, was alive.</p><p>RICHARD MADDOCK, LORD Hasselthorpe, watched as the Earl of Blanchard\u2019s footmen lifted the unconscious lunatic from where he\u2019d collapsed on the floor of the sitting room. How the man had gotten past the butler and footmen in the hall was anyone\u2019s guess. The earl should take better care of his guests\u2014the room was filled with the Tory elite, for God\u2019s sake.</p><p>\u201cDamned idiot,\u201d the Duke of Lister growled beside him, putting voice to his own thoughts. \u201cBlanchard should\u2019ve hired extra guards if the house wasn\u2019t safe.\u201d</p><p>Hasselthorpe grunted, sipping his abominably watered-down wine. The footmen were almost to the door now, obviously laboring under the weight of the savage madman. The earl and his niece were trailing the footmen, speaking in low tones. Blanchard darted a glance at him, and Hasselthorpe raised a disapproving eyebrow. The earl looked hastily away. Blanchard might be higher in rank, but Hasselthorpe\u2019s political influence was greater\u2014a fact that Hasselthorpe usually took care to use lightly. Blanchard was, along with the Duke of Lister, his greatest ally in parliament. Hasselthorpe had his eye on the prime minister\u2019s seat, and with the backing of Lister and Blanchard, he hoped to make it within the next year. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>If all went according to his plans.</p><p>The little procession exited the room, and Hasselthorpe returned his gaze to the guests, frowning slightly. The people nearest to where the man had fallen were in small knots, talking in low, excited murmurs. Something was afoot. One could watch the ripple of some news spreading outward through the crowd. As it reached each new knot of gentlemen, eyebrows shot up and bewigged heads leaned close together.</p><p>Young Nathan Graham was in a gossiping group nearby. Graham was newly elected to the House of Commons, an ambitious man with the wealth to back his aspiration and the makings of a great orator. He was a young man to watch and perhaps groom for one\u2019s own use.</p><p>Graham broke away from the circle and strode to where Hasselthorpe and Lister stood in a corner of the room. \u201cThey say it\u2019s Viscount Hope.\u201d</p> <p>Hasselthorpe blinked, confused. \u201cWho?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat man!\u201d Graham gestured to the spot where a maid was cleaning up the broken vase.</p><p>Hasselthorpe\u2019s mind momentarily froze in shock.</p><p>\u201cImpossible,\u201d Lister growled. \u201cHope has been dead for seven years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would they think it\u2019s Hope?\u201d Hasselthorpe asked quietly.</p> <p>Graham shrugged. \u201cThere was a resemblance, sir. I was close enough to study the man\u2019s face when he burst into the room. The eyes are... well, the only word is extraordinary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEyes, extraordinary or not, are hardly proof enough to resurrect a dead man,\u201d Lister stated.</p><p>Lister had cause to speak with flat authority. He was a big man, tall with a sloping belly, and he had an undeniable presence. Lister was also one of the most powerful men in England. It was natural, then, that when he spoke, men took care to listen.</p><p>\u201cYes, Your Grace.\u201d Graham gave a small bow to the duke. \u201cBut he was asking after his father.\u201d</p><p>Graham had no need to add, And we stand in the Earl of Blanchard\u2019s London residence.</p><p>\u201cRidiculous.\u201d Lister hesitated, then said, lower, \u201cIf it is Hope, Blanchard\u2019s just lost his title.\u201d</p> <p>He looked significantly at Hasselthorpe. If Blanchard lost the title, he would no longer sit in the House of Lords. They\u2019d lose a crucial ally.</p><p>Hasselthorpe frowned, turning to the life-sized portrait hanging by the door. Hope had been a young man, perhaps only in his twentieth year, when he\u2019d sat for it. The painting depicted a laughing youth, pink and white cheeks unblemished, black eyes merry and clear. If the madman had been Hope, he\u2019d suffered a sea change of monumental proportions.</p><p>Hasselthorpe turned back to the other men and smiled grimly. \u201cA lunatic cannot unseat Blanchard. And in any case, no one has proved he\u2019s Hope. There is no cause for alarm.\u201d</p><p>Hasselthorpe sipped his wine, outwardly cool and composed, while inside he acknowledged the unfinished end to his sentence.</p><p>There was no cause for alarm... yet.</p><p>IT HAD TAKEN four footmen to lift Viscount Hope, and even now they staggered under his weight. Beatrice watched the men carefully as she and her uncle trailed behind them, worried they might let him fall. She\u2019d persuaded Uncle Reggie to take the unconscious man to an unused bedroom, although her uncle had been far from happy with the matter. Uncle Reggie had initially been of a mind to toss him into the street. She took a more cautious view, not only from Christian charity, but also from the niggling worry that if this was Lord Hope, they\u2019d hardly help their case by throwing him out.</p><p>The footmen staggered into the hall with their burden. Hope was thinner than in his portrait, but he was still a very tall man\u2014over six feet, Beatrice estimated. She shivered. Fortunately, he\u2019d not regained consciousness after glaring at her so evilly. Otherwise she wasn\u2019t sure they would\u2019ve been able to move him at all.</p><p>\u201cViscount Hope is dead,\u201d Uncle Reggie muttered as he trotted beside her. He didn\u2019t sound as if he believed his protest himself. \u201cDead these seven years!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPlease, Uncle, don\u2019t let your temper fly,\u201d Beatrice said anxiously. He hated being reminded of it, but Uncle Reggie had had an attack of apoplexy just last month\u2014an attack that had absolutely terrified her. \u201cRemember what the doctor said.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, pshaw! I\u2019m as fit as a fiddle, despite what that quack thinks,\u201d Uncle Reggie said stoutly. \u201cI know you have a soft heart, m\u2019dear, but this can\u2019t be Hope. Three men swore they saw him die, murdered by those savages in the American Colonies. One of them was Viscount Vale, his friend since childhood!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, they were obviously wrong,\u201d Beatrice murmured. She frowned as the panting footmen mounted the wide dark-oak stairs ahead of them. The bedrooms were all on the town house\u2019s third floor. \u201cMind his head!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, miss,\u201d George, the eldest footman, replied.</p><p>\u201cIf that is Hope, then he\u2019s lost his mind,\u201d Uncle Reggie huffed as they made the upper hall. \u201cHe was raving in French, of all things. About his father! And I know absolutely that the last earl died five years ago. Attended his funeral m\u2019self. You\u2019ll not convince me the old earl\u2019s alive, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Uncle,\u201d Beatrice replied. \u201cBut I don\u2019t believe the viscount knows his father is dead.\u201d</p><p>She felt a pang for the unconscious man. Where had Lord Hope been all these years? How had he gotten those strange tattoos? And why didn\u2019t he know his father was dead? Dear God, maybe her uncle was right. Maybe the viscount\u2019s mind was broken.</p><p>Uncle Reggie gave voice to her awful thoughts. \u201cThe man is insane; that\u2019s clear. Raving. Attacking you. I say, shouldn\u2019t you lie down, m\u2019dear? I can send for some of those lemon sweets you like so much, damn the cost.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s very kind of you, Uncle, but he didn\u2019t get close enough to lay a hand on me,\u201d Beatrice murmured.</p><p>\u201cWasn\u2019t for lack of trying!\u201d</p><p>Uncle Reggie stared disapprovingly as the footmen bore the viscount into the scarlet bedroom. It was only the second-nicest guest bedroom, and for a moment Beatrice had a pang of doubt. If this was Viscount Hope, then surely he merited the first-nicest guest bedroom? Or was the point moot since if he was Lord Hope, then he really ought to be in the earl\u2019s bedroom, which, of course, Uncle Reggie slept in? Beatrice shook her head. The whole thing was too complicated for words, and, in any case, the scarlet bedroom would have to do for now.</p><p>\u201cThe man ought to be in a madhouse,\u201d Uncle Reggie was saying. \u201cMight murder us all in our sleep when he wakes. If he wakes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI doubt he\u2019ll do any such thing,\u201d Beatrice said firmly, ignoring both her uncle\u2019s hopeful tone in his last words and her own uneasiness. \u201cSurely it\u2019s only the fever. He was burning up when I touched his face.\u201d</p><p>\u201cS\u2019pose I\u2019ll have to send for a physician.\u201d Uncle Reggie scowled at Lord Hope. \u201cAnd pay for it m\u2019self.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt would be the Christian thing to do,\u201d Beatrice murmured. She watched anxiously as the footmen lowered Hope to the bed. He hadn\u2019t moved or made a sound since his collapse. Was he dying?</p><p>Uncle Reggie grunted. \u201cAnd I\u2019ll have to explain this to my guests somehow. Bound to be gossiping about it this very moment. We\u2019ll be the talk of the town, take my word.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Uncle,\u201d Beatrice said soothingly. \u201cI can supervise here if you wish to attend to our guests.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t take too long, and don\u2019t get too close to the blighter. No telling what he might do if he wakes.\u201d Uncle Reggie glared at the unconscious man before stumping out of the room.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t.\u201d Beatrice turned to the waiting footmen. \u201cGeorge, please see that a physician is called in case the earl becomes distracted and forgets the matter.\u201d Or thinks better of the cost, she mentally added.</p><p>\u201cYes, miss.\u201d George started for the door.</p><p>\u201cOh, and send Mrs. Callahan up, will you, George?\u201d Beatrice frowned at the pale, bearded man on the bed. He was moving restlessly, as if he might be waking. \u201cMrs. Callahan always seems to know what to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, miss.\u201d George hurried from the room.</p><p>Beatrice looked at the remaining three footmen. \u201cOne of you needs to go tell Cook to warm some water, brandy, and\u2014\u201d</p><p>But at that moment, Hope\u2019s black eyes flew open. The movement was so sudden, his glare so intense, that Beatrice squeaked like a ninny and jumped back. She straightened and, feeling a little embarrassed of her missishness, hurried forward as Lord Hope began to rise.</p><p>\u201cNo, no, my lord! You must remain in bed. You\u2019re ill.\u201d She touched his shoulder, lightly but firmly pushing him back.</p><p>And suddenly she was seized by a whirlwind. Lord Hope violently grabbed her, shoved her down on the bed, and fell atop her. He might be thin, but Beatrice felt as if a sack of bricks had landed on her chest. She gasped for air and looked up into black eyes glaring at her malevolently from only inches away. He was so close she could count each individual sooty eyelash.</p><p>So close she felt the painful press of that horrid knife in her side.</p><p>She tried to press her hand against his chest\u2014she couldn\u2019t breathe!\u2014but he caught it, crushing it in his own as he growled, \u201cJ\u2019insiste sur le fait\u2014\u201d</p><p>He was cut off as Henry, one of the footmen, bashed him over the head with a bed warmer. Lord Hope slumped, his heavy head thumping onto Beatrice\u2019s breast. For a moment, she was in fear of suffocating altogether. Then Henry pulled him off her. She took a shuddering breath and stood on shaky legs, turning to look at her unconscious patient in the bed. His head lolled, his piercing black eyes veiled now. Would he have really hurt her? He\u2019d looked so evil\u2014demented, even. What in God\u2019s name had happened to him? She rubbed her sore hand, swallowing hard as she regained her composure.</p><p>George returned and looked shocked when Henry explained what had happened.</p><p>\u201cEven so, you shouldn\u2019t have hit him so hard,\u201d Beatrice scolded Henry.</p><p>\u201c\u2019E was hurting you, miss.\u201d Henry sounded mulish.</p><p>She brushed a trembling hand over her hair, checking that her coiffure was still in place. \u201cYes, well, it didn\u2019t actually come to that, although I admit for a moment I was fearful. Thank you, Henry. I\u2019m sorry; I\u2019m still a bit discomposed.\u201d She bit her lip, eyeing Lord Hope again. \u201cGeorge, I think it wise to place a guard at the viscount\u2019s door. Day and night, mind you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, miss,\u201d George replied sturdily.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s for his own sake as well as ours,\u201d Beatrice murmured. \u201cAnd I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll be fine once he recovers from this illness.\u201d</p><p>The footmen exchanged uncertain glances.</p><p>Beatrice put a bit more steel in her voice to cover her own worry. \u201cI would be obliged if Lord Blanchard didn\u2019t hear of this incident.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, ma\u2019am,\u201d George answered for all the footmen, although he still looked dubious.</p><p>Mrs. Callahan arrived at that moment, bustling into the room. \u201cWhat\u2019s all the bother, then, miss? Hurley\u2019s said there\u2019s a gentleman who\u2019s collapsed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMr. Hurley is correct.\u201d Beatrice gestured to the man on the bed. She turned to the housekeeper eagerly as a thought occurred to her. \u201cDo you recognize him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHim?\u201d Mrs. Callahan wrinkled her nose. \u201cCan\u2019t say as I do, miss. Very hairy gentleman, isn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSays \u2019e\u2019s Viscount Hope,\u201d Henry stated with satisfaction.</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d Mrs. Callahan stared.</p><p>\u201cBloke in the painting,\u201d Henry clarified. \u201cPardon me, miss.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot at all, Henry,\u201d Beatrice replied. \u201cDid you know Lord Hope before the old earl\u2019s death?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, no, miss,\u201d Mrs. Callahan said. \u201cCame on fresh when your uncle was made the earl, if you remember.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, that\u2019s right,\u201d Beatrice said in disappointment. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cPractically the whole staff was,\u201d Mrs. Callahan continued, \u201cand them that had stayed... Well, they\u2019re gone now. It\u2019s been five years, after all, since the old earl passed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I know, but I had hoped.\u201d How could they say for certain who the man was until someone who\u2019d actually known Hope identified him? Beatrice shook her head. \u201cWell, it doesn\u2019t matter at the moment anyway. No matter who he is, it\u2019s our duty to care for this man.\u201d</p><p>Beatrice ordered her troops and gave out assignments. By the time she\u2019d consulted with the physician\u2014Uncle Reggie hadn\u2019t forgotten to send for him after all\u2014supervised Cook making gruel, and planned for a nursing regimen, the political tea was long over with. Beatrice left Lord Hope\u2014if that was indeed who he was\u2014under the eagle eye of Henry and drifted down the stairs to the blue sitting room.</p><p>It was empty now. Only the damp stain on the carpet gave any evidence of the dramatic events of several hours before. Beatrice stared at the stain for a moment before turning and inevitably facing the portrait of Viscount Hope.</p> <p>He looked so young, so carefree! She stepped closer, pulled as always by some attracting force she couldn\u2019t resist. She\u2019d been nineteen when she\u2019d first seen the portrait. The night she\u2019d arrived at Blanchard House with her uncle, the new Earl of Blanchard, it had been very late. She\u2019d been shown a room, but the excitement of a new house, the long carriage ride, and London itself had caused sleep to escape her. She\u2019d lain wide awake for half an hour or more before pulling on a wrapper and padding down the stairs.</p><p>She remembered peeking into the library, examining the study, creeping through the halls, and somehow, inevitably\u2014fatefully, it seemed\u2014she\u2019d ended up here. Here where she stood right now, only a pace before the portrait of Viscount Hope. Then, as now, it was his laughing eyes that had drawn her gaze first. Slightly crinkled, full of mischief and wicked humor. His mouth next, wide, with that slow, sensual curve on the upper lip. His hair was inky black, drawn straight back from a wide brow. He lounged in a relaxed pose against a tree, a fowling gun held casually through the crook of one arm, two spaniels panting adoringly up at that face.</p><p>Who could blame them? She\u2019d probably worn the same expression when she\u2019d first seen him. Maybe she still did. She\u2019d spent innumerable nights gazing at him just like this, dreaming of a man who would see inside her and love her only for herself. On the night of her twentieth birthday, she\u2019d crept down here, feeling excited and on the verge of something wonderful. The first time she\u2019d ever been kissed, she\u2019d come here to contemplate her feelings. Funny how now she couldn\u2019t quite remember the face of the boy whose lips had so inexpertly met her own. And when Jeremy had returned, broken from the war, she\u2019d come here.</p><p>Beatrice took one last look at those wicked ebony eyes and turned aside. For five long years, she\u2019d mooned over a painted man, a thing of dreams and fantasy. And now the flesh-and-blood man lay only two floors above her.</p><p>The question was, beneath the hair and beard, under the dirt and madness, was he the same man who\u2019d sat for this portrait so long ago?</p> <p>Chapter Two</p><p>Now, the Goblin King had long envied Longsword his magical sword, for goblins are never content with what they already have. As dusk began to fall, the Goblin King appeared before Longsword, wrapped in a rich velvet cloak.</p><p>He bowed and said, \u201cGood sir, I have thirty gold coins in this purse that I will give to you in exchange for your sword.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do not wish to offend, sir, but I will not part with my sword,\u201d Longsword replied.</p><p>And the Goblin King narrowed his eyes....</p><p>\u2014from Longsword</p> <p>Her brown eyes stared up through a mask of blood, dull and lifeless. He was too late.</p><p>Reynaud St. Aubyn, Viscount Hope, woke with his heart pounding hard and fast, but he made no movement, no outward sign that he was aware. He lay still, continuing to breathe quietly as he assessed his surroundings. His arms were by his side, so they\u2019d left off the rope that usually staked his hands to the ground. A mistake on their part. He\u2019d wait silently until they were asleep, and then he\u2019d gather his knife, the tattered blanket, and the dried meat he\u2019d hoarded and buried beneath the side of the wigwam. This time he\u2019d be far away when they woke. This time...</p><p>But something wasn\u2019t right.</p><p>He inhaled carefully and smelled... bread? He opened scratchy eyes and his world swung dizzily, caught between the past and the present. For a moment, he thought he\u2019d cast up his accounts and then everything steadied.</p><p>He recognized the room.</p><p>Reynaud blinked in bemusement. The scarlet room. In his father\u2019s house. There was the tall casement window, draped in faded scarlet velvet and letting in bright sunshine. The walls were paneled in dark wood, and a single small painting of overblown pink roses ornamented the wall near the window. Below stood the overstuffed Tudor armchair, which his mother had hated but which his father had forbidden her to throw out, because old Henry VIII was said to have sat in it. Mater had banished it here the year before she died, and Father had never had the heart to move it after. Reynaud\u2019s blue coat lay across the chair, carefully folded. And beside the bed, on a small table, were two buns and a glass of water.</p><p>He stared hard at the food for a moment, waiting for it to disappear. He\u2019d dreamed too many dreams of bread and wine and meat, dreams that vanished on waking, for him to take this abundance at face value right away. When the buns were still there a moment later, he lunged for them, his skeletal fingers scrabbling at the plate. He grasped one of the buns and tore it in pieces, shoving them into his mouth. Chewing drily, he looked around.</p><p>He lay in an antique bed made for some short ancestor. His feet hung off the end, tangled in the scarlet bedclothes, but it was a bed. He touched the embroidered coverlet over his chest, half expecting it to dissolve into delirium. He hadn\u2019t slept on a bed in over seven years, and the sensation was foreign. He was used to furs and a dirt-packed floor. Dried grass if he was lucky. The silk coverlet was smooth beneath his fingers, the fine cloth catching on rough skin and calluses. He must believe the evidence.</p> <p>He was home.</p><p>Triumph surged through him. Months of dogged traveling, most of it afoot, without money, friends, or influence. These last weeks of wretched fever and purging, the fear that he\u2019d be defeated so close to the goal. All over. Finally. He\u2019d made it home.</p><p>Reynaud stretched for the water glass, wincing. Every muscle in his body ached. His hand trembled so badly that some of the water spilled on his shirt, but he still swallowed enough to wash down the bun. He twitched at the coverlet, pulling it back like an old man, and found that he was dressed in his leggings and shirt. Someone had taken off his moccasins, though. He looked about for them, panicked\u2014they were his only shoes\u2014and saw them under the Tudor chair where his coat lay.</p><p>Carefully he inched his way to the edge of the bed and stood, panting. Dammit! Where was his knife? He was too weak to defend himself without it. He found and used the chamber pot, then made his way to the Tudor chair. Under the blue coat was his knife. He held it in his right hand, and the familiar worn horn handle made him instantly calmer. Barefoot, he padded back to the bedside table and pocketed the remaining bun; then he went to the door, moving soundlessly, though the extra effort caused sweat to break out along his hairline. Seven years of captivity had taught him to take nothing for granted.</p><p>So he was not surprised to find a liveried footman stationed in the hall outside his room. He was, however, somewhat startled when the man moved to bar his exit.</p><p>Reynaud cocked an eyebrow and gave the footman a look that for the last seven years had made other men reach for a weapon. This boy had never had to fight for food or life, though. He did not recognize danger even when it stared him in the face.</p><p>\u201cYer not supposed to leave, sir,\u201d the footman said.</p><p>\u201cSors de mon chemin,\u201d Reynaud snapped.</p><p>The footman goggled at him, and it took a moment for Reynaud to realize he\u2019d spoken in French, the language he\u2019d used for most of the last seven years. \u201cRidiculous,\u201d he rasped, the English words strange on his tongue. \u201cI\u2019m Lord Hope. Let me pass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMiss Corning says as how yer to stay right there,\u201d the footman replied, eyeing the knife. The boy swallowed. \u201cShe gave me strict orders.\u201d</p><p>Reynaud clenched his knife and started for the footman, intending to move him bodily. \u201cWho the hell is Miss Corning?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe,\u201d came a feminine voice from beyond the footman. Reynaud paused. The voice was low and sweet and terribly cultured. He hadn\u2019t heard English spoken in such tones in a very, very long time. And the voice... He might move mountains and kill men for such a voice. Might forget what he\u2019d fought so long for. It was more than attractive, that voice.</p><p>It was life itself.</p><p>A slip of a girl peered around the footman. \u201cOr is it \u2018I\u2019? I can never remember, can you?\u201d</p><p>Reynaud scowled. She wasn\u2019t what he\u2019d expected somehow. She was of average height, with gold hair and fair skin and a pleasant expression. Her eyes were wide and gray. She was very English-looking, which made her exotic. No, that wasn\u2019t right. He swayed where he stood, trying to clear his mind. It was just that he still wasn\u2019t used to the sight of a blond woman. An English woman.</p><p>\u201cWho are you?\u201d he demanded.</p><p>Her pale brown eyebrows flew up. \u201cI thought I\u2019d explained. Pardon me. I\u2019m Beatrice Corning. How do you do?\u201d</p><p>And she curtsied as if they stood in the most formal ballroom.</p><p>Damned if he\u2019d bow; he was unsteady on his feet as it was. He started forward again, intending to bypass the chit. \u201cI\u2019m Hope. Where\u2019s my\u2014\u201d</p><p>But she touched his arm, and the contact froze him. A wild image of her rounded form lying beneath him as he pressed his length into her softness filled his head. That couldn\u2019t be a true memory, he knew. Was he still delirious? His body seemed to know hers.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been ill,\u201d she was saying, speaking slowly and firmly as if to a small child or a village idiot.</p><p>\u201cI\u2014\u201d he began, but she was crowding him, moving him inexorably backward, and the only way to continue forward would be to push past her and perhaps hurt her.</p><p>His entire being recoiled at the thought.</p><p>So, slowly, gently, she maneuvered him into the scarlet room until he was staring down at her bemusedly by the bed again.</p><p>Who was this female?</p><p>\u201cWho are you?\u201d he repeated.</p><p>Her brows knit. \u201cCan\u2019t you remember? I\u2019ve already told you. I\u2019m Beatrice\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cCorning,\u201d he finished for her impatiently. \u201cYes, that I understand. What I don\u2019t understand is why you\u2019re in my father\u2019s house.\u201d</p><p>A wary expression crossed her face, so quickly he almost thought he\u2019d imagined it. But he hadn\u2019t. She was hiding something from him, and his senses were put on the alert. He glanced uneasily around the room. He was cornered here if an enemy attacked. He\u2019d have to fight his way to the door, and there wasn\u2019t much room to maneuver.</p><p>\u201cI live here with my uncle,\u201d she said soothingly, as if she sensed his thoughts. \u201cCan you tell me where you\u2019ve been? What has happened to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Brown eyes stared up through a mask of blood, dull and lifeless. He shook his head violently, banishing the phantom. \u201cNo!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right.\u201d Her gray eyes had widened in alarm. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to tell me. Now, if you\u2019ll just lie down again\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho is your uncle?\u201d He could feel some imminent danger raising the hairs on the back of his neck.</p><p>She closed her eyes and then looked at him frankly. \u201cMy uncle is Reginald St. Aubyn, the Earl of Blanchard.\u201d</p><p>He gripped his knife harder. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry,\u201d she said. \u201cYou need to lie down.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He grasped her arm. \u201cWhat did you say?\u201d</p><p>Her pink tongue darted out to lick her lips, and he realized, incongruously, that she smelled of flowers.</p><p>\u201cYour father died five years ago,\u201d she said. \u201cYou were thought dead, so my uncle claimed the title.\u201d</p><p>Not home, then, he thought bitterly. Not home at all.</p> <p>\u201cWELL, THAT MUST\u2019VE been awkward,\u201d Lottie said with her usual bluntness the next afternoon.</p><p>\u201cIt was simply terrible.\u201d Beatrice sighed. \u201cHe had no idea, of course, that his father was dead, and there he was holding that huge knife. I was quite nervous, half expecting him to do something violent, but instead he became very, very quiet, which was almost worse.\u201d</p><p>Beatrice frowned, remembering the pang of sympathy that\u2019d shot through her at Lord Hope\u2019s stillness. She shouldn\u2019t feel sympathy for a man who might strip Uncle Reggie of his title and their home, but there it was. She couldn\u2019t help but ache for his loss.</p><p>She took a sip of tea. Lottie always had such good tea\u2014nice and strong\u2014which was perhaps why she\u2019d fallen into the habit of calling round the Graham town house every Tuesday afternoon for tea and gossip. Lottie\u2019s private sitting room was so elegant, decorated in deep rose and a grayish sort of green one might think was dull but was actually the perfect complement for the rose. Lottie was extraordinarily good with colors and always looked so smart that sometimes Beatrice wondered if she\u2019d bought Pan, her little white Pomeranian, just because he looked so smart as well.</p><p>Beatrice eyed the little dog, lying like a miniature fur rug at their feet, alert to the possibility of biscuit crumbs.</p> <p>\u201cThe quiet gentlemen are the ones you have to watch out for,\u201d Lottie stated as she judiciously added a small lump of sugar to her tea.</p><p>It took a second for Beatrice to remember the thread of their conversation. Then she said, \u201cWell, he wasn\u2019t very quiet when he first appeared.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, indeed,\u201d Lottie said contentedly. \u201cI thought he\u2019d strangle you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sound rather thrilled by the prospect,\u201d Beatrice said severely.</p><p>\u201cIt would give me a tale to dine out on for a year or more, you must admit,\u201d Lottie replied with no trace of shame. She sipped her tea, wrinkled her nose, and added another tiny lump of sugar. \u201cNo, it\u2019s been three days, and I\u2019ve heard nothing else but the story of the lost earl bursting into your little political tea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUncle Reggie said we\u2019d be the talk of the town,\u201d Beatrice said dolefully.</p> <p>\u201cAnd for once he\u2019s right.\u201d Lottie tried her tea again and must\u2019ve found it palatable, because she smiled and set aside her cup. \u201cNow tell me: is he or is he not truly Lord Hope?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think he must be,\u201d Beatrice said slowly, choosing a biscuit from the tray on the tiny table between them. Pan raised his head and followed her hand as she transferred the pastry to her plate. \u201cBut so far no one who actually knew him from before the war has seen him.\u201d</p><p>Lottie looked up from selecting her own biscuit. \u201cWhat, no one? He has a sister, doesn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn the Colonies.\u201d Beatrice bit into her biscuit and said somewhat indistinctly, \u201cThere\u2019s an aunt as well, but she\u2019s somewhere abroad. Her butler was rather vague. And Uncle Reggie said he\u2019d met Hope, but the viscount had been a boy of ten or so at the time, so it doesn\u2019t help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, then, what about friends?\u201d Lottie asked.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s too ill to go out yet.\u201d Beatrice bit her lip. It had taken all her powers of persuasion to keep Lord Hope in the scarlet bedroom this morning. \u201cWe have sent word to the man who said he witnessed Hope\u2019s death\u2014Viscount Vale.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>Beatrice shrugged. \u201cHe\u2019s at his country estate. It may be days before he can come.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell! Then you shall simply have to play nurse to a wickedly handsome man\u2014even if he has far too much hair at the moment\u2014who is either a long-lost earl or a black scoundrel who might imperil your virtue. I must say I\u2019m terribly jealous.\u201d</p><p>Beatrice glanced down at Pan, who had discovered a fallen lump of sugar near her chair. Lottie\u2019s words made her think of the viscount\u2019s body on hers and how very heavy it had been. How she had, for a small second, almost feared for her life.</p><p>\u201cBeatrice?\u201d</p><p>Oh, dear. Lottie was sitting bolt upright, her nose practically twitching.</p><p>Beatrice affected an unconcerned look. \u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you yes me, Beatrice Rosemary Corning. You sound as if butter wouldn\u2019t melt in your mouth! What happened?\u201d</p><p>Beatrice winced. \u201cWell, he was somewhat delirious that first afternoon . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cYe-es?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd when we took him to a bedroom\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething happened in a bedroom?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt really wasn\u2019t his fault\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, my goodness!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut somehow he pulled me down on the bed and he fell, too.\u201d Beatrice glanced at Lottie\u2019s excited face and closed her eyes very tightly to say, \u201cOn top of me.\u201d</p><p>There was a small silence.</p><p>Beatrice peeked.</p><p>Lottie was goggling at her and seemed\u2014miraculously\u2014speechless.</p><p>\u201cNothing happened, really,\u201d Beatrice said somewhat weakly.</p><p>\u201cNothing!\u201d Lottie found her power of speech to nearly shout. \u201cYou were compromised.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I wasn\u2019t. The footmen were there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFootmen don\u2019t count,\u201d Lottie said, and rose to yank vigorously on the bellpull.</p><p>\u201cOf course footmen count,\u201d Beatrice said. \u201cThere were three of them. What are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRinging for more tea.\u201d Lottie looked critically at the demolished tea tray. \u201cWe\u2019ll need another pot and a new plate of biscuits, too, I think.\u201d</p><p>Beatrice looked down at her hands. \u201cThe thing is . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>Beatrice took a breath and looked at her suddenly sober friend. \u201cHe was rather frightening, Lottie.\u201d</p><p>Lottie sat down, her pretty lips tightening. \u201cDid he hurt you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. At least\u201d\u2014Beatrice shook her head\u2014\u201cfor a moment I couldn\u2019t breathe. But that was nothing. It was the look in his eyes. As if he wouldn\u2019t mind killing me.\u201d She scrunched her nose. \u201cYou must think me a fool.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not, dear.\u201d Lottie bit her lip. \u201cAre you sure he\u2019s safe to have in your uncle\u2019s house?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Beatrice admitted. \u201cBut what else are we to do? If we throw him into the street and he is the earl, we\u2019ll be judged most harshly. He might bring criminal proceedings against my uncle. I have taken the precaution of posting guards at his door.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat sounds wise.\u201d Lottie still looked troubled. \u201cHave you thought what you\u2019ll do if he is the earl?\u201d</p><p>The maid trotted in at that moment, distracting Lottie and saving Beatrice from having to answer her friend. The truth was that her chest began to tighten in a panicked sort of way when she thought of what the future might bring. If the man in the scarlet bedroom was Viscount Hope and if he succeeded in taking back the title, both she and Uncle Reggie would be out of their home. They\u2019d lose the estates and monies they\u2019d become used to in the last five years, and that would aggravate Uncle Reggie terribly. What would such a situation do to him? He might protest that the apoplexy attack he\u2019d had was nothing, but she\u2019d seen his white, sweaty face and the way he\u2019d gasped for breath. Just the memory made her press her hand to her chest. Dear God, she couldn\u2019t lose Uncle Reggie, too.</p><p>And she truly didn\u2019t want to discuss the matter at the moment.</p><p>So when Lottie plopped back down on her exquisite white and rose striped settee and looked at her expectantly, Beatrice smiled and said, \u201cI thought we were to discuss Mr. Graham and the veteran\u2019s bill today. I\u2019ve had word that Mr. Wheaton would like to have another secret meeting before\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, pooh on Nate and the veteran\u2019s bill.\u201d Lottie pulled a tasseled gold silk cushion on her lap and hugged it. \u201cI\u2019m sick to death of politics and husbands as well.\u201d</p><p>The maid bustled back in with a laden tray at that minute. Beatrice watched her friend as the fresh tea things were arranged. Lottie always spoke carelessly, but Beatrice was beginning to worry that something was really wrong between her and Mr. Graham. They\u2019d had a fashionable marriage, of course. Nathan Graham was the scion of a rather new wealthy family, while Lottie came from an old but impoverished name. Theirs had been an eminently practical union, but Beatrice thought it had been a love match as well\u2014at least on Lottie\u2019s part. Had she been wrong?</p><p>The maid bustled out again, and Beatrice said softly, \u201cLottie . . .\u201d</p><p>Her friend was pouring the tea, her gaze resolutely fixed on the teapot in her hand. \u201cDid you hear that Lady Hasselthorpe cut Mrs. Hunt dead at the Fothering\u2019s musicale yesterday? I\u2019ve heard wild speculation that it signals Lord Hasselthorpe\u2019s disapproval of Mr. Hunt, but one can\u2019t help wonder if Lady Hasselthorpe did it entirely accidentally. She is such a ninny.\u201d</p><p>Lottie held out a full teacup, and maybe it was her imagination, but Beatrice thought she saw pleading in her friend\u2019s eyes. And what could she do? She was a maiden who\u2019d reached the overripe age of four and twenty without ever receiving an offer. What did she know about matters of the heart anyway?</p><p>Beatrice sighed silently and took the teacup. \u201cAnd how did Mrs. Hunt respond?\u201d</p><p>THE PROBLEM WITH marriage, Lottie Graham reflected, was that there was such a difference between what one dreamed the matrimonial state would be like and, well, the reality.</p><p>Lottie sat back down on her settee\u2014Wallace and Sons, bought just last year for a truly scandalous sum\u2014and stared at the cooling tea things. She\u2019d seen Beatrice to the door after babbling at her dearest friend in the world for a solid half hour. Poor Beatrice must heartily regret coming over for their weekly tea.</p><p>Lottie sighed and plucked the last biscuit from the plate, crumbling it between her fingers. Darling Pan came to sit beside her skirts, his foxy little face grinning up at her.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not good for you, so many sweets,\u201d Lottie murmured, but she gave a bit of the biscuit to him anyway. He delicately took the treat between his sharp little teeth and retired with his prize beneath the gilded French armchair.</p><p>Lottie slumped into the settee, laying her arm wearily along the back. Perhaps she expected too much. Perhaps it was girlish fantasies that she should\u2019ve outgrown long ago. Perhaps all marriages, even the very best like her own mama and papa\u2019s, ultimately settled into dreary indifference, and she was simply being a ninny like Lady Hasselthorpe.</p><p>Annie, the head downstairs maid, came in to gather up the tea things. She glanced at Lottie and said hesitantly, \u201cWill there be anything else, ma\u2019am?\u201d</p><p>Oh, God, even the servants sensed it.</p><p>Lottie straightened a little, trying to look serene. \u201cNo, that\u2019ll be all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, ma\u2019am.\u201d Annie curtsied. \u201cCook was wanting to know if there\u2019ll be one or two for supper tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust one,\u201d Lottie muttered, and turned her face away.</p><p>Annie left the room quietly.</p><p>She sat there, draped on the settee, for some time, thinking wild thoughts until the door opened again a bit later.</p><p>Nate strolled in and then stopped. \u201cOh, sorry! Didn\u2019t mean to disturb you. I didn\u2019t know anyone was in here.\u201d</p><p>At Nate\u2019s voice, Pan emerged from under the armchair and pranced over to be patted. Pan had adored Nate from the very beginning.</p><p>Lottie wrinkled her nose at her pet and then said rather carelessly to Nate, \u201cI didn\u2019t know you\u2019d be home for dinner. I just told Cook there\u2019d be only one.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s all right.\u201d Nate straightened from Pan and gave her one of his wide, easy smiles\u2014the smile that had first made her heart quicken. \u201cI\u2019m dining with Collins and Rupert tonight. I just stopped in to see if I\u2019d left that Whig pamphlet here. Rupert\u2019s interested in seeing it. Ah. There \u2019tis.\u201d</p><p>Nate crossed to a table in the corner, where a messy pile of papers lay, snatching up the pamphlet in evident satisfaction. He returned to the door, engrossed in the pamphlet, and only as an afterthought did he look up as he was about to leave.</p><p>He frowned rather vaguely at Lottie. \u201cI say, that\u2019s all right, isn\u2019t it? I mean, me dining out with Collins and Rupert? I thought you were attending some other social event when I made the plan.\u201d</p><p>Lottie lifted her brow and said loftily, \u201cOh, don\u2019t mind me. I\u2019m\u2014\u201d</p> <p>But she was talking to his back.</p><p>\u201cGood, good. Knew you\u2019d understand.\u201d And he was out the door, his nose buried in that wretched pamphlet.</p><p>Lottie blew out a breath and threw a small cushion at the door, making Pan start and yip.</p><p>\u201cMarried two years and he\u2019s more interested in dinner with a couple of boring old men than me!\u201d</p><p>Pan jumped onto the settee beside her\u2014which he was strictly forbidden to do\u2014and licked her on the nose.</p> <p>Whereupon Lottie burst into tears.</p><p>FOUR AND TWENTY and never even an offer.</p><p>The thought repeated in Beatrice\u2019s head all the way home, a nasty little chant. She\u2019d never put her unmarried state into such blunt terms before. Where had the time gone? It wasn\u2019t as if she spent her days mooning about, waiting to start a life when the right gentleman finally presented himself. No, she led a busy life, a full life, she reminded herself, albeit somewhat defensively. Because Uncle Reggie had been widowed the last ten years, she\u2019d practically grown up learning to hostess for him. And while political teas, dinners, house parties, and the yearly ball might be a tad dull, they were quite a job to manage.</p><p>To be fair, she had been courted. Just last spring, Mr. Matthew Horn had seemed quite interested\u2014before he\u2019d shot himself in the head, poor man. And she\u2019d once come very close to an offer of marriage. Mr. Freddy Finch\u2014the second son of an earl, no less\u2014had been dashing and funny and had kissed her so sweetly. He\u2019d escorted her for the better part of a season several years ago. She had enjoyed their outings\u2014had enjoyed Freddy\u2014but not, as she finally realized, in any special way. She was happy to go with him on a carriage ride, but if he had to call off for some reason, she was only a little disappointed. Her own complacency she might\u2019ve lived with, but she\u2019d suspected that Freddy\u2019s emotions were no more entangled than her own, and she couldn\u2019t live with that in a marriage. When she married\u2014if she married\u2014she wanted a gentleman who was wildly, passionately in love with her.</p><p>A man who would never abandon her.</p><p>So she\u2019d broken it off with Freddy, not in any dramatic way, but simply by seeing him less and less often, eventually drifting away from him. She\u2019d been correct in her assessment of his emotional attachment, too, because not once had Freddy protested her drawing away. A year later, he\u2019d married Guinevere Crestwood, a rather plain lady who ran a tea party like an army campaign.</p> <p>Was she jealous? Beatrice stared out the carriage window while she examined her feelings, taking care to be quite honest with herself, for she despised self-deception. She shook her head. No, she could honestly say that she was not jealous of the new Mrs. Finch, even if her toddlers were quite adorable. The adorable toddlers might grow up to have Guinevere\u2019s enormous canine teeth for one thing, and for another, well, Freddy was funny and charming and quite nice-looking, but he hadn\u2019t been in love with Beatrice. Perhaps Freddy had fallen passionately in love with Guinevere, but Beatrice rather doubted it.</p><p>And that was the crux of the matter, was it not? None of the gentlemen whom she\u2019d driven in carriages with and danced with and strolled with had been interested in her with any real depth of feeling. They complimented her gowns, smiled as they danced with her, but never truly saw her\u2014the woman behind the facade. Perhaps a marriage without passion was enough for Guinevere Crestwood, but it wasn\u2019t enough for her.</p><p>She remembered now coming home from a ball, a year or more ago, and strolling into the blue sitting room and just gazing at Lord Hope\u2019s portrait. He\u2019d seemed alive with passion. Next to him\u2014even as a flat, painted image\u2014all the other gentlemen she knew faded into the background like transparent ghosts. He was more real, even then when she\u2019d thought him long dead, than those flesh-and-blood gentlemen who\u2019d squired her only hours before.</p><p>Perhaps that was the real reason she was still a maiden at four and twenty: she\u2019d been waiting for a man as passionate as she\u2019d dreamed Lord Hope was.</p><p>But was he that man?</p><p>The carriage stopped before the Blanchard town house, and Beatrice descended the steps with the help of a footman. Usually at this time she met with Cook for their weekly consultation about menus. But today she went straight to the kitchen and asked to have a tray prepared and apprised Cook of her change of plans. Then she mounted the stairs to the third floor and the scarlet room, the tray in her hands.</p><p>George, the footman stationed outside the scarlet room, nodded at her as she neared. \u201cCan I carry that tray for you, miss?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, George, but I believe I can handle it.\u201d She glanced worriedly at the door. \u201cHow is he?\u201d</p> <p>George scratched his head. \u201cOrnery, miss, if you don\u2019t mind me saying so. Didn\u2019t like the maid coming in to tend his fire. \u2019E was yelling at her something awful in that Frenchie language\u2014or so I think. Don\u2019t speak the lingo myself.\u201d</p><p>Beatrice pursed her lips and nodded. \u201cCan you knock for me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCertainly, miss.\u201d George rapped on the door.</p><p>\u201cCome,\u201d Hope said.</p><p>George held the door open and Beatrice peeked in. The viscount was sitting up in the big bed wearing a loose nightshirt and writing in a notebook on his lap. His knife lay outside the covers by his right hip. He seemed composed enough now at least, and she exhaled a grateful breath. His cheeks no longer held the hectic flush they\u2019d had the last two days, though his face was still gaunt. His long hair had been braided into a tight queue, but his jaw was still covered by his thick black beard. The top two buttons of his nightshirt had been left undone, and a few strands of dark hair were revealed, curling against the snowy cloth. For a moment, Beatrice found her gaze fixed on the sight.</p><p>\u201cCome to tend to me, Cousin Beatrice?\u201d he murmured, and she jerked her gaze up. Knowing black eyes met hers.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve brought some tea and muffins,\u201d she said tartly. \u201cAnd you needn\u2019t sound so snide. You\u2019ve scared most of the maids, and George said you yelled at one just this morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe didn\u2019t knock.\u201d He watched as she came in and placed the tray on a table by the bed.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s hardly a reason to frighten her.\u201d</p><p>He looked away irritably. \u201cI don\u2019t like people in my rooms. She should not have come in without leave.\u201d</p><p>She eyed him, her voice softening. \u201cThe servants are trained not to knock. I think you\u2019ll have to become used to it. But until you do, I\u2019ll warn them to knock at your door.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged, reaching for a muffin on the tray. He shoved half of it into his mouth rudely.</p><p>She sighed and pulled a chair near the bed, sitting in it. \u201cYou seem ravenous.\u201d</p><p>He paused in the act of grabbing another muffin. \u201cYou\u2019ve obviously never had to eat wormy biscuits and watered ale on board a ship.\u201d He bit into the muffin, his black eyes watching her defiantly.</p><p>She stared back calmly, hiding the tremor of unease at his look. His eyes were feral, like a starving wolf. \u201cNo, I\u2019ve never been on board a ship. Did you sail home recently?\u201d</p><p>He looked away, silently eating the rest of the second muffin. For a moment, she thought he wouldn\u2019t answer her. Then he said bitterly, \u201cI took a position as a cook\u2019s assistant. Not that there was much food to cook.\u201d</p><p>She looked at him wonderingly. What straits had made the son of an earl take such mean labor? \u201cWhere did you sail from?\u201d</p><p>He grimaced and then glanced up at her slyly through black eyelashes. \u201cDo you know, I don\u2019t recall having a cousin Beatrice.\u201d</p><p>Obviously he had no intention of answering her. Beatrice stifled a sigh of frustration. \u201cThat\u2019s because I\u2019m not your cousin. At least not by blood.\u201d</p><p>He might\u2019ve meant his question as a diversion, but now he cocked his head in interest. \u201cExplain.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d set aside his notebook, and his whole attention was concentrated on her, making her feel rather self-conscious. Beatrice rose and busied herself pouring the tea as she talked. \u201cMy mother was sister to Uncle Reggie\u2019s wife, my aunt Mary. Mother died when I was born, and I was five when my father died. Aunt Mary and Uncle Reggie took me in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA sad story,\u201d he said mockingly.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Beatrice shook her head, handing him a cup of tea with no milk but with lots of sugar. \u201cNot really. I\u2019ve always been loved, always been cared for, first by my father and then by Uncle Reggie and Aunt Mary. They had no children of their own, so they treated me just as they would a daughter, perhaps even better. Uncle Reggie has been wonderful to me.\u201d She looked at him earnestly. \u201cHe\u2019s a good man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen perhaps I should relinquish my title and let Uncle Reggie keep it.\u201d His voice was sardonic.</p><p>\u201cYou needn\u2019t be mean,\u201d she replied with dignity.</p><p>\u201cShouldn\u2019t I?\u201d He studied her as if he couldn\u2019t quite make her out.</p><p>\u201cNo. There\u2019s no need. It\u2019s just that this is our house now\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019m supposed to take pity on you for that? Lay down my arms and make peace?\u201d</p><p>She inhaled to control her temper. \u201cMy uncle is old. He doesn\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy title, my lands, my monies, my goddamned life have been stolen from me, madam,\u201d he said, his voice rising with each word. \u201cThink you I care a whit for your uncle?\u201d</p><p>She stared. He was so angry, so determined. Where was the laughing boy in the painting? Had he entirely disappeared? \u201cYou were thought dead. No one meant to steal your title from you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTheir intention is of no matter to me,\u201d he said. \u201cI care only about the result. I\u2019ve been deprived of what is rightfully mine. I have no home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut Uncle Reggie isn\u2019t to blame!\u201d she cried, losing her self-possession at last. \u201cI\u2019m just trying to explain to you that this isn\u2019t a war. We can be civilized about\u2014\u201d</p><p>He flung the teacup against the wall and then swept his arm in an abrupt, violent gesture across the table. Beatrice was forced to hop out of the way as the tray, plate, and teapot\u2014filled with hot tea\u2014all crashed to the floor where\u2019d she been standing.</p><p>\u201cHow dare you?\u201d she demanded, staring first at the mess on the floor and then at the savage in the bed. \u201cHow dare you?\u201d</p><p>His black eyes burned so fiercely she felt her skin heat. \u201cIf you don\u2019t think this a war, madam,\u201d he said softly, \u201cthen you are even more naive than I thought.\u201d</p><p>Beatrice set her hands on her hips and leaned forward, her voice shaking with rage. \u201cPerhaps I am naive. Perhaps it is silly and girlish and... and foolish to think that one can settle even difficult matters in a civilized fashion. But I\u2019d rather be a complete ninny than a nasty sarcastic man so lost to bitterness that he\u2019s forgotten his own humanity!\u201d</p><p>She turned to sweep from the room, but her dramatic exit was destroyed when he caught her wrist. He yanked, and, caught off balance, she fell back against the bed, across his lap. She gasped and looked up. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Into blazing black eyes.</p><p>He leaned so close she felt his breath across her lips.

She could feel the heat of his body coming off him in waves. Her bosom was nearly pressed to his chest, and to make matters worse, that sparkling black gaze fell to her mouth.</p><p>As she watched, his lips parted and his eyelids drooped as he growled softly, \u201cAnd I will use any means at my disposal to win this war.\u201d</p> <p>So mesmerized was she by the wicked intent in his eyes that she started when the door to the bedroom opened. Lord Hope abruptly released her arms. He was staring behind her at the intruder. For a fleeting second, she thought she saw something like joy cross his face, but so suddenly did it disappear that perhaps she was mistaken.</p><p>In any case, both his countenance and his voice were stony when he spoke.</p><p>\u201cRenshaw.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Three</p><p>\u201cCome, sir,\u201d cried the Goblin King, \u201cI\u2019ll give you fifty gold coins for that sword. Tell me you\u2019ll agree.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI fear I cannot,\u201d Longsword replied.</p><p>\u201cThen surely you\u2019ll part with it for one hundred gold coins? It is but an old and rusting sword, and you can buy twenty more the same or better for that price.\u201d</p><p>At this Longsword laughed. \u201cSir, I\u2019ll not sell you my sword for any price you name, and I\u2019ll tell you why: to relinquish this sword would cost me my very life, for it and I are bound together magically.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, if that is the case,\u201d the Goblin King said craftily, \u201cwill you sell me a lock of your hair for one penny?\u201d</p><p>\u2014from Longsword</p><p>For seven years, Reynaud had thought about what he would say and how he would feel when he saw Jasper Renshaw again. The questions he would ask, the explanations he would demand. And now, now that the moment was here, he searched within himself and felt... nothing.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s Vale now,\u201d the man standing by the door said. His face was a little more lined, his eyes slightly more sad, but otherwise he was the same man Reynaud had played with as a boy. The same man he\u2019d bought a commission with. The same man he\u2019d considered his best friend.</p><p>The man who\u2019d left him for dead in a savage foreign land.</p><p>\u201cYou attained the title, then?\u201d Reynaud asked.</p><p>Vale nodded. He still stood just inside the door, hat in hand. He stared at Reynaud as if trying to decipher the thoughts of a wild beast.</p><p>Miss Corning straightened from where he\u2019d pulled her across his lap. So intent was he on Vale that he\u2019d almost forgotten her presence. He made a belated grab for her hand but was too late. She\u2019d moved away from the bed and was beyond his reach. He\u2019d have to wait for another time when she might step unwarily close again.</p><p>She cleared her throat. \u201cI believe we met once at one of your mother\u2019s garden parties, Lord Vale.\u201d</p><p>Vale\u2019s gaze jerked to her, and he blinked before a wide smile spread across his face. He bowed extravagantly. \u201cForgive me, gentle lady. You are?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy cousin, Miss Corning,\u201d Reynaud growled. No need to tell Vale the connection was not a blood one\u2014he\u2019d make what claim he could.</p> <p>Vale\u2019s thick eyebrows rose. \u201cI never knew you had a female cousin.\u201d</p><p>Reynaud smiled thinly. \u201cShe\u2019s newly discovered.\u201d</p><p>Miss Corning looked between the men, her brows knitted, clearly confused. \u201cShall I send for tea?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, please,\u201d Vale said, while at the same time Reynaud shook his head. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Vale looked at him, his smile gone.</p><p>Miss Corning cleared her throat again. \u201cWell, I think, ah, yes, I think I\u2019ll leave you two to yourselves. There must be many things you\u2019d like to catch up on.\u201d</p><p>She walked to the door where Vale still stood and whispered to him, \u201cJust don\u2019t stay too long. He\u2019s been very ill.\u201d</p><p>Vale nodded, holding the door for her and then shutting it gently after she\u2019d left. He turned to look at Reynaud.</p><p>Who snapped, \u201cI\u2019m not an invalid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been ill?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI took a fever on the ship over. It\u2019s nothing.\u201d</p><p>Vale raised his eyebrows but didn\u2019t comment on that. Instead he asked, \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>Reynaud smiled sardonically. \u201cI think I should be asking that of you.\u201d</p><p>Vale looked away, his face paling. \u201cI thought\u2014we all thought\u2014that you were dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t.\u201d Reynaud bit off the words, his incisors closing with sharp finality.</p><p>He remembered the stink of burning flesh. The binds cutting into his arms. Of marching naked through new snowfall. Her brown eyes stared up through a mask of blood.... He shook his head once, sharply, chasing the ghosts from his mind, focusing on the living man before him. His hand moved to the hilt of his knife.</p><p>Vale watched his movement warily. \u201cI would never have left you had I known you lived.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYet the fact remains that I was alive and you did leave me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I . . .\u201d Vale\u2019s mouth flattened. He stared at the carpet between his feet. \u201cI saw you die, Reynaud.\u201d</p><p>For a moment, demons chattered in Reynaud\u2019s brain, whispering of treachery. He saw clearly the grimace a dying man made while being burned alive. Then, with an effort, he pushed back the image and the mad voices.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened at the Wyandot camp?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cAfter they took you away, you mean?\u201d Vale didn\u2019t wait for the reply but sighed heavily. \u201cThey tied us to stakes and tortured the other men\u2014Munroe, Horn, Growe, and Coleman. They killed Coleman.\u201d</p><p>Reynaud nodded. He\u2019d seen how the enemies\u2014both white and native\u2014were treated by the Indians who captured them.</p><p>Vale inhaled, as if bracing himself. \u201cThen, after Coleman\u2019s death on the second day, the Indians took us to where they were burning a man at the stake. They told us it was you. He wore your coat, had black hair. I thought he was you. We all thought he was you.\u201d Vale looked up, meeting Reynaud\u2019s gaze with haunted turquoise eyes. \u201cHis face was already gone. Blackened and burned by the flames.\u201d</p><p>Reynaud looked away. The reasonable part of his mind knew that Vale and the others had had no choice. They\u2019d believed him dead because of overwhelming evidence. Any sane man would believe the same when faced with what they\u2019d seen and been told.</p><p>And yet...</p><p>And yet the beast at his core refused the explanation. He\u2019d been abandoned, left by those he\u2019d risked life and limb for. Left by those he\u2019d called his friends.</p><p>\u201cIt was almost another fortnight before Sam Hartley brought back a rescue party to ransom us,\u201d Vale said quietly. \u201cWere you in the Indian camp that entire time?\u201d</p><p>Reynaud shook his head, watching his left hand flatten against the counterpane, noting absently the contrast of his brown skin against the white fabric. His hand was thin, the tendons standing out clearly on the back. \u201cHow is my sister, Emeline?\u201d</p><p>He heard Vale sigh as if frustrated. \u201cEmeline. Emeline is just fine. She\u2019s remarried now, you know. To Samuel Hartley.\u201d</p><p>Reynaud\u2019s head jerked up, his eyes narrowing. \u201cCorporal Hartley? The ranger?\u201d</p><p>Vale smirked. \u201cThe same, although he\u2019s no longer a lowly corporal. He\u2019s made his fortune importing and exporting goods from the Colonies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMiss Corning told me that she married a colonial, but I hadn\u2019t realized it was Hartley.\u201d Even if Hartley was wealthy now, Emeline had married beneath her station. She was the daughter of an earl. What had possessed her?</p><p>\u201cHe came to London a year ago for business and for other matters and quite stole your sister\u2019s heart, I think.\u201d</p><p>Reynaud contemplated that information, his mind spinning in confusion and anger. Had Emeline changed so much in seven years? Or were his memories tainted? Warped by time and all that had been done to him?</p><p>\u201cWhat happened, Reynaud?\u201d Vale asked softly. \u201cHow did you escape death at the Indian camp?\u201d</p><p>Reynaud\u2019s head jerked up. He glared at his former friend. \u201cDo you really care?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Vale looked bewildered. \u201cYes, of course.\u201d</p><p>Vale stared at him as if waiting for the story, but Reynaud was damned if he\u2019d rip open his soul for him.</p><p>Finally Vale looked away. \u201cAh. Well, I\u2019m glad\u2014very glad\u2014that you\u2019re back safe and sound.\u201d</p><p>Reynaud nodded. \u201cIs that it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that it?\u201d Reynaud enunciated. He was tired and needed sleep, dammit, though he wouldn\u2019t let the other man know it. \u201cHave you finished whatever you came for?\u201d</p><p>Vale\u2019s head snapped back as if he\u2019d been clipped in the chin. Then he widened his stance, squared his shoulders, and leveled his head. A wide, unamused smile spread across his lips. \u201cNot quite.\u201d</p><p>Reynaud raised his eyebrows.</p><p>\u201cI also wanted to talk to you about the traitor,\u201d Vale said silkily.</p><p>Reynaud shook his head. \u201cTraitor...?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe man who betrayed us to the Indians at Spinner\u2019s Falls,\u201d Vale said as a roaring began in Reynaud\u2019s ears that almost drowned his last words. \u201cA traitor with a French mother.\u201d</p><p>BEATRICE HEARD THE crash as she mounted the stairs with another tray of tea and biscuits. She paused on the grand staircase, gazing blindly upward at the floor above. Had it been an accident? A China figurine or a clock falling off the mantel? The thought was hopeful, but she sped her steps, rounding into the upper hallway as the second crash hit. Oh, dear. It sounded rather as if Lord Hope and Lord Vale might be murdering each other.</p><p>Down the hall, the door to Lord Hope\u2019s room burst open and Viscount Vale stomped out, angry but blessedly still intact.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t think this is over, Reynaud,\u201d he called. \u201cDamn you, I\u2019ll be back.\u201d</p><p>He jammed his tricorne on his head and turned and saw Beatrice. A sheepish look momentarily crossed his face.</p><p>Then he nodded curtly. \u201cYour pardon, ma\u2019am. You might not want to go in there at the moment. He\u2019s not fit for civilized company.\u201d</p><p>She glanced at the door to the scarlet room and then back to Lord Vale. As he neared, she saw with horror that a red mark marred his chin.</p><p>As if someone had struck him.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cHe\u2019s not the man I once knew. His emotions are... extreme. Savage. Please, be careful.\u201d</p><p>Lord Vale bowed gracefully and then strode past her and down the stairs.</p><p>Beatrice watched him disappear before glancing at the tray still in her hands. The tea had spilled a bit, staining the linen cloth covering the bottom of the tray. She could go back to the kitchens and have one of the maids lay a new tray\u2014and perhaps have the girl deliver it as well. Except that would be cowardly. It wasn\u2019t her duty to send servant girls into places she herself was afraid to venture.</p><p>She looked down the hall. The door to Lord Hope\u2019s room still stood open. He was in there all alone.</p><p>She squared her shoulders and marched to the open door. \u201cI\u2019ve brought some more tea and biscuits,\u201d she announced briskly as she sailed into the room. \u201cI thought you might actually drink it this time.\u201d</p><p>Hope was lying in the bed, turned toward the wall, and at first she thought he might be asleep, silly as that notion was after the commotion of before.</p><p>He didn\u2019t turn. \u201cGet out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou seem to be under a misapprehension,\u201d she said conversationally.</p><p>She started to set the tray on the little table beside the bed, but there were shards scattered in an arc away from the table, comprised of what had once been an ugly china clock and a matching pair of ceramic pugs. Added as it was to the previous tea things she\u2019d brought up before Lord Vale\u2019s visit, it was beginning to be quite a pile. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She turned to a table near the window\u2014well out of reach of the bed.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you babbling about?\u201d Hope muttered.</p><p>\u201cHmm?\u201d The table was already occupied by a vase and a brass candelabra, and Beatrice had to maneuver the tea tray carefully to avoid yet another spill.</p><p>\u201cThe misapprehension you said I was under,\u201d Hope growled in a testy voice.</p> <p>\u201cOh.\u201d The tray settled, Beatrice looked over at him and smiled, even though he still had his back to her. \u201cYou seem to think I\u2019m one of the servants.\u201d</p><p>There was a silence from the bed as Beatrice poured the tea. Perhaps he was covered in shame at her mild set-down.</p><p>\u201cYou do keep bringing me tea.\u201d</p><p>Or perhaps not.</p><p>\u201cTea is very fortifying, I find, especially when one feels under the weather.\u201d She added sugar to the tea\u2014she\u2019d noticed he seemed to like his tea very sweet\u2014and brought the teacup to the bed. \u201cBut that does not mean I enjoy being addressed in such sour tones.\u201d</p> <p>He still faced the wall. She hesitated a moment, the cup held uncertainly in her hand; then she placed it carefully on the table. It was an ugly cup with an orange and black decoration depicting a rather lopsided bridge, but still. One didn\u2019t like to see the china smashed.</p><p>\u201cWould you like some tea?\u201d she asked.</p><p>One large shoulder shrugged, but otherwise he didn\u2019t move. What had happened between him and Lord Vale?</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll warm your spirits,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>He snorted. \u201cI doubt that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell.\u201d She smoothed her skirts. \u201cI\u2019ll leave you, then.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>The single word was so low she almost missed it. She looked at him. He hadn\u2019t moved, and she wasn\u2019t sure what to do. What he wanted.</p><p>His upper arm lay outside the coverlet, and she took a step forward and reached out a hand. It was entirely improper, but for some reason, it seemed right. She touched his hand, large and warm. Slowly she burrowed her fingers under his hand until she grasped it in her own. He squeezed her fingers gently. She felt a point of warmth start in her breast, spreading gradually like a widening pool of warm water until her entire body was lit from within and she identified the feeling. Happiness. He made her wildly, inappropriately happy with just the squeeze of his fingers, and she knew she should be wary of this feeling. Be wary of him.</p><p>And then he spoke, low. \u201cHe thinks me a traitor.\u201d</p><p>Her heart stopped. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>He turned then, finally, his face a mask, his eyes shadowed, but he did not let go of her hand. \u201cYou know our regiment, the Twenty-eighth of Foot, was massacred in the Colonies?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d The massacre was common knowledge\u2014one of the worst tragedies of the war.</p><p>\u201cVale says that someone gave away our position. That we were betrayed to the French and their Indian allies by a man within the ranks of our own regiment.\u201d</p> <p>Beatrice swallowed. How terrible to know that so many had died because of one person\u2019s perfidy. And the knowledge of a traitor would be even more terrible for Lord Hope. Somehow, she still wasn\u2019t sure how\u2014and really she was just about dying to ask\u2014his seven lost years were connected to Spinner\u2019s Falls and the tragedy there.</p><p>All this went through her mind, but Beatrice merely said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t understand.\u201d He tugged her hand for emphasis. \u201cThe traitor had a French mother. Vale thinks I am the traitor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut... but that\u2019s silly,\u201d Beatrice exclaimed without thought. \u201cI mean, not the French mother part\u2014that makes sense, I suppose\u2014but that anyone would think you a traitor... that... that isn\u2019t right at all.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t say anything, merely squeezed her hand again.</p><p>\u201cI thought,\u201d Beatrice said cautiously, \u201cthat Lord Vale was your friend?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs did I. But that was seven years ago, and I fear I no longer know the man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that why you struck him?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He shrugged.</p><p>Beatrice shivered at the confirmation of her fears. She remembered Lord Vale\u2019s warning in the hall: Be careful. Still, she wet her lips and said, \u201cI think anyone who truly knows you would realize that you don\u2019t have it in you to be a traitor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut then you don\u2019t know me.\u201d At last he let her hand drop, and the warmth began to leak from her body with the loss of contact. \u201cYou don\u2019t know me at all.\u201d</p><p>Beatrice inhaled slowly. \u201cYou are correct. I do not know you.\u201d She went to take the tea tray. \u201cBut then perhaps the fault for that is not wholly mine.\u201d</p><p>She closed the door gently behind her.</p><p>EVEN THOUGH BEATRICE visited Jeremy Oates at least once a week\u2014and more often two or three times\u2014his butler, Putley, always pretended he did not know her.</p><p>\u201cWho shall I say is calling?\u201d Putley asked early the next afternoon, his pop eyes staring at her in what looked like appalled surprise.</p><p>\u201cMiss Beatrice Corning,\u201d Beatrice replied as she always did, suppressing an urge to make up a name.</p><p>Putley was only doing his job. Well, at least that was the most charitable explanation, and Beatrice did try to be charitable when she could.</p><p>\u201cVery well, miss,\u201d Putley intoned. \u201cWill you wait in the sitting room whilst I ascertain if Mr. Oates is at home?\u201d</p><p>Charity was one thing, ridiculous adherence to form was another. \u201cMr.\u201d Oates was never anywhere but home. Beatrice rolled her eyes. \u201cYes, Putley.\u201d</p><p>He showed her to the second-best sitting room, a musty room with very little light and an overabundance of heavy, dark furniture. She used the time waiting for Putley\u2019s return to compose herself. Beatrice was still a little warm from her discussion with Lord Hope, and she\u2019d felt ever so slightly guilty after she\u2019d left his room. After all, should a lady set a gentleman down so thoroughly when he was bedridden and had just had a falling out with his best friend whom he\u2019d not seen in nearly seven years? Wasn\u2019t she being just a tad mean? But then again, he\u2019d been so very nasty with her. She knew he must be frustrated\u2014enraged, even\u2014by everything that\u2019d happened since his return to England, but really, must he use her as his whipping boy?</p><p>Putley returned at that moment with the news that Jeremy would indeed see her, and Beatrice followed the butler\u2019s disapproving back up the two flights of stairs to Jeremy\u2019s room.</p><p>\u201cMiss Beatrice Corning to see you, sir,\u201d Putley droned.</p><p>Beatrice pushed past the butler and into the room. Enough was enough. She turned a dazzling smile on Putley and said firmly, \u201cThat will be all.\u201d</p><p>The butler rumbled under his breath but left the room, closing the door behind him.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s getting worse, you know.\u201d Beatrice strode to the window and shoved back one side of the curtains. The light sometimes hurt Jeremy\u2019s eyes, but it couldn\u2019t be good for him to lie in a dark room in the middle of the day, either.</p><p>\u201cI try to think of it as a compliment,\u201d Jeremy drawled from the bed.</p><p>His voice was weaker than the last time she\u2019d visited. She took a deep breath and pasted on a wide smile before turning back around. The bed dominated the area, surrounded by the debris of a sickroom. Two tables stood within reach of the bed, their surfaces covered with small bottles, boxes of ointment, books, pens and ink, bandages, and glasses. An old wooden chair was to one side, a silk cord wound around the back, the ends tossed on the seat. Sometimes Jeremy found it easier for the footmen to tie him to the chair when they moved him before the fireplace.</p><p>\u201cAfter all,\u201d Jeremy said, \u201cPutley must have some confidence in my ability to ravish you if he disapproves so much of your visits.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr perhaps he\u2019s simply an idiot,\u201d Beatrice said as she pulled a stuffed chair closer to the bed.</p><p>There was an acrid smell; this near the bed\u2014a combination of urine and other noxious bodily emissions\u2014but she took care to keep her face pleasant. When Jeremy had first come home from the war on the Continent five years ago, he\u2019d been horrified at the sickroom smells. She wasn\u2019t sure now if he\u2019d become used to the odors and ignored them or if he simply no longer smelled them, but in any case, she wouldn\u2019t hurt his feelings by drawing attention to them.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve brought you the news sheets and some pamphlets my footman procured for me,\u201d Beatrice began as she drew the papers from a soft bag.</p><p>\u201cOh, no, you don\u2019t,\u201d Jeremy said. His voice was teasing, even in his weakened state.</p><p>She looked up to meet his clear blue eyes. Jeremy had the most beautiful eyes of anyone she knew, either woman or man. They were a true light blue, the color of the sky in spring. No other color muddied their depths. He was\u2014or had been\u2014a very handsome man. His hair was a golden brown, his face open and cheerful, but the ravages of his illness had incised lines of pain around his mouth and eyes.</p><p>Jeremy\u2019s mother had been a lifelong friend of Beatrice\u2019s aunt Mary, so Beatrice and Jeremy had practically grown up in each other\u2019s pockets. He knew her as no one else did\u2014not even Lottie. When she looked into Jeremy\u2019s eyes, sometimes she felt that those blue orbs saw right past the cheerful mask she put on in his presence, straight to the well of sorrow for him at her middle.</p><p>She glanced away, down at the coverlet of his bed. To the place, in fact, where his legs should\u2019ve been. \u201cWhat\u2014?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t pretend innocence with me, Beatrice Corning,\u201d he said with the same grin he\u2019d had at eight years of age. \u201cI may be an invalid, but I still have my sources of gossip, and they are abuzz with the news of your viscount\u2019s return.\u201d</p><p>Beatrice wrinkled her nose. \u201cHe\u2019s not my viscount.\u201d</p><p>Jeremy cocked his head against the pillows. Usually he was sitting erect by this time in the afternoon, but today he was lying on his back. Beatrice felt a frisson of fear bolt through her vitals. Was he worse?</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t think who else\u2019s viscount he might be if not yours,\u201d he teased. \u201cIsn\u2019t this the same man as the pretty youth in that portrait in your sitting room? I\u2019ve watched you moon over that thing for years.\u201d</p><p>Beatrice twisted her fingers guiltily. \u201cWas I so obvious as all that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly to me, darling,\u201d Jeremy replied fondly. \u201cOnly to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Jeremy, I\u2019m such a wigeon!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, yes, but an adorable one, you must admit.\u201d</p><p>Beatrice sighed forlornly. \u201cIt\u2019s just that he\u2019s not at all what I thought he\u2019d be like. Well, if I thought about him still being alive, which of course I didn\u2019t, because we all thought him dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? He\u2019s ugly?\u201d Jeremy contorted his features into a grotesque scowl.</p><p>\u201cNooo, although he has a beard and terribly long hair at the moment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeards are disgusting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot on ship captains,\u201d Beatrice objected.</p><p>\u201cEspecially on ship captains,\u201d Jeremy said sternly. \u201cThere\u2019s no point in trying to make exceptions. One must be firm on the subject.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGranted.\u201d Beatrice waved a hand. \u201cBut believe me, the beard is the least of it in Viscount Hope\u2019s case. He\u2019s been tattooed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cScandalous,\u201d Jeremy breathed in delight. Flags of high color were flaming on his cheeks.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m overexciting you.\u201d Beatrice frowned.</p><p>\u201cNot at all,\u201d he replied. \u201cBut even if you were, I\u2019d beg you to go on. I\u2019m here every day, all day and night, Bea, dear. I need the excitement. So, tell me. What is the real problem with Lord Hope? He may have a bushy beard and tattooed himself with anchors and snakes, but I don\u2019t think that\u2019s what\u2019s troubling you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTriangular birds,\u201d Beatrice said absently. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe tattoos are strange little birds, three of them, around his right eye. What could\u2019ve possessed him to have them placed there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t the faintest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just that he\u2019s so bitter, Jeremy!\u201d she burst out. \u201cHe\u2019s... he\u2019s positively hateful sometimes, as if whatever happened to him seared his very soul.\u201d</p> <p>Jeremy was silent a moment; then he said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry. He was in the war, wasn\u2019t he? In the Colonies?\u201d</p><p>Beatrice nodded.</p><p>He sighed and said slowly, \u201cIt\u2019s hard to explain to someone who has never experienced it, but war and the things that happen in war, the things one is forced to do and see sometimes... well, they change a man. Make him harsher, if he has any sensitivity at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right, of course,\u201d she said, twisting her hands. \u201cBut it seems more than that somehow. Oh, I wish I knew what he\u2019s been doing for the last seven years!\u201d</p><p>Jeremy half smiled. \u201cWhatever it was, I doubt your knowing his history will change anything about him now.\u201d</p> <p>Beatrice looked at him, into his dear, much too perceptive eyes. \u201cI\u2019m an idiot, aren\u2019t I? Expecting a romantic prince, from a man I knew only from a portrait.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps,\u201d he conceded. \u201cBut if it were not for romantic dreams, life would be terribly dull, don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p><p>She wrinkled her nose at him. \u201cYou always know exactly what to say, Jeremy, dear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I know,\u201d he said complacently. \u201cNow, tell me. Will he take your uncle\u2019s title from him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think he must.\u201d Beatrice frowned down at her clasped hands, feeling her chest tighten. \u201cJust this morning, Viscount Vale came to visit him, and although they argued, I don\u2019t think there can be any more doubt that he is, indeed, Viscount Hope.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd if he is?\u201d</p> <p>She glanced at him, wondering if he knew how panicked the prospect made her. \u201cWe\u2019ll lose the house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can always come live with me,\u201d he teased.</p><p>She smiled, but her lips trembled. \u201cUncle Reggie might just have another attack of apoplexy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s tougher than you give him credit for,\u201d he said gently.</p><p>She bit her lip, not even pretending to smile now. \u201cBut if he does become ill, if anything happened to him... Oh, Jeremy, I just don\u2019t know what I\u2019d do.\u201d</p><p>She pressed her hand to her chest, rubbing at the constriction.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll come right in the end, Bea, dear,\u201d Jeremy said soothingly. \u201cThere\u2019s no use worrying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d she sighed, and tried to look cheerful for him. \u201cUncle Reggie had an appointment this morning with his solicitors. He came back just before I left.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHmm. That\u2019ll be a mess. If your uncle doesn\u2019t just hand over the title, I expect they\u2019ll have to present their case to parliament.\u201d Jeremy looked cheerful. \u201cI wonder if there\u2019ll be fisticuffs at Westminster?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou needn\u2019t sound so happy at the prospect,\u201d Beatrice scolded.</p><p>\u201cOh, I don\u2019t see why not. It\u2019s things like this that make the English aristocracy so very entertaining.\u201d Despite his words, Jeremy ended with a gasp. His hand on top of the coverlet balled into a tight fist, his knuckles white.</p><p>Beatrice started up from her chair. \u201cAre you in pain?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no. Don\u2019t fuss, Bea, dear.\u201d Jeremy took a breath, and she knew that he was in pain even though he denied it. His face had gone a little gray, save for those ever-present flags of color on his cheeks.</p><p>\u201cHere, let me help you sit up so you can take some water.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDammit, Bea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow, don\u2019t you fuss, Jeremy, dear,\u201d she said softly but firmly as she took his shoulders and helped him to sit. Heat radiated off him in waves. \u201cI\u2019ve earned this right, I think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you have,\u201d he gasped.</p><p>She poured water into a small cup and held it out to him.</p><p>He sipped some and gave her back the cup. \u201cHave you thought what it would mean if Hope becomes the Earl of Blanchard?\u201d</p><p>She set the cup on one of the crowded tables, frowning. \u201cI just told you, Uncle Reggie and I will have to move out of the town house\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but beyond that, Bea.\u201d Jeremy waved aside her loss of a home. \u201cHe would replace your uncle Reggie in the House of Lords.\u201d</p><p>Beatrice slowly sank back into her seat. \u201cLord Hasselthorpe would lose a vote.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd, more importantly, we might gain one,\u201d Jeremy said with significance. \u201cDo you know what Hope\u2019s political leanings are?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t the faintest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis father was a Tory,\u201d Jeremy mused.</p><p>\u201cOh, then he probably is, too,\u201d Beatrice said, disappointed.</p><p>\u201cSons don\u2019t always follow in their father\u2019s political footsteps. If Hope votes in favor of Mr. Wheaton\u2019s bill, we may win at last.\u201d The high color had spread over Jeremy\u2019s face in his excitement, so now he glowed as if he were being consumed by a fire within. \u201cMy men\u2014the soldiers who served and fought so valiantly under me\u2014would get the pension they deserve.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll find out which way he leans politically. Perhaps I can convince him to our side.\u201d Beatrice smiled, trying to share Jeremy\u2019s enthusiasm, but inside she was doubtful. Lord Hope seemed solely focused on his own affairs. She\u2019d seen nothing so far to make her think he would care one way or the other about common soldiers.</p><p>FIVE DAYS OF a sickbed had made Reynaud damnably restless. Annoying as Miss Corning\u2019s regular visits to his room were\u2014she seemed to think it normal to simply swan in without inquiring first if he wanted her company\u2014the fact was that he\u2019d grown used to her. Used to teasing her and arguing with her. And where was the woman today? He\u2019d seen neither hide nor hair of her.</p><p>Reynaud dragged himself from the bed, pulled on his old blue coat, and snatched up his knife before throwing open the door to his room. A young footman was stationed outside his room\u2014presumably to keep him from running amok in his own house.</p><p>Reynaud glared at the fellow. \u201cTell Miss Corning I\u2019d like a word with her.\u201d</p><p>He started to close the door, but the man said, \u201cCan\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Reynaud paused. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t,\u201d the footman said. \u201cShe\u2019s not here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen when is she expected back?\u201d</p><p>The footman stepped back nervously before catching himself and straightening. \u201cNot too long, I expect, but I can\u2019t say for sure. She\u2019s visitin\u2019 Mr. Oates, and sometimes she stays there a fair while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho,\u201d Reynaud inquired gently, \u201cis Mr. Oates?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMr. Jeremy Oates, that is,\u201d the man said, becoming chatty. \u201cOf the Suffolk Oates. Family with quite a bit of money, or so I\u2019m told. \u2019E and Miss Corning have known each other a long, long time, and she likes to visit \u2019im three or four times a week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen he\u2019s an aging gentleman?\u201d Reynaud asked.</p><p>The footman scratched his head. \u201cDon\u2019t think so. A young, \u2019andsome gentleman, so I hear.\u201d</p><p>It occurred to Reynaud at this point that although he\u2019d seen Miss Corning every day since his return to England, he didn\u2019t actually know much about the woman. Was this Oates\u2014this proper English gentleman\u2014a beau? Or a fianc\u00e9? The thought spurred a primitive part of him, and he blurted the next question.</p><p>\u201cIs she engaged to him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet,\u201d the footman replied, winking cheerfully. \u201cBut can\u2019t be long, can it, if she visits \u2019im so often? \u2019Course, there is the matter of \u2019is\u2014\u201d</p><p>But Reynaud wasn\u2019t listening anymore. He pushed past the ass and started for the stairs.</p><p>\u201cOy!\u201d the footman called from behind him. \u201cWhere\u2019re you goin\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo meet Miss Corning at the door,\u201d Reynaud growled. His legs were shakier than he\u2019d realized, and it only made him more irritable. He gripped the banister with one hand as he descended slowly. He moved like a goddamned old man.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not supposed to let you leave your room,\u201d the footman said, suddenly beside him. He took Reynaud\u2019s elbow to help him, and so weak was Reynaud that he didn\u2019t even protest the familiarity.</p><p>\u201cWho ordered you to keep me in my room?\u201d Reynaud demanded.</p><p>\u201cMiss Corning. She was worried you might injure yourself.\u201d The footman glanced at him sideways. \u201cDon\u2019t suppose I can get you to go back, m\u2019lord?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Reynaud replied shortly. He was panting, dammit. Only a month ago, he\u2019d walked all day without wearying, and now he panted descending a damned staircase!</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t think so,\u201d the man said matter-of-factly. He didn\u2019t say anything else until they made the entrance hall. \u201cWould you like some water, m\u2019lord, while you wait?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease.\u201d Reynaud leaned against the wall until the man disappeared in the direction of the kitchens. Then he went to the front doors and pulled them open.</p><p>The wind caught his breath as he went out on the step. The day was gray and cold, winter spreading her wings on London. There\u2019d be snow on the ground north of Lake Michigan now, and the bears would be fat and slow, preparing for their winter sleep. He remembered how Gaho had loved to eat bear meat fried in its own fat. She would smile when he brought her a freshly killed sow or boar, the wrinkles in her brown cheeks deepening, her eyes nearly disappearing in her happiness. For a moment, his former life and his present merged and wavered in front of his eyes, and he forgot where he was. Who he was.</p><p>Then the Blanchard carriage pulled up in front of the town house.</p><p>The footman jumped down and set the step. Reynaud straightened and started for the carriage. The door opened and Miss Corning descended the steps.</p><p>Her brows snapped together when she saw him. \u201cWhat are you doing out of bed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve come to meet you,\u201d Reynaud said, his voice hard. \u201cWhere have you been?\u201d</p><p>She ignored his question. \u201cI can\u2019t believe you\u2019re so silly as to stand outside in the cold. You must go in at once. Arthur\u201d\u2014she beckoned to the carriage footman\u2014\u201cplease take Lord Hope in\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to be taken anywhere,\u201d Reynaud said with deadly calm. The carriage footman took one look at him and found a consuming interest in putting away the step. \u201cI\u2019m not a child or half-wit to be taken care of. I repeat, where have you been?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you must allow me to help you inside.\u201d Miss Corning dismissed his growing anger with a wave of her hand.</p><p>He gripped her arms, making her end her sentence on a squeak. \u201cAnswer me.\u201d</p><p>Something green flared within her eyes, a surprising spark of iron will. \u201cWhy should I answer to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause.\u201d His entire vision was filled with her eyes, sparkling gray and meadow green intermixed. The combination was absolutely fascinating.</p><p>She stared back at him and said, low, \u201cAnd, anyway, why do you care where I\u2019ve been?\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d faced capture and torture and the imminent prospect of his own death for years on end, but for the life of him, he hadn\u2019t a clue how to reply to this small slip of a girl.</p><p>So it was perhaps just as well that the shot rang out at that moment.</p><p>Chapter Four</p><p>Longsword could find no reason this stranger might want a lock of his hair, even for a penny, but he could see no risk to himself, either. So thinking to humor the other man, he took his great sword, cut off a lock of hair, and gave it to the Goblin King.</p><p>The Goblin King smiled and held out the penny. But the moment Longsword grasped the coin, the ground opened in an enormous crack beneath him. The earth swallowed both Longsword and his sword, and he fell far, far below until he landed in the Goblin Kingdom. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>There he looked up and saw the Goblin King throw off his velvet cloak. Now were revealed his orange glowing eyes, lank green hair, and yellow fangs.</p><p>\u201cWho are you?\u201d Longsword cried.</p><p>\u201cI am the Goblin King,\u201d replied the other. \u201cWhen you accepted my coin for your lock of hair, you sold yourself into my power. For if I cannot have the sword alone, then I will have both you and the sword. . . .\u201d</p><p>\u2014from Longsword</p> <p>Surrounded. The enemy on both sides, shooting from hidden positions, his men screaming as they were picked off. He couldn\u2019t form a line of defense, couldn\u2019t rally his troops. They were all going to die if he\u2014</p><p>The second shot rang out. Reynaud found himself on the ground against a carriage, Miss Corning\u2019s sweet, warm body under him. Her gray eyes stared up into his, no longer green with anger but only terrified.</p><p>And the screams\u2014the screams were all around him.</p><p>\u201cDescendez!\u201d Reynaud roared to a soldier sitting in the carriage box looking stupidly around. \u201cForm a line of defense!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2014\u201d Miss Corning began.</p> <p>But he ignored her. A man had been hit and was writhing on the top steps of the town house, his blood staining the white stone. It was the young soldier, the one who\u2019d been walking with him. Dammit. It was his man.</p><p>And he was still exposed.</p><p>\u201cStay with Miss Corning,\u201d he ordered a nearby soldier.</p><p>The soldier in the box had finally dropped down and lay beside them as well. Where was the sergeant? Where were the other officers? They\u2019d all be killed here in the open, caught between the cross fire. Reynaud\u2019s temples throbbed with pain; his heart thundered. He had to save his men.</p><p>\u201cDo you understand?\u201d he yelled at the soldier near him.</p><p>The soldier blinked at him, dazed.</p> <p>Reynaud took the man by the shoulder and shook him. \u201cStay with Miss Corning. I\u2019m counting on you.\u201d</p><p>Something in the soldier\u2019s face cleared. His gaze locked on Reynaud\u2019s, just as they always did, and he nodded. \u201cYes, my lord.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood man.\u201d Reynaud eyed the soldier on the steps, judging the distance. It had been at least a minute since the last shot. Were the Indians still lurking in the woods? Or had they crept away again, silent as ghosts?</p><p>\u201cWhat are you going to do?\u201d Miss Corning asked.</p><p>Reynaud looked into her clear gray eyes. \u201cGet my man. Stay here. Take this.\u201d He pressed the hilt of his knife into her palm. \u201cDon\u2019t move until I tell you.\u201d</p><p>And he kissed her hard, feeling life\u2014his and hers\u2014coursing through his veins. Dear God, he had to get her away from here.</p><p>He got up before she could voice her protest and ran to the steps, keeping his upper body low. He paused by the moaning soldier only long enough to grab the man under the arms. The boy screamed as Reynaud pulled him to the front door, the sound high and animal, a cry of primeval agony. So many were in agony. So many were dead. And all so young.</p><p>The third bullet hit the door frame as Reynaud yanked his man through, splinters of wood exploding against his cheek.</p> <p>Reynaud was panting, but the boy was out of the line of fire at least. The bastard couldn\u2019t shoot him again, couldn\u2019t scalp him as he lay dying. Her brown eyes stared up through a mask of blood, dull and lifeless. Reynaud shook his head, wishing he could think through the blinding pain. Something... something wasn\u2019t right.</p><p>\u201cWhat is this?\u201d Reginald St. Aubyn, the earldom thief, cried, his face red. He started for the door.</p><p>Reynaud shot out his arm, barring the way. \u201cSnipers in the woods. Don\u2019t go out.\u201d</p><p>St. Aubyn jerked back his head, staring at him as if he were insane. \u201cWhat are you babbling about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t time for this,\u201d Reynaud growled. \u201cThere\u2019s a shooter, man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut... but, my niece is out there!\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s safe at the moment, sheltered by the carriage.\u201d</p><p>Reynaud assessed the crowd of soldiers gathered by the commotion in the entry hall. Except... except they didn\u2019t look like soldiers. Something was wrong. His head was splitting with pain, and he hadn\u2019t the time to figure it out now. His back crawled with the knowledge that the Indians were still out there, waiting. The lad moaned at his feet.</p><p>\u201cYou.\u201d He pointed at the oldest. \u201dAre there any guns in the house? Dueling pistols, birding pieces, hunting rifles?\u201d</p><p>The man blinked and came to attention. \u201cThere\u2019s a pair of dueling pistols in his lordship\u2019s study.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. Get them.\u201d</p><p>The man whirled and ran down the back passage.</p><p>\u201cYou two\u201d\u2014Reynaud indicated two practical-looking women\u2014\u201cfetch some clean cloth, linens, anything we can use for bandages.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir.\u201d They went without a word.</p><p>Reynaud turned to the boy but was stayed by a hand on his arm.</p><p>\u201cNow, see here,\u201d St. Aubyn said. \u201cI won\u2019t let my servants be ordered about by a raving lunatic. This is my house. You can\u2019t just\u2014\u201d</p><p>Reynaud spun and in the same motion took the older man by the throat and shoved him into the wall. He looked into watery brown eyes, suddenly widened, and leaned close.</p><p>\u201cMy house, my men,\u201d he breathed into the other man\u2019s face. \u201cHelp me or get out of my way, I care not, but never question my authority again\u2014and don\u2019t ever lay a hand on me.\u201d There was no question in his tone.</p><p>St. Aubyn swallowed and nodded his head.</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d Reynaud let him go and glanced at the sergeant. \u201cLook out the door\u2014quickly\u2014and check that Miss Corning and the others are still by the carriage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, my lord.\u201d</p><p>Reynaud knelt by the wounded man. The boy\u2019s face was greasy with sweat, his eyes narrowed in pain. The wound was on his left hip. Reynaud took off his coat and found the small thin knife he kept in a pocket. Then he bundled the coat and placed it beneath the boy\u2019s head.</p><p>\u201cAm I dying, my lord?\u201d the lad whispered.</p><p>\u201cNo, not at all.\u201d Reynaud sliced open the boy\u2019s breeches from waist to knee and spread the bloody fabric. \u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHenry, my lord.\u201d The lad swallowed. \u201cHenry Carter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like my men dying, Henry,\u201d Reynaud said. There was no exit wound. The bullet would need to be dug out of the boy\u2019s hip\u2014a tricky operation, as sometimes the hip bled badly. \u201cDo you understand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, my lord.\u201d The boy\u2019s eyebrows rose questioningly.</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re not to die,\u201d Reynaud stated with finality.</p><p>The boy nodded, his face smoothing. \u201cYes, my lord.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe pistols, sir.\u201d The older soldier was back, panting, with a flat box in his hands.</p><p>Reynaud rose. \u201cGood man.\u201d</p><p>The women had returned as well with the linens, and one immediately knelt and began bandaging Henry. \u201cI had Cook send for a doctor, my lord. I hope that was right.\u201d</p><p>Cook? That feeling that something wasn\u2019t right made his head spin again, but Reynaud kept his face calm. An officer never showed fear in battle.</p><p>\u201cVery smart.\u201d Reynaud nodded at the woman, and a flush of pleasure spread over her plain face. He turned to the sergeant. \u201cWhat\u2019s happening outside?\u201d</p><p>The sergeant straightened from the door crack. \u201cMiss Corning is still by the carriage, my lord, along with the coachman and two footmen. A small crowd has gathered across the street, but other than that, it seems just as usual.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. And your name?\u201d</p><p>The sergeant threw back his shoulders. \u201cHurley, my lord.\u201d</p><p>Reynaud nodded. He placed the dueling-pistols box on a side table and opened it. The pistols within looked like they might be from his grandfather\u2019s time, but they had been properly oiled and maintained. Reynaud took them out, checked to see if they were loaded, and stepped to the door.</p><p>\u201cKeep away from the doorway,\u201d he instructed the sergeant. \u201cThe Indians might still be out there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDear God, he\u2019s insane,\u201d St. Aubyn muttered.</p><p>Reynaud ignored him and ducked out the door.</p><p>The street was strangely quiet\u2014or perhaps it just seemed so after the chaos of the shooting. Reynaud didn\u2019t pause but ran swiftly down the steps and dropped to the ground by Miss Corning, who was nearly underneath the carriage.</p><p>\u201cAre you all right?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cYes. Quite.\u201d She frowned and touched a finger to his cheek. \u201cYou\u2019re bleeding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t matter.\u201d He took her hand and licked his blood from her fingertip, making her gray eyes widen. \u201cYou still have my knife?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d She showed him his knife, hidden among her skirts.</p><p>\u201cGood girl.\u201d He looked at the soldiers... except now they were a coachman and two footmen. Reynaud blinked fiercely. Concentrate. \u201cDid you see where the shots were coming from?\u201d</p><p>The coachman shook his head, but one of the footmen, a tall fellow with a missing front tooth, said, \u201cA black carriage pulled away very fast just after you dragged Henry into the house, my lord. I think the shots may\u2019ve come from inside the carriage.\u201d</p><p>Reynaud nodded. \u201cThat makes sense. But we\u2019ll take Miss Corning in with all precaution just in case. Mr. Coachman, please go first. I\u2019ll follow with Miss Corning while the footmen come behind.\u201d He handed one of the pistols to the footman who had spoken. \u201cDon\u2019t shoot, but make sure anyone watching can see that you\u2019re armed.\u201d</p><p>The men nodded, and Reynaud rose with his little company. He wrapped one arm about Miss Corning, covering as much of her body with his as he could. \u201cGo.\u201d</p><p>The coachman ran to the steps, and Reynaud followed with Miss Corning, damnably aware of how exposed they were. Her form was warm next to his, small and delicate. It seemed to take minutes, but they were within the house again in seconds. No more shots rang out, and Reynaud slammed the door behind him.</p><p>\u201cDear God.\u201d Miss Corning was looking at Henry, the wounded soldier.</p><p>But he wasn\u2019t a soldier, Reynaud realized all at once. Henry was the footman who\u2019d been guarding his bedroom door. His head spun as burning bile backed up into his throat. The sergeant was the butler, the women the maids, and there were no soldiers, only footmen staring at him warily. And the Indians? In London? Reynaud shook his head, feeling as if his brain would explode from the pain.</p><p>Dear God, maybe he was mad.</p><p>BEATRICE BENT OVER a small prayer book, picking apart the binding. She found it easier to think when her hands were busy. So after Henry had been seen to, after Lord Hope had retired to his room, after she\u2019d calmed the servants and sent them back to work, after all had been restored to order in her home, she\u2019d retreated here to her own rooms to contemplate the events of this afternoon.</p><p>Although, she\u2019d not come to any firm conclusions when a knock sounded at her door. She sighed and looked up at a second tap.</p><p>\u201cBeatrice?\u201d</p><p>It was Uncle Reggie\u2019s voice, which was odd, because he hardly ever visited her in her rooms, but then this had been a very odd day. She set the book down on the little table she worked at and rose from her chair to let him in.</p><p>\u201cI wanted to make sure that you were unharmed, m\u2019dear,\u201d he said once he\u2019d entered. He glanced vaguely around the room.</p><p>Beatrice felt a pang of remorse. In all the excitement of the shooting, she\u2019d not had a chance to talk to her uncle. \u201cI\u2019m quite all right\u2014not even a scratch. And you? How do you feel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, nothing can hurt an old man like me,\u201d he blustered. \u201c\u2019Course, that impostor did knock me against the wall a bit.\u201d He peered at her from under his bushy eyebrows as if waiting for a reaction.</p><p>Beatrice frowned. \u201cHe did? But why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBloody arrogance, if you ask me,\u201d her uncle replied heatedly. \u201cHe was raving about Indians in the woods. Started ordering the servants about and told me to get out of the way. I think the man is mad.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHe did save me.\u201d Beatrice looked down at her slippers. Lord Hope\u2019s sanity was the very subject she\u2019d been grappling with when Uncle Reggie had interrupted her. \u201cPerhaps he was merely confused by the suddenness of the events. Perhaps he spoke in haste when he talked of Indians.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr perhaps he\u2019s mad.\u201d Uncle Reggie\u2019s voice softened at her look. \u201cI know he saved your life, and don\u2019t think I\u2019m not grateful the bastard risked his life for you. But is it safe to have him in the house? What if he wakes one morning and decides I\u2019m an Indian\u2014or you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe seems sane otherwise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes he, Bea?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes. Mostly anyway.\u201d Beatrice sat in the chair before her worktable and bit her lip. \u201cI don\u2019t think he\u2019d ever hurt me or you, Uncle, truly, no matter his state of mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHumph. I don\u2019t know if I share your optimism.\u201d Uncle Reggie wandered over and peered at her work. \u201cAh, you\u2019ve started a new project. What is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAunt Mary\u2019s old prayer book.\u201d</p><p>He gently touched a finger to the disassembled book. \u201cI well remember how she used to carry it to church in the country. It belonged to her great-great-grandmother, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI remember her telling me,\u201d Beatrice said softly. \u201cThe cover was quite worn through, the spine had cracked, and the pages were coming loose from the stitching. I thought to restitch it and then rebind it in a blue calfskin. It\u2019ll be good as new.\u201d</p> <p>He nodded. \u201cShe would\u2019ve liked that. It\u2019s good of you to take such care of her things.\u201d</p><p>Beatrice looked at her hands, remembering Aunt Mary\u2019s kind blue eyes, the softness of her cheeks, and the way she used to laugh full-throatedly. Their household had never been the same without her. Since Aunt Mary\u2019s death, Uncle Reggie had become a less-humorous man, more prone to quick judgments, less able to understand or sympathize with other people\u2019s intentions.</p><p>\u201cI enjoy it,\u201d she said. \u201cI only wish she were here to see the result.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs do I, m\u2019dear, as do I.\u201d He patted the pages once more and then moved away from her table. \u201cI think I must send him away, Bea, for your safety.\u201d</p><p>She sighed, knowing they\u2019d returned to the subject of Lord Hope. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t present any danger to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBea,\u201d Uncle Reggie said gently, \u201cI know you like to put things to rights, but some things can\u2019t be fixed, and I\u2019m afraid a man this wild is one of them.\u201d</p> <p>Beatrice set her lips stubbornly. \u201cI think we must consider how it\u2019ll appear if we toss him out of Blanchard House and he regains the title. He won\u2019t look favorably on us.\u201d</p><p>Uncle Reggie stiffened. \u201cHe won\u2019t get the title\u2014I won\u2019t let him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut, Uncle\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m firm on this, Bea,\u201d he said with the sternness he rarely showed her. \u201cI\u2019ll not let that madman take our home from us. I vowed to your aunt Mary that I\u2019d provide for you properly, and I intend to do so. I\u2019ll agree to let him stay here, but only so I can keep an eye on him and gather proof that he\u2019s not fit for the title.\u201d</p><p>And with that, he closed the door to her room firmly.</p><p>Beatrice looked down at Aunt Mary\u2019s prayer book. If she didn\u2019t do something, there soon would be bloodshed in her house. Uncle Reggie was adamant, but perhaps she could make Lord Hope see that her uncle was only a stubborn old man.</p><p>\u201cUNCLE REGGIE COULDN\u2019T possibly have sent someone to kill you,\u201d Miss Corning said for the third or possibly fourth time. \u201cI\u2019m telling you that you don\u2019t know him. He\u2019s really the sweetest thing imaginable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe to you,\u201d Reynaud replied as he sharpened his long knife, \u201cbut you\u2019re not the one displacing him from a title\u2014and monies\u2014he thought were his.\u201d</p> <p>He examined her from under his eyebrows. Did she think him a madman? Was she afraid to be in his company? What had she thought of his actions just hours before?</p><p>But despite his watchfulness, all he saw was irritation on Miss Corning\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not listening to me.\u201d She paced from the window of his bedroom to where he sat on the edge of the bed and stood before him, arms akimbo like a cook scolding the butcher\u2019s boy. \u201cEven if Uncle Reggie wanted to kill you\u2014which, as I keep telling you, he never would\u2014he\u2019d not be stupid enough to stage an assassination in front of his own house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy house,\u201d Reynaud growled. She\u2019d been haranguing him for the last half hour and showed no signs of stopping.</p><p>\u201cYou,\u201d Miss Corning stated through gritted teeth, \u201care impossible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I am correct,\u201d he answered. \u201cAnd you simply don\u2019t want to acknowledge the fact that your uncle may not be nearly as sweet as you think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014\u201d she began again, her tone indicating she might very well continue the argument until doomsday.</p><p>But Reynaud had had enough. He threw aside the knife and whetstone and rose from the bed, nearly in her face. \u201cBesides, if you really did consider me impossible, you would never have kissed me.\u201d</p><p>She skittered back, and he felt a spear of rage shoot through him. She should not fear him. It wasn\u2019t right.</p><p>Then her lush mouth parted in what looked like outrage. For a moment she couldn\u2019t speak, and then she burst out, \u201cIt was you who kissed me!\u201d</p><p>He took a step toward her. She took a step back. He stalked her silently across the room, waiting for fear to turn her eyes dark. Hadn\u2019t she realized what he\u2019d shouted, out there by the carriage?</p><p>Didn\u2019t she know he was mad?</p><p>He bent over her, leaning down until the wisps of hair near her ear brushed his lips, inhaling the scent of sweet English flowers. \u201cYou returned the kiss; don\u2019t think I didn\u2019t notice.\u201d</p><p>And he had. Her soft lips had opened beneath his for just a fraction of a second before he\u2019d turned and run toward the wounded footman. That kiss would be burned in his memory forever. He angled his head and looked into her eyes.</p><p>Instead of going dark with fear, they were snapping with green sparks. \u201cI thought you were about to die!\u201d</p><p>Foolish girl.</p><p>\u201cTell yourself that if it assuages your delicate sensibilities,\u201d he murmured, \u201cbut the fact remains that you. Kissed. Me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat an arrogant thing to say,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cGranted.\u201d He inhaled. Her skin smelled clean and womanly, with that hint of a flowery soap that Indian women never had. It was a nostalgic scent for him, conjuring the memory of other civilized women he\u2019d once known\u2014his mother, his sister, forgotten young girls he\u2019d squired to balls long ago. She smelled of England itself, and for some reason he found the thought unbearably arousing and at the same time utterly frightening. She had no defenses against him.</p><p>He no longer belonged in her world. \u201cBut did you enjoy the kiss?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd if I did?\u201d she whispered.</p><p>He brushed his lips\u2014softly, delicately\u2014against her jaw. \u201cThen I pity you. You should run screaming from me. Can\u2019t you see the monster I am?\u201d</p><p>She looked up at him with brave clear gray eyes. \u201cYou\u2019re not a monster.\u201d</p><p>He closed his eyes, not wanting to see her face, not wanting to take advantage of that purity. \u201cYou don\u2019t know me. You don\u2019t know what I\u2019ve done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen tell me,\u201d she said urgently. \u201cWhat happened in the Colonies? Where have you been for seven years?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Brown eyes stared up through a mask of blood. He was too late. He pushed away from her, afraid she\u2019d see the demons laughing behind his eyes.</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d she called. \u201cWhy can\u2019t you tell me? I can never understand you until I\u2019ve heard what happened to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous,\u201d he snapped. \u201cThere\u2019s no need for you to understand me.\u201d</p><p>She threw her hands in the air. \u201cYou\u2019re impossible!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd we are back where we started.\u201d He sighed.</p><p>She frowned at him, her gray eyes sparking with displeasure as she tapped one small foot. \u201cVery well,\u201d she said at last, \u201cI\u2019ll lay aside the matter of your past for now, but you can\u2019t ignore the fact that someone tried to kill you today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not.\u201d He turned and gathered the knife, whetstone, and the piece of leather he\u2019d been using to sharpen the knife. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s any of your concern.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow can it not be my concern?\u201d she demanded. \u201cI was there. I saw that third shot. The first two might have been random, but the third was most definitely aimed at you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd again, I say that this is none of your business.\u201d</p><p>He stowed the whetstone and leather in the top of a chest of drawers, but he hung the knife at his waist. He\u2019d had it for seven long years, used it to butcher deer and bear, and once, years ago now, he\u2019d killed a man with it. The knife wasn\u2019t a friend\u2014he had no emotional attachment to it\u2014but it had served him well, and he felt safer, more whole, with it at his side.</p><p>He looked curiously at Miss Corning, still standing by the bed across the room. \u201cWhy do you persist?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I care,\u201d she said, \u201cno matter how much you try to hold me at arm\u2019s length, I still can\u2019t help but care. And because I am the only one who might get you to understand that Uncle Reggie had nothing to do with the shooting. Think: If it wasn\u2019t Uncle Reggie, then someone else has tried to kill you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd who do you think that might be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d She hugged her waist and shivered. \u201cDo you?\u201d</p><p>He frowned down at the top of the chest of drawers. It held only a basin and a pitcher of water\u2014nothing like the furniture that\u2019d been in his old rooms in this house. But then again it was richly appointed compared to the wigwams he\u2019d lived in for many years. For a brief moment, he felt dizzy with displacement. Did he belong anywhere anymore? The demons surged forward to take control.</p><p>Then he shook his head, shoving them back. \u201cVale said he\u2019d been looking for the traitor for a year now. He\u2019s obsessed with the search. And he said the traitor had a French mother. My mother was French.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould Lord Vale have you killed if he thought you the traitor?\u201d</p><p>Reynaud remembered the man he\u2019d known, a laughing man, a friend to everyone he met. That Vale would never have done such a thing, but then again, that Vale was from the past. Would Vale kill him if he thought he\u2019d betrayed the regiment at Spinner\u2019s Falls? A man might change in many ways in seven years, but could Vale turn into a killer of friends?</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He answered his own silent question. \u201cNo, Jasper would never do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen who would?\u201d she asked quietly. \u201cIf another of the survivors of the massacre thought you were the traitor, would they kill you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d He frowned, thinking, and then shook his head in frustration. \u201cI don\u2019t even know who survived the massacre besides Vale and a man called Samuel Hartley.\u201d Dammit! He wished he could call on Vale for help, but after yesterday afternoon, it seemed impossible. \u201cI don\u2019t know who to trust.\u201d</p><p>He looked at her, the full realization dawning on him. \u201cI\u2019m not sure there is anyone I can trust.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTHEY SAY THE bullet came within inches of his face,\u201d the Duke of Lister drawled, cradling a goblet of wine between his large pale hands.</p><p>\u201cAt least that close.\u201d Blanchard frowned. \u201cThere was blood on his cheek. Although I think that was from a splinter striking him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPity it wasn\u2019t closer,\u201d Hasselthorpe said as he swirled the wine in his glass. The burgundy liquid was so dark it was nearly black. Like a glass of blood. He set it down on the table beside his chair in sudden distaste. \u201cHad the bullet smashed his skull, you, Lord Blanchard, would have no fear for your title.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Blanchard, predictably, choked on his wine.</p><p>Hasselthorpe watched him, a faint smile playing around his mouth. They sat at his dining table, the ladies having retired to the sitting room for their tea. Soon they\u2019d have to join them, and he\u2019d have to put up with Adriana and her incredibly foolish conversation. His wife of twenty-some years had been regarded as a great beauty when she\u2019d come out, and the years had done very little to dim her lovely form. Unfortunately, they\u2019d done nothing to brighten her mind, either. Adriana was the one emotional decision he\u2019d made in a life of calculated gamesmanship, and he\u2019d been paying for it ever since.</p><p>\u201cHe was brave enough,\u201d Blanchard muttered grudgingly. \u201cGot my niece off the street at the risk of his own life. But the feller thought he was fighting Indians.\u201d</p><p>Lister stirred. \u201cIndians? What, the savages in the Colonies?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s what he was raving about,\u201d Blanchard said. He looked from Hasselthorpe to Lister, his eyes calculating. \u201cI think he\u2019s mad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMad,\u201d Hasselthorpe murmured. \u201cAnd if he\u2019s mad, he certainly can\u2019t gain the title. Is that what you plan?\u201d</p><p>Blanchard jerked a single nod.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not bad,\u201d Hasselthorpe said. \u201cAnd it saves you from having to kill the man, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you insinuating that I was behind the attempt on Lord Hope\u2019s life?\u201d Blanchard sputtered.</p> <p>\u201cNot at all,\u201d Hasselthorpe said smoothly. He was aware that Lister watched them under hooded eyes. \u201cJust pointing out a fact. One that every intelligent man in London will be thinking\u2014no doubt including Lord Hope himself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn your eyes,\u201d Blanchard whispered. His face had gone white.</p><p>Lister laughed. \u201cDon\u2019t worry yourself over it, my lord. After all, the gunman missed. Thus, it hardly matters who tried to kill the lost Lord Hope.\u201d</p><p>Hasselthorpe raised his glass to his lips, murmuring softly, \u201cNot unless they try again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI DON\u2019T UNDERSTAND gentlemen,\u201d Beatrice announced a day later as she and Lottie strolled about the vast warehouse showroom of Godfrey and Sons furniture makers. She squinted in disapproval at several gentlemen across the room who seemed to be vying for the attentions of a pretty redheaded girl by demonstrating who could lift a heavy-looking stuffed chair above their head the highest. \u201cI cannot understand why Lord Hope kissed me yesterday and then accused me of kissing him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGentlemen are an enigma,\u201d Lottie replied gravely.</p> <p>\u201cThey are.\u201d Beatrice hesitated, then said quietly, \u201cHe seemed... confused during the shooting incident.\u201d</p><p>Lottie glanced at her. \u201cConfused?\u201d</p><p>Beatrice grimaced. \u201cHe was talking about Indians and forming a line of defense.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood Lord.\u201d Lottie looked troubled. \u201cDid he know where he was?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Beatrice frowned, remembering those minutes huddled next to the carriage. Her heart had stopped when she\u2019d realized that Lord Hope was about to run into the open to go to Henry the footman. \u201cI... I don\u2019t think so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut that\u2019s madness,\u201d Lottie whispered in horror.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Beatrice murmured. \u201cAnd I\u2019m afraid that Uncle Reggie will use it against Lord Hope to keep the title.\u201d</p><p>Lottie looked at her. \u201cBut if he is mad... Bea, dear, surely it\u2019s better that he not inherit the title?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe matter is more complicated than that.\u201d Beatrice closed her eyes for a moment. \u201cLord Hope seems perfectly fine\u2014if hostile\u2014most of the time. Should a man be deprived of his title because of one moment of confusion?\u201d</p><p>Lottie cocked her head, looking skeptical.</p><p>Beatrice hurried on. \u201cAnd there\u2019s more to consider. If Lord Hope attains the title, he might take his vote in parliament and cast it for Mr. Wheaton\u2019s bill.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m as much in favor of Mr. Wheaton\u2019s bill as you,\u201d Lottie said, \u201cbut I don\u2019t know if I want it passed at your expense.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf it was just me, I don\u2019t think I\u2019d mind,\u201d Beatrice said. \u201cI know it would be hard to live in reduced circumstances in the country after being in London all these years, but I think it wouldn\u2019t be so bad. It\u2019s Uncle Reggie I worry about. I\u2019m truly afraid that losing the earldom might kill him.\u201d She pressed her hand to her chest to ease the ache there.</p><p>\u201cThere is no way for everyone to win, is there?\u201d Lottie said somberly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid not,\u201d Beatrice replied. They strolled in silence for a moment before she said, \u201cThe whole thing was terrible, Lottie. Poor Henry was quite soaked in his own blood, Uncle Reggie was shouting, the servants were in an uproar, and Lord Hope was striding about with a dueling pistol, looking like he wanted to kill someone. Then, two hours later, he says I kissed him when clearly he kissed me. And until that point, I didn\u2019t even think he liked me.\u201d</p><p>Lottie cleared her throat delicately. \u201cWell, to be absolutely correct, he doesn\u2019t have to like you to want to kiss you.\u201d</p><p>Beatrice looked at her, appalled.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, but there it is.\u201d Lottie shrugged and then said entirely too innocently, \u201cOf course, generally speaking, the lady does like the gentleman when they kiss.\u201d</p><p>Beatrice pressed her lips together, though she knew her face was warming.</p><p>Lottie cleared her throat. \u201cDo you? Like Lord Hope, that is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow could I like him?\u201d Beatrice asked. \u201cHe\u2019s surly and sarcastic and quite possibly mad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd yet you kissed him,\u201d Lottie reminded her.</p><p>\u201cHe kissed me,\u201d Beatrice said automatically. \u201cIt\u2019s just that he has such an intense way of looking at one, as if I\u2019m the only other human in the world. He\u2019s so full of passion.\u201d</p><p>Lottie raised her eyebrows.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m explaining it badly,\u201d Beatrice said. She thought a moment. \u201cIt\u2019s as if the only music one had ever heard was a penny whistle. One would probably think it was quite all right, that music was a rather nice thing but nothing very special. But what if one then attended one of Mr. Handel\u2019s symphonies? Do you see? It would be overwhelming, beautiful and strange and complex, and so utterly compelling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I understand,\u201d Lottie murmured. Her brows knit.</p><p>Across the room, one of the gentlemen misjudged the chair\u2019s weight and dropped it. The chair smashed to the ground, the other gentlemen doubled over in laughter, and the young lady\u2019s chaperone escorted her from the showroom, scolding her all the way. The proprietor hurried over to the scene of his wrecked merchandise.</p><p>Beatrice shook her head. \u201cI\u2019ll never understand men.\u201d</p><p>\u201cListen, dear,\u201d Lottie said. \u201cDo you know what my husband did this morning?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Beatrice shook her head. \u201cBut I don\u2019t really\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll tell you,\u201d Lottie said without regard for her friend\u2019s answer. \u201cHe came down to breakfast, ate three eggs, half a gammon steak, four pieces of toast, and a pot of tea.\u201d</p><p>Beatrice blinked. \u201cThat seems like quite a lot of food.\u201d</p><p>Lottie waved her hand irritably. \u201cHis usual breakfast.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Beatrice frowned. \u201cThen why\u2014?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe said not a word to me the entire time! Instead, he busied himself reading his correspondence and muttering over the scandal sheets. And mark this\u2014he left the room without bidding me good-bye. And when he came back in a minute later, do you know what he did?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t a clue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe walked to the sideboard, picked up another piece of toast, and strode right by me again without speaking!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d Beatrice winced. \u201cPerhaps he had important business on his mind.\u201d</p><p>Lottie arched one eyebrow. \u201cOr perhaps he\u2019s simply a fool.\u201d</p><p>Beatrice wasn\u2019t certain what to say to that, so for a moment she was silent. Both ladies perambulated slowly through the crowded room and stopped with silent consensus before a side table entirely covered in gilded putti.</p><p>\u201cThat,\u201d Lottie said with consideration, \u201cis the ugliest thing I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2019Tis, isn\u2019t it? It\u2019s almost as if the maker had a morbid dislike of side tables.\u201d Beatrice tilted her head, examining the table. \u201cI went to visit Jeremy yesterday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow is he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot well.\u201d She felt Lottie\u2019s swift glance. \u201cIt\u2019s very important that we pass Mr. Wheaton\u2019s bill. The soldiers who would benefit from this bill are many\u2014perhaps thousands of men, and some of those men served under Jeremy. He cares so passionately about the bill. I know that it would do him immeasurable good if the veterans got a better pension.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure it would, dear. I\u2019m sure it would,\u201d Lottie said gently.</p><p>\u201cHe simply . . .\u201d Beatrice had to pause a moment and swallow before she could continue; then she said more steadily, \u201cHe simply needs a reason to... to live, Lottie. I worry for him, I do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course you do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMr. and Mrs. Oates leave him in that room by himself for far too long at a time.\u201d Beatrice shook her head. The Oateses\u2019 reaction to their son\u2019s horrific injuries when he returned home had long been a source of concern for her. \u201cThey\u2019ve given up on him, I think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, dear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey looked at him when he returned,\u201d Beatrice whispered, \u201cand it was as if he were already dead. As if he meant nothing to them unless he was entirely whole and well. They\u2019ve now turned to Jeremy\u2019s brother, Alfred, and treat him as if he is the heir instead of Jeremy.\u201d</p><p>Beatrice looked at her friend, and this time she couldn\u2019t keep the tears from swimming in her eyes. \u201cAnd that horrible Frances Cunningham! I still get angry when I think how she threw him over when he returned. It\u2019s so shameful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPity, isn\u2019t it, that no one condemned her for her heartlessness,\u201d Lottie said thoughtfully. \u201cBut then he had lost his legs and wasn\u2019t expected to live.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe could\u2019ve at least waited until he was out of the sickroom,\u201d Beatrice muttered darkly. \u201cAnd she\u2019s married now. Did you know? To a baronet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA fat, old baronet,\u201d Lottie said with satisfaction. \u201cOr so I\u2019ve heard. Perhaps she got her just deserts after all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHumph.\u201d Beatrice stared a moment at the putti. The one on the corner of the table nearest her looked remarkably like a fat old man with digestive troubles. Perhaps Frances Cunningham had gotten what she\u2019d deserved. \u201cBut you understand, don\u2019t you, how important it is that this bill is passed now\u2014not a year or two hence?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I do.\u201d Lottie linked her arm with Beatrice\u2019s, and they began to stroll again. \u201cYou are so good. Much better than me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want this bill passed as well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut my interest is theoretical.\u201d A faint smile curved Lottie\u2019s wide mouth. \u201cI think it only just that men who have served for years in sometimes deplorable conditions have a fair compensation. You, dear Beatrice, believe with a passion. You feel for those wretched creatures, almost as much as you feel for Jeremy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps,\u201d Beatrice said. \u201cBut in the end, it\u2019s Jeremy that I feel the most for.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly. Which is why I am so concerned.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever about?\u201d</p><p>Lottie halted and took her hands. \u201cI don\u2019t want you to be disappointed . . .\u201d</p><p>Beatrice turned her face to the side, but even so, she could not escape the end of Lottie\u2019s sentence.</p><p>\u201c. . . if the bill is not passed in time.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Chapter Five</p><p>Well, Longsword did not like this turn of events one wit, but a bargain once struck with the Goblin King is very hard to break. Thus he was compelled to work for the Goblin King, and that is a dirty job, indeed; I can tell you! He never saw the sun, he never heard laughter, and he never felt a cool breeze against his cheek, for the Goblin Kingdom, as you may have heard, is a horrible place. But the worst part for Longsword was the knowledge that the master he served and the things he did were an affront to God and Heaven itself.</p><p>Because of this, every year Longsword would go to his master, lower himself to one knee, and beg to be relieved of his horrible servitude.</p><p>And every year the Goblin King refused to let Longsword go....</p> <p>\u2014from Longsword</p><p>\u201cRidiculous that I can\u2019t touch any of the Blanchard monies,\u201d Reynaud growled a day later. He paced the little sitting room from fireplace to window, feeling like a wild wolf caged. \u201cHow am I to pay my lawyers without funds?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can hardly blame Uncle Reggie for being reluctant to pay for his own ouster,\u201d Miss Corning said. She sat serenely by the small fire, sipping some of her infernal tea.</p><p>\u201cHa! If he thinks that\u2019ll stop me, he\u2019ll be sorely disappointed,\u201d Reynaud retorted. \u201cI have a petition before parliament to form a special committee to look into my case.\u201d</p><p>Miss Corning set her teacup down carefully. \u201cAlready? I had no idea.\u201d</p> <p>Reynaud snorted. \u201cIf it were tomorrow, it\u2019d not be soon enough for me. Once I prove my identity, they cannot keep the title from me.\u201d</p><p>Miss Corning frowned, fiddling with her teacup.</p><p>Reynaud\u2019s brows snapped together. \u201cYou don\u2019t believe me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just... What if . . .\u201d She shook her head slowly.</p><p>\u201cWhat if what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if he says that you are mad?\u201d she asked all in a rush, and looked up at him.</p> <p>Reynaud stared. Insanity was one of the few reasons a man might be passed over for a title. \u201cDo you have information that he will?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was just something he said in passing.\u201d She ducked her head, hiding her gray eyes from him.</p><p>Reynaud scowled, wondering what her uncle had actually said. He felt cold sweat start at the small of his back. You\u2019ll never be a proper Englishman again, the goblins in his mind chittered. You\u2019ll never belong. Reynaud balled his hands, fighting the voices.</p><p>\u201cDo you feel well?\u201d Miss Corning asked.</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d Reynaud snapped. \u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>Her gray eyes looked troubled. \u201cPerhaps if I talk to Uncle Reggie, he\u2019d be willing to lend you some of his money for new clothes and such.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy money,\u201d Reynaud growled.</p><p>She was throwing him a bone, and they both knew it. Damn her uncle to hell. He parted the curtain to peer out. Three stories below, a carriage lurked in front of the town house. Probably one of St. Aubyn\u2019s political allies come to call.</p> <p>\u201cYes, well, your money or Uncle Reggie\u2019s money, the fact remains that he is the one in control of it,\u201d Miss Corning observed. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t hurt your case to be more civil to him, especially since you\u2019re staying in his house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy house. I have every right to live in my house, and I\u2019ll be damned before I crawl to that man.\u201d Reynaud let the curtain drop.</p><p>Miss Corning rolled her eyes. \u201cI didn\u2019t say crawl, I said be more\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cCivil, I know.\u201d He stalked toward her. She was looking remarkably pretty this morning in a green frock that offset the pale rose of her cheeks and made her eyes sparkle like diamonds. \u201cThe only one I\u2019m interested in being \u2018civil\u2019 to is you.\u201d</p><p>She paused, her tea dish halfway to her lips, and eyed him warily. Good. She took him far too much for granted as it was. They were in a room alone, for God\u2019s sake, and he\u2019d spent the last seven years in a society where the relations between a man and a woman were much more fundamental. In fact\u2014</p><p>But his thoughts were interrupted by a footman appearing at the door. \u201cYou have a visitor, my lord.\u201d</p><p>And the man stepped aside to reveal a vision. An elderly lady stood there, her back ramrod straight, her snowy white hair pulled into a severe knot at the crown of her head, her piercing blue eyes already narrowed in disapproval. Reynaud hadn\u2019t seen her in seven years, and for a moment he feared he would lose his self-possession. He knew tears\u2014awful unmanly tears\u2014were near the surface.</p><p>Then she spoke. \u201cTiens! Such an \u2019orrible growth of \u2019air upon your face, nephew! I am quite repulsed. Is this, then, what gentlemen in the Colonies wear? I do not believe it; no, I do not!\u201d</p><p>He went to her and took her hands, kissing her tenderly on the cheek despite her mutter of disgust. \u201cI am glad to see you, Tante Cristelle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTcha! I do not think you can see at all with this \u2019air.\u201d She reached a blue-veined hand to brush the hair falling into his face. Her touch, unlike her words, was gentle. Then her hand dropped. \u201cAnd who is this child here? Have you lost so much of civilization that you closet yourself alone with a female in a respectable house?\u201d</p><p>Reynaud turned, amused, to see that Miss Corning had jumped up from her chair and was eyeing Tante Cristelle warily. \u201cThis is a cousin of mine, Miss Beatrice Corning. Miss Corning, my aunt, Miss Cristelle Molyneux.\u201d</p><p>Miss Corning curtsied as Tante Cristelle employed her looking glass and said, \u201cI do not remember a cousin called Corning in my sister\u2019s family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Lord Blanchard\u2019s niece,\u201d Miss Corning said.</p><p>Tante Cristelle\u2019s eyes darkened. \u201cC\u2019est ridicule! My nephew doesn\u2019t have a niece, only a nephew, and he not yet ten years of age.\u201d</p><p>Reynaud cleared his throat, feeling like laughing for the first time since he\u2019d set foot on English soil. \u201cShe means the present Earl of Blanchard, Tante.\u201d</p><p>The old lady sniffed. \u201cThe pretender to the title. I see.\u201d</p><p>Miss Corning looked cautious. \u201cUm... perhaps I can bring up some tea?\u201d</p><p>Reynaud would\u2019ve preferred coffee or brandy, but since Miss Corning seemed to be fixated on tea, he merely nodded. She glided from the room, and he watched her go.</p><p>\u201cThat one is very pretty,\u201d Tante Cristelle observed. \u201cNot beautiful, but she \u2019as an air of grace about her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIndeed.\u201d Reynaud looked at his aunt. \u201cYou mentioned my sister. Is she well?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know?\u201d Her brows snapped together in disapproval. \u201cDid you not ask?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have asked,\u201d Reynaud replied as he ushered her to a chair. \u201cBut no one knows her as well as you do, Tante.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHumph,\u201d said Tante Cristelle as she primly lowered herself to a chair. \u201cThen I will tell you. You know your sister was widowed shortly after your... disappearance.\u201d</p><p>Reynaud nodded. \u201cSo Miss Corning has told me.\u201d He\u2019d gone to look out the window again. London hadn\u2019t changed much since his absence, but everything else had.</p><p>Everything.</p><p>\u201cBon,\u201d Tante Cristelle said. \u201cThen last year she married a rustic, a man from the Colony of New England. His name is Samuel Hartley.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat I\u2019d heard as well,\u201d he replied.</p><p>Strange to think that Emeline was now married to a man Reynaud had known in the army\u2014a Colonial. Once again he felt that nauseating sense that his world was in motion, past and present conflicting, warring for his soul.</p><p>Tante Cristelle continued. \u201cShe \u2019as taken herself to live with her husband far, far overseas in the city of Boston. I do not know if such an action was wise on her part, but you know your sister. She can be quite the stubborn mule when she wishes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd my nephew, Daniel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPetite Daniel is fine and strong. Naturally his mother took him to live with her in America.\u201d</p><p>Reynaud contemplated that. Ironic that he was now farther from his sister than he\u2019d been before he\u2019d sailed for England. Would he have delayed his return had he known she was in New England? He wasn\u2019t sure. The need to regain his former life\u2014his lands and title\u2014had driven him for seven long years. Had in fact kept him alive and sane during the endless days and nights of his captivity. Nothing, not even the love for a sister, could keep him from his goal.</p><p>\u201cWhere have you been, Reynaud?\u201d Tante Cristelle asked softly.</p><p>He shook his head, closing his eyes. How could he tell her, this gently bred aristocrat, what had been done to him?</p><p>After a moment he heard her sigh. \u201cBien. There is no need to speak of it if you do not wish.\u201d</p><p>At that, he turned around. Tante Cristelle was watching him patiently. She was the elder sister of his late mother. Both women had grown up in Paris and had immigrated to England on his mother\u2019s marriage. Tante Cristelle was in her seventh decade, but her snapping blue eyes were sharp, her mind one of the clearest he\u2019d ever known.</p><p>\u201cI intend to get my title back, Tante,\u201d he said.</p><p>She nodded once. \u201cNaturalement.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have petitioned parliament to form a special committee to hear my case. When it is convened, I will have to appear before the committee in Westminster and plead my case. The current earl will present his side at the same time.\u201d</p><p>Tante sniffed. \u201cThis usurper will not let go of his stolen title so easily, eh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Reynaud said grimly. \u201cHe\u2019ll hold it for as long as he can, I\u2019m sure. And he may ask to retain the title on the grounds that I\u2019m mad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMad?\u201d The old lady\u2019s thin eyebrows rose.</p><p>Reynaud looked away. \u201cI was delirious with fever when I arrived. I\u2019m afraid there was a roomful of people to witness me raving like a lunatic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd is that all?\u201d</p><p>Reynaud grimaced uncomfortably. \u201cThere was an... incident yesterday. I was shot at\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMon dieu!\u201d</p><p>He waved away her concern. \u201cIt was nothing terrible. But I forgot myself somehow. I thought I was on the battlefield again.\u201d</p><p>Silence.</p><p>Then Tante Cristelle drew breath. \u201cAh. Unfortunate. We will need good solicitors and men of business to combat the usurper.\u201d</p><p>Reynaud looked up, hope making him feel suddenly weak. \u201cThen you\u2019ll help me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMais oui.\u201d Tante Cristelle scowled. \u201cAnd did you think otherwise?\u201d</p><p>Reynaud helped her stand, feeling the fragile bones of her arm beneath his hand. \u201cNo, but it has been a very long time since I\u2019ve had an ally.\u201d</p><p>She shook her skirts into order. \u201cWe must plan a campaign, I think. I shall seek out these men of law, for I have maintained the estate of le petite Daniel whilst he sojourned in the Colonies and thus have many contacts. And you, you shall shave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShave?\u201d Reynaud\u2019s eyebrows shot up in amusement.</p><p>Tante Cristelle nodded sharply. \u201cBut of course, shave, and also you will need the new clothing, the proper wig, and the elegant shoes. For you must regain the aspect of the so-boring English milord, must you not? Thusly we shall confound our enemies with your very placidity.\u201d</p><p>Reynaud clenched his jaw. He hated to ask, but he forced himself to. \u201cI have no monies, Tante.\u201d</p><p>She nodded, unsurprised. \u201cI will lend you what you need, and when you become the earl again, you shall pay me back, yes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Of course.\u201d Reynaud bowed over her hand. \u201cI cannot tell you, Tante, how relieved I am that you are on my side.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTcha!\u201d The old woman made a dismissive sound. \u201cYou have not lost your charm, I see, underneath that forest upon your face. But mark you this, nephew: a shave and a haircut are only part of what you\u2019ll need to transform yourself into the respectable English gentleman.\u201d</p><p>Reynaud frowned. \u201cWhat else do you think I need? Name it and I\u2019ll buy it.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAh, but this is a thing not to be bought. For this you will need all your charm.\u201d She turned at the door and looked him in the eye, her gaze level and solemn. \u201cA wife is what you need. An English wife of good family. For what man can be mad with a sweet, not-too-pretty wife by his side? Obtain a chit such as this and you will be halfway to regaining your title.\u201d</p><p>THE NEXT MORNING dawned bright and sunny. After making her toilet, Beatrice decided to consult with Cook. She was descending the stairs to the front hall when she heard male voices.</p><p>Beatrice halted at the landing and looked over the rail to the hall below. There stood the butler, two footmen, and a gentleman she did not know but who looked\u2014at least from the back\u2014somehow familiar. She continued down the stairs slowly, eyeing the man. He wore a freshly powdered white wig and a black coat of a very fine cut, embroidered about the cuffs in silver and green thread. The butler was saying something to him, but the stranger must\u2019ve sensed her stare. He turned.</p><p>And she froze on the stairs.</p> <p>It was Lord Hope\u2014but a Lord Hope transformed. Gone was the thick beard. His jaw was freshly shaven, revealing his square chin and the hard planes of his cheeks. He must\u2019ve cut his hair very close to his head, for the wig he wore was beautifully curled and powdered and fit him excellently. Beneath the black velvet of his coat, his waistcoat was silver and green brocade, and lace fell at his wrists. He was the very epitome of a fine London gentleman, and Beatrice might have felt a pang of regret for the man she\u2019d nursed for the last week had it not been for two things. First, from his left ear, the black iron cross still dangled, primitive and uncivilized next to the perfection of his white wig. And second, the three tattooed birds still circled his right eye, as permanent as the ebony color of the eye itself.</p><p>He wore the trappings of civilization, but no one but a fool would mistake them for anything but a thin veneer covering the savage beneath.</p><p>He bowed to her, one leg extended, his arm sweeping down sardonically. \u201cMiss Corning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLord Hope.\u201d She\u2019d regained some of her self-possession and now finished her descent of the stairs. \u201cYou\u2019ve undergone a most remarkable change.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cTo fight demons, one must assume the guise of a demon.\u201d</p> <p>She looked at him. \u201cI\u2019m not sure I understand what that means.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo matter.\u201d He glanced away, and with any other man, she might\u2019ve thought him uncertain. \u201cI go to visit my aunt this morn. Would you care to accompany me?\u201d</p><p>It was a civilized invitation, and she rather wanted to know what he was about with this sudden transformation, but she bit her lip. Was it safe?</p><p>Her hesitation had lasted a fraction of a second too long. His pleasant expression turned to a scowl. \u201cAre you afraid of me, Miss Corning?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot at all.\u201d She tilted her chin, daring him to call her on the fib.</p><p>\u201cThen you won\u2019t mind a simple drive in the city.\u201d</p> <p>Why did he want her to accompany him? She stared at him, trying to decipher his motivations.</p><p>\u201cCome, Miss Corning,\u201d he rumbled softly, \u201ca simple yes or no will do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, thank you,\u201d she said. \u201cOn one condition.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd that is?\u201d His eyes had narrowed ominously at her words.</p><p>She took a breath. \u201cI\u2019ll come if you\u2019ll tell me something about where you\u2019ve been for the last seven years.\u201d</p><p>His face darkened, and for a moment she thought he would turn and leave her in the hall. Then he nodded once, sharply. \u201cDone. Go get your wrap.\u201d</p><p>She ran up the stairs before he could change his mind.</p><p>But when she returned to the hallway, Lord Hope was not there. For a moment, disappointment swept through her. Had he only been playing with her?</p> <p>Then George the footman said, \u201c\u2019E\u2019s gone back to see Henry, miss. Said \u2019e wouldn\u2019t be but a minute.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Beatrice drew a breath, steadying her nerves. \u201cOh, well, in that case, I\u2019ll call on Henry myself.\u201d</p><p>The servants slept under the eaves, of course, way at the top of the town house. But because Henry was a big strong lad, and because he needed nursing, a pallet had been laid for him in a corner of the town-house kitchens. An old screen had been found to place in front of Henry\u2019s pallet when he wanted privacy, but when she entered the kitchen, Beatrice saw that it had been put aside. Lord Hope squatted by the pallet, talking in a low tone to the footman lying there.</p><p>Beatrice halted just inside the kitchen door. She couldn\u2019t see Lord Hope\u2019s face\u2014his back was to her\u2014but Henry\u2019s countenance was as brightly lit as if a god had come to visit him. It seemed an intimate moment somehow\u2014even though the principals were surrounded by the bustle of the kitchen\u2014and she didn\u2019t want to intrude. So she stood and watched.</p><p>Lord Hope spoke as Henry regarded him intently. She remembered now how Lord Hope had called to the footmen, mistaking them for soldiers. Even then, even when she\u2019d known he was in the midst of some strange delirium, she\u2019d seen his worry. His real care for \u201chis\u201d men. She pressed her trembling fingers to her lips silently. Just when she decided he was entirely self-centered, just when she feared he was nothing but a madman, now he must show this noble side of himself? Dear God, how could she side with her uncle against such a man?</p><p>The viscount murmured something more, leaned a little closer to the footman, and placed his hand on Henry\u2019s shoulder. With a final nod, he stood.</p><p>He turned and saw her.</p><p>Beatrice dropped her hand, smiling brightly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, I only meant to be a moment,\u201d he said as he neared. He eyed her curiously.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s no trouble at all.\u201d She tilted her head to look up at him, still dazzled by the whiteness of his wig, the harshness of his tattoos. \u201cHenry seemed pleased to see you.\u201d</p><p>He frowned, glancing back toward Henry\u2019s pallet. \u201cI noticed in my army days that it sometimes made a great difference.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVisiting the wounded.\u201d He held his arm for her, and she placed her fingertips on his black sleeve as they left the kitchen, very aware of the hard muscle beneath the fabric. \u201cSitting and chatting with a man laid low. It cheers the man\u2019s spirit, I think. Makes him realize that he is needed in this world. That others wait for his recovery.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid the other officers visit with their wounded men as well?\u201d she asked as they came to the front hall.</p><p>\u201cSome did. Not many.\u201d He handed her into the waiting carriage and then climbed in to sit opposite her. \u201cI always thought it a pity more officers did not realize the effectiveness of visiting their wounded men.\u201d</p><p>He knocked on the roof to signal the driver that they were ready.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps they weren\u2019t as compassionate as you,\u201d she said softly.</p><p>He seemed irritated. \u201cCompassion has nothing to do with it. It\u2019s an officer\u2019s duty to look after his men. They are in his charge.\u201d</p><p>Beatrice looked at him wonderingly. Duty might be a different motive than compassion, yet the outcome was the same. There\u2019d been a look of awe in Henry\u2019s face when Lord Hope had talked to him. Then, too, if Lord Hope cared so much for a footman he hardly knew but whom he considered one of \u201chis\u201d men, would he not care equally for men who\u2019d actually served in His Majesty\u2019s army?</p><p>She licked her lips. \u201cI\u2019ve heard that many men who\u2019ve served in His Majesty\u2019s army become quite destitute when they leave.\u201d</p><p>He glanced at her curiously. \u201cWhere have you heard that? I wouldn\u2019t think it a lady\u2019s daily conversation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, here and there.\u201d She shrugged, trying to look unconcerned. \u201cI\u2019ve also heard that some members of parliament are thinking of presenting a bill that would ensure veterans a fair pension.\u201d</p><p>He snorted. \u201cThat\u2019ll die a quick death. There\u2019re too many who would rather see the country\u2019s funds go elsewhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut if enough members back it\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey won\u2019t.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cNo one cares about the common soldier. Why d\u2019you think they\u2019re paid so poorly?\u201d</p><p>Beatrice bit her lip, unsure how to convince him to her cause. \u201cIf you become the earl, you\u2019ll sit in the House of Lords and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t the time to think of sitting in the House of Lords right now.\u201d He grimaced and shook his head. \u201cI must focus all of my mind, my time, my energy in obtaining my title. Once that bridge is crossed, then I\u2019ll contemplate the tangled web of politics, not before then.\u201d</p><p>Beatrice\u2019s heart sank. By the time he decided to involve himself in politics, it might be too late for Mr. Wheaton\u2019s bill. Too late for Jeremy.</p><p>She bit her lip, glancing out the carriage window as they rumbled along. How, then, could she convince Lord Hope that Mr. Wheaton needed his help to pass the bill now? If only she knew why he made the decisions he did\u2014why he was so obsessed with regaining his title. She straightened and turned to him with determination. It was even more important than ever to find out what had happened to him in the last seven years.</p><p>What had turned him into the man he was today.</p><p>REYNAUD WATCHED MISS Corning from beneath lowered eyelids. She sat primly on the seat across from him, nibbling at her full bottom lip. What was going through her quick little mind? And why had she brought up parliament of all things? Her uncle was a keen politician. Perhaps she merely wanted to know if he\u2019d become interested in politics once he attained the title. Become like her uncle.</p><p>He frowned. That wasn\u2019t likely to happen. He might be wearing a proper wig and clothing, but he\u2019d never settle into complacent English life entirely. His time in the Colonies had changed him, warped him. He was no longer the proper English aristocrat who\u2019d left London seven years ago. Perhaps that was what bothered her now. Perhaps she saw through the trappings of civilization to the man he really was. Sometimes he caught her staring at him with a curious uneasiness, like a deer scenting the air, aware of danger but with no knowledge of the wolf hiding in the trees behind her.</p><p>He turned his head to gaze blindly out the carriage window. His aunt had counseled him to find an English wife of good family. Well, wasn\u2019t that exactly what Miss Corning was? Above reproach, a maiden of his enemy\u2019s family? She was perfect for the role of wife. He pushed aside that primitive part of himself that exulted at the thought of this particular woman belonging to him. Instead, he began laying plans. A year ago he would\u2019ve simply carried her off in a raid. Now he must court in the English ways, which meant gaining the lady\u2019s favor.</p><p>Across from him, she cleared her throat with a delicate little sound.</p><p>He looked up at her.</p><p>She smiled, determined and beautiful, from beneath a ridiculously wide-brimmed hat. \u201cI believe you made a promise, my lord?\u201d</p><p>He inclined his head, though his pulse picked up. Of course she wouldn\u2019t forget their bargain.</p><p>And indeed her next words solidified his thought. \u201cI know \u2019tisn\u2019t any of my business, but could you tell me where you were all these years?\u201d</p><p>He looked at her silently, struggling not to bat her down with harsh, dismissive words.</p><p>The color rose in her cheeks, but she held his gaze even as she tilted her chin up. \u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>Courage would be an asset in the mother of his children.</p><p>\u201cIt is your business,\u201d he said. \u201cI was in the American Colonies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I know,\u201d she said gently, \u201cbut where? And why? Did you lose your memory? Who you were? I\u2019ve heard strange cases of injured men forgetting who and what they were.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I always knew who I was.\u201d He looked at her, so sheltered from the world. Would such a tale shock her? Repulse her? But she had asked. \u201cI was captured by Indians.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIndeed.\u201d Her gray eyes widened. \u201cBut surely you haven\u2019t been with them for seven years?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI was.\u201d He hesitated. The subject wasn\u2019t one he ever wanted to visit again in this lifetime, but the expression on Miss Corning\u2019s face was rapt. Had not Othello wooed his Desdemona thus? If telling her his bloody war tales would win her, he\u2019d do it, no matter the pain to himself. Brown eyes stared up through a mask of blood.</p><p>Even if it tore his soul in two.</p><p>\u201cI had no choice. I was enslaved.\u201d</p><p>BEATRICE DREW IN her breath at the word enslaved. The carriage bumped around a corner, jostling her against the side, but she paid little mind, caught up as she was with the thought of proud Lord Hope in slavery. The very thought was an abomination.</p> <p>\u201cIs that where you got those?\u201d She nodded at the bird tattoos.</p><p>He raised a hand to trace them. \u201cAye.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me,\u201d she said simply.</p><p>His hand dropped. \u201cYou\u2019ve heard about the massacre at Spinner\u2019s Falls.\u201d</p><p>It wasn\u2019t a question, but she answered it anyway. \u201cThere was an ambush. Most of the regiment were killed.\u201d</p> <p>He nodded, his face turned toward the window, though she somehow knew he saw nothing of what passed outside. \u201cWe were marching through the woods from Quebec to Fort Edward. The trail was narrow, and the men were forced to walk in single file. The regiment became strung out. Too damned strung out.\u201d</p><p>She watched as a muscle ticked in his jaw. He didn\u2019t like telling her this story, but he was doing it anyway.</p><p>He inhaled. \u201cI was riding to tell our colonel that I thought we should stop and let the tail catch up to the head of the line when the Indians attacked.\u201d</p><p>His lips set firmly, and for a moment she thought he wouldn\u2019t go on, but then he looked at her, his black eyes desperate.</p><p>\u201cWe couldn\u2019t form a line of defense. My men were being picked off before they could rally. The Indians shot from both sides of the trail, hidden in the trees. My men were screaming and falling, and then my colonel was pulled from his horse.\u201d</p><p>He looked blindly at his hands. \u201cThey scalped him. My men were dying all about me, screaming and being scalped.\u201d His fingers flexed into fists. \u201cMy horse caught a bullet and went down. I managed to jump free, but I was surrounded. I don\u2019t remember what happened then\u2014I think I was struck on the head\u2014but when I became aware of my surroundings again, we were being marched to the Indian camp. The French had given us to their allies as war booty.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDear God,\u201d Beatrice breathed, feeling sick to her stomach. How terrible for Lord Hope to lose his men thusly. How impotent he must\u2019ve felt.</p><p>He was gazing out the window again and made no indication that he\u2019d heard her. \u201cAfter we made the camp, I was separated from the others by the Indian who had captured me. His name was Sastaretsi. He stripped me naked, took my clothes away, and gave me only a thin, flea-infested blanket to cover myself with. Then Sastaretsi marched me through the woods for six weeks. By the time we\u2019d made his village, I was walking in bare feet through grass crusted with frost.\u201d</p><p>He paused, remembering that awful time, and Beatrice was silent, waiting.</p><p>\u201cAll that time,\u201d he whispered. \u201cAll that time, I schemed on how to kill Sastaretsi. But my hands were bound so tightly in front of me that the flesh had swollen into the leather thongs. He\u2019d pulled my fingernails from my hands so I could not use even their feeble strength to scratch my bonds loose. And at night he tied my bound hands to a stake driven deep in the ground. I was weakened from the cold and lack of nourishment. I think I might\u2019ve died in that endless wood if we hadn\u2019t happened upon a French trapper and his son. The man spoke some Wyandot and seemed to take pity on me, for he gave me an old shirt and a pair of leggings. Those leggings and shirt saved me.\u201d</p><p>He was silent again, and this time Beatrice knew he didn\u2019t mean to go on.</p><p>\u201cBut why?\u201d she finally blurted. \u201cWhy did Sastaretsi do all this to you?\u201d</p><p>He looked at her then, and his eyes were blank\u2014flat as if he were dead. \u201cBecause he meant to burn me at the stake when we reached his village.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Six</p> <p>Now, a giant hourglass sits in the throne room of the Goblin King, its sands endlessly flowing until time itself shall stop. By this means, the goblins mark time in their sunless land deep beneath the earth. It happened that one year when Longsword went to plea for his freedom, the Goblin King was in a particularly good mood, having just that day defeated a great prince in battle.</p><p>The Goblin King glanced at his hourglass and then said to Longsword, \u201cYou\u2019ve served me well for seven years, my slave. Because of this, I shall make you a bargain.\u201d</p><p>Longsword bowed his head, for he knew well that a bargain with the Goblin King suits only the Goblin King.</p><p>\u201cYou may walk the earth above for one year,\u201d the Goblin King said. \u201cMark you, one year only. At the end of that time, if you have found one Christian soul to voluntarily take your place in the land of the goblins, then you shall be free and I shall trouble you no more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd if I do not?\u201d Longsword asked.</p><p>The Goblin King grinned. \u201cThen you shall serve me for all eternity. . . .\u201d</p><p>\u2014from Longsword</p><p>Lottie Graham sipped her wine, peering at her husband over the edge of the glass. Nathan was absorbed in thought tonight, his broad brow slightly knit, his blue eyes vague and unfocused.</p><p>She set down the wineglass precisely and said, \u201cWe received an invitation to a ball hosted by Miss Molyneux today.\u201d</p><p>There was a pause that stretched so long that for a moment she thought he wouldn\u2019t answer her at all.</p><p>Then Nate blinked. \u201cWho?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMiss Cristelle Molyneux.\u201d Lottie cut into the roast duck on her plate. \u201cShe\u2019s Reynaud St. Aubyn\u2019s aunt on his mother\u2019s side. I think she plans to reintroduce him to society. In any case, the invitation was sent on scandalously short notice\u2014she plans it for this Thursday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeems silly to plan it on so little notice,\u201d Nate said. \u201cWill anyone show, I wonder?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, she\u2019ll have no problem filling her ballroom.\u201d Lottie speared a piece of duck, but then set it back on the plate. Her appetite seemed nonexistent tonight. \u201cEveryone will be wanting to see the mysterious mad earl.\u201d</p><p>Nate frowned. \u201cHe\u2019s not an earl yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut surely it\u2019s only a matter of time?\u201d Lottie twirled her wineglass stem.</p><p>\u201cOnly a fool would think that.\u201d</p><p>Lottie felt tears spring to her eyes. She looked down at her lap. \u201cI\u2019m sorry you think me a fool.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know that\u2019s not what I meant.\u201d His voice was brisk, impatient.</p><p>There\u2019d been a time back before they\u2019d married when her slightest frown would cause him to offer profuse apologies. Once, he\u2019d sent her an arrangement of flowers so big it\u2019d taken two footmen to bring it into the house. All because he\u2019d not been able to take her driving on a day it\u2019d rained.</p><p>Now he thought her a fool.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll take a special parliamentary committee, I believe,\u201d Nate was saying as she thought these gloomy things, \u201cto decide if this man is indeed St. Aubyn, and if he is, who the proper Earl of Blanchard is. That, at least, is the opinion of many of the learned parliamentarians. There hasn\u2019t been a case such as this one in living memory, and many are quite interested in the legal implications.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre they?\u201d Lottie murmured. She\u2019d lost interest in the conversation while her husband had finally become engaged in it. Had her marriage always been thus? \u201cIn any case, I thought it would be nice to attend the ball. It\u2019s bound to have all the best gossip of the year.\u201d</p><p>She glanced up in time to catch the look of irritation that crossed his face.</p><p>\u201cI know that keeping up with the latest scandal is vital to you, dearest,\u201d he said. \u201cBut there are actually other things of import in the world, you know.\u201d</p><p>There was a short, awful silence.</p><p>\u201cFirst I\u2019m a fool and now I\u2019m interested only in gossip,\u201d Lottie said very clearly, because she was holding back the tears with all her will. \u201cI begin to wonder, sir, why you married me at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow, Lottie, you know I didn\u2019t mean it that way,\u201d he replied, and didn\u2019t even bother trying to hide the edge of exasperation in his voice.</p><p>\u201cIn what way did you mean it, Nathan?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head, a reasonable man beset by a mad wife. \u201cYou\u2019re overwrought.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am not,\u201d Lottie said, the tears beginning to overflow, \u201coverwrought.\u201d</p><p>He sighed, pushed his chair back from the table, and stood. \u201cThis conversation is pointless. I\u2019ll leave you to yourself until you\u2019ve once again regained your senses. Good night, madam.\u201d</p><p>And he left. She sat there in the dining room, gasping and trembling and thoroughly humiliated.</p><p>It was the last straw.</p><p>\u201cHE\u2019S VERY HURT, Jeremy,\u201d Beatrice said as she paced from Jeremy\u2019s heavily draped window to his bed. \u201cYou have no idea. He told me just a fraction of what he\u2019d experienced in the Colonies, and it was all I could do not to scream aloud. How could he survive such horrors? And yet he\u2019s incredibly strong, incredibly determined. It\u2019s as if he\u2019s driven out of his soul whatever softness he may\u2019ve once felt. He\u2019s been fire-hardened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe sounds very interesting,\u201d Jeremy said.</p><p>Beatrice looked at him. \u201cI\u2019ve never met a gentleman like him in all my life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does Lord Hope look like now that he\u2019s transformed himself?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s tall with very wide shoulders and wears a sort of aloof glare most of the time. He\u2019s quite intimidating and rather savage-looking, actually.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you said he\u2019d cut his hair and donned a wig and other civilized accoutrements. He sounds quite normal to me,\u201d Jeremy said from the bed. That was the best part about Jeremy\u2014he always took an interest in one\u2019s thoughts and troubles, no matter how trivial.</p><p>\u201cHe may wear the same sort of clothes as other gentlemen, but they fit him differently somehow.\u201d Beatrice picked up a tall green bottle from Jeremy\u2019s cache of medicines and peered at the dark liquid inside before returning it to its brethren. \u201cAnd he\u2019s still wearing that earring I told you about. The tattoos he can\u2019t remove, but why do you think he hasn\u2019t taken off the earring?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t the faintest,\u201d Jeremy replied with evident delight. \u201cI do wish I were able to meet him, though.\u201d</p><p>Beatrice turned and glanced at him. Jeremy was sitting up in bed today. She\u2019d plumped the pillows for him and helped him sit higher. His cheeks were still flushed, his eyes too bright, but she fancied he was a little better than the last time she\u2019d seen him.</p><p>At least she hoped so.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps I can bring him around someday,\u201d she said.</p><p>He glanced away. \u201cDon\u2019t, Bea.\u201d</p><p>She blinked. \u201cWhy ever not?\u201d</p><p>His eyes met hers, and for a moment all amusement left his face. His extraordinary blue eyes were stern, almost cold, and she wondered in a flash of insight if this was what he\u2019d looked like on the battlefield when he\u2019d led his men.</p><p>Then his expression softened a little. \u201cYou know why.\u201d</p><p>She grimaced because she did know why. \u201cYou\u2019re too sensitive to your injury. Many men come home without an arm or a leg or even an eye, and one continues to see them at balls and events. No one singles them out except to say how brave they were.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not what Frances said.\u201d Jeremy\u2019s eyes were old and sad.</p><p>She bit her lip. \u201cFrances was a complete and utter ninny, and frankly I think you were saved years of insipid conversation over your morning tea when she called off your engagement.\u201d</p><p>He laughed, thankfully, but it turned to a cough, and she had to hurry over and pour him a cup of water. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIn any case,\u201d he gasped when he could draw breath again, \u201cI\u2019ll not be going out in public again. You know that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut why?\u201d She knelt by his bed on a little cushioned stool so that her face was closer to his on the pillow. \u201cI know you fear the stares of others, Jeremy dear, but you must get out of this room. You live as if you\u2019re already deep beneath the ground in a coffin. You\u2019re not. You live and breathe and laugh, and I want you to be happy.\u201d</p><p>He caught her hand in his, and it was like being gripped by flames. \u201cIt takes two footmen just to lift me into that chair so I can sit by the fire. The last time they tried to carry me down the stairs, one of the footmen tripped and nearly dropped me.\u201d He closed his bright blue eyes, wincing as if in pain. \u201cI know you think me a coward, but I can\u2019t face that again.\u201d</p><p>She closed her eyes as well, because she felt as if she were losing him, her oldest and dearest friend. For the last five years, ever since his return from the war on the Continent, she\u2019d known that he was slowly slipping away from her. Every time she saw him, he was a little more distant, a little more beyond her reach. Soon she wouldn\u2019t be able to touch him at all.</p> <p>\u201cLet us be married.\u201d Beatrice tightened her hands around his, pushing aside her own desires in her desperate fear for him. \u201cJeremy dear, why don\u2019t we? Then we could buy a little house and live together, you and I. We wouldn\u2019t need that many servants\u2014just a cook and some maids and footmen, and no haughty butler to bother with. Wouldn\u2019t that be lovely?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, it would indeed, darling Bea.\u201d Jeremy\u2019s eyes were very gentle now. \u201cBut I\u2019m afraid it wouldn\u2019t work. You\u2019d want children one day, and I\u2019ve set my heart on marrying a black-haired lass, perhaps with green eyes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d break my heart for a green-eyed lady you don\u2019t even know?\u201d Beatrice half laughed, choking back tears. \u201cI never knew I ranked so low in your estimation, sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou rank above the angels themselves, my darling Bea.\u201d Jeremy laughed back. \u201cBut we all must have dreams. And my dream is that one day you\u2019ll be surrounded by a family of your own.\u201d</p><p>She bowed her head at that, for what could she reply? In her mind\u2019s eye, Beatrice, too, saw herself sitting among a crowd of children. But when she imagined their father, it wasn\u2019t Jeremy\u2019s face she saw but Viscount Hope\u2019s.</p> <p>\u201cWILL YOU TELL me what happened when you reached Sastaretsi\u2019s camp?\u201d Beatrice asked late the next morning.</p><p>She\u2019d accompanied Lord Hope on a shopping expedition to Bond Street, hoping for an opportunity to ask about his past again. His aunt was planning a grand ball on the morrow to reintroduce him to society, and there were many last-minute items to purchase, including dancing slippers for him. But more importantly\u2014at least to her\u2014she wanted to hear the rest of his story.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d\u2019ve thought you\u2019d forget the matter by now,\u201d he replied.</p><p>It had been almost a week since he\u2019d told her the story of the march to the Indian camp. During that time, she\u2019d hardly seen him, he\u2019d been so busy conferring with his aunt and doing other more mysterious things. He\u2019d disappear before she rose for breakfast and sometimes didn\u2019t reappear back at Blanchard House until after dinner or later. This meant that his and Uncle Reggie\u2019s paths rarely crossed\u2014which was good\u2014but it also meant that she\u2019d rather missed his sarcastic company over the last week.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she murmured softly. \u201cI doubt I\u2019ll ever forget what you\u2019ve told me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why make me continue?\u201d he asked almost angrily. \u201cIs it not enough that I have to bear those images in my mind? Why should you share them, too?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBecause I want to,\u201d she said simply. She couldn\u2019t explain it better than that. She wanted to know what he\u2019d gone through; the need was more than simple curiosity.</p><p>He looked at her quizzically. \u201cI don\u2019t understand you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d she said with satisfaction.</p><p>He grunted on what might\u2019ve been a laugh. She turned to stare at him suspiciously, but his face became grave as he inhaled.</p><p>\u201cWhen we came to the Indian camp, Sastaretsi blacked my face with charcoal to signify that I was to die. He tied a rope about my neck and led me into the village in triumph. He whooped as we came to let the others know that he\u2019d brought home a captive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow terrifying.\u201d Beatrice shivered.</p><p>\u201cYes. It\u2019s intended to be terrifying to the captive. I was made to run the gauntlet,\u201d Lord Hope said as they came to a rather foul-looking puddle in the street. It was quite wide, and Beatrice was eyeing it uncertainly when he grasped her by the waist and simply lifted her over it.</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d she squeaked. He stood for a moment on the other side of the puddle, holding her in the air without any visible sign of strain. \u201cMy lord!\u201d</p> <p>He cocked his head, studying her face just slightly above his. \u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>She felt her breath come short, very aware of his large hands at her waist and the gleam in his black eyes.</p><p>\u201cYou should put me down,\u201d Beatrice hissed. \u201cPeople are staring.\u201d</p><p>And indeed they were. A group of ladies giggled nervously behind gloved hands, and a cart driver leered as he passed.</p><p>\u201cAre they?\u201d he asked absently.</p><p>\u201cLord Hope\u2014\u201d</p><p>But he was lowering her to the ground as if nothing had happened. Really! He hadn\u2019t given her any warning at all. Did he want to be thought mad?</p><p>She peeked up at him and cleared her throat. \u201cWhat\u2019s the gauntlet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA nasty way to welcome captives to an Indian camp.\u201d He held out his arm for her, and she placed her gloved fingers primly on his sleeve. \u201cAll the inhabitants in the village form two lines, and the captive must run between them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t sound too bad.\u201d</p><p>He looked down at her, the bird tattoos decorating his swarthy skin, the iron cross swinging from his ear. He looked like a pirate. \u201cThey hit and kick the captive as he runs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d She swallowed. \u201cAnd when he reaches the end of the line, what happens then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt depends,\u201d he said, guiding her around a clump of ladies eagerly peering in a shop window. \u201cIf the captive is a child or young boy, sometimes he is adopted into the Indian tribe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd if he is older?\u201d she whispered, dreading the answer.</p><p>\u201cThen most often he is tortured and killed.\u201d</p><p>She inhaled sharply. He said it so matter-of-factly.</p><p>\u201cWere you . . .\u201d She swallowed. How could she ask? But she had to know. The experience no matter how terrible was part of who he was. \u201cWere you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t tortured.\u201d His lips tightened as he looked straight ahead. \u201cNot then anyway.\u201d</p><p>Sudden tears rushed to her eyes. No, part of her wailed inside. Not him. Not this man. She\u2019d known it had to have happened, but to hear it from his lips was devastating. For them to have hurt\u2014shamed\u2014this man ripped apart a portion of her soul. She felt suddenly older. Weary with the knowledge.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened instead?\u201d she asked quietly.</p><p>\u201cGaho saved me,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cWho is Gaho? And how did he save you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe.\u201d</p><p>She stopped and looked up at him, ignoring the mutters of the other pedestrians who were forced to go around them. \u201cA lady Indian saved you?\u201d</p><p>He smiled down into her face, making the birds crinkle as if they\u2019d taken flight. \u201cYes. A powerful lady Indian saved me. She owned more furs, more pots, and more slaves than any other in that village. You might even call her a princess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHumph.\u201d She faced forward and began to walk, but she was unable to keep the question from leaving her lips. \u201cWas she pretty?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery.\u201d She felt the whisper of his breath against her ear as he leaned down to tease her. \u201cFor a woman in her sixth decade.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d She tilted her nose in the air, feeling irrationally relieved. \u201cWell, how did Gaho save you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSastaretsi had a rather bad reputation it seems. A year before, he\u2019d killed one of Gaho\u2019s favorite slaves in an argument. Gaho was a wise woman. She knew that Sastaretsi had very little to his name, so she\u2019d bided her time until he acquired something that she might demand in repayment for the loss of her slave\u2014me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what did she do with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think, Miss Corning?\u201d His wide, sensuous mouth twisted, curving down sardonically. \u201cI was the son of an earl, a captain in His Majesty\u2019s army, and I became the slave of an old Indian woman. Is that what you wanted to hear? That I was reduced to the lowest of the low in that Indian camp?\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d stopped in the street, but no one muttered as the crowd gave them a wide berth. Lord Hope might be attired like an aristocrat, but his expression was savage at the moment.</p><p>Beatrice had a cowardly urge to flee, but she stood her ground, tilting her chin up at him, holding his wild black eyes as she said, \u201cNo. No, I never wanted to hear that you were humiliated.\u201d</p><p>He leaned over her, large and intimidating. \u201cThen why persist in asking?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I need to know,\u201d she said low and rapidly. \u201cI need to know everything that happened to you, everything you experienced in that place. I need to know why you are the man you\u2019ve become.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d His black eyes widened with confusion. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>And all she could whisper was, \u201cI just do.\u201d</p><p>Because she couldn\u2019t admit, even to herself, why.</p><p>REYNAUD HAD LED men into battle, had faced an Indian gauntlet without flinching, had endured seven years as the slave of his enemy and survived. All this he had done without a breath of fear. Therefore, it was simply impossible that he\u2019d feel missish nerves at the thought of a ball.</p><p>Yet, impossible as it seemed, here he was pacing the hallway as he waited for Miss Corning to descend the stairs.</p><p>Reynaud halted and took a deep breath. He was the son of an earl. He\u2019d attended innumerable balls before his capture in the Colonies. This creeping feeling he had\u2014that he no longer belonged in London society, that he\u2019d be denounced and repudiated\u2014was ridiculous. He shrugged his shoulders in his new coat, twisting his head about to loosen the muscles of his neck. His new wig was impeccable, he knew\u2014he\u2019d hired a competent valet with the monies lent by his aunt\u2014but it still felt foreign on his head. When he\u2019d lived with the Indians, the only thing he\u2019d covered his head with was a blanket, and then only when the winters were especially cold. He\u2019d worn a long tail of braided hair, and his clothes had been a shirt, breechcloth, leggings, and moccasins\u2014all soft materials, well worn and comfortable. Now he had a scratchy wig on his newly shorn head, a neck cloth half strangling him, and his new dancing slippers felt tight. Why so-called civilized men should choose to wear\u2014</p><p>\u201cThought you\u2019d be gone to that damned ball by now,\u201d a male voice said from behind him.</p><p>Reynaud whirled, crouching low, his knife already in his right hand. St. Aubyn started back.</p><p>\u201cHave a care,\u201d the usurper cried. \u201cCould hurt someone with that knife.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot unless I wished to,\u201d Reynaud said as he straightened. His heart pounded erratically. He slid his knife back inside the sheath he\u2019d had specially made and glanced up the staircase. Miss Corning was late. \u201cAnd I\u2019m waiting for your niece if you must know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat d\u2019you mean, waiting?\u201d St. Aubyn\u2019s face darkened.</p><p>\u201cI mean,\u201d Reynaud enunciated clearly, \u201cthat I intend to escort Miss Corning to the ball given by my aunt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNonsense!\u201d the old man sputtered. \u201cIf anyone\u2019s escorting Beatrice, \u2019twill be me.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Reynaud arched an eyebrow. \u201cI wasn\u2019t aware you were attending the ball.\u201d St. Aubyn had been invited, of course, but from his lack of comment in the last week, Reynaud had rather thought the other man had thrown the invitation away.</p><p>Apparently not.</p><p>\u201cOf course I\u2019ll be attending. Think I\u2019d let a popinjay such as you chase me away?\u201d</p><p>Reynaud took a step closer to the other man so that he loomed over him. \u201cWhen I\u2019m in possession of my title, I shall take great pleasure in personally throwing you from this house.\u201d</p> <p>St. Aubyn\u2019s face was nearly apoplectic. \u201cYour title! Your title! You\u2019ll never see it, sir!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve already set the date to appeal my case before the parliamentary committee.\u201d Reynaud slowly grinned as he watched all color drain from the older man\u2019s face.</p><p>St. Aubyn\u2019s mouth twisted. \u201cThey\u2019ll take one look at you and deny you the title. You\u2019re insane, and everyone in London knows it. One only has to see those tattoos and\u2014\u201d</p><p>But something had snapped in Reynaud. He surged forward, gripping the older man\u2019s neck and slamming him against the wall. The usurper\u2019s face turned purple, the sour smell of fear rolling off him, and then St. Aubyn\u2019s gooseberry eyes suddenly shifted, looking behind Reynaud.</p><p>At the same time, small fists pounded his back.</p> <p>\u201cLet go of him! Let go of him!\u201d Miss Corning cried.</p><p>Reynaud bared his teeth at St. Aubyn and then backed away, freeing the man.</p><p>Immediately Miss Corning flew to her uncle. \u201cAre you all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine\u2014\u201d the old man started.</p><p>But she swung on Reynaud like an avenging fury. \u201cHow dare you? What could possibly possess you to manhandle him so?\u201d</p><p>Reynaud raised his hands in surrender. He knew better than to try to talk his way out of this. But then he really looked at Miss Corning. She wore a blazing bronze gown that made her creamy skin positively glow. The bodice was low and square, and her breasts were pressed into two tempting mounds.</p> <p>\u201cAhem.\u201d</p><p>His gaze snapped up at her pointed murmur.</p><p>Miss Corning\u2019s bosom might be inviting, but her expression was anything but. \u201cYou had no right to lay hands on Uncle Reggie. He\u2019s ill\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeatrice!\u201d her uncle protested, looking embarrassed.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s true and he needs to know it.\u201d She stood with arms akimbo and glared at Reynaud. \u201cUncle Reggie had an attack of apoplexy a little more than a month ago. You could\u2019ve killed him just now. Promise me you\u2019ll never lay hands on him again.\u201d</p><p>Reynaud eyed the older man, who wasn\u2019t looking particularly grateful for his niece\u2019s interference.</p><p>\u201cLord Hope.\u201d She stepped closer and laid one gloved hand on his chest, looking up into his face. \u201cPromise me, my lord.\u201d</p><p>He took her hand and, holding her gaze, slowly raised it to his lips. \u201cAs you wish,\u201d he breathed over her knuckles.</p> <p>She blushed and snatched back her hand. Reynaud grinned.</p><p>But St. Aubyn was not as interested in avoiding discord. \u201cSurely you don\u2019t mean to accompany this... this jackanapes to the ball, Beatrice?\u201d</p><p>Miss Corning hesitated, but then she threw back her shoulders and turned to her uncle. \u201cI\u2019m afraid I do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut, m\u2019dear, had I known you wished to go to this ball, I could\u2019ve escorted you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, Uncle Reggie, dear.\u201d She laid a hand on the old man\u2019s arm. \u201cYou\u2019ve always been most attentive in taking me to whatever amusements I fancied. But you see, Lord Hope asked me to this ball, and I want to go with him.\u201d</p><p>St. Aubyn shook off her hand rudely. \u201cIs that your choice, then, girl? Him? Because I tell you right now, there\u2019ll be a choice to be made: him or me. You can\u2019t have it both ways.\u201d</p><p>Miss Corning\u2019s hand fell to her side, but her gaze was steady and unwavering on her uncle. For the first time, Reynaud realized that there was a kind of strength there beneath her sweet manner. \u201cPerhaps I will have to make a choice someday. But that is not my wish, truly. Can\u2019t you see that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour wishes don\u2019t come into it, lass. Remember that.\u201d He shook a finger in her face. \u201cAnd don\u2019t forget who\u2019s kept a roof over your head these nineteen years. If I\u2019d known how ungrateful you\u2019d be for the care I\u2019ve shown you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cEnough.\u201d Reynaud stepped toward the man.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Miss Corning laid her hand on Reynaud\u2019s arm now, but unlike her uncle, he wasn\u2019t going to hurt her feelings by shaking her off.</p><p>St. Aubyn eyed her hand, and his lips twisted. Then he turned abruptly and stomped up the stairs.</p><p>\u201cHe hasn\u2019t the right to talk to you so,\u201d Reynaud growled softly.</p><p>\u201cHe has every right.\u201d She turned to look at him, but though her gaze was steady, her gray eyes sparkled with tears. \u201cHe\u2019s perfectly correct; he has provided a home\u2014and love\u2014for me for nineteen years. And I\u2019ve hurt his feelings.\u201d</p><p>Reynaud took her hand and moved it farther up his arm so that he could escort her to the waiting carriage. \u201cNonetheless, I don\u2019t want him acting toward you the way he just did. Do you need a wrap?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had my maid put a wrap in the carriage, and don\u2019t try to change the subject. It\u2019s not your duty to defend me from my uncle.\u201d</p><p>He stopped beside the carriage steps, forcing her to halt as well. \u201cIf I choose to defend you from your uncle\u2014or anyone else\u2014I damned well will with or without your permission, madam.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGoodness, how very primitive of you,\u201d she said. \u201cAre you going to help me into the carriage, or will you keep me out here, proclaiming your right to safeguard me until I freeze?\u201d</p><p>He frowned down at her, but every reply he could think of made him look an ass, so he simply handed her into the carriage without a word. The door was shut behind him, and in a moment the horses started forward.</p><p>He looked across at Miss Corning, who\u2019d pulled a thin wrap about her shoulders. \u201cThat gown becomes you.\u201d</p><p>She smiled, quick and brilliant. \u201cWhy, thank you, my lord.\u201d</p><p>He cast about for something else to say but couldn\u2019t think of a thing. He was out of practice in the art of light conversation, after all. Most of his discussion of the last seven years had been filled with the topic of food\u2014where there might be game and if there was enough meat to feed Gaho\u2019s small band for the winter.</p><p>Miss Corning was the one who broke the silence. \u201cAre you going to tell me about your experiences in the Indian camp?\u201d</p><p>He was silent a moment, reluctant to continue the story. It was all in his past anyway. Wasn\u2019t it better forgotten? To bring up starvation and torture, nights of lying awake far from home and family, fearful that he\u2019d never see England again... surely there was no need to make that all come alive again?</p><p>\u201cPlease?\u201d she whispered, and he caught the scent of English flowers\u2014her scent.</p><p>Why did she demand this of him? She didn\u2019t even seem to know herself. And yet he felt compelled to answer her demand.</p><p>Even if it meant tearing open a still-fresh wound.</p><p>\u201cLater.\u201d The glow from the carriage lantern illuminated her face and shoulders but left the rest of the lady in darkness, giving her an air of mystery. Reynaud felt a stirring low in his belly at the sight. If telling her his wretched story brought her closer, it was well worth it.</p><p>He stretched his legs so that they brushed against the voluminous skirts of her gown. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you all about living in an Indian village, about hunting deer and raccoon, and even about the time I battled a full-grown bear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh!\u201d Her lovely gray eyes widened in excitement.</p><p>He smiled. \u201cBut not tonight. There\u2019s too little time before we arrive at my aunt\u2019s house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Her lower lip thrust out just a little in a charming pout. He eyed that lip, full and shining in the carriage light. He wanted to bite it.</p><p>\u201cYou tease me so, my lord,\u201d she said softly, and her voice seemed to catch.</p><p>He looked into her eyes, wide and innocent, but with a feminine spark that wasn\u2019t innocent at all. \u201cDo I? And do you like to be teased, Miss Corning?\u201d</p><p>Her eyelashes lowered. \u201cI think... Yes, I do like the teasing. As long as it isn\u2019t too prolonged.\u201d</p><p>His smile widened, becoming wolfish. \u201cIs that a challenge?\u201d</p><p>She peeked up at him. \u201cPerhaps.\u201d</p><p>Reynaud sat forward, reaching across the swaying carriage, and brushed his knuckles against her cheek. So soft. So warm. She sat very still.</p><p>He inhaled and sat back again. \u201cI\u2019ve lived a very long time away from civilization. I\u2019m afraid I\u2019ve forgotten the niceties of flirtation. I don\u2019t want to scare you.\u201d</p><p>She licked her lips, and his eyes dropped to her mouth. He watched it move, lush and beckoning, as she said, \u201cI... I don\u2019t scare so easily as all that, my lord. And I\u2019ve never been particularly fond of the artifice of flirtation.\u201d</p><p>His heartbeat quickened at her whispered words, his muscles tensing to leap on prey. Mine, a part of him far removed from civilization cried. Mine. What he might\u2019ve done next he wasn\u2019t sure, but the carriage shuddered to a halt. He drew in a breath and straightened, easing his bunched shoulders. Glancing outside, he could see they were in front of his aunt\u2019s house.</p><p>He turned back to Miss Corning and held out his hand. \u201cShall we?\u201d</p><p>She eyed his hand a split second before taking it.</p><p>And he hid a smile. Soon, very soon, he\u2019d take what was his, but right now he had to face the horrors of a London ball.</p><p>Chapter Seven</p><p>Well, this was a terrible bargain, indeed! But Longsword looked into the Goblin King\u2019s glowing orange eyes and knew that if he were ever to see the sun again, he had no choice. He nodded once. At his assent, a great wind lifted him, whirling and sweeping him high, high, until he was suddenly dumped on hard, dusty earth. Longsword opened his eyes and saw the sun for the first time in seven years. The breeze brushed his cheek. He had just risen and grasped his sword when he heard a roar from behind him.</p><p>Longsword turned and beheld the most beautiful lady in the world... in the grasp of a giant dragon....</p><p>\u2014from Longsword</p><p>Mademoiselle Molyneux had had only a little more than a week to plan the ball in honor of Lord Hope, but in that time she\u2019d created a wonder. Beatrice was hard-pressed not to stare as the viscount ushered her into the great ballroom. Three huge chandeliers hung from the ceiling, sparkling like miniature stars. All along one wall, tall mirrors were draped with garlands of flowers and gold silk, and a great pyramid of flowers hid the musicians in one corner.</p><p>\u201cHow splendid!\u201d Beatrice exclaimed. \u201cYour aunt must be a magician to have effected such a delightfully decorated room so soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t be surprised,\u201d Lord Hope muttered. \u201cI\u2019ve always thought Tante Cristelle had powers beyond a mere mortal\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>Beatrice glanced up at him in amusement. His body had stiffened beside hers when they\u2019d entered the magnificent ballroom, and heads had turned toward them. People were staring and whispering behind fans. Even so, he seemed to be relaxing a bit, though he fingered the knife at his waist.</p><p>\u201cHas she always lived in this town house by herself?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d His voice was distracted as he looked across the room, but then he glanced down at her. \u201cNo. Actually, this house belongs to my sister\u2014or rather her son.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHer son?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. He\u2019s Lord Eddings\u2014inherited the title from his father. When my sister, Emeline, married again and settled in the Colonies with her new husband, Tante Cristelle agreed to stay here and help manage the estate.\u201d</p><p>Beatrice laid her hand on his sleeve. \u201cYou must miss your sister so.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI think of her every day.\u201d</p><p>An expression of sudden sorrow crossed his features, sharp and fleeting and all the more breathtaking because he so rarely showed any of the softer emotions. She leaned closer to him, drawn by his emotion despite the crowd surrounding them.</p><p>\u201cHope,\u201d a male voice drawled from behind them.</p><p>Beatrice looked up to see Viscount Vale\u2019s turquoise eyes watching her curiously. He had a bluish bruise on his jaw. Beside him was his wife, a tall, thin lady with a calm, slightly amused face.</p> <p>She felt the muscle of Lord Hope\u2019s arm flex beneath her fingers, but his face revealed nothing. \u201cVale.\u201d</p><p>Lord Vale cocked his head. \u201cPity you\u2019ve shaved off all those whiskers. They gave you a rather Biblical air.\u201d</p><p>Lord Hope\u2019s lips twitched.</p><p>\u201cSorry to disappoint.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot at all,\u201d Lord Vale said carelessly. \u201cI suppose you must don the local costume like the rest of us.\u201d</p> <p>The lady beside him sighed. \u201cVale,\u201d she said, \u201care you going to introduce me, or will you continue to trade insults with Lord Hope for the rest of the night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do beg your pardon, my lady wife.\u201d Lord Vale turned and held out his hand to the lady, who placed her fingers in his. \u201cMay I introduce you to Reynaud St. Aubyn, Viscount Hope and no doubt soon to be the true Earl of Blanchard? Hope, this is my lady wife, Melisande Renshaw, Viscountess Vale.\u201d</p><p>The lady made a stately curtsy as Lord Hope bowed over her hand. \u201cAn honor, my lady, but we\u2019ve already met, I think. Were you not a dear friend and neighbor of my sister, Emeline?\u201d</p><p>Lady Vale\u2019s pale cheeks pinkened delicately. \u201cIndeed, my lord. I spent many a happy afternoon at the Blanchard estate in Suffolk. I know your sister will be very pleased to hear that you are well. The news of your death was a terrible blow to her.\u201d</p><p>Lord Hope stiffened, but he only nodded to Lady Vale.</p><p>\u201cAnd this,\u201d continued Lord Vale, \u201cis Hope\u2019s cousin, Miss Corning, whom we met last spring at Mother\u2019s garden party.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHow do you do, ma\u2019am?\u201d Beatrice murmured as she sank into a curtsy.</p><p>When she rose, she saw that the lady and her husband seemed to be exchanging some kind of silent communication.</p><p>Lady Vale smiled and turned to Beatrice. \u201cWould you care to stroll with me, Miss Corning, and admire Miss Molyneux\u2019s fine decorations? Vale says we must hold a ball of our own soon, and I would be grateful for your opinion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Beatrice said. The gentlemen were outwardly polite, but there was a tension in their stances. Obviously Lord Vale wished to talk with Lord Hope alone.</p><p>Lady Vale linked her arm with Beatrice\u2019s, and they began a slow perambulation of the room.</p><p>\u201cDo you make your home in London always, Miss Corning?\u201d Lady Vale asked.</p><p>\u201cI live with my uncle, ma\u2019am, in Blanchard House.\u201d Beatrice darted a quick look over her shoulder. Lord Vale was talking intently with Lord Hope, but at least they hadn\u2019t come to fisticuffs. She faced forward again. \u201cThat is where Lord Hope is staying at the moment as well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. That must be... interesting,\u201d Lady Vale murmured.</p> <p>\u201cYes, it certainly is. I believe Lord Hope stays out of pure contrariness.\u201d Beatrice glanced at her companion. \u201cYou knew him when he was a boy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was away at school generally when I visited the Blanchard country estate, but, yes, he was a young boy, not quite a man. I remember that Emeline and I had not yet come out when he bought his commission in the army.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat was he like?\u201d</p><p>Lady Vale was silent a moment as they made a wide arc. They came to a side hall, and she asked, \u201cDo you mind? I rather dislike crowds.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot at all,\u201d Beatrice replied.</p><p>After the brightness of the ballroom, the hallway\u2019s lighting was muted. Tall portraits lined the walls. A few other guests drifted here and there, but they were distant enough not to overhear their conversation.</p><p>\u201cYou asked about Lord Hope,\u201d Lady Vale began. \u201cI did not see him often when I was young, but I remember being rather in awe of him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>Lady Vale nodded. \u201cHe was so very handsome, even then. But there was more. He was the young heir to the throne, as it were. He almost seemed to have a golden glow about him.\u201d</p><p>Beatrice bowed her head, contemplating this information as they walked. What a downfall it must\u2019ve been for a man with a \u201cgolden glow\u201d to have been made a slave. How much more humiliating it must\u2019ve been for proud Lord Hope to sink so low. They came to a tall portrait of a man in armor in the style of the last century, and Lady Vale stopped.</p><p>She tilted her head, studying the painting. \u201cHis hair is quite extravagant, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>Beatrice looked at the painting and smiled. The gentleman had abundant dark curls hanging on either side of his face. \u201cAnd he\u2019s proud of it, isn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIndeed.\u201d</p><p>They were silent for a moment.</p><p>Then Beatrice said, \u201cThere\u2019s a portrait of Lord Hope that hangs in the sitting room of Blanchard House. It\u2019s always been there, ever since I arrived when I was nineteen. I think it must\u2019ve been painted when he was about the age you speak of. He\u2019s so handsome and looks so lighthearted. I used to think he was hiding a mischievous thought when he was painted. I confess I\u2019ve spent hours staring at that painting. It rather fascinated me.\u201d She felt Lady Vale turn and look at her and knew she was blushing. \u201cYou must think me a fool.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot at all,\u201d the other lady said gently. \u201cMerely a romantic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you see, since Lord Hope\u2019s return . . .\u201d She had to pause and swallow because her throat had tightened. \u201cHe was captured and held by Indians. Did you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I did not,\u201d the other woman murmured.</p><p>Beatrice nodded, taking a deep breath. \u201cI don\u2019t see anything of that young boy in him anymore\u2014the laughing boy in the painting. The things that happened to him in the Colonies were so very terrible that they changed him. He\u2019s grim now. Intent only on regaining his title. It\u2019s as if he\u2019s forgotten what he was before, as if he\u2019s forgotten how to enjoy life.\u201d</p><p>Lady Vale sighed. \u201cMy husband was in that war as well. He is quite merry on the outside, but inside there are wounds, believe me.\u201d</p><p>Beatrice thought about that. \u201cBut Lord Vale seems more free somehow. He is happy, isn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think so.\u201d Lady Vale smiled a secret smile. \u201cBut you comprehend that Lord Vale returned from the Colonies nearly seven years ago, while Lord Hope has only now come home. You must allow him time, I think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose so,\u201d Beatrice said doubtfully. It was true that Lord Hope was still adjusting to his return, but would time truly heal him? Would he become more lighthearted, or had his experience seared him so deeply he was changed forever? She thought of something else. \u201cDoes Lord Vale truly think Lord Hope betrayed their regiment?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>Beatrice turned to look at Lady Vale. The hallway was dim, but the lady\u2019s eyes seemed puzzled. \u201cLord Hope said that when your husband came to visit him last week, Lord Vale accused him of being the traitor who betrayed their regiment at Spinner\u2019s Falls.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSurely not!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do assure you.\u201d</p><p>Lady Vale sighed. \u201cGentlemen sometimes do not seem able to express themselves properly, and I must admit that my husband, though he loves to talk, is not always effective in communicating. He\u2019s never thought Lord Hope could be the traitor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Relief swept through her.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Lady Vale said with certainty. \u201cBut the problem is, if Lord Hope has gotten the notion that my husband distrusts him, it may be rather hard to dispel the thought.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, dear,\u201d Beatrice murmured. \u201cGentlemen can be so boneheaded sometimes, can\u2019t they? What if they can\u2019t work it out?\u201d</p><p>The other lady looked grave. \u201cThen I fear it may be the end of their long friendship.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Lord Hope needs a friend very much right now,\u201d Beatrice whispered.</p><p>\u201cBEWARE,\u201d REYNAUD GROWLED. \u201cI\u2019ve lived too long away from society. I no longer bother calling out a man who insults me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen have I insulted you?\u201d Vale hissed. \u201c\u2019Twas you who hit me, man!\u201d</p><p>They still stood almost in the middle of the damned ballroom, and if they talked too loud, they risked causing a scene. He was already the object of curious scrutiny. If he lost control here, in the midst of his aunt\u2019s ball, it would do irreparable harm to his cause.</p><p>Cold sweat slid down his back, but Reynaud still bared his teeth in a parody of a grin. \u201cI struck you because you had the damnable gall to accuse me of betraying our regiment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou most certainly did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did\u2014\u201d Vale cut himself off to breathe forcefully through his nostrils. \u201cWe sound like lads nearly come to blows over sweetmeats.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh,\u201d Reynaud grunted, looking away. He felt an unaccountable urge to shuffle his feet.</p><p>For a moment, both men stood silent, the chatter of the crowd rising around them.</p><p>Vale laughed under his breath. \u201cRemember when we stole those strawberry tarts from the cook at my father\u2019s house?\u201d</p><p>Reynaud raised an eyebrow. \u201cI do. We were caught and whipped.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich never would\u2019ve happened had you not decided we should hide in the dovecote.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNonsense.\u201d Reynaud\u2019s lips twitched. \u201cIt would\u2019ve been a perfect hiding place had you not laughed and scared all the doves, which gave away our position to those outside.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt least we gobbled the tarts before they discovered us.\u201d Vale sighed. \u201cI never meant to accuse you, Reynaud.\u201d</p><p>Reynaud nodded once, curtly. \u201cWhat did you mean to say, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWalk with me.\u201d</p><p>Reynaud raised an eyebrow at the order but fell into step with his boyhood friend without protest.</p><p>\u201cI hear there was an attempt on your life last week,\u201d Vale said in a low voice.</p><p>\u201cSomeone shot at me, certainly.\u201d Reynaud frowned. \u201cMiss Corning was in the line of fire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCareless.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFoolish,\u201d Reynaud corrected grimly. \u201cWhen I find him, I\u2019ll kill him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMiss Corning means so much to you?\u201d He felt Vale\u2019s curious glance.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d The knowledge solidified as he said it. Beatrice Corning did mean a lot to him\u2014how much he wasn\u2019t sure. But he knew he wanted to keep her close. Wanted to keep her safe.</p><p>\u201cIndeed?\u201d Vale said thoughtfully. \u201cAnd does the lady know this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that any of your business?\u201d</p><p>Vale coughed as if covering a laugh, and Reynaud turned to glare at him.</p><p>The viscount held up a conciliatory hand. \u201cI mean no offense, but the lady is exceedingly proper and you... well.\u201d</p><p>Reynaud frowned down at the floor. Vale was right. Miss Corning was all that was proper in an English lady. Everything, in fact, that he no longer was. Perhaps that was why his voice was sharp when he said, \u201cI\u2019ll let you know when I want your opinion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo doubt.\u201d Vale\u2019s voice was dry. \u201cAnd I look forward to the day, but in the meantime, we have other matters to discuss. Did you know Hasselthorpe was shot at last summer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I didn\u2019t.\u201d Reynaud glanced to the side of the room, where Lord Hasselthorpe stood with his usual cohorts. The Duke of Lister, Nathan Graham, and, of course, St. Aubyn the pretender were about him, all of them looking rather sour. \u201cYou think it\u2019s related?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Vale mused. \u201cHasselthorpe was winged in the arm\u2014not a grave wound as I understand. He seems to\u2019ve recovered entirely. He was riding in Hyde Park when he was shot. The shooter was never found. It does seem odd.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHasselthorpe has aspirations to be prime minister,\u201d Reynaud pointed out. \u201cIt may\u2019ve simply been a political assassination gone awry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course, of course,\u201d Vale murmured. \u201cBut I can\u2019t help noting that he was shot shortly after I tried talking to him about Spinner\u2019s Falls.\u201d</p><p>Reynaud halted and stared at Vale. \u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Vale glanced about the ballroom. \u201cI say, do you know where my lady wife and your Miss Corning have got to?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThey went into the portrait gallery.\u201d Reynaud nodded toward the hall leading off the ballroom. \u201cDo you think Hasselthorpe knows something about this business?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps.\u201d Vale started walking again, and Reynaud fell into step. \u201cOr perhaps someone else merely thinks he does. Or the thing isn\u2019t related at all and I\u2019m merely chasing unicorns.\u201d</p><p>Reynaud grunted. Vale might like to play the simpleton, but he\u2019d known the man since childhood and wasn\u2019t fooled. Vale was one of the most clever men he knew. \u201cI thought at first that the attempt on me must\u2019ve been Reginald St. Aubyn\u2019s doing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMiss Corning pointed out that he\u2019d have to be a half-wit to try and kill me on his own front step.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf the attempt against me is linked to the shooting of Lord Hasselthorpe, then it\u2019s got something to do with Spinner\u2019s Falls,\u201d Reynaud said thoughtfully. \u201cBut what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you know something,\u201d Vale said.</p><p>Reynaud stopped, eyeing the other man narrowly. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>Vale held up his palms. \u201cI\u2019m not accusing you. I just think you must have some information about the traitor that we haven\u2019t considered.\u201d</p><p>Reynaud frowned. \u201cI separated from you at the Indian camp and never saw you again until the other day. What could I possibly know that you don\u2019t?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Vale shrugged. \u201cBut I think we should meet with Munroe and pool our individual recollections.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMunroe survived the camp?\u201d Reynaud\u2019s eyebrows rose. He hadn\u2019t thought of the naturalist in years.</p><p>\u201cAye, but he\u2019s scarred.\u201d Vale looked away. \u201cHe lost an eye in that camp, Reynaud.\u201d</p><p>Reynaud grimaced. He knew well what fate befell Indian captives. Seven years of his life had been lost, and now it seemed it was all because someone\u2014one of their own\u2014had betrayed them at Spinner\u2019s Falls.</p><p>\u201cThen let\u2019s meet with Munroe and figure this thing out,\u201d he said with decision. \u201cLet\u2019s find the bastard and make sure he hangs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHE\u2019S SET A date to plead his case before the parliamentary committee.\u201d Lord Blanchard whispered the news as if the potted plant behind them might have ears.</p><p>Lister raised an eyebrow, looking bored as always as he surveyed the crowded ballroom. \u201cAre you surprised?\u201d</p><p>Blanchard\u2019s face reddened. \u201cYou needn\u2019t sound so unaffected. If St. Aubyn gets my title, your political career will be a toss-up as well.\u201d</p> <p>Lister shrugged, though his face had turned stony.</p><p>\u201cCome, gentlemen,\u201d Hasselthorpe said softly. \u201cFighting among ourselves does not serve our cause.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, then what does?\u201d Blanchard was looking sullen. \u201cNone of you have offered your support to me. I am alone\u2014even my niece has turned against me. Hope is courting her, the bastard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs he?\u201d Hasselthorpe turned to glance at Hope, who was walking with Vale about the perimeter of the ballroom. \u201cA clever stratagem. If he has a wife, he can dispel these rumors of insanity. A man always looks more settled with a wife by his side.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIndeed,\u201d Lister drawled. \u201cWouldn\u2019t you agree, Graham?\u201d</p><p>Nathan Graham blinked. He\u2019d been staring at his feet as if lost in thought. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI say, a wife makes the man\u2019s career,\u201d Lister said. \u201cDon\u2019t you agree?\u201d</p><p>Graham\u2019s handsome face flushed. There were rumors flying about the ballroom tonight that he\u2019d argued with his wife. He answered steadily enough, though. \u201cNaturally.\u201d</p><p>Lister\u2019s eyes narrowed as if he scented blood.</p><p>Hasselthorpe pursed his lips. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen an event filled with such luminaries of our society in quite some time.\u201d</p><p>Lister turned to him, a puzzled question in his eyes.</p><p>Hasselthorpe smiled. \u201cI confess, I admire Miss Molyneux\u2019s courage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Blanchard asked.</p><p>Hasselthorpe shrugged. \u201cOnly that if her nephew has an attack of madness in such a venue, all of society will see.\u201d</p><p>Young Graham was the first to understand. His face went blank as he darted a look at Lord Hope across the room.</p><p>Lister opened his mouth to say something, but he was interrupted by Adriana, who came fluttering over to land at Hasselthorpe\u2019s side. She wore a pale yellow and lavender gown and looked like nothing so much as a particularly frivolous butterfly.</p><p>\u201cDarling!\u201d she crowed. \u201cOh, do come leave your stuffy political discussions and dance with me. I\u2019m sure these gentlemen won\u2019t mind if you pay a tiny bit of attention to your wife.\u201d</p><p>And she batted her eyes at Lister, Blanchard, and Graham.</p><p>Lister, who\u2019d been eyeing the soft expanse of her exposed bosom, bowed. \u201cNot at all, ma\u2019am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere, you see! His Grace has given his kind permission.\u201d Adriana curtsied flirtatiously.</p><p>Hasselthorpe sighed. If he protested, Adriana would only cajole and flatter in ever more irritating ways until he was forced to give in or make a scene. \u201cVery well. If you\u2019ll excuse me, gentlemen?\u201d</p><p>The others bowed as his wife latched on to him and dragged him toward the dance floor.</p><p>\u201cI thought young Bankforth was squiring you about the dance tonight,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>She giggled, as gay as a girl in the schoolroom instead of a woman in her fortieth year. \u201cI wore him out, poor thing. Besides\u201d\u2014she maneuvered him into the proper position\u2014\u201cyou know how you love to dance!\u201d</p><p>Hasselthorpe sighed again. He loathed dancing, and he\u2019d told Adriana so on many an occasion. For some reason, she chose to think he was teasing when he protested. Or perhaps her brain was too small to keep track of the information for any length of time.</p><p>Hasselthorpe looked over his wife\u2019s head as he waited for the music to start and saw Blanchard staring daggers across the room. It wasn\u2019t hard to find the object of his gaze\u2014Lord Hope was making his way to Miss Corning, who sat in a corner with Mrs. Graham. He looked back at Blanchard. If looks could kill, Lord Hope would be lying bleeding on the floor. Interesting. It seemed Blanchard\u2019s hatred of Hope was personal.</p><p>It made one wonder what such an intense animosity would drive a man to do.</p><p>\u201cNOW TELL ME,\u201d Beatrice said a little later. \u201cWhat\u2019s so urgent that you needs must pull me away from Lady Vale?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wanted you to hear it from me,\u201d Lottie said solemnly. They sat together at the side of the ballroom on a gold silk settee. A statue of a Greek god to one side and a potted plant to the other gave them a measure of privacy.</p><p>\u201cYour manner is terribly secretive,\u201d Beatrice said. Her eyes drifted to her friend\u2019s belly. Could it be...?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve left Nathan.\u201d</p><p>Beatrice\u2019s gaze snapped up. \u201cBut why?\u201d She stared at Lottie in bewildered concern. \u201cI thought you loved Mr. Graham.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do,\u201d Lottie said. \u201cOf course I do. But that just makes it so much worse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t see how.\u201d</p><p>Lottie sighed, and for the first time, Beatrice saw that her friend was truly weary. There were faint mauve half circles beneath her eyes, and she squeezed her hands together as if to control a tremor. \u201cI love him, and I think he still loves me, but he no longer cares. I... I\u2019m a thing to him, Bea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure I understand what you mean, dear. Can you explain it to me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh!\u201d Lottie lifted her hands from her lap and balled them into fists. \u201cOh, it\u2019s so very difficult to articulate.\u201d</p><p>Beatrice placed her hand around one of Lottie\u2019s fists. \u201cI\u2019m listening.\u201d</p><p>Lottie inhaled and closed her eyes. \u201cIt\u2019s as if I\u2019m one of the things he owns or possesses. He has a carriage, he has a butler, he has a town house, and he has a wife. I fill a position, as it were, and he might love me, somewhere deep underneath his everyday exterior, but I could be anyone, Bea.\u201d She opened her eyes and stared at her friend with something very like despair. \u201cI could be Regina Rockford or Pamela Thistlewaite or that girl who married the Italian count.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMeredith Brightwell,\u201d Beatrice murmured. She\u2019d always had a better memory for names than Lottie.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Lottie said. \u201cAny of them. I fulfill a... a space in his life, nothing more. If I died, he\u2019d mourn and then go out and find another to fill that space again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSurely not,\u201d Beatrice murmured, not a little shocked. Was this truly what marriage was like? Did the love and compliments and courting really not last?</p><p>\u201cBelieve me, it\u2019s all true.\u201d Lottie wiped her eyes with one wrist. \u201cI couldn\u2019t take that anymore. I may be naive, but I want to be loved\u2014loved for myself, not the position I hold\u2014so I left.\u201d</p><p>Beatrice swallowed, looking down at her hand still clasped with Lottie\u2019s. \u201cWhere are you staying?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt Papa\u2019s house,\u201d Lottie said. \u201cHe isn\u2019t pleased, and Mama\u2019s worried about the scandal, but they\u2019ll let me stay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut . . .\u201d Beatrice frowned. \u201cWhat will you do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Lottie laughed, but the sound caught and she quieted. \u201cPerhaps I\u2019ll be scandalous and take a lover.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t look particularly excited at the thought.</p><p>Beatrice glanced across the ballroom. A minuet had started, and couples were pacing gracefully on the dance floor. She could see Lord Hope making his way toward them, and her heart gave a kind of skip in her chest. And beyond him, suddenly clear, was Mr. Graham\u2014Nate\u2014staring rather wistfully at them.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps you can try talking to him.\u201d Even as she said it, she knew the suggestion was hopelessly inadequate.</p><p>Lottie smiled wearily. \u201cI\u2019ve tried. It hasn\u2019t worked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Beatrice said helplessly. \u201cI am so sorry.\u201d</p><p>She sat with Lottie, saying nothing and watching as Lord Hope approached them. She felt guilty because even knowing that Lottie\u2019s whole life was in turmoil and that her friend was deeply hurt, she still rejoiced at the sight of him. Lord Hope looked so strong, stood so straight. He was still too thin, but his face had begun to fill out a bit, his cheeks and eyes no longer so hollow. He was handsome in a daunting sort of way, even with the grim expression he habitually wore, and she couldn\u2019t help the gladness she felt at the sight of him.</p><p>He continued cleaving relentlessly through the crowd until he stood before them. He bowed. \u201cLadies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy lord,\u201d Beatrice said rather breathlessly.</p><p>He glanced at the dancers. \u201cThis dance is ending soon, I think. Might I have the honor of the next one, Miss Corning?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI... I\u2019m flattered, of course.\u201d Beatrice bit her lip. \u201cBut I really think not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo ahead, Bea.\u201d Lottie had straightened with Lord Hope\u2019s approach, and now she smiled widely. \u201cReally. I do so wish to see you dance.\u201d</p><p>Beatrice turned to look in her friend\u2019s eyes. Sorrow still lurked there, though Lottie was determined to appear as if nothing were wrong. \u201cYou\u2019re sure?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Lottie nodded firmly. \u201cYes, certainly.\u201d</p><p>Beatrice held out her hand, and Lord Hope took it. He glanced at Lottie and said with a crooked smile, \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>Then he was leading Beatrice through the crowd, his shoulders wide and strong beside her. They came to the dance floor and paused as the music ended with a flourish. The dancers curtsied and bowed to their partners and then drifted from the dance floor. Beatrice and Lord Hope took their positions, waiting patiently for the music to begin again. She snuck a look at him, standing beside her. He seemed preoccupied.</p><p>She cleared her throat. \u201cDid your discussion with Lord Vale go well?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes.\u201d The music began and the figures of the dance took them away from each other a moment. Lord Hope was frowning fiercely when they drew near again. \u201cWhy do you ask?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe is your friend,\u201d she replied, and then said, lower, \u201cI worry about you.\u201d</p><p>They paced away. A gentleman nearby tripped and jostled against Lord Hope. He froze and glared at the man but then seemed to recover himself.</p><p>When they came together again, she whispered, \u201cAre you feeling well?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d he snapped, a little too loud.</p> <p>Heads turned.</p><p>He paced about her as she stood, and even though it was part of the dance, she felt as if a great predator prowled around her.</p><p>Then something awful happened.</p><p>The same man who had jostled Lord Hope before tripped and bumped into him again, this time much harder, shoving Lord Hope a step. Lord Hope whirled on the man, drawing out his huge knife from under his coat. The dancers nearby stumbled to a halt. A woman screamed.</p><p>The man turned white, backing up with his hands raised. \u201cI... I say, I\u2019m dreadfully sorry!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean by it?\u201d Lord Hope demanded. \u201cYou deliberately ran into me.\u201d</p> <p>Beatrice started forward. \u201cMy lord\u2014\u201d</p><p>But Lord Hope grabbed the other man by the neck. \u201cAnswer me!\u201d</p><p>Dear God, had he gone mad again? Gentlemen were shoving their ladies behind them, and the crowd was backing away, leaving a wide cleared space in the middle of the dance floor.</p><p>\u201cReynaud,\u201d Beatrice said softly. She touched the arm that held his raised knife. \u201cReynaud, let the man go.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d paused at the sound of his name on her lips, and now he turned his head, his black eyes blank and frightening.</p><p>Beatrice swallowed and whispered, \u201cReynaud, please.\u201d</p><p>Lord Hope let the man go so abruptly he staggered.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re leaving.\u201d With his free hand, Lord Hope grabbed Beatrice\u2019s arm and began towing her through the crowd. He still gripped the bare knife in his other hand.</p> <p>And as they went, the mass of people parted before them, some half falling in their haste to get away from Lord Hope. On every face they passed, Beatrice saw the same expression.</p><p>Fear.</p><p>Chapter Eight</p><p>Longsword raised his mighty sword. The dragon roared again and blew searing flames at him. But Longsword had lived seven long years in the kingdom of the goblins, and fire was no longer a thing he feared. He jumped through the blast and swung his sword hard, driving it between the dragon\u2019s eyes. The great beast staggered and fell dead, but as it did so, it dropped the most beautiful lady in the world. Longsword saw that the lady would be smashed on the rocks beneath her, and he ran to catch her in his strong arms.</p><p>The lady clutched at his broad shoulders and looked at him with eyes the color of the sea. \u201cYou have saved my life, kind knight, and for this I give you my gratitude. But if you will save the life of my father the king, I will give you my hand in marriage. . . .\u201d</p><p>\u2014from Longsword</p><p>Beatrice rose early the next morning, summoning her maid and dressing quickly in a simple blue and white striped gown. She breakfasted by herself\u2014both Uncle Reggie and Lord Hope appeared to be still abed\u2014and then on impulse she asked for the carriage. It was much too early to be making social calls, but she knew that Jeremy often had trouble sleeping, and he liked to have company when he was awake in the morning. And besides, she needed to talk to someone about the events of the night before.</p><p>So it was that a half hour later, after arguing her way past the odious Putley, Beatrice was pouring tea for Jeremy and herself.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you wear?\u201d he asked as she carefully placed the teacup in his hands. She\u2019d filled it only partially full\u2014he was sitting against two pillows, but his fingers trembled, and she was worried he might spill the hot tea on himself.</p><p>\u201cMy bronze,\u201d she replied, stirring rich cream into her cup. \u201cRemember, I showed you the pattern and a swatch of the material last summer before I had it made?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe silk that had a kind of iridescence?\u201d At her nod he smiled. \u201cReminded me of the way brandy sparkles in a glass when you hold it to the light.\u201d He sipped his tea and laid his head back against the pillows, his eyes closed. \u201cYou must\u2019ve been beautiful.\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cI think I looked quite well.\u201d</p><p>He cracked one eye. \u201cAs modest as ever. What did Lord Hope think?\u201d</p><p>She looked down at her cup, too self-conscious to meet his knowing gaze. \u201cHe said the gown became me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot an overly eloquent man, then,\u201d Jeremy said drily.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps not, but I liked the compliment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d</p><p>She set her cup carefully back on the saucer in her lap. \u201cThere was a bit of a... a scene at the ball.\u201d</p><p>Jeremy straightened. \u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>Beatrice wrinkled her nose, still looking at her cup of tea. \u201cA gentleman bumped into Lord Hope on the dance floor and he reacted badly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho was Lord Hope dancing with?\u201d</p><p>She huffed out a sigh. \u201cMe, if you must know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I must,\u201d Jeremy said with delight. \u201cAnd what exactly do you mean by badly?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe took out his knife\u2014he always carries a very long knife with him\u2014and he, um, waved it about, I\u2019m afraid. While holding the other gentleman\u2019s throat.\u201d Beatrice squeezed her eyes shut at the memory.</p><p>There was a pause, and then Jeremy said, \u201cOh, I wish I\u2019d been there.\u201d</p><p>Beatrice\u2019s eyes flew open. \u201cJeremy!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I do,\u201d he said without a trace of remorse. \u201cSounds like a jolly good to-do. And did Lord Hope get thrown out of the ballroom?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was his aunt\u2019s ball,\u201d Beatrice reminded him. \u201cSo I don\u2019t think he would\u2019ve actually been ejected from the house, but it doesn\u2019t matter much since we left after that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, he took you with him, did he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe did.\u201d She hesitated, then said in a low voice, \u201cHe didn\u2019t speak at all the entire way home. You should have seen the way everyone stared at him, Jeremy. As if Lord Hope was a dangerous beast.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs he?\u201d Jeremy asked quietly. \u201cDangerous, I mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She shook her head and then admitted, \u201cWell, not dangerous to me, I think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure, Bea?\u201d</p><p>She bit her lip, looking at Jeremy helplessly. \u201cHe wouldn\u2019t hurt me. Truly he wouldn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope not, Beatrice, dear.\u201d Jeremy laid his head back against his pillow, looking tired. \u201cI would hate for him to hurt you in any way.\u201d</p><p>There was a question in Jeremy\u2019s voice. She could feel his eyes on her as she sipped her tea, but she didn\u2019t want to share this, not even with Jeremy. Her emotions were something special, something soft within her, too delicate for the light of day.</p><p>She got up and took his empty teacup from his hands, setting it aside when he indicated he wanted no more. When she sat back down again, she said, \u201cLottie told me last night that she\u2019d left Mr. Graham.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably a lover\u2019s spat. She\u2019ll be back within the week, mark my words.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so,\u201d Beatrice said slowly. \u201cShe seemed subdued somehow, not at all her usual cheerful self.\u201d</p><p>She glanced up to see Jeremy\u2019s eyes closed, his face drawn. She set down her cup to rise, but as if he knew she was looking, he opened his eyes.</p><p>He blinked and frowned. \u201cI hadn\u2019t thought Nate Graham such a bad sort. Has he taken a mistress and flaunted her?\u201d</p><p>Beatrice hesitated but then decided to play along and pretend she hadn\u2019t seen that moment of weakness. \u201cLottie didn\u2019t say there was another woman. I don\u2019t think there is one, actually. She said Mr. Graham took her for granted, that any lady would do as well as her for his wife. I confess I\u2019m . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cDisillusioned?\u201d Jeremy asked softly.</p><p>She nodded, mute.</p><p>\u201cMen can be very disillusioning, I\u2019m afraid,\u201d Jeremy said. \u201cWe\u2019re but things of clay, bumbling about, stumbling over the feelings of those dearest to us. That is why we rely so heavily on the compassion of you ladies, for if you ever lost your pity, took offense, and abandoned us en masse, we would be quite lost, you know.\u201d</p><p>Beatrice smiled at his play. \u201cYou\u2019re not like that, dear Jeremy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, but we both know I am not much like other men, either, dear Bea,\u201d he retorted lightly. Before she could reply, he continued. \u201cHave you discussed the veteran\u2019s bill with Lord Hope?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I started to,\u201d she said slowly.</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cHe\u2019s intent on regaining the title and cannot consider other matters at the moment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d Jeremy looked down at his teacup, frowning.</p><p>Beatrice hurried to say, \u201cHe did speak highly of his men\u2014the soldiers he led in battle\u2014and that makes me a little optimistic that he might be sympathetic to our cause. The problem is convincing him to act, I think. I still haven\u2019t figured out how exactly to do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe sounds rather selfish,\u201d Jeremy murmured.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think he is,\u201d Beatrice said slowly. \u201cNot truly. It\u2019s just that he\u2019s so focused on regaining what he\u2019s lost, there doesn\u2019t seem to be room for anything else right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm. I think we all try to get back the life that we\u2019ve left behind when we return home, we old soldiers.\u201d Jeremy\u2019s voice was growing weaker. \u201cThe problem is, some things can\u2019t be regained once lost. I wonder if he\u2019s realized that yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn any case, you should speak to him soon. The bill will come up before parliament within the next month. Our time is growing short\u2014so short.\u201d Jeremy closed his eyes again as he leaned against the pillows.</p><p>She bit her lip. \u201cYou\u2019re tired. I should go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, don\u2019t.\u201d He opened his eyes, so blue and clear against the white of his pillow. \u201cI adore your company, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Jeremy,\u201d she said, touched enough that her throat swelled. \u201cI\u2014\u201d</p><p>Something thumped loudly in the downstairs hall.</p><p>She looked at the bedroom\u2019s shut door. \u201cWhat\u2014?\u201d</p><p>Shouting came from below, advancing closer as a male voice bellowed, \u201cI\u2019ll see her, damn your eyes! Get out of my way!\u201d</p><p>It sounded very like Lord Hope. Beatrice half rose from her chair. \u201cI can\u2019t believe he would\u2014\u201d</p><p>The voices were rapidly advancing closer. If she didn\u2019t do something, he was going to burst into the room. Beatrice ran out into the hallway, closing Jeremy\u2019s bedroom door firmly behind her. Coming up the stairs, looking like a charging bull, Lord Hope\u2019s face was grim. Putley trailed him, several steps behind, his wig lost, his face frightened as he pleaded with the viscount.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think you\u2019re doing?\u201d she demanded.</p><p>\u201cDiscovering your lover,\u201d he growled as he strode toward her.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have a lover!\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He stepped to the side to go around her to the door, and she mirrored his movement.</p><p>\u201cGo home!\u201d she hissed. \u201cYou\u2019re making a frightful ass out of yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrought it on yourself, miss,\u201d Putley crowed somewhere behind Lord Hope.</p><p>\u201cDo shut up, Putley!\u201d Beatrice cried, and then squeaked because Lord Hope had eliminated her barrier by simply picking her up and moving her to the side. \u201cOh, don\u2019t!\u201d</p> <p>But it was too late. He\u2019d opened the door, barged into the room, and then stopped dead, blocking her view.</p><p>She heard a breathless laugh from Jeremy. \u201cLord Hope, I presume?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGoddamn,\u201d the viscount said.</p><p>\u201cOh, get out of the way!\u201d Beatrice shoved hard at his great big stupid back.</p><p>He moved obligingly to the side.</p> <p>She hurried past him. \u201cJeremy, are you all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cQuite all right,\u201d he said, his color high and hectic. \u201cHaven\u2019t had this much excitement in years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd it isn\u2019t good for you.\u201d She took his hand and turned to glare at Lord Hope, still standing by the door. The man didn\u2019t even have the grace to look embarrassed. \u201cWhat do you think you\u2019re doing here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you\u201d\u2014he casually kicked the door closed behind him\u2014\u201cdiscovering you in a lover\u2019s nest. It seems I might be mistaken.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMight be?\u201d She balled her free hand and set it on her hip. \u201cYou\u2019ve been a complete and utter idiot and have insulted both me and Jeremy. Obviously we aren\u2019t lovers\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing obvious about it,\u201d he growled, eyeing the remains of Jeremy\u2019s legs beneath the covers. \u201cI\u2019ve known men who\u2019ve lost their legs but not their\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t be disgusting!\u201d She was shouting now, but it was completely out of her control. How dare he? What kind of woman did he think her? He\u2019d humiliated her!</p><p>Behind her, Jeremy was making choking sounds, and she turned swiftly, alarmed.</p><p>He was trying to hold back big belly laughs and not succeeding very well.</p><p>\u201cOh, not you, too,\u201d she said, thoroughly exasperated, even as she poured him a glass of water.</p><p>\u201cThank you, dear,\u201d Jeremy said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m sorry. At this moment, I feel that I should apologize for my entire sex.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should,\u201d she grumbled. \u201cYou\u2019re rotten to the core, all of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I know,\u201d he said humbly. \u201cYou\u2019re simply a saint to put up with us at all. But I have a boon to ask of you, dearest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d she asked, not very graciously.</p> <p>\u201cWould you mind terribly going and seeing to Putley\u2019s ruffled feathers? I know it\u2019s a tiresome chore, but I\u2019d rather not have him tattling to my parents about this matter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, all right.\u201d She glared at Lord Hope. \u201cBut I\u2019ll have to leave you here with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d Jeremy adopted an angelic expression that didn\u2019t fool her for a moment. \u201cI\u2019d rather hoped to have a chat with the viscount.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHumph,\u201d she said. She stepped up to Lord Hope until they were nearly chin to chin\u2014although she had to tilt hers quite far up\u2014and poked him in the chest with her forefinger.</p><p>\u201cOw,\u201d said Lord Hope.</p><p>\u201cIf you lay a single finger on him,\u201d she hissed into his face, \u201cor overexcite him in any way, I\u2019ll tear that silly earring right out of your ear.\u201d</p><p>Behind her, Jeremy went into peals of laughter, but she didn\u2019t bother glancing at him again. She slammed the door behind her and stomped off in search of Putley.</p><p>Men!</p><p>REYNAUD RUBBED THE spot where Miss Corning had attempted to drill her forefinger through his breastbone. \u201cI apologize.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2019Tisn\u2019t me who needs the apology,\u201d the man in the bed said, still laughing. \u201cI\u2019ll give you a hint\u2014her favorite flowers are lily of the valley.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre they?\u201d Reynaud eyed the door speculatively. He hadn\u2019t brought a woman flowers in eons, but the situation might very well call for the formal English method of suing for peace from a lady. At the moment, though, he had other matters to settle. He turned back to the man in the bed. \u201cBattle wounds?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBlown off by cannon fire at Emsdorf on the Continent,\u201d Oates said. His color was unnaturally high, as if he was feverish. \u201cBack in sixty.\u201d</p><p>Reynaud nodded. He strolled to the table littered with medicine bottles of all shapes and sizes. There wasn\u2019t a medicine in the world that could put a man\u2019s legs back on once lost. \u201cDid she tell you I was with the Twenty-eighth Regiment of Foot in the Colonies?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe did.\u201d He laid his head back against the pillow as if exhausted. \u201cI was in the Fifteenth Light Dragoons. Much more dashing than a foot soldier\u2014until, of course, one gets shot off one\u2019s horse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBattle is never as romantic as one thinks,\u201d Reynaud said.</p><p>He remembered well his boyish romanticism of the army. It had died fast on the reality of rotten food, incompetent officers, and boredom. His first skirmish had destroyed what little illusion still survived.</p><p>\u201cOur regiment was newly formed,\u201d Oates said, \u201cand we hadn\u2019t yet seen action. Many of the men were London tailors who\u2019d been on strike and had to join. We never stood a chance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were defeated there?\u201d</p><p>Oates smiled bitterly. \u201cOh, no. We won the day. One hundred and twenty-five men killed in my regiment alone, over a hundred horses dead, but we won the battle. I went down in our second charge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>Oates shrugged. \u201cYou know as well as I the wages of war\u2014perhaps more so than I.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t debate the matter. I came for something else entirely.\u201d Reynaud sat in the chair that was beside the bed. \u201cWhat are you to her?\u201d</p><p>The other man arched his brows as if amused. \u201cI\u2019m Jeremy Oates, by the way.\u201d</p><p>There was nothing for it but to stick out his hand. \u201cReynaud St. Aubyn.\u201d</p><p>Oates took his hand and shook it, looking in his eyes as if searching for something. His fingers were as thin as twigs. \u201cPleased to meet you.\u201d The odd thing was he sounded sincere.</p><p>Reynaud took back his hand. \u201cMy question?\u201d</p><p>Oates half smiled, his eyes closing as he lay against the pillows. \u201cChildhood friends. I played hide-and-seek with her in my family\u2019s sitting room, helped her with her geography lessons, escorted her to her first ball.\u201d</p><p>Reynaud felt a jolt somewhere in the region of his breastbone at the other man\u2019s words. Perhaps it was the lingering aftereffects of that sharp poke, but he rather thought it might be jealousy instead.</p><p>Jealousy. He\u2019d never felt the emotion before.</p><p>True, he\u2019d been enraged this morning to learn that Miss Corning had already left to visit her mysterious beau. He\u2019d come here at once with the intent to confront them and thrash the other man if necessary, but he hadn\u2019t stopped to examine his emotions. Mine, his instinct had said, and so he\u2019d acted on it without thought. The realization now that his reaction was emotional was an unwelcome shock.</p><p>\u201cDo you love her?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Oates said simply. \u201cWith all my heart. But not, I believe, in the way you mean.\u201d</p><p>Reynaud shifted in the chair, uncomfortable with his need to know exactly what the other man meant. \u201cExplain.\u201d</p><p>Oates smiled and Reynaud saw that he\u2019d once been a handsome man before illness had carved lines of suffering into his face. \u201cBeatrice is dearer than any blood sister could ever be to me.\u201d</p><p>Reynaud narrowed his eyes. The man might say his relationship with Miss Corning was fraternal, but she wasn\u2019t in fact related. How, then, could their friendship be as innocent as he claimed?</p><p>\u201cSo you wouldn\u2019t have married her even if that hadn\u2019t happened.\u201d He jerked his chin at the other man\u2019s missing legs.</p><p>Most would have taken offense, but Oates merely grinned. \u201cNo. Although Beatrice has brought up the idea of marriage to me more than once.\u201d</p><p>That was an unpleasant jolt. Reynaud straightened. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>And Oates\u2019s grin widened, making him realize he\u2019d risen to the bait.</p><p>\u201cWhat game are you playing?\u201d Reynaud growled.</p><p>\u201cA game of life and death and love and hate,\u201d Oates replied softly.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re babbling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d The grin abruptly vanished. \u201cI\u2019m completely serious. You\u2019ll take care of her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Reynaud frowned. Sometimes invalids became confused from the pain and the drugs they took to mask it. Was Oates floating in some drug-induced haze?</p><p>\u201cPromise you\u2019ll take care of her,\u201d the other man said, and although his voice was weak, his tone held the ghost of a good officer\u2019s command. \u201cBeatrice is a special woman, someone to be cherished for herself. She wears a mask of practicality, but underneath she\u2019s a romantic and prone to heartbreak. Don\u2019t break her heart. I won\u2019t ask if you love her\u2014I doubt you know yourself\u2014but promise me you\u2019ll take care of her. See to it she\u2019s happy every day of her life. Lay down your own life for her if need be. Promise.\u201d</p><p>And suddenly Reynaud understood. His emotions had blinded him to the reality that lay in front of him. He\u2019d seen this look in other men\u2019s eyes before, and he knew damned well what it meant.</p><p>So he said simply and sincerely, \u201cI swear on everything I hold dear that I\u2019ll take care of her, keep her safe, and do my damnedest to make her happy.\u201d</p><p>Oates nodded. \u201cI can ask for nothing more. Thank you.\u201d</p><p>HOW DARE HE?</p><p>Beatrice opened the front door of Jeremy\u2019s town house and went outside for a badly needed breath of fresh air. She\u2019d already browbeaten Putley into keeping quiet about Lord Hope\u2019s violent invasion of the house, but she was still dealing with her own reaction to his suspicions. And what terrible suspicions they were! Insulting both to Jeremy and herself. When had she ever given him cause to think her a wanton? And how he thought he could just barge in and dictate to her, she did not know.</p><p>Beatrice stamped her feet, both to keep warm and to emphasize her own anger.</p><p>There were three men loitering in the street below\u2014two scrawny fellows in ragged brown coats and a taller man in black. The taller man turned to look at the sound of her stamping. His right eye rolled to the corner of the socket, revealing rather horribly the white membrane of the eyeball. She glanced quickly away from the poor man. She should go back inside, but she was still angry. She wanted to be composed when next she saw Lord Hope\u2014the better to tell him exactly what she thought of him.</p><p>A brewer\u2019s cart went by, rattling on the cobblestones, and one of the loitering men shouted something to the driver.</p><p>Behind her, the door opened so quickly she almost fell back in the house. Instead, strong hands caught her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been looking all over the house for you,\u201d Lord Hope said. \u201cWhat are you doing out here?\u201d</p><p>She tried to pull away, but he held fast to her upper arms. \u201cI wanted some air.\u201d</p><p>He looked down at her disbelievingly, and she couldn\u2019t help but notice how thickly his eyelashes rimmed his black eyes.</p><p>\u201cIn the cold?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI find it very refreshing,\u201d she said, pulling at her arms again. \u201cMight I have my person back?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he muttered, turning to guide her down the steps, his hand still gripping one of her arms.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d she demanded.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not letting you go,\u201d he said. \u201cEver.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not funny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not meant to be,\u201d he said maddeningly as they came to the street. \u201cWhere\u2019s the damned carriage?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAround the corner; there\u2019s no room for it to stop here. Are you bamming me about not letting me go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t make jokes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the silliest thing I\u2019ve ever heard,\u201d she said, rather too loudly. \u201cEveryone makes jokes, even people with no sense of humor like you.\u201d</p><p>He yanked the arm he still held, making her bump into his chest. Hard.</p> <p>\u201cI assure you,\u201d he snarled into her face, \u201cthat\u2014\u201d</p><p>But something odd happened then. She felt a shove from behind her, a sharp hit at her side. Lord Hope\u2019s hands tightened painfully on her arms, and she saw that he was glaring murderously over her shoulder.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2014?\u201d she began.</p><p>But he pushed her back and behind him, toward the house\u2019s steps as he took his big knife out from under his coat. \u201cGet inside!\u201d</p><p>And she saw, horribly, that the three loitering men were advancing on him. Their leader\u2014the man with the walleye\u2014had a knife in his hand, and there was blood on the blade.</p> <p>Beatrice screamed.</p><p>\u201cGet inside!\u201d Lord Hope shouted again, and launched himself at the leader.</p><p>The big man lifted his bloody knife to strike the viscount. But Lord Hope caught his wrist, halting the blow, even as he slashed at the man\u2019s belly. The leader sucked in his belly and skipped back, his shirt and waistcoat in ribbons. A second man, hatless and balding, wrapped his arms about Lord Hope from behind, imprisoning his upper arms. The walleyed man grinned and advanced to strike again. The viscount grunted and wrenched his left arm free just in time, blocking the knife with his arm. The knife blade sliced through his sleeve, and blood sprayed in a thin arc across the street.</p><p>Beatrice covered her mouth and sat suddenly on the town-house steps. Black dots swam in front of her eyes.</p><p>A man screamed and she looked up.</p><p>The balding man had fallen to the ground and was clutching his bloody side. Lord Hope was grappling with the leader again while the third man raised his dagger behind the viscount\u2019s back.</p> <p>Beatrice tried to scream a warning but couldn\u2019t. It was as if she were in a nightmare. Her throat worked, but no sound came. She could only stare in horror.</p><p>The knife descended, but the leader stumbled back under Lord Hope\u2019s ferocious attack, bringing the viscount with him, and the knife missed. Lord Hope suddenly whirled, dragging the leader with him, and shoved the man into the attacker behind him. Both men fell to the ground in a tangle of legs and arms. The leader was bleeding from a terrible cut to his head, and his ear appeared to be dangling.</p><p>Lord Hope straightened and advanced on the fallen men with an intent, deadly stride, like a wolf sighting a wounded hare. He wore a warlike grin as he came, savage and gleeful. His great knife was raised, its blade bloody now, too. His bared teeth were white against his swarthy skin. The men on the ground looked more civilized than he.</p><p>And then as suddenly as it\u2019d begun, it was over. The walleyed man and his cohort scrambled to their feet, caught the third man with the bleeding side under his arms, and ducked across the street, nearly under the noses of a team of horses pulling a heavy cart. The driver yelled abuse. Lord Hope took one running step as if tempted to give chase, but then he stopped himself. He sheathed his knife with a disgusted look.</p><p>He turned to her, his expression still savage, but all Beatrice could see was his left hand, dripping blood to the ground.</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you go in the house?\u201d he demanded.</p><p>She looked up dazedly. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI gave you an order. Why the hell didn\u2019t you follow it?\u201d</p> <p>His wound was all she could think about. She raised her own right hand to catch his. But something was wrong. Her hand was already bloody.</p><p>\u201cBeatrice!\u201d</p><p>She frowned at her hand, confused. \u201cOh, blood.\u201d</p><p>And then the world did a dizzying spin, and she knew no more.</p><p>Chapter Nine</p><p>\u201cI am the Princess Serenity,\u201d the lady said as Longsword set her on her feet. \u201cMy father is the king of this land, but there is an evil witch who lives in the mountains near here. The witch told my father that if he did not pay her a yearly tribute, she would destroy him and this kingdom. My father paid the tribute last year, but this year he refused. The witch sent that dragon to steal my father and bring him to her. When I rode out with a party of knights to rescue my father, the dragon came and killed all save myself.\u201d</p><p>Princess Serenity laid a small white hand on Longsword\u2019s arm. \u201cThe witch will kill my father on the morrow if I do not rescue him. Will you help me?\u201d</p><p>Longsword looked at the dead dragon, at the white hand on his sleeve, and into Princess Serenity\u2019s sea-blue eyes, but he had decided on his answer before she had ever spoken. \u201cI will help you. . . .\u201d</p><p>\u2014from Longsword</p><p>\u201cBeatrice!\u201d Reynaud yelled again, though he knew she couldn\u2019t hear.</p><p>She\u2019d fainted, slumping to her left side on the steps. A palm-sized bloodstain on her right side and back was revealed, and the sight filled him with irrational terror. He\u2019d seen far more blood in battle\u2014had seen horrific wounds, men without arms or legs, bodies blown apart\u2014and not lost his composure. Yet his hands shook as he reached for her. She was as light as a child as he lifted her in his arms. He felt the wet fabric against his fingers; the blood was soaked into her skirts as well, and for a moment he froze, afraid she was dying. Her brown eyes stared up through a mask of blood, dull and lifeless. He was too late.</p><p>No. No, this woman could not die. He would not allow it.</p><p>He gripped her against his chest and turned to where she\u2019d said the carriage was waiting. He didn\u2019t trust this area; the attackers, whoever they were, knew he\u2019d be here. He needed to get her away. Needed to get her to his own home. There he could guard her and tend to her, and she would be safe. He sprinted past houses, his heart thumping in his chest. She moaned and clutched his waistcoat but did not open her eyes.</p><p>There! He saw the Blanchard carriage as he turned the corner and ran toward it, yelling an order to the coachman. He saw the man\u2019s wide eyes, the footman\u2019s startled face, and leaped into the carriage without waiting for the steps.</p><p>\u201cGo!\u201d he bellowed, and the carriage lurched into motion, the coachman swearing at the horses.</p><p>He held her across his lap and looked into her face. It was flour-white, so pale that tiny freckles he\u2019d never noticed before stood out on her cheeks. Oh, God, he would not let this happen. He brushed a lock of hair from her eyes, but his hand was bloody, and he only smeared crimson across her temple. Dammit. He needed to see how bad the wound was.</p><p>Reynaud reached under his coat and drew out his knife. The carriage swayed as they rounded a corner, and he braced himself with feet and elbows. Carefully he sliced through gown, stays, and chemise, from low on her hip to the top of the bodice, both in back and in front. He pulled the fabric away and saw the wound. It was a two-inch cut at her side just to her back, raw and ugly against the expanse of her smooth pale skin. The assassins had been aiming for him and had caught her instead as he held her in front of himself, an inadvertent shield. Fresh blood flowed clear and bright red from the wound. The fabric had stuck, and he\u2019d reopened the wound when he\u2019d pulled it away.</p><p>He swore softly and cut a swath from her underskirts, wadding it and pressing it against the wound. He wrapped his other arm about her shoulders and held her close to himself, her head under his chin. She was so soft, so small in his arms, and he could feel the blood soaking the wadded bandage, wetting his fingers.</p><p>\u201cCome on,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>Outside, houses and shops flashed by. They were making good time, but they still weren\u2019t at his town house yet. The coachman shouted something, and the entire carriage lurched heavily. Reynaud slid across the seat, crashing into the coach\u2019s side painfully, trying to cushion the movement with his body.</p><p>Beatrice moaned.</p><p>\u201cDammit. Dammit. Dammit.\u201d He stroked her fair hair back with the hand that held her and pressed his open mouth against her forehead, whispering, \u201cHold on. Just hold on.\u201d</p><p>The carriage halted, and he was standing with Beatrice in his arms before the footman had the door all the way open.</p><p>\u201cTurn your back!\u201d he snapped to the gawking man.</p><p>Reynaud climbed from the carriage, conscious that Beatrice was almost nude to the waist. He leaped up the town-house stairs just as the butler opened the door.</p><p>\u201cSend for a doctor,\u201d he told the gaping butler. \u201cAnd I\u2019ll need hot water and cloths in Miss Corning\u2019s room at once.\u201d</p><p>He started up the stairs but was blocked by St. Aubyn coming down.</p><p>\u201cBeatrice!\u201d The older man\u2019s naturally red face paled. \u201cWhat have you done to my niece?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was stabbed,\u201d Reynaud replied curtly. Only the concern in the other man\u2019s voice kept him from knocking him aside. \u201cNot by me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDear God!\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me pass.\u201d</p><p>St. Aubyn fell back, and Reynaud surged past him, mounting the steps as quickly as possible. Beatrice\u2019s bedroom was two floors above. He could hear her uncle panting behind him. By the time he reached her room, the door was open and her maid was turning back the bed.</p><p>\u201cLord have mercy,\u201d the woman murmured. She was a capable-looking sort, short, red-haired, and sturdy.</p><p>\u201cYour mistress has been stabbed,\u201d Reynaud said to her. \u201cHelp me get her gown off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow, see here!\u201d St. Aubyn sputtered from the door. \u201cYou can\u2019t do that!\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s bleeding,\u201d Reynaud said, low and intense. \u201cI can hold the bandage as the maid works. Or would you rather preserve your niece\u2019s modesty and let her bleed to death?\u201d</p><p>St. Aubyn gulped but said nothing, his eyes fixed on Beatrice\u2019s face.</p><p>Reynaud nodded at the maid, and St. Aubyn turned away with a mutter and closed the door as she began pulling Beatrice\u2019s gown off. A gentleman would\u2019ve averted his eyes, but Reynaud hadn\u2019t been a gentleman for some time now. He watched as the maid undressed Beatrice. Her breasts were high and round, the nipples a pretty pink. The maid pulled the gown from her legs, and he stared with possession at her feminine triangle, so vulnerable, so sweet, scattered with dark gold hair. This was his woman, and he\u2019d failed to protect her. The maid pulled the covers up over Beatrice\u2019s breasts and one arm, leaving her right side bare so he could press the now-sodden cloth against the wound.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s the damned doctor?\u201d he growled.</p><p>No sound had come from Beatrice\u2019s lips as the maid had moved her. She slept deeply.</p><p>\u201cBuild the fire in the fireplace,\u201d he ordered the maid.</p><p>\u201cYes, my lord.\u201d She hurried to the fireplace and heaped coals on the embers there.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d he asked her when she returned to the bed, as much to distract himself as anything else.</p><p>\u201cQuick, my lord,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cHow long have you been with your mistress?\u201d His mind was running in circles, like a mouse trapped in a glass jar. Where was the doctor? How much blood had she lost? Was the bleeding stopped?</p><p>\u201cEight years, my lord,\u201d Quick replied. \u201cI\u2019ve been with Miss Corning since she came out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA long time, then,\u201d he said absently. He laid the back of his hand against Beatrice\u2019s cheek. Still warm. Still alive.</p><p>\u201cYes, my lord,\u201d the maid whispered. \u201cShe\u2019s such a gentle mistress.\u201d</p><p>The door opened and several footmen came in with cloths and hot water. One of them was Henry, looking grave at the sight of his unconscious mistress.</p><p>\u201cHas the doctor been sent for?\u201d Reynaud asked him.</p><p>\u201cYes, my lord,\u201d he replied. \u201cRight away \u2019e was sent for, and Lord Blanchard has gone down to wait for \u2019im.\u201d</p><p>Reynaud nodded. \u201cBring a new cloth here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill she be all right, m\u2019lord?\u201d Henry asked as he gave him the cloth. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cGod, I hope so,\u201d Reynaud replied.</p><p>He replaced the torn piece of underskirt with the clean cloth. The wound was merely oozing now. That at least was good. He closed his eyes. If he still believed in praying, he\u2019d be on his knees right now.</p><p>A commotion on the stairs made him raise his head. A tall thin man in a gray bob wig strode into the room, closely followed by St. Aubyn. The doctor took one all-encompassing look at Beatrice and then turned to Reynaud.</p><p>\u201cHow is she?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShe hasn\u2019t woken from her faint,\u201d Reynaud said. \u201cBut the bleeding is slowing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. Good. A stab wound, I was told?\u201d The doctor stepped close. \u201cMay I?\u201d</p><p>Reynaud relinquished the bandage, and the doctor raised it, making approving murmurs. \u201cYes. Yes, I see. Only a few inches and not deep, I think. Good. We\u2019ll close it while she still sleeps. Bring me the water.\u201d</p><p>This last was said to Henry, who brought a basin over.</p><p>Reynaud stood to give the doctor room, feeling uncommonly useless.</p> <p>The doctor splashed water on the wound and wiped at the blood. \u201cNeed to see to sew.\u201d He took an already-threaded needle from his bag. \u201cCan you hold the edges together?\u201d he asked the maid.</p><p>She paled.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do it,\u201d Reynaud muttered. He gently pinched the wound closed.</p><p>\u201cAh. Good.\u201d The doctor inserted the needle into Beatrice\u2019s flesh.</p><p>Reynaud winced as the blood welled fresh around the needle prick. Beatrice moaned.</p><p>\u201cHurry,\u201d he whispered to the doctor. To see her in pain would undo him now.</p> <p>\u201cHaste makes waste,\u201d murmured the doctor, carefully pulling the bloody thread through. He placed the second stitch, moving deliberately.</p><p>\u201cChrist,\u201d St. Aubyn muttered.</p><p>Reynaud glanced up. The usurper\u2019s face was pasty, and for once he felt pity for the man\u2014St. Aubyn looked sick with worry for his niece.</p><p>Reynaud looked down again to where the doctor\u2019s needle was poking into tender flesh. \u201cThere is no need for so many in here. All of you go, except for the earl and Quick.\u201d</p><p>Feet shuffled to the door.</p><p>\u201cOne more to close it completely,\u201d the doctor said.</p><p>Beatrice moaned again.</p><p>\u201cCan you hold her shoulders?\u201d Reynaud said tightly to the maid. \u201cDon\u2019t let her move.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, my lord.\u201d She went to the head of the bed.</p><p>The doctor tied a knot, slowly and carefully. Reynaud frowned at his hands, silently urging him to hurry.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s got it,\u201d the doctor finally said, and snipped the thread.</p><p>\u201cThank God.\u201d Reynaud felt a bead of sweat slide down his face.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll bandage her,\u201d the doctor said briskly, \u201cand then it\u2019s in the hands of God.\u201d</p><p>Reynaud nodded and stood, watching closely as the doctor did just that. He produced a bottle of some potion from his bag, gave instructions to administer the medicine when the patient woke, and then left just as abruptly as he\u2019d come. The usurper followed him out of the room, presumably to see him to the door, and Reynaud turned to Quick.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s make her comfortable.\u201d</p><p>The maid nodded and brought over a fresh basin of water. She sponged and patted dry the area around the bandage while Reynaud gently wiped Beatrice\u2019s face clean. She still had not woken, and he frowned at her as he took the pins from her hair and combed flaxen locks over the pillow. At least she did not look as if she was in any pain.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s as settled as she\u2019s going to be, my lord,\u201d Quick said. \u201cI\u2019ll just stay here if\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said swiftly, interrupting her. \u201cI\u2019ll stay. Leave us, please.\u201d</p><p>The maid looked uncertain for a moment, but when Reynaud stared at her, she bobbed a curtsy and left the room, closing the door behind her.</p><p>Reynaud unsheathed his knife and laid it on the bedside table. He took off his wig and set it on a chair. Then he pulled off his boots and climbed into the bed. Carefully, tenderly, he gathered Beatrice to him, her uninjured side against him as he lay.</p><p>He brushed the hair from her face, feeling helpless. All his strength, all his determination, mattered not a whit here. It was up to Beatrice and what strength she had.</p><p>\u201cWake up, sweetheart,\u201d he whispered into her hair. \u201cGod, please wake up.\u201d</p><p>THERE WAS SOMETHING warm against her side. Big and warm and, oh! so very nice to lie next to. Beatrice shifted a little, intending to burrow her nose into the warmth, but something cut into her side. \u201cOuch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t move.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes flew open at the deep voice, and for a moment she simply stared up at black eyes framed in thick black eyelashes. He did have such pretty eyelashes; it almost made her jealous. Why a man should have...</p><p>Her mind ground to a halt over the thought and then carefully retraced her steps. A man...</p><p>Beatrice blinked up at Lord Hope. \u201cWhat are you doing in my bed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTaking care of you.\u201d</p><p>The words were soft, but his face wasn\u2019t. She studied him lazily, too tired somehow to get up. He\u2019d left off his wig, and the hair on his shorn head was barely longer than the stubble on his chin. It lay sleek and flat against his head. She wanted to touch it, to see if his hair was soft or prickly. The three birds flew about his right eye, all of them similar but all slightly different. And his midnight eyes watched her back, his brows knit as if with concern.</p><p>\u201cWhy do you need to take care of me?\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cYou were hurt,\u201d he said, \u201cand it was my fault.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere were three assassins outside of Jeremy Oates\u2019s town house.\u201d</p><p>She remembered now\u2014the man with the walleye and the other two smaller men, loitering. \u201cWhy? Why were they there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo kill me,\u201d he said grimly.</p><p>She reached up a hand and traced one of the bird tattoos near his eye. \u201cWhy is someone trying to kill you? Do you know?\u201d</p><p>He closed his eyes at her touch. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t know. Vale thinks it\u2019s someone from our past.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand.\u201d Her hand dropped.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t either.\u201d He opened his eyes, which were blazing black. \u201cAll I know is that it\u2019s my fault that you\u2019re hurt.\u201d</p><p>She frowned, still confused. \u201cBut why is that your fault?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI failed to protect you,\u201d he said.</p><p>She raised her eyebrows bemusedly. \u201cIs that your job? To protect me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is.\u201d</p><p>And he bent his head very slowly toward her. She watched him nearing, the birds getting ever closer, and she thought, He\u2019s going to kiss me.</p><p>And then he was.</p><p>His lips were far softer than she would\u2019ve thought\u2014and they moved over hers gently but firmly. He\u2019d kissed her once before, but that time it\u2019d been so swift she\u2019d hardly had time to assimilate the sensations. This time she could. His bristly cheeks scratched hers, but she didn\u2019t mind. She was caught up in the sensation of his mouth, the smell of his neck\u2014warm and masculine\u2014and the sound of his breathing coming faster as he kissed her. He ran his tongue lazily over her lips, and she was so enchanted that she parted them, letting him in. He surged into her mouth, tasting of man, and she moaned, softly, just a little, but it was enough for him to pull back.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m hurting you,\u201d he said, scowling.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she replied, but it was already too late.</p><p>He rolled off the bed, taking with him all his glorious warmth and his magical mouth.</p><p>Beatrice pouted.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll send for your maid,\u201d he said as he pulled on his boots. \u201cWould you like anything? Tea? Some broth?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like some tea,\u201d she replied. She squinted at the window, but the curtains were pulled. \u201cWhat time is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlmost night,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019ve slept all day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid I?\u201d How strange to remember morning and then nothing at all until after dark. The thought jogged her brain. \u201cYou were hurt!\u201d</p><p>He turned to look at her. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour arm. I saw one of the men cut your arm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis?\u201d He pushed back the sleeve of his coat to reveal a torn and rust-stained shirt.</p><p>\u201cYes, that!\u201d She was struggling to sit up now. \u201cWhy haven\u2019t you had it seen to?\u201d</p><p>He pressed her gently back down. \u201cBecause it isn\u2019t of any concern.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe not for you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHush.\u201d His gaze was quite fierce. \u201cYou\u2019ve had a stressful day, and your wound must ache. Rest now and I\u2019ll come and see you when you\u2019re properly attired.\u201d</p><p>He strode from the room masterfully.</p><p>Properly attired? Beatrice frowned and only then realized that she hadn\u2019t a stitch of clothing on under the covers.</p><p>Oh, my.</p><p>IT WAS AFTER ten by the time Reynaud got to Vale\u2019s house and started banging on the door. Too early for Vale to have returned if he was out at a social event, too late for him to be receiving if he was spending a rare evening at home. Reynaud banged anyway. Vale was his only ally as far as he could see, and at the moment he needed an ally.</p><p>The door opened to reveal the face of a disapproving butler, whose expression modified only a little when he saw it was a gentleman knocking.</p><p>\u201cSir?\u201d</p><p>Reynaud shouldered past the man. Damned if he\u2019d stand on the step like a beggar. \u201cIs the viscount home?\u201d</p><p>The butler\u2019s brows lowered. \u201cLord and Lady Vale are not receiving this evening. Perhaps if you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not coming back tomorrow,\u201d Reynaud interrupted. \u201cEither you go rouse him from wherever he is, or I\u2019ll get him myself.\u201d</p><p>The butler drew himself up and sniffed. \u201cIf you\u2019ll wait in the sitting room, my lord.\u201d</p><p>Reynaud stalked into the indicated room and spent the next ten minutes pacing from one end to the other. He was just about to give it up and go find Vale himself when the door opened.</p><p>Vale strolled in, yawning and wrapping a banyan about his middle. \u201cMuch as I\u2019m glad that you\u2019ve returned from the dead, old man, I really must insist that I reserve my evenings at home for my wife.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is important.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo is marital harmony.\u201d Vale went to a tray with a decanter and glasses. He held up the bottle. \u201cBrandy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeatrice was stabbed this morning.\u201d</p><p>Vale paused, decanter still in his hand. \u201cBeatrice?\u201d</p><p>Reynaud waved an impatient hand. \u201cMiss Corning. She got in the way of an assassination attempt on me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood God,\u201d Vale said softly. \u201cIs she all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe fainted and bled quite profusely,\u201d Reynaud muttered, the image of Beatrice\u2019s soft skin violated still fresh in his mind. \u201cBut she woke just an hour ago and seemed in her right mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank God.\u201d Vale splashed some brandy into a glass and took a gulp. \u201cAnd how closely related to you is Cousin Beatrice?\u201d</p><p>Reynaud gave him a look. \u201cNot that close.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGlad to hear it.\u201d Vale dropped into a cushioned chair. \u201cI hope she recovers fully so that you can then propose to her. Because I tell you now, matrimony truly is a blessed state, enjoyed by all men of good sense and halfway adequate bedroom skills.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you for that edifying thought,\u201d Reynaud growled.</p><p>Vale waved his glass. \u201cThink nothing of it. I say, you haven\u2019t forgotten how to treat a lady in the bedroom, have you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, for God\u2019s sake!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been out of refined society for years and years now. I could give you some pointers, should you need them.\u201d</p><p>Reynaud\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u201cThis from the man I had to save from an irate whore when we were seventeen?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cGood God, I\u2019d forgotten that incident.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t,\u201d Reynaud muttered. \u201cShe had a big bruiser for a pimp.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, well, her argument was with the fact that I refused to pay triple her price when her pimp showed up, not with my bed skills,\u201d Vale pointed out. \u201cEven at seventeen, I could\u2019ve shown you a trick or two\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cJasper,\u201d Reynaud growled in warning.</p> <p>Vale hid a grin in his glass and then sobered as he lowered it. \u201cWho were the assassins?\u201d</p><p>Reynaud threw himself into a chair. \u201cThree ruffians, not very skilled at it, I think. They were led by a man with a pronounced walleye.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIndeed?\u201d Vale tilted back his head to stare at the ceiling. \u201cDid he have any other interesting characteristics that might make him recognizable?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTall, quick, knew how to use a knife.\u201d Reynaud shrugged. \u201cNot much else, I\u2019m afraid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe color of his hair?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBrown.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d Vale considered for a moment. \u201cI\u2019ll send another letter to Munroe. We need him here.\u201d</p><p>Reynaud frowned. \u201cYou think the attack on me is somehow related to what happened seven years ago?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook here.\u201d Vale sat forward in his chair, no longer the lazy aristocrat but a man of intense intelligence. \u201cI\u2019d thought we\u2019d hit a dead end in finding the Spinner\u2019s Falls traitor. And then you arrive home, and in the space of little more than a week, two attempts have been made against your life. This is extraordinary!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGlad to bring you some joy,\u201d Reynaud muttered.</p><p>Vale ignored the sarcasm. \u201cI\u2019m more convinced than ever that you have important information that will either expose the traitor or make him vulnerable in some way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you\u2019ve entirely cast off the idea that St. Aubyn was behind the attacks?\u201d Reynaud had already come to this conclusion, but he wanted to hear Vale\u2019s thoughts.</p><p>The other man shook his head. \u201cBlanchard is a pompous blowhard, but he has enough brains not to make an attempt against your life. Besides, I know you dislike the man, but he\u2019s never struck me as so thoroughly lacking in morals as to hire an assassin.\u201d</p><p>Reynaud scowled. \u201cThat\u2019s\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBesides, why would Blanchard risk killing you when you gave the gossips such lovely fodder the other night?\u201d</p><p>Reynaud swung to glare at his friend.</p><p>\u201cI sympathize.\u201d Vale shrugged. \u201cBut you must admit your antics on the dance floor did nothing to help your cause.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re talking about Blanchard\u2014\u201d</p><p>Vale waved a hand, interrupting him. \u201cBlanchard\u2019s not the point. We\u2019re getting closer to the Spinner\u2019s Falls traitor. How I\u2019m not sure, but we must be, judging by these attacks on you. If we can get Munroe down here and put our heads together, maybe we can figure this thing out, once and for all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery well,\u201d Reynaud said slowly. \u201cBut perhaps we should send a messenger. A rider would get to Scotland before the mail. Or would you rather go yourself?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll send a messenger with a letter.\u201d Vale jumped up and went to rummage in a desk as if intending to write the letter that very moment. \u201cAs it happens, I don\u2019t want to leave London at the moment.\u201d</p><p>Reynaud looked at him inquiringly and was astonished to see a flush climbing his old friend\u2019s cheeks.</p><p>\u201cMy wife is, ah, expecting the sixth Viscount Vale,\u201d the other man muttered. \u201cOr perhaps merely an honorable miss\u2014not that I care a whit in either case. I just want a babe with all its toes and not looking too much like its pater.\u201d</p><p>Reynaud grinned. \u201cCongratulations, man!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, well.\u201d Vale cleared his throat. \u201cShe\u2019s a bit nervous about the whole thing, so we\u2019re keeping the matter quiet while we can. You understand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d Reynaud frowned. Melisande looked healthy enough, but so many things could go wrong in a pregnancy.</p><p>\u201cAnd in the meantime,\u201d Vale said as if happy to drop the subject, \u201cwhile we wait for Munroe, I think it prudent to make some inquiries regarding your attackers. London is an enormous place, but there can\u2019t be that many walleyed assassins for hire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Reynaud said, and for the first time in many, many, years, he felt like a friend had his back.</p><p>Now if he could only keep Beatrice safe.</p><p>\u201cTELL ME A story,\u201d Beatrice said. She was in bed\u2014the fourth day of lying abed to \u201crest\u201d\u2014and she was bored beyond reason. She wore a comfortable day dress and sat up against her pillows, but she was definitely confined to her bed.</p><p>\u201cWhat sort of story?\u201d Lord Hope said rather distractedly. He was in a chair by the bed, supposedly to keep her company, but he had a stack of papers from his solicitors, and he was reading them instead.</p><p>\u201cYou could tell me about the first time you made love to a woman,\u201d she said conversationally.</p><p>There was a pause during which she was certain that he hadn\u2019t heard her, and then he looked up. His black eyes were gleaming, and now she knew he had heard her. \u201cYou\u2019re still recovering, so I think we might want to save that particular story for another time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow disappointing,\u201d she said, looking down demurely.</p><p>He cleared his throat. \u201cPerhaps something else might amuse you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuch as?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cWould you like to hear about army life? Or what Vale and I did in the schoolroom?\u201d</p><p>She cocked her head. \u201cI\u2019d love to hear about those stories sometime. But now I\u2019m wondering about your time with the Indians.\u201d</p><p>He looked back at his papers, a small frown between his brows. \u201cI\u2019ve already told you: I was captured and made a slave. There isn\u2019t much else to talk about.\u201d</p><p>She studied him, aware that it would be polite to drop the subject. The story of how he was captured and brought to the Indian camp was harrowing. He obviously didn\u2019t want to talk about his captivity. But she also knew\u2014somehow, without logical explanation\u2014that he was lying. There was more, much more, to his story. Seven whole years\u2019 worth. The time during which he\u2019d transformed from the laughing boy in the portrait to the hard man before her. She needed to hear how that had happened, and perhaps he needed in some way to tell her.</p><p>\u201cPlease?\u201d she asked softly.</p><p>For a moment, she was sure he\u2019d deny her. Then he flung the papers down. \u201cVery well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>He stared into space for a time. Then he blinked and said, \u201cYes, well. Gaho wanted me because she needed another hunter for her family. I should explain that some Indians have an interesting tradition. They take captives of war or raids and place them ceremonially in their family. So I took the position that a son would\u2019ve filled in Gaho\u2019s family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen she was your adoptive mother?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn theory only.\u201d Reynaud\u2019s mouth twisted. \u201cI was, for all practical purposes, a slave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Again she thought that must\u2019ve been a terrible blow to his pride\u2014to go from being a viscount and an officer in His Majesty\u2019s army to being regarded as a slave.</p><p>\u201cShe treated me well enough.\u201d He was gazing sightlessly out her bedroom window. \u201cCertainly better than we sometimes treat our prisoners of war. And, of course, I was glad not to\u2019ve been executed. But, in the end, I was a slave, without control over my own life.\u201d</p><p>For a moment he was quiet.</p><p>\u201cWhat were your duties?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cHunting.\u201d He looked at her, his mouth twisting. \u201cI found out after a while that at one time the village had been much bigger, but the tribe had been decimated by disease some years before. Where once there had been many able-bodied men to provide meat during the winter, now there were only a handful. I went out with Gaho\u2019s husband, another older man who we called Uncle, and Sastaretsi.\u201d</p><p>She shivered. \u201cThat must\u2019ve been awful\u2014to have to hunt with the man who had intended to kill you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI watched my back at all times.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd did you try to escape?\u201d</p><p>He looked down at his papers. \u201cI thought of escaping constantly. Every night as they bound my hands and staked me to the ground, I thought of ways I could unwork the knots. My fingernails grew back in, but I soon realized that I wouldn\u2019t be able to survive for long on my own. Not in the dead of winter when meat was scarce and the whole village was in danger of starving. That country is vast and savage. The snow can reach as deep as a man\u2019s chest. I was hundreds of miles into French-held territory.\u201d</p><p>Beatrice shivered. \u201cIt sounds brutal.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cIt was so cold that my eyelashes froze when we went hunting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did you hunt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever we could find,\u201d he said. \u201cDeer, raccoon, squirrels, bear\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBear!\u201d She wrinkled her nose. \u201cYou didn\u2019t eat it, did you?\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cIt takes some getting used to, but, yes\u2014\u201d</p><p>The door opened, interrupting him. Quick came in with a tray of tea. \u201cHere\u2019s something for you, miss.\u201d She set down the tray. \u201cOh, and a note for you, my lord.\u201d</p><p>She handed a folded scrap of paper to Lord Hope.</p><p>Beatrice watched him as she took a dish of tea from Quick. Lord Hope knit his brows as he read, and then he crumpled the paper and threw it into the fire.</p><p>\u201cNot bad news, I hope,\u201d she said lightly.</p><p>\u201cNo. Nothing for you to worry about.\u201d He got up from his chair. \u201cIn fact, you should be resting now. I\u2019m off to see about some business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been resting for four days,\u201d she called to his broad back.</p><p>He merely smiled over his shoulder and shut the door behind him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m tired of lying abed,\u201d she complained to Quick.</p><p>\u201cYes, miss, but Lord Hope says as you\u2019re to stay there another day or so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen did everyone start listening to him?\u201d Beatrice muttered childishly.</p><p>But Quick considered the question solemnly. \u201cI think \u2019twas when he took charge of Henry after he was wounded, miss. And then he seemed to know just what to do when you were hurt.\u201d The maid shrugged. \u201cI know he \u2019tisn\u2019t officially the earl yet, miss, but it\u2019s hard not to treat him that way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe does seem to\u2019ve fallen naturally into the role,\u201d Beatrice murmured.</p><p>In the last week, Lord Hope had overseen her medical care. In addition, from what she could tell by the letters he read and the conversations she overheard with the servants, he seemed to be receiving reports from the various Blanchard estates and holdings. Reports that normally would go to her uncle.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t seen Uncle Reggie since the morning after she\u2019d been attacked, and now she wondered\u2014rather guiltily\u2014how he was getting on. No matter how Uncle Reggie protested, everything was changing about him. It must be hard for him. Harder still since he seemed to have the idea that she was only on Lord Hope\u2019s side. If it were up to her, she\u2019d be on both their sides... if only they\u2019d let her.</p><p>Beatrice sighed. She was tired of lying abed, tired of only hearing about news and events instead of experiencing them. \u201cI\u2019m getting up.\u201d</p><p>Quick looked alarmed. \u201cLord Hope said\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cLord Hope is not my master,\u201d Beatrice said loftily, and threw back the covers. \u201cHave the carriage brought round.\u201d</p><p>Forty-five minutes later, she was rolling through London on the way to Jeremy\u2019s house. She hadn\u2019t seen him since the attack, and she was beginning to get rather worried. Lottie had sent a note every day and a lovely little bunch of flowers, but Beatrice had received no word from Jeremy. Had he even heard that she\u2019d been hurt? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>By the time the carriage pulled up in front of Jeremy\u2019s town house, the sky had darkened, threatening rain. Beatrice climbed out of the carriage and ran up the steps of the town house to knock at the door. She glanced at the black clouds overhead while she waited, wishing Putley would hurry.</p><p>When at last he opened the door, she made to walk past him, saying, \u201cGood afternoon, Putley. I won\u2019t be staying long.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA moment, miss,\u201d the butler gasped.</p><p>\u201cOh, really, Putley, after all this time, can\u2019t you at least pretend you know me?\u201d She smiled up at him, but then her smile fell from her face as completely as if it\u2019d never been there.</p> <p>The butler\u2019s face was gray.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he said, and for once he did sound sorry.</p><p>Which only made panic rise in her chest. \u201cNo. Let me in. Let me see him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t, miss,\u201d the old butler said. \u201cMr. Oates is dead. Dead and buried.\u201d</p> <p>Chapter Ten</p><p>Princess Serenity\u2019s horse had been killed, and Longsword had none, so they were forced to set off for the witch\u2019s lair on foot. All that day they walked, and though the princess was small and slight, never did she falter. At nightfall, they came to the foot of the mountain where the witch lived. In the dark, guided only by the light of the pale moon, they climbed the great black mountain. Strange beasts stirred in the shadows, and mournful birds cried in the dark, but Longsword and the princess pressed on. And as the first light of dawn crested the peak of the mountain, they stood before the witch\u2019s castle....</p><p>\u2014from Longsword</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean, she\u2019s gone out?\u201d Reynaud grated at the butler. He stood in the front hall, having just returned from his business meeting.</p><p>The man cringed but stood his ground bravely enough. \u201cMiss Corning said she was going to visit Mr. Oates, my lord.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDammit!\u201d Reynaud turned and ran to the front door, throwing it open. The stable boy was just leading his horse to the corner. \u201cOy! Bring him back here!\u201d</p> <p>The boy looked up, startled, but led the big bay around. Reynaud leaped down the steps and mounted the horse, nudging the gelding into a trot. He\u2019d seen the note just this afternoon while sitting with her in her bedroom. Jeremy Oates had died two days before. Why it had taken Oates\u2019s parents that long to write the terse note, he had no idea. He knew he should feel shame for reading Beatrice\u2019s letters, but he\u2019d wanted to protect her while she was recovering from that terrible stab wound. He\u2019d intended to break the news of her friend\u2019s death gently. Hold her while she wept. Dammit! Now his plan to cushion the blow was in shambles. He urged the horse into a canter, riding dangerously fast past carts and pedestrians.</p><p>Five minutes later, when he rounded the corner onto Oates\u2019s street, the first thing he saw was Beatrice, standing at the top of the town-house steps, looking like a forlorn waif. He jumped down from the horse and threw the reins to one of the footmen attending her carriage. Then he slowly mounted the stairs. One fat raindrop fell, then two, then a deluge let down.</p><p>They were instantly drenched.</p><p>He took her arm gently. \u201cCome home, Beatrice.\u201d</p><p>She looked up at him, the water running down her face like tears. \u201cHe\u2019s dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d she asked. \u201cHow could he be dead? I just saw him the other day, and he was fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome home.\u201d He started leading her down the steps. \u201cYou\u2019re still ill.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo!\u201d She yanked her arm suddenly and surprised him enough to pull it from his grasp. \u201cNo! I want to see him. Maybe they\u2019re wrong. They hardly look in on him at all. Maybe he\u2019s just... just . . .\u201d She trailed away, looking around wildly. \u201cI want to see him.\u201d</p><p>She started back up the stairs.</p><p>He came up swiftly behind her and picked her up. \u201cYou need to go home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d She flailed her arms and hit him\u2014whether on purpose or accidently, it was hard to tell. \u201cLet me go! Let me see him!\u201d</p><p>He no longer tried arguing with her. Instead he ran down the rain-slicked steps and took her to the carriage.</p><p>\u201cHome!\u201d he yelled to the coachman before ducking into the vehicle.</p><p>The footman slammed the door behind them, and the carriage bumped into motion.</p><p>He wrapped his arms about her to contain her movements so she wouldn\u2019t pull the stitches out of her wound, but she\u2019d stopped struggling. Deep, heaving sobs shook her frame.</p><p>He laid his cheek against her wet hair. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t fair,\u201d she choked.</p><p>\u201cNo, \u2019tisn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was so young.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>He murmured into her hair, gently stroking her cheek, her shoulder, and let her sob against him. Her grief was uncontrolled, childish and wild and without grace, and such raw emotion stirred something within him. This woman was real. He might never again be the sort of civilized English gentleman she deserved, but she was exactly what he wanted. What he needed. She was warm and caring, and she was home.</p><p>He wanted her.</p><p>So when the carriage at last pulled up in front of Blanchard House\u2014his house\u2014he took her in his arms and carried her up the steps and into the house as and his ancestors with their brides. He passed the butler, the footmen, and the maids, and all fell back, making way for him and his prize.</p><p>\u201cNo one disturbs us,\u201d he said, and then mounted the stairs to her room. The master bedroom\u2014the one used by his father and all the Earls of Blanchard before him\u2014would\u2019ve been better for what he intended, but the usurper was using it, and it didn\u2019t matter anyway. This was between only the two of them and no one else.</p><p>He made her room and walked in. The maid was there, dithering by the wardrobe.</p><p>\u201cLeave us,\u201d he said, and she did.</p><p>He set Beatrice down gently by the bed. She had her face still buried in his shoulder and was as limp as a rag doll.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said feebly, though what she still protested he had no idea. She probably didn\u2019t, either.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re wet,\u201d he said gently. \u201cI need to dry you.\u201d</p><p>She stood without protest as he unlaced her bodice and stays, stripping the wet fabric from her body. He did it dispassionately. It was important to get her warm and to make sure she hadn\u2019t reopened the wound. When she was nude, he took a cloth from the wardrobe and rubbed her all over, drying what wet there was. Her skin was white and peach, a smooth, beautiful expanse. He took the pins from her hair and dried them with the towel, watching as the silky gold strands curled against his fingers. When that was done, he wet a corner of the cloth at the basin on the dresser and washed her face. Her cheeks were reddened, her eyelids and lips swollen, and he knew she didn\u2019t look her prettiest, but his cock didn\u2019t care. He\u2019d been erect since he\u2019d walked into the room.</p><p>Finally, he pulled back the coverlet on her bed and, picking her up, laid her on the bed and tugged the sheets over her to keep her warm.</p><p>It was only after he\u2019d taken off his coat and begun unbuttoning his waistcoat that her eyebrows knit.</p><p>\u201cWhat,\u201d she said softly, \u201care you doing?\u201d</p><p>HER CHEST HURT. Her heart and lungs and breasts, they all hurt with every breath she took. She felt as if part of her world had broken off and fallen, never to be reclaimed again. Jeremy was dead. Dead, and she\u2019d not even known it until Putley had blurted the news. Shouldn\u2019t she have known? Shouldn\u2019t she have felt his passing in some fundamental portion of herself?</p><p>She shied from the thought, from the bone-crushing hurt, and looked at Lord Hope. Somehow he\u2019d taken her to her rooms and undressed her. She should be scandalized, but she just hadn\u2019t the will to be. And now... and now he appeared to be taking off his own clothing.</p><p>She peered at him, only a little bit curious. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUndressing,\u201d he said, and that certainly made sense because he was.</p><p>He took off his waistcoat and shirt, and she watched, detached. His arms were strong and brown from the sun. Had he worn a shirt when he\u2019d lived with the Indians? He unbuttoned the fall of his breeches, and she watched him strip those off as well. His smallclothes were tented over his masculine parts, and at any other time she would be very interested at the sight, but at the moment she felt... nothing.</p><p>Or at least almost nothing.</p><p>\u201cBut why?\u201d she asked, and even in her sad state, she knew her voice sounded like a small child\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cWhy what?\u201d he asked as he removed his shoes and stockings.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you undressing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I intend to lie with you,\u201d he said, and took off his smallclothes.</p><p>Well, that certainly was something she\u2019d not seen before. His cock stood up as proudly as a soldier, thick and round and almost a purplish red, particularly at the head. She blinked at the sight. Then he was walking toward her, that part of himself bobbing with each step, and he got into the bed with her. He gathered her close and he felt so hot. So hot he was like a furnace and she sighed a little at how nice his hard, hot body felt against her cold skin.</p><p>She looked up at him, so close, his black eyes only inches from her own, and said, \u201cHe\u2019s dead and I\u2019ll never forget him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I know,\u201d he replied.</p><p>\u201cI want to die, too.\u201d</p><p>His eyes hardened. \u201cI won\u2019t let you.\u201d</p><p>And he kissed her. His mouth was hot, too, and this time he didn\u2019t wait but thrust his tongue into her mouth. She moaned a little at the sensation. He tasted of rain-water and salt, and suddenly she couldn\u2019t think of anything better to taste. She grasped at his shoulder and felt bare, masculine skin, and she dug her fingernails in. If she wasn\u2019t allowed to die, then she would live and forget the rest of the world for right now.</p><p>At this moment, there was only the two of them, together in this cozy bed.</p><p>He pushed his fingers through her hair, gripping the back of her head, holding her as he explored her mouth with his tongue. He darted in and then out until she caught him and sucked on him, and he made an approving sound. He rolled then, climbing atop her, and she felt the brush of his chest hair against her breasts, tickling and arousing.</p><p>She made a sound deep in her throat, and he raised his head. \u201cAm I hurting you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She tried to pull him back down to kiss her, but he held still, resisting her.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d She said it irritably, because she missed his kisses. It seemed to her that he was simply teasing her.</p><p>Then he moved, shifting so that one of his legs began to part hers. Her eyes flew to his, and she saw the corner of his mouth quirk.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYe-es,\u201d she said, but she was distracted, feeling the slow insertion of his thigh between hers. Her legs fell open, admitting him, but he didn\u2019t stop there. He continued pressing down until his thigh had thrust to the very apex of her thighs, until he had burrowed against her feminine flesh, and she was parted, open against him.</p><p>Her eyes widened.</p><p>His eyes drooped, the tattooed birds looking wild and pagan.</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t hurt?\u201d he asked gently.</p><p>\u201cNo... oh!\u201d She gasped because he\u2019d shifted and pressed, and somehow the combination was simply divine. \u201cDo that again,\u201d she demanded.</p><p>He grinned, his teeth white against his brown skin. \u201cAs my lady commands.\u201d</p><p>And he kissed her as he pressed with his thigh. She opened her mouth wide, wanting to taste all of him, wanting to experience everything he might show her. When next he pressed down, she shoved up, rubbing herself against him, twisting and thrusting. She wanted... more. Much more.</p><p>She tore her mouth from his and looked him in the face. \u201cPut it in me.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He didn\u2019t pretend shock. \u201cNot yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut why not?\u201d She widened her legs in invitation. She could feel that part of him, pressing against her thigh. \u201cIsn\u2019t that what comes next? Isn\u2019t that what you want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet,\u201d he said maddeningly, and placed his mouth against hers again. But this time he didn\u2019t stay there. He caressed her with his open mouth, with his soft lips, as he trailed downward over her throat. He licked the upper slope of her breast and then took the nipple in his mouth.</p><p>She gasped. That small point flamed with pleasure, each strong suck a pull that tugged at her center. She arched, clutching at his head, feeling his shorn bristles beneath her palms.</p> <p>He shifted, licking his way to her other breast, and tasted that nipple as well. At the same time, his thigh still pressed against her.</p><p>She arched up. \u201cOh, please, now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet,\u201d he whispered, his breath blowing over her wet, sensitive nipple.</p><p>He raised himself on straight arms and brought both legs between hers. She was spread wide now, eager and waiting for the inevitable conclusion to this.</p><p>But it didn\u2019t come. He reached down to position himself, laying his penis against her wet folds. Then he bore down, pressing himself against her most sensitive point.</p> <p>She twisted, panting, under him. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>His face was grim, the cross earring shining dully at the corner of his jaw. \u201cI\u2019m preparing you.\u201d</p><p>She glared at him through slitted eyes. \u201cI am prepared.\u201d</p><p>His lips curled, not quite smiling. \u201cNot yet.\u201d</p><p>He bent and caught her lower lip between his teeth, gently biting as he rocked against her. And something combusted down there. A flame flickered and flared, growing steadily, spreading through her belly, threatening to burn out of control.</p><p>\u201cStop,\u201d she cried, but her voice was muffled beneath his lips. He opened his mouth over hers and swallowed whole her moan of ecstasy.</p> <p>\u201cNow,\u201d he said when he lifted his head. \u201cNow it\u2019s time. Put me where you want me to be.\u201d</p><p>He caught her hand and brought it between their bodies, guiding her to his hard, slick flesh. He wrapped her fingers around his heat and then took his hand away. He looked at her. \u201cIt\u2019s up to you.\u201d</p><p>She blinked. \u201cBut I don\u2019t know\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want it?\u201d Beads of sweat stood out on his upper lip. She realized that he was holding himself very still.</p><p>She licked her lips. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen\u201d\u2014he nudged her with his hips, his length sliding through her fingers, his eyes half closed\u2014\u201cdo it.\u201d</p><p>So she guided him to where she thought he should be, feeling the width of his head slip through her folds, wondering if this was quite possible. She looked up at him, into black, intense eyes, and for a fraction of a second thought she must\u2019ve lost her mind.</p><p>Then he leaned down and kissed her forehead. \u201cAre you sure?\u201d</p> <p>And that small bit of tenderness decided her. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>He wasn\u2019t gentle. He didn\u2019t try to go slowly. He thrust himself inside her, quickly and violently, and her entire body arched with the pain. Burning. Tearing. Something wasn\u2019t right.</p><p>She pressed her palms against his chest. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>He looked down at her, his face drawn, the tattooed birds flying about his eye, wild and savage, and he no longer looked tender. He looked like a conqueror. \u201cToo late. You\u2019re mine now.\u201d</p><p>And he withdrew his penis slowly, until only the head remained inside her, large and intrusive.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so soft, so tight around me,\u201d he whispered like a demon incubus. His upper lip curled in erotic bliss. \u201cI want to stay in you forever. I want to make love to you for an eternity.\u201d</p><p>He thrust back into her, and although it hurt, it wasn\u2019t as bad as the first time. He leaned down and touched the corner of her mouth with the tip of his tongue. \u201cI can smell your sex, and it\u2019s hot around me. You make me tremble with want.\u201d</p><p>She touched his face, tracing the damp birds wonderingly. Was it true? Did he tremble for her? She\u2019d never known, never dreamed she could affect him thus.</p><p>He closed his eyes as if in pain. \u201cI\u2019m trying to hold back, trying to go slow, but I can\u2019t.\u201d His head fell, his iron cross earring brushing her breast. \u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>And he thrust into her again, hard and fast. She gasped at the impact. It no longer hurt, but there wasn\u2019t the same pleasure as there had been before when he\u2019d used his thigh on her. She watched his face, hard and intent above her, and felt the slide of his flesh in hers. He was on her and in her, physically dominating her, but he seemed the more vulnerable one, and it fascinated her. His breathing was rough, coming in quick gasps; his eyes were unfocused and desperate, his mouth drawn in a line of desire. His body seemed to act of its own volition, as if he no longer controlled his movements.</p><p>She reached up to caress his cheek.</p><p>His eyes closed. \u201cBeatrice. Beatrice.\u201d</p><p>He bent and kissed her wildly, uncontrolled and desperate, and she returned the kiss, awed that she\u2019d brought him to this extreme.</p><p>And suddenly he arched and shuddered, his big body convulsing. He buried his head in her breasts and muffled a shout, trembling all over.</p><p>Then the room was silent. She felt his heavy weight on her and listened to the patter of the rain hitting her window. She should move\u2014make him move\u2014get up and deal with tragedy and loss and her life.</p><p>Instead, she fell asleep.</p><p>HE WOKE TO the sound of thunder outside and the soft breath of a woman against his side. Every muscle in his body, every bone and sinew, was completely and utterly relaxed, and he smiled before he even opened his eyes. For the first time in seven long years, he felt... at peace. He turned his head to look at the woman beside him. The woman who had brought him such overwhelming contentment.</p><p>Beatrice lay sleeping. Her wheat-colored hair was tangled about her face. Her sweet lips were slightly parted, her lovely brows drawn together as if even in sleep she mourned her friend. He wanted to smooth that small indent between her eyebrows, wanted to take her pain from her, but that was impossible. He couldn\u2019t heal her grief, but he could make sure she was never harmed again. She was too important to him now. She made him feel whole. Sane and calm. He knew he\u2019d have to work quickly to consolidate his position.</p><p>Quietly he drew back the coverlet and climbed from the bed. He stretched, feeling the pop of his spine, and then bent to retrieve his smallclothes from the floor. He must not\u2019ve been as stealthy as he thought, for when he straightened, clear gray eyes met his own.</p><p>He dropped the smallclothes and went to her. \u201cAre you all right?\u201d</p><p>She blinked sleepily and then blushed enchantingly. \u201cI\u2019m... rather sore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d He sat on the bed and brushed the hair from her eyes. \u201cStay here and I\u2019ll send the maid up with a hot bath.\u201d</p><p>A corner of her mouth curved down sadly. \u201cThat would be nice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can spend the rest of the day abed,\u201d he said softly.</p><p>Her eyes slid away from his. \u201cBut Jeremy . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll find out what arrangements his family made\u2014where they buried him.\u201d He bent to kiss her gently on the cheek.</p><p>She caught his hand. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>He nodded and straightened, picking up his smallclothes again. He drew them on and buttoned the flap.</p><p>Her brows knit. \u201cWhat time is it? How long have you been closeted here with me?\u201d</p><p>He glanced at the clock on the mantel. \u201cA little over an hour and a half.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, my God!\u201d She struggled to sit up in the bed. The sheets slid down to her lap, baring her sweet breasts. She snatched them up again. \u201cWhat will Quick think\u2014or my uncle?\u201d</p><p>He stilled in the act of buttoning his breeches and looked at her. She seemed so young, lying against the white linens, her hair all about her, her wide gray eyes watching him seriously. She\u2019d just lost her childhood friend. Perhaps she hadn\u2019t thought ahead as he had. \u201cThey\u2019ll think I\u2019ve bedded you.\u201d</p><p>Her mouth fell open. \u201cYou must leave at once.\u201d</p><p>He set his jaw and picked up his shirt. \u201cBeatrice\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHurry! Quick and I can make something up if you just leave at once. I\u2019m sure we can find a way around this. It can be as if it never happened.\u201d</p><p>Reynaud scowled, not liking the sound of that at all. Frankly, he didn\u2019t give a damn what anyone thought, including her uncle, but her cheeks had gone pale. Dammit, he didn\u2019t want to distress her.</p><p>He leaned over her, placing his hands on either side of her hips. \u201cI\u2019ll leave, but I\u2019m not a callow youth to be dismissed from your bed, madam.\u201d</p><p>And he kissed her before she could retort. Hard and hot, thrusting his tongue into her mouth without preamble. This woman was his, and damned if he was going to let her doubt it for even one second after he\u2019d already laid claim.</p><p>He straightened and looked into her dazed gray eyes. \u201cThis matter is far from settled.\u201d</p><p>And scooping up the rest of his clothes, he left the room.</p><p>Chapter Eleven</p><p>From the castle gates poured one hundred fierce warriors. They were clad in armor so black it reflected no light, and they shouted their war cries so loudly the very air trembled. They charged at Longsword. You might think such a show of force would send a mere mortal running, but not he. Longsword stood firm and true and swung his heavy sword. His blade glinted in the sun, the sweat streamed from his broad brow, and the heads of the magical army fell like leaves in autumn. For an hour he fought, and at the end of that hour, not a black warrior still lived....</p><p>\u2014from Longsword</p><p>\u201cAnd he actually threatened to bed you again?\u201d Lottie asked the next afternoon, looking more animated than she had for some days now.</p><p>\u201cNot in so many words,\u201d Beatrice said slowly. \u201cBut the implication was there, certainly.\u201d</p><p>Both ladies were in Lottie\u2019s carriage, riding toward a salon at Mrs. Postlethwaite\u2019s residence.</p><p>\u201cHow very thrilling!\u201d Lottie exclaimed. \u201cIt\u2019s like an awful play.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it isn\u2019t an awful play,\u201d Beatrice replied morosely. \u201cIt\u2019s my life. Oh, what am I to do, Lottie? I gave myself to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, gave! How can one give oneself to a man, I ask you?\u201d</p><p>Beatrice knit her brows. \u201cI don\u2019t know what else to call it. I\u2019m no longer a virgin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what of it?\u201d Lottie asked spiritedly. \u201cIt\u2019s only a bit of blood and an act of five minutes or so\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cRather more than five minutes,\u201d Beatrice muttered, blushing.</p><p>Lottie waved aside her friend\u2019s comment. \u201cIn any case, I don\u2019t think it ought to decide your entire life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut what if I\u2019m pregnant?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHighly unlikely after just the one time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd besides, he definitely took advantage of you. I mean, right after you\u2019d learned about poor Jeremy! It wasn\u2019t at all sporting. I don\u2019t think it ought to count, really.\u201d</p><p>Beatrice frowned, unsure what Lottie meant by \u201ccount.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee here,\u201d Lottie continued, oblivious. \u201cIt\u2019ll be at least a couple of months until you\u2019re certain. Although, I have heard of ladies who never knew until the moment they were holding a squirming baby in their arms.\u201d</p><p>Beatrice moaned.</p><p>\u201cBut, in any case,\u201d Lottie said hastily, \u201cthere\u2019s no need to make a decision right now. Just because the man has taken your virginity doesn\u2019t mean he should own your entire life. What if you decide to take other lovers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I don\u2019t want other lovers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfter all, why tie yourself to one man? You could be a dashing and scandalous courtesan!\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Beatrice sighed. Lottie seemed to be confusing Beatrice\u2019s predicament with her own life since she\u2019d left Mr. Graham. Although Beatrice noticed that Lottie hadn\u2019t started taking lovers and living the life of a fast matron.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to be a dashing and scandalous courtesan,\u201d Beatrice said quietly. \u201cAnd I do have to make a decision, because Lord Hope isn\u2019t the sort of man who sits about waiting for others to make up their minds. He\u2019ll decide it for me if I don\u2019t do it soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm, that does pose a problem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, it does.\u201d Beatrice looked at her hands in her lap, trying to sort through her feelings. \u201cI wish I knew how he felt for me\u2014or even if he can feel.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s so cold sometimes, Lottie, as if whatever gentleness he once had, whatever capacity to love, was destroyed by his years in the Colonies.\u201d Beatrice looked at her friend to see if she understood.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know if he can love you.\u201d</p><p>Beatrice nodded miserably.</p><p>All of Lottie\u2019s animation seemed to leave her. \u201cIt\u2019s so hard to tell, isn\u2019t it? Gentlemen don\u2019t have the same thoughts and goals as we ladies.\u201d Lottie thought for a moment and then said, \u201cI\u2019m not even sure they know themselves when they love a lady or not.\u201d</p> <p>And that was the problem, wasn\u2019t it? Beatrice thought morosely. How was she to understand Lord Hope\u2019s motives when she didn\u2019t understand the man himself? Had he made love to her because he cared for her? Or for some other, more subtle male reason, perhaps even simply lust? Making the whole situation more difficult was her own desire. Deep inside, a part of her simply wanted him, whether or not he felt the same. And that, she knew, was dangerous. She risked dreadful hurt if all the emotion was only on her side.</p><p>At that moment, the carriage pulled up in front of Mrs. Postlethwaite\u2019s town house, and Beatrice\u2019s thoughts turned to other matters. \u201cDo you see Mr. Wheaton\u2019s carriage?\u201d</p><p>She glanced up and down the crowded street. Two more carriages were behind them, and a pair of burly men loitered by the house next door. Her eyes narrowed, but they looked nothing like the toughs who had attacked her and Lord Hope the other day. These men were much better dressed for one thing.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Lottie replied. \u201cBut he will\u2019ve entered through the mews so as not to draw attention to himself.\u201d</p><p>That certainly made sense. This was only the third clandestine meeting of Mr. Wheaton\u2019s Veteran\u2019s Friends Society. Had it not been a Society meeting, Beatrice probably wouldn\u2019t have gone out at all; Jeremy\u2019s death was too recent. But she was here for Jeremy in a way. He\u2019d been the one to introduce her to Mr. Wheaton\u2019s thoughts on soldiers and what happened to them after they retired from His Majesty\u2019s army. Jeremy had cared deeply for the men who had served under him. He\u2019d wanted them to retire with enough money that they wouldn\u2019t end up begging on the street. One so often saw those pitiful creatures, still in their red coats, missing limbs or an eye, sitting on corners with a tin cup in their hands. Beatrice shuddered. She felt sure Jeremy would understand her being here today.</p><p>She descended the carriage with Lottie and gave their names to the butler who answered the door. In a moment, they were being shown into a small but neat sitting room, and Mrs. Postlethwaite was greeting them.</p> <p>\u201cHow kind of you to join us, Miss Corning, Mrs. Graham.\u201d Mrs. Postlethwaite took their hands and squeezed them gently before leading them to a settee.</p><p>She was a lady of middling years, dressed always in somber gray and black, her silver hair pulled away from her face into a simple knot and covered with a cap. Mrs. Postlethwaite had lost her husband, Colonel Postlethwaite, to action on the Continent some years ago. She\u2019d been left with a comfortable annual income and time on her hands, which she\u2019d decided to put to use helping the men her husband had led. The men she\u2019d come to know over the years as she followed Colonel Postlethwaite on campaign.</p><p>Beatrice glanced about the room as their hostess led them in. Besides Mrs. Postlethwaite, there were perhaps half a dozen gentlemen of middling to elderly years. Beatrice and Lottie were the only other ladies in the room, and Beatrice was grateful that their hostess had made the case to include them in the society.</p><p>Mrs. Postlethwaite served tea and small, hard biscuits, and then Mr. Wheaton entered the room. He was a young man of average height, his light brown hair clubbed back simply without powder of any kind. As usual, he wore a preoccupied frown. Mrs. Postlethwaite had once confided that Mrs. Wheaton was in poor health and had been confined to bed for some years now. To have an ailing wife and to deal with all the business being a member of parliament entailed must be a weary burden for the poor man.</p><p>Mr. Wheaton had a sheaf of papers in his hand, and he set these down on a table before clearing his throat. The room grew quiet. He nodded in acknowledgment of their attention and said, \u201cThank you, friends, for coming today. I have some matters of import that I\u2019d like to discuss regarding the bill and the members of parliament we think we can count on to vote in its favor. Now, then . . .\u201d</p><p>Beatrice leaned forward as Mr. Wheaton outlined his plans, but a small part of her mind thought about how Jeremy would\u2019ve loved to be here. She\u2019d not fulfilled her promise to him. He\u2019d died before Mr. Wheaton\u2019s bill could be passed. She\u2019d failed in that, but she vowed to herself that she wouldn\u2019t fail the bill itself. She\u2019d do everything in her power to help the bill and all the soldiers who\u2019d fought for England. The bill would pass. She\u2019d see to it.</p><p>For Jeremy.</p><p>\u201cTHE MAN WHO led the attack on you is named Joe Cork,\u201d Vale said as he threw himself into a chair.</p> <p>Reynaud looked up from the solicitor\u2019s report he was reading and stared at his old friend. He was in a small sitting room to the back of Blanchard House, which he\u2019d commandeered as his study. There was an official study for the earl, of course, but the usurper held it at the moment, and Reynaud\u2019s solicitors were counseling patience. Thus this temporary refuge for business. He\u2019d be damned, though, if he\u2019d give up residence in his own house.</p><p>\u201cYou found him, then?\u201d he asked Vale.</p><p>Vale screwed up his mouth into a comical face. \u201cNot exactly found, no. The blighter appears to have disappeared. But several lowlifes identified him from the description given by my man, Pynch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPynch?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI say, you don\u2019t know Pynch, do you?\u201d Vale scratched his nose. \u201cI acquired him after, well, after Spinner\u2019s Falls. He was my batman in the army and now serves as a rather uppity valet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d Reynaud tapped the paper in front of him with his pencil. \u201cAnd how does this pertain to the assassin?\u201d</p><p>Vale shrugged. \u201cWell, Pynch was the one I sent to make inquiries. Amazin\u2019 what he can worm out of the most tight-lipped fellows. But it seems this Joe Cork has flown the coop. No one\u2019s seen him for several days.\u201d</p><p>Reynaud leaned back in his chair. \u201cDammit. I\u2019d hoped to find out who had hired him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a setback, I agree.\u201d Vale pursed his lips and stared at the ceiling a moment. \u201cHave you thought about hiring guards?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlready have.\u201d Reynaud sat forward. \u201cBut not for myself. For Miss Corning. They came too close to her last time. If the knife wound had been a little higher . . .\u201d He trailed off, not liking to think about it. He\u2019d dreamed about Beatrice\u2019s blood on his hands last night.</p><p>Vale\u2019s shaggy eyebrows arched up his forehead. \u201cDo you think they\u2019ll target her as well as you? Surely if you simply stay away from the gel, she\u2019ll be safe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I don\u2019t propose to stay away from her,\u201d Reynaud said.</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d Vale stared at him for a moment, and then a wide smile spread across his face. \u201cLike that, is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat,\u201d Reynaud snarled, \u201cis none of your business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIndeed?\u201d Vale was grinning like an idiot now. \u201cWell, well, well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is that supposed to mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have no idea. I just like saying it. Well, well, well. Makes one sound uncommonly insightful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot you it doesn\u2019t,\u201d Reynaud muttered.</p><p>Vale ignored him. \u201cHave you asked the question yet? I\u2019m rather good at it, if I do say so myself. I got three different ladies to agree to marry me while you were gone. Did you know? Some didn\u2019t actually make it to the altar, but that\u2019s another problem altogether. Perhaps you\u2019d like some pointers on\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would not like any pointers from you, damn your hide,\u201d Reynaud growled.</p><p>\u201cBut are you sure the chit even cares for you?\u201d</p><p>Reynaud thought back to Beatrice eagerly parting her legs for him, her eyelids lowered, her throat suffused in a blush of desire. \u201cI don\u2019t believe that\u2019s a problem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou never know,\u201d Vale said chattily. \u201cEmeline threw me over for Samuel Hartley, and the man\u2019s not nearly as handsome as I.\u201d</p><p>Reynaud blinked. \u201cYou were engaged to my sister?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t I tell you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you did not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I was,\u201d Vale said airily. \u201cNot that it lasted once Hartley put his fascinatin\u2019 hooks into her. Now, my second fianc\u00e9e threw me over for a curate.\u201d</p><p>Reynaud looked at him.</p><p>\u201cA butter-haired curate.\u201d Vale nodded. \u201cI assure you. \u2019Course, that\u2019s how I came to be married to my own sweet wife, but at the time you could\u2019ve knocked me over with a feather. I don\u2019t suppose Miss Corning knows any butter-haired curates, does she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe had better not,\u201d Reynaud growled. And right then he determined that this thing would not drag on with Beatrice. He needed a wife. She\u2019d already given herself to him. It was as simple as that.</p><p>And tonight he\u2019d prove it to her.</p><p>IN THE MIDDLE of the night, Beatrice woke and opened her eyes to a single candle shining in her bedroom. It should\u2019ve startled her\u2014frightened her, even\u2014but instead she lay quietly and watched as Lord Hope set the candle on a small table near the door.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Beatrice asked.</p><p>\u201cComing to see you,\u201d he said, equally matter-of-fact. He had on a red and black banyan, and his head was bare.</p><p>He took off the banyan.</p><p>\u201cSee you seems to be a euphemism,\u201d she observed.</p><p>He paused, his hands on the buttons of his shirt. \u201cYou\u2019re right.\u201d And he drew the shirt off over his head.</p><p>For the first time, she felt a flicker of fear. He hadn\u2019t smiled. He was serious and intent, as if he performed a grim duty.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to do this,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cIt seems I do,\u201d he replied. He sat on a chair to remove his shoes. \u201cYou seem to be uncertain of me\u2014of us together. I intend to make sure there are no uncertainties after tonight.\u201d</p><p>She noted that he made no mention of love, and she felt disappointment shoot through her.</p><p>\u201cSeducing me won\u2019t prove anything,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cWon\u2019t it?\u201d He sounded unconcerned. \u201cThat remains to be seen.\u201d</p><p>She watched him a moment as he stripped off his stockings, breeches, and smallclothes. He seemed entirely comfortable with his own nudity, but she felt her breath quicken. When he\u2019d bedded her the day before, she\u2019d been in shock, only half aware of what was going on. Now she was wide awake, her senses almost too alert to him. He stood tall and proud, his skin an even light brown over his entire body. His arms and shoulders were leanly muscled, like a laborer\u2019s. She remembered that he\u2019d told her he\u2019d had to hunt for his food. There was black curling hair on his chest, but it wasn\u2019t thick, and she could see the dark brown points of his nipples. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Her gaze wandered downward, drawn inevitably to what lay between his thighs. The hair was thick and black there, as if to highlight his cock, standing boldly. He was hugely erect, the veins of his penis standing out, the head glistening with moisture. The whole was beautiful and at the same time intimidating in his obvious intent.</p><p>When she raised her eyes to his, he was watching her. He nodded and cupped himself. \u201cThis is for you. Look your fill.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if I don\u2019t want it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you lie.\u201d</p> <p>That sent a spurt of anger through her. \u201cI think I have the ability to know when I want something or not.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cNot in this case. You\u2019re new to lovemaking. You haven\u2019t experienced a fraction of what can be between a man and a woman.\u201d</p><p>She was warm now, and wet, but she still addressed him testily. \u201cAnd if you show me all that can be and I\u2019m still not interested, will you desist then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He strolled toward her, implacably confident. \u201cYou\u2019ve given yourself to me. That choice has already been made.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut why me?\u201d She truly didn\u2019t understand. Why now? Why her? \u201cDo you love me?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLove has nothing to do with it,\u201d he said, and pulled the covers from her body. \u201cThis is much more basic than love. You belong to me, and I intend to demonstrate that fact to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReynaud,\u201d she said softly, using his name for the first time, hating the pleading in her voice. She was so disappointed that this wasn\u2019t love to him. She wasn\u2019t interested in his \u201cmore basic\u201d feeling. She wanted his love.</p><p>He climbed into the bed and reached for her chemise. She didn\u2019t resist him, because the reality was that she couldn\u2019t. He was right and a part of her acknowledged it. She had given herself to him. She did belong to him on some basic level that seemed to bypass love altogether.</p><p>And maybe, just maybe, she wanted to watch his face as he lost control in her again.</p><p>Then it was too late for analyzing and worrying. He\u2019d bared her body, and she lay before him like a feast for a starving man. He just looked for a moment, sitting beside her, not moving, only his eyes roaming over her. She felt her nipples crest as if displaying themselves for him. His face was grave. He reached out and touched her right nipple with only one finger.</p><p>Lightly. Delicately. Devastatingly.</p> <p>She swallowed, feeling the heat build at her center.</p><p>\u201cYou are so pretty,\u201d he said, his voice deep and rough. He circled that one nipple with his finger, his touch so light it might have been a feather, and she shivered. \u201cYour skin seems to glow from within, and it\u2019s soft, so soft.\u201d</p><p>His finger wandered down, lightly tracing the undercurve of her breast and then skimming over her skin to her other breast. She breathed shallowly, the very lightness of his touch making her tremble with need.</p><p>\u201cYour nipples are pink,\u201d he whispered, brushing over the tip. Her nipples were so tight they ached. \u201cBut they deepen to rose as they come erect. I wonder if I sucked them if they would turn red like cherries?\u201d</p><p>She closed her eyes, feeling that one point of contact, so slight and so erotic. This wasn\u2019t what she\u2019d expected when he\u2019d declared his intent. She thought he would act quickly, consummate his desire in fast, hard moves.</p><p>Instead this was a slow, unhurried seduction.</p><p>His finger was wandering down over her ribs, gliding over her belly, circling her navel. She sucked in her tummy; the touch was almost tickling.</p><p>\u201cSo soft,\u201d he crooned. \u201cLike velvet.\u201d</p> <p>He was trailing lower, and her whole attention was focused on that finger and where it was headed.</p><p>\u201cSpread your legs,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>Her heart leaped in alarm. \u201cI... I . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeatrice,\u201d he said darkly, \u201cspread your legs for me.\u201d</p><p>Maybe it was because her eyes were closed\u2014if they\u2019d been open, if she could see him looking at her so intimately, she wouldn\u2019t have been able to do it. But as it was, she widened her thighs.</p><p>His finger dipped into her maiden hair, stroking through it. \u201cSo pretty, so sweet. I wonder what you taste like.\u201d</p><p>And something touched her tenderly below her maiden hair, and it was soft and wet and most definitely not his finger.</p><p>\u201cReynaud!\u201d she cried.</p><p>\u201cShh,\u201d he whispered, his breath blowing across damp, excited flesh. \u201cQuiet, now.\u201d</p><p>She bit her lips, her hands clutching anxiously at the bedclothes.</p><p>His tongue probed her folds, stroking and licking. He was so close he must be able to smell her, to taste her, and she struggled between appalled horror and trembling delight.</p><p>\u201cDo you like this?\u201d he murmured. His lips brushed her with every word.</p><p>\u201cI . . .\u201d</p><p>He parted her with his thumbs and blew softly. \u201cDo you, Beatrice?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, God!\u201d</p><p>He chuckled then, like an evil demon, and said, \u201cI think you do.\u201d</p><p>Then he was flicking his tongue against her so rapidly she couldn\u2019t think, couldn\u2019t squirm away. Not that she wanted to. He was relentless, untiring and thorough, focused entirely on that one point. Just when she thought she couldn\u2019t take any more\u2014when her breath was coming in short quick pants\u2014he opened his mouth around her bud and sucked strongly.</p><p>Beatrice pressed the back of her head into the pillow, her lips opening on a soundless scream. He was pulling, tugging on that small bit of flesh, his broad hands pressed against her thighs, holding her firmly open, and she couldn\u2019t withstand the sensation. Stars imploded within her, sending flashes of delight throughout her entire body. She jerked and jerked again, and then her limbs sank, weighted with pleasurable relaxation.</p><p>She opened her eyes to see him crawling up her. First his chest and then his hips brushed against newly sensitized flesh, and then he settled his weight on her, flattening her breasts. He nudged her legs apart effortlessly.</p><p>\u201cReynaud,\u201d she breathed.</p><p>He looked into her eyes as he slid up a little, the broad head of his penis just kissing her entrance. He flexed his hips and began to breach her. Her eyes narrowed as she felt a pinch. It\u2019d been only a day since she\u2019d lost her virginity.</p><p>\u201cBeatrice,\u201d he breathed.</p><p>\u201cIt hurts,\u201d she said, her voice small.</p><p>He nodded. \u201cKeep your eyes on me.\u201d</p><p>She widened them, looking into his eyes. He had a tiny indent between his heavy eyebrows.</p><p>He shoved a little.</p><p>She felt the stretching of her inner muscles. He pressed steadily, widening her, burrowing into her flesh. Then he thrust suddenly and with definite force, and he was seated fully. She felt the pressure of his pubis against hers. His mouth thinned as if he controlled himself by only a tiny thread.</p><p>\u201cNow,\u201d he said. \u201cNow, I make love to you.\u201d</p><p>He bent and kissed her with his open mouth, his tongue conquering her lips as his penis conquered the quivering flesh between her legs. He withdrew and slid back into her, more easily this time, hitching himself up her body a little. He caught her beneath the knees and widened her legs, settling in, making himself comfortable in her body.</p><p>She moaned and moved beneath him. For, unlike the previous night, what he was doing to her now began to feel good. More than good.</p><p>She slid her hands to the back of his head, rubbing the bristling hair there. She felt full, heavy, as if waiting for something. He still kissed her, and she nipped at his lip, provoking a growl from him.</p><p>He quickened his thrusts.</p><p>She grasped his shoulders, slippery from sweat, and hung on, urging him with her mouth and hands. More. More. More.</p><p>Until she crested, suddenly and without warning, a blissful, glorious explosion of pleasure. She would\u2019ve shouted had her mouth not been full of his tongue. He stiffened and lifted himself up, and she saw that he had reached his point as well. His nostrils were flared, his teeth gritted and bared. He thrust home one last time, shuddering, and then he let his head hang, his arms straight and holding up his upper body.</p><p>He inhaled deeply.</p><p>She kneaded the muscles of his back, wanting still to feel this connection.</p><p>He raised his head and she saw his face. Stark. Uncompromising. And without a trace of pity.</p><p>\u201cYou are mine,\u201d he said.</p><p>Chapter Twelve</p><p>Longsword and the princess entered the castle\u2019s gates together, but the minute their feet touched the ground, a thorny vine leaped up, faster than a bolt of lightning. Higher and thicker it grew until a giant, thorny hedge so entirely surrounded the castle\u2019s keep that not a stone could be seen. Longsword began to hack at the hedge, but as soon as he cut a branch, another one grew in its place.</p><p>\u201cIt is impossible!\u201d the princess cried.</p><p>But Longsword took a deep breath and ran at the hedge, swinging his sword faster than the eye could see. He slashed so quickly that the blade of his sword glowed white-hot, and as it cut, it seared as well so that the branches could not grow again. In a minute more, Longsword had cut a path through the magical hedge....</p><p>\u2014from Longsword</p><p>\u201cDid you know that Lottie Graham has left her husband?\u201d Adriana asked as she forked up a piece of fish at dinner. She looked at it critically and said, \u201cDo you think he\u2019s taken a mistress? Or two? Because most men do take a mistress at one time or another, and I think the practical wife just doesn\u2019t notice, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Hasselthorpe took a drink of wine, boggling a bit at the thought of Adriana lumping herself together with \u201cpractical\u201d wives. They sat in their town-house dining room tonight, a rather overdecorated room featuring gold putti and pink marble. He didn\u2019t bother answering the question, because she rarely needed anyone else\u2019s help in her conversations. This was handy, especially on the rare occasions when they dined just the two of them, for he had no need to follow the conversation.</p><p>And indeed she continued after swallowing. \u201cI can\u2019t think of another reason for her to leave Mr. Graham. He is so handsome, and every time I see him, he compliments me on my appearance, and I do like a gentleman who can turn a pretty phrase.\u201d</p><p>She poked her fish and frowned. \u201cI don\u2019t see why fish should have so many bones, do you?\u201d</p><p>Hasselthorpe, who\u2019d been contemplating Blanchard\u2019s lessening odds of keeping his title, looked up rather irritably. \u201cWhat are you talking about, Adriana?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFish,\u201d his wife said promptly. \u201cAnd their bones. They have so many, and I really don\u2019t see why. They live in the water.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll creatures have bones.\u201d Hasselthorpe sighed.</p><p>\u201cNot worms,\u201d his wife said. \u201cNor jellyfish nor snails, although they do have shells, which I suppose are very like bones, on their outsides.\u201d</p><p>He winced. Why must she always blather about nonsense?</p><p>\u201cBut I\u2019m not sure a shell is quite the same as a bone on the inside.\u201d She scowled quite adorably down at her haddock. \u201cAnd, in any case, I still don\u2019t understand why they should have so many and they be always waiting to catch in one\u2019s throat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cQuite.\u201d Hasselthorpe gave up trying to follow his wife\u2019s mind and instead drank some more wine. Sometimes it helped get him through these meals. How had Hope survived that second assassination attempt? Dammit, why the man should survive two attempts in as many weeks and not a scratch on him was\u2014</p><p>\u201cDo you suppose he doesn\u2019t wash?\u201d</p><p>Hasselthorpe paused, his wineglass halfway to his lips. \u201cThe fish?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, silly!\u201d Adriana trilled gaily. \u201cMr. Graham. Some gentlemen seem to think washing their persons is merely a monthly or even yearly chore. Do you suppose Mr. Graham is one of them?\u201d</p><p>Hasselthorpe blinked. \u201cI\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I can\u2019t think why else Lottie would leave him.\u201d Adriana frowned. \u201cHe\u2019s quite handsome and rather charming, and I haven\u2019t heard any tales of him keeping one mistress, let alone two, so I think it must be the washing, or rather not washing, don\u2019t you?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He sighed. \u201cAdriana, my dear, as usual, you\u2019ve quite lost me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave I?\u201d She smiled at him. \u201cBut I didn\u2019t mean to. And you considered one of the leading lights of the Tories, too!\u201d</p><p>Her ripple of laughter was enough to send a less-strong man into raving fits. As it was, Hasselthorpe merely smiled tightly at his spouse. \u201cVery amusing, my dear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, aren\u2019t I?\u201d she said complacently, and went back to poking at her fish. \u201cI think it must be the reason you love me.\u201d</p> <p>Hasselthorpe sighed. Because despite her lack of wits, her irritating conversation, and her execrable decorating style, Adriana was quite right about this one matter.</p><p>He did love her.</p><p>BEATRICE SHOULD\u2019VE BEEN suspicious when Reynaud sat down to dine with her and her uncle that night. But alas, she was so caught up in keeping her expression bland that she didn\u2019t even think to wonder what he was doing there. So when he made his request over the fish, she nearly choked on her wine.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you say?\u201d Beatrice gasped when she\u2019d caught her breath.</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t addressing you,\u201d the odious backstabber said.</p> <p>\u201cWell, you\u2019ll certainly have to consult with me about the matter eventually,\u201d she said tartly.</p><p>A muscle in Reynaud\u2019s jaw flexed. \u201cI doubt\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d roared Uncle Reggie.</p><p>Beatrice\u2019s head swung toward her uncle in alarm. His face had gone the color of claret. \u201cPlease don\u2019t excite yourself\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not enough that you must have my title, but now you want to take my niece as well,\u201d Uncle Reggie bellowed. He thumped a fist on the table, making the silverware jump.</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t accepted Lord Hope\u2019s proposal,\u201d Beatrice said soothingly.</p> <p>\u201cBut you will,\u201d Reynaud said, crushing what little peace she might\u2019ve gained.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you threaten my niece!\u201d Uncle Reggie shouted.</p><p>Reynaud\u2019s lips thinned. \u201cI don\u2019t threaten; I merely state a fact.\u201d</p><p>And they were off again. Really, she might not be in the room for all the attention they paid her. She was like an old bone for two dogs to fight over. Beatrice sighed and sipped her wine again, taking a surreptitious glance at Reynaud. He\u2019d left her the night before, soon after their lovemaking, and she hadn\u2019t seen him all day. He wore the white wig tonight and a dark wine-red coat that made his tanned skin and dark brows and eyes exotically elegant. The iron cross earring swung against his jaw as he tilted his head mockingly at her uncle. It made him look a bit like a pirate, she decided.</p><p>He caught her eye and winked. The rest of his face was impassive, and it was done so quickly that she almost thought she imagined it. Did he really want to marry her? The notion sent an odd shaft of warmth to her center.</p><p>Until Uncle Reggie said, \u201cYou only want to marry my niece to bolster your claim that you aren\u2019t mad. It\u2019s another scheme to steal my house and title!\u201d</p><p>Well, that was certainly dampening. Beatrice stared fixedly at her wineglass. She would not weep before these two buffoons.</p><p>Reynaud\u2019s upper lip curved in a sneer as he leaned toward her uncle. \u201cIt\u2019s my house. How many times must I repeat it? The title, the house, the monies, and, yes, now Beatrice. They\u2019re all mine. You hold them by the tips of your fingers, and they\u2019re all sliding away from you, old man. That\u2019s why you\u2019re so angry.\u201d</p> <p>Beatrice cleared her throat. \u201cI don\u2019t know if either of you are aware, but I am sitting right here.\u201d</p><p>Reynaud lifted an eyebrow at her, his black eyes glinting. \u201cAnd would you care to join this conversation? Perhaps list one or two reasons a match between us is inevitable?\u201d</p><p>How dare he? The threat was implicit that he\u2019d inform Uncle Reggie that he\u2019d bedded her if she balked at this proposal.</p><p>Beatrice lifted her chin, addressing her remarks to Uncle Reggie, although she still held Reynaud\u2019s gaze. \u201cI\u2019m sure Lord Hope would be amenable to some sort of compensation for your stewardship of the earldom, Uncle.\u201d</p><p>A corner of Reynaud\u2019s mouth quirked as he mouthed, \u201cTouch\u00e9.\u201d</p><p>But Uncle Reggie roared, \u201cBe damned afore I accept help from this popinjay!\u201d</p><p>Beatrice sighed. Gentlemen could be so extraordinarily pigheaded sometimes. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be help, Uncle; it would be compensation for years of service to the title. Really, it\u2019s only fitting.\u201d</p><p>Reynaud leaned back in his chair, watching her speculatively. \u201cWhatever makes you think I\u2019d give anything to this usurper of my title?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, fitting or not, I\u2019ll not accept it.\u201d Uncle Reggie pushed back his chair with a thump. \u201cI\u2019ll leave you, Niece, to the company of this man you\u2019ve chosen over me.\u201d</p><p>And with that, he left the room.</p><p>Beatrice looked down at her plate, trying to conceal the hurt she\u2019d felt at her uncle\u2019s words.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s an old fool,\u201d Reynaud said softly.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s my uncle,\u201d Beatrice replied without looking up.</p><p>\u201cAnd because of that, I should reward him for stealing my title?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She finally inhaled and met his eyes. \u201cYou should gift him with a small remuneration, because it would be the right and honorable thing to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd if I don\u2019t give a damn about honor?\u201d he asked softly.</p><p>She watched him, lounging in his seat, his hand on the stem of his wineglass, idly twirling it. But she knew he was far from idle. He\u2019d maneuvered her here to this spot, this confrontation as deftly as a chess master cornering his opponent\u2019s queen. And why not? a small part of her whispered. If she was Reynaud\u2019s wife, she would be in a much better position to urge him to vote for Mr. Wheaton\u2019s bill.</p><p>And she could press for concessions before surrender.</p><p>Beatrice leaned back in her chair, mimicking his pose. \u201cThen you might do it for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMight I?\u201d he said. He contemplated her, as if weighing her worth against that of his pride.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said firmly, \u201cyou might. You might also offer Uncle Reggie permanent residence here in this house should you regain your title.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what would be the benefit to me of this magnanimous gesture?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know full well what the benefit would be,\u201d she said, tired suddenly of this game. \u201cDon\u2019t play with me.\u201d</p><p>He took a sip of his wine and set down the glass with finality. \u201cCome here.\u201d</p><p>She rose and circled the table to stand before him. Her heart was beating fast and hard, but she tried to regulate her breathing. Tried not to show how desperately he affected her.</p><p>He pushed his chair from the table and spread his legs. \u201cCloser.\u201d</p><p>She stepped between his legs, almost touching him, the blood rushing in her ears.</p><p>He looked up at her, a conquering warrior. \u201cKiss me.\u201d</p><p>She inhaled and then bent, placing one hand on his shoulder. Her lips brushed his, and she could not control their trembling. She straightened and looked at him.</p><p>\u201cMore,\u201d he said.</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cNot here. The servants will return soon to clear the meal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen where?\u201d His eyelids drooped lazily. \u201cAnd when?\u201d</p><p>In answer, she held out her hand, for she didn\u2019t trust her voice. Her action went against everything she\u2019d ever been taught about how a lady should behave. She\u2019d been told this was wrong. That it would only lead to sorrow and disgrace. But her heart seemed to be telling her otherwise, and she had no one else to turn to anymore. Jeremy was dead. Uncle Reggie had made clear his displeasure with her, and Lottie was too wrapped up in her own life right now.</p><p>Which left only herself to depend upon.</p><p>He placed his hand in hers, and she gave a gentle tug to make him stand up. She led him from the room without saying anything. The hall was deserted; Uncle Reggie didn\u2019t like servants hanging about during the evening meal. She went quickly up the stairs, aware of Lord Hope\u2019s footsteps, steady and almost ominous behind her, but she didn\u2019t look back. She took him to her own room and then paused beside the door.</p><p>\u201cWait here,\u201d she said, and slipped inside. Quick was in her room, as she was every night, waiting to help her ready for bed.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019ll be all,\u201d she said to the maid. \u201cAnd, Quick?\u201d</p><p>The maid turned toward her. \u201cMiss?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe sure you don\u2019t see anything in the hall.\u201d</p><p>Quick\u2019s eyes widened but she was far too good a servant to comment. She merely curtsied and left the room.</p><p>Beatrice took a deep breath and went to the door, opening it. He was outside, leaning against the wall, waiting patiently.</p><p>\u201cCome in,\u201d she said, and he straightened.</p><p>SHE STOOD TALL and prim and invited him into her room. He\u2019d been there twice before, of course, but not at her invitation.</p><p>And that, it seemed, made all the difference.</p><p>He could feel his pulse pounding at his temple and lower down at the base of his cock. He was already erect, already ready for her, but he moved slowly. The wolf never wanted to frighten the deer until it was ready to pounce.</p><p>She turned and went to the fire, stirring it with a poker. \u201cWill you undress?\u201d Her hand might be steady, but her voice was high and thready.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you?\u201d he asked, his own voice deep.</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d She set aside the poker and reached for the laces of her bodice.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d In two strides he was beside her, staying her hands. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you undress me?\u201d</p><p>She looked at him, her face pinkening into a blush, her bottom lip caught between her teeth. He wanted to bite that lip himself, wanted to catch her in his arms and bear her to the bed, a warlord with a prize. But he needed to have her come to him of her own volition. True, he\u2019d coerced her, but she\u2019d led him here. He\u2019d take that small bit of free will on her part.</p><p>Beatrice set her hands on his coat, slowly, carefully pushing it back over his shoulders. He moved his arms to help her take off the garment, but otherwise he simply watched her. As a young officer in His Majesty\u2019s army, he\u2019d been to brothels in London and the New World. Had sampled the favors of accomplished courtesans. Yet the sight of this properly brought-up woman taking off his coat was far more erotic than anything he\u2019d ever seen at a brothel.</p><p>She folded his coat and carefully set it aside. Then she stood on tiptoe and pulled off his wig. He ran his hands over his head, scrubbing at the stubble of his hair.</p><p>\u201cI confess it made me sad the day you cut your hair,\u201d she said quietly.</p><p>A half smile curved his lips. \u201cYou\u2019d rather I sport that wild mane?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She reached up to smooth her palms over his head. \u201cBut maybe a little more hair than this. Your long hair softened your aspect a bit. I never really realized until you cut it all off. Without it, you look so... ruthless.\u201d</p><p>But he was ruthless. Didn\u2019t she know that yet? He didn\u2019t say the words, merely watched her as she bent her head over the buttons of his waistcoat. The only sounds in the room were her breathing and the slide of fabric over the bone buttons. She reached the end and pushed the waistcoat off his shoulders. She laid the waistcoat aside and hesitated for a moment, staring at the expanse of his white shirt. Had her feet grown cold? Only two days before, this woman had been a virgin, and now he was demanding that she undress him. He should take pity on her.</p><p>He grasped her hand and brought it to his chest. \u201cThe shirt next, I think.\u201d</p><p>She began on the buttons without comment, though her breath was coming faster. The brush of her fingers, even with the fine linen in between his skin and hers, was a torture. She undid the last button, and he raised his arms so she might draw the shirt off over his head.</p><p>She licked her lips and glanced shyly at him from under her brows. \u201cEverything?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cEverything.\u201d</p><p>She nodded, inhaling as if bracing herself, then reached for the fall of his breeches. He placed his hands on her shoulders as she worked, watching the top of her head rather than where her hands were. She knelt to pull down his breeches, and he stepped out of his shoes and stockings as well. When she reached for his smallclothes, her hands shook.</p><p>\u201cAre you frightened?\u201d he murmured.</p><p>She paused and looked at him. \u201cNo.\u201d</p> <p>And he had to clench his jaw. That frankness, those wide gray eyes above freckled cheeks, looking at him so innocently, without guile or disguise, nearly undid him.</p><p>She took off his smallclothes, and he kicked them aside, entirely nude now.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want me to do?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He looked at her, kneeling at his feet, her face so close to his crude erection, and several thoughts came to his mind, but in the end, he held out his hand to her. \u201cCome here.\u201d</p><p>She rose, placing her hand in his, and he led her to the bed. He threw back the covers and laid himself down on his back, propped against several pillows. He pulled her down beside him so she was sitting on the bed, her gown bunched around her folded legs. \u201cMake yourself comfortable.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI am.\u201d</p><p>He wanted to smile but found that the rigidity of his muscles prevented him. \u201cThen touch me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere?\u201d She placed her palm on his chest, trailing her fingers through his chest hair.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d He watched her face as she explored, circling a nipple. She looked intent, solemn like a little girl mastering a needlework stitch.</p><p>\u201cDoes it feel sensitive? Like mine?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He half closed his eyes. \u201cIt\u2019s sensitive.\u201d</p> <p>She nodded and stroked lower, following the trail of his body hair to below his navel. Here she hesitated again, looking uncertain.</p><p>He waited, not prompting her anymore. Slowly she ran her fingers through his pubic hair, drawing ever closer to his cock. When at last she touched him\u2014too delicately, too softly\u2014he let out a sigh.</p><p>Her eyes darted to his face, watching him as she traced up his shaft. He held her gaze, though he wanted to close his eyes at the sensation of her warm fingers on his flesh. When she reached the head of his cock, she looked down again, bending closer as if fascinated.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s so hard,\u201d she murmured, circling the helmet. \u201cDoes it hurt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d His mouth twisted. \u201cNot as long as it\u2019s eventually assuaged.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes rounded. \u201cYou mean it stays like this until\u2014\u201d</p><p>He laughed rustily\u2014it was that or howl. \u201cNo. It, ah, goes away after a bit if there\u2019s no stimulation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStimulation.\u201d Her brows drew together as she watched her fingers wrap about his length.</p> <p>\u201cThe sight of a pretty woman, the sound of her voice, the feel of her hand,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cAny pretty woman?\u201d She frowned.</p><p>Ah, it wasn\u2019t funny, not with his cock in her small, sweet hands, but his mouth quirked. \u201cSome more than others.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm.\u201d</p><p>He cleared his throat. \u201cYou can stroke it.\u201d</p><p>She tentatively rubbed him with her fingers.</p><p>\u201cMore firmly,\u201d he murmured, and wrapped his hand about hers to show her. He brought both their hands up his cock, strongly enough to move his skin over the stony flesh beneath, and then down again. He let go of her hand.</p><p>She did it again.</p><p>\u201cYe-es,\u201d he hissed.</p><p>\u201cYou like that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod, yes.\u201d</p><p>She worked him, and he lay like a pasha among the pillows, letting her pleasure him. He watched her through slitted eyes, her prim hair still in its bun, her serious expression, and the shockingly raw sight of his bare cock between her hands. And he might\u2019ve let her complete him, but then she leaned closer and with one finger touched the tip of his prick, where the clear liquid had begun to leak. He was strong and had quite a bit of willpower, but he wasn\u2019t made of stone.</p><p>He jackknifed up, grabbed her about her middle\u2014ignoring her startled squeak\u2014and twisted to put her facing the headboard of the bed.</p><p>\u201cHold on there,\u201d he ordered in a guttural voice.</p><p>Thank God she obeyed without questioning what he was about, because he wasn\u2019t going to last long in any case. She was up on her knees, and he simply flipped her skirts up over her hips. He ran his hands over her sweet arse, reveling in the feel of silky flesh.</p><p>\u201cPart your legs for me,\u201d he said, and she widened her stance with a gasp.</p><p>He touched her there, between her thighs where she was the softest, the most tender, and he parted the wet folds, revealing the gleaming center. He heard her whimper. That\u2019s what he wanted, his woman, bent over, wet and waiting for him. He took his cock in hand and guided himself to her. Christ! She was so tight, so slick. He felt sudden moisture in his eyes, and he closed them so she wouldn\u2019t see. This was mating, a good and proper fuck, nothing else.</p><p>But even as he worked his flesh into hers, he knew that he lied to himself. Everything about her\u2014her scent, her feel, her warm body, and her small panting sounds\u2014meant something more to him. Home. She was home and he\u2019d returned to her.</p><p>He pushed the odd thought aside as he shoved the rest of his length into her. He grasped the headboard on either side of her arms and enclosed her within his embrace. She shivered, and somehow that little movement was the final straw. He began thrusting, hard and fast, the feel of her slippery flesh around him, holding him so tightly, sending him completely out of control. She arched her hips, pushing back at him, and he leaned forward, biting her nape to keep her steady. She gave a cry, high and helpless, and then her cunny was flexing about him, milking his cock as she came.</p><p>He growled deep in his throat and felt his balls draw up tight as he released himself within her. Even then he didn\u2019t stop but kept humping her as he filled her with his seed. When finally he fell to the side, every bone in his body was liquid. He had only enough presence of mind to clutch her to his chest as she snuggled against him.</p><p>And then he fell asleep.</p><p>HER BEDROOM WAS nearly black when Beatrice woke. Her stays were poking into her side. She\u2019d fallen asleep fully dressed. She turned her head and saw the glow of the fireplace embers and then felt the shift as Reynaud moved beneath her hand. Carefully, quietly, she rose from the bed. He lay, sprawled nude, on her sheets as if he had every right. She smiled a little sadly. He\u2019d probably say this room and this bed belonged to him, too.</p><p>Beatrice shook down her skirts and left the room. No doubt she was quite rumpled, and she wouldn\u2019t like to meet anyone in the hallways, but it must be past midnight by now, and she didn\u2019t think she would. Farther down the hall was Uncle Reggie\u2019s room, the crack beneath the door dark. She felt a pang of regret that they\u2019d parted on such a sour note at dinner. Would he ever come to terms with Reynaud\u2019s reappearance? Would he forgive her for the choices she\u2019d made\u2014and would make in the future?</p><p>She\u2019d lived in this house for years, and she had no need of a candle, even in the near total darkness. She felt her way to the main staircase and crept down like a mouse. On the main level, a footman passed in the hall below, making his way toward the kitchen and the servant\u2019s quarters. Beatrice stood still on the stairs, waiting patiently, and then descended silently once he\u2019d disappeared into the depths of the house. She stopped in the dining room to light a candle from the embers in the fireplace, and then she took it to the blue sitting room. Here she set the single candlestick on a small table. She sank into a settee facing the door and curled her feet beneath her on the seat.</p><p>The portrait of Reynaud was directly in front of her. Beatrice rested her chin in her hand, looking at him. All those nights, sitting with him, dreaming of what the man behind the laughing eyes was really like. And now she knew. She knew him, had been his lover, and he was nothing like what she\u2019d imagined in her girlish fantasies. He was hard, sometimes cruel, driven to obtain what he wanted; he was maddening and frustrating. He was also intelligent, caring of those he considered his own\u2014like Henry\u2014complex and baffling and an exquisite lover.</p><p>He was a passionate man.</p><p>Even if that passion wasn\u2019t for her, she admired it.</p><p>Beatrice stared into those black eyes, so physically similar and so spiritually apart from the living, breathing man. Marriage to him would not be easy. There was a very good chance that it might turn into a disaster, in fact. But to save Uncle Reggie, she would take that chance.</p><p>The sitting room door opened and Reynaud stepped in, unconsciously standing next to his painted image. He wore his breeches and shirt. His gaze found her, and then he turned to see what she\u2019d been looking at. He studied the portrait of himself for a long moment before looking back at her.</p><p>\u201cAre you all right?\u201d</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>He paced toward her, his eyes never leaving her form. When he was directly in front of her, he stopped and held out his hand. \u201cWill you marry me, Beatrice?\u201d</p><p>She placed her hand in his. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Thirteen</p><p>Before Longsword and the princess stood a huge black tower\u2014the castle\u2019s keep. Longsword advanced upon the tower warily, the princess behind him, but the tower remained ominously quiet. A single huge wooden door stood on the tower\u2019s facade, its surface scarred and charred as if it had withstood some terrible battle. Longsword pulled open the door, and beside him Princess Serenity gasped.</p><p>For inside the tower, her father the king lay bound in chains. Around the king flew three dragons, each larger than the last. And the smallest dragon was twice as big as the one Longsword had killed just the day before....</p><p>\u2014from Longsword</p><p>The freshly turned earth was already frosted over, hard, frozen, and final. Beatrice bent and placed her handful of Michaelmas daisies on the grave. There wasn\u2019t a stone yet, merely a wooden marker. The words jeremy oates had been crudely scrawled on it.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to marry him,\u201d she whispered to the pitiful marker.</p><p>The words were carried away by the wind, whipping through the small graveyard. As if to emphasize her sorrow, the day was overcast and gray. Jeremy\u2019s parents had chosen to bury him in a little churchyard outside of London proper. It wasn\u2019t even a family plot. Perhaps they thought by hiding him so far out of the way, they could forget him altogether. Jeremy would\u2019ve smiled and reminded her that a tiny graveyard was just as good as a cathedral when one was dead.</p><p>Beatrice shook her head and frowned fiercely to hold back the tears. Jeremy wouldn\u2019t have cared, but she did. This was no way to memorialize a good man. She closed her eyes for a moment, simply remembering him, and the tears came anyway, whether she wanted them to or not.</p><p>When she finally opened her eyes again, her face was cold and wet, and her head was beginning to ache, but oddly she felt better.</p><p>She wiped her cheeks and glanced at the churchyard gate. Reynaud leaned against the stone wall there, waiting patiently for her. The drive here had taken over an hour, and he hadn\u2019t made any complaints. Although he hadn\u2019t visited her room in the week since she\u2019d agreed to marry him, Reynaud had made sure to attend her when he could. Of course, he was a busy man. He was in daily consultation with solicitors about the estate and his title, and he met with his friend Lord Vale very often as well. Beatrice frowned. She wasn\u2019t quite sure what they discussed, but she was glad that they seemed to have recovered from their initial animosity.</p><p>She knelt to touch the frozen earth over Jeremy\u2019s grave one last time, and then she stood and dusted her hands. In the spring she\u2019d bring some lily-of-the-valley pips to plant here. That would keep him company. Beatrice began picking her way back to the carriage and Reynaud. The little churchyard was sadly neglected, the stone path overgrown with weeds. The wind blew her skirts against her legs, and she shivered as she neared Reynaud.</p><p>\u201cFinished?\u201d He put a hand under her elbow to steady her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYes.\u201d She looked up into his stern face. \u201cThank you for bringing me.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cHe was a good man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, he was,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>He handed her into the carriage and then climbed in after her, knocking against the ceiling to signal the coachman. She watched out the window as they pulled away from the cemetery, then looked at him. \u201cYou\u2019re still set on a marriage by special license?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019d like to be already married by the time I go before parliament,\u201d he said. \u201cIf it bothers you, we can plan a celebratory ball in the new year.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. After the passion of his seduction, the practicality of his plans for their marriage was slightly dampening. She remembered Lottie\u2019s words about a gentleman filling a position with his choice of wife. Wasn\u2019t that what she herself was doing? Reynaud needed her as his wife so that he could convince others he was sane. Nathan needed Lottie as his wife to further his career. The only difference was that Lottie had believed her husband loved her.</p><p>Beatrice had no such illusions.</p><p>She straightened a bit and cleared her throat. \u201cYou never told me how you eventually escaped the Indians. Did Sastaretsi give up his hatred of you?\u201d</p><p>He flattened his mouth impatiently. \u201cDo you really wish to hear this tale? It\u2019s boring, I assure you.\u201d</p> <p>His stalling tactics only made her curiosity keener. \u201cPlease?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery well.\u201d He looked away and was silent a moment.</p><p>\u201cSastaretsi?\u201d she prompted softly.</p><p>\u201cHe never did give up his hatred of me.\u201d Reynaud was staring out the window, his long nose and strong chin in profile against the wine-red squabs behind him. \u201cBut that first winter was hard, and it was all we could do to simply find enough food to feed everyone. I was an able-bodied hunter, if not a very good one at first, so I think he laid aside his animosity for a little while. We were all weak from hunger anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow dreadful.\u201d She looked down at her lap, examining her fine kid gloves. She\u2019d never wanted for food in her life, but she\u2019d seen beggars on the street now and again. She tried to imagine Reynaud with that gaunt face, that glittering, desperate expression in his black eyes. She didn\u2019t like the thought of him suffering so terribly.</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t amusing, certainly,\u201d he said. \u201cI remember once finding a she-bear. They crawl into the biggest trees, into holes in the wood, to sleep the winter away. Gaho\u2019s husband showed me how to look for the claw marks on tree trunks that meant a bear lay above. After we\u2019d killed the bear, they skinned a part of it and ate the fat without waiting to light a fire and cook the meat.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDear God.\u201d Beatrice wrinkled her nose in disgust.</p><p>He looked at her. \u201cI ate it as well. The flesh steamed in the cold winter air, and it tasted of blood, and I gulped it down anyway. It was life. We\u2019d had no food for three days prior to that.\u201d</p><p>She bit her lip and nodded. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cI survived.\u201d</p><p>He folded his arms across his chest then and leaned his head against the squabs, his eyes closed as if he slept, though she doubted he did.</p><p>She bowed her head. He\u2019d survived, and she was glad, truly, but at what cost? What he\u2019d endured had changed him. It was as if he\u2019d passed through a fiery furnace, burning away all the parts of him that had been soft or sentimental, leaving a fire-hardened inner core, impervious to pain or feeling, perhaps impervious to love as well.</p><p>She shivered at the thought. Surely he felt something for her?</p><p>They spent the rest of the carriage ride home in silence, and it was only when the carriage slowed before Blanchard House that she glanced out the window.</p> <p>She leaned a little forward. \u201cThere\u2019s another carriage blocking the way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs there?\u201d Reynaud said absentmindedly, his eyes still closed.</p><p>\u201cI wonder who it could be?\u201d Beatrice mused. \u201cNow a gentleman is getting out, and he\u2019s handing down a very elegantly dressed lady. Oh, and there\u2019s a small boy as well. Reynaud?\u201d</p><p>She said the last because he\u2019d suddenly sat up and twisted around to look out the window.</p><p>\u201cChrist,\u201d he breathed.</p><p>\u201cDo you know them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Emeline,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s my sister.\u201d</p><p>HE\u2019D DREAMED OF this moment for nights on end during his captivity: the day when he\u2019d finally see his family again. The day when he\u2019d see Emeline.</p><p>Reynaud climbed slowly down from his carriage, turning to help Beatrice alight. Her face was excited, beaming with curiosity, wonder, and joy, as if she reflected all the many emotions he ought to be feeling right now. He hooked her hand through his elbow and approached the small group of people gathered on the top step of Blanchard House. The man was turned toward them with a face that looked impassive from this distance, but it was the woman Reynaud focused on. She\u2019d only just now noticed their presence and was turning quickly. Her face went blank, and then an expression of rapturous joy spread over it.</p><p>\u201cReynaud!\u201d she cried, and started down the steps. The man\u2014it must be Hartley\u2014caught her under the arm, slowing her, and for a moment Reynaud felt anger rise in his breast.</p><p>Until he saw why Hartley urged her to slow down.</p><p>\u201cOh, my,\u201d Beatrice breathed.</p><p>Emeline was quite obviously enormously pregnant. Seven years ago, she\u2019d been a young mother and a bride. Now she was married to a different man and was expecting her second child. He\u2019d missed so much.</p><p>So much.</p><p>He and Beatrice reached the bottom of the steps just as Emeline and Hartley made the street. Emeline stopped suddenly, staring at him, then reached out a hand, touching his cheek in wonder.</p><p>\u201cReynaud,\u201d she breathed. \u201cReynaud, is it you?\u201d</p><p>He covered her fingers with his hand, blinking back the moisture in his eyes. \u201cYes, it\u2019s me, Emmie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Reynaud!\u201d And suddenly she was in his arms, and he was awkwardly hugging her close around the bulk of her belly. She felt so sweet, his little sister, and he closed his eyes, simply holding her for a moment.</p><p>She pulled away at last and smiled, the same smile she\u2019d had since the age of ten, and then frowned. \u201cOh, fustian! I\u2019m going to cry. Samuel, I need to go inside.\u201d</p><p>Hartley whisked her inside the town house, and Reynaud and Beatrice followed more sedately. The boy trailed his mother, but he darted glances over his shoulder at him. Reynaud remembered Daniel as an infant, hardly able to walk the last time he\u2019d seen him. Now he was almost as tall as his mother.</p><p>Reynaud nodded at the boy. \u201cI\u2019m your uncle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Daniel said, dropping back to walk beside them as they moved down the hall. \u201cI\u2019ve got a pair of your pistols.\u201d</p><p>Reynaud\u2019s eyebrows rose. \u201cDo you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d The boy looked a bit worried. \u201cI say, can I keep them?\u201d</p><p>Beside him, Beatrice smothered a giggle. Reynaud turned a quelling look on her before addressing the boy. \u201cYes, you may.\u201d</p><p>They were in the sitting room now, and Beatrice left his side to order tea and some type of refreshments.</p><p>\u201cDid the Indians draw those birds around your eye?\u201d the boy asked.</p><p>\u201cDaniel.\u201d Hartley spoke for the first time, his voice even. He said nothing more, but the boy ducked his head.</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d he mumbled.</p><p>Reynaud nodded and took a seat. \u201cYes, the Indians tattooed my face.\u201d</p><p>Beatrice returned at that moment and met his gaze. Her eyes were filled with sympathy, and the sight warmed his chest. She sat down next to him and tucked her hand under his.</p><p>She cleared her throat. \u201cI\u2019m Beatrice Corning.\u201d</p><p>He squeezed her hand in gratitude.</p><p>Emeline sat a little straighter, rather like a birding dog at the sight of a grouse. \u201cTante Cristelle said you were engaged to be married to my brother.\u201d</p><p>Beatrice glanced at him and then said brightly, \u201cYes. We hope to have a small wedding soon. Miss Molyneux didn\u2019t tell us you were coming. Were you expected?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEvidently not.\u201d Emeline pursed her lips. \u201cI wrote, of course, to say that we\u2019d be coming, but the letter must\u2019ve gone astray. Samuel has business to attend to in England, and I\u2019d hoped to visit with Tante. As it was, we quite surprised her with our arrival in London, and then she startled us with her news that Reynaud was alive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWonderful news.\u201d Beatrice smiled.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Emeline cast a quick, curious glance between him and Beatrice. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, but aren\u2019t you related to the present Earl of Blanchard?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe usurper,\u201d Reynaud growled.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m his niece,\u201d Beatrice said.</p><p>\u201cAnd my soon-to-be wife,\u201d he stated.</p><p>\u201cHmm. About that,\u201d Emeline murmured. \u201cTante said you\u2019d only been home for less than a month.\u201d</p><p>Beatrice stirred beside him. \u201cI\u2019m afraid Reynaud swept me off my feet.\u201d</p><p>Emeline was frowning now, which irritated Reynaud. Seven years apart and his baby sister thought she could tell him how to live his life? He opened his mouth but felt a sharp elbow in his side. Surprised, he glanced down at Beatrice, who was looking quite sternly at him.</p><p>As if by some feminine cue, the talk turned to lighter matters then. Hartley explained his business dealings in Boston and London, and Emeline told the story of how they\u2019d met and what had happened since Reynaud\u2019s absence, her news little different than that he\u2019d heard from Tante Cristelle, but it was wonderful to hear her voice. Reynaud let the talk flow about him, content to simply sit and listen to his sister and Beatrice. This was his family now.</p><p>Finally, Emeline declared herself weary, and Hartley leaped to help her up from her seat.</p><p>As the ladies made their farewells, Hartley turned to Reynaud and said quietly, \u201cI\u2019m glad you made it home.\u201d</p><p>Reynaud nodded. He was home now, wasn\u2019t he? \u201cI hear you ran through the woods to bring back the rescue party for those who were captured.\u201d</p><p>Hartley shrugged. \u201cIt was all I could do. Had I known they\u2019d taken you alive, I would\u2019ve searched until I\u2019d found you.\u201d</p><p>It was an easy vow to make, seven years after the fact, but Hartley\u2019s face was grave, his eyes serious and intent, and Reynaud knew the other man meant it.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t know,\u201d he said, and held out his hand.</p><p>Hartley grasped his hand and shook it firmly. \u201cWelcome home.\u201d</p><p>And Reynaud could only nod again and look away, lest he lose his composure entirely.</p><p>Reynaud escorted Emeline and her family to the front door, then returned to the sitting room to find Beatrice pouring herself another cup of tea. He paced to the mantel, paused to glance at a small shepherdess\u2014had it been his mother\u2019s?\u2014then went to the windows. All the while, he felt Beatrice\u2019s gaze on him.</p><p>She set her cup down on the table beside her and eyed him. \u201cAre you feeling well?\u201d</p><p>He scowled out the window. \u201cWhy do you think something is wrong?\u201d</p><p>She raised her eyebrows. \u201cForgive me, but you seem restless.\u201d</p><p>He inhaled, watching a carriage rumble by below. \u201cI don\u2019t know. I have Emeline back, my family back, but something\u2019s still missing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps you need time to adjust,\u201d she said quietly. \u201cYou\u2019ve been seven years away, lived a very different lifestyle. Perhaps you simply need to settle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat I need is my title,\u201d he growled, turning to her.</p><p>She looked at him thoughtfully. \u201cAnd when you have the title and all that goes with it, you\u2019ll be content?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you suggesting otherwise?\u201d</p><p>She glanced down at her teacup. \u201cI\u2019m suggesting that you might need more than a title and money to be happy.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>His head reared back as if struck. What was this? Why did she challenge him now? \u201cYou don\u2019t know me,\u201d he said as he strode to the door. \u201cYou don\u2019t know what I need, so please refrain from speculating, madam.\u201d And he left her there.</p><p>A WEEK LATER, Beatrice hid her trembling hands in the folds of her wedding dress. It was quite a smart frock. Lottie had said that just because she was having a hurried wedding didn\u2019t mean she couldn\u2019t have a new dress for it. So she wore a lovely shot silk that changed from green to blue as she moved. But despite the beauty of her new gown, she couldn\u2019t control the trembling of her fingers.</p><p>Perhaps this was normal wedding-day nerves. She tried to pay attention to the bishop marrying her and Reynaud, but his words seemed to run together into a senseless stream of droning sound.</p><p>She very much hoped she wasn\u2019t about to faint.</p> <p>Was she doing the right thing? She still didn\u2019t know even as she stood at the altar. Reynaud had promised to care for Uncle Reggie, had promised to let him live in Blanchard House no matter the outcome of the fight for the title. She\u2019d made Uncle Reggie safe, and perhaps that was reason enough to marry this man, even if he didn\u2019t love her.</p><p>He didn\u2019t love her.</p><p>Beatrice frowned down at the posy of flowers in her hands. She\u2019d wanted a man to love her for herself, but she was marrying a man out of cold calculation instead. Was that enough? She wasn\u2019t sure. Reynaud might never soften his heart sufficiently to love her. In the last few weeks, he\u2019d seemed harder than ever, more focused on his goal of attaining his title and the power that went with it. If he never came to love her, could she endure this marriage?</p><p>But then Reynaud turned to her and placed a simple gold ring on her finger and kissed her gently on the cheek. Suddenly the whole thing was over, and it was too late for second thoughts or regrets. Beatrice drew a deep breath and placed her hand on Reynaud\u2019s elbow, holding more tightly than she normally might have.</p><p>He leaned his head closer to hers. \u201cAre you all right?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes. Quite.\u201d A wide smile seemed to be frozen on her face.</p><p>He glanced at her dubiously as he led her through the small crowd of well-wishers. \u201cWe\u2019ll be home soon, and if you\u2019d like, you can go lie down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, but we have the wedding breakfast!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the wedding night,\u201d he whispered in her ear. \u201cI don\u2019t want you too ill to enjoy that.\u201d</p><p>She ducked her head at that to hide a pleased smile. The fact was, he hadn\u2019t done more than kiss her chastely on the lips since their engagement, and a small part of her had begun to wonder if he\u2019d already lost interest.</p><p>Evidently not.</p> <p>He handed her into the carriage to the cheers of the crowds and then hastily entered. He smiled at her as the carriage pulled away. \u201cDoes it feel different, being married?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She shook her head, then thought of something. \u201cAlthough, I suppose I\u2019ll have to get used to being Lady Hope, won\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>He scowled. \u201cIt should be Lady Blanchard.\u201d He looked out the window. \u201cAnd it will be soon, too.\u201d</p><p>There was nothing more to say to that, so they rode in silence until they came to the town house. Many of the guests had already arrived and were entering the town house as Beatrice descended the carriage. She mounted the steps of Blanchard House with Reynaud, feeling odd. This was still her uncle\u2019s home, but very soon it would be hers and Reynaud\u2019s only\u2014if he won back his title. She would be reversing positions with Uncle Reggie, and the thought was not a comfortable one.</p><p>Inside, the dining room had been laid ready for a feast. Yards of frothy pink fabric lined the table, and for a moment Beatrice felt for how horrified Uncle Reggie would\u2019ve been at the expense. He sat at the head of the table already, looking rather subdued and sad. He refused to meet her eyes.</p><p>Reynaud sat her next to Uncle Reggie as was proper and then was distracted by a guest. For a moment, Beatrice was quiet.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s done, then,\u201d Uncle Reggie said.</p><p>She looked up and smiled. \u201cYes.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCan\u2019t back out now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>He sighed heavily. \u201cI only want the best for you, m\u2019dear. You know that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I do, Uncle,\u201d she said softly.</p><p>\u201cThe blighter seems to care for you.\u201d He placed his hands on the table and looked at them as if he\u2019d never seen the like before. \u201cI\u2019ve noticed how he watches you sometimes, as if you\u2019re a jewel he\u2019s afraid of losing. I hope he treats you right. I hope you\u2019re very happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d Beatrice felt silly tears\u2014so close to the surface all day\u2014start in her eyes.</p><p>\u201cBut if he doesn\u2019t,\u201d her uncle said, in a low voice, \u201cyou always have a place with me. We can move out of this damned house, find another by ourselves.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Uncle Reggie.\u201d She caught her breath on a laugh that was almost a sob. Dear, dear Uncle Reggie, so disapproving of her choice yet unwilling to abandon her entirely.</p><p>She was dabbing at her eyes with a handkerchief when Reynaud took the chair next to her. He scowled at her. \u201cWhat has he said to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShh.\u201d Beatrice glanced at Uncle Reggie, but he was talking to Tante Cristelle. \u201cHe\u2019s been very nice.\u201d</p><p>Reynaud grunted, not looking particularly convinced. \u201cHe\u2019s an old blowhard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s my uncle and I love him,\u201d Beatrice said firmly.</p><p>Her new husband merely grunted.</p><p>The breakfast was long and sumptuous, and when it was finally over, Beatrice was ready for a nap. But she rose and prepared to say farewell to her guests.</p><p>Near the end of the line were Lord and Lady Vale. The viscount started talking to Reynaud, and for a moment Beatrice and Lady Vale were together alone.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s very pleased with this union,\u201d Lady Vale said quietly.</p><p>Beatrice looked at her, surprised. \u201cViscount Vale?\u201d</p><p>The other woman nodded. \u201cHe\u2019s been quite worried about Lord Hope. This whole business of your husband returning alive has been a shock to him\u2014a good shock, of course, but a shock nonetheless.\u201d</p><p>Beatrice raised her eyebrows.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s worried about how Lord Hope has changed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s darker,\u201d Beatrice murmured.</p><p>Lady Vale nodded. \u201cSo Vale tells me. In any case, he was very happy that you consented to marry Lord Hope.\u201d</p><p>Beatrice wasn\u2019t sure what to say to that, so she merely nodded.</p><p>The viscountess hesitated a moment. \u201cI wonder . . .\u201d</p><p>Beatrice looked at her. \u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>The other woman seemed a tad embarrassed. \u201cI wonder if I might give you a rather unusual wedding present?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a job, actually, so if you don\u2019t want it, please do say so, and I won\u2019t be put out.\u201d</p><p>Beatrice was intrigued now. \u201cTell me, please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a book,\u201d Lady Vale replied. \u201cI was told some time ago by a friend that you bound books as a hobby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, this has been something of a project of mine,\u201d Lady Vale said almost shyly. \u201cIt\u2019s a book of fairy tales that originally belonged to Lady Emeline\u2014and your husband.\u201d</p><p>Beatrice leaned forward. \u201cIt belonged to Reynaud?\u201d</p><p>Lady Vale nodded. \u201cEmeline found it last year, and she asked me to translate it\u2014it was in German. Once I translated it, I had it transcribed by a friend, and I was wondering if you might like to bind it for me? Or rather for Emeline. I\u2019d like to give it to her eventually so she can have it for her own children. Will you help me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Beatrice murmured, taking the other woman\u2019s hands. She was filled with a kind of pleased delight, as if Lady Vale had somehow given her an entry into the St. Aubyn family. \u201cI\u2019ll be happy to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBEATRICE LOOKS LOVELY,\u201d Nate said as he sidled up to Lottie after the wedding breakfast.</p><p>\u201cYes, she does,\u201d Lottie replied without looking in his direction. \u201cI hadn\u2019t realized you were invited to the wedding.\u201d</p><p>She stood just inside the front doors of Blanchard House, waiting for her carriage to be brought round. Even though she made sure not to glance at him, she was vividly aware of his deep blue coat and breeches, the white of his wig and neck cloth making him look very nice indeed. She was probably the only one aware that the cuff of that particular coat was fraying and needed mending. She\u2019d forgotten to point it out to his valet before she\u2019d left, and apparently no one else in the house had noticed.</p><p>His handsome face darkened. \u201cDidn\u2019t you? I could\u2019ve sworn I saw you glancing my way at the church.\u201d</p><p>She smiled tightly. \u201cPerhaps you thought everyone was watching you? You are such an ambitious young member of parliament.\u201d</p><p>Nathan\u2019s lips tightened but he merely said, \u201cIt\u2019s a good match. Beatrice seemed very happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm. But then it\u2019s only been three hours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour cynicism ill becomes you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, that\u2019s right. You prefer a lady to pretend happiness,\u201d she said sweetly.</p><p>\u201cActually, I prefer a lady who is happy in reality, not just pretense,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cThen perhaps you should\u2019ve paid more attention to your lady,\u201d she snapped.</p><p>\u201cIs that it?\u201d He moved closer to her, almost touching her shoulder with his chest, speaking low and intensely. \u201cWould you come back if I promise a trip to the theater or ballet? Perhaps bring you sweets and flowers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t paint me a little child.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen tell me what you want,\u201d he hissed, his normally congenial face twisted with anger. \u201cWhat did I do that was so wrong, Lottie? What\u2019ll make you come back? Because the gossips are in a frenzy over your defection. My reputation\u2014my career\u2014can\u2019t take much more of this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, your career\u2014\u201d she started.</p><p>But he interrupted her, something he\u2019d never done before. \u201cYes, my career! You knew when you married me that I was a career politician. Don\u2019t act the wounded innocent now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI knew you had a career,\u201d she said quietly. \u201cWhat I didn\u2019t know was that it consumed your life\u2014your heart\u2014so much that you had no room for a wife.\u201d</p><p>He pulled back to eye her. \u201cI don\u2019t know what you mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you?\u201d Lottie shot back. \u201cWell, perhaps you should think about it a bit, then.\u201d</p><p>And she walked out the door before he could reply\u2014or before she could burst into tears.</p><p>Chapter Fourteen</p><p>At the sight of Longsword and the princess, the three dragons flew at them, enormous claws extended, fire roaring from their jaws. Longsword braced himself and swung his mighty sword. THWACK! The smallest dragon fell to the ground, screaming in pain from a mortal wound to its breast. But the remaining dragons separated and attacked him from both sides. Longsword slashed at the one before him even as he felt the rake of fiery claws on his back. He turned, falling to one knee. The remaining dragon\u2014the biggest dragon\u2014shrieked in triumph and swooped down to finish the kill....</p><p>\u2014from Longsword</p><p>By the time night fell, Beatrice was a bundle of nerves. She was no longer a virgin, so perhaps she shouldn\u2019t have been nervous\u2014after all, what did she have to fear? But despite their physical familiarity, she felt in some ways that she knew her husband less now than she had weeks ago.</p><p>Perhaps one never really understood a man, even after one had accepted him into one\u2019s body. It was a gloomy thought to have on one\u2019s wedding night, and Beatrice frowned as she removed the pearl drops from her ears. The earrings had been Aunt Mary\u2019s, and she wondered what that imminently practical woman would\u2019ve thought of her marriage. Would she have approved of Reynaud? She wouldn\u2019t have liked the high-handed way he\u2019d treated Uncle Reggie; that was certain. Beatrice felt a twist of remorse. Had this day been one enormous mistake? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>On that thought, Reynaud entered the room. Beatrice dismissed Quick with a soft word. She\u2019d moved into the countess\u2019s rooms, unused since Reynaud\u2019s mother had occupied them. Uncle Reggie still had possession of the earl\u2019s room, at least in name\u2014he\u2019d left the house for the night. Beatrice had half expected Reynaud to take advantage of her uncle\u2019s absence to assume control of the master bedroom. But he hadn\u2019t.</p><p>Once again he\u2019d surprised her.</p><p>He strolled toward her now wearing only his breeches and shirt under a deep gold banyan. That, together with the earring swinging near his jaw and the tattoos of the flying birds, made him look like some exotic prince. One that might lounge on mountains of silken pillows while he was administered to by a harem of dark beauties. Beatrice shied at the thought. She was no harem beauty.</p><p>Perhaps that was why her voice seemed a little high as she said, \u201cThere\u2019s some wine and biscuits and also some sweetmeats on the table there by the fire. Perhaps you\u2019d like me to pour you a glass?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo.\u201d He slowly shook his head as he advanced on her. \u201cI\u2019m not thirsty for wine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Oh, goodness. She should make some sophisticated comment, something that would make him think her more than a rather naive lady of not very much experience.</p><p>A corner of his mouth twitched up, and now he looked like a rather dangerous exotic prince. Beatrice backed up a step, and her bottom hit the bed.</p><p>\u201cNervous?\u201d he asked, sounding as if he were trying to be innocent and failing abysmally.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said, and then honesty compelled her to immediately amend her statement. \u201cWell, yes. Yes, I am a bit nervous. I\u2019m not really the seductive type.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said almost tartly. \u201cI\u2019m practical and straightforward, and I\u2019ve never had gentlemen crowding about me.\u201d</p><p>He cocked an eyebrow, which, what with the tattoos and all, made him look positively diabolical. \u201cNo admiring swains, no lovers prostrate with despair?\u201d</p><p>She winced. \u201cI\u2019m afraid not. I\u2019m just an ordinary English girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank God,\u201d he said, and he was suddenly so close to her that she could feel the heat of his body, even through her chemise and his banyan. \u201cI\u2019m glad no other man saw your sweet inner core. I think I might have to kill him if there was another man.\u201d</p><p>He said it lightly, but Beatrice shivered at the dark undertone to his language. Was he merely seducing a new wife on their wedding night, or was he speaking some kind of truth?</p> <p>Was he really attracted to her?</p><p>Oh, how she wished he was! To be wanted simply for herself and no other reason was a desperate desire within her. But she was distracted from the thought, for he\u2019d bent his head, lowering it so that he could lay his lips just at the juncture of her shoulder and neck. The sensation was an odd one, part ticklish, part erotic. She actually felt the frisson spike from her shoulder to the juncture of her thighs. Dear God, if he could do this with only a kiss on her shoulder, for goodness\u2019 sake, she had no hope. How could she be an equal in this marriage if his mere touch turned her into a puddle of yearning?</p><p>She couldn\u2019t. She was going to have to take her ordinary English-girl ways in hand and turn them around somehow. She might not be able to tell him that she loved him, but she could certainly show him with her body.</p><p>With that thought in mind, she reached for her husband. Her hands slid along the silk of his banyan, feeling the heat of his body beneath. He\u2019d ordered her to undress him that last time. This time she\u2019d wait for no instructions. She peeled the banyan from his shoulders. He was still kissing her neck, but he made a small growling sound in his throat at her action.</p><p>She took that as encouragement.</p><p>Next she unbuttoned his shirt, glad to see again the expanse of his chest. He had a lovely chest, wide and muscled and still tanned a dark brown. She urged him to raise his arms and drew off the shirt. Perhaps it was because she was trying to go slow, to seduce, but this time she felt something on his back that she hadn\u2019t the last time. She threw his shirt down next to his banyan and ran her hands around his sides to his back. There were bumps there. How odd. She frowned, exploring them with her fingers. It was almost as if\u2014</p><p>He took her hands away from his back, holding them between their bodies as he kissed her passionately. His tongue invaded her mouth, and she pursed her lips about it, sucking. He let go of her hands, and she slid them over his chest, glorying in the feel of his skin. Her hands wandered lower and reached the waistband of his breeches. Blindly she began searching for the buttons, a job made harder when he began caressing her breasts with his hands.</p><p>She tore her mouth away from his, panting. \u201cYou\u2019re distracting me, doing that.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat, this?\u201d he asked innocently, and then pinched her nipples.</p><p>\u201cOh!\u201d She got the first two buttons opened on the fall of his breeches and inserted her fingers inside, brushing against hard flesh.</p><p>Reynaud muttered under his breath, then abruptly let her go to shuck his breeches and smallclothes. \u201cLet\u2019s continue this on the bed.\u201d</p><p>He backed to the bed, pulling her with him, and then lay against the pillows. She climbed in beside him, sitting on her knees. He stretched, his arms curving over his head. The hair under his arms was black and thick, and his upper arms bulged with the flex of his muscles. Beatrice felt her belly warm at the sight. She lowered her eyes. His penis was straight now but not yet fully erect. The last time they\u2019d made love, he\u2019d directed her explorations. Right now, though, she wanted to do only what she wished.</p><p>She leaned a little forward and stroked over his cock, and it bobbed in acknowledgment. She knew that he liked a firm touch\u2014he\u2019d shown her that before. She circled him, just under the swollen cap, measuring his width with her thumb and forefinger.</p><p>He shifted beneath her. \u201cCome here.\u201d</p><p>She crawled up him then, this big man who belonged to her now, and when she reached his face, she cupped him between her palms and kissed him. His experiences might\u2019ve made him hard, cruel even on occasion, but she rejoiced in them if they brought him home alive.</p><p>So she kissed him, deeply, moving against him, and he arranged her as he liked, pulling her legs over his hips on either side and drawing them up until she nearly sat on him. She pulled back to look a question at him and he nodded.</p><p>\u201cRide me.\u201d</p><p>She lifted herself up and drew off her chemise so that she might be as naked as he. This was the consummation of their marriage, and she wanted to meet him as an equal, bare before God. When she lowered herself, her wet folds met his hardness.</p><p>She looked at him. \u201cYou do it this time. Put it in me.\u201d</p><p>He met her eyes and reached down between them, his hand right there, brushing against her.</p><p>\u201cLike this?\u201d he asked, and she felt that first push, that stretching and yielding as his head breeched her.</p><p>\u201cYes, like that,\u201d she whispered, entirely enthralled by what he did.</p><p>His lips tightened.</p><p>She leaned a little forward, grasping his shoulders, and then he shoved up and suddenly was all the way in. They were joined together. Bound by their bodies and the vows they\u2019d made. She trembled a little at the thought, and her eyes met his. Did he feel the importance of the occasion as well? She couldn\u2019t be sure; his eyes were black and fathomless, impossible to read.</p><p>\u201cRide me,\u201d he said again.</p><p>So she did. She rose up carefully, letting him slide from her depths and then shoved herself down, gasping as he refilled her. His eyes half lowered, his upper lip drawn back from his teeth. He palmed her breasts with his big hands, flicking over her nipples with his thumbs, and she fought the urge to close her eyes. This was important. This was an act of holy significance, and she wanted to be aware of every bit of it.</p><p>She leaned forward, grinding herself against him, and quickened her pace. It was coming soon now, that awful bliss. She could feel her body tightening as she rode toward her release. His cock was hard and slick, and she swiveled on it, grinding her folds against him, pleasuring herself even as she pleasured him. His head was arched back, his eyes slitted. She darted forward to lick his nipple and he moaned. She watched him as his clever black eyes unfocused. Watched him as he opened his mouth and shouted. He arched under her, his body a taut bow, and she clutched his shoulders to keep her seat even as she spasmed, sweet pleasure flooding her belly.</p><p>She fell against his heaving chest, openmouthed, and tasted the salt on his skin even as another wave hit her. She closed her eyes and buried her face against his strong neck.</p><p>It was almost perfect.</p><p>She lay against him, on him, and felt his chest rise and fall beneath her. She could stay here forever, lost in the blissful aftermath, but eventually the outer world would intrude. So she asked the question she\u2019d been withholding since he took off his shirt.</p><p>\u201cHow did you get the scars on your back?\u201d</p><p>HE SHOULD\u2019VE REALIZED she\u2019d seen through his prevarication, but her question came as a shock nonetheless. For a moment, he considered ignoring it or even pretending he didn\u2019t know what she was asking about. But they were married now. She\u2019d see it soon enough\u2014and for many years to come, God willing.</p><p>So he braced himself and said, \u201cI\u2019ll tell you once, but I don\u2019t ever want to speak of it again. Is that understood?\u201d</p><p>He thought she might pout\u2014or worse, be hurt by his curt tone\u2014but she simply looked at him with those wide gray eyes. \u201cVery well. May I see?\u201d</p><p>He scowled, looking away, but then abruptly rolled so that his back was to her. She gasped and then was silent.</p><p>He closed his eyes, imagining what she saw. He knew from looking in the mirror\u2014once and only once\u2014that his back was a mass of scars. Thin white ones carved through the tan of his skin. Thicker, reddened scars, the ones she\u2019d felt before, roped from midback to his right hip.</p><p>She asked, \u201cHow did this happen?\u201d</p><p>He turned back to her, his eyes still closed. \u201cIt was the second winter I was with Gaho\u2019s family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me,\u201d she said simply, and he opened his eyes to see her watching him. Her face was unlined, pure and beautiful, her gold hair still pulled back. She\u2019d covered her breasts with the sheets, but her white shoulders were still revealed.</p><p>\u201cWe had more food come spring.\u201d He tilted his head to focus on the bed curtains. \u201cThe bears and deer might be thin from the winter, but they were easier to hunt. And the women gathered berries and vegetables from the woods and fields once the green things began to grow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThings were better,\u201d she said quietly. There was no impatience in her voice, though he was avoiding the reason for this tale.</p><p>\u201cThey were better, yes,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I should\u2019ve been, too. There was finally plenty to eat after a winter of starvation. But the summers can be very hot in that part of the world. Hot and damp and I think the combination crept into my lungs. I became very ill with fever and purging. Gaho and the other women of her family tended me, but there are days I don\u2019t remember.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow horrible,\u201d Beatrice said, lacing her fingers with his. \u201cBut you survived.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI survived, but I almost didn\u2019t,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd then . . .\u201d Odd, he could feel the sweat start at his back at just the memory. He breathed deeply, fighting down the nausea that climbed his throat. He was so ashamed of the event.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>He drew a breath. \u201cGaho left the camp to attend a ceremony. She took with her both daughters and their spouses and her husband. I was too ill to travel. Only I, a few old men, a female slave, and Sastaretsi stayed behind. He said he had had an argument with the chief of the tribe Gaho and her family were to visit, but I think he stayed behind solely to kill me.\u201d</p><p>Beatrice was silent, but she squeezed his fingers.</p><p>Reynaud closed his eyes, trying to keep his voice steady, remembering the horror of being in another\u2019s power. \u201cMy being alive deeply wounded Sastaretsi\u2019s pride. He took it as a personal affront that I hadn\u2019t been tortured to death for his greater glory. When we were so close to death that winter, I think he bided his time because the band needed another able-bodied hunter. But when I grew ill that summer, he saw his chance.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat did he do?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cHe came for me in the night. I was tied down and still weak from fever. I had no chance, but I fought anyway. I knew that to be in his clutches would be fatal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut he caught you despite your resistance?\u201d she asked softly.</p><p>He nodded. The words seemed stuck in his throat, and his chest hurt as if he could not draw breath. The feel of another man\u2019s hands on his throat, the knowledge that he wasn\u2019t strong enough to dislodge him. Suddenly he smelled bear grease, hot and sour and strong. Impossible. He was imagining it. No one smeared themselves with bear grease in England. But Sastaretsi had in that land so far away. The stink had been thick in his nostrils that night.</p> <p>\u201cReynaud?\u201d he heard Beatrice call. \u201cReynaud, you need not go on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he gasped. \u201cNo. I\u2019ll tell it this once and never again.\u201d</p><p>He lay for a moment, just breathing, trying to get the smell of bear grease out of his nose. Then he said, \u201cHe took me and bound me to a stake, and he beat me. Over and over. He broke sticks against my back, carved long lines into my flesh, and when I\u2019d pass out, he\u2019d wake me to start it all over again.\u201d</p><p>She was silent, both of her hands wrapped around his now.</p><p>\u201cHe meant to kill me. To torture me until I begged and then burn me alive.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut you didn\u2019t die,\u201d Beatrice said. She sounded urgent. \u201cYou survived.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I survived,\u201d he said. \u201cI survived by refusing to utter a sound. No matter what he did to me, no matter how he beat me or made my blood flow, I remained silent. And then a miracle occurred.\u201d</p><p>He looked at her, his sheltered wife. He should\u2019ve never told her this story, never let her hear about the darkness he\u2019d been through, the shame.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGaho and her family returned,\u201d he said simply, the words in no way conveying the wonder he\u2019d felt at the event. \u201cShe told me later that she\u2019d had a dream. In the dream, a snake was wrestling with a wolf, and the snake had its fangs sunk into the wolf\u2019s neck. She said that the voice of her father told her that the snake must not win. When she woke, she cut short the festivities and came home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did she do?\u201d Beatrice asked.</p> <p>Reynaud\u2019s mouth twisted. \u201cShe saved me from death. She freed me, gave me water, washed and bound my wounds, and on the morning of the next day, she gave me a knife and bid me to do what I must.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did you have to do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKill Sastaretsi,\u201d he said. \u201cI was weak, suffering from the loss of my blood and the illness, but I had to kill him. He knew what I would do\u2014even without Gaho\u2019s permission, I could not let him live\u2014and he could\u2019ve run in the night, but instead he stayed to fight me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you won,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cYes, I won,\u201d he said, feeling no victory at all.</p><p>She sighed and settled against his shoulder. \u201cI\u2019m glad. I\u2019m glad you killed Sastaretsi. I\u2019m glad you survived.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he said softly. \u201cAs am I.\u201d</p><p>If he hadn\u2019t survived, she wouldn\u2019t be in his arms right now. That at least was good. Reynaud closed his eyes and felt the warm softness of his wife, the scent of woman and flowers surrounding him. He listened as her breathing evened and deepened as she fell asleep, and he gave thanks that he could experience this moment, this woman.</p> <p>Perhaps it made everything that had come before worth it.</p><p>\u201cYOU RISE EARLY for a man newly married,\u201d Vale said cheerfully a week later. \u201cPerhaps you got too much sleep last night.\u201d</p><p>Samuel Hartley, walking on the other side of Vale, snorted. All three men were strolling a fashionable London street to discourage eavesdroppers, their pace swift, for the wind was quite chilly.</p><p>Reynaud scowled at them both. It was a beautiful morning, and he\u2019d left his new wife sleeping in their warm bed so he might come consult with these two jesters.</p><p>And they didn\u2019t even appreciate his sacrifice. \u201cWe can give you some help, if you need it,\u201d Vale continued, as mindless as a jackdaw, \u201con the wonders of marital bliss. At least I can.\u201d</p><p>He looked at Hartley in question.</p><p>\u201cAs can I,\u201d the Colonial replied. His wide mouth was straight, but something about it made it seem like he was laughing.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad to hear it considering that you\u2019re married to my sister,\u201d Reynaud replied with an edge to his voice.</p><p>Hartley\u2019s expression didn\u2019t change, but his body seemed to grow more tense. \u201cYou should have no worries that I\u2019ll take care of Emeline.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood to know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow, now,\u201d Vale said in a sickeningly sweet voice reminiscent of a nursery nanny. \u201cI already gave him a drubbing for courting Emmie.\u201d</p><p>Reynaud raised his eyebrows. \u201cYou did?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe did not,\u201d Hartley said even as Vale nodded happily. \u201cI threw him down the stairs.\u201d</p><p>Vale pursed his lips and looked skyward. \u201cNot my recollection, but I can see how your memory of the event may\u2019ve become hazy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow, look here,\u201d Hartley began quietly, a thread of amusement in his voice.</p><p>\u201cGentlemen,\u201d Reynaud said, \u201cwe need to come to the crux of the matter, for it is indeed only a week after my wedding, and my lovely wife will eventually expect me to wait attendance on her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery well.\u201d Hartley nodded, serious now. \u201cWhat have you discovered since I last saw you, Vale?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are rumors both that the Spinner\u2019s Falls traitor was a nobleman and that his mother was French,\u201d Vale said promptly.</p><p>Hartley cocked his head. \u201cAnd where did you get this information?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMunroe,\u201d Reynaud said, Vale having informed him at their previous meeting. \u201cThe first bit of information he had from a colleague in France; the second\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe got it from Hasselthorpe,\u201d Vale said, \u201calthough he didn\u2019t deign to share the information with me until a month or so ago.\u201d</p><p>Hartley looked at him curiously. \u201cWhy ever not?\u201d</p><p>Vale looked embarrassed.</p><p>\u201cI expect because of me,\u201d Reynaud said. \u201cMy mother was French.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d Hartley nodded.</p><p>\u201cNo doubt he thought that if I was already dead, there was no point in casting doubt upon my name,\u201d Reynaud said drily. \u201cBut since it happens that I\u2019m not dead . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow we need to think of who else among the survivors had a French mother,\u201d Vale said grimly. \u201cBecause whoever it is must be the traitor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut there isn\u2019t anyone else,\u201d Hartley said.</p><p>Reynaud grimaced. \u201cIf you\u2019re suggesting it\u2019s me\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous,\u201d Hartley snapped. \u201cJust listen. There\u2019s you, me, Vale here, Munroe, Wimbley, Barrows, Nate Growe, and Douglas\u2014I\u2019ve talked to them all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Vale said. \u201cAnd all are from London and probably had ancestors running about in blue at the time of the Roman invasion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThornton, Horn, Allen, and Craddock are dead,\u201d Hartley continued, \u201cbut we investigated them thoroughly. None of these men had French mothers. There simply isn\u2019t anyone else who survived who could be the man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen perhaps it was someone killed,\u201d Reynaud said softly. \u201cThough that doesn\u2019t make sense.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho else had a French mother?\u201d Vale asked.</p><p>\u201cClemmons had a French sister-in-law,\u201d Hartley said thoughtfully.</p><p>\u201cDid he?\u201d Vale stared. \u201cI had no idea.\u201d</p><p>Hartley nodded. \u201cHe mentioned it once. A younger brother\u2019s wife, but she is dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t fit in any case,\u201d Reynaud said impatiently. \u201cNot unless Munroe\u2019s source was inaccurate.\u201d</p><p>Hartley shook his head.</p><p>\u201cWe need to talk to Munroe, see if he has any recollection,\u201d Reynaud said.</p><p>\u201cI sent a messenger to him some weeks ago,\u201d Vale said. \u201cBut the man hasn\u2019t responded.\u201d</p><p>Reynaud grunted. Munroe was well known as a recluse, but they needed his memories, too. Perhaps he\u2019d have to take Beatrice on a trip to Scotland.</p><p>But first there were more pressing matters to attend to.</p><p>\u201cI plan to plead my case before the special committee of parliament tomorrow,\u201d he said to the other two. \u201cSo that I can regain my title as the Earl of Blanchard. And I\u2019d like your help.\u201d</p><p>Vale raised an eyebrow. \u201cYou have it, of course, but what do you have in mind?\u201d</p><p>Reynaud glanced about them to make sure no one was paying special attention to their conversation, then said, \u201cI have an idea . . .\u201d</p><p>BEATRICE LAID OUT her bookbinding tools carefully. She was always excited to begin a new project. She liked the anticipation of taking either an old and falling-apart book and putting it in order or taking what was essentially a sheaf of papers and turning it into a lovely book. It was almost an art, really. And she liked her tools and materials to be just so. The different-sized bonefolders aligned perfectly, the needles in their little box, the spools of thread lined up along the upper edge of her worktable. Later she\u2019d look through her supplies of pretty paper and calf\u2019s hide, but for the moment she was interested only in cutting, folding, and sewing.</p><p>She hummed softly to herself as she worked, quite content, and thus it was with some surprise that she heard the clock in the hall and realized that it was almost time for dinner. Footsteps and male voices sounded in the hall, and she cocked her head, listening for her husband\u2019s voice. She looked up when the door to her little sitting room opened.</p><p>\u201cAh, there you are,\u201d Reynaud said as he walked in.</p><p>She smiled because it seemed she could not help but smile like a fool when she saw her husband. Every day she was married to him, she became more enthralled with him\u2014and the knowledge made her uneasy. He\u2019d still not said that he loved her, and he rarely showed her affection except in the privacy of their bedroom. Perhaps that was normal in a society marriage. Perhaps most gentlemen had trouble expressing affection.</p><p>God, she hoped so.</p><p>Beatrice looked down blindly at her worktable. \u201cDid you enjoy your visit with Lord Vale?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEnjoyed may not be exactly the right word.\u201d He came to stand beside her table. \u201cWhat is this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA book I\u2019m binding for Lady Vale.\u201d She looked up at him. \u201cIt\u2019s for your sister. Apparently, your nanny read it to you both when you were children.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIndeed?\u201d He bent over her shoulder, studying the pages she was sewing. \u201cI\u2019ll be damned. It\u2019s the tale of Longsword.\u201d A wondering smile lit his face. \u201cThat was a favorite of mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps I should make a book for us as well, then,\u201d Beatrice said lightly.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell . . .\u201d She looked down at her hands, carefully drawing the thread. \u201cFor our children, naturally. I\u2019m sure you\u2019d like to read them the book you enjoyed as a child.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cIf you wish.\u201d</p><p>Beatrice wrinkled her nose, frowning fiercely to keep back silly tears. Childish of her to feel hurt at his dismissive tone. She drew a breath. \u201cWhat did you talk about with Lord Vale?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy title,\u201d he said. \u201cI intend to get it back tomorrow, if you remember.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d She busied herself with her tools. He sounded so sure, but the rumors of his madness still swirled about the streets of London.</p><p>\u201cAnd once I obtain it, this house will be mine alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope you\u2019ll not mind Uncle Reggie and me staying here as well.\u201d She tried to say the words lightly.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be silly.\u201d He frowned. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not silly,\u201d she said, pulling her thread too tight. \u201cIt\u2019s just . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d he snapped.</p><p>She laid down her work and looked at him, drawing a deep breath. \u201cYou\u2019re obsessed with regaining your title, your monies, your lands, everything you lost, in fact, and I understand that, but there\u2019s more than that for you to think about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d he asked, his face sharp and lined.</p> <p>Beatrice lifted her chin. \u201cHave you thought about what you\u2019ll do once you become the earl?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll manage my estates, attend to my land and investments.\u201d He waved an impatient hand. \u201cWhat else do you suggest I do?\u201d</p><p>She laid a hand on her worktable, clutching the edge.

He was dismissing her and her thoughts out of hand. \u201cDo you? All I\u2019ve heard you talk about is your house, your monies, your lands. Have you no thought of how you\u2019ll live your life once you already have all those things? You\u2019ll sit in the House of Lords. You\u2019ll be able to vote on bills before parliament, even champion your own if you wish.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou talk to me like I\u2019m an infant, Beatrice,\u201d he snapped. \u201cWhat are you trying to get at?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a bill that\u2019ll be presented tomorrow,\u201d she said before she could lose courage. \u201cMr. Wheaton\u2019s veteran\u2019s pension bill. It would provide for soldiers who are no longer in His Majesty\u2019s army, give them a pension so they wouldn\u2019t have to beg on the street\u2014\u201d</p><p>He waved a dismissive hand. \u201cI don\u2019t have the time right now to\u2014\u201d</p><p>She slammed her hand down on her desk, making the book slide to the floor. He turned, looking at her in astonishment.</p><p>Beatrice drew herself up. \u201cWhen will you have the time, Reynaud? When?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve told you,\u201d he said coldly. \u201cAfter I am certain of my title.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019ll just suddenly start caring for others then? Is that it?\u201d She\u2019d begun to shake. This discussion was no longer about Mr. Wheaton\u2019s bill. It\u2019d become bigger somehow. \u201cTell me, Reynaud, do you love me?\u201d</p><p>He cocked his head, eyeing her warily. \u201cWhy are you asking me now?\u201d</p><p>Hot tears stung her eyes, but she kept them open, staring at him. \u201cBecuase I think you\u2019ve kept your emotions under such tight rein for so long that you no longer know how to let them loose. I don\u2019t think you can care for others at all.\u201d</p><p>And she walked from the sitting room.</p><p>Chapter Fifteen</p><p>The princess shrank in fear, but though he knelt on one knee, Longsword did not flinch. He met the dragon\u2019s charge with the steel of his blade. Once, twice, thrice, he swung his mighty sword, and when at last the dust had cleared and all was silent again, there lay the great dragon, dying at his feet. And as the beast died, its form changed until a horrid hag lay in its place, for it was the evil witch herself who had assumed the shape of a dragon.</p><p>Well! The princess was quite pleased, I can tell you. She rushed to release her father the king. When it was made known to him that Longsword had by himself defeated the evil witch, the king was happy indeed to give his only child as a reward.</p><p>And so it was that Longsword married a princess royal....</p> <p>\u2014from Longsword</p><p>It was well after midnight by the time Reynaud joined her in their bed. Beatrice lay still, feigning sleep. It was her wifely duty to let him make love to her if he so desired, but she certainly had no desire at the moment. Not when they\u2019d argued. He probably hated her now for the blunt things she\u2019d said, but she\u2019d had to say them.</p><p>She\u2019d married a man who thought only of himself.</p><p>So she stared into the darkness and breathed evenly and slowly, in and out, without hitch, as if she was deep in slumber. She listened as he undressed\u2014the rustle of fabric, a soft mutter when he bumped into something\u2014and she\u2019d never felt so lonely in her life.</p><p>He blew out his candle, and the bed dipped and shook as he climbed in. The bedclothes tightened on her shoulder as he pulled them over himself, and then he lay still. She stared into darkness. The minutes ticked by, and for a bit she thought he might\u2019ve fallen asleep.</p><p>But then he said, \u201cBeatrice.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t move.</p><p>He sighed. \u201cBeatrice, I know you\u2019re awake.\u201d</p><p>She bit her lip. It seemed rather silly to continue to pretend sleep, but if she acknowledged him now, it would be an admittance that she\u2019d pretended in the first place.</p><p>\u201cI know I\u2019ve disappointed you,\u201d Reynaud said quietly. \u201cI know I\u2019m probably not the type of man you would\u2019ve wanted for yourself, had you had the choice.\u201d</p><p>She curled her fingers into the coverlet but still didn\u2019t say a word.</p><p>\u201cBut I\u2019m the man you have, and that\u2019s final. You\u2019ll just have to make the best of it.\u201d He was quiet a moment. \u201cAnd if you can\u2019t be happy with me tonight, do you think you could at least come lie next to me? Dammit, I\u2019ve grown used to holding you while I sleep.\u201d</p><p>As olive branches went, it wasn\u2019t the most eloquent she\u2019d ever heard, but it tugged at her heart anyway. Besides, she\u2019d been the one to start the argument earlier. She\u2019d been the one who chose to marry a man she knew wasn\u2019t perfect. By rights, it should be her extending her hand in peace. Beatrice rolled over and came to rest against him.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s better.\u201d He yawned and wrapped his arm about her, pulling her close. \u201cYou\u2019re so soft and warm.\u201d He was silent a moment, his breathing growing deeper; then he added sleepily, \u201cAnd I like the smell of your hair.\u201d</p><p>His breathing grew sonorous, and Beatrice knew he was asleep, but she was still awake. She listened to his heartbeat, slow and strong under her ear, and the reassuring sound of his breaths. And she knew, suddenly and completely, like the last brick sliding into a wall, that she loved him, this strange angry, exotic man. Was her love enough for the both of them?</p><p>She pondered the question for what seemed a long while, but she still had no answers when at last she fell asleep.</p><p>SHE WOKE TO the slide of warm hands on her back, strong and steady, moving down, reaching her bottom under her chemise. She lay on her side in the big bed, facing away from him, cocooned in the covers and him, still mostly asleep. She could feel his humid breath against her neck. One of his arms lay beneath her; the other stroked her bottom. All along her back, he was a large, hot presence, surrounding and protecting her. She was embraced by his heat and his scent.</p><p>In the world between dreams and waking, she felt him move against her, his hard erection insistent, demanding. She sighed a little, burrowing her face into the pillow. The room was gray with dawn\u2019s advent, and she wanted him\u2014needed him\u2014even if he only desired her. The thought made her sad, and she pushed it aside, wanting to feel only him, to no longer think and worry.</p><p>He hooked his hands under her knees, curling them forward, parting her legs, and he moved into the space he\u2019d created. He was larger now, his erection pressing against her bottom, hot and insistent. He slid forward and then his penis lay against her feminine flesh. She was wet, and he seemed just right there. Perfect, as if he\u2019d always meant to be in that part of her. His cock glided through her folds, the head bumping her clitoris. She panted, suddenly overwhelmed by sensation. If only he loved her, too, this would be perfect.</p><p>But she would not think about that.</p><p>His hand caressed her hip and slid around to her front, petting her curling hair, pressing her just there. From behind, he withdrew his cock in a slow, sensuous caress and notched himself in her, intruding.</p><p>She moaned, threading her fingers with the hand that lay next to her cheek. It was suddenly too much, the sharpness of her desire mingled with the newfound knowledge of her love for him. Bittersweet tears pricked at her eyes.</p><p>He squeezed her fingers and thrust a little, his breadth shockingly large in this position. Her mouth opened in a soundless gasp, and she arched her back a little, tasting the salt of her tears on her tongue. He was slow but insistent, steadily pushing, filling her in gradual, devastating increments. She lifted her upper leg a bit, hooking it over his calf, and suddenly he was all the way in, his length stretching her. She closed her eyes, tilting her head back toward him in submission. He kissed her neck, openmouthed, still and large within her.</p><p>Then his hand moved, his fingers spreading to hold her femininity, and his middle finger pressed with exquisite accuracy on her sensitive bud.</p><p>Her hips arched into him. \u201cReynaud.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHush,\u201d he murmured against her neck.</p><p>He withdrew his cock, his flesh pulling against the walls of her core, and thrust hard. She had to push one hand against the bed to keep from sliding. He withdrew and thrust again and she moaned.</p><p>\u201cHush,\u201d he whispered, seductive and invisible behind her. She felt the rough wet slide of his tongue on her neck.</p><p>He jolted into her again. Steady, relentless. Each movement shocking in its own way. She closed her eyes, biting her lip. She wanted to push back. Wanted to jerk against him and make him go faster until she exploded. She wanted to scream aloud her love. But that knowing hand buried in the juncture of her thighs held her, imprisoned her so that he might pleasure himself and her at his leisure.</p><p>He ground into her, pushing his hips until she felt the press of his balls against her wetness, until she was stretched wide open and waiting for his next movement.</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d she whispered brokenly.</p><p>\u201cHush.\u201d He took the lobe of her ear between his teeth and bit in warning, just as he withdrew and slammed into her again.</p><p>Her breath caught, and her heart stopped\u2014perhaps it broke.</p><p>He twisted into her, large, male, demanding, and he slid his finger against her engorged clitoris, rubbing, pressing.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t stand it. She was going to explode, fly apart into a thousand small pieces that would never be put back together in this lifetime. She\u2019d never be the same again. She shook her head, sobbing into the pillow, pressing her cheek against their clenched hands.</p><p>\u201cBeatrice,\u201d he crooned, deep and seductive in her ear. \u201cBeatrice, come for me.\u201d</p><p>And she did, crying, shaking, her body hot and needing more. Needing him even if he didn\u2019t need her.</p><p>He used his cock on her like a battering ram. Thrusting, pounding hard, and sparks of pure delight went off in her body, traveling through her veins, illuminating her limbs, shining like a sun within her.</p><p>He bit her shoulder and shuddered heavily against her, and she felt his fire flood her, joining and mixing with her light, combining to become an inferno.</p><p>THE SUN SHONE through the windows when Beatrice next woke. She lay and watched as Reynaud washed his face in the basin on the dresser. He\u2019d donned smallclothes but nothing else yet, and the muscles of his back flexed as he moved, making the scars ripple.</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t told me how you managed to escape your captivity,\u201d she said quietly.</p><p>Did it matter anymore? She didn\u2019t know. Perhaps not, but she still needed to know.</p><p>He turned, unsurprised, at the sound of her voice. \u201cYou\u2019re awake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d She drew the covers up over her chin. It was warm, and the bed smelled faintly of their combined intimate scents. She rather wished she could spend all day in it and never have to get up to face her realities. Right here, right now, she could pretend she had a loving marriage.</p><p>\u201cWill you tell me?\u201d she asked softly.</p><p>He faced the dresser again and she thought he\u2019d refuse. He took up a razor and a strip of leather and began stropping it. She\u2019d noticed that although he had a very competent valet, Reynaud liked to do most of his dressing himself. Perhaps he hadn\u2019t yet gotten used to a personal servant. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMany Indian captives never go home again,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cThey die in captivity not because their masters are so strong but because the prisoners no longer try to escape.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand,\u201d Beatrice said.</p><p>He nodded. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t make much sense unless you\u2019ve experienced it firsthand. I told you before that the Indians in that part of the New World adopt their prisoners into their family to take the place of family members who have died.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you said they weren\u2019t truly regarded as family. That their role was symbolic.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMmm.\u201d He finished sharpening his razor and laid it aside. \u201cThat\u2019s more or less correct. The prisoner takes the place of a working member of the family\u2014say a hunter\u2014so those skills can be fulfilled.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut there\u2019s more?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cSometimes.\u201d He lathered his face with some soap from a dish. \u201cI suppose that it\u2019s only human nature to become fond of a person one lives with day in and day out. One hunts with members of the band or family, eats and sleeps with them. It\u2019s a very intimate living arrangement.\u201d</p><p>She was silent as she watched him pick up the razor and make the first pass through the foam on the side of his face.</p><p>\u201cSometimes,\u201d he said quietly, \u201cthe captive becomes a true member of the family. He may take a wife and even have children by her.\u201d</p> <p>Beatrice stilled. \u201cDid you take an Indian wife?\u201d</p><p>He rinsed the razor in the basin of water and looked over at her. \u201cNo. But it wasn\u2019t because I couldn\u2019t have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>He tilted his head and shaved the area next to his ear in short, careful strokes. It might\u2019ve been her imagination, but it seemed to Beatrice that he took overlong at it. \u201cAfter Gaho spared my life for the second time, she became rather fond of me\u2014whether because of myself or because of her dream, I\u2019m not sure. But, in any case, she determined that I should be content living among them, and she knew that if I had a wife and family, I would have reason not to try and escape.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe meant to tie you to herself,\u201d Beatrice said.</p><p>He nodded and tapped the razor slowly against the porcelain basin. \u201cExactly. But Gaho had a problem. Both her daughters were already married, and although sometimes men of their tribe would take a second wife, the women never take a second husband.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHow unfair,\u201d Beatrice said drily.</p><p>A smile flickered across his face and was gone. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t my idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHumph.\u201d</p><p>He turned back to the mirror over the dresser and said, \u201cI spent that next winter recovering from my illness and injuries. In the spring, Gaho took me and tattooed my face with the image of one of her gods. She pierced my ear and gave me one of her own earrings. In this way, she signified that I was a good hunter, part of her band, and that she valued me. Then she sent word to another band of Indians whom she wanted to befriend. She sought to arrange a marriage between me and the daughter of a warrior.\u201d</p><p>She saw the muscle in his jaw flex. \u201cIn this way, the two bands would make peace and become allies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas the girl pretty?\u201d Beatrice asked before she could stop herself.</p><p>\u201cPretty enough,\u201d he replied, \u201cbut she was very young, not yet sixteen, and I didn\u2019t want to marry her. I didn\u2019t want a wife and children who would bind me more firmly to Gaho and her band. I wanted to come home\u2014it was the only thing I thought of.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did you do?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI found a way to talk to the girl myself. It was forbidden in theory, but since we were supposed to be courting, the elders looked the other way. I found that the girl already had a secret beau, a slave like myself but from another tribe. After that, it was simple. I gave the other man everything of value I had, what furs and little trinkets I had saved up in two years\u2019 captivity. The next night, my prospective bride disappeared with her lover.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was kind of you,\u201d Beatrice said.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He splashed water on his face and wiped away the last of the suds. \u201cKindness had very little to do with it. I was determined to escape. Determined to come home and recover the life that should\u2019ve been mine. Had I been forced to marry that girl, it would\u2019ve been easy to relax into that life. To become a member of Gaho\u2019s family in truth. To never see England again.\u201d</p><p>He threw down the cloth he\u2019d used to dry his face and looked at her. His eyes were black and stark. \u201cIn fact, it was because of me that Gaho and her entire band were slaughtered.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Beatrice whispered.</p><p>He nodded, his mouth twisting bitterly. \u201cIt took me five years to gather enough funds so that when the opportunity presented itself, I could escape. In my sixth year, a French trader began visiting the camp, and little by little, I persuaded him to help me flee, even though it meant risking his own life. We walked for three days through the woods until we came to his camp. And there I heard that Gaho\u2019s enemies were planning to attack her band. I was half-starved and weary, but I tell you I ran back to that village. Ran back to save the woman who had saved me.\u201d</p><p>He looked down at his hands, flexing his fingers.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you find?\u201d Beatrice asked, because he had to finish this awful story.</p><p>\u201cI was too late,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cThey were all dead, young and old, the camp a smoking ruins. I looked for Gaho. I turned over the bodies, looking into each bloody face.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you find her?\u201d she whispered.</p><p>He shook his head slowly and closed his eyes as if to blot out a sight. \u201cWhen I came to Gaho, I only knew her by her dress. I turned her and her brown eyes were staring up at me through a mask of blood. They were dull and lifeless. She\u2019d been scalped.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry.\u201d</p><p>His head jerked up, his face hardening. \u201cDon\u2019t be. She was an old Indian woman. She meant nothing to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut, Reynaud\u201d\u2014Beatrice sat up\u2014\u201cyou said she saved you, treated you as a son. I know you were fond of her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t understand.\u201d He picked up his knife and stared at it a moment\u2014so long she thought he might never finish. Then he said softly, \u201cThe band that attacked Gaho and her family was the same one she\u2019d tried to make peace with five years before. The one I was to marry into.\u201d</p><p>Beatrice inhaled, not saying anything, simply watching him.</p><p>\u201cIf I was fond of her, I would\u2019ve made that marriage. I would\u2019ve ensured her village\u2019s safety. I didn\u2019t. I had only one goal the entire time I spent in her family\u2014to come home. Nothing was more important.\u201d He slid the knife into the sheath at his waist. \u201cAfter I buried Gaho, I spent months tramping through the woods, evading Indians and Frenchmen alike until I reached British territory. And every step of the way, I reminded myself that I\u2019d sacrificed Gaho and her family for this freedom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReynaud\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He looked at her sharply. \u201cYou wanted to know, so let me finish. I had very little funds and no friends. When I reached a port, I signed on as a cook on a ship to pay my passage home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were ill and feverish when you got here,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>He nodded. \u201cI lived on dried meat and berries for months in the woods. By the time I made civilization, I was mostly skin and bones, and the fare on a ship isn\u2019t particularly nourishing. I contracted some illness from the sailors and was feverish when we docked in London.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re lucky to\u2019ve survived,\u201d she said soberly.</p><p>\u201cI was driven,\u201d he said. \u201cI wasn\u2019t going to die without seeing home again. And I made a vow when I stepped foot on that ship: This was the last time I\u2019d ever serve another man. I\u2019ll never let myself be captured again, never be imprisoned to another\u2019s will. I\u2019ll die before I let it happen again. Because if I do, I\u2019ll have let her die for nothing. Do you understand?\u201d</p><p>She stared at him, standing so proud and tall. The scars of his captivity were etched upon his back, his years of imprisonment illustrated by the tattoos on his face. He\u2019d always have them with him, no matter where he went, no matter what he did. There was no way he could ever forget his captivity or his vow to never submit to another\u2019s will. He was a hard man, and his will was iron.</p><p>He nodded. \u201cNow you know.\u201d</p><p>She swallowed, feeling a little sick but not wanting to appear weak before him. \u201cYes, now I know.\u201d</p><p>He turned his back on her and left the room.</p><p>Beatrice looked about the room, dazed. His story had been worse even than she\u2019d expected, because now she did know: Reynaud would never let himself love her.</p><p>WHAT HAD POSSESSED Beatrice to make him tell that story? Reynaud ran down the stairs to the front hall. What did she want of him? Had he not been an attentive husband and a sensitive lover? What more did she need?</p><p>And why bring all this up today? His belly felt twisted in knots, and he absently rubbed it as he strode through the front hall. He needed his mind sharp and clear, uncluttered by emotional upheaval. Tonight he\u2019d make amends for his abrupt exit\u2014bring her those flowers that Jeremy had said she\u2019d like. But right now he had an appointment with his solicitors to go over his petition to the special committee, and that he couldn\u2019t miss.</p><p>Reynaud was descending the front steps of his town house, his mind still occupied with thoughts of Beatrice, when he heard his name called. He turned and saw a vision from his past.</p><p>Alistair Munroe walked toward him, bearing the scars of ritual Indian torture on his face.</p><p>Reynaud flinched.</p><p>\u201cHorrible, aren\u2019t they?\u201d Munroe rasped in a raw voice.</p><p>Reynaud studied him. Munroe\u2019s right cheek was marred by the scars of knife wounds and burning sticks. A black eye patch covered the socket of one eye. Reynaud had seen the captured killed by Indians twice\u2014one right after Spinner\u2019s Falls and again in his fourth year with Gaho\u2019s band. Her husband had disappeared for a month one summer and then returned with an enemy warrior he\u2019d captured on a raid. The man had taken two days to die.</p><p>\u201cDid you scream?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Munroe shook his head. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you were a worthy captive,\u201d Reynaud said. \u201cHad you not been rescued, you would\u2019ve been tortured to death eventually. Then the men of the tribe would have cut your heart from your body, and all would have eaten a small piece of it so that they might take your courage into their own bodies and use it when next they fought.\u201d</p><p>Munroe threw back his head and laughed, the sound harsh and rusty. \u201cNo one has ever talked about my scars so frankly to my face.\u201d</p><p>Reynaud gestured, unsmiling. \u201cThey\u2019re badges of honor. I have the same on my back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you now?\u201d Munroe looked at him thoughtfully. \u201cYou must\u2019ve been a stubborn bastard to survive seven years a captive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou might say that.\u201d Reynaud cocked his head. \u201cHave you been to see Vale yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIndeed I have, and he says you might have a small chore for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood man.\u201d Reynaud grinned. \u201cActually, I have two favors to ask of you. Let me tell you what I need done. . . .\u201d</p><p>LORD HASSELTHORPE CLIMBED into his carriage and pounded his stick against the roof to alert the driver. Then he sat back and withdrew a memorandum book from his greatcoat pocket. His majority was thin, but he had no doubt they would easily vote down Wheaton\u2019s ridiculous veteran\u2019s pension bill. The government could ill afford to pay drunks and riffraff to lie about all day just because they once took the king\u2019s shilling. Still, it never hurt to be careful. He licked his thumb and turned to the first page in the little book and began to study his speech against the bill.</p><p>So intent was he on the points he meant to argue, in fact, that it was some time before he noticed that the carriage was driving by Hyde Park. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Lord Hasselthorpe scowled and leaped to his feet, knocking against the carriage roof. \u201cStop the carriage! Stop the carriage, I say! You\u2019re going in the wrong damned direction.\u201d</p><p>The carriage pulled to the side of the road and halted. Hasselthorpe prepared to give the idiot coachman a tongue-lashing. But before he could reach the carriage door, it was jerked open and a familiar face filled the doorway.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell are you doing?\u201d Hasselthorpe roared.</p><p>Chapter Sixteen</p> <p>So Longsword lived with the princess and her father in the royal castle, and his days were filled with ease and joy. The food was rich and abundant, his clothing warm and soft; he didn\u2019t have to battle any imps or demons, and the princess was delightful company. In fact, the more time Longsword spent riding with the princess, dining with her, and strolling the castle gardens, the sweeter his pleasure became, until he longed to spend all his days and nights with her forever.</p><p>But he knew he could not. His year on earth was growing to a close, and the Goblin King would soon demand his return....</p><p>\u2014from Longsword</p><p>Westminster Hall\u2019s stern Gothic architecture gave it a conservative air much admired by the majority of the older members of parliament. A corner of Reynaud\u2019s mouth curled up as he neared the imposing doors. He\u2019d come here often as a young man, accompanying his father when he sat in the House of Lords. It was strange to enter now, knowing that he came to defend a title held by his father\u2014a title that should\u2019ve passed to him without any dispute at all. He squared his shoulders and thrust his chin out as he entered the facade. It occurred to him they were the same movements he used to make right before battle.</p><p>This, too, was a battle, but one he must fight with his wits.</p> <p>Reynaud strode through the great vaulted hall, passing under the watchful eyes of the angels that lined the eaves, and proceeded to a dark back passage. This led down a short flight of stairs and to a series of dark-paneled doors. Outside one was a somberly dressed servant.</p><p>The servant bowed to Reynaud. \u201cThey\u2019re waiting within, my lord.\u201d</p><p>Reynaud nodded. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>The dark little room he entered was sparsely furnished. Four rows of wooden benches sat facing a large wood table. Beside the table was a single tall chair. The room was loud with the voices of men, for the benches were nearly full. There were twenty members of this Select Committee for Privileges, appointed from the House of Lords to decide the matter of his title. As Reynaud found a seat, the chairman of the committee, Lord Travers, got up from where he\u2019d been sitting with Beatrice\u2019s uncle on the front bench. He saw Reynaud, nodded, and went to stand before the tall chair.</p><p>\u201cMy lords, shall we begin?\u201d</p><p>The room gradually quieted, although total silence was not achieved, because several members continued to murmur, and one elderly lord was cracking walnuts in the corner, apparently oblivious to the proceedings around him.</p> <p>Lord Travers nodded, gave a brief, dry outline of the case before the committee, and then called on Reynaud.</p><p>Reynaud took a deep breath, his fingers moving to touch where his knife usually hung by his side before he remembered he\u2019d left it at home. He stood and strode to the front of the room and faced his peers. The faces that looked back at him were mostly old. Would they understand? Did they still have pity?</p><p>He took a breath. \u201cMy lords, I stand before you and plead for the title my father, my grandfather, my great-grandfather, and his father before him held. I ask you for what is only mine by birth. You have papers attesting to my identity. That, I think, is not at issue.\u201d He paused and looked at the men sitting in judgment of him. Not a one looked particularly sympathetic. \u201cWhat is at issue is what my opponent intends to claim: that I am mad.\u201d</p><p>That caused several lords to frown and put their heads together. Reynaud felt his shoulder blades twitch. The tack he was taking was a risk, but a calculated one.</p><p>He let the murmurs die and then lifted his chin. \u201cI am not mad. What I am is an officer of His Majesty\u2019s army, one who has seen perhaps more than his fair share of combat and hardship. If I am mad, then every officer who ever saw battle, who ever came home missing limb or eye, who ever dreamed in the night of blood and war cries, is mad as well. Shame me and you shame every brave man who has fought for this country.\u201d</p><p>The voices had grown louder at his assertion, but Reynaud raised his voice to be heard over the murmuring. \u201cGrant me, then, my lords, what is mine and mine alone. The title that belonged to my father. The title that in time will descend to my son. The earldom of Blanchard. My earldom.\u201d</p><p>There were frowns and voices raised in argument as he made his way back to his seat. As Reynaud sat down he wondered if he\u2019d just won back his title\u2014or lost it forever.</p><p>ALGERNON DOWNEY, THE Duke of Lister, was on the way to the House of Lords, but he paused on the front steps of his town house to give his secretary some additional instructions. \u201cI\u2019ve run out of patience. Tell my aunt that if she cannot keep figures, then she should hire someone literate to do it for her. Until then, I do not intend to give her any further monies this quarter. A few refusals of service from tradesmen may help her to be more frugal with her allowance.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, Your Grace.\u201d The secretary made a low bow.</p><p>Lister turned to descend his steps to the waiting carriage.</p><p>Or at least that was what he intended. Instead he stopped so suddenly that he nearly lost his footing. Waiting for him at the bottom was a tiny, beautiful woman in a bright green frock.</p><p>Lister frowned. \u201cMadeleine, what are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>The woman thrust out her chest, imperiling the fine silk of her bodice. \u201cWhat am I doing here?\u201d</p><p>Behind him, Lister heard a dry cough. He turned to see his secretary goggling at his mistress.</p><p>\u201cGo inside and make sure Her Grace doesn\u2019t take a notion to come out the front door,\u201d Lister ordered.</p><p>The secretary looked a bit disappointed, but he bowed and went inside.</p><p>Lister started down the steps. \u201cYou know better than to visit my family residence, Madeleine. If this is some attempt at blackmail\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBlackmail! Oh, I like that! I like that indeed,\u201d Madeleine replied somewhat obscurely. \u201cAnd what about her?\u201d</p><p>Lister followed her pointing finger to find... \u201cDemeter? I don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><p>The blond lady thus addressed cocked a magnificent hip and folded her arms across her ample bosom. \u201cAnd you think I do? I received this letter\u201d\u2014she waved an elegant-looking missive\u2014\u201csaying you need me at once and please come here, of all places, if I had any affection for you at all.\u201d</p><p>Lister drew himself up. His ancestors had fought at the Battle of Hastings, he was the fifth-richest man in England, and he was known for his ill temper. Two of his mistresses appearing at one time on his very doorstep was, of course, disconcerting, but a man of his experience, stature, and\u2014</p><p>\u201cAnd what the blazes is this?\u201d Evelyn, the most strident of his mistresses, exclaimed as she came around the corner. Tall, black-haired, and imposing, she looked at him with the same wild passion that usually turned his loins to iron. \u201cIf this is your way of giving me my cong\u00e9, Algernon, you will regret it, mark my words.\u201d</p><p>Lister winced. He hated it when Evelyn called him by his Christian name. He opened his mouth and then wasn\u2019t entirely sure what to say, a thing that had never before happened to him in his life. This experience was ominously close to one of those awful dreams even a man of his stature had once in a while. The nightmares in which one stood up to address the House of Lords and looked down to see that one was wearing only one\u2019s smallclothes. Or the nightmare in which all of one\u2019s mistresses somehow managed to be in the same place at the same time\u2014and at his house, no less.</p><p>Lister felt sweat slide greasily down his back.</p><p>Of course, this wasn\u2019t quite all of his mistresses. If it were, his newest light o\u2019 love would have been here, and she\u2014</p><p>A dangerously high phaeton rounded the corner, scandalously driven by a sophisticated woman, a little boy in flamboyant purple and gold livery behind her. Everyone turned to look.</p><p>Lister watched the vision approach with the fatality of a man who stands before a firing squad. Francesca drew the horses to a halt with a flourish. Her pretty little rosebud mouth fell open.</p><p>\u201cWhat eez theez?\u201d she cried in an excruciating French accent. \u201cYour Grace, \u2019r you having zee joke wit\u2019 your poor petite Francesca?\u201d</p><p>There was a long and awful pause.</p><p>And then Evelyn pivoted and stared dangerously at him. \u201cWhy does she have a new phaeton?\u201d</p><p>It was at this moment, as the shrill voices of four slighted women rose about him, that the Duke of Lister saw a man across the street tip his hat. The man wore an eye patch.</p><p>Lister blinked. Surely it couldn\u2019t be...</p><p>But that thought was driven from his mind as the women converged on him. The House of Lords would have to wait.</p><p>REYNAUD GLANCED ABOUT the room, trying to judge his standing, but it was near impossible. The lords still talked avidly among themselves, with one or two throwing him curious glances. No one smiled at him.</p><p>Reynaud balled his fists on his knees.</p><p>The usurper took his spot before the table and cleared his throat. He began speaking, but his voice was so low that several lords shouted for him to speak up. Reginald paused, visibly gulping, and began again in a louder but slightly unsteady voice.</p><p>And suddenly Reynaud felt sorry for the man. Reginald was in his sixth decade, a short, stout, red-faced man who wasn\u2019t a good speaker. Reynaud remembered very little of the man. Had he come to Christmas dinner with his wife once when Reynaud was down from Cambridge? He couldn\u2019t remember.</p><p>The fact was that Reginald simply hadn\u2019t been important. He\u2019d been a distant relation unlikely to inherit the title, since Reynaud was young and healthy. What a surprise it must\u2019ve been when he received news that he\u2019d become the Earl of Blanchard. Had he celebrated Reynaud\u2019s supposed death? Reynaud wasn\u2019t even sure he could hold that against the man. Becoming the Earl of Blanchard had probably been the high point in his life.</p><p>Reginald had stuttered to a halt. He\u2019d really not had that much to say to begin with, his basic plea being that he held the title and was therefore the earl. The chairman nodded, and Beatrice\u2019s uncle resumed his seat with evident relief.</p><p>Lord Travers stood and called for a vote.</p><p>Reynaud felt the blood rush in his ears, so loud that at first he didn\u2019t hear the verdict. Then he did and a wide grin split his face.</p><p>\u201c. . . this committee therefore will recommend to Our Sovereign King, His Majesty George the Third, that Reynaud Michael Paul St. Aubyn be given his rightful title as the Earl of Blanchard.\u201d</p><p>The chairman continued with the litany of Reynaud\u2019s other titles, but he no longer listened. Triumph was flooding his chest. The lord sitting beside him clapped him on the back, and the man behind him leaned over the bench saying, \u201cWell done, Blanchard.\u201d</p><p>Dear God, it felt good to be addressed by his title finally. The chairman wound down and Reynaud stood. The men about him crowded close, offering congratulations, and Reynaud couldn\u2019t help but feel a bit of cynicism at his sudden popularity. He\u2019d gone from being a madman to one of the most influential men in the kingdom. Beatrice had been right. He had great power now\u2014power he could use to effect good if he wished.</p><p>Over the heads of the crowd, he saw Reginald standing by the door. He was alone now, his power gone. Reginald caught his eye and nodded. It was a graceful gesture, an acknowledgment of defeat, and Reynaud wanted to go to him, but he was prevented by the press of bodies. In another moment, Reginald had left the room.</p><p>The committee began filing out, and Lord Travers came to offer Reynaud his congratulations. \u201cThat\u2019s done, then, what? I\u2019ll have the secretary draw up the official committee recommendation to be sent to His Majesty.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAh. As to that,\u201d Reynaud began, but there was a commotion in the doorway. A tall, ruddy-faced young man with strikingly prominent blue eyes came into the room.</p><p>\u201cYour Majesty!\u201d Lord Travers exclaimed. \u201cTo what do we owe the honor of your visit?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome to sign a paper, what?\u201d King George replied. \u201cWhat a dingy little room this is.\u201d He turned and examined Reynaud. \u201cYou\u2019re Blanchard?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am.\u201d Reynaud bowed low. \u201cIt\u2019s an honor to meet you, Your Majesty.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCaptured by savages, or so we\u2019re told by Sir Alistair Munroe,\u201d the king said. \u201cBound to be a good tale in that, what? We would be most pleased if you\u2019d come to tea and tell us the story. Bring your lady wife as well.\u201d</p><p>Reynaud fought back a grin and bowed again. \u201cThank you, Your Majesty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow, where\u2019s that recommendation?\u201d the king asked, looking around as if it might appear out of thin air.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve come to sign the recommendation?\u201d Lord Travers asked in mild astonishment. He snapped his fingers urgently at the servant by the door. \u201cWalters, fetch a pen and paper, if you will. We must prepare the committee\u2019s recommendation for His Majesty\u2019s signature.\u201d</p><p>The servant left the room at a dead run.</p> <p>\u201cAnd then there\u2019s the writ so you can sit in the House of Lords,\u201d the king said cheerfully. He motioned to an attendant. \u201cWe\u2019ve had it already drawn up, just in case.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour Majesty is quite prepared, I see,\u201d Lord Travers said somewhat drily. \u201cHad I known Your Majesty\u2019s plans, I would\u2019ve had some papers already prepared. As it is, we\u2019ll have to work fast, I\u2019m afraid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes?\u201d The king raised his eyebrows.</p><p>\u201cIndeed, sire,\u201d Lord Travers said somberly. \u201cThe House of Lords is convening at this moment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWHAT THE HELL\u2019RE you doing?\u201d Lord Hasselthorpe roared. It was the Colonial, Samuel Hartley, climbing into his carriage as if he had every right.</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d the other man said. \u201cI thought you\u2019d stop to give me a ride.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Hasselthorpe glanced out the window. They were almost on the outskirts of London. \u201cIs this robbery? Have you commandeered my carriage?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing of the sort.\u201d Hartley shrugged and crossed his arms over his chest, slumping a bit in the seat, his legs taking up too damned much of the room. \u201cI merely saw your carriage stopped and thought I\u2019d ask for a ride. You don\u2019t mind, do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have a session of the House of Lords to attend at Westminster Palace. Of course I mind!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you\u2019d better tell your coachman,\u201d Hartley said maddeningly. \u201cWe\u2019re driving in the opposite direction.\u201d</p><p>Once again, Hasselthorpe rose and pounded on the roof of the carriage.</p><p>Ten minutes later, after a ridiculous argument with his coachman, who seemed to\u2019ve entirely lost his sense of direction, Hasselthorpe once again took his seat.</p><p>Hartley shook his head sadly. \u201cGood help is hard to find. Do you think your driver\u2019s drunk?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat or mad,\u201d Hasselthorpe grumbled. At the rate they were going, the session might very well be over by the time they got to Westminster Palace. He clutched his memorandum book in sweaty hands. This vote was an important one\u2014it would demonstrate his ability to lead and direct the party.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve been meaning to ask you,\u201d Hartley drawled, interrupting his thoughts. \u201cWho were you referring to when you told Sir Alistair Munroe that the Spinner\u2019s Falls traitor had a French mother?\u201d</p><p>Hasselthorpe\u2019s mind went entirely blank. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I\u2019ve been racking my brain, and the only veteran of Spinner\u2019s Falls who had a French mother that I remember is Reynaud St. Aubyn,\u201d Hartley said. \u201cOf course, your brother was there as well, wasn\u2019t he? Lieutenant Thomas Maddock. A brave soldier as I remember. Perhaps he wrote you about another soldier who had a French mother?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about,\u201d Hasselthorpe said. \u201cI never told Munroe anything about soldiers with French mothers.\u201d</p><p>Hartley was silent a moment, staring at him.</p><p>Hasselthorpe felt sweat dampen his armpits.</p><p>Then Hartley said softly, \u201cNo? How strange. Munroe remembers the conversation vividly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps he\u2019d been drinking,\u201d Hasselthorpe snapped.</p><p>The Colonial smiled as if he\u2019d revealed something damning and said lightly, \u201cPerhaps. You know, I hadn\u2019t thought about your brother Thomas for a very long while.\u201d</p><p>Hasselthorpe licked his lips. He was too hot. The carriage felt like a trap.</p><p>\u201cHe was your older brother, wasn\u2019t he?\u201d Hartley asked softly.</p><p>Chapter Seventeen</p><p>As the end of his year on earth drew nearer, Longsword grew more and more despondent until Princess Serenity feared for his very life. Yet although he was distracted and moody, in his body he remained healthy and strong. She decided then that the problem must lie with his mind, and to find out the matter, she questioned him closely, both day and night. So vexed was her husband that in the end he could do naught but confess his story. How he had made a very bad bargain with the Goblin King. How he could remain on the earth for only one year unless he could find someone to take his place in the kingdom of the goblins of their own volition.</p><p>And how if Longsword failed to find his replacement, he would be damned to labor for the Goblin King for all eternity....</p><p>\u2014from Longsword</p><p>\u201cWestminster is so very masculine, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Lottie mused as they stopped and glanced about the great hall.</p><p>\u201cMasculine?\u201d Beatrice stared at the high vaulted ceiling, nearly black with age. \u201cI don\u2019t know what you mean by masculine, but I do think it could do with a good cleaning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat I mean by masculine,\u201d Lottie said, linking her arm with Beatrice\u2019s, \u201cis stodgy and self-important and much too serious to notice mere womenfolk.\u201d</p><p>Beatrice eyed her friend, who was looking elegant as usual in a deep purple and brown striped gown. She\u2019d just taken off her fur hood, but her cheeks were rosy from the cold outside, and her eyes snapped with an aggression that Beatrice wasn\u2019t sure had anything to do with Westminster Palace\u2019s architecture.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a building, Lottie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly,\u201d Lottie said. \u201cAnd all buildings\u2014at least the great ones\u2014have a sort of spiritual sense about them. Did I ever tell you about the chill I felt in St. Paul\u2019s last spring? Quite mysterious. It sent a shiver down my spine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps you were standing in a draft,\u201d Beatrice said practically. They\u2019d reached the end of the hall and had come to a passage. \u201cWhich way now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo the right,\u201d Lottie said decisively. \u201cThe left leads to the Commons\u2019 Strangers Gallery, so the right must be the way to the gallery for the lords.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm.\u201d This seemed rather haphazard, but as Beatrice had never visited parliament before and Lottie had, she followed her.</p><p>And as it turned out, whether by luck or accident, Lottie was exactly right. They turned right down a narrow passage that led to a set of double doors. To the side was a staircase that led upward. Once at the top, they each gave the waiting servant two shillings and were admitted to the ladies\u2019 side of the visitor gallery.</p><p>Below them was a hall with tiered benches arranged on either side rather like the choir in a cathedral. The benches were covered in red cushions. Between the rows of benches was a long wooden table, and at the end of the hall stood several single chairs. The gallery overhung the hall and ran around three sides.</p><p>\u201cI thought they were in session,\u201d Beatrice whispered.</p><p>\u201cThey are,\u201d Lottie replied.</p><p>Beatrice examined the noble members of the House of Lords. \u201cThey don\u2019t look like they\u2019re doing very much.\u201d</p><p>And they didn\u2019t. Some men wandered the chamber or chatted together in small groups. Others lounged on the cushions, more than one dozing. A gentleman stood at the end and appeared to be talking, but the noise in the hall was so loud that Beatrice couldn\u2019t hear him. Some of the lords appeared to be heckling the poor man.</p><p>\u201cThe governing process can be obscure to the untrained eye,\u201d Lottie said loftily.</p><p>\u201cWhy, that\u2019s Lord Phipps,\u201d Beatrice exclaimed in dismay, having finally identified the speaker. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t look very good for Mr. Wheaton\u2019s bill.\u201d</p><p>For Lord Phipps was the champion of the veteran\u2019s bill in the House of Lords. He was a kindly man but was a bit dry and nondescript and, as it was obvious now, not a particularly good speaker.</p><p>\u201cNo, it doesn\u2019t,\u201d Lottie said, subdued. \u201cHe is so sweet when he comes to the meetings. He sat and told me all about his ginger cat once.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe got tears in his eyes when he talked about his late wife,\u201d Beatrice said.</p><p>\u201cSuch a nice man.\u201d</p><p>They both watched as a lord in a full-bottomed wig and black and gold robes at the end of the room vainly shouted for order. Someone threw an orange peel.</p><p>\u201cOh, dear,\u201d Lottie sighed.</p><p>There was a commotion by the doors, but since the gallery overhung the room, Beatrice couldn\u2019t at first see who had entered below them. Then Reynaud strode into the room, and her heart gave a sort of painful leap. He was so handsome, so commanding, and he seemed farther away from her than ever. Reynaud headed straight to the man in the chair as heads turned to follow his progress.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s he doing?\u201d Lottie asked. \u201cA peer has to have a writ of summons from the king to join parliament.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe must\u2019ve won the title back,\u201d Beatrice said softly. She rejoiced for Reynaud, but she worried about Uncle Reggie. He must be crushed. \u201cPerhaps he got a special dispensation?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrom the king himself,\u201d a male voice said from the aisle separating the ladies\u2019 section from the rest of the gallery.</p><p>\u201cNate!\u201d Lottie cried.</p><p>Mr. Graham nodded at his wife. \u201cLottie.\u201d He came to stand by the rail near them. \u201cIt\u2019s all over Westminster. Reynaud has been given the title and the earldom by King George\u2014he actually came to Westminster to do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut how could he sit in the House of Lords today?\u201d Lottie asked.</p><p>Mr. Graham shrugged. \u201cThe king issued his writ of summons at the same time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGoodness,\u201d Beatrice said. \u201cThen he\u2019ll be able to vote on Mr. Wheaton\u2019s bill.\u201d Would his vote be for or against the bill?</p><p>The peer in the black and gold robes was calling for order. \u201cThe noble Earl of Blanchard will now speak on this matter.\u201d</p><p>Beatrice gasped and leaned forward.</p><p>Reynaud stood and placed one hand on the table in the middle of the room. He paused a moment as the House quieted and then said, \u201cMy lords, this bill has been explained to you at length by the noble Lord Phipps. It is to provide for the well-being of the gallant men who serve this country and His Majesty, King George, with their bravery, their labor, and sometimes their very lives. There are those who value this service lightly, who consider the soldiers of this green and glorious isle to be less than deserving of a decent pension in their old age.\u201d</p><p>A lord cried, \u201cHear him!\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps these persons find mealy peasemeal and gruel a banquet. Perhaps these persons think marching for twenty miles through mud in pouring rain a stroll through a pleasure garden.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHear him! Hear him!\u201d The calls were growing more frequent.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps these persons find facing cannon fire relaxing. Enjoy meeting the charge of galloping cavalry. Find the screams of dying men music to their ears.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHear him! Hear him!\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps,\u201d Reynaud shouted above the chant, \u201cthese persons love the agony of a severed limb, the loss of an eye, or the infliction of torture such as this.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>And Beatrice covered her mouth in mingled horror and pride. For on his last word, Reynaud flung from his body his coat and waistcoat and pulled his shirt half down his arms, revealing his upper back. Sudden silence descended on the hall as Reynaud pivoted in place, the light reflecting off the ugly scars snaking through his tanned skin. In the quiet, the sound of linen ripping was loud as Reynaud tore off the remainder of the shirt and threw it to the floor.</p><p>He raised one hand, outstretched, commanding. \u201cIf such a person is in this room, let him vote against this bill.\u201d</p><p>The room erupted into cheers. Every peer was on his feet, many were still shouting, \u201cHear him! Hear him!\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo order! To order!\u201d the peer in the gold and black robes called to no avail.</p> <p>Reynaud still stood, his chest bare, his back straight in the middle of the hall, proudly displaying the scars she knew had shamed him. He glanced up and caught her eye. Beatrice stood up, clapping, the tears standing in her eyes. He nodded imperceptibly and then was distracted by another peer.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s won it,\u201d Mr. Graham shouted. \u201cThey\u2019ll vote, but I think it a mere formality. Your uncle can no longer vote on the Lords, and Hasselthorpe and Lister haven\u2019t shown.\u201d</p><p>Lottie leaned toward him. \u201cYou must be disappointed.\u201d</p><p>Mr. Graham shook his head. \u201cI\u2019ve decided Hasselthorpe isn\u2019t a leader I want to be following.\u201d He looked sheepishly at Beatrice. \u201cI\u2019m almost certain he was behind that scene at Miss Molyneux\u2019s ball. In any event, I intend to vote for Mr. Wheaton\u2019s bill.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Nate!\u201d Lottie cried, and threw her arms most improperly about his neck.</p> <p>Beatrice looked down, smiling as Lottie and Mr. Graham embraced.</p><p>\u201cSir! Sir!\u201d a servant called. \u201cGentlemen are not allowed in the ladies\u2019 side of the gallery!\u201d</p><p>Mr. Graham raised his head only fractionally. \u201cShe\u2019s my wife, dammit.\u201d And while gazing in a most romantic manner into Lottie\u2019s eyes, he added, \u201cAnd my love.\u201d</p><p>And he kissed her again.</p><p>This was too much for Beatrice\u2019s already overwrought emotions. She found herself wiping tears from her cheeks. In order to give her friends more privacy and to compose herself, she slipped from the gallery, quietly descending the back stairs. In the dark passageway below, she stood by herself, leaning a little against the wall.</p><p>Why had he done it? Just last night he said he never wanted to talk of his scars again. Then why reveal them to a roomful of strangers? Did the bill mean so much to him\u2014or, wonderful thought, had he done it for her after all? Beatrice felt selfish, wanting his reason to endorse the bill to be her. The lives of so many soldiers were at stake. Perhaps he\u2019d done it simply of noble consideration for the veterans. But then there\u2019d been that glance he\u2019d given her... Oh, she must not read too much into a mere glance!</p> <p>While she\u2019d been silently contemplating all this, the lords had quieted, but now they roared again, and she could tell by the shouts of \u201cBlanchard! Blanchard!\u201d that Reynaud had carried the day for Mr. Wheaton\u2019s bill. Her heart was nearly overflowing. She turned blindly to return to the gallery, but in doing so bumped into a large male form.</p><p>Beatrice looked up with an apologetic smile on her face, but it died when she saw the man she\u2019d run into. \u201cLord Hasselthorpe!\u201d</p><p>The peer looked ghastly. His face was blanched a greenish white, and it shone with sweat. He\u2019d been staring at the closed doors to the Lords, but at her voice, he turned to her and his eyes seemed to focus and then grow cold.</p><p>\u201cLady Blanchard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTO THE TRUE Earl of Blanchard!\u201d Vale cried, not a little inebriated, as he held up a foaming tankard of ale.</p><p>\u201cBlanchard! Blanchard!\u201d Munroe, Hartley, and most of the rest of the rather seedy tavern they sat in cheered. Vale had stood the entire small, smoky room drinks twice already.</p><p>They were at a booth in the corner, the table scarred and pitted from numerous previous patrons. The barmaid was buxom and pretty and had at first obviously held high hopes for them. Now, however, after a half hour of concentrated effort, she\u2019d turned her ample charms on a table of sailors sitting nearby. Reynaud couldn\u2019t help but think how different her seduction of Vale would\u2019ve ended seven years ago.</p><p>\u201cI thank you. I thank you all.\u201d Reynaud was on only his second pint despite Vale\u2019s urging to drink more. He still had a niggling fear of not being completely alert\u2014perhaps a leftover from his years of captivity. \u201cWithout your help today, gentlemen, this would\u2019ve been a far more difficult endeavor. Therefore, to Munroe, who so ably diverted a certain duke and requested the presence of another gentleman of importance at Westminster.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHuzzah!\u201d shouted the tavern customers, most of whom had no idea what was being said. Even the barmaid waved her cloth.</p><p>Munroe merely smiled and inclined his head.</p><p>Reynaud turned to Vale. \u201cTo Jasper, who gave the deciding vote to pass Mr. Wheaton\u2019s veteran\u2019s bill!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuzzah!\u201d</p><p>Vale actually blushed, the color running high over his hangdog face. Of course, that might\u2019ve been the ale as well.</p><p>\u201cAnd to Hartley, who delayed the main opposition to the bill!\u201d</p><p>Hartley also inclined his head to the cheers of the crowd, though his eyes were still grave. He waited until the surrounding tavern regulars had quieted and turned back to their own affairs and then said, \u201cThere\u2019s something you all ought to know about Hasselthorpe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d Suddenly Vale didn\u2019t look drunk at all.</p><p>\u201cHe denies telling Munroe that the traitor\u2019s mother was French.\u201d</p><p>Where another man might sputter into protestations, Munroe merely raised his eyebrows. \u201cIndeed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would he lie about such a thing?\u201d Reynaud set down his tankard of ale, wishing he\u2019d not drunk even that. They were close to something here; he could feel it.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps it was his first statement that was the lie,\u201d Hartley said softly.</p><p>\u201cWhat d\u2019you mean?\u201d Vale asked.</p><p>\u201cWhen he told Munroe that the traitor\u2019s mother was French, Reynaud was still thought dead. Hasselthorpe risked nothing by throwing suspicion on him. Further, he knew that there was a good chance that Munroe would never reveal his information\u2014the news would be too harrowing for Vale to take. Why stir up trouble when the man who might be the traitor is dead?\u201d</p><p>Munroe nodded. \u201cThat\u2019s true. I nearly never told Vale. But I began to think that the truth, even if bitter, was better than lies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd a good thing you did, too,\u201d Hartley said. \u201cBecause when Reynaud returned, Hasselthorpe was then backed into a corner. Should he continue his lie and implicate a now-live man? Or should he call Munroe the liar? Either way, he needed to draw suspicion away from himself fast.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you think Hasselthorpe is the true traitor,\u201d Reynaud said quietly. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThink of it.\u201d Hartley leaned forward. \u201cWhen Vale went to question Hasselthorpe, the man was shot\u2014but not fatally. A glancing wound, as I understand it. He then left London altogether and sequestered himself at his estate near Portsmouth. When Munroe questioned him, he told a lie that prevented further interrogation. And remember this: Hasselthorpe\u2019s older brother was Thomas Maddock\u2014Lieutenant Maddock of the Twenty-eighth of Foot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think he killed so many to get the title?\u201d Vale frowned.</p><p>Hartley shrugged. \u201cIt\u2019s certainly a reason to betray the regiment. Isn\u2019t that something we\u2019ve been searching for all along\u2014a motive to betray the Twenty-eighth? I asked around\u2014Hasselthorpe was the younger brother. He came into the title shortly after Maddock\u2019s death. In fact, Maddock died after their father had passed away, but he seemed to\u2019ve never heard the news that his father was dead. He was killed at Spinner\u2019s Falls before it could reach him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is all well and good,\u201d Munroe cut in, his broken voice grating. \u201cWe\u2019ve established why Hasselthorpe might\u2019ve betrayed the regiment, but I still don\u2019t see how he could\u2019ve done the deed. Only the officers who marched with the Twenty-eighth knew our destination. It was kept secret precisely so we wouldn\u2019t be ambushed.\u201d</p><p>Reynaud stirred. \u201cOnly the officers of the Twenty-eighth\u2014and the superiors who ordered them on their route.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you thinking?\u201d Vale turned to him eagerly.</p><p>\u201cHasselthorpe was an aide-de-camp to General Elmsworth at Quebec,\u201d Reynaud said. \u201cIf Maddock didn\u2019t tell him the route\u2014they were brothers, after all\u2014then it wouldn\u2019t have been very hard to discover it. Elmsworth may\u2019ve made him privy to it himself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe would\u2019ve had to get the information to the French,\u201d Munroe pointed out.</p><p>Reynaud shrugged, pushing away his tankard of ale altogether. \u201cHe was in Quebec. Do you remember? It was swarming with the French troops we\u2019d captured, French citizens, and Indians who\u2019d supported both sides. It was chaos.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe could\u2019ve done it easily,\u201d Hartley said. \u201cThe question now is did he indeed do it? We have supposition and conjecture but no real facts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen we\u2019ll have to find the facts,\u201d Reynaud said grimly. \u201cAgreed?\u201d</p><p>The other men nodded. \u201cAgreed,\u201d they said in unison.</p><p>\u201cTo discovering the truth,\u201d Vale said, and raised his tankard.</p><p>They all raised their tankards and knocked them together, solemnizing the toast.</p><p>Reynaud toasted the sentiment with the rest. He drained his tankard and slammed it down on the table. \u201cAnd to seeing the traitor swing, goddamn his eyes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHear, hear!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnother round on me,\u201d Reynaud called.</p><p>Vale leaned close, blasting Reynaud with the ale on his breath. \u201cShouldn\u2019t a newly wedded man such as yourself go home?\u201d</p><p>Reynaud scowled. \u201cI\u2019ll go home soon.\u201d</p><p>Vale wagged his shaggy eyebrows. \u201cHad a falling-out with the missus?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone of your goddamned business!\u201d Reynaud hid his face in his tankard of ale, but when he lowered it, Vale was still staring at him rather blearily. And had it not been for the ale, Reynaud probably wouldn\u2019t have said, \u201cShe thinks I don\u2019t know how to care, if you must know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t she know you care for her?\u201d Hartley asked from across the table.</p><p>Wonderful. Both he and Munroe had been listening in like a pair of gossiping biddies.</p><p>Munroe stirred. \u201cShe needs to know, man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo home,\u201d Vale said solemnly. \u201cGo home and tell her you love her.\u201d</p><p>And for the very first time Reynaud began to think that Vale\u2019s romantic advice might\u2014just might\u2014be correct.</p><p>Chapter Eighteen</p><p>Now, although Princess Serenity had married Longsword as a reward for saving her father, she had, in the many months she had lived with him, come to love her husband deeply. Hearing his terrible fate, she became quiet and withdrawn, contemplating silently what this news meant to her. And, after many long walks in the castle garden, she came to a decision: she would offer herself to the Goblin King in Longsword\u2019s stead.</p><p>And so, on the night before Longsword was to return to the kingdom of the goblins, Princess Serenity drugged Longsword\u2019s wine. As her husband slept, she kissed him tenderly and then set out to meet the Goblin King....</p><p>\u2014from Longsword</p><p>Seven years of planning. Seven years of careful moves on a giant chessboard. Some of them so infinitesimally small that even his most intelligent enemies had been blind to their true meaning. Seven years that should have culminated in his becoming prime minister and the de facto leader of the most powerful country on earth. Seven years of patient waiting and secret lusting.</p><p>Seven years destroyed in one afternoon by one man\u2014Reynaud St. Aubyn. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He\u2019d seen the knowledge in Hartley\u2019s eyes when he\u2019d mentioned Thomas. Poor, poor Thomas. His brother had never been cut out for greatness. Why should Thomas have the title when it would serve him so much better? But now that old decision had come back to haunt him. Vale, Blanchard, Hartley, and Munroe. All in London at once, all putting their heads together. Hasselthorpe could read the writing on the wall. It was only a matter of time before they had him arrested.</p><p>All because St. Aubyn had returned home. He glared across the carriage at his enemy\u2019s wife. Beatrice St. Aubyn, Countess of Blanchard now, n\u00e9e Corning. Little Beatrice Corning sat across from him bound and gagged. Her eyes were closed over the cloth tied across her mouth. Perhaps she slept, but he doubted it.</p><p>He\u2019d never really paid much attention to her before, besides noting that she made a good hostess for her uncle\u2019s political parties. She was pleasant enough to look at, he supposed, but she was no immortal beauty. Hardly the type a man might choose to die for.</p><p>He grunted and glanced out the window. The night was black with barely any moonlight, and he couldn\u2019t make out where they might be. He let the curtain fall. However, he knew by the number of hours they\u2019d traveled that they must be nearing his estate in Hampshire. He\u2019d told Blanchard that he\u2019d wait until dawn and he would; the boat he\u2019d arranged to pick him up at Portsmouth wouldn\u2019t come until eight. He could wait until dawn and no longer before fleeing to the prearranged rendezvous spot. First to France and then perhaps Prussia or even the East Indies. A man could change his name and start a new life in the more remote corners of the world. And with enough capital, he might even make his fortune again.</p> <p>If he had enough capital. Damnably stupid\u2014he could see that now\u2014tying up most of his monies in investments. Oh, they were good investments, solid investments that would yield a healthy return, but that wasn\u2019t much good to him at the moment, was it? He had a little cash, and he\u2019d taken what jewelry Adriana had in the town house, but they weren\u2019t all that much.</p><p>Not enough to start again as he meant to.</p><p>He eyed the girl across from him, measuring her worth. She was his last gamble, his last chance to take with him a small fortune. Of course he\u2019d never risk his life, his fortune, for any woman, let alone this pale child, but that really wasn\u2019t the gamble was it?</p><p>The real question was whether Blanchard had enough regard for his bride to ransom her for a small fortune... and lose his life as well.</p><p>IT WAS WELL after midnight by the time Reynaud returned home to Blanchard House. The celebration with Vale, Munroe, and Hartley had gone on for hours more and ended in a disreputable tavern that Vale swore brewed the best ale in London. So it was rather commendable that he saw the man lurking in the shadows by the stairs at all.</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019re you doing there?\u201d Reynaud put his hand on his knife, ready to draw it if need be.</p><p>The shadow moved and coalesced into a boy, not more than twelve. \u201c\u2019E said you\u2019d give me a shilling.\u201d</p><p>Reynaud looked up and down the street in case the lad was a diversion. \u201cWho did?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA toff, same as you.\u201d The boy held out a sealed letter.</p><p>Reynaud fished in his pocket and tossed the boy a shilling. The lad scampered off without another word. Reynaud held the letter up. The light was too dim to see much, but he did notice there was no inscription on the outside of the letter. He mounted the steps and went inside, nodding at the yawning footman in the hall. Beatrice was probably abed by now, and he yearned to lie beside her warm softness, but the oddity of the strange missive intrigued him. He went to the sitting room, lit a few candles from the fire, and tore open the letter.</p><p>The handwriting inside was scrawling and partially smeared as if sealed in haste:</p> <p>I won\u2019t be hung.</p><p>Bring me the Blanchard jewels. Come alone to my country estate. Tell no one. Be here by the dawn\u2019s first light. If you come after light, if you come with friends, or if you come without the jewels, you\u2019ll find your wife dead.</p><p>I have her.</p><p>Richard Hasselthorpe</p><p>Reynaud had hardly gotten to the last line when he was running to the sitting room door. \u201cYou!\u201d he shouted at the startled footman. \u201cWhere is your mistress?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy lady hasn\u2019t returned yet this evening.\u201d</p><p>But Reynaud was already leaping up the stairs. This thing was impossible. She must be here. Perhaps she\u2019d slipped past the footman. The note was a joke. He reached her bedchamber and flung open the door.</p><p>Quick jumped to her feet from a chair by the fireplace. \u201cOh, my lord, what is it?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIs Lady Blanchard here?\u201d he demanded, though he could see the bed was still made and empty.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, my lord. She went out this afternoon, to visit parliament, and she hasn\u2019t returned.\u201d</p><p>Dear God. Reynaud stared down at the letter in his hand. I have her. Hasselthorpe\u2019s country estate was hours away, and the dawn would be coming soon.</p><p>THEY\u2019D BEEN TRAVELING for hours. Beatrice stiffened her body, bracing as the carriage lumbered around a corner. She couldn\u2019t use her hands, which had long since fallen asleep because they were bound behind her back, and she was afraid that if she were thrown to the floor, she\u2019d hit her face. She very much doubted that Lord Hasselthorpe would bother to catch her.</p><p>She twisted a bit, trying to work her fingers, but it was useless. She felt the pain from where the rope had cut her wrists, but nothing else. She remembered Reynaud telling her how he\u2019d walked for days in the woods of the New World with his hands tied. How had he withstood such torment? The pain must\u2019ve been intense, the fear that he\u2019d lose his hands terrible. She wished now that she could\u2019ve said something when he\u2019d related his experiences, conveyed her sympathy more eloquently.</p><p>Told him that she loved him.</p><p>She closed her eyes, biting hard on the cloth gag stuffed in her mouth. She would not let this dreadful man see her fear, but she wished\u2014oh, how she wished!\u2014that she\u2019d been able to tell Reynaud that she loved him. She wasn\u2019t sure why she needed to tell him. He might not even care\u2014probably wouldn\u2019t care. He\u2019d shown her affection and passion, but nothing more, nothing that could be called love. Perhaps he no longer had the ability to feel romantic love. It seemed to her that in order to feel true and lasting love, once-in-a-lifetime-if-one-were-lucky real love, one must be prepared to let oneself fall. To give oneself up utterly to the other person if need be. She knew that she could do just that, but Reynaud would not let himself love.</p><p>And still it didn\u2019t seem to matter. Beatrice had discovered that one\u2019s love needn\u2019t be reciprocated in order for it to thrive. It seemed her love was perfectly happy to grow and even bloom in the complete absence of his. There was no controlling it.</p><p>The carriage jolted, and Beatrice wasn\u2019t quite quick enough to brace herself entirely. Her shoulder hit the side painfully.</p><p>\u201cAh,\u201d said Lord Hasselthorpe. It was the first time he\u2019d spoken in hours. \u201cWe\u2019re here.\u201d</p><p>Beatrice craned her neck, trying to see out the window, but what she could see was mostly black. They rounded a curve, and she braced her feet against the floorboards.</p><p>And then the carriage stopped.</p><p>The door was opened by a footman, and Beatrice tried to catch the man\u2019s eye to perhaps gain his sympathy. But he kept his gaze fixed downward, save for one darted glance at Lord Hasselthorpe. There would be no help from that quarter.</p><p>\u201cCome, my lady,\u201d Lord Hasselthorpe said rather nastily, and yanked her to her feet.</p><p>He pushed her ahead of him, out of the carriage, and for a moment she feared she\u2019d fall headlong down the steps. The footman caught her arm to steady her, though he just as hastily let her go. Beatrice looked at him again and saw a faint frown between his brows. Perhaps there was hope of help from him after all.</p><p>But she hadn\u2019t time to consider the matter further, for Lord Hasselthorpe was marching her toward a great mansion. Even in the dark she could see it was a huge building with but one light in one of the lower windows. As they neared the front doors, one was flung open and an ancient manservant stood to the side, holding a candelabra that looked too heavy for his thin wrist.</p><p>\u201cMy lord.\u201d He bowed his head, his expression serene enough to make Beatrice wonder if Lord Hasselthorpe often brought bound-and-gagged ladies to his doorstep.</p><p>Her captor made no acknowledgment of the butler but dragged her up the steps and into the hall.</p><p>It was only after they\u2019d passed the old manservant that the man cleared his throat and said, \u201cHer ladyship is in residence, my lord.\u201d</p><p>Lord Hasselthorpe stopped so suddenly that Beatrice stumbled over her own feet. He absently held her up as he glared at the butler. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>The old man appeared unperturbed at his master\u2019s ire. \u201cLady Hasselthorpe arrived yesterday evening and is even now upstairs asleep.\u201d</p><p>Lord Hasselthorpe scowled at the ceiling as if he could see his wife in bed several floors above. Obviously his wife\u2019s presence at his country estate was a surprise. Beatrice\u2019s heart leaped a little in cautious optimism. Lady Hasselthorpe was not known for her intelligence, but surely she\u2019d protest her husband bringing home kidnapped countesses?</p><p>If Lady Hasselthorpe was ever allowed to see her, that is. For now Lord Hasselthorpe was trotting her quickly toward the back of the house. He turned down a dark passage so narrow that he had to push her ahead of himself, for they would not fit abreast. This ended in a steep flight of stairs that spiraled downward into the depths of the mansion. Beatrice felt sweat start at the small of her back as she descended. The steps were bare stone, well worn and slippery. A fall here might break her neck. Was that what Lord Hasselthorpe intended? Would he kill her out of some strange revenge for Reynaud\u2019s win on the parliament floor? But then why bring her all the way to his country estate merely to murder her? Surely that made no sense.</p><p>Beatrice clung to that minuscule hope as they descended farther into the depths of the mansion. They reached an uneven stone floor at last, and she saw that it was a kind of dungeon. The house above must be built on some type of older fortification. Hasselthorpe backed her into a stone wall. She heard the clank of chains and then felt cold metal against her wrists.</p><p>He stepped away and nodded. \u201cThat\u2019ll hold you until your bastard husband comes to take your place.\u201d</p><p>Beatrice strained, trying to say something, anything to get his attention, but he simply walked away, taking the light with him. She was left in cold, dank darkness. She pulled hard on the chain, hoping the anchor might\u2019ve rotted, but it held fast. And then she could only stand and wait, for the chain would not let her sit. Would she die here, alone in the blackness? Or would Lord Hasselthorpe or one of his servants rescue her? She thought of Reynaud, his angry black eyes, his confident hands, his gentle mouth, and she wept a little, wondering if she\u2019d ever see his dear face again. She knew he wouldn\u2019t come for her, though.</p><p>He\u2019d told her already. He\u2019d not put himself into the power of another ever again.</p><p>REYNAUD\u2019S FISTS SLID against the horse\u2019s sweaty neck. He bent low over the animal, his hands on either side of the beast\u2019s neck, a rein in each hand. He\u2019d traded in his own horse two hours ago when it\u2019d begun to lag, throwing an exorbitant sum at a sleepy innkeeper for his best horse. The gelding was a great bony animal, not pretty, but he had stamina.</p><p>Stamina and speed were all that mattered now.</p><p>Bulging saddlebags were tied behind him. They held a small fortune\u2014every bit of gold he could find in the house, as well as his mother\u2019s jewelry. He\u2019d stuck a pistol in each coat pocket before he\u2019d ridden out of London, though it was mainly his speed that deterred robbers.</p><p>The horse\u2019s gait jarred him with each leap of his great legs, but Reynaud no longer cared. His arms and legs and arse ached, his hands had gone numb, his fingers were stiff with cold, and still he urged the beast on. He rode through black night, hell-for-leather, not caring of potential holes or unseen barriers in the road, endangering both the horse\u2019s neck and his own. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>It didn\u2019t matter. If he wasn\u2019t in Sussex at Hasselthorpe\u2019s door by dawn, that madman would kill Beatrice, and he wouldn\u2019t have a reason to live anyway. It was ironic, really. All this time he\u2019d thought only of what he\u2019d lost and never of what he\u2019d gained. He\u2019d wanted his title, his lands, his money, when all along they meant nothing without her by his side. Those calm gray eyes watching him curiously, showing no fear and no illusion as to who he was. That sweet, amused smile in an otherwise tart expression when she ticked him off for being an ass. The erotic surprise on her face when he entered her, her mouth opening in wonder.</p><p>God! Oh, God! He was going to lose her. Reynaud felt the burn of tears on his cheeks. The dawn was coming soon. He urged the gelding on, hearing the rasp of the horse\u2019s breath, the jingle of the tack, and his own desperate heartbeat in his ears, knowing it was too little, too late. He wasn\u2019t going to make it in time.</p><p>He\u2019d kill the bastard, the murderer of his wife. He\u2019d take his revenge in blood and pain, and then he\u2019d end all this himself.</p><p>If she was dead, he\u2019d have nothing to live for.</p> <p>Chapter Nineteen</p><p>All night Princess Serenity journeyed. As the sun\u2019s first rays blessed the earth, she came to the place where a year ago she had met Longsword. It was a barren spot, devoid of trees or even grass. The princess looked about her but could see no other living thing. Just as she began to wonder if she\u2019d come in vain, a crack appeared in the dry ground. Wider and wider it grew until the Goblin King rose from the depths of the earth.</p><p>His orange eyes glowed bright at the sight of her, and he smiled with yellow fangs as he said, \u201cAnd who might you be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am Princess Serenity,\u201d she replied. \u201cAnd I have come to take my husband\u2019s place in the kingdom of the goblins. . . .\u201d</p><p>\u2014from Longsword</p> <p>It was dark, so dark, and she\u2019d lost track of the time. She could\u2019ve been standing here for minutes or hours, her arms wrenched painfully behind her, her eyes straining uselessly in the blackness. Every now and again she\u2019d nod off despite the pain and fear, but as her body sagged forward, her shoulders would be yanked by the chain on her wrists, and she would startle awake. At first she\u2019d thought the dungeon was silent as well, but as she stood there, she began to hear things. Small rustlings. The scrape of a tiny claw against stone. The slow drip of water somewhere. In the dark, all alone, the sounds should have frightened her more. Instead they were almost comforting. She wasn\u2019t sure she could\u2019ve remained sane if her hearing had been taken away as well as her eyesight.</p><p>Finally she heard footsteps, distant but drawing nearer. She straightened, trying to look serene, trying to be brave. Reynaud had been brave in captivity and so could she. She was a countess. She wouldn\u2019t meet death weeping.</p><p>The door to the dungeon was thrown open, and she flinched away from the lantern light.</p><p>\u201cBeatrice.\u201d</p><p>Oh, dear God, it couldn\u2019t be. She squinted and saw her husband\u2019s broad shoulders blocking the light from the lantern. He was hatless, his boots muddy and scuffed, and he carried a full saddlebag over one shoulder. She jerked forward, her throat working, trying to say something. To warn him. Lord Hasselthorpe had ranted for nearly an hour when first they entered the carriage about the revenge he would inflict on Reynaud.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t touch her,\u201d Lord Hasselthorpe said, and Reynaud stepped aside. Behind him was Lord Hasselthorpe, a gun pointed firmly at Reynaud. \u201cHere she is. You can see that no harm has come to her. Now give me the money.\u201d</p> <p>Reynaud didn\u2019t look at the other man. His eyes were on hers, blazing, black, and dangerous. \u201cTake off her gag.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve already\u2014\u201d</p><p>Reynaud turned his head and hit Lord Hasselthorpe with a stare. \u201cTake it off.\u201d</p><p>Lord Hasselthorpe frowned, but he stepped forward, keeping his eyes on Reynaud. He fumbled, one-handed, with the cloth tied at the back of her head, and then the binding fell.</p><p>Beatrice spat out the wadded cloth in her mouth. \u201cReynaud, he\u2019ll kill you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up,\u201d Lord Hasselthorpe said.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t.\u201d Reynaud took a step toward the other man, seemingly oblivious to the raised gun between them. He stared at Lord Hasselthorpe a moment, then looked at Beatrice, a muscle flexing in his jaw. \u201cHas he hurt you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she whispered. \u201cReynaud, you cannot.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHush.\u201d He shook his head slightly and almost smiled. \u201cYou\u2019re alive. That\u2019s all that matters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s alive and I want the money,\u201d Lord Hasselthorpe said impatiently.</p><p>\u201cWhat guarantee can you give me that she\u2019ll go free?\u201d Reynaud was staring at her, as if memorizing her features.</p><p>Beatrice felt ice begin to form at her center. \u201cReynaud,\u201d she whispered, pleading now.</p><p>\u201cMy wife is in residence,\u201d Lord Hasselthorpe said. \u201cShe has nothing to do with this. I\u2019ll put Lady Blanchard into her care and send the both of them to London. I\u2019ve already sent a footman to bring Adriana here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t intend to take your wife with you?\u201d Reynaud\u2019s eyes were horribly gentle, and though he spoke to the other man, his gaze never left her face.</p><p>\u201cWhy should I?\u201d Lord Hasselthorpe replied impatiently.</p><p>The corner of Reynaud\u2019s mouth twitched. How could he find any of this amusing? \u201cA certain sentimentality, perhaps?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t time for sentimentality or your wit,\u201d Lord Hasselthorpe snapped. \u201cIf you want your wife to live to see the dawn\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery well.\u201d Reynaud threw the saddlebag at Lord Hasselthorpe\u2019s feet just as Lady Hasselthorpe appeared in the doorway to the dungeon.</p><p>\u201cWhy, my lord, you didn\u2019t tell me we had guests,\u201d Lady Hasselthorpe exclaimed as if being woken before dawn to greet callers in the dungeon was perfectly normal. She seemed not to notice that her husband held a gun on one of her \u201cguests.\u201d</p><p>She made to step into the dungeon, but the burly footman by her side prevented her. \u201cBest not, my lady. \u2019Tis dirty down here.\u201d</p><p>Lord Hasselthorpe nodded to the man. Despite the footman\u2019s words, his real reason for stopping her must be so that she wouldn\u2019t get too near Reynaud.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like you to take Lady Blanchard to London, my dear,\u201d Lord Hasselthorpe said. \u201cShe\u2019s ill and Lord Blanchard and I have business to discuss.\u201d He reached behind Beatrice with one hand and unlocked the chains about her wrists.</p><p>Beatrice\u2019s heart sank. \u201cReynaud, I can\u2019t leave you here.\u201d</p><p>Lord Hasselthorpe gave Reynaud a hard look. \u201cIt matters not to me, but you know the alternative.\u201d</p><p>Reynaud\u2019s mouth thinned. \u201cLet me talk to her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs you wish.\u201d</p><p>Reynaud bent to her ear, his face against hers. Beatrice\u2019s hands were still tied behind her back. She wished they were free so she might feel his dear face.</p><p>\u201cYou must leave with Lady Hasselthorpe,\u201d he whispered in her ear.</p><p>She felt hot tears overflow her eyes. \u201cNo. No, you said you would never put yourself in another man\u2019s power again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was wrong.\u201d His breath caught on a quiet laugh that blew against her cheek. He smelled of horse and leather and her husband. \u201cSo very wrong. I was foolish and vain, and I nearly didn\u2019t realize it in time. I nearly lost you. But I didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReynaud,\u201d she sobbed.</p><p>\u201cShh,\u201d he whispered. \u201cYou asked me if I loved you. I do. I love you more than life itself. Nothing matters in this world but that you live. Can you do that for me? Can you live?\u201d</p><p>What could she say? He was sacrificing himself, she knew that. Sacrificing himself for her and he wanted her to just walk out of this room and leave him here....She shook her head, her throat swollen shut with grief.</p><p>He took her face between his palms and looked at her, and for the first time since his return, she saw the laughing boy of the portrait in his black eyes. They stared at her, confident and whole, with the hint of a mischievous gleam.</p><p>\u201cYes, you can,\u201d he said in that low, deep voice she loved so much. \u201cFor me. Live for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d she whispered, and she saw gladness in his eyes.</p><p>She turned, stumbling, and walked from that hellhole. Lord Hasselthorpe said something, and Lady Hasselthorpe babbled and chirped, but she heard none of it, because she was leaving Reynaud behind. She turned one last time at the door and looked over her shoulder.</p><p>Reynaud was kneeling next to the stone wall where she\u2019d been chained. She saw that there were three iron rings set in the stone wall. She\u2019d been chained to the middle one, but now iron links were threaded through the two outer rings. Reynaud\u2019s strong arms were outstretched wide, and Lord Hasselthorpe was watching as the burly footman fastened chains to his wrists. The cold stone floor must\u2019ve been hard against Reynaud\u2019s knees, and she knew the chains were painful, but he met her eyes and smiled at her.</p><p>Smiled as they chained his arms in a cross.</p><p>WHEN HE\u2019D ESCAPED from captivity, so many months ago now, he\u2019d vowed that he\u2019d never let himself be caught alive again. He\u2019d sworn to himself that he\u2019d die before being taken by an enemy. And he\u2019d meant that vow, truly.</p><p>But now Reynaud broke that vow. He kneeled at the feet of his foe, his arms stretched wide and chained to the wall, helpless, and he was glad. None of it mattered as long as Beatrice was alive. He could face this and worse as long as she lived.</p><p>Hasselthorpe bent and opened the saddlebags. Mater\u2019s sapphire necklace spilled into the lantern light. Hasselthorpe grunted and picked up the jewels.</p><p>\u201cVery nice.\u201d The dark blue stones sparkled as he examined them. \u201cThe Blanchard jewels, if I\u2019m not mistaken.\u201d He grinned at Reynaud.</p><p>Reynaud shrugged. \u201cYou\u2019re not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery nice indeed.\u201d Hasselthorpe shoved the necklace back in the leather pouch and began tying the cords as he spoke to the brute of a footman. \u201cSee that my horse is ready and my bag brought down. The boat sails in two hours, and I must be away to meet it in time.\u201d</p><p>For the first time, the big servant showed signs of independent thought. He hesitated, glancing at Reynaud. \u201cAn\u2019 him?\u201d</p><p>Hasselthorpe looked at the footman coldly. \u201cThat\u2019s none of your business.\u201d</p><p>The man shifted from one foot to the other. \u201cBut, see, they\u2019ll blame me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor him.\u201d The footman jerked his chin in Reynaud\u2019s direction. \u201cYou\u2019ll be gone and I\u2019ll have a dead aristocrat on me hands, and the first one they\u2019ll be looking at will be me.\u201d</p><p>Reynaud grinned. The man had a point.</p><p>\u201cOh, for God\u2019s sake,\u201d Hasselthorpe burst out just as the door opened to the dungeon.</p><p>Lady Hasselthorpe entered with Beatrice behind her.</p><p>Christ! Reynaud lunged against his chains, but the thick iron links held. Hasselthorpe swung toward the door, his gun pointed at Beatrice.</p><p>\u201cGet out!\u201d Reynaud ordered. Beatrice was looking at him, her sweet face set in mulish determination. He pulled at the chains with all his strength and felt a slight give.</p><p>Hasselthorpe turned toward him as the chains clanked. The lantern\u2019s light glinted off the barrel of the pistol in his hand. Hasselthorpe raised it as Reynaud bared his teeth in defiance.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Beatrice screamed.</p><p>Lady Hasselthorpe rushed toward her husband. \u201cRichard! Have you lost your mind?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeatrice!\u201d Reynaud lunged again, and the iron ring holding his right wrist burst from the wall.</p><p>Hasselthorpe swung toward him with the gun, but Lady Hasselthorpe was there, and Beatrice, damn her, Beatrice threw herself against the man.</p><p>The gun exploded with a deafening thunderclap, echoing off the stone walls and ceiling. For a moment, everyone froze. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBeatrice,\u201d Reynaud whispered.</p><p>She looked at him, her eyes puzzled, and raised a hand toward him.</p><p>Blood streaked her fingers.</p><p>SHE\u2019D BEEN NEARLY deafened by the pistol\u2019s report, but Beatrice still heard Reynaud\u2019s angry roar. He sounded like an enraged lion, like some fiery archangel come from heaven to wreak vengeance on a mortal man. He leaped forward, his freed right hand outstretched toward Lord Hasselthorpe. The chain shrieked against the iron ring, and he jerked back, his fingertips brushing Lord Hasselthorpe\u2019s sleeve.</p> <p>\u201cDear God!\u201d Lord Hasselthorpe exclaimed. He fell against Beatrice, grasping at her arm.</p><p>It was the wrong thing to do.</p><p>Reynaud roared again and lunged. The other iron ring exploded from the wall. He was on Lord Hasselthorpe in one bound, tearing the man away from Beatrice.</p><p>Lady Hasselthorpe screamed.</p><p>Reynaud hit the other man in the face with a horrible smacking sound, and Lord Hasselthorpe fell to the ground. Reynaud followed him down to the stone floor, kneeling above him, his balled fist driving again and again into Lord Hasselthorpe\u2019s face.</p> <p>\u201cStop him!\u201d Lady Hasselthorpe clutched Beatrice\u2019s arm. \u201cHe\u2019ll kill Richard.\u201d</p><p>He would, too. Reynaud showed no signs of halting, though the other man had long since ceased resisting.</p><p>\u201cReynaud,\u201d she said. \u201cReynaud!\u201d</p><p>He stopped abruptly, his chest heaving, his hands, bloody, hanging by his sides and the chains still dangling from his wrists.</p><p>Beatrice went to him and hesitantly touched his short, black hair. \u201cReynaud.\u201d</p><p>He turned suddenly and laid his face against her stomach, his big hands grasping her hips. \u201cHe hurt you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said, stroking his dear head, feeling his warmth beneath her palms. \u201cNo. The blood was his. The bullet must\u2019ve hit him somewhere. I am not hurt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could not bear it,\u201d he said against her. \u201cI couldn\u2019t bear it if you were hurt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t,\u201d she whispered. She took his hands, large and bruised, in hers and drew him up. \u201cI\u2019m whole and safe. You\u2019ve rescued me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said as he stood. \u201cI am the one who is rescued. I was lost and broken, and you saved me.\u201d He bent and whispered against her lips, \u201cYou have redeemed me.\u201d</p><p>He pulled her close, and she came willingly, happily, into the arms of the man she loved.</p><p>And who loved her in return.</p><p>Chapter Twenty</p><p>At the princess\u2019s words, the Goblin King threw back his head and laughed until his green hair waved all about his head. \u201cYou shall be a delightful addition to my menagerie, my dear.\u201d</p> <p>He held out his horny hand. Princess Serenity laid her own small white hand in the Goblin King\u2019s palm. At that very moment, Longsword appeared at a dead run.</p><p>\u201cStop!\u201d he cried when he saw them. \u201cStop this dreadful thing! I did not know what my wife meant to do, but when I woke in the dark and found her gone, I suspected the worst. I have run all this night to prevent this thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh,\u201d sighed the Goblin King. \u201cBut you are still too late. The pact between your wife and I has already been agreed upon and sealed. There is naught you can do. She is forfeit to me. . . .\u201d</p><p>\u2014from Longsword</p><p>\u201cWhat will happen to Lord Hasselthorpe?\u201d Beatrice asked later\u2014much later\u2014that day. She sat at her dressing table in her chemise, brushing her hair.</p><p>She watched Reynaud in the mirror. He lounged on the bed, his banyan falling open to reveal his bare chest. He\u2019d discarded shoes and stockings, but he still wore his breeches. She\u2019d almost lost him today, and the horror was still close to the surface. If she\u2019d had her way, she would\u2019ve shadowed him all day, just to watch him breathe. But they\u2019d had to part early this morning. Reynaud had been concerned with taking Lord Hasselthorpe to prison, and she\u2019d made an exhausting journey back to London in the company of a distraught Lady Hasselthorpe. The poor woman had had no idea of her husband\u2019s murderous character, and moreover it seemed that she\u2019d truly loved the awful man. Beatrice had spent the ride trying to comfort her.</p><p>As a result of all this, she\u2019d only been reunited with Reynaud shortly after dinner, when he\u2019d embraced her hurriedly and excused himself to bathe. His hair was still damp from that bath, she could see, and she wanted to touch it, but she restrained herself, feeling unaccountably shy.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll be charged with treason and murder,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd when he\u2019s found guilty, he\u2019ll be hanged.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow awful for Lady Hasselthorpe.\u201d Beatrice shivered a little, placing her brush carefully on the dressing table. \u201cDid he really inform the French of your regiment\u2019s movements solely to kill his brother?\u201d</p><p>Reynaud shrugged, causing his banyan to fall farther open. \u201cHe was probably paid as well, but I think the main reason was so he could steal his brother\u2019s title.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat a terrible man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIndeed.\u201d</p><p>Beatrice swiveled on her stool to look at him fully. \u201cI never thanked you for what you did to help pass Mr. Wheaton\u2019s bill.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to thank me,\u201d he replied quietly. \u201cThe men the bill benefits are soldiers. My men. I should\u2019ve been more interested in the bill all along, instead of worrying solely about myself.\u201d</p><p>She stood, walking toward him. \u201cYou\u2019d lost everything. There was a reason you were focused on what you needed to have again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He shook his head and looked away, a muscle tightening in his jaw. \u201cI thought only of money and lands and my title. I didn\u2019t consider what was truly important until it was almost too late.\u201d</p><p>She felt her throat tighten. She climbed into the bed to sit beside him and trailed her fingers down his chest. \u201cAnd what is that?\u201d</p><p>He turned and seized her hand, making her start.</p><p>\u201cYou.\u201d He kissed the tips of her fingers, watching her with black eyes so serious they nearly frightened her. \u201cYou. Only you. I realized it on the ride to Hasselthorpe\u2019s estate\u2014realized it and knew I was too late. God, Beatrice. I rode for hours thinking that you would be dead before I got there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you might not come,\u201d she admitted.</p><p>He closed his eyes as if in agony. \u201cYou must\u2019ve been terrified. You must hate me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She drew their joined hands toward her mouth and kissed his knuckles. \u201cI could never hate you. I love you.\u201d</p><p>He grabbed her and rolled her under himself in a sudden movement. His position was dominating and aggressive. She should\u2019ve been wary, but she had no fear of him at all.</p><p>Reynaud leaned close to her, nearly nose to nose. \u201cDon\u2019t say it unless you mean it. There\u2019ll be no going back\u2014no holding back\u2014once you\u2019re truly mine. I do not have it in me to let go once I have what I desire in my grasp. Tread softly.\u201d</p><p>She framed his face with her palms. \u201cI won\u2019t tread softly. I want to go running and leaping. I\u2019ll shout it from the rooftops. I love you. I\u2019ve loved you since you came crashing into my tea party. Before that, really\u2014ever since I was a young girl and saw that roguish portrait of you in the blue sitting room. I love you, Reynaud. I love\u2014\u201d</p><p>He covered her mouth with his, swallowing her words. She slid her hands up, reveling in the smooth feel of his hair beneath her hands. He was alive. She was alive. Joy flashed through her, and she widened her legs beneath him in invitation.</p><p>Fortunately, he seemed to have the same idea.</p><p>He tore his mouth from hers, gasping as he fumbled between their bodies. \u201cYou are mine. Forever, Beatrice.\u201d</p><p>He levered himself up and pulled at the skirts of her chemise. Something ripped and then she felt his hot penis against her folds. He thrust into her, once, twice, and was fully seated, but he froze then.</p><p>His head dropped and he shuddered. \u201cBeatrice.\u201d</p><p>She stretched slowly, sensuously.</p><p>\u201cGod, don\u2019t,\u201d he muttered. \u201cBeatrice . . .\u201d</p><p>She wrapped one leg over his calves and the other high over his hips. \u201cHmm?\u201d</p><p>She clenched internally.</p><p>His flesh leaped within her. \u201cChrist.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo that again,\u201d she murmured, tilting her hips against his. He was heavy on her\u2014she couldn\u2019t displace him\u2014but she could sort of undulate, which she did.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to kill me,\u201d he whispered, lowering his forehead to hers.</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d She slid her hands inside his banyan, kneading his bare back.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he groaned. \u201cAnd I\u2019ll die a happy man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen let us die together,\u201d she whispered against his lips.</p><p>She kissed him then, a tender caress, light and sweet, her lips slightly parted, trying to show him how much she loved him, for she truly had no words to tell him.</p><p>And perhaps he understood. He gasped a little, moving his hands to frame her face, raising his own to watch her as he began to move above her. He withdrew and pushed into her, only a little, the movement tiny and controlled, the effect devastating to her senses. She watched him, this man she loved, this man who\u2019d offered his life for hers, as he made love to her. His face was hard and grim, the bird tattoos exotic and foreboding, but his mouth was gentle, and his eyes held an emotion that made her arch up into him.</p><p>\u201cBeatrice,\u201d he whispered, and began to move faster.</p><p>She gripped him, her muscles tightening, her breathing quickening, watching him, waiting. He hitched himself a little higher on her, grinding down, hitting her just there. And she broke. Suddenly, without warning. Gasping and shaking and crying, pressing herself up urgently into him, staring into those ruthless black eyes. Heat crashed through her, seemingly without end.</p><p>\u201cBeatrice,\u201d he cried. \u201cGod! Beatrice!\u201d</p><p>And he convulsed above her, shuddering as he flooded her with his seed. Shaking, his black eyes wide and desperate, his mouth twisted as if in agony. He slowly closed his eyes and let his head drop as his great chest heaved for breath.</p><p>She stroked his back in little tired circles, her body replete, her mind at rest.</p><p>He bent his head and kissed her, his mouth opened wide, his tongue claiming possession. She arched again, helplessly, her nerves still raw.</p><p>He lifted his head and looked at her. \u201cI love you, Beatrice. Now and forever. I love you.\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cAnd I love you. Now and forever.\u201d It was like a new beginning. A new pact.</p><p>So she pulled his head down to seal it with a kiss.</p><p>\u201cTHEN HE\u2019S BEEN condemned,\u201d Samuel Hartley said sotto voce nearly a month later.</p><p>\u201cCondemned and scheduled to be hanged afore the new year,\u201d Reynaud replied equally quietly. The gentlemen stood in a group to one side of his blue sitting room, but the ladies weren\u2019t too far away, and they had damnably sharp hearing. The topic wasn\u2019t appropriate for the day.</p><p>\u201cServes him right,\u201d Reginald St. Aubyn said, not at all quietly. He saw Vale\u2019s raised eyebrow and flushed. \u201cTold you I never would\u2019ve backed the man had I known he\u2019d murdered his brother, let alone was a traitor to the Crown. Good God.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone of us knew,\u201d Munroe growled. \u201c\u2019Tisn\u2019t your fault, man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d Reginald cleared his throat, looking surprised. \u201cWell, thank you.\u201d</p><p>Hartley leaned forward to say something else, and Reynaud bit back a smile. In the last month, he\u2019d gotten used to having \u201cUncle Reggie\u201d about the place, and while he wouldn\u2019t call the other man his bosom bow yet, they were getting along rather well. It\u2019d helped that Reggie had quite the knack for managing money, making it grow by leaps and bounds. But then he would\u2019ve borne with Reggie even if he\u2019d been the most curmudgeonly old man possible. He\u2019d raised Beatrice and she loved him. That was all that mattered in the end. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He glanced to where the ladies were gathered in a knot by one of the settees. Beatrice stood by the others, smiling at something Lady Munroe had said. She wore a pale rose frock tonight, and her hair glowed golden in the candlelight. The Blanchard sapphires sparkled at her neck, but even they were dull next to the bright beauty of her face. Had they been alone, he would\u2019ve strode over and picked her up, carrying her to his bed so that he might demonstrate again how deep his devotion was. He had a feeling that the urgency of the need to convince her of his love would never pass. He inhaled deeply. But they had guests now, and he wouldn\u2019t have Beatrice to himself for several hours yet.</p><p>Reynaud glanced to Emeline, sitting in the middle of the settee, as round as an orange. He\u2019d noticed that Hartley cast frequent glances her way, and he had to approve of such uxorious concern for his sister. Lady Munroe\u2014Helen\u2014stood just a little apart, though all the ladies included her in the conversation, and Tante Cristelle sat enthroned in a gilt chair. Lady Vale sat beside Emeline on the settee, ramrod straight, a faint smile about her thin lips.</p><p>Feminine laughter drew his eyes to another settee, where Miss Rebecca Hartley sat. Standing stiffly next to her was a young man in simple black clothes, his dark hair clubbed back.</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019ll have a new brother-in-law in the coming year,\u201d Hartley murmured next to Reynaud.</p> <p>Reynaud grunted. \u201cEmeline says he was a footman in her household.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIndeed.\u201d Hartley glanced again at his wife. \u201cBut O\u2019Hare has spent the last year learning my business in the Colonies. His head for figures is amazing. I\u2019ve been thinking that should Emeline and I wish to spend a protracted length of time in England, I\u2019d put him in charge of the Boston warehouses.\u201d</p><p>Reynaud raised his eyebrows. \u201cHe looks young for the job.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe is,\u201d Hartley replied. \u201cBut in another few years . . .\u201d He shrugged. \u201cOf course, it would help to keep the business in the family.\u201d</p><p>Reynaud glanced again at the couple by the settee. Miss Hartley\u2019s cheeks were a bright pink, and O\u2019Hare hadn\u2019t taken his eyes from her face since entering the room. \u201cThen you approve of the match.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, I do.\u201d Hartley\u2019s mouth quirked. \u201cNot that my opinion matters. I trust Rebecca to make the right decision in choosing a husband.\u201d</p><p>A sudden rise in the ladies\u2019 chatter made Reynaud turn his head. Beatrice was leaning forward, placing a package on Emeline\u2019s lap.</p><p>\u201cWhat are they up to now?\u201d Hartley wondered next to him.</p><p>Reynaud shook his head, feeling that smile returning at Beatrice\u2019s excited look. \u201cI haven\u2019t the faintest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTHE GENTLEMEN, THEY are talking about that so \u2019orrible traitor again,\u201d Tante Cristelle commented to no one in particular.</p><p>Beatrice glanced over. The gentlemen were all huddled in a corner, and Lord Hasselthorpe was a frequent topic of discussion, but Reynaud looked almost lighthearted tonight. He caught her watching him and gave her a slow wink that made the heat rush into her cheeks. Goodness! Now was not the time to be remembering what he\u2019d done just this morning to her.</p> <p>Hurriedly she turned to Emeline. \u201cOpen it, please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no need for gifts,\u201d Emeline said, but she looked quite pleased nonetheless.</p><p>Beatrice had learned in the last month that her sister-in-law was rather nice underneath her formidable exterior. \u201cActually, it\u2019s for Lady Vale and Lady Munroe and me as well. But you\u2019ll see. Oh, do open it.\u201d</p><p>Emeline lifted the box lid. Inside were four bound books, each a different color. One was blue, one yellow, one lavender, and one scarlet.</p><p>Emeline glanced up at Beatrice. \u201cWhat are they?\u201d</p><p>Beatrice shook her head. \u201cLook inside one.\u201d</p><p>Emeline chose the blue and opened it. And then she gasped. \u201cOh. Oh, my goodness. I\u2019d almost forgotten.\u201d</p><p>She looked from Melisande to Helen to Beatrice. \u201cHow...?\u201d</p> <p>Tante Cristelle leaned forward. \u201cWhat is this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the fairy-tale book that my nanny used to read to Reynaud and me when we were children. Forgive me.\u201d Emeline dabbed at her eyes with her fingertips. \u201cI gave the original book to Melisande to translate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I did,\u201d Melisande said in her steady voice. \u201cAnd when I was done, I gave the translation to Helen to transcribe. She has such an elegant hand.\u201d</p><p>Helen blushed. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe gave me back the sheets of papers\u2014she\u2019d made four copies\u2014but for a long while I did not know what to do with them,\u201d Melisande said. \u201cWhen Beatrice married Reynaud, I gave them to her to bind into a book. But I had no idea she\u2019d made four books.\u201d</p><p>Beatrice smiled. \u201cEach of us worked on it, so I thought each of us should have a book of the fairy tales as a memento.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Emeline said softly. \u201cThank you, Melisande and Helen, and you as well, Beatrice. This is a wonderful gift.\u201d She cradled the blue book against her breast and glanced at the gentlemen. \u201cFor so long, all I had were memories of Reynaud, and this book was one of the best. Now I have him back again. I\u2019m so grateful.\u201d</p><p>Beatrice had to dab at her own eyes. Reynaud was back, and she was grateful as well.</p><p>The door to the sitting room opened at that moment, revealing the magnificent form of the butler. \u201cDinner is served, my lord.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh. Good,\u201d Reynaud said. He strode to where Tante Cristelle sat and bowed to her. \u201cI know \u2019tisn\u2019t the done thing for a gentleman to escort his wife to dinner, but we are still newly wed. Might I have dispensation this once?\u201d</p><p>That old lady glared at him with steely pale blue eyes, but then they softened. \u201cTch. Silly boy. But it is Christmas Day, after all, so I forgive you.\u201d She waved her hand at him. \u201cTake your wife. All of you, take your wives. And you\u201d\u2014she crooked a finger at an alarmed Uncle Reggie\u2014\u201cyou may escort me!\u201d</p><p>Reynaud offered his arm to Beatrice as their guests assembled to be led in to dinner. She placed her fingers on his sleeve, and he tilted his head toward hers. \u201cHave I wished you a Merry Christmas yet, madam?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have,\u201d she said. \u201cSeveral times. But I don\u2019t grow weary of hearing it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019m afraid I\u2019ll never grow weary of saying it.\u201d His obsidian eyes danced. \u201cNow or in the future. So let me say it once again, the first of many more: Merry Christmas, my love. Merry Christmas, my darling Beatrice.\u201d</p><p>And he kissed her.</p><p>Epilogue</p><p>At the Goblin King\u2019s awful words, Longsword fell to his knees before him. He drew his magical sword and laid it on the ground at the Goblin King\u2019s feet and said, \u201cI will give you my sword, though it means my own death, if you will only let my wife go.\u201d</p><p>The Goblin King stared, so shocked his orange eyes nearly popped from his head. \u201cYou would forfeit your life for this woman?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGladly,\u201d was Longsword\u2019s simple answer.</p><p>The Goblin King turned to Princess Serenity. \u201cAnd you, you have decided to sacrifice yourself for all eternity for this man?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have already said so,\u201d the princess replied.</p><p>\u201cARGH!\u201d the Goblin King cried in frustration, tearing at his green hair. \u201cThen this is True Love\u2014a terrible thing!\u2014for I can have no truck with so powerful a force as True Love.\u201d He bent to pick up the sword but hissed as the mere touch of the metal burned his evil flesh. \u201cBah! Even the sword is tainted by love! This is a most dissatisfactory turn of events!\u201d</p><p>And the Goblin King, provoked beyond endurance, vanished back into the crack in the earth from whence he came.</p><p>Princess Serenity came and sank to her knees before her husband, who still knelt in the dust.</p><p>She took his hands and said, \u201cI do not understand. You hated the Goblin Kingdom; you told me so. Why, then, did you seek to prevent my sacrifice?\u201d</p><p>Longsword raised his wife\u2019s hands to his lips and kissed them one at a time. \u201cLife without you would be worse than an eternity in the Goblin Kingdom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you do love me?\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cWith all my heart,\u201d he replied.</p><p>Princess Serenity shivered and glanced at the spot where the Goblin King had stood. \u201cDo you think he\u2019ll return for us?\u201d</p><p>Longsword smiled. \u201cDid you not hear, my sweet? We have a magic so powerful it can defeat the Goblin King himself. It is our love for each other.\u201d</p><p>And he kissed her. </p> </body></html>"]
