He didn\u2019t make it.\u201d</p><p>My lips feel numb as I say the words, \u201cHe\u2019s dead?\u201d</p> <p>Dr. Solomon touches my arm, his expression grave. \u201cYes. I\u2019m so very sorry.\u201d</p><p>The muscles in my face are frozen \u2013 solid. Which is probably a good thing because I don\u2019t want him to see what I\u2019m truly feeling.</p><p>Elation. Relief. Complete and utter relief.</p><p>Oliver is dead.</p><p>I want to laugh.</p> <p>\u201cMia, are you okay? Maybe you should sit down.\u201d</p><p>I feel Dr. Solomon\u2019s hand on my arm, guiding me to sit on one of the plastic chairs in the waiting room.</p><p>I can\u2019t believe Oliver\u2019s dead.</p><p>I can feel the relief bubbling up inside me.</p><p>\u201cCould I have some water?\u201d I ask Dr. Solomon.</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p> <p>He leaves the room, and I\u2019m grateful for the moment alone.</p><p>Oliver is dead.</p><p>I\u2019m free.</p><p>Free.</p><p>I wrap my arms around myself, hugging tight.</p><p>In exhilaration? In comfort?</p><p>Maybe both.</p><p>I guess I should feel something in the form of grief that my father is dead.</p> <p>But honestly I don\u2019t. I really and truly don\u2019t.</p><p>And I\u2019m glad about that.</p><p>Happy.</p><p>Then I feel something form on my lips.</p><p>Something that hasn\u2019t happened to me in a really long time; not for real anyway. A smile.</p><p>I touch a finger to my lips.</p><p>There it is; an honest to god smile.</p><p>I hear movement by the door \u2013 Dr. Solomon.</p><p>I force the smile away and relax my features to neutral.</p><p>Dr. Solomon takes the seat beside me and hands me a plastic cup filled with ice water. The cold against my fingers makes me shiver.</p><p>He puts his hand on my shoulder and squeezes it in comfort. He probably thinks I\u2019m shivering from shock.</p><p>I want to push his hand off. I hate people touching me. I hate men\u2019s hands touching me.</p><p>\u201cIs there anyone I can call?\u201d he asks.</p><p>He\u2019s asking this, but he knows there isn\u2019t anyone. Oliver was my only family.</p><p>I shake my head.</p><p>\u201cAre you going to be okay?\u201d he asks, releasing his hand from my shoulder, resting it back in his lap.</p><p>I glance up at him and nod.</p><p>I can\u2019t speak because if I do, I\u2019ll quite possibly tell that I\u2019m going to be more than okay.</p><p>Not really what I should be saying minutes after finding out that my father has just died, but it\u2019s the truth. For the first time in my life, I can honestly say that I\u2019m really and truly going to be okay.</p><p>Chapter One</p><p>Mia</p><p>Eight months later...</p><p>I push an errant strand of hair back with my hand. Setting down the roll of tape, I survey the boxes piled around me. For the last few days, I\u2019ve been boxing Oliver\u2019s things to give to Goodwill. It\u2019s been eight months since he died of a heart attack, but trust me, I wasn\u2019t hanging onto them out of any sentimentality. I was just putting off having myself near anything of his, but now the house has finally sold after being on the market for six months, so everything has to go.</p><p>I feel no sadness. Nothing. Just relief that he\u2019s gone, and then a big black void of emptiness. I\u2019ve felt this exact way from the moment I found out he\u2019d died.</p><p>How ironic it is that he died of a heart attack? The great Oliver Monroe, respected and revered heart surgeon, dies from a heart attack.</p><p>I like to think of it as divine retribution.</p><p>The only one who could have saved him was himself. Maybe punishment does eventually come to those who deserve it. I need to believe that because it\u2019s the only thing that\u2019s keeping me hanging on.</p><p>You know the saying \u2018from bad to worse\u2019? Well, my situation is kind of like that, but more like \u2018from worse, to a diluted version of worse, but still shit nonetheless\u2019.</p><p>I moved out of my home\u2014it\u2019s a joke for me to call it that. A home is somewhere you feel safe, but I hadn\u2019t felt safe in this house for even a moment.</p><p>I woke up one night, panicked and terrified from a nightmare. I thought Oliver was coming to get me, but then I suddenly realized that I was no longer trapped; that I could leave this place that closeted my nightmares.</p><p>So the next day, I put the house on the market and bought an apartment close to school and close to my boyfriend Forbes.</p><p>We started dating a month after Oliver died.</p><p>The instant I\u2019d realized I was free of my father, I went a little wild. Well, wild for me. I went out to bars drinking, something I had never been allowed to do before.</p><p>I didn\u2019t really know what I was looking for, or what I was hoping to find ... but that was when I found Forbes.</p><p>Or maybe he found me.</p><p>We met in a bar. He approached me, offered to buy me a drink. He was charming. I was flattered. No one had ever paid me attention the way Forbes had that night. Like everything I said mattered.</p><p>I fell into him like he was a vat of melted chocolate, but I later found out that Forbes is more like quicksand.</p><p>Dating quickly morphed into Forbes becoming my boyfriend.</p><p>My first boyfriend.</p><p>My first everything.</p><p>I was happy. Exuberant.</p><p>That quickly changed.</p><p>Four months ago I discovered that I had gotten myself into a relationship with the exact same man as my father when Forbes backhanded me during a disagreement.</p><p>Really, I should have seen it coming. Forbes is the epitome of Oliver, except instead of being a doctor, Forbes is well on his way to becoming a successful lawyer.</p><p>Everyone loves him. He\u2019s stupidly handsome. Smart. Charming. You know the type.</p><p>I should have known that, behind closed doors, the similarity to my father would be akin there too.</p><p>Cold-hearted. Physically and emotionally abusive.</p><p>Why do I stay?</p><p>Because it\u2019s all I know.</p><p>All I have ever known.</p><p>Like a bee drawn to honey, I was drawn to a man like Forbes because the life he offers is the one I\u2019m used to.</p><p>It\u2019s easy to be worthless to someone, but to matter to someone ... well, I think that would be harder.</p><p>I\u2019m not playing for sympathy here. My life is what it is. I live it. There are people out there who are far worse off than I am. Children living with famine and loss, and dying every single day without reason and cause. So yes, I can cope with the occasional beating.</p><p>I do believe that everyone has a pain and coping ability that is individual to them, and if you want to feel sorry for yourself because of the hand life dealt you, then that\u2019s your god given right\u2014I won\u2019t judge you for that.</p><p>I spent a long time crying my heart out because of the life I had. Then the tears dried up, and I got up and carried on.</p><p>I live to my worth. That\u2019s what Oliver taught me.</p><p>And there are good times. Little rays of sunshine on a bleak, cloudy day where Forbes shines through, reminding me of why I care about him.</p><p>Until the next time he splits my lip or cracks my ribs.</p><p>I don\u2019t love Forbes. I tell him I do because he wants to hear it, but really I don\u2019t.</p><p>In the beginning, I thought I did, but what did I know of love? I\u2019d never been shown it to know what it was. It had taken me a while before I realized that what I felt for Forbes was nothing more than my own feelings being reflected through my utter desperation to be loved by someone.</p><p>Forbes showed me affection in the beginning\u2014so I, of course, gorged like the needy person I am.</p><p>The one lesson I\u2019ve learned is that if I were ever blessed to fall in love in the future, I would be able to tell it from my own wants and see it for the real thing.</p><p>Not that I ever see love happening in my future.</p><p>I\u2019ll be with Forbes until the day I die. Which could be sooner rather than later. One wrong hit is all it takes. Then I\u2019ll be with my mother.</p><p>I never knew my mother. She died when I was a baby. Oliver wouldn\u2019t talk about her. I\u2019ve never even seen a picture \u2013 he got rid of all traces of her when she died. All I know is that she was called Anna and that she died in a car accident four months after I was born.</p><p>I\u2019ve often wondered if that was why Oliver hated me so much. Because I was here, but she wasn\u2019t, and I reminded him of her.</p><p>I have her painted in my mind like an angel. She\u2019s one of the things that got me through the hard years with Oliver. I used to imagine how life would have been if she were still here. Would he have been the way he was? And if he were, I know she would have taken me away with her.</p><p>I know, because it\u2019s what I would have done, and I have to get that from her. Oliver didn\u2019t have one speck of goodness inside him, so it has to have come from my mom.</p><p>Thirsty, I head downstairs to the kitchen. The sound of my bare feet slapping against the tiles haunts me. Shivers run across my skin, fighting horrors to the surface.</p><p>Taking a deep breath, I close my eyes and calm myself before walking on, quietly this time. Before going to the fridge, I turn the TV on to fill the space with noise. I pull a bottle of water from the fridge, unscrew the cap and lean back against the counter.</p><p>My cell starts to vibrate against my butt.</p><p>I pull it from my pocket. I don\u2019t have to check the screen to know who it will be; Forbes. I don\u2019t have any real friends, not ones who call me anyway.</p><p>Growing up, I\u2019d kept my distance from other kids. I\u2019d wanted friends, desperately so, but I couldn\u2019t let anyone close because of the way Oliver was. It wasn\u2019t a risk I could take.</p><p>After a while, I\u2019d become the weird kid. The loner.</p><p>I could have changed that when Oliver died, but I didn\u2019t see any real point, and even less so when I met Forbes. He isn\u2019t exactly big on me having girlfriends. He likes control, and I\u2019m easier as a solo project.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d I answer.</p><p>\u201cHey babe, how much longer are you going to be?\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s in a good mood. Thank god.</p><p>\u201cNot too much longer. I just have the attic to finish, and then I\u2019m heading home. That just leaves Oliver\u2019s office to do tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShall I come over tonight?\u201d</p><p>No.</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d I force bright and bubbly into my voice.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve missed you these last few days,\u201d he says quietly down the phone.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve missed you too.\u201d Not once.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll make up for it tonight.\u201d</p><p>Oh god.</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t wait.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat, I\u2019ll come over at eight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll make us dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you, Mia.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. I love you too.\u201d I hate you.</p><p>Oh a sigh, I hang up the phone, shove it back in my pocket and head back upstairs to make a start on the attic.</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d Forbes envelops me in a hug of expensive cologne and rich cotton.</p><p>Forbes is very handsome. Blond hair, six foot, built like a linebacker. He\u2019s the all American boy, and physically, we suit each other. I\u2019m blonde and slim, though Forbes often tells me I\u2019m overweight. And I\u2019m short. Five three to be exact. It puts me a severe disadvantage when things get rough with Forbes. Not that I ever fight back. Fighting back only makes things worse. I learned that lesson a long time ago.</p><p>He leans down and kisses me firmly on the lips. I taste the alcohol on his breath instantly. He\u2019s been drinking.</p><p>My stomach sinks.</p><p>I used to love Forbes kisses in the beginning. Especially the alcohol free ones. I remember how I couldn\u2019t wait to have the feel of his lips on mine. Now, it\u2019s the last thing I want. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Don\u2019t get me wrong; Forbes doesn\u2019t need alcohol to set him off. He just ignites quicker when he\u2019s been on it.</p><p>Forbes follows me into the kitchen, keeping hold of my hand, which is unlike him. He\u2019s not usually tactile in private. Only in public, or when he wants sex.</p><p>I wriggle my fingers free from his to grab the pan handle so I can stir the sauce bubbling on the stove.</p><p>He frowns, then steps away, moving to the fridge.</p> <p>He gets out a beer but doesn\u2019t offer me a drink. Forbes doesn\u2019t think women should drink beer, especially from the bottle. He says it\u2019s unladylike to do so, but I drink it when he\u2019s not around. He thinks I have it in the fridge for him, and I let him believe that.</p><p>He comes over and leans with his back up against the counter beside me. I turn the heat down to let the sauce simmer. I\u2019m making Pasta Norma. Simple but delicious. Our old cook, Mrs. Kennedy, showed me how to make it. She used to teach me how to cook when Oliver wasn\u2019t around. I missed her a lot when she left. Oliver had let her go when he\u2019d overheard her questioning me about the bruises on my arms.</p><p>\u201cI was thinking I should move in here.\u201d Forbes words drop into the air like oil in water.</p><p>My hand freezes around the pan\u2019s handle.</p><p>No. No. No.</p> <p>\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d</p><p>I have to tread carefully here.</p><p>Keeping a neutral face, I turn to him. \u201cI thought you enjoyed living with the guys?\u201d</p><p>Forbes lives in a huge rental house two blocks over from here with four of his frat buddies.</p><p>\u201cI do, but it\u2019s loud. They\u2019re always partying, and I need quiet to work. You know how it is. That\u2019s why you live alone, so you can have peace to study.\u201d</p><p>Actually no. I live alone because I have no girlfriends to room with, and I would never, ever want to live with a man again. Especially not you.</p> <p>Taking the spoon, I start stirring the sauce again.</p><p>Unable to stop my next words, I try to get them out as gently as possible. \u201cDon\u2019t you think it\u2019s a bit soon? I mean, we\u2019ve only been together seven months.\u201d</p><p>The length of pause tells me just the level of anger we\u2019ve reached.</p><p>And it\u2019s not good. Not good at all.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you want to live with me?\u201d His voice doesn\u2019t sound hurt. Just angry.</p><p>Stupid, Mia.</p><p>Stupid. Stupid. Stupid.</p><p>\u201cOf course I do, I\u2019m just thinking of you. I don\u2019t want you to feel tied down too quickly.\u201d I\u2019m speaking quickly, but it\u2019s pointless. I know this.</p> <p>\u201cBullshit.\u201d He shoves the pan back off the heat, and grabs a hand full of my long hair, tangling his fingers into it. He moves behind me and slowly pulls my head back toward him. \u201cWould you feel tied down if I moved in, Mia?\u201d</p><p>\u201cForbes, please,\u201d I say, swallowing hard.</p><p>\u201cAnswer me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, of course I wouldn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs there someone else you want to live with, Mia? Another guy? Are you fucking someone else?\u201d His hand is tightening on my hair, pulling the roots. My eyes water from the pain.</p><p>\u201cNo, of course there isn\u2019t. There\u2019s only you I want to be with. I love you.\u201d</p><p>I hate you.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe you! You\u2019ve been fucking someone else, haven\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>He turns me around and slams me up against the fridge. Pain bites up my back.</p><p>\u201cNo, I haven\u2019t. I swear.\u201d I\u2019m breathless, and my mouth is dry. A tear runs down my cheek because I know what\u2019s coming next, and there\u2019s nothing that I can say or do that will stop it from happening.</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019ve done nothing wrong, then why the fuck are you crying?\u201d His face is in mine. I can tell from his eyes that he\u2019s gone. The nice Forbes that arrived has stayed at the door.</p><p>He yanks me forward, then slams me back hard against the fridge again. My teeth clatter together as my head makes impact.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m c-crying b-because I don\u2019t want you to hurt me.\u201d The words wobble from my trembling lips.</p><p>I don\u2019t want him to hurt me \u2013 that\u2019s what I say. It\u2019s a stupid thing to say because that\u2019s all he ever does, and it\u2019s not about to change because I say the words.</p><p>\u201cC-crying,\u201d he mimics, letting out a sharp laugh.</p><p>Then his face darkens and I know exactly what\u2019s coming next, so I close my eyes and brace myself.</p><p>I feel the familiar hard sting of his hand hitting my face.</p><p>A sharp tang of blood flows into my mouth.</p><p>Happy. Think of happy things, Mia.</p><p>The feel of the sun on my face. The scent of the flowers I keep in my window box. Lowering the roof on my car on a warm day, loving the way the wind feels as it blows through my hair. I\u2019m a bird. A bird flying free in the sky...</p><p>Music. Think of a song, Mia. Sing it in your head while you fly away...</p><p>\u201cBe a shame to waste those tears of yours.\u201d Forbes slaps me across the face again. \u201cKeep crying, Mia. And I\u2019ll keep giving you a reason to cry.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m not crying anymore, but that doesn\u2019t stop him. Nothing ever stops him. Forbes is done when he\u2019s done.</p><p>So I fly away to a safe place. One filled with happiness.</p><p>I come to, unsure of how much time has passed.</p><p>I\u2019m alone on the kitchen floor.</p><p>Picking myself up, I get to my knees. The tiles are hard and unforgiving against my shins. My head is throbbing, and pain is radiating down my side. I hold my hand to my ribs. Not broken, just bruised. I\u2019ve had broken ribs before, so I know how bad they feel. I clutch my hand around my ribs in an attempt to contain the pain as I get to my feet.</p><p>Seeing the heat is still on the stove, I move quietly to turn it off. The click of the knob echoes loud in the silence. I freeze. Making myself invisible is what counts right now. I don\u2019t want to attract Forbes\u2019 attention.</p><p>Turning my head, I see him in the living room, through the crack in the door. He\u2019s sitting on the sofa, beer in his hand, staring down at it.</p><p>I know what will come next. We play this role regularly.</p><p>Moving lightly on my feet, I open the door carefully and slip down the hall, heading straight to the bathroom.</p><p>Closing the door quietly behind me, I pull the first-aid kit from the cabinet, then check my face in the mirror.</p><p>No bruises. Forbes doesn\u2019t usually hit me hard enough in the face to leave a bruise, just like Oliver didn\u2019t.</p><p>People question bruises on the face.</p><p>I check my lip. Spilt on the inside. Caught on my tooth.</p><p>I down a couple of Advil to take the edge off the pain in my ribs, then get some antiseptic cleaner out and work it onto a cotton swab.</p><p>Pulling my lip forward, I dab the antiseptic against the cut.</p><p>\u201cShit,\u201d I whisper.</p><p>A tear of pain leaks from my eye. I rub it away on my forearm.</p><p>When I\u2019m done, I throw the cotton swab away in the trashcan, close up the first aid kit up, and put it away.</p><p>With care, I lift my shirt so I can examine my ribs. My skin is red and swollen. There will be a bruise showing in a few hours. A bad one.</p><p>Movement in the doorway catches my eye.</p><p>Forbes.</p><p>I freeze. My shirt drops from my grip, covering me. Covering what he did to me.</p><p>\u201cI did that to you.\u201d Regret is in his voice. Tears in his eyes.</p><p>I hate you.</p><p>\u201cGod, I\u2019m so sorry, Mia.\u201d He rushes me, grabbing me, pulling me against him.</p><p>He doesn\u2019t care that I wince from the pain in my ribs. All he cares about right now is himself. All he ever cares about is himself. Making Forbes feel better, no matter the cost to me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so, so sorry, Mia. So sorry.\u201d He\u2019s pressing kisses over my face, along with his insufficient words.</p><p>His tears wash against my skin. They make me feel angry. Used. Weak. Consumed.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m okay,\u201d I whisper.</p><p>Scripted. My life is one big goddamn script.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll never happen again. I promise you. I love you so fucking much, Mia. I just get so jealous of the thought of you with another guy, and I\u2019ve been under so much pressure lately, with my dad and...\u201d</p><p>I switch off to his empty excuses and apologies, just ensuring I speak in all the right places.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, Forbes. It\u2019s going to be okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d he breathes. \u201cI can\u2019t lose you. I don\u2019t know what I would do without you.\u201d</p><p>I feel his mood shift, and I know what\u2019s next. It always happens after he beats me.</p><p>His hand moves to my jeans and he starts unzipping them, slipping his hand inside, and into my panties. \u201cI love you so much, Mia. Let me make this better. Please.\u201d</p><p>I close my eyes and nod my assent.</p><p>I don\u2019t fight him on this. I don\u2019t fight him on anything.</p><p>So I close my eyes and let Forbes strip my clothes from me. I let him have sex with me against the wall because it\u2019s all I know.</p><p>And as wrong as this sounds, a part of me craves to feel good. To feel loved. Even if it is fake ... but for this moment, here, listening to Forbes tell me how much he needs me, how there\u2019s no one like me, how he could love no other\u2014I can close my eyes and pretend that it\u2019s real; that I\u2019m being loved in the way I can only dream of.</p><p>When Forbes is done, he carries me through to my bedroom.</p><p>Lifting the cover back, he lays me down and climbs in behind me, pulling me up tight against him. His arms cage me in.</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d he whispers. \u201cI\u2019ll never hurt you again. Never.\u201d</p><p>I close my eyes, and force the words out, \u201cI love you too.\u201d</p><p>After a time, I feel Forbes\u2019 breaths even out, so I slip out from under his grip.</p><p>I walk into the dark kitchen, not bothering to turn the light on, and open the refrigerator door. The light glows through the room. I stare at the contents, pain and self-loathing stabbing like needles in my skin.</p><p>I just want to escape. I want to be free.</p><p>Free again, like I was the day Oliver died.</p><p>I felt like a giant that day. Like I could do or achieve anything.</p><p>But all I\u2019ve managed to do was replace Oliver with Forbes. What does that say about me?</p><p>It says that I\u2019m screwed up. Damaged.</p><p>Things I already know.</p><p>And I can\u2019t get away from Forbes. It\u2019s not like I can just break up with him. Women like me don\u2019t get to break up with men like Forbes.</p><p>I\u2019m only free when he says so.</p><p>And he won\u2019t.</p><p>I know this because I\u2019m ideal for the life he wants.</p><p>I\u2019m pliable. Controllable. Visually, I look the part. I come from money, and I have the right breeding as I overheard his father telling him once. I\u2019m training to be a doctor, a surgeon like Oliver was. It wasn\u2019t my chosen career path, but Oliver told me I was going to be a surgeon, so I\u2019m going to be a surgeon.</p><p>All of these attributes work perfectly for Forbes.</p><p>Men like him choose a woman like an employer chooses candidates for jobs\u2014cold and methodical. Love has nothing to do with it, even though Forbes probably makes himself believe that love is a part of it.</p><p>Then one day, in the not too distant future, I\u2019ll become Mrs. Forbes Chandler. We\u2019ll have kids, and Forbes will continue to beat on me regularly as an outlet for his anger and failings.</p><p>On the outside, we\u2019ll have a perfect marriage. And behind closed doors we\u2019ll be everything that could be wrong with a marriage. Day in and day out I\u2019ll wear the fa\u00e7ade. I\u2019ll be the perfect wife to Forbes just like I was the perfect daughter for Oliver to parade around. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Then degrade and beat senseless the moment the doors to our house slammed shut.</p><p>Forbes has never asked about my past. Never questioned the scars that mar those secret parts of my body.</p><p>I remember being so afraid the first time we made love. Afraid he would ask about them, but he never did. Part of me was relieved but disappointed.</p><p>I encouraged myself to believe that he hadn\u2019t asked because he didn\u2019t want to make me feel uncomfortable, or upset me by highlighting them.</p> <p>Truth is, he didn\u2019t ask because he didn\u2019t care. My scars probably validated that I was exactly the right girl for him.</p><p>Maybe he saw it in me the second our eyes met in that bar that night.</p><p>Like knows like, right?</p><p>Reaching into the fridge, I start pulling out food, setting it on the counter.</p><p>Leaving the door open for light, I turn to the cabinet to get more food. When I\u2019m sure I have enough to see me through, I tear off the foil from yesterday\u2019s saved chicken. And I start eating.</p> <p>I\u2019m sitting on the floor, sweat dampening my skin, my hands sticky from food. My stomach full and aching, my back pressed up against the door. Surrounding me are empty food containers and wrappers.</p><p>Knowing I can\u2019t sit here all night, I get to my feet. My stomach aches under the pressure of gravity.</p><p>I\u2019m uncomfortable. I feel sick.</p><p>I relish the feeling.</p><p>I tidy the mess. Containers in the dishwasher. Wrappers pushed to the bottom of the trash can, so Forbes won\u2019t see them. Not that he\u2019d question it, but better to be safe. I try never to leave a reason to set his anger off.</p><p>I wash my hands clean. Then go to the bathroom and lock the door.</p> <p>I leave the light off. I don\u2019t want to risk catching a glimpse of myself in the mirror in this moment.</p><p>Kneeling before the toilet, I lift the seat.</p><p>Fingers poised by my lips, I push back, and make all the hurt go away.</p><p>Chapter Two</p><p>Mia</p><p>I\u2019m back at Oliver\u2019s house to finish packing. My last day here. After today, I will never again have to come to this house.</p><p>The knowledge is like clean air in my lungs.</p><p>All that\u2019s left to empty is his office.</p> <p>I left this room until last because I despise this room.</p><p>Oliver always beat me in his office, as though he thought that if he kept it to one room, he could leave this room and lock the door on it when he was done.</p><p>That\u2019s never been the case for me, but being in here does bring things back full throttle.</p><p>Bad memories start to scream out in the silence.</p><p>I sit down on the floor and get my iPhone out. Setting the music to play, I place it up on Oliver\u2019s desk.</p><p>He loved this desk. It belonged to his grandfather.</p><p>I should burn it. Just like I should have burned Oliver\u2019s body. Cremated him to dust. Make sure he was gone for good.</p><p>Unfortunately for me, Oliver had it set in his will that he was to be buried.</p><p>He\u2019d already purchased a plot. I also discovered he had bought one for me too.</p><p>The plot next to his.</p><p>I\u2019d rather burn in Hell than spend an eternity trapped beside him. I\u2019ve served my time. I\u2019m done.</p><p>Reaching for the last flat pack box, I stretch too far, and my ribs ache. I\u2019m sporting a nice black bruise on them courtesy of Forbes outburst last night.</p><p>I check my bag for Advil and remember that I took the last of them first thing this morning.</p><p>Knowing everything is packed, I start to search through Oliver\u2019s drawers in the hope there may be something in here.</p><p>I tug on the bottom drawer, but it\u2019s locked.</p><p>I search the other drawers for a key but find nothing.</p><p>Then a thought crosses my mind. Oliver\u2019s keys, the ones I was given with his things at the hospital, have a few keys on it that I hadn\u2019t found a use for.</p><p>I retrieve the keys from my bag, and start trying the three keys. The second one fits, so I turn it, and the lock opens with a click. I pull the draw open, and there\u2019s nothing in it, but a manila folder. I take the folder from the drawer and sit down in the chair, placing the folder on the desk.</p><p>In the top right hand corner, it has one word \u2013 Anna.</p><p>Seeing my mother\u2019s name on it has me opening the folder.</p><p>There are two pieces of paper inside. Both are titled: \u2018Sawyer, Davis and Smith. Family Lawyers.\u2019 Dated: October 12th 1990.</p><p>I was born 1990. January 10th is my birthday.</p><p>The first letter is addressed to Oliver. I start to read.</p><p>No.</p><p>This ... this can\u2019t be right.</p><p>Blood starts to pound in my ears.</p><p>With trembling fingers, I turn to the second piece of paper and read quickly through the lawyer jargon. I\u2019m getting the basics of what this letter is about.</p><p>It\u2019s not a letter. It\u2019s a contract.</p><p>I, Anna Monroe, do decree to cease all parental rights of my daughter, Mia Monroe, giving sole custody to her father, Dr. Oliver Monroe.</p><p>I don\u2019t read anymore. I don\u2019t need to.</p><p>My mother didn\u2019t die in a car accident. She signed me over to Oliver.</p><p>She left me with him. She gave me to him.</p><p>Everything starts to fracture around me.</p><p>My eyes blur, and my heart starts to hurt in chest.</p><p>The letters flutter from my hands, dropping to the desk. I grab the folder, searching it, scrambling to find anything else.</p><p>I find one scrap piece of paper at the bottom.</p><p>It has my mother\u2019s name on it, and an address for a place called Durango in Colorado.</p><p>Grabbing the papers and address, I shove them in my bag.</p><p>I need to get out of here. I need to talk to someone.</p><p>So I head to the only person I have in this world \u2013 Forbes.</p><p>When I reach his house, I don\u2019t bother knocking as I know it\u2019ll be unlocked. There\u2019s always someone here.</p><p>The urge to talk to him about what I\u2019ve discovered has increased on the drive over here. I just need to air this out. Figure it out. He\u2019ll be able to help me do that. Yes, Forbes is an asshole, but he\u2019s smart. He\u2019s almost a lawyer.</p><p>He\u2019ll know what these papers mean.</p><p>He\u2019ll know what to do.</p><p>As I walk through the foyer, I see the living room is deserted.</p><p>If he\u2019s not in, I\u2019ll just wait in his room until he gets home.</p><p>I run up the stairs to the first floor. Forbes\u2019 room is at the far end of the hall. I walk quickly, clutching my bag to my side. The papers inside feel as if they\u2019re burning through the leather and onto my skin.</p><p>Reaching Forbes\u2019 door, I grab the handle and push down, opening it.</p><p>And I\u2019m greeted by the sight of Forbes in bed, having sex with a girl \u2013 who isn\u2019t me, obviously.</p><p>I can\u2019t really say what I feel in this moment. There\u2019s such a myriad of emotions streaming through me, but I do know the one emotion I feel with absolute certainty is relief. In what context I\u2019m just not sure.</p><p>Funny.</p><p>Oliver dies, I feel relief.</p><p>Forbes cheats, I feel relief.</p><p>Not really the natural feeling one should have in these kind of situations.</p><p>Does this mean I\u2019m free of Forbes?</p><p>The words are right there on the tip of my tongue. Of all the things I could say to him at this moment in time, that is the one thing I want to ask most.</p><p>It takes Forbes a moment to see me standing here in his doorway as he\u2019s too busy getting his rocks off. The surprise is evident on his face, but it quickly morphs into the cold, blank expression I\u2019m familiar with.</p><p>The girl is facing away from me. All I can see is a mass of brown hair curtaining her face as she is on her hands and knees being screwed from behind by my boyfriend.</p><p>She has no clue I\u2019m here, watching, feeling utterly emotionless by the whole thing</p><p>And Forbes says nothing. Just holds my eye as he continues to have sex with her.</p><p>\u201cYes, God! Forbes!\u201d she screams out, making me jump. Forbes actually smiles.</p><p>\u201cHarder! Fuck me harder!\u201d</p><p>She really does seem to be enjoying herself. More than I ever have with him. Maybe that\u2019s why he hits me. Maybe I don\u2019t do sex right. He was my first. Has been my only.</p><p>\u201cYes! Right there!\u201d she continues to scream.</p><p>You\u2019d think he\u2019d stop and try some lame attempt of It\u2019s not what you think, Mia.</p><p>But he doesn\u2019t say a thing.</p><p>Then again, you\u2019d think I\u2019d say something; any normal girl would if she caught her boyfriend cheating on her. She\u2019d probably be the one screaming right now.</p><p>But then Forbes and I don\u2019t exactly do normal.</p><p>He has all the power, and I\u2019m just dragged along for the ride.</p><p>Continuing to have sex with this girl, and keeping his eyes on me, his smile changes to a smirk. Then a fire ignites in his eyes. It\u2019s new. I\u2019ve never seen this look on him before, but then I\u2019ve never seen him having sex with someone else before either.</p><p>But there\u2019s something in the way he\u2019s looking at me right now that terrifies me. He looks empowered, like he\u2019s finally got me exactly where he wants me.</p><p>Chills creep down my spine like spiders.</p><p>\u201cOh god, I\u2019m coming! I\u2019m coming!\u201d the girl screams, totally unaware of what is transpiring right now between Forbes and I.</p><p>Leave Mia, now. Go!</p><p>Tearing my gaze from his. I take one step back. Two. And then I\u2019m gone, fleeing down the stairs and out of there.</p><p>I toss my bag into the foot-well and I\u2019m back in my car, driving away.</p><p>Vision blurred, I wipe my eyes and realize that I\u2019m crying.</p><p>Why? I\u2019m not entirely sure.</p><p>I drive to a convenience store, park my car way in the back, go in and buy as much food as I can carry in my arms. Potato chips, candy, cookies, ice-cream \u2013 anything I can lay my hands on.</p><p>I get back in my car, open up the food and start eating like I always do. Eating is probably too nice a word for what I\u2019m doing \u2013 I\u2019m gorging.</p><p>When I\u2019m done, the feeling of my stomach tight and bursting, relief momentarily fills me. Then I look around at the empty wrappers and containers and the sick, dirty, guilt feeling washes over me.</p><p>I stuff the wrappers in the bag and look around at the lot. There\u2019s no one around, so I walk toward the trash can and dump the bag in it. Then I skirt quickly to the cluster of trees by the edge of the store and hide myself from view as I brace my hand against one of them. I push my fingers down my throat, emptying my stomach.</p><p>I get back in my car, clean my hands on a wipe, and put a breath mint in my mouth.</p><p>Finally feeling in control of my emotions, I start my car and head for home.</p><p>I don\u2019t know Forbes is there waiting as his car isn\u2019t parked up front\u2014maybe that was the point; he always likes to have the upper hand. When I see him under the alcove by my door, I try to run, but he grabs my arm, dragging me back. \u201cOh no, you don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>I can smell perfume on him.</p><p>And sex.</p><p>The sex I just saw him having.</p><p>He didn\u2019t even shower.</p><p>Just finished screwing his bit on the side and came over here. Or maybe I\u2019m his bit on the side. Maybe she\u2019s his girlfriend.</p><p>Forbes yanks my keys from my hand and unlocks the door. He pushes me into my apartment.</p><p>I stumble, but quickly correct my footing. For some reason, in this moment, it\u2019s important to me that I don\u2019t fall in front of him.</p><p>Moving back, I press up against the back of the sofa and grip the top of it with my hands.</p><p>I\u2019m not really sure what I expect of him in this moment, but I need to prepare myself for the worst. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He places my keys on the table by the door and leans back against it, folding his arms across his chest. I watch his muscles flex. In the beginning of our relationship, I used to love how strong his arms looked. How safe they made me feel.</p><p>Now all I see is the power behind the pain. The fear they make me feel. The same fear that I grew up feeling because of a man exactly like him.</p><p>I don\u2019t want this anymore. I don\u2019t want to feel this way.</p><p>Not now.</p> <p>Not ever again.</p><p>It\u2019s like clarity. Like my light has finally come on.</p><p>Why now? I\u2019m not sure. But it has, and it\u2019s like a weight off my shoulders. I\u2019m never going back to how my life was. Whatever it takes, it stops now.</p><p>That knowledge pushes my backbone up. I stand a little straighter.</p><p>Forbes\u2019 eyes are trained on me.</p> <p>\u201cIs she your girlfriend?\u201d I ask, making sure to keep my voice clear and steady, even though my heart is beating so hard in my chest it\u2019s almost painful.</p><p>He looks surprised. Of all the things I could have said, I don\u2019t think he was expecting that. I wonder what he was expecting me to say.</p><p>\u201cNo. That privilege is all yours,\u201d he replies through tight lips.</p><p>\u201cDo you fuck her often?\u201d</p><p>His eyes narrow. \u201cWatch your mouth, Mia.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry.\u201d I smile, sweetly ... antagonistically. \u201cDo you have sex regularly with her?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, she\u2019s new.\u201d</p><p>New?</p><p>\u201cThere have been others?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d He smirks. It hurts more than I was expecting.</p><p>Tears squeeze at my eyes. Not because of his betrayal, or the beatings, but because I\u2019m angry with myself. Angry for being so goddamn weak.</p><p>\u201cHave you used condoms with them?\u201d He doesn\u2019t with me.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Thank god. I\u2019m still going to get tested.</p> <p>I can see the anger increasing in him. It tells in the dark of his eyes. The taunt skin across his cheekbones. The clenching of his fists by his sides.</p><p>My questioning is annoying him.</p><p>He actually has the audacity to be annoyed in this situation. But then, can I really expect any more from him?</p><p>Normally, when Forbes is this way, I will do anything to appease him. Anything to calm him. But right now my sole aim is to anger him more.</p><p>I don\u2019t know why, or what I want out of this apart from him gone from my life for good, but I will do whatever it takes now to make that happen.</p><p>I tilt my head to the side, appraising him as I ask this question. I\u2019m genuinely interested to know the answer because honestly, it doesn\u2019t make sense to me.</p><p>\u201cForbes, you wanted to move in here with me. Wouldn\u2019t that have slightly hampered your ability to have sex with other women?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He\u2019s smug in his statement. And it makes me feel less than worthless. He folds his arms across his chest. \u201cIt\u2019s just simply time for us to move onto the next stage in our relationship. But my extra-circular activities will remain the same.\u201d</p><p>God, I knew he was a cold-hearted bastard, but now I\u2019m seeing a whole brand new bastard. I guess there are more sides to Forbes Chandler than I had realized.</p><p>I wrap my arms around myself. I need to feel some form of warmth. \u201cSo you have these girls and me. Why?\u201d</p><p>He smirks. \u201cBecause I can. And there is no separate now, Mia. You will be a part of it too.\u201d</p><p>My expression drops. \u201cWhat?\u201d The words wobble from my lips.</p><p>I\u2019m pretty sure I know what he\u2019s getting at\u2014not that I know much about sex, but I\u2019m not dumb. I just don\u2019t want to believe it. He\u2019s never shown any interest in anything like that before. We\u2019ve always had straight forward vanilla sex. He\u2019s never even taken me from behind like he did that girl.</p><p>\u201cYou. Will. Be. A. Part. Of. It.\u201d He addresses me as though speaking to a child. \u201cYou\u2019ll let me fuck them here in our apartment whenever I want. You\u2019ll sit out here and listen to me fuck them. And sometimes...\u201d He steps closer. \u201cYou\u2019ll participate.\u201d</p><p>No. No. No. No!</p><p>Hell no!</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d Is that me speaking?</p><p>His features tighten. He takes a step forward. I can see his hands twitching by his sides.</p><p>I sidestep around the sofa.</p><p>\u201cYou will do as I tell you, Mia. You\u2019re mine to do with as I want.\u201d</p><p>The belt cracked across my behind.</p><p>\u201cWho is in control here, Mia?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are, Daddy.\u201d</p><p>I lift my eyes to his face. Forbes might be handsome, but he\u2019s never looked uglier than he does right now.</p><p>\u201cDo you hit those girls like you do me?\u201d</p><p>I see surprise flicker across his face.</p><p>Even though we are both very clear on the fact that Forbes hits me ... I\u2019ve never actually said the words out loud before. They feel odd to have said, but also empowering.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he answers, his voice cold.</p><p>And the empowerment I held so briefly dissipates and I want to cry. The ugly type of cry.</p><p>He beats me because he can.</p><p>Because I allow it.</p><p>Because I\u2019m weak.</p><p>\u201cWhy me?\u201d I ask. I know why, but the sadistic part of me wants to hear him confirm it.</p><p>He moves closer until he is right in front of me.</p><p>I don\u2019t move this time. I stand my ground, even though my legs are shaking to the point that I\u2019m surprised I\u2019m actually still standing.</p><p>If my act of strength surprises him, he doesn\u2019t let it show. He leans down, getting in my face. His hot breath burns my skin. I can still smell that girl on him.</p><p>I want to vomit.</p><p>\u201cBecause you\u2019re mine, Mia.\u201d His voice sounds like a hiss. \u201cYou belong to me. You\u2019re my other half. My little ... easily controllable ... fucked-up other half.\u201d</p><p>I might have known this already, but that doesn\u2019t stop it from hurting. I hide the burning flinch of pain I feel because I don\u2019t want him to have the pleasure of knowing.</p><p>He lifts his hand.</p><p>I flinch.</p><p>This pleases him.</p><p>Touching my cheek with the barest of touches, he runs his fingers across my skin and tucks my long hair behind my ear.</p><p>\u201cYou really are beautiful,\u201d he murmurs, brushing his fingers through my hair and down my back. Then he roughly grabs a hand full of my hair, yanking my head back. My eyes water from the pain.</p><p>\u201cYou and I are the same, you know.\u201d His voice is low and vengeful. \u201cPretty on the outside, but all kinds of fucked up on the inside. I wanted you, Mia, for the same reason you wanted me. Because like knows like. The abused becomes the abuser. Or, in your case, the abused just stays abused.\u201d</p><p>A veil lifts from my eyes. How did I not see it before?</p><p>Stereotypical pattern.</p><p>Forbes has lived my childhood. To what degree, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever know. But he\u2019s lived through the pain.</p><p>Did his father beat him too?</p><p>I suddenly feel awash with sadness for him. An ache for the child he was. For the childhood that was stolen from him as mine was.</p><p>Then I look up at the man before me, and that sorrow instantly turns to rage. White hot rage.</p><p>He knows how it feels, yet he does it to me.</p><p>He could have stopped the cycle. Just loved me. I would have loved him back without question. I would have given him all of me. My heart. Together, we could have healed each other.</p><p>But instead, all he gave me was a co-dependent, hate fueled, abusive relationship.</p><p>And now I\u2019m just left with an empty chasm, lined with that hatred, and bitter resentment.</p><p>I open my mouth to tell him this ... then it hits me.</p><p>I could have walked away ... maybe not walked, but run. I should have run.</p><p>The simple truth is that I took the only way I knew ... I carried on being the old me. The one who Oliver created, instead of trying to find a new Mia. The real Mia.</p><p>Because I was afraid to try.</p><p>Anger for my own failings burst in my chest ... swelling ... compressing me from the inside out. I feel as if I\u2019m going to explode under the pressure.</p><p>I somehow manage to find my voice. \u201cI want you to leave.\u201d</p><p>Cruel laughter bursts from him. \u201cYou breaking up with me, Mia?\u201d</p><p>It takes everything in me, but I force myself to meet his eyes. \u201cI\u2019d say I\u2019ve got good reason to, wouldn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>He grabs my face, pinching my cheeks hard, then shoves my head back. He wraps his hand around my upper arm, yanking me straight back to him. I collide hard with his chest.</p><p>\u201cSo, let me get this straight \u2013 I get to smack you around whenever I feel like it, but the moment you catch me with my dick in some cheap slut, you\u2019re apparently done?\u201d</p><p>I wince from the pressure of his fingers digging into my arm, but I speak through the pain. \u201cIt\u2019s got nothing to do with you having sex with that girl. This is me finally waking up. Something I should have done a long time ago. I won\u2019t continue to be your punching bag, Forbes. And I definitely won\u2019t become your whore.\u201d</p><p>He laughs in my face. His voice chilly, he says, \u201cYou\u2019ve been my whore from the moment I met you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happens when you dress like a whore, Mia?\u201d</p><p>I bit my lip through the lashing, unable to speak through the pain.</p><p>\u201cAnswer me!\u201d</p><p>My body jumps from the force of his voice. Sweat trickled down the side of my face, like the tears I wanted to shed. \u201cI-I get treated like o-one, D-Daddy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly right. You\u2019re finally starting to learn.\u201d</p><p>Something in me snaps.</p><p>I stare hard into Forbes\u2019 eyes. \u201cI\u2019m no one\u2019s whore! Now get the hell out of my apartment! I\u2019m done with you!\u201d</p><p>Rage engorges his features, making him barely recognizable. In all this time, I\u2019ve never seen him this angry, this far gone.</p><p>I should be terrified. I\u2019m not.</p><p>\u201cDone with me?\u201d he spits in my face. \u201cYou think it\u2019s that fuckin\u2019 easy? I\u2019m going nowhere! And neither are you!\u201d</p><p>He slams his lips against mine at the same time as he restrains my hands by my sides. The next thing I know, my back is pressed against the wall, his body hard on mine, caging me in.</p><p>I\u2019m trapped.</p><p>I feel his quick erection dig in my hip, and my senses instantly tell me where this is going.</p><p>My heart plummets.</p><p>Oh god, no. Not this. Anything but this.</p><p>I\u2019ve been degraded, humiliated and beaten. But never raped.</p><p>He\u2019s not taking this from me. I have to fight back.</p><p>The laughable thing is, I don\u2019t know how to fight back.</p><p>Fear is bubbling my blood, adrenaline spiking my senses, so I do the only thing I can think of. I bite down on his lip until I taste blood.</p><p>\u201cYou fuckin\u2019 bitch!\u201d</p><p>He slaps me hard. I expect it, but not the punch that follows.</p><p>My head ricochets off the wall. Pain explodes everywhere. Light swims my vision.</p><p>Forbes grabs me and lifts me off my feet, then slams me up against the wall. I cry out from the pain it sends hurtling through my already bruised ribs.</p><p>Shoving my skirt up, his hand goes down my panties while his other pins my throat, squeezing hard.</p><p>Fingers press painfully into my flesh. One violating me. The other stealing my breath. Yet all I can think is: Why did I wear a skirt this morning? Why didn\u2019t I pick pants? If I\u2019d picked pants, it would have made this harder for him. Maybe gave me an out. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Something so small can define how a situation goes.</p><p>I will probably never again wear a skirt.</p><p>Something small. Insignificant.</p><p>But it matters to me.</p> <p>I can feel myself shutting down. I close my eyes tight.</p><p>Warmth. Music. Flying free in the blue sky...</p><p>Safe. I\u2019m safe.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to fuck some sense into you,\u201d he hisses in my ear. \u201cYou need teaching a lesson.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome to my office, Mia. It\u2019s time for a lesson.\u201d</p> <p>Forbes\u2019 fingers roughly and painfully pull out of me, dragging me back to the now.</p><p>For a spilt stupid second, I think he\u2019s changed his mind\u2014that maybe he isn\u2019t going to do this.</p><p>Then he reaches for the zipper on his jeans.</p><p>In this moment, it\u2019s difficult to say what I feel. Realization, mainly. This is really going to happen to me. He\u2019s going to take from me the last shred of dignity I have.</p><p>Only if I let it happen.</p><p>Stop this, Mia! Stop being weak and fight back! You stop this, and there will be no more pain. No more hurt. Ever.</p> <p>Forbes is struggling with his zipper. He moves off me, just a fraction, but I take full advantage of that fraction. Using courage I didn\u2019t know I had until now, I bring my knee up as hard as I can and slam it into his balls.</p><p>A sound like garbled agony emits from him.</p><p>His hand drops from my throat, releasing me as both his hands go to his crotch, holding the pain I just created.</p><p>Now you know how it feels you bastard.</p><p>I slide down the wall, gasping for the air I so desperately need.</p><p>Forbes staggers a little to the side, face lined with pain, then he drops to his knees.</p><p>Now, Mia, go!</p><p>I\u2019m moving. Running through my apartment. I grab my keys off the table, and I\u2019m out the door, flying down the stairs.</p> <p>I don\u2019t stop to look behind.</p><p>The street is quiet. No one around. I unlock my car in the race toward it. Slamming the door shut, my hand shakes as I try to get the key in the ignition.</p><p>Shit! I can\u2019t get it in.</p><p>Out of the corner of my eye, I see Forbes come stumbling out of the building, hand still holding his crotch, and I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s sheer luck driving this moment, but the key suddenly punches in.</p><p>I turn the ignition, shift into gear, and slam my foot down, getting me out of there.</p><p>Reaching the end of the street in a matter of seconds, I turn left and race off down the street. I feel wet on my hand as I push my hair off my face. Pulling it back, I find it smeared with blood.</p><p>I take a quick glance in the rear-view mirror.</p><p>My eyebrow is split open and the blood from the wound is running down my face, dripping onto my clothes.</p><p>\u201cShit,\u201d I wince, instantly feeling the pain from the knowledge.</p><p>I need to clean it up, but I can\u2019t stop. Not now. I can\u2019t risk Forbes catching up with me.</p><p>Because he will, undoubtedly, be coming after me.</p><p>I press my sleeve against the cut to soak up the blood and press down harder on the gas, firing me onward.</p><p>Before I know it, I\u2019m on the I-90 with absolutely no idea where I\u2019m going.</p><p>I have nowhere to go.</p><p>No friends to turn to. No family.</p><p>There\u2019s only me.</p><p>I drive down the I-90 for an undetermined amount of time. I\u2019m just staring ahead, foot on the gas pedal, putting as much distance between me and Forbes as I can.</p><p>It starts to rain, so visibility becomes poor, and my eye is starting to shut. It isn\u2019t easy driving as I am, but with the rain pouring down, I\u2019m going to have to pull off.</p><p>The thought of stopping terrifies me, but at the moment, I don\u2019t have a choice.</p><p>A few minutes later, I see a sign for a service station coming up in a mile.</p><p>When the turn comes up, I pull off and follow the road round.</p><p>I park my car into the lot just outside the service motel. Shutting the engine off, I check my doors are still locked, then I examine my eye in the rear-view mirror. It\u2019s looking bad.</p><p>I reach into the glove compartment and get out the hand wipes I keep in there. That\u2019s when I spot my handbag sitting in the foot well where I\u2019d dropped it earlier. Relief fills me.</p><p>I\u2019ve got money.</p><p>There\u2019s no way I can go back to my apartment. When Forbes gets bored of looking for me, that\u2019s the first place he\u2019ll go to wait. Looks like this motel is going to be my bed for the night.</p><p>I lift my bag onto the passenger seat. The papers about my mother are still there. I gently touch them with my fingertips.</p><p>My cell starts to ring, making me jump.</p><p>Forbes.</p><p>With trembling fingers, I cancel the call and switch my cell off.</p><p>I clean my face using the hand wipes. On closer examination, I see the cut is really deep. I\u2019ll need to tape it. What it really needs is stitches, but I\u2019m not up for stitching myself at the moment, and going to the ER is out of the question.</p><p>I can live with the scar. It\u2019s not my first.</p><p>There should be some tape in the first-aid kit in the trunk of the car. Always prepared. That\u2019s me. I could do with an icepack. I\u2019ll see what the motel has.</p><p>I grab my overly large sunglasses from my bag and put them on to cover my eye. I don\u2019t care that it\u2019s raining. I hang my bag on my shoulder, open the door and step into the bouncing rain.</p><p>Popping the trunk, I get the first-aid kit and shove it in my bag before I head to the reception of the motel.</p><p>The female, a middle-aged clerk barely looks at me as she checks me in, which is good because I must look a complete state wearing sunglasses, soaked through to my panties and blood on my clothes.</p><p>She hands me over a key card with barely a word, so I thank her and head straight to the room. Stopping on the way, I grab a can of soda from the machine. It\u2019ll work as a makeshift icepack.</p><p>I open the door, and I\u2019m greeted with the stench of stale air freshener. Walking into the room, I shut the door behind me, locking it. I remove my sunglasses and put them in my bag, which I drop on the bed as I sit down. The mattress is hard and uncomfortable. I rest the cold can of soda against my eye using one hand. With the other, I curl my fingers around the edge of the bed and grip the comforter.</p><p>Then I just let go. I cry the tears I\u2019ve needed to cry all night.</p><p>I\u2019ve no clue how long I sit here for, crying, but when I\u2019m finally dried eyed, I go to the bathroom and strip my clothes off.</p><p>The urge to eat and purge is overwhelming right now, but fear of going back outside keeps me in the room.</p><p>Fear is driving my every decision right now.</p><p>I wash my blood stained shirt in the sink and hang it to drip dry over the towel rail. I turn the shower on hot and climb underneath. I just need to get the stench and feel of Forbes off me, then I\u2019ll be okay.</p><p>I\u2019ll be okay.</p><p>Tears sting my eyes at the reminder of what just happened to me. A lump lodges in my throat, sticking there like dry wood. I suck in a deep breath to stop the tears from starting again as I pick up the hotel soap to wash myself with. When I feel as near to clean as I\u2019m going to, I grab a towel and wrap my hair up. Then my body. I hate that I can\u2019t brush my teeth. I\u2019ll have to buy a toothbrush and paste in the morning.</p><p>I go back into the room and get the first-aid kit from my bag.</p><p>I clean the cut using an antiseptic wipe, then tape it up. I take a couple of Advil from the kit and swallow them down.</p><p>I really don\u2019t want to put the clothes I was wearing back on, but they\u2019re all I have to wear. I leave my panties off and just put my bra back on, wrapping the towel around my waist.</p><p>Climbing back onto the bed, I tuck my legs underneath me as I stare down at my bag.</p><p>The \u2018Giveaway Mia\u2019 contract and my mother\u2019s address are still in there.</p><p>I can\u2019t believe that she\u2019s alive. More so, that she signed me away. Just like that. With the press of a pen to paper, she was no longer my mother.</p><p>How does that even work?</p><p>The mix of emotions I feel is confusing. I\u2019m angry. No, I\u2019m raging. She has been out there all this time while I had to endure growing up with Oliver.</p><p>She abandoned me.</p><p>She left me with him.</p><p>Did she know the kind of man he really was? The person she was actually leaving her child with? Did she willingly just walk away leaving me there with that monster of a man?</p><p>I have to believe she didn\u2019t know because the thought that she did is just too painful to consider.</p><p>I can\u2019t think about it now. I don\u2019t want to think about it.</p><p>Too much has happened to me today. I can barely process it.</p><p>I need to sleep.</p><p>Pressing all thoughts from my mind, I straighten a leg out, and using my toes, I push my bag off the edge of the bed. I switch the light off and climb under the covers.</p><p>Closing my eyes, I listen to the sound of the distant traffic on the interstate, trying to focus on that.</p><p>I wonder if Forbes is looking for me. What if he finds me here?</p><p>On that thought, I get out of bed, grab the heavy chair from the desk, and drag it over to the door, propping it up underneath the door handle. I should have hidden my car behind the motel instead of leaving it upfront, but I\u2019m not going out there now to move it.</p><p>Then again, I\u2019m too far out of Boston. Forbes won\u2019t think I\u2019ll have gone this far. I never leave Boston.</p><p>The thought makes me sad.</p><p>I\u2019ve never left Boston. Not once.</p><p>The life I had existed within the city limits. While my mother lived a whole other life, without me.</p><p>Climbing back into bed, I turn the TV on using the remote control and focus on the screen instead of focusing on what is going on in my own mind.</p><p>Inside my head is not a place I want to be right now.</p><p>Chapter Three</p><p>Mia</p><p>I wake feeling disorientated. My head is throbbing, and I can hear a television on.</p><p>I realize I\u2019m in the motel room I slept in last night.</p><p>Yesterday\u2019s events come flooding back. Forbes tried to rape me. He sexually assaulted me. My mother \u2013 she\u2019s alive. She signed me away. She left me with Oliver.</p><p>My heart and stomach start to ache, painfully.</p><p>Then I make the mistake of rubbing my eyes. \u201cShit!\u201d</p><p>I press my head back into the pillow and ride out the wave of pain, and grief until it all settles into a dull ache in my chest.</p><p>I don\u2019t move again until my bursting bladder forces me out of bed. When I\u2019m done using the bathroom, I check my eye in the mirror.</p><p>Jesus, it\u2019s bad. Swollen and black and my eye is bloodshot to hell. No amount of cover-up will conceal this.</p><p>Guess I\u2019ll be wearing my sunglasses for the next week.</p><p>I drop a couple of Advil to take the edge off the pain, and go back to bed. Resting my back against the headboard, I start channel hopping. I\u2019m trying to focus on the television, and ignore the noise and questions in my mind, but it\u2019s not working.</p><p>I know I need to decide what the hell I\u2019m going to do. I can\u2019t just stay here in a motel room, off the I-90, in god knows where. But I can\u2019t go back to my apartment either. Or Boston for that matter. Forbes will be waiting for me.</p><p>So what do I do?</p><p>I could go to Colorado and find my mother.</p><p>No way. She abandoned me. She left me with Oliver.</p><p>But you don\u2019t know her reasons. You know what Oliver was like. How terrifying he was. What if she had no choice but to leave?</p><p>I bang my head back against the headboard. \u201cGoddammit! No!\u201d I mutter into the silence. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>This goes on for a while. But no matter which way I argue it in my head, I won\u2019t rest or be able to move forward until I know why she left me. It will eat away at me.</p><p>Maybe finding my mother will finally help me figure out who I am. Give me closure or something. And I have the free time. School is out for summer break. The time could help me figure out what to do with my life, and finding her might help me find myself.</p><p>Since Oliver died, I\u2019ve just carried on with the life he set for me. This is my chance to break free and change things.</p><p>I don\u2019t even have to go back to Boston if I don\u2019t want to. Yes, I have my apartment there, but that\u2019s not going anywhere, and I could eventually sell it\u2014shit! Goodwill is coming today to collect Oliver\u2019s things.</p> <p>I dive for my bag and get my cell. I turn it on and ignore the notifications of texts and voicemails from Forbes. I place a call to the lawyer who is handling the house sale.</p><p>Voicemail. Too early for anyone to be in the office. I leave a message, explaining that I\u2019ve had to leave town for a few days, and asking if they can arrange for someone to be there to let Goodwill in the house.</p><p>I hang up and turn my cell off. The last thing I want to do is hear any of Forbes\u2019 cruel words.</p><p>With a plan in hand, I dress quickly, cringing that I have to wear yesterday\u2019s things. I need to make a stop and get some new clothes and underwear.</p><p>I tie my hair into a ponytail, put my sunglasses on, and check out of the motel.</p> <p>In my car, I tap \u2018Durango, Colorado\u2019 into the GPS.</p><p>Wow. Okay, so this going to be one hell of a long drive.</p><p>I consider for a moment flying to Colorado, but then I decide I want to leave no trace for Forbes to follow. Not that I think airports give out that type of information, but Forbes can be very persuasive when he wants to be, and I just don\u2019t want to risk leaving him a way to find me.</p><p>I know he\u2019ll look for me.</p><p>Forbes is not the kind of guy who gives up easily on what he thinks belongs to him. And he definitely believes that I am his.</p><p>I get back on the road and drive for a few hours before I need to stop for gas. While in the station, I ask the attendant if there are any malls nearby. No malls, but he tells me there is a Walmart a few miles away.</p> <p>Perfect.</p><p>I follow his directions to Walmart. I stock up on jeans, t-shirts, tank tops, pajamas, underwear, toiletries and more Advil. I also grab a pair of ballet flats. And a gym bag to keep all my new things in.</p><p>Heading for the checkout, I pay for my items, making small talk with the cashier.</p><p>I\u2019ve just left the store, bags in hand, when I realize I haven\u2019t gotten a hairdryer. My hair is a nightmare\u2014thick and holds water like a sponge. It was still damp this morning from washing it last night.</p><p>I\u2019m just about to head back inside, when the hair salon next door catches my eye. Before I even have a chance to think, I\u2019m walking toward it, then I\u2019m seated before a mirror as a woman called Shirley asks what I want to do with my hair today.</p><p>I blink. \u201cOh, uh...\u201d</p><p>My eyes drift around at the many pictures of hair models on the wall. Then I realize what I want. I want to look different.</p><p>\u201cI want you to cut it all off.\u201d</p> <p>Did I just say that?</p><p>\u201cAll?\u201d She looks at me as though I\u2019ve lost my mind. I probably have.</p><p>I have great hair. It\u2019s blonde, very thick and very long, but now I just want it gone. I want to look different. I want to start my new future, with a new me.</p><p>\u201cYes. I want that style.\u201d I point at a picture of a woman with short hair. It\u2019s a pixie style.</p><p>She looks so pretty...</p><p>So happy...</p><p>I want to look like that.</p><p>Shirley tilts her head to the side, assessing me in the mirror. \u201cWell, you definitely have the bone structure to carry it off.\u201d She smiles. \u201cRight, let\u2019s get your hair washed. Give you time to change your mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to change my mind.\u201d</p><p>I sit down at the basin and lie my head back into the sink.</p><p>\u201cYou okay to remove the sunglasses, sweetie?\u201d Shirley asks.</p><p>I freeze.</p><p>It takes me a moment to gather the courage to reach my hand up and slowly slide them off.</p><p>I hear her gasp of breath, and I\u2019m thankful that I can\u2019t see the expression on her face.</p><p>\u201cSit forward, sweetie. I forgot to put a towel around your shoulders.\u201d</p><p>I do as she asks.</p><p>Shirley slips a towel around my shoulders, then I feel her hand gently squeeze my shoulder.</p><p>It feels like support. Solidarity.</p><p>It brings a lump to my throat.</p><p>Maybe she knows what it\u2019s like to get a black eye. It\u2019s not the pain on the outside that does the damage; it\u2019s the effect that bruise has on the inside that does the worst kind of damage.</p><p>The black eye heals. The pain never does.</p><p>\u201cRight, lay yourself back,\u201d Shirley says. \u201cLet\u2019s make a new woman of you.\u201d</p><p>An hour later and I\u2019m back in my car. My purchases on the backseat. The new me in the front.</p><p>I tilt the mirror to look at my new hairstyle. My bangs sweep across, hanging in my eyes a little, and it\u2019s just long enough to tuck behind my ear, but it is short.</p><p>I look completely different, just like I wanted.</p><p>Suddenly, laughter bubbles up and out of me. I\u2019m laughing, and I have no clue why, then without warning I burst into tears.</p><p>I\u2019m laughing and crying. What the hell is wrong with me?</p><p>Maybe I\u2019m having some kind of breakdown.</p><p>A woman walks past my car, giving me an odd look, and I realize I must look like a crazy person, sitting here laughing my head off with tears streaming down my face.</p><p>I dry my face with my hands, start my car up, and begin my long drive to Colorado.</p><p>Chapter Four</p><p>Mia</p><p>It\u2019s early evening.</p><p>Two and a half very long days since I drove out of that Walmart parking lot, but I\u2019m finally here, driving across the city limits and into Durango.</p><p>I\u2019m stiff, tired, hungry and beyond crabby.</p><p>Apart from two nights spent in horrid motel rooms, all I\u2019ve done is drive. Thank god for the radio is all I can say. I\u2019ve spent entirely way too long in my car \u2013 more than any person ever should.</p><p>It\u2019s my own fault. I could have taken a little longer to get here, but I\u2019ve been on a mission to put as much distance between me and Forbes as possible.</p><p>I just need something to eat, then I want to lie down on a comfortable bed and sleep for a week at least, then I\u2019ll put my big girl panties on and go to this address that I have for Anna Monroe and find out if my mother still lives there. After that...</p><p>I have no clue.</p><p>I\u2019m leaving that one down to fate.</p><p>Sticking to the main road, I follow it into the center of town. I lean forward, which stretches my back out nicely, and peer through the windshield to take a look around.</p><p>It\u2019s a really pretty place. Quaint with a homey feel to it. I can see why someone would want to live here.</p><p>Why my mother would want to live here.</p><p>Lifting my eyes to the skyline, I see the backdrop of the mountains.</p><p>Wow. Stunning.</p><p>Leaning back in my seat, I catch sight of a diner. It looks nice and clean. I\u2019ll grab a quick bite to eat here, then find a hotel.</p><p>Checking the road is clear, I pull across and park up front the diner. I put my sunglasses back on before exiting my car. My black-eye is still looking noticeably bad.</p><p>Locking my car, I stretch my aching body out, then make my way toward the diner.</p><p>I push the door open and step inside. Glancing around, I see a lot of the booths are already taken, so I\u2019m praying they can seat me right away. I\u2019d skip eating tonight if I could, but I\u2019ve not eaten much these last few days, and I can feel the toll it\u2019s taking on my body.</p><p>A girl walks over to greet me. She is about my age, but half a foot taller with long straight brown hair.</p><p>\u201cHi, welcome to Jo\u2019s. I\u2019m Beth, I\u2019ll be your server. Just a table for one?\u201d she asks, glancing behind me.</p><p>\u201cYes. Just me.\u201d I smile awkwardly. I hate the discomfort that comes with eating alone.</p><p>Beth grabs a menu from the hostess stand, and I follow her over to an empty booth at the back of the diner. She places the menu on the table in front of me as I slide in the booth.</p><p>\u201cWhat can I get you to drink?\u201d Her pen is hovered over her notepad.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have a diet coke, please,\u201d I answer while my eyes make quick work of the menu. I just want to put my order in so I can eat quickly and drive to the nearest hotel. \u201cI\u2019d like to order my food now if that\u2019s okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d She smiles. \u201cWhat would you like?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCheeseburger and fries.\u201d I was never allowed to eat this kind of food growing up. Oliver wouldn\u2019t allow it, and of course, Forbes has an issue with it. He says the sight of a woman eating a greasy burger is disgusting. Or maybe just the sight of me eating one is what disgusts him.</p><p>This is the kind of food I eat in private. And now I\u2019m about to eat it in public.</p><p>Freaking thrilling.</p><p>Tragic, I know, but nonetheless true.</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d She takes the menu from me. \u201cYour food will be ten minutes. I\u2019ll be right back with your coke.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks. Um, I was wondering ... if you could help...\u201d</p><p>She gives a curious look.</p><p>I twist in my seat a little to look at her. \u201cI literally just arrived in town, and I need a place to stay, so I was wondering if you could recommend a decent hotel?\u201d</p><p>Her eyes appraise me, taking me in from the sunglasses on my face to the sneakers on my feet. It makes me feel uncomfortable and tense. I paste a smile on my face as I tuck my feet back under the table.</p><p>\u201cGolden Oaks,\u201d she says, putting the menu under her arm. \u201cIt\u2019s the best hotel in Durango by far. It\u2019s just up in the mountains. A bit further out than most, but well worth the journey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow far is the drive?\u201d The last thing I want to do is spend more time than necessary in my car.</p><p>I notice her watching my mouth, and realize that I\u2019m pulling on my lip with my finger and thumb. I do it when I\u2019m uncomfortable, or nervous. Which is often.</p><p>I lay my hand on the table.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just a fifteen minute drive \u2013 ten if you drive fast.\u201d She grins, tilting her head to the side.</p><p>I let out a little laugh. \u201cDo you have the address or street name? \u2013 For my GPS,\u201d I explain.</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d She scribbles on the notepad in her hand, then tears off the piece and hands it to me.</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo problem.\u201d She smiles, brightly. \u201cI\u2019ll be right back with that drink.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019ve just eaten, quite possibly the best burger I\u2019ve ever had in my life, and now I\u2019m back in my car, following the directions my GPS is telling me.</p><p>I\u2019m feeling pretty proud of myself. There was a point back at the diner when I felt the pressing urge to overeat once I started in on the burger\u2014stress catching up with me and trying to take control\u2014but I held myself together and contained the urge. I ate what was on my plate, paid my bill and left.</p><p>That was a big achievement for me. I\u2019ve never eaten food like that without purging it straight after.</p><p>Leaning forward, I glance around through the windshield. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Where in the hell am I?</p><p>All I\u2019m seeing is nothing but road.</p><p>And trees.</p><p>And more road.</p> <p>Lots and lots of winding road, going up and up, taking me further into the mountains.</p><p>I glance at my GPS checking the route. Yep, I\u2019m definitely going the right way, and according to this, I should be there in a few minutes.</p><p>Only I\u2019m still seeing nothing, and I already passed two other hotels on my way up here. I\u2019m really starting to regret not stopping at one of them. I\u2019m sick of driving, and I don\u2019t want to be staying in the middle of nowhere, but Beth from the diner did say it was the best hotel here, so on I go.</p><p>A few minutes later I see a sign for Golden Oaks. Hallelujah! I actually do a little mini air-punch, I\u2019m that relieved.</p><p>I catch site of the hotel from the main road. It looks pretty, and the backdrop of the mountains makes it seem even prettier. I\u2019d probably appreciate it a whole lot more if I weren\u2019t so bone tired.</p> <p>I take the turn as directed, and pull onto a long driveway. Tires crunching over the gravel, I drive on until the foliage disappears and the hotel opens up in front of me.</p><p>It\u2019s smaller close up. Pretty. And totally perfect.</p><p>I look around for designated parking, but there is none, so I pull up alongside an ostentatious red mustang which is parked on the grass just off the driveway. It looks like the type of car one of Forbes douchey friends would drive.</p><p>Forbes.</p><p>A shudder rolls through me at the mere thought of him. I\u2019ve made sure not to think of him once in the past few days. Keeping my phone turned off has really helped with that.</p><p>Grabbing my handbag off the passenger seat, I get out of my car, and stretch out again. My body feels as if it\u2019s seizing up. I just need to lie down on a soft mattress for a very long time. I\u2019m really hoping the beds here are comfy because the last two motel beds have been horrendous.</p> <p>Moving around my car, I pop the trunk and get my bag out.</p><p>The first thing I notice about this place is how quiet it is. Nothing but the sound of birds chirping in the background. Peaceful.</p><p>And perfect.</p><p>This place is starting to feel pretty close to heaven right now.</p><p>As I walk past the Mustang, I glance down at it and see that it has flames painted along the side.</p><p>Oh my god. This car is a definite penis enhancer if ever I saw one. I let out a snort of laughter and cover my hand with my mouth.</p><p>Stopping at the walkway leading up to the reception, I take a look around.</p><p>The hotel is a large wooden cabin style hotel, set on stilts which run down one side where the hill rolls down into what looks to be huge grounds. As I glance down, I see the building also goes down the side where the stilts round it. Maybe that\u2019s where the owners live. Large windows reflect out onto a wrap around porch up top. Lanterns light the front, giving it a warm glow, and there is a pretty garden at the bottom by the walkway up to the hotel. As I move toward it, the fragrance from the wide mixture of plants invades my senses. I stop and inhale deeply, letting out a contented sigh.</p> <p>I walk up the steps and onto the porch toward the reception so I can get checked into this place.</p><p>A bell tinkles when I push the door open. I step inside and find the place deserted.</p><p>It\u2019s just as pretty in here as it is outside. A dark oak reception desk is situated directly in front of me. To my left is an open sitting room complete with huge unlit fireplace, and there are three plush sofas situated around the room.</p><p>It looks so homey. I have a good feeling about this place.</p><p>\u201cHello? Is anyone there?\u201d I call out.</p><p>I don\u2019t hear anything for a moment, but then I hear, what sounds like an elephant bounding up stairs.</p><p>Then, quite literally, the epitome of everything a girl like me should stay away from walks through the door directly behind the reception desk.</p><p>Lean. Tall. Tattooed \u2013 one of them covering the full of his arm. Dark brown hair, long, but not ponytail long; surfer boy long and hanging in his eyes.</p><p>Taking me in, he sweeps his hair back revealing eyes the color of maple syrup. I have the sudden urge to eat pancakes.</p><p>This guy is gorgeous.</p><p>Masculine...</p><p>Strong jawline...</p><p>Everything about him screams male.</p><p>He looks like sin.</p><p>Like hot, dirty, incredible sex.</p><p>Jesus Christ! Where did that come from? I never think of men and sex\u2014or sex with men\u2014in that way.</p><p>I realize I\u2019m staring at him, so I open my mouth and speak.</p><p>\u201cHello.\u201d I moisten my dry lips with my tongue.</p><p>Tattooed Adonis says nothing.</p><p>He stares at me like I\u2019m an alien who just landed on this planet \u2013 like he\u2019s not quite sure what to do with me, or why I\u2019m here.</p><p>Maybe I made a mistake coming here. Maybe they\u2019re closed for the season, and Beth got it wrong.</p><p>I\u2019m ready to back up and leave when he speaks. His voice is as deep and manly as I\u2019d expect it to be. It sends shivers coursing over my skin.</p><p>\u201cHow can I help?\u201d he asks.</p><p>How can he help? This is a hotel, right? I\u2019m tempted to step back outside and check the sign again.</p><p>\u201cI, uh, need a room.\u201d I move closer to the counter. \u201cBeth, the girl at the diner in town? She sent me here. Said you\u2019d have a room available.\u201d</p><p>He stares at me for a long moment. I\u2019m just starting to wonder if I\u2019ve got something on my face, when I see he\u2019s actually staring at my sunglasses. He\u2019s probably wondering why I\u2019m wearing them at night. Well, rather this than have him staring at my black eye.</p><p>He looks down at the desk in front of him. \u201cWe do. How long do you want to stay for?\u201d</p><p>I almost sigh in relief that they\u2019ve got availability. The last thing I want to do is get back in my car.</p><p>How long do I want to stay for?</p><p>\u201cUm...\u201d It\u2019s my turn to look down. I shift on my feet, thinking.</p><p>I need a while to give me time to find my mother. And if I do find her, then I\u2019ll need time with her.</p><p>If she wants to see me that is.</p><p>I wonder how long they rent rooms for. Looking up, I say, \u201cI\u2019m not sure ... two weeks?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you asking or telling me?\u201d</p><p>Wow. Okay. He might be good-looking, but he\u2019s not very nice. But what do I expect? Forbes is handsome\u2014more in a classic way than this guy here\u2014and he\u2019s the biggest asshole of all.</p><p>Pulling on my lower lip with my finger, I swallow, then fold my arms over my chest, and steel my voice. \u201cI want to stay for two weeks, and I\u2019m asking if you have a room available for that long?\u201d</p><p>He looks down at the booking sheet, then looks up. His eyes flicker past me before coming back to my face. \u201cWe do. It\u2019s one hundred and seventy five a night.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s certainly a lot more expensive than the last two motels I\u2019ve stayed at, but it\u2019s far nicer, and it\u2019s not like I can\u2019t afford it, courtesy of Oliver\u2019s tainted money. And honestly, right now I\u2019d pay anything to be able to sleep in a comfy bed.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s fine,\u201d I say.</p><p>He gives me a narrowed look, then draws a line across the book in front of him. He reaches into a drawer, returning with a sheet of paper which he slides across the desk and puts a pen beside it. \u201cFill this out with your name and home address.\u201d</p><p>I pick up the pen.</p><p>Should I put an incorrect address like I did at the last two places I stayed? I don\u2019t want a trace back to me in case Forbes is looking for me. And tied together with my name, he\u2019d know it was me that has been here.</p><p>But then I\u2019m not staying just one night like those other places. And it would look suspicious if I lie about where I live, and this guy finds out.</p><p>I decide to go with the truth and write my real home address and cell phone number down. Forbes won\u2019t be looking for me way out here. I\u2019m half-way across the country. Two thousand miles from home.</p><p>When I\u2019m done, I hand the form back to him. My fingers accidentally touch his. Warm, rough fingers. Yet gentle. They feel good.</p><p>Deceptive.</p><p>Because men\u2019s hands cause pain. They give hard, sharp slaps. They give black eyes. Grabbing, clutching, never-ending pain...</p><p>I pull my hand back quickly and wrap it into my other.</p><p>Face prickling, I look into the living area, imagining the fireplace lit. I can almost feel the warmth on my face if I just close my eyes.</p><p>\u201cI just need your card details and we\u2019re done. Your card won\u2019t be charged until you check out.\u201d Tattooed Adonis\u2019 voice snaps me back to the now.</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>I get my card from my purse. I hold it out for him to take, but he ignores me and instead starts fussing with one of those card devices. Then he hands it to me without casting a glance my way.</p><p>\u201cPut your card in...\u201d</p><p>I do as asked.</p><p>\u201cAnd now your PIN.\u201d</p><p>When I\u2019m done, he takes the device back from me, eyes still off somewhere else.</p><p>I watch him with interest as he stares at the little electronic gadget.</p><p>He really is gorgeous. The more I look at him, the more handsome he becomes. I have never seen someone who is as physically attractive as this guy.</p><p>I bet he has women tripping over themselves to be with him. And I think he knows exactly how good-looking he is. I can see it in the confident tilt of his stance, and the air of indifference he exudes.</p><p>He removes my card from the machine, then hands it back to me. I slide it in my back pocket.</p><p>I see him get a key from a hook on the wall.</p><p>He steps out from behind the counter. \u201cThis way.\u201d</p><p>I reach down to grab my bags, and with much effort, hoist them to my shoulder.</p><p>They feel way heavier than they did five minutes ago. Must be knowing I\u2019m one step closer to a bed ... one step closer to sleep, that has really set the fatigue in.</p><p>\u201cHere let me get those for you,\u201d Tattooed Adonis says, his hand reached out toward me.</p><p>Is he being nice to me? Why?</p><p>He wasn\u2019t being nice a few minutes ago, and he has barely given me a glance. And in my experience, men are only nice when they want something. I have nothing to give this guy.</p><p>Retracting his hand, he scratches his head and frowns at me. \u201cIt\u2019s my job to carry your bags. We\u2019re not the kind of establishment that has a bellboy,\u201d he says, then grins. A boyish kind of grin.</p><p>Oh, right. Stupid Mia.</p><p>I lift the bags from my shoulder and hand them to him. My body sighs in relief. \u201cThank you.\u201d I smile.</p><p>A weird look passes over his face, then he frowns again. Slinging my bags over his shoulder, he strides off down the hall.</p><p>Okay, mood swing much? Nice one minute, moody the next. But then, aren\u2019t all men like that? Some more than others.</p><p>I\u2019m practically jogging to catch up with him, then Tattooed Adonis comes to an abrupt stop outside a door half-way down the hall. I have to catch myself from running into the back of him. He unlocks the door and goes in the room, turning the light on, and setting my bags on the bed.</p><p>I try to step inside the room, but I can\u2019t. My muscles are frozen.</p><p>Being out there alone in the reception with him was okay because it\u2019s a public place. But this ... I can\u2019t walk into this room alone with him. He could trap me.</p><p>The lock clicks.</p><p>I turn around.</p><p>Oliver is dangling the key from his hand. His belt in the other. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cTime for a lesson, Mia.\u201d</p><p>My eyes search tattoo Adonis\u2019 jeans. He\u2019s not wearing a belt.</p><p>What difference does that make? He wouldn\u2019t need a belt to hurt me. There are other ways to hurt someone. Many other ways.</p><p>Why did he go in the room?</p> <p>To put your bags in your room. To do his job.</p><p>This guy isn\u2019t Oliver or Forbes. He\u2019s just some guy who works at a hotel. He\u2019s not going to hurt me. Not all men all cruel.</p><p>I\u2019m safe here. This is a hotel. There are other people staying here.</p><p>Actually, come to think of it, I haven\u2019t seen another soul since I arrived. Only him. And there was only one other car parked up outside when I arrived. The Mustang \u2013 the penis enhancer \u2013 which could be his car.</p><p>Oh god, is that his car? Am I alone in this hotel with him?</p> <p>That\u2019s his car, and I\u2019m alone in this hotel with him.</p><p>Chills shiver down my spine. I try to take in a deep breath, but my lungs won\u2019t allow it. Panic is gripping my chest like a vice.</p><p>It\u2019s okay, Mia. Calm down. There could be people in the other rooms. It\u2019s evening. They could be settled in for the night. Or out and returning later. Just because there isn\u2019t another car parked outside, doesn\u2019t mean a thing.</p><p>Tattooed Adonis turns around. He tilts his head to the side, giving me a questioning look.</p><p>Can\u2019t blame him. I am standing in the hall, acting like a complete weirdo, on the verge of a panic attack.</p><p>His eyes move down my body. Why is looking at me like that?</p> <p>All my senses kick into high-alert.</p><p>I wrap my arms around my chest and straighten my back, trying to look taller and more confident than I could ever hope to be.</p><p>I can take care of myself now. I\u2019m stronger than I used to be. I kneed Forbes in the balls and got away, didn\u2019t I?</p><p>Tattooed Adonis walks toward me. My urge to bolt becomes compelling.</p><p>I am not weak. I am not weak.</p><p>I\u2019m a strong woman.</p><p>I force myself to keep steady, and step back to give him space to pass by.</p><p>Tattooed Adonis towers over me. I knew he was a lot taller than me\u2014not that it\u2019s hard being that I\u2019m pocket sized\u2014but it\u2019s so much more noticeable now he\u2019s closer to me, and surprisingly, his closeness isn\u2019t freaking me out as much as it should.</p> <p>\u201cYour key,\u201d he offers.</p><p>I take it from him.</p><p>\u201cBreakfast is served between seven and eight-thirty,\u201d he states before walking away. Stopping, he adds, \u201cAnd we don\u2019t do evening meals, but there are plenty of restaurants nearby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre there any other guests staying here?\u201d I have to ask.</p><p>He stops and turns back. \u201cNo. Not until next week. Until then, it\u2019s just you and me.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m pretty sure my heart just died in my chest.</p><p>Me. Alone. Here.</p><p>With him.</p><p>No. No. No.</p><p>I can\u2019t do that. I am stronger than I was, but that\u2019s pushing myself to far too soon.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry it\u2019s totally safe out here,\u201d he says. I\u2019m guessing it\u2019s the look on utter panic on my face prompting this. \u201cWe have a great alarm system, and I have a shotgun. You know, just in case.\u201d</p><p>A gun.</p><p>God, no.</p><p>\u201cWhat would happen if I pulled this trigger, Mia?\u201d</p><p>I squeezed my eyes shut as I felt the cold metal press against my forehead. I could feel my body begin to sweat.</p><p>But I held myself together. Made sure not to cry. If I did, it only made him angry.</p><p>\u201cI would die, Oliver.\u201d</p><p>The gun pushed harder against my head. \u201cOliver!\u201d he yelled. \u201cYou know to address me only as sir or daddy! How many times do I have to tell you this? How many lessons will it take?\u201d</p><p>Shit. Shit. Shit.</p><p>I\u2019m so stupid.</p><p>The gun retracted.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m s-sorry, s-sir\u2014d-daddy.\u201d My voice was shaking as hard as my body because I knew what would come next.</p><p>And my fear was confirmed when I heard the familiar snap of his belt.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m totally kidding. I don\u2019t have a gun here.\u201d The sound of Tattooed Adonis\u2019 voice brings me to the now.</p><p>I need to be sick. Fear and bad memories are creeping across my skin, standing every hair on end.</p><p>I\u2019m trying to stay calm. Stay normal. I don\u2019t want to freak out in front of this guy, but it\u2019s getting increasingly hard.</p><p>He lifts his hands in a gentle gesture. \u201cNo guns. I promise. No need for them, like I said, it\u2019s a safe place.\u201d</p><p>Breathing in through my nose, I pull on my lip and tuck my short hair behind my ear.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d he asks, taking a step forward.</p><p>No.</p><p>Be strong. Stay here. You can do this, Mia.</p><p>\u201cYes. I\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>His stare on me is curious. Can\u2019t blame him. I am acting like a nutball.</p><p>\u201cOkay, well if you need anything, just press reception on the phone in your room and it\u2019ll bring you straight through to me.\u201d He turns to leave. \u201cGoodnight, Mia.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know my name?\u201d</p><p>Looking back, his eyebrow lifts. \u201cI got it from your details when you filled the booking form in.\u201d</p><p>He smiles. It\u2019s a really nice smile. Warm. Friendly. It eases me some.</p><p>\u201cOh, right. Yes.\u201d I laugh, feeling a little stupid. \u201cWhat should I call you?\u201d</p><p>He smiles again. \u201cJordan.\u201d</p><p>I turn to face him. \u201cIs this your hotel, Jordan?\u201d</p><p>He laughs. It\u2019s a deep, manly sound that makes my stomach do somersaults. \u201cNo. My dad\u2019s. He\u2019s away taking care of my Grandpa at the moment, so I\u2019m holding the fort.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, nothing serious I hope?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, just a minor op, but he\u2019s off his feet for a few weeks, so Dad\u2019s gone to take care of him.\u201d</p><p>I nod. \u201cWell, thank you. Again.\u201d I smile at him as I back up and quickly retreat into my room.</p><p>I lock the door behind me and fall against it.</p><p>Deep breaths, Mia.</p><p>This is going to be okay. And apart from his snippiness before, Jordan does seem like a good guy.</p><p>Yeah, but so did Forbes.</p><p>I grab the chair I just spotted by the dressing table, drag it over to the door, and push it up under the handle.</p><p>Doesn\u2019t hurt to be safe.</p><p>Turning, I take the room in for the first time. Really pretty. A four poster bed dressed in soft beige linens rests against the back wall. A large window is situated to the side, and on the far wall there are double glass doors. I go over to the doors and push the drapes back to peer out. I can\u2019t see much; just the porch and the moonlight pouring over trees in the distance. I\u2019ll check it out in the morning.</p><p>I double check that the doors are locked, then close the drapes, including the ones on the windows.</p><p>I stand in the middle of the room. The silence chills me, and my mind starts to overwork again.</p><p>Fear curdles inside and poisons me.</p><p>And I can\u2019t stop myself from walking straight to the bathroom, kneeling down in front of the toilet, lifting the lid, and purging.</p><p>Chapter Five</p><p>Jordan</p><p>A few hours earlier...</p><p>I climb out of bed. Removing the condom, I tie a knot in the end and toss it in the trashcan. Grabbing my jeans from the floor, I start to pull them on.</p><p>\u201cStay in bed with me.\u201d Shawna\u2019s hand sneaks out from under the cover and grabs hold of my hand, tugging on it.</p><p>I pull it free. \u201cCan\u2019t. I\u2019ve got work to do. And I need to get this bed made up.\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s a lie. There\u2019s not a lot to do here at the moment. We need guests to create work, and currently there aren\u2019t any, so the world won\u2019t end if this bed stays unmade for a while longer. I just don\u2019t want to stay in bed with her and cuddle.</p><p>Because that\u2019s what she\u2019s asking. She doesn\u2019t have to say the exact words. I just know when it reaches this point with a woman.</p><p>And that\u2019s when I\u2019m done.</p><p>I\u2019m not a cuddler.</p><p>I fuck.</p><p>The end.</p><p>She knows this. I told her right before we started having sex how it was. Like I tell them all. It\u2019s just a shame they don\u2019t bother to listen, regardless of how heavily I highlight the fact.</p><p>Guess it\u2019s time to put the brakes on this little thing we\u2019ve had going. Shame. She was pretty good in the sack.</p><p>I\u2019m just pulling my t-shirt on when she climbs out of bed.</p><p>I watch her walk toward me. I might be about to call time on her, but that doesn\u2019t mean I can\u2019t appreciate her fine body \u2013 legs that go on forever, and tits that are definitely not real. Still, I wasn\u2019t complaining when I had them in my mouth ten minutes ago.</p><p>She presses herself up against me. Arms snaking around my waist, she starts to kiss my neck. \u201cI want to fuck again,\u201d she murmurs against my skin.</p><p>Tempting as that is, just knowing what\u2019s going on inside her head\u2014the words \u2018Jordan\u2019 and \u2018boyfriend\u2019\u2014keeps my boy at bay.</p><p>You might think I\u2019m a bastard for just having sex with her and then calling time, and really that wasn\u2019t my intention when I crawled into bed with her an hour ago. I\u2019d thought there were a few more times to be had.</p><p>Until she wanted to get cozy with me.</p><p>I usually end these things in a much nicer way, but trust me, it\u2019s crueler to let her leave here thinking I\u2019m going to call her again when I\u2019m not.</p><p>I\u2019m always honest, if nothing else.</p><p>Reaching behind me I take hold of her hands. Pulling her free from around my waist, I squeeze her hands, then let go.</p><p>I step back from her. \u201cLook, Shawna, it\u2019s been great an\u2019 all ... but I\u2019d say we\u2019re done here.\u201d</p><p>She pauses. Frowns. Then gets this crazy look in her eyes that some chicks get when they realize you\u2019re ending things with them.</p><p>The stage five clinger look.</p><p>\u201cDone?\u201d Her voice has gone screechy.</p><p>Fuck.</p><p>I really didn\u2019t have her pegged as stage five clinger material when I met her. Guess I got that plenty fucking wrong.</p><p>I could really do without a crazy chick moment right now.</p><p>Here we go...</p><p>\u201cShawna...\u201d I rub my forehead, and drive my fingers into my hair, pushing it back. \u201cWe both knew what this was from the beginning. I was clear on that. It was never gonna last longer than a few weeks, and we\u2019re already well past that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been a week, Jordan.\u201d</p><p>Fuck, is that all? Feels way longer. Definitely time to get rid of her.</p><p>\u201cLook...\u201d I put on my best \u2018sensitive, but I\u2019m still ditching your ass\u2019 voice. \u201cIt\u2019s been fun, Shawna. You\u2019re fun. But it\u2019s time to move on.\u201d</p><p>With a look straight from the devil, she grabs her clothes from the floor and starts yanking them on.</p><p>\u201cFun? FUN!\u201d Her screeching is actually hurting my ears. \u201cI thought we had something really great here! I thought you really liked me!\u201d</p><p>See what I mean?</p><p>Never.</p><p>Fucking.</p><p>Listen.</p><p>\u201cWhen did I say that? Oh yeah, never. I thought you were hot, and I definitely wanted to have sex with you \u2013 multiple times. But feelings never came into it. Not once. And no fuckin\u2019 way do I want a relationship.\u201d</p><p>Ouch. That was probably a bit harsh.</p><p>She steps close and pokes me in the chest with her fingernail. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Fuck, that hurt. Her nails are sharp. They felt good when they were raking down my back, but now, not so much.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a fucking bastard!\u201d she yells in my face. \u201cAnd you\u2019re going to spend your whole life lonely and miserable!\u201d</p><p>Wow, so original \u2013 like I haven\u2019t heard that line before. Why do all women say that exact same thing when you\u2019re blowing them off?</p><p>Trust me, I\u2019m not miserable. Far from it.</p> <p>Seeing what my dad\u2019s gone through ... loving Mom, then having to watch her die ... seeing how my dad is now ... an empty shell of the man he was...</p><p>That\u2019s misery.</p><p>I\u2019m never putting myself through that. I\u2019ll stay as I am, thanks.</p><p>When it comes to women, I put my dick in and keep my heart out. It\u2019s the easiest way.</p><p>I lean down, close to her face. \u201cShawna, you knew from the beginning I wasn\u2019t in for anything more than a fuck, so don\u2019t act all shocked and shit on now. You knew exactly who you were getting into bed with.\u201d</p> <p>Why do all women think they can change me? I\u2019m unchangeable. When will they get this?</p><p>\u201cFuck you!\u201d she screams. She actually screams at me.</p><p>Jesus Christ, I cannot stand dramatic women. Nothing turns me off quicker ... well, apart from cuddling.</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t that the point?\u201d I smirk, stepping back. \u201cYou want to fuck, and I don\u2019t.\u201d I sweep my arm out in the direction of the door. \u201cDon\u2019t let the door hit your ass on the way out, sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m not usually this much of a dick, but honestly, she\u2019s getting on my last fucking nerve.</p><p>Shawna looks as if she\u2019s ready to pummel me to death. Bending down, she grabs her heels, shoves her feet in them, and grabs her purse from the nightstand.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to regret this,\u201d she hisses.</p><p>\u201cNot likely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAsshole!\u201d She pushes her way past me, and stomps out the room, slamming the door behind her.</p><p>I hear her heels clattering down the hall, then the main door slams shut. A minute later, her car engines revs loudly, and spinning tires kick up against the gravel.</p><p>Well, that went well.</p><p>I run my hands through my hair, then go and grab some clean sheets from the linen closet.</p><p>I strip the bed and have it remade in two minutes flat.</p><p>Can you tell this isn\u2019t my first rodeo?</p> <p>I have sex in the hotel rooms because I don\u2019t like to share my bed. I want to go to sleep without the scent of sex lingering from the last girl I hooked up with. And for some reason, the girls I hook up with seem to think it\u2019s romantic to have sex in a hotel room.</p><p>Couldn\u2019t be less so in my opinion.</p><p>But they think that, so it works well for me. This is when living at a hotel comes in handy.</p><p>I bundle the dirty sheets up in my arms to take to the laundry room.</p><p>Guess it\u2019s time to find a new fuck buddy. First things first, though. Shower, then food.</p><p>I\u2019m starving.</p><p>I\u2019m just biting into my sandwich when the phone rings. Putting it back down on the plate, I grab the phone off the wall, quickly chewing and swallowing down my bite. God, that\u2019s good. I make a great fucking sandwich.</p><p>\u201cGolden Oaks,\u201d I say, cleaning sandwich off my teeth with my tongue.</p><p>\u201cJordan, it\u2019s Beth.\u201d</p><p>I sit back down in my seat. \u201cBeth, I know it\u2019s you. I\u2019ve known you my whole life, so it\u2019s safe to say I recognize your voice on the phone.\u201d</p><p>She laughs. \u201cFair enough. Anyway, I\u2019m just calling to let you know I\u2019ve sent a tourist up your way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, great thanks. You\u2019re good to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know I am. Too good. And Jordan, the tourist is a girl. And she\u2019s pretty, real pretty. So just try to keep it in your pants, okay? Your dad needs the business, and screwing the guests, then screwing them over, just doesn\u2019t bode well with that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus, Beth! One time. One fuckin\u2019 time it happened! And she never told me she was married.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne!\u201d She laughs. \u201cAngry husband\u2019s aside, I can count off the top of my head at least ten women you\u2019ve had hissing at you this past year, and it\u2019s only July.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTen? Come on that\u2019s a bit of an exaggeration.\u201d</p><p>She laughs, once. \u201cI was being kind with that figure.\u201d</p><p>I do quick math in my head.</p><p>Okay, maybe she\u2019s right.</p><p>\u201cWhatever,\u201d I mutter. \u201cI\u2019m actually a little insulted you think women leave here with not one good word to say after a ride from Jordan Matthews.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t talk about yourself in the third person, it freaks me out when you do that. And yes, once you stick your dick in a woman it doesn\u2019t end in a song of happiness. You\u2019re awesome at the wooing. Just not the ending.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t woo. We\u2019re not in the nineteenth century. I fuck. And I\u2019m awesome at it. Hence why women keep coming back for more. And can you stop talking about my dick? You\u2019re actually starting to turn me on, and that\u2019s freaking me out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUgh, god! Okay, we\u2019ll end the conversation here. Just leave the pretty tourist alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou seem overly pushy on this one. Are you warning me off for another reason? Maybe because you want her for yourself?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJordan Matthews!\u201d she scolds, making me laugh. \u201cOne, she\u2019s not into girls. I could tell. And two, she\u2019s too pretty if you know what I mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I really don\u2019t,\u201d I deadpan. \u201cThere\u2019s no such thing as too pretty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, there is. There\u2019s the kind of pretty that comes with a warning label. This girl is trouble. Look, I have to go. The diner\u2019s busy, and Mom is shooting me daggers from up front. Just be good, for me. And if not for me, your dad. He could really do without the hassle after everything that\u2019s happened.\u201d</p><p>My back stiffens.</p><p>Her stark reminder is like a sharp slap in the face. Probably one I needed.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not saying anything ... did I overstep the mark?\u201d she says softly.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I sigh. \u201cYou said what I needed to hear. I\u2019ll be good, I promise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m only looking out for you because I love you, you know that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. And you\u2019re the only woman who can say that to me without sending me running.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because I haven\u2019t slept with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd that is because you, Beth Turner, are one smart girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. That, and the fact I\u2019m a lesbian.\u201d</p><p>I chuckle. \u201cWell, yeah. That too.\u201d</p><p>Fifteen minutes later, I hear a car pulling up the drive. It\u2019ll be the hot tourist.</p><p>I\u2019m going to show Beth that I\u2019m completely capable of keeping myself in check around a pretty girl.</p><p>I am not ruled by my dick.</p><p>And anyway, just because Beth thinks she\u2019s pretty doesn\u2019t mean I will.</p><p>She could be fuck ugly. Or at the very least, a butter face.</p><p>Nah. Who am I kidding? If Beth thinks she\u2019s pretty, then I definitely will. We have the same taste in women.</p><p>A few minutes later, I hear the bell ring on the main door.</p><p>Showtime.</p><p>I haul my ass out of the chair and start to make my way upstairs. As I\u2019m climbing, I hear her voice call out.</p><p>\u201cHello? Is anyone there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJeez, give me a minute,\u201d I mutter.</p><p>I take the rest of the stairs two at a time, quickly moving through the office, out to the reception desk, and...</p><p>Fuck me.</p><p>Fucking. Fuck. Fuck.</p><p>The hottest chick I have ever seen in my life is standing before me.</p><p>The.</p><p>Hottest.</p><p>Ever.</p><p>Beth calling her pretty was an understatement. A massive understatement.</p><p>She\u2019s stunning.</p><p>And I\u2019m so completely screwed.</p><p>It\u2019s weird though because I usually go for tall girls. I like long legs, but this girl is tiny. I\u2019d give her five-three max. At six-two, I\u2019m almost a whole foot taller than her. And her tits are smaller than I usually prefer.</p><p>Her hair is blonde and short. Pixie cut. She kind of looks like Tinker Bell. I usually dig long hair on chicks; something to wrap my hand around while I fuck them.</p><p>But this girl, who is pretty much the opposite of everything I usually go for, has made my dick as hard as stone just by looking at her.</p><p>Never. Happened. Before.</p><p>I usually need them to be naked, or to at least have a little hands on action first.</p><p>She\u2019s like the world\u2019s best visual hand job.</p><p>Seriously, I think if she just lays a finger on me I\u2019ll jizz my pants, and that hasn\u2019t happened since seventh grade when I was with Katie Harris in the sports closet. Two tugs and I was done. Not one of my finer moments, but in my defense, Katie was the first girl to touch my cock.</p><p>I\u2019m just thanking my good luck right now that this reception desk is high enough to hide the massive boner I\u2019m sporting.</p><p>\u201cHello,\u201d she says. Her tongue darts out to moisten her lips.</p><p>Jesus, she has the sweetest looking mouth. The kind of cherry red lips you want to suck on. The kind of lips I want to see sucking me off.</p><p>I only wish I could see her eyes. Eyes are my other thing aside from legs. I like them big, but she\u2019s wearing huge ass sunglasses. I hate it when women do that. It\u2019s sunny, you wear sunglasses. Not at eight in the goddamn evening.</p><p>Realizing I haven\u2019t spoken a word in reply, and have done nothing but stare at this girl for an insane amount of time, I find my voice and ask, \u201cHow can I help?\u201d</p><p>There are a few different ways she could answer that question. One involves her telling me to bend her over this reception desk and...</p><p>\u201cI, uh, need a room.\u201d</p><p>Jesus, her voice is as sweet as light molasses.</p><p>My dick twitches, pulsing hard against my, now, incredibly tight jeans.</p><p>I need this hard on to disappear.</p><p>I can do this. My dick does not rule me. I\u2019m in control here.</p><p>Think of being some chick\u2019s boyfriend, Matthews. The stage five clinger from earlier...</p><p>And there you go. Down boy.</p><p>Hot girl steps close to the counter and sets her bags to the floor.</p><p>She smells good. Like a mixture of vanilla and expensive perfume.</p><p>I want to lean in close and inhale.</p><p>And possibly lick her.</p><p>She moistens her lips again before speaking. It\u2019s really distracting. \u201cBeth, the girl at the diner in town? She sent me here. Said you\u2019d have a room available.\u201d</p><p>I pull my eyes from her lips and stare into those ugly ass sunglasses. All I get is my own reflection back. Which is not a bad thing, I just really want to see her without them on.</p><p>I wonder if she\u2019d be offended if I reached over and pulled them off?</p><p>Clearing my head and throat, I say, \u201cWe do. How long do want to stay for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm.\u201d She tilts her chin down and shifts on her feet. \u201cI\u2019m not sure ... two weeks?\u201d</p><p>Two weeks. This is just the kind of money we could do with right now. If I can keep my hands off her that is.</p><p>\u201cAre you asking or telling me?\u201d</p><p>Wow, I sounded like a complete asshole then.</p><p>She looks uncomfortable.</p><p>And I feel like shit.</p><p>What the hell is wrong with me?</p><p>Her hand reaches up and starts to pull on her lower lip \u2013 it\u2019s actually kind of hot watching her tug on that lip. It\u2019s definitely turning me on again. Okay, so again is probably the wrong word since I haven\u2019t been \u2018off\u2019 since I laid eyes on her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Letting go of the lip that I most certainly want to suck on, she folds her arms. \u201cI want to stay for two weeks, and I\u2019m asking if you have a room available for that long?\u201d</p><p>Forcing my eyes from her, I look down at the booking sheet.</p><p>Like I have to check. Of course I have a room free for two weeks. We don\u2019t have another booking coming until next week, and that\u2019s the Perry\u2019s who stay every year for their anniversary. I just needed a reprieve before I do something stupid, like hit on her.</p><p>God, I want to hit on her. So bad.</p> <p>Clear your head, Matthews. No hitting on the hot tourist.</p><p>You can do this.</p><p>Right. I\u2019ll put her in Lakeview. It\u2019s the most expensive room we have. And the nicest. The kind of room a girl like her should stay in.</p><p>And judging from the flashy Mercedes I can see parked outside, I\u2019m guessing she can more than afford it.</p><p>Also, it\u2019s the one room I haven\u2019t had sex in. Not that it matters in regards to her, but Mom and Dad spent their first night as a married couple in Lakeview. That\u2019s why I steer clear of it.</p> <p>\u201cWe do,\u201d I say. \u201cIt\u2019s one hundred and seventy five a night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s fine,\u201d she replies. She doesn\u2019t even blink.</p><p>Like I thought. Loaded. I wonder if it\u2019s Daddy\u2019s money, or maybe she has a husband?</p><p>She doesn\u2019t look old enough to be married, but who knows the ages of women nowadays. Earlier this year, I banged a chick who looked twenty, but she was thirty. The marvels of plastic surgery.</p><p>I give a quick check to her ring finger. Empty.</p><p>Picking up a pen, I mark out the week. I pull out a booking form from the drawer for her to fill out her details, then slide it across the counter to her, putting the pen I was just using beside it.</p> <p>\u201cFill this out with your name and home address.\u201d</p><p>She picks the pen up. I notice her hand is trembling. Odd. Is she nervous, or afraid?</p><p>Not a damn reason she would have to be afraid, so I\u2019m betting on nervous.</p><p>Now why would a hot girl like her be nervous around me? Only one reason. She wants a piece. They always do.</p><p>Hey, I\u2019m not an arrogant ass. I\u2019m just aware of how I look. And most women like how I look. Okay, all women like how I look. It\u2019s the hair and tattoos. They like the bad boys, and I\u2019m bad. What can I say?</p><p>But this girl is not worldly. I can tell. This one is inexperienced, hence the nerves. Maybe she\u2019s a virgin.</p><p>Nah, she can\u2019t be a virgin looking like she does.</p><p>She finishes filling out her details and hands the paper back to me. Her fingers brush mine in the exchange. She snatches her hand back like touching me is a big no-no.</p> <p>Odd. Women usually can\u2019t wait to get their hands on me.</p><p>I glance down at her name on the paper in my hand.</p><p>Mia Monroe.</p><p>Huh. Like Marilyn Monroe, but not.</p><p>I didn\u2019t just say that out loud, did I?</p><p>I cast a glance at her. She\u2019s staring off toward the living room.</p><p>No, don\u2019t think I did. Thank fuck for that.</p><p>\u201cI just need your card details and we\u2019re done. Your card won\u2019t be charged until you check out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d She bends down to her bag. I take the opportunity to lean over the counter and check her ass out.</p><p>Nice. Real nice.</p><p>I shouldn\u2019t have looked because I\u2019m getting hard again.</p><p>She comes back up with her card in hand.</p><p>I key the amount in and hand the card device to her.</p><p>\u201cPut your card in ... and now your PIN.\u201d</p><p>I take the device back and wait for it to ring through.</p><p>When it\u2019s done, I pull her card from the machine and hand it back to her.</p><p>I notice she takes care not to touch me this time.</p><p>She shoves the card in her back jean pocket. For a moment, I actually wish I was that card.</p><p>I grab the key for Lakeview and step out from behind the counter. \u201cThis way.\u201d</p><p>She reaches down for her bags and sluggishly lifts them to her shoulder. That\u2019s when I realize how tired she looks.</p><p>Here I am checking her out like a total douche, and the girl is exhausted. I feel like a complete tool. My mom raised me better than this.</p><p>\u201cHere let me get those for you.\u201d I hold my hand out to take her bags.</p><p>She hesitates. Her fingers curl around the handles, gripping them tight to her.</p><p>What does she think I\u2019m going to do, run off with her stuff?</p><p>Retracting my hand, I scratch my head. \u201cIt\u2019s my job to carry your bags. We\u2019re not the kind of establishment that has a bellboy.\u201d I grin so not come off as an asshole. She is a paying guest after all.</p><p>Her death grip relaxes and she lifts the bags from her shoulder, placing them in my hand.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she says in that sweet voice of hers.</p><p>She doesn\u2019t talk much, but when she does ... it\u2019s effective.</p><p>Then she smiles.</p><p>I called her stunning before. I take it back. With that smile, she\u2019s nothing short of beautiful.</p><p>I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever referred to a woman as beautiful before. Now, there\u2019s a first.</p><p>If she can look this beautiful with those huge hideous sunglasses covering what I imagine is the best part of her face, then I can only imagine how she looks without them.</p><p>And how she would look under me.</p><p>Naked.</p><p>I sling her bags over my shoulder and stride off in the direction of Lakeview.</p><p>You can\u2019t have sex with her, Matthews.</p><p>My dick, of course, disagrees. Yeah, my dick is absolutely positive that I could screw this chick for two weeks straight and not get bored once.</p><p>Who am I kidding? I\u2019d get bored after a week. I lasted that long with Shawna, and she had a huge rack and legs that went on forever.</p><p>But even with those assets, she was nowhere near as hot as Mia Monroe.</p><p>Hot or not. I don\u2019t have the staying power. And right now, money is more important. And proving a point to Beth, of course.</p><p>I come to a stop outside Lakeview. I unlock the door, turn the light on and go inside, setting her bags on the bed.</p><p>When I turn back, I see she\u2019s still standing out in the hall.</p><p>Everything about her body language screams tense. My eyes flicker to her hands. They\u2019re trembling again.</p><p>What is wrong with this girl? I thought it was because she was hot for me, but no, it\u2019s not that. It\u2019s something else.</p><p>She wraps her arms around her chest and straightens her back up.</p><p>With care, I walk toward her. She steps back to let me pass.</p><p>\u201cYour key.\u201d I hold it out to her, leaving a distance between us.</p><p>Freeing a hand, she takes it from me.</p><p>And now it\u2019s me making sure not to touch her in this exchange. Even though I want to, something tells me that right now I shouldn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cBreakfast is served between seven and eight-thirty.\u201d It\u2019s on me to make breakfast tomorrow as it\u2019s Paula\u2019s day off. Paula is both our cleaner and our cook. She\u2019s worked here ever since I can remember.</p><p>\u201cAnd we don\u2019t do evening meals, but there are plenty of restaurants nearby,\u201d I add, remembering the remainder of my spiel.</p><p>\u201cAre there any other guests staying here?\u201d Her voice sounds small.</p><p>I turn back to her. \u201cNo. Not until next week. Until then, it\u2019s just you and me.\u201d</p><p>The look on her face throws me for a loop. She looks terrified.</p><p>What the hell? Jeez, it\u2019s not like we\u2019re the Overlook Hotel.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry. It\u2019s totally safe out here,\u201d I feel compelled to say. \u201cWe have a great alarm system, and I have a shotgun. You know, just in case.\u201d I wink as I laugh.</p><p>At the mention of a shotgun, her body stiffens and she looks like she\u2019s about to bolt.</p><p>Or puke.</p><p>Okay, I\u2019m guessing that was the wrong thing to say.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m totally kidding, I don\u2019t have a gun here.\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s a bit of a lie. We do have guns. My dad used to be a cop, so he still has shotguns, and rifles for hunting. I know how to shoot. I\u2019m pretty good. Dad taught me when I was a kid, but I think it\u2019s best if she doesn\u2019t know that.</p><p>I lift my empty hands, palms facing, placating. \u201cNo guns. I promise. No need for them. Like I said, it\u2019s a safe place.\u201d</p><p>She pulls on her lip again. Then runs her fingers around her ear, tucking her short hair behind it. I see that her hand is trembling again.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d I take a small step forward.</p><p>\u201cYes. I\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>She doesn\u2019t sound it, but I don\u2019t press it. It\u2019s none of my business.</p><p>\u201cOkay, well if you need anything, just press reception on the phone in your room, and it\u2019ll bring you straight through to me. Goodnight, Mia.\u201d I step back, ready to leave.</p><p>Her brows knit together. \u201cHow do you know my name?\u201d</p><p>Damn, I should have called her Ms. Monroe, but something about her feels familiar like I should always be calling her Mia.</p><p>And now I sound like a stage five clinger.</p><p>Awesome.</p><p>\u201cI got it from your details when you filled the form in.\u201d I smile.</p><p>\u201cOh, right. Yes.\u201d She laughs a little sound, and it hits me straight in the chest, leaving a tingling fullness there.</p><p>What the hell?</p><p>\u201cWhat should I call you?\u201d she asks.</p><p>There are a million different ways I could answer this, none of them clean.</p><p>I lean my shoulder against the wall and push my hand into my pocket. \u201cJordan.\u201d</p><p>She turns and mirrors me, wrapping her arms around herself.</p><p>\u201cIs this your hotel, Jordan?\u201d My name sounds amazing on her lips.</p><p>I let out a laugh. \u201cNo. My dad\u2019s. He\u2019s away taking care of my Grandpa at the moment, so I\u2019m holding the fort.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, nothing serious I hope?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, just a minor op, but he\u2019s off his feet for a few weeks, so Dad\u2019s gone to take care of him.\u201d</p><p>She nods her pretty head. \u201cWell, thank you. Again.\u201d She smiles once more before disappearing into the room.</p><p>The door shuts. I hear the lock click.</p><p>I lean back against the wall.</p><p>So I have a very hot, nervous one minute, friendly the next, chick on my hands who I cannot have sex with under any circumstances.</p><p>Should be interesting.</p><p>Feeling unsatisfied ... but satisfied that my only paying guest is settled for the night, I push off the wall and head downstairs to feed my other guest.</p><p>He\u2019s actually more of a resident than a guest. Guests usually leave, but he\u2019s been a permanent fixture here for over a year now.</p><p>He makes for a great alarm system, but he\u2019s slobbery and hairy, and the only one I\u2019ve ever let sleep in my bed. He\u2019s a mouth we could do without feeding, but when he turned up at our door a starving puppy just over a year ago, I couldn\u2019t turn him away. So we kept him, and now we have a dog. A huge fucking dog.</p><p>I go to the kitchen and get his clean bowl off the drainer. I grab a can of his favorite food from the pantry and empty it into the bowl. Jesus, this stuff stinks. I mix in his biscuits just as he likes and call for him.</p><p>\u201cDozer, dinner\u2019s up.\u201d</p><p>I hear his huge paws pound against the floor as he makes his way from our private living room down the hall.</p><p>He comes barreling through the open kitchen door and straight into my legs, nearly knocking me off my feet. \u201cJesus Christ, Dozer!\u201d I growl, steadying myself on the counter. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>With a grunt he sits by the backdoor with a dopey look on his face.</p><p>\u201cBulldozer.\u201d I laugh, shaking my head.</p><p>I pick up his bowl and cross the kitchen. On the way, I grab a beer from the refrigerator.</p><p>I turn on the outside light and open the back door, letting Dozer out. I set his bowl on the step, and his nose goes straight in it.</p> <p>I sit on the step beside him and take a swig of my beer.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got a guest, Dozer, and she\u2019s hot, really hot, but flighty, so no sniffing round her as we don\u2019t want to scare her away. And your ugly mug would definitely scare her.\u201d</p><p>Dozer lifts his head, gives me a dirty look, and grunts.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I chuckle.</p><p>Then he farts.</p> <p>\u201cFuckin\u2019 hell, Dozer!\u201d I bury my nose in my arm. \u201cYou stinky bastard! I bet you did that on purpose! There\u2019s no way you\u2019re sleeping in my bed tonight after that!\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m trying not to laugh because laughing means inhaling, and that dog\u2019s farts are killer. Seriously.</p><p>Dozer shoves me hard with his head, knocking me to my side. He starts climbing on me, nudging my head with his wet snout.</p><p>\u201cGet off me, you crazy fuckin\u2019 dog!\u201d I\u2019m breathless, laughing, which means inhaling, and now I\u2019m gagging. \u201cJesus, Dozer, you stink! Okay! Okay! I take it back, you can sleep in my bed! Now get the hell off me!\u201d I shove at him.</p><p>Satisfied he\u2019s won, he climbs off me and goes back to his food.</p><p>Sitting, I pick up my beer. \u201cCrazy ass dog,\u201d I mutter, chuckling.</p> <p>I take another swig of beer, and lean back on my hand. I stretch my legs out and look up at the night sky.</p><p>Tonight is going to be a long night, knowing I\u2019ve got Sex Goddess upstairs, in one of my beds, and there\u2019s not a damn thing I can do about it. And the only person I\u2019ll be sharing a bed with tonight is Dozer and his farts \u2013 awesome.</p><p>I bet Mia sleeps in those sexy neglig\u00e9es. The see through kind. Without any underwear.</p><p>Goddamn it to hell! It\u2019s going to be a long two fucking weeks.</p><p>I\u2019m going to have to find someone else to keep me busy for the time Mia\u2019s here to ensure I keep my hands off her. Someone uncomplicated and easy. Won\u2019t be hard to find. There are always plenty of girls here vacationing with their families, bored and in need of entertainment.</p><p>The kind of entertainment I\u2019m perfect at providing.</p><p>I\u2019ll go up to Mountain Resort tomorrow and find myself a new fuck buddy.</p><p>With that thought in mind, I go inside to take a cold shower to get me through the rest of the night.</p> <p>Chapter Six</p><p>Mia</p><p>Noise. Someone is yelling.</p><p>\u201cShhh,\u201d I grumble, burying my head into the pillow.</p><p>Still yelling.</p><p>\u201cWhat in the world...?\u201d I roll over, blinking open my eyes to the dim light coming in through the drapes.</p><p>Who is yelling? It\u2019s coming from outside.</p><p>My heart pauses.</p><p>Forbes. Has he found me?</p><p>My pulse starts to thrum, setting my body on high alert.</p><p>Sitting bolt upright in bed, I listen.</p><p>It\u2019s definitely a guy\u2019s voice ... but no, it\u2019s not Forbes. I\u2019d know his voice anywhere.</p><p>I breathe a sigh of relief, laying back down.</p><p>I\u2019m figuring it must be Jordan. I wonder what he\u2019s yelling about.</p><p>Glancing over at the clock, I see it\u2019s 10am.</p><p>I reach for the glass of water on the bedside cabinet and take a sip. My throat is sore. I went hard on myself last night.</p><p>I look down at my right hand \u2013 the hand which helps me purge all of my grief and self-loathing. It\u2019s sore and itchy. I rub my finger over the calluses on my knuckles, trying to relieve the itch. They\u2019re caused by the catching of my teeth on my skin; years and years of making myself throw up have caused this scarring.</p><p>I\u2019m thinking about getting some cream from my bag to ease the itch when I hear Jordan call out again.</p><p>Curiosity gets the better of me, so I climb out of bed and pad my way over to the sliding doors, grabbing my sunglasses on the way and slipping them on.</p><p>I pull the drapes back, unlock the door, and step out onto the porch.</p><p>The first thing I see is the lake. Guess this why it\u2019s called the Lakeview room. The view is gorgeous.</p><p>Jordan yells again, so unexpected and so loud that I nearly jump out of my skin.</p><p>He\u2019s a lot closer than I realized.</p><p>With a racing heart, I approach the railing and lean over to see what he\u2019s yelling about.</p><p>My eyes find Jordan about twenty feet from the where I stand. His back is to me. He\u2019s wearing black work boots, dark blue jeans, and a short-sleeved black t-shirt that shows the defined contours of his shoulders and arms perfectly.</p><p>He lifts a hand to his hair. The muscles in his arm flex under his tattoos as he runs his fingers through the dark strands. His hair looks so soft...</p><p>An image of me running my fingers through his hair flashes through my mind. I blink myself free.</p><p>He turns a little my way, lifting his hands to his mouth, he cups them and yells, what I think is, \u201cDozer!\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverything okay?\u201d I call out.</p><p>\u201cJesus fuckin\u2019 Christ!\u201d He spins on the spot hands clenched by his sides. \u201cYou scared the shit out of me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry.\u201d I step back from the railing, but keep hold of it. My eyes are trained on his closed fists. \u201cI just, uh, heard you yelling. I wanted to make sure everything was okay.\u201d My mouth is nervous dry, so I moisten my lips with my tongue.</p><p>His eyes flicker down to his hands, then back up to me.</p><p>I see his hands relax, and he flexes his fingers out. \u201cSorry, yeah, I uh...\u201d He looks over his shoulder, then back to me. \u201cI can\u2019t find my dog.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s got a dog? I love dogs. Never had one, always wanted one.</p><p>\u201cI let him out earlier, and he\u2019s gone. He\u2019s never disappeared like this before. He never strays far from the hotel.\u201d</p><p>He sounds really worried.</p><p>\u201cYou need help looking for him?\u201d The words are out of my mouth before I have a chance to consider them.</p><p>Jordan shoves his hands in his back pockets and looks down at his boots. He seems to be contemplating my offer. So am I.</p><p>What the hell possessed me to say that?</p><p>Jesus, am I that damaged that the thought of spending a little time with this seemingly okay guy to help him find his dog is so bad to comprehend?</p><p>Yes. Yes, I absolutely am.</p><p>Freeing a hand, Jordan holds his hair back from his face, tilts his head back, and stares up at me. \u201cSure.\u201d He nods. \u201cIf you don\u2019t mind.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s not like I can retract my offer now.</p><p>\u201cOf course I don\u2019t mind.\u201d I smile, ignoring the twinge of nerves in my stomach. \u201cJust give me a minute to change and I\u2019ll be right down.\u201d</p><p>I retreat back into my room, shutting the sliding door behind me.</p><p>Standing still for a moment, I close my eyes and take in a deep, calming breath.</p><p>I can do this.</p><p>Then I open my eyes and quickly change into jeans and a t-shirt. I give my teeth a brush, slip my feet into my sneakers, run my fingers through my hair to tidy it\u2014the beauty of short hair\u2014and slip my sunglasses back on.</p><p>I quickly make my way through reception and out the main entrance. I walk around the hotel and find Jordan a little farther on.</p><p>I jog over to him. \u201cStill no luck?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He pushes his hair back, revealing his eyes.</p><p>Maple syrup. Stunning.</p><p>\u201cHe never disappears like this,\u201d he reiterates.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, we\u2019ll find him. What\u2019s his name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDozer.\u201d</p><p>Interesting name.</p><p>\u201cWhere do you want me to look?\u201d</p><p>He points to the woods before us. \u201cI\u2019ve looked everywhere else. He wouldn\u2019t normally go in there alone \u2013 he\u2019s not real big on the woods, but maybe he was chasing a rabbit or something...\u201d he trails off.</p><p>He wants me to go in there? With him.</p><p>Anxiety clamps down on my chest like a vice.</p><p>There\u2019s something about the solitude of the woods and Jordan combined that isn\u2019t sitting well with me.</p><p>Stop being a coward.</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d I swallow. \u201cThe woods it is.\u201d</p><p>We walk quietly side by side heading for the trees.</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of dog is he?\u201d I ask, trying to occupy my overactive brain.</p><p>\u201cA Mastiff\u2014Dozer!\u201d he calls out just as we break through the trees.</p><p>Copying him, I cup my hands around my mouth and call out, \u201cDozer!\u201d</p><p>My voice echoes through the trees, chasing Jordan\u2019s echo.</p><p>We both listen for a return of sound in the form of a bark, but nothing comes.</p><p>We walk on a little farther as Jordan and I continue to take turns calling for Dozer.</p><p>After a few minutes of walking and still no sign of the dog, I pick up on the sound of passing traffic.</p><p>\u201cAre we close to a road?\u201d I ask.</p><p>The look on his face \u2013 realization, then complete panic. It makes me panic.</p><p>Jordan breaks off in a sprint. I run after him, trying to keep up, but his legs are longer than mine and he\u2019s a hell of a lot faster.</p><p>I finally catch up to him close to a clearing. He\u2019s looking around, frantically calling for Dozer.</p><p>I\u2019m seriously out of breath and have a stitch. I\u2019m not the fittest of people.</p><p>Bending over, I brace my hands on my thighs as I try to catch my breath.</p><p>The sound of traffic is a lot louder up here, meaning we\u2019re really close to the road.</p><p>Holding my quickened breaths, I stand up straight, and try to focus my hearing on any sound that could be related to a dog.</p><p>Nothing.</p><p>\u201cHow about you go that way,\u201d I suggest, pointing to Jordan\u2019s right. \u201cAnd I\u2019ll go this way.\u201d I tilt my head to the left.</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d He takes a step back. \u201cJust yell out if you find him. I\u2019ll hear you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will ... and I\u2019m sure he\u2019s fine, Jordan.\u201d</p><p>He nods again, then turns, quickly walking away.</p><p>I turn, and start walking. \u201cDozer!\u201d I call out.</p><p>Another car whizzes past.</p><p>I walk on a little farther in the silence, looking around for any signs. Then I call out his name again.</p><p>That\u2019s when I hear a whimper. It\u2019s quiet, but I definitely hear something.</p><p>My heart starts to beat faster. \u201cDozer!\u201d I call out again.</p><p>A whine.</p><p>Following the sound, I move closer to the clearing ... and that\u2019s when I see him \u2013 a huge, fawn Mastiff laid over by a tree.</p><p>I run to him, yelling at the top of my lungs for Jordan, hoping to god he hears me.</p><p>I drop to my knees beside Dozer. He\u2019s panting, chest heaving up and down, his body trembling.</p><p>\u201cOh my god, your poor boy. You\u2019re gonna be okay, Dozer.\u201d I hover my hands over him, unsure whether to touch him or not. I\u2019m guessing he was hit by a car and crawled his way back here.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Mia. I\u2019ve been helping Jordan look for you. He\u2019s been really worried.\u201d</p><p>Dozer lifts his head a little. Big brown eyes stare blankly up at me.</p><p>I should check him for injuries.</p><p>\u201cOkay, Dozer, I\u2019m not a vet, but I\u2019m well on my way to becoming a doctor, and my father was a doctor, so I know what I\u2019m doing. I\u2019m gonna check you over, see what\u2019s going on with you. That okay? Not that you can answer me...\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Great, now I\u2019m rambling to a dog.</p><p>Dozer lays his head back down and closes his eyes, so I take that as a yes.</p><p>I push my sunglasses up onto my head so I can see clear to begin assessing his injuries. I don\u2019t know anything about dogs, but I\u2019m guessing they don\u2019t work much differently than people.</p><p>With care, I lay my hand on Dozer\u2019s trembling body, and that\u2019s when Jordan lands on his knees beside me.</p> <p>\u201cShit, Dozer! You okay, buddy?\u201d</p><p>Dozer grumbles a sound.</p><p>\u201cI think a car hit him,\u201d I say.</p><p>He stares at me for a long moment. Incredulity, anger and a few other emotions I can\u2019t quite grasp pass over his face.</p><p>\u201cMotherfucker!\u201d He shakes his head, roughly. \u201cWhen I find out who did this ... fuck!\u201d</p> <p>I try not to flinch at his anger.</p><p>It\u2019s not directed at you. He\u2019s right to be angry. Someone just hurt his dog.</p><p>\u201cWe need to get him to a vet,\u201d Jordan says with urgency.</p><p>But all I can focus on is the anger in his voice, and the physical tension that\u2019s vibrating off him. It\u2019s taking everything in me not to run.</p><p>I need a way to hold my calm.</p><p>So I switch into my trained mode, turn every emotion off. It\u2019s the only way I can deal.</p> <p>\u201cJust let me check him over first. See if it\u2019s safe to move him.\u201d My voice sounds robotic. I hate when I sound this way.</p><p>Ignoring Jordan\u2019s questioning stare, I run my hands over Dozer, checking for contusions, possible fractures, and internal bleeding.</p><p>Dozer yelps when my hand touches his front right leg.</p><p>I lean closer, getting a good look at the leg. There\u2019s a disjoint in the bone. Definite fracture. Possibly more than one. No blood or signs of protrusion, which is good. It means the bone hasn\u2019t broken the skin.</p><p>I haven\u2019t come across any indication of internal bleeding, so I\u2019d say this broken leg is the worst of it.</p><p>\u201cHis leg is broken,\u201d I say, resting back on my haunches. \u201cThere\u2019s some swelling around the ribcage, no cracks from what I can tell. I think he\u2019s just going to have one hell of a bruise there. I think the car must have clipped him.\u201d I glance at Jordan. His eyes are wide on my face, scrutinizing me.</p><p>Ignoring his gaze, I look back to Dozer. \u201cWe can move him, but getting him back to the hotel and to your car isn\u2019t an option. He\u2019s too big to carry that far.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can do it,\u201d Jordan asserts.</p> <p>\u201cMaybe so, but it\u2019ll be really painful for him if you do. Can you go get your car and drive it to the road just up ahead? You can move him from here to there with much less pain to him.\u201d</p><p>Jordan looks between the dog and me, his brow furrowed. \u201cYou\u2019ll stay here with him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be back in five.\u201d Jordan jumps to his feet in one swift move, and takes off running back the way we came.</p><p>\u201cNot long now, boy.\u201d I stroke Dozer\u2019s ear. \u201cJordan will get his car, and we\u2019ll get you to a vet. You\u2019ll be feeling better in no time.\u201d</p><p>Leaning forward, I take another look at Dozer\u2019s leg. I really should strap it up; it\u2019ll make it less painful for when we move him.</p><p>I glance around, looking for a suitable splint. I spot a stick at just the right length, so I crawl over and grab it.</p><p>Using my teeth, I bite and gnaw at the hem of my t-shirt. I manage to get a small tear\u2014thank you cheap material\u2014then using teeth and hands, I pull against the fabric, tearing upward. I stop a good few inches below my breasts. I secure the fabric to my chest by placing my arm under my breasts. Holding the t-shirt in place, I start to tear across.</p><p>When I\u2019m done, I have enough t-shirt to cover my breasts, and enough material to strap up Dozer\u2019s leg.</p><p>\u201cOkay, Dozer. I\u2019m going to strap your leg up with this stick, and what was my t-shirt.\u201d</p><p>Brown eyes stare up at me unhappily.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t lie to you \u2013 it\u2019s gonna hurt, but I\u2019ll be real quick, I promise.\u201d</p><p>Dozer closes his eyes and huffs out a sigh.</p><p>I don\u2019t think he\u2019ll bite me as he\u2019s in too much pain, but I\u2019m edging on the side of caution here because he\u2019s a huge frigging dog. He could take my hand off.</p><p>Carefully, I take hold of his broken leg. He growls, baring his teeth. I pause, his leg in my hand.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m helping, Dozer. Remember that before you decide to sink your teeth into me, okay?\u201d</p><p>He makes no other sound. Just huffs out a breath and his lips slacken, covering his teeth.</p><p>I take a deep breath, and try again. \u201cI\u2019m gonna have to straighten your leg a little ... you ready? Done.\u201d He growls again, and I realize it\u2019s not at me but at the pain.</p><p>\u201cWell done.\u201d I exhale. My heart is pounding solid against my ribs.</p><p>I pick up the splint and place it against the back of his leg. I grab the material, and start to wrap it around the make-shift splint, tight enough to hold his leg.</p><p>When I\u2019m done, I rip the end of it the fabric with my teeth again, giving me a tie. I wrap one side around, then fasten it with the other into a knot.</p><p>Setting his leg down, I puff out a breath. \u201cWell done, Dozer.\u201d I pat him.</p><p>A minute later, I hear the roar of an engine. Assuming it\u2019s Jordan, I get to my feet, brushing dirt and twigs from my knees.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll just be a second,\u201d I say.</p><p>I step through the clearing and into view of the road. The red Mustang from the hotel is coming toward me.</p><p>Jordan pulls to a quick stop beside me. He jumps out of the car. \u201cHow\u2019s he doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn pain, but he\u2019s doing good.\u201d I follow behind.</p><p>Jordan crouches down beside Dozer. \u201cHey boy. Gonna get you to the vet now.\u201d</p><p>He carefully slides his hands under Dozer, then in one swift move, and with minimum effort, Jordan lifts Dozer and stands with him in his arms.</p><p>Wow.</p><p>That is one huge dog. He must weigh one sixty at least.</p><p>Jordan is a lot stronger than he looks. Not that he looks wimpy because he doesn\u2019t. Nope. Not at all. Quite the opposite, in fact. He\u2019s definitely all man. He\u2019s just not muscular in a bodybuilder sense. More in an athletic, defined, toned kind of way. Well, from what I can tell through his clothes, anyway.</p><p>Jordan looks exactly how a guy should look ... says me and my vastly inexperienced knowledge of men.</p><p>The only male body I have ever known is Forbes, and he\u2019s built like a linebacker. Complete opposite to Jordan.</p><p>But I prefer Jordan\u2019s physic. It\u2019s just ... perfect.</p><p>As I stare at him, my mind wanders to fantasy...</p><p>Jordan lifting me into his arms. Me wrapping my legs around his waist. Him pressing me up against a tree, crushing his lips to mine. His hand moving lower, between my legs, touching me in just the right place...</p><p>\u201cYou coming?\u201d</p><p>Coming?</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>I look up at his face. He\u2019s staring down at me. Brow furrowed. Dozer still in his arms.</p><p>Dog. Hit. By. Car.</p><p>Going to the vets.</p><p>\u201cOh, uh, yes. Yes, I\u2019m coming. With you.\u201d</p><p>Oh god.</p><p>Way to go, Mia. Get turned on from watching the hot guy carrying his injured dog.</p><p>This is not me at all. But around Jordan, my state of normal no longer seems to exist.</p><p>Maybe that\u2019s not such a bad thing.</p><p>With embarrassment flooding my cheeks, I jog on ahead to the car.</p><p>Reaching it first, I open the passenger door, and pull the seat forward, giving Jordan access to the backseat. It\u2019s a two door car, so Jordan could have a task getting Dozer in, but he manages it with minimal fuss.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll sit in the back with him,\u201d I say, hand on the car roof, foot in the door, ready to climb in.</p><p>I see Jordan\u2019s eyes making quick work of my torn t-shirt. They settle on my face. He frowns.</p><p>My black eye. Shit.</p><p>I slide my sunglasses down covering my shame.</p><p>\u201cYou fixed his leg up.\u201d His eyes are still on my face.</p><p>\u201cI did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>Ducking my head, I climb in the backseat and sit in the small space that Dozer isn\u2019t occupying.</p><p>Jordan shifts the seat back to its place, then closes the door behind me and makes his way to the driver\u2019s side.</p><p>I put my seat belt on, then carefully lift Dozer\u2019s head and rest it on my thigh.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re gonna be just fine, Dozer.\u201d</p><p>I press my hand against his chest and begin timing his heartbeats. I want to make sure he\u2019s doing okay, but I also to keep myself busy. I need something to focus on right now.</p><p>Jordan spins the car around. I feel the quick acceleration pushing me back into the seat as he speeds us off in the direction of the vets.</p><p>Chapter Seven</p><p>Jordan</p><p>Who the fuck is this girl?</p><p>Checking Dozer over ... sounding like she knows what she\u2019s talking about ... fixing up his leg...</p><p>And that black eye.</p><p>I\u2019ve never felt as angry as I did when I saw that. And trust me, some fucker just ran my dog over, so take it that I\u2019m pretty fucking angry about her black eye.</p><p>That\u2019s the reason she\u2019s been wearing those sunglasses since she arrived. And the way she covered it up when she finally realized I\u2019d noticed it ... that bruise was no accident. Someone did that to her.</p><p>It\u2019s probably why she was so nervous around me last night. She\u2019s so tiny and sweet and kind. How anyone could ever hurt her is beyond me.</p><p>The way she took care of Dozer ... the way she\u2019s still taking care of him ... Jesus, my poor fucking dog.</p><p>When I find the bastard who did that to him, he\u2019s going to be eating through tubes\u2014just like the guy who gave Mia that black eye.</p><p>Dozer might eat way too much, and take up all the space in my bed, but he\u2019s family. I don\u2019t have much of that left nowadays. I can\u2019t lose him too.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s he doing?\u201d I ask over my shoulder.</p><p>\u201cHis breathing is a little labored.\u201d</p><p>I cast a quick glance back. \u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt means drive faster.\u201d</p><p>I slam the pedal to the metal.</p><p>A few minutes later, I\u2019m skidding to a stop outside the vets.</p><p>Jumping out of the car, I yank the seat forward and lean into the back. Mia shuffles forward and moves Dozer with her, bringing him closer to me.</p><p>I lift him into my arms.</p><p>Fucking hell. My body groans under his weight. He seems to weigh twice what he did when I picked him up back in the woods.</p><p>I shift Dozer against my chest, evening out his weight, and move as quickly as I can toward the vets. Mia is right behind me.</p><p>She overtakes and pulls open the door. I dash through.</p><p>Spotting the receptionist, I head her way. \u201cMy dog\u2019s been hit by a car \u2013 he needs help.\u201d</p><p>The receptionist rounds her desk. \u201cFollow me.\u201d</p><p>I follow quickly behind her, down a hall and into a room. A middle aged guy in a white coat is sitting at a desk working on a computer.</p><p>\u201cDr. Callie, we have a dog who has been hit by a car.\u201d</p><p>The vet glances up at us, then gets straight to his feet. \u201cPlace him on here.\u201d He points to an examination table.</p><p>Dozer flinches when I set him on the table. \u201cSorry, buddy,\u201d I whisper.</p><p>\u201cWhat is his name?\u201d Dr. Callie asks, plugging a stethoscope into his ears. He presses it to Dozer\u2019s chest. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDozer.\u201d My voice sounds rough, so I clear my throat.</p><p>\u201cI kept a check on his heart rate on the way here.\u201d</p><p>I turn at the sound of Mia\u2019s voice. I didn\u2019t even realize she was still behind me.</p><p>She keeps her focus on Dr. Callie as she speaks, \u201cIt stayed steady at sixty bpm. About five minutes ago, his breathing became a little labored. He has a chest contusion, not severe from what I could tell upon examination. And his front right leg is broken \u2013 possibly a mild fracture. I strapped it up the best I could with what I had.\u201d</p> <p>And I\u2019ll say it again \u2013 who the fuck is this girl?</p><p>She sounds confident, a little mechanical\u2014just like she did back at the woods when she was checking Dozer over. Nothing like the quiet, sweet, nervous girl who came into the hotel last night.</p><p>Dr. Callie looks up, removing the stethoscope from Dozer\u2019s chest. He takes it from his ears and hangs it around his neck. \u201cVet or doctor?\u201d he asks Mia.</p><p>I wait, suddenly very interested to hear her answer.</p><p>\u201cMed student,\u201d she answers quietly. \u201cSecond year.\u201d</p> <p>And just when I thought she couldn\u2019t possibly get any hotter...</p><p>Dr. Mia Monroe.</p><p>Yep, she just went up a million notches on the hottie counter.</p><p>I\u2019ve got doctor (Mia), patient (me), sex scenarios running through my mind on warp speed right now. All of them awesome.</p><p>Dr. Callie turns from us and walks over to a metal trolley. He picks up a syringe.</p><p>I shudder. I fucking hate needles.</p> <p>My mom was constantly being stuck with needles while she was going through treatment.</p><p>The treatment that didn\u2019t save her.</p><p>Dr. Callie walks back toward Dozer, syringe in hand. \u201cGreat job on the leg.\u201d He directs his words to Mia, then looks at us both. \u201cI\u2019m going to need you both to wait outside now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you going to stick that in Dozer?\u201d I nod at the needle in his hand.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, it\u2019s just to sedate Dozer. It won\u2019t hurt him.\u201d</p><p>Liar. Needles fucking hurt.</p><p>I take a step closer. \u201cLook, I just need to know ... is he going to be okay?\u201d My voice suddenly sounds small. I\u2019m reminded of how I sounded in the hospital when we found out the treatment hadn\u2019t worked. That mom was going to die.</p><p>A lump forms in my throat. And my eyes start to water. A dog. I\u2019m getting emotional over a fucking dog.</p> <p>I clear my throat.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s going to be fine.\u201d Dr. Callie smiles kindly.</p><p>The receptionist holds the door open for us. For the first time, I notice the name badge on her uniform \u2013 Penny.</p><p>\u201cIf you want to wait up front in the reception area, I\u2019ll come and let you know how Dozer is doing as soon as I can,\u201d Penny says.</p><p>I follow Mia to the door. Stopping, I turn back to Dr. Callie. \u201cTake good care of him.\u201d</p><p>He nods.</p><p>Penny closes the door behind us, staying in the room.</p><p>I stare at the door. My eyes start to water again.</p><p>Stop acting like a pussy, Matthews.</p><p>\u201cShall we sit?\u201d Mia says from behind me.</p><p>Pulling in a deep breath, I blink my eyes clear and turn around.</p><p>The first thing my lowered eyes make contact with is Mia\u2019s bare stomach.</p><p>Flat, soft creamy skin that is just begging to be licked. I lift my eyes, and of course, I have to check her tits out.</p><p>If she just raised her hands above her head, I\u2019d totally get a view...</p><p>Jesus Christ. What the fuck is wrong with me?</p><p>She ripped her t-shirt to help Dozer, who is currently being treated by a vet because he was hit by a car, and here I am checking her out like a sex-crazed idiot.</p><p>\u201cI owe you a t-shirt.\u201d I point to the bare skin I was just staring at.</p><p>She glances down. Her cheeks flush red, and she wraps her hands around her mid-section, covering herself. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about it. It was just a cheap Walmart shirt.\u201d</p><p>She drives a Mercedes and wears Walmart? This girl makes no sense at all.</p><p>\u201cYou sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure.\u201d</p><p>With a brisk nod, I turn and walk past her toward the reception area.</p><p>I know she\u2019s behind me, so when I reach the seats I step aside and allow her to sit first before taking the seat beside her.</p><p>See, I\u2019m not a total douche. I can be a gentleman.</p><p>I lean forward, resting my arms on my thighs. They\u2019re still aching from carrying Dozer. This move puts me real close to Mia. She smells just like she did last night\u2014vanilla.</p><p>No one should smell this good. It makes functioning difficult. Or not functioning, if you catch my drift.</p><p>I can\u2019t remember ever being this hot for a girl before. Just my fucking luck that I can\u2019t touch her.</p><p>\u201cThank you ... for what you did for Dozer,\u201d I say. I don\u2019t look at her. If I want to keep my thoughts clean, then it\u2019s a good idea to avoid as much visual contact as possible.</p><p>\u201cNo problem.\u201d</p><p>Her voice is so soft, just as I imagine her skin feels. Soft and warm, and I bet she\u2019s really tight...</p><p>\u201cI like dogs,\u201d she adds. \u201cAll animals, in fact. They\u2019re a whole lot nicer than people.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s a sudden sadness to her voice, and I can\u2019t help but look at her.</p><p>Her lips are downturn, and I notice she\u2019s still wearing those god-awful sunglasses.</p><p>\u201cYou can take the sunglasses off, you know. There\u2019s only us here, and I\u2019ve already seen what you\u2019re hiding behind them.\u201d</p><p>Her whole body stiffens.</p><p>There\u2019s a long pause where she does absolutely nothing. I\u2019m not actually sure that she\u2019s still breathing. I wonder if I\u2019ve said the wrong thing. Gone about this the wrong way?</p><p>I don\u2019t want to upset her.</p><p>Why? I\u2019m not actually sure. It\u2019s not like I\u2019m usually concerned with a woman\u2019s emotional goings on. But with her, something is just ... different.</p><p>She lifts her hand to her face and slowly slides the sunglasses off.</p><p>I watch her slender fingers tremble as she turns the arms of the sunglasses in and sets them on her lap, hands covering them.</p><p>Then I notice that she has these sore looking calluses on the knuckle of her right hand. I notice them because they look out of place with the rest of her soft, flawless skin.</p><p>Maybe she has eczema or something.</p><p>I lift my eyes to her face.</p><p>Her eyes are closed. The bruise so very evident.</p><p>Anger pulses inside me again, so fucking fierce that I could punch a hole in the wall and still not feel clear.</p><p>I clench my hands in my lap. \u201cThe asshole that did that to you...?\u201d</p><p>She bites her lip and looks away.</p><p>The caveman inside me is beating his chest right now, ready to beat the shit out of the asshole that did this to her. No woman should ever go through that. Especially not her. Definitely not her.</p><p>\u201cI can hurt him, Mia. Just say the word and it\u2019s done.\u201d</p><p>I hear her sharp intake of breath. Wide, blue eyes meet mine.</p><p>Jesus, she\u2019s breathtaking. Even with the black eye.</p><p>Her eyes are as stunning as I knew they would be. They\u2019re the color of the water of a caldera.</p><p>After high school, I went traveling with some buddies\u2014it was before my mom got sick, and I had to come back home. We were in Lombok, an island in Indonesia, and we had trekked out to Mount Rinjani. There was a caldera there. The water stays hot permanently, due to the volcanic activity, and is so purely blue. All filtering shades rippling together to make the most amazing shade of blue you will ever see.</p><p>Mia\u2019s eyes are the exact shade of blue as that water.</p><p>Breaking our stare, she begins examining the sunglasses in hand with her eyes and fingers as if her life depends on it.</p><p>I don\u2019t think she\u2019s going to say anything, and I have no clue what else to say.</p><p>\u201cNo one did this to me. It was just an accident.\u201d</p><p>Her words are softly spoken, but I feel like they\u2019ve just punched me in my chest.</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cPeople don\u2019t hide accidents like you\u2019re hiding that black eye. And the very fact you said it was an accident just confirms to me that someone did this to you.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes snap up to mine. There\u2019s an unexpected fire in them. I like it. Means there is some fight in her.</p><p>\u201cSo what if someone hurt me. What business is it of yours?\u201d</p><p>Wow, that stung. Why did that sting?</p><p>I grit my teeth and lean back in my seat. \u201cYou\u2019re right. It\u2019s not my business.\u201d</p><p>Her anger instantly disappears. So quick, it surprises me.</p><p>\u201cGod, I\u2019m so sorry. That sounded\u2014I don\u2019t\u2014\u201d She shifts in her seat, her fingers pulling on that plump lower lip. \u201cI don\u2019t mean to come off like a bitch. I really appreciate your offer, but hurting ... him ... it\u2019s not necessary.\u201d</p><p>I turn my head and stare her straight in the eyes. \u201cIt looks necessary from where I\u2019m sitting.\u201d</p><p>Her hand drops back to her lap. \u201cViolence never solves violence.\u201d</p><p>This asshole blacks her eye, yet she thinks that way. She\u2019s either a fucking angel, or really stupid. From what I\u2019ve already seen of her, I\u2019m going with angel. I hope she doesn\u2019t prove me wrong on this.</p><p>\u201cMaybe not.\u201d I notice her eyes are on my mouth, so I swipe my lower lip with my tongue. \u201cBut trust me, it\u2019s the only language that scum, like the bastard who did that to you, understand. And it\u2019d make me feel a whole lot better knowing that me teaching him some manners would mean he\u2019d keep his fuckin\u2019 hands off you.\u201d</p><p>Seriously, once I was done with him, he wouldn\u2019t even breathe in her direction again. I want to hurt this asshole badly. About as badly as I want to be situated between her thighs.</p><p>Why? I barely know this girl. Is it because I want to fuck her more than I\u2019ve ever wanted to fuck anyone before.</p><p>No, it\u2019s not that. So what the hell is it?</p><p>I glance at her, and see that her eyes have filled with tears.</p><p>Shit, don\u2019t cry. I don\u2019t do crying chicks.</p><p>\u201cLook,\u201d I start to speak quickly to stave off her tears, \u201cI\u2019m just saying that if you want me to hurt him, I will. Call it my way of paying you back for taking care of Dozer. If you don\u2019t, you don\u2019t. No big deal.\u201d</p><p>Biting her lip, she nods. A tear falls from her long lashes, splashing onto her jeans.</p><p>My chest starts to feel tight. What the fuck is that?</p><p>I look away, giving her privacy as she swipes her fingers under her eyes to dry them.</p><p>And also so I can rub this fucking ache out of my chest.</p><p>\u201cMia, I just want you to know that not all men are assholes.\u201d</p><p>What. The. Fuck?</p><p>Not all men are assholes? Jesus Christ, Matthews. Yes, we are. There are just varying degrees of male assholeness.</p><p>I\u2019m an asshole. One who would never raise his hand to a woman, and I fucking abhor men that do. But I have absolutely no problem in hooking up with a chick, then walking away from her the second my cock is out of her.</p><p>Case in point \u2013 whatsername from yesterday. See, I can\u2019t even remember her name. That\u2019s how big an asshole I am.</p><p>Weird thing is ... I don\u2019t want Mia to think I\u2019m an asshole. I want her to like me.</p><p>It\u2019s the whole damsel in distress thing. Has to be. And the way she took care of Dozer before, so gentle with him. Frigging amazing. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>It\u2019s doing fucked up things to me.</p><p>I risk a glance and her wide, glistening, bright blue eyes are blinking back at me. Long lashes bat against her cheekbones.</p><p>Jesus, she\u2019s beautiful.</p><p>She licks her lips and presses them together. My eyes fall to them.</p> <p>I want to kiss them.</p><p>Her.</p><p>Everywhere.</p><p>Run my tongue over every inch of her silky soft skin.</p><p>I bet she tastes like vanilla. Tastes exactly like she smells.</p> <p>I want to spread her legs and bury my head between her thighs. Lick her until she screams my name. Then push my cock deep inside and fuck her until we both lose our goddamn minds from the pleasure.</p><p>I might not have test driven her yet, but I just know that sex with Mia Monroe would be that good. I have a sense for these things.</p><p>Yes, I know it\u2019s totally inappropriate for me to want this at this exact moment, but people look for comfort in difficult situations, right?</p><p>And Dozer would understand. That dog is as horny as I am. He\u2019s just about dry humped every piece of furniture we own. I once caught him going at it with the wooden table in the garden. Poor bastard was so desperate to get off that he risked splinters. I really should get him laid.</p><p>Holy shit. Dozer\u2019s a virgin.</p><p>Now that\u2019s just not right.</p> <p>I swear to God right here and now \u2013 get Dozer through this and I promise the first thing I\u2019ll do is hook him up with the hottest dog I can find. Not that I know anything about hot dogs ... yeah, I caught that, I\u2019m as funny as I am good-looking. But I think a fancy dog like a poodle or something would work for Dozer.</p><p>\u201cSo, Jordan...\u201d I seriously dig the way she says my name. \u201cDozer is an unusual name for a dog. Where did that come from? He sleep a lot?\u201d Her lips work on a smile, and my dick pulses in response.</p><p>She\u2019s after a subject change, and I can go with that. I let out a laugh and look away before I do something stupid like pull a Dozer and try to dry hump her leg.</p><p>\u201cYeah, he sleeps tons, but that\u2019s not where it came from. Dozer was a stray. Found him at our door one night when he was a puppy. He was starving, so we took him in and fed him. We put out fliers, but no one claimed him, so we kept him. In the first week he stayed with us, he broke a shit load of stuff\u2014ornaments, plates, glasses, even a window.\u201d</p><p>I laugh again, remembering how pissed my dad was when Dozer jumped head first at the living room window trying to get at a bird on the porch. Shattered the window.</p><p>\u201cBasically, Dozer broke everything he touched, and my dad said he was like a bulldozer taking down everything in his path, and it just kinda stuck. Ended up being shortened to Dozer, because he can be a little dozy at times.\u201d I smile, then I glance in the direction of the hall. \u201cI\u2019ve just always thought of him as invincible, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s going to be fine, Jordan. It\u2019s just a broken leg\u2014well, not just a broken leg, because broken legs are incredibly painful, I just meant\u2014\u201d</p><p>Her face has gone red. She\u2019s flustered. Cute.</p> <p>\u201cI know what you meant.\u201d I smile.</p><p>A small smile touches her lips. \u201cAside from his leg, I really don\u2019t think there is anything else to worry about.\u201d She touches my arm with her fingers. It\u2019s a gentle touch, almost imperceptible. But even still, my blood turns to molten fucking lava at the contact.</p><p>She withdraws her hand. A look of surprise on her face.</p><p>You\u2019re surprised, sweetheart? Well, you\u2019re not the only one.</p><p>With the hot lava flooding straight to the main man, I talk to distract myself from my impending boner. \u201cSo you\u2019re a doctor,\u201d I say, just remembering that. How the fuck did I forget that?</p><p>Hell, she\u2019s a living, breathing wet dream.</p><p>\u201cTraining to be,\u201d she says quietly.</p><p>\u201cWhere?\u201d</p><p>She slides me a glance. \u201cHarvard.\u201d</p><p>Harvard. She\u2019s beautiful and incredibly smart.</p><p>There\u2019s isn\u2019t anything that\u2019s less than perfect about her. Except for the douchehole of an ex.</p><p>\u201cIvy League \u2013 nice.\u201d I nod, impressed.</p><p>She shrugs her shoulders in response and looks to the floor, kicking her sneakers together.</p><p>So, she\u2019s from Boston. Interesting. I don\u2019t remember seeing that on the form she filled out last night, but then I was too busy eye-fucking her to notice where she was from.</p><p>What\u2019s she doing way out here then? I\u2019d say vacation, but women rarely vacation alone, and they always take pre-planned trips. Turning up at Golden Oaks like she did ... this was an unplanned trip. And I\u2019m guessing it had something to do with the asshole who marred that perfect face.</p><p>\u201cSo, are you originally from Boston?\u201d</p><p>I see her hesitation. Her whole body has stiffened again.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she says on a breath. \u201cLived there my whole life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat you doing way out here in Colorado?\u201d</p><p>She shifts in her seat, tilting her body away from me. \u201cI\u2019m trying to, um...\u201d She clears her throat. \u201cI\u2019m here to find my mother.\u201d</p><p>Didn\u2019t expect that.</p><p>\u201cYou adopted?\u201d</p><p>Did I mention I have no filter?</p><p>She shakes her head. \u201cNo, my father\u2014I lived with my father. My mother left when I was a baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit,\u201d I say. \u201cSo your dad ... he\u2019s okay about you been out here alone searching for your mom?\u201d And why hasn\u2019t he kicked the cocksucker\u2019s ass who hurt her?</p><p>\u201cMy father is dead.\u201d</p><p>Shit. Guess that answers my questions. But what surprises me is the lack of emotion in her voice about her dad being dead.</p><p>Losing my mom was horrendous\u2014beyond horrendous. I adored my mom. If I lost my dad ... well, my world would implode.</p><p>\u201cSorry to hear that.\u201d It\u2019s a crap thing to say, but really what else is there to say.</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d Emotionless again. Weird.</p><p>I twist in my seat to her. \u201cSo your mom lives here?\u201d</p><p>She brushes her golden hair from her eyes. \u201cApparently so. I have an address, but it was from over twenty years ago. Whether she still lives there or not, I\u2019m not sure.\u201d</p><p>I nod in agreement. \u201cWhat\u2019s your mom\u2019s name? I\u2019ve lived here my whole life. If she\u2019s still here, I might know her. If not, my dad will. He used to be a cop. He knows everyone.\u201d</p><p>She sucks her top lip into her mouth. An image of me doing exactly the same plays a scene in my head.</p><p>\u201cAnna Monroe. Well, that was her married name. I don\u2019t know her maiden name.\u201d</p><p>I rake through my brain for an Anna. The only person I can think of is Annie Parker, and she\u2019s only a few years older than me. Has a mouth like a vacuum cleaner. Good memories.</p><p>\u201cSorry.\u201d I shake my head.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201d Her smile is sad.</p><p>\u201cHey, how about I look up the address on my phone? See if she still lives there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you? I never thought to do that. Thank you.\u201d She reaches into her bag and pulls out a ratty piece of paper, then hands it to me.</p><p>I get my cell from my pocket and type the address and the name Anna Monroe into the search engine.</p><p>What comes up makes my heart drop for Mia. I almost don\u2019t want to tell her.</p><p>\u201cAnything?\u201d God, she sounds so hopeful.</p><p>I glance up at her. \u201cThe address you have for your mom is now home to a grocery store.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>Jesus, I can literally feel her disappointment like it\u2019s my own.</p><p>My chest feels tight again. Seriously, what the fuck is that? I rub at my sternum with my fingers.</p><p>\u201cThe houses must have been leveled for the store to be built,\u201d I say. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be. It\u2019s not your fault.\u201d She takes the piece of paper from me and holds it in her hand.</p><p>She smiles, but it\u2019s forced.</p><p>She looks so lost. So sad. It\u2019s painful to see.</p><p>\u201cI can help you find your mom, if you want?\u201d</p><p>What the fuck! Have I lost my mind?</p><p>I don\u2019t spend time with girls outside the bedroom. Apart from Beth, and that\u2019s only because she plays for the same team as I do.</p><p>If I spend time with Mia, I know what will happen. And I can\u2019t get balls deep with her.</p><p>Yes, I might have spent the last five minutes imagining her flat on her back, and me pounding into her like a jackhammer, but I\u2019m not a complete bastard.</p><p>I may not know the full story, but it\u2019s clear this girl has been through the wringer with the asshole who gave her the black eye, and now she\u2019s searching for her mother. The mother who abandoned her when she was a baby.</p><p>Mia might be the hottest girl I have ever seen ... okay, she is the hottest girl I have ever seen in life, and the sweetest. And I\u2019m so horny for her that my dick actually hurts. It motherfucking hurts.</p><p>But the girl\u2019s got enough to deal with.</p><p>And me spending an invariable amount of time around a hot girl that I cannot put my dick inside ... it\u2019s just not possible.</p><p>I might as well be in prison.</p><p>Or hell.</p><p>That\u2019s it, I\u2019m in hell.</p><p>This is payback for the chick I banged who was married.</p><p>Okay, I lied before. I totally knew she was married when I tapped that.</p><p>\u201cWould you?\u201d She sounds hopeful. \u201cI mean, I wouldn\u2019t know where to start, and you know the people in this town, so you\u2019d know who to speak to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure I will.\u201d That\u2019s it. Keep talking dickhead. Keep digging that hole deeper. \u201cLike I said, I owe you for what you did for Dozer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t owe me anything, Jordan. I wanted to help you.\u201d</p><p>She said my name again. I\u2019m toast.</p><p>\u201cAnd I want to help you.\u201d</p><p>And I want to help you. Jesus, I\u2019m such a lame ass pussy.</p><p>It\u2019s official. I\u2019ve lost my fucking mind.</p><p>Then she smiles. It\u2019s wide and bright and dazzling, and like a sucker punch to the chest. And ball sack.</p><p>My life has just got seriously hard.</p><p>Kind of like the permanent state of my cock while around Mia Monroe.</p><p>Chapter Eight</p><p>Mia</p><p>I can\u2019t believe what has just happened.</p><p>I just admitted to Jordan\u2014a guy who I barely know\u2014that Forbes hit me. And I also told him about my mother. The mother who abandoned me. The mother who I drove across seven states to try and find and she doesn\u2019t even live at the address I have anymore.</p><p>I\u2019m so stupid.</p><p>Why didn\u2019t I check this before I drove across the country in a lame attempt to find her?</p><p>But what was I going to do? Go back to my apartment and make threesome with Forbes?</p><p>I don\u2019t think so.</p><p>Jordan must think I\u2019m a real mess. And an idiot.</p><p>He\u2019d be right on both counts.</p><p>I think it\u2019s best if I just get out of here. I\u2019ll go back to the hotel, grab my things and go ... where?</p><p>I\u2019ll just find another hotel, and then I can figure out my next move.</p><p>I just hope he doesn\u2019t tell anyone what he already knows about Forbes hitting me. Why would he? He doesn\u2019t exactly seem like the gossipy type. But then he did say his dad used to be a cop. What if...?</p><p>No, I would have to report it myself, and I don\u2019t really think the local police force are going to be concerned with a stranger in town who happens to have a black eye. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>But I do need to leave. Right now.</p><p>I\u2019m just about to get to my feet, make my excuses and run the hell out of here, when he says, \u201cI can help you find your mom, if you want?\u201d</p><p>What? He wants to help me find my mother?</p><p>A few minutes ago, he offered to kick the crap out of Forbes, which practically floored me, and made me teary. No one has ever offered help like that to me before. And for help to come from a man makes it even more astounding, and poignant.</p> <p>And now this...</p><p>Help me find my mother...</p><p>It\u2019s beyond kind.</p><p>He would be giving up his time to help me. Why would he do that?</p><p>Maybe because he really is a good guy, Mia.</p> <p>I can feel myself starting to choke up with his kindness, so I hold my voice as steady as I can. \u201cWould you?\u201d I can\u2019t help the hope in my voice. \u201cI mean, I wouldn\u2019t know where to start, and you know the people in this town, so you\u2019d know who to speak to.\u201d</p><p>And now I\u2019m babbling. Great.</p><p>\u201cSure I will,\u201d he says. \u201cLike I said, I owe you for what you did for Dozer.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s helping me because I helped him. Even then, is that such a bad thing? It doesn\u2019t make him a bad guy.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t owe me anything, Jordan. I wanted to help you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I want to help you,\u201d he says. His voice sounds so warm and wonderful that I can\u2019t help the goofy smile that spreads across my face.</p> <p>\u201cThen thank you. I would love to take you up on your offer to help me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d He smiles.</p><p>He\u2019s so lovely.</p><p>And so good-looking.</p><p>I suddenly have the urge to reach out and touch his face.</p><p>I clamp my fingers together, pinning my hands to my lap.</p><p>We\u2019re silent for a moment before Jordan speaks.</p><p>\u201cI wonder how much longer they\u2019re going to be with Dozer?\u201d</p> <p>I glance at the clock like that\u2019s going to help. \u201cI\u2019m sure they won\u2019t be much longer. They\u2019re probably x-raying his leg for the break, and I imagine his chest as well to make sure none of his ribs are broken.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s smiling at me.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I say, a little self-conscious.</p><p>\u201cNothing.\u201d He shakes his head. \u201cYou just sound really different when you\u2019re talking doctor stuff. You sound like...\u201d</p><p>\u201cA doctor?\u201d I grin.</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d He laughs. \u201cA doctor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m not quite there yet ... if ever,\u201d I add quietly.</p><p>\u201cAnd why\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>I glance across at him, unsure what to say, or why I even said what I just did. Then Jordan\u2019s eyes lift, looking over my head. They quickly flick back down to mine, then lower to my sunglasses. I hear footsteps heading our way, so I lift the glasses and slide them on as I mouth a silent thank you to Jordan.</p><p>He nods lightly, then gets to his feet, as do I.</p><p>\u201cHow he is?\u201d Jordan asks Dr. Callie.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s doing really well. He\u2019s still asleep under anesthetic, but he\u2019ll come round soon. His leg is broken, like you diagnosed.\u201d He directs his gaze at me, then back to Jordan. \u201cThe problem was the bone was fractured in two places, so I had to set it with pins to get the break to heal straight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut he\u2019s okay?\u201d Jordan asks, concern lacing his voice. It tugs at my heart.</p><p>Dr. Callie smiles. \u201cHe\u2019s fine. I\u2019ve set the leg in a cast. He\u2019ll need to rest it up and come back in about six weeks to have the pins removed. But he\u2019s going to be back to himself in no time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen can I take him home?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s in recovery at the moment. I want to keep him here for the rest of the day just to keep an eye on him. You can come back later today to collect him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat time?\u201d</p><p>Dr. Callie looks at his watch. \u201cSay, four thirty, and he should be fine to go.\u201d</p><p>Penny comes over to us. \u201cIf you could come with me, I just need to take a few details from you,\u201d she addresses Jordan.</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d he says.</p><p>I\u2019m just about to follow Jordan to the reception desk, when Dr. Callie stops me. \u201cGreat assessment you did earlier. The strap on his leg was really good work. You\u2019re going to make a fine doctor.\u201d His smile is genuine. Shame I don\u2019t feel it.</p><p>I don\u2019t want to become a good doctor. I don\u2019t want to be what Oliver created.</p><p>I dip my gaze. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell ... best of luck with the rest of medical school.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d I nod.</p><p>\u201cRight. I better get back to it.\u201d</p><p>I watch his retreating back, then I turn to Jordan and walk over. He\u2019s just finishing up.</p><p>\u201cReady?\u201d he asks.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>I follow him out to his car. \u201cYou hungry?\u201d he asks once we\u2019re in the car.</p><p>I touch my hand to my empty stomach. \u201cA little.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo be expected. You did miss breakfast.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry about that. I don\u2019t usually sleep so late, but I was really tired. I hope you didn\u2019t go to any trouble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah.\u201d He shakes his head. \u201cLet\u2019s go grab some lunch.\u201d</p><p>He pulls away from the vets, onto the street, then starts fiddling with the radio.</p><p>I slip my sunglass off and glance around the car, taking it in. I\u2019ve never been inside a Mustang before today. It\u2019s a really nice car. Pretty cool. I know I said yesterday that it\u2019s a penis enhancer, but knowing Jordan now, I really don\u2019t think he would need any help in the enhancing department. Not that I\u2019ve seen anything to know, but he\u2019s just so confident and this car suits that about him. It reflects his confidence and charm.</p><p>\u201cThis is a really nice car,\u201d I comment.</p><p>Settling on a station, he rests his hand back on the wheel. \u201cThanks. I won it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWon it? Like on a car lottery or something?\u201d I tease.</p><p>Jordan lets out a laugh. \u201cNo, cards. I won it in a hand of poker.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow. That must\u2019ve been some hand,\u201d I say impressed.</p><p>Taking his right hand off the wheel, he flexes his fingers out between us. A grin akin to the devil appears on his lips. \u201cOh, you have no idea, babe.\u201d</p><p>Babe? Holy shit. Is he...?</p><p>Did he just flirt with me?</p><p>No. No way.</p><p>Even still, my cheeks heat.</p><p>Pretending his words have absolutely no effect on me, I clear my throat. \u201cYou like to play cards?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI used to.\u201d There\u2019s something off about his tone. It instantly makes me curious.</p><p>I\u2019m not usually nosy. I don\u2019t ask people things because I don\u2019t want them to question me in return. But he knows about Forbes, and something about Jordan makes me want to know more about him. I feel like I could sit and listen to him talk for hours, and not once get bored.</p><p>\u201cUsed to?\u201d I question.</p><p>I watch his fingers tap restlessly against the steering wheel. \u201cI used to gamble a bit. I liked to play cards. After my mom died it, uh ... it got a little worse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour mom died.\u201d I press my hand to my chest. \u201cGod, I\u2019m so sorry, Jordan.\u201d</p><p>He bobs his head. \u201cWe\u2019ve both lost a parent. Guess we have that in common.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSucky thing to have in common,\u201d I say.</p><p>Well, it\u2019s not like I can tell him the day Oliver died was the best day of my life.</p><p>He would never understand.</p><p>\u201cYeah it is,\u201d he says quietly.</p><p>\u201cHow did she die? If you don\u2019t mind my asking?\u201d</p><p>He shakes his head, eyes fixed ahead. \u201cLung cancer. Stage four. Never smoked a day in her life. I was away, traveling with some buddies out in South East Asia, when I got the call from Dad that she was sick. I came straight home. She had surgery ... chemo ... it didn\u2019t work.\u201d</p><p>His shoulders lift on a heavy sigh. \u201cAfter she died I, uh ... well, life got a little hard. Crazy, you know?\u201d</p><p>A glance. I catch the sad in his eyes before he looks back ahead to the road. \u201cThen I had a wakeup call, and I cleaned up my act. And here you see, the brand new, almost responsible me.\u201d He sweeps a hand down himself, smiling, but I can tell it\u2019s forced.</p><p>And that\u2019s when I see the broken in him. Not broken the way I am, but there\u2019s definitely something. He looks as if he\u2019s carrying a heavy burden of guilt over his mom.</p><p>I twist in my seat so that I\u2019m looking at him. \u201cWell, I didn\u2019t know the before you Jordan, but this Jordan is incredibly kind.\u201d</p><p>He laughs, but it\u2019s more of a scoff. Self-deprecating.</p><p>\u201cYeah, kind. That\u2019s me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you are. And well, uh, that counts. To me.\u201d I pull on my lip, taking a deep breath.</p><p>He glances across at me again, and our eyes more than meet. They connect.</p><p>My skin flushes. My mouth dries. Heartbeat erratic.</p><p>I have the sudden and very pressing urge to lean over and kiss him.</p><p>Breaking his gaze, I turn face front and start picking at imaginary lint on my jeans. We don\u2019t speak again until we pull up outside the diner.</p><p>I put my sunglasses on and get out of the car.</p><p>\u201cI ate here last night,\u201d I comment over my shoulder.</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>I whip around, and my muscles lock with tension. \u201cHow do you know that?\u201d I know my voice is sharp, but I can\u2019t help it.</p><p>He frowns a little. Resting his hand on the roof of the car, he says, \u201cBeth, the waitress who served you last night, she\u2019s a good friend of mine. She called ahead to let me know you were coming.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, right.\u201d Way to overreact Mia.</p><p>Running my hand through my hair, I laugh, but it sounds off. \u201cMakes sense why she recommended your hotel then, being your friend an\u2019 all. Of course she would. Not that it\u2019s a trashy hotel or anything because it\u2019s not. It\u2019s great. The best hotel I\u2019ve ever stayed in.\u201d</p><p>Jesus Christ. Stop talking. Now.</p><p>I really need gagging while I\u2019m around him.</p><p>Jordan chuckles. He makes his way around the car toward me, with what looks to be a plaid shirt in his hand.</p><p>\u201cThought you might want to wear this.\u201d He nods toward my bare stomach.</p><p>God, I can\u2019t believe I forgot that my t-shirt was all torn up. Not like me at all. I\u2019m usually very aware of my state of dress. I had to be because of my father.</p><p>And Forbes.</p><p>I immediately cover my mid-riff with my arms. Then free one to take the shirt that he\u2019s now holding out to me.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d I say, pulling the shirt on. It smells masculine. Woodsy. It smells of him. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever want to take this shirt off again.</p><p>Stepping close, he pulls the shirt together and starts to do up the buttons. \u201cI don\u2019t want people to think I\u2019ve mauled you,\u201d he says low, with a smile.</p><p>I feel it in every single part of me.</p><p>I can\u2019t move. I\u2019m just staring at him, watching his eyes trace each button up as he does them, while reminding myself to breath.</p><p>Deftly, he soon reaches the top. His eyes lift to mine.</p><p>I try not to notice that his breathing has ratcheted up a little, like my own has. Or that his hand is lingering on the shirt, close to my chest, even though the buttons are all done.</p><p>I gulp. \u201cThanks,\u201d I whisper, my voice breaking on the word. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>With a nod, he steps back from me. \u201cCome on, let\u2019s get you fed.\u201d</p><p>Pulse galloping, I follow Jordan into the diner. He doesn\u2019t wait to be seated, just bypasses the empty hostess station, so I follow behind, still feeling a little off balance from the whole buttoning of the shirt.</p><p>He motions for me to sit first, so I slide into the booth. Jordan sits opposite me.</p><p>I see Beth walking toward us. She looks between me and Jordan. A frown mars her pretty face.</p> <p>She doesn\u2019t look happy to see him here with me, and I start to wonder if they\u2019re more than just friends. I also don\u2019t like how the thought of them together is making me feel.</p><p>Jealous.</p><p>Uneasy.</p><p>Jealous.</p><p>\u201cHey you.\u201d She ruffles his hair.</p> <p>\u201cWatch the hair!\u201d He bats her hand away, laughing.</p><p>She gives his shoulder a shove. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, you still look pretty.\u201d Her eyes dart to me, then back to him.</p><p>\u201cBeth, how many times do I have to tell you that men are not pretty. We\u2019re hot. Gorgeous. Fuckin\u2019 awesome. But not pretty.\u201d</p><p>Looking at me, she rolls her eyes. I can\u2019t help but laugh.</p><p>Jordan grins at me.</p><p>I feel that as well. Mainly in my southern region.</p> <p>\u201cBeth, you\u2019ve already met Mia.\u201d He gestures to me.</p><p>\u201cI have.\u201d She smiles. It appears genuine which helps a little with my concern.</p><p>\u201cThanks again for the hotel recommendation,\u201d I say.</p><p>She looks at Jordan again, but he\u2019s looking at me. Her eyes come back to me. And I notice curiosity and possibly a little humor in them.</p><p>It makes me curious.</p><p>\u201cNo probs.\u201d She smiles again. \u201cI didn\u2019t expect to see you in here today,\u201d she says to Jordan.</p><p>His face shifts to a sullen expression. \u201cSome fucknut hit Dozer with their car.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my god!\u201d She claps her hand over her mouth. Sitting down next to Jordan, she forces him to shift over. \u201cIs he okay?\u201d</p> <p>Jordan nods in my direction. \u201cThanks to Mia he is.\u201d</p><p>I can feel my cheeks heating. \u201cI didn\u2019t do anything, not really.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you did.\u201d He gives me a look, before turning to Beth. \u201cShe checked him over for injuries and saw that his leg was broken, so she tore up her shirt and strapped up his leg. Mia\u2019s training to be a doctor,\u201d he informs her.</p><p>\u201cWow,\u201d Beth says, looking at me.</p><p>I shift uneasily in my seat. I\u2019m not really comfortable with this conversation or attention. I don\u2019t like the focus being on me.</p><p>\u201cGuess that explains why you\u2019re wearing one of Jordan\u2019s shirts,\u201d she adds with a grin.</p><p>My face instantly fires. \u201cOh, yes.\u201d I look down at it, fidgeting with the buttons and trying to hide my face.</p><p>\u201cWe good to get some food? Mia hasn\u2019t eaten anything since last night,\u201d Jordan says, changing the subject. I\u2019m guessing he can sense my discomfort at the whole shirt conversation. \u201cShe missed breakfast helping with Dozer, so I brought her out for lunch while I wait to go pick him up.\u201d</p><p>She nods. \u201cAbsolutely. So Dozer\u2019s gonna be okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. He\u2019s gonna be fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d She pats his shoulder and gets to her feet. \u201cLet me get you both something to eat. Sounds like y\u2019all need it. Your usual, Jordan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMia, what can I get you?\u201d She looks at me.</p><p>I grab the menu off the table and quickly scan it. \u201cI\u2019ll have a chicken salad sandwich and a diet coke, please.\u201d</p><p>She smiles. \u201cCool. Won\u2019t be long.\u201d</p><p>I watch her walk away to the kitchen. Jordan shifts across the bench, so he\u2019s back opposite me, putting him directly in my eye line.</p><p>He rests his hands on the table, tilting his head, and stares at me. It\u2019s then I realize I\u2019m pulling on my lip again. I set my hands in my lap.</p><p>\u201cYou do that when you\u2019re nervous.\u201d It\u2019s not a question.</p><p>I nod.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re nervous now. Why?\u201d</p><p>I lift my shoulders, looking anywhere but him. \u201cI\u2019m not really sure.\u201d</p><p>He leans forward, clasping his hands together. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to be nervous around me, Mia.\u201d</p><p>I meet his warm gaze. \u201cI know.\u201d I nod.</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d He smiles and relaxes back. \u201cI\u2019ve been thinking about finding your mom, and how to go about it.\u201d He picks up a pack of sugar from the holder and starts playing with it. \u201cI thought we\u2019d be best starting with the basics like Google, White Pages, Public Records, that kind of thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds like a good plan.\u201d</p><p>Of course it does. Any plan would sound good to me because I have no clue how to search for my absent mother.</p><p>Putting the sugar down, he pulls his cell from his pocket. \u201cOkay, let\u2019s get started.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow?\u201d My gaze snaps up to his.</p><p>\u201cNo time like the present ... unless you\u2019d rather I wait?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Now is fine.\u201d I force a smile, knowing how stilted my voice sounds.</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure.\u201d I\u2019m pretty certain my voice sounds harsher than I mean it to. I\u2019m just afraid. I want to find my mother, but fear of the unknown is suddenly clouding that.</p><p>Jordan looks at me with confused sympathy on his face.</p><p>I look at him until I can no longer bear it. I hate sympathy.</p><p>Turning my face, I stare out of the window.</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d He exhales. \u201cI\u2019ll start with public records.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d I mumble. My hands feel fidgety, so I wrap them around my stomach, which is turning over.</p><p>I can feel myself coming undone.</p><p>\u201cWhat was your mom\u2019s name again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnna Monroe.\u201d</p><p>More typing from him. More fear and panic from me.</p><p>I don\u2019t think I\u2019m ready for this. My legs are itching to take me out of here.</p><p>I need to leave. I need food. I need to be alone.</p><p>Jordan exhales a loud breath, bringing my attention to him. His brow is all scrunched up in thought. He looks really adorable. And suddenly all of my attention is on him.</p><p>\u201cI checked your mom\u2019s name against Colorado and New Mexico with us been so close to there, I thought it worth a try, and it\u2019s brought up ten Anna Monroe\u2019s. None in Durango. But three are in neighboring towns. One in Montrose. One in Gunnington. And the other in Farmington, New Mexico which is only an hour away. So I think they are the best to start with.\u201d</p><p>He places his phone down on the table and runs his hand through his hair, meeting my eyes, which are fixed on him.</p><p>Seeing the warmth in his maple eyes sets my heart beating like a kick drum.</p><p>\u201cWe can download the full reports on them, addresses and the like. I\u2019ll do it when we get back to the hotel.\u201d</p><p>I like how he thinks of things I wouldn\u2019t. I would never have thought to check New Mexico.</p><p>Fear aside, I\u2019m so glad he\u2019s helping me. I think I\u2019ll locate her much quicker with his help.</p><p>\u201cThank you for doing this for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeriously, stop thanking me. I only do things because I want to. And I want to help you, okay?\u201d</p><p>No one has ever spoken to me or treated me like he does. Like I\u2019m a person who matters. That I count for something.</p><p>It makes my heart feel warm and alive in a way it never has before.</p><p>I\u2019ve known Jordan for such a short time, but that time just feels irrelevant when I\u2019m sitting here with him.</p><p>It\u2019s scary. But a good scary.</p><p>I like it. I like him.</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d I smile.</p><p>Chapter Nine</p><p>Jordan</p><p>I told Mia that I\u2019m cleaned up from the person I used to be. That I\u2019m responsible now. Yeah, right. I don\u2019t gamble anymore, but...</p><p>If she knew the reason why I\u2019d stopped gambling, she would think I was the lowest of the low.</p><p>I try to be responsible, try to keep out of trouble, but it just seems to follow me everywhere I go. Or maybe I just attract it.</p><p>No maybe about it. I absolutely do.</p><p>Even after everything that has happened, I still bring shit to my dad\u2019s door.</p><p>I hook up with a married woman, thinking solely with my dick, and the pissed off husband shows up at the hotel.</p><p>I was beyond relieved that Dad was out when he turned up. Even though he found out about it later, I was glad he was out of the loop. I don\u2019t want him getting into any more shit because of me. He\u2019s already lost so much at my hands.</p><p>Not that he\u2019d ever say that. He would never blame me a day in his life. Dad never makes me feel like a disappointment, but I know I am.</p><p>Thankfully, the angry husband fiasco didn\u2019t culminate into a kick-off\u2014and that was thanks to Beth and her ability to calm angry men down.</p><p>But I can\u2019t keep doing shit like that.</p><p>Problem is, I don\u2019t know how to be good. Gambling\u2019s out of the question, so women it is. I need to keep my mind busy when I get the urge for the tables, which is often.</p><p>Fucking helps with that. So I fuck often.</p><p>I just have to be careful of the women I choose to screw as I don\u2019t want anything I do coming back on my dad.</p><p>So, definitely no married ones. And no guests at the hotel \u2013 meaning no Mia Monroe.</p><p>My list of reasons to stay away from her just keeps growing.</p><p>She\u2019s a guest at the hotel. She has more baggage than JFK. But mainly, because she is too damn good for someone like me.</p><p>Nothing good could come of Mia wrapped around me. Well, something good would come of it\u2014pun totally intended\u2014but after the physical high, reality would bring me crashing back down to earth.</p><p>She deserves better than I could ever give her.</p><p>And I\u2019m doing well, I think. I\u2019ve been around her for a good while now. Yeah, I know what you\u2019re thinking, it\u2019s been less than a day in her company. But trust me, this is some kind of fucking record that I haven\u2019t tried to hit on her.</p><p>My only slip up was in the car earlier when I flirted with her. But that was nothing compared to how I usually go for it.</p><p>I just couldn\u2019t resist. And the look on her face ... so goddamn cute. Her cheeks turned pink, and she looked surprised and embarrassed. You\u2019d think no one had ever flirted with her before, but looking like she does, I find that very hard to believe.</p><p>We\u2019re back at the hotel, and I\u2019m in the kitchen making us some coffee. After we\u2019d finished lunch at the diner, there was still an hour to kill before I have to pick Dozer up, so I brought Mia back to the hotel and downloaded the info I found. I printed the details off while Mia went to change out of her torn t-shirt.</p><p>She gave me my shirt back before she went to change. I\u2019m not ashamed to say I smelled it once she\u2019d walked away.</p><p>It smelled amazing. Total jerking off material.</p><p>Seriously, if Mia Monroe were a bottled scent, I\u2019d spray it all over my pillows. And my clothes. Hell, I\u2019d spray it on myself.</p><p>When she came back from changing, she was freshly showered, and her hair was still a little damp, vanilla scent floating around her. She was wearing a pale pink tank top and ass hugging jeans, and my cock nearly sprang from my jeans. She looked fucking gorgeous.</p><p>It took me a good few minutes to get my head working properly before I could sit down with her and start looking over the details. She\u2019d seemed quiet while I talked her through what I\u2019d printed off, so I left her sitting outside on the porch, thinking she maybe needed a few. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Hence the reason I\u2019m in here making coffee.</p><p>I figure she\u2019ll just be processing things. I can\u2019t begin to imagine how it must feel to know that your mom abandoned you.</p><p>I\u2019ve never been abandoned, but dying mothers I have down to pat.</p><p>My real mom, Abbi, died in childbirth. She had a heart problem that they didn\u2019t know about, and the stress of giving birth to me killed her.</p> <p>She wasn\u2019t married to Dad. They were young, in a steady relationship, but my dad hadn\u2019t kept it covered, so nine months later it was hello Jordan.</p><p>After Abbi died, Dad raised me alone with the help of my grandpa. When I was two, Belle, my step-mom who I always refer to as mom as she\u2019s the only one I ever known, came back to town, and her and dad got back together. Dad and Mom were childhood sweethearts. Mom left town to go to college, but Dad stayed here and went to the police academy. Before she left they broke up, and that was when he met Abbi and had me.</p><p>Mom died four years ago, and he hasn\u2019t looked at another woman since.</p><p>Dad has had such a rough time in his life. He\u2019s lost two women he loved. I think losing both of them has killed his faith in love. Totally understandable.</p><p>And that\u2019s why I stay single. I only bother with a woman when I need to get laid.</p> <p>The phone starts to ring. \u201cGolden Oaks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey son, how you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey Dad, I\u2019m good. How\u2019s Grandpa doing? He driving you crazy yet?\u201d</p><p>He laughs. \u201cOf course. You know your Grandpa. How are things at the hotel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, good. We\u2019ve got a guest staying at the moment. She\u2019s here for two weeks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe?\u201d Silence. \u201cYou\u2019ve got a woman staying there right now?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, Dad.\u201d I sigh.</p><p>\u201cIs she alone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow old is she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, around my age, maybe a few years younger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes she have a boyfriend?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus, Dad.\u201d I sigh again. \u201cI don\u2019t know her relationship status\u2014\u201d A lie. \u201c\u2014because I don\u2019t need to. I\u2019m not gonna touch her, okay? She\u2019s not my type.\u201d</p><p>That one is a small lie. Mia isn\u2019t my usual type. She\u2019s so much more.</p> <p>\u201cEvery girl is your type, Jordan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot every girl!\u201d I scoff. \u201cI would never sleep with an ugly girl. Jeez, give me some fuckin\u2019 credit, Dad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus, Jordan, do you have to cuss so much?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I fucking do.\u201d</p><p>How do parents have the ability to turn you from a grown ass man into a teenager in the matter of seconds?</p><p>\u201cSo, she\u2019s ugly then?\u201d he says, starting in again.</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d I play out.</p><p>He lets out a loud sigh. \u201cThe girl you have no intention of trying to get into bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell ... no, she\u2019s not what I would call ugly...\u201d</p><p>He laughs. Loudly.</p><p>It really pisses me off.</p><p>\u201cLook, I know you think I\u2019m a fuck up, and I know that\u2019s my fault, but I am fully capable of keeping my hands to myself. I\u2019m staying away from this girl. She\u2019s a guest. End of.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhoa, calm down, son. First off, I do not think you\u2019re a fuck-up. You hear me? I just worry about you. Parent\u2019s privilege. I just want you to be happy, but you always seem to look for happiness in all the wrong places. More so recently.\u201d</p><p>This is getting a little deeper than I like. I don\u2019t do deep. Especially not with my dad.</p><p>I lean my arm against the wall and rest my forehead on it.</p><p>I blow out a breath. \u201cI\u2019m fine, Dad. I\u2019m happy. Look, I have to go. Say hi to Grandpa for me, will you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d He sounds resigned, and I\u2019m glad. I don\u2019t want this conversation to go on any longer than necessary. \u201cTake care, son. Speak to you soon.\u201d</p><p>I hang up the phone, then realize I forgot to tell him about Dozer\u2019s accident. Whatever. I\u2019m not in the mood to call him back right now. I\u2019ll tell him later.</p><p>I take our coffees outside. Mia is sitting at the table. Her sunglasses are off, and she\u2019s leaned back in her chair, head tilted, staring up at the sky.</p><p>I watch her for longer than I should.</p><p>Her head comes up suddenly, and she catches me staring.</p><p>Acting like there is nothing weird about me staring at her, I smile and walk over, putting her coffee on the table in front of her.</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d She smiles up at me, and it feels like I just got punched in the chest.</p><p>That is seriously starting to drive me crazy. Not the smiles ... no, those are awesome. It\u2019s my reaction to them that\u2019s pissing me off. My reaction to her.</p><p>I take the chair across from her. Settling back, I take a sip of my coffee and set it down.</p><p>\u201cAny idea where you want to start?\u201d I nod at the papers in front of her.</p><p>Mia takes a sip of coffee, her eyes watching mine over the brim of the cup. \u201cI thought maybe I would start with the Anna that lives in Farmington. That\u2019s the largest town, right? Because I thought if I were her and I was getting away that\u2019s where I would go. Or maybe go to another state altogether, so I\u2019d be harder to find.\u201d</p><p>Her lips downturn. I feel a pang of ... I don\u2019t know. All I do know is I really don\u2019t like to see her sad.</p><p>\u201cThink positive, Mia. Start with what we have and go from there.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes lift. \u201cYou\u2019re right. I\u2019ll drive out there tomorrow\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe,\u201d I emphasize.</p><p>I could really do without going to Farmington. I\u2019ve avoided that place like the plague since what happened with Dad. But I can\u2019t let her go there alone. And the likelihood I\u2019ll see anyone I don\u2019t want to see, during the day, is slim to none.</p><p>The likes of me only come out to play at night.</p><p>Mia places her cup down. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to come with me. You\u2019ve helped me enough already \u2013 and you have the hotel to run.\u201d</p><p>Leaning back, I cross my leg over my other and rest my ankle on my thigh. \u201cIf you haven\u2019t noticed, we\u2019re not exactly busy. You\u2019re my only guest, so call this the all-inclusive package.\u201d I grin so that it doesn\u2019t come off as creepy.</p><p>She laughs.</p><p>Good sign.</p><p>Her eyebrow lifts, and she starts pulling on that damn lip again. \u201cSo ... what does this all-inclusive package entail?\u201d</p><p>Hmm. She\u2019s flirting with me. Interesting.</p><p>Very. Fucking. Interesting.</p><p>\u201cNothing specific. It\u2019s more of a try and see kind of thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d She hasn\u2019t taken her eyes off me.</p><p>I\u2019m really liking the direction this is going. I shouldn\u2019t, but I can\u2019t help myself. I have Mia\u2019s interest, and I\u2019m not letting go until I know what it means.</p><p>My breathing has picked up, so I take a quick sip of my coffee to cover it, but don\u2019t take my eyes off her.</p><p>\u201cBut part of that package does mean I\u2019m coming with you tomorrow. I really don\u2019t think it\u2019s safe for you drive out there alone.\u201d</p><p>A little frown dimples between her brows, and a fire lights in her eyes. It\u2019s sexy, but I know I\u2019ve pissed her off. I had this going in a good direction, but I just had to open my big mouth and ruin it.</p><p>She folds her arms across her chest. It pushes those perfect tits of hers up; tits that I\u2019m trying really hard not to look at.</p><p>\u201cJordan, I drove across seven states alone to get here. I can manage a drive out of town.\u201d She sounds pissed off, and her lip has jutted out. I can\u2019t help but chuckle.</p><p>She\u2019s so goddamn adorable. I\u2019m tempted to throw all caution to the wind, and take her face in my hands and kiss those beautiful lips of hers.</p><p>\u201cI get it,\u201d I say, covering up a smile. \u201cYou can take care of yourself. But just humor me. Remember, I grew up the son of a cop, I know about the bad side of women driving alone long distance. Jeez, just knowing you did that to get here makes me feel like I\u2019m going to break out in hives. And that wouldn\u2019t be pretty. You don\u2019t want to be responsible for making me look ugly, do you? Like the kind of ugly that scares small children.\u201d I pull a face, and she smiles.</p><p>I\u2019m playing, because I don\u2019t want to knock the self-confidence and independence she so clearly needs to exert\u2014the confidence that bastard took away from her the instant he laid a finger on her.</p><p>But I also can\u2019t let her go there alone.</p><p>She looks down at the table and runs her fingertip along the groove. I\u2019ve already gotten familiar with the face she pulls when she\u2019s thinking something over, and she\u2019s wearing that look right now.</p><p>She lifts her head, looking at me intently. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be the one responsible for spoiling that nice face of yours, so ... okay, you can come.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think I have a nice face?\u201d I tilt my head to the side, grinning.</p><p>Of course, I caught that. And of course I want to know the answer. Mia is the only woman I\u2019ve ever had to question as to whether she finds me attractive or not.</p><p>She\u2019s so hard to read that it\u2019s impossible to tell what she\u2019s thinking most of the time.</p><p>It\u2019s fucking with my head, to say the least.</p><p>Her face has gone as red as I expected it would. I\u2019ve never met a girl as shy as she is.</p><p>I\u2019ve never met a girl like her, period. She\u2019s so different. Unassuming of anything, mainly herself. She has no clue just how fucking awesome she actually is, but I want her to know. I just wish I knew how to tell her.</p><p>\u201cUh, um, well...\u201d She runs her fingers through her hair, and keeps her eyes fixed on the coffee in front of her. \u201cYou have a nice face. You know, as faces go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take that as a compliment.\u201d I smile. But what I actually feel like doing is breaking into a fucking dance. \u201cYou have a nice face too, Mia. Really nice.\u201d</p><p>I hear her quick intake of breath, and I notice the flush on her chest. She\u2019s affected by me.</p><p>A-fuckin-men!</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she says quietly, biting down on a smile.</p><p>\u201cYou have a serious problem with that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Her eyes flick up to mine, the warmth instantly dying.</p><p>I hold off the frown I feel knowing why she reacts like she does \u2013 suspicious of what I say and do. But it doesn\u2019t mean I have to like it. What that asshole has done to her, how he has broken her confidence ... and I don\u2019t even know the half of it. I\u2019m just praying that the black-eye was the whole of it and nothing more.</p><p>\u201cSaying thank you. You say it all the time,\u201d I tell her.</p><p>\u201cOh. Good manners ... they were drummed into me.\u201d The light heartedness in her voice doesn\u2019t match the look in her eyes.</p><p>If I hadn\u2019t been watching closely, I would have missed how her eyes dimmed, but I didn\u2019t, and now it\u2019s stirred an uncomfortable feeling in my gut.</p><p>There is more\u2014more than the black-eye from the douchebag ex of hers. And now I\u2019m fucking fuming.</p><p>I want to know the rest ... need to know so I can help her. But I can\u2019t ask her outright, I don\u2019t want to upset her like I did before, so I\u2019ll just have to wait until she\u2019s ready to tell me. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>If ever.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need to use good manners around me.\u201d I lighten my voice, trying to bring her back from wherever she\u2019s gone. \u201cIf you haven\u2019t noticed, I don\u2019t have any.\u201d</p><p>She gives a half-smile. \u201cI don\u2019t know, you seem to be pretty well mannered around me.\u201d</p><p>I raise my eyebrow. \u201cI cuss. A fuck of a lot.\u201d</p> <p>She laughs. The sound eases through me.</p><p>\u201cYou do cuss a lot, but I find it refreshing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy cussing is refreshing? There\u2019s a new one. You\u2019ll have to tell my dad because I\u2019m pretty sure he\u2019d disagree. Apparently, cussing in front of guests is a big no-no,\u201d I say with mock-confusion, lifting my shoulders in a shrug.</p><p>I don\u2019t know what it is that sets her off, but she throws her head back and starts to laugh. A real honest to god belly laugh. And it\u2019s just such an awesome, beautiful sound that I can\u2019t help but laugh too.</p><p>Clutching her stomach with her hand, she attempts to catch her breath. She sweeps her bangs back.</p> <p>Her blue eyes are glistening.</p><p>She looks like poetry. Like the sky on a hot summers day. Like the ace in the hand I need to win.</p><p>Okay, I\u2019m guessing you get the picture.</p><p>She looks beautiful.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re funny.\u201d She smiles. \u201cYou make me laugh.\u201d</p><p>Hold up. Clarification needed. I don\u2019t mind being the class clown, but not the village fucking idiot.</p> <p>\u201cFunny ha-ha, or funny peculiar?\u201d</p><p>She leans forward, elbows on table, chin in hands as she purses her lips. I feel like I\u2019m being appraised. I can\u2019t say a woman has ever looked at me this way before. Or left me hanging on a question. I feel a bit rattled, to be honest.</p><p>\u201cFunny ha-ha,\u201d she finally says.</p><p>Well, thank fuck for that.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re quick, straightforward, and you don\u2019t mess around. It\u2019s refreshing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow, if I didn\u2019t know better, I think you were calling me common...\u201d I tease.</p><p>She drags her lip back with her teeth and her eyes flash me a look. It\u2019s seriously hot.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re anything but common.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll take that as another compliment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was meant as one.\u201d I notice that her voice has dropped a few octaves lower. That her breathing has hitched slightly and that the flush is back, curving the tops of those amazing breasts of hers.</p><p>There\u2019s a tangible heat moving between us. It\u2019s taking everything in me right now, to hold back and not make a move on her.</p><p>Fuck, I want to make a move, and the way she\u2019s looking at me...</p><p>She wants me.</p><p>Trust me, I know one thing well, and that\u2019s when a woman wants me. And Mia wants me.</p><p>I meet her eyes again, and I\u2019m swiftly reminded of the bruise on her face.</p><p>Crash and burn.</p><p>She\u2019s too fragile.</p><p>She\u2019s been through too much. I\u2019m not the kind of guy she needs.</p><p>Shoving the chair back, I get to my feet. Mia\u2019s eyes dart up. I\u2019m pretty sure I see a flash of disappointment in them. It both, buzzes and sours my mood.</p><p>Fucked up, right?</p><p>\u201cTime for me to pick Dozer up.\u201d I glance at my watch as though to confirm this fact to her.</p><p>\u201cWould you mind if I came along? I\u2019d really like to see how he\u2019s doing,\u201d she asks in that sweet ass voice of hers.</p><p>It invades my head like a physical presence.</p><p>I want to say no because I could do with the time to clear my mind of her, and what I want to do with her ... to her.</p><p>I even open my mouth to say no. But, of course, I say yes.</p><p>One look into those stunning blue eyes of hers and all my sense flies out the window.</p><p>Then she smiles, and I\u2019m fucking done for.</p><p>I can\u2019t even blame this one on my cock as he hasn\u2019t even shown up for the party.</p><p>The drive to the vet is quiet. Mainly because I can\u2019t think of a damn thing to say to her. This is a foreign concept to me. I\u2019m never without something to say to a woman, but right now I\u2019m rattling around inside my head trying to understand what is happening here.</p><p>Why is Mia affecting me so much?</p><p>Maybe it\u2019s because the unknown is eating away at me.</p><p>Putting the sex aside\u2014yes, I did just say that, unbelievable, right? See this is what she\u2019s doing to me. The thing is, I actually like talking to her. She\u2019s smart. And fun. I\u2019m hot for her, and I want to spend time with her.</p><p>Never. Happened. Before.</p><p>And I don\u2019t like it.</p><p>This girl is going to slowly drive me crazy, I can feel it.</p><p>Maybe I should just have sex with her and get it over with, be damned the consequences. She\u2019s definitely hot for me; I could tell before. Maybe if I just...</p><p>\u201c\u2014wasn\u2019t that the turn for the vet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I come to at the sound of Mia\u2019s voice.</p><p>\u201cI think you just missed the turn to the vet.\u201d She points over her shoulder.</p><p>I cast a quick glance behind me, and see that I have indeed missed my turning because I was thinking about her.</p><p>\u201cShit, yeah,\u201d I mutter.</p><p>I check the road is clear and spin the car around, heading back the way I just came. I take the turning and pull up outside the vet.</p><p>There\u2019s no one behind the desk when we enter the building, so I ring the bell on the desk.</p><p>Penny appears from behind a door. \u201cHello again.\u201d She smiles brightly. \u201cDozer\u2019s all ready for you. If you want to take a seat, I\u2019ll bring him right out.\u201d</p><p>I sit down beside Mia, but I feel restless. I\u2019m not exactly sure what it is that\u2019s making me restless. Maybe it\u2019s because I\u2019m hyped up on sexual tension.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d Mia asks.</p><p>I follow her eyes to my tapping foot.</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah, fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you worried about Dozer?\u201d She smiles softly and touches my arm with her hand.</p><p>My body electrifies from her touch. I can barely think straight from the heat burning my skin.</p><p>Seriously, what the fuck is that?</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d I mutter.</p><p>She looks confused.</p><p>I open my mouth, but close it when Penny comes out with Dozer. \u201cHere he is.\u201d</p><p>Dozer limps toward me. His leg is in a cast and he has a pissed off look on his face. He\u2019s wearing one of those huge cones around his head.</p><p>I have to bite back a smile. Poor bastard. He\u2019s really been through the wringer.</p><p>\u201cHey, buddy.\u201d I walk over to him and crouch down. \u201cHow you doing?\u201d</p><p>He grunts and scuffs the cone against my shoulder.</p><p>\u201cHow long does he have to keep this on for?\u201d I stand up, taking his leash from Penny.</p><p>\u201cSee how he goes. Dr. Callie only put it on as he was chewing at the cast.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee Dozer, leave your leg alone and the cone can come off.\u201d</p><p>He gives me a dirty look, then yanks his leash from my hand and limps over to Mia.</p><p>I watch them, the way she welcomes him over, no fear. Dozer is a big dog, and people are usually wary of him, but not Mia. Not even when he drops his huge head on her lap, awkwardly shuffling around with the cone, drooling on her jeans. She doesn\u2019t falter, just gives him the attention he wants.</p><p>Dozer is never this friendly with people he doesn\u2019t know. Generally, he gives them a wide birth. He\u2019s always been that way, and I\u2019ve put it down to whatever happened to him to make him land on our doorstep.</p><p>But Mia did care for him after his accident; she showed him a kindness that most people don\u2019t have in them. It will have pre-warmed him to her, and Mia is hard not to like. I know that all too damn well.</p><p>I watch her scratching his ear, cooing over him, and he\u2019s freaking soaking it up. Lucky bastard. What I wouldn\u2019t give to have her hands on me right now. Seriously, I\u2019d take an ear scratching if it meant her touching me.</p><p>A broken leg is starting to sound quite appealing at this moment in time.</p><p>Mia suddenly lifts her eyes from Dozer to me like she can hear my thoughts, and catches me staring.</p><p>Her blue eyes peer curiously into mine. I know I should look away, but I don\u2019t...</p><p>I can\u2019t.</p><p>A smile slowly lifts her lips. The light coming in through the window, behind her, frames her perfectly. She looks like an angel. The most beautiful thing I have ever seen.</p><p>Punch. To. The. Chest.</p><p>I feel like I can\u2019t breathe.</p><p>\u201cIf you can just sign these forms for me, and settle up the bill,\u201d Penny says, pulling my attention from Mia.</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d I say, rubbing at my sternum.</p><p>If this keeps up, I\u2019ll be having a heart attack way before my time.</p><p>With a nod, I follow her over to the reception desk. I hand Penny my credit card, trying not to think of how the hell I\u2019m going to pay it off after these vet bills drain it, and sign the two forms she hands to me.</p><p>I glance over my shoulder, and catch Mia staring at me. She\u2019s definitely checking me out. My ass to be exact.</p><p>She looks away when she realizes I\u2019ve caught her out.</p><p>I can\u2019t help the happy fucking glow I feel. I\u2019m grinning like a stripper at a frat party.</p><p>After I\u2019ve finished signing forms, and spending money I don\u2019t have, Penny gives me a small bag containing Dozer\u2019s medication.</p><p>\u201cThese are for his pain. Give him one, three times daily with food, and we\u2019ll need to see him back here in a month\u2019s time to check how that leg\u2019s healing. Only give him a light dinner tonight as his stomach will still be tender from the anesthetic. You can take the collar and leash home with you. Just return it to us when you have time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, I\u2019ll bring it by tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>I make the appointment for four weeks time, and slip the appointment card into my wallet along with my credit card. I shove the medication in my pocket as I make my way back to Mia. Dozer is still making doe eyes at her.</p><p>Even my dog is crazy about her.</p><p>Not that I\u2019m crazy about her.</p><p>No fucking way.</p><p>Absolutely not.</p><p>Never. Ever.</p><p>\u201cReady?\u201d I reach down for Dozer\u2019s leash.</p><p>Turning his head, he knocks my hand away with that huge cone he\u2019s wearing and puts his leash in his mouth, holding it out for Mia to take.</p><p>Nice, Dozer. Blowing me off for a chick. I think he forgets who feeds him.</p><p>Taking the leash from his mouth, she rubs his head.</p><p>She gazes up at me, a smile pushing the corner of her mouth. \u201cIs it okay with you if I walk him out to your car?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t look like you\u2019ve got much of a choice.\u201d I grin in the direction of Dozer\u2019s wagging tail. \u201cI think you\u2019ve got an admirer.\u201d</p><p>She giggles. It\u2019s one of the sexiest sounds I\u2019ve ever heard.</p><p>\u201cWell, Dozer wouldn\u2019t be a bad admirer to have, but I think I\u2019m just a new face to get some attention from. Not that I imagine you ever struggle for attention,\u201d she says to Dozer. \u201cHandsome boy that you are ... aren\u2019t you ... yes, you are.\u201d She smooshes his face in her hands, and I actually find myself jealous of my dog.</p><p>I\u2019m jealous of my dog.</p><p>I really need to get laid.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d I shove my hands in my pockets, then head for the door and out to my car.</p><p>I help Dozer in the back seat. Turning, I find Mia hovering behind me as he settles himself. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cShould I sit in the back with him again?\u201d she asks, biting her bottom lip.</p><p>Jesus, I want to bite that lip.

You\u2019ll have more room up front here next to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay ... if you\u2019re sure.\u201d</p> <p>I see Dozer\u2019s head drop on a grunt.</p><p>I hold a smile back as I watch Mia walk around the car and climb in the passenger seat. But as I\u2019m getting in the car, I can\u2019t resist giving Dozer a smug grin.</p><p>Honestly, the look he\u2019s giving me right now ... I think if he could flip me off, he would.</p><p>Yep, you lost that round, Dozer.</p><p>I turn the ignition, feeling pretty satisfied with myself that I\u2019ve got Mia sitting up front with me...</p> <p>Then it hits me.</p><p>I was just in a pissing contest with my dog.</p><p>There are no words.</p><p>No. Fucking. Words.</p><p>I put the car in drive, heading for home.</p><p>I\u2019m actually starting to think Mia has got some magical power, and that\u2019s what\u2019s making me act out of character. Like voodoo or some shit.</p> <p>It has to be. There is no other logical explanation for the massive pussy I\u2019m turning into.</p><p>All I need to do is get myself away from Mia for a few hours, stick my dick inside some chick, and I\u2019ll be back to myself in no time.</p><p>Except I can\u2019t tonight with Dozer being hurt.</p><p>Tomorrow.</p><p>Definitely tomorrow.</p><p>I\u2019m going to go and pick up the hottest chick I can find, and bang her \u2013 multiple times.</p><p>I\u2019m going to fuck Mia Monroe right out of my head.</p><p>I\u2019m happily smiling to myself at this idea, when that annoying Taylor Swift song \u201cI Knew You Were Trouble\u201d starts to play on the radio.</p> <p>I\u2019m just about to turn it off, when Mia starts to sing along softly, so I leave it playing.</p><p>Jesus, her voice is one of the sweetest sounds I\u2019ve ever heard.</p><p>I listen to her the whole song through. My skin is practically vibrating when she\u2019s finished. Who knew that song could sound so good?</p><p>I reach over and turn the radio down.</p><p>\u201cYou like Taylor Swift?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d She blushes. \u201cOh, yeah, she\u2019s okay. I just really like that song. Probably not your kind of music though, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really.\u201d I smile.</p><p>I want to touch her so very fucking badly in this moment.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she says quietly.</p><p>I quick a glance at her. \u201cWhat are you apologizing for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor singing. I do it sometimes without realizing. I know I have the worst voice ever, and it must have really hurt your eardrums listening to me.\u201d She laughs, but it sounds unnatural, forced. Not like that awesome sound I heard earlier.</p><p>Another quick glance. I notice her body language is off. Her hands are wrapped around herself, almost in protection.</p><p>Tension prickles me like knives.</p><p>\u201cWho told you that?\u201d The asshole ex told her. I really want to punch that prick in the face. Repeatedly.</p><p>She glances down at her jeans and start picking lint off them. I can feel her drawing into herself and away from me. I don\u2019t like the feeling one goddamn bit.</p><p>\u201cOh, no one told me. I just have ears, you know?\u201d A shrug, another fake laugh.</p><p>\u201cWell your ears are off. I think you have a great voice, Mia. Really awesome. I enjoyed listening to you sing.\u201d</p><p>I can feel her eyes on me, so I meet them. I\u2019m yanked in and speaking before I realize.</p><p>\u201cWhat are your plans for tonight?\u201d</p><p>What the hell am I doing?</p><p>Surprise flickers through those gorgeous blues. Then she lifts her slender shoulders and tilts her head. \u201cOh, uh, I was just gonna grab some dinner, then read myself to sleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wanna have dinner with me?\u201d</p><p>Why can\u2019t I stop talking?</p><p>Mia\u2019s eyebrow lifts, and the way that sounded finally reverberates inside my head.</p><p>Jesus that sounded like I was asking her out on a date.</p><p>I don\u2019t date. Ever.</p><p>What am I doing? Asking her to eat with me when a minute ago I was planning a \u2018fuck Mia out of my head\u2019 strategy.</p><p>Rectify! Rectify!</p><p>I swallow down, hard. My eyes now fixed firmly on the road ahead, I moronically stammer out, \u201cI, uh, just meant that I was gonna be cooking myself some dinner, so I can make extra for you if you want? Or not. Whatever.\u201d</p><p>Smooth, Matthews. Real fucking smooth.</p><p>There\u2019s one of her long pauses before she speaks. \u201cThat would be great, Jordan. Thank you.\u201d Her voice is so stilted and quiet that I don\u2019t even risk a glance to see the expression on her face.</p><p>Someone kill me now. Please.</p><p>I hear Dozer snort a sound in the back.</p><p>I\u2019m half tempted to turn around and tell him to piss off, but I\u2019m guessing Mia already thinks I\u2019m a moron, so I skip it.</p><p>Instead, I reach over and turn the radio back up to fill the awkwardness. And let\u2019s just say, the drive back to the hotel is as quiet as the ride out.</p><p>Chapter Ten</p><p>Mia</p><p>Why do I feel so disappointed?</p><p>I didn\u2019t want Jordan to ask me to dinner, but when he corrected his offer, all I felt was disappointment. It\u2019s stupid. I\u2019m stupid.</p><p>Of course he\u2019s going to offer me dinner. He\u2019s a nice guy. I know he said the hotel doesn\u2019t provide evening meals, and he\u2019s probably being polite because I\u2019m the only guest, but I can\u2019t let him feed me for free. I\u2019ll have to make sure he adds the cost of the meal to my bill. I\u2019m sure he will anyway, but I\u2019ll have to make sure.</p><p>Look at me, crushing on the first guy who\u2019s nice to me. It\u2019s ridiculous, even for me.</p><p>I just need to concentrate on what I\u2019m here for\u2014finding my mother, getting some answers, and moving on with my life. Starting fresh.</p><p>We\u2019re back at the hotel now. I\u2019m standing by the archway watching Jordan as he settles Dozer onto the sofa. He even turns on the TV for him.</p><p>I have to suppress the smile I feel. And the zap of attraction that hits me.</p><p>He really does think the world of Dozer. He\u2019s a lucky dog. Minus the car hitting him, that is.</p><p>I follow Jordan through to the hotel kitchen after he\u2019s finished settling Dozer.</p><p>I take a seat on a stool by the kitchen counter.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not the best chef...\u201d he says over his shoulder, heading for the refrigerator.</p><p>\u201cSounds promising,\u201d I quip.</p><p>I\u2019m surprised at my own boldness. This isn\u2019t natural for me, and not how I speak around men at all. I\u2019m always guarded, thinking over my words before I speak.</p><p>I had to be. One slip up could cost me badly.</p><p>But with Jordan it\u2019s easy to slip because everything with him feels natural.</p><p>He turns slightly, looking affronted. \u201cHey! I\u2019m not bad. I make a mean Green Chili. I\u2019ll get the ingredients in and make it for you another night, but for tonight, just name anything you want\u2014that I have the ingredients for\u2014\u201d he grins, \u201cand I\u2019ll make it.\u201d</p><p>Feeling lightened by his banter, I shrug. \u201cI\u2019m easy. Whatever you want is fine with me.\u201d</p><p>His brows lift. He turns his body fully around to face me.</p><p>Easy. Not the best word to use, Mia.</p><p>See this is what happens when I don\u2019t consider my words. Verbal diarrhea.</p><p>\u201cN-not that I\u2019m e-easy. Just easy about the food, you know,\u201d I start to stammer. \u201cJ-just not fussed, easy to please.\u201d</p><p>His brow lifts higher, and he\u2019s grinning.</p><p>I want the ground to swallow me up. Now. Please.</p><p>\u201cEasy to please. Got it.\u201d He turns his attention back to the fridge.</p><p>I\u2019m such an idiot. I really shouldn\u2019t be let out around people.</p><p>Jordan starts pulling food out and placing it on the counter. Eggs, tomatoes...</p><p>\u201cSo, \u2018easy to please\u2019, will a Spanish omelet be okay?\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t help the laugh that escapes me. \u201cA Spanish omelet will be perfect.\u201d</p><p>He gives me a smile before turning back.</p><p>\u201cYou want any help?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah, I got it. You want something to drink? There\u2019s beer in the fridge, or wine if you want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeer\u2019s great.\u201d I hop off the stool and go over to the fridge. \u201cYou want one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>I grab two bottles.</p><p>\u201cOpener is in the drawer.\u201d Jordan points to the drawer with the knife he\u2019s using to chop the tomatoes.</p><p>I falter in my step, my chest tightening, legs stiffening. My eyes hazing.</p><p>Shit.</p><p>Oliver trailed the knife across my collar bone and over my shoulder.</p><p>\u201cWhere did you get this from, Mia?\u201d He held up the top I\u2019d bought myself the day prior. A beautiful, low cut, strappy top, which I had hidden in the back of my closet. I was hoping to wear it when Oliver was at the hospital. I bought it because of the colors. It made me think of summer. I felt warm and happy when I tried it on. I wanted to keep hold of that feeling, so I bought it, even knowing the risk.</p><p>\u201cI b-bought it, sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid I give you permission to buy this?</p><p>I hung my head. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>He moved closer to me. \u201cThis is a whore\u2019s top! Designed to get the attention of boys! Is that what you want, Mia? You want the attention of boys?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Daddy.\u201d</p><p>He held the top in front of me as he shredded it with the knife.</p><p>I wanted to cry. Over a top. But that top had made me feel happy. For that fleeting moment, I had felt happy, and he\u2019d taken it away again. Like always.</p><p>\u201cTake off your sweater, Mia.\u201d</p><p>My eyes snapped up to his. \u201cW-why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t question me!\u201d he roared. \u201cJust do as I say!\u201d</p><p>My body shaking, I lifted the sweater over my head. Leaving me in my bra, I held my sweater, fingers clutching it, against my stomach.</p><p>Fear was roiling inside me.</p><p>Oliver walked behind me.</p><p>I squeezed my eyes shut.</p><p>I heard the knife being placed down on his desk, then the snap of Oliver\u2019s belt as he removed it from his pants.</p><p>My stomach dropped hollow. No matter how many times it happened, the fear was always the same.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve disobeyed my rules, Mia. You\u2019ve been a bad girl. What happens to bad girls?\u201d</p><p>I swallowed past the fear that was drying my mouth and shaking my insides. \u201cThey get punished, sir.\u201d</p><p>I braced myself, gritting my teeth.</p><p>I felt the lash of the first hit on my back. Stifling my screams, I bit down on my lip until I tasted blood.</p><p>\u201cJesus, Mia! Are you okay?\u201d</p><p>A worried Jordan is standing before me. I feel something running down my chin. I press the heel of my hand against my mouth. Blood.</p><p>I bit through my lip.</p><p>\u201cGod, oh, I, uh \u2013 it was an accident.\u201d</p><p>An accident? Yeah, because normal people bite their lips and draw blood all the time Mia. Perfectly normal. He won\u2019t think anything is off there.</p><p>Saying nothing, Jordan takes the beer bottles from my hands and places them on the counter.</p><p>That\u2019s when I realize my hands are shaking.</p><p>\u201cSit up here.\u201d He pulls a stool over. I climb onto it, my legs suddenly feeling like jelly. He opens a drawer, then comes back with a first aid kit.</p><p>God, I\u2019m such a screw-up. Now I\u2019m zoning out and biting my own lip open. Awesome Mia. Way to go. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSorry,\u201d I mumble as he starts to dab at the blood with a wipe. Antiseptic. Stings a little but I\u2019m used to the sting \u2013 years of using the stuff will do that. \u201cI\u2019m such a klutz.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m trying not focus on Jordan\u2019s nearness, or how my skin tingles when he touches me. Or how amazing he smells. Or that I want him to kiss me.</p><p>Right now.</p><p>More than anything.</p> <p>Yes, that\u2019s what I\u2019m thinking about in this screwed up moment.</p><p>Normal is something I will never be. I figured that out a long time ago.</p><p>\u201cStop apologizing,\u201d he says softly, meeting my eyes. \u201cJust tell me what happened back then.\u201d</p><p>I hold my gaze steady. \u201cNothing happened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing happened? You zoned out completely. Where\u2019d you go?\u201d</p> <p>I look away, focusing on the wall behind him. \u201cNowhere special. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>He sighs. His warm breath blows through my hair. His exasperation should bother me, but all I can focus on is the way his nearness is making me feel right now. And that\u2019s alive.</p><p>I can\u2019t ever remember feeling this alive before.</p><p>\u201cSeriously, stop saying you\u2019re sorry. You have nothing to be sorry about. I\u2019m just worried about you.\u201d He presses the wipe against my lip. \u201cWere you thinking about what your ex did to you? How you got the black-eye? I know that traumatic events can sometimes be triggered by the smallest thing, causing blackouts and that kind of thing.\u201d</p><p>My body freezes. Muscles stiff.</p><p>I shake my head.</p> <p>It\u2019s the truth because the real screwed up in me happened long before Forbes came into my life. Forbes was just the rain after the tornado.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d I say, probably a little too harshly. I don\u2019t mean to be this way, but I just can\u2019t talk about it. Not with him.</p><p>Not with anyone.</p><p>Removing the wipe, he steps back and rakes a hand through his hair. I can tell he\u2019s frustrated, and I\u2019m the one frustrating him.</p><p>All I ever seem to do is frustrate and anger men, but that\u2019s also all I know. Kindness confuses me. Throws me for a loop.</p><p>An angry, frustrated man makes more sense to me.</p><p>\u201cI know you don\u2019t know me well, but you can trust me. You can talk to me and tell me anything. I won\u2019t judge ... honestly, I\u2019m no one to judge.\u201d His gaze sweeps the floor, then meets back with mine. His eyes are honest and clear. \u201cI might be able to help you.\u201d</p><p>Even when he\u2019s frustrated, he\u2019s kind. I don\u2019t know what to do with that.</p> <p>But I do want his help. More than anything I want to trust someone. I want to trust him.</p><p>I open my mouth to let the words spill out. But I can\u2019t. The broken in me can\u2019t be fixed.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m long past help.\u201d I shake my head, hating that I let that slip out. \u201cI appreciate it \u2013 you \u2013 everything you\u2019ve done for me. But really, there\u2019s nothing to talk about.\u201d I slide down off the stool.</p><p>\u201cThanks for the clean-up, but I\u2019m going to skip dinner. I\u2019m feeling pretty tired.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMia...\u201d</p><p>Ignoring the plea in his voice, I\u2019m out of the kitchen and running to my room.</p><p>Chapter Eleven</p><p>Jordan</p><p>I lift my hand to knock on the door, then retract it and step back.</p><p>I\u2019m standing outside Mia\u2019s room, wondering if I should knock on her door or not.</p><p>It\u2019s a fairly simple act. I lift my hand. It makes contact with the wood. I knock. She opens the door.</p><p>Simple, right?</p><p>So why am I thinking it over?</p><p>Because after last night, things don\u2019t feel so simple anymore when it comes to Mia. Not that I\u2019ve been coasting down easy street from the moment I met her, but this is just way out of my territory.</p><p>I have no clue what to say to her. And I always know what to say to women.</p><p>I suppose, I could just act like it never happened.</p><p>Yeah, because that wouldn\u2019t be a totally shitty thing to do.</p><p>Maybe I can just let her know if she ever needs to talk to me about anything, I\u2019m here.</p><p>That\u2019s it. I\u2019ll do that. I\u2019ll knock on the door, tell her breakfast is ready, ask her what time she wants to leave to go to Farmington, and subtly mention that I\u2019m here for her.</p><p>Easy.</p><p>I lift my hand to the door, and suddenly see a flash of Mia\u2019s face from last night.</p><p>The look on her face. She was completely zoned out. Somewhere else. And the way she bit into her lip ... I have honestly never seen anything like it.</p><p>I\u2019m not afraid to admit that seeing her like that frightened the shit out of me.</p><p>What could have made her get that way?</p><p>I\u2019m guessing things are way worse for her then I\u2019d first thought. More than just the douche ex giving her that black eye.</p><p>I got that when she said she was beyond help and ran out of the kitchen like her feet were on fire.</p><p>In that moment, I wanted to go after her. Help her. I almost did. But I stopped myself.</p><p>Why? Because I knew if I did, I would be crossing the line into something else.</p><p>I would be getting in deep with her.</p><p>I don\u2019t do deep. I can\u2019t do deep.</p><p>Fucking? Yes.</p><p>Touchy feely? Huge no-no.</p><p>I back up, lean against the wall and drive my hands through my hair.</p><p>I\u2019m exhausted. I hardly slept last night. I had Dozer and his broken leg in bed with me, leaving me with an inch of mattress to sleep on. My lack of sleep had absolutely nothing to do with Mia\u2019s freak out last night. I might have thought about it a few times. But not much. I was just trying to figure out what her fuckhole of an ex could have put her through. And all thinking about it did was rile me up.</p><p>So then I thought happy Mia thoughts.</p><p>I thought about having sex with her in multiple different ways. And I imagined what those sweet lips of hers would feel like to kiss.</p><p>How she would taste.</p><p>How all of her would taste...</p><p>Her skin...</p><p>Her tight, hot pussy...</p><p>Fine. I spent all of my night either worrying about Mia, or thinking about all the ways I want to do her.</p><p>Mia was on my mind all goddamn night.</p><p>Happy?</p><p>Cause I\u2019m fucking not.</p><p>Fuck this shit.</p><p>I push off the wall, arm raised with the purpose of banging on the door, when Mia suddenly opens it.</p><p>\u201cShit!\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus!\u201d</p><p>My arm is still raised mid-air, and my heart is pounding like a motherfucker.</p><p>Mia\u2019s eyes are on my raised arm, her breaths coming in quick, chest heaving.</p><p>Fuck, her tits look great in that top.</p><p>And I\u2019m staring.</p><p>Eyes avert. I lower my arm to my side.</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d I say at the same time as she does.</p><p>I lift my eyes to hers and grin. Her eyes smile at me.</p><p>\u201cI just\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was\u2014\u201d</p><p>She laughs.</p><p>The sound is so fucking sexy.</p><p>I want her. I can honestly say I have never wanted anything more in my life than her. My cock is throbbing. It\u2019s a pleasure/pain thing.</p><p>Pleasure at the sight of her.</p><p>Pain that he can\u2019t get in her.</p><p>I think he\u2019s dying of thirst. He needs to bathe in the fountain of Mia.</p><p>Am I experiencing sexual frustration? Shit ... I think I might be. So this is what it\u2019s like. It\u2019s pretty torturous. How the hell do monks survive? I know for a fact that I\u2019m not going to last much longer without getting laid.</p><p>\u201cYou go.\u201d She gestures.</p><p>What?</p><p>Oh yeah, we were talking. Kind of.</p><p>I push my hands in my pockets and shift on my feet. \u201cI just came to let you know breakfast is ready, and also to see what time you wanted to head out to Farmington?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou still want to go with me?\u201d She looks surprised.</p><p>\u201cOf course. Why wouldn\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>Her eyes drop to her feet.</p><p>I follow her gaze down, wishing her legs weren\u2019t covered in denim right now. I see she\u2019s wearing a pair of flip-flops and that her toenails are painted pink.</p><p>Is it strange that the sight of her feet is turning me on?</p><p>Yeah, well if it is, I don\u2019t care. I want to push her back onto the bed, take those flip-flips off, then her jeans, and lick my way down her sexy instep, all the way up those gorgeous legs until I reach home.</p><p>\u201cBecause ... well, uh...\u201d Her soft voice pulls me back to her. \u201cBecause of last night.\u201d</p><p>I frown. I can\u2019t help it. \u201cNothing\u2019s changed.\u201d Everything\u2019s changed. \u201cLast night ... it\u2019s your business. If you want to talk about it, I\u2019m here. If not...\u201d I lift my shoulders. \u201cI\u2019m still here.\u201d</p><p>Jesus, could I sound any more like a woman? I\u2019ll be growing a vagina if I keep this shit up.</p><p>A smile touches the corners of her lips.</p><p>Our eyes catch, and I almost flinch from the pang that flashes across my chest.</p><p>That shit is getting on my last goddamn nerve.</p><p>I only get it when I\u2019m with Mia.</p><p>Maybe it\u2019s...?</p><p>No.</p><p>No. Fucking. Way.</p><p>\u201cAre you ready to eat now?\u201d I blurt out.</p><p>She looks a little taken aback at my abruptness. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. Good.\u201d I turn and walk down the hall.</p><p>I was short. I didn\u2019t mean to be, and I know I\u2019m having mood swings like a hormonal teenager, but I just can\u2019t seem to control my emotions around her. My head is all over the goddamn place.</p><p>I hear the door click close behind me, then the gentle sound of flip-flops slapping against her feet.</p><p>The sound is like a beat inside my chest.</p><p>I\u2019m out on the terrace before she is. It\u2019s a warm morning, so I thought she might like to eat outside.</p><p>I set the table already. I called Paula last night and told her not to come in today. There\u2019s not much that needs doing, nothing I can\u2019t do myself.</p><p>It has absolutely nothing to do with the fact that I like being here with Mia. Alone.</p><p>Nothing at all.</p><p>\u201cYou mind if I eat with you?\u201d I check as she takes a seat.</p><p>She\u2019s still a guest here, and I have to remind myself of that. Even if I am letting myself get a little entwined in her life.</p><p>Her smile is a puzzled one. \u201cNo, of course not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCool.\u201d I start to back away toward the door. \u201cWhat would you like to drink?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCoffee would be great.\u201d</p><p>I head in the kitchen. I have the food already on a tray, so I just add the coffee pot, cream and sugar.</p><p>\u201cI made a few things,\u201d I say as I come back outside. \u201cI wasn\u2019t sure what you would like, but last night you said you were easy to please...\u201d I grin as I put the tray of waffles, pancakes, bacon and toast down in the middle of the table.</p><p>\u201cYou made all of this ... for me?\u201d She gulps. Her eyes are glittering.</p><p>A feeling yanks inside my chest like the pulling of puppet strings. I shift uncomfortably.</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, you are a paying guest.\u201d I shrug.</p><p>Her face falls. \u201cYes, of course.\u201d Her words are quiet, but they\u2019ve affected me more than if she had yelled them at me.</p><p>I\u2019m such a fucking idiot.</p><p>\u201cShit, that sounded...\u201d I take the seat across from her. \u201cI don\u2019t make breakfast like this for everyone.\u201d</p><p>Actually, I\u2019ve never made a breakfast like this for anyone in my life before, come to think of it. I don\u2019t do breakfast for the guests. Paula or Dad do. And if I did, they\u2019d be lucky to get a bowl of cereal. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t?\u201d Her eyebrow lifts in disbelief.</p><p>\u201cNope.

I just broke my breakfast virginity with you.\u201d</p> <p>Her cheeks turn deep pink.</p><p>Too much?</p><p>Like I care. I want her. Bad. Fuck everything I\u2019ve said these last few days about staying away. I can\u2019t. I\u2019m not holding back with her anymore. There\u2019s something here with Mia, and I have to find out what it is.</p><p>Our gaze holds for one beat ... two...</p><p>She looks away to the food. \u201cThe waffles look really yummy. Well, it all looks yummy. And the pancakes look ... delicious, and the toast is...\u201d She\u2019s stumbling on her words. It\u2019s cute to watch.</p> <p>\u201cToast,\u201d I finish for her with a chuckle.</p><p>As if on cue, her cheeks flush again. She starts to chew on the inside of her lip. Watching her do that makes my cock pulse and my heart race.</p><p>\u201cYou should eat. You missed dinner last night.\u201d I push the tray toward her.</p><p>She pinches her lower lip between her thumb and forefinger. \u201cI am quite hungry.\u201d</p><p>Tentatively, she reaches out and picks up a waffle, putting it on her plate.</p><p>I sit and watch as she pours maple syrup on the waffle, then lifts it to her mouth and takes a bite. Her eyes close on the food, and the small moan that escapes her stands my guy to attention.</p> <p>Fuck. Me.</p><p>It sounds exactly like the moans I spent most of last night imagining her making.</p><p>I shift in my seat, tilting my body from her view, then cross my leg over the other to hide the boner I\u2019m now sporting.</p><p>I dig into the pancakes and start piling them up on my plate.</p><p>Dozer trots over and lies by my chair, giving me the doe eyes.</p><p>I take a pancake off my plate and give it to him. When I look up, Mia\u2019s gazing at me with a smile.</p><p>My chest starts to ache again.</p><p>\u201cThis is a good waffle,\u201d she says, tearing off another piece and putting it in her mouth. \u201cAm I okay, to give Dozer some?\u201d She gestures to my greedy ass dog who has swallowed the pancake I just gave him whole, and is now eyeballing the food in Mia\u2019s hand.</p> <p>\u201cSure.\u201d I smile.</p><p>\u201cHere, Dozer.\u201d She pats her leg, holding out the rest of her waffle to him.</p><p>Dozer is over there quick flash. Taking the waffle, he swallows it whole, then lays his head on her knee, gazing up at her for more.</p><p>And that\u2019s how the rest of breakfast goes. Dozer having Mia\u2019s full attention while she continues to feed him her breakfast, in-between feeding herself.</p><p>And I sit here watching. Like the third fucking wheel.</p><p>Seriously, this is getting out of hand. I\u2019m getting cock blocked by my dog. Dozer and I are going to be having a serious man to man chat.</p><p>I\u2019m feeling pretty relieved that we\u2019ll be out of here soon, and I\u2019ll get to have a little one on one time with her.</p><p>Yes, I\u2019m completely aware of how pathetic I sound. You don\u2019t need to tell me.</p><p>\u201cThanks for breakfast,\u201d Mia says, wiping her mouth on a napkin. \u201cIt was delicious.\u201d She rises from her chair, handing me her plate. I put it on the tray.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure you\u2019ve eaten enough? Dozer had most of it.\u201d I nod at him, passed out on the floor, content with all the food he\u2019s had from her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m good.\u201d She presses her hand to her stomach indicating that she\u2019s full.</p><p>I don\u2019t know how she can be after the small amount she ate, but then she is only a tiny thing.</p><p>\u201cYou want a hand clearing away?\u201d she offers.</p><p>\u201cNah, I\u2019m good. I\u2019ll just dump them in the kitchen and wash them later. You ready to head out for Farmington now?\u201d</p><p>She pauses by the chair, her fingers gripping the edge of it. \u201cSure.\u201d She smiles.</p><p>It\u2019s one of her forced smiles. I\u2019ve gotten pretty used to recognizing them over the last couple of days.</p><p>I lift the tray, balancing it on my forearm. \u201cWe can go later if you want?\u201d</p><p>She contemplates this for a moment, then shakes her head. \u201cNo. We should go now.\u201d Her eyes meet mine. \u201cIf I don\u2019t, I\u2019ll chicken out.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Twelve</p><p>Mia</p><p>\u201cMy car or yours?\u201d Jordan asks.</p><p>I look between his Mustang and my Mercedes.</p><p>The Mercedes that Oliver bought me two years ago. The day after he\u2019d broken my arm.</p><p>Apparently he didn\u2019t mean to do it. It was an accident.</p><p>It didn\u2019t feel like an accident.</p><p>The car was supposed to be an apology.</p><p>All it did, all it does, is remind me of my weaknesses. Remind me of my life before now. Of every single beating before and after it.</p><p>It reminds me of him ... them.</p><p>\u201cYours,\u201d I reply. \u201cIf that\u2019s okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s more than okay.\u201d Smiling, Jordan pulls his keys from the pocket of his jeans.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll pay for gas,\u201d I say as I walk toward his car. I don\u2019t want Jordan to think I\u2019m taking advantage of his kind nature.</p><p>He stops by the hood, the smile quickly changing to a frown. \u201cNo way.\u201d He shakes his head.</p><p>\u201cOf course I\u2019m going to pay for the gas you\u2019re using to do me a favor.\u201d I open the door and slide onto the leather seat.</p><p>The car dips as Jordan folds his tall, lean body into the car. \u201cNo way. I\u2019m not taking any money from you for gas. End of.\u201d His tone is forceful.</p><p>Instinctively, my shoulders pull in. The feeling of defeat washes over me.</p><p>Then out of nowhere, something spikes in me. Adrenalin floods my bloodstream, kicking my senses to life.</p><p>I know it\u2019s only a small thing, and I know Jordan is trying to be kind in his own way ... but I\u2019m really tired of men telling me what to do and how things are going to be.</p><p>And I\u2019m even more tired of the fact that I let them.</p><p>Well, no more.</p><p>I open the car door, climb out and shut the door behind me\u2014a bit too hard\u2014and head toward my car.</p><p>I know it looks like I\u2019m overacting, but I\u2019ve spent my whole life under-reacting. I need to start behaving like the woman I want to be, and this is me starting. Maybe it\u2019s not the right way, but I\u2019m new to this, and apparently my words don\u2019t seem to work with Jordan, so I\u2019m trying actions.</p><p>I hear his door open, and the sound of his confused voice follows me. \u201cMia, are you okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I toss the word over my shoulder.</p><p>My body is trembling with nerves, but I hold firm.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d He sounds worried. I hear his door shut on a clunk.</p><p>I turn as I walk. \u201cYou. I don\u2019t do well being told what to do.\u201d</p><p>Wow. I can\u2019t believe I just said that! That was awesome!</p><p>Face forward, I keep heading for my car.</p><p>\u201cOkay...\u201d He sounds confused. \u201cAnd where are you going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo Farmington. Alone.\u201d</p><p>I hear his frustrated growl, then the sound of jogging footsteps over gravel heading my way.</p><p>I\u2019d be lying if I said my heart wasn\u2019t in my stomach. Or that my pulse is beating so loud it\u2019s all I can hear.</p><p>I\u2019ve just got my car door open when his hand comes on the door from behind me, holding it shut.</p><p>I bristle. He\u2019s close. Millimeters away I\u2019d say.</p><p>My body reacts with fear ... and lust.</p><p>Quite an abundance of lust, in fact.</p><p>I know I find Jordan attractive\u2014okay, I\u2019ve got the serious hots for him, but the level of desire I feel right now is off the charts. I\u2019ve never felt anything like it. It\u2019s coming off me in waves.</p><p>I\u2019m all weak knees and wet panties. I\u2019ve never felt this turned on before. One minute I\u2019m pulling up my big girl panties, and the next I\u2019m more than willing to drop them for him.</p><p>To say I\u2019m confused is putting it mildly.</p><p>Getting back to my task at hand, I push all my confusing lusty feelings aside, take a deep breath in, square my shoulders, and turn around.</p><p>And ... he\u2019s smiling.</p><p>No, he\u2019s grinning.</p><p>There\u2019s something else in his eyes. I think I know what it is because it more than likely mirrors my own eyes right now, but I could be wrong.</p><p>I\u2019m not exactly the most experienced when it comes to men.</p><p>And Jordan and me right now? Not a good idea. No matter how sweet, funny, and gorgeous he might be. Yes, he is the epitome of sex. So freaking hot. I bet he\u2019s amazing in bed. I can only imagine what he looks like under those clothes of his...</p><p>I hear a low chuckle, and it snaps me out of my sex thoughts. I realize I\u2019ve been ogling his body like a pervert.</p><p>Great. Just great.</p><p>My face flushes bright red. \u201cSomething funny?\u201d I snap.</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d Shaking his head, he flashes me a glimpse of his white teeth.</p><p>I tilt my head to the side with my hands on my hips. \u201cSo, why exactly are you laughing at me?\u201d</p><p>His eyes flicker down my body, then back up again. I feel it, like he\u2019s just run his hands all over me.</p><p>\u201cFor a tiny thing, you sure can be feisty.\u201d</p><p>Arguing the tiny part would be a moot point because I am vertically challenged. But a \u2018thing\u2019? Hmm ... I don\u2019t think so.</p><p>I fold my arms over my chest and straighten my back. \u201cI\u2019m not a thing.\u201d</p><p>He eyes me for a long moment. His face suddenly a blank canvas. Then he leans down and says close to my ear, \u201cBad choice of words. You\u2019re right. You are most definitely not a thing. You, Mia ... are most definitely a woman.\u201d</p><p>My stomach jolts, and I can\u2019t help the gasp that escapes me. I press my thighs together.</p><p>From the laugh and cocky look on his face, he totally knows the effect he just had on me.</p><p>It annoys me.</p><p>And turns me on.</p><p>In equal parts.</p><p>Smiling, he runs a hand through his hair. \u201cFine. We\u2019ll do this your way. You can pay for the gas.\u201d</p><p>What?</p><p>What were we talking about again?</p><p>Oh, yeah. Paying for gas.</p><p>Wow. Well ... that was easy.</p><p>I\u2019ve never in my life won an argument. And that instantly makes me suspicious.</p><p>I narrow my gaze on him. \u201cWhy are you giving in so easy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy are you questioning it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause ... uh ... because...\u201d Because this isn\u2019t life as I know it. \u201cBecause the men I know don\u2019t back down so easy.\u201d They don\u2019t back down ever.</p><p>Sorrow flickers briefly in his eyes. I hate the way it makes me feel.</p><p>Exposed and vulnerable.</p><p>The two things I really do not want to feel right now.</p><p>\u201cMen you knew, Mia,\u201d he says. \u201cNot me. And surprisingly, I can compromise. Not all the time, so don\u2019t go getting used to it.\u201d He grins. \u201cI just don\u2019t want to spend the next however long disagreeing with you over this when I know I\u2019m gonna end up giving into you anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause?\u201d</p><p>Taking a step back, his arms fold over his broad chest.</p><p>\u201cBecause you\u2019re a hard girl to say no to.\u201d</p><p>Oh. Okay then.</p><p>I suddenly feel lightheaded.</p><p>And light-hearted.</p><p>\u201cSo are you going to take this win and get back in the car?\u201d He sweeps a hand in the direction of the Mustang. \u201cOr are you going to stand here all day being stubborn about it?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I bite the smile that\u2019s forcing its way onto my lips. \u201cWell, I\u2019m not one to gloat.\u201d I throw him a smug grin as I walk past him, destination Mustang.</p><p>He\u2019s quiet behind me. I only know he\u2019s following from the crunch of the gravel under his feet.</p><p>\u201cDid you know you swing your ass when you walk?\u201d</p><p>What?</p> <p>I stop, shocked that he\u2019s just said that about my ass. And also a little turned on hearing him talk about my ass.</p><p>Turned on. Again.</p><p>Jesus.</p><p>I didn\u2019t actually know that I swing my ass when I walk, but that\u2019s beside the point. I scowl at him over my shoulder. \u201cAnd your point is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo point. Just an observation.\u201d He holds his hands up in surrender, and his eyes crinkle from the smile on his face. \u201cIt\u2019s kinda cute is all.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCute?\u201d I frown, ignoring the pull I feel for him in my lower half. \u201cI\u2019m not cute.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never said you were cute. I said your ass-swinging was cute.\u201d He gives me a wicked grin.</p><p>My face goes beet red. Embarrassed, I start walking again, ignoring his soft laughter behind me.</p><p>By the time I\u2019ve reached his car, I\u2019m feeling out of sorts. Vulnerable, edgy...</p><p>Horny.</p><p>Totally not how I expected to be feeling this morning. Jordan just seems able to throw me off kilter at any given notice. I\u2019ve never known anyone like him.</p> <p>And today, things between us have shifted. I\u2019m not really sure where to, or what\u2019s going on, but something is definitely different between us.</p><p>We get in the car at the same time. I buckle up as Jordan turns the ignition. The engine is rumbling, ready to go, but we don\u2019t move.</p><p>I look across at him.</p><p>His head is tilted my way, his deep eyes staring at me, and he\u2019s wearing an expression I can\u2019t decipher.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I ask, feeling self-conscious. I push my short strands behind my ear, feeling myself heating under his stare.</p><p>He shakes his head, blinking himself free. \u201cNothing. I\u2019m just really digging this assertive side of you.\u201d A smile. Then he looks behind him and sets the car in reverse.</p><p>I\u2019m left reeling.</p><p>Jordan digs me.</p> <p>He digs me.</p><p>And just like that, the cold block of ice I carry around in my chest melts.</p><p>Jordan does most of the talking on the drive to Farmington. I think he\u2019s doing it to keep my mind busy, and off what I\u2019m going to Farmington for.</p><p>I was good until we got about ten minutes away from Farmington. I broke out in a cold sweat, and when we crossed the city limits a few minutes back, my heart went into overdrive. I\u2019m pretty sure a panic attack is on the horizon.</p><p>It takes me a moment to realize the car has stopped.</p><p>\u201cAre we here?\u201d My eyes are wide and alert like a rabbit.</p><p>\u201cA block away. I thought you might want a moment to yourself before we go to her house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt might not be her.\u201d</p><p>I look at him. I know there\u2019s an edge of desperation in my eyes and voice.</p><p>\u201cIt might not be,\u201d he says slowly. \u201cBut if it is?\u201d</p><p>I shrug, forcing a casualness I don\u2019t feel. \u201cThen I\u2019ve found my mother.\u201d</p><p>We both stare ahead, sitting in silence.</p><p>\u201cYou ready?\u201d he asks.</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>Jordan turns the engine on and pulls back out onto the street. A few minutes later he pulls up front a red brick house.</p><p>I turn to him. \u201cWill you come with me?\u201d</p><p>He smiles. \u201cAlready was.\u201d</p><p>Taking a deep breath, I slip my sunglass on and climb out the car.</p><p>I hesitate at the top of the walk. Jordan takes my hand and tugs me forward.</p><p>Reaching the door, Jordan doesn\u2019t let go of my hand as he leans across me and presses the bell. The scent of his aftershave momentarily soothes me.</p><p>\u201cWhat do I say?\u201d I whisper.</p><p>\u201cJust ask if Anna Monroe lives here, and we\u2019ll go from there.\u201d</p><p>Meeting his eyes, I nod.</p><p>Then I hear footsteps in the hall. A figure approaches the door. My body freezes. Jordan gives my hand a reassuring squeeze.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re okay. I\u2019m here,\u201d he whispers softly.</p><p>The door opens, revealing a Chinese lady.</p><p>Nope. Not her.</p><p>Is it strange that I feel relief at this thought?</p><p>There\u2019s definitely not a trace of Chinese in my pale skin, blonde hair and blue eyes. Unless she\u2019s not Anna Monroe.</p><p>I just need her to confirm this, and then I\u2019m out of here.</p><p>\u201cCan I help you?\u201d she asks, eyes moving between Jordan and me.</p><p>\u201cI was, um\u2014\u201d I clear my throat. \u201cI, um...\u201d Why can\u2019t I get my voice to work?</p><p>\u201cDoes Anna Monroe live here?\u201d Jordan\u2019s voice come from beside me.</p><p>She blinks from me to Jordan. \u201cYes,\u201d she answers slowly.</p><p>\u201cWould it be possible to speak with her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you are...?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry. My name is Jordan, and this is Mia.\u201d</p><p>She shifts on the spot, crossing her arms over her chest. \u201cI\u2019m Anna Monroe.\u201d</p><p>I exhale the breath I didn\u2019t realize I was holding, and then I\u2019m out of there. Turning, and pulling my hand free from Jordan\u2019s, I run down that path away from them both.</p><p>I know it\u2019s wrong for me to abandon Jordan, but I can\u2019t stop my legs from moving.</p><p>My heart is pounding. Blood is roaring in my ears. And all I want to do is eat.</p><p>And throw up.</p><p>I really need to throw up.</p><p>Climbing back into the safety of Jordan\u2019s Mustang, I yank my sunglasses off, and sit on my hands, trying to steady my heart and calm the war raging on inside me.</p><p>Jordan gets in the car a few minutes later. He turns to me. \u201cSo ... she\u2019s not your mom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat gave it away?\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m at an impasse at the moment. I either laugh or cry. I really don\u2019t want to cry in front of Jordan, so laughter it is. It bursts out of me. I know I\u2019m probably coming off as a little crazy, but I can\u2019t seem to stop, or find the will to care.</p><p>When I finally regain control of myself, wiping my eyes dry on my hands, I find Jordan staring at me with an expression on his face that I\u2019ve never seen before.</p><p>No one has ever looked at me like he is looking at me right now. Like he cares. Really cares.</p><p>He relaxes his gaze, a wicked grin sliding onto his lips. \u201cYou seem to be taking the disappointment well.\u201d</p><p>His smile has me laughing again.</p><p>\u201cSorry, I abandoned you back there.\u201d I gesture, still a little breathless from my crazy laughing.</p><p>\u201cNo worries. Come on.\u201d He starts the car. \u201cLet\u2019s go grab some lunch.\u201d</p><p>Food. Not a good idea for me right now.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not hungry.\u201d I put my seatbelt on.</p><p>\u201cWell, I am. You can watch me eat.\u201d He flashes me those whites of his, and I\u2019m too dazzled by him to disagree.</p><p>We end up in a coffee shop that Jordan seems to know well. Apparently, this place make the best Key Lime pie in the world.</p><p>I\u2019ll have to take his word on it because eating right now is not a good idea, not while I\u2019m with Jordan. I\u2019m afraid that if I start, I won\u2019t be able to stop, and then I\u2019ll end up exposing a part of myself that I never want anyone to see, especially not him.</p><p>\u201cGuess it was a waste of time coming all the way out here.\u201d I sigh.</p><p>\u201cDepends on how you look at it.\u201d</p><p>I rest my elbow on the table and prop my chin on my hand. \u201cAnd how would you look at it?\u201d</p><p>He leans back in his seat. \u201cThat it\u2019s one less Anna Monroe on the list. Narrows the odds. Leaves us with two. So that\u2019s a fifty/fifty chance on the next one we pick being your mother.\u201d</p><p>Or neither are her.</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019m getting to eat the pie I love. I\u2019d call it a lose/win.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you assess everything that way?\u201d</p><p>His eyes darken. \u201cNot everything.\u201d His lips lift with a flirtatious tilt as he leans closer, over the table. He lowers his voice. \u201cOnly things that I know are a sure thing. And when I really want something ... I get it.\u201d</p><p>Gulp. Heat infuses my skin, firing off my pulse.</p><p>The waitress interrupts our moment, arriving with our coffee and Jordan\u2019s pie.</p><p>I\u2019m relieved.</p><p>And disappointed.</p><p>He was absolutely, definitely flirting with me then.</p><p>I\u2019m not complaining. It\u2019s nice to have someone as gorgeous as Jordan flirt with me. I guess what bothers me is that I don\u2019t know what it means for him. Or more so, what I want it to mean for me.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s your pie?\u201d I ask, watching him dig into it like it\u2019s god made.</p><p>\u201cSo good,\u201d he murmurs through a mouthful. The sound is as delicious as he looks. \u201cYou wanna try?\u201d He holds out a pie-filled fork.</p><p>I shake my head.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re missing out on the best pie you\u2019ll ever taste.\u201d He waggles the fork in front of my face.</p><p>Laughing, I shake my head again.</p><p>He grins and puts the fork in this mouth, letting out an over-exaggerated groan of pleasure.</p><p>For a split second, I actually wish I was the fork.</p><p>I have serious issues.</p><p>I pour some sugar in my coffee. \u201cThanks for coming with me today. It really means a lot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re friends. Friends help each other out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re friends?\u201d I tease, unable to help the smile that\u2019s crept on my face.</p><p>He lifts a dark brow. \u201cHadn\u2019t we already established that?\u201d</p><p>I bring the cup to my lips and blow on the hot coffee. \u201cI don\u2019t think it had been confirmed, no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, consider it confirmed.\u201d He digs his fork in his pie, eyes smiling. \u201cWe\u2019re friends.\u201d</p><p>With benefits?</p><p>Holy cow, I can\u2019t believe I just thought that.</p><p>\u201cWell, well ... Jordan Matthews. Didn\u2019t expect to ever see you here again.\u201d</p><p>I turn my head and see a guy about Jordan\u2019s height and build, shaved head, arms sleeved with tattoos, heading in our direction.</p><p>My eyes move beyond him, and see two other guys walking behind, both tall and skinny.</p><p>From the corner of my eye, I can see that Jordan\u2019s whole demeanor has changed. His body is rigid, tense.</p><p>The air instantly prickles with discomfort, and the sound of Jordan\u2019s fork clattering to the plate makes me jump.</p><p>\u201cTurn the fuck around and walk away, Donnie,\u201d Jordan hisses, the level of anger in his voice surprises me.</p><p>Donnie lets out a laugh. He grabs a chair from the empty table by us and sits down, his front to its back.</p><p>On closer inspection, I spy a tattoo on Donnie\u2019s neck. It says Fuck You.</p><p>Nice</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s no way to greet an old friend,\u201d he says.</p><p>Jordan laughs a hollow sound. \u201cThat\u2019s the last thing I\u2019d ever refer to you as.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re breaking my heart here, Matthews.\u201d Donnie slaps a hand over his chest before moving his gaze to me. \u201cAnd who do we have here?\u201d</p><p>The way he looks at me sets alarm bells ringing in my head. I\u2019m familiar with the look. I\u2019ve seen it before from Forbes.</p><p>I curl my fingers together in my lap.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t answer that.\u201d My eyes shoot up to Jordan\u2019s. He stares at me for a long second, trying to convey something in his eyes that I can\u2019t quite grasp. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He turns his head to Donnie. \u201cDon\u2019t fuckin\u2019 talk to her again, or I\u2019ll\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll what?\u201d Donnie tilts his head to the side. \u201cWhat ya gonna do, Jordan? Set your daddy on me?\u201d</p><p>Jordan\u2019s jaw sets rigid. \u201cYour issue is with me,\u201d he grinds out. \u201cSo say whatever the fuck it is you need to say, then fuck off back to your cave, you sorry piece of shit. Just leave her out of it.\u201d</p><p>Donnie lets out another laugh. \u201cJeez! Easy now. You must actually like this chick. Never thought I\u2019d see the day. Isn\u2019t your motto \u2018fuck \u2019em slow, leave \u2019em fast\u2019? Gotta say though, can\u2019t blame you with this one ... she is fuck hot.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLike your girlfriend was,\u201d Jordan bites out.</p><p>Donnie\u2019s face goes hard like granite, and for a moment I think he\u2019s going to hit Jordan.</p><p>Instead, his eyes slide back to me. He gives my body a full perverse perusal. It makes my stomach turn. \u201cBitch, when he\u2019s done with you, you pay me a visit, and I\u2019ll show you a good time.\u201d</p><p>Jordan jerks out of his chair, causing it to bang to the floor, bringing mine, and every eye in this place, to him.</p><p>\u201cI said, leave her the fuck out of it!\u201d Jordan is bristling anger.</p> <p>Donnie slowly gets to his feet, shifting his chair aside.</p><p>A glance to his friends tells me they\u2019re standing too. The situation feels dangerous. My insides start to tremble with the possibility of what\u2019s going to happen.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d Jordan\u2019s harsh voice comes my way as he jerks out a hand for me to take.</p><p>I look at Donnie who is staring hard at Jordan. I slip my hand into Jordan\u2019s, allowing him to pull me to my feet.</p><p>The instant my skin makes contact with his, I feel the true level of Jordan\u2019s anger. It\u2019s rolling off him in waves and seeping straight into me.</p><p>Surprisingly, I don\u2019t feel afraid. I don\u2019t worry as to what will happen when we leave here, and I\u2019m alone with him. What I actually feel right now is something I\u2019ve never felt before.</p> <p>I feel safe in his hands.</p><p>I know without a doubt that Jordan won\u2019t hurt me. And I know unequivocally that he won\u2019t let anything happen to me.</p><p>Jordan pulls on my hand, leading me through the coffee shop, away from Donnie, and toward the exit.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s your dad doing nowadays?\u201d Donnie calls out.</p><p>Jordan stops abruptly. I crash into his back. His hand tightens around mine gripping it to the point of almost pain.</p><p>\u201cHeard he lost his badge. Real shame that, quality fuckin\u2019 pig that he was.\u201d</p><p>Jordan turns, putting me behind him.</p><p>Donnie and his buddies are in the middle of the coffee shop now. Only a few tables parting them from us. I can tell from their stances and body language that they are itching for a fight. And by the way Jordan is bristling beside me, it seems like he\u2019s going to give them one.</p> <p>\u201cI bet you really wanna hit me right now, don\u2019t ya?\u201d Donnie smirks. \u201cHow does this sound \u2013 I\u2019ll let you have the first hit. Just you and me, one on one. Whaddya say? Winner gets your girl.\u201d</p><p>Donnie tilts his head my way, the look in his eyes repulsive.</p><p>He thinks he\u2019s affecting me. He\u2019s wrong. I was raised by worse. But he is affecting Jordan. I can feel how tightly wound he is.</p><p>Jordan pushes his hand into his jean pocket, then presses what feels like car keys into my palm.</p><p>I look up at him, confused.</p><p>\u201cGo to my car,\u201d he says with a low voice. \u201cGet in and lock all the doors. If I\u2019m not out in five minutes, drive straight back to Durango. Don\u2019t go to the hotel. Go to the diner, to Beth.\u201d</p><p>I curl my hand around the keys. \u201cAnd then what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd then...\u201d He shakes his head slowly.</p><p>Self-preservation is telling me to do what he\u2019s saying and leave this coffee shop, but I\u2019ve never been very good at listening to my self-preservation.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not leaving here without you.\u201d I lift my chin and put my hand on his arm.</p><p>I\u2019m purposely and willingly touching a man filled with anger. That\u2019s a really big thing for me. Huge, in fact.</p><p>Jordan\u2019s eyes flare, but it doesn\u2019t deter me. \u201cDon\u2019t give him what he wants. You don\u2019t have to fight this guy.\u201d</p><p>His eyes close as if he\u2019s in pain. \u201cYou don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you gonna stop whispering sweet nothings to the hot piece of ass, and let us get this over with?\u201d Donnie cracks his knuckles.</p><p>Jordan\u2019s eyes leave me, and go straight to Donnie, hardening on him.</p><p>I see the other patrons heading out the back door.</p><p>\u201cLeave now or I\u2019m calling the police!\u201d a shaky female voice, assumedly the waitress, says from behind us.</p><p>\u201cYou do that, sweet cheeks,\u201d Donnie laughs. \u201cI\u2019ll be done with him before they even arrive.\u201d</p><p>Ignoring everyone else, I keep my focus on Jordan. \u201cJordan.\u201d He looks back to me. \u201cI might not understand, but I don\u2019t need to because I know that violence never solves anything. It won\u2019t solve whatever this is.\u201d</p><p>He stares down at me. I can see a war raging in his eyes.</p><p>After what feels like forever, he exhales. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>I nearly cry out with relief when he takes my hand and shifts the car keys back to his.</p><p>\u201cNot today, Donnie.\u201d He turns, walking away, taking me with him.</p><p>\u201cWhat? You\u2019re leaving! You\u2019re a fuckin\u2019 pussy, Matthews! A motherfucking pussy!\u201d</p><p>My heart is beating so hard, afraid that Donnie won\u2019t simply let Jordan walk away from this and that he\u2019ll come after him.</p><p>Jordan pulls some bills from his pocket and drops them down on the counter as we pass by the wide-eyed waitress. \u201cI\u2019m real sorry for the trouble, ma\u2019am.\u201d</p><p>Then we are of out of there.</p><p>I glance over my shoulder to see if Donnie is following us. He\u2019s not.</p><p>Jordan squeezes my hand, pulling my attention back. \u201cHe won\u2019t follow us. Despite his bravado, he\u2019s a fuckin\u2019 pussy. He challenged me in there because he wants an audience. He wants me to hit him first so he can get what he thinks is his revenge.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t question what that revenge is. Jordan will tell me if he wants to.</p><p>We\u2019re back at the Mustang in record time. He unlocks it, letting me in.</p><p>I\u2019ve just clipped my seatbelt when I hear the sound of Jordan yelling. Seatbelt off, I\u2019m back out of the car just in time to see Jordan\u2019s fist connecting with the wooden fence by the parking space. \u201cFUCK! Motherfucking fuck!\u201d</p><p>Normally, in a situation like this I would be paralyzed by fear, but not with him. My feet carry me toward Jordan without a second thought.</p><p>He\u2019s standing with his forehead pressed to the fence he just beat on and his hand clutched to his heaving chest.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d I ask softly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t look it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell I am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I take a look at your hand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you just punched a fence and the med student in me wants to make sure it\u2019s okay.\u201d</p><p>He tilts his face in my direction. The look on his face is hard. His eyes cold. The warmth I\u2019m used to gone.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need you to fix me, Mia.\u201d</p><p>I feel my face flush under the harsh sting of his words.</p><p>Clearing my suddenly full throat, I say, \u201cI\u2019m not trying to fix you. I just want to make sure you haven\u2019t broken any bones. Nothing more.\u201d</p><p>His eyes close on a long blink.</p><p>Stepping away from the fence, he moves toward me and holds his injured hand out.</p><p>I take it in my own, ignoring the rush of sensation I feel, and begin checking his hand, making sure he hasn\u2019t broken anything.</p><p>\u201cAll fine.\u201d I look up at him a few moments later. \u201cIt\u2019s just going to be swollen and bruised for a few days. Could do with some ice on it, and we need to clean that out.\u201d I run my fingertip over the small graze on his knuckle.</p><p>I lift my eyes to his, finding Jordan already staring down at me with dark eyes. The air instantly shifts. My pulse quickens. Fireflies swarm my stomach, setting my insides on fire.</p><p>And what do I do?</p><p>I release his hand and step back, putting space between us.</p><p>I might not be afraid of Jordan, but I know what anger and sex combined can mean to a man.</p><p>Not that Jordan and I will be having sex. I just don\u2019t want to confuse an already confusing situation.</p><p>He flexes his fingers out. \u201cAll you seem to do is fix us Matthew men up.\u201d I notice his voice sounds gruff.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t mind.\u201d I shrug.</p><p>\u201cMia...\u201d He rubs his good hand over his hair, exhaling heavily. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I lost it just then. There\u2019s just a real big ugly history with me and Donnie. It\u2019s no excuse, but it was either that fence or his face. And better the fence, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d I smile. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think the fence would agree with you.\u201d I poke my index finger through the hole his anger has left in it.</p><p>Jordan\u2019s body starts to shake with silent laughter. His eyes smile at me.</p><p>I let out a little laugh. \u201cDo you want to talk about it?\u201d</p><p>His humor quickly dissipates. He stares at the ground for a long moment. \u201cNo,\u201d he says, lifting his head. \u201cRight now, I just wanna get drunk.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s pretty early to be drinking ... but what the hell. I can call day drinking part of the new me.</p><p>\u201cI could go for that.\u201d I smile.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s my girl.\u201d He grins.</p><p>His girl?</p><p>His girl.</p><p>We drive back to Durango and head straight into town where the bars are. Jordan says he\u2019ll leave his car there and pick it up in the morning, so we\u2019ll be getting a cab back to the hotel when we\u2019re done.</p><p>I\u2019ve never done anything like this before \u2013 going to a bar in the afternoon with the intention of getting drunk.</p><p>I\u2019m kind of excited. Okay, I\u2019m freaking thrilled. I feel like a rebel.</p><p>Sad, but true.</p><p>Jordan has brought me to a bar aptly called \u2018The Bar\u2019. I\u2019m sitting at a table in the back. Jordan\u2019s gone to get us some drinks. This round is his.</p><p>The next is definitely mine.</p><p>He comes back with four shots in his hands, two beer bottle under his arm. I guess we\u2019re starting big.</p><p>\u201cTequila,\u201d he says, putting two of the shots down in front of me.</p><p>I\u2019ve never tried tequila, but what the hell. This is the new Mia. The new Mia could be a tequila drinker.</p><p>I pick up one of the shot glasses, but his voice stops me. \u201cSalt first.\u201d</p><p>Taking the seat across from me, Jordan picks up the salt shaker from the table.</p><p>\u201cHand,\u201d he says.</p><p>I hold my right hand out to him.</p><p>When he takes hold, my body instantly fires on all cylinders, the traction heading straight to the right parts of my anatomy.</p><p>He pours a line of salt on the side of my hand and says, \u201cLick.\u201d</p><p>Jesus Christ. That sounded really hot.</p><p>I could really get into this tequila drinking. Especially if I get to hear Jordan talk to me like that.</p><p>Doing as told, I lean my mouth down to my hand and lick the salt off. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Jordan\u2019s eyes haven\u2019t moved from me. I see them flare the moment my tongue touches the salt.</p><p>I may or may not make the most of the moment, taking my time licking the salt from my hand.</p><p>I kind of like the affect it has on him.</p><p>When the salt is safely in my mouth, dissolving away, Jordan says in a really hoarse voice, \u201cNow, drink the shot.\u201d</p> <p>I pick one of the shot glasses up. Glass to my lips, I down the tequila.</p><p>\u201cHoly crap!\u201d I\u2019m breathing fire. I place the back of my hand to my damp lips, my eyes watering from the burn.</p><p>Jordan laughs. \u201cChase it with the beer, it\u2019ll take the edge off. I forgot to bring the lime over.\u201d</p><p>I take a big mouthful of beer.</p><p>My eyes are still watering, so I run my fingers under them catching the leaks.</p> <p>\u201cNot a tequila drinker?\u201d He grins.</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cThis is the first time I\u2019ve had it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what do you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTastes like crap.\u201d I grin. \u201cBut it does the job. Am I drinking alone?\u201d I nod at his untouched drinks.</p><p>He shakes his head, then makes quick work of his own salt licking. He throws back his shot with far more ease than I just did.</p><p>Glass down, his eyes smile brightly at me.</p> <p>I lean back in my chair, taking my beer bottle with me, and start picking at the label. \u201cYou look like a seasoned pro at that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe tequila?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm.\u201d I nod.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a hard liquor man. What can I say.\u201d He grins and picks the salt shaker up. \u201cYou want another hit?\u201d</p><p>I flinch. He notices.</p><p>\u201cI meant the salt, Mia. Do you want another hit of salt for your next shot?\u201d</p><p>I shift, embarrassed. My face burns with my shame. \u201cUh ... yes.\u201d Biting my lip, I hold my hand out to him.</p><p>Instead of pouring the salt, Jordan encases my hand in his. Normally I would feel intimidated by this, but with Jordan, I don\u2019t. His hold feels safe, gentle ... kind.</p> <p>For the first time in my life, I\u2019m with a man who literally has me in his hand, and I don\u2019t feel fear.</p><p>Instead, I find myself feeling connected to another human being in a way I never thought possible.</p><p>Releasing his hold a little, he turns my hand over and runs his thumb over my palm. It leaves a delicious trail of sensation in its wake.</p><p>My emotions start to tilt on their axis, and straight in his direction.</p><p>Lifting my eyes, Jordan\u2019s gaze instantly captures mine. Without moving his eyes from me, he runs his fingers to my wrist, guiding my hand to the side.</p><p>He slides his hand back along mine. Palm to palm. His fingers gently rest against my pulse point.</p><p>I can only hope he can\u2019t feel that it\u2019s practically beating the blood out of my body.</p><p>Tilting the salt shaker over our joined hands, he runs two lines of salt. One on mine. One on his.</p><p>\u201cDo you mind if I...?\u201d He tilts his head in the direction of our connected hands.</p><p>Unsure of the question, I raise a questioning brow.</p><p>\u201cThe salt?\u201d</p><p>Still lost, I just nod my head, not wanting to come across as stupid. Hoping that by agreeing, I don\u2019t end up looking stupid.</p><p>Then Jordan does something that I will forever remember as the most insanely intimate moment of my life.</p><p>And his question makes perfect sense when he leans forward and licks the salt from my hand. Slowly.</p><p>Holy. Crap.</p><p>Head still lowered, he looks up at me through long dark lashes with a look that turns me to mush.</p><p>\u201cYour turn.\u201d</p><p>What? He wants me to lick the salt from his hand?</p><p>Holy Jesus.</p><p>This is a really sexy thing to do. I\u2019m not sexy. I have no clue how to do sexy.</p><p>No, come on, I can do this. New Mia here. I can lick salt from Jordan\u2019s hand. No big deal.</p><p>Taking in a breath, I lean forward and sticking the tip of my tongue out, I lick the salt up onto my tongue.</p><p>All I can taste is him. The salt doesn\u2019t even register. And now I\u2019m begrudged to drink the tequila and take away his taste in my mouth.</p><p>\u201cDrink,\u201d he says, his voice sounding husky.</p><p>Glass to my lips, I tip the shot back at exactly the same time as he does.</p><p>His hand leaves mine.</p><p>I\u2019m left feeling bereft without his touch, dizzy from the alcohol, and wondering if that just actually happened.</p><p>My hands start to fidget of their own accord. I reach for my beer.</p><p>\u201cSecond time easier?\u201d Jordan asks, sounding completely normal as though we haven\u2019t just licked salt of one another\u2019s hands. Or maybe this is just what normal people do. What do I know?</p><p>Clearing my throat, I force a casualness I don\u2019t feel. \u201cMuch easier.\u201d</p><p>He smiles.</p><p>I start in on my beer label again.</p><p>\u201cSo...\u201d he says.</p><p>\u201cSo...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess I should explain about earlier, what happened in the coffee shop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly if you want to.\u201d</p><p>He gives a tight-lipped smile. \u201cYou remember I told you I used to gamble?\u201d</p><p>I nod.</p><p>His eyes lower. \u201cAfter my mom had died, I went off the rails. I\u2019d always liked to play cards ... but this went further. I was playing, gambling way more than I ever had. I was winning for a while, then the losing streak kicked in. I kept trying to make back what I lost, but before I knew it, I\u2019d run up a massive debt that I had no way of paying back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou owed the money to Donnie?\u201d</p><p>He laughs a humorless sound. \u201cNo, Donnie\u2019s just the hired monkey. I owed money to the guy he works for \u2013 Max. I used to regular a few places in Farmington to play, then I got involved in a poker ring that Max ran. There\u2019s not much in the way here for card players like me. Like I was,\u201d he corrects. \u201cBut over in Farmington ... there\u2019s plenty for a seasoned player.\u201d He leans close, elbows on the table as he scrubs his hands over his face.</p><p>He folds his arms on the table, looking down. \u201cI\u2019m just real sorry that you got pulled in it back there, Mia.\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s why he didn\u2019t want me to tell Donnie my name. He didn\u2019t want those horrible people knowing who I am. He was trying to protect me.</p><p>Something about that touches me.</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter. I\u2019m just glad you\u2019re okay now.\u201d I put my beer down. \u201cDo you still owe the money? Is that why he was trying to pick a fight with you?\u201d</p><p>If he does, I\u2019ll pay his debt. It\u2019s not like I can\u2019t afford it. He\u2019s been so good to me, helping me with the Anna stuff, and I can finally do something good with Oliver\u2019s money. Helping Jordan would count as something good to me.</p><p>\u201cNo, my debt was paid.\u201d He scrubs his hand over his face again. \u201cMy dad. He used the money from my mom\u2019s life insurance.\u201d</p><p>Oh. Right.</p><p>Now I know where his guilt comes from.</p><p>I try to conjure up something worthy to say, something to make him feel better, but I come up with nothing. So I say the only thing I can, \u201cI\u2019m so sorry, Jordan.\u201d</p><p>He takes a long drink of his beer. Drying off his mouth with the back of his hand, he shakes his head. \u201cDon\u2019t feel bad for me. I don\u2019t deserve your kindness.\u201d His eyes close on a long blink. \u201cDo you remember I told you that my dad used to be a cop?\u201d</p><p>I nod and take a drink of beer.</p><p>\u201cBefore the debt was paid, before my dad knew about any of it, the gambling and how deep in I was, I was out one night in town. Not in this bar,\u201d he adds like that would have some bearing on his story. \u201cI was out drinking with some buddies of mine, and later on in the night I was ... uh, leaving the bar with ... a girl.\u201d He scratches his cheek, looking uncomfortable.</p><p>I ignore the unpleasant twist in my stomach brought on by the knowledge of Jordan leaving a bar with a girl he more than likely wanted to have sex with.</p><p>\u201cWe were headed to get a cab, when I was jumped by Donnie and a couple of his guys. It was meant to a warning beating because I hadn\u2019t paid up, but I made the mistake of fighting back, instead of just taking it \u2013 I\u2019m not one to take a beating.\u201d He shrugs. \u201cAnd I ... mid-fight, to antagonize him ... kind of told Donnie that I\u2019d had sex with his girlfriend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHad you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Stomach twist. \u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was a one-time thing. A mistake.\u201d He sighs. \u201cBut after telling him ... well, that was when Donnie pulled out a baseball bat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDear god.\u201d I wince, closing my eyes, feeling his pain as if was my own. I know how bad beatings can be. Especially when a weapon is involved.</p><p>\u201cAnyway.\u201d He drags his hand through his hair. \u201cThe girl ran back to the bar while it was happening, got my friends out to help me, called the cops...\u201d</p><p>I see the rest in his eyes. \u201cYour dad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. He lost his shit when he saw the state they had left me in. The bastards had fucked off the second they heard sirens, but my dad didn\u2019t let up. He eventually found Donnie a couple of blocks over, and...\u201d He lets out a long sigh. \u201c...he beat the shit out of Donnie\u2014who was unarmed by this point. He\u2019d dropped the bat running. My dad hurt him. Really hurt him. Left him in a bad way.\u201d</p><p>Jordan\u2019s eyes search out mine. \u201cYou gotta understand, Mia ... my dad ... he\u2019s not violent by nature. It\u2019s just not who is. He\u2019s a great guy \u2013 really great. The best. And he deserves a kid better than me. It was just ... well, Mom hadn\u2019t long since passed, and I\u2019m his only child. I guess he just lost it when he saw me.\u201d</p><p>I nod, letting him know I understand. I only wish I\u2019d had a dad as caring and protective as Jordan\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cDad was suspended pending investigation.\u201d He leans back in his chair and rubs his eye. \u201cAfter the investigation, he was found guilty and stripped of his badge and gun. He can\u2019t ever work in law enforcement again \u2013 courtesy of my fuck-up.\u201d He lifts his bottle in mock-cheers, then presses it to his lips and tips his head back.</p><p>\u201cDid anything happen to Donnie for what he did to you?\u201d</p><p>Jordan lets out a hollow laugh. \u201cHe got a twelve month suspended sentence.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you still had to pay off the debt you owed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. Just because Donnie and his boys kicked my ass, didn\u2019t make the debt with Max go away. So dad lost out again. Bailed me out plus \u2018interest\u2019. I started attending Gamblers Anonymous and got clean. I still attend the meetings now.\u201d His eyes seek mine out as though it really matters to him that I know this. \u201cAnd now we\u2019re flat broke, trying to keep a failing hotel afloat, and Donnie is still out for my blood for what my dad did to him. And because I screwed his now ex-girlfriend.\u201d He gives a weak smile as he puts his bottle down.</p><p>Ignoring the third ache of pain I feel at Jordan\u2019s crass words over his past sexual activity, I lean forward, placing my arms on the table. \u201cI really am sorry this happened to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt didn\u2019t happen to me. Everything that happened was my own fault. I fucked up my life and took my dad down with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour life is not fucked up, and you definitely didn\u2019t take your dad down with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is. And I did. I\u2019m not a good person, Mia.\u201d He shakes his head, leaning back in his seat. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I can feel him withdrawing from me. I don\u2019t like the way it feels.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been good to me,\u201d I press.</p><p>He lets out a hollow laugh. \u201cYou\u2019re probably the only person on this planet who can say that.\u201d His eyes fix me with a stare. \u201cAnd I haven\u2019t really done that much for you, Mia. Not really.\u201d He looks away from me. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing good about me, believe me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think there is a lot that\u2019s good about you,\u201d I push back.</p> <p>So much. Too much.</p><p>His eyes come back to me. Dark and angry. \u201cDid you not hear what I said before? I completely screwed everything up. I fucked up my dad\u2019s life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Everything your dad did was his choice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs a result of my actions.\u201d I can see his anger rising.</p><p>This is normally the point where I back down, give in, and agree \u2013 not that I would have ever argued this far. But with Jordan I know I can, and I\u2019m not backing down. Not this time.</p> <p>\u201cEveryone is responsible for their own actions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI fuck random women all the time. I use them for sex, then discard them like trash.\u201d</p><p>My breath catches in my throat, and a jealousy I shouldn\u2019t feel hits me with a harsh wallop.</p><p>Jordan grabs his beer and takes a long drink. His eyes don\u2019t leave mine for a moment, almost like he\u2019s daring me to look away, but I don\u2019t ... I can\u2019t.</p><p>His confession just doesn\u2019t fit with the Jordan I\u2019ve gotten to know. But then when do you really ever know anyone?</p><p>I, better than anyone, know that.</p> <p>But the thing annoying me most is the stupid little voice on repeat in my head. The voice that wonders why, if Jordan does what he says he does, hasn\u2019t he hit on me?</p><p>I hate that I think this. I shouldn\u2019t want him to hit on me, but I did ... do.</p><p>I can feel my skin prickling.</p><p>Tapping my fingertips on the table, I swallow down my feelings. \u201cAnd your point is?\u201d</p><p>My response surprises him. I see it in the widening of his eyes.</p><p>Trying to hide his surprise, he straightens his back like he\u2019s gearing up for round two.</p><p>\u201cMy point is ... I\u2019m responsible for those actions. They\u2019re not the actions of a good person.\u201d</p><p>He wants me to dislike him. Why?</p> <p>I shrug, forcing a casual I don\u2019t feel. Then using his earlier words against him, I simply say, \u201cDepends on how you look at it.\u201d</p><p>His eyebrows lift.</p><p>I\u2019ve got his attention now.</p><p>He leans close, arms perched on the table. \u201cAnd how are you looking at it, Mia?\u201d</p><p>God, I totally love how he says my name.</p><p>\u201cWell ... the way I see it, you\u2019re a lose/win. I\u2019ve known men who do far worse things than just sleep around with lots of different women.\u201d</p><p>Okay, so Forbes did that too \u2013 but that\u2019s not going to help make my point, so I\u2019ll just eclipse the fact.</p><p>His brow furrows. \u201cYour ex?\u201d</p><p>I take a deep breath. \u201cThe black eye wasn\u2019t the first time he hit me.\u201d I rub the instant chills from my arms.</p><p>I see Jordan\u2019s jaw tighten. \u201cHow often?\u201d His words come out punchy.</p><p>\u201cUm...\u201d I lift my suddenly heavy shoulders, my confidence slipping. Memories slam into my mind. A blur of memories, mixed with two faces.</p><p>Oliver...</p><p>Forbes...</p><p>Slammed up against a wall.</p><p>Thrown to a floor.</p><p>Pinned to a bed.</p><p>Thrown down the stairs.</p><p>Hit.</p><p>Slapped.</p><p>Kicked.</p><p>Punched.</p><p>Beaten.</p><p>Broken ribs, wrist, fingers...</p><p>Heart\u2013broken \u2013 irreparable.</p><p>Worthless.</p><p>In pain.</p><p>All the time.</p><p>It never stopped.</p><p>No one ever saved me...</p><p>\u201cMia.\u201d I feel Jordan squeezing my hand.</p><p>I blink my eyes clear.</p><p>\u201cJesus, are you okay?\u201d His voice is soft, but his jaw is tight.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I ... uh.\u201d I touch a hand to my face, wanting to cover any emotion showing on it.</p><p>\u201cI lost you again. Where did you go?\u201d he asks gently.</p><p>Closing my eyes on a long blink, I shake my head and slide my hand from his.</p><p>I hear the grind in his teeth as he speaks, \u201cHow often did he hurt you?\u201d</p><p>Swallowing down my shame, I answer, quietly, \u201cMore often than not.\u201d</p><p>His face freezes. He looks like he\u2019s in pain. \u201cWhy did you stay?\u201d It sounds more like a plea than a question.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a long story.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got all night ... week ... year.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not worth going into.\u201d</p><p>He drives his hand into his hair. \u201cBut you left. Came here. What gave you the push?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe tried to rape me.\u201d</p><p>I see my words hit him like a physical blow. He recoils, hands white-knuckle around the edge of the table.</p><p>There\u2019s this horrible strained pause between us.</p><p>I feel sick.</p><p>My body has broken out in a cold sweat. Tremors running all over, settling into my stomach, a pit of fear and self-loathing.</p><p>I need food. And privacy.</p><p>Now.</p><p>I curl my fingernails into the bed of my hand, trying to control my urge to leap from my chair and run to the nearest convenience store.</p><p>Jordan\u2019s eyes have not left my face. A myriad of emotions scrolling through them. I don\u2019t want to look at him right now, but I can\u2019t seem to bring myself to look away.</p><p>\u201cHe did what?\u201d I don\u2019t know if he actually says the words, or mouths them because my ears are ringing with the truth.</p><p>I pull my top lip into my mouth, biting it.</p><p>I blink once. Twice. \u201cHe tried to ... rape me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus fuckin\u2019 Christ,\u201d Jordan whispers angrily. Elbows on the table, he drops his head in his hands.</p><p>I shouldn\u2019t have told him. Why did I tell him?</p><p>I shrink back into my seat, wishing to be invisible. Wanting to rewind time.</p><p>The atmosphere is awful. The silence painful.</p><p>When I reach the point where I can\u2019t take it anymore, which isn\u2019t long, I push my chair out.</p><p>Jordan\u2019s head snaps up at the sound of wood scraping wood. \u201cWhere are you going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI, uh...\u201d I glance in the direction of the exit.</p><p>His eyes follow mine, then flicker back. \u201cDon\u2019t go.\u201d He blows out a breath, pressing at his temples with his fingers. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m not handling this right ... I just\u2014\u201d He shakes his head, leaning close to me. \u201cJesus, Mia, I just can\u2019t handle the thought of anyone hurting you \u2013 not like that \u2013 not at all.\u201d</p><p>His words make it hard to breath. They matter to me more than I care to admit right now.</p><p>When his eyes rest on my face, they soften. \u201cWhat can I do ... to help you?\u201d</p><p>And those squeeze my heart.</p><p>\u201cNothing.\u201d I swallow past the huge lump in my throat. \u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t buy it. I can see it in your eyes that you\u2019re far from fine.\u201d A storm rolls in over his features. \u201cTell me where he lives.\u201d</p><p>\u201cW-what? Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do you think?\u201d</p><p>I tense. \u201cJordan, I didn\u2019t tell you so you\u2019d go beat him up.\u201d Why did I tell him? \u201cI told you because...\u201d I shake my head. \u201cI don\u2019t want you to beat Forbes up.\u201d</p><p>He frowns. \u201cThat\u2019s his name \u2013 Forbes?\u201d</p><p>I realize this is the first time I\u2019ve spoken his name in almost a week. And I wonder if Jordan knowing his name is a mistake on my part.</p><p>I say nothing.</p><p>He breaks my gaze and rests his elbows on the table, putting his head in his hands again. Tension is pouring off him in waves.</p><p>Tilting his head back slightly, his eyes lift to mine. There\u2019s a vulnerability in them that surprises me. \u201cI need to do something, Mia.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d My words are quiet.</p><p>\u201cBecause ... I just do.\u201d His are soft.</p><p>\u201cYou are doing something. You\u2019re being my friend. That counts for a lot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need to do more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I shake my head, edging off my seat. \u201cI don\u2019t need more. I shouldn\u2019t have told you. It was a mistake.\u201d</p><p>The skin around his eyes tightens. \u201cYou\u2019re wrong. The only mistake was not telling me sooner.\u201d He reaches over and grabs my hand, keeping me from leaving.</p><p>I try to ignore the way his touch makes me feel. The ache in my chest of longing for something I never knew I wanted until now.</p><p>\u201cI wish you\u2019d told me before now,\u201d he adds quietly.</p><p>He rubs his thumb gently over the back of my hand. It\u2019s an unconscious move on his part but means so much to me.</p><p>Men don\u2019t touch me gently. Not like this. Not ever.</p><p>And he\u2019s done it twice in the matter of minutes.</p><p>\u201cHave you told anyone else, aside from me, what he did to you?\u201d</p><p>My eyes widen in horror at the thought. I\u2019m still in shock that I told him and trying to figure out what that means, let alone tell anyone else.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take that as a no.\u201d He shakes his head sadly. \u201cYou need to report this to the police. He can\u2019t get away with what he did to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? No.\u201d Panic squeezes my stomach like a vice.</p><p>\u201cMia...\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d My voice is harsher than I knew I had in me. I rear back, taking my hand with me.</p><p>Whatever Jordan sees on my face has him placating, \u201cOkay. No police.\u201d He lays his palms on the table between us. \u201cJust do one thing for me...?\u201d When I don\u2019t respond, he continues. \u201cDon\u2019t keep anything else locked up inside you. You need someone to talk to, someone to trust \u2013 that person is me. I won\u2019t ever judge you. I will never hurt you. And I won\u2019t let you down. I might have done some shit things in my past, I might have treated people badly ... people who didn\u2019t deserve it, but I won\u2019t do that to you \u2013 ever. I promise.\u201d</p><p>His words are impassioned, his face earnest. \u201cYou have me at my word. I won\u2019t break it.\u201d His mouth lifts into a gentle smile.</p><p>I want to believe him. I do.</p><p>But it\u2019s just not in me to be able to trust. The ability is not something I\u2019m gifted with.</p><p>I don\u2019t know what to say. So I do what I do best, and avoid. Smiling, I nod and ask, \u201cSo, what now?\u201d</p><p>Jordan\u2019s dark eyes are curious on my face. For a moment, I wonder if he\u2019s going to push it further.</p><p>He doesn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cNow...\u201d he says, rising from his seat, \u201cwe drink more tequila.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Thirteen</p><p>Jordan</p><p>I never thought I would want to be close to a woman as I do Mia.</p><p>But I do. I\u2019m just not entirely sure why.</p><p>And even though I am close to her, possibly closer than anyone has ever had the privilege to be, I want more.</p><p>I want all of her. In every way possible.</p><p>The morning after the tequila had worn off, I was worried things would be weird between us.</p><p>Not because of what Mia told me had happened to her ... fuck, no.</p><p>That changed nothing in the way I see her, the way I want her.</p><p>The only thing that has changed is how deeply I want to bury my fist into that asshole\u2019s face.</p><p>I thought I was pissed when I knew he\u2019d hit her. But knowing what I know now, my anger has gone so beyond pissed there isn\u2019t even a word for it. All I know is I want to kill a man I\u2019ve never met, and I\u2019d do it with absolute fucking pleasure. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The look on Mia\u2019s face when she told me what he did and how he hurt her ... it was shame. Like somehow what happened was her fault.</p><p>It made me hurt for her ... for me. It\u2019s hard to distinguish between the two now. Her pain has somehow entwined with mine.</p><p>But that\u2019s Mia. She\u2019s not a person you meet, then just simply walk away from.</p><p>She embeds herself so deep within you, without even meaning to, that you have no choice but to feel her. That\u2019s what she\u2019s done to me.</p><p>And I\u2019m so fucking happy for it.</p><p>When I\u2019m around her, I actually feel alive in a way I haven\u2019t for a long time. And I\u2019m going to spend every moment I have with her, making her see that none of what happened to her was her fault.</p><p>I\u2019m going to make her see herself the way I see her.</p><p>Incredible. Strong. Beautiful.</p><p>So fucking beautiful.</p><p>It hurts to want her in the way I do and not be able to have her. After my brain connected with what I\u2019d told her in that bar about myself, I was worried shitless that I might have lost her.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t have been more wrong.</p><p>Mia doesn\u2019t care about any of it \u2013 the mistakes I\u2019ve made. She doesn\u2019t look at me different. She doesn\u2019t judge me.</p><p>She sees more in me.</p><p>She sees the real me. The Jordan I had long forgotten existed.</p><p>The me before the gambling, and the women ... before the epic fuck-ups.</p><p>I\u2019d spent so long believing I was a bad person. And I couldn\u2019t see beyond that, until her.</p><p>Sometimes that\u2019s all it takes. Just one person to turn everything on its head. Remind you of the person you were.</p><p>Mia makes me want to be the person I was before all the shit.</p><p>I know I sound like a pussy, but I don\u2019t care.</p><p>I just want to be around Mia, and continue feeling the way I do when I\u2019m with her.</p><p>And I\u2019m finding that I want to be around her more often than not.</p><p>Yesterday, Mia and I went into town shopping so she could get some things she needed. This was new territory for me. I\u2019ve never shopped with a girl. Not even Beth.</p><p>It might sound like nothing to you, but trust me, shopping with a girl was a big step for me \u2013 huge, in fact.</p> <p>When she was all shopped out, we had lunch at the diner again. I could see Beth\u2019s raised brow and curious looks the whole time we were there, but I didn\u2019t leave her with an opportunity to quiz me.</p><p>I\u2019m just not ready to discuss this ... whatever this is.</p><p>Our day together was good, considering the big revelations of the night before. We had fun, and the subject of our pasts never came up. Mia didn\u2019t mention anything about wanting to go and check out another potential mother from the list, and I wasn\u2019t about to push her.</p><p>I was just happy to have her there with me.</p><p>I told crappy jokes. She laughed a lot. And yes, I might have been trying to win her over with my sparkling personality. I know that my face and body won\u2019t simply be enough to win her affection. Mia\u2019s going to need more from me, and I want to give that to her. Give her all of me.</p><p>When we got back to the hotel, I had chores to do, but Mia insisted on helping me. We worked together with ease.</p><p>I cooked her dinner. Granted it was only mac and cheese, but she said it was the best she\u2019d ever tasted. After dinner, we watched a movie in the main living room with Dozer positioned as a chaperone between us.</p><p>It was hard being that close to her in the dark and not being able to do a thing. I wanted to kiss her so very fucking badly, but it just never seemed to be the right time to make a move.</p><p>I find myself looking for clues in her words and actions, but the instant I get a hint it\u2019s gone, and I\u2019m left wondering if I\u2019m just looking so hard that I\u2019m making myself see things that don\u2019t actually exist.</p><p>I know I\u2019m acting like a chick, analyzing shit \u2013 I\u2019m turning into a fucking pussy. And yes, I\u2019m fully aware of how fucking annoying I sound, but this is what she does to me. She has me tied up in all kinds of knots.</p><p>Mia is not like any girl I have ever known, and knowing what happened to her makes pursuing her all the more difficult. So I\u2019m left with only one option \u2013 if we\u2019re meant to happen, we will. Let nature take its course. No taking the bull by the horns for me.</p><p>I\u2019m just hoping nature hurries the fuck up because I can feel the clock ticking with Mia.</p><p>Of course, I\u2019m still flirting with her. That hasn\u2019t stopped. This is me we\u2019re talking about. I couldn\u2019t stop if I tried. It\u2019d be like asking Dozer not to sniff another dog\u2019s ass.</p><p>Flirting comes as natural to me as ass sniffing does to Dozer.</p><p>And Mia doesn\u2019t seem opposed to it\u2014my flirting, I mean. I like the reaction I get from her when I do it. The blush in her cheeks gives me hope for more.</p><p>God, I want more.</p><p>And right now, I\u2019m desperately trying not to stare at her legs. It\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve seen them.</p><p>Thank you hot sun is all I can say.</p><p>She\u2019s stretched out on a blanket on the walkway over the lake reading a book. Dozer is, of course, with her. Dog\u2019s got it bad.</p><p>She\u2019s wearing a tank and the cut-off shorts she bought yesterday. They sit an inch or so above her knee.</p><p>The chicks I know usually wear their cuts-offs so short their ass cheeks show, but not Mia. She keeps tugging them down, like she\u2019s uncomfortable to be showing so much skin.</p><p>But you know, I find her cut-offs way more sexy than the ass showing ones. They leave more to the imagination, and I know the day I do get to see underneath them, it will have been totally worth the wait because the partial leg I am getting to see is turning me on big time.</p><p>She has great fucking legs.</p><p>My cock twitches, so I drag my eyes from Mia and focus on steering the riding mower so I can get this damn grass cut.</p><p>My cell starts to vibrate in my pocket. \u201cBeth,\u201d I answer, tucking the phone between my ear and shoulder.</p><p>\u201cHey ... okay, so I have a date tonight.\u201d She sounds panicked.</p><p>\u201cAnd this is a good thing or a bad thing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBoth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause my date is with Toni Stryder.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, right.\u201d</p><p>Toni is a chick Beth has a huge thing for. She\u2019s a cool girl who works as a DJ. Very hot. And sadly for all men, she\u2019s a lesbian, just like my best buddy.</p><p>I\u2019m well aware of how hot Beth is\u2014I\u2019m not fucking blind\u2014but even if Beth didn\u2019t play for the other team, it wouldn\u2019t make a difference. She\u2019s my best friend and the closest thing to a sister I have.</p><p>\u201cI ran into her at the grocery store,\u201d Beth says, still sounding anxious. \u201cShe\u2019s got a gig tonight over in Grand Junction, and she asked me to go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure she actually asked you out on a date, and wasn\u2019t just asking you to go to her gig?\u201d Beth\u2019s been known to misread signals in the past. She\u2019s been hurt before \u2013 badly. I won\u2019t let it happen again.</p><p>\u201cYes, Dad. I\u2019m not a complete fucktard. I know when a chick is asking me out on a date. You know, when she says, \u2018Hey Beth, I was wondering, if after my set, do you want to hang out?\u2019 So I ask, \u2018What, you mean like a date?\u2019 And she says, \u2018Yeah, I mean a date.\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, I get it. It\u2019s a date,\u201d I laugh. \u201cI\u2019m over the fucking moon for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood, because I need you to come with.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? Aw, come on, Beth. You know I dig a threesome with two hot chicks as much as the next guy, but seriously, I\u2019m not having a threesome with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn your fucking dreams, Matthews!\u201d she screeches down the line.</p><p>Laughing, I hold my cell away to prevent an ear bleed. Beth has a real set of lungs on her, but I can\u2019t help winding her up. She\u2019s too easy.</p><p>I put the phone back to my ear. \u201cSeriously though, screechy, what do you need me there for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause Toni\u2019s set lasts for an hour and a half, and I don\u2019t want to sit in the club on my own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo just go after her set is finished.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t. I said I\u2019d watch her play. Please, Jordan. I\u2019m really nervous about it. Toni is the hottest chick I\u2019ve ever met. And she\u2019s cool. I\u2019m not cool.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re cool, Beth.\u201d</p><p>She makes a scoffing sound.</p><p>\u201cSeriously, we need to work on your confidence.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, so let\u2019s work on it tonight. You can give me pointers on how to act around Toni. This is what you\u2019re awesome at\u2014talking to hot girls and being cool. You can make me awesome at it too. And if I start to act like ... well ... me, you can give me a nudge ... and I know there will be plenty of hot girls for you to hook up with after you\u2019ve finished coaching me.\u201d</p><p>She thinks she\u2019s coaxing me by adding that, but I don\u2019t want to be that guy anymore. I don\u2019t want to be out in a club picking up chicks. I want to be with Mia.</p><p>Pressing on the breaks, I stop and look over at her. She\u2019s lost in her book. She looks so fucking beautiful. She looks like everything I never knew I wanted.</p><p>I cut the engine, taking the phone into my hand.</p><p>\u201cDoes your silence mean you\u2019re considering?\u201d Beth asks, sounding hopeful.</p><p>I don\u2019t want to let Beth down. And if I go out, it doesn\u2019t mean I have to end the night with a girl in my bed. I could just go, then leave after Beth\u2019s feeling okay with Toni.</p><p>I exhale. \u201cI\u2019m considering. Keep talking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay ... so it\u2019s free entry, courtesy of Toni. And I\u2019ll buy your drinks all night. Also, it\u2019s a paint party, something different.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck\u2019s a paint party?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrom what Toni said, paint is sprayed all over the clubbers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds awesome.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be snarky. So will you come? Please.\u201d</p><p>My eyes wander to Mia again, and a thought starts to form ... I could ask Mia to come with me.</p><p>Mia and me together in a club ... dancing ... hot and sweaty ... our bodies close together...</p><p>This could make things happen. Or at the very least, move things on a little bit.</p><p>\u201cOkay, I\u2019ll come. But I\u2019m bringing someone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYay! Jordan, you are the best effin friend ever!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d I deadpan. \u201cSo what time is this thing?\u201d</p><p>Ignoring my question, she asks, \u201cSo, who are you bringing? Anyone I know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat time, Beth?\u201d</p><p>She sighs at my blatant dismissal. \u201cToni\u2019s set starts at nine. One other thing ... can you drive? My car is in the shop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuckin\u2019 hell! So the drinks you planned on buying me all night ...?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSoda.\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t help but laugh at her audacity.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll owe you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou will. Big time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat am I gonna end up doing? Your laundry or something equally gross?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d I switch the phone to my other ear. \u201cBut I\u2019m sure I can come up with something good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever it is, it\u2019ll be worth it for a date with Toni,\u201d she says in a dreamy voice. \u201cSo come on, tell me who you\u2019re bringing tonight? It\u2019s not like you to play coy. Am I missing something here?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll pick you up at eight.\u201d And right before I hang up, I add, \u201cAnd I\u2019m bringing Mia with me.\u201d</p><p>Chuckling, I push my cell in my pocket and hop down from the mower.

I crouch down to stroke him.</p><p>Mia\u2019s eyes lift from her book to me. \u201cHey.\u201d She smiles, sitting up.</p> <p>I suddenly feel nervous. And a little queasy. \u201cYour book good? You looked lost in it.\u201d</p><p>Turning the book over, she stares down at the cover.</p><p>I grin when I see that it is a picture of a half-naked guy draped over a half-naked chick.</p><p>Book porn. Go Mia.</p><p>Realizing her mistake at showing me the cover, her face goes bright red. She quickly closes the book and sets it down. Back cover up, naked couple down.</p> <p>Shame.</p><p>\u201cYeah, it\u2019s okay.\u201d She looks out at the lake. Leaning over, she trails her fingers in the water. \u201cI wanted to ask ... is this water okay to swim in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d I answer, moving to sit in front of her. \u201cI swim in here all the time. You up for a swim now?\u201d</p><p>An image of Mia wearing a bikini flashes through my mind. It\u2019s a really fucking great image.</p><p>\u201cOh, not right now.\u201d She scores her lower lip with her teeth.</p><p>And that\u2019s it. My thoughts go to shit. It takes me a good minute just to remember why I actually came over.</p> <p>Beth. Date. Club.</p><p>\u201cSo I, uh...\u201d I push my hair out of my eyes. \u201cI came over because I just got off the phone with Beth. She\u2019s got a date tonight, and she\u2019s talked me into going with her.\u201d</p><p>Her eyebrow lifts. \u201cAren\u2019t dates supposed to be just a two person thing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNormally. But it\u2019s a big deal for her, and her date is going to be DJing at the club, so she\u2019ll be alone for the first hour or so. She needs me to keep her company. And Beth is impossible to say no to when she wants something, so I said I\u2019d go and ... I was ... uh, wondering if you wanted to come along \u2013 with me?\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widen. I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s shock of the bad variety, or surprise of the good.</p><p>\u201cDo you mean, like, on a date?\u201d Her eyes instantly close on a groan. \u201cDid I say that out loud? I said that out loud. Oh god.\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t help the smile on my face, or the happy in my voice. \u201cYeah, you said it out loud.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh god.\u201d She groans again, covering her face with her hands.</p> <p>My confidence instantly bolstered, I reach over and pull a hand from her face. One eye pops open.</p><p>\u201cDo you want me to be asking you out on a date?\u201d</p><p>Slowly, she lowers her other hand from her face.</p><p>My heart is hammering in my chest, waiting for her to put me out of my misery.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she whispers.</p><p>I tangle my fingers with hers. \u201cThen I\u2019m asking you out on a date.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Fourteen</p><p>Mia</p><p>Oh god. Oh god. Oh god.</p><p>I agreed to go on a date with Jordan.</p><p>What was I thinking?</p><p>I wasn\u2019t thinking. That\u2019s the point. I was looking into his amazing eyes and saying yes before I knew what I was agreeing to.</p><p>It was my fault because there was all that talk of Beth\u2019s date ... I got confused and thought he was asking me out ... and me being me, I blurted out what I was thinking, which I seem to do all the time around him, and before I knew it, he was asking, and I was saying yes.</p><p>I should back out.</p><p>I don\u2019t want to, but I should. I don\u2019t have the best track record when it comes to men. I\u2019m not a winner picker.</p><p>But this is Jordan.</p><p>And I\u2019m about eighty-five percent sure I can trust him. He\u2019s given me no reason to not. And yes, I know Forbes came across as trustworthy in the beginning, but back then I was na\u00efve and a fool.</p><p>I\u2019m not that person anymore. I know the signs to look for, and I see none of them in Jordan.</p><p>There\u2019s no over the top niceness, which is there in the beginning to hide the monster lying in wait. There\u2019s no control in his personality. He is just who he is. If anything, Jordan has been really open and honest with me about his past.</p><p>If all he cared about is tricking me and getting me where he wants me \u2013 in his bed and under his control \u2013 that wouldn\u2019t be the way. And men like that are not honest. Not right away, anyway.</p><p>Jordan\u2019s fun. He makes me laugh. He makes me feel happiness in a way I\u2019ve never known. I love being around him, and I think I deserve some fun; some happiness and laughter in my life.</p><p>And really, it is just one date. It\u2019s not as if I\u2019m marrying the guy.</p><p>I should just go out with him tonight and see how it goes. I\u2019ve got absolutely nothing to lose, and we won\u2019t be alone. Beth will be there with her date too.</p><p>It\u2019ll be fine.</p><p>Taking a deep breath, I survey myself in the mirror.</p><p>I wasn\u2019t sure what to wear. Jordan said I shouldn\u2019t wear anything I\u2019m too attached to as apparently it\u2019s a paint party at the club tonight. I\u2019ve never heard of that before, but it sounds fun, if not a little messy. But I\u2019m all up for trying new things at the moment.</p><p>I\u2019m not really a dancer, and I\u2019m not attached to any of my clothes, so it\u2019s not too difficult for me to choose what to wear. It\u2019s a really warm evening, so I\u2019ve decided to wear a white tank top and khaki linen pants. I\u2019ve accessorized with a cute black and white bead necklace and matching bracelet that I picked up while shopping with Jordan yesterday.</p><p>I want to look as nice as possible, but I don\u2019t have a lot to work with here. Not much can be done with my short hair, but the style has really grown on me and it looks cool.</p><p>I\u2019ve applied some make-up \u2013 mascara, blusher and lip-gloss. I also used cover-up as there is still a trace of yellow bruising around my eye. No hiding the cut on my brow, but it\u2019s healing nicely.</p><p>I\u2019m just fastening the laces on my sneakers when there\u2019s a knock at the door.</p><p>My date is here.</p><p>A swarm of fireflies takes flight in my stomach. I quickly finish off tying up my lace and get to my feet, taking deep breaths as I approach the door. I open it to a \u2018more gorgeous than normal looking\u2019 Jordan.</p><p>He\u2019s only wearing a plain black t-shirt and distressed jeans. White sneakers on his feet. Simple, but oh so effective. Jordan makes anything look good.</p><p>I can see that he\u2019s shaved as his stubble from earlier is gone. His dark hair is in its trademark style. My fingers itch to run through the silky strands.</p><p>I can smell his aftershave. Clean and fresh. He smells as gorgeous as he looks; exactly as a man should smell. I have to resist the urge to lean close and inhale.</p><p>He runs a hand through his shiny hair. \u201cYou look great\u2014\u201d He shakes his head. \u201c\u2014I mean, pretty. You look real pretty, Mia.\u201d</p><p>I curl my fingers around the beads, holding them like a life support. \u201cThanks, you too. Not pretty \u2013 handsome. I mean you look handsome.\u201d God, kill me now.</p><p>Jordan chuckles and leans his shoulder up against the door frame. \u201cAre you ready to go? I told Beth we\u2019d pick her up at eight, so we need to set off soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. Let me just grab my things.\u201d</p><p>I decide against taking a purse with me, so I put my room key, money and lip-gloss into my pocket while Jordan waits in the hall. I let the door lock behind me, then follow him out the hotel and to his car.</p><p>He opens the passenger door for me. No one has ever done that before, and I can\u2019t help but smile at his gesture. I slip into the seat and watch as Jordan rounds the hood. The way his body moves with such confident ease ... it\u2019s so attractive on him. I wish I was that comfortable in my own skin.</p><p>He climbs in next to me.</p><p>There\u2019s a quiet unease between us. I know I\u2019m the cause of it because of my nerves at being on a date with him, but I\u2019m really missing the ease we normally have between us. I do want to be on a date with Jordan, I just don\u2019t like the pressure it\u2019s putting on me ... or the pressure I\u2019m putting on myself.</p><p>He starts the engine and the radio fills the empty background, but the silence between us is still palpable.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d His softly spoken words bring my face to him.</p><p>I wring my hands in my lap. \u201cJust a little nervous, I guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeing on a date.\u201d I twist the beads around my finger. \u201cI just ... I haven\u2019t...\u201d I shake my head, struggling to find the right words to explain my feelings.</p><p>\u201cHey...\u201d He gently touches my chin with his finger.</p><p>I love the way his touch feels. I never thought it would be possible, and I\u2019ll never tire of him touching me, but I just wish I knew how to tell him. How to express how he makes me feel ... how I feel about him. I know I\u2019m not what he\u2019s used to, and I know I won\u2019t ever be able to be like those women. I\u2019m afraid I\u2019m going to be a disappointment to him.</p><p>\u201c... there is nothing to be nervous about. We\u2019re just going out to have some fun, dance and get sprayed with paint.\u201d He grins.</p><p>It\u2019s impossible not to smile back.</p><p>\u201cThere you go.\u201d He touches the corner of my smile with his thumb. And those damn fireflies start off in my stomach again, swooping and somersaulting. \u201cNothing will happen tonight that you don\u2019t want, okay?\u201d His gaze is warm on my skin.</p><p>I take a deep breath. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>Beth seems nervous about her date. She has done nothing but talk about it from the moment we picked her up. She\u2019s like a bundle of nervous energy, but honestly, I like it. I like her. And Beth\u2019s nerves are making me feel a little more normal about my own.</p><p>I love the dynamic between Beth and Jordan. The way he never seems to get annoyed or irritated by her incessant chatter about her date with Toni. Forbes would never have let me talk that way, but then I guess Beth is Jordan\u2019s friend, not his girlfriend.</p><p>I\u2019ve wondered why they are nothing more than friends as Beth is really pretty and they get on so well, but I had my question answered after five minutes of Beth being in the car when she talked about Toni in the female sense. Turns out Beth is into girls.</p><p>A girl who went to my school was a lesbian. She was bullied incessantly because of it. I used to feel so terrible for her, but it wasn\u2019t as if I could do anything to help her. I wish I could have, but I couldn\u2019t even deal with my own problems, so I had no chance of helping anyone else. I wonder if Beth has suffered any hassle because of her sexual orientation. If she has, then I\u2019m glad that Jordan is by her side because I can imagine him kicking the crap out of anyone who bullied her.</p><p>Jordan parks a few blocks over from the club and we start the short walk. The sidewalk is narrow, so Beth is in front, Jordan and I behind.</p><p>Because we\u2019re so close, our hands keep brushing as we walk. Every time they touch, a jolt of heat flares up my arm. I\u2019m desperate to hold his hand. We\u2019ve held hands before, always Jordan holding mine, but that was before this, when we were just friends. Now things have changed, and it makes holding hands seem like such a bigger deal.</p><p>\u201cFuck it,\u201d I hear him mutter, and the next thing I know he\u2019s taking hold of my hand. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>My heart takes flight, buzzing around my chest.</p><p>He leans down to my ear. \u201cIs this okay?\u201d His warm breath whispers over my skin.</p><p>Shivering, I turn my head resting my chin against my shoulder, I stare into his eyes. \u201cIt\u2019s more than okay.\u201d</p><p>He lifts my hand, bringing me close to his side, and brushes a kiss over my knuckles.</p> <p>I can hardly take my eyes off him. He becomes more beautiful and more precious to me with each passing second, and it terrifies me.</p><p>He\u2019s too good for someone like me. Forbes was right when he said I was nothing. I\u2019m not meant for someone as good as Jordan.</p><p>The happiness I was feeling disappears. My stomach drops. I look ahead and find Beth looking over her shoulder at us, smiling.</p><p>Then she catches my eye, and her smile vanishes. I quickly look away, and paste on a fake smile, relieved when the club comes into view.</p><p>We follow Beth over to the doorman, and thanks to Toni putting us on the guest list, we don\u2019t have to wait in the huge line.</p> <p>I\u2019ve only ever been in a club one time before. It was with Forbes and his rich douchey friends. That club was a bit nicer than this place, but I actually prefer this club. It looks how a club should look. All dark and grungy. Floor sticky from spilt drinks.</p><p>It feels real.</p><p>The bass is pumping loud, vibrating up through my feet, and I feel a tremor of excitement at being here; doing something out of my ordinary.</p><p>The club is packed; a sea of people. I notice most of the girls are dressed in fewer clothes than me, wearing shorts and cut-off t-shirts. I wish I could wear shorts as short as they are, but the scars on the back of my thighs prevent me from doing so as does my severe lack of confidence.</p><p>My good feeling instantly disappears, leaving me feeling dowdy and out of place, and wondering just why the hell Jordan is here with me. A sudden urge to leave so I can hide away and comfort eat myself until I\u2019m sick compels me.</p><p>I curl my fingers into my hand, pressing my nails into my skin, trying to expel the urge.</p> <p>As if hearing my pain, Jordan squeezes my hand. I glance up at him. \u201cHey, you okay?\u201d he mouths over the music.</p><p>With a fake smile, I nod.</p><p>He looks at me for too long, suspicion curving his mouth. It feels like he\u2019s trying to see deep inside me, and it makes me fidgety, so I look away.</p><p>He moves closer. I know he\u2019s going to question me further. I feel his body press against my side, and my body goes to war with my mind. I want him close, yet I want him to go away.</p><p>I\u2019m saved by Beth, when she comes bounding over.</p><p>\u201cToni\u2019s coming out in ten, so let\u2019s get a drink first, then we can go see her,\u201d she yells over the music.</p><p>Jordan steps back giving me space. I almost exhale in relief. I can feel his eyes burning into me, but I can\u2019t bring myself to meet his stare.</p><p>Smiling at Beth, I say, \u201cSure. Sounds good.\u201d</p> <p>Beth leads the way to the bar. Jordan is close behind me. When we reach the bar, I stand beside Beth. Jordan comes up behind, hands either side of me, placing them on the bar and caging me in.</p><p>My body is fully aware of how close he is and wants him closer. My hands are itching to reach back and pull him to me.</p><p>\u201cDrinks are on me, so what do you both want?\u201d Beth says.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get the drinks,\u201d Jordan\u2019s deep voice comes between us.</p><p>Beth\u2019s eyes flicker to him. \u201cNo way! Deal was that I\u2019d buy your drinks tonight for coming with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDeal\u2019s off. Now tell me what you want?\u201d There\u2019s an air of authority in his voice, which I surprisingly like. It has my skin tingling, and other parts of me.</p><p>Beth, seemingly unaffected by him, says, \u201cFine. I\u2019m not gonna argue with you. Saves me a few dollars. I\u2019ll have a whiskey and soda \u2013 make it a Fireball.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMia ... what do you want?\u201d he speaks in my ear, his voice deep and breathy. It makes my toes curl.</p><p>I feel like he\u2019s not asking me about choice of drinks right now. And I know exactly what I want \u2013 him.</p><p>I turn my head, only to find my mouth now dangerously close to his. And by dangerously, I mean dangerous because of my insistent need to kiss him right now. If that\u2019s going to happen tonight, then here at the bar is most definitely not the place.</p><p>My eyes meet his, just in time to see them darken. He feels it too ... wants this ... me.</p><p>My body goes into overdrive.</p><p>Quickly gathering myself, I say, \u201cBeer. Bottled. Please.\u201d And I face forward.</p><p>Casting a sideways glance, I see Beth smiling happily at us. I\u2019m kind of getting the feeling she likes me with Jordan.</p><p>Jordan\u2019s hands come from around me. He moves to the side and leans up against the bar to get served. I feel a tap my shoulder, and turn to a smiling Beth. She moves back a little away from Jordan, so I follow.</p><p>\u201cHow are you finding Durango?\u201d she asks.</p><p>I smile, thinking of Jordan\u2014the one thing that I really like about this town. \u201cI like it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, it\u2019s not so bad. But when you\u2019ve lived here your whole life, like I have, it becomes a bit boring.\u201d</p><p>I get that, knowing how it felt to be trapped in Boston my whole life.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve never been anyway else?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cSure, I\u2019ve been away on vacation, but nowhere exciting. I\u2019d love to go to traveling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJordan\u2019s been traveling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, he told me. South East Asia, right?\u201d</p><p>Beth looks a little surprised at my knowing this, which quickly morphs into a smile.</p><p>Before I get a chance to consider her reaction, a high-pitched female voice grabs my attention. Mainly, because she\u2019s screeching Jordan\u2019s name.</p><p>I turn to see a very pretty bartender with long dark hair and legs even longer. She seemingly knows Jordan very well if the look on her face is anything to go by as she leans over the bar and throws her arms around his neck.</p><p>My stomach tightens into a knot of jealous ire. Stupid, I know, but still there nonetheless.</p><p>He awkwardly pats her back, then quickly pulls her arms from around him. She grabs hold of his forearm, keeping him with her, but I watch him remove her hand. She leans in and says something. He shakes his head, which she clearly doesn\u2019t like if the pissed off look on her face is any indication.</p><p>She stares at him for a long moment, then without another word turns away and starts making our drinks.</p><p>Jordan turns in our direction. I quickly look away so he doesn\u2019t see I\u2019m watching.</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t worry about it,\u201d Beth says close to my ear. \u201cAll women behave like that around him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but more so the ones he\u2019s already slept with.\u201d The words are out of my mouth before I can stop them. I clamp my mouth shut.</p><p>I can\u2019t believe I just said that.</p><p>Beth will, without doubt, be aware of Jordan\u2019s past when it comes to women, but it\u2019s not my place to pass comment.</p><p>She lifts her eyebrow. \u201cHe has been talking to you. I\u2019m glad, but surprised he told you that stuff. Still, I\u2019ll take it as a good sign considering you\u2019re here on a date with him. You must really like him.\u201d Then she smiles wide. \u201cAnd he must really like you.\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t say her words don\u2019t affect me because they do. I want Jordan to like me.</p><p>\u201cWhat makes you think that?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cBecause he\u2019s never been that honest with a girl before. Hell, he\u2019s never been on an actual date before. And if he\u2019s telling you all his shit up front, then you must really mean something to him. He must think a lot of you. He wants you to know the truth, and that\u2019s a big step for him.\u201d</p><p>I honestly don\u2019t know what to say, so I say nothing.</p><p>\u201cLook, I don\u2019t know how long you\u2019re here for, Mia, and I know Jordan might come off as being a bad ass, but he\u2019s not. Not really. When he cares about someone, he cares about them with everything. And he takes, losing someone he cares about, badly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis mom?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHoly crap! He told you about his mom? Shit, he does like you.\u201d She grins and wraps an arm around my waist. The contact surprises me and locks every muscle in my body. It does every time a new person touches me. \u201cJust don\u2019t break his heart now that he\u2019s finally got it working, please.\u201d She laughs lightly.</p><p>My insides coil. \u201cI don\u2019t think I have the power to do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, you\u2019d be surprised,\u201d she says, lowering her voice.</p><p>I lift my eyes to see a smiling, but curious Jordan walking toward us, hands laden with our drinks.</p><p>He hands me my beer.</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d I smile. His eyes hold mine for a moment before moving to Beth.</p><p>\u201cYou wanna go see Toni now?\u201d He hands Beth her drink.</p><p>\u201cYou know what?\u201d Her eyes dart to me, then back to Jordan, a smile creeping across her face. \u201cI\u2019m good. I got this with Toni.\u201d</p><p>Jordan\u2019s brow creases in confusion. \u201cYou sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure,\u201d she says, walking backwards and away from us into the crowd. \u201cYou two go have fun.\u201d Before turning away, she gives me a conspiratory wink.</p><p>Subtle much? I have to hold back a laugh.</p><p>\u201cIf you need me, call my cell,\u201d Jordan calls after her.</p><p>Beth waves a hand in acknowledgement before disappearing into the crowd.</p><p>Jordan turns to me. \u201cSo ... it\u2019s just you and me.\u201d</p><p>Shivers and a whole bunch of nerves swarm me. \u201cIt is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wanna try and find somewhere to sit?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>I follow Jordan upstairs where he says it\u2019ll be quieter and we\u2019ll be more likely to find a seat. He\u2019s right. We find an empty sofa overlooking the dance floor below.</p><p>I sit down first. Jordan sits beside me. My nerves have ratcheted up a couple of thousand notches now because it\u2019s just him and me. No Beth as a buffer. I can\u2019t think of a single thing to say to him, so I cover it up by continuously sipping on my drink and pretending to be fascinated by all the people in the club.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re still nervous.\u201d His hand comes up, pulling mine from my mouth. I was playing with my lip without even realizing.</p><p>Jordan slides his fingers through mine, holding my hand. My stomach scatters.</p><p>I turn my face to him, not realizing how close he is, bringing me almost nose to nose with him. My cheeks heat. I shuffle across the sofa, putting myself up against the arm rest, and I don\u2019t deny the nerves. There\u2019s no point. Not when he can read me so well.</p><p>\u201cIs it me who\u2019s making you nervous? Something I\u2019m doing, or just the whole being on a date with me thing?\u201d</p><p>I turn my body to him. My knees touch his thigh. \u201cIt\u2019s not you. It\u2019s just being on a date. I\u2019ve only dated one guy before, and that didn\u2019t work out so well for me.\u201d Without thought, I touch the healing cut on my brow.</p><p>His eyes follow my hand, and they stayed trained on the remnant of my relationship with Forbes long after I\u2019ve moved my hand away.</p><p>His face is impassive, but I know his mind is working. I can see it in his eyes. I\u2019m wondering if all I\u2019ve done is remind him of the mess I came from ... the mess I am ... what Forbes did to me ... that I carry too much baggage. Have I turned him off me? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m canceling our date,\u201d he says.</p><p>What?</p><p>Panic starts to crawl up my throat.</p><p>\u201cJordan, look, I\u2019m sorry if I...\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be sorry. And you really do say that way too much. We need to work on that.\u201d</p><p>I clutch the beads around my neck, needing something to hold onto. \u201cDo you want me to leave?\u201d</p><p>His eyes widen with discontent. \u201cWhat? No fuckin\u2019 way do I want you to leave. What I want is for you to relax and enjoy yourself with me tonight, so all I\u2019m doing by canceling our date is taking it out of the equation. If it happens to turn into a date later, then awesome. If it doesn\u2019t, then I might be a little disappointed...\u201d He grins to let me know he\u2019s teasing. \u201cThere isn\u2019t any pressure here. I like you \u2013 a lot. I think that\u2019s pretty obvious. But I want you to want to be here with me in the same way as I do you. If you\u2019re not quite there yet, then that\u2019s okay. I\u2019ll wait until you are. However long it takes.\u201d</p><p>Is he real? I almost want to pinch him to make sure.</p><p>He likes me. A lot.</p><p>I\u2019m washed aglow with the most amazing sensation \u2013 I\u2019ve never felt anything like it. My heart starts to beat faster than I knew possible without causing a heart attack.</p><p>I know I\u2019m staring at him, but I can\u2019t stop. All I can see is him, and I forget why I was nervous in the first place. Why I built this whole date up in my mind.</p><p>The music quietens to a dull throb. The world shutting out, fading to just us...</p><p>Him.</p><p>Then all thought is lost, and I just follow what my body is telling me to do.</p><p>I press my hand to the side of Jordan\u2019s face, absorbing the heat and strength of him. I lean in to press my lips to his cheek. He moves as I do, and my lips graze the corner of his. Heat scores through me, branding me his.</p><p>I withdraw, shocked but wanting more. I moisten my suddenly parched lips. A lick leaves me with the addictive taste of him. His aftershave, the soda he\u2019s drinking ... just everything that embodies him.</p><p>Jordan\u2019s eyes flare with something I\u2019m sure of. I\u2019m sure because I\u2019m feeling it too.</p><p>Lust. Desire. Want. And something more. Something deeper.</p><p>He slides his fingers into my hair, cupping the back of my head, he rests his forehead against mine.</p><p>\u201cI feel the same as you do,\u201d I say, my mouth so close to his that if I moved an inch we\u2019d be kissing. \u201cI want to be here with you ... more than anything.\u201d</p><p>He releases a contented breath. It soothes me.</p><p>\u201cShould I take it our date\u2019s back on?\u201d His voice sounds deliciously husky and incredibly sexy, sending shivers tumbling through me.</p><p>\u201cIt was never off.\u201d I smile.</p> <p>Chapter Fifteen</p><p>Jordan</p><p>\u201cDo you want to dance?\u201d</p><p>Lifting her shoulders slightly, Mia gives me an unsure look, then turns to look down at the dance floor.</p><p>After kissing me, she\u2019s been a little more relaxed. If I\u2019d have known that would have relaxed her, I\u2019d have told her to do it sooner.</p><p>Maybe it was the break in the ice that she needed.</p><p>Problem is, now I can\u2019t stop staring at her mouth ... her soft full lips ... wanting to feel them against mine ... fully...</p><p>She felt amazing.</p><p>And she smells so fucking good.</p><p>I\u2019d be content to sit with my nose buried in her neck, inhaling her sweet scent for the rest of the night, in-between kissing that gorgeous mouth of hers, of course.</p><p>When she leaned in to kiss my cheek\u2014believe it or not it wasn\u2019t on purpose, just a natural reaction to her. I don\u2019t regret it for a second because when her lips touched the corner of mine ... fuck ... if that\u2019s what a brief momentary touch of her lips on mine is like, then I can only imagine how amazing it will feel to kiss her properly.</p><p>And now, of course, all I can think about is kissing her. It\u2019s taking a real effort on my part not to make a move, but I don\u2019t want to rush her and fuck things up. That\u2019s why I\u2019m suggesting dancing \u2013 something to keep my mind occupied.</p><p>Though, watching her gorgeous body move on a dance floor will probably send my thoughts back south.</p><p>I lean close to her back, looking over her shoulder. \u201cI think the paint spraying might start soon. I\u2019m thinking it could be fun, and we can stop by and see how Beth is getting along with Toni.\u201d</p><p>She looks back at me, her lips curving up slightly. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>We both stand. I move aside to let Mia out first. She passes me, and the brush of her body against mine has me holding back a groan.</p><p>We\u2019ve just started walking when I feel Mia\u2019s tiny hand slip into mine. I look at her surprised.</p><p>But happy.</p><p>Really fucking happy.</p><p>Her cheeks blush.</p><p>This is the first time she\u2019s ever held my hand. It\u2019s always been me taking hold of hers. I\u2019ve been making up excuses to justify touching her if only for a second, and now tonight, after a no-touch policy on her part\u2014which I understand knowing what she\u2019s been through\u2014she has kissed me and is holding my hand.</p><p>I know these are big things for her, which makes them big for me. They show she trusts me.</p><p>I gently touch her pink cheek with my fingertips. She smiles.</p><p>We walk back down stairs, holding hands, in a bubble of our own, and because the motherfucking world hates me ... we bump straight into Shawna the instant my foot hits the bottom step.</p><p>\u201cJordan ... hi.\u201d Shawna slants a smile at me.</p><p>Fuck.</p><p>There\u2019s an unmistakable gleam in her eyes. I\u2019ve seen it before. Namely when she was naked and under me.</p><p>\u201cHi.\u201d My voice is tight. I pull Mia to my side, putting my arm around her shoulders so there\u2019s no mistaking who she is to me. \u201cShawna, meet Mia. Mia, Shawna.\u201d I do the polite thing and introduce them, but honestly, it\u2019s the last thing I want to do. Introducing the girl I\u2019m crazy about, to the last girl I was doing? Fucking, yay.</p><p>\u201cHi.\u201d Mia lifts her hand in a little wave. She\u2019s so goddamn adorable. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to meet you, Shawna.\u201d</p><p>Shawna\u2019s eyes dart to Mia. She falters a little, then makes a quick recovery. Her gaze returns to me, burning me with a laser like effect.</p><p>\u201cWell, you certainly weren\u2019t lying. You sure don\u2019t waste any time moving on and finding a new fuck buddy.\u201d</p><p>I feel Mia tense under my arm.</p><p>\u201cShawna...\u201d There\u2019s a warning in my voice.</p><p>\u201cLooks like you\u2019ve traded down though \u2013 majorly. But then, it\u2019s not like you can get better than me.\u201d Her eyes slice to Mia. \u201cI\u2019m sorry to tell you this, but he\u2019s nothing more than overused trash. He\u2019ll fuck you, then dump you before you even have a chance to get your panties back on.\u201d</p><p>What the fuck!</p><p>Okay, so she\u2019s not too far off the mark with the dumping part ... but still, what the fuck!</p><p>Talk to me like shit, fine \u2013 I deserve it. But not Mia. I won\u2019t have her spoken to in this way.</p><p>I open my mouth, ready to tell Shawna to piss off back to where she came from, when I hear Mia\u2019s sweet voice say...</p><p>\u201cWell, looks aside, going solely off your personality here, Shawna, I\u2019d say Jordan has traded up higher than a skyscraper with me. And as it turns out, I\u2019m just in it for the sex \u2013 so seems we\u2019re perfectly matched. Oh, and I don\u2019t wear panties either, so we\u2019ve no worries on that part.\u201d</p><p>My mouth falls open. Shawna looks like Mia has just slapped her.</p><p>\u201cOkay. Right. Well, I\u2019d say it was nice talking to you, but it wasn\u2019t, so ... bye.\u201d Mia moves out from under my arm, letting it drop to my side. Head held high, she walks away and makes her way through the crowd.</p><p>And my eyes are glued to her hot, sashaying ass as she goes.</p><p>Holy fucking fuck.</p><p>Have you ever watched that scene in Grease, right at the end of the movie, when Sandy turns up looking and acting completely different, decked out in tight black pants. And Danny sees her, and he\u2019s ... shocked\u2014disbelief of the best kind. Like, \u2018holy fuck, how did I not know how hot my girl could actually be?\u2019 Then he pretty much chases after her like a dog with his tongue hanging out.</p><p>Yeah? Good, so you know what I\u2019m talking about because right now, that\u2019s me.</p><p>I\u2019m chasing after Mia as if she\u2019s the last drop of water on earth, and I\u2019m seriously fucking parched.</p><p>I\u2019m ready to break out in song and serenade her with \u201cYou\u2019re The One That I Want\u201d just to get her attention.</p><p>Because angry Mia is fucking hot. Like, off the charts hot.</p><p>Of course, I already knew she was hot. But this ... wow.</p><p>Fucking wow.</p><p>I have never been as turned on as I am now. My dick is so hard it could pound nails. Thank god it\u2019s dark and crowded in here so no one can see my boner.</p><p>I finally catch up with her just near the dance floor. Hooking my fingers into her tank top, I reel her back to me.</p><p>She turns.</p><p>Her eyes are wide, a fire still in them. Her chest is heaving up and down, and I\u2019m literally lost for words. I have a hundred thoughts streaming through my mind\u2014none of them clean\u2014and I can\u2019t seem to find one fucking word to start a coherent sentence.</p><p>And also, I\u2019m trying really hard not to stare at her tits.</p><p>I see the anger in her eyes dim, and the Mia I know is back. \u201cOh god, Jordan, I\u2019m so sorry. What I just said back there...\u201d She covers her face with her hands. \u201cGod, I don\u2019t know what came over me. I just ... I didn\u2019t like the way she was talking about you. It just ... it made me so angry. And I don\u2019t get angry \u2013 ever.\u201d</p><p>I step into her space. Peeling her hands from her face, I hold them at her sides.</p><p>Those huge blues of hers blink up at me with total innocence. \u201cWhat you did back there was good. You stood up for yourself. Shawna was being a bitch, and she deserved what you said. I\u2019m just sorry she said those things to you because of me.\u201d</p><p>She shakes her head. \u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s not.\u201d I dip my head closer to hers. \u201cI\u2019m not happy about the way Shawna treated you just then, but I am glad you got angry. You should get angry more often.\u201d God, she should. She really should. \u201cBut mostly, I\u2019m glad that you got angry over me.\u201d Because it tells me you care, probably more than I deserve.</p><p>\u201cOh no ... oh god! I told her that I don\u2019t wear panties,\u201d she says, like she\u2019s not even heard a word I\u2019ve said. An expression of horror flitting across her face. \u201cIn the middle of the club, I said \u2018I don\u2019t wear panties\u2019.\u201d She searches out my eyes. \u201cI do wear them. All the time. Even for bed.\u201d She closes her eyes on a groan. \u201cStop talking, Mia.\u201d</p><p>I chuckle. \u201cI never thought for a second that you didn\u2019t wear panties.\u201d Just wished, hoped, prayed...</p><p>Her eyes open back up, the look in them surprisingly alert. \u201cJordan, I know it\u2019s none of my business, but ... did you actually ... go out with that girl? I only ask because ... well...\u201d she bites her lip. \u201cShe\u2019s just not a very nice person.\u201d</p><p>I wasn\u2019t expecting her to say that. I consider my answer carefully before speaking. I\u2019m not going to lie to her, but I\u2019m going to make damn sure I say it in the right way. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI never went out with Shawna \u2013 it never got that far.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.

But ... we did have sex, yes.\u201d</p><p>She steps back, moving away from me, forcing me to let go of her.</p> <p>\u201cI know you told me about what you used to do ... with women ... and it\u2019s fine, I\u2019m not judging you. Not at all. And I know this is only our first date, and I don\u2019t have a lot of experience in the dating field ... well, when it comes to men in general, but I do know one thing ... when I\u2019m with someone, I\u2019m with just them. And I want them to be the same with me. I understand if that\u2019s different for you, but if you want to be with other women while we date ... then I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m not the right girl for you.\u201d</p><p>Eh? I\u2019m not entirely sure where this is coming from. I thought I\u2019d been very clear about how I feel about her, but obviously not, so she needs to know.</p><p>And now.</p><p>\u201cMia, I\u2019ve never really been with anyone to define parameters ... I\u2019ve never had a relationship. I\u2019ve never dated anyone. You\u2019re the first person I\u2019ve ever had a real date with.\u201d</p><p>She doesn\u2019t say anything, her face blank, and I get this sudden ache in my chest.</p> <p>I feel like I\u2019m losing her before I\u2019ve even gotten her.</p><p>\u201cWhen I told you about me, the way I was, the way I behaved ... the guy who you just got a glimpse of through Shawna, that is who I was. Not who I am now.\u201d</p><p>She wraps her arms around herself in a protective manner. I hate that she feels she needs to shield herself from me.</p><p>\u201cWhat changed?\u201d Her voice is quiet, wavering.</p><p>\u201cYou.\u201d I take the chance and move close to her again, closing my hands around her upper arms. She doesn\u2019t pull away. It gives me hope. \u201cYou changed things for me.\u201d</p><p>She looks away. \u201cYou\u2019ve ... changed things for me too.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI have?\u201d</p><p>She nods, tugging on her lower lip with her thumb and forefinger.</p><p>\u201cI see you, Mia. Only you.\u201d My gaze drops to her lips.</p><p>She stops tugging on them, her hand falling to her side.</p><p>\u201cThis Is Love\u201d by Will.i.am starts to filter in the background. The piano medley eases through the crowd toward us. Mia\u2019s eyes lift to mine. My heart starts to kick a beat in my chest. Then the song explodes, like the heat between us, until there\u2019s a bonfire of want flaring all around.</p><p>Her breathing falters, coming in quick ... her eyes close on one of those sweet, short breaths ... her lips part slightly...</p><p>And I know.</p><p>This is it.</p> <p>The moment I\u2019ve been waiting for since she walked into the hotel.</p><p>I lean into her, cupping her cheek in my hand, more than ready to press my mouth to those sweet lips of hers ... and then the noise level around us increases exponentially until my ears are nearly bleeding from the squeals and screams of laughter.</p><p>And then I feel the reason for those screams of laughter when paint splatters all over me.</p><p>Mia\u2019s eyes flash open, her mouth popping to an O.</p><p>Motherfucking paint party.</p><p>They couldn\u2019t have waited like, five more fucking minutes before blasting out that shit!</p><p>I run my hand through my hair and look down at my palm. It\u2019s streaked with yellow, blue and pink neon paint. Mia\u2019s hand goes to her face. She\u2019s equally as covered with the paint as I imagine I am. Running her fingers over her cheek, then her forehead, she streaks the colors, mixing them together.</p><p>She looks even more beautiful, if possible.</p><p>Incandescent.</p><p>Exotic.</p><p>And incredibly dangerous to my heart.</p><p>She looks up to watch the continuing shower of color, shielding her eyes with her hand, and laughing.</p><p>And I can\u2019t wait a fucking second longer.</p><p>I take her face in my hands, and I kiss her. Hard.</p><p>There\u2019s a tremble in her body. I feel her tense for just a split second, then she relaxes into me and her lips part on a soft moan.</p><p>I feel it all the way down to my dick. And let\u2019s just say, he\u2019s pretty fucking happy about it.</p><p>Sliding my fingers into her hair, I cup the back of her head. \u201cIs this okay?\u201d I whisper over her lips.</p><p>She nods.</p><p>It\u2019s the only answer I need.</p><p>I kiss her deeper, slipping my tongue into her mouth, needing more of her.</p><p>Mia\u2019s hands slide up my arms. I can feel the slick of the paint between my skin and hers, and it makes the sensation of her touch even more intense.</p><p>Okay, so maybe they\u2019re onto something with this paint thing.</p><p>She inches up on her tiptoes, looping her arms around my neck, gripping my hair with her fingers, keeping me with her.</p><p>Not that she needs to because I have no intention of going anywhere right now. If ever. But I like that she wants me closer. That she doesn\u2019t want to let me go.</p><p>I wrap my arms around her tiny waist, enveloping her, lifting her small body against mine. She\u2019s so tiny, so fragile, yet so unbreakable.</p><p>She\u2019s fucking amazing.</p><p>Everything I didn\u2019t know I was looking for.</p><p>I know I\u2019m fucked. She has me now. If there were ever a chance of me going back after this one taste of her, it\u2019s gone.</p><p>I\u2019m gone for her.</p><p>I know she\u2019s meant to be leaving in a little over a week\u2019s time, but I can\u2019t let that happen. I\u2019m going to have to figure out a way to keep her in my life for good. Figure out a way for her to want to stay with me.</p><p>Chapter Sixteen</p><p>Mia</p><p>If a moment could be held in time forever, kept there to revisit and cherished, then mine would be last night.</p><p>I would box the memory, tie it tight with a ribbon, and keep it safe for always. Keep it there to open whenever I need to be reminded of a moment of wonderful.</p><p>I know for most girls, going on a date with a guy, being taken to a nightclub and sprayed with neon paint, might not be their idea of an evening to cherish.</p><p>But for me, it is.</p><p>Because it was my night. Jordan made everything about me. Focused on me. Cared if I was happy, and if I was having a good time.</p><p>Me.</p><p>It was like complete freedom while with another person.</p><p>I could dance how I wanted to dance. Talk to whomever I wanted to. Kiss who I wanted to kiss...</p><p>Jordan.</p><p>There was no fear. No control. No anger.</p><p>Just happiness.</p><p>I have never experienced anything like it, but I want to again...</p><p>And again...</p><p>And again...</p><p>It was like the best slice of freedom cake, topped with whipped cream and sprinkles.</p><p>And Jordan was the sprinkles.</p><p>We stayed at the club, wrapped up in each other. When the night was over, and it was time to leave, Jordan and I went back to the hotel together in his car, and Beth got a ride home from Toni.</p><p>He was perfect. It was perfect. And when he walked me to my door, he kissed me goodnight, the sweetest kiss of all. Then he went to his room.</p><p>I showered the paint off best I could, and fell into bed in a cloud of contentedness.</p><p>Now, I\u2019m lying in bed, wide awake at the butt crack of dawn, unable to go back to sleep. I\u2019m counting the seconds until I can see Jordan again while recounting every moment of last night\u2014barring the bumping into one of Jordan\u2019s previous conquests. I cringe when I think of what she said, and I cringe even worse when I think of what I said to her.</p><p>When I hear a knock at my door, I almost leap out of bed in my excitement, not remembering until I\u2019m opening the door that I\u2019m still in my pajamas. I probably look a complete state. I\u2019ve never really been that concerned with how I look, until him. I only ever dressed and looked nice because it was expected of me by Oliver and Forbes</p><p>\u201cMorning.\u201d His voice is low and husky. \u201cI didn\u2019t wake you, did I?\u201d</p><p>God, he looks gorgeous, even at this early hour.</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019ve been awake a while. Couldn\u2019t sleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe either. I\u2019ve had this girl on my mind all night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnyone I know?\u201d I hold back a smile.</p><p>Dozer comes into view at Jordan\u2019s side, all puppy dog eyes at me. Pushing past Jordan, he comes to me.</p><p>\u201cHey, buddy.\u201d I kneel down to stroke him.</p><p>\u201cYou might know her,\u201d Jordan says, answering my question. \u201cBlonde hair, blue eyes ... beautiful. We went out on a date last night as it happens.\u201d</p><p>He just called me beautiful.</p><p>Beautiful.</p><p>Composing myself, I look up at Jordan. \u201cReally?\u201d I say, playing along. \u201cSo how was the date?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s the thing...\u201d He crouches down, stroking Dozer who\u2019s positioned between us. His fingertips touch mine. Heat flashes up my arm careening straight for my heart.</p><p>\u201cThe date was amazing, and I haven\u2019t been able to stop thinking about her ... or her gorgeous mouth ever since...\u201d He leans over Dozer. Close to me. I suck in a breath. \u201cAnd the thing is, I really need to kiss her again.\u201d</p><p>Baboom! The sound of my heart ... so loud, I\u2019m sure he must hear it.</p><p>\u201cI think she needs you to kiss her too,\u201d I breathe.</p><p>\u201cYou do?\u201d He swipes his lower lip with his tongue.</p><p>My insides coil. \u201cMmm,\u201d I murmur.</p><p>I close my eyes as he brings his mouth to mine, more than ready to taste him and feel the explosion his kiss creates inside me.</p><p>It\u2019s only when I part my lips against his that I remember I haven\u2019t brushed my teeth.</p><p>\u201cWait,\u201d I say against his mouth, pressing my hand to his chest. \u201cI haven\u2019t brushed my teeth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShh.\u201d His hand goes to the back of my head ... holding me ... kissing me deeper. Apparently he has no issue with my morning breath. I should, but I really don\u2019t want to stop kissing him right now.</p><p>All thought is lost when he runs his tongue along my lower lip, then slips it into my mouth. I curl my fingers into his shirt.</p><p>His kisses are drugging. I could live a contented life being as high as a kite on him all day long.</p><p>He gets as close to me as he can with a hundred and sixty pound dog laid on the floor between us, and takes my face in both his hands, taking full control of the kiss. It\u2019s at this exact point that I feel things change between us.</p><p>Deepen.</p><p>Don\u2019t ask me why or how, they just do, and I know he feels it too because of the look on his face when he parts his mouth from mine on a gasp, eyes staring deep into mine.</p><p>I know, in this moment, there\u2019s an unbreakable connection between us. Something tying us together, irrevocably, and no matter what, I\u2019ll never be without him.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d I whisper.</p><p>\u201cHi.\u201d He smiles.</p><p>Dozer lifts his head between us, nudging Jordan back from me a little.</p><p>I chuckle, and stroke Dozer, giving him the attention he wants.</p><p>\u201cSo, where was I before you distracted me?\u201d He grins, still looking as dazed as I feel.</p><p>\u201cYou were telling me about the awesome date you had last night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight, yeah. Well, it was so awesome that I was hoping she\u2019d go on another date with me today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou always could ask her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think she\u2019d say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm...\u201d I press my lips together in thought. \u201cI\u2019m thinking that she\u2019d definitely say yes.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He smiles wide. \u201cGood, \u2019cause I\u2019ve got an awesome day planned for her.\u201d He leans across and gives me another quick kiss, pulling back far too quickly, leaving me wanting more.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to want to wash your hair again.\u201d He twists a piece of my hair round his finger.</p><p>\u201cWhat? Why?\u201d I touch my hair where his hand is and feel the strands of crunch. Damn paint.</p><p>\u201cBlue, and a bit of pink.\u201d He leans over, examining. \u201cIt\u2019s a good look on you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll stick with my natural color, thanks.\u201d</p><p>Chuckling, he gets to his feet. I follow.</p><p>\u201cShower. Then get your cute ass dressed ASAP so we can head out. Need an early start for where we\u2019re going.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere are we going?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll see when we get there. Come on, Dozer. Leave Mia to get ready. I\u2019ve got some sausages with your name on.\u201d</p> <p>Dozer\u2019s ears prick up at the mention of sausages. For a dog with a cast on his leg, he sure does move quickly.</p><p>\u201cTossed aside for sausages,\u201d I croon. \u201cAnd I thought we had something special, Dozer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust so you know...\u201d Jordan leans his shoulder against the door frame. \u201cI would never toss you aside for some sausage.\u201d The glint in his eye is unmistakable.</p><p>I flush bright red all the way down to my toes.</p><p>Grinning, he turns and starts off walking down the hall. \u201cOh, and make sure to wear comfortable shoes. And bring something warm, just in case.\u201d He calls to me.</p><p>\u201cWill do.\u201d I close the door behind me, catching hold of my happiness and hugging my arms tight around it.</p> <p>One thing I\u2019m starting to realize with Jordan is that moments of wonderful aren\u2019t a rarity. It seems I might just have more than one great memory with him to keep, and I\u2019m thinking my arms and heart are going to be full of them.</p><p>Dressed in jeans, t-shirt and sneakers, and carrying a hooded sweatshirt with me just in case, I\u2019m in Jordan\u2019s car, heading to town with him. He still won\u2019t tell me where we\u2019re going, but I get a pretty good idea of what we\u2019re going to be doing when he pulls up outside, White Rock Jeep Tours.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re taking me out on a jeep tour?\u201d I\u2019ve never done anything like that before.</p><p>\u201cYeah. Is that okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore than okay.\u201d I run my fingers into the back of his silky hair.</p><p>\u201cI do tours for Wade, the owner, mainly in high season,\u201d he tells me. \u201cThough, not as much this summer with Dad being away. You\u2019re safe with me. I\u2019m an official tour guide.\u201d He grins. \u201cThought I\u2019d take you up to La Plata Canyon. It\u2019s amazing there, and one of my favorite places to go. Aside from the canyon itself, there are some amazing lakes, rivers and waterfalls. Tons of wildlife ... and I remember you saying how much you like animals.\u201d</p><p>I used to think animals were much kinder than people. Until I met Jordan, that is.</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of animals?\u201d I get a frisson of excitement at the thought.</p> <p>He takes hold of my hand, moving it from his hair, and kisses my knuckles. \u201cDeer, elk, marmots, juncos. You can usually spot some hawks and eagles. And if we\u2019re real lucky, we might even see a mountain lion or a bear.\u201d</p><p>My eyes widen. \u201cLions and bears. Sounds cool.\u201d I tug on my lower lip. \u201cBut if they come too close, we\u2019ll drive away as quickly as possible from them, right?\u201d</p><p>He laughs, and places his hand on my thigh, squeezing gently. \u201cRight.\u201d</p><p>He doesn\u2019t seem to notice how my whole body freezes, which is a good thing. The freeze is a mixture of surprise, fear, but mostly want. I want Jordan\u2019s hands on me.</p><p>\u201cCome on, let\u2019s get moving.\u201d</p><p>I get out of the car and follow him over to the shop, tying my sweatshirt around my waist as I walk.</p><p>Jordan pushes the door open, and a bell announces our arrival. He lets me through first. A big man with grey hair, is behind the counter, reading a newspaper.</p><p>He looks up. \u201cJordan my boy, how you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d Jordan says, walking over to him.</p><p>They do that manly handshake thing that men do.</p><p>\u201cWade, this is my friend Mia.\u201d He introduces me.</p><p>Wade\u2019s smiling eyes move to me. I know he spots the remnant of my black eye and cut brow.</p><p>\u201cHey Mia, nice to meet you. You been in a fight there, little lady?\u201d He hints at my face.</p><p>I instantly freeze, then relax into shutdown, face impassive, the lie flowing easily from my lips. \u201cI had an interesting conversation with a flight of stairs after too many beers.\u201d</p><p>Wade chuckles. \u201cYeah, had a few of those myself. Let me just get the keys for your jeep.\u201d He pats Jordan\u2019s arm and disappears into the back.</p><p>I can feel Jordan\u2019s eyes on me. I know what he\u2019s thinking. He\u2019s wondering how I can lie so effectively, so easily, without a second thought.</p><p>It comes from years of practice.</p><p>Finally, I risk a glance at him. The look he\u2019s wearing is more confusion, showing in his puckered brow, and sadness in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cSorry about Wade asking ... you know,\u201d he says quietly. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t mean any harm. He\u2019s just a straight forward kind of guy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u201d I smile, shrugging it off. It\u2019s easy to do because the shutdown on my emotions is still in place.</p><p>Leaning down close, Jordan brings his face to mine. \u201cPretend to the rest of the world, Mia. I understand your need to do that.\u201d Lifting his hand, he runs his thumb over my lips. \u201cBut don\u2019t pretend with me.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m shocked to the core by him. All I can do is nod.</p><p>He cups my cheek and presses his lips to my forehead, pulling me close to his chest, saying the rest without words.</p><p>Every part of me is attuned to him in this moment.</p><p>I hear Wade clear his throat. Jordan and I part quickly.</p><p>Wade chuckles. \u201cHere you go.\u201d He hands Jordan the keys. \u201cI\u2019m lending you mine, didn\u2019t think you\u2019d want one of the eight seaters with just the two of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sure?\u201d Jordan checks.</p><p>Wade nods. \u201cTake her, have fun. She\u2019s parked up back. When you\u2019re done, just put her back there. If I\u2019m not here, put the keys through the mailbox.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill do. And thanks again for this, Wade, I really appreciate it.\u201d Jordan reaches over and shakes his hand.</p><p>\u201cAnytime, son. Have a good time. Say hi to your dad for me. How is he? Haven\u2019t seen him around lately.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s good, away at the moment. My grandpa had an operation, so he\u2019s there taking care of him for few weeks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet him know I was asking about him,\u201d Wade says.</p><p>\u201cWill do, thanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBye,\u201d I say, following Jordan to the door. \u201cIt was nice to meet you, Wade.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou too, little lady.\u201d</p><p>The instant we\u2019re out of the shop, I ask Jordan, \u201cHow\u2019s your grandpa doing?\u201d</p><p>Jordan looks at me with warmth in his eyes. \u201cHe\u2019s getting back to his old self. I called Dad yesterday and spoke to Grandpa on the phone. He was giving me grief, winding me up, so I know he\u2019s getting better.\u201d He smiles fondly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry I haven\u2019t asked before now. My head just gets a little filled up at times.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI get it.\u201d He touches my shoulder. \u201cNow wait here, I just need to grab something from the car.\u201d</p><p>I watch him jog over to his car, then pop the trunk and pull out a cooler bag.</p><p>\u201cFood for later,\u201d he clarifies when he reaches me.</p><p>\u201cDid you make a picnic, Jordan Matthews?\u201d</p><p>For the first time ever, I see a blush in his cheeks. \u201cI might have,\u201d he mumbles and sets off walking.</p><p>Smiling, and feeling a little ... glowy, I fall into step beside him and thread my arm through his. \u201cThank you. I\u2019ve never had a picnic before.\u201d</p><p>His look is one of surprise. \u201cNever as in \u2013 never?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever.\u201d I affirm.</p><p>He presses a kiss to the top of my head. \u201cWell, I\u2019m really glad I\u2019m taking your picnic virginity because I make a fuckin\u2019 excellent picnic.\u201d</p><p>I laugh, glad he can\u2019t see my face right now as it\u2019s gone somewhere close to resembling sunburnt red.</p><p>\u201cThat so?\u201d I try to sound casual, but it doesn\u2019t work. \u201cWell, I have nothing to compare it against, so I\u2019ll have to take your word.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, take my word. I am the best.\u201d</p><p>Jordan really is gifted with the art of flirting. His innuendos have me blushing like a teenager, and my body firing up like a porn star.</p><p>We walk around the back of the shop where I see a big red jeep waiting for us. It\u2019s covered in dirt but looks totally cool. My excitement ramps up a couple of thousand notches.</p><p>Jordan opens my door, then helps me in as it\u2019s so high off the ground and I\u2019m seriously vertically challenged.</p><p>My waist and hips are still burning from the feel of his hands as he climbs in the driver\u2019s seat. He puts the cooler on the backseat.</p><p>\u201cBuckle up, babe. I\u2019m about to take you on the ride of your life.\u201d Grinning, he starts the engine, revving it loudly.</p><p>Babe.</p><p>He called me babe.</p><p>I know it\u2019s totally stupid, but I can\u2019t keep the smile from my face at his term of endearment.</p><p>Recovering before he notices that I\u2019m acting like a complete girl, I laugh. \u201cYou\u2019re a total nerd, you know that?\u201d</p><p>He looks mock-offended. \u201cHey! I\u2019m cool, and you know it.\u201d</p><p>I roll my eyes, shaking my head.</p><p>\u201cCome on, say it ... you know you want to. Just let the words out ... \u2018Oh, Jordan. You\u2019re so cool and so awesome.\u2019 There\u2019s no need to be embarrassed to speak the truth, babe.\u201d He gives a cocky grin.</p><p>I let out a laugh. \u201cI like how you\u2019re adding to it. I\u2019ll give you that you play cool and drive an awesome car, but underneath it all is a nerd trying to bust out.\u201d</p><p>Throwing his head back, he laughs loud. It\u2019s deep and manly. And wonderful.</p><p>\u201cWounded here.\u201d He dramatically presses his hand to his heart. \u201cHere I was thinking I had you learned to my awesome ways. Guess I\u2019m just going to have to wow you with my amazing tour guide abilities.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSaid like a true nerd.\u201d I grin.</p><p>We chat with ease while Jordan drives us out to La Plata Canyon.</p><p>When we reach the canyon, I\u2019m blown away. I\u2019ve never seen anything like it before. We don\u2019t have these kind of places in Boston, and it warms my heart to Colorado. I can see why my mother returned here to live.</p><p>My mother.</p><p>I haven\u2019t thought about her in days. Not because I\u2019d forgotten, but because Jordan has become the focus of my thoughts. When I think of my mother, and how she abandoned me, it makes things hurt. I don\u2019t want to hurt. I just want to feel all the wonderful things that I feel when I\u2019m with him.</p><p>I know I can\u2019t avoid it forever. Finding my mother is what brought me here. But for today, I choose not to think about it.</p><p>\u201cThis is Lake Creek we\u2019re crossing over,\u201d Jordan says as he drives us over a wooden bridge. I peer out my window to look below at the water. Pretty. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAnd that\u2019s La Plata Peak.\u201d Jordan points to mountain covered with scatterings of snow. \u201cIt\u2019s a great place to hike up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLooks beautiful,\u201d I murmur.</p><p>\u201cWe can hike up there one day if you\u2019d like? I\u2019d take you today, but we haven\u2019t got the right equipment with us.\u201d</p><p>A promise of more time with Jordan? Um, yes, please!</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019d like that.\u201d I smile.</p><p>The drive through the canyon is amazing. Jordan stops often to point out certain things to me. He knows this place so well, and he sounds so enthralling when he\u2019s telling me about the canyons history.</p><p>We stop and get out of the jeep to go look at Jordan\u2019s favorite lake. It\u2019s deep in the canyon and the peaks around it are snow-capped. The water is the bluest of blues that I\u2019ve ever seen, and right in the middle of the lake is a raised rock formation.</p><p>I close my eyes and imagine what it would be like to sit out there on that rock, the water all around me.</p><p>Complete solitude. Freedom.</p> <p>Peace. Just peace.</p><p>I wonder if the pain in my heart and the haunt in my head would just disappear, and I would finally be free of everything.</p><p>Jordan comes up behind and wraps his arms around my waist. His heat surrounds me. I feel safe in his arms.</p><p>\u201cTell me about your travels,\u201d I murmur, content.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want to know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere you\u2019ve been.\u201d</p> <p>He snuggles his face into the crook of my neck. \u201cI\u2019ve been to the Philippines, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, Vietnam, Cambodia and Thailand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow. That\u2019s a lot of places.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm. My buddies and I wanted to see the world, so we figured we\u2019d start with South East Asia. Backpacking, working as we went, fitting in as much as we could \u2013 we stayed in a lot of dives.\u201d He chuckles. \u201cBut I didn\u2019t care, I just wanted to see the world.\u201d He eases out a breath. It\u2019s hot on my skin, flowing through me, setting my stomach to tumult. \u201cWe were about to head off to India ... when I got the news about my mom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry, Jordan.\u201d I wrap my arms around his, holding him. \u201cDo you ever think you\u2019ll travel again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>He moves his nose up my neck, inhaling. It does crazy things to my body. \u201cYou smell so fuckin\u2019 good. Like vanilla.\u201d</p><p>I know he\u2019s evading, but it\u2019s hard to care in this moment. Tingles run south, and I can feel my panties getting damp. \u201cI use vanilla body wash.\u201d My voice sounds breathy. Not like me at all.</p> <p>He breathes me in again. \u201cIt smells amazing.\u201d His hand frees, smoothing down the flat of my stomach, and he hooks a finger into my belt loop, pulling me against him.</p><p>I can feel him against my back, and my body starts to react, instantly lighting up ... wanting to feel more of him ... feel more of this.</p><p>\u201cI love this lake,\u201d he says close to my ear, his breath tickling and arousing me. \u201cIt reminds me of the caldera I saw at Mount Rinjani.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s that?\u201d asks the totally unworldly me.</p><p>\u201cIndonesia.\u201d Placing a hand on my cheek, he turns my face to him. \u201cYou have the exact same eye color as the water there.\u201d</p><p>My mouth dries. \u201cI do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm.\u201d His gaze moves to my mouth. My tongue darts out to moisten my suddenly dry lips.</p><p>His eyes flare. \u201cAre you hungry?\u201d he asks.</p><p>I\u2019m not entirely sure that we\u2019re talking about food right now. \u201cI\u2019m hungry,\u201d I say in a voice that doesn\u2019t sound like mine. It\u2019s all breathy and sexy.</p><p>Without another word, Jordan crushes his mouth to mine, his tongue instantly in my mouth. I turn in his arms. He pulls me hard against him.</p><p>I like the way it makes me feel. Protected. Wanted. He makes me feel sexy and desirable. Everything I\u2019ve never before felt.</p><p>Our kiss quickly turns heated and desperate. I wind my fingers into his hair, pulling it, keeping him with me. He must like it because the sound he makes in my mouth is more than encouraging. He cups my behind and lifts me off my feet. Instinctively, I wrap my legs around his waist. I don\u2019t even realize we\u2019ve moved until I feel my back press up against the jeep.</p><p>His kiss is urgent, mirroring my own. I\u2019m shocked by my reaction to him ... how much I want him, but I\u2019m confused\u2014confused by the lust that is urging my body to pull him closer, yet the fear telling me to push him away.</p><p>Would he stop if I did? Do I want him to stop?</p><p>No.</p><p>Not yet.</p><p>\u201cGod, Mia,\u201d he says against my mouth. His hand moves up my side, cupping my breast over my t-shirt. The instant he touches me, my nipple hardens. I moan against his mouth.</p><p>His hand is moving under my t-shirt, lifting it, and his fingers are running inside the cup of my bra, and I\u2019m thinking yes ... god, yes! He pulls down my bra, taking my bare breast in his warm, rough hand, running his thumb over the hardened peak...</p><p>I want him so much...</p><p>Then I feel him harden against me. His erection pressing against my girl parts...</p><p>And a flash of Forbes, pinning me to that wall, trying to rape me, takes away everything with it.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to fuck some sense into you. You need teaching a lesson.\u201d</p><p>Jordan\u2019s hand suddenly becomes Forbes\u2019 hand. And there\u2019s no pleasure. Just fear. Pure unadulterated fear.</p><p>And panic.</p><p>I\u2019m panicking. My muscles locking with the fear controlling me.</p><p>I\u2019m going to be sick.</p><p>\u201cStop. Please, stop.\u201d I\u2019m breathless, pushing at his hand.</p><p>I need him off me, now.</p><p>Jordan removes his hand from my t-shirt instantly, putting it onto the truck above my head. \u201cJesus, I\u2019m sorry. Mia, are you okay?\u201d He searches my face. \u201cTell me you\u2019re okay? Shit, I moved too quick. I wasn\u2019t thinking. I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d He\u2019s shaking his head.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, I just ... I wanted...\u201d I can hardly catch my breath. \u201cI think ... I just ... I can\u2019t. Not right now. I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMia, no...\u201d He rests his forehead against mine. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to explain. You never have to explain to me. And don\u2019t ever be sorry. I\u2019m the one who\u2019s sorry. I just got lost in you for a moment there, but it won\u2019t ever happen again.\u201d His tone is vehement, full of promise. \u201cFrom now on, I follow your lead. We go as slow, or as fast as you want.\u201d</p><p>The sound of his voice, his words, calm me \u2013 soothe me like nothing I\u2019ve ever known.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d I breathe.</p><p>It takes me a moment to gather myself, but when I do, I take his face in my hands. \u201cYou\u2019re the best person I\u2019ve ever known, Jordan.\u201d</p><p>He stares into my eyes for a long moment. \u201cDitto, babe. Ditto.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Seventeen</p><p>Jordan</p><p>I\u2019ve completely screwed things up with Mia.</p><p>Not surprising as this is me we\u2019re talking about. I started thinking with my cock instead of my brain when I had her pressed up against Wade\u2019s jeep.</p><p>She felt so fucking amazing against me, and I wanted her so bad, but then she start panicking, her fear was palpable.</p><p>And I felt like the world\u2019s biggest asshole.</p><p>I still feel like an asshole.</p><p>I know what she\u2019s been through, but I just dove straight in. I should have asked if it was okay to touch her; I should have checked that every move I made was okay. I just thought from the way she was being with me that she was okay and that she was right there with me.</p><p>How fucking wrong was I?</p><p>She was quiet after that, not surprising. I drove us up to this ridge which is covered with wildflowers and has a great view of the canyon. I thought she would like it up there, and I was right. She seemed to perk up slightly, and was back to herself soon after, but not completely back to how she\u2019d originally been with me. The openness from her and the sense of closeness it gave me was gone.</p><p>She\u2019d shut down.</p><p>We ate, did some more sightseeing, and I made sure not to touch her the whole time.</p><p>It was hard, but I said I\u2019d follow her lead and I meant it.</p><p>She didn\u2019t make any move to touch me.</p><p>That was three days ago.</p><p>We haven\u2019t kissed, touched, or held hands, since.</p><p>We\u2019ve been to the movies, to dinner, just hanging out at the hotel, but it\u2019s like we\u2019re back to the way we were before \u2013 just friends.</p><p>Yesterday, we had another unsuccessful trip out to find her mother.</p><p>With only two Anna\u2019s left, Mia couldn\u2019t pick which one to go to, so she\u2019d made me choose. Not easy to do, so I\u2019d just shut my eyes and jabbed my finger at the paper. That was how I\u2019d picked our next Anna to visit. I only wish I had got the other one because this one was the same as the last.</p><p>Not Mia\u2019s Anna.</p><p>At first, I\u2019d thought she was. Blonde and tiny, just like Mia. A really nice lady. When I\u2019d told her why we were there, she took us inside, sat us in the living room and made us tea. Then she proceeded to tell us, in a really nice way, why there was no way she could be Mia\u2019s mother.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t have children.</p><p>To say I\u2019d felt like complete shit was an understatement.</p><p>We chatted awhile, but I felt Mia slowly slipping farther away. I hated the feeling more than I could begin to express.</p><p>Anna offered us more tea, so out of politeness I\u2019d said yes. As Anna got up to go to the kitchen, she\u2019d paused and turned to Mia. \u201cIf I had been blessed with a child, then I would have wanted one as lovely as you.\u201d</p><p>It had been a compliment, but it had hurt Mia. I could see it written all over her face...</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d I asked her quietly.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>I wasn\u2019t sure if she had heard me or not. She was transfixed, watching Anna Monroe with curiosity. And longing. I could see it plain on her face. I knew Mia wished that she were her mother.</p><p>It made me hurt for her. And I worried that coming here had been a mistake. I was starting to think this search for her mother was causing her more harm than good, when Mia stood abruptly.</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d I asked again, getting to my feet and moving toward her.</p><p>Her blue eyes came to me, but she wasn\u2019t there. She was already some place lost, and buried deep in those beautiful blues was panic. She thought she was hiding it, but I saw it.</p><p>Because I see her.</p><p>\u201cI have to go,\u201d she uttered, her eyes flitting to the front door.</p><p>I know when Mia needs to leave, there\u2019s no small talk, no pleasantries. She just has to go \u2013 I\u2019d figured that out from the visit to the first Anna Monroe.</p><p>Nodding, I took her cold hand. \u201cSure, babe. Let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>And I got her out of there.</p><p>Mia hadn\u2019t talked the whole ride back home, and the instant we\u2019d arrived, she\u2019d just got out of the car, and went straight to her room.</p><p>I\u2019d left her be.</p><p>I didn\u2019t see her the whole night. I knew she needed space, so I gave it to her.</p><p>When she came out of her room this morning, she looked weary and drawn, not like herself at all. She told me she was going out, and I was disappointed.</p><p>I miss her.</p><p>I know it sounds crazy because I see her all the time, but I miss being able to touch her. Miss just being with her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She\u2019s been out all day. I\u2019m starting to think she might be avoiding me.</p><p>Honestly, I don\u2019t know what to think.</p><p>And thinking is all I\u2019ve done, and it\u2019s messing with my head.</p><p>I hate not knowing where I stand with her. Are we back to being just friends? Have I fucked it up completely with her? Has she changed her mind about me ... us?</p><p>I can\u2019t just come out and ask her. I\u2019m worried if I do, I\u2019ll hear something I don\u2019t want to.</p><p>I stand up, feeling irritated and frustrated, and angry with myself. It\u2019s a fucking hot day, and it hasn\u2019t cooled with the sun going down.</p><p>Dozer lifts his head and gives a sad sigh. He\u2019s missing her too.</p><p>Fuck this. I need to cool off.</p><p>I strip my tank and shorts off, leaving just my boxer shorts on. I run toward the lake, down the boardwalk, and dive straight in.</p><p>The cold waters hits me, making me feel instantly clearer. I swim under the water until my lungs start to burn, forcing me to resurface. I scrub my hands over my face, drying off the water, and push my hair back. Blinking the water off my lashes, I tip my head back and float in the water as I stare up at the sky.</p><p>I\u2019ve no idea how long I stay there like that, but when I decide to swim back, I push my legs down and lift my head to see Mia standing at the edge of the boardwalk watching me.</p><p>She looks like an angel silhouetted by the glow of the early evening sky.</p><p>Taking a deep breath, I swim to her, reaching a few feet from the boardwalk when I\u2019m stopped in my tracks.</p><p>Fingers gripping the hem of her shirt, she pulls it over her head, dropping it to the floor.</p><p>The air is knocked out of me, and I can only stare at the gorgeous sight of her. Denim shorts and a white lace bra make for a sexy image.</p><p>She looks like a fucking angel. A sexy fucking angel.</p><p>Then she unbuttons her shorts and slides them down her legs, stepping out.</p><p>She\u2019s wearing matching lace panties.</p><p>Thank you god.</p><p>I\u2019m transfixed. I have never seen anything as beautiful as her.</p><p>Sitting on the edge of the boardwalk, she swings her legs in the water. Hands on the sides, she slides down, submerging herself.</p><p>She swims close to me. \u201cHi,\u201d she says quietly.</p><p>\u201cHi.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry I haven\u2019t been around. I just\u2014\u201d</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cMia, you don\u2019t have to explain anything\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I do. And I will. But not right now. Right now, all I want is for you to kiss me ... and make love to me.\u201d</p><p>Fuck. Me.</p><p>I suck in a breath.</p><p>I want her. Really want her.</p><p>Half an hour ago, I would have sold my Mustang if it meant I could be with her.</p><p>But now ... I don\u2019t know what this means. She\u2019s been gone all day, and now she turns up, strips off her clothes, and tells me she wants me to make love to her.</p><p>My cock is telling my brain to shut the fuck up, and just do it, but my head is worried if I do, I\u2019ll only end up pushing her further away.</p><p>\u201cI need you, Jordan ... please,\u201d she whispers.</p><p>Hearing her plead like that ... I\u2019m done for. Add in the fact that I haven\u2019t had sex for weeks, and she is the most beautiful woman I\u2019ve had the privilege to know, and my willpower is shot to fucking hell.</p><p>My hand goes to the back of her head and I bring my mouth crashing down to hers.</p><p>She moans, her arms instantly going around my neck, her legs wrapping around my waist.</p><p>Jesus fucking Christ.</p><p>I wrap both my arms around her tiny waist, kissing her like there\u2019s no breath left in my body. Like she\u2019s my lifeline. With our mouths melded together, I lick the inside of her mouth. She tastes like a mixture of candy and mouthwash.</p><p>Her hands slide down my arms, into the water and then across my back. Her fingers creep into the elastic of my boxers.</p><p>\u201cI want you,\u201d she breathes into my mouth.</p><p>Then my goddamn brain has to kick back in. I really fucking hate my brain at times.</p><p>\u201cWait.\u201d I pull back, breathing hard.</p><p>The disappointment shows clear in her eyes. I take her face in my hands.</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t have to do this now. I\u2019ll wait, however long you need. I just want to be with you. That\u2019s all that matters. Sex can come later.\u201d</p><p>Her grip on my boxer shorts increases, and I can feel her nails digging in my skin. \u201cI don\u2019t want to wait. I want you now. I want to feel normal and complete and whole, and I feel all those things when I\u2019m with you.\u201d</p><p>My heart sinks.</p><p>I shake my head, solemn. \u201cBabe, having sex with me isn\u2019t going to change how you feel about yourself. Those things will still be there afterwards.\u201d</p><p>Who the fuck am I nowadays? Dr. Fucking Phil?</p><p>\u201cBut they\u2019ll be gone for a time.\u201d</p><p>I shake my head again because I don\u2019t know what else to do. To be honest, I\u2019m feeling pretty fucking gutted right now.</p><p>Her gaze lowers. \u201cYou don\u2019t want me,\u201d she whispers, starting to pull away.</p><p>The tone in her voice almost kills me.</p><p>Keeping hold, I force her eyes to mine. \u201cI want you, babe. Believe me, I want you like I\u2019ve never wanted anything before in my life. I can think of nothing else but you. What it would feel like to be inside you. I want you because I\u2019m gone for you.\u201d I let out a light sigh, my gaze dipping. \u201cBut I want you to have sex with me because you want it for the same reasons as I do \u2013 and no other reason.\u201d</p><p>She leans in and sucks my bottom lip into her mouth. \u201cI want you because, since the day I met you, I\u2019ve thought of nothing else but what it would feel like to have you inside me.\u201d</p><p>And just like that, my brain is gone.</p><p>I kiss her with everything I have. I kiss her like I don\u2019t know how long I have left with her. And maybe that\u2019s because I don\u2019t.</p><p>She rubs herself up against my aching cock, and the need to be inside her becomes urgent.</p><p>\u201cFuck, Mia,\u201d I groan.</p><p>Keeping hold of her, I wade through the water and walk up the bank, not wanting to let go of her for one second, with only one destination is in mind \u2013 my bed.</p><p>Mia\u2019s hands are gripping my shoulders, nails digging in my damp skin. Her wet tits are pressed up against my chest, begging for me to touch them.</p><p>Sliding the palm of my hand over the lace of her bra, I rub her already hard nipple through it. Then I move my hand up, around the nape of her neck, driving my fingers into her hair, I take her mouth again in a deep, hard kiss.</p><p>She moans a sound so fucking erotic that I almost lose my shit right here.</p><p>When I finally reach my room, I kick the door shut, then lay her down on my bed.</p><p>My room is in darkness, the only light coming in through the window. I really want to see her, so I reach for the lamp, but she stops me.</p><p>\u201cLeave it off.\u201d</p><p>What? Why?</p><p>I want to see every gorgeous inch of her, but because it\u2019s her, and I know she\u2019ll have her reasons, I let it go and slowly retract my hand.</p><p>We can forego the light, but after tonight, I\u2019m going to have every light in this goddamn room on so that I can see every beautiful inch of her.</p><p>I stare down at her, letting my eyes adjust to the dark. I see the creamy skinned silhouette of Mia on my bed, and it turns me on in a way I didn\u2019t know possible.</p><p>I\u2019ve never had a woman in my bed before. This has always been my space, but I want to share my space with her. I want her here. I want her in every aspect of my life.</p><p>Climbing up on the bed, I kneel between her parted legs.</p><p>I lean over her, hands pressing into the mattress either side of her head. I dip my mouth down and kiss her once.</p><p>Then I trail my hand with featherlight movements down her face, going down her neck until I reach the peak of breasts where her still damp skin awaits me.</p><p>\u201cIs this okay?\u201d I check before diving in.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d She sounds breathy and sexy. So damn hot.</p><p>Lifting her hand to my head, she slides her fingers into my damp hair.</p><p>I free one strap off her shoulder, letting it fall as I move the cup, freeing her breast.</p><p>Her nipple is taut, and so very ready for me.</p><p>I dip my head and take her into my mouth, sucking hard. She groans, her hips jerking upward, pressing her pussy hard against my cock. I nearly shoot my load.</p><p>\u201cFuck,\u201d I groan. I grip her hip with my hand, keeping her steady. I intend on making this last for as long as possible.</p><p>I return my attention to her nipple, laving it with my tongue, then I begin licking and sucking every part of her tit. Not content with the limited access, I ease my hand behind her, reaching for the clasp on her bra. She inclines, allowing me to unhook it, and I slide it down her arms, tossing it to the floor.</p><p>She lays back, hands on my shoulders.</p><p>I stare down at her naked tits, unable to look away. \u201cFuck ... Mia, you\u2019re beautiful.\u201d</p><p>Her hand goes to her face, covering it. I know she\u2019s feeling shy.</p><p>I move her hand from her face. \u201cYou\u2019re beautiful,\u201d I reaffirm and press a gentle kiss to her lips.</p><p>I shift down her body, allowing me access to her neglected tit. I take it in my mouth, paying it the same attention, sucking and licking while I pinch her other nipple with my thumb and finger.</p><p>She cries out. Pushing against me, panting, \u201cJordan, please. I need you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck. You\u2019re so fucking hot.\u201d I drop my head against her chest. \u201cI wanted this to last, but I don\u2019t know if I can.\u201d</p><p>Getting to my knees, I hook my fingers into the top of her damp panties. I pause, giving her time to let me know if this is too much.</p><p>She nods her head, lightly. \u201cPlease,\u201d she says.</p><p>I pull her panties down her legs. She bends her leg, allowing me to slip it off one leg, then the other. I toss them to the floor and look down at her pussy. It\u2019s shaved and neat. I bet she tastes as sweet as she smells.</p><p>My cock hardens further. I grab it through my wet boxers, sliding the shaft up and down, all the while staring at her pussy.</p><p>\u201cI need to taste you.\u201d I\u2019m asking, but I don\u2019t wait for her answer because I\u2019m off the end of the bed, knees on the floor, spreading her thighs.</p><p>I press my mouth to her pussy, sucking on her clit. Jesus, she tastes amazing.</p><p>She cries out, making a mewling sound, digging her heels into the bed. I smile, loving her reaction as I run my nose between her lips, inhaling her.</p><p>\u201cSo fuckin\u2019 good,\u201d I murmur, knowing the vibration of my voice will only tease her further.</p><p>\u201cPlease, Jordan...\u201d she moans. \u201cI need...\u201d</p><p>I run my tongue down, pushing it inside her, taking more of her sweetness into my mouth. \u201cShh ... it\u2019s okay. I got you, babe.\u201d I press my tongue against her clit and slide a finger inside her. Then another.</p><p>Then I\u2019m pumping my fingers in and out, licking and sucking her. And I don\u2019t stop going until she\u2019s exploding under my mouth.</p><p>While she\u2019s coming down from her orgasm, I remove my boxer shorts in the fastest time known to man, and climb up her panting, trembling body, so ready to be inside her it\u2019s not even funny.</p><p>I kiss her, running my tongue over her lips, letting her taste herself on me.</p><p>She sucks my tongue into her mouth. Her fingers dig into my hips, pulling me closer. \u201cI want you,\u201d she breathes.</p><p>Jesus. She\u2019s so fucking sexy. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I reach over into my drawer, and pull out an unopened box of condoms that I\u2019d bought when Mia and I started dating.</p><p>Call it forward planning.</p><p>I\u2019m an optimistic kind of guy. And that was optimistic, not opportunistic.</p><p>Turns out I was right to buy them and keep them in here. I used to keep condoms in my car or wallet. But Mia isn\u2019t one of those girls I used to go with, and I knew when I did have sex with her, it would be here, happening exactly as it is.</p> <p>I rip the box open, tear the foil on one, and roll the condom on. Positioning myself between her legs, I press the head of my cock at her entrance. I stop to kiss her\u2014not rough and passionate, but sweet and tender. I want her to know what she means to me. How I feel about her. How much I want this with her.</p><p>Her hands grip my ass, urging me forward.</p><p>Taking her lead, I slowly slide inside her. \u201cMia...\u201d I moan her name like a prayer.</p><p>Her hips shift under me. \u201cJordan,\u201d she breathes.</p><p>Kissing her again, I pull out and slide back in. \u201cYou feel so fuckin\u2019 good. I\u2019ve never wanted anyone like I want you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh God,\u201d she moans, digging her nails in my back, scratching over my skin.</p><p>The feel of her nails...</p><p>Being inside her...</p><p>I lose it. I start fucking her like I\u2019ve never fucked anyone before.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t stop, Jordan. Don\u2019t ever stop.\u201d Mia\u2019s legs lift, wrapping around my waist as I continue to drive into her.</p><p>It\u2019s too much. She\u2019s too much. All these feelings and emotions and sensations...</p> <p>All for her...</p><p>Because of her...</p><p>And I have no clue what to do with them.</p><p>I take her hands above her head, holding them to the bed. I lace my fingers with hers, thrusting my cock in and out, watching her face, seeing her pleasure, soaking up every moan and whisper of my name that she makes.</p><p>It\u2019s not long before I feel her tightening around my cock, and I know she\u2019s almost there.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it, babe,\u201d I pant over her mouth. \u201cCome for me.\u201d</p><p>The instant I feel her coming around me, I explode inside her, coming hard like I\u2019ve never come before.</p><p>Catching our breaths, I stay inside her, reluctant to leave her just yet.</p> <p>I press a soft kiss to her lips.</p><p>\u201cWow,\u201d she murmurs.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d say that just about covers it.\u201d</p><p>She giggles. It\u2019s the sweetest sound.</p><p>I rest my forehead against hers, breathing her in. \u201cI\u2019m crazy about you, Mia.\u201d I need her to know how I feel. How much she means to me. I need her to know everything that I\u2019m not sure how to say yet.</p><p>Her fingers touch my face. The barest of touches, but I feel it like she\u2019s drumming on my soul.</p><p>\u201cI feel the same,\u201d she whispers.</p><p>My heart exhales, only now realizing how badly I needed to hear those words from her.</p><p>\u201cGive me a second to clean up.\u201d Easing out of her, I go to the bathroom, disposing of the condom and quickly washing up.</p><p>When I\u2019m done, I pull the covers out from under her, and climb on the bed, covering us both. Pulling her to me, I curl my body around her, tucking her into me, and holding her tight.</p><p>I\u2019m cuddling. After sex.</p><p>And I don\u2019t want to run. I don\u2019t want to be anywhere else but here with Mia in my arms.</p><p>A sense of peace like I\u2019ve never know washes over me.</p><p>I\u2019m drowning in her. And I want every last drop of Mia in my lungs until all I\u2019m breathing is her.</p><p>She strokes my arm with her fingers. \u201cI\u2019m happy,\u201d she whispers.</p><p>I smile against her soft skin. \u201cMe too, babe.\u201d</p><p>She turns over to face me, a grin on her gorgeous mouth.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I ask.</p><p>She runs her finger down my chest. \u201cCan we, um ... do it again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow?\u201d I lift an eyebrow.</p><p>\u201cMmm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe might need a minute to get some life back in him,\u201d I say gesturing to my cock.</p><p>She reaches her hand down, wrapping her small fingers around me, and my cock springs to life at her touch.</p><p>\u201cOkay, maybe a minute was over exaggerating it,\u201d I say, grinning as I push her onto her back. Climbing on top of her, loving the laughter spilling from her lips, which I take into me as I seal my mouth over hers.</p><p>Chapter Eighteen</p><p>Mia</p><p>I can feel warmth on my back. Fingers trailing lightly over my skin. I can\u2019t remember every feeling such contentment when waking.</p><p>Then I remember where I am, and who is touching my back.</p><p>Jordan.</p><p>I\u2019m in his bed.</p><p>Last night comes flooding back to me. A vivid beautiful memory of the sex Jordan and I had.</p><p>Then horror hits when I realize I\u2019m naked.</p><p>Completely bare. Laid on my stomach.</p><p>My body is uncovered.</p><p>And Jordan\u2019s awake.</p><p>He\u2019s seen my scars. Probably looking at them right now.</p><p>I feel sick.</p><p>I meant to wake up before him and put my clothes on. I wasn\u2019t ready for him to see them. Not ready for him to question me about them.</p><p>This all my stupid fault.</p><p>After seeing Anna Monroe number two yesterday ... and how nice she was to me, and the disappointment I felt that she wasn\u2019t my mother ... coupled with the fact that the last Anna left on the list might actually be my mother...</p><p>It set off another episode which sent me running to a convenience store, then a motel where I holed myself up for the day and binged myself sick.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d Jordan said softly as I walked through the lobby.</p><p>I knew he was behind the reception desk, I just couldn\u2019t bring myself to look at him, knowing what I was going out to do. I was afraid he\u2019d see it written all over my face.</p><p>I hadn\u2019t spoken to him since yesterday. He\u2019d been so sweet to me about the Anna thing, but I was lost somewhere deep inside my head ... I still was.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going out,\u201d I said. And that was it.</p><p>Then I was out the door and in my car, driving to the convenience store on the outskirts of town and buying what I needed to make myself feel better in the only way I know how.</p><p>I parked in a quiet spot and started to rip open the food, then realization hit me, quickly followed by panic. What if someone saw me out here? What if Jordan had followed me and knew what I was doing? It was irrational, I knew that, but my head was a mess.</p><p>The what ifs were there, and they weren\u2019t leaving anytime soon.</p><p>How would I explain to him? How would I make him understand?</p><p>I wouldn\u2019t. I\u2019d lose him.</p><p>That was when I saw the sign for a motel just down the street.</p><p>Shoving the food back in the bag, I set my car in drive and drove to the motel.</p><p>It looked sketchy and rundown, but I didn\u2019t care about that. I just needed to be alone, so I got a room.</p><p>Once in it, I sat down on the bed and ripped into the food. As the food hit my palette, a discontented peace slid through me that I had needed to feel since I\u2019d left Anna Monroe\u2019s house.</p><p>I\u2019d hit low. And after I was done, all I\u2019d wanted was Jordan. It was like an urgent panic ... a desperate need to be with him.</p><p>He\u2019s the only person who has ever made me feel good and whole.</p><p>I\u2019d wanted him to give me those feelings back, so I\u2019d cleaned up, then was out of that hotel and in my car, driving back here to him ... taking my clothes off ... asking him to make love to me...</p><p>I just hadn\u2019t thought beyond that. The possibility of him seeing me. Seeing my scars.</p><p>I need to get out of here.</p><p>Moving quickly, I slide out of bed, taking the sheet with me so I can wrap it around myself.</p><p>\u201cMorning,\u201d he says. I can hear the careful in his voice.</p><p>I can\u2019t bring myself to meet his eye. \u201cMorning,\u201d I say. \u201cI just ... need to use the bathroom.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m in there a second later, locking the door behind me. Moving to the sink, I stare at myself in the mirror above it. I hate what I see staring back.</p><p>I sit down on the toilet, trying to control my emotions, the urges I\u2019m having right now.</p><p>I need to get dressed and out of here, but I can\u2019t because I left my clothes outside when I was stripping in front of Jordan.</p><p>What was I thinking? I don\u2019t act that way. That isn\u2019t me.</p><p>But he makes me want to be that way. He makes me want to be something ... someone, better.</p><p>And now he\u2019s seen the hideous scars I hide, and it\u2019s going to be too much for him. I\u2019m going to lose him, just when I\u2019d got him.</p><p>A gentle knock on the door. \u201cMia? Are you okay in there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d My voice breaks. \u201cI\u2019ll be right out.\u201d</p><p>Wrapping the sheet tight around my body, I slowly open the bathroom door.</p><p>Jordan is sitting on the edge of the bed wearing black boxer shorts. Nothing more.</p><p>If I wasn\u2019t in my current messed up state, I would take my time and truly appreciate his fine body which I\u2019m seeing for the first time in daylight.</p><p>To say he\u2019s toned is putting it mildly. I could happily run my pinky finger along the lines of his six-pack for hours.</p><p>His eyes lift to mine. \u201cHey,\u201d he says in a gentle voice. Getting to his feet, he comes over to me.</p><p>Wanting him to touch me so badly, yet afraid what it\u2019ll do to me if he does, I sidestep him.</p><p>\u201cThank you ... for last night.\u201d Thank you? I couldn\u2019t think of anything better to say? \u201cI\u2019m going to go to my room...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait.\u201d His voice comes from behind me. \u201cDon\u2019t leave. Talk to me.\u201d</p><p>I sigh and turn around. \u201cWhat do you want to talk about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis ... you and me.\u201d He gestures a hand between us. \u201cThe way you\u2019re acting now \u2013 shutting me out. I thought after last night...\u201d He scrubs a hand over his bed hair. \u201cLook, I think I know why you\u2019re acting this way ... why you wouldn\u2019t let me turn the light on last night ... the scars on your bottom and thighs...\u201d</p><p>I visibly cringe. \u201cYou don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about.\u201d I can feel my traitor eyes filling with tears.</p><p>\u201cSo tell me.\u201d He takes a step toward me, holding his hands out.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you can. You\u2019ve told me the other things that bastard did to you. You can tell me this. I haven\u2019t laid judgment, and I\u2019m not about to start. Babe, I\u2019m here...\u201d</p><p>I shake my head. A tear drips from my eyelashes. \u201cForbes didn\u2019t do this to me.\u201d</p><p>His face freezes. I see his fingers curl into his palm. \u201cWho?\u201d His word comes out slow.</p><p>Fear courses through me. I feel exposed. I wrap my arms around myself, wishing so very badly that I was dressed right now.</p><p>\u201cWho, Mia?\u201d I can hear the anger rising in his voice. I know he\u2019s not angry at me, he\u2019s angry at who hurt me.</p><p>Another tear hits my cheek. I rub it away with the back of my hand and take a gulp of air.</p><p>\u201cOliver. My father.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour dad did this to you?\u201d The disbelief in his voice hurts me. It makes me feel like trash.</p><p>\u201cYeah, well not everyone is lucky to have a great dad like yours, Jordan.\u201d I don\u2019t mean to sound bitter, but I can\u2019t seem to stop myself. \u201cMy father wasn\u2019t the caring kind of man who loved his child like yours does. Mine was a sick, cruel bastard who used to beat me whenever the feeling would take him, usually with his belt. The scars are from that.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I yank the sheet from my body, exposing myself. I turn my back to him. I\u2019m feeling insane levels of pain, and have absolutely no sense of anything right now. I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m doing or where my mind is at. I\u2019m just doing...</p><p>\u201cIf I\u2019d been particularly bad, as he put it, which wouldn\u2019t take much ... just leaving the cap off the milk. Or the especially bad crimes I could commit ... being a minute late when returning home from school \u2013 then he\u2019d use the metal buckle end of his belt. You know, to cause more pain and damage. Helped make his point.\u201d</p><p>Hot tears are dripping down my face. I leave them burning my skin so that I can feel something. Because I need to feel something. Anything.</p><p>\u201cHe taunted me with knives and guns. All part of his sick games \u2013 letting me know where I stood in the food chain. I\u2019ve lost count of the number of cracked ribs and broken bones I\u2019ve had. Broken fingers that I\u2019ve reset myself. Dislocated shoulders. Popped out knees from his boots stamping on them.\u201d I pull in a hard, painful breath. \u201cSo that was my life, and now you know all of it, and I\u2019m leaving.\u201d</p> <p>I grab the sheet, covering myself, my self-loathing possessing me like a disease. All I want is to get out of here, but Jordan is quick.</p><p>His arms come around me from behind, caging me to him. I don\u2019t fight to leave because part of me doesn\u2019t want to. I want his care, more than anything.</p><p>I don\u2019t want to be alone anymore.</p><p>I feel the tremble in his body. He presses his cheek to mine. My eyes close on the pain that\u2019s burning me from the inside out.</p><p>\u201cNo, Mia,\u201d he whispers. \u201cNo.\u201d</p> <p>The feel of his arms, his hands ... his safe hands that I know would never hurt me...</p><p>I break.</p><p>Like glass shattering, I go. My legs give out, but Jordan is there, holding me. Lifting me into his arms, he carries me to the bed.</p><p>I wrap myself around him, burying my face in his chest as I cling to him and cry out years and years of deeply buried pain.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here ... I\u2019ve got you ... always. I\u2019ll never let anyone hurt you ever again, Mia. I swear.\u201d</p><p>At some point, I fall asleep. The sheer exhaustion from crying, and reliving my past pain with Jordan had taken its toll.</p> <p>When I wake, my eyes are swollen, and my head is sore and heavy.</p><p>I lift my head from Jordan\u2019s chest, blinking my blurry eyes into focus. His are closed, but his arms immediately tighten around me.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t leave.\u201d He opens his eyes.</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t,\u201d I whisper, my voice hoarse.</p><p>His hand rubs circles on my back. \u201cHow are you feeling?\u201d</p><p>Rubbing my eyes, I rest my chin on his chest. \u201cI\u2019ve felt worse.\u201d</p><p>He nods in understanding.</p><p>\u201cThank you ... for being here, for listening.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m always here for you.\u201d He touches my face. \u201cDo you need to talk some more, now you\u2019re feeling a little clearer?\u201d</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cI feel okay at the moment. I want to keep feeling okay.\u201d I lie my head back on his chest and listen to the gentle drum of his heart.</p><p>My eyes graze over his tattoo, which covers his right pectoral, goes up over his shoulder, and down his arm, ending at his wrist. It\u2019s tribal, with quotes woven through it.</p><p>I run my fingertip down his arm, reading the quotes I\u2019ve seen before, but paying attention now...</p><p>Not all who wander are lost.</p><p>That\u2019s on his bicep.</p><p>\u201cI had this tattoo done in three parts,\u201d he explains. \u201cThat was done while I was traveling. I had it done in Indonesia.\u201d</p><p>My fingers move down to his forearm...</p><p>If you can\u2019t live longer, live deeper.</p><p>\u201cI got that done after my mom died.\u201d</p><p>I give a sad smile, then press my lips to the words, kissing them. I sit up, shifting my body so that I\u2019m straddling his waist. His hands go to my thighs.</p><p>\u201cYou finished checking me out?\u201d He grins.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m checking out your tattoo, and no, I\u2019m not done.\u201d I smile, then lean close to read the words on his chest...</p><p>I don't go looking for trouble.</p><p>Trouble usually finds me.</p><p>I let out a laugh. That is such a Jordan thing to say. But why do I know that saying...</p><p>\u201cHarry Potter.\u201d I jab my finger at the tattoo.</p><p>\u201cOw!\u201d he complains, rubbing his chest.</p><p>\u201cSorry.\u201d I smile sheepishly. \u201cThat\u2019s a quote from Harry Potter, right?\u201d</p><p>He gives me a suspicious look. \u201cYeah, it is. Why?\u201d</p><p>I shrug. \u201cNo reason ... geek,\u201d I cough, covering my mouth with my hand.</p><p>His eyes narrow, then he\u2019s moving like lightening, tackling me back and pinning me to the bed with his body.</p><p>\u201cArrggghh!\u201d I let out a squeal of laughter.</p><p>\u201cDid you just call me a geek?\u201d He hovers his face above mine. His face is serious, but I can see the mirth in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d I press my grinning lips together.</p><p>\u201cNo? I\u2019m pretty sure you did just call me a geek.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNoooo.\u201d I give a gasp of shock. \u201cI mean as if getting a Harry Potter quote tattooed on your chest would, in any way, make me think you\u2019re a geek. I\u2019d say it\u2019s the coolest thing ever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSmart-ass,\u201d he quips. \u201cAnd seriously, babe, Harry Potter is fuckin\u2019 cool. The kid\u2019s a wizard for fuck\u2019s sake!\u201d</p><p>I start laughing. I love seeing this side of him. The one I don\u2019t think anyone else ever sees, the stripped down version of him. The real him. The one he hides away, deep inside.</p><p>He starts laughing with me, then runs his hand down the side of my face, his thumb pressing against my lips, sending fire shooting through me. The laughter is gone quickly, his lips replacing his thumb.</p><p>\u201cI love to see you laughing,\u201d he says against my mouth.</p><p>My hands slide down his back. \u201cI love that you make me laugh.\u201d</p><p>Smiling against my mouth, he gives me one last kiss, then lays his head on my chest.</p><p>I start playing with his hair. He makes a sound of appreciation, so I figure he must like it.</p><p>\u201cI am a geek,\u201d he mutters after a while.</p><p>I stop playing with his hair. \u201cYeah, you are.\u201d I smile. \u201cBut you know what? It makes me like you even more.\u201d</p><p>He squeezes my hip, pressing a kiss against the peak of my breast.</p><p>I start playing with his hair again. \u201cSo ... what now?\u201d I ask the question which has been hovering in my mind since we first had sex.</p><p>I know we\u2019ve had two dates, a freak out from me when things first got heavy between us, and now we\u2019ve had sex followed by an emotional breakdown from me.</p><p>Truthfully, I just don\u2019t know what\u2019s actually happening between us.</p><p>I know what I want, but the problem is, I don\u2019t know what Jordan wants from me.</p><p>His chest lifts on a breath, his hand stroking the skin on my shoulder. \u201cWell, I was thinking that I would leave you in bed, get up and feed Dozer \u2019cause he\u2019ll be wanting his breakfast, and he needs his meds. Then I would make pancakes for my woman, and bring them to her in bed. Afterward, once she\u2019s happily fed, I thought we could spend the rest of the day in bed ... only if she wants to, of course?\u201d</p><p>His woman. I\u2019ll take that as a good thing.</p><p>He lifts his head, resting his chin on my chest. His warm eyes stare at me, filled with feeling, feeling he has for me.</p><p>I lift my head, placing my arms behind for support, and bring my face closer to his. \u201cShe wants,\u201d I murmur.</p><p>His pupils dilate, eyes darkening with lust.</p><p>\u201cActually, Dozer can wait a bit longer to be fed.\u201d His hand moves down my body. Lifting slightly, he puts it between us, slipping his finger inside me.</p><p>\u201cOh, my god,\u201d I breathe. I feel him grow hard against my thigh.</p><p>\u201cBabe, so wet ... already,\u201d he groans.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s you ... what you do to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I plan on doing a whole lot more,\u201d he promises before sealing his mouth over mine.</p><p>After making love to me, Jordan finally relents and goes to feed Dozer.</p><p>I retrieve my panties, and put on one of Jordan\u2019s t-shirts that I nab from his closet. It\u2019s huge on me, nearly reaching my knees.</p><p>I\u2019m wandering around his bedroom, looking at a map of the world he has tacked to the wall. There are pins in it with a drawn line under the pins, marking the route of all the places he has traveled. The last pin is in Thailand, but the drawn line goes onto India, through Nepal, then across China to Hong Kong, up to Shanghai, finally ending in Japan. I\u2019m guessing that\u2019s where he would have gone if his trip hadn\u2019t ended early.</p><p>I look at the photos pinned up around the map, pictures of a slightly younger Jordan in different locations with his friends.</p><p>He looks happy; bright eyed.</p><p>Looking at these pictures, seeing the fun and adventure in his face when he didn\u2019t know what was to come, makes my heart hurt for him.</p><p>Beneath the map is his desk. There are a few framed photos sitting on top of it.</p><p>One is of a dark haired woman, smiling happily into the camera. She must be Jordan\u2019s mom. I pick it up, examining it. She looks quite young in the photo, maybe my age, and she\u2019s really pretty. She has the same eye color as Jordan.</p><p>Putting it down, I pick up the next picture. It\u2019s of a young Jordan, maybe four or five, held in the arms of a man whom I\u2019m guessing is his dad as he looks exactly like Jordan does now. Beside his dad, tucked into his side, is a petite blonde haired lady. She\u2019s really beautiful. Oh right, she must be Jordan\u2019s mother. Maybe the other woman is an aunt or something.</p><p>I\u2019m just putting the picture down, when Jordan comes in with a tray containing pancakes and two cups of coffee.</p><p>Could he be any more perfect? I keep expecting to wake up and find out this is all a dream and I\u2019m still in that motel bed back near Boston.</p><p>He puts the tray down on the desk, and his arms come around my waist from behind, resting his chin on the top of my head. \u201cThat\u2019s my mom and dad.\u201d He points to the picture I was just looking at.</p><p>\u201cYour mom was beautiful, Jordan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, she really was. You remind me of her a bit, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do?\u201d I smile.</p><p>\u201cYeah, she always used to speak without thinking like you do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d I exclaim, giving his side a pinch.</p><p>\u201cHey! Knock it off!\u201d He laughs, wriggling behind me. \u201cI\u2019m really fuckin\u2019 ticklish!\u201d</p><p>I tilt my head back, looking up at him. \u201cHmm ... I didn\u2019t know that.\u201d</p><p>He stares down at me, narrowing his gaze. \u201cYeah, and I didn\u2019t tell you for the very reason that\u2019s going through that gorgeous head of yours right now. So don\u2019t go getting any ideas about tickling me again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs if I would.\u201d I smile sweetly.</p><p>He shakes his head, giving me a quick kiss on the lips.</p><p>I pick up the photo again and examine it. \u201cYou look exactly like your dad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, yeah, he was a handsome fucker when he was younger.\u201d</p><p>Shaking my head, I laugh as I put the picture down.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s this?\u201d I point to the picture of the dark haired woman. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Jordan loosens an arm from around me and picks up the frame. \u201cAbbi ... she\u2019s my real mom.\u201d</p><p>I turn, surprised.</p><p>He meets my eyes. \u201cShe died giving birth to me. She had an undiagnosed heart condition, and her heart gave out during delivery. She died soon after I was born.\u201d</p><p>My eyes fill with tears.</p> <p>God, he\u2019s known so much loss. He\u2019s lost two mothers.</p><p>I reach up and touch his face. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry.\u201d</p><p>He puts her picture down. \u201cIt\u2019s okay. I never knew her. It makes it hard to hurt over her loss if you know what I mean. But my dad has told me everything about her growing up, and I have photographs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, the woman you call mom...?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBelle. She was my dad\u2019s childhood sweetheart. They broke up when she left to go to college. That was when he met Abbi, and they had me. After Abbi died, dad was raising me alone, with the help of my grandpa as dad was already in the force at this point. Then Belle moved back home when I was about three or four. They ended up getting back together, and she raised me as her own.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThey never wanted any kids together?\u201d I ask.</p><p>A strange look crosses his face, like he\u2019s never considered it before. His lip pushes out. \u201cNah, I guess not. They already had perfection in me, so what more could they want?\u201d</p><p>I roll my eyes and laugh. \u201cRight.\u201d</p><p>Chuckling, he moves from behind me and gives my butt a pat. \u201cCome on, let\u2019s eat before my hard work goes cold.\u201d</p><p>We sit down at the desk. Jordan gives me the chair and pulls over a stool for him to sit on. I tuck my legs underneath me. It\u2019s a subconscious move on my part. Still covering up my scars, even though he knows they\u2019re there and exactly how I got them.</p><p>Telling Jordan all about Oliver was like opening the door on a dark room and letting the light flood in.</p> <p>It doesn\u2019t fix things or change my memories, but knowing I have him to talk to makes it easier.</p><p>Picking up a pancake, I tear a piece off and put it in my mouth. I see Jordan\u2019s eyes making work of me, especially the partial leg he can see. He looks like he\u2019s remembering what we did half an hour ago. I give him a look.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d he says, eyes wide with innocence. \u201cIt\u2019s not my fault you look hot in my t-shirt. And you have great fuckin\u2019 legs.\u201d</p><p>A flush shimmers through my body. I can feel myself growing needy for his touch again.</p><p>I wonder if I\u2019ll always feel like this about him.</p><p>I take another bite of pancake. Swallowing, I get an unexpected pain in my stomach. I grip my hand to my stomach. I know where this is from. I went a little rough on myself yesterday, and this is the first time I\u2019m eating since.</p><p>Jordan notices. \u201cHey, you okay?\u201d His brow furrows with concern.</p><p>\u201cYeah, fine.\u201d I\u2019m a little breathless as I ride out the pain. I put the pancake down. \u201cJust women\u2019s things.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDo I need to make the most of you while I can?\u201d</p><p>I grin, the pain subsiding. \u201cWe\u2019re good for a few more days, so feel free to take advantage whenever the mood takes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I intend to.\u201d He puts his pancake down and pats his lap.</p><p>\u201cNow?\u201d I bite my lip.</p><p>\u201cHmm.\u201d He nods, that sexual shimmer in his eyes that he gets. The one that tells me he\u2019s about to make my body feel amazing.</p><p>Getting off my chair, I straddle him, resting my arms on his shoulders and linking my hands behind his head. I can feel him already hard against me. \u201cYou\u2019re insatiable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly for you, babe.\u201d His hands go to my behind and his fingers trace a gentle line over my scars.</p><p>My body tenses, my muscles locking.</p><p>\u201cRelax,\u201d he soothes. \u201cIt\u2019s just me.\u201d</p><p>I nod my head, and try to relax.</p><p>Standing with me, he carries me to the bed, laying me down.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re beautiful.\u201d He drops a kiss to the base of my neck. \u201cEvery single part of you.\u201d He moves down my body, laying on the bed beside me, and turns me to my side, facing me away from him. \u201cNothing about you is ruined...\u201d His hand gently moves over my behind, down to my thigh. \u201cOr broken, or marred...\u201d He moves down, placing a kiss on my behind. \u201cJust gorgeous, babe.\u201d</p><p>Jordan moves up my body, curling his around mine with his chest to my back, hugging me to him.</p><p>\u201cBut nothing on the outside compares to what\u2019s in here.\u201d His voice comes in my ear, as his hand slips under the t-shirt. He presses his large hand between my breasts, covering my heart. \u201cThis is what I\u2019m crazy about, what\u2019s in here.\u201d</p><p>My heart feels replete with him, ready to burst. Needing to be closer to him, I turn in his arms and bury my face in his neck, breathing him in.</p><p>I\u2019ve never met anyone like Jordan. He\u2019s a miracle to me. My miracle.</p><p>He\u2019s like breathing fresh air for the very first time.</p><p>I realize that I didn\u2019t start breathing until him.</p><p>I didn\u2019t start living until him.</p><p>\u201cI breathe you, Jordan,\u201d I whisper against his skin.</p><p>He tilts his head back, eyes staring down into mine. \u201cI breathe you too, babe.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Nineteen</p><p>Jordan</p><p>Running back inside to answer the phone, I grab the receiver off the wall. \u201cGolden Oaks,\u201d I answer.</p><p>\u201cHey son, just checking in, seeing how you\u2019re doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey Dad. All good here.\u201d I hop up on the kitchen counter.</p><p>I can see Mia through the window with Dozer. She\u2019s feeding him meat treats. Poor fucking dog is going out of his mind with that cast on, so we\u2019ve been spending time with him.</p><p>In-between making out that is.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s things?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSame.\u201d I shrug, grabbing a nut out of the bag I opened earlier, I toss it my mouth.</p><p>\u201cNo other guests than our current one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d I crunch. \u201cThe Perry\u2019s are due later on today, though.\u201d I lift my voice in optimism, hoping to pass some onto him.</p><p>\u201cChrist, is it that time of year already?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. I got their room all ready for them, so we\u2019re good to go.\u201d</p><p>Mia insisted on helping me prepare the room. It took a little longer than it usually takes me as we ended up having some fun which began with Mia getting down on her knees and taking my cock in her mouth, and ended with her legs wrapped around my waist, back pressed against the wall while I fucked her to orgasm.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a good son,\u201d Dad says.</p><p>I shake my head.</p><p>No, Dad, I\u2019m not, but I\u2019m trying my hardest to be. And with Mia by my side, I think I can do it.</p><p>He lets out a sigh. \u201cSo we\u2019ve definitely got no other bookings?\u201d He checks this again as if I\u2019m going to suddenly magic some up.</p><p>\u201cNo ... I\u2019m sorry, Dad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not your fault. Business will pick up soon, I\u2019m sure of it.\u201d</p><p>Always the optimist, my dad, but I hope for both our sakes that business does pick up.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s Dozer doing?\u201d he asks. \u201cHis leg healing okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, it\u2019s healing fine, but he\u2019s bored shitless not being able to go out for a run, so Mia\u2019s currently keeping him entertained.\u201d I look out the window at them again. Mia\u2019s laying on the grass with Dozer standing over her, pinning her while he licks her face. She\u2019s laughing, trying to push him off. The sight of them has me smiling.</p><p>\u201cMia \u2013 as in our hotel guest Mia \u2013 is keeping your dog entertained?\u201d Dad says, wiping the smile from my face.</p><p>Shit. I shouldn\u2019t have said that. He\u2019s going to know something is going on between Mia and me now, but then he would have as soon as he got back home. I\u2019m serious about her, so telling him now isn\u2019t going to hurt anything I guess.</p><p>\u201cYes, Mia as in our hotel guest\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs there anything I need to know?\u201d he cuts me off before I get a chance to tell him about Mia and me. The \u2018dad\u2019 tone in his voice irritates me, so the immature side of me decides to play it out to annoy him.</p><p>\u201cLike what?\u201d I say with a casualness to my voice</p><p>\u201cLike are you having sex with this girl?\u201d</p><p>Okay. Straight to the point.</p><p>\u201cYeah...\u201d I exhale. \u201cI\u2019m sleeping with her ... but before you start kicking off, I want you to know this is different. She\u2019s different.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s silent a moment. \u201cYou\u2019ve never told me that a girl is different before. Should I take this as a good sign?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d I smile. \u201cYou should.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you really like this girl, huh?\u201d</p><p>Like, is the understatement of the century, but I\u2019m not about to tell my dad that I\u2019ve fallen in love with Mia.</p><p>Yeah, you heard me. I fucking love her.</p><p>I\u2019ve never had feelings for a girl before, but the first time I do, I\u2019m falling in love, and hard. I guess this is what happens to us men who don\u2019t love easily. We love quicker and harder.</p><p>Now, I just need to find the nerve to tell Mia that, after just a little over a week of knowing her, I\u2019m crazy in love with her. I\u2019m hoping that when I do, I won\u2019t sending her running for the hills. She can be skittish at times.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I really like her, Dad,\u201d I reply, running a hand through my hair. \u201cI didn\u2019t intend to start anything with Mia. I meant what I said to you that time on the phone ... but we just got close.\u201d I smile at the thought of how good it feels to be close to her.</p><p>\u201cShe came here looking for her mother, and after she helped me with Dozer when he had his accident, I said I would help her try to find her mom, and we just ended up spending more and more time together. I got to know her really well, and she\u2019s pretty fuckin\u2019 amazing, Dad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds like you got it bad, boy.\u201d He chuckles. \u201cI\u2019m looking forward to meeting this girl who\u2019s managed to turn my horndog sons\u2019 head.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHa! Nice, Dad, real nice.\u201d I laugh. \u201cYou\u2019ll like her though. She\u2019s smart, and real beautiful. She reminds me a bit of mom \u2013 tiny, blonde, has the tendency to speak without thinking. Actually, that reminds me. I\u2019ve being meaning to ask you, have you ever heard of a woman called Anna Monroe who lived round here?\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s a fairly biggish town that we live in, so chances are he might not have, but in his old line of work, he tended to know everyone.</p><p>I get no reply.</p><p>\u201cDad? You still there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. I\u2019m here.\u201d He\u2019s a little short, and his voice sounds different ... gruff, strained.</p><p>\u201cDid you hear what I said? I asked you if you\u2019d heard of a woman called Anna Monroe.\u201d I\u2019m pushing now because I know there\u2019s something there. He knows something about Mia\u2019s mom.</p><p>\u201cJesus Christ...\u201d He sighs. \u201cJordan, I need you to do something for me. Do you have a photo of Mia that you can send to my cell?\u201d</p><p>A hand comes around my throat. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust do it!\u201d he snaps.</p><p>My dad never raises his voice at me \u2013 never. Not even when I screwed up with the gambling did he once raise his voice at me. It\u2019s just the type of dad he is \u2013 a reasoner, not a yeller. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cJesus!

I just don\u2019t know where to start.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeginning works good for me.\u201d I\u2019m getting slightly pissed off, and my heart is beating like a bastard.</p><p>\u201cLook, this isn\u2019t technically my story to tell, so go easy on me, son.\u201d</p> <p>I sigh with impatience.</p><p>I hear the phone rustle, like he\u2019s moving, then he starts talking, \u201cYou know that Belle lived away from Durango.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, she went to college. It was why you guys broke up after high school. Then she moved back home, and you got back together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. Well the story in the middle is a little different than the one you know. And Jordan, listen, I only found out the extent of your mom\u2019s time in Boston days before she died...\u201d</p><p>Boston.</p><p>Oh no.</p><p>Motherfucking, no.</p><p>Annabelle \u2013 that\u2019s my mom\u2019s full name. I\u2019ve always known her as Belle, but her name is Annabelle.</p> <p>Anna.</p><p>Why didn\u2019t it click before now? I\u2019m so fucking stupid!</p><p>Belle is Anna.</p><p>She\u2019s Mia\u2019s mother. I know it in my gut.</p><p>\u201cBelle is Mia\u2019s mother.\u201d I nearly choke on the words.</p><p>Dad sighs a weary sound. And it\u2019s confirmed.</p><p>My heart feels like it\u2019s just been ripped from my chest.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019m afraid she is.\u201d</p><p>My mom. The woman who raised me ... is Mia\u2019s mother.</p><p>The mother who abandoned her when she was a baby. Left her alone with that shithole of a father, is the woman who took me on as her own and raised me.</p><p>This is a wrecking ball. And it\u2019s going to destroy everything in its path.</p><p>Mia ... us.</p><p>My head drops in my hands. \u201cFuck. Fuck. Fuck!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, son. She told me days before she died about Mia. I didn\u2019t know. I promise you. All I knew was that while she was in her last year of college, she met this doctor. He swept her off her feet, they got married soon after, but he wasn\u2019t the guy she thought he was. The instant they were married, he turned violent. He hurt her bad. She ended up in hospital a few times because of him. Eventually, she left. Came back here. Divorced him. She never told me that she\u2019d had a baby with him.\u201d</p><p>I feel ill.</p><p>I slide off the counter. My feet hit the tiles and feel unsteady, so I sit on the floor.</p><p>Knees bent up, I put my head between them and take deep breaths.</p><p>\u201cWhen Belle knew she was dying,\u201d Dad continues. \u201cShe told me everything \u2013 all about Mia. She said that looking back, she thinks she was suffering with post-partum depression. And she was afraid, Jordan. Her ex-husband was a bastard of a man. The scars he left her with...\u201d</p><p>I wince at his words, an image of Mia\u2019s scars flashing through my mind.</p><p>\u201cWhen I saw them the first time ... I wanted to go there and kill him, but Belle wouldn\u2019t let me. Obviously, she didn\u2019t want me to go because she didn\u2019t want me to know about Mia.\u201d He sighs.</p><p>\u201cWhy did she leave her there, Dad? I don\u2019t understand?\u201d My voice cracks on the words knowing the life Mia had with her father.</p><p>Then I envision a different past for her.</p><p>One where Belle brought Mia back here with her. She would have been my sister. I would never have loved her in the way I do now, but rather that, then her have the life she had.</p><p>Her life with us would have been good. She\u2019d have grown up happy. She would have had the life she deserved.</p><p>Not one filled with cruelty, and pain. Unimaginable pain.</p><p>I feel a sick, resentful anger toward the woman who raised me. The woman who patched up my busted knees when I fell off my bike time and time again. The woman who fed me. Bathed me. Loved me.</p><p>Jesus. Christ.</p><p>I get up from the floor and start pacing.</p><p>\u201cBelle\u2019s ex-husband was a rich, powerful man, Jordan. He was a doctor \u2013 a heart surgeon. People respected him. He wouldn\u2019t let her take Mia. Told her if she tried that he\u2019d have her arrested for kidnapping.\u201d</p><p>Yanking out a chair at the table, I sit down. \u201cBut she could have called the cops \u2013 told them what was happening to her. She had the evidence \u2013 the scars, her being in hospital because of his beatings.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right she could have. But you know how these things go. She\u2019d have to prove it, and she was up against a man from a wealthy family who ran in high circles. His dad was a good friend of the chief of police. Power and money can make things go away, son. But for all he did to Belle, she knew he wouldn\u2019t hurt his own child which was how she was able to leave Mia with him.\u201d</p><p>I bang my fist on the table, hard. \u201cAre you fuckin\u2019 kidding me! I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m hearing this shit! He wouldn\u2019t hurt her \u2013 Dad, I\u2019ve seen her scars.\u201d I\u2019ve felt her pain. \u201cHe beat her until the day he died. He made her life a fuckin\u2019 misery! And because of him, violence was all she knew, so she ended up in a relationship with an asshole exactly like the one who raised her! Why do you think she left Boston, Dad? The bastard she was with \u2013 he beat her \u2013 tried to rape her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d His voice is filled with shock and disbelief. He sounds exactly like I felt in the moment when she told me.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he repeats. \u201cI found her \u2013 Mia. That was one of the reasons Belle told me about her. She wanted to know Mia, make her peace before she died, but by the time I found Mia, it was too late and Belle had passed.</p><p>\u201cBut I still went to Boston. You remember when I told you I had that police conference? I went then. I watched her for a few days, not in a creepy way, I just couldn\u2019t decide whether to tell her about Belle or not. In the end, I decided against it \u2013 I didn\u2019t think it was worth hurting Mia by telling her that the mother who had abandoned her as a baby had just died. But I wanted to know she was okay \u2013 happy. She seemed it. She was in school, had an application for Harvard. Lived in a great place and drove a nice car. And I saw her with him \u2013 her father, Oliver. They seemed to get along well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well Mia can wear a great mask, Dad. She\u2019s a fuckin\u2019 specialist at pretending to be something she isn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJordan, if I\u2019d have known, I would have done something. You know that.\u201d</p><p>I exhale, heavily. \u201cYeah, I know. I just ... god, I don\u2019t know what to do \u2013 how to tell her.\u201d</p><p>How am I going to tell the girl I\u2019m in love with that her mother \u2013 who left her to be raised by that monster of a man \u2013 raised me instead of her?</p><p>She\u2019ll blame me. I\u2019m going to lose her.</p><p>I feel physically sick at the thought.</p><p>\u201cJust tell her the truth. Exactly as I\u2019ve told you.\u201d</p><p>I scrub my hand over my face. \u201cShe won\u2019t be able to get past this. She\u2019s going to blame me. I\u2019m going to lose her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you won\u2019t,\u201d he states vehemently.</p><p>\u201cBelle left her with him and chose to raise me instead. I know if it were me, it would kill me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJordan, this isn\u2019t your fault. I\u2019ll come home. I\u2019ll explain it to her\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I pull in a deep breath. \u201cShe needs to hear this from me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sure?\u201d</p><p>No. \u201cYes. I\u2019ll tell her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. You know Mia best. Call me when you\u2019ve talked to her. Let me know how she\u2019s doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJordan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s going to be fine, son. I promise.\u201d</p><p>I swallow past the burning in my throat, wishing I could be as confident as he is.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll call you later.\u201d I hang up the phone, dropping it to the table with a clatter, I let my head follow.</p><p>A minute later I hear the backdoor open.</p><p>\u201cHey, you okay?\u201d Mia\u2019s soft sweet voice carries through the room, hitting me with a pure agony.</p><p>I lift my head, turning to her. The warm smile on her face instantly disappears, turning to worry at my expression.</p><p>\u201cJordan \u2013 is everything okay?\u201d She moves quickly toward me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2013\u201d The words stick in my throat, and start to sink fast ... fast like rocks in water.</p><p>\u201cJordan?\u201d</p><p>Oh god. I can\u2019t tell her.</p><p>I can\u2019t.</p><p>I get to my feet and take her beautiful face in my hands, forcing a smile onto my deceitful mouth.</p><p>\u201cEverything\u2019s fine, babe.\u201d</p><p>Then I press my lying lips to her soft, warm, honest mouth, hating my weak, cowardly-self more and more, with each passing second.</p><p>Chapter Twenty</p><p>Mia</p><p>There\u2019s something eating at Jordan. He thinks I don\u2019t know, but I can see it in his eyes, and in the way his expression drops every time he thinks I\u2019m not looking.</p><p>He\u2019s been acting strange after the telephone call he took from his dad the other day.</p><p>At first I thought maybe they\u2019d had a disagreement, but now I know it\u2019s something more. And the paranoid, sadistic part of me is starting to think it\u2019s something to do with me \u2013 that maybe, he\u2019s changed his mind about us.</p><p>A part of me wishes he would just tell me so I would know either way.</p><p>I could ask him, but then I\u2019m afraid what his answer will be. So like the masochist I am, I\u2019m taking whatever he throws my way. Granted, he\u2019s throwing a lot my way, but there\u2019s still something off. I just wish I had more strength than I do. I wish I could just up and leave, and stop being so damn pathetic over a man, who I\u2019m pretty sure doesn\u2019t want me anymore.</p><p>And the worst thing is, I\u2019ve realized I\u2019m in love with him.</p><p>I know, right?</p><p>You think I would have learned my lesson by now.</p><p>And it\u2019s not as if I can tell him how I feel, or that there\u2019s any point. Not while he\u2019s working himself away from me.</p><p>I just wish he didn\u2019t know so much about me. It makes me feel vulnerable to him.</p><p>I know what I need to do \u2013 pack my things and move out of here, stay somewhere else. It just feels a little easier said than done at the moment.</p><p>I also need to grow a backbone and pay a visit to the last Anna Monroe on my list. It just feels a million times harder now I don\u2019t have Jordan there to hold my hand. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I guess he really is what he told me he was in the beginning \u2013 unable to commit to a girl. And no matter how much wishing on my part for me to have been the one to change him \u2013 the signs are telling me otherwise.</p><p>Yes, he says he wants me. But each time he\u2019s said that, he\u2019s either been inside me, or well on his way to it. And I know better than anyone that a man will say things he doesn\u2019t mean while he\u2019s having sex with you.</p><p>Last night was no different. I\u2019d woken up in the early hours of the morning to find Jordan gone from his bed, and in the space beside me, where he\u2019d fallen asleep, was a sleeping Dozer, stretched out and snoring.</p><p>In the end, my curiosity and frustration won out. I\u2019d searched the hotel to no success, then eventually found him sitting out on the boardwalk over the lake, drinking a beer...</p> <p>I walked over and stood between his open legs, staring down at him. Jordan\u2019s hands went around the back of my thighs, fingers gripping. His head rested against them, like it was hard for him to look at me.</p><p>I slid my fingers into his hair, silently begging him to talk to me ... but wishing for only things I\u2019d want to hear.</p><p>His hand slid up my leg and took hold of my hand. He tugged me down to sit between his legs. I rested my back against his chest, and he wrapped his arm around my middle while taking a drink of his beer.</p><p>\u201cWhat you doing out here so late?\u201d I asked, my words drifting out over the lake, disappearing into the night.</p><p>He nuzzled my neck, inhaling. \u201cCouldn\u2019t sleep.\u201d</p> <p>I took the beer from his hand, had a swig, then handed it back.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s keeping you awake?\u201d</p><p>He placed the bottle down beside him and let out a long breath. \u201cNothin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>Nothing!</p><p>Angry, tired, and completely pissed off with his lack of communication, I got to my feet.</p><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t want me anymore, Jordan \u2013 this whatever we have \u2013 then just say so! Just ... please, stop ... this!\u201d</p> <p>I swiveled on my heel and ran back to the hotel.</p><p>He caught up with me on the porch by the main door.</p><p>His hand closed the door I was opening. He came up behind me, pressing his chest to my back.</p><p>\u201cI want you,\u201d he said, rough, against my ear. \u201cDon\u2019t ever think for one fuckin\u2019 second that I don\u2019t. I want you more than I have ever wanted anyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, why all this?\u201d I was breathing heavy, feeling confused, my heart thundering in my chest.</p><p>\u201cAll of what?\u201d</p><p>I turned, curling my hands around the door handle as I leaned back against it. \u201cYou, being different ... distant with me ... I know there\u2019s something you\u2019re keeping from me.\u201d</p><p>His eyes closed as if he were in pain. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing for you to worry about.\u201d</p> <p>I reached for his hand, curling my fingers around his. \u201cI just want you to talk to me.\u201d I tugged on his hand, trying to encourage speech.</p><p>His eyes opened, staring down at our entwined hands.</p><p>A long breath. \u201cI will...\u201d He shook his head. \u201cBut not right now ... not now.\u201d It felt like he wasn\u2019t even talking to me by this point.</p><p>Then his hands went to the door, either side of my head, and his lips came down hard on mine, no hesitation.</p><p>I wanted to push him away, tell him to talk to me now, not later. That kissing me wouldn\u2019t solve whatever was eating at him.</p><p>But I didn\u2019t. Because I didn\u2019t want him to stop kissing me \u2013 ever.</p><p>He broke the kiss to pull my pajama tank over my head. Bending his mouth down, he took my nipple into his mouth.</p><p>My head fell back against the door with a thud.</p><p>I reached for him, unbuttoning his jeans. I slid my hand inside his boxer shorts, grabbing his hot, hard cock.</p><p>\u201cFuck, Mia,\u201d he groaned, pushing himself into my hand.</p><p>Then things got heated and urgent and fast.</p><p>My pajama bottoms and panties were off, and before I knew it, I stood naked on the hotel porch, and Jordan \u2013 still fully clothed, was lifting me off my feet and slamming his cock inside me.</p><p>I cried out from the quick invasion and the instant pleasure. Wrapping my legs around his waist, I dug my fingernails hard into his shoulders.</p><p>This only set him off further.</p><p>He was hitting me with sure, hard thrusts, his jeans chaffing painfully against me, but I didn\u2019t care. All I cared about was having him inside me. Nothing else mattered at that point.</p><p>We were outside, having crazy, furious, make-up sex in the early hours of the morning ... all those things fueling it a hundred times hotter ... a thousand times more intense.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re mine, Mia,\u201d he ground out as his hips pinned mine to the door, making love to me with a fierce intensity. \u201cI\u2019m never losing you. Never.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not going to lose me,\u201d I panted out, confused and turned on like never before. \u201cNot ever.\u201d</p><p>That was a handful of hours ago. And now I\u2019ve woken again to find myself alone in Jordan\u2019s bed.</p><p>I let out a sigh, swing my legs over the edge of the bed, and pay a visit to the bathroom.</p><p>I put the clothes I was wearing last night back on as I hadn\u2019t brought any clean ones from my room. Not even ready to talk to Jordan at the moment, I decide to go back to my room so I can shower, brush my teeth, and change into clean clothes. I grab my room key from his desk and head through the house of the hotel.</p><p>When my foot is on the first step to take me upstairs to the hotel, I hear two male voices. One is Jordan. The other I don\u2019t recognize. They\u2019re upstairs in the office.</p><p>I debate what to do.</p><p>I don\u2019t want to go barging into the office if he\u2019s talking with someone important. I\u2019ll just go out through the back door, and walk around the hotel and come in through the lobby to get to my room.</p><p>I turn on the step, but stop when I hear my name spoken. It\u2019s not Jordan who says my name. It\u2019s the other man.</p><p>Curiosity getting the better of me, I walk up the stairs quietly, the voices becoming clearer.</p><p>\u201c... can\u2019t believe this, Jordan.\u201d</p><p>I hear him sigh. \u201cI know, Dad. I\u2019ve fucked up.\u201d</p><p>His dad\u2019s home? I smile at the thought of meeting his dad, but when Jordan continues talking, his words wipe the smile off my face.</p><p>\u201cI was going to tell her, but ... I just couldn\u2019t bring myself to do it. I couldn\u2019t find the words to start with.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe truth, Jordan. You start with the truth. I knew I should have come home the day I told you. It\u2019s why I\u2019ve come home today because you\u2019ve been avoiding my calls. I knew there was something up.\u201d A sigh. \u201cI thought maybe you and Mia, had argued about it ... I just didn\u2019t want to believe you hadn\u2019t told her because it\u2019s not how I raised you. I know you really care about Mia, but you can\u2019t just carry on with her, all the while keeping the truth from her. It\u2019s not right. How do you think she\u2019s going to feel when she finds out that you\u2019ve known the truth about her mother for days and not told her?\u201d</p><p>My heart stops dead in my chest, my stomach clenching in painful, sick inducing knots. I curl my fingers into my hand, digging my nails into the soft skin.</p><p>\u201cShit...\u201d Jordan says, sounding like he\u2019s in pain. \u201cI\u2019ve fucked up badly. I thought she wouldn\u2019t forgive me before ... she\u2019ll never forgive me now. She knew \u2013 she knew something was up, and I just kept telling her everything was okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want me to be with you when you tell her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Jordan sighs. \u201cI\u2019ll tell her alone. I don\u2019t want to bulldoze her with the two of us. I\u2019ll go speak to her now.\u201d The determination in his voice, and his heavy footsteps across the floor, have me turning to run back down the stairs.</p><p>I know I have no chance of making it, but still I try.</p><p>I hear the door open and Jordan say, \u201cMia,\u201d in a tone that can only be described as fearful. I have no choice but to turn around.</p><p>The fear in his voice matches the fear on his face, but it\u2019s the look in his eyes that\u2019s the worst. He looks hopeless. Like he\u2019s about to lose everything. Or maybe it\u2019s me that\u2019s about to lose everything.</p><p>And the sick I was feeling worsens.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-One</p><p>Jordan</p><p>When I was fourteen years old, Maisy Richards kicked me in the nuts at Ben Castle\u2019s birthday party because she\u2019d given me a handjob in the hall closet, then caught me making out with Sophie Jenkins an hour later.</p><p>It literally feels like your testicles have exploded and the flying debris is obliterating your insides like a dirty bomb, leaving you feeling pain of the unimaginable kind.</p><p>Up until exactly thirty seconds ago, I\u2019d believed that was the most painful thing I would ever feel.</p><p>I was wrong.</p><p>Because standing here, seeing the crumpled look of devastation on Mia\u2019s face after telling her that her mother\u2014the mother who left her behind to be raised by a father who repeatedly beat her\u2014is, in fact, the woman who raised me.</p><p>\u201cI-I don\u2019t understand...\u201d She stumbles back, her knee making contact with the office desk with a sickening thud.</p><p>I reach for her, but she doesn\u2019t even seem to have registered the pain, which only aids to show me how bad this is.</p><p>How badly I\u2019ve screwed up.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry.\u201d I shake my head, disconsolate.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s ... my ... your mom ... dead.\u201d Her hand grips her stomach as if she\u2019s in actual pain.</p><p>\u201cMia...\u201d I step toward her, needing to be close to her.</p><p>Her hand goes up, stopping me.</p><p>\u201cMia,\u201d my dad says in his gentle \u2018cop\u2019 voice. \u201cYou should sit down. It\u2019s a terrible shock you\u2019ve had ... sit. Let me get you a glass of water.\u201d</p><p>She looks at my dad with a confused look on her face. Then her eyes slice back to me, and the way she looks at me ... through me. Her eyes are ice-cold. The pain slides through me as easily as a hot knife in butter.</p><p>Then her eyes drift across the room to the wall, and I know what she\u2019s looking at without me even needing to turn.</p><p>She\u2019s looking at the framed photo of me, Dad and Mom. It was the last picture we had taken together before she died. The day I was leaving to go traveling.</p><p>Her face crumbles, and tears fall from her eyes.</p><p>She covers her face with her hands. I hear a sob emit from her, so painful it shatters my heart, leaving nothing but dust in its place.</p><p>I can\u2019t stay away.</p><p>I cross the room in quick strides, and wrap my arms around her.</p><p>It\u2019s only a second before she\u2019s pushing me off with a strength I didn\u2019t know she had.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t touch me ... don\u2019t ever touch me again.\u201d She dries her face on her sleeve, turns and runs out the office.</p><p>I look at my dad for guidance because I literally don\u2019t know what the hell to do.</p><p>\u201cGo after her,\u201d he urges.</p><p>I\u2019m out of the door a second later.</p><p>I catch sight of Mia disappearing into her room. I run down the hall, expecting her door to be closed, but it\u2019s not. It\u2019s wide open.</p><p>I don\u2019t go in the room out of respect for her space. So I stand in the doorway, gripping the frame to keep myself from going to her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She\u2019s pushing her feet into her sneakers and grabbing her purse.</p><p>\u201cMia?\u201d</p><p>She ignores me, pulling her jacket on.</p><p>\u201cMia, please. Talk to me.\u201d</p> <p>She grabs her car keys, swings her purse over her shoulder, and without a word she pushes past me and walks quickly down the hall.</p><p>I\u2019m at her heel, following, trying to talk to her.</p><p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t go ... just wait ... I know how hard this must be for you ... how much you\u2019re hurting right now ... but if you\u2019ll just let me explain...\u201d</p><p>She stops outside on the porch\u2014the porch where I made love to her only a few hours ago, when I lied to her again\u2014and slowly turns around.</p><p>The cold in her eyes, and the dead look on her face, tell me what I already fear.</p> <p>I\u2019ve lost her.</p><p>There is no getting past this.</p><p>I lied to her.

You\u2019ve had DAYS TO EXPLAIN!\u201d she yells. \u201cDAYS TO TELL ME THE TRUTH, BUT YOU LIED ... you lied.\u201d Her voice drops to a whisper. \u201cShe loved you ... not me \u2013 you. She left me with him. God, she must have hated me...\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Mia. No. You need to hear everything, you need to let me explain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI DON\u2019T WANT TO HEAR ANYTHING MORE!\u201d she screams. Tears are streaming down her face, and her hand is clutching her stomach again.</p> <p>My eyes are stinging from her pain. I rub them roughly with my hand.</p><p>\u201cI have to go,\u201d she says in an eerily small voice, her eyes sweeping to her car. \u201cI have to get out of here.\u201d</p><p>A fist of absolute agony twists in my chest.</p><p>She runs for her car, unlocking it on her approach. I scramble after her, grabbing her arm, trying to keep her with me.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t go,\u201d I plead. \u201cNot like this. Please, Mia. Just stay, talk to me. I can fix this. I will fix this.\u201d</p><p>Her empty eyes lift to mine. \u201cThis isn\u2019t fixable ... I\u2019m not fixable. I was broken a long time ago beyond repair.\u201d</p><p>She yanks her arm from my hand, climbs in her car, and drives away, leaving me in a cloud of dust and agony.</p><p>I don\u2019t realize I\u2019m sitting on the gravel until I feel Dad\u2019s hand on my shoulder.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry, Jordan. I\u2019m sorry that you\u2019re paying for the mistakes Belle made a long time ago.\u201d</p><p>I scrub my face with my hands, then get to my feet.</p><p>\u201cNo ... I just ... I can\u2019t lose her. I have to make this right. I\u2019m gonna go after her\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He places a firm hand on my shoulder, holding me in place. \u201cThat\u2019s not a good idea. If you go after her now, it could only make things worse. Give her time to cool down, process her hurt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut what if she doesn\u2019t come back?\u201d The pain in my chest twists to pure fucking agony. I rub at the ache, feeling breathless.</p><p>\u201cHer things are here, Jordan. She has to come back for them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I shake my head, knowing how she left everything she owned behind in Boston when she ran. \u201cMaterial things don\u2019t matter to her. She left everything behind in Boston, so a few clothes left behind won\u2019t make her come back here.\u201d</p><p>A look of concern twists his expression for a moment. Then he pats my shoulder. \u201cShe cares about you, a lot. She\u2019ll come back. If she doesn\u2019t, then we\u2019ll find her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d</p><p>He puts his arm around my shoulders, and starts to steer me back inside. \u201cHave you forgotten that your old man used to be a cop? Finding people is what I\u2019m good at.\u201d He smiles, trying to be helpful, positive, encouraging.</p><p>I nod, not really feeling it because my fear isn\u2019t not finding her. I\u2019ll track the earth until the day I do.</p><p>No, my fear is what will be waiting for me when I do see her again.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-Two</p><p>Mia</p><p>There\u2019s nothing.</p><p>No thoughts in my mind.</p><p>No pain in my body.</p><p>No ache in my heart.</p><p>Just one focus. One aim.</p><p>I slam on the brakes in the grocery store parking lot.</p><p>Sliding my sunglasses on, I grab my purse and head inside.</p><p>I get a cart. Then I hit the aisles.</p><p>There\u2019s no conscious thought. Just need. Only need.</p><p>My cart is filling quickly. I\u2019m eating already. A bag of chips already torn open and gone. A pack of candy half-eaten.</p><p>If people are staring, I don\u2019t care to see.</p><p>The cashier attempts small talk. I don\u2019t reply.</p><p>I bag my food, pay and leave.</p><p>Then I drive my car to the motel at the edge of town, the one I came to the other day.</p><p>Most people come to motels during the day to have affairs. I come to eat. To hide my shame.</p><p>Yet, in this moment it doesn\u2019t feel so shameful anymore.</p><p>Just necessary.</p><p>A means to an end ... an end I can\u2019t currently see.</p><p>I check in at the desk. One night. I don\u2019t need any more than that.</p><p>I just need to get this out of my system. Then I\u2019m leaving town.</p><p>Once I have the key to my room, I go back to my car and get my bags of food.</p><p>I let myself in the room and dump the bags on the bed.</p><p>It\u2019s not the room I was in the other day, but it looks exactly the same.</p><p>The same cheap, dirty, stale overused room. It feels right to be here.</p><p>That\u2019s what I am. Cheap, stale and overused.</p><p>I foolishly let myself think otherwise. Let myself think I was worth something ... that I meant something to someone ... him.</p><p>Jordan.</p><p>It hurts to think his name.</p><p>I bang my hands against my forehead, forcing him out, but he won\u2019t go.</p><p>So I go over to the age old television and turn it on. I want to drown out the pain in my head with meaningless, but the knowledge still creeps in and cripples me.</p><p>Music from the television flows into the room, filling every empty corner with Rihanna\u2019s \u201cDiamonds\u201d.</p><p>Pain lances through me. I catch a sob with a fist to my mouth as I sink to the floor.</p><p>How could he...? How could she...?</p><p>Stop, Mia. Stop now.</p><p>You know how to take the pain away.</p><p>I crawl over to the bed and rip open the first thing I lay my hand on.</p><p>Shoving it in my mouth, I chew quickly, swallowing. There\u2019s no taste. Just relief. The relief that always comes with this.</p><p>I drag a bag down from the bed, emptying its contents to the floor.</p><p>I tear open another packet \u2013 cookies. I shove them in my mouth, chewing, trying to eat as many as I can as quickly as possible.</p><p>But the food is sticking, like my body is ready to reject already.</p><p>I swallow hard, forcing it down, and grab the bottle of soda I bought, downing some, lubricating my dry throat.</p><p>Then I start in, eating harder than I ever have before.</p><p>I\u2019m laying on the dirty floor of the room, staring up at the cracked ceiling. Nearly all the food is gone, my body is drenched in sweat, and my stomach hurts like I\u2019ve never known before.</p><p>I\u2019ve eaten more than I ever have before.</p><p>But the feeling is soothing because it\u2019s better to feel the painful ache of the food in my stomach, than to feel the crippling agony threatening to shred my heart to pieces.</p><p>My mother abandoned me to raise him.</p><p>Jordan.</p><p>The man I\u2019m in love with.</p><p>I\u2019m truly that worthless.</p><p>I struggle to my feet. I\u2019m going to be sick. But I hold it back.</p><p>I need the relief of doing this to myself.</p><p>Struggling my way to the bathroom, I kneel at the toilet. Fingers pressed together, I push back in my throat, and rid myself of the pain trying to consume me.</p><p>It\u2019s still here. It didn\u2019t work.</p><p>No.</p><p>They\u2019ve taken this from me too.</p><p>My ability to stop feeling. To stop the pain from taking me over. And now it\u2019s here, and my ribs feel as if they\u2019re going to crack from the absolute agony that\u2019s tearing through me.</p><p>No. No. No. No!</p><p>I hate him.</p><p>I hate her.</p><p>I\u2019m glad she\u2019s dead.</p><p>Crawling out of the bathroom, I struggle to my feet. My legs feel numb, my head woozy.</p><p>I stagger over to the bed. Scouring through the mess of empty bags and wrappers and containers that litter the bed and floor, I find some food. A bag of popcorn and some peanut butter cups.</p><p>No! I need more than this.</p><p>I check the bed for more food, but nothing.</p><p>Ripping open the popcorn, I shove it into my mouth, handfuls at a time, retching as I swallow, but I don\u2019t care, I push through. Then I switch to the peanut butter cups. When they\u2019re gone, I get down on my hands and knees, rummaging through the trash on the floor.</p><p>I find a jar of chocolate spread which had rolled under the bed. I crack it open and start scooping it out with my hand, shoveling it in my mouth.</p><p>Then the food\u2019s gone, and I\u2019m nowhere near full, but it\u2019ll have to do. I stumble back to the bathroom, stand over the sink, and force the food back up.</p><p>Running the water, I try to wash the sick away, but the plug is blocked. There\u2019s chocolate all over my hands and arms. Vomit in the sink. I lift my head and see myself in the mirror above it.</p><p>Disgusting.</p><p>Food is smeared across my mouth, my face ... in my hair. There\u2019s vomit on me.</p><p>I\u2019m disgusting.</p><p>I don\u2019t hate them \u2013 Jordan. Anna.</p><p>I hate me.</p><p>Anger that I\u2019ve never allowed myself to feel tears through me. I slam my fist into the mirror.</p><p>It shatters, small shards falling into the sink.</p><p>Blood drips down from my hand landing on the white tiles beneath my feet.</p><p>But I don\u2019t feel the pain in my hand, only the pain in my heart.</p><p>I close my eyes on the flood.</p><p>The self-hate. The disgust. The loss. The helplessness.</p><p>The gates open up, and it all comes washing in \u2013 fierce, like the force of a tsunami.</p><p>I grip the sink, opening my eyes, but I can\u2019t see for the hot, burning tears.</p><p>I need to get out of here. I need more ... something, anything.</p><p>Moving too quickly, shadows dance before my eyes, blinding me, taunting me. I stumble around the bathroom, searching for the doorway.</p><p>I\u2019ve overdone it.</p><p>I\u2019m going to black-out.</p><p>Fuck.</p><p>I reach my hand out for support, finding none, and it\u2019s too late, I\u2019m going down ... hard.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-Three</p><p>Jordan</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t take this any longer,\u201d I say, grabbing my car keys off the table.</p><p>I\u2019ve waited all day, but there\u2019s been no sign of Mia.</p><p>And now it\u2019s getting late.</p><p>And I\u2019m beyond fucking worried.</p><p>I tried calling her cell a few hours ago. I got her number from the booking in sheet. How bad is that \u2013 I didn\u2019t even know her cell number. But then I\u2019ve never needed to call her, and I\u2019ve not once seen her with a cell in all the time I\u2019ve been with her. Still, I had to give it a try.</p><p>It was a dead end. It was switched off, and I couldn\u2019t even leave a damn voicemail because her mailbox was full.</p><p>I\u2019m frustrated, and I feel fucking helpless, so now I\u2019m doing the only thing I can. I\u2019m going to look for her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll come with you.\u201d Dad gets to his feet.</p><p>\u201cNo, stay here in case she comes back.

I shift into gear and take a right.</p><p>It\u2019s not until I\u2019m half-way down the street, I realize I\u2019m on my way out of town. Maybe she has left, and this is my sub-conscious telling me.</p><p>Feeling disheartened, and like a complete failure, I start to make a U-turn, taking one quick glance around to make sure all is clear, and that\u2019s when I see her car. It\u2019s parked outside a seedy looking motel.</p><p>My heart stops.</p><p>Then restarts with a thundering gallop.</p><p>Swallowing my nerves, I spin around and drive into the motel lot, parking by the office.</p><p>The guy behind the desk looks like a complete stoner. He doesn\u2019t even look away from the TV when I walk in.</p> <p>I hate that Mia felt she had nowhere to stay but here. She doesn\u2019t belong in a place like this. She belongs with me.</p><p>\u201cHey man.\u201d I rest my hands on the counter. \u201cI was wondering if you to do me a favor. My girlfriend and I had a fight\u2014\u201d Girlfriend. That\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve called Mia my girlfriend. Funny when I\u2019m not even sure what we are anymore. \u201c\u2014and it was a real big one. I really need to talk to her, but she\u2019s not answering her cell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019m guessing she don\u2019t wanna talk to you,\u201d he says flatly without taking his eyes of the TV.</p><p>I curl my hands into fists.</p><p>Ignoring him, I say in a clipped tone. \u201cLook, her car\u2019s parked up front. I know she\u2019s staying here. I just need you to tell me what room she\u2019s staying in.\u201d</p><p>Technically he can\u2019t, I know this. But this isn\u2019t the most reputable of establishments. So he\u2019ll either tell me, or be a complete dick. From the look on his face, I\u2019m figuring the latter.</p><p>His lips curl as he smirks. \u201cYou\u2019re talking about the cute blonde with the tight ass, drives a car as hot as she is? Was here the other day as well \u2013 stayed for just the day.\u201d</p><p>She stayed here the other day?</p><p>All my muscles lock, rigid tight.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m guessing for a nooner,\u201d dickface continues. \u201cAnd going by the look on your face, it definitely wasn\u2019t with you.\u201d He laughs. \u201cYeah, man. You\u2019re not getting shit from me.\u201d</p><p>I reach over the counter and grab hold of his shirt, dragging him off his chair. \u201cYou will tell me what room she\u2019s in, right fuckin\u2019 now,\u201d I hiss in his face, \u201cor I\u2019m gonna kick your ass, then I\u2019m gonna bang on every fuckin\u2019 door of your scummy motel, dragging out all your regular business \u2013 the ones who don\u2019t want interrupting \u2019cause they earn by the hour \u2013 until I find her.\u201d</p><p>He opens his mouth, but I stop him before he starts.</p><p>\u201cAnd before you cry about calling the cops, my dad is the cops\u2014\u201d Okay, so that\u2019s a lie. But I\u2019m playing all I got here. \u201c\u2014so don\u2019t waste your fuckin\u2019 time \u2019cause they ain\u2019t coming out for your low rent dive, or a piece of shit like you. Now tell me what fuckin\u2019 room she\u2019s in!\u201d</p><p>He grabs his shirt, pulling it from my hand, freeing himself. \u201cFine!\u201d he huffs, breathing heavily. \u201cWhatever! Like I give a shit! She\u2019s in room 106.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee, now that wasn\u2019t so hard, was it?\u201d</p><p>I slam the door, and head down the walkway toward her room.</p><p>One-oh-six. I rap on the door and wait.</p><p>Nothing.</p><p>I look through the crack in the curtains. The room\u2019s dark except for the flickering TV, but no sign of Mia.</p><p>I knock again, louder, calling her name through the door.</p><p>Waiting, I listen for movement.</p><p>Still nothing.</p><p>\u201cMia!\u201d I bang again. \u201cI know you\u2019re in there. Your car\u2019s out front. I just need to know you\u2019re okay.\u201d</p><p>I press my ear to the door, listening for noise. Then I hear her ... faintly.</p><p>\u201cMia!\u201d I call again, my heart pounding.</p><p>\u201cJordan.\u201d</p><p>Without a second thought, I rear back and slam my foot against the lock. It gives in one kick.</p><p>I tear into the room, and I see mess everywhere. Food wrappers, containers ... just trash, everywhere.</p><p>I hear her groan. Bathroom.</p><p>She\u2019s on the floor. My stomach bottoms out.</p><p>My eyes take in everything in less than a second. Dried blood on her forehead matted into her hair. What looks like chocolate, smeared on her face.</p><p>Then the smell hits and that\u2019s when I see the vomit in the sink ... and the smashed mirror above it.</p><p>I drop to my knees beside her. \u201cMia. It\u2019s me, I\u2019m here. Jesus, baby, what happened?\u201d I take hold of her hand. Her knuckles are torn up, dried with blood \u2013 the mirror.</p><p>Fuck. What have you done to yourself, baby? Tears sting my eyes.</p><p>\u201cJordan...\u201d she groans, her eyes flicker open, looking out of focus.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here.\u201d I press my hand to her cheek. \u201cI\u2019m gonna get you some help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo...\u201d she mumbles. \u201c... be fine. Just give ... min-ute...\u201d Her eyes close.</p><p>\u201cMia, baby. Stay with me. Stay awake.\u201d I gently pat her cheek.</p><p>\u201cTired...\u201d</p><p>\u201cMia.\u201d I pat her a little harder, but she\u2019s out, and then I\u2019m dialing 9-1-1, telling them I need an ambulance immediately.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s she doing?\u201d</p><p>I stand as Dad approaches. I\u2019m in the waiting room where I\u2019ve been for the past half-hour since we arrived and they left me here, rushing Mia straight off.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re not telling me anything because apparently, I\u2019m not family.\u201d I throw my arms in the air, darting an angry look at the receptionist.</p><p>Dad puts his hands on my shoulders, bringing my attention to him. \u201cTechnically, we are family.\u201d He gives me a firm look before turning and walking over to the reception desk.</p><p>The last thing I want to do is refer to Mia as my step-sister, but if it\u2019ll get me any news on her, I\u2019ll tell them whatever the fuck they need to hear.</p><p>I pace around as I watch my dad talk to the receptionist.</p><p>He gives a few nods. Says a few things. Another nod. Then he\u2019s walking back toward me.</p><p>\u201cWhat did she say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust that Mia is currently undergoing tests, and they\u2019re extremely busy tonight so we could be waiting hours before we hear anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus.\u201d I press my fingers to the bridge of my nose, closing my eyes, trying to settle my rattling emotions. \u201cI just need to see her. Know she\u2019s okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s gonna be fine, son.\u201d His hand squeezes my shoulder. \u201cLooks like we\u2019re gonna be here a while, so I\u2019ll go get us some coffee.\u201d</p><p>I nod, and lean back against the wall, my eyes still closed.</p><p>A few hours later...</p><p>\u201cMr. Matthews?\u201d</p><p>My head jerks up. A woman, mid-thirties, hair tied in a bun and wearing a white coat, stands before me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Dr. Packard. You\u2019re Mia Monroe\u2019s family? You came in with her?\u201d</p><p>I get to my feet. \u201cYes. I\u2019m her ... her...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m her step-father,\u201d Dad cuts in, standing beside me. \u201cHow is she doing?\u201d</p><p>Dr. Packard turns her attention to Dad. I give him a grateful look.</p><p>\u201cMia suffered a small contusion to the head from her fall, nothing too serious, but what was of concern to me after initially examining Mia was that she was showing signs of severe dehydration, and her blood pressure was dangerously low\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSevere dehydration?\u201d I say, confused. \u201cWhat would cause her to be severely dehydrated?\u201d I\u2019m no doctor, but I know severe dehydration isn\u2019t something you just get.</p><p>She gives me an uncomfortable glance. Then turns to Dad. \u201cMr. Matthews...\u201d</p><p>\u201cJim, please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJim, has Mia ever had any issues in the past? Any problems with food ... of any kind?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean \u2013 problems with food?\u201d I ask.</p><p>Her eyes dart to me again. \u201cYou are Mia\u2019s...?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStep-brother.\u201d I nearly choke on the words because it couldn\u2019t be farther from the truth. \u201cJordan. I\u2019m Jordan.\u201d</p><p>She clears her throat, turning to me. \u201cJordan, after examining your step-sister, a few things I discovered brought up a concern.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat concern?\u201d My heart leaps out of my chest and starts to sprint down the hall.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not at liberty to discuss in length, not before speaking to Mia.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou asked us for a reason? What is that? You think Mia has a problem with food, so let\u2019s talk about it\u2014\u201d I\u2019m being a dick, I know, but something about this is bothering the fuck out of me. \u201c\u2014what kind of problem? Allergies? A food intolerance? An eating disord\u2014\u201d The words are out of my mouth before I even realize what I\u2019m saying.</p><p>And then I realize.</p><p>And my eyes close under the wrecking ball of that realization. The way I found her in that motel room stilling my mind into a freeze frame of events. The excessive amount of empty food wrappers. The way there was chocolate smeared on her face as if she\u2019d been gorging on it.</p><p>And she\u2019d been throwing up.</p><p>She\u2019d been throwing up.</p><p>Excessive eating. Throwing up.</p><p>Think Jordan. Think...</p><p>Bulimia.</p><p>Fuck, no.</p><p>I open my eyes. \u201cYou think Mia is bulimic.\u201d</p><p>Dr. Packard pushes her hands in her pockets, releasing a slow breath. \u201cThere are many signs pointing to that possibility, yes, but like I said, I can\u2019t be sure of anything until I\u2019ve spoken to Mia.\u201d</p><p>And my heart leaves the building.</p><p>\u201cSo talk to her \u2013 now.\u201d I gesture down the hall. \u201cI\u2019ll come with you.\u201d</p><p>She shakes her head. \u201cThat\u2019s not possible at the moment as Mia is sedated, and I\u2014\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSedated?\u201d I frown. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJordan, when Mia came around, she became quite upset. And through the stress of the situation, some other issues arose.\u201d She stops talking as someone passes by.</p><p>\u201cWhat other issues?\u201d I press, wrapping my arms around my chest, trying to hold it together because I\u2019m two seconds away from sprinting down this hall and searching every fucking room until I find her.</p><p>Dr. Packard draws her hands together in front of her. \u201cMia became extremely upset during examination, and due to the stress she was already under, and the dehydration combined, she suffered a seizure.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cA seizure. Jesus fuckin\u2019 Christ.\u201d I close my eyes on a painful breath, my hands covering my face.</p><p>I feel my dad\u2019s hand go to my back for support.</p><p>\u201cOnce we had the seizure under control, I felt it best to sedate Mia. Allow her body time to rest, and give us time to get her rehydrated intravenously as Mia was continually rejecting our efforts to help her while awake.\u201d</p><p>Rejecting their help? She didn\u2019t want to get better?</p><p>Her phone goes off in her pocket. \u201cExcuse me.\u201d She pulls out the phone, looking at. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, but I have to go.\u201d She begins backing away.</p> <p>\u201cWhen Mia\u2019s awake\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll come and tell you right away.\u201d Then she\u2019s gone.</p><p>I slump down in the nearest chair. Head in my hands.</p><p>Dad sits next to me. \u201cShe\u2019ll be okay, son. We\u2019ll help her. Whatever she needs.\u201d</p><p>I lift my head a little, and look at him. \u201cBut what if she doesn\u2019t want my help?\u201d</p><p>He gives me a sad smile. \u201cWe\u2019ll figure it out. Don\u2019t worry.\u201d</p> <p>Dad and I spend the night here in the hospital waiting room. We hear nothing more, no matter how many times I check with the receptionist, the answer is always the same \u2013 no change yet \u2013 Mia is still sleeping.</p><p>So I spend most of my time running everything over and over in my mind. Trying to figure out how I missed it. Were there any signs?</p><p>But I come up dry.</p><p>In the end, I\u2019m still no clearer on it all, so I give into sleep, stretching out across three seats, letting Dad have the bench. I close my eyes, and I\u2019m out.</p><p>When I open them again, daylight is pouring in through the large windows, and a glance at the clock tells me it\u2019s seven-thirty.</p><p>Dad is already awake, watching the news on the TV up on the wall, drinking more of that shit vending-machine coffee.</p><p>\u201cHow long you been awake?\u201d I ask, sitting. I stretch my back out, and every bone in my body cracks.</p><p>\u201cNot long.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAny news?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I got you a coffee. Might be a bit cold now.\u201d He hands it to me.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll do. Thanks.\u201d I take two large gulps of the luke warm coffee and put it on the table.</p><p>\u201cI spoke to Paula, she\u2019s on her way to the hotel now, she\u2019ll see to Dozer.\u201d</p><p>Thankfully the Perry\u2019s left the other day, so there\u2019s only Dozer that needs taking care of.</p><p>I get up to stretch my legs. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>The main doors whoosh open, throwing a cold blast of air through the room. It actually helps wake me up.</p><p>I see coming in through the doors, a guy about my age. I notice him because he\u2019s clearly money. Walks with that air of arrogance that only pricks with money do. He strides over to the reception desk.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just gonna go take a piss,\u201d I tell Dad.</p><p>I\u2019m walking past the reception desk, heading for the bathroom, when I hear that money guy talking with the receptionist.</p><p>\u201c... name is Forbes Chandler. I received a call last night telling me that my girlfriend Mia Monroe had been brought it. I want to know how she is, and when I can see her.\u201d</p><p>Blood rushes straight to my head. I stop and turn back, slowly.</p><p>\u201cYes, of course,\u201d the receptionist smiles. \u201cJust let me check.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s starts typing. Clicking on the keyboard.</p><p>He checks his watch.</p><p>That\u2019s him. This blond, prissy ass motherfucker, is the one who hurt Mia.</p><p>Why is he here? Who called him? Did Mia ask for him \u2013 did she ask them to call him?</p><p>Pain lances through me, quickly morphing to rage and despair and frustration.</p><p>Forbes turns his head in my direction. He sees me staring.</p><p>My fists tighten at my sides.</p><p>He gives me an odd look, then looks away, but he knows I\u2019m still staring at him, so he looks back.</p><p>\u201cCan I help you?\u201d he asks with a smug look on his fuck ugly face.</p><p>I take a step toward him. \u201cYou\u2019re Forbes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. I am. Who\u2019s ask\u2014?\u201d</p><p>He never finishes that sentence.</p><p>Because I punch him in the face. Hard.</p><p>He goes down from that one hit. Pussy. But I\u2019m not stopping there. I\u2019m on him, on the ground, punching him repeatedly over and over, and I can\u2019t fucking stop.</p><p>Because all I can see is Mia\u2019s black eye.</p><p>Him trying to rape her.</p><p>Her forcing herself to be sick. Passed out on that bathroom floor.</p><p>Me loving her. Wanting her.</p><p>Just pain. Fucking pain.</p><p>It\u2019s endless, relentless. And I just keep plowing my fist into his face, trying to rid myself of it.</p><p>I don\u2019t know if I\u2019d have ever stopped, or if I\u2019d have kept going until I killed him, but I don\u2019t get the chance to find out because I\u2019m pulled off him by Dad and the hospital security staff.</p><p>It takes three of them to get me off him. That\u2019s how far gone I am.</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck!\u201d he splutters through the blood in his mouth. \u201cAre you insane? You\u2019ve broken my nose!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the least of your worries,\u201d I growl. \u201cYou go near Mia ever again, and I\u2019ll fuckin\u2019 kill you!\u201d</p><p>He stills. Just a moment. Hands covering his bleeding nose, his eyes meet mine. Something in them moves. I don\u2019t know what it is, but I sure as hell don\u2019t like it.</p><p>Then his hand drops. And he smirks. \u201cMia\u2019s suckered you in good and proper.\u201d He lets out a clipped, bloody laugh. \u201cShe\u2019s good at that ... playing the victim. And I\u2019ll take it from the look on your face that you\u2019ve been fucking her. Sorry to tell you this, but you\u2019re not the first, won\u2019t be the last.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a fuckin\u2019 liar!\u201d I launch myself at him again, but I\u2019m still being held by Dad and the burly guards, so I get nowhere.</p><p>\u201cLet. Me. Fucking. Go!\u201d I yell, trying to fight them off me.</p><p>\u201cCalm the hell down!\u201d Dad hisses in my ear. \u201cKeep going like this, and they\u2019ll call the cops if they haven\u2019t already. Then they\u2019ll throw your ass in jail, and you won\u2019t be able to help Mia from there.\u201d</p><p>The instant his words hit, hearing her name in that context, I start to slow down. \u201cOkay.\u201d I\u2019m breathing hard. \u201cOkay ... you can let me go. I won\u2019t hit him again.\u201d I pin him with my eyes. \u201cNot yet, anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJordan,\u201d Dad scolds.</p><p>\u201cWhat in the world is going on here?\u201d I turn my head to see Dr. Packard walking toward us. Her eyes flick to Forbes, then back to me. She does not look happy.</p><p>\u201cDr. Packard, this man just attacked this gentleman here for no good reason.\u201d This comes from the receptionist, who is still looking a little shocked by the whole thing.</p><p>\u201cNo good reason my ass!\u201d I yell. \u201cThis motherfucker is the reason Mia is in here!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t seen Mia in two weeks\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, and why is that?\u201d I take a step toward him. Dad\u2019s arm comes in front of me, stopping me.</p><p>\u201cJordan,\u201d Dr. Packard says. \u201cYou assaulted this gentleman?\u201d</p><p>I scoff at the term. \u201cYeah, and I\u2019d do it again \u2013 with pleasure.\u201d</p><p>She turns to Forbes. \u201cMr....?\u201d</p><p>\u201cChandler.\u201d Blood is still running down his ugly face and onto his pristine hundred dollar shirt.</p><p>\u201cMr. Chandler, I\u2019ll get a nurse to clean you up. Do you want us to call the police to report this attack?\u201d</p><p>His eyes drift to me.</p><p>\u201cDo it.\u201d I step forward, pushing against Dad\u2019s arm that\u2019s still pinned across my chest. \u201cI\u2019ll happily do a stretch. And while I\u2019m with the cops, I\u2019ll tell them exactly what you did to Mia.\u201d</p><p>His eyes flash with fear.</p><p>Yeah, I know what you did, motherfucker.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He clears his throat, wiping his mouth on his sleeve. \u201cI don\u2019t want to press charges. I don\u2019t need the hassle. Just keep that psycho away from me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNurse Callaghan, can you tend to Mr. Chandler, please,\u201d Dr. Packard calls to a nurse.</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d The nurse comes over and leads him off down the hall.</p><p>I keep my eyes pinned to his back the whole way.</p><p>Dr. Packard stands in front of me, blocking my view. \u201cI don\u2019t know what that was about,\u201d she says in a lowered voice. \u201cBut if you ever behave that way in my hospital again, I\u2019ll call the cops myself, and you\u2019ll never get through the door again. Do you understand?\u201d</p><p>I exhale. \u201cYeah, I understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. Because Mia is awake, and she\u2019s asking to see you.\u201d</p><p>My head snaps up.</p><p>\u201cShe is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, so you best come with me now.\u201d She starts to walk away.</p><p>I look at Dad.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll wait out here,\u201d he says.</p><p>I mouth thanks to him. He gives me an encouraging smile.</p><p>I catch up to Dr. Packard. \u201cHow is she doing?\u201d</p><p>She looks across at me. \u201cBetter. She\u2019s been talking.\u201d</p><p>I shove my hands in my pockets. \u201cThat\u2019s good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, it is. Funny thing though, when I said to Mia that her step-brother was waiting to see her, she told me she doesn\u2019t have a step-brother. That she doesn\u2019t have any family actually.\u201d She slides a look at me.</p><p>I smile sheepishly. \u201cIt\u2019s complicated.\u201d I shrug.</p><p>\u201cLife always is.\u201d She stops near a door. \u201cMia\u2019s in here. Now, Jordan, I\u2019ve spoken at length with Mia regarding the concerns I have about her problem, and I feel it\u2019s best if you don\u2019t mention anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean don\u2019t tell her I know about the bulimia.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly. Let her tell you \u2013 I\u2019m sure she will. She\u2019s very aware of her problem, but she\u2019s also had a massive shock to bring about this realization. It\u2019s an upsetting subject for her. I don\u2019t want her upset any more than she already has been.\u201d</p><p>I nod. \u201cI hear you, doc. I\u2019ll do whatever it takes to help her.\u201d</p><p>She smiles. \u201cYes, I can see that.\u201d</p><p>I turn to the door.</p><p>\u201cJordan.\u201d</p><p>I look over my shoulder at her.</p><p>\u201cYou might want to clean the blood off your hands before you go in.\u201d</p><p>I glance down at my hands. I\u2019ve got that fuckers blood all over them. \u201cShit, yeah.\u201d</p><p>She pulls a handkerchief from her pocket, then walks over to the water dispenser a little farther down the hall. Pressing the tap, she wets the handkerchief underneath, then brings back to me.</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d Taking it, I scrub the blood from my knuckles, then offer it back to her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m good.\u201d She holds her hand up, smiling. \u201cKeep it.\u201d</p><p>I let out a small laugh. \u201cThanks.\u201d I shove the handkerchief into my pocket. Then taking a deep breath, I push the door to Mia\u2019s room open.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-Four</p><p>Mia</p> <p>One look at Jordan and I know.</p><p>I can\u2019t be with him anymore.</p><p>Not because I don\u2019t love him, I do, but all I see when I look at him is my mother\u2019s betrayal. She chose to raise him, not me.</p><p>It hurts to be near him.</p><p>I don\u2019t want to end up resenting Jordan for everything he had, everything that should have been mine. This isn\u2019t his fault \u2013 what my so called mother did wasn\u2019t his fault. My rational side knows this, but it doesn\u2019t change the way I feel. She wanted him. Not me.</p> <p>I can understand why. He\u2019s such a beautiful, amazing person. He shines so bright. He is so much more than me.</p><p>And he deserves better than I can ever give.</p><p>He deserves better than I am.</p><p>I\u2019m broken. Damaged.</p><p>Dr. Packard thinks I\u2019m repairable. I\u2019m not so sure about that. Look at me \u2013 where I am right now. What I\u2019ve done to myself.</p><p>I\u2019ve hit bottom. Now, I need to figure out if I can ever climb back up, but I have to do that without Jordan.</p> <p>\u201cHey.\u201d He closes the door behind him.</p><p>\u201cHi.\u201d</p><p>I can barely bring myself to look at him. It hurts, knowing that this will be the last time I\u2019ll see him.</p><p>I\u2019ve known him such a short time, but the time feels irrelevant. It\u2019s as if I\u2019ve known him always. And never seeing him again will be the hardest thing I\u2019ll ever do. Harder than living through Oliver. Harder than getting away from Forbes. Harder than combating my illness.</p><p>Jordan takes the seat by my bed. The seat Dr. Packard recently vacated, after spending a good hour talking to me about my illness. I didn\u2019t go to in depth about my issue with food, but it was hard to avoid the bulimia conversation as being a medical professional, she knew. I tried to deny it at first, but the signs were all there for her to read.</p><p>After I confessed to her \u2013 the first person I have ever told \u2013 and how long I\u2019ve been eating and purging\u2014ten years\u2014she went on to tell me everything I already knew, about the damage I\u2019m doing to my body, the health risks \u2013 liver or kidney failure ... possibly death.</p><p>You\u2019d think already knowing these things would have stopped me a long time ago, but I didn\u2019t want to think of those things. I just wanted the pain to stop, and for a long time it helped. And maybe, deep down, I did want to die.</p><p>But after being in here, talking with Dr. Packard ... but mainly from knowing Jordan and my time with him, I\u2019ve realized that what I want is to live and be happy.</p> <p>And to do that, I need help.</p><p>Dr. Packard told me of a specialized clinic that can help me, and that she would refer me to them, but for the treatment to work, I have to want it \u2013 I have to want to get better.</p><p>And I do. I\u2019m ready to get better. I need to get better.</p><p>Dr. Packard is calling the clinic now to see if they have a place for me, so all that\u2019s left for me to do is tell Jordan that I\u2019m leaving.</p><p>\u201cHow are you doing?\u201d he asks, his voice soft.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m okay.\u201d I glance at him. His eyes are on my face, deep and dark and searching.</p><p>It hurts so badly to look at him. Each time I do, I\u2019m confused by the love I feel for him and the past he represents. The past that should have been mine.</p><p>Looking down, my fingers trace patterns over the comforter. \u201cJordan ... I need to apologize for how you found me in that motel room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m gonna stop right you there. You don\u2019t have anything to be sorry for. I\u2019m just relieved that I did find you and that you\u2019re okay.\u201d His fingers rub at his chest. \u201cI\u2019m the one who has everything to apologize for, babe. You wouldn\u2019t have gone there ... been alone if it weren\u2019t for me keeping...\u201d He runs his hand through his dark hair, blowing out a breath. \u201cGod, I\u2019m just so fuckin\u2019 sorry that I didn\u2019t tell you about my mom\u2014\u201d He stops short.</p><p>His mom. He\u2019s right, she was his mom.</p><p>His eyes flash to mine. They\u2019re filled with apologies, and sorrow. He feels sorry for me. Pity.</p><p>I hate pity.</p><p>\u201cI just...\u201d He exhales. \u201cI should have told you the moment I found out that Belle was Anna ... your mother,\u201d he highlights this, his voice deep and low with meaning.</p><p>I turn my head and stare out the window. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, it does. And I want you to know I\u2019m sorry ... for everything. I know it doesn\u2019t seem like it, but I would never do anything to hurt you. I was just afraid to tell you. That if I did, I\u2019d lose you.\u201d He slides his fingers over my hand.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t.\u201d I pull my hand away.</p><p>I have to shield my heart from the look of hurt on his face.</p><p>The silence between us is blistering.</p><p>He scrubs his hands over his face. \u201cHave I lost you?\u201d His words are so quiet, but they hurt with the intensity of a scream.</p><p>I close my eyes on the tears burning them. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Jordan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus...\u201d He shakes his head. \u201cJust tell me one thing \u2013 is it because I kept it from you, or because of Belle?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not because of you, it\u2019s because of me\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t give me the \u2018it\u2019s not you, it\u2019s me\u2019 bullshit!\u201d He stands, moving away from the bed.</p><p>He\u2019s angry. Anger I can work with. Anger I understand.</p><p>\u201cJust give me the truth, Mia. You might not think I deserve it, but it\u2019s all I\u2019m asking of you.\u201d</p><p>My eyes snap to him. \u201cFine.\u201d I sit up on my haunches. \u201cYou want the truth? The truth is every single time I look at your face, I see everything I never had \u2013 what she should have given me, but instead chose to give to you. Do I blame you for that? No. But it doesn\u2019t change the fact that the woman who gave birth to me\u2014who was supposed to be my mother\u2014chose to be yours. She left me with him!\u201d My voice is getting louder, and my hands are shaking, but I can\u2019t seem to stop. \u201cAnd I hate the way that makes me feel \u2013 knowing that she chose you over me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe didn\u2019t choose me!\u201d He bangs his hand against his chest. \u201cI wasn\u2019t anything to do with her decision \u2013 you need to hear me out, so you can understand\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d I press my hands to my head. \u201cI can\u2019t hear anymore!\u201d I know what I feel is irrational, but I can\u2019t think straight in this moment. All I can do is feel \u2013 and I feel irrational.</p><p>\u201cI hate this! I hate everything! I hate me!\u201d I\u2019m crying now.</p><p>Jordan crosses the room in a few strides and pulls me into his arms.</p><p>The feel of him...</p><p>His heat and strength...</p><p>I curl my fingers into his shirt. \u201cEverything\u2019s a mess. I\u2019m a mess.\u201d I sniffle, pulling away, unable to be this close to him knowing that I\u2019m leaving.</p><p>Not willing to let me go, he takes my face in his hands.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not a mess.\u201d He sweeps his thumbs over my cheeks, drying my tears. \u201cJust talk to me, babe. Let me help you.\u201d</p><p>A crushing feeling in my chest takes my breath with it. \u201cAfter everything I just said to you ... you still want to help me. Why?\u201d</p><p>His grip on my face increases. His eyes darkening. \u201cBecause I fuckin\u2019 love you, Mia.\u201d His eyes close, almost as if he\u2019s in pain.</p><p>He loves me.</p><p>Jordan rests his forehead against mine, his hand sliding around to cup the back of my neck.</p><p>\u201cThat didn\u2019t come out exactly as I\u2019d planned, but it is the truth. I\u2019m in love you with.\u201d His breath fans my skin. His words crush my heart. \u201cI know it\u2019s probably too soon, and I know you have a lot to deal with right now and that I\u2019m the cause of some of it, but I just want you to know the extent of my feelings for you before you throw us away. I love you, Mia. Every part of you. The best and worst. The broken, the perfect. The bad, the good. You\u2019re it for me, babe. I see only you.\u201d</p><p>He loves me.</p><p>Jordan is in love with me.</p><p>Me.</p><p>I love him too. So much.</p><p>But it won\u2019t work.</p><p>I\u2019m too broken. Too hurt. Too resentful.</p><p>And I can\u2019t see any of that going away anytime soon.</p><p>He deserves so much more than I can give him. And to tell him that I love him would be wrong and selfish of me.</p><p>I open my eyes. \u201cI\u2019m leaving Durango.\u201d</p><p>He pulls back from me, hand still curled around my nape. \u201cAre you going back to Boston?\u201d</p><p>I frown. \u201cNo. That\u2019s the last place I\u2019d go. Why would you think that?\u201d</p><p>He shakes his head. Eyes down.</p><p>This is it. I have to tell him about my illness. \u201cJordan, there\u2019s something you don\u2019t know about me...\u201d I stall, blowing out a breath. \u201cWhen you found me in the motel room ... I don\u2019t know if you saw all the empty food wrappers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI saw them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell ... I have this problem.\u201d I dig my fingernails into the bed of my hand. \u201cWhen I\u2019m stressed or upset, I, uh ... I eat ... a lot of food, then I, uh ... I make myself throw it back up.\u201d</p><p>He doesn\u2019t react. Doesn\u2019t move. He just stares back at me with the same emotion that was there moments ago.</p><p>\u201cI have an illness called bulimia, Jordan. I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve heard of it before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve heard of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. Well, it\u2019s not \u2013 for me, anyway \u2013 about being thin,\u201d I clarify. \u201cIt\u2019s about the problems up here.\u201d I touch my fingers to my head. \u201cWhen things in my life are too painful, or out of my control, or just too much for me to deal with, I take the pain away using the comfort of food. Then to get the control back, I guess you could say, I make myself throw the food back up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long has it been going on for?\u201d he asks softly.</p><p>I take a deep breath. \u201cTen years, on and off. Worse in the last few.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do we fix this?\u201d</p><p>I meet his determined eyes. \u201cWe don\u2019t. I have to.\u201d Blowing out a breath, I tell him, \u201cThere\u2019s a specialist facility in Denver for people who suffer with eating disorders like mine. I\u2019m going there to try and get better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long will you be there for?\u201d</p><p>I lift my shoulders. \u201cI don\u2019t know ... however long it takes, I guess.\u201d</p><p>His eyes lift. I see a flicker of hope in them. \u201cDenver\u2019s not far, Mia \u2013 like a six hour drive, max \u2013 I\u2019ll drive out every weekend to visit\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I say, squashing his hope.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he echoes.</p><p>\u201cI have to do this alone.\u201d I pull on my lower lip. \u201cI don\u2019t want you to come visit me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay...\u201d He rubs the bridge of his nose with his finger. \u201cWhat about when you\u2019re better ... can I see you then?\u201d</p><p>I look away from him.</p><p>It makes no difference because I can feel his eyes on me. It hurts. So much. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I shake my head slowly.</p><p>\u201cAh ... right. Okay ... so you really meant it before when you said I\u2019d lost you.\u201d He sounds in pain, hurt, and it\u2019s awful.</p><p>But I am doing the right thing \u2013 I know I am.</p><p>The resentment I feel isn\u2019t going anywhere. And eventually it would eat at me ... us, and in the end there\u2019d be nothing left but hate and hurt.</p> <p>I\u2019ve had enough hurt to last a lifetime. Better to end things now, than later.</p><p>I feel the bed shift as he stands. \u201cWill you do one thing for me?\u201d</p><p>I lift my eyes to him, but I\u2019m unprepared for the pain than slices through me when I see the pure look of it on his face.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t shut out the next person who tries to get close to you. Tell them everything. Don\u2019t worry that they won\u2019t love you because they will. It\u2019s impossible not to love you, Mia.\u201d He lets out a resigned sigh. \u201cI know that better than anyone.\u201d</p><p>I slide my hand across my chest, gripping at the place where my aching heart is. And in this moment, I crumble, changing my mind, ready to tell him that I love him. That I\u2019ll find a way to get beyond how I feel.</p> <p>But before I get a chance to part my dry lips, he\u2019s gone, the door banging closed in his wake.</p><p>Panic claws at my chest. I want to run after him. Tell him I was wrong.</p><p>But my legs don\u2019t move. And I know why.</p><p>Because deep down I know letting him go is the right thing.</p><p>I slide down the bed, turning on my side as I pull my knees to my chest, hugging them.</p><p>I\u2019m wiping at my tears when I hear the door open.</p> <p>Jordan.</p><p>My heart leaps.</p><p>I turn around.</p><p>Forbes.</p><p>Oh god no.</p><p>No.</p><p>I can feel my body turning in on itself. Like a snail, retreating into its shell.</p><p>What is he doing here? How did he know I was here? What happened to his face?</p> <p>His nose is taped up. His face cut and bloody.</p><p>He shuts the door behind him, and my blood turns cold.</p><p>My eyes start scanning the room looking for an escape, but my only current escape is the door he\u2019s standing in front of. I could always make a dash for the bathroom and lock myself inside.</p><p>\u201cF-Forbes,\u201d I finally manage.</p><p>\u201cHow are you feeling?\u201d he asks perfectly normal, as if the last time I saw him didn\u2019t involve him beating and attempting to rape me.</p><p>\u201cH-how did you know you know I was here?\u201d</p><p>He smiles, and it makes my blood run cold. \u201cI\u2019m your emergency contact on your medical insurance, remember? The minute they brought you in, I got a call. I came straight away. I was worried about you, baby. I\u2019ve been worried about you for the last two weeks. Not knowing where you were ... it\u2019s been torture.\u201d He takes a step closer to me.</p><p>I scrabble back in bed, covering my legs with the hospital gown I\u2019m wearing. It\u2019s my natural reaction.</p><p>And I hate that it is.</p><p>He holds his hands in a placating manner. \u201cI\u2019m not going to hurt you, Mia. That\u2019s not why I\u2019m here.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t believe him. I\u2019ve heard that from him so many times before.</p><p>I slide my hand behind my back, searching for the emergency buzzer.</p><p>\u201cI just want to talk to you.\u201d He sits down in the chair by the bed. I stop moving my hand, shifting my body a little to hide what I\u2019m reaching for.</p><p>\u201cW-what do you want?\u201d I try to hold my voice steady.</p><p>\u201cI want you to come home.\u201d</p><p>I can feel my head shaking before I even have a chance to think through what I\u2019m doing. I know it\u2019s the wrong thing, and even more so when I see the flare of anger in his eyes.</p><p>I swallow past the dry in my throat as I creep my fingers outward, trying to find the buzzer.</p><p>\u201cMia...\u201d He sighs, rubbing his temple, shaking his head. \u201cThat\u2019s not the answer I want to hear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened to your face?\u201d I ask. A diversion tactic until I can figure a way out of this.</p><p>His face darkens. \u201cIt\u2019s irrelevant.\u201d</p><p>I bind my hands together.</p><p>\u201cMia, I came all this way, and I\u2019m not leaving without you. And really, what do you have here? Nothing. You\u2019re all alone. You need me. You can\u2019t survive without me.\u201d</p><p>I wrap my hands around my cold body.</p><p>He\u2019s right. I am alone, but alone is better than with him.</p><p>Forbes stands. \u201cWhere are your things?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have anything here with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. That makes it easier.\u201d He picks my folded up, dirty clothes from the side. \u201cWhat the fuck are these?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy clothes.\u201d</p><p>The look of disgust on his face is so familiar to me.</p><p>He\u2019s so familiar to me.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll pick you some clothes up at the airport, but for now, get dressed.\u201d He throws the clothes on the bed in front of me.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>He looks at me. Anger is dominating him now. \u201cBecause we\u2019re leaving this fuckin\u2019 hick of a town and going home. So get your ass fuckin\u2019 dressed!\u201d he hisses.</p><p>This is the Forbes I know so well.</p><p>Fear controlling me, and unsure what else to do, I obediently climb off the bed and pick the clothes up to change in the bathroom.</p><p>\u201cWhere the fuck are you going?\u201d he snaps.</p><p>\u201cTo change,\u201d I answer in a small voice.</p><p>\u201cChange here.\u201d He moves across the room toward me, predatory in his step.</p><p>My heart stops. I hold still to the spot, fear still controlling me like a sickness.</p><p>Running his finger down my bare arm, he leans close to my mouth. \u201cI\u2019ve missed you, baby ... I want to see you.\u201d</p><p>His touch ignites painful memories of all the times he hit me, kicked me, punched me ... violated me. His hand feels like a disease of the worst kind. A sick, awful disease I want off me, and away from. Now.</p><p>My heart kickstarts, and begins pumping hard in my chest.</p><p>I won\u2019t leave here with him.</p><p>I can\u2019t.</p><p>Holding the clothes to my chest, I lift my chin. \u201cI\u2019m not going back to Boston with you.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s no hesitation. He grabs me by the throat. Pushing me down onto the bed. \u201cYou will do as I fuckin\u2019 tell you! You will get dressed. Then you will leave this hospital, and get on a plane home with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I croak out.</p><p>His hand grabs at my gown, lifting it. He grabs the fabric of my panties and tears them off my body. His knee comes between my thighs. I press my legs together, trying to keep him out, but he\u2019s too strong, and he pries them apart.</p><p>With his knee pressed painfully up against the most intimate part of me, he leans into my face. \u201cDo I need to teach you another lesson, Mia?\u201d</p><p>Fear and memories start to take hold.</p><p>And I stop them as soon as they start. I will not be controlled.</p><p>Not by him.</p><p>Not by anyone.</p><p>Ever again.</p><p>I hate Forbes more in this moment than I ever have. And it gives me strength. Strength I need.</p><p>Slowly, I shake my head.</p><p>He smiles, a winners smile. \u201cGood girl.\u201d Then he pulls my gown aside, revealing my naked breast. \u201cSo fucking beautiful,\u201d he says, pressing his hand to my chest, moving his disgusting fingers over my nipple. He squeezes.</p><p>I close my eyes on the pain. Tears press from the corners of my eyes.</p><p>Jordan. It\u2019s a silent scream in my mind. A plea for him to come back. To make right on his promise when he said that he would never let anyone hurt me, ever again.</p><p>But Jordan\u2019s not coming because I sent him away.</p><p>This is for me to do. And I can do it.</p><p>Slowly, I lift my hand to Forbes\u2019 face. His eyes fire with triumph, and I know I have him.</p><p>Tilting my chin, I offer my mouth to him.</p><p>His eyes flare. \u201cTell me you want me, Mia. Say, \u2018Fuck me, Forbes. Please.\u2019 I want to hear you beg, baby.\u201d</p><p>I swallow down all the words I want to say, and do as he says, \u201cFuck me, Forbes. Please,\u201d I say in a steady voice.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s my, girl.\u201d He smirks, lowering his face to mine.</p><p>The instant his lips touch mine, I moan, knowing it will turn him on to deepen the kiss. And that\u2019s the moment when I go back to the tactic I used the last time, and bite down on his lower lip. But this time, I bite like I mean it.</p><p>His blood floods my mouth, along with his yell of pain.</p><p>\u201cYou fuckin\u2019 bitch!\u201d He hits me hard.</p><p>Pain explodes in my head. His grip on my throat tightens. Breathing quickly gets hard.</p><p>I need to get out of this, but I can\u2019t move my body, so my hands slap him, scratching, pushing, just trying anything I can to get him off me, but he\u2019s unmoving.</p><p>It\u2019s when he\u2019s rearing back to hit me again, fist clenched, that I turn my head away.</p><p>And that\u2019s when I see my escape, on the table by the bed.</p><p>Without another thought, I grab the glass water jug and using all the strength I have, I hit him with it.</p><p>I make contact with the side of his head. I feel and hear the dull thud of the glass as it strikes his skull.</p><p>Water spills out, soaking my face and hair.</p><p>Forbes looks stunned. Like he can\u2019t believe I really just hit him with it.</p><p>He wobbles, but he\u2019s still upright, and I need him down.</p><p>So I pull back and hit him again. Harder this time. And that\u2019s when he goes down, falling right on top of me.</p><p>The jug drops from my hand and hits the floor with a loud shatter.</p><p>I\u2019m panicking, coughing up his blood mixed in with my own, just needing him off me. Terrified that he\u2019s going to wake up and then it\u2019s game over for me.</p><p>With unknown strength, I manage to struggle out from underneath him. Sliding off the bed, my eyes trained on his unmoving body, my bare feet hit the floor.</p><p>Glass shards cut straight through the soles of my feet, I bite my lip on the cry of pain I want to make.</p><p>Not taking my eyes off Forbes, I grab the emergency buzzer by the bed, pressing it multiple times. Then as quietly as I can, I move across the floor, stifling my urges to cry out as the glass continues to cut mercilessly, into my feet.</p><p>I\u2019m steps from the door, when I hear running footsteps down the hall. Then the door bursts open. It\u2019s Dr. Packard with a security guard flanking her.</p><p>Thank god.</p><p>\u201cMia, what on earth has happened? Are you okay? We heard glass breaking, then your buzzer was going off frantic!\u201d Her eyes sweep the room taking in the state of me and Forbes out on the bed. \u201cOh, my god, are you okay?\u201d</p><p>I take a few steps toward her, stumbling, I collapse, relief taking me down.</p><p>Dr. Packard catches me, holding me in her arms. \u201cIt\u2019s okay, Mia,\u201d she soothes, holding me to her. \u201cYou\u2019re going to be okay.\u201d</p><p>But in this moment, her words aren\u2019t so easy to believe. And all I can think is how much I wish it were Jordan\u2019s arms around me right now.</p><p>But they never will be again.</p><p>And I only have myself to blame for that.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-Five</p><p>Jordan</p><p>Day two: post-Mia...</p><p>\u201cJordan.\u201d</p><p>Dad knocks on my door.</p><p>I ignore him. I\u2019m not in the mood to talk to anyone right now.</p><p>The only one I want to keep company with is the one who understands my pain best \u2013 Dozer. He\u2019s missing Mia as much as I am.</p><p>I hear the door open.</p><p>\u201cGo away,\u201d I mumble into my pillow. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Dozer lifts his head, looks up, then lays back down.</p><p>\u201cYou really need to open the window, let some air in. It stinks in here,\u201d Dad says, ignoring me.</p><p>\u201cI like the stink.\u201d</p><p>Truth is, I don\u2019t want to open the window in case the fresh air takes the scent of Mia from my bedding, disappearing just like she has from my life.</p> <p>\u201cYou really need to leave this room, Jordan.\u201d He sits on the edge of my bed. \u201cIt\u2019s been two days. This isn\u2019t healthy. Let\u2019s go to the movies or something.\u201d</p><p>I tilt my head, moving my mouth from the pillow. \u201cNot in the mood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, can you at least consider taking a shower because the stench in this room isn\u2019t Dozer, it\u2019s you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll shower when I\u2019m ready.\u201d I press my face back into the pillow.</p><p>\u201cLook, son. I know you\u2019re hurting right now, but it will get better.\u201d</p> <p>I snort. Then get another lung full of Mia. It makes my chest burn.</p><p>\u201cI have been through this myself ... when I was younger. With Belle\u2014\u201d</p><p>My muscles knot. I lift my head. \u201cI don\u2019t want to talk about her right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you\u2019re angry with your mom\u2014\u201d</p><p>I roll onto my back. \u201cAngry doesn\u2019t ever come close ... I just ... I don\u2019t understand her. Why she did what she did.\u201d</p><p>He sighs. \u201cI didn\u2019t either. But it\u2019s not for us to judge. We weren\u2019t there. We don\u2019t know where her mind was at, or how limited she felt her choices were.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI just wish...\u201d I sigh. \u201cI just wish Mia could see the bigger picture. I wish she ... I don\u2019t know what I fuckin\u2019 wish!\u201d I throw my hands up in the air, feeling helpless.</p><p>What I want is to not feel this way. Like I\u2019m fucking dying \u2013 slowly.</p><p>I turn over, putting my back to him.</p><p>\u201cYou wish she\u2019d see past it and come back.\u201d</p><p>Tears sting my eyes. \u201cIt\u2019s too late now. She\u2019s gone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s never too late. You know how Belle broke up with me after high school, when she\u2019d left for college. I was pretty much like you are now. I was low and didn\u2019t want to talk to anyone. I guess I was lovesick. I just wanted to reach her ... so I wrote her a letter and made her a mix-tape.\u201d</p><p>I let out a small laugh. My first in days. \u201cThat\u2019s pretty lame, Dad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, it was.\u201d He runs his hand over his hair, smiling lightly.</p> <p>\u201cDid you hear from her after you sent the letter and tape?\u201d</p><p>He shakes his head. \u201cNo. I didn\u2019t hear from her until she came back after I\u2019d had you.\u201d</p><p>I sit up, back against the headboard. \u201cSo you\u2019re saying I should write Mia a letter and make her a lame ass mix-tape when it didn\u2019t even work for you. Mom married someone else and didn\u2019t come back to you for years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it didn\u2019t work for me ... not right away. Doesn\u2019t mean it won\u2019t for you. But I\u2019m telling you this because whether it worked in a day, or years later \u2013 it worked. She never got rid of that letter and tape, Jordan. She kept them for all those years. She never let me go, not fully. And when she needed help ... needed me most, that\u2019s how she knew she could come back. That letter and tape reminded her that she could. Reminded her of what we once had. That I\u2019d always be there for her, no matter what.\u201d</p><p>He gets to his feet and pats Dozer\u2019s leg. \u201cCome on, boy, it\u2019s feeding time.\u201d</p><p>Dozer climbs down from the bed, standing by Dad\u2019s legs.</p><p>\u201cJust think about it. You\u2019ve nothing to lose by reaching out to her. Write and tell her everything she doesn\u2019t think she wants to hear, but needs to. Tell her how you feel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBasically make a fool of myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMen generally are fools in love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well I\u2019d definitely look a fool if I send her a lame ass mix-tape.\u201d I know I\u2019m stepping out of line and he doesn\u2019t deserve it, but I\u2019m feeling bitter and angry, and I don\u2019t want to be alone in my pain.</p><p>\u201cWell, I think it\u2019d be a mixed CD for you, son, or even an iPod if you\u2019re feeling flashy, as they don\u2019t make tapes anymore.\u201d</p><p>I give him a look and a grunt.</p><p>Yeah, I\u2019ve turned back into a fully-fledged teenager.</p><p>\u201cLook, son, all I\u2019m saying is, music can evokes memories and feelings. It can enhance those words you write to her. It\u2019s just knowing which memories you want to trigger, what words you want her to hear, and which song will do that for you.\u201d</p><p>He leaves my room with Dozer, his words lingering long after he\u2019s gone.</p><p>Day three: post-Mia...</p><p>\u201cJeez ... you\u2019re listening to Damien Rice. This is worse than I thought.\u201d Beth drops down onto my bed beside me.</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t you people just leave me the fuck alone?\u201d I pull the duvet over my head.</p><p>Beth pulls it off and sniffs the air. \u201cIt smells really bad in here, did you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been told.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think its Dozer.\u201d She leans over and sniffs me. \u201cJesus Christ! It\u2019s you \u2013 you smelly bastard! When was the last time you showered, or brushed your teeth?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt three o\u2019 fuck off a clock.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFunny.\u201d She pokes me in the back. \u201cSo to what extent am I going to have to annoy you to get you out of this bed and into the shower? Or at least get you to visit with a toothbrush?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re already annoying me and it doesn\u2019t look like I\u2019m moving, does it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on, stinky breath.\u201d She tickles my side.</p><p>I push her hand off. \u201cBeth, seriously, knock it off. I\u2019m not in the mood.\u201d</p><p>Her silence has me feeling guilty. \u201cLook ... I\u2019m just not up for company right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I brought your favorite pie \u2013 Key Lime.\u201d I can practically see her pout from here. \u201cAnd some movies with tons of action, killing bad guys, all that gory type shit you like. I even think a chick gets blown up in one, or at the very least she gets her ass kicked.\u201d</p><p>I twist my neck to look at her. \u201cWatching a chick get her ass kicked? That\u2019s how you intend on cheering me up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, I\u2019m no expert. I\u2019m just doing what my best friend did for me a few years ago when my heart got ripped in two.\u201d</p><p>I roll onto my back and look at her, remembering how I sat in Beth\u2019s room with her for a day and a half straight after that bitch Monica Teller had broken her heart.</p><p>Beth was crazy about her\u2014kind of how I am for Mia.</p><p>And that bitch Monica told Beth she was in it with her too, wanted to be with her, but when it came down to it, she was too chicken shit to tell her religious folks that she was a lesbian, so she dumped Beth and married the douche they wanted her to marry.</p><p>Beth cried for a week straight after Monica got married.</p><p>And now she\u2019s here, trying to help me like I did for her.</p><p>I feel a pang in my chest for my best friend. Sitting up, I take her face in my hands and kiss her forehead. \u201cThanks, Beth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEww! At least use mouthwash or something before you kiss me. I could catch cooties from that days old breath!\u201d</p><p>I chuckle, climbing from the bed and turn my iPod off, silencing Damien Rice.</p><p>\u201cGet the bitch ass-kicking movie ready while I take a shower.\u201d Reaching the bathroom door, I pull my t-shirt off and toss it in the laundry basket.</p><p>\u201cBeth?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know how much you mean to me, right? That you\u2019re not just my best friend, you\u2019re like my sister?\u201d</p><p>She glances at me, smiling. \u201cAre you getting all emotional on me, Matthews?\u201d</p><p>I shrug. \u201cMaybe. A little. I just wanted you to know that I love you is all.\u201d I close the door on her shocked expression.</p><p>Beth knows I love her, I\u2019ve just never told her before now. It felt good to say, and kind of awesome to see the happy it put on her face.</p><p>I make a mental note to tell her more often from here on now.</p><p>I guess I have Mia to thank for opening this up in me. She got me feeling again ... maybe more than ever before.</p><p>\u201cI thought there was no romance in this movie?\u201d I complain, licking the pie off my fingers.</p><p>Fuck that was some good pie.</p><p>Beth grabs the case, reading over the back. \u201cIt said there wasn\u2019t. Just, and I quote, \u2018plenty of high action ass-kicking\u2019.</p><p>\u201cWell the only ass-kicking going on right now is from her stilettos, digging in his ass while he screws her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess maybe sex isn\u2019t classed as romance nowadays.\u201d Beth tosses the case to the floor and tilts her head at an angle, watching the two getting it on, on screen. \u201cSeriously, I\u2019ll never understand a woman who likes cock.\u201d</p><p>I let out a laugh. \u201cThat\u2019s because you\u2019ve never had it.\u201d</p><p>She look across at me grinning. \u201cAnd I intend on keeping it that way, thank you very much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t offering.\u201d</p><p>She jabs me in the arm.</p><p>\u201cYou hit like a girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am a girl.\u201d She folds her arms.</p><p>I look back to the TV. They\u2019ve finally finished going at it, but now we\u2019re into the post coital bliss where they\u2019re cuddled up in bed.</p><p>Fucking excellent. Just what I want to see. A happy couple together.</p><p>I grit my teeth, thinking of Mia in my arms. How soft and warm her body felt against mine.</p><p>I miss her.</p><p>Jesus.</p><p>I close my eyes on the ache in my chest.</p><p>\u201cThis movie sucks,\u201d I grind out.</p><p>\u201cThe movie does suck, you\u2019re right, but it\u2019s not the movie that\u2019s bothering you.\u201d</p><p>I let out a resigned breath. \u201cI miss her.\u201d I open my eyes and turn my head to look at Beth. \u201cIs it fucked up that I miss her this much after knowing her for such a short time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Who\u2019s to determine what\u2019s wrong or right. You feel what you feel. Time is irrelevant in my opinion. And I\u2019m always right, before you have a comeback.\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t muster the energy to find a comeback. And honestly, I think she\u2019s right. Though I\u2019d never tell her that.</p><p>I glance back at the TV, drumming my fingers on my thigh.</p><p>\u201cDad thinks I should write Mia a letter,\u201d I say quietly.</p><p>Beth sits up, putting herself in my eye line, blocking my view of the TV. \u201cI think that\u2019s a really good idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd he also said I should send her a mixed CD.\u201d</p><p>A grins slides across her face. \u201cOkay, so maybe leave the mixed CD out of it. What would you say in the letter?\u201d</p><p>Sliding down the bed so I\u2019m flat on my back, I rest my arm over my eyes. \u201cI don\u2019t know...\u201d I shrug. \u201cI guess I\u2019d tell her that I miss her. That it\u2019s getting harder and harder to breathe without her. For every day she\u2019s gone ... every day that I don\u2019t get to see her face or hear her voice, takes me a step closer to insanity.\u201d I hear the break in my voice, and it stops me talking.</p><p>I swallow past the pain.</p><p>Beth lies down beside me and rests her head on my shoulder. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI think you should write her a letter saying exactly that.\u201d She sniffles.</p><p>\u201cAre you crying?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I\u2019m fucking crying! I\u2019m a girl, aren\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>Trust Beth to find the way to make me smile through the pain.</p> <p>Day seven: post-Mia...</p><p>I seal the envelope. The envelope that contains the letter that\u2019s taken me four fucking days to write. If you saw the letter, you\u2019d be confused as to why it took me four days to write.</p><p>Basically, the letter is shit. Because I can\u2019t write for shit.</p><p>And that\u2019s the reason for the CD inside this envelope.</p><p>Yeah, I\u2019ve become that guy.</p> <p>The kind of guy that makes a CD with one song on it to tell the girl he loves how he feels.</p><p>I\u2019ve come to terms with the fact that I lost my balls ages ago. I figured it out when I couldn\u2019t get out of bed for three days over Mia leaving me.</p><p>So now me and my ball-less self is hoping that this song will tell her everything I\u2019m failing to. Worst case, she\u2019ll think I\u2019m lame and laugh her ass off, and I\u2019ll never hear from her again. But one thing I know for sure; whenever she hears this song, she\u2019ll always think of me, because there are a handful of songs that I can\u2019t listen to now without thinking of her. The first time I heard her singing in my car to that Taylor Swift song that I hate, but now listen to all the time ... and the Will.i.am song that was playing the first time I kissed her.</p><p>Dad was right when he said music evokes memories.</p><p>This song might not evoke her memory, but it will tell her where I\u2019m at right now, and hopefully bring her back to me. And that hope is all I\u2019ve got left now.</p><p>I take a deep breath and drop the envelope in the mailbox.</p> <p>Chapter Twenty-Six</p><p>Mia</p><p>Two and a half months later...</p><p>\u201cYou still haven\u2019t opened that?\u201d</p><p>I glance over my shoulder to see Danni standing in the doorway. Danni is a patient at the clinic, like me. Except Danni suffers with anorexia. It\u2019s her second time back in. Not here. She was at a different help facility a few years ago, got better. But she relapsed recently. We met here on my first day. She\u2019s a great friend to have as she understands everything I go through.</p><p>I\u2019ve never had a female friend before, and it\u2019s been wonderful to have one who understands me as well as Danni does. I\u2019ve told her everything about me. Jordan\u2019s words haunted me when he said I should open up to the next person who tries to get close to me, so I took that chance on Danni, and I\u2019m glad I did.</p><p>She\u2019s helped me so much. We\u2019ve helped each other.</p><p>After what happened at the hospital, after Forbes\u2019 attack, Dr. Packard encouraged me to press charges, so I did. Having Danni to hold my hand through it really helped.</p> <p>Thankfully I didn\u2019t have to go to court as I was here in the clinic.</p><p>Forbes didn\u2019t get jail time for assaulting me at the hospital. I\u2019m not sad about that as I never thought he would. He got a twelve month suspended sentence, and was forced to attend anger management classes.</p><p>I also took out a restraining order. Not that it would do any good. If Forbes wanted to get me, he would. But honestly, I don\u2019t think he will. I think we\u2019re finally done.</p><p>\u201cNo, I still haven\u2019t opened it.\u201d I sigh.</p><p>She comes over and sits on my bed. \u201cYou\u2019ve spent so long staring at that thing, I\u2019m surprised you haven\u2019t burned a hole in it. Why don\u2019t you put us both out of our misery and just open it because the suspense is just about set to kill me.\u201d</p><p>Danni knows all about Jordan. How I felt ... still feel about him. You think my feelings for him would have lessened, but they haven\u2019t.</p><p>And now that I\u2019m close to better, I\u2019m finding regret a bitter pill to swallow.</p><p>I miss him so much.</p><p>My trembling fingers run along the line imprint, of what my extensive examination, has figured to be a CD case.</p><p>Why would he send me a CD?</p><p>She reaches over, her slender fingers touch my arm. \u201cOpen it. See what\u2019s in there. It could be a DVD of him telling you how desperate he is to see you.\u201d Her hands clutch her chest in a dramatic manner.</p><p>Danni\u2019s a romantic. Even though she\u2019s been burned in the past, she stills believes in love.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d I shake my head. \u201cWhatever this is \u2013 he sent it over two months ago. A lot can change in that time. He\u2019ll have moved on, I\u2019m sure.\u201d</p><p>She shakes her head. \u201cNo way. Love doesn\u2019t just disappear that quickly, especially not the kind of epic love you both have for each other.\u201d</p><p>I raise my eyebrow. \u201cYou got epic love from what I told you about Jordan and me?\u201d</p><p>She gives me a gnarly look. \u201cWhat he said to you in the hospital, about how he\u2019s in love with you ... guys don\u2019t just say that stuff easily, Mia, not guys like him. Epic, I\u2019m telling you.\u201d</p><p>With a heavy heart, I look back down at the padded envelope in my hands.</p><p>\u201cWhat have you got to lose? Your treatment is almost done. You have a week left. Whatever is in here could determine where you go when you leave here.\u201d</p><p>Nodding, swallowing down my fear, I slide my finger under the seal and tear it open.</p><p>I can almost hear Danni holding her breath as I put my hand inside the envelope.</p><p>My heart is beating a mile a minute.</p><p>I pull out a piece of paper folded in half, and a clear CD case with a disc inside it. On the front of the disc written in black pen is \u2018Mia\u2019.</p><p>I glance up at Danni. \u201cRead it,\u201d she encourages.</p><p>My shaking hands open the letter.</p><p>Mia,</p><p>I\u2019ve tried for four goddamn days to write you a letter ... trying to tell you how I feel about you - how much I fucking miss you. But everything I write just sounds inadequate. All I know is, being away from you ... makes it hard to breathe. I miss you so much.</p><p>So, I\u2019m sending you this song. It says everything I want to and can\u2019t. And if you feel any differently about me ... us, after reading this, then you know where I\u2019ll be.</p><p>I\u2019ll always be waiting for you.</p><p>Jordan</p><p>I wipe the tears from my face.</p><p>\u201cGod, you\u2019re killing me here! What does it say?\u201d Danni looks like she\u2019s about to burst, so I hand the letter to her.</p><p>I watch her eyes scan over the letter. She reaches the bottom and looks up at me. Tears are glistening in her eyes.</p><p>\u201cHoly hell ... that was...\u201d She presses her hand to her chest. \u201cYou have to listen to the song.\u201d She thrusts the case at me.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have a CD player \u2013 just an iPod,\u201d I say defeated.</p><p>Her eyes scan my room. \u201cTelevision!\u201d she exclaims. \u201cIt has a built in DVD player \u2013 you can listen to it through that.\u201d</p><p>My heart lifts. I jump to my feet, taking the disc with me.</p><p>I turn the TV on, and wait for it to come to life. My whole body is trembling.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a genius,\u201d I say to Danni as she comes to stand beside me.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a gift.\u201d She shrugs.</p><p>I take the disc from the case and insert it into the player.</p><p>Waiting for it to load feels like an eternity.</p><p>Then the song Jordan sent me starts to play, and the soft guitar intro to The Scripts \u201cMan Who Can\u2019t Be Moved\u201d fills the room.</p><p>My heart picks up pace, and my eyes close on the lyrics. I absorb them. Hearing exactly what Jordan is trying to tell me.</p><p>\u2018I\u2019ll always be waiting for you\u2019</p><p>He\u2019s waiting for me.</p><p>Danni grabs my hand at my side. I look across at her.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t wait the week. Go to him. Now.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Twenty-Seven</p><p>Jordan</p><p>It\u2019s been three months since she left. Two and a half since I sent the letter and song.</p><p>I haven\u2019t heard from her.</p><p>The song didn\u2019t work.</p><p>It was lame and stupid of me to think it would.</p><p>After waiting a few weeks to hear from her, I accepted she wasn\u2019t coming back ... and then I got pissed.</p><p>I guess it was one of the stages I had to go through. I\u2019d done the depression. It was time for angry, so I went out and got trashed.</p><p>And I hooked up with a random chick.</p><p>Not my finest moment.</p><p>But it only got as far as her hand down my pants, jerking me off before I stopped it, because in that moment I\u2019d realized that I could sleep with this girl, but I\u2019d only feel the same, probably shittier, when I woke up the next morning. I\u2019d still be in the same position. Mia still wouldn\u2019t be here with me. I\u2019d still fucking miss her. I\u2019d still have this gaping hole in my chest that only she can fill. Screwing some random chick wasn\u2019t going to fix that. It wasn\u2019t going to fix me. So I removed her hand from my pants, told her I was sorry, and left.</p><p>Since then, the only action my cock has seen is from my hand.</p><p>I think about Mia. And I don\u2019t mean when I\u2019m jerking off. But while the subject is here, of course I think about her while I date my hand.</p><p>She\u2019s the only thing I think about.</p><p>I figure at some time in the future, I won\u2019t think about her so much. That I\u2019ll eventually get there. Just maybe not right now.</p><p>So I\u2019m keeping busy. I\u2019ve been doing more tours for Wade. The first time I went back up to La Plata Canyon after being there with Mia was hard, but I swallowed past it, and now it\u2019s getting a little easier each time I do a tour up there.</p><p>The hotel is still quiet fairly, but we\u2019re chugging on and I\u2019m working on a website for the hotel, signing up to tourist and travel agent sites, getting our name out there. My mission is to have the hotel busier than it\u2019s ever been by next summer.</p><p>Dozer comes over and plants his face on my legs. \u201cHey, buddy, whatcha up to?\u201d I say, pulling my eyes from the computer to look down at him. He got his cast off a while back, and he is totally back to himself.</p><p>Except he still misses Mia.</p><p>At times, I feel like there\u2019s only him who understands me.</p><p>He nudges my leg with his head, and brings his paw up batting me with it.</p><p>\u201cWhat? You hungry?\u201d I reach onto the desk and grab one of the cookies I was eating.</p><p>I give it to him, and he takes it, laying down to eat it.</p><p>I rub my tired eyes, and look back to the spreadsheet I\u2019m working on. Accounts. Fun times.</p><p>I know it\u2019s bad when it\u2019s a Friday night and even my dad is out on a date, but I\u2019m sitting here with my dog, working the accounts.</p><p>I really need to get a fucking life.</p><p>The hotel phones rings.</p><p>\u201cGolden Oaks,\u201d I say, leaning back in my chair.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re home on a Friday night? You really are turning into a sad case.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Beth. You really know how to boost a guy\u2019s confidence.\u201d</p><p>She laughs. \u201cConfidence is one thing you will never lack in, Jordan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, yeah, whatever. Anyway, you\u2019re giving me grief, but it\u2019s not like you\u2019re out, hitting up the town.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm, working girl here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour mom isn\u2019t paying you enough at the diner, so you\u2019ve had to turn to being a hooker. Sounds like a Lifetime movie in the making\u201d</p><p>\u201cHa. Smart ass. I called because I thought I\u2019d let you know I\u2019m sending a tourist up your way. Thinking I should change my mind, tell her to go somewhere else...\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOkay. I take it back. Only, as long as this tourist isn\u2019t like the last one you sent me. Kinda got my heartbroken the last time you did that.\u201d I try to come off as jokey and light, but it doesn\u2019t work.</p><p>She goes quiet down the line. \u201cNah, this one is different to the last ... I\u2019m sure of it. And she\u2019s not that good-looking. You wouldn\u2019t go for her.\u201d</p><p>I let out a laugh. \u201cOkay. Good to know. Should I take it she\u2019s more of Pine room kind of girl?\u201d Pine is our cheapest room.</p><p>\u201cNah, this one is definitely a Lakeview kind of girl. She might be unfortunate looking, but she\u2019s definitely got good taste.\u201d</p> <p>I swallow down. No one has stayed in there since Mia. I just haven\u2019t been able to bring myself to let anyone sleep in there yet.</p><p>Stupid I know.</p><p>\u201cOkay. Cool. She on her way now? I\u2019ll go get the room ready.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s setting off in a few.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Beth. And I mean that.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI know you do. And thank me later.\u201d</p><p>I hang up and push out the chair. I grab the keys for Lakeview, and head down the hall.</p><p>I switch the light on, avoiding looking anywhere that will remind me of the times I had in here with Mia. I switch the heater on to warm the room for our new guest, turn the bed down, and put fresh towels in the bathroom.</p><p>I turn the light off, lock the door up, and go back to the office.</p><p>Twenty minutes later I hear a car pulling up the gravel. Dozer jumps to his feet, ears pricked, sniffs the air, and he\u2019s out of the office. Guess he\u2019s smelled something he likes.</p><p>I follow to get him back in the office before he scares the living daylights out of our new guest, but I\u2019m too late, and the door opens on the chime. I look up and my heart stops.</p> <p>It actually fucking stops.</p><p>\u201cMia.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m not sure if I say the word, or just breathe it through my aching lungs.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d she says. Her voice sweet and soft ... and painful.</p><p>I feel a surprising jolt of anger toward her.</p><p>Nothing for three fucking months, and she just shows up here unannounced. Screw the fact that I\u2019ve been dreaming about this very thing happening for three months, I\u2019m still fucking pissed. I\u2019m beyond pissed.</p><p>I turn and walk away, putting myself behind the reception desk.</p><p>I need a barrier between us to stop me from doing something stupid. Like getting down to my knees and begging her to take me back.</p> <p>She stays by the door, unsure eyes on me. She looks so tiny and fragile. It makes me want to go to her ... hold her.</p><p>I grip hold of the desk to steady myself.</p><p>Dozer is on her, nudging his head at her leg, desperate for her attention.</p><p>\u201cHey buddy.\u201d Her eyes leave me, and she bends down to stroke him. \u201cLook at your leg, all healed.\u201d</p><p>Yeah, well it has been THREE FUCKING MONTHS!</p><p>She wraps her arms around his neck, hugging him. \u201cI missed you,\u201d she whispers to him.</p><p>She missed him! What the fuck about me?</p><p>I scrub my hands over my face, exhaling through my feelings. \u201cWhy are you here, Mia?\u201d</p><p>She looks up at me, slowly rising to stand. The crestfallen look on her face is like a knife to my chest.</p><p>Her hands are shaking. She wraps her arms around herself.</p><p>\u201cI read your letter, and the song ... I listened to the song. All the way here, in fact,\u201d she adds quietly.</p><p>I cross my arms over my chest. \u201cYou mean the letter I sent two and a half months ago.\u201d</p><p>She bites her lip. \u201cI only read it this morning. I was afraid ... afraid there would be something in it that would bring me back here. And I couldn\u2019t come back then. I had to figure a way to get past everything I was feeling, complete my treatment. In hindsight, I wish I\u2019d read it straight away. But the moment I did ... the moment I heard that song ... I checked out and drove straight here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>She takes a step closer. \u201cBecause ... I hoped you\u2019d still be waiting.\u201d</p><p>I tighten my arms, and my stance. Every muscle in my body locked. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>She closes her eyes. \u201cSo I could tell you the one thing I didn\u2019t when we were at the hospital.\u201d</p><p>I stare at her expectedly.</p><p>\u201cThat I love you ... I\u2019m in love with you, Jordan.\u201d</p><p>She loves me?</p><p>I can\u2019t speak. Or think. Or move.</p><p>You know when you\u2019ve been waiting to hear the one thing from the one person who matters most, and then they say it and it freezes you to the spot with fear.</p><p>Yeah, I\u2019m about there right now.</p><p>The silence between us is blistering with pain and confusion and want.</p><p>Then I find my voice. \u201cSo you came here to tell me you love me?\u201d</p><p>I watch her wipe a tear away with her hand. She nods, tugging on her lower lip, twisting it nervously. \u201cYes. I needed you to know that. And ... also ... to see if you have a room ... for me?\u201d</p><p>And there it is. I should have fucking guessed.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the tourist ... you went to see Beth first?\u201d I don\u2019t know why, but knowing that is really pissing me off.</p><p>Her eyes drift from me. \u201cI got here and I was afraid. I thought maybe you might have changed your mind ... that your feelings for me might have changed after all this time, maybe ... there was someone else...\u201d Her eyes come back to me. \u201cI guess I panicked, so I went to the diner in the hope Beth would be there and I could ask her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what did she tell you?\u201d</p><p>She runs her hands nervously down her clothes. \u201cThat you ... you haven\u2019t moved on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Well, Beth was wrong. I have moved on. Moved on majorly, in fact. And I\u2019m sorry, but you can\u2019t stay here.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t mean it. But I\u2019m hurt and I\u2019m not thinking clearly. And I\u2019m an asshole.</p><p>The pain on her face lances straight through me. Her shoulders pull in as she wraps her arms around her stomach. \u201cOh. Right. Okay. I\u2019m sorry...\u201d A tear runs down her cheek. She swipes it away with her finger. \u201c... I shouldn\u2019t have come.\u201d Then she\u2019s gone, out the door.</p><p>Dozer growls at me, giving me a \u2018you fucking idiot\u2019 look, then he starts pawing and butting his head against the door, trying to get to our girl.</p><p>\u201cI know, I\u2019m a fuckin\u2019 idiot!\u201d I grip my hair, angry with myself. \u201cShit! Motherfucking shit!\u201d I kick the desk. Then without another thought, I\u2019m burning out of the hotel, chasing after her. \u201cMia! Wait!\u201d</p><p>She stops by her car, face away from me, but I don\u2019t stop. I stride right over to her, standing before her, I take her tear streaked face in my hands.</p><p>It hurts so much to know I put those tears there. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t mean that ... I was angry, like three fuckin\u2019 months worth of angry. But I don\u2019t want you to go ... fuck! ... Mia, I just ... I just want you.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes flash up to me with surprise. \u201cYou want me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll always want you.\u201d</p><p>Then I kiss her. I kiss her with three months worth of pain and hurt and want and need.</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d she breathes over my mouth.</p><p>It makes me kiss her harder. My feelings for her consuming me.</p><p>\u201cI love you...\u201d I say, holding her to me. \u201cSo fuckin\u2019 much.\u201d</p><p>She stands on her tiptoes, wraps her arms around my neck, and buries her face in my shoulder. I hold her tight. Afraid to let her go. Afraid to ever let her go again.</p><p>\u201cDoes this mean you have room for me?\u201d she whispers.</p><p>I tilt my head back staring in her eyes. \u201cI think I could make space for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor how long?\u201d</p><p>I shrug. \u201cHow does forever sound?\u201d</p><p>She puts her hand to my face, the smile on her own real, but tentative. \u201cIt sounds too good to be real,\u201d she whispers.</p><p>\u201cOh, it\u2019s real, babe.\u201d I squeeze her ass, lifting her off her feet, loving the feel of her legs as they go around my waist. I turn, walking back to the hotel with her. \u201cAnd it\u2019s gonna be as good as I\u2019m about to make you feel \u2013 this is me we\u2019re talking about here.\u201d I lift an eyebrow.</p><p>Her laughter fills me. Her kiss soothes me.</p><p>And I feel a peace I haven\u2019t felt in months.</p><p>Epilogue</p><p>Mia</p><p>\u201cSo what happened to us going out for dinner?\u201d I trace patterns on Jordan\u2019s bare chest.</p><p>\u201cYou happened. I was just innocently coming out of the bathroom after my shower, all clean and ready to get dressed, and there you were standing by our bed, wearing your new sexy underwear, looking smoking hot, and of course I got hard because ... well, it was you. In underwear. Then we had some seriously fuckin\u2019 awesome sex, babe, and now I\u2019m in post coital bliss with my girl, and moving just isn\u2019t an option.\u201d</p><p>Laughing, I tilt my head up to him, offering my mouth.</p><p>He captures it in a delicious kiss which send shivers right down to my toes.</p><p>\u201cSee, and that\u2019s why moving isn\u2019t an option because I intend on doing this with you for the rest of the night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWorks for me.\u201d I smile, stretching my arms up.</p><p>Jordan slides his fingers around my neck, playing with the locket around it.</p><p>The locket was Anna\u2019s. Jordan gave it to me a few months ago.</p><p>After I came back, Jordan and I spent time getting reacquainted with one another. Then we spent a lot of time talking through the issues that were sitting between us.</p><p>I was no longer in the place where I saw the betrayal of my mother when I looked at him.</p><p>But the fact was still there.</p><p>She had left me behind and raised him.</p><p>When Jordan told me everything about her situation with Oliver, it didn\u2019t make things better, but it gave me a semblance of understanding.</p><p>It\u2019s taken me a long time to process my feelings about my mother, but I\u2019m almost there.</p><p>Pain of the past never goes away, you just find a way to deal with it. And the future ... all the promise it holds ... that\u2019s what keeps you moving forward, and out of the darkness.</p><p>Jordan. He\u2019s my future. My promise. My light.</p><p>He keeps me sane. He keeps me safe.</p><p>When I struggle to breathe, he gives me the air I need.</p><p>Some days are hard. Some days when my mind blackens and all I want to do is hide away and eat and purge. He\u2019s right there with me.</p><p>I\u2019ll always be recovering from bulimia.</p><p>But now those days when I feel the urge for control and the need to hurt my body are few and far between. I can\u2019t even remember the last time I felt that way.</p><p>I\u2019m still seeing a therapist. When I left the center, my doctor there referred me to a therapist here in Durango \u2013 Dr. Peterson. She has been really great and has helped me work on all my issues.</p><p>I still have a long way to go when it comes to dealing with the life I lived with Oliver and Forbes, and the mental scars it left me with, but I\u2019m getting there.</p><p>And I still have Danni. We talk regularly on the phone, and she came to visit a few months ago. She stayed for a week, which was awesome. It was great to have some time with her as I\u2019d really missed her. Jordan took us out on a Jeep tour to the canyon. Beth and Toni came along as well. It was a really great day. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Beth and Toni are still dating. It\u2019s getting pretty serious from what Beth says, and she told me the other day that Toni and her have been discussing moving in together.</p><p>I\u2019m so happy for her. Beth is amazing, and we\u2019ve grown close. It\u2019s great to have a female friend here, especially one as fun and cool as Beth is.</p><p>She takes me out shopping and to the beauty salon. All things friends are supposed to do, but I was never allowed. It\u2019s novel for me, even now. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever take being able to do these things for granted.</p><p>I\u2019ll never take my freedom for granted.</p> <p>And being in the good place that I am now, settled into my new life ... I think that was why Jordan felt I was ready to have my mother\u2019s locket. He was confident it wouldn\u2019t push me back a step. He was feeling my peace. And he was right. I can\u2019t say it was easy to see the locket which Jim had kept of Annabelle\u2019s.</p><p>It had hidden inside of it, a tiny picture of baby me.</p><p>Even though it pained me to see, it also gave me a sense of peace in some way to know that in her own way she had always been thinking of me.</p><p>Would I ever do what she did? No.</p><p>But it\u2019s easier to judge when you\u2019re on the receiving end of the hurt. And I know too well what it\u2019s like to be with a controlling, abusive man.</p> <p>I know what it was like to live with Oliver.</p><p>I sold my apartment in Boston and all the furniture in it. I never went back. Jordan handled it all for me. And I moved into the hotel with Jordan and Jim, and of course Dozer. Too soon, probably, but I spent a long time living unhappily. Jordan is my happy, so I was grabbing it with both hands.</p><p>I invested some of Oliver\u2019s money into the hotel. Both Jim and Jordan protested \u2013 Jordan the loudest. He was having none of it at first, but it was also my mother\u2019s hotel, and now my home.</p><p>I want it to succeed.</p><p>So after a few well timed seductions, I got my own way. Jordan finds it hard to say no to me.</p><p>The hotel is doing amazingly well. Jordan really got the business moving. The website and links he built have helped immensely. Also, he set up a business deal with Wade, and they tied the jeeps tours into the hotel. People can stay at the hotel, and the tours go from here. Using some of the money I put in, Jordan had a garage built to store the jeeps.</p> <p>It\u2019s really helped things. I\u2019m so proud of him.</p><p>I\u2019m proud of me too.</p><p>I left Harvard, but I haven\u2019t left behind medicine completely. I\u2019m just moving in a different direction. I\u2019ve enrolled in Veterinary school to start this term. I\u2019m hoping Dozer will let me practice my examining and bandaging skills on him. I\u2019m sure he will; he\u2019s pretty soft on me as I am him, much to Jordan\u2019s annoyance.</p><p>But school is a little way off starting as it\u2019s summer break, and today is a year to the day since Jordan and I first met.</p><p>We were supposed to be going out to dinner, but that\u2019s off the menu now.</p><p>I have a gift for him that I can\u2019t wait any longer to give to him.</p><p>I start to get out of bed, but Jordan catches my hand. \u201cWhere you going, babe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought as we weren\u2019t going to dinner now ... you might want your gift?\u201d</p> <p>His eyes light up. \u201cWell if you\u2019re giving me mine, then I guess it\u2019s only fair you get yours.\u201d</p><p>My heart does a somersault in my chest. He got me a gift! Not that I thought he wouldn\u2019t. I\u2019ve just never received a gift in this context before \u2013 not one where there\u2019s no pain before it.</p><p>Going to my closet, I get out the envelope containing Jordan\u2019s gift. I put a lot of thought and effort into his gift. I think he\u2019ll like it ... I think ... I\u2019m not sure.</p><p>Shit, I\u2019m so nervous! I\u2019ve never given anyone a gift like this before.</p><p>I meet him back on the bed. We sit facing each other. I keep the envelope containing Jordan\u2019s present behind my back.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s going first?\u201d he asks, looking excited, like a little kid on his birthday.</p><p>I\u2019m excited too. Trembling with it.</p><p>\u201cWe could open together. Or you first. Or me,\u201d I say.</p><p>He raises his eyebrow.</p><p>\u201cWhat? I\u2019m just excited!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot together,\u201d he says. \u201c\u2019Cause I want to see the look on your face when you open mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. You go first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure.\u201d</p><p>My nervous, trembling hand brings the envelope around to give to him.</p><p>His eyes meet mine, a puzzled look in them. Then he takes it from me, and tears the envelope open. Hand in, he pulls the papers out.</p><p>I watch his eyes reading over it, then widening as he takes the details in.</p><p>His eyes lift to mine. Awe and love in them. It squeezes my heart. \u201cDid you really do this?\u201d</p><p>I nod. \u201cNot on my own though, the agent helped me ... is it too much?\u201d</p><p>His eyes go down to the papers, then lift back to mine. Now they\u2019re glistening, and I can feel my own welling up. \u201cNo ... it\u2019s just ... fuckin\u2019 amazing, babe ... I can\u2019t believe you did this.\u201d</p><p>I tug on my lip. \u201cI was thinking of what to get you, and I remembered how you sounded that day when you said you\u2019d never go traveling again. The sadness in your voice. I didn\u2019t want that to be the case. I know how much you love traveling ... seeing the world, so I thought I\u2019d finish off the trip you started with your friends.\u201d</p><p>The gift I bought Jordan was the rest of the trip he never got to finish when Anna got sick.</p><p>I bought a three week vacation, leaving in a week, taking us to India, then Nepal, onto Hong Kong, then Shanghai, and ending in Japan.</p><p>It\u2019s a gift for me too as I\u2019ve never travelled before. And who better to break that virginity with than Jordan?</p><p>His face breaks into a grin. \u201cLooks like we\u2019re on the same page with our gifts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>He pulls out an envelope, similar to mine from behind his back. \u201cOpen it.\u201d He smiles, handing it to me.</p><p>I tear the envelope open, and pull out the contents.</p><p>Holy shit!</p><p>\u201cA trip to Paris at Christmas!\u201d I yell, then cover my mouth with my hand.</p><p>He chuckles. \u201cI knew you\u2019d never left the country before, and I\u2019ve never been to Europe, so I thought we could go over for Christmas. Looks like we\u2019re gonna accrue some serious air miles this year.\u201d He grins.</p><p>I launch myself at him, kissing him deeply. He takes us down to the bed, rolling me underneath him.</p><p>His hand slides down my thigh, cupping my butt, covering my scars, holding me. \u201cLove you, babe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you too.\u201d</p><p>I came here to Colorado, looking for my mother, trying so hard to escape my past. Trying to find a purpose, a reason to live.</p><p>I might not have found my mother in the way I\u2019d first hoped, but instead I found so much more.</p><p>I found something I\u2019ve never before had\u2014never dreamed I would have ... a real family.</p><p>Jordan, Jim, Beth and Dozer.</p><p>But best of all ... I got love.</p><p>Not love under fear or condition. Not love that comes with a price. I got real, honest to god love in all its purest forms.</p><p>Family love. Friend love. Unconditional love. And the best love of all...</p><p>Jordan.</p><p>He gave me the one thing he\u2019s never given to anyone before.</p><p>He gave me his heart, and his trust.</p><p>And in return, I gave him the same right back.</p><p>The End </p> </body></html>"]
