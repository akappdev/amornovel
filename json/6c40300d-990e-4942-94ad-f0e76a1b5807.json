While she waits she crooks a finger and bends toward me at such at angle that her ample cle**age spills out. My eyes naturally fall to it, but I quickly force them away when the bartender\u2019s voice booms over to us loudly.</p><p>\u201cLucy, gin or vodka in the martini?\u201d he asks her sternly.</p> <p>\u201cVodka.\u201d But she doesn\u2019t let her gaze wander and crooks her finger at me yet again.</p><p>\u201cRumor has it that management is looking to open a museum,\u201d she whispers in my ear.</p><p>I straighten and lift an eyebrow. \u201cInteresting way to go about filling it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re even willing to give recognition to anyone who returns the items.\u201d</p><p>I raise my glass. \u201cI\u2019ll keep that in mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can show you what they\u2019ve collected so far if you\u2019re interested. I have time to take a break before dinner is served.\u201d</p><p>Her body language and the seductive tone of her voice tell me she\u2019s offering more than a quick glance in a closet. I admit to contemplating the offer. The devil on my shoulder reminds me what a bittersweet day today is and that getting lost for a while doesn\u2019t sound so bad. But another, stronger, voice declares that the days of needing to get lost in women are long behind me.</p><p>My foot taps the stool rung at an increasing speed. \u201cMaybe another time,\u201d I tell her as nicely as I can manage, with a mental pat on the back.</p> <p>A year ago I would have taken her up on her offer, unzipped my pants, lifted her skirt, and f**ked her from behind without even thinking twice about it. She shrugs and bats her eyelashes at me as she puts her drink order on a tray. When she leaves she turns and winks, tossing over her shoulder, \u201cI\u2019ll be back. Maybe you\u2019ll change your mind.\u201d</p><p>What is she, the f**king Terminator? I loosen my bow tie, not able to stand another minute of restraint. And once I can breathe, I blink away any second thoughts. At the sound of a soft sigh coming from the bartender, I lift my eyes toward him. He looks forlorn and so I\u2019m pretty sure he\u2019s crushing on the cocktail waitress.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s never asked me to see the items in storage,\u201d he mumbles.</p><p>\u201cTake the lead, man, and ask her.\u201d</p><p>He seems to contemplate the idea.</p><p>Leaving him to ponder my suggestion, I turn around and lean against the brass rail to survey the room. Legend has it that the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences was founded here, that World War II military men used it as their recreation facility, and that John F. Kennedy\u2019s nomination for president happened in this very space. The historic Biltmore Hotel has served great people who have done amazing things. And I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m here.</p><p>Turning back around, I sip the rest of my sparkling water and push the glass toward the bartender. \u201cThanks, man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnytime, and, sir . . .\u201d</p><p>I look over toward him.</p><p>\u201cCongratulations,\u201d he says.</p><p>\u201cThank you. And hey, think about what I said\u2014take the lead.\u201d</p><p>He laughs before resuming his work. When he steps aside I catch sight of myself in the mirror behind the bar. For a minute I can\u2019t help thinking about how damn lucky I am to have gotten a second chance at life. I was a dead man, a man who then lost sight of what mattered and then fell over the edge. But somehow after everything I went through, I was tugged back up by life and able to land on my feet.</p><p>A beep from my phone alerts me I have a text. I pull it out and smile at the screen\u2014Dahlia London. I know her name is Dahlia Wilde now, but to me she\u2019ll always be Dahlia London\u2014the beautiful blond-haired girl with the tiniest of noses, heart-shaped lips, and a love of the beach that could only be matched by mine. She moved in next door when we were five and we spent our whole lives together. For the longest time I thought she was the one made for me. I even asked her to marry me. But then after things in my job went wrong, I entered the witness protection program . . . leaving her to think I was dead. When I came back years later, she was in love with someone else.</p><p>Time made me realize our love was one of comfort and familiarity, not true undying love. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve experienced the latter, but I see it in her eyes. Sure, I struggled for a while before coming to terms with the fact that she has moved on, but we\u2019re in a good place now.</p><p>I read her text.</p><p>I just wanted to say congratulations and I was thinking of you today.</p><p>With a smile, I type out my reply,</p><p>Thank you. That means a lot to me.</p><p>Switching my phone to vibrate, I slide it back in my pocket. She\u2019ll always be important to me and I hope she\u2019ll always be in my life, as a friend.</p><p>A hand on my shoulder pulls me from my thoughts. \u201cYou ready for this?\u201d</p><p>I glance over. \u201cCouldn\u2019t be readier.\u201d</p><p>Then Jason makes his way to the front of the room and his husky voice is amplified to fill the space. \u201cI\u2019d like to have everyone\u2019s attention if I could please.\u201d</p><p>The room becomes eerily silent and my nerves start to buzz.</p><p>He clears his throat. \u201cI\u2019m honored to be here today to present this award. For those of you who don\u2019t know who I am, I\u2019m Jason Holt, commander of an FBI special task force, and I am honored to be here tonight to present to you a man I know well\u2014Ben Covington, California\u2019s Journalist of the Year.\u201d</p><p>The words of his introduction echo off the walls in the legendary Crystal Ballroom at the historic downtown Los Angeles hotel and it seems a little surreal. There\u2019s a round of applause as I cross toward the stairs with years of reflection sweeping through my mind. When I finally reach the stage, I take the steps two at a time and stride across it heading toward my ex-brother-in-law. His eyes lock on mine and then he extends his arm, handing me the glass typewriter award, and suddenly everything feels so . . . real. With a handshake and a nod, he clears the stage and I\u2019m left standing at the podium alone. It\u2019s shorter than I had expected, and as I set the award on its shelf, I scan the room.</p><p>My eyes come to rest on the table before me. The circle of people sitting there are the ones who brought me home\u2014not in the physical sense, but emotionally speaking. Serena, my sister, is seated front and center. Trent, my nephew, is at her side. Caleb Holt, my best friend for as long as I can remember, sits beside him. Then Kale Alexander, the mate I met in Australia who helped remind me of my love for writing. Beck Cavanaugh, who not only pulled me up from the darkness, but also shook me until I could see through it, is seated beside him. And finally closing the circle, Jason takes a seat beside his ex-wife, the same beautiful woman who is also my sister.</p><p>I clear my throat and begin. \u201cIn the movie Citizen Kane a reporter said, \u2018I don\u2019t think there\u2019s one word that can describe a man\u2019s life.\u2019\u201d</p><p>Lifting my eyes to the nods of people in the audience agreeing with me, I adjust the microphone and my voice grows stronger. \u201cI\u2019m sorry to say I don\u2019t entirely agree with that statement.\u201d</p><p>Nameless faces in the crowd furrow their brows, purse their lips, and stare at me. \u201cRosebud was the last word Charles Foster Kane muttered just before he died. In the movie a journalist tries to decipher what the millionaire newspaper tycoon meant. But in the end he gives up on his investigation and summarizes it by saying, \u2018Mr. Kane was a man who got everything he wanted and then lost it. Maybe Rosebud was something he couldn\u2019t get or something he lost. Anyway, it wouldn\u2019t have explained anything . . . I don\u2019t think any one word can explain a man\u2019s life. No, I guess Rosebud is just a piece in a jigsaw puzzle . . . a missing piece.\u2019\u201d</p><p>Long, rectangular white linen-draped tables outline the elegant ballroom with larger round ones filling its center. Journalists from all around the state occupy the many seats. Taking deep calming breaths, I continue. \u201cAnd as we all know, in the end of the movie it is revealed to the audience that Rosebud was the name of the sled from Kane\u2019s childhood\u2014it was a reference to the only time in his life that he was really happy. At the end of the movie we\u2019re left with the image of the sled being burned in the furnace because people thought it was just a piece of junk lying around.\u201d</p><p>Food is being ushered out to the tables around the perimeter of the room and I know my time is running short. With sweaty palms, I grip the wooden sides of the stand and try to clarify what I mean. \u201cI\u2019ve spent the past year thinking, what is my Rosebud? And although I agree one word cannot describe your whole life, I do think one word can describe your life in the here and now. I think that word will change throughout your life, but the important thing is not to dismiss what it represents. Don\u2019t let life pass you by.\u201d</p><p>Against the white backdrop of the walls and the golden reflection from the chandeliers above, a vibrant flash of red movement toward the back of the room demands my attention. But then again I always notice women with red hair. I squint, trying to see past the shadows of the bright lights. Suddenly my world stops and I hope I don\u2019t gasp out loud in the wake of all the air leaving my lungs. Is it really her?</p><p>My heart races and time stops as lust explodes within me. Red hair flows past her shoulders, and a tight green dress hugs her sexy body perfectly. I\u2019d know her natural beauty anywhere\u2014that knockout figure that is sexy as hell. No matter how hard I have tried, I could never seem to forget the way her body felt pressed up against mine.</p><p>I don\u2019t even have to see those otherworldly emerald eyes to know it\u2019s her, I can tell by the way she moves. She\u2019s S\u2019belle Wilde. We shared only one unbelievable night together, but it\u2019s seared in my mind forever.</p><p>Wetting my lips, willing my heart to beat at a normal pace, I try to bring my thoughts back to why I\u2019m here. But I\u2019m having a hard time tearing my eyes from her\u2014I\u2019m drawn to her. I begrudgingly force my mouth to recite the rest of my speech. And even though the words that I\u2019ve rehearsed flow out easily, I can\u2019t focus on them at all. My thoughts are locked on her.</p><p>I remember the night we shared together so long ago and how she rocked my world. I remember how we reconnected this past summer and how I screwed everything up by acting inappropriately with our mutual client. I remember it all as it flashes through my mind\u2014the good and the bad, the hot and the cold. And I remember how much I craved her then, and I can\u2019t deny that I still do.</p><p>When I pause for a moment I\u2019m momentarily distracted by the way she cocks her hip when she gives orders to the waitstaff. She marches to another table in those high heels, and my eyes sweep her body, from the curve of her hips, to the fullness of her br**sts, to the pout of her mouth. With a pencil tucked behind her ear, she pauses, biting her lip as if assessing the position of everything on the table with a precision that is sexy as f**k. I suck in a breath and refocus on why I\u2019m standing up here. \u201cSorry about that. I have to say I\u2019m a little nervous. . . .\u201d</p><p>I glance across the many faces in the audience as the words spill from my mouth and my gaze locks on hers. Her lips tip down into a frown when she notices my stare and she hastily averts her attention. Good. At least I can focus again. I continue, but I can\u2019t stop constantly canvassing the space around me for her position. When I spot her directing those around her at the carving station, my pulse thunders at the sight. I shift my gaze to follow her and notice some of the women in the audience dabbing their eyes with napkins. I can only assume my heartfelt words have moved them. When I notice S\u2019belle pick up one of the black linen pieces of cloth and do the same, it takes my breath away. Not only does she seem to be impacted by my presence, but f**k me if she isn\u2019t wearing my watch, the one I left for her this summer after she told me hers had broken. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>As I finish my speech, a strange feeling runs through me. I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s finality, closure, hope, or a sense of new beginnings, but whatever it is\u2014I\u2019ll take it. It beats the despair and isolation that have kept me company for the past year. I raise the glass typewriter in the air. \u201cI leave you all with these final thoughts. . . .\u201d</p><p>My last words come out softer as the syllables catch in my throat. Applause reverberates through the grand ballroom and I close my eyes for a few moments, absorbing everything. When I open them a grin crosses my lips. But my smile isn\u2019t for the strangers who surround me or even for my friends before me. It\u2019s for the redheaded girl in the back of the room whose gaze keeps flickering over mine.</p><p>Exiting the stage, I keep my eyes locked on hers and can\u2019t help noticing that hers are locked on mine . . . blue to green, a reflection from so long ago, but a memory I\u2019ve never forgotten. However, I can\u2019t read her. Each glance tells a different story. She seems to be shifting between emotions. Like to hate, disgust to admiration. She\u2019s a blend of confusion that echoes my own feelings. I\u2019m pulled from my thoughts as I approach the table and my sister rushes toward me.</p><p>\u201cOh, Ben, I\u2019m so proud of you. I wish Mom were here to see you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah, me too,\u201d I say as I hug her. Again my words catch in my throat.</p><p>\u201cMom, don\u2019t cry,\u201d Trent calls over my shoulder.</p><p>I grab his head in a vise lock. \u201cGlad you made it home, kid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t f**king miss this for the world.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBetter lie low on the swearing or your mother will use the liquid soap in the restroom to wash out your mouth.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, I will,\u201d she adds.</p><p>I swing my arms around them both. \u201cHow do you hear everything?\u201d I ask her as we approach the table.</p><p>\u201cSuperpowers.\u201d</p><p>And I think, Oh yeah, just like our mom.</p><p>Caleb extends his hand and pulls me toward him. With his hand slapping my back, he doesn\u2019t say a word, but I can feel what he feels. We had ridden this roller-coaster ride together. Both of our lives had changed once I started my investigation. I may have been the one who had to give up his identity, but a part of him was buried alongside me for those years. We both felt guilt, remorse, sorrow, but now was a time for celebration.</p><p>I push him away. \u201cIf you cop a feel I\u2019m going to have to deck you.\u201d</p> <p>His grin broadens. \u201cI\u2019ll try to control myself.\u201d</p><p>On a serious note I say, \u201cThanks for everything.\u201d</p><p>His eyes dart to mine and I see the lump in his throat. \u201cWhat are you drinking? I\u2019ll grab another round,\u201d he says.</p><p>\u201cSparkling water.\u201d</p><p>He rolls his eyes.</p><p>\u201cI need to keep my senses around you. Wouldn\u2019t want you taking advantage,\u201d I joke.</p><p>Caleb hasn\u2019t been around much the past year. He hadn\u2019t seen how I let alcohol consume me. Let it erase the memories that were just too hard to bear. I don\u2019t consider myself an alcoholic, but I know I function much better when I stay away from it.</p><p>Kale and Beck are deep in conversation when I squat between them. \u201cWhat am I missing that\u2019s so important I didn\u2019t even get a congratulations?\u201d</p> <p>Kale\u2019s eyes take on a glimmer. \u201cBeck here is telling me about . . .\u201d</p><p>My attention wavers the minute I see her again. She pulls her mass of hair back and bends down to examine one of the dishes being set out. When she straightens she catches me staring. We\u2019re close enough that I know she sees it when I smile suggestively, but she quickly cuts her eyes elsewhere. I narrow in on the vision before me. I can see her flawless skin left uncovered by her sleeveless dress. I notice the way her neck and arm flow into a sea of glimmer from the sparkling lights above. I imagine grabbing her, pulling her to me, and bending to nip the smooth hollow where her neck and shoulder meet. She looks back at me and this time a slight smile crosses her lips. I\u2019ll be damned if it doesn\u2019t light up the whole f**king room.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t go there, man,\u201d Caleb\u2019s voice warns.</p><p>\u201cHmm?\u201d I turn to look at him.</p><p>\u201cHere\u2019s your drink.\u201d</p><p>Turning back toward Beck and Kale, I clasp Kale\u2019s shoulder. \u201cGreat work. Stop in my office Monday. I want to hear all about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see the way you\u2019re looking at her.\u201d Caleb won\u2019t drop it.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not looking at her in any way,\u201d I deny.</p><p>\u201cThe f**k you\u2019re not. You\u2019re practically licking her off the rim of that glass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about.\u201d</p><p>His hard glare cuts across the room to where she stands. \u201cYeah, I think I do. Just remember she\u2019s forbidden fruit. Leave well enough alone. You\u2019re in a good place right now\u2014you don\u2019t need to go down that road.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hear you.\u201d</p><p>He looks at me skeptically.</p><p>Glass in hand, I sip my drink and crunch on one of the ice cubes, thinking past wrongs and forbidden fruit\u2014none of that matters when I remember the night we shared. I also know that my insides hum with every move she makes. But I don\u2019t say anything else to Caleb, because he\u2019s right; going down that road won\u2019t lead to any place I need to go.</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>The night passes quickly with so many conversations with people I\u2019ve never met. Beck left to pick his girlfriend, Ruby, up from work, and Kale followed him out, discussing whatever they are working on. Caleb was taking a red-eye back to wherever it is he goes, but said he\u2019ll be back next month. And per his advice, I\u2019ve gone out of my way to avoid S\u2019belle, but it\u2019s killing me to do it. I know there\u2019s a huge chance she wouldn\u2019t talk to me anyway after what happened this summer, but I also think there\u2019s a chance she would and with Caleb\u2019s words echoing in my ears, I\u2019m not sure I should go there.</p><p>When my phone rings with a call from Aerie Daniels, I take the opportunity to slip away from the crowd. \u201cHello.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi, Ben. It\u2019s Aerie.\u201d</p><p>I open a door marked EXIT and end up in a quiet service hallway. With no one around I lean against the cool stainless wall behind me.</p><p>\u201cHey. Everything okay?\u201d I ask.</p><p>Not only is Aerie my ex-fianc\u00e9e\u2019s best friend but she also works for me.</p><p>\u201cI just wanted to apologize for not being there tonight. I\u2019m leaving in the morning for that quick trip to New York City I told you about and thought I should get everything together for the November issue and go through it one last time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAerie, it\u2019s going to be fine. Don\u2019t stress about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure you don\u2019t need me to stay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure. Stop stressing. It\u2019s all set and there\u2019s nothing to worry about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. It\u2019s just I\u2019ve never been out of the office on trigger day. My plane lands first thing in the morning, so if anything\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s bring out the desserts all at once.\u201d</p><p>I hear a familiar sound\u2014soft and sexy\u2014nearby. Jerking my head to the right, I greedily take S\u2019belle in. The way her body moves with each movement, I can\u2019t suppress the memories that always surface when I see her. I remember everything about that night. Her perky tits that hardened the minute I caressed them, the way her mouth opened and her eyes closed when I touched her in the most intimate places, the feel of her hands seductively sliding over my body, the way she smelled, the raspy tone of her voice when she pleaded for more. My head begins to spin with fresh justification about why it\u2019s okay to just talk to her. She exits the small space quickly, though, through the next set of doors, and again the hall is quiet once more.</p><p>\u201cYou there?\u201d Aerie\u2019s voice calls through the phone.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here.\u201d I manage to make my own voice sound normal.</p><p>\u201cOkay, then. I\u2019ll check in when we land.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds like a plan. And, Aerie, for f**k\u2019s sake, have fun.\u201d</p><p>She responds with a laugh, \u201cLanguage, Ben, language,\u201d and then she hangs up.</p><p>I shake my head and shove my phone in my pocket. Just as I\u2019m about halfway to the door, it swings open again.</p><p>\u201cBen,\u201d she greets me in a velvety soft voice.</p><p>I can\u2019t even tell whether I\u2019m more startled or happy to see her there. But when a flush runs up her neck and her breathing steadily picks up, I want to think she\u2019s as impacted by my presence as I am by hers. Her reaction surprises me, but I\u2019m even more surprised to see warmth in her gaze. My eyes drink her in with a thirst\u2014her hot body, her beautiful stare. My nose catches a faint whiff of her lemony scent. She smells amazing and I almost spasm on the spot. Just as I open my mouth to speak, the door opens again.</p><p>\u201cDid you find the serving spoons?\u201d a guy much too young to be in charge asks.</p><p>\u201cGrabbing them now,\u201d she answers, chewing on her lip before moving across the hall to the counter and picking up a handful of silver ladles.</p><p>He holds the door open for her and she glances at me one last time before walking toward him. And as I watch her, the way her body moves with ease as she leaves, I can\u2019t help thinking back to that night so long ago. The fantasy come to life that I\u2019ve never been able to forget.</p><p>I filled my hands with her beautiful br**sts as I slammed into her from behind. Moans of passion that I weren\u2019t sure if they were hers or mine. My body shaking, hers quivering. I had been drunk, but I felt completely sober when my hands roamed her body and my lips followed. Her pu**y was so sweet and I wanted more. Without any inhibitions, a string of my deepest darkest sexual desires left my mouth. I saw her smile at my words. She whispered how she wanted to answer them. And as I stood, I grabbed her neck and brought her mouth to mine. I felt my dick throb and I wanted more.</p><p>The way I felt when I was inside her was unlike anything I had ever experienced. But I force myself to blink the thought away. It\u2019s not how I should be thinking. But f**k, seeing her again makes me horny as hell and makes me think about things I know I shouldn\u2019t.</p><p>As I head back to the party, I tell myself that I need to leave the past in the past. But the words just don\u2019t feel right.</p><p>CHAPTER 2</p><p>Past Lives</p><p>Bell</p><p>At first glance he had me aching for him. Just one word from him and I was purring. He exuded passion\u2014I felt it the first time he touched me. If you met him, he would make you feel the same way too. I promise. Charming, elusive, full of sex appeal\u2014nothing has changed. One look from Ben Covington and I know what he wants, and it\u2019s not as though I don\u2019t want the same thing too. But I also know all too well the pleasure I would feel would only be followed by a stabbing pain in my heart. That\u2019s just the way it is with him. The only way it can be after everything we\u2019ve been through.</p><p>I try to shake the memories he evokes, but they won\u2019t budge. They just keep rushing back, flooding me further with want and need. I can\u2019t help remembering how he made me feel. How I thought I ruled the world. How I even thought I had a superpower. It wasn\u2019t as glamorous as Emma Frost\u2019s telepathic manifestation or Wonder Woman\u2019s ability to fly, but it was cool nonetheless. My superpower was that I had a way with words. Somehow my uncanny ability allowed me to talk myself into or out of just about anything\u2014an extension on a late paper, a citation for illegally parking, admission into a sold-out club\u2014it didn\u2019t really matter what it was; if I wanted it I got it.</p><p>But I cursed that ability after the night I spent with him. Cursed him for everything, but especially for leaving an impact on my soul that felt as if it would last forever. Yet on seeing him tonight, hearing his moving speech, the feelings tumble through me as I set up the dessert table, making me question everything. I\u2019m beginning to think I was wrong. Maybe wiggling my way into the fraternity party as a makeshift sorority sister and then into his bed wasn\u2019t actually a curse. But if it wasn\u2019t, then what was it? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>\u201cBonjour!\u201d I said to the girl with a name tag that read Claire pinned to her white lace blouse.</p><p>Medium-brown hair tumbled to her shoulders in smooth waves and was held back by a black ribbon headband. She wore a very short plaid skirt with red tights and ankle boots. Flawless and polished, she was perfectly put together. I had to blink twice because she looked so much like the character Blair Waldorf from Gossip Girl. She stood with a huge grin on her face behind a pink-draped table with a golden triangle and the letter Z emblazoned across it in the student center at the University of Southern California. It had only been two weeks since I traded in the City of Lights for the City of Angels. The night was cool, but since the rain had let up I had decided to get out and stop by the recruitment fair. Clubs, fraternities, and sororities populated the room. With so many choices, I had no idea which booth to visit first. I stood back and watched and it was Claire\u2019s enthusiasm that caught my attention. So I moved closer and stood in line as she talked to a group of girls about joining her sorority. They giggled and jumped up and down when she gave them a piece of paper with an address on it and told them she\u2019d meet them there.</p><p>Her gaze lifted at my greeting and she quirked a smile. With a gleam in her eye she said, \u201cHi. Are you from France?\u201d</p> <p>I gave a slight laugh. \u201cNo, California but I spent my freshman year in Paris.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh . . . you\u2019re new. I am too. I just transferred in from New York University.\u201d</p><p>I felt a spark of excitement. \u201cAre you a sophomore?\u201d</p><p>She straightened her shoulders. \u201cNo, actually I\u2019m a junior.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHas anyone ever told you that you look like a character from Gossip Girl?\u201d</p> <p>Her smile grew bright. \u201cAll the time and I love to hear it. She\u2019s my idol. I fashion my wardrobe after her.\u201d</p><p>I nodded. Not certain of what to add to that, I quickly glanced down at the table of pamphlets and asked, \u201cSo, you were in a sorority at NYU?\u201d</p><p>I was somewhat curious only because she was obviously the quintessential prep school girl turned college sorority member. I knew them well. I had gone to a prep school and I was sure all the girls I graduated with had joined sororities. But for me, the preppy schoolgirl look was never my thing. I liked to think my look was more Kate Moss. I mixed fashion-forward clothing with vintage. I wasn\u2019t afraid to throw any two pieces together and put my own spin on an outfit. My mother liked my edgy wardrobe but warned me to avoid anything too revealing. That made me laugh because guys never looked at me that way anyway. I was always just the cute little sister.</p><p>\u201cHow did you know? Delta Zeta!\u201d She beamed with pride, pointing to the flattering propaganda spread out in front of her.</p><p>I bit my lip. I had considered joining a sorority for the sheer purpose of making friends, but I wasn\u2019t certain if I had the time with my heavy course load.</p><p>She must have noticed my eyes flicker in contemplation because she asked, \u201cYou are a PNM, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cA PNM?\u201d I questioned.</p><p>\u201cA potential new member,\u201d she clarified, leaning closer to me.</p><p>I shrugged. \u201cWell, yes. I guess I am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat,\u201d she said, assessing my outfit\u2014a short cropped jacket, skinny jeans, low-heeled boots, and my grandmother\u2019s always-present layered gold necklaces.</p><p>\u201cWhat does a PNM have to do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDepends on what you can offer and who you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m new, so I haven\u2019t met very many people.\u201d</p><p>She frowned as if reconsidering if she should have asked me.</p> <p>Not wanting to feel rejected, I threw out, \u201cBut I have a brother in a band and another brother who\u2019s a graduate student here.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes twinkled with excitement. \u201cAre they hot?\u201d</p><p>I shrugged again. \u201cI guess so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you\u2019re a PNM.\u201d</p><p>I clasped my hands together in excitement at having a title and making a new girlfriend.</p><p>\u201cWe need little sisters to help at the Kappa Sigma\u2019s Pledge Night tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not really a little sister, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m giving you temporary membership. Raise your right hand and repeat after me to accept and we can move on to the hazing,\u201d she said in a serious tone.</p><p>My mouth dropped open.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m only kidding.\u201d</p><p>Not quite sure I believed her, I did as she instructed, trying to recall movies I had watched with sororities, but my mind went blank. I finished repeating the words.</p><p>She skipped around the table. \u201cDone!\u201d</p><p>I felt nervous and excited at the same time.</p><p>She grabbed her materials up off the flat surface. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>I patted my hair. \u201cNow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Inspiration period is about to begin.\u201d</p><p>I slanted her a questioning look.</p><p>\u201cHell week,\u201d she mumbled.</p><p>\u201cOh, but I\u2019m not sure I . . .\u201d</p><p>She put her hand up and ignored my concerns as she filled her purse with the brochures and swung it over her shoulder. \u201cBut first you need to change your outfit. Come with me; you look close to my size.\u201d</p><p>She took me to her dorm room, gave me a change of clothes, and we were off. It was dark and streetlights lit our way. The shoes she had me change into weren\u2019t exactly made for walking long distances. I wore heels all the time, but those must have been five or six inches high. My hair blew in my eyes and I pushed it behind my ears. Claire had tried to tame it, but it was still a frizzy mess.</p><p>\u201cWhat am I supposed to do tonight?\u201d I asked, trying to keep up with her pace.</p><p>She rolled some lipstick on her lips and smacked them. \u201cBe bitchy and nice, ugly and pretty, stupid and smart, innocent and slutty, blond or brunette.\u201d</p><p>I looked at her in confusion.</p><p>She laughed. \u201cIt\u2019s easy. You just tend to one of the fraternity brothers\u2019 needs.\u201d With a silver tube in one hand she air-quoted the word needs.</p><p>I wasn\u2019t quite sure what she meant, but I suddenly felt like a call girl in her short skirt and tight top and I started to think twice about going. My stomach lurched. I wasn\u2019t really a partyer. I\u2019d lived with my aunt in Paris and didn\u2019t often participate in the college extracurricular activities. I always had tons of guys who were friends and I called them boyfriends, but I don\u2019t think I ever had one in the true sense of the meaning. Girlfriends, on the other hand, those were harder to make and I wondered if I was a bit too quirky for most girls\u2019 liking. But since Claire had brought me under her wing, I didn\u2019t want to blow my opportunity.</p><p>\u201cNe . . . needs?\u201d I stuttered.</p><p>She peered at herself in a compact mirror. \u201cYou be whatever he wants you to be. You know, make sure his cup is full, flirt with him, tell him what he wants to hear. Make yourself his dream girl for the night. But never, ever let him know it\u2019s your job. It should seem natural and real\u2014like you really like him.\u201d</p><p>I stumbled on a crack in the sidewalk.</p><p>She looked over at me. \u201cYou can do that, can\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d I swallowed, thinking maybe my silver tongue had gotten me in over my head this time, but then I thought no, I had read many books where girls molded themselves to be what the guy wanted and ended up liking who she became. With that thought I knew I could be the kind of girl she was talking about\u2014strong and confident in her sexual prowess. I could be just like one of the heroines of my romance novels.</p><p>\u201cGreat! Just relax. Enjoy the free booze and man candy. I promise it\u2019ll be fun.\u201d</p><p>I bit my lip, hoping my brother Xander wouldn\u2019t be there. He\u2019d kill me not only for not telling him where I was going or for what I was wearing, but more so for what I was going to be doing.</p><p>She pushed her boobs up. \u201cOh, and if he wants a bl*w j*b, make sure you give him one.\u201d</p><p>My eyes widened and my mouth fell open.</p><p>\u201cOnly kidding. But you should have seen what I had to do!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I asked, once again stifling the urge to turn back around.</p><p>\u201cI was forced to dance on tables for all the fraternities on campus to absurdly sexual songs.\u201d</p><p>Oh God, I thought.</p><p>\u201cSo, tell me about that brother of yours that\u2019s in the band.\u201d</p><p>I couldn\u2019t look at her. I was still trying to process what I had gotten myself into. I finally took a deep breath and said, \u201cHis name is River and he\u2019s coming to visit in a few weeks. His band is actually going to play on campus.\u201d</p><p>She tossed her hair over her shoulder. \u201cOh, I love rock stars. You have to introduce me to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm . . . sure, I can do that.\u201d But I already knew she wasn\u2019t his type.</p><p>\u201cDoes he have a girlfriend?\u201d</p><p>I laughed. \u201cNo, he says he doesn\u2019t do girlfriends.\u201d And I air-quoted my last word as she had earlier.</p><p>\u201cHe sounds dreamy,\u201d she said.</p><p>Again I cursed my silver tongue.</p><p>When she opened the door to the frat house, all I could do was stare. People were everywhere. Music played loudly from the speakers in every corner, silver kegs lined one wall, and large plastic bowls overflowed with food on the tables. She led the way and when she stopped abruptly, I ran right into her.</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d I hollered over the pulsing music.</p><p>She ignored me and moved forward, but I stood glued to the spot I had stopped in. My pulse was racing. My cheeks prickled with heat. There he stood, Ben Covington, just a few feet away\u2014tall, beautiful, messy blond hair, a body that made mine tingle everywhere, and a smile that caused me to melt without even knowing why it formed on his lips.</p><p>Claire doubled back. She noticed my stare.</p><p>\u201cCan I be assigned to him?\u201d I pointed, my stomach fluttering.</p><p>She made a low dismissive noise. Waving her hand, she said, \u201cHe has a girlfriend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you don\u2019t assign guys with girlfriends?\u201d I asked a little too sharply.</p><p>She raised an eyebrow. \u201cSure, he\u2019s all yours. But you should know he never really pays attention to any of us.\u201d</p><p>I shrugged and resumed my staring.</p><p>She shook her head at me. \u201cI have to say you really are a strange one.\u201d</p><p>Lightly laughing at her comment and trying not to take offense, I kept my eyes glued on him. He was across the room talking to some younger guy rather animatedly, and when he stretched out his hand with a red Solo cup in it, I straightened my shoulders. \u201cI\u2019m off.\u201d</p><p>She pursed her lips and grabbed my arm. \u201cDo you want any pointers?\u201d</p><p>Knowing I must seem like a contradiction, I met her eyes. \u201cI got this, Claire.\u201d</p><p>She grabbed my elbow as I started to walk toward him.</p><p>I twisted to look at her.</p><p>\u201cHoney, my name is Stacy. Claire is my dream girl name. What\u2019s your name, by the way?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBell Wilde.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I like it. Is that your dream girl or real name?\u201d</p><p>I gave her a blank look. \u201cReal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what\u2019s your dream girl name?\u201d</p><p>A smile crossed my lips as I looked over to the guy who had captured my attention since I first saw him just a few weeks ago. Xander had taken me to a frat party but made me leave when he saw me drinking a beer and staring at Ben. The guy across the room was also the same guy I had been obsessing over since he talked to me in the library a few days ago. I couldn\u2019t believe he was here.</p><p>\u201cS\u2019belle,\u201d I said to her, more sure of that than anything I had since I met her. At that moment, I stood tall and strode across the room chanting, I can be his dream girl for the night over and over.</p><p>My insides froze when I stopped in front of him. I was so nervous that when I wrapped my trembling hand around his cup, I thought I might be sick. Then I thought, I can do this. It\u2019s my job, after all. But when our fingers touched and a heat spread throughout my body, my nerves were back.</p><p>He grinned down at me with eyes that had to make every girl look twice. He shuffled his feet and for a second I thought maybe he was nervous too, but only for a second because when I looked up into the smoldering heat of those blue eyes, I saw nothing but confidence. That one look gave me strength and I suddenly found my words. \u201cI\u2019ve been assigned as your little sister,\u201d I said, feeling as if my tone came out more little girl than dream girl. But the way he looked at me, I didn\u2019t think that was what he thought at all. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBell, you okay?\u201d Dino asks, and pulls me from my memories.</p><p>\u201cYes, I\u2019m fine,\u201d I reassure him as he places the last of the food on the table.</p><p>Dino works for Tate, my boss from my day job, and for me on occasion. I glance away from what we\u2019re doing and catch sight of Ben. He looks almost edible in his tux. He\u2019s talking to his sister and when he lowers his chin in an almost shy fashion, I have to look away. He\u2019s just too much to take in.</p><p>With my heart pounding, I race out onto the terrace for some air. I have to stay away from him. The way he looks at me, I know what he wants. And I can\u2019t control the way my body reacts when he\u2019s near. I know he\u2019s not good for me, and that nothing but heartache can come out of the attraction between us. There\u2019s just too much in our past to ever make this work. Two wrongs will never, ever make a right.</p> <p>CHAPTER 3</p><p>You and Me</p><p>Ben</p><p>As the night draws to an end, people start funneling out of the ballroom, stopping one last time to congratulate me. With each good-bye I look around, trying to spot her, but she\u2019s nowhere in sight. It\u2019s probably better that way. Once most of the guests are gone, I make my way toward the bar for some refuge. It\u2019s been a bittersweet night and I\u2019m ready for the memories it\u2019s awoken to once again become dormant.</p><p>\u201cThe same?\u201d the bartender asks me.</p> <p>I nod. \u201cWith a lemon slice if you don\u2019t mind.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m leaning over the short glass filled with ice, sparkling water, and the scent of citrus\u2014the scent of her\u2014chewing on a cube, thinking about my speech and the haunting sadness that Kane, with all his money and power, died with no one by his side.</p><p>When he died no one knew the one simple important fact that mattered most to him\u2014the one thing that made him happy. Am I headed down that same road? Fuck. Recently my sister and I came into a ten-million-dollar inheritance, and since then I\u2019ve done nothing except build my company. Put the pieces in play to establish what I hope will become a lucrative publishing holding company.</p><p>Staring at the lemon floating among the melting ice cubes, I can\u2019t help thinking how much things have changed over the past year. I came back to California looking to reclaim my life. But that life was long gone before I ever returned. My childhood sweetheart, the girl I was engaged to, was already in love with someone else. Then before I could even accept that and move forward, my mother died and I don\u2019t remember much of what happened after that. I know I spent many long months drowning my sorrows and making one poor decision after another. But I was serious about no more looking back. I need to move forward.</p><p>Jason slides in beside me. \u201cEverything okay?\u201d</p><p>Sitting up straight, I turn to face him. \u201cJust thinking about a girl.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDahlia?\u201d he asks.</p><p>\u201cNo, actually not her. We\u2019re in a good place as friends now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood, I\u2019m glad to hear it. Want to talk about the girl, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJason!\u201d We both turn in the direction of the voice. Serena walks toward us with her hands on her h*ps and a frown on her face. Her eyes narrow on the bar in front of us.</p><p>\u201cWhat, baby?\u201d he asks, pulling her toward him and kissing her lips.</p><p>She lifts my glass and sniffs it. Setting it back down, she looks between the two of us and smiles. \u201cNothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReady to go?\u201d he asks.</p><p>She nods, her long earrings swinging along her jawline. \u201cIf you are,\u201d she answers, folding into his side. She looks toward me. \u201cCome home with us?\u201d</p> <p>I can\u2019t help noticing how much she looks like our mother tonight. Her hair is pulled back, she has makeup on, and she\u2019s wearing a long black dress. She looks beautiful.</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019ll stay a bit longer. When is Trent leaving?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should tell him now,\u201d Jason mumbles in her ear.</p><p>\u201cNow now.\u201d Twisting, she says to me, \u201cIn three days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere might not be time,\u201d Jason says louder.</p><p>\u201cCome on, you two, I\u2019m right here. Just tell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know how to say this,\u201d Serena says, looking nervous and inhaling a deep breath.</p><p>Seriousness overtakes me. \u201cSay what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBaby, just tell him before you give him a heart attack,\u201d Jason pushes.</p><p>She blows out the breath she was holding. \u201cJason and I are going to take Trent back to the University of Hawaii together.\u201d</p><p>I give her a blank look. \u201cOkay, have fun. When are you coming back?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s more than a vacation. We\u2019re going to get remarried while we\u2019re there.\u201d</p><p>I stare at her for a long beat. Then I stand up and open my arms. My sister collapses into them. \u201cI\u2019m really happy for you,\u201d I say.</p><p>She wipes away some stray tears and I offer my hand to Jason. \u201cCongratulations, man. I know it\u2019s been a long road.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take care of them better this time,\u201d he promises.</p><p>And I believe him. I\u2019ve been on this roller-coaster ride for three years, but he\u2019s been on it for five. He distanced himself from his family to keep them safe as he pretended to be a dirty detective, all the while working under a special task force. He joined forces with a drug cartel to learn their inner workings and let his wife and son believe he was on the take. He sacrificed a lot to bring the cartel down. He deserves this second chance. But what\u2019s most important to me is that my sister and Trent are happy. And as long as they are, I\u2019m happy for them.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you say we grab the boy and all stop for ice cream at that place he likes with all the toppings?\u201d Jason says to Serena.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t eat that shit anymore,\u201d Trent says, joining us.</p><p>I try to hide my smile but can\u2019t. Instead I cross my arms and watch.</p><p>\u201cTrent Holt, that\u2019s enough of the potty mouth!\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom, I\u2019m not four. You don\u2019t have to say potty mouth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSon, let\u2019s just humor your mother and leave the foul language for your uncle.\u201d</p><p>I shake my head and laugh. \u201cHave a good night, everyone.\u201d I hug them all good-bye and watch as they head out the door, hoping that this time maybe they really can be one happy family.</p><p>With the room almost empty, I stare at the buffet tables that have already been broken down.</p><p>\u201cCan I get you anything else?\u201d the bartender asks.</p><p>I shake my head no and toss a fifty on the bar. \u201cHave a great night.\u201d</p><p>My fingers curl around the base of the crystal typewriter with the words California\u2019s Journalist of the Year scripted across it. Despite the glamorous surroundings, a sudden wave of loneliness floods me as I exit the now-empty Crystal Ballroom. I can\u2019t shake the feeling as I make my way out. I consider stopping in the lobby bar when I see the cocktail waitress in there but decide I\u2019d better go home. I don\u2019t want to do something I\u2019ll be kicking myself for tomorrow.</p><p>Next I take my time wandering the corridors of the grand hotel and by the time I find an exit door, I notice I\u2019m in the staff parking lot. Just as I\u2019m about to turn around, I spot S\u2019belle\u2019s car. The little cabriolet sits among a few other stray automobiles. My spirits suddenly lift at the sight and I have a driving need to see her. Thoughts of her\u2014her smile . . . never forced but always bright, her hair . . . red like fire, her body . . . hot and sexy\u2014have flooded me with need all night, yet it\u2019s her attitude . . . sassy but somehow innocent . . . that has made me burn for her.</p><p>For the longest time I stare up at the abundant stars in the clear night sky. I undo my bow tie and take it off, shoving it into my pocket as I question whether I should even be attempting to talk to her. Just then the sound of the side door opening startles me and I stand up straight. I nod toward the two guys wearing white server jackets and black pants, each carrying large silver trays. The taller one is the one who came to get S\u2019belle earlier.</p><p>I relax back against the brick wall and consider just going home. But when the door swings open again and I spot that distinctive curtain of red hair, it\u2019s too late. Her arms are loaded with smaller-sized pans and her attention is focused on the two guys, so she doesn\u2019t notice me. I stand back and Caleb\u2019s words echo in my head\u2014leave well enough alone. The parking lot lights cast shadows over her as she walks farther away from me into the darkness. That\u2019s what I decide to do\u2014leave well enough alone.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m parked over to the right,\u201d her sweet voice calls to the guys ahead of her.</p><p>She fumbles in her purse while trying to balance the load in her arms. She seems to be losing the battle. And then without thinking, I rush over toward her, trying to grab what I can from her hands, but I\u2019m too late and it all crashes down. Pans bounce off the blacktop, denting and skidding as they land, but our eyes aren\u2019t on the fallen items\u2014they\u2019re on each other.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d she says in a voice that screams innocence.</p><p>\u201cHi there,\u201d I answer back.</p><p>The faint freckles on her nose are something I don\u2019t remember. But the warmth of her breath whispering against my cheek makes my body come alive\u2014need instantly floods me. Her smile gleams and I smile back. I study her. Her eyes are a liquid green that reminds me of emeralds; the color\u2019s richer than I remember. Her red hair seems brighter than I recall it being and her curls are gone, but her mannerisms, her quirkiness, they\u2019re all still the same.</p><p>\u201cNeed help?\u201d one of the white-coated guys calls.</p><p>\u201cI got it,\u201d I yell back.</p><p>With the moment broken, we both squat to pick up the items and when we grab for the same tray our fingers touch and I feel it\u2014electricity bolting through my body. She yanks her hand away as if electrocuted and I know she feels it too. And this time when our eyes meet, I am certain of what I see\u2014desire. It\u2019s then that my confusion fades and I know what I want.</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>Knowing what I want and getting it have usually gone hand in hand for me, but I\u2019m not so sure that will be the case when it comes to the spitfire in front of me. Our history is sordid, maybe even tainted, but in this one moment of clarity I don\u2019t give a shit. The attraction between us can\u2019t be denied. And really what does it matter that we spent one night together when I was with someone else, or even that her brother is now married to that same girl? After all, two consenting adults should be able to have sex without the past being an issue.</p><p>Her fingers are shaking as she busies herself grabbing at the trays.</p><p>\u201cI got them.\u201d I cover up her hands with mine.</p><p>She stands quickly while I stay crouched gathering the last of the silver dishes from the ground. I\u2019ve thought about being with her again for so long, and the attraction only grew when we worked together this past summer. And right now I\u2019ll do whatever it takes to have her. I\u2019m on my knees and I consider groveling, apologizing for my lack of morals when I messed around with the bride whose wedding I was reporting on and she was coordinating, but with two dudes watching over me, there\u2019s no way in hell I\u2019ll ever do that.</p><p>When I stand up, she tucks her hair behind her ear and my breath catches. Her face is strikingly beautiful\u2014eyelashes longer than I\u2019ve ever seen, wide green eyes with a look of innocence about them, ivory skin with faint freckles on her dainty nose, and full lips that I want so much to have on mine.</p><p>There\u2019s a shift in her gaze as I stare at her and the warmth suddenly disappears. She pouts her lips and then attempts to take the trays from me.</p><p>I\u2019m bemused by her mood swing. \u201cLet me help you to your car.\u201d</p><p>She turns on her heel and leaves me standing there.</p><p>My lips twitch. \u201cI guess that\u2019s a yes?\u201d</p><p>She walks toward her cabriolet and clicks her key fob to open her trunk while nodding. The guys holding the larger pans are already beside the car, where they help her deposit the items.</p><p>\u201cSee you, Bell,\u201d one says. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cGood night, Matt,\u201d she answers.</p><p>\u201cNight, Bell. You sure you\u2019re okay?\u201d the other asks.</p><p>She looks at me. \u201cYes. And thanks for all your help,\u201d she calls as they both walk toward their own cars.</p><p>They seem young, yet hot for her just the same. But I can\u2019t help wondering if the taller one is having a thing with her. The thought makes my stomach churn. Ignoring it, I set the stuff I\u2019m holding on top of the others and close her trunk. I\u2019m relieved that she doesn\u2019t hurry to get in her car but instead stays where she is. My hands feel a little wet and sticky from the dishes, so I rub them together.</p> <p>\u201cI have something to clean your hands with in my backseat. Hang on,\u201d she says, and opens her car door, pulling out a pile of black linen napkins monogrammed with a BH in the corner.</p><p>I raise an eyebrow. \u201cContraband?\u201d</p><p>Her mouth falls open. \u201cNo! I grabbed what I could find quickly from the ballroom when I brought the food in. I used them to wipe up the juice from a tray that spilled on my seat on the way here. I\u2019ll return them the next time I come.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t that what they all say?\u201d</p><p>She places her hands on her hips. \u201cI will!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI believe you,\u201d I say with a grin.</p><p>She hands me one of the napkins.</p><p>\u201cYou know there\u2019s a reward for items like those.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes narrow. \u201cYou\u2019re lying.\u201d</p><p>My smile grows smug. \u201cNo, I\u2019m not. Well, there\u2019s a reward for seventy-five-year-old items like them. Come on, let me show you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, it\u2019s late.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not far, and who knows, we may even run into the ghosts who are said to haunt the place.\u201d</p><p>I finish wiping my hands and reach for her elbow. She doesn\u2019t flinch, so I let my fingers slide down her arm and rest on her tiny waist. Heat flares between us. \u201cCome on. I\u2019ll keep you safe.\u201d</p><p>She slants me a look, her eyes settling on the position of my hands. She steps back. \u201cThis isn\u2019t going to be like one of those Alfred Hitchcock movies, is it?\u201d</p><p>I snort. \u201cNo, I promise.\u201d</p><p>She shrugs. \u201cSure, okay, why not?\u201d</p><p>As we walk side by side, I find that my glance keeps shifting down to her shapely legs and then up to her full br**sts. She\u2019s such a knockout. I blink a few times rapidly to erase the images playing in my mind and ask, \u201cYou watch Hitchcock movies?\u201d</p><p>She clasps her hands together in the cutest f**king way. \u201cYes, I love old movies. I used to watch them with my dad all the time when I was a kid.\u201d</p><p>I open the side door, which is surprisingly unlocked. \u201cMe too.\u201d</p> <p>She seems to consider this for a moment before she steps back into the building.</p><p>In the hallway of the hotel she\u2019s very quiet. \u201cEverything okay?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cWhy do you think this hotel is haunted?\u201d she asks, and I think she might actually be a little scared.</p><p>\u201cIt was built on a cemetery and it\u2019s said you can hear laughing inside the Crystal Ballroom, but when one opens the doors, no one is in there. Some people have even claimed to have seen a ladylike shape walking through it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did you become such an expert on the place?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not really an expert. I bought a book over the summer about the history of LA, and haunted locations was one of the chapters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean there are others?\u201d</p><p>I step aside as I open a door for her to yet another hallway. \u201cYeah, like twelve more. The Roosevelt is one. Marilyn Monroe lived there for a while. In fact, her first magazine spread was shot there. It\u2019s rumored that people who stay in room 1200 can see her. I guess that\u2019s the room she lived in.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widen. \u201cSee her how?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey say they see her living in the mirror.\u201d</p><p>The hallways are dimly lit, so I do my best to lead us back to the Crystal Ballroom. The sound of a door slamming makes her jump.</p><p>I stop to look over at her. \u201cHey, Red, you\u2019re not really scared, are you?\u201d</p><p>She looks a little pale and I take a step closer to her. She closes her eyes and I follow the line of her jaw to the peak of her collarbone, gently brushing my fingertips up that same line. \u201cHey, look at me.\u201d</p><p>She opens her eyes and there is no denying it. It\u2019s the way she looks at me, has always looked at me. As though she gets me. It makes me want her as I\u2019ve never wanted anyone.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you two doing in here?\u201d a husky voice calls from the end of the hallway. \u201cThis is for staff only.\u201d</p><p>The trance is broken and she finds her voice. \u201cOh, I worked an event earlier and left something behind. I\u2019m just going back to get it,\u201d S\u2019belle tells the man.</p><p>\u201cOh, okay, then. Make it fast.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you just lie to that man?\u201d</p><p>Her eyes cut to mine. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t really a lie. Just a half-truth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a difference?\u201d I feign ignorance.</p><p>\u201cYes, now come on before he catches up with us,\u201d she says nervously.</p><p>I laugh and her eyes stay locked on mine. Her initially hard stare softens second by second and then just like that she shoves me forward and takes the lead. I follow her and the next door takes us right into the Crystal Ballroom.</p><p>I scratch my head. \u201cHow did you know how to get here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just mapped the location out in my head and followed the service corridors.\u201d</p><p>I raise my eyebrows. \u201cI\u2019m impressed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re closed,\u201d the bartender calls.</p><p>\u201cHey, man, I just popped in to show this nonbeliever your sign behind the bar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMr. Covington, I didn\u2019t realize it was you. Come on over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMr. Covington,\u201d she scoffs, and straightens her shoulders as she strides toward the bar. \u201cHi, Ryan. How was your night?\u201d she greets him.</p><p>Shock overtakes me. She knows him too?</p><p>He smiles at her. \u201cBusy,\u201d is all he says when he catches the look on my face.</p><p>She takes a seat and I move to stand behind her, making sure he knows she\u2019s with me. But with being this close, all I can think about is wanting to press myself against her.</p><p>He lifts the framed sign from behind the bar and hands it to S\u2019belle.</p><p>Her laughter jolts through me. She looks over her shoulder at me. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to turn me in, are you, Mr. Covington?\u201d</p><p>I wink at her and lean down to whisper in her ear, \u201cNot if you behave.\u201d</p><p>She sits perfectly still.</p><p>I watch in the mirror as her eyes close. I stay close just breathing into her ear and inhaling her lemon scent.</p><p>\u201cFunny, right?\u201d Ryan comments as he takes the sign from her and puts it back, making himself scarce at the other end of the bar.</p><p>S\u2019belle twirls around to face me. \u201cYour speech told such an emotional tale. I never thought about all you went through. I\u2019m really sorry\u2014\u201d</p><p>I place a finger over her lips. \u201cShhh . . . no sorries. That part of my life is over and I\u2019m moving forward. But I want to apologize to you for the last time we spoke. I really should explain\u2014I wasn\u2019t thinking clearly then. I was in a really bad place and\u2014\u201d</p><p>She repeats my action and places her finger over my lips. \u201cShhh . . . we\u2019ve all made mistakes. I shouldn\u2019t have judged. So let\u2019s just let it go.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s letting me off the hook for my lapse in judgment. Good. Working as a wedding columnist over the summer and fraternizing with the bride is not anything I\u2019m proud of or even want to ever think about again.</p><p>We lean toward each other, drawn together like two magnets. I place my hands on either side of her. This close there\u2019s no denying that we are two people who want each other. Lust, fire, desire erupt between us.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Mr. Covington, but I have to close the room down now.\u201d</p><p>The weight of his gaze as he takes us in tells me he wants to be me. A smug satisfied smile spreads across my lips that he isn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll get out of your hair and thanks for letting us in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnytime,\u201d he says.</p><p>I pull myself back to look at her.</p><p>She tries to step from the barstool, but one of her heels gets caught in the rung. I catch her splaying my fingers across her hipbones and guide her to safety. \u201cYou okay?\u201d</p><p>She blinks but doesn\u2019t answer.</p><p>When I assess her body for signs of injury, the only thing I notice is gooseflesh up and down her arms. \u201cReady to head back?\u201d I ask her softly.</p><p>She nods, still unable to speak, seemingly in a daze. I find it rather adorable. But that feeling passes quickly when she raises her eyes and they meet mine. In them I see no need for words. I recognize the look\u2014one of pure hunger.</p><p>CHAPTER 4</p><p>Underneath It All</p><p>Bell</p><p>I\u2019m not going to try to deny the desire burning within me. Heat flares as he leads me out of the ballroom, and it only seems to get hotter with each breath I take. I am, as always, completely under the spell that is Ben Covington\u2014whenever he is near me now, then, and dare I say forever? The thing is that I can also tell he wants me just as much as I want him.</p><p>He turns around, walking and talking at the same time, his eyes drinking me in all the while. \u201cCan you lead us back this way or should we take the main hallways?\u201d</p><p>From the intense look he gives me, the same memory that was interrupted earlier assaults me.</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>At the frat party his eyes drank me in as if he had been in the desert for days and I were his first cup of water. Shivers went down my spine and I lost my ability to speak, but I didn\u2019t really need to because he communicated with me by trailing his gaze slowly down my body. He stopped on my low-cut shirt and I was sure he could see my ni**les popping out of the thin fabric. My breathing picked up as he lowered his eyes to the short hemline of my skirt. I had a feeling he knew my panties were already soaked, because I saw him swallow a few times.</p><p>When his eyes returned to my face, it was my turn. I scanned him in the same way he had swept his gorgeous blue eyes over me\u2014from head to toe. His mop of shaggy blond hair was even more of a mess than usual. I wanted to run my fingers through it and comb it into place. His tall, lean, muscular body looked tan. I wanted to touch it to see how smooth it felt. He wore a white button-down shirt; he seemed to wear those a lot. This one was frayed around the untucked edges, which made it look comfortable\u2014I wanted to wear it. I smiled and with a wicked grin he smiled back. He seemed to understand the purpose of my presence before him, but he didn\u2019t release his hold. Something passed between us and then his stare went blank and he finally let go of the cup.</p><p>I twirled in a half turn and bounced over to the keg. I was extremely uncomfortable in this overtly short skirt and tried to shimmy it down with one hand as I walked. Claire\u2019s shoes were too big and I kept slipping out of them, so I had to walk slowly. On my way back I saw Ben motion as if he was unzipping his pants and make a sucking gesture to the guy he was talking to. At that point I wondered if Claire was wrong about him. Maybe he didn\u2019t have a girlfriend? Maybe he liked guys? I wasn\u2019t close enough to hear what he was saying, but in the next moment he was laughing hysterically. The sound of his laugh made a heat creep up my chest.</p><p>Just as I approached him he turned around. I was sure I had a look of horror on my face because he said, \u201cWhat?\u201d with another laugh.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not really a part of hazing, is it?\u201d I naively asked, wondering if Claire wasn\u2019t kidding after all.</p><p>\u201cFuck no. I was just busting his balls,\u201d he said, taking his beer. Then he said, \u201cThank you . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cS\u2019belle,\u201d I finished for him.</p><p>\u201cI know your name.\u201d</p><p>The sound of his voice caused a tingle between my thighs.</p><p>That tingling only magnified with the grin he wore. I was surprised he\u2019d remembered. But before I could say anything else, he excused himself and walked away. I tried to mingle, but my eyes kept roving back to him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Claire checked on me. \u201cI told you he was a dud.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t think that at all.</p><p>\u201cDo you want to be assigned to someone new? A few guys just arrived and I\u2019m pretty sure they\u2019re looking for attention.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I immediately protested.</p> <p>She raised her hands. \u201cOkay. Your boredom, not mine. I have to get back to it.\u201d</p><p>I nodded, glad for her to be gone. During our brief conversation, I had lost sight of Ben in the crowd. People were pushing and shoving or maybe they were dancing I couldn\u2019t tell. All I knew was the majority of them were drunk. The place stank of cigarettes and beer, and even more disgusting sweat. Even in heels, I was shorter than most of the people and they kept running into me. I threaded my way through the crowd but tripped when one of my heels caught in the fringe on a throw rug. I fell into someone\u2019s hard chest and his girlfriend or dream girl looked as though she wanted to kill me.</p><p>\u201cWatch where the f**k you\u2019re going!\u201d she snarled.</p><p>My eyes widened. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry!\u201d</p><p>She looked as if she wanted to punch me.</p> <p>\u201cRelax, Ella, it was an accident. Don\u2019t get your panties in a wad.\u201d His voice boomed over the music.</p><p>I looked up into Ben\u2019s eyes. My hero had saved me. He took my elbow and tried to steer me away from the crowd, but the center of the room had turned into a mosh pit and I kept getting dragged behind him. That\u2019s when he grabbed my hand. He moved fast and with my pulse pounding he guided me to the safety of the wall. But as soon as we reached it, he released his grip on my hand. I felt an immediate loss, and my body temperature seemed to dip, as the heat that was there between us had suffused me and I missed it.</p><p>He shoved his hands in his pockets. \u201cSome chicks are vicious,\u201d he commented.</p><p>I giggled, using the wall to support myself as I recovered.</p><p>\u201cI like your laugh,\u201d he said, his eyes unknowingly or maybe knowingly scanning the length of my body.</p><p>I melted on the spot.</p> <p>He leaned forward to whisper in my ear, \u201cYou look a little shaken. Let me get you a drink.\u201d</p><p>I was shaken, that was for sure, but not from what had just happened. I snapped out of it and grabbed his arm. \u201cNo, let me get you a drink. That\u2019s my job.\u201d I slapped my hand over my mouth. \u201cShoot, I didn\u2019t mean my job. I didn\u2019t mean it that way.\u201d</p><p>He smirked and then winked. \u201cI won\u2019t tell anyone you said the forbidden word. Don\u2019t worry.\u201d</p><p>I swallowed deeply and tried to gather myself as I watched him saunter across the room. God, everything about him was so electric.</p><p>When he returned with two cups of beer, he clinked his to mine. \u201cTo making it through rush\u2014unscathed,\u201d he joked.</p><p>His voice was warm, seductive, and I wanted to hear it again. I smiled at him, but before I could say anything else that blank look crossed his face once more. Then just like that, he nodded and turned back around, getting lost in the crowd. I made sure not to lose sight of him again. I refilled his beer whenever it was empty for the rest of the night and he thanked me, but the conversation never went any further. He laughed and carried on with pledges and brothers as I admired him from afar. I couldn\u2019t do any of the things Claire, or Stacy, had encouraged, because he didn\u2019t give me the opportunity.</p><p>The night ended before I expected when all of a sudden Ben stood on a chair and announced to the new pledges their task. They were to comb the campus for pink lace panties. If I could have run home and changed my underwear, I would have, even though the thought was so unlike me.</p><p>Once everyone took off, the house was practically empty. Claire had disappeared with one of the guys and so had the other girls I had seen earlier at her table. I had only consumed a few beers, but since I really never drank I was feeling a little tipsy and quite bold. I stared across the room at Ben. He looked insanely gorgeous with one foot propped against the paneling, lazily leaning against the wall while talking on his phone. He flipped it shut and slid it in his pocket and then stared into his red Solo cup. It was then that I made my move because I knew it was now or never. My legs were trembling, so I approached him slowly. I stood in front of him and took his cup again. He glanced up and I swear his eyes were bluer than any ocean I\u2019d ever seen.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m good,\u201d he said. His languid eyes stared into the depths of mine.</p><p>The trembling made its way up my body and my fingers started shaking. But when I looked up at him and his hand covered mine, I felt it all over again\u2014the electricity that passed between us. I batted my eyelashes even though I felt ridiculous. \u201cAre you sure?\u201d</p><p>He chuckled. \u201cYeah, I\u2019m sure.\u201d</p><p>My cheeks flamed because I was pretty sure he was laughing at my attempt to be a dream girl and I decided to drop that act before it even started. He could obviously see through it.</p><p>\u201cDid you have fun tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s not fun about naive college freshmen?\u201d He laughed. \u201cWhat about you?\u201d he asked, low and slow, with a huskiness to his voice that made my ni**les harden.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve had more fun,\u201d I answered, reaching inside myself to find a flirtiness that I never knew I had.</p><p>He raised an eyebrow. \u201cOh yeah? Do tell.\u201d</p><p>He caught me off guard. I wasn\u2019t expecting him to ask me that. I sucked in a breath and reeled for what to say. My eyes darted around the room and landed on a poster on the wall that read LA C\u00d4TE D\u2019AZUR and I made something up quickly about the place that I knew would turn any guy on. Of course, it was something I had never actually done.</p><p>I summoned all my courage and said, \u201cI spent my freshman year in France, and the French Riviera had so many nude beaches that were always fun.\u201d I made sure to say it in a sultry seductive tone. And technically what I told him wasn\u2019t a lie. I was sure they were fun.</p><p>His eyes may have been unfocused, but he straightened his stance and stared at me.</p><p>I moved even closer, trying to remember how to breathe.</p><p>His mouth quirked and he asked, \u201cWhen you went to the beach did you do the American thing and wear your bathing suit?\u201d</p><p>Something came over me and I became someone else entirely. I wasn\u2019t someone made up, but rather someone that knew what she wanted, and suddenly any apprehension or nervousness I had slipped away. I leaned in and whispered, \u201cNo, I didn\u2019t even bring one to France.\u201d My voice sounded saucy.</p><p>His eyes widened and I couldn\u2019t believe what I had just said. But I wanted him. I wanted him as I\u2019d never wanted anyone else before. I felt different with him and I liked who I was. I was pretty sure he liked it too because when I glanced down at his jeans, there was no mistaking he was turned on. Needing to keep his attention, I bit my lip and averted my gaze, trying to summon the confidence to seduce him. I took a deep breath.</p><p>\u201cEveryone was completely nude. There were a lot of beady-eyed older men conspicuously peering over the top of their newspaper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI stripped it all off,\u201d I answered confidently.</p><p>He swallowed. \u201cYou weren\u2019t alone, I hope.\u201d</p><p>Shoot, who was I with? \u201cNo. My friend brought me. She was obsessed with staring at n*ked men.\u201d What?</p><p>\u201cWere there more men or women?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, many more women.\u201d I had no idea.</p><p>The more detail I described, the more his gaze shifted from my eyes to my body. When I noticed he was interested, that he was paying attention, I became S\u2019belle. I let my inner vixen reign and continued to paint the picture\u2014making it as hot as I could.</p><p>Suddenly he cleared his throat. \u201cExcuse me, I forgot I have something I have to do.\u201d He turned and walked away without even glancing back.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t let him go, so I followed him. He went into one of the downstairs suites, but no one answered when I knocked, so I turned the knob. It was unlocked. He wasn\u2019t in there, but a light from a corner room told me where he was. I heard the water running and knocked again. I didn\u2019t hear any protest, so I walked in and there he was, leaning over the sink, looking at me in the mirror. I quickly closed the door behind me and locked it. I was his dream girl and I wasn\u2019t going to give him a chance to ask me to leave. I summoned all my inner strength and went for it, tugging my skirt down and standing before him in my black lace panties. The way he looked at me gave me all the strength I needed to proceed. I had never stood in front of a guy with the confidence I felt with him that day. It was because of the way he looked at me.</p><p>His lips parted and he watched me with a reckless abandon that made me yearn for him. I slowly unbuttoned my low-cut blouse that was already partially undone anyway. When I finished with the buttons, I glided my palms down my stomach. I was so nervous that when I slid my fingers in the waistband of my panties, I scratched myself. But the way he watched me in the mirror made excitement surge through me.</p><p>\u201cThey aren\u2019t pink, but will they do?\u201d I asked, finding that same flirty voice I had used earlier.</p><p>He turned around to face me but said nothing. I didn\u2019t move. His eyes locked on mine and he licked his lips as though he was hungry for me. I took my shirt completely off and then quickly removed my bra. I still wasn\u2019t sure if he was going to stay. I thought maybe his girlfriend would win out in the internal battle he seemed to be waging within himself.</p><p>But once I twirled around slowly and said, \u201cThis is how I looked on the French Riviera,\u201d I knew he wanted me as much as I wanted him.</p><p>His eyes held me in his stare.</p><p>My heart pounded from the heat I saw in his gaze. He strode across the room and caught me by surprise when he stopped short. He stood in front of me and drank me in but didn\u2019t move. I looked up at him, but at the want I saw in his eyes, I was done waiting. I tugged on the waistband of his pants and pulled him toward me. His soapy scent smelled fresh and clean and I breathed it in\u2014knowing I\u2019d never forget it.</p><p>In a flash he grabbed the back of my neck and found my mouth. His tongue licked my lips. I opened my mouth, allowing him entrance. His lips were warm and soft. My stomach fluttered from the contact. The tingling between my legs became almost painful as electricity surged through my entire body. I kissed him back with the same urgency he kissed me with. The kiss felt different from anything I had ever experienced before; he felt different. He kissed me with a need no one had ever shown me before and I knew then that what we were doing couldn\u2019t be wrong.</p><p>What I didn\u2019t know was that one kiss would change the rest of my life.</p><p>Both of us breathless, he pulled back and just stared at me for the longest time. Then finally he touched me. His fingers brushed the lace of my panties. He moved them back and forth, up and down\u2014it was slow, it was torturous. When he slipped his hand inside them, my blood rushed through my veins to that very spot and I was sure he could feel it.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure you want to do this?\u201d he breathed against my neck, his fingers right where I wanted them.</p><p>My pulse pounded and this time I was certain he could hear it. \u201cYes,\u201d I answered without hesitation.</p><p>His small featherlike touches made me gasp.</p><p>\u201cTake them off,\u201d he ordered.</p><p>His tone, his demanding demeanor, made a thrill erupt inside me. I felt as if my blood were boiling. No one had ever spoken to me like that. He crossed his arms and leaned against the counter to watch me. My pulse raced as I slowly pushed the fabric down my h*ps and over my thighs, letting it fall to the floor.</p><p>\u201cCome over here,\u201d he commanded.</p><p>I was far too excited as I stepped out of my panties. My br**sts had already swelled and I could feel the arousal between my legs. I did as he said. I thought I might do anything he asked. His tone was so deep and sultry that it oozed sex appeal. He swooped me up and set me on the counter. There I sat, naked, before him and I used the same force he had used just a few moments earlier and pulled his head to mine to kiss him. He returned the kiss, his hands sliding down my chest. The heat of his touch erased any doubts I had that he might leave. My ni**les pebbled at his touch and when he bent down and sucked on one I thought I might explode. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I had my heels on and ran the toe of my shoe up his thigh.</p><p>\u201cTake those off,\u201d he told me, his voice sounding raspy.</p><p>I quickly kicked them to the floor and this time ran my bare foot back up the same path, curling my toes around his hard cock. He groaned and I wanted to hear that sound again. My hands flew to where my foot had just been and I traced his erection with my fingernails, eliciting another groan from him.</p><p>Then he stood back and toed his sneakers off. He stripped out of the rest of his clothing before his eyes cut to mine. His lids were partially hooded, but I could still see the deep blue. God, his eyes were gorgeous. God, was he gorgeous!</p> <p>He lowered his head. \u201cYou sure you want to do this?\u201d This time his tone was soft, sweet, unlike the way it had been up until now.</p><p>There was no doubt I wanted this. I nodded and reached my hand back down to stroke his throbbing cock.</p><p>\u201cSay it,\u201d he said with the force back in his voice.</p><p>I bit my lip. \u201cI want you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want me what?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI want you to f**k me,\u201d I breathed.</p><p>When the words left my mouth, there was no question who I was. I wasn\u2019t the dream girl I had been told to be\u2014no, I was the real me and I wanted him, all of him. Everything he had to give I wanted to take. The hunger inside me was nearly unbearable. Thank God it didn\u2019t take long before he was inside me. He made love to me as no one ever had. I became his dream girl at some point during the night because I wanted to give him everything he didn\u2019t even know he wanted. I wanted to do things to him I had only heard about.</p><p>The things we did would become a memory that stayed with me for a very long time. When he took me it wasn\u2019t with an urgency to just fulfill his own need. It wasn\u2019t fast and quick like with other guys I had been with. Rather, it was a night filled with passion, lust, with our deepest, darkest desires being met. It was a dream, a fantasy\u2014one I wanted to live out over and over for a very long time. He must have fallen asleep around five a.m., but I didn\u2019t want to close my eyes. I watched him, thinking how perfect he seemed. He was a mix of good and bad, salty and sweet, all of which left me wanting more. I wanted to be his dream girl\u2014always.</p><p>But he belonged to someone else and who was I to take him from her? The sudden realization shattered me. I knew I should leave before morning came, to make this easier for both of us. So while he slept, I gathered my things. Before leaving, I picked up his shirt and breathed in the scent and stared at Ben for the longest time. I\u2019d remember him like that forever\u2014all long and lean, suntanned skin, mess of blond hair covering those eyes that were bluer than any ocean. I covered him with his shirt, the one with the frayed edges. When I looked down at him one last time, I couldn\u2019t help thinking it looked the way I felt.</p><p>Walking backward toward the door, I stumbled over his sweatshirt on the floor. I couldn\u2019t resist it. I wanted to keep a small piece of him, so I slipped it on. He stirred, mumbling, \u201cS\u2019belle\u201d as he slept, but he never woke. I crept out of the room, thinking to myself my name was Bell, not S\u2019belle. My Paris high was still strong and even though I had told a few people my name was S\u2019belle because I thought it sounded sexier, I knew he would be the last. I wanted him to own it.</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p> <p>\u201cRed? Did you hear me?\u201d he asks, pulling me back to the here and now.</p><p>He calls me Red because I flat-out told him when I saw him this past summer to never call me S\u2019belle again. That\u2019s not what I wanted at all, but it was for the best. I draw in a shaky breath before I can find my voice. \u201cI know the way back. Follow me.\u201d</p><p>In the dark corridor he takes my hand in his. An innocent gesture, gallant even\u2014guide a woman through a dark hallway. But to me, there\u2019s more to it. Don\u2019t read too much into it, I remind myself. I squash the emotions entering my brain that can only lead to false hope. But when he squeezes our laced fingers, my stomach immediately starts to flutter. Sex, I tell myself. That\u2019s all this could ever be. That\u2019s all it ever was. And besides, there is too much baggage between us for there to be anything else.</p><p>\u201cYou know this hotel is not only rumored to be haunted but has a monumental place in movie history,\u201d he says so matter-of-factly that I\u2019m wondering if maybe the attraction I thought was mutual isn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cNo, I didn\u2019t know that. What do you mean?\u201d I try to mask my anxious breathing the farther into the darkness we step.</p><p>\u201cThe hotel was used to film the prom scene in Pretty in Pink. A boxing ring was set up in one of the ballrooms for Rocky III. The Ghostbusters movie used the Music Room to catch Slimer. Eddie Murphy\u2014\u201d</p><p>I interrupt his list of credits, thinking maybe he might be a little nervous after all. \u201cOh, my brother Xander loved Ghostbusters. I used to watch it with him and his girlfriend all the time when we were younger.\u201d</p><p>We enter into the stainless steel food prep area, where I had seen him earlier tonight. Suddenly a noise, sounding like a loud whisper, echoes through the room and I jump at the same time a scream escapes me. \u201cOh my God, this place really is haunted.\u201d My heart thumps at the thought.</p> <p>It\u2019s kind of hard to make out in the dim lighting, but I know I catch sight of a smirk on Ben\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cHey, it\u2019s okay. It\u2019s not ghosts, I promise. It\u2019s probably just the mice.\u201d</p><p>I shriek this time. \u201cWhere are they? I hate rodents.\u201d</p><p>He presses me against the cool stainless steel wall before murmuring in my ear, \u201cThey live in the walls. They can\u2019t hurt you. And even if they could, I\u2019m here.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m not sure if he means the ghosts or the mice, but honestly, I don\u2019t care about either with the warmth of his body pressed so close to mine. Even in my heels I have to tilt my head to see his face. \u201cI\u2019m not a damsel in distress, you know.\u201d</p><p>He slides his tongue along his lip before answering me. \u201cMaybe you could be,\u201d he whispers.</p><p>Lust, want, and need for this man purge themselves from every single one of my pores. I swallow hard, then lean in and breathe him in. It\u2019s the same scent I remember from so long ago\u2014nothing more, just soap. Fresh and clean.</p><p>\u201cDid you just smell me?\u201d he asks.</p><p>\u201cI did,\u201d I purr.</p><p>\u201cFuck.\u201d</p><p>And with his curse his lips crash to mine. His mouth is soft and warm; his tongue is slick and wet. It\u2019s a heady combination, but this kiss is anything but sweet. It\u2019s frantic, dark, deliriously delicious. Sweet\u2014definitely not. Ben draws me closer and I can feel his hardness against my belly. The thought that I can do this to him so quickly enables me to be bolder. My fingers move to his shirt and I pull it out of his pants. \u201cI thought you were here to save me,\u201d I manage between frantic kisses after deciding to be that damsel in distress after all.</p><p>Before I can even undo the first button, his hands encircle my wrists and lift them over my head. \u201cI am,\u201d he says, obviously spurred on by this little charade. He holds my wrists with one hand, and the other effortlessly unzips my dress and it puddles at my feet. He\u2019s good. A lot of practice, I think.</p><p>He breaks our kiss and leans back, not letting go of my hands. He hisses in a breath through his teeth in a way that tells me he likes what he sees. I take a second to look around at our surroundings.</p><p>\u201cWhat if someone walks through here?\u201d I\u2019m standing in my black strapless bra and hose before him.</p><p>\u201cNo one is around this late at night. And besides, remember, I\u2019m here to protect you?\u201d His voice is more of a rasp. \u201cGod, you\u2019re so f**king sexy.\u201d</p><p>I look at him. Lips parted. Eyes hooded. And a grin that pierces every nerve in my body. \u201cTake your shirt off,\u201d I tell him.</p><p>His grin grows wicked. But he doesn\u2019t do as I instructed. Instead he glides a hand down the side of my body. His touch leaves an ever-burning flame in its wake. His mouth finds my neck to sprinkle hot, wet kisses up to my ear. \u201cI\u2019ll take my shirt off but because I want it off,\u201d he growls.</p><p>He lets go of my wrists and they fall to my side. I can feel my body tremble as I watch him slowly unbutton his shirt. I can\u2019t help remembering the bad boy that rocked my world that one night. My heart pounds louder and faster with every passing second. As the consequences of our night together fade from my mind, I let the joy of this moment consume me. Why? Because in all the years since him, in all the boyfriends I\u2019ve had, no one has ever made my body tingle with anticipation like him. No one has ever made me feel the way he did.</p><p>\u201cDo you feel safer now?\u201d He\u2019s got a cocky grin as his shirt falls to the floor and he unbuckles his belt but doesn\u2019t undo his pants.</p><p>I\u2019m completely absorbed in following the lines of his body. From his biceps, where his muscles flex every time his arms move, to his perfectly defined smooth chest. A six-pack worthy of tracing, with my tongue or my finger. His pants hang low and I can\u2019t help staring at the muscles that connect his hipbones or at the thin line of fine hair that trails down and disappears into the waistband of his pants.</p><p>\u201cSee something you like?\u201d he asks.</p><p>His devilishly handsome features have already shifted into a knowing grin when I raise my eyes to him. I swallow, suddenly feeling shy.</p><p>His fingers caress my face. \u201cYou sure about this?\u201d</p><p>I bite my lower lip and nod, once again unable to speak.</p><p>His expression grows dark and within seconds I lose sight of those blue eyes that I could look into for hours. He bends to kiss the exposed skin of my chest while his hands go to my thighs. My ni**les tighten beneath the lace of my bra as his mouth skates over my br**sts and my core aches when his fingers dance in between my thighs.</p><p>I mirror the position of his fingers and slowly pull his zipper down. As soon as I do his dress trousers slide even farther down his hips. His hands quickly slide up the silk of my hose, and his palms come to rest between my legs. \u201cFuck, you\u2019re drenched,\u201d he pants.</p><p>I throw my head back and find my courage to talk dirty. I can do it. \u201cI\u2019m not wearing underwear and I started dripping the moment I saw you.\u201d</p><p>His guttural groan echoes through the room and in a flash he rips the crotch of my stockings and tugs down his boxers. He pulls his wallet out and once the condom is in place his eyes darken. The tip of his c**k presses against me in the very next moment, but then he scans the area and hesitates.</p><p>I don\u2019t give him time to second-guess things. This is what I want. I wrap my arms around his neck and arch my h*ps into his. By now our breathing is out of control.</p><p>\u201cTake me,\u201d I moan.</p><p>And that\u2019s just what he does.</p><p>CHAPTER 5</p><p>Show Me What I\u2019m Looking For</p><p>Ben</p><p>We make our way back through the dark corridors and a little thing called guilt settles in my mind. This girl does crazy things to me and I want her. I\u2019ve always wanted her. Every time I see her I think about what it felt like to be buried deep inside her.</p><p>I lean down and whisper in her ear, \u201cThat was unexpected.\u201d</p><p>She lowers her gaze, allowing her hair to shield her face. \u201cWas it?\u201d</p><p>Heat rises in my body as I consider her response. Suddenly a sound of pipes clattering above us has her raising her hands over her head. I pull her close. \u201cHey, the plumbing here is old. It\u2019s nothing to be scared of.\u201d</p><p>I walk faster and with her hand clutching mine, I open the door and we step outside. This time I not only notice the stars but see the moon is full, bright. The air also seems cooler. Good. I glance around the now-vacant parking lot, then down at her. \u201cWhere\u2019s the Tate catering truck? Why were you squeezing pans into your car anyway?\u201d</p><p>Her lipstick is a little smeared and her hair disheveled, but she\u2019s still a knockout. \u201cTonight\u2019s event was all me,\u201d she says, beaming.</p><p>\u201cAll you? You don\u2019t work for that ass**le anymore?\u201d</p><p>She giggles. \u201cI do, but since Tate only does weddings now, he\u2019s fine with me venturing out on my own. I just recently started my own event-planning company.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cTate\u2019s cool with that?\u201d I have to say I\u2019m surprised. From what I saw of him over the summer, he seemed like a complete dick-wad.</p><p>\u201cHis only stipulation was that I not include weddings as one of my offerings, so I\u2019ve been concentrating mainly on business events. I usually have everything delivered, but the peppered beef skewers from Pebbles are my favorite and they don\u2019t deliver.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh . . . I definitely ate my fair share of those.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight! They are so good you can\u2019t have just one.\u201d</p> <p>I laugh.</p><p>She smiles.</p><p>The sight triggers something odd inside me, something that I haven\u2019t felt in a very long time. Maybe it\u2019s just that I don\u2019t want to say good-bye to her. I\u2019m not ready for the night to end and I don\u2019t think she is either. I consider my options as they run through my mind. But in the end I decide to do the gentlemanly thing rather than what I really want to do\u2014again. I have this strange feeling that she\u2019s struggling with her emotions and I know what that\u2019s like, as I seem to be doing the same.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you say to a cup of coffee?\u201d</p><p>She scans the parking lot. \u201cHow did you get here?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMy bike. Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll agree to go for coffee, but only if you let me drive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you scared?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to get pulled over for not wearing a helmet.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat didn\u2019t bother you the time I drove you home when you\u2019d locked your keys in your car.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was in a hurry then. It was different.\u201d</p><p>I refrain from scoffing under my breath. \u201cDifferent how?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. If I had to explain to a policeman I\u2019m sure I could think of something.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s serious. I have to hide my laughter at how f**king cute she is. \u201cAh . . . those half-truths are easier to tell than lies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. That\u2019s it.\u201d She\u2019s got a glow about her that\u2019s not from the parking lot lights above us. \u201cAnd, Ben\u201d\u2014her tone drops to a whisper\u2014\u201cI never got to say thank you for changing my tire.\u201d Then she lifts her wrist. \u201cAnd for the watch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was no big deal. Glad the watch has come in handy.\u201d I decide to make light of it. I\u2019d helped her out over the summer by changing a flat and giving her my watch when hers was broken. But I\u2019m glad she seems to have appreciated it. I want to kiss her. I want her to come home with me. But I settle on trying to turn the quickie in the prep kitchen into something more and ask, \u201cYou hungry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA little.\u201d She smiles with that look of innocence she has about her, and the heat between us is almost unbearable.</p> <p>I avert my gaze and bob my chin toward the sidewalk. \u201cCome on, I know a great little coffee shop right around the corner with the best homemade pies. We can walk.\u201d</p><p>Four &amp; Twenty Blackbirds seems straight from a 1950s sitcom, all decorated in red gingham. And in keeping with the nostalgic theme, the homemade pies taste as if they\u2019ve just come out of Grandma\u2019s oven. The mom-and-pop place is dimly lit, but the carousel of pies is lit up in a way I\u2019ve never noticed.</p><p>S\u2019belle rushes over to it and splays her hands across the glass. She points to a slice. \u201cWhat\u2019s that one?\u201d</p><p>I step close enough to whisper in her ear, \u201cOh, that would be their signature triple-crusted berry pie. I know it well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTriple crust?\u201d Her eyes are wide as she turns to glance back at me and licks her lips. Fuck, that\u2019s hot.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s really good.\u201d I pat my stomach.</p><p>From this angle over her shoulder, my eyes go directly to her ample br**sts spilling out the top of what I know is a black lacy strapless bra. My c**k throbs at the sight\u2014again. She turns her head in time to catch my stare. Her breathing picks up as if she\u2019s reliving things too. I can see it. The light of the case highlights her freckles. I think about the way her eyes drift downward when she talks and how she lets her hair cover her face when she answers me\u2014she\u2019s got a quirky, sassy personality, but there\u2019s also an innocence there.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that one?\u201d she asks, twisting back toward the case.</p><p>\u201cI think that\u2019s the sweet potato pie.\u201d</p><p>She wrinkles her nose. \u201cVegetables should not be put in desserts.\u201d</p><p>I raise an eyebrow. \u201cYou have an issue with vegetables?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just might,\u201d she says sassily.</p><p>A smile tugs at my lips. \u201cMe too.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s flirting with me. I haven\u2019t flirted with a girl in . . . Fuck, I\u2019m not really sure I\u2019ve ever actually flirted, except with her back in college. My pulse is racing and I think it\u2019s time to leave the pie display before I push her up against it. I glance around. Only a few people are sitting at the communal table, so we have our choice of seats.</p><p>\u201cCome on. The booth in the front has the best view of the street.\u201d</p><p>We sit by the window and I notice her shiver when our thighs touch. I remove my jacket and stand to drape it around her.</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d She pulls it closed around her body.</p><p>I catch sight of her sniffing it and although I want to bust out laughing, at the same time I find it really endearing and don\u2019t want to ruin the moment, so I keep my mouth shut and glance down at my menu instead.</p><p>The waitress doesn\u2019t wait for us to go to the counter to place our order. Instead she comes over to our table. \u201cHaven\u2019t seen you around here in a while,\u201d she says.</p><p>\u201cI know. I\u2019ve definitely missed the food.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRuby just left.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s too bad. I haven\u2019t caught up with her in a while.\u201d</p><p>The waitress whose name I don\u2019t know pulls out her small pad of paper. \u201cWhat are you two having?\u201d</p><p>I look across at S\u2019belle and motion for her to go first.</p><p>\u201cCoffee with cream and sugar\u2014oh, make it decaffeinated\u2014and whatever pie he\u2019s having.\u201d</p><p>The waitress glances over to me. \u201cCoffee, but not that decaf crap, and two slices of the triple-crusted blackberry pie.\u201d</p><p>The waitress closes her pad. \u201cComing right up.\u201d</p><p>My eyes lift toward S\u2019belle\u2019s, and a smile crosses her face. \u201cGood choice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019ve been known to make a few.\u201d I grin at her.</p><p>A yawn escapes her mouth.</p><p>\u201cAm I boring you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s just been a long day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, drinking decaf isn\u2019t going to help that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, it is.\u201d</p><p>I give her a questioning look.</p><p>\u201cCoffee is coffee.\u201d</p><p>Man, this girl is quirky . . . it\u2019s such a turn-on.</p><p>The waitress returns with our coffees and I watch as S\u2019belle turns hers into a cup of steamed milk. A few minutes later the pie arrives and we sit happily across from each other drinking coffee and eating pie. Glances swap back and forth and there is no doubt what we\u2019re both thinking about.</p><p>She pushes her half-eaten slice of pie in front of her. \u201cI\u2019m so full. That was delicious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNext time we come, you have to try the apple. It\u2019s just as good. I promise.\u201d</p><p>Twirling her spoon in her coffee and staring in her cup, she asks, \u201cWho\u2019s Ruby?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s a waitress here I met last summer. I helped her out with a few things and we got close.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo she was your girlfriend?\u201d</p><p>I raise my eyebrows. \u201cNo, she\u2019s dating my buddy now. I introduced them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d she says, and I notice she hasn\u2019t looked up from her cup yet.</p><p>Hmm . . . she\u2019s not jealous, is she?</p><p>I feel the need to explain further.</p><p>But then she looks up with a raised brow and says, \u201cI would never have pegged you for a matchmaker.\u201d</p><p>I shrug and grin back at her.</p><p>Her cell phone rings and she takes it from her purse. \u201cExcuse me, I have to take this.\u201d</p><p>I nod.</p><p>\u201cHello,\u201d she answers. \u201cNo, I didn\u2019t forget about it. I\u2019m going to drop it off tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s a pause and her whole body tenses. \u201cOkay, I\u2019ll meet her first thing in the morning.\u201d</p><p>Another pause and her eyebrows scrunch. \u201cI didn\u2019t know she wanted to see it first. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>Without a good-bye she presses END on her phone.</p><p>\u201cEverything okay?\u201d I ask.</p><p>She nods and I swear I see tears welling in her eyes. \u201cThat was Tate. We miscommunicated about the bride approving her cake topper for her wedding tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>I raise an eyebrow. \u201cDid he hang up on you?\u201d</p><p>She lowers her gaze. \u201cHe was done talking.\u201d</p><p>Exasperation clear in my voice, I ask, \u201cWhy are you still working for that ass**le?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not that bad. And not only do I need the experience, but the connections I\u2019m making are invaluable. My plan is to quit by the end of the year.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt least you have a plan that includes dumping him.\u201d</p><p>She looks a little forlorn and rests her elbows on the table with her chin in her hands. \u201cCan I ask you something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy did you quit your job this summer?\u201d she asks me.</p><p>I sit forward and reach across the table for her hands. \u201cAre you serious? That job was never for me.\u201d</p><p>She giggles. \u201cI was very surprised when you told me you were the wedding columnist for the LA Times.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hated every f**king minute of it, but like I told you, I was in a bad place. I needed money and wasn\u2019t thinking clearly. I didn\u2019t realize staying at that job was only adding to my unhappiness.\u201d</p><p>She sips her coffee as a couple of minutes of silence pass between us\u2014and with all that cream in it, by now it must be cold.</p><p>\u201cSo, how did you end up acquiring both Surfer\u2019s End and Sound Music?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, now, that\u2019s a story. . . .\u201d</p><p>Time rushes by as I open up to her in a way I haven\u2019t opened up to anyone in a very long time. I tell her about my time in Australia\u2014which led to my freelance gig for Surfer\u2019s End magazine and my eventual takeover of it once I had the money. I explain to her why I finally wrote the piece about the drug cartel that I had investigated\u2014because people deserved to know. I even tell her about training Trent before he went off to college in Hawaii with hopes to compete in surf competitions.</p><p>The large silver-rimmed clock on the wall has ticked past two a.m. when I notice her glance up at it.</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d I point to the watch I gave her. \u201cDoesn\u2019t that work?\u201d</p><p>She glances down at it. \u201cNo. It\u2019s stuck on seven o\u2019clock.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs the battery dead?\u201d</p><p>She shrugs. \u201cI\u2019m not sure. It just stopped working, but I can\u2019t stand not having it on my wrist.\u201d</p><p>Cocking my head to one side with a bemused expression, I find I have no words.</p><p>\u201cClosing time.\u201d The waitress slides the bill across the table.</p><p>S\u2019belle grabs for it.</p><p>\u201cI got it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, really, let me pay my share.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm . . . really, I got it.\u201d</p><p>She tosses her napkin on the table. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot taking that one?\u201d I point to the frayed white cloth near the pie plate.</p><p>She stands and pushes her hand against my chest. \u201cNo, it\u2019s not monogrammed.\u201d</p><p>Playfulness. Physical contact. Heat, lust, want, and need\u2014all bundled into that one innocent touch. I drop my gaze to where her palm rests, but this time before I can grab her hand to lead her out the door, she pulls it away.</p><p>I toss a twenty on the table and walk backward toward the exit. \u201cI got your number now. A discriminating thief.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t steal them. I borrowed them to clean up my car because I couldn\u2019t find any towels. I told you I\u2019m going to return them.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I open the door and let her pass. She takes the lead and I catch up. I make air quotes as I say, \u201cDiscriminating borrower.\u201d</p><p>A frown forms on her lips.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just screwing with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d she says, but I can see a sadness dwelling in her eyes.</p> <p>The walk back to her car is short. She unlocks her door as soon as we arrive. When I open her door, she hurries to get in.</p><p>\u201cRed . . .\u201d</p><p>She twists before sitting. \u201cYou do know my name is Bell? Don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>I shake my head in disbelief. \u201cYes, I know that.\u201d Of course I know her name, but she told me not to call her S\u2019belle the last time I saw her, so I came up with another suitable name for her.</p><p>\u201cOkay, just checking.\u201d She turns back around in her seat.</p> <p>I hover inside the car door, feeling a little nervous for some strange reason about what I\u2019m about to say. Finally I push it out. \u201cI want to see you again.\u201d</p><p>The lampposts above us cast shadows over her face and I\u2019m unable to read it. She hesitates for a beat before saying anything. But just then our eyes find each other and something passes between us. \u201cYou can call me, but I\u2019m not looking for anything but sex right now,\u201d she says.</p><p>If I said I wasn\u2019t shocked as shit by her words, I\u2019d be lying. I mean, what guy doesn\u2019t want to hear that? But for some reason I wasn\u2019t jumping out of my skin at her offer. The attraction between us is undeniable, and in fact I can feel the heat getting hotter with each passing moment\u2014the way her body reacts when I\u2019m close to her and the way mine aches to draw her near. But there\u2019s more than just a physical attraction. I can see she feels it too. It\u2019s in her eyes\u2014the way she looks at me.</p><p>As I\u2019m standing in her car door staring at her, trying to figure out where she\u2019s coming from, I realize what I saw in her eyes earlier wasn\u2019t hatred or loathing; it was trepidation. I know because I\u2019m looking at it again right now. And I understand that she has reason to be scared. I can\u2019t deny it. So I nod and whisper in her ear, \u201cWho am I to turn down an offer like that?\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 6</p><p>Dig In</p> <p>Bell</p><p>In a tangle of sheets, I toss and turn, stuck somewhere between the dreamworld and the real world. I can\u2019t get Ben Covington out of my mind. His intense blue-eyed stare. The black tuxedo tailored to his perfect body. A missing bow tie\u2014displaying a glimpse of a rebel. The man knew how to use his hands and mouth and I was completely charmed by him. I wanted more of what I know I couldn\u2019t have\u2014a bad boy my family would never accept.</p><p>My phone shrills from my nightstand. I jump, blindly reaching for it. Four rings later I finally grab it.</p><p>\u201cHello?\u201d My voice sounds raspy with sleepiness.</p><p>There\u2019s a slight sigh along with barely audible breathing, and a push of a button that alerts me that I\u2019m being taken off speakerphone. \u201cBell, are you still sleeping?\u201d Tate\u2019s voice asks in an eerily seductive tone.</p><p>I look around my dark room but see faint light through the blinds. I whip my head around and my eyes race to the digital clock beside me. It reads eight forty-five.</p><p>\u201cYes, sorry. Late night.\u201d</p><p>I hear a squeak of the chair. \u201cBaby, I miss you. Tell me what you have on.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTate, that\u2019s completely inappropriate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know but I\u2019m desperate. When are you going to forgive me? Please give me another chance.\u201d</p><p>I sit up and draw my knees to my chest. \u201cWe\u2019ve discussed this. We\u2019re over, Tate. We\u2019ve been over for a long time. Where is this coming from?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDino told me he saw you in the parking lot with some guy last night. Did you let him f**k you?\u201d His voice is cold and his question crude. One I would never answer truthfully to him, especially put like that.</p><p>\u201cTate, I\u2019ll be by in an hour to pick up the cake topper and bring it by Caroline\u2019s for her approval before I drop it off at the bakery. Do you need anything else before tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should have been here already. It\u2019s almost nine,\u201d he hisses.</p><p>I bow my head between my legs, so tired of the temper tantrums and mood swings. I think to myself, Not much longer. You can do this. Failure is not an option.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be there as soon as I can,\u201d I say, keeping my anger at bay and then hanging up.</p><p>Working for him has been a roller-coaster ride. It certainly didn\u2019t help that I mixed business with pleasure and started dating him\u2014made him my boyfriend. Almost a year ago now I came to work for him. Shortly after, right about the time my brother got married, he started asking me out and I didn\u2019t see any harm, so I said yes. By New Year\u2019s I was over him. We went on dates that always ended with make-out sessions in the car and good-byes at the door. I just wasn\u2019t attracted to him enough to sleep with him. One night he pushed for more. I threw him out and told him I would never go out with him again. The next day he apologized profusely and said it wouldn\u2019t impact our working relationship. And for the most part it hasn\u2019t. He\u2019s moody, sure, but he was like that before. He\u2019s also brilliant at his job and I\u2019ve learned so much from him.</p><p>Although to be honest I don\u2019t love event planning the way he does. At first I thought maybe it was just weddings I didn\u2019t care for, so I started my own consulting business. When I started out, I used to think of event planners as the man behind the curtain like in The Wizard of Oz. Magicians tasked with creating something fabulous out of a myriad of details, all the while making it look effortless for the client. However, it turns out that I\u2019m more like a firefighter dousing flames in every direction. But since failure isn\u2019t an option, I\u2019m going to stick with it. I finally found direction in my life and I\u2019m not going to let myself or my family down.</p><p>Rolling out of bed, I know I have to start my day. As I walk slowly toward the kitchen, I pray I have enough cream left for one cup of coffee. Then I can\u2019t help grinning. One very large cup of Starbucks coffee sits on my counter with a note in my mother\u2019s handwriting.</p><p>I was in the area, so I stopped by to check on you and drop a few things off. I didn\u2019t want to wake you. Pop the coffee in the microwave. Enjoy your day. Call me later.</p><p>Love, Mom</p><p>My family is amazing. I don\u2019t know what I\u2019d do without them. My mother and my stepfather, Jack, are always stopping by with things for my apartment, food, or just to check on me. I love the company. Leaving home wasn\u2019t as easy as I thought it would be. My mother knows what a hard time I\u2019ve had adjusting to living on my own, and since I haven\u2019t tried very hard to make this place a home, she\u2019s done it for me. She used to call first, but I told her she didn\u2019t have to. It\u2019s not as if I have anything to worry about. I haven\u2019t dated anyone since Tate. I decided to give up boyfriends and concentrate on myself for a while.</p><p>My brother River and I have always been close. I\u2019d go as far as to say he was my best friend for the longest time; maybe he still is. We were together so much when we were younger, people used to think we were twins. His wife, Dahlia, and I are also really close. In fact she is the only one who knows about what happened with Tate and also how I really haven\u2019t found my dream job. She wants me to quit and has been trying to get me to move in with her and my brother until I figure out what I want to do but um . . . no, thank you! I love them both to death but they are way too cutesy to live with full-time. I\u2019d be pulling my hair out. Actually, who am I kidding? I\u2019m jealous as anything and would love a relationship like that.</p><p>And my brother Xander, what would I do without him in my life? He\u2019s my rock, my voice of reason. He\u2019s always looked after me and guided me when I thought I was lost. But he\u2019s also stern and a bit of an ass at times. I have to say now that he has a girl in his life, he\u2019s softened . . . slightly. Ivy though, she\u2019s amazing and the best thing about her\u2014she makes Xander unbelievably happy and he deserves it.</p><p>Yep, I\u2019m the baby in my family, and they treat me like one . . . but I wouldn\u2019t trade any of them for the world. I pop my coffee in the microwave, and after it\u2019s warmed up, I truck to the shower to get ready to start my day.</p><p>Once I\u2019m dressed, I hop in my car and drive to work. My mind keeps wandering back to Ben, to last night. To his delicious body, what I saw of it, and the heat between us. To the way I wanted to touch him everywhere. How fast he got turned on and the things he whispered in the dark\u2014dirty, hot words in the heat of passion. And to how hard I came with him inside me. That had only happened once before\u2014and it was with him.</p><p>The Wyatt Events office isn\u2019t far from where I live in West Hollywood and I make it there in less than fifteen minutes. Even as I walk down the street, Ben\u2019s still on my mind. I wonder if he\u2019ll even call me. And if he does, what will I say?</p><p>As soon as I step through the modern space, I\u2019m startled out of my thoughts when Tate\u2019s voice booms loudly, \u201cBell, I need you in my office. Now!\u201d</p><p>I glance up at the clock\u2014ten after ten. I\u2019m really not late considering that I won\u2019t be home until at least ten o\u2019clock tonight. My gaze swivels to Josie, Tate\u2019s assistant. She\u2019s tall, almost as tall as my sister-in-law, Dahlia. She\u2019s waiflike with blond and blue hair\u2014her hair complements her pale blue eyes perfectly. She has a punk rock style that is killer. She took my place when I got promoted to consultant. Her eyes lock on mine and she ever so slightly shakes her head and mouths, \u201cPiss-ass mood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat,\u201d I mutter under my breath as I pass her and linger in the doorway.</p><p>\u201cCome in and close the door,\u201d he says.</p><p>He checks the time on his watch, then looks up at me sharply before his eyes drift down my gray dress all the way to the red patent leather pumps I\u2019m wearing. \u201cWhat are your plans after you go see the bride?\u201d His voice is calm and I\u2019m surprised.</p><p>\u201cI thought I\u2019d come back here and gather what we need for the venue.\u201d</p><p>He nods. \u201cI\u2019d like to take you to lunch. To discuss the evening\u2019s schedule of events.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure, of course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, then. Thank you for taking care of Caroline\u2019s insecurities about the topper. I\u2019m sure it will be fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a problem, Tate.\u201d</p><p>Just then my phone rings. I never switched it to vibrate because being summoned into his office was unexpected.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s all. I\u2019ll see you back here around noon and you pick the lunch spot.\u201d He slips on his reading glasses and directs his attention to the stack of papers on his desk.</p><p>\u201cHello?\u201d I pull my phone out of my purse to answer as soon as I step out of Tate\u2019s office.</p><p>\u201cHi there.\u201d Ben\u2019s voice flows through the line, warm like molasses, and I melt a little right there in the hallway.</p><p>\u201cHello,\u201d I say again before realizing I already said that.</p><p>He chuckles. \u201cI want to see you tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t. I have to work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen tomorrow night.\u201d He\u2019s not asking.</p><p>I know that we can\u2019t go any further than what happened last night. It\u2019s just not possible. But I already told him that. So like last night again\u2014sure, why not? One more time. Sex only. I can do that. \u201cSure, tomorrow night. I\u2019m at work now, so can I call you tomorrow with the details?\u201d</p><p>A laugh echoes through the line. \u201cI\u2019m calling you. How is it you\u2019re the one deciding on the plans?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I think you\u2019ll like what I have in mind,\u201d I coo to him. Josie\u2019s head snaps up and I drop my gaze to the floor, unable to look at her.</p><p>\u201cWhen you put it like that, how can I say no?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, I\u2019ll be in touch tomorrow. I have to go. Bye.\u201d I hang up and rush to my desk.</p><p>In a matter of minutes fingers are tapping on the wooden surface. \u201cSpill it,\u201d Josie says. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t right now. I have to go out to meet a client. But I\u2019ll catch you up on Monday, I promise.\u201d</p><p>She smiles at me. \u201cPlease tell whoever that was he is one lucky guy, because I\u2019ve never seen a look like that in your eyes before.\u201d</p><p>I shake my head and grab the topper before heading out the door.</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p> <p>After lunch with Tate, we arrive at the hotel to supervise the vendors setting up, answer questions, and discuss the couple\u2019s grand entrance, first dance, cake cutting, garter toss, and other details. As the time for the ceremony approaches, we head to the church to distribute the flowers and organize the wedding party. Tate cues the music to begin the ceremony while I keep the processional flowing.</p><p>From the ceremony we move quickly to the reception venue to ensure that the wedding party is in their appropriate places for photos to begin. I have to admit that when Tate is in the right frame of mind, we work well together. There\u2019s dinner, dancing, cake cutting, and finally the night comes to a close without any complications. One good thing about all the work has been that it\u2019s kept me from daydreaming about Ben. The way one hand expertly pinned me to the wall and the other roamed my body. The way he filled me, stretched me, and covered my mouth when I screamed out in ecstasy.</p><p>\u201cWant to grab a drink?\u201d Tate asks, tearing me away from my erotic memories.</p><p>\u201cNot tonight. I\u2019m really tired. It\u2019s been a long day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you seeing someone else?\u201d he asks.</p> <p>Exasperation overtakes me, but exhaustion overrules it. \u201cNo, Tate, I\u2019m not. My feet hurt. My calves ache. And I just want to go home. I\u2019ll see you Monday.\u201d I don\u2019t bother to explain that it wouldn\u2019t be someone else anyway since he isn\u2019t someone I\u2019m seeing. But that would just trigger his temper. I don\u2019t need that.</p><p>He nods affably, although his eyes pry into mine, looking for a lie. But there isn\u2019t one. I\u2019m not seeing anyone, by definition anyway, and I really am wiped out.</p><p>The funny thing about exhaustion is that it plays with your mind. I fall asleep easily but wake up constantly, each time after another dream about Ben. I\u2019m a damsel in distress and he saves me. I\u2019m a patient and he\u2019s my doctor. I\u2019m a naughty girl and he\u2019s my master.</p><p>The next day I decide to sleep in and spend the day lying around trying to keep my mind from wandering\u2014trying not to dwell on the incredible sex Ben and I shared the other night. How he took control, how he set the pace, how much I enjoyed that. How different he is from anyone I\u2019ve been with and how much I want him. I\u2019m obviously failing at erasing him from my mind and decide to get out for spin class to help chase away some of the pent-up energy I\u2019m feeling.</p><p>I come home and make my typical round of calls\u2014Mom, River, Xander\u2014and then I decide it\u2019s time for the not so typical call. With a shaky finger I find his number and tap it. Not even one full ring and Ben\u2019s voice, smooth and velvety, seduces me through the line. \u201cHi there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d I say, losing my ability to think coherently once again.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re on for tonight, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat time do you want me to pick you up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh no, you can\u2019t pick me up.\u201d</p><p>He chuckles. \u201cOkay, then, what is your plan?\u201d</p><p>My voice is shakier than my legs at this point. I know I don\u2019t have the courage to tell him my idea. \u201cI\u2019ll text you the details.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds mysterious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have to go, but I\u2019ll be in touch soon.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOkay,\u201d he says, and it almost sounds as if he\u2019s laughing.</p><p>I hit END and cradle the phone in my hands. I have to shed the sixteen-year-old smitten girl and be the woman I know he wants. I can do that. I know I can. So with renewed determination I type out what I was unable to say on the phone.</p><p>Since you seemed to enjoy saving the damsel in distress so much the other night, maybe you wouldn\u2019t mind helping a student out with a failing grade.</p><p>His response is immediate.</p><p>Are you asking for a favor? A grade reversal perhaps?</p><p>Good, he\u2019s going to play along.</p><p>I am and I\u2019m willing to meet you in the USC Library, fifteenth floor, third room on the right, to discuss my grade at nine tonight.</p><p>Just so you know, I don\u2019t change grades for just anyone or anything.</p><p>I didn\u2019t think he\u2019d have a problem with my little game. Ben has always been about sex, and since I can\u2019t seem to shake him, or get him out of my system, I\u2019ll give him what he wants one more time and then I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll never call me again. And even if he does I\u2019ll be able to say no\u2014 I have to.</p><p>I hop in the shower, scrub, shampoo, condition, shave, and moisturize. Once my body is smooth and silky, I pull my long locks into two low pigtails, find a white button blouse, a plaid skirt, a pair of low flats, and I\u2019m ready. I skip the underwear\u2014top and bottom.</p><p>I arrive on campus a little early and make my way to the study units. The first thing I notice when I enter the room is the glow of the moon and how it lights up the sky. My eyes adjust quickly to the darkness while I cross the small space to the window overlooking the city, leaning my head against the glass, trying to find the stars. But there are none to be seen tonight. I close my eyes and conjure up my own\u2014they look a lot like the ones in the sky the first night I spent with Ben so long ago. It was a night that changed everything but also a time when things felt much simpler to me.</p><p>\u201cBeautiful view,\u201d he whispers from behind me.</p><p>I jump at his voice, surprised he\u2019s already arrived.</p><p>\u201cTurn on the lights,\u201d he demands in a raspy, husky tone that makes my body clench with need.</p><p>I pause for a moment, drawing in a deep breath before moving back toward the door and flicking on the light. I also quickly lock the door. In the bright room my eyes dart to him hungrily. How could I think this time would be the last time? Whenever I see him I only want him more. He gives me that grin that makes my heart stop and I know immediately I won\u2019t be saying good-bye at the end of the night.</p><p>I take him in a little at a time\u2014he\u2019s perched with his broad shoulders leaning against the wall, hair rumpled but looking perfect nonetheless. His arms are crossed over his already unbuttoned shirt, displaying his lean, chiseled abdominal muscles. His jeans hang low, undone but not unzipped. Scrumptious, delicious, and mouthwatering. The tingling between my thighs signifies how ready I am for him.</p><p>\u201cDid you not like receiving a failing grade on your paper?\u201d he asks, keeping his voice low and steady.</p><p>My eyes lift back to his blue ones\u2014as calm and tranquil as the Pacific Ocean on a clear day. I swallow hard a few times before shaking my head no. Where are my damn words? Oh yeah\u2014stuck in my throat along with the lump from his imposing presence.</p><p>His mouth lifts up in a sexy grin and my toes curl from the look alone. This is dangerous territory. The more time I spend with him, the more time I want to spend with him. I can\u2019t seem to stop myself, but I know that soon enough I\u2019ll have to say good-bye.</p><p>He scans my body and his tongue flicks out in a way that not only sends a shiver down my spine but causes an almost unbearable ache between my legs. \u201cI can\u2019t seem to get enough of you.\u201d</p><p>I want to tell him he\u2019s out of character, but I can\u2019t. I want to say something back, but there are no words. Instead I just stare at him, already knowing I\u2019ll mourn his absence once we\u2019ve parted again. But I want him to remember me\u2014that\u2019s what this meeting is about.</p><p>He saunters over toward me. My ni**les peak into tight, hard buds and I\u2019m sure he can see them through the fabric of my blouse.</p><p>\u201cWhat grade do you want your paper changed to?\u201d he demands, standing right in front of me but not touching me.</p><p>I squirm at his tone, unable to believe how much it turns me on. \u201cAn . . . an . . . A.\u201d</p><p>He fondles the collar of my shirt. \u201cAn A? You\u2019re willing to work for this A?\u201d</p><p>I nod and stare into his eyes, already wild with desire.</p><p>He grins and unbuttons my shirt. \u201cI\u2019m going to kiss you slowly . . . starting with your neck . . . moving down your chest, then your tits . . . where I\u2019ll lick your ni**les. Do you think you can handle that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir. I can handle that,\u201d I answer in a mousy schoolgirl tone I\u2019m surprised I found.</p><p>\u201cGood, that should raise your F to a D.\u201d His mouth twists into a smile that I can\u2019t resist returning. He brushes my lips with his but quickly buries his head in my neck. I breathe in his clean soapy scent again and I feel his smile grow wider. His tongue drags across my skin, torturously slow, until he flicks his tongue around my nipple and finally laves it into his mouth. The fabric of my blouse hangs to the side and bares both br**sts.</p><p>I can\u2019t help moaning as he hungrily takes possession of my lips. Wet, hot, scorching, his mouth plunders mine and his tongue strikes against mine greedily. He\u2019s aggressive. Taking everything I have to give.</p><p>I kiss along his neck and drag my teeth across his shoulder. His fingertips trail up my leg and under my skirt. \u201cFuck,\u201d he mutters. \u201cYou\u2019re not wearing any panties again.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s out of character again, but that\u2019s okay. I kind of like that he can\u2019t keep his mind focused on the role. I\u2019ve never done anything like this and although it\u2019s hot as hell, concentrating on being his student is getting lost in the passion. It\u2019s being sucked up by the throbbing between my legs that I want satisfied by him.</p><p>When his fingers dip inside me, my moan is drowned out by his louder groan. \u201cYou\u2019re a good student. Are you only doing this for a better grade or because you\u2019re really bad underneath it all?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m a good student who hates a bad grade,\u201d I say softly. I\u2019m finding it easier to talk seductively in role-playing mode than as Bell Wilde.</p><p>He moves closer to the table and kicks the rolling chair out of the way. He tugs his jeans off and then his boxers. \u201cCome here,\u201d he demands.</p><p>I stare at him, in all of his glory. He\u2019s big, as I remember. I felt it the other night but didn\u2019t see it. Thoughts of taking him in my mouth empower me and I walk toward him, etching his n*ked body into my mind to keep it harbored in my thoughts forever. When I\u2019m close enough he takes my hand, but I reach for him instead. I want to feel the length of him, his girth as it grows larger. I want to taste him. I drop to my knees, but he immediately pulls me back up.</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t want to do that like this,\u201d he whispers in my ear. His voice is soft and normal. He\u2019s out of role again and it puts a more serious note in the encounter that I\u2019m not ready for. I have to get us back to playing.</p><p>\u201cOkay, but I really want that A.\u201d</p><p>He grins. \u201cI think you\u2019re well on your way to earning it. Sit on the table. Spread your legs,\u201d he says, his voice deep again. As soon as I\u2019m in position he pulls me to the edge. The length of him rubs against my belly, stirring the resting butterflies that always seem to be there ready to take flight. He takes his time\u2014milking the moment, drawing out the anticipation of what\u2019s to come.</p><p>When he pulls away I reach for him and he gives me a single moment of contact where I\u2019m in control. \u201cWrap your arms around my neck,\u201d he demands.</p><p>I do as he instructs, but in that second I felt his body tremble\u2014I saw the excitement clear in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cA nice girl like you shouldn\u2019t be taking my hard c**k inside yourself for a better grade.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you I want an A. I\u2019m determined.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d he asks, and I know he\u2019s out of role again, but I pretend he\u2019s not.</p><p>\u201cOh, professor, I\u2019m very sure.\u201d</p><p>In the next moment he reaches for his jeans and pulls out a condom. Once he rolls it on he plunges inside me and positions my hands in his on either side of us, flat to the table. Something about being restrained makes every thrust feel deeper, more intimate. Maybe it\u2019s because I\u2019m vulnerable, both physically and emotionally. Again he\u2019s in control, setting the pace, but I don\u2019t care. I just want to feel him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI love f**king you like this . . . you look so hot when your tits bounce up and down.\u201d</p><p>I wrap my legs around his waist and move as close to him as I can. I think I\u2019m practically off the table.</p><p>He gently licks my ear and blows his warm breath over it. His words come faster now. \u201cYour pu**y wraps my c**k so tight, your legs feel so good around me . . . and you like my tongue licking your ear, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, yes,\u201d I pant.</p> <p>Whether or not we\u2019re still role-playing doesn\u2019t matter to me anymore. I lose myself in him. In his dirty mouth. He tugs at my lip and I tug back. Then I press my mouth to his and attack it as hungrily as he has attacked mine. I\u2019ve heard girls say, \u201cI f**ked him with my mouth,\u201d but I never knew how that could make sense\u2014until this moment. I moan loudly and call out his name a few times and I\u2019m pretty sure he\u2019s just as far gone as I am.</p><p>In fact, I know he is when he stops my assault on his lips to whisper in my ear, \u201cI\u2019m so deep inside you, so close, I want to fill your pu**y up with my hot come. . . . Would you like that?\u201d</p><p>I wet my lips, my chest rising and falling rapidly. I nod and answer truthfully, \u201cYes, yes!\u201d Goose bumps form all up my arms. I cry out this time more frantically, \u201cYes, yes, yes!\u201d and he does the same as we ride out the wave of unbelievable pleasure we\u2019ve found together.</p><p>CHAPTER 7</p><p>Maybe Tomorrow</p> <p>Ben</p><p>I can hear the sound of the seagulls above me as my feet hit the sand. I feel the burn\u2014five miles barefoot on the beach has never felt so good. I take the steps two at a time and plop myself on a lounge chair up on the deck, watching the tops of the palm trees sway back and forth and the waves crashing against the shore. I\u2019m drenched with sweat and decide a shower before coffee is in order.</p><p>Opening the glass door to my house, I catch my reflection and think about how the last couple of nights have been somewhat of a mind f**k. While I thought I would be closing the book to my past, instead I opened a new chapter. It feels ironic that the first time I\u2019m more than just hot for a girl she shuts me down, only offering sex. I know I\u2019m not the most romantic guy on the block and haven\u2019t always taken women\u2019s feelings into account, but something doesn\u2019t feel right about a sex-only relationship with S\u2019belle. There\u2019s something else there; I can feel it between us. But she keeps pulling back and distancing herself. And since I\u2019m no expert on women, I\u2019m at a loss as to figure out what comes next.</p><p>I hadn\u2019t been with a woman since the night I was arrested. And being with S\u2019belle\u2014well, felt f**king amazing. Although I hadn\u2019t counted the long days, I do the math quickly\u2014yeah, that\u2019s seven months without sex, a shit ton of time. Celibacy wasn\u2019t a conscious goal. But I\u2019d had my share of too many faceless women. Booze and random hookups, they always went hand in hand. Give up one\u2014you give up the other. The drinking clouded my judgment, and the women were just warm bodies. I wasn\u2019t moving forward living that life. I knew I had to stop and I did.</p><p>I had pulled my shit together. I started my own company, one with a goal I\u2019m passionate about\u2014helping struggling publications. I want to breathe life back into words, making magazines that improve people\u2019s lives relevant. And I hope that\u2019s what I\u2019m doing.</p><p>Now I have this crazy, absurdly sexy goddess wanting to role-play with me and no strings attached. I know that she\u2019s been trying to appear tough, but I\u2019ve seen the vulnerability clear in her eyes. I know it has to be either because she doesn\u2019t trust me or maybe because she doesn\u2019t see me as dating material. Fuck.</p> <p>I look up at the towering fifteen-year-old ficus tree in the middle of the two-story atrium and think, Am I dating material? What the f**k? Now I\u2019m asking a tree. But it is what sold me on the place. Well, the tree and the carefree beach vibe\u2014they make the house feel alive. From an outsider\u2019s point of view, it must look like the perfect bachelor pad. A circular sofa, a sunken dining area, and bleached walnut floors surrounded by shaggy Moroccan rugs and alabaster lights. Stylish, rogue, sophisticated. The Realtor said it would make any woman\u2019s heart skip a beat. Funny, the only women I\u2019ve had here are my sister and the housekeeper.</p><p>I make my way into my bathroom, thinking about when I should call S\u2019belle and whether to tell her I want more of a relationship. The shower tile feels cool underneath my toes and I turn the water on. Muscles aching, I bend my neck to let the hot water massage away the tension. As the warm heat sprays down, I close my eyes and see her. Red hair tumbling over her shoulders, an effervescent smile that does something to my chest, small but fierce\u2014she\u2019s got an innocent quality, but it doesn\u2019t diminish her seductive allure at all. She\u2019s many things and I can\u2019t quite determine which of them I\u2019m more fascinated by.</p><p>I shut the water off, towel myself dry, and slide on a pair of sweats\u2014thankful it\u2019s Sunday. Fuck, I\u2019m horny just thinking about her and I start to second-guess myself. Maybe a casual affair is just what I need right now. My c**k grows hard at the memories and demands my attention. Fuck, I\u2019ve been h**ing s*x with myself for so long, it\u2019s strange to think I have someone to call. And not just someone\u2014the woman I\u2019ve never forgotten since our first time together.</p><p>I pull my sweatpants down and kick them off. Running my hand down my stomach, I wrap it around my dick and think of how it felt to be inside her. I stare at the ceiling and pump slowly from my balls to my tip, thinking of the noises she made when I touched her, how she screamed when I f**ked her.</p><p>My breathing comes in short bursts as the past blends with the present and images of her then and now pass through my mind. Her tongue, her mouth, her sweet pu**y. My bed is still unmade from my restless night\u2019s sleep and I settle my head on a pillow, bending my legs to push my h*ps up and pump my fist harder, faster. After a few minutes, I slow my hand to prolong the pleasure, but thoughts of her thrusting her h*ps into mine rush my need for release. I arch my back and tip my head, letting the feeling absorb me as I come. But it\u2019s not even close to how I felt last night when I was with her.</p><p>Rising from the bed, I hop back in the shower. This girl does crazy things to me. I can\u2019t get her off my mind, and just thinking about her gets me all worked up. Thinking what the hell? I open the shower door and grab my phone off the counter to text her.</p><p>I want to take you out tonight.</p><p>Her response is immediate.</p> <p>At brunch with my family. I\u2019ll be in touch in a bit.</p><p>I take a deep breath. Okay, focus, Ben. I try to think about all I have to accomplish in the next month before the announcement of my takeover, but my mind keeps reeling back to her. Something is going on in my head. I have an urge to fill the empty void of loneliness that has loomed within the depths of my soul for far too long. Fuck, that\u2019s dramatic. What the hell is wrong with me?</p><p>I hurry out of the shower and get dressed for the second time in thirty minutes. If focusing won\u2019t work I\u2019ll refocus. I grab my laptop and take it outside and attempt to throw my mind as far into my work as I can. I finish up the draft press release announcing my company, Plan B, and its holdings to the public. Then I glance down at my phone to make sure I haven\u2019t missed a call or a text. I stare at the screen waiting for her to get back with me\u2014if this isn\u2019t a chick move, I don\u2019t know what is.</p><p>\u201cI knocked,\u201d a voice says over my shoulder.</p><p>I glance up. \u201cI didn\u2019t hear the door. Sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo worries, I let myself in,\u201d Serena says.</p><p>\u201cYou on your way to the airport?\u201d</p><p>She puts her hand on my shoulder. \u201cYes, Jason and Trent went ahead to get the luggage checked in. We were running really late but I had to stop and say good-bye.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd check on me?\u201d I shoot my sister an inquisitive glance.</p><p>\u201cNo, well, yes.\u201d She looks down at me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine. Really I am. I\u2019m glad that part of my life is behind me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it?\u201d</p><p>I set my laptop on the table beside me and plant my feet on the floor. \u201cCaleb talking to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d</p><p>I roll my eyes.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to tell you what to do, Ben. Just think about it first.\u201d</p><p>I study her expression. No judgment, just concern. \u201cFair enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe you\u2019re doing work on a gorgeous day like today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, if you\u2019d stop stalling and come to work for me, I wouldn\u2019t have to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can hire anyone. You don\u2019t need me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I do. Your mind is like a computer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, it is. I mean, come on, you have a love affair with the number twelve.\u201d</p><p>Her hands go to her hips. \u201cYou know it\u2019s my lucky number.\u201d</p><p>Laughing, I toss my phone on the chair. \u201cYes, and why exactly is that? Because you\u2019re the biggest geek on the planet. And I need the biggest geek to work for me. Social media and apps. Think about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m really not that savvy. I just like numbers, especially even ones. And come on, I\u2019m thirty-six and this is turning out to be an amazing year.\u201d</p><p>I raise an eyebrow, questioning what that means.</p><p>\u201cThirty-six is divisible by twelve.\u201d She beams at me.</p><p>That sounds like something S\u2019belle would say, and the thought makes me laugh. \u201cLike I said, you\u2019re the biggest geek on the planet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGotta run,\u201d she says, kissing my cheek and avoiding my umpteenth request for her join me at Plan B.</p><p>I shove my hands in my pockets and shake my head, watching her take off down the wooden steps. \u201cTell Trent to call me,\u201d I yell after her.</p><p>\u201cI will,\u201d she calls back.</p><p>I rush to the railing. \u201cAnd, Serena . . .\u201d</p><p>She stops in the sand and raises her hand over her forehead to shield herself from the sun\u2019s glare.</p><p>\u201cI love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you too.\u201d</p><p>My sister and I have always been close. I know why she loves the number twelve. It\u2019s not because it\u2019s an even number or because she loves how divisible it is\u2014it\u2019s because that\u2019s how old she was when our father was killed. I was only five and my memories of him aren\u2019t really that clear, but my sister\u2019s are. She always told me stories about how much fun we had together, and I think a small part of her will remain twelve so that her memories stay alive. Every day that passes I see how very much like our mother she is and I hope that I\u2019m just a little like my father.</p><p>With the sun directly overhead, I realize it\u2019s past noon and I should figure out where I want to take S\u2019belle on our date tonight. I snatch my phone and pace the planks of the deck. Fancy restaurant might be too stuffy. Casual might look as though I\u2019m cheap. Bringing her here will definitely look as if I just want to get in her pants. But she did say sex only. Having no f**king idea where to take her, I decide I\u2019m done waiting for her to call. It\u2019s not as though she can\u2019t take a call in front of her family.</p><p>I squint at the screen and press her name. When she answers on the first ring, I know I made the right choice.</p><p>\u201cHello?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRed, it\u2019s me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe who?\u201d But she asks in a way that I know she knows it\u2019s me.</p><p>\u201cBen . . . Ben Covington,\u201d I say to humor her.</p><p>There\u2019s silence for a few moments. \u201cOh, hey, Ben.\u201d She tries for casual, but there\u2019s something more than casualness in her tone.</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t heard back from you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, right.

Where the hell did that come from? It\u2019s the perfect spot.</p><p>She\u2019s quiet for the longest time, but I don\u2019t break the silence. I can play along a little too.</p> <p>\u201cSure, I can probably make it. What time?\u201d</p><p>Now I know I hear excitement in her voice. \u201cSeven.

I know she wants to see me too. If she\u2019s scared about going out with me, I\u2019m confident I can prove I\u2019m worthy. As soon I suggested we go to what she had already told me is one of her favorite places, I swear she purred at the mention. I\u2019ve got this.</p><p>CHAPTER 8</p> <p>Run Run Run</p><p>Bell</p><p>The mental anguish and sleepless nights have left me exhausted. So I decide on a quick nap after brunch to try to rid my mind of the thoughts I know I shouldn\u2019t be thinking, the idea of the two of us as a couple. However, my nap turns into an all-day siesta full of dreams of him. As I bury my head into my pillow, the sound of his voice keeps ringing over and over in my head. Red, it\u2019s me. Ben Covington. His voice through the line melted any resistance I was feeling toward the idea of seeing him for another date.</p><p>I still remember the first time the same thing happened in college. It was our first official conversation. And it was the first time he had strung those two perfect words together, his name, in a way that reverberated through the library and slid into my soul\u2014forever.</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>The library was filled with people. Hushed voices echoed through the huge space. The enormous arched windows in the back gave the vast space a feel of magnificence while also allowing a powerful amount of light to shine in. Rectangular wooden tables and artificial trees were scattered around, giving the place a more homelike feel. I spent a lot of time there and appreciated those touches. I was premed and biology was kicking my ass. So I often sought refuge in the library to study and help drill everything I needed to know into my brain. Deep within one of the stacks of books, I spotted him. He stood in one of the aisles, lost in his novel. He was the same guy who had captured my attention one night at a party, but who didn\u2019t even know I existed.</p><p>With his mop of shaggy blond hair and tall, lean, muscular body, he looked like a sexy, younger version of Ocean\u2019s Eleven\u2019s Rusty Ryan, and my pulse raced at being close to him. Something made me stop; I was frozen in place and couldn\u2019t pass him by. He seemed at ease leaning against the shelves, tapping the heel of his black suede sneaker against the mass of books behind him as he read. I wanted to see his face, so I lifted my sunglasses and let them rest on top of my head. Then I ambled along the aisle pretending I was looking for a book. I thumbed one out and slid my finger down the smooth binding, then shoved it back. I repeated this gesture, swinging a glance his way with each push and pull. I got closer to where he stood with every repeated motion. I was an arm\u2019s length away before I knew it, but he hadn\u2019t noticed. He was lost in his reading, blond hair falling over his eyes. He wore a plaid button-down shirt, untucked, and a pair of worn khaki shorts. Plaid would normally have been a total turnoff to me, but on him it just seemed to fit. Crazy thoughts whirled in my head of skimming the frayed edges of his shirt with my fingers or maybe even unbuttoning it.</p><p>A snort, almost a snicker, escaped his throat and I bit down on my lip at the sexy sound. He was laughing to himself about something he was reading. Watching his slow, easy grin made my pulse race. It just seemed so natural, without any pretense. When I ceremoniously took out my next book, I accidentally dropped it, I was so lost in watching him, in watching the seductive way his mouth tipped up at the corners. He glanced at me, meeting my gaze as he effortlessly bent to retrieve my book. I stared into his blue eyes, but only for a moment. His eyes were intense and I felt magnetized by his proximity. I could tell by the way he moved that he was sure of himself, full of confidence, but it seemed less like arrogance and more of ease. His hands gripped the book on the floor while my eyes swept up to his other hand, to the spine of the book he was holding. He was reading The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, and seeing its title rendered me utterly speechless. What an odd book to be reading with such in-depth interest, I thought.</p> <p>That slow, easy grin that had to melt every girl\u2019s heart turned into a smirk. \u201cKama Sutra,\u201d he said, raising an eyebrow.</p><p>I wasn\u2019t really listening. I didn\u2019t hear what he said. My heart pounded as my gaze swiveled from his book to his face\u2014tanned skin, eyes bluer than the sky, cheeks flecked with just the right amount of stubble. He was rugged and handsome and hot.</p><p>My voice sounded dry. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Illustrated version of A Lover\u2019s Guide to Kama Sutra. You\u2019re looking for help? In a library?\u201d he asked in utter seriousness.</p><p>\u201cNo, no. No, I\u2019m not.\u201d Horrified, I grabbed the book from him and shoved it onto a shelf. But I noticed that my skin tingled where it had brushed his. Of all the books in the world, that\u2019s the one that I had to be touching\u2014are you kidding me? It took me a few seconds to collect myself, but somehow I kept the conversation going.</p><p>I pointed to his book. \u201cHomework?\u201d I asked, raising an eyebrow.</p><p>He lifted his hands surrender-style, the book still gripped tightly. My eyes shot to the bare skin that showed between his shirt and shorts and I began to feel flushed when an ache radiated between my thighs.</p><p>\u201cNo. You caught me. Just hiding out reading one of the classics. Fucking Huck Finn. Something he said turned my mind in a way it shouldn\u2019t have.\u201d He laughed.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I asked. My curiosity had been piqued.</p><p>\u201cHave you ever read it?\u201d</p><p>I shook my head no.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t judge me, then,\u201d he said, his voice deep and husky. He opened the book and recited the line that had him cracking himself up. \u201c\u2018That is just the way with some people. They get down on a thing when they don\u2019t know nothing about it.\u2019\u201d</p><p>The way the words rolled off his tongue\u2014it was hot; he was hot. I knew what he was laughing about and my heart thudded in my chest as I tried not to giggle. I moved closer, drawn to him. As soon as our eyes locked again, there was a moment of pure vulnerability, and the silence that wrapped itself around us seemed to speak volumes. Or that was what I thought until he blinked and handed me the book.</p><p>\u201cYou should read this if you have time. It really is one of the best books ever written.\u201d</p><p>I did giggle at that. \u201cRight. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s up there next to Tom Sawyer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d you know?\u201d He winked.</p><p>My stomach fluttered with desire and I couldn\u2019t help grinning.</p><p>He started to walk backward and I really wanted him to stay. When he stopped at the end of the aisle, I thought he\u2019d changed his mind. But instead what he did captured my heart. He put both feet together and leaned forward slightly to gesture that he was tipping an imaginary hat and said, \u201cIt was nice talking to you . . .\u201d He paused, waiting for me to fill in the blank.</p><p>\u201cS\u2019belle,\u201d I finished for him, not knowing why I\u2019d gone with my nickname from my time abroad.</p><p>\u201cS\u2019belle.\u201d He grinned, the upward tilt of his lip making him even more charming. He stood straight again and I swallowed, meeting his gaze. I breathed out a sigh and before I could even ask his name, he disappeared around the corner.</p><p>I yelled, \u201cWait, I didn\u2019t catch your name.\u201d</p><p>From someplace in a distance I heard his deep husky voice call, \u201cBen, my name is Ben Covington.\u201d</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>\u201cBen, Ben Covington.\u201d They are the same words that traveled through the Crystal Ballroom and back into my heart a few nights ago. The same words that melted through the phone line a few hours ago. And the same words that make my body mold to the mattress right now with a want I shouldn\u2019t be feeling.</p><p>My fingers slide down my stomach on their own. My body trembles at just the thought of his kisses and the way his tongue flicked against mine with urgency. I circle my warm flesh and think about the desire that flows between us, the way he looks at me with those languid blue eyes, and his charming demeanor. And I know I have to satisfy this longing before I see him. A sigh escapes my throat as I apply pressure where I need it because there\u2019s no way I\u2019m sleeping with him at the restaurant. And there\u2019s no way I\u2019m bringing him back here or going to his house. All of those places are too intimate. No, we\u2019ll eat dinner together tonight and I\u2019ll plant the seed for one more rendezvous before I say good-bye.</p><p>CHAPTER 9</p><p>Towers</p><p>Ben</p><p>I cruise into Brentwood on my bike with plenty of time to spare. The town isn\u2019t that big and I locate the restaurant right away. The sign in front reading Valet Parking throws me for a loop. The name Pebbles had me envisioning a BBQ pit with picnic tables, but what I\u2019m looking at is anything but. A large curved window gives me a peek into the intimate setting inside. It looks pretty nice, which I\u2019m relieved about because I would have hated to take a girl to a dump on a first date.</p><p>I skip the valet since I don\u2019t like anyone touching my bike. I find a small parking garage around the corner and pull into it. I\u2019ve been to this town a few times, but the only thing I really remember about it is the white dogwood trees that line the streets. With my bike secure, I walk slowly down the street looking around at the small shops, all very different but inviting to passersby. The old-fashioned streetlights display banners that read MERRY CHRISTMAS. It\u2019s a little early for that\u2014isn\u2019t it?</p><p>The town looks to be a little larger than Laguna, and a bit quainter, but nowhere near as trendy or diverse. I pass a florist, some retail shops, a few galleries, and many restaurants and bars. People are walking as though they don\u2019t have a care in the world, just browsing, talking, and laughing. One store in particular catches my eye. It\u2019s a bookstore named Fiction Vixen. My love for old books draws me toward the two stacks in the large windows located on both sides of its front door. The books are displayed in a Christmas-tree-like fashion with strands of lights wrapped around them.</p><p>Arriving at Pebbles, I pull open the heavy glass door only to find that the place is crowded. I weave my way through the people waiting in the entry and stop at the hostess station.</p><p>\u201cCan I help you?\u201d the cute girl says.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like a table for two.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you have a reservation?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, do I need one?\u201d</p><p>She glances down at the book of names in front of her. \u201cI\u2019m sorry but you do. We\u2019re full tonight.\u201d</p><p>I lean down. \u201cAre you sure you can\u2019t find a small table for two tucked away somewhere? It\u2019s just that this is my first date with a girl and I was really hoping to impress her. I don\u2019t want to look like the jackass I am for forgetting to make a reservation.\u201d I quirk a smile and stand a little closer.</p><p>She glances up at me and her eyelashes flutter. \u201cThat\u2019s really sweet. Let me see what I can do.\u201d</p><p>She scans the seating chart before her.</p><p>\u201cHow about right there?\u201d I point.</p><p>\u201cOne of the window tables? Those are always the first ones requested.\u201d</p><p>I shoot her a wink. \u201cSo my date would be really impressed if I got us one of those?\u201d</p><p>She smiles at me as she erases the name printed above the table. \u201cYour name, sir?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>With my biggest shit-eating grin I say, \u201cBen. Ben Covington.\u201d</p><p>As she leads me to the table, we pass a granite-topped bar where a few couples perched on the stools are lost in deep conversations\u2014hands on knees, faces a little too close, hooded eyes. I remember thinking just recently the only girl I ever came close to flirting with besides my long-term girlfriend was S\u2019belle. But maybe that wasn\u2019t entirely true. Then again, it depends how you define flirting. To me it means you have game in mind. With the hostess I was just pouring on the charm, not trying to bed her. So I stand by the idea that I\u2019ve never really put myself out there in flirting mode. But something tells me I\u2019m about to before the night ends.</p><p>\u201cLet me know if I can help you with anything else,\u201d the hostess says before leaving me at a table near the window with two menus.</p><p>I check the time on my phone; it\u2019s seven twenty-seven. I sit here wondering if maybe S\u2019belle isn\u2019t going to show and find my nervousness disconcerting. Not a minute ticks by before I spot her. Her back\u2019s to me and she\u2019s talking to the hostess. The lights from the street cast shadows on her long red hair. But it\u2019s as vibrant as ever against her bare back. She pulls it to one side as she laughs at something the hostess says. Oh, f**k, is that girl blowing it for me? She twists in my direction as the hostess points over to me. Fuck, I think I\u2019m busted.</p> <p>I stand up and she smiles at me. My body hums at the sight of her approaching me\u2014she\u2019s wearing a halter top that reveals a hint of cle**age and tight jeans that hug her shape perfectly with the highest f**king heels I\u2019ve ever seen. She sashays toward me and the thin gold chains hanging over her shapely chest swing back and forth. She isn\u2019t a girl anyone could pass by without drooling over. I consciously close my jaw that I know is hanging open. At our table her eyes look me over\u2014head to toe. I see it plain as day and I have to pull back the knowing grin from my lips.</p><p>\u201cHi there,\u201d I say with a grin, and lean in to kiss her.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d she answers, turning her face so my mouth lands on her cheek.</p><p>\u201cYou look beautiful.\u201d I\u2019m trying my best not to be affected by the kiss snub.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she says softly, and there it is\u2014that look of innocence that sets my body ablaze. Okay, I\u2019ll let the snub pass. Who knows? Maybe she has some crazy role-playing game cooking in her head.</p> <p>I extend my hand and she places hers softly in my palm so that I can bring her hand to my lips and kiss it. Her smile is wide and bright as I let her hand go.</p><p>\u201cMadam,\u201d I say as I pull out her chair. Maybe I could be the ma\u00eetre d\u2019 and she could be a demanding patron?</p><p>She sits and sets her phone on the table and her purse on the floor. When she sits back up, I breathe in her scent as I take her napkin and place it on her lap. Leaning down, I let my warm breath caress her neck. \u201cIn case you want to add it to your collection before it gets dirty.\u201d</p><p>She looks up at me. \u201cVery funny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI try to be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I think you try to be more than that.\u201d</p> <p>I raise an eyebrow. \u201cPlease explain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKelsie told me how charming you are.\u201d</p><p>There must be a puzzled look on my face. \u201cThe hostess,\u201d she clarifies.</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cAh yes. She was very . . . helpful.\u201d</p><p>Her mouth tilts with the beginning of a smile.</p><p>I lean even closer, hovering just above her lips. \u201cI can be . . . very helpful too. Especially to damsels in distress and failing students.\u201d</p><p>A slight pink blush colors her skin, and it\u2019s such a turn-on that she can play dirty but gets embarrassed talking about it.</p><p>Our eyes lock for a few intense moments until I break the spell. \u201cSo, how was your Sunday?\u201d Just like that the night begins like a real date. The funny conversation leads into discussions about our day, and when the waitress approaches to take our order, we both ask for sparkling water with lemon and peppered beef skewers.</p> <p>S\u2019belle looks over toward me when the waters are placed in front of us. \u201cYou don\u2019t drink?\u201d</p><p>I cast her a tentative look. \u201cI do. Well, I don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>She scrunches her eyebrows in confusion.</p><p>I laugh. \u201cThat sounded moronic. What I mean is I don\u2019t have a problem or anything. I just think it\u2019s healthier for me to abstain.\u201d</p><p>She doesn\u2019t laugh or question why, but instead she says, \u201cI get it. Same here. I had fallen into a rut where I was drinking more than I should and I found I wasn\u2019t moving forward in my life.\u201d</p><p>I nod and swallow the lump in my throat at how much what she just said mimics my life over the past three years. I look at her and raise my glass. \u201cPerfectly said.\u201d</p><p>We end the topic there, but that short conversation tells me we might have more in common than either of us realizes. I look across the table at her. The glow of the candle, the intimacy of the small space, the seductive outfit she\u2019s wearing\u2014everything makes me want to get closer to her.</p><p>Her phone buzzes and I can see the name Tate Wyatt flash across the screen. She silences it and switches her phone to vibrate. \u201cSorry. We have a big wedding next weekend and I\u2019m sure Tate is already pondering the to-do list.\u201d</p><p>I try to read her. She seems nervous or maybe just uncomfortable. \u201cWell, that only proves my point\u2014he\u2019s an ass**le.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBen. You don\u2019t even know him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve seen and heard enough.\u201d</p><p>She shakes her head. \u201cTell me something about your job.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I got awesome news today. My buddy Beck finally found someone to run his father\u2019s bar and is coming to work for me full-time this week.\u201d I lower my voice as I finish the sentence. It\u2019s a casual move. Almost too smooth. With the overhead music providing ambience and the bar so close to us, it is loud and I\u2019m keeping my voice softer than I normally speak.</p><p>She leans forward. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry, but I can\u2019t hear you very well.\u201d</p><p>I slide into the empty chair next to her and repeat myself. \u201cMy buddy Beck finally found someone to run his father\u2019s bar and is coming to work for me full-time next week.\u201d This time I speak directly into her ear and savor the closeness. I\u2019m supposed to be flirting with her, in charge here, but her scent overwhelms me and the thumping in my heart seems to have spread throughout my body. She\u2019s turning me on beyond control.</p><p>She inches away from me, but I can see her pulse beating in her neck. \u201cWhat does he do?\u201d she asks a little hoarsely. I\u2019ve heard that tone before.</p><p>Her hands are on her glass gripping it tightly. One slides to the table.</p><p>I grab my water and our hands graze but don\u2019t fully touch. The heat of her hand seeps down my arm\u2014electric. \u201cHe\u2019s a whiz at social media. He\u2019s just what I need to push forward and embrace the technology side of journalism.\u201d</p><p>Her breathing picks up and her green eyes bore into me. \u201cYou mean like apps, Twitter, and Facebook\u2014social media?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Both Surfer\u2019s End and Sound Music are so behind they don\u2019t even have issues available online or apps to accompany them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, you don\u2019t know how to do that yourself?\u201d</p><p>Our salads arrive. I take my fork in my hand. \u201cNo, I have no idea how to do something like that.\u201d</p><p>She stabs her fork into a cherry tomato. \u201cI do. I taught myself. It\u2019s really fun. Last week I created one for my event-planning company,\u201d she says, and this surprises me for some reason.</p><p>I lean forward on the table, bringing our bodies even closer together. \u201cAre we role-playing?\u201d</p><p>She breathes a breathy sigh. \u201cNo, I\u2019m serious.\u201d</p><p>Now I\u2019m really curious. \u201cI\u2019d love to hear about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s no big deal. I designed an app for clients to download so they can create their dream event. I use it as a start for planning. Most of the time clients have no idea what they want, so the app helps me understand them a little better.\u201d</p><p>I ponder what she\u2019s talking about for a moment. \u201cSo you know what your clients want before they do?\u201d</p><p>A huge smile crosses her lips. \u201cYeah, I guess I do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s f**king brilliant.\u201d</p><p>She shrugs. \u201cIt was easy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe I should hire you, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not interested in running a magazine.\u201d</p><p>I nearly spit a piece of lettuce out of my mouth. \u201cI mean to help launch Plan B\u2019s holdings into the social media arena.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I could show Aerie.\u201d</p><p>A devilish smile crosses my lips at the thought of the outburst that would come if I gave Aerie one more thing to be responsible for. Rattling her can be so much fun. \u201cI think she has enough on her plate.\u201d</p><p>S\u2019belle sets her fork down. \u201cYou get along with her?\u201d</p><p>I nod. \u201cYes, we work well together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you met Jagger?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI actually met him when I lived in New York City. Small world that we\u2019re both here now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s my cousin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d I smile.</p><p>\u201cYou do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, he told me. He stops by the office once in a while to have lunch with Aerie, so we\u2019ve kind of reconnected.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did you meet? In New York City, I mean.\u201d</p><p>At this point I\u2019m not sure how much to tell her but decide to just tell the truth. \u201cHe was dating the sister of a girl I was somewhat seeing back then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Her face drops. Then her phone vibrates on the table and she glances at the screen. \u201cExcuse me one minute. I really should take this.\u201d</p><p>I nod, thinking I\u2019d love to know what that ass**le\u2019s problem is.</p><p>She gets up and walks over toward the bar. I watch her body tense, but she quickly ends the call. When she comes back to the table, she doesn\u2019t make mention of him but resumes eating her salad quietly and I do the same. She squeezes more lemon into her drink and then onto her lettuce. I\u2019m so intrigued by her I can\u2019t resist staring.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d she asks.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nothing.\u201d</p><p>She sips the glass of sparkling water and her head tips back slightly to expose the seductive lines of her throat and chest. I think for a moment she\u2019s moving that way on purpose\u2014maybe flirting with me.</p><p>I drag my mind off her body and bring my eyes back to hers. \u201cSo, you\u2019re pretty busy at work?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBusy isn\u2019t even the right word. It\u2019s crazy right now. So many weddings and Tate keeps pushing more onto me. Plus, I\u2019m trying to get my own business off the ground.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you have a name for it?\u201d</p><p>She laughs. \u201cBelieve it or not, no. I\u2019m not so sure it\u2019s what I want to do. Giving it a name and then abandoning it somehow seems more like a failure. I have one more event planned for the rest of the year and it\u2019s Ivy\u2019s release party. And I got that job because she\u2019s my brother\u2019s girlfriend. I actually got the job with Tate because he knows my stepfather.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you love it? Event planning?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s what my family thinks I\u2019m good at.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about you? What do you think?\u201d</p><p>She shrugs. \u201cSome direction is better than none.\u201d</p><p>At that I want to take her into my arms, to reassure her that she should do what she wants. She\u2019s strong, confident, and has what it takes to succeed in anything. But just as I reach across the table, two steaming plates of peppered beef skewers and island rice are placed in front of us. We both push our salads to the side.</p><p>\u201cSmells so good,\u201d she says, and from the look in her eyes she\u2019s hungry for more than food.</p><p>\u201cYou just ate them a few days ago,\u201d I point out. \u201cI hope you aren\u2019t going to be sick of them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I never eat the food I cater in.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I nearly choke on a piece of pineapple in my rice. \u201cWhy is that? Because I have to say now I\u2019m almost afraid to ask. And even more afraid to eat this.\u201d</p><p>She giggles. \u201cIt has nothing to do with the food. I just have to smell it all night, so by the time I get a chance to eat, the last thing I want is what\u2019s been under my nose for hours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI get it. I guess. So, who are the guys who carried the empty pans to your car?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMatt and Dino? They work for me when I need help.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe taller one, I think he has the hots for you,\u201d I tease her.</p><p>Her eyes dart to mine. \u201cWe\u2019re just friends. He\u2019s not interested in me.\u201d</p><p>I nod, thinking she must be blind if she doesn\u2019t see it. \u201cSo you don\u2019t have a boyfriend?\u201d</p><p>She bites her lip. \u201cNo. I wouldn\u2019t have . . . well, you know . . . if I did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do know.\u201d I give a low laugh, trying not to growl at the visions her words elicit.</p> <p>She drops her gaze and her hair falls across her face. \u201cDo you have any specific fantasy you\u2019d like fulfilled?\u201d she asks. \u201cWorking girl, sex slave, nurse?\u201d</p><p>Her words come out fully charged, arousing me instantly. Fuck me if my c**k doesn\u2019t start to throb beneath the denim of my jeans. But as I sit here looking over at her, my answer on the tip of my tongue, the reality of it all comes crashing down on me. I suddenly see through the curtain of red. She\u2019s trying to be who she thinks I want her to be. Just like her job. She\u2019s doing what she thinks she should do. And I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m insulted or flattered, but I do know the games are over.</p><p>My words come out in a biting tone. \u201cWhat if that\u2019s not what I\u2019m looking for?\u201d</p><p>Her brow creases with tension as her eyes lift back up to my face. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if I want more than a game and a quick f**k in a secluded location?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s not what I\u2019m looking for. I told you that.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat are you looking for?\u201d</p><p>She shrugs. \u201cNot something I know will never work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know that if you\u2019re not willing to see what happens?\u201d I try not to sound insulted.</p><p>\u201cCome on, Ben. We both know the only thing that will work between us is sex.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, shit, I guess you have it all figured out. Okay, then, I choose the john. Why don\u2019t you go on into the bathroom and I\u2019ll be in in a minute? Just tell me how much up front.\u201d</p><p>She gapes at me in disbelief.</p><p>\u201cWhat? You asked. I\u2019m telling you. No need to finish dinner. Let\u2019s f**k and get it out of our systems\u2014for today anyway.\u201d</p><p>She shrugs again with clear disappointment. \u201cI\u2019m not f**king you here.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGood, then. Can we finish our dinner and our date?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you testing me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019m trying to show you that maybe there is more and maybe you could at least give me a chance before you make assumptions about me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, then, so if sex isn\u2019t the only thing you\u2019re after from me, how about we start over?\u201d There\u2019s a strange twinkle in her eyes that looks a lot like a challenge.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing I\u2019d like more,\u201d I say, suppressing the urge to reveal the satisfaction I feel at her words.</p><p>\u201cAs friends only,\u201d she adds as if it just occurred to her.</p><p>I try not to let my jaw drop. Obviously she thinks I can\u2019t go without sex. She doesn\u2019t know me as well as she thinks she does. \u201cFine. Friends only.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSince we agree, I think we need to set some guidelines.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGuidelines?\u201d I raise an eyebrow in challenge.</p><p>She nods and her hair bounces effortlessly over her shoulder with her movement. \u201cYes, guidelines.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you set these guidelines with all the men you call friends? Matt? Dino?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. But I haven\u2019t slept with them either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, then.\u201d It\u2019s easy to agree because I\u2019m beyond relieved to hear that.</p><p>She eats a few bites and I watch her, waiting to hear these guidelines, mostly because I\u2019m intrigued.</p><p>\u201cAre you going to tell me what they are?\u201d I finally prompt.</p><p>She pats her lips with her napkin. \u201cOh yes, of course. One,\u201d she says, holding up her thumb, \u201cwe can be friends as long as we keep it between us.\u201d</p><p>I guess I understand. Only two people in my life know I\u2019m interested in S\u2019belle, and I got all kinds of warnings from them. But really I want to laugh that I\u2019ve become a dirty little secret.</p><p>\u201cTwo.\u201d She holds up her index finger. \u201cWe will not talk about my brother or his wife.\u201d</p><p>She licks the sauce off her finger when she\u2019s done speaking\u2014and if she only knew how turned on I am watching her. This friends thing might be harder than I think. But I keep quiet and don\u2019t argue. And besides, I have no intention of discussing my ex-fianc\u00e9e and her husband with her anyway.</p><p>However, I do have to stop her before she moves on.</p><p>\u201cRed, you can say Dahlia\u2019s name. I\u2019m fine with it and I think she\u2019ll be fine with us as well.\u201d I assume S\u2019belle already knows Dahlia and I have talked and that she\u2019s come to terms with the fact that I cheated on her with S\u2019belle in college.</p><p>She shakes her head fervently. \u201cI mean it, Ben. My family is not to know.\u201d</p><p>I hold my hands up. \u201cOkay, okay. I get it. What else?\u201d</p><p>When she puts a third finger up and it\u2019s her middle finger, I can\u2019t contain myself. I don\u2019t want to appear immature, but she is being so serious\u2014setting guidelines for a friendship that we both know is much more than that. I can\u2019t hold back as laughter escapes my lungs and I have to rest my hand on my stomach to try to stop myself.</p><p>She looks over at me before setting her hands on the table and pushing up. \u201cYou\u2019re so immature,\u201d she huffs.</p><p>\u201cWait, go on, I\u2019m good. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>She narrows her eyes at me. \u201cI\u2019m not joking around. I just got my life on track and I can\u2019t be derailed.\u201d</p><p>Okay, so again I\u2019m going to be the bigger person and not take offense, but why does she think I would derail her life? I run a hand through my hair as I consider how to respond. \u201cI hear what you\u2019re saying.\u201d I bring my hand down and rest it over hers on the table. \u201cBut, Red, you and I both know a friendship-only relationship isn\u2019t going to be easy.\u201d I inch forward and close my fingers around hers. Sparks ignite between us, and any anger I might have been feeling dissipates.</p><p>She pulls her hand away after a few seconds, but her trembling body tells me she feels what I feel. \u201cAnd three, no touching,\u201d she says quickly. Almost as though, if she didn\u2019t say it right, then she would change her mind. She goes on to add to her list that we can go out but we will meet each other in public places only.</p><p>I have to commend her; she\u2019s tough. But I can do this. I can see through it. She wants me to prove to her that I\u2019m looking for more. And I will. Who knows? It might even be fun. For sure, it will be a challenge.</p><p>She bites her lip and returns my stare. She\u2019s nervous. I shake my head and draw in a deep breath. \u201cI know you better than you think, you know.\u201d</p><p>And although I\u2019m not at all sure that her guidelines are realistic, I see them as her security blanket and for that reason I decide to accept them . . . for now.</p><p>She drops her eyes again.</p><p>\u201cRed, look at me. I know you bite your bottom lip when you\u2019re nervous. I know you\u2019re smarter than you like people to know. And I know that I\u2019d like nothing more than to prove to you that I can be your friend. So I\u2019ll agree to take it slow, but I can\u2019t agree to the no touching.\u201d My eyes skim her face and fall slowly to her chest before rising back up. The tension builds between us as the evidence of her arousal spreads across her chest in the form of a flush.</p><p>She stares at me for a while before speaking. \u201cIt\u2019s all or nothing,\u201d she says, her tone lightly squeaky.</p><p>I inhale a deep breath. \u201cLucky for you I\u2019m an all-or-nothing kind of guy.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes sharpen and she starts to sputter in a way that makes no sense. \u201cSo, um, is that a yes, a no . . . ?\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m pretty sure I\u2019ve flustered her. I sit back in my chair and try to figure out what we just agreed to, because like her I have no f**king idea. Then finally I give her a pointed stare. \u201cWhat happens to your guidelines when you change your mind about only being friends?\u201d</p><p>She swallows. \u201cI don\u2019t see it going that far,\u201d she says firmly.</p><p>I\u2019m okay with letting her think that . . . for the time being.</p><p>CHAPTER 10</p><p>I\u2019m Ready</p><p>Bell</p><p>Today is Monday, and with no events until Friday I need to get to the office on time. Maybe if I pull the covers over my head, time will reverse and give me another hour of dreaming. No such luck, I know. I stretch and stifle a yawn before swinging my bare feet down onto the hardwood floors. This morning feels particularly cold for California in October.</p><p>I pad to the bathroom and blast the hot water, brushing my teeth while I wait for it to warm. By the time I finally slink into the shower, the small bathroom has already filled with steam. If only the water could knead away all of my tension, but with a low-pressure shower and so many knots, my chances are slim. I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m doing with Ben anymore. How could I have thrown a friends-only relationship out there last night? First of all, that\u2019s not what I want and second, I should stay away from him. And what was he doing accepting my challenge? What if this fortifies our relationship instead of destroying it?</p><p>No, that won\u2019t happen. Chances are he\u2019ll never call me again after last night anyway. I reach for the shampoo and scrub my head before conditioning. I skip the shaving\u2014no need for that and I\u2019m the only one to blame. Rushing around, hoping to put some distance between myself and my thoughts, I concentrate on getting ready. I slide into a pair of comfortable underwear and a no-frills bra, pull a dark gray jersey knit dress over my head, and slip into a pair of black boots, skipping the hose. I run to the kitchen to check the time and decide to go light on the makeup to have time for Starbucks. I dry my hair into a sleek curtain, swipe some blush on my cheeks, a little lip gloss and mascara, and I\u2019m ready to go.</p><p>With my leather jacket in hand I grab my keys and rush back to my room for my phone. I hear the beep from it before I even cross the threshold\u2014two missed calls. One from my mother and the other from Ben. I head toward the door, thumbing to my voice mail and listening to his first.</p><p>\u201cLook, I thought we could maybe go out tomorrow night with Aerie and Jagger. Friends do that, right?\u201d A few seconds of soft breathing. \u201cGo out with other friends, I mean. Just to clarify. Let me know what you think. In the meantime I\u2019ll plan something.\u201d</p><p>I try not to stumble down the flight of stairs while I listen to the message. I play it again as I walk through the courtyard, this time absorbing the sound of his voice. Again I wonder, what was I thinking last night? Spending more time with him was just going to make this harder.</p><p>I listen two more times before moving on to my mother\u2019s message. She was just checking on me and wanted to know if I was interested in coming over for dinner tomorrow night. While I walk to my car I call my mother back to tell her I can\u2019t make dinner\u2014that I\u2019m having dinner with a friend. I just have to find a way to make sure Jagger doesn\u2019t tell my mother who the friend is and Aerie doesn\u2019t tell Dahlia either. Things are already getting messy. This is exactly what I didn\u2019t want. I should have just said no.</p><p>My phone rings as I circle the street looking for a close parking place. Working in West Hollywood has its advantages and disadvantages, and parking is definitely a disadvantage. I don\u2019t even look at the screen as I hit ANSWER on my steering wheel. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHi there.\u201d Ben\u2019s voice exudes seduction.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d I manage in a much more friendlike tone.</p><p>\u201cDid you get my message?\u201d His voice is low and sexy.</p><p>\u201cFriends don\u2019t talk to friends like that,\u201d I blurt out.</p> <p>\u201cLike what?\u201d He laughs, and the sound is almost like a caress that wraps around my bare legs and up my dress like a gust of wind.</p><p>\u201cSounding like sex.\u201d</p><p>He laughs even louder. \u201cNo one has ever told me I sound like sex, but I\u2019ll take that as a compliment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re doing it again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs this better?\u201d This time his voice is deeper, richer, but it still sounds velvety smooth to me and full of promise\u2014promises I\u2019ve taken off the table.</p> <p>\u201cYes,\u201d I agree because I think that even if he sounded drunk, exhausted, or disoriented, I\u2019d still feel the dampness spread between my legs from his voice alone.</p><p>\u201cGood. Okay, then.\u201d A soft chuckle escapes his throat. \u201cTomorrow night I\u2019ll pick you up at seven.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll meet you,\u201d I insist.</p><p>\u201cRed, that\u2019s ridiculous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBen, I\u2019ll meet you or I\u2019ll pass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine, I\u2019ll let you know where.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOkay. I have to go before I\u2019m late for work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee ya, Red,\u201d he says, and hangs up.</p><p>\u201cBye, Ben,\u201d I breathe over the empty line.</p><p>I find a spot a little farther away from the office than I\u2019d like and park. Grabbing the tray of coffees, I walk fast and pull open the showroom door. I look around in shock. It\u2019s a complete mess. Walls are down, drop cloths are everywhere, and Tate is leaning against my desk with his arms crossed. His face is unreadable. Tall, dark hair, suave, and always put together, he\u2019s a man of style and confidence, but he\u2019s also very self-absorbed and, as Xander says, a bit of an ass**le.</p><p>I stop quickly to drop a coffee off to Josie. \u201cGood morning.\u201d</p><p>Her back is to Tate, so she mouths, \u201cThank you. Piss-ass mood,\u201d while she rolls her eyes. I pass her desk and approach Tate with apprehension. I want to look at my watch, but it stopped a long time ago and pulling my phone out would be way too obvious.</p><p>I raise the tray. \u201cCoffee.\u201d I offer it to him with a smile.</p><p>He straightens and his suit hangs perfectly, tailor-made, I\u2019m sure. He looks at his watch before taking the coffee and then smiles. \u201cHow\u2019d you know I needed this?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIntuition.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr ass-kissing.\u201d</p><p>I shrug and let that pass without commenting on it. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on in here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTime for some renovations. The place needed a pick-me-up. I\u2019m thinking of trading the Harrods look for something more Vera Wang.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re trading the black-and-white toile for platinum modernism?\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly.\u201d He grins and raises his cup. \u201cI knew I hired you for a reason.\u201d</p><p>I toss my purse in my desk drawer and take a seat.</p><p>He walks toward his office and then turns. \u201cI\u2019ll be out of town until Friday. We have a new client coming in on Thursday that I\u2019d like you to take care of, so be on time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure, who is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRomeo Fairchild, the governor\u2019s son. His fianc\u00e9e is a wreck and he wants us to handle the entire wedding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat shouldn\u2019t be a problem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe wants the event to take place the day after Thanksgiving,\u201d he says, and his grin is lascivious.</p><p>Yeah, he can be a bit of an ass**le.</p><p>I watch him slam his door and catch Josie\u2019s glare. She averts her eyes to the break room and stands, heading that way. I nod and wait a few minutes before taking my coffee and joining her. The break room doubles as a meeting spot when the conference room is taken, so it\u2019s decorated to the nines\u2014bright orange focal wall, dark wooden table, white leather armchairs, and a large vase filled with artificial birds-of-paradise adorning the corner. I close the glass door behind me and take a seat, sipping my coffee while Josie stares at me.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s something different about you.\u201d Her eyes flicker over me.</p><p>I roll my eyes. \u201cYou\u2019re so dramatic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, that\u2019s the pot calling the kettle black.\u201d</p><p>I laugh. She\u2019s right. I usually am up and down with Tate\u2019s moods, but today I didn\u2019t let him bother me and it paid off. \u201cSo, what spurred the d\u00e9cor change?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t change the subject. Now spill it. Who were you talking to that got you all hot and bothered the other day?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was not hot and bothered.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh yes, you were.\u201d</p><p>I smile. \u201cWell, there\u2019s this guy I\u2019ve known for a while. The thing is, we have a sordid history and I didn\u2019t think getting involved with him was a good idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you f**k him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJosie!\u201d</p><p>She twirls a piece of blue hair around her finger. \u201cWell, did you?\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t answer and let my silence speak for itself.</p><p>\u201cHey, if he\u2019s good in bed and gives you that glow, I say screw the rest.\u201d</p><p>I laugh. She makes it sound so easy\u2014if only she knew.</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>Acab\u00e1r isn\u2019t that far from my apartment. In fact, it\u2019s even on Sunset, so I decide to walk. The two days since I\u2019ve seen him have felt more like two weeks and I can\u2019t wait to see him again. The sign is in my sights when I see him walking my way and smile broadly. White button-down shirt, slightly faded jeans, black boots, and that smile that makes the apex of my legs pulse. His mop of shaggy blond hair is disheveled and my guess is he rode his motorcycle\u2014as if he\u2019s not hot enough, visions of him riding his bike only send my body into overdrive.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d I say, trying to keep my voice even.</p><p>His eyes sweep me from my open-toed pumps, up my tight leather pants, right through my sheer silver top, to my straight hair with a few carefully placed waves. \u201cHi there,\u201d he says, and a slight growl follows his greeting.</p><p>I labored a long time on what to wear\u2014casual, businesslike, or dressy, but in the end decided on sexy.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t have to meet me outside,\u201d I say.</p><p>Before I can move back, lips land on my cheek. My mouth falls open at the sudden scorching heat between us and I stare at him, unable to speak.</p><p>His eyes drop and he shoves his hands in his pockets, but his lips quirk up. \u201cFriends wait for friends. Friends kiss each other on the cheek.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s pushing it, but I secretly don\u2019t mind it at all\u2014not that I\u2019d let him know that.</p><p>I push his shoulder back. \u201cI don\u2019t think friends let their tongue leave their mouth during a slight peck on the cheek.\u201d</p><p>He shrugs. \u201cSo I have a few things to learn.\u201d</p><p>I nod in the direction of the stretch of sidewalk leading us to the restaurant and smile. \u201cCome on, let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>He tries to grab my hand and again the gesture sends butterflies bouncing off the walls of my stomach, but I pretend not to react and tuck a piece of hair behind my ear. \u201cDid you use your charm to get reservations here? Because I\u2019ve heard it takes months just to get an eleven o\u2019clock reservation.\u201d I glance over at him while waiting for a reply and notice that his profile is just as alluring as the full-on view.</p><p>His lips twist into a smile and his eyes shift to mine.</p><p>I can\u2019t help wondering if he can see the butterflies escaping my mouth and swarming around him.</p><p>\u201cYou know, as much as I\u2019d love to say my charm works wonders, I can\u2019t lie. Jagger used his hobnobbing connections to get us a table.\u201d</p><p>I flinch because there it is, looming over us. Smack in my face it hits\u2014reality. Lies, half-truths, what he doesn\u2019t know. What I\u2019m afraid to tell him\u2014not only because I have no idea how he\u2019ll react but because reliving our past is just too painful. It\u2019s the very reason this, him and me, can never work.</p><p>He bumps my shoulder. \u201cHey, sorry to disappoint you.\u201d</p><p>I paint a fake smile on my face. \u201cActually I\u2019m kind of secretly enjoying the fact that you don\u2019t always get what you want.\u201d</p><p>He reaches for the tall brass door and places his other hand on the small of my back. \u201cThat happens more than you\u2019d think,\u201d he whispers in my ear.</p><p>A shiver runs down my spine. The meaning of his words is clear\u2014he wants me. I wish I could be honest and tell him that I want him too, but I know I can\u2019t. We\u2019re friends. I\u2019ll take that until he can\u2019t take it anymore. Something is better than nothing.</p><p>\u201cWow, this place is amazing.\u201d</p><p>He agrees with me and says, \u201cI know, it\u2019s like being transported to another time and place.\u201d</p><p>The grand space is very lavish with a bar in the center and a dining room and lounge flanking each side. Intricate tile-work, carved plaster columns, and a beautifully ornate hand-painted ceiling set the mood perfectly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never eaten at a Moroccan restaurant,\u201d I say a little more breathy than I\u2019d like with his hand still searing my skin.</p><p>\u201cShould I have checked with you first before letting Jagger pick the place?\u201d</p><p>I laugh, and my nerves settle as I realize he\u2019s a little nervous too. \u201cNo, I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll love it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere they are.\u201d He points to a booth in a dimly lit corner with a bottle of wine on the table and flickering votive candles in the center. Jagger has his arm stretched across the back of the brown-leather-upholstered bench with his mouth hovering over Aerie\u2019s ear. A huge smile is plastered on her face.</p><p>Jagger spots us and rises to his feet, waving us over. He\u2019s dressed similar to Ben, in a gray button-down and black jeans. He\u2019s my cousin and although it seems I\u2019ve known him forever, we only just met less than a year ago. Jagger\u2019s mother is my mother\u2019s sister. She lives in Paris. She never married Jagger\u2019s father and allowed his father to raise him in New York City. River actually met Jagger for the first time on his honeymoon in Paris and they hit it off so well Jagger decided to move to LA. Lucky for all of us and especially for Aerie. She captured his heart from their first meeting, and after a few bumps in the road they are a full-fledged couple. I\u2019m surrounded by adorable couples lately.</p><p>Aerie stands as well and Ben ushers me into the booth, his hand still resting possessively on my back. Aerie leans over to hug me and Jagger kisses my cheek, nothing like the one Ben had placed there earlier. Ben\u2019s hand casually drifts up my spine and back down, and visions of his lips doing the same pop into my mind. I try to push away the primal response his physical presence elicits from me. Ben removes his hand to shake hands with Jagger and says hello to Aerie. I notice there\u2019s no kissing between them. I guess when two people work together, any such physical contact is awkward.</p><p>We all sit down as I try to wrap my mind around this\u2014a double date? No, it\u2019s simply friends sharing a meal together at a very expensive restaurant.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry I\u2019m late,\u201d I ramble, feeling nervous with Ben so close. I wasn\u2019t this nervous when he took me to the diner for pie. But then again we had just screwed each other\u2019s brains out. This is different. The sexual tension between us is overwhelming, but we said we\u2019d be friends. He\u2019d agreed. There would be no screwing afterward. Just a friendly good-bye. It\u2019s what I said I wanted.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not late,\u201d Jagger answers. \u201cAerie insisted we would be late, so she made me pick her up at work a little too early.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s always so much traffic coming into LA at rush hour,\u201d she defends herself.</p><p>I giggle a little. She\u2019s not a fan of LA and she convinced my cousin to move to Laguna. He doesn\u2019t seem to mind the commute, though. I can see Jagger\u2019s arm moving and I know he\u2019s caressing his fingers up and down her leg. She\u2019s wearing a cute suit. I saw it when she stood up. Short red skirt, black-and-red-checked jacket, and a black silk top with a slight V neck. Her jewelry, though, is absolutely fabulous. Small red sparkling hearts circle her neck with crystal leaves peeking out here and there. She has the most exquisite antique pieces\u2014hand-me-downs from her grandmother. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI love your necklace.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you. Jagger bought it for me for my birthday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s beautiful.\u201d I offer my cousin a look of admiration. \u201cI thought it was a piece from your grandmother\u2019s collection.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, right?\u201d she says, gushing over him. \u201cIt couldn\u2019t be more perfect.\u201d Her hand fingers the crystals as they sparkle.</p> <p>\u201cNot only does my cousin have swagger, but he has awesome taste.\u201d I smile at them.</p><p>He shrugs off the compliment.</p><p>\u201cSwagger?\u201d Ben chokes, pretending to pound his chest with his fist.</p><p>\u201cWatch it, man.\u201d Jagger points to him with a grin that tells me they\u2019re joking with each other.</p><p>I was a little nervous when Ben suggested we all go out to dinner because I wasn\u2019t sure how the dynamic would be between the two men. But I guess since they had already forged a relationship in New York City through circumstances I\u2019d rather not think about, they get along.</p> <p>The waitress approaches and greets our table. \u201cWhat can I get you both to drink?\u201d</p><p>I start to answer, but Ben orders for the both of us. \u201cTwo sparkling waters with lemon please.\u201d</p><p>My heart starts to steadily pound. He remembers what I drink and he now adds lemon to his own drink. I try to rein in my smile, but it\u2019s too late.</p><p>\u201cYou look really happy today, Bell,\u201d Jagger muses, his eyes drifting between Ben and me. He\u2019s obviously trying to gauge the situation.</p><p>\u201cOh, I got a new client that I\u2019m excited to work with,\u201d I lie. Well, it\u2019s not really a lie\u2014I am excited about working with the governor\u2019s son, but that\u2019s not why I was smiling.</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d Aerie asks, genuinely curious.</p> <p>\u201cRomeo Fairchild.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, that should be exciting. He\u2019s notorious for being a ladies\u2019 man. I can\u2019t believe he\u2019s settling down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s getting married late next month. The day after Thanksgiving.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShotgun wedding?\u201d She quirks an eyebrow.</p><p>I shrug. I can feel Ben\u2019s stare burning me. I lift my eyes to meet his and I\u2019m not sure what I see brewing in them.</p><p>\u201cHave you met him yet?\u201d he asks.</p><p>\u201cNo, we have our first meeting later this week. I guess his fianc\u00e9e is so nervous she\u2019s left the whole thing up to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, sounds like you\u2019re in for a treat,\u201d Aerie says.</p> <p>\u201cHow\u2019s that?\u201d Jagger asks, his own eyebrow rising now.</p><p>\u201cWell, he\u2019s stunning and if the fianc\u00e9e doesn\u2019t want anything to do with the wedding planning, I\u2019d say something isn\u2019t right.\u201d</p><p>Ben\u2019s whole body goes rigid. \u201cI went to high school with him. But how do you know him?\u201d he asks Aerie.</p><p>\u201cHis parents had a house on the bluff near my uncle\u2019s. Rome and I used to build sand castles together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRome?\u201d Jagger clears his throat.</p><p>\u201cWell, yes, that\u2019s what we called him. I haven\u2019t seen him for years, though. Just his picture in the paper.\u201d She squirms a little under the scrutiny of both men at the table.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to hear a little more about how stunning he is,\u201d Jagger says, his lips turning up in a teasing fashion.</p><p>Aerie\u2019s cheeks blaze. And Ben is unusually quiet.</p><p>\u201cWell, not as stunning as you, of course.\u201d Her eyes lift to Jagger\u2019s.</p><p>He leans over and whispers something in her ear and all I can hear is the word sand.</p><p>She whispers something back that I\u2019m pretty sure is \u201cI can\u2019t do that.\u201d</p><p>His mouth quirks up in a we\u2019ll see kind of way.</p><p>Ben clears his throat and opens his menu.</p><p>So while Aerie and Jagger share an intimate moment, I look down at my own menu. The inscription on the front reads A culinary journey that will lead you through the Spice Trail . . . Indochina . . . Franco-Afrique . . . The Levant . . . Southeast Asia . . . La M\u00e9diterran\u00e9e.</p><p>I lean toward Ben. \u201cWhat does this mean?\u201d</p><p>He leans closer to me. \u201cI think it means the food is really spicy.\u201d He laughs. His warm breath feels amazing on my neck and he doesn\u2019t move back. Instead he stays close enough to me that our thighs touch.</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d It\u2019s all I can say because once again his physical contact has rendered me speechless. My stomach is fluttering, my pulse is racing, and my body is doing other things that aren\u2019t appropriate at the table.</p><p>\u201cSo, what\u2019s good?\u201d Ben directs his question to Jagger, who reluctantly pulls himself away from his private conversation with Aerie.</p><p>\u201cThe chicken and lamb are my favorites. Or the camel, rabbit, and mutton are also really good. The lemon pickling is really good.\u201d</p><p>I gulp, not liking the sound of any of that.</p><p>Ben\u2019s eyes drift toward me, and his shoulder bumps mine. \u201cYou like lemon.\u201d</p><p>My gaze latches on to his as Jagger continues to give us a rundown on the use of unrefined olive oils and dried fruits in the Moroccan cooking processes. Ben\u2019s eyes don\u2019t wander and my pulse races from his gentle but concerned stare.</p><p>\u201cOh, and the sherry cobbler is the best you\u2019ll ever have,\u201d Jagger says, drawing my attention back to the conversation.</p><p>The waitress returns with our drinks and refreshes Aerie\u2019s and Jagger\u2019s wineglasses before asking Ben and me if we\u2019d like a glass. We both shake our heads no. \u201cAre you ready to order, then?\u201d she asks.</p><p>\u201cHow about we start with the les olives maison and rustic loaf?\u201d Jagger says to the waitress. He looks at the three of us. \u201cAnything else to start?\u201d</p><p>I shake my head no and Aerie does the same.</p><p>\u201cSounds good,\u201d Ben answers for all of us.</p><p>The waitress walks away and Aerie looks at Jagger, a little horrified.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d he asks.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not going to taste like the artichoke bread, is it?\u201d</p><p>He laughs. \u201cI hope not. We\u2019ll see when we try it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cArtichoke bread?\u201d I can\u2019t help asking.</p><p>\u201cLong story,\u201d Aerie says. \u201cBut Jagger always wants to try new things and\u2014\u201d</p><p>Ben busts out laughing and so does Jagger.</p><p>Not getting what is going on, I say, \u201cI hate vegetables.\u201d</p><p>Everyone\u2019s eyes go to me.</p><p>I sit straight. \u201cWhat? I do.\u201d</p><p>Ben shakes his head and Jagger does the same. Aerie just smiles at me.</p><p>\u201cSo, what are you having?\u201d I ask her.</p><p>She clears her throat. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>Jagger taps his menu. Her eyes go to where he\u2019s pointing on her menu and she ferociously shakes her head no.</p><p>The waitress returns. \u201cHave you decided on your main course?\u201d</p><p>Ben looks around the table and then up at her. \u201cI think we need a few more minutes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo problem.\u201d She smiles at him.</p><p>Oh my God, is she flirting with him when I\u2019m sitting right next to him? Is he flirting back? Was that a wink I saw? Okay, I need to calm down\u2014I\u2019m just friends with him after all. Except telling myself that doesn\u2019t help at all.</p><p>\u201cHey, where are you?\u201d Ben asks me</p><p>My eyes meet his ocean blue gaze and I try to push my haze of green jealousy away.</p><p>\u201cTrying to decide what to order.\u201d I smile.</p><p>He points to the twenty-two-ounce cauliflower steak on my menu. \u201cI guess you won\u2019t be ordering this,\u201d he whispers in my ear.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m thinking of eating dessert for dinner,\u201d I whisper back.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take you for a juicy burger when we leave here. And I promise, no vegetables will be on it.\u201d This time his mouth actually touches my ear.</p><p>A shiver that feels more like a yearning courses through me. \u201cExcuse me, I need to use the restroom.\u201d</p><p>I get up quickly and walk as fast as I can to the bathroom. He remembers everything. Guys never remember details like that. I try to gather my wits. With my head bent over the sink, I take deep breaths, but tears are still prickling my eyes. I never knew how sweet he really was, and every minute we spend together just makes me want him more. What am I doing?</p><p>\u201cEverything okay?\u201d Aerie asks me, and I look up to see her perfectly polished, beautiful reflection in the mirror.</p><p>\u201cOh yes. I just really needed to use the restroom,\u201d I lie.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s none of my business, but what\u2019s going on between the two of you?\u201d she asks.</p><p>And there it is\u2014judgment.</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d I quickly answer. \u201cWe just ran into each other last week at his awards banquet and started talking. It\u2019s really nothing. In fact, if you could not mention it to anyone I\u2019d really appreciate it.\u201d</p><p>Her hand covers mine, gripping the bathroom counter. \u201cBell, I\u2019m not judging. I\u2019ve just known Ben a really long time and have to tell you that I like how he is with you.\u201d</p><p>I turn around. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>She smiles. \u201cNervous, eager, maybe happy. I\u2019ve seen many sides of him, but this one suits him. I don\u2019t know how to describe it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, we\u2019re just friends.\u201d</p><p>She raises her palms. \u201cRemember, I\u2019m not judging. And if you don\u2019t like the restaurant we can go somewhere else.\u201d</p><p>I smile at her. \u201cOh no, we\u2019re staying. I\u2019m pretty sure I saw Theo James in the corner on my way in here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on, let\u2019s go see.\u201d She takes my hand.</p><p>We walk slowly through the dining room staring at the table and when we get to our own table, Ben looks at me with concern.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d He moves aside for me to take my seat.</p><p>I nod.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think that was him,\u201d Aerie says, helping to lift the sullen mood at the table.</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d Jagger asks.</p><p>\u201cTheo James,\u201d she says enthusiastically.</p><p>Jagger hovers over her in the booth. \u201cThat\u2019s enough talk about other men.\u201d Then he kisses her and practically pins her to the wall.</p><p>When I look over at Ben I decide I\u2019ll take this piece of him while I can because he makes me happy.</p><p>He opens his menu again and points to an item. \u201cWhat do you say to the c\u00f4te de boeuf for two, minus the winter root?\u201d He grins at me in his irresistible way.</p><p>I allow my finger to trace the words on the menu where his hands lie. \u201cThat sounds really good.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 11</p><p>Show Me</p><p>Ben</p><p>One of the perks of owning your own business is making your own schedule. I can come in as early or as late as I want, but I\u2019m always here by seven. I can also take a long lunch or skip it in favor of working. And I get to leave at four or stay until I\u2019m done, although I\u2019m always here well past eight. But what I like most is that I can work out at any time of the day. And today I\u2019ve been feeling a lot of tension that needs to be relieved, so I decided midday works best.</p><p>The treadmill beeps and I slow my pace.</p><p>Kale throws me a towel. \u201cSpeed it up, man. I\u2019ve been done for more than five minutes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know I was running a marathon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think you knew you were running at all.\u201d</p><p>I grab my water bottle and guzzle it down after wiping the sweat off my brow. \u201cDo I want to know what you thought I was doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, you just might. I think you were trying not to get a hard-on thinking about that girl you\u2019ve been besting up to.\u201d His Australian accent stresses the word hard-on.</p><p>\u201cBesting up to? What the hell does that mean?\u201d</p><p>He hooks his feet under the padded bar of the bench next to me. He pauses mid-sit-up to answer me. \u201cCome on, man, you\u2019ve got it bad for that girl, but besties don\u2019t f**k.\u201d</p><p>I shoot him a glare. \u201cYou don\u2019t know shit.\u201d I refuse to tell him I f**ked her twice before the friends-only rule was invoked. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Huffing and puffing, he continues his count and I head for the door, my muscles still tight and tensed, not in the least bit relieved from running.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be pissed,\u201d he calls to me. \u201cI\u2019m just looking out for you. Maybe she\u2019s getting it elsewhere.\u201d</p><p>I shove my middle finger up in the air as I enter the locker room of the small gym on Plan B\u2019s floor. His comment cuts deep. It\u2019s been a few weeks since I found out she\u2019d be working with Romeo Fairchild. I\u2019ve brought him up a couple of times since then and all she talks about is how well the wedding planning is going. I know him, though. He was a snake in high school and I have no doubt he still is. The thought of him alone with her drives me f**king crazy. Then there\u2019s that ass**le boss of hers calling her night and day. Maybe she was all about the fun we were having and when I said no to any more role-playing\u2014to f**king in public places\u2014she just wasn\u2019t interested in me and this friends thing was really her way of trying to get rid of me, not trying to get to know me.</p><p>Just as I\u2019m changing into a clean shirt, my phone beeps\u2014a text from S\u2019belle.</p> <p>You\u2019re not going to believe this. Xander\u2019s going to propose to Ivy the night of her release party. I\u2019m so excited but have to add some special touches to the event now. One week! I can\u2019t wait.</p><p>My fingers hover over the keyboard, but I don\u2019t respond. I\u2019ve seen S\u2019belle almost every night this week. We\u2019ve texted and talked on the phone more than I\u2019ve ever done with anyone, in fact, more than I\u2019ve probably done in my lifetime. Our conversations have been deep at times and lighter at others. She hasn\u2019t laxed on her friendship guidelines, yet my attraction toward her has steadily grown. The quirky, funny things she says get me in the gut and do strange things to me. But Kale hit a sore spot. The whole \u201cfriends\u201d dating thing is growing tiresome. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I\u2019ve enjoyed getting to know her and having someone to talk to, but I think Kale might be right. I respond with a quick note.</p><p>Great news. Hey, I\u2019m going to have to cancel tonight. Something came up at work.</p><p>Her response is immediate.</p><p>Okay. Hope everything is all right. Call me later.</p> <p>I shove my phone in my pocket, grab my shit, and head back to my office. Once I\u2019m there I drop it all on my desk and pace to the window. Plan B headquarters is located in the Jamboree Business Center in Irvine, a quick hop on the freeway from Laguna. It\u2019s also a fast drive to LA.</p><p>I can see the calm Pacific framed in the distance through my large window and long to be out there, but I have work to do. I think about all I have to accomplish before the announcement of my takeovers is made public. Surfer\u2019s End\u2019s migration to this building is finally happening this week, and I am so f**king happy\u2014the transition has been a nightmare. Their offices will occupy the floor below me, whereas Sound Music occupies the one above. Both publications should be ready to upload their online issues early next week. And I just need to hire a few more people and we will be hitting the modern world of technology with a boom.</p><p>In order to concentrate on work, I have to avert my eyes from the California view. Just as I head toward my phone to text her again, there\u2019s a knock at my door.</p><p>\u201cCome in,\u201d I call.</p><p>The door opens and Kale stands there. \u201cJust checking on you. I didn\u2019t mean to piss you off.\u201d</p><p>As soon as I sit down my speakerphone buzzes. I raise a finger and answer it. \u201cYeah, Beck?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI need to go over this budget with you. Is now okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn my way.\u201d</p><p>I glance back over to Kale. \u201cI\u2019m not pissed, man. I think you might be onto something. I may have become her \u2018girlfriend\u2019 as hard as that is for me to say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you say to grabbing a beer tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, sure, why not?\u201d</p><p>Before I can finish asking where, Beck is standing behind him.</p><p>Kale turns. \u201cHey, how\u2019s it going today?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBetter than yesterday,\u201d Beck responds.</p><p>Kale grins. \u201cAlways good. Catch you both later. I\u2019ll stop by before I leave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not going out tonight, are you?\u201d Beck asks me.</p><p>My eyes cut to his. \u201cI can go out for a beer on a Friday night. I\u2019m not an alcoholic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBen, why would you do that now? What\u2019s going on with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it that girl you\u2019re into? The one you like?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never said I like her. I\u2019m not fifteen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to say you like someone for it to be apparent that you\u2019re interested.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know what, Beck, no offense, but I don\u2019t want to talk about it.\u201d</p><p>He raises his hands. \u201cLook, man, not trying to get in your business. I\u2019m just looking out for you.\u201d</p><p>Sighing, I slouch over, resting my forearms on my thighs. \u201cYeah, I know. I appreciate it. How about you show me what you\u2019ve got?\u201d</p><p>He hands me a stack of papers\u2014Beck\u2019s budget seems doable. \u201cLooks great, man,\u201d I say after a quick perusal.</p><p>He nods. \u201cI\u2019ll leave them with you. I\u2019m heading out for the day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks. And see ya.\u201d</p><p>I swivel in my chair and decide to look over the Sound Music budget Aerie gave me yesterday. Time flies as I spend the rest of the day analyzing it.</p><p>There\u2019s a light tap on my door before it opens.</p><p>\u201cReady to go grab that beer, mate?\u201d Kale asks.</p><p>I glance at the clock on my desk. \u201cFuck, it\u2019s already seven?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, it is. What, did the day get away from you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt did. I think I\u2019m going to pass tonight. I want to finish this budget shit up and be done with it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo worries. Take care and call if you change your mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, man. I will.\u201d But I know I won\u2019t. Beck is right. I don\u2019t need to fall back into that scene again.</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>It\u2019s not quite six a.m. and I\u2019m feeling restless, staring out in the darkness of my room. I pull out my journal to record my thoughts, but I can\u2019t get them down because I don\u2019t know what they are. I\u2019ve never been at a loss for words before\u2014but today I am. After an hour or so I toss my journal aside and decide to go on a run.</p><p>By the time I hit the main road, the sun has already risen. I slow down and make my way through town and to the corner coffee shop. Grabbing a paper and a cup of coffee, I sit outside under one of the umbrella tables and catch up on the news. Once I\u2019ve scoured the paper I decide to people-watch. I haven\u2019t done that in a long time. Time slips away from me and when I glance at my phone it\u2019s almost eleven.</p><p>Tossing my shit in the trash, I take the beach path home. When I pass the little run-down surf shack, I decide to stop in. It doesn\u2019t look like much from the outside, but what Noel has done with the inside is f**king amazing. Blondie\u2019s, the shop that used to belong to my dad, always feels like home away from home to me. My father named his business after his pet name for my mother, but back then it was no small operation. I don\u2019t remember coming here before Noel bought it, but I know my father not only sold boards of every size and design, but also owned a fleet of boats that he chartered, along with any and every apparatus made for the sea. Sadly, it was his thirst to try out everything and anything new under the sun that killed him. My sister and I had recently discovered that his death resulted from taking a new sailboat out alone\u2014the police reports said his death was due to a piece of malfunctioning equipment that hanged him by the ropes. My mother never told us what happened to him.</p><p>My sister thinks it was because she didn\u2019t want us to picture him that way; I\u2019m not so sure. She also never told us she had been awarded ten million dollars as a wrongful death settlement. Again, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s for the reason my sister believes. I shake my dark thoughts away. Inheriting that money hasn\u2019t changed me at all, but it has given me direction. It\u2019s given me the ability to do something I never would have been able to do without it\u2014start my own business.</p><p>Taking one step at a time, I glance around the outside of the shack. It looks the same as always\u2014wind chimes everywhere, peeling green paint, a weathered roof that needs replacing, a ramp that has long since collapsed. I walk in and as usual my head circles the perimeter. Surfboards line the arched ceiling, covering every inch of it.</p><p>\u201cJust a f**king brilliant way to expand the merchandise,\u201d I say to Noel. I say it every time I walk in because I\u2019m so impressed.</p><p>He beams from behind the counter. \u201cHey, Benny boy. What brings you by?\u201d</p><p>Noel\u2019s an out-of-shape, middle-aged man who at one time was the undisputed ASP World Champion. My dad was also a member of the Association of Surfing Professionals and that\u2019s how they met. Noel bought the shop from my dad\u2019s business partner a few years after my dad died, and he\u2019s run it ever since.</p><p>\u201cJust out for a run and passing by.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure you\u2019re not checking on your board?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHa, you caught me,\u201d I joke. \u201cI\u2019ve got a car now, so I won\u2019t have to leave her here much longer. I just have to have a rack put on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not bothering me. At least I know you\u2019ll be stopping by once in a while with her here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNoel, come on, man. I stop by as much as I can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t seen you in three weeks.\u201d He scrubs his beard. \u201cSomething tells me you\u2019re chasing tail.\u201d</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cI never chase anything but a wave. You know that.\u201d</p><p>He looks at me with sincerity in his eyes. \u201cSometimes you have to chase what you really want because everything in life worth having won\u2019t fall into your lap.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re awful philosophical for this early in the day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI always think clearer before five.\u201d He laughs.</p><p>The ding of the door alerts us to a customer.</p><p>\u201cHey, I gotta run but I\u2019ll be by soon.\u201d</p><p>He moves forward to hug me. \u201cIt was good to see you, Benny.\u201d</p><p>I hug him back. \u201cYou too, Noel. Tell Faith hello for me.\u201d</p><p>He nods. \u201cWill do. She\u2019ll be sorry she missed you.\u201d</p><p>His attention is diverted to the dude checking out the boards overhead and I slip out, deciding to take it easy and walk the rest of the way home rather than run. My phone vibrates and I stop, pulling it from my sock. In my rush this morning to escape the silence, I left the house with no earphones and no armband. It\u2019s a message from S\u2019belle. I have to squint to read it since I forgot my sunglasses as well.</p><p>Is everything okay?</p><p>Three little words and my heart falls in my chest. Am I wrong about the sexual pull I thought we both recognized? Am I just her friend and along for a ride going nowhere? I drop in the sand and scroll through our messages over the last few weeks. I stop on one from when I asked her to go to the Hollywood Forever Cemetery Screening with me. She had said yes. She always says yes. She was a little startled at the thought at first, but once I assured her it would be a blast, her anxiety eased. I told her I\u2019d pick her up and as I read her response now, I can\u2019t help laughing.</p><p>I\u2019m more than capable of driving in the dark and I didn\u2019t invite you over to get me anyway.</p><p>That night I met her in the front of the cemetery. She was late and I paced the sidewalk. When she finally arrived, she seemed exasperated.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d I asked, scrutinizing her demeanor.</p><p>She frowned. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry I\u2019m late. Tate needed to review next month\u2019s wedding schedule and had a bit of a meltdown over everything still left to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWyatt is an ass**le.\u201d</p><p>She stared at me with something in her eyes I couldn\u2019t quite figure out. \u201cHe can be.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou should quit,\u201d I grunted.</p><p>She ignored me, but she always does when I tell her what she already knows. The guy is a dick\u2014there are no two ways about it.</p><p>\u201cA picnic?\u201d she asked, changing the subject with her green eyes alight.</p><p>I had a bag of sandwiches and two slices of pie from Four &amp; Twenty Blackbirds in one hand and a blanket in the other. Her brow quirked as she assessed my wares, and her mood went from dark to jubilant just like that.</p> <p>\u201cYeah, I can put a pretty cool party together too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI bet you can,\u201d she said, grabbing the blanket, and I sensed a hint of another meaning in her response.</p><p>\u201cJust call me Martha f**king Stewart,\u201d I snorted.</p><p>We both burst out laughing.</p><p>\u201cC\u2019mon. I want to get a good spot.\u201d</p> <p>S\u2019belle followed me past the line of people that wrapped around the block and into the iconic cemetery. Thank f**k I had bought tickets online. I\u2019d never been there but always wanted to go and didn\u2019t want to miss my opportunity in case of a sellout. I glanced around and gave a low whistle. \u201cCool place.\u201d</p><p>She clutched the blanket and moved closer to me. The air seemed filled with intrigue. The cemetery shared a wall with Paramount Studios. Music was being played by a DJ and a projector from somewhere in the distance cast music videos upon it. We passed the tombs of Hollywood legends Peter Lorre, Victor Fleming, and Norma Talmadge as S\u2019belle stared in awe.</p><p>\u201cWant to go in?\u201d I asked, leaning down and whispering in her ear.</p><p>Her eyes closed and I knew she was trying to compose herself. \u201cNope.\u201d</p><p>I grinned at her. \u201cNope? Not sure, why not, or maybe later?\u201d I said, bumping her shoulder.</p><p>\u201cNope,\u201d she said again. \u201cToo creepy for me.\u201d And I covered my mouth to stifle a laugh.</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t laugh,\u201d she huffed.</p><p>I placed my hand on her back. \u201cI\u2019m not. I think it\u2019s cute. You know I\u2019ll keep you safe.\u201d</p><p>She picked up the pace. \u201cWhere do you want to sit?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat way,\u201d I said, pointing to the sign with an arrow that read FAIRBANKS LAWN.</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t Douglas Fairbanks play Zorro?\u201d</p><p>I flung her a look, amazed she knew that. \u201cYeah, he did and Robin Hood too. Have you seen them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBoth versions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh . . . we both loved marked men.\u201d</p> <p>She nodded. \u201cI didn\u2019t see, what was playing tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDial M for Murder.\u201d I smirked.</p><p>\u201cAlfred Hitchcock?\u201d Her eyes glittered.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why I picked it.\u201d</p><p>She tipped her head up toward the stars. \u201cBeautiful night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is,\u201d I agreed, and stopped at the perfect location. It wasn\u2019t in the middle of the thousands of people already sitting in rows, but rather it was off to the side with the cemetery just behind us. Setting my bag down, I laid out the blanket so we could both sit.</p><p>We ate and watched the movie. She moved close to me when she was scared and I tried hard to keep my hands off her. Just before the final credits rolled, I stretched my arms over my head and brought one down behind her back. It was a classic guy move, one I had never attempted on a girl before. I practically rolled my eyes at my own ridiculousness, but she didn\u2019t say anything, so I left it there.</p><p>She turned toward me. \u201cBen . . . ,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Her face was so close to my lips and I couldn\u2019t resist lowering them slightly and brushing my mouth over hers. Heat filled the air between us, but I hesitated a little too long about deepening the kiss. I didn\u2019t want to make a move until I was sure she wanted me to.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s over,\u201d she said, jumping to her feet. She stood there visibly trembling.</p><p>I stayed where I was, motionless, as lust flooded me and I cursed myself for hesitating.</p><p>A gust of wind blows sand in my face and I snap out of it. What the f**k am I doing ignoring her? I know she feels what I feel. I said I\u2019d give her time. I can do that. I continue scrolling through more of the old text messages between us, and stop on another one from her.</p><p>Do you think we\u2019ll be climbing a lot of stairs at Hearst Castle?</p><p>I had typed back a question mark.</p><p>She responded with what I\u2019ve labeled a Bellism.</p><p>Heels look better with the outfit I\u2019m wearing, but I\u2019m not sure they\u2019re all right for climbing stairs.</p><p>I answered with the following.</p><p>I don\u2019t think you have to worry about stairs. It\u2019s not a tower. Wear your heels and if I have to, I\u2019ll f**king carry you.</p><p>I didn\u2019t carry her, but I did stare at her ass as we climbed the stairs of the castle. I scroll down and stop on the one that reads:</p><p>What should I wear to the rock climbing gym?</p><p>I have to laugh out loud. I had responded:</p><p>Surprise me.</p><p>And she did. She showed up in jeans and high heels claiming she thought she\u2019d just take her shoes off. We bought her a pair of appropriate shoes in the lobby. After I tortured myself not only ogling her ass but also pushing it upward for an hour, I had to stop. The blood kept rushing to my c**k and I was so uncomfortable after a while there was no way I could climb. I called it a night early.</p><p>I spend another five minutes going through messages just like those and think about the places we\u2019ve gone and the connection we\u2019ve shared. I feel the grin building on my lips with each passing one. And I know what to do. I dial her number.</p><p>\u201cHello,\u201d she answers on the first ring.</p><p>\u201cHey, how are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. How are you?\u201d</p><p>I look out over the ocean. \u201cBetter now that I hear your voice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs everything okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Just had a lot of shit going on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI missed talking to you.\u201d</p><p>Now I wish I could pull her through the phone. \u201cWhat are you doing right now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing. I just got home from helping Tate set up for a wedding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat, the prick can\u2019t lift the silverware himself?\u201d</p><p>She giggles. \u201cNo, just some coordination issues that needed to be worked out.\u201d</p><p>I bite back what I want to say about her boss. \u201cI\u2019m coming to get you. I have something I want to show you.\u201d</p><p>She starts to argue.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll pick you up at five. I don\u2019t want to hear another word about it. I\u2019m not taking no for an answer this time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m surprised she gives in that easy. \u201cSee you in a bit, Red.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBye, Ben,\u201d she says, and her tone is quiet. I can picture her face, all innocent and beautiful, and my stomach does that thumping that I can\u2019t figure out. I don\u2019t know what it is about her that affects me so much.</p><p>I take off for home, shower, get dressed, and make a stop along the way before heading to her place. As soon as my hand reaches out to lift the bar to the gate, I spot her. She\u2019s sitting at one of the tables and quickly hangs up her phone. She\u2019s wearing jeans, a tight sweater with a scarf wrapped around her neck, and high-heel boots.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing down here alone, beautiful?\u201d I ask as I open the gate.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m waiting for you.\u201d Her green eyes gleam and her mouth lifts up into a smile that I can\u2019t resist returning.</p><p>But she seems a little shaken.</p><p>\u201cEverything okay?\u201d</p><p>She nods. \u201cOf course.\u201d But she\u2019s not in the least bit convincing.</p><p>I move closer, close enough to smell her lemony scent, even though normally I keep a small distance between us. But I have this overwhelming need to feel her warmth, so I hug her\u2014nothing sexual, just a friendly hello. She\u2019s receptive to it and hugs me back. I disengage from her quickly. I don\u2019t want to trigger her alarm. The one where she backs away when she thinks I\u2019m too close.</p><p>I stare into her mesmerizing eyes. \u201cHave you ever seen the view from Carl\u2019s Curve at night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUp on Mulholland Drive?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I haven\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>I extend my hand. \u201cWell, come on. We should be able to make it before sunset.\u201d</p><p>Her fingers entangle with mine and they fit perfectly in my hand. When I open the gate I cover her eyes.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d she asks.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll see.\u201d I lead her to my bike and grab the helmet off the seat before I remove my other hand.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not riding on your bike up there. I told you . . .\u201d</p><p>I pull my hand from my behind my back and hand her the green helmet I stopped and picked up on my way over. She jumps up and down and the excitement she exudes over the smallest things\u2014the way she clasps her hands together and bounces when something makes her happy\u2014it gets me every time. I wish I knew how to get that reaction all the time.</p><p>Stepping closer, I push away the hair from her eyes and slip the helmet on her head. Once I do I dip my head down and kiss her, but just her cheek. I pull away before the urge to slide my lips and cover hers becomes impossible ignore. Then I strap my own black helmet on and hop on my bike. She circles to the left and does the same. When she gets on she wraps her arms around me so naturally my heart rate speeds at the contact.</p><p>With a quick turn of the ignition switch, I shift into neutral and kick-start her to life. S\u2019belle breathes loudly in my ear and I can sense the rush she must be feeling. The short ride up the curvy road urges her closer. It makes me feel that she\u2019s finally living in the moment, not overthinking everything. Each downshift is met with just the right amount of throttle as I carve each turn perfectly and her body sways into mine. I can smell her lemony scent, hear the puff of her breath, feel the warmth of her body against mine. My muscles tense with each movement she makes.</p><p>She holds me tight as we ride like the wind up to what has become one of my favorite places. When I feel her resting her chin on my shoulder, I suck in a breath. But when her hands slide down to my thighs for a moment before she realizes it and pulls them back up, I grin like a f**king idiot because I know the walls are finally coming down.</p><p>CHAPTER 12</p><p>Still Into You</p><p>Bell</p><p>The sun is shining bright and there isn\u2019t a cloud in the sky. I take my time walking down Hollywood Boulevard looking around at the many businesses and shops. Funny thing is I\u2019m not really looking at them, though, because all I can see is Ben. I can\u2019t get him out of my head. We talk all the time, we text all the time. Up until this week, we\u2019ve spent all of our free time together. What was supposed to be a friends-only relationship to ward him off seems to have spurred him on.</p><p>Today it hit me that it seems like forever since I last saw him, which was Sunday night. He picked me up and took me to gaze at the view of LA from Mulholland Drive. It was stunning and riding on his bike was absolutely dreamy. He\u2019s told me many times he\u2019s not a romantic, but he doesn\u2019t see what I see.</p><p>I pull on the showroom door and step in, looking around. It\u2019s all put together in a very trendy modern metallic palette. My gaze darts to a blur of waving arms, and Josie\u2019s wide eyes direct me to the break room. I look at the time\u2014ten thirty. I lift the coffees and nod to my desk. She shakes her head. That can only mean trouble. I follow behind her, noticing Tate\u2019s door is shut.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Quickly, I close the door behind me and set my stuff on the table.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s on the warpath.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d I ask mildly, leaning back against the glass door.</p><p>\u201cRomeo Fairchild is in his office. He came in for his meeting with you thirty minutes ago. But, um . . . well, you weren\u2019t here. I tried to call you.\u201d</p><p>I set the coffees down and pull my phone from my purse. Shoot, she did call. I must have been on the phone with Ben and never noticed. I set my phone on the table. \u201cThe meeting is tomorrow, not today,\u201d I insist.</p><p>\u201cWell, tell that to Mr. Eleven.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s an eleven on a scale of one to ten.

The one whose wedding we\u2019re planning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Bell, I see how he looks at you.

I like this new wild side.\u201d</p><p>I laugh at her. \u201cYou should have known me before I found direction.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that like finding God?\u201d</p><p>I ponder her question. \u201cYeah, I guess it is.\u201d</p> <p>She blows a piece of blue hair out of her eyes. \u201cOh, and I almost forgot, that really hot brother of yours, the one who\u2019s, you know . . . married\u201d\u2014she rolls her eyes\u2014\u201cstopped by already too. He said to let you know he had a few things to take care of and would be back to take you to lunch.\u201d</p><p>Suddenly Josie\u2019s eyes grow even wider than when I first walked in and then there\u2019s a slight tap on the glass behind me.</p><p>I swallow and mutter, \u201cIs that Tate?\u201d</p><p>Her eyes confirm my suspicion without her having to say a single word.</p><p>My nerves start to buzz as I turn around and push the door. There stand Tate and Romeo.</p><p>\u201cMiss Wilde, you decided to join us at work today. I\u2019m so glad,\u201d he says sternly but he\u2019s still conducting himself civilly.</p> <p>My eyes shift to Romeo\u2019s. Aerie is right\u2014he\u2019s a stunner. And Ben is right too\u2014he\u2019s a snake. His look is aristocratic but bad boy at the same time. Dark brown wavy hair, a sexy, slender frame with broad shoulders, and boy, does he know how to dress! I thought Tate dressed with style, but Romeo is in a whole other league. Today he\u2019s wearing a black suit with a white shirt, his gray tie crisply knotted around his neck, and he looks every bit as put together as Tate if not more so.</p><p>He speaks before I do. \u201cBell, I have to apologize. I realized after I arrived that our meeting is tomorrow, but Tate insisted I wait for you to get here.\u201d</p><p>My eyes shoot back to Tate\u2019s. He\u2019s a man who gives his work more than one hundred percent, but the problem is he can\u2019t give any aspect his one hundred percent attention. So he has me take on the more complex clients\u2014the needier ones. And Romeo, he\u2019s needy all right. But I\u2019m not sure if his need isn\u2019t to get me into a bathroom and have his way with me.</p><p>\u201cEven though our appointment was for tomorrow morning, since you\u2019re here we can go over any of your concerns now if you\u2019d like,\u201d I say to Romeo.</p><p>\u201cExcellent. Today is a much better day for me and Laney is driving me crazy over selecting a band. She\u2019s practically terrified that if we don\u2019t nail one down we\u2019ll be stuck with a DJ.\u201d</p><p>Tate nods. \u201cI\u2019ll leave the two of you to iron out your fianc\u00e9e\u2019s concerns. And, Josie, has the announcement been sent to the paper so the wedding columnist can be notified?\u201d</p><p>Josie\u2019s blue hair moves like a wave as she skirts past us. \u201cMr. Wyatt, that is next on my list of things to do.\u201d She doubles back and grabs the cup marked MOCHA off the table. \u201cThank you,\u201d she mouths, and hustles out of the room.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be in my office if you need me for anything, Bell. And, Romeo, it was a pleasure talking to you.\u201d</p> <p>Romeo smooths his tie between his thumb and finger. \u201cAs always, Tate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t we go to the conference room?\u201d I ask him when it\u2019s just the two of us.</p><p>\u201cI think here is fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, let me go grab your file and I\u2019ll be right back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d he says, his eyes staring at the ruffled edges of my chiffon blouse that just happen to be right over my br**sts.</p><p>I scurry out of the door. The conference room is visible from the showroom with a glass wall as the partition, but the break room is around the corner and not visible. Josie\u2019s comments have me all kinds of paranoid now. I take a deep breath\u2014he\u2019s just a client. Stop reading more into it. Tate\u2019s door is closed\u2014thank God. I pass Josie\u2019s desk and she shoots me a wink. I roll my eyes.</p><p>My desk is cluttered with linen samples, venue d\u00e9cor photos, centerpiece ideas\u2014all pertaining to the Blair/Fairchild wedding. Laney Blair has yet to set foot inside this office. I haven\u2019t even met her. It\u2019s all a little strange that Romeo is my only contact, but he seems determined to pull off this wedding in record time. I grab the folder marked BANDS and my wedding file and head back toward the break room.</p><p>This time when I enter the room I can smell coffee percolating and my eyes flare to the counter\u2014he made coffee? Wow, that\u2019s a first. A client making his own. The beep of my phone rivets my attention to the table and right to Romeo\u2019s prying eyes.</p><p>He knows I caught him and with a smile says, \u201cWould that Ben Covington happen to have gone to high school in Laguna?\u201d</p><p>I feel myself flushing. Why? The heat between Ben and me has to be evident on my face. \u201cI think so,\u201d I say, my voice shaky.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s your boyfriend?\u201d he asks inquisitively.</p><p>I drop my phone into my purse. \u201cWe\u2019re just friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d he says with a smirk that says friends with benefits. What the heck did Ben text? And up until now Aerie and Jagger are the only people aware of whatever is going on between Ben and me. Talking to Romeo about it doesn\u2019t seem right.</p><p>I carefully place the folders and files in my hands on the table. \u201cSo bands, your fianc\u00e9e has a valid concern\u2014\u201d</p><p>He cuts me off. \u201cI went to high school with Ben. He was a surfer, had a girl, and seemed like a rebel. He had one guy friend I remember him hanging with, and he stayed clear of my crowd.\u201d</p><p>I feel an anger rise inside me and I want to tell this arrogant guy that Ben\u2019s not pretentious, and image has never mattered to him. But I don\u2019t\u2014of course instead I try to drop the subject. \u201cI didn\u2019t know him then. But anyway, there are only a few bands that have your wedding date open. Do you want to listen to them with your fianc\u00e9e and let me know what you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSit down. Please,\u201d he says.</p><p>When I do he stands and goes over to the coffeepot, opening the cupboard above and pulling out a mug. \u201cWould you like a fresh cup?\u201d</p><p>I pull my own coffee from the tray and take the lid off. \u201cNo, I\u2019m good, thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you have sound clips for us to listen to now?\u201d</p><p>I do, but they\u2019re on my laptop, which is at my desk.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not in a hurry,\u201d he says, taking a seat next to me.</p><p>With my purse in hand I again leave the room, but this time I make a stop in the restroom. I grab my phone from my bag quickly and read Ben\u2019s text.</p><p>I\u2019ll be by to pick you up at 7. And if you even think of saying no, I\u2019ll still come by to swing you over my shoulder and carry you to dinner. I might even have to spank you.</p><p>Oh my God, Romeo read that! The air flies out of my lungs, but it\u2019s not from embarrassment. A sudden burst of excitement hums through me as I read his text again. I have no idea what I\u2019m doing anymore. I don\u2019t know where the lines are. I entered into this determined to push him away, but all I\u2019ve seemed to do is pull him closer. And that makes me happy, really happy.</p><p>The rest of the morning moves at a snail\u2019s pace. Romeo and I listen to the available bands, review the other finer details, discuss songs, and the cake\u2014ultimately he leaves the decision making up to me. It\u2019s as if I\u2019m planning my own wedding.</p><p>Toward the end of our meeting, Josie pokes her head in the door to get my attention.</p><p>\u201cYour brother\u2019s here to take you to lunch. Do you want me to tell him to wait?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, that won\u2019t be necessary,\u201d Romeo says. \u201cWe\u2019re finished here. I think I\u2019ve taken enough of Bell\u2019s time.\u201d</p><p>We leave the break room together. I gather what I can and he kindly takes the rest. My brother is sitting on the other side of the showroom in one of the chairs at the table set for two looking down at his phone with a smirk on his face that tells me he must be texting Dahlia.</p><p>I plop my stuff on my desk and Romeo does the same. Tate\u2019s still in his office with his door closed\u2014I can only imagine what storm is brewing. I look up at Romeo and extend my hand. \u201cI\u2019ll be in touch as soon as I hear back from the bands.\u201d</p><p>He eyes dance with amusement as he leans in a little too close and then shakes my hand. \u201cSounds like a plan.\u201d</p><p>I look over my shoulder in time to catch my brother\u2019s assessing eyes. He gets up and strides in our direction.</p><p>\u201cHey, I was hoping you have time for lunch.\u201d River grins at me.</p><p>\u201cSure. I\u2019d love to.\u201d I smile back at him.</p><p>\u201cWe were just saying good\u2013bye.\u201d Romeo turns on his heels, but he stops. \u201cSon of a bitch. You\u2019re River Wilde, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>River nods.</p><p>\u201cWe spend all morning looking for bands and you neglected to tell me who your brother is?\u201d Romeo says to me.</p><p>River\u2019s look turns questioning. \u201cWhat am I missing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBell has been trying to find a band for my wedding on really short notice and I never put two and two together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRomeo, my brother isn\u2019t in a band anymore,\u201d I hiss in his direction.</p><p>\u201cSuch a small world. I went to high school with your wife,\u201d Romeo says to River, ignoring me.</p><p>Oh my God, he\u2019s going to tell River about Ben. My body tightens and suddenly the room seems to be shrinking.</p><p>River grabs my hand. \u201cHey, Bell, are you okay?\u201d</p><p>I blink up. \u201cYeah, yeah, I\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou look really pale.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHonestly, I haven\u2019t eaten yet today.\u201d</p><p>River shakes his head at me. \u201cCome on, let\u2019s get you fed.\u201d</p><p>He extends his hand to Romeo. \u201cNice to meet you, man. Good luck with your wedding.\u201d</p><p>Romeo nods and River puts his arm around me, knuckling my side. \u201cYou need to take better care of yourself.\u201d And when we get outside he turns to me and asks, \u201cWho was that ass**le?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a client and the governor\u2019s son.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I didn\u2019t like the way he was looking at you.\u201d</p><p>I sigh, just thankful Romeo didn\u2019t let Ben\u2019s name roll off his tongue.</p><p>I\u2019m distracted all through lunch with my brother and when I finally get back to my desk, I plop down exhausted. As I browse through my e-mails, my mind wanders to Ben and the reality of the situation. He will never be welcome in my family\u2014there\u2019s too much baggage there, not just Dahlia but with me. So what the hell am I doing with him? Why can\u2019t I just break it off? It\u2019s time to find a way to let him go.</p><p>CHAPTER 13</p><p>Kinks Shirt</p><p>Ben</p><p>Life has a way of sneaking up on you. I\u2019ve been content focusing on my career ever since I started Plan B. It keeps me busy and keeps my mind on what\u2019s important and off the things that aren\u2019t. But this week I\u2019ve had a hard time concentrating. My mind keeps wandering to her. I know we can\u2019t keep going on like this. We can\u2019t keep walking the line between friends and more, because if we do the both of us will explode.</p><p>Walking to her apartment building, I spot her immediately. She looks like a burst of sunshine on a cloudy day. She\u2019s sitting at one of the tables in her courtyard waiting for me, and when she stands to open the gate I quickly reach around and open it first just to be closer to her faster.</p><p>She rolls her eyes at me and says, \u201cSuch a rebel.\u201d</p><p>I shrug. \u201cTakes one to know one.\u201d</p><p>She laughs. \u201cTouch\u00e9.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou look f**king fantastic,\u201d I say, purposefully dragging my eyes up and down her body.</p><p>Her smile grows even wider and the air suddenly becomes denser.</p><p>I draw her in and embrace her. She lets me, even allowing my lips to linger in the crook of her neck. I can hear her breathe me in and I have to stop myself from grinning like a f**king idiot.</p><p>I slide my palms down to her ass, touching every curve I can along the way. With a slow hiss of breath I say, \u201cHi there.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHi,\u201d she says with that innocent voice that always seems to come out of nowhere and jump-start my already aching need to take her. Which is what I want to do right now, right here.</p><p>\u201cPizza?\u201d she says, pulling away just as my fingers start to circle around to her hips.</p><p>Fuck! I need to play it cool. Don\u2019t chase her away now. Rechanneling my thoughts, I rub my stomach. \u201cSure, sounds good. I\u2019m pretty hungry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know a great place and we can even walk.\u201d Her voice tapers off and she seems distracted.</p><p>\u201cEverything okay?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cJust a crazy day. Glad it\u2019s over.\u201d</p><p>I straighten and look in her eyes. \u201cWant to talk about it?\u201d</p><p>She stiffens. \u201cNo. Not now.\u201d</p><p>I nod and grab her hand to lead her out of the courtyard. We eat and end up meandering down Sunset for a bit afterward. Just as the sky turns dark we head back to her place with coffees to sit in the courtyard.</p><p>\u201cSo, what happened at work today?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cOh, really it\u2019s nothing. Tate has me doing two really big weddings next month and the clients are very needy,\u201d she says, sipping her decaffeinated coffee with so much milk and sugar I doubt it even tastes like coffee.</p> <p>\u201cI thought you were going to quit soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was planning on it at the end of the year but haven\u2019t really gotten my own business off the ground. And these weddings are huge. I\u2019ll have the potential to make so many contacts through them I really want to impress them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t doubt you will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTate is just such a micromanager that sometimes I feel like the clients know he\u2019s babysitting me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell him to go f**k himself.\u201d</p><p>She laughs. \u201cI wish I could some days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s such a dick-wad, I wish you would.\u201d</p><p>She shakes her head. \u201cYou don\u2019t even know him. Why do you dislike him so much?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t have to know him. I don\u2019t like the way he treats you or the sadness I see in your eyes when you get off the phone with him. And besides, he has the hots for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, he doesn\u2019t. We broke up over a year ago.\u201d</p><p>My eyes shoot out of my head and before I can stop myself I\u2019m bolting out of the chair. \u201cAre you f**king kidding me? You slept with him!\u201d</p><p>She squishes her lips together in displeasure. \u201cNo. Just because I date someone doesn\u2019t mean I sleep with him.\u201d</p><p>My blood pressure is boiling. Yeah, I guess I already know that. I look up into the night and stare at the stars, taking deep calming breaths. \u201cI should be going,\u201d I say.</p><p>She grabs my wrist. \u201cDon\u2019t be mad. Don\u2019t go. Isn\u2019t it still early?\u201d</p><p>Her hand slides to my hand, but I don\u2019t grab it. \u201cYeah, it is but I took tomorrow off and I\u2019m hitting the surf at sunrise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? I\u2019d love to join you.\u201d She takes my hand in hers since I wouldn\u2019t take hers, and electricity jolts me.</p><p>I let my annoyance with the jackass go as best I can and grin at her. \u201cDon\u2019t you have Ivy\u2019s release party?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but not until later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure? You\u2019ll have to get up really early.\u201d</p><p>She nods. \u201cI\u2019m sure. I\u2019ll be there,\u201d she says, standing up and staring at me for the longest time.</p><p>I kiss her on the cheek, letting my lips linger and start for the gate. I turn around. \u201cThe main beach at six thirty,\u201d I say. \u201cIn the morning,\u201d I clarify.</p><p>\u201cI know that,\u201d she calls before reaching her top step and then disappearing around the corner.</p><p>I stay where I am, buzzing from the high of knowing the walls she\u2019s erected between us are crumbling. She has never agreed to come to Laguna\u2014to come to me. Tomorrow should be a whole lot of fun.</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>Breathe in. . . . now exhale. Feel it. Enjoy it. Don\u2019t rush it. Prolong the awesomeness for as long as possible because while it\u2019s happening you experience only one thing\u2014pure joy. It becomes an addiction . . . you can\u2019t help wanting to do it over and over again. There\u2019s no greater feeling in the world than being one with her. And in that single moment she becomes everything you want and everything you need rolled together. There\u2019s a weightlessness that exists between us as I move quickly\u2014up and down, hovering over her. I gain speed and it\u2019s thrilling, exhilarating, liberating even. I can feel her everywhere\u2014the salty, tangy taste she leaves in my mouth, the way my feet shift to accommodate her size, her cold spray on my body. I break through her ledge and position myself on her peak. She\u2019s large and hollow and I have to move forcefully to stop from getting caught in her lip, but I do it and just like that\u2014I\u2019m riding the best f**king wave.</p><p>The sun rises on this anniversary of sorts and there\u2019s a haze hanging in the air as I enfold myself inside the wave\u2019s whirl. I look ahead and can\u2019t help thinking that for the first time in a long while I\u2019m focused, I have no doubts, and I know where I\u2019m going. It hasn\u2019t been easy. It\u2019s been a long road. I wince at the memories of how poorly I acted\u2014how badly I handled everything. Blinking my sad thoughts away, I look up as the swell emerges from more than one-hundred-foot depths and watch as the silver-tinted waves of the Pacific roll in at a lightning-fast rate. Then I ride her out like a master. When I know my time is up, I take a full breath, all the way from my stomach to my chest, tilt my head back to open my lungs, and take in more air until it happens\u2014the water cascades all around me and I\u2019m completely submerged. Time stands still while I swim through the blur and toward the light. I reach the surface and blinking, I see the clear day that is beckoning on the horizon.</p><p>Chest to board, I paddle in and watch the shore come alive in the early morning hours. As I scan the beach, my eye catches a reflection of sorts in the sand. I strain to see what it is and that\u2019s when I see her. Cupping the water faster, I pick up speed and hit shallow water. I can\u2019t help grinning at the sight of her. Last night I was pissed as hell at her, but now seeing her\u2014it all just slides away because the sexy, sassy, and funny-as-hell girl that won\u2019t let me call her mine is waiting for me. Waving a hand in the air, I shake the water from my hair and tuck my board under my arm.</p><p>\u201cYou made it,\u201d I yell as I emerge from the water.</p><p>\u201cI did,\u201d she says, shading her eyes with her hand.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s your board?\u201d</p><p>She shrugs. \u201cI don\u2019t have one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, then\u2014it looks like we\u2019ll be taking turns.\u201d</p><p>My gaze sweeps the length of her and once my body stops humming in desire, I curl my fingers over my mouth to stifle my laughter at what she wore to surf in\u2014a flowered green bikini with gold strings at the neck and hipbones, earrings, and even a necklace. She looks f**king beautiful, like Miss America. She\u2019s even wearing sparkly sandals. And even though today isn\u2019t about winning a beauty pageant, I can\u2019t help approaching the unrivaled winner with a cheerful smirk.</p><p>As I close the distance I feel something shifting between us. It\u2019s in the way she\u2019s looking at me. Her alluring features come clearly into focus\u2014the long strands of her red hair blowing in the wind, her full br**sts popping out from beneath her tiny top, the curvy shape of her hips, and f**k me, she has a belly button ring. I try to tame the thudding of my pulse, but it isn\u2019t easy. It\u2019s been hard enough keeping my hands off her, well, semi off her, with her clothes on\u2014this is going to be hell.</p><p>Kicking the sand up beneath my feet, I lift my gaze upward, where I notice the sparkle in her emerald green eyes. A slight sense of pride overtakes me because her eyes are shimmering. I think they might even be dancing with anticipation. It thrills me that she\u2019s here this early to surf and happy about it. Just a few short weeks ago I wasn\u2019t sure what I saw when I looked into her eyes. At first I thought maybe hate, anger, disgust\u2014or possibly a combination of just about every negative emotion. But it was fear and I\u2019ve been taking the time to make it clear that she\u2019s mine. I\u2019ve been doing it subtly, but I will do it.</p><p>When a cool breeze presents itself on the shoreline, I stop on my heels and dig my board into the sand. I move a little closer but know I should keep a healthy distance between us. Although it doesn\u2019t seem to matter how close or far away she is, I haven\u2019t been able to stop thinking about her. She bends down to rub some sunscreen on. When she does her br**sts spill out farther from her top and I have to suppress a groan. I take a deep breath and sure enough, it\u2019s there\u2014that lemony citrus smell that\u2019s everywhere when she\u2019s around.</p><p>I lean down and reach for the bottle. \u201cHere, let me help you.\u201d</p><p>My guess is she\u2019ll say no, so when she hands me the bottle I\u2019m shocked.</p><p>She stands straight and turns around, lifting her hair as she does. \u201cYou can do my back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was thinking I\u2019d start with the front,\u201d I say, my voice going deep all on its own.</p><p>I notice her stiffen before she hands me the sunscreen over her shoulder. It\u2019s cool in my hands and I rub my palms together to warm it. My fingers cover her shoulders and the back of her neck. I knead her skin ever so slightly and slide down under the strings in the front a little. She gasps and I\u2019m pretty sure it\u2019s not from the chill of the lotion. Her skin is soft and I notice a few faint freckles I never knew she had on her shoulders\u2014they\u2019re sexy as hell. Her head drops as I rub down her back. When I get midway I caress the skin spilling out from the sides of her tiny top, and again a slight shiver rocks her shoulders. I grin to myself like a Cheshire cat.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re full of tension. You could use a massage,\u201d I whisper in her ear, moving down her back a little more until my fingertips rest on the fabric of her bottoms. I let them slip inside teasingly and pull them back out.</p><p>She jumps and turns around. \u201cI\u2019m good. That\u2019s enough,\u201d she says, sounding a little flustered.</p><p>I grin and hand her back the bottle. \u201cIf you say so. I just didn\u2019t want you to burn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s not that hot today anyway.\u201d</p><p>As the words leave her lips and I\u2019m just about to tell her the temperature has nothing to do with the strength of the sun\u2019s rays, I notice she\u2019s wearing makeup and I have to try hard to suppress my laughter.</p><p>Squinting, she puts her hands on her hips. \u201cWhat is so funny?\u201d</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cNothing.\u201d</p><p>She purses her lips and narrows her eyes.</p><p>I just smile at her and pull her sunglasses from atop her silky soft hair and place them on her face. I let my thumbs linger for a few short seconds and caress her cheek.</p><p>\u201cThere, now you don\u2019t have to squint.\u201d</p><p>She touches their sides. \u201cThank you,\u201d she says, and I can see her ni**les protruding in hard nubs.</p><p>I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s from the water I dripped on her or my touch, but I\u2019m going with the latter. I\u2019ve behaved myself for much longer than I ever thought I could. But I know she wants me and if she won\u2019t admit it, I\u2019m going to have to push her along a little. The old me would already have done that. Hell, the old me would never have allowed a girl to call the shots.</p><p>But I\u2019ve made too many wrong decisions in my life and have too many atonements to make. And she deserves one of them. The fact that she\u2019s even talking to me is enough reason to stick around. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She smooths one last squirt of sunscreen over her chest and my eyes drop again to her hard ni**les beading through the fabric of her bikini top. Fuck, now I\u2019m sure I\u2019m popping out too.</p><p>Averting my eyes in a useless attempt to tame my dick, I have this sudden realization. \u201cRed?\u201d I ask.</p><p>She looks up at me.</p><p>\u201cHave you ever surfed before?\u201d</p> <p>She scrunches her brow. \u201cNo. But how hard can it be?\u201d</p><p>I try not to choke on my laughter. \u201cMaybe just a little harder than you think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m here. So you can teach me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d I say, scratching my head because it\u2019s just that easy.</p><p>She smiles.</p> <p>I take a deep breath and rub my hands together. \u201cOkay, let\u2019s do this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d She beams at me and does a slight jump into the air. Her earrings bob and her necklaces jangle as she heads toward the water.</p><p>I love how excited she gets and really hate to disappoint her, but I grab her hand and pull her back. \u201cWhoa, where are you going?\u201d</p><p>She whips her head around. \u201cTo surf.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah . . . not quite yet.\u201d I give her a serious look.</p><p>She looks at me, confused. \u201cOkay, what is it?\u201d</p> <p>I step toward her and even with the chill in the air, a heat flares between us regardless of what \u201cguidelines\u201d have been set. Today the attraction feels stronger than ever. But now that I have a mission, teach S\u2019belle Wilde how to surf, I have something to take my mind off it\u2014for now. I push forward and answer her question. \u201cYou can\u2019t surf with your jewelry on. You have to be able to move without restraint,\u201d I tell her.</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d she says, shrugging before circling her hands around her neck. The wind catches in her hair, and the necklaces seem to get caught in it.</p><p>\u201cLook down,\u201d I say.</p><p>She does without question and I carefully untangle the necklaces from her hair and remove them from around her neck. When she raises her head, her eyes lift to meet mine and we stare at each other for a few short moments. My heart is beating wildly and I have to cut my glance sideways to slow its pace. With the necklaces gripped firmly in the palm of my hand, I step closer and pinch my fingers around her earlobe to gently remove the hoop from her ear. \u201cThese too.\u201d</p><p>Her breathing quickens, I can see it in the rise and fall of her chest. With almost no space between us, her eyes meet mine again and we speak to each other clearly without words. We seem to be able to communicate best that way, or maybe we are just more honest about our feelings with our silent acknowledgments? I\u2019m not sure. But our relationship began with unspoken words and has moved painfully slowly in the very same manner.</p><p>The sun beats down, but that\u2019s not where the heat I feel is coming from. When the rays become even brighter as the morning clouds burn away, I blink rapidly at the sudden abundance of light shining on us. The magnetism between us is undeniable and I have to remind myself of what I am doing. Glancing down, my eyes hit my board. Yes, right, getting her ready for our surf lesson. Shifting my gaze, I catch the sparkle in the sand and grin before saying, \u201cOne last thing.\u201d</p><p>She watches as I drop to my knees. I let my fingertips trail down her legs on the way and notice the deep breath she draws in. I motion for her to lift her foot and set it on my leg. When she does she braces her hand on my shoulder and her touch sears me, makes me ache for her. I try to catch her gaze, but my eyes dart to the gleam in her belly button. The ring pierced inside it is a four-leaf clover fabricated with gold and green emeralds.</p><p>Glancing up, I ask, \u201cAre you Irish?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cA little. My grandfather was Irish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that the significance of this?\u201d I point to the clover.</p><p>She stiffens. \u201cNo, it\u2019s not.\u201d</p><p>My eyes are pulled back to it. I want nothing more than to run my tongue around it: it takes every ounce of control I have not to. I have to keep reminding myself I\u2019m supposed to be teaching her how to surf. Focusing on the task at hand, I glide my fingers across the top of her foot as I slowly unbuckle the sandal strap. Her leg quivers slightly from the contact. I run my palms up the back of her calf. Her skin is soft and smooth and feels so good. I grip her calf tightly as I raise her leg slightly and slowly remove her sandal. Brushing some of the sand off her perfectly painted toes, I drop my knee to the ground and to steady herself she rests her other hand on my bare shoulder. Her body cages my head. With her stomach so close to my mouth, I let my lips skim the ornament. Nothing that seems obnoxious, just enough to let her know that I want her.</p><p>Her whole body trembles and she quickly stands up straight. \u201cI can do the other one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, please let me,\u201d I insist with a devilish grin.</p><p>Once I\u2019ve repeated the process, I can only hope that it turned her on as much as it turned me on. With my heart pounding and my pulse racing, I stand up and take a deep breath. Letting it out, I let my eyes rove over her one more time\u2014she\u2019s so f**king sexy. When they land on her face, I pause and allow our eyes to lock. Then I force myself to shake away the thoughts of what I want to do to her and instead lift the large bag she\u2019s got draped over her shoulder and dump everything I\u2019m holding in it. \u201cThere, now you\u2019re almost ready. Just tie your hair back so it doesn\u2019t catch in the wind.\u201d</p><p>While she fumbles through her bag, I take a moment to pull myself together. When I agreed to this friends thing, I knew I was agreeing to take it slow, but it feels like utter torture with her standing in front of me practically n*ked and I can\u2019t help blurring the lines a little. In the past if a girl I was interested in had ever thrown out the friend word, I would have deleted her number from my phone. But there\u2019s just something about S\u2019belle . . .</p><p>She lifts her arms and pulls her hair up off her shoulders. She smiles at me as I watch her. Yeah, there\u2019s something about her. Everything about her is sexy as hell\u2014the way she moves, the faces she makes when she\u2019s concentrating on something, even the way she stands.</p><p>\u201cReady,\u201d she says with a small bounce.</p><p>Does she have any idea what that does to me? I scan her body again as I pick my board up, and this time I notice the hint of a scar peeking out from her bathing suit bottoms.</p><p>I point to it. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>She glances down and quickly adjusts her bottoms.</p><p>She blows some stray pieces of hair out of her eyes. \u201cAre we going to start this lesson today or what?\u201d</p><p>I laugh and toss my board to the ground. I sit on it and pat the empty space beside me.</p><p>She stares at me.</p><p>\u201cSit down.\u201d</p><p>She does but makes sure our bodies don\u2019t touch.</p><p>I smirk over at her. \u201cLet\u2019s go over the guidelines.\u201d</p><p>She blinks at me without speaking.</p><p>\u201cThe guidelines of surfing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSurfing has guidelines?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore like generalities, things you should know. But I\u2019ll call them guidelines.\u201d</p><p>She rolls her eyes.</p><p>I grin and raise a finger. \u201cNumber one, the instructor must always be respected.\u201d</p><p>She laughs and shoves my shoulder. Again her skin against mine feels anything but wrong.</p><p>I raise an eyebrow.</p><p>\u201cGo on, I\u2019m listening,\u201d she says.</p><p>\u201cFirst, do you know what a rip current is?\u201d</p><p>She shakes her head.</p><p>Five minutes into my guidelines, it\u2019s apparent she has no knowledge whatsoever about surfing and there\u2019s no way I\u2019m letting her go out there on a board today. When she asked to come surfing, I assumed she knew how\u2014but she doesn\u2019t even know how to stand on a board or which end is which.</p><p>We need to start with the basics. I find a stick to draw in the sand. She pays attention and her eagerness to attempt surfing does nothing but fuel the fire between us. I point out to the water. \u201cShe\u2019s in charge out there. You have to respect her. Know what you can handle and what you can\u2019t. No two waves are ever the same.\u201d</p><p>An hour of Surfing 101 later, we both need a break. She takes a sip from the water bottle I hand to her, and some spills from her mouth down to her chest. Immediately I have a vision of licking the drips up for her. When she bends over toward her giant purse, I follow the lines of her body and notice the sand sticking everywhere and think I should wipe it off for her. But she stands with a cup of grapes in her hand before I get close enough.</p><p>I bite down on my lower lip instead. \u201cDo you have a picnic lunch in there too? Because if not we need to take a break and eat.\u201d</p><p>She pops a grape in her mouth. \u201cNo.\u201d She laughs. \u201cI stopped and grabbed these with my coffee this morning, but I think I should have picked up some sandwiches too. I didn\u2019t know it was going to take this long to learn to surf.\u201d She blows some hair out of her eyes.</p><p>I can\u2019t help laughing at her. \u201cI\u2019m only kidding.\u201d</p><p>She extends her hand, offering me the cup. \u201cWant some?\u201d</p><p>I flash her a boyish grin. \u201cYes, I want some.\u201d I move closer and tuck that same strand of hair back behind her ear before curling my hand around hers and pinching a grape from the container.</p><p>Our faces are so close that it\u2019s hard to tell whose breathing is louder. But I\u2019m sure it\u2019s mine when she lowers herself to the ground and brushes against me before she takes a seat. She wipes her face and drinks thirstily from the bottle.</p><p>\u201cYou all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I think I just need a breather. This is hard.\u201d</p><p>I plop down beside her. \u201cWant to go grab some food? Call it a day?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019m having fun.\u201d She buries her toes in the sand and I mimic her action.</p><p>\u201cOkay, but let\u2019s take a short break.\u201d</p><p>She nods.</p><p>We sit on the shore in comfortable silence for a bit and both watch the way the waves break. I assess the wind conditions as she studies the current rolling in. But I also find myself glancing over at her and thinking about how much fun I\u2019ve had with her over the past few weeks. And even though we haven\u2019t had sex, I\u2019ve enjoyed her company. I seem to want her near me all the time. It\u2019s not a feeling I\u2019m used to. But sex or not, things have definitely progressed between us since our first date. And I haven\u2019t pushed her. I\u2019ve let her set the pace for the most part. And the fact that she joined me this morning in something she knows I love triggers an odd feeling in my stomach.</p><p>CHAPTER 14</p><p>I Choose You</p><p>Bell</p><p>It\u2019s a beautiful day for the beach. The sun is shining, there\u2019s just a slight breeze, and he\u2019s here sitting next to me.</p><p>He leans in close and startles me. \u201cLook over there. Watch what he does.\u201d</p><p>With a grin, we both watch the guy as waves rise from under him and he catches one just right. \u201cIt looks like heaven.\u201d</p><p>He jumps to his feet and pulls me up. \u201cCome on, let\u2019s do this. Lie down on the board on your stomach.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShouldn\u2019t we be in the water?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRed, you have a few dry land lessons to complete before we take you out there.\u201d</p><p>My hands go to my hips. \u201cWhat do you mean? Surfing is done in the water, not on the beach.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, it is. But not for us\u2014not today.\u201d</p><p>I pout my lips but mostly for show because dry lessons means his hands are on me, and I can\u2019t deny how much I like his touch.</p><p>He drops down on the board and all his muscles flex in the most delicious way. \u201cLike this. See, you have to move fast.\u201d He snaps from his stomach to his feet. \u201cIt looks easy but it\u2019s not. Speed is what matters. And as simple as it sounds, the less time you spend trying to get to your feet, the more success you\u2019ll have staying up. Do you know how to stand on the board?\u201d</p><p>My eyes are ogling the ridges of his abdominal muscles and I fear I might be drooling.</p><p>\u201cRed? You got that?\u201d</p><p>I start to shake my head mostly because I haven\u2019t tried to process what he said, not because I don\u2019t understand it. I was too busy looking at what I haven\u2019t seen in what seems like a very long time. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cCome here.\u201d His tone is commanding and his voice deep.</p><p>I take a step and position myself right in front of him where he wants me. He nudges my feet apart with his, and the friction between his toes and my skin makes my pulse throb in places I didn\u2019t even know it could.</p><p>\u201cThis is the tail,\u201d he says, pointing to where my back leg is.</p><p>I shift my eyes and curl my toes into his. \u201cGot it,\u201d I say as my mouth goes dry.</p> <p>\u201cAnd this is the midpoint,\u201d he says, trailing his fingertips down my thigh and peering over my shoulder.</p><p>By now I\u2019m unable to speak and we stay like this for a few heartbeats\u2014he\u2019s standing close behind me in a provocative way. When his hands go to my hips, I have to close my eyes. He adjusts my stance so that my back is flush with his stomach and all I can think about is how much I need to have him.</p><p>\u201cJust like this,\u201d he whispers in my ear. His voice is hoarse.</p><p>His fingers glide up my skin from my h*ps to my waist as he realigns my stance. I wonder if he can feel my racing heartbeat. I can\u2019t help myself and I lean into him, pressing the small of my back into what I already knew was there\u2014his erection. He pops off the board like a rocket. My eyes snap open and his gaze follows every curve of my body before landing on my face.</p><p>He clears his throat. \u201cOkay, so next you\u2019ll move from a horizontal position up to your feet. Got it?\u201d</p> <p>I chew on my lip. Does he have any idea how crazy he\u2019s making me? I swear he\u2019s doing it on purpose. But I do as he instructs and lie on my stomach. When I swivel my gaze, I notice he averts his stare toward the water.</p><p>\u201cOkay, Red, snap,\u201d he snaps.</p><p>I hop to my feet but lose my balance and stumble down on top of the sand. He dashes to catch me but ends up landing on top of me instead. His body molds to mine perfectly and the closeness and familiarity make me crave him in a way that\u2019s painful. I don\u2019t push him away and he doesn\u2019t move. Both of us are breathing hard and I can feel his heart beating as erratically as mine.</p><p>After a beat, he rises to his elbows and looks down at me. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p><p>I nod and watch as his eyes dart to my lips, then to my eyes. My hands move on their own and when I grasp his jaw a guttural moan escapes his mouth. I can no longer fight the feeling. I no longer want to. He lowers his head and hovers his mouth over my lips. I want him to kiss me. I know he wants to. But when the coolness of the water surrounds us, I scream. He quickly stands, grabbing my arm and bringing me with him. The tide rolls in and he laughs as I brush water from my face. I pull the tie from my hair and discover that the water has brought back my curls.</p><p>He twists a piece of my hair around my finger. \u201cI like your hair curly. I remember it this way.\u201d</p> <p>I blow some stray strands out of my eyes as he runs his fingers through my hair.</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d I ask, surprised.</p><p>He moves closer to me. \u201cYes. I do. I really do.\u201d</p><p>I smile and tuck a piece of my wild locks behind my ear. I stare up at him into those blue eyes. \u201cWhy can\u2019t we take the board into the water?\u201d</p><p>He grabs my hand and points out into the vast ocean with it. \u201cBecause that out there is dangerous and I don\u2019t want you to get hurt. I\u2019ll let you know when you\u2019re ready.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo we\u2019ll do this again?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cI hope so. I\u2019d like to think I\u2019m a good teacher.\u201d He smirks at me.</p><p>Moments pass without words while I stare at him, but I think he knows what I\u2019m thinking. I step closer to him and grab his other hand.</p> <p>He moves into me, leaving no space between us. His eyes are locked on mine.</p><p>\u201cRemember when you asked me what would happen to my guidelines when I changed my mind?\u201d I ask.</p><p>His thumbs skim over my thighs with our fingers still laced at our sides. \u201cYeah. Yeah, I do.\u201d He offers me a sexy grin. \u201cYou said you didn\u2019t see it going that far.\u201d</p><p>The heat between us is almost unbearable as he gazes into my eyes. He closes the final space that separates us.</p><p>I run my palms up his chest. \u201cWell, it\u2019s every girl\u2019s prerogative to say those words and to change her mind after. You told me to tell you if I changed my mind and . . . Ben, I have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck,\u201d he groans.</p><p>I nod with a glimmer in my eye because that\u2019s just what I want to do.</p><p>\u201cFuck,\u201d he groans again.</p><p>A few more moments of silence pass as we communicate without words.</p><p>He places his hands on both sides of my face. \u201cWhat made you change your mind?\u201d</p><p>I push the hair from his eyes. \u201cYou.\u201d</p><p>With a devilish grin he asks, \u201cWould you care to elaborate?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLater,\u201d I say, making my voice sound low and enticing.</p><p>He nods and then tangles his fingers in my hair, pulling me so tight against him I know he can feel my hard ni**les against his bare chest. I caress the skin of his back and when his fingers sneak beneath the golden string of my bikini top, I shiver. My hands move to his shoulders, his neck, his hair. He looks down into my eyes but still hasn\u2019t kissed me.</p><p>\u201cWhy haven\u2019t you kissed me?\u201d I ask in a breathy voice.</p><p>The corners of his lips quirk up. \u201cI\u2019m enjoying watching you,\u201d he says.</p><p>But I think it\u2019s more. I think he wants to make sure I want this. And I do. I don\u2019t care about anything other than him right now. So I make sure he sees nothing but absolute certainty in my eyes. And then just like that, he grabs my face. Our mouths meet, our tongues collide, and we breathe each other in. We kiss with a hunger that I\u2019m almost certain can never be satisfied. Time slips away as our hands move freely roaming over each other in ways they shouldn\u2019t in a public place. With my heart thundering in my ears, my pulse racing, and my breathing out of control, I never want this moment to end.</p><p>Then just like that, he breaks our connection. My mind is whirling with how much I want him, right here, right now. The beach is fairly secluded, even if it\u2019s not private.</p><p>\u201cCome back to my place with me,\u201d he whispers.</p><p>And I want to. I really do. But I can\u2019t. I run my palms down his chest, trying to soothe the sting that\u2019s about to come. \u201cI can\u2019t. I have Ivy\u2019s release party tonight. I should have left already.\u201d</p><p>He rests his forehead against mine and grabs my fingers, lacing our hands together. \u201cLater tonight, then,\u201d he says, and kisses me once more.</p><p>CHAPTER 15</p><p>Show Me</p><p>Ben</p><p>Having the freedom to finally touch her makes me feel like a kid in the candy store. The beach is quiet, with few surfers in the water and even fewer cars in the parking lot. I\u2019ve thought about her, remembered what she felt like, ached for her body to touch mine for so many weeks you\u2019d think knowing we will finally be together in just a few short hours would be enough, but it isn\u2019t. I don\u2019t want to wait.</p><p>But I walk her to her car with my hand resting on her ass, all the while whispering things in her ear that I\u2019m going to do to her. She looks up at me, a glimmer in her eyes, and I swear I growl at her.</p><p>When we reach the parking lot I step in front of her and lift her chin, forcing her eyes to mine. \u201cI want you wearing this when I see you later.\u201d</p><p>She pushes up on her toes and bites on my lip. \u201cI thought you\u2019d want me wearing nothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck,\u201d I mutter. \u201cYou\u2019re killing me.\u201d</p><p>She smiles in that sexy way she has.</p><p>I can feel myself turning predatory. With a slide of my hands into her bikini bottoms, I palm her ass. We walk the rest of the way like that to the car with our lips locked. Only when she fumbles for her keys in her purse do I remove my hands. But when I hear the click of the lock, I open the door quickly and push her up against the opening. She gasps and threads her fingers through my hair. Then I kiss her hard. Her lips are soft and taste like mint\u2014I\u2019ve never forgotten their taste. I run my hands over her bathing suit top and then down her bare stomach, where I stop to finger the clover I saw earlier. \u201cYou\u2019re so f**king sexy,\u201d I murmur.</p><p>She freezes for a moment but then lets out a soft moan when my fingertips graze the edge of her bikini bottoms. I twist my head to survey the area. Her car is parked at the end of the lot and we seem fairly isolated. If I could f**k her here I would, but we\u2019ve already gone down that road. The next time I have her, I want her in my bed. But that doesn\u2019t mean I won\u2019t settle for leaving her thinking about me until she sees me again.</p><p>\u201cRed,\u201d I whisper over her mouth.</p><p>\u201cHmm . . . ,\u201d she breathes, nipping at my lip.</p><p>I don\u2019t say anything else. Instead I rub the heel of my palm over her pu**y.</p><p>Her lips part and she makes that quiet sound again.</p><p>\u201cDo you like that?\u201d I ask her.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she answers, her breath blowing hot against my neck.</p><p>I slide my fingers inside the golden string of her bottoms and stroke them up and down before stopping to massage her clit.</p><p>Her eyes widen and her head bobs side to side.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay. Don\u2019t worry, no one can see you with me standing in front of you,\u201d I whisper in her ear. \u201cDo you like how this feels?\u201d</p><p>She gasps, nodding and digging her fingers into my flesh.</p><p>I kiss up her neck and stop to whisper in her ear, \u201cYou\u2019re so wet.\u201d</p><p>My c**k grows so hard it throbs almost painfully as I watch her\u2014the way her eyelids close, the way her mouth parts, and how her hold on me tightens with every move of my hand. I want to touch her everywhere. I want to kiss every spot on her body and then sink deep inside her. But here in the parking lot there\u2019s no way I can do that. With one arm shielding one side of us and her car door shielding the other, I move my fingers mercilessly in and out of her, wishing they were my cock. My pulse pounds in my ears when she buries her head in my neck and whispers something I can\u2019t hear. The waves crash against the rocks, the wind whistles as it blows, but there is no mistaking her muffled cries of pleasure. She nips at the skin on my neck while digging her nails into my shoulders, but I don\u2019t stop. I want her to remember me. Her body pulses against my hand and only when her body shudders and a much louder \u201cOh God, yes\u201d escapes her lips do I stop.</p><p>\u201cYou make me so hot,\u201d I murmur in her ear.</p><p>\u201cThat was nothing,\u201d she purrs.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t wait to see something, then.\u201d</p><p>She cups my face and pulls me in to look at her. \u201cI can\u2019t wait to do something to you.\u201d</p><p>Fuck. She can\u2019t wait. I can\u2019t wait. I slide my hand out of her bottoms and around to her ass, pushing her into me so she can feel how much I want her. Her hands slide down my chest to my board shorts, but I grab them.</p><p>\u201cLater,\u201d I whisper in her ear.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t leave you like this,\u201d she giggles, pushing her h*ps into my erection.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you have to go to work?\u201d</p><p>She nods. \u201cI\u2019m probably already going to be late.\u201d</p><p>I pull both our hands to my mouth and kiss hers. Then I smack her ass. \u201cSo get going. Now!\u201d</p><p>She rubs her ass but I didn\u2019t hit it hard.</p><p>I smile. \u201cYou like that, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Her head drops and her hair covers her face so I can\u2019t see it.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to answer. I already know you do.\u201d</p><p>She collapses into the seat of her car but pulls me down for one last kiss. \u201cBen . . .\u201d</p><p>I pause and look at her.</p><p>\u201cIt really will be worth the wait. I promise.\u201d</p><p>I shake my head and stand there as she puts her car in DRIVE. Then something occurs to me and I chase after her, pounding on the door.</p><p>She stops and opens her window. \u201cAre you crazy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I just wanted to tell you, don\u2019t let the past dictate the future, okay? We\u2019ll work it out. I promise.\u201d</p><p>A mix of motions drifts across her face but none I can nail. She nods and closes her window and I watch as she drives away. With a grin I wouldn\u2019t want her to see in the mirror, I think how much I like the way she kisses me, the way her lips taste, how much I love touching her\u2014everywhere. Then when her car disappears around the bend, I take off toward the cold water of the ocean to ease the pain of my throbbing cock. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>The sun is just beginning to set once I decide to pack up and head out, so it\u2019s not too blinding. Blondie\u2019s is just a few feet away. My feet kick up little bits of sand as I walk down the familiar beach with my board tucked under my arm and think what a big day tomorrow is for me. November first marks the day the announcement of both takeovers will be made, but more important, shares of Plan B will be available to the public. It\u2019s a huge financial risk as well as an excellent opportunity for me.</p><p>\u201cHey, man,\u201d I greet Noel.</p><p>He beams. \u201cHey, Benny boy. How was it out there?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFucking amazing. I haven\u2019t spent the whole day out on her in months.\u201d</p><p>He smiles, baring his yellowing teeth and pride at the same time.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t expect to still see you in here this late. Faith isn\u2019t going to be happy if you miss dinner.\u201d I wink at him.</p><p>\u201cFuck, what time is it?\u201d he says, looking at his watch.</p><p>I shrug as I lean my board against the wall. \u201cThe sun\u2019s just about down, so it must be close to your dinnertime.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFuck. Come home with me. Have dinner with us. Then Faith can\u2019t be pissed off at me for being late,\u201d he begs.</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t tonight. Sorry, you\u2019re on your own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn, boy, way to make a grown man beg.\u201d</p><p>I just shake my head.</p><p>He opens the avocado green fridge and pulls out two cold ones. He tosses me one and I catch it but shake my head no and place the can on the counter.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be a f**king pansy ass.\u201d But Noel says it with a grin.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll give you pansy ass,\u201d I tell him as I grab a long board hanging on the wall. I skateboarded all the time as a kid, so I have no doubt my agility will prevail. I give this bad boy a spin around the shop worth my time. I move fast. Of course the adrenaline coursing through my body certainly helps. When I stop, I flip the end and push it his way. \u201cYour turn.\u201d</p><p>His hands go up surrender-style, as he shakes his head no, then strides over to lock the front door.</p><p>\u201cCome on,\u201d I coax. \u201cWho\u2019s being the pansy ass now? I thought the coolest thing about long boards is that you could even sell them to dudes\u2019 grandmas.\u201d</p><p>We both laugh again but this time at the sales spiel he gives the kids in his shop who come to work for him. I know it well. I spent so many hours here as a teenager. As he closes the place down, I pull my shirt from my bag and slide into it, tugging my jeans over my board shorts before slipping into my boots, not bothering to tie them. \u201cThanks for letting me leave my shit here. I still haven\u2019t had a rack put on my new car yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you keep saying. And I\u2019ll keep saying anytime, you know that. And, Ben, Faith would really love to see you.\u201d</p><p>I nod. \u201cI\u2019ll call you next week. I might just come and bring a guest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh yeah? You decided to chase some lucky girl?\u201d he asks.</p><p>\u201cYou know what, Noel, I did.\u201d</p> <p>He slaps his hand on my shoulder. \u201cThat\u2019s the way, boy.\u201d</p><p>We both walk out the back door together and as he hops in his truck he yells, \u201cDon\u2019t forget to call me.\u201d</p><p>I wave good-bye. \u201cI won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>The shiny black paint of my BMW touring bike is gleaming off the reflection of the streetlights. Its low silhouette and sleek shape are all that remain in the parking lot at this time of night. I can\u2019t stifle my smile when I see her green helmet with sparkles enameled in it strapped on its back. As I hop on I catch sight of where her car was parked earlier and remember what it felt like to touch her again, but for some reason it felt different this time\u2014even better if that\u2019s possible. The next few hours can\u2019t fly by fast enough. I pull my phone from my pocket and scroll through my short list of contacts until I find her name\u2014then I send her a quick text.</p><p>I\u2019ll pick you up. I don\u2019t want you driving back here tonight so late.</p><p>I\u2019m more than capable of driving in the dark and I didn\u2019t invite you over.</p><p>I\u2019ll be there at eleven.</p><p>I said I didn\u2019t invite you over.</p><p>I said I\u2019d be there at eleven.</p><p>Fine. But don\u2019t come in.</p><p>I stare at my screen and shake my head. I\u2019ll be patient and wait until she\u2019s ready to tell her family, but not for too long. Of course I understand her hesitation. I\u2019m done with secrets and hiding things. I\u2019ve had enough of that shit to last a lifetime.</p><p>With the handlebars beneath my palms, I grip tight as the wind whips all around me and the dark sky meets the horizon before me. My intent when I took today off from work was that it would be a day of reflection. It\u2019s Halloween, which officially marks one year to the day that my downward spiral into oblivion began, which eventually resulted in me hitting rock bottom\u2014hard. I was lost for many long months, but I\u2019ve since found myself . . . becoming a better person.</p><p>Aside from walking around constantly feeling I\u2019d been stabbed in the heart and punched in the gut at the same time, I was down and out with no one to turn to. My relationship with my sister had suffered from my blatant disregard of anyone else\u2019s feelings but my own. My friendship with Caleb had been strained from my deceitfulness, and even though we seemed to be back on track, he wasn\u2019t around. He was away training to become an FBI agent. And honestly, aside from Dahl I had no one left in my life. That\u2019s when I took off for Australia.</p><p>I spent four months there and loved every minute of it. When I returned to California I decided to live in LA in hopes of getting my old job back. But that too didn\u2019t go as planned. Not only did I live in a shithole motel for way too long, but I ended up as the wedding columnist for my old editor. I wanted my investigative journalist job back, but since I wouldn\u2019t play ball and divulge my source for the piece on the drug cartel or turn over the article I had written more than three years ago but never published, she pigeonholed me into a job she knew I\u2019d hate. But I couldn\u2019t give her what she wanted. First of all, I no longer had any of that shit. I had given it all to Caleb. And second, my journalistic code of honor prevented me from divulging my sources. Taking the job she offered was just another poor choice I made in a long list of poor choices.</p><p>But I had already been down so many twisted roads I couldn\u2019t see straight anymore. Pinpointing a single catalyst is hard, but if I had to choose one I would say it was the investigation. And although the investigation might be why I had to leave my old life, it\u2019s not why I lost myself. But for the longest time I used it as the reason. Why wouldn\u2019t I?</p><p>The whole thing was so f**ked up. It started out as a simple task\u2014publish an article on drug trafficking. Easy enough, I thought . . . just research it, write it, gain critical attention, rise to the top\u2014and I\u2019d be the next Anderson Cooper. Well, that\u2019s not how it went down. The story I was investigating was not only way bigger than I ever could have imagined, but also much more dangerous. Dangerous enough that my subject wanted to kill me and threatened to kill my girl if I didn\u2019t stop. But even when I did stop, that wasn\u2019t enough\u2014they were coming after me. So I faked my own death and disappeared for what I thought would be the rest of my life.</p><p>I defected to New York City and lived there for three years as Alex Coven. The first two years were rough, but by the third year I started to make a life for myself. I was hanging out with a girl I liked, started swimming and running again, stopped the excessive drinking, and even made a few friends. But that life seemed small and worthless the day the FBI knocked on my door and told me I could go back home to California. I didn\u2019t even have to think about it. All I knew was I had a second chance to get my old life back and I wanted it . . . all of it, including my girl, Dahlia London.</p><p>But three years was a long time to be gone, and things change, people change. Dahl wasn\u2019t the same girl I left behind. She was harder, maybe stronger, maybe more broken . . . I don\u2019t know exactly, but I do know she wasn\u2019t in love with me anymore. I tried to get her back, but it didn\u2019t take long to figure out I couldn\u2019t. I stopped my worthless efforts after my mother died. It was never going to happen anyway, especially after Dahl found out I had cheated on her in college and wouldn\u2019t you know it\u2014it was with the sister of the guy she now loved.</p><p>Then as if that wasn\u2019t enough, my beloved mother suffered a stroke and passed away. After that I didn\u2019t give a f**k about anything anymore. I just wanted to forget everything . . . who I was, what I\u2019d done, what had happened to me. Forget it all. And I can wholeheartedly say that no longer caring about anything was when I lost myself. I hit rock bottom because I didn\u2019t give a shit about anyone, not even myself.</p><p>My final wrong step came the day I watched Dahl\u2019s attacker and my shooter, Josh Hart, being found guilty of a pony charge. I couldn\u2019t take it anymore and as I was drowning myself in a bottle of Jack, my ex-girlfriend from New York City called me. Kimberly was looking for company and since I was too, I went to her. She was drunk, I was drunk, and I f**ked her as if she were someone else. Of course Kimberly threw my ass out. I left her apartment full of guilt and not paying the least bit of attention to how much alcohol I had consumed.</p><p>That night I was pulled over and arrested for driving while intoxicated and had no one to call\u2014Caleb was MIA, Serena was in Hawaii with Trent, and my only friends, Beck and Ruby, were out of town. That left me with only Dahl. And when I called her I was shocked that she came and bailed me out. My life changed after that. Maybe it was the arrest that scared the shit out of me, maybe it was closure\u2014I had felt nothing but friendship toward Dahl when she drove me home\u2014or maybe it was knowing I owed my mother more than the life I was leading.</p><p>But I turned things around after that day. I quit the job I hated, I let go of the loose ends to the investigation that I hadn\u2019t been able to put to rest, and I reconciled with my sister. I moved back to the place I loved\u2014Laguna. And in the process of moving back into my mother\u2019s house, my sister and I discovered that my mother had been awarded a ten-million-dollar settlement for my father\u2019s wrongful death and had willed it to us. With that money I knew what I wanted to do with my life\u2014help magazines suffering rejuvenate themselves.</p><p>I blink away the memories and look up. The stars above me are bright, the night is clear, and the air is warm, but I won\u2019t be taking my bike to pick up Bell tonight. I\u2019m not sure she\u2019d appreciate climbing on the back in a dress and heels even though I wouldn\u2019t mind. Hmm . . . maybe I should reconsider? Cruising up the hill to my driveway, I stop and put both feet on the ground\u2014my intent was that today would be a day of reflection, but now I see it as another new beginning.</p><p>CHAPTER 16</p><p>What Now</p><p>Bell</p><p>Magic is in the air. The Amazing Grace Sound Studios have been transformed into a place fit for a princess for the unveiling of Ivy\u2019s new album, My Mended Heart, and by none other than myself. I couldn\u2019t be prouder of how it turned out. Elation is buoying me and nothing is going to squash it. I can\u2019t believe how much one day can change everything\u2014put things in perspective. I shouldn\u2019t have been so worried about the past. I need to concentrate on the future . . . as Ben said. Because really\u2014that\u2019s all that matters.</p><p>I breathe in the scent of the flowers that fill the room and then shift my gaze to admire the glimmer of light from the crystal chandeliers. The room looks magical, just as I envisioned. Amazing Grace has been transformed from a concrete hangar into a glittering nightclub. With six crystal chandeliers, dozens of round tables, and more than a hundred vases of purple dahlias and, of course, a splash of ivy.</p><p>I\u2019m not late, but I\u2019m by no means early. Jack and my mom drop me off before they park the car because they know I\u2019m fretting. I have so much to do in so little time. Ivy and Xander are right on my heels and they try to catch up with me, but all I can squeeze out is a quick hello and congratulations. I have to run to make sure the food has arrived, and the table centers are just as I described, not to mention make sure Nix and Garrett get off the stage and stop fooling around. I\u2019m feeling a little overwhelmed and I also feel bad for not bringing Ben, but we had discussed it last week. I\u2019d told him I\u2019d be too busy to bring a guest. That was the truth, but not the whole truth. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He had laughed and said, \u201cSound Music received an invitation, but Aerie will be attending since my ownership of the company won\u2019t be made public until the following day.\u201d</p><p>Admittedly I was relieved. I still am. I\u2019m not ready to tell my family anything\u2014there are just too many variables. And thank God ownership of Sound Music has never come up so I haven\u2019t had to feign ignorance or lie.</p><p>\u201cGarrett, get off the stage and stop goofing around,\u201d I scold.</p><p>His brow creases. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you? You look really red.\u201d</p> <p>I feel my forehead. My temperature seems normal, but I\u2019m burning up. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t. Do you think you can help me out and find Leif? I want to make sure he has everything set up for Ivy to take the stage.\u201d</p><p>He scuffs the carpet with his foot and offers me a bright smile. \u201cAnything for you\u2014tomato face.\u201d He grins.</p><p>I shove his shoulder. \u201cCut it out.\u201d</p><p>He strides toward the bar area but stops and tosses over his shoulder, \u201cRed and green.\u201d He points to my shorts romper. \u201cYou\u2019re practically ready for Christmas.\u201d</p><p>I chase after him grabbing a napkin off the table, ready to swat him.</p> <p>\u201cI better make like a hockey player and get the puck out of here.\u201d He laughs.</p><p>I really missed the gang while they were gone on tour. I\u2019m glad that even though the Wilde Ones broke up they are all still working together at the studio. And of course we have the addition of Ivy now and her bassist, Leif Morgan, both of whom I adore. Speaking of adoring\u2014in walk my brother and Dahlia.</p><p>Dahlia looks amazing. She\u2019s wearing a pewter-colored halter dress with a chain neck and a large brooch at the center of the deep V. River looks pretty good himself in a suit much like Xander\u2019s, and he has opted for no tie. He and Dahlia are fashionably late as always, but since today is their one-year anniversary and I was practically late myself, I think it\u2019s perfectly acceptable.</p><p>I watch as River and Dahlia meet up with Xander and Ivy. I notice River search Xander\u2019s eyes, and if I hadn\u2019t been looking, I would never have noticed the slight nod Xander gives him. River grabs Xander around the neck and pulls him forward. Oh my God, the engagement. And it\u2019s River and Dahlia\u2019s anniversary too. What\u2019s wrong with me? I rush over but it\u2019s too late. The four of them are huddled together. I move fast, as fast as I can in these heels, but still Garrett beats me to them.</p><p>\u201cAw . . . I missed out on the hugs and kisses. What, because we all work together now I get shafted?\u201d he says.</p><p>I try to push forward to congratulate my brother, but there\u2019s a tap on my shoulder.</p> <p>\u201cHey, Dino, everything all set with the food?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, there were a few changes to the menu,\u201d he says softly.</p><p>\u201cLike what?\u201d I ask sternly.</p><p>Out of the corner of my eye, I see Garrett grab River by the collar and jerk him backward. \u201cDino, I\u2019ll be right back.\u201d</p><p>I head over to Garrett with my hands on my hips.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re late, dick. Come on,\u201d he quips to River. Then he starts to shake his h*ps and sing, \u201cLA, let\u2019s get this party started!\u201d</p><p>I guess the old band is going to have a jam session, because when I look toward the stage they\u2019re all up there\u2014River, Leif, Garrett, Nix, the drummer, and even Zane, River\u2019s replacement before Ivy. Since the crowd rushes the dance floor and throws their hands in the air, dancing to a cover of \u201cHands All Over,\u201d I decide to leave them alone. It\u2019s a record release party after all. It\u2019s then I notice I still have the napkin clenched in my hand, and thoughts of Ben instantly surface. His hands on my body, the way he knows just how to touch me. The way he made me come right there on the beach with firecrackers behind my eyelids.</p><p>\u201cBell, do you want the trays of champagne brought out now or after Ivy sings?\u201d Matt asks.</p> <p>I blink away my dreamy state, a little embarrassed that Matt might have just gotten a glimpse of what I was imagining. I shake away the thoughts for now and decide it\u2019s also time for me to get this party started.</p><p>\u201cAfter, I think,\u201d I say, and then go in search of Ivy.</p><p>\u201cFinally,\u201d I say when I find her. With my nerves calmed I get to look at her for the first time tonight. She looks utterly beautiful in her short dark blue sapphire satin dress. I\u2019m shocked that Xander hasn\u2019t had a heart attack yet over her wearing it\u2014it\u2019s not only sleeveless but backless as well. He\u2019s very protective over, as he says, what is his. But since the dress matches the color of her eyes as well as her sapphire star earrings, he must have let it go or maybe he\u2019s just more secure. Her earrings glitter from her ears like shooting stars from the sky. They make me smile every time I see them. They were my grandmother\u2019s and Ivy always admired them when she wore them. It seemed fitting that Mimi gave them to her, because she always thought Ivy was going to be a star.</p><p>\u201cCome with me,\u201d I tell her. \u201cSo?\u201d I ask.</p><p>She looks at me blankly.</p><p>I grab her hand and turn it over and there it is\u2014the engagement ring my father gave to my mother. I hug her tightly and whisper, \u201cCongratulations.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, Bell.\u201d</p><p>I pull away. \u201cNow come on, we have things to do.\u201d</p><p>I drag her over to the photo booth I rented. I have her pose a few times, well, maybe more than a few. Next Dino captures my attention and points to the table centers. They are missing the silver stars I asked to be confettied around the flowers.</p><p>\u201cI have to go,\u201d I say, running off to place some of the photographs in the centers instead.</p><p>Aerie sashays up to me as I\u2019m fixing the tables. \u201cBell, you look amazing. I love your outfit,\u201d she says in a really bubbly manner.</p><p>\u201cThank you. I love your look too.\u201d She looks very businesslike with a touch of sass\u2014her hair is in a bun and she\u2019s wearing a purple pantsuit with pumps, but surprisingly it\u2019s low-cut and shows a hint of cle**age.</p><p>She smiles. \u201cSo, how are things?\u201d</p><p>I know exactly what she\u2019s asking and I can\u2019t take the chance of discussing Ben here, so I deflect the question. \u201cWhere\u2019s Jagger?\u201d</p><p>She gestures toward the makeshift bar with her wineglass. \u201cOh, Jack caught him on our way in and they\u2019re huddled somewhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFilm talk?\u201d I roll my eyes.</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s so Jack. So, how\u2019s the movie anyway?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStill hasn\u2019t started filming. Production issues.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry to hear that.\u201d</p><p>She shrugs. \u201cI\u2019m going to get another drink before I tell Xander and River about Ben acquiring Sound Music magazine.\u201d</p><p>I gulp. \u201cOh.\u201d I want to say thanks for the heads-up because I plan to be nowhere near either of those conversations. I watch Aerie approach Xander and quickly avert my gaze, not even wanting to witness his reaction. When I scan the room, my eyes land on not only Tate but Romeo too. Romeo grins with a slight wave and I wave back, then head toward the hallway and into one of the offices we\u2019ve turned into our prep room. I suspect Tate brought Romeo as his plus one. Tate has been a friend of Jack\u2019s for a while, so I knew he\u2019d be invited. His father was Jack\u2019s business associate many years ago. But when did he become buddies with Romeo?</p><p>Once I have everything as organized as possible, I check my phone. No texts from Ben since before I left. I can\u2019t understand why. I feel so disappointed I could have invited him to come with me\u2014but I was too chicken. The thought of Ben in the same room with River and Xander seriously makes me almost break out in hives. In fact, my skin is itchy just thinking about it.</p><p>But Ivy and Xander offer the perfect distraction when I meet them in the hallway. We haven\u2019t spent that much time together since I\u2019ve been living in Ben World, but I\u2019ve known her since I was ten, so I feel a connection to her.</p><p>\u201cNo more pictures, Bell,\u201d she jokes.</p><p>I have to laugh. \u201cOh God, no. I think Xander might lose it if I ask him to smile one more time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s so funny?\u201d Xander asks, putting his arm around Ivy and pulling her to him. I love seeing him like this\u2014happy and in love.</p><p>\u201cNothing. Nothing at all,\u201d we both say in unison.</p><p>My phone dings and I quickly pull it out of the pocket of my little romper. Finally . . . Ben. Why is seeing him in such a short time making me so nervous? It\u2019s not as if we haven\u2019t sleep together before. I read his text.</p><p>Did I tell you how much I enjoyed the noises you made in the parking lot earlier?</p><p>A slight rosy color blooms on my cheeks\u2014I can feel it. My body already feels ten degrees hotter than it should, and his message only intensifies the heat.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s that? A guy? Maybe a boyfriend?\u201d Ivy teases.</p><p>Xander snorts. \u201cYou don\u2019t know Bell well enough yet\u2014she always has a boyfriend.\u201d</p><p>I try not to let his quip jab me in the heart, but it does. Yes, I always had a boyfriend, but they were never really boyfriends, not that he\u2019d understand that. I\u2019ve always had this overwhelming need to make men happy. It\u2019s deep-rooted, my therapist said\u2014stems from feeling that I couldn\u2019t make my father happy so I was trying to make up for that. But I\u2019ve worked through those issues now.</p><p>I redirect my attention to my brother and put my hands on my hips. \u201cI\u2019ll have you know, brother of mine, I have not had a boyfriend since Tate almost a year ago.\u201d</p><p>Xander raises his arms in surrender. \u201cWow, calm down. I didn\u2019t know. But I\u2019m just teasing you.\u201d</p><p>I roll my eyes at him and quickly text Ben back.</p><p>Did I tell you I make those sounds when I eat my favorite foods?</p><p>I slide my phone back into my pocket and watch Xander slip a stuffed mushroom in Ivy\u2019s mouth.</p><p>\u201cUm . . . these are so good,\u201d she says, and I want to gag. Fungus with bread crumbs is definitely not something I had selected for the menu tonight. I wonder what else got messed up.</p><p>\u201cHey, little sis, aren\u2019t those your favorite?\u201d he asks, pointing to a silver tray with scallops wrapped in bacon.</p><p>\u201cVery funny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you try one of them for old times?\u201d Xander asks.</p><p>\u201cNo, thank you,\u201d I say almost menacingly.</p><p>\u201cI dare you,\u201d he challenges.</p><p>My gaze flits over him in an assessing manner. In our family we never shut down a dare. So I reach for the appetizer. I squish my nose in disgust and pop it into my mouth, swallowing it without even chewing. Then I cover my mouth to stop from gagging.</p><p>\u201cHappy?\u201d I wave my hands in the air at me.</p><p>\u201cWhat? Are you going to throw up?\u201d Xander asks, now with concern in his voice.</p><p>I cover my lips again, not really sure if I\u2019m going to, and decide I\u2019d better hurry to the bathroom just in case. \u201cI just remembered. I forgot the Bellinis. I\u2019ll be back.\u201d</p><p>I make it into the bathroom and I\u2019m fine by then. There\u2019s a chair in the corner and I take a seat, pulling out my phone to see if Ben responded. He did.</p><p>Do you forget, I\u2019ve heard the sounds you make when you\u2019ve eaten and they are nothing like what I heard today. Just admit it, you want me.</p><p>I smile hugely and my cheeks prickle when I do. Quickly I text him back.</p><p>That\u2019s a fact I\u2019ve never denied. You just never asked.</p><p>I was being respectful of your \u201cguidelines.\u201d But tell me now, \u201cDo you want me?\u201d</p><p>I\u2019ve always wanted you.</p><p>Fuck me.</p><p>That\u2019s the plan.</p><p>My stomach flutters and I\u2019m feeling pretty proud of myself for my wit. I shove my phone in my pocket and stop to look in the mirror. When I do I\u2019m a little shocked by how red my skin is. I splash some cool water over my face, but my discomfort level is starting to rise. A dab of powder takes away the shine and dulls the color.</p><p>A few hours later, I\u2019m tired but happy watching everyone enjoying themselves. I\u2019m also feeling eager for it to end. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cPerk up,\u201d Tate whispers in my ear.</p><p>The hand he places on my waist starts drifting down to my rear. I jump and turn around with a glare that should remind him where things stand between us. The dilation of his pupils tells me he\u2019s had way too much to drink.</p><p>He lifts his glass. \u201cYou know how to throw a great party.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d I say curtly.</p> <p>He frowns at me. \u201cYou don\u2019t look happy.\u201d</p><p>I step back. \u201cI am . . . about the party.\u201d</p><p>I glance around, trying to avoid his scrutinizing stare. Romeo is dancing extremely close with some woman. Their bodies are rubbing against each other in a way that screams we\u2019re h**ing s*x tonight\u2014I\u2019m not sure whether it\u2019s his fianc\u00e9e, because I\u2019ve never met her, even though this woman does look familiar to me.</p><p>Jagger and Aerie are dancing in the same way, but the sight of them together makes me smile. And River is kissing Dahlia while Garrett stands next to them as if waiting for him to finish. Garrett really needs a girlfriend of his own. I thought he was into Ena, Xander\u2019s assistant, but it seems she\u2019s with Leif. I can\u2019t keep up.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re extremely moody,\u201d Tate says.</p> <p>\u201cMe?\u201d I say, trying not to sound as offended as I am. My grin fades. \u201cI\u2019m not the moody one,\u201d I say in a bold tone I haven\u2019t displayed in a while.</p><p>He clams up.</p><p>\u201cI have a few things to take care of.\u201d</p><p>He grabs my arm before I can walk away. \u201cDance with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho are you seeing?\u201d His short, sharp tone isn\u2019t the normal one I\u2019m used to. This tone is laced with menace.</p> <p>\u201cOh, there you are,\u201d my mother says, oblivious of the scene before her.</p><p>I try to smile at her, to make everything seem all right.</p><p>Her eyes zero in on my face and I know it must be flushed with anger. \u201cYou look like you got too much sun today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I think I did\u2014\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m interrupted by the sound of Xander\u2019s voice in the microphone. \u201cHere she is, everyone\u2014Ivy Taylor,\u201d he announces.</p><p>\u201cCome on, darling, we\u2019re going to miss it,\u201d my mother says, reaching for my hand. I take hers and despite myself I feel guilty I haven\u2019t told her about Ben.</p><p>We press our way over to the stage and listen to a medley of Ivy\u2019s new songs. I close my eyes and sing along, but all the while visions of Ben kissing me, putting his hands on my body, feeling me in the most intimate places are all I can think about. I open my eyes when everyone applauds, smiling when I see the look on Xander\u2019s face. He holds out his arm for Ivy to join him and then does something completely out of character and jumps onstage, swinging Ivy around. I look at my mother and we both have tears in our eyes. She pulls me in for a hug and her slight touch feels like pinpricks against my tender skin.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t cry, Mom.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m trying not to, but seeing him so happy makes me so happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, Mom. I know.\u201d</p><p>She takes a deep breath and whispers, \u201cIt\u2019s what I want for all of my children.\u201d</p><p>I pull away. \u201cI have to go check on Dino and Matt.\u201d</p><p>She nods.</p><p>I spend what\u2019s left of the night talking to the guests and trying to avoid both Tate and Romeo, who have approached me numerous times together and separately. My phone vibrates in my pocket. I pull it out and read the message.</p><p>I should be there in about twenty minutes.</p><p>I text back.</p><p>I can\u2019t wait to see you.</p><p>I can\u2019t wait to do a lot of things.</p><p>My nerves flutter like the butterflies in my stomach, but I don\u2019t have much time to think about them because the music begins and I know it\u2019s time for the engagement announcement. Keeping my mouth shut has been difficult but I managed it. River starts to sing \u201cMarry Me,\u201d the No Doubt version, of course\u2014Xander always said Ivy looked like Gwen Stefani. As River sings, Xander braces his arms around Ivy and they dance. My mother has tears streaming down her face and when they finish she goes to hug them.</p><p>A tinge of jealousy flares within me. River and now Xander\u2014both of my brothers have found their happily ever after. Will I ever find mine? But I push that aside because I couldn\u2019t be happier for my brother. Our family has been through a lot, but I think Xander has been through the most. He deserves this. I notice Jack flash a grin at them and then engulf Ivy in a huge embrace.</p><p>Dino elbows me. \u201cDidn\u2019t you want these?\u201d he asks.</p><p>\u201cYes, oh yes.\u201d For the first time as I thank Dino I think Ben might be right\u2014he\u2019s interested in me. I\u2019m flattered, but it\u2019s almost laughable, as he\u2019s so young.</p><p>I wave my hands toward River and he crosses the room to grab the champagne.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re on fire,\u201d he comments.</p><p>I laugh. \u201cI\u2019m prepared.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, for real. You\u2019re so red. Are you okay?\u201d</p><p>I jab the bottle at him. \u201cI\u2019m fine. Let\u2019s get a move on.\u201d</p><p>Dahlia is at his side, snapping pictures, and I trail behind with the tray of champagne flutes.</p><p>\u201cPssttt,\u201d I say to her.</p><p>She looks over her shoulder.</p><p>\u201cHappy anniversary.\u201d</p><p>She smiles. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>We all circle around Xander and Ivy, and River tugs on the cork and it goes flying. I jump, startled by the noise. Laughter fills the room when he spills a little on the floor and flashes a grin. \u201cI always say I\u2019m not much of a bartender.\u201d</p><p>Xander whispers something to him that I can\u2019t hear. River nods and then the two embrace, pulling me in as well. Now tears well in my eyes. I love them so much.</p><p>River turns back to the crowd and hoists a glass high for a toast. \u201cTo Ivy and Xander. To true love.\u201d</p><p>We all clink our glasses and my tears of joy spill over.</p><p>I make a toast next. \u201cTo Ivy and Xander\u2014if I ever doubted fate you\u2019ve changed that for me. Because of you I believe in fairy tales, butterflies, and destiny.\u201d</p><p>Everyone looks at me questioningly. I shrug with a smile and they all let it go and start sipping their champagne.</p><p>When everyone starts to converse, I whisper in Ivy\u2019s ear, \u201cI have to leave, but I\u2019ll be calling you to plan the wedding.\u201d And with that my heels click the floor as I dash as fast as I can toward the door.</p><p>CHAPTER 17</p><p>Navigate Me</p><p>Ben</p><p>The road between Laguna Beach and LA is once again becoming very familiar territory to me. In my BMW X-5, I head toward the City of Angels. I have a thing for BMWs\u2014always have. I remember my father driving the oldest, ugliest orange BMW when I was a kid. They\u2019re some of the clearest memories I have of him. I\u2019d be sitting in the backseat on the perforated black leather and watching as my father jammed his foot up and down when he tried to unstick the clutch or when he\u2019d pound his fist against the stick next to him because he couldn\u2019t get the gears to shift. We\u2019d almost always roll out of the driveway backward and my dad would yell words my mother would scold him for. I didn\u2019t understand why either of them seemed upset when to me it was nothing but fun. I\u2019d sit in the backseat and laugh at them both.</p><p>Approaching the seemingly infinite lights that twinkle all around me, I find it odd to feel the start of a smile when I look ahead. I\u2019ve always hated LA, but for some reason I don\u2019t see it as pretentious anymore. Instead it reminds me of Bell. The music in the car is low because I don\u2019t need to blast it to ease my thoughts as I careen through the streets. The night seems oddly quiet. But as I coast onto the streets of LA, the quietness fades. The tree-lined streets become lively, but it\u2019s not with cars. Trick-or-treaters fill the sidewalks\u2014pumpkins, ghosts, goblins, and even a few Batman costumes parade door to door. I pass the LA Times building lit up in orange and remember how excited I was to start working there so many years ago. So much has happened since then. But I\u2019ve put the past in the past and I\u2019m moving forward.</p><p>The traffic light turns red and I stop and take the time to reread our texts from earlier. My anticipation of what the night is going to bring only grows by the moment, as does the size of my cock. The light turns green and I drive even faster to get there. Cars are emptying out of the parking lot as I pull in. I had considered attending a million different times, but each scenario ended with putting S\u2019belle in an awkward situation and I didn\u2019t want to stress her out when this was meant to be a happy time for her family.</p><p>Putting my BMW in PARK, I look toward the car in front of me. The license plate reads T WYATT. What the f**k is that ass**le doing here? I swivel my gaze toward the building and I\u2019m caught off guard by the sign before me. Dahlia had told me what she named the company she started with her husband. But hearing about it and seeing the evidence in person are entirely different. Erected to the side of the pathway leading to the building\u2019s glass doors stands a huge rectangular concrete sign with the words TYLER RECORDS AND AMAZING GRACE STUDIOS scripted across it in rose letters.</p><p>This gesture rocks me more than I thought it would. My mother\u2019s name scripted in her favorite color makes everything suddenly seem more real. Maybe I was wrong about not caring if our relationship would be tainted by how it first began? How will my connection to the people inside affect a possible future with S\u2019belle? Would her family ever be able to let the fact go that I cheated on Dahlia with S\u2019belle?</p><p>If it was just about me, I couldn\u2019t give a shit. But I know how important her family is to her. I know she doesn\u2019t think they can accept me and my part in her past and that\u2019s why she hasn\u2019t told them she\u2019s been seeing me. Not sure anymore if I should go down this road with her, I shift my car into DRIVE, but before I can take my foot off the gas, the passenger door opens and S\u2019belle slips inside.</p><p>Her lemony scent immediately assaults me. I breathe deep and glance at her. She\u2019s so f**king sexy wearing a green strapless shorts outfit with metallic flowers on it, and the same wisps of thin gold chains that I untangled from her hair this morning are wrapped around her neck. Her eyes sparkle as she leans toward me and I\u2019m greeted with a breathy \u201cHi.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi there, beautiful,\u201d I say, letting my doubts go as I stare at the girl sitting beside me.</p><p>Her smile widens.</p><p>\u201cDid I mention I can\u2019t wait to strip your clothes off?\u201d</p><p>She leans over toward me and slides her hands up my thighs, and my c**k is just as excited as I am. I clear my throat, knowing we need to get out of the parking lot and back to her place . . . quickly.</p><p>She hovers over me, her hands on my legs. \u201cDid I ever mention I took a striptease class a few years ago?\u201d</p><p>I swallow. \u201cA striptease class?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, it was great exercise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck,\u201d I mutter.</p><p>She sits back in her seat and when she attempts to strap her seat belt on she says, \u201cOuch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d she responds.</p><p>\u201cHow was the party?\u201d</p><p>Something flickers in her gaze. \u201cIt was . . . fun,\u201d she says. \u201cBut it would have been more fun if you were there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t invite me,\u201d I joke.</p><p>She catches me off guard when her hands grab my face. And then her soft lips are on mine for a moment before she speaks. \u201cYou know it\u2019s complicated.\u201d</p><p>I do actually. We did discuss the event; we have yet to discuss just how complicated the situation is. But now is not the time. I grab the back of her neck and pull her even closer to me. When her soft lips meet mine I wonder what the hell I was thinking when I almost left without her. My tongue finds hers and I kiss her with the hunger I seem to feel for her all the time. When we finally break apart and neither of us is able to breathe, I look at her, into her eyes. \u201cDo you know how much I want you?\u201d</p><p>She nods, her eyes glimmering. \u201cAs much as I want you.\u201d She smiles. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I put the car in reverse and catch her gaze. \u201cAre you ready?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore than ready.\u201d Her voice is hoarse but definitely not weak.</p><p>I put my foot on the brake and place my hand on her thigh. She jumps a little when I circle my thumb over her bare skin and after a few minutes she grabs my hand.</p><p>\u201cEverything okay?\u201d I ask, shooting a glance her way as I hop on the freeway.</p> <p>\u201cYes,\u201d she says with forced exaggeration.</p><p>\u201cReally? Because it doesn\u2019t sound that way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d she says, moving our hands over to my leg.</p><p>I exit the freeway and stop at the light. \u201cCome here,\u201d I tell her, and grab her shoulder, pulling her over to me. Again she jumps. I let go of her and take her chin in my hand. \u201cOkay, what\u2019s the matter, Red? Do you not want to do this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, that\u2019s not it at all. It\u2019s just . . .\u201d She pauses.</p> <p>The light turns and I drop my hand. \u201cJust what?\u201d I ask, twisting to see her.</p><p>Her eyes widen like saucers. \u201cYou have to promise not to laugh.\u201d</p><p>I want to promise, I really do, but the face she made makes a memory flash through my mind. The first time we talked in the library at college and she dropped the Kama Sutra book on the floor.</p><p>Her lips purse and her eyes narrow on me. \u201cI just asked you not to laugh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t even told me anything,\u201d I say, holding my stomach to control my own laughter. It\u2019s so strange how she can lift my mood so quickly.</p><p>\u201cI know, so why are you already laughing?\u201d she scoffs.</p> <p>\u201cYou made a face that reminded me of the first time I saw you in the library when you were randomly shuffling through books and you dropped that book on the floor.\u201d</p><p>Her gaze softens. \u201cYou remember that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I do.\u201d</p><p>Pulling up in front of her nicely kept Spanish-style apartment complex, I turn the engine off. Twisting toward her, I run my fingers down the bare skin of her arm and again she jumps. All remnants of laughter dissolve as I turn toward her in the dark of the night. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing really. I just feel a little sunburned.\u201d</p><p>I flick the dome light on in the car. Fuck me, she\u2019s the color of a lobster. \u201cA little! Have you put anything on it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, not yet. Honestly, I didn\u2019t start to feel it until I got to the party.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of sunblock was that you put on?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cActually I didn\u2019t have much sunblock left, so I poured a little moisturizer in the bottle. It said it had SPF in it.\u201d</p><p>I shake my head at her in disbelief. \u201cCome on, let\u2019s go put something cool on it.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m careful to only touch where her clothing is, but even then I see her body tighten in discomfort. She leads me up the stairs and to the door of her apartment that from the outside I know so well. When she opens it and walks through, I catch sight for the first time of where she lives. Candles are scattered all around, a bottle of sparkling water with two glasses sits on her coffee table, and her bikini is thrown on the back of her sofa. I try to ignore the intimate setting that she has set and swivel my gaze over the rest of the room. There isn\u2019t much furniture\u2014the sofa, the coffee table, a television, and a small stereo unit on the floor. I look over toward the kitchen\u2014a few barstools, but no table under the light in the corner. I know she\u2019s lived here for a while, but it looks as if she just moved in.</p><p>\u201cThis is really nice,\u201d I say, closing the door behind me.</p><p>\u201cThanks, I\u2019m not done with it yet, but it\u2019s getting there.\u201d</p><p>I walk up behind her. \u201cIt looks like you were expecting company.\u201d</p><p>She tosses her keys and twists her head back to rest on my shoulder. \u201cWell, someone who wasn\u2019t invited was making a nuisance of himself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs this the way you greet all nuisances who invite themselves over?\u201d I bend down to kiss her lips and rest my hands on her shoulders.</p><p>\u201cOuch,\u201d she exclaims loudly.</p><p>I glance around, looking for a light switch, and flick it on. \u201cTurn around, let me see you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d she says, kicking her heels off.</p><p>I circle over to her and take a look. \u201cYou have blisters on your lips.\u201d</p><p>She slaps her hand to her mouth. \u201cOh my God, did you give me herpes?\u201d</p><p>I should be insulted, but instead I\u2019m laughing so hard a few tears drip from my eyes.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not funny,\u201d she says, running down the hall. \u201cOh God, they\u2019re huge.\u201d</p><p>I walk down the hallway and see her looking in the bathroom mirror. \u201cLet me see.\u201d</p><p>She turns toward me.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t just have a little sunburn, you might have sun poisoning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think so?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo I think I didn\u2019t give you herpes? Yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you didn\u2019t,\u201d she says, rolling her eyes. \u201cI\u2019m talking about sun poisoning.\u201d</p><p>I mimic her and roll my eyes. \u201cYes, I\u2019m pretty sure. I\u2019ve taken care of sun poisoning a few times before. You need to take some aspirin, put some cold compresses over those blisters, and drink a lot of water. So let\u2019s start with where I\u2019ll find the aspirin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have Midol. Will that work?\u201d</p><p>I laugh. \u201cNo, but I\u2019ll run out to the store and pick some up along with some aloe because I\u2019m going to guess you don\u2019t have that either.\u201d</p><p>She shakes her head no and turns back toward the mirror.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t keep touching them,\u201d I yell as I walk into the kitchen and open the refrigerator, looking for a bottle of spring water. It\u2019s completely empty except for a large bag of lemons. I close it and open a few cupboards until I find a glass. I fill it with water and when I turn she\u2019s standing behind me. \u201cDrink this. Get changed and put some cold washcloths over the blisters. I\u2019ll be right back. Okay?\u201d</p><p>She runs her hand down my chest. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>Our eyes lock and I grab her hand and kiss it. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to thank me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry. I was really looking forward to tonight.\u201d</p><p>I kiss the top of her head, the only place I know won\u2019t hurt her. \u201cThere will be other nights.\u201d</p><p>She drinks the water, sets the glass down, and opens the refrigerator, removing a few lemons from the bag. She sniffs them and I pause to watch her. She sets them on the counter, cuts one in half, and squeezes the juice up her arm. I watch her curiously as she repeats this process on the other arm and winces.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d I ask.</p><p>She turns toward me. \u201cCleansing my skin. I usually rub them up my arm, but I think that might sting more than it already does.\u201d</p><p>I bunch my eyebrows.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d she asks. \u201cIt\u2019s common knowledge lemon juice is good for your skin, so it should help with sunburn too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but don\u2019t most people squeeze them into their water?\u201d</p><p>She shrugs. \u201cI\u2019m not like most people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. No, you\u2019re not.\u201d I laugh.</p><p>As I walk out the door now knowing why she always smells of lemon, I\u2019m surprisingly not thinking about how our night has been ruined but rather about how I\u2019m glad I\u2019m here to take care of her.</p><p>The grocery store is quiet at this time of night as I push my cart through the aisles. I\u2019ve decided to pick up a few things since I\u2019m not sure she\u2019ll be going out this weekend. My phone beeps and I slide it out of my pocket. It\u2019s S\u2019belle.</p><p>Did I say thank you?</p><p>You did and I told you you didn\u2019t have to say that, but I think I\u2019ve changed my mind.</p><p>Did I tell you I was really looking forward to tonight?</p><p>You did. Don\u2019t you want to know why I changed my mind?</p><p>Did I tell you I really wanted to have sex with you tonight?</p><p>I nearly drop my phone. Fuck, she must be trying to kill me. I hurry up and pay for my cartload of shit and throw the bags in the car. By the time I get in my phone has beeped again.</p><p>Did you get my last text?</p><p>I did. And I think you\u2019re trying to kill me.</p><p>No, I\u2019m not. And I really do want to know what changed your mind.</p><p>Because whenever you get over this sunburn, I have a few ILLUSTRATED ways in mind that you can say thank you. Do you get my drift?</p><p>I capitalized illustrated so she might pick up my hint. When she doesn\u2019t respond right away, I put the car in DRIVE and head back to her place, assuming she didn\u2019t get it.</p><p>When I get back to her apartment, I pull the chain lock across the door and yell out, \u201cRed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m in my bedroom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I come in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d I can hear her laughing from here.</p><p>Setting the bags on the counter, I glance around again. I see a few personal things but not much, not even pictures.</p><p>\u201cAre you coming?\u201d she calls.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be right there.\u201d I throw the cold things into the fridge and freezer, grab a few water bottles from the pack I bought, the bottle of aspirin, the aloe, and walk down the hall. I know which room is hers immediately because there\u2019s a candle glow from the doorway. Her bedroom is much like the living room\u2014plain with very little in terms of d\u00e9cor. She\u2019s lying on the bed with practically nothing on\u2014as I said, she\u2019s trying to kill me. She\u2019s in a loose-fitting pair of lightweight sleep shorts and a thin-strapped tank top. Both are white. Both see-through.</p><p>\u201cHey, I got some stuff that should make you feel better.\u201d</p><p>She glances up at me and I can tell there\u2019s something bothering her. I take her phone from her clutched hand and when I do it chirps\u2014a text from Tate Wyatt. I set it on the night table. \u201cWyatt? At this time of night?\u201d</p><p>She shrugs. \u201cHe must have a question.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s after hours, so you can contact him tomorrow, right?\u201d</p><p>She stares at me as if contemplating what I just said but doesn\u2019t move to grab her phone.</p><p>\u201cEverything all right?\u201d I ask as I set the things in my hands down on the nightstand.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>When I sit beside her, my stomach jolts. I want to hold her, to kiss her, to f**k her. But when I pull her chin toward me and stare into her eyes, I see tears.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you crying?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m being stupid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just surprised you ever gave me a second thought.\u201d</p><p>I gently kiss her lips and whisper to her, \u201cYou\u2019re the f**king sexiest thing I\u2019ve ever seen. Yes, I gave you a second thought.\u201d Then I add, \u201cMany second thoughts.\u201d</p><p>Silence overtakes us as we both seem to get lost in our memories. When my lips graze hers again, she flinches. I pull back and take the aspirin bottle, pop the cap off, and pour out two. Then I twist the top of the water bottle off and hand her both. She swallows the pills. After I kick my sneakers off, I crawl up next to her so we\u2019re face-to-face. I run my fingers through her strands of red hair and notice the blotchiness on the skin of her shoulders.</p><p>\u201cBell,\u201d I say, caressing her cheek. \u201cI remember the first time I saw you in the library. I remember every single detail about the night we spent together. And if you want to talk about it, I will. But there are some things that I think are better left in the past. I have this need to have you in my life. I don\u2019t understand what it is, but I know I haven\u2019t felt more whole or more alive in a very long time than I have with you these last six weeks.\u201d</p><p>A few stray tears trickle down her face. \u201cYou called me Bell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s your name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know but you\u2019ve never called me that.\u201d</p><p>I shrug and carefully wipe her tears away. I pull myself up on the bed and lean against the headboard. Patting my stomach, I say, \u201cCome here.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She moves over to me.</p><p>I understand where her sadness is coming from. Where we started is complicated, confusing even. I was with Dahl then and there\u2019s nothing I could say to make what we did right, no, what I did, right. I try to calm her by combing my fingers through her hair. I would hold her, hug her, if I could. When her sobbing eases I lean over and kiss her head. After a few long silent minutes I say, \u201cSit up. Let\u2019s put this aloe on you.\u201d</p><p>She slides across the sheets before settling with her back to me and I lean over to whisper softly in her ear, \u201cLift your hair.\u201d</p><p>I take a moment to collect myself, trying to control the impact she\u2019s having on me. She\u2019s barely dressed and it\u2019s hard to control my desire. I open the bottle and rub the cool liquid in my hands. \u201cThis is going to tingle at first, but you\u2019ll feel much better, I promise.\u201d I carefully pat it on her shoulders and just feeling her smooth skin makes me want to do so much more.</p> <p>She screams, \u201cOuch,\u201d and I can hear a sob and with that any sexual thoughts I had disappear. Fuck, I hate this. I don\u2019t want her to cry. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, baby. Almost done.\u201d I pat her shoulders, her back, her chest. She\u2019s beyond sunburned everywhere. When I\u2019m done I stand up. \u201cI\u2019ll be right back.\u201d</p><p>She nods, taking another sip of water.</p><p>I leave the bathroom with a washcloth soaked in cold water. I place it on her forehead and she grabs it. Her fingers touch mine and an electrical current exchanges between us. Emptying my pockets, I lie down next to her and she moves to my chest. She fits perfectly there. She rubs her fingers over the buttons of my shirt and I resist the urge to touch her. I settle for running my fingers through her silky-smooth strands of hair and breathing in her lemon scent.</p><p>Exhaustion hits quickly and just as I start to drift off she softly says, \u201cBen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d I mumble.</p> <p>\u201cYou can call me S\u2019belle.\u201d</p><p>I kiss her head one last time and grin before closing my eyes.</p><p>CHAPTER 18</p><p>Dirty Laundry</p><p>Bell</p><p>A tingle radiates all the way from my head to my toes as a vision of his lean and sinewy muscled body standing behind me on his surfboard with his very erect penis pressing into my back awakens me from my dreamlike sleep and I float back to earth.</p> <p>\u201cHmm . . .\u201d The noise escapes me involuntarily.</p><p>I knew I was a goner yesterday the minute he strode out of the water. There he was\u2014a vision of utter perfection with his tight stomach muscles on display. He has stunned me into silence many times over the past weeks with his charm, the funny things he says, and his utter good looks, but when I saw him on the beach\u2014his lean form, the faint line of hair that disappears into the waistband of his shorts, the dips and ridges of his half-naked body, then when his laugh dipped from his throat, everything just seemed so right. And lying here knowing he shared my bed last night for the first time, I can\u2019t contain my glee.</p><p>Squeezing my eyes shut, I can\u2019t help feeling amazed that the man I dream about is the one I\u2019m waking up next to this morning. But then a sudden fit of anxiety bounces through me. I\u2019m still a little scared. That hasn\u2019t changed. It\u2019s not a frightened kind of scared, though. It\u2019s the same feeling I got when he first looked at me across the room almost a month ago. It was the same way he looked at me the night we were together so long ago and it thrills me, excites me, and scares me at the same time.</p><p>We are different people now than we were when our bodies first collided into a passion that consumed us. Sure, we\u2019ve fooled around twice since, but it wasn\u2019t like that night. I know he wants me in that way again, I can tell, and I want the same thing. But so much has happened\u2014and there are still things that need to happen, truths to be told, for this to mean something. I am afraid it might be too much for him, or maybe too much for me. Yet the past few weeks have shown me that the pull between us is too strong to deny . . . I have to give us a try.</p><p>Deciding to wake up, I let my fingers creep across the sheets, inching their way around so I can feel him. But he\u2019s not anywhere in the bed. Last night we hadn\u2019t had sex, but it was still somehow unforgettable. The way he took care of me, how sweet he was, his concern for how I was feeling. The way my head fit perfectly in the crook of his neck and how I fell asleep in his arms. It all felt so real, so right . . . there was nothing wrong about any of it.</p><p>With the light streaming through the blinds, my eyes slowly blink open. I look around my room for him. My lips curl into a smile when I spot his sneakers on the carpet. As the smile spreads across my lips, my hand flies to my mouth, and although a few small bumps remain, they don\u2019t hurt. Thoughts of my feelings for him bubble back to the surface. I locked them away for a long time, but no matter how hard I tried to forget him I couldn\u2019t let him go.</p><p>I ached for him when I saw him in my brother\u2019s house last year. Having no idea who he was, I felt hope cascading through me. I thought it was finally our time. Memories of how he\u2019d brought me to cl**ax over and over were all I could think of. I\u2019d blocked out everything else. But when I found out he was Dahlia\u2019s Ben, her long-lost fianc\u00e9 thought dead, I was sickened, horrified even that she had been the one whose boyfriend I had taken without regard and I knew the flame he had lit inside me needed to be doused. Thank God Dahlia didn\u2019t hold on to angry feelings. Thank God she couldn\u2019t see inside my head. But she was in love with my brother and nothing else mattered. She was willing to move forward. She accepted what I had done, what Ben and I had done, and I was so very thankful</p><p>Then when I saw him again I wasn\u2019t worried about Dahlia, or River, or even my mother; I was worried about myself. No matter how hard I tried to shut him out I, couldn\u2019t. When I looked in his eyes the past became a blur; the only thing I could see were the memories of how he made me feel. So I let him in. I couldn\u2019t help myself. More than anything I wanted to feel that way again. But this time I knew I needed to proceed with caution. And that\u2019s what I\u2019ve done\u2014until now.</p> <p>I sigh deeply at all the memories. The issues are still there, but this time I feel strong enough to face them, to throw caution to the wind and accept the consequences. I twist my back and stretch my neck, happy to be feeling only a fraction of the pain I felt yesterday, and a huge grin crosses my lips. It\u2019s Saturday and I have no plans. Hopefully Ben and I can spend the day together\u2014alone. I\u2019m particularly thankful right now that I told Tate I couldn\u2019t work today. I knew after Ivy\u2019s event I\u2019d be wiped. He was upset, but the event he had planned for today wasn\u2019t mine; it was his. He just wanted me there.</p><p>It was time for me to start pulling back on assisting him with events so I could spend more time on my own planning. Part of me wishes I could just leave, but I\u2019m not ready to quit, although I\u2019m not sure how much longer I can take it. He\u2019s becoming more and more demanding of my time, and his advances toward me since our breakup last winter aren\u2019t letting up.</p><p>Sliding my feet to the floor, I spot Ben\u2019s keys and wallet on my nightstand. And then I start second-guessing myself, wondering if moving forward with him right now is what I should be doing. My goal for this year was to focus on myself. Get my life on track. It didn\u2019t include a relationship\u2014that wasn\u2019t in my plans. But everything about him seems so right this time. And even the repercussions don\u2019t seem overwhelming. Sure, my family\u2019s issues will be abundant. But Dahlia has accepted Ben in her life and I\u2019m sure she can help me with River. Xander will be an ass, but I can handle him. The biggest issue of all will be my mother. But once I explain to her what Ben said last night, that he wanted to leave the past in the past, I know she\u2019ll understand.</p><p>Looking down at the clover I\u2019ve worn for the past six years, I can\u2019t help thinking . . . why tell him? What\u2019s done is done; there\u2019s no undoing it.</p><p>My nose starts to twitch, tearing me from all my thoughts as I catch the faint smell of sizzling bacon in the air. I sniff again, thinking about my empty refrigerator. Ambling out of bed, I make a quick stop in the bathroom before I patter down the hall in search of him and the delicious smell. My heart leaps at the sight in the kitchen\u2014Ben, messy blond hair, muscled, skin tanned, barefoot, standing at my stove in front of a frying pan. With a fluttering stomach, I lick my lips wanting to just taste him. He looks nothing short of edible in his white shirt and faded jeans that hug him just right. His pants are hung low, frayed at the hem just like his shirt. He is the sexiest man I\u2019ve ever seen. He has always been.</p><p>I watch as he flips the slices before him and remember the last time we spent the night together\u2014and how it ended. I blink that sad thought away. And again needing to make sure this is real\u2014I step closer.</p><p>\u201cS\u2019belle, you\u2019re awake.\u201d He grins while dropping a piece of bacon onto a plate.</p><p>My pulse races. Those two syllables that I\u2019ve longed to hear from his lips for so long and suddenly any doubts I had are gone\u2014I know I\u2019m ready to take this leap with him. I lean against the kitchen doorway and I smile. \u201cGood morning. You went shopping?\u201d</p><p>He laughs. \u201cI picked a few things up while I was at the store last night. I noticed you were a little on the empty side.\u201d He points to the fridge.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I haven\u2019t gotten the living on my own thing down yet,\u201d I respond, but really I have; I just hate it.</p><p>\u201cAre you hungry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStarving,\u201d I answer. My voice is low and seductive.</p><p>He turns. \u201cGood. It\u2019s almost done. How\u2019s the sunburn?\u201d he asks, sweeping the length of me with his eyes as he cracks an egg into a bowl.</p><p>I raise my arms in a catlike stretch, making sure to pull my hair up off my shoulders so it tumbles down when I let it go. Then I run my hands down my body.</p><p>His eyes flicker over me.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s much, much better,\u201d I purr.</p><p>\u201cFuck,\u201d he mutters.</p><p>I nod and smile, slow and sweet.</p><p>The most devilish grin forms on his lips and he quickly tosses the eggshell into the sink. Then he turns the stove off and transfers the pan to the burner beside it.</p><p>\u201cCome here,\u201d he demands, then adds, \u201cNow.\u201d</p><p>Not only do his words and his smile send tingles to every nerve in my body, but the sound of his voice and the anticipation of what\u2019s to come make me quiver with need. I saunter into the kitchen in my best attempt to be as seductive as he is. And it works, because in a heartbeat he grabs me and pushes me up against the counter. His hands cup the back of my neck and he pulls me to him. Heat and his hardness assault me immediately. Just the feel of his lips on mine sweeps me away\u2014lust and need the only things I can think about, the only things left in the room. I fall into his kiss, whimpering at the way his tongue presses against mine, the way it searches my mouth, demanding all of me. The kiss is warm, deep, and desire floods me in a mad rush.</p><p>Leaving me breathless, he pulls back and studies my face. His fingers move to gently stroke my shoulders beneath the straps of my tank top. \u201cDoes this hurt?\u201d He dips his head to kiss my shoulder.</p><p>I shake my head no because I can\u2019t speak. The feel of his skin on mine causes my breath to catch in my throat and I\u2019m rendered speechless.</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d He peppers light, soft kisses up my neck and back down.</p><p>I toss my head back.</p><p>He pushes my straps farther down and his dips even lower.</p><p>\u201cThis?\u201d he asks as his lips touch my nipple and circle it while his hand cups the other one.</p><p>\u201cN . . . n . . . no,\u201d I stammer.</p><p>He licks and sucks one nipple while he rolls the other between his thumb and finger.</p><p>I press my h*ps forward. \u201cOh God, Ben.\u201d</p><p>I can feel his lips tilt up into a smile. He looks up at me from underneath his lashes. \u201cYou like that?\u201d</p><p>I feel my legs start to tremble from just the look he\u2019s giving me.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t hear you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou know I do,\u201d I pant.</p><p>Both of us are breathing loudly and I\u2019m not sure whose breath is whose anymore. His grin grows wide as he drags his hot mouth up my chest to my jaw. He nips my lower lip with his teeth and presses his very erect penis against me. I whimper at the contact.</p><p>\u201cYou want this.\u201d His voice is husky.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I say more quickly and more clearly than I have answered any of his questions since coming into the kitchen.</p> <p>He groans, almost roars in response. In a beat he lifts me and sets me on the counter. His palms press down on either side of me and I feel his closeness even with the small distance between us.</p><p>I stare at him, drinking in the sight\u2014hooded lids, parted lips, chest rising and falling.</p><p>His deep blue eyes sweep me. \u201cYou know I think you\u2019re hot as f**k.\u201d</p><p>I love his dirty mouth and his commanding tone. His forcefulness turns me on so much. I\u2019ve never been with a guy like him. Something about him makes me want to give myself over to him in any way he wants. I want to be anything he desires, everything he needs\u2014I want to be his dream girl.</p><p>I lean forward and begin to undo his buttons. \u201cI think the same thing about you. Yesterday after I left the beach, all I could think about was your c**k inside me. I might have had at least three mini orgasms at the thought.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFuck,\u201d he mutters, biting down on his lip. His hands slide to my br**sts and he cups both of them. Feeling almost dizzy, I press myself into his palms and drop my hands from his shirt, letting the sensation of his touch slide through me. My ni**les pebble into hard peaks as he squeezes them and I can\u2019t help moaning even louder.</p><p>He pushes the spaghetti straps of my tank farther down my arms to uncover my handful-sized br**sts. His breath hitches as his mouth dips to mine. \u201cDid you wear this to drive me crazy last night?\u201d</p><p>I shake my head and try to catch his lips with mine, but he maintains a slight distance between us.</p><p>\u201cAnd without a bra to kill me.\u201d This time it\u2019s not a question.</p><p>But I shake my head no again.</p><p>His hands move up my thighs and his fingertips dance under the flimsy cotton of my bottoms. \u201cFuck me, you\u2019re not wearing any underwear.\u201d</p> <p>Again I try to press my lips to his, but he keeps drawing back. He lets his fingers only lightly graze over me and I brace my palms on the counter to keep steady. When he presses them a little harder I moan, but he pulls his hands away. He covers them over mine, lightly caressing his thumbs across my skin. \u201cTell me and I\u2019ll put my fingers inside your sweet pu**y.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m tingling everywhere as I mumble, \u201cNo, I didn\u2019t, I promise. I was trying to keep anything from touching my sunburn and besides, if I wanted to drive you crazy I would have worn that.\u201d I lift my hand from underneath his and point to the skimpy swimsuit I laid out perfectly yesterday before I left for Ivy\u2019s release party.</p><p>The wickedest grin crosses his lips. \u201cPut it on now.\u201d</p><p>I bite my lip. \u201cWhatever you say, Mr. Covington.\u201d</p><p>He catches my mouth with his and finally kisses me again. I rub my n*ked chest against his and I think he might be panting. I clutch his shoulders under his shirt and scoot off the counter. He presses his fingers into my h*ps and guides me down.</p><p>I saunter across the room, pick up the suit, and hold it in front of me. \u201cIs this what you want to see me in?\u201d</p><p>He bobs his chin, but his smoldering eyes stay locked on mine.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be right back,\u201d I say, sashaying toward the bathroom.</p> <p>\u201cNo, don\u2019t leave the room. Show me a little of that striptease you said you learned.\u201d</p><p>I shrug as if it\u2019s no big deal, but really I want to be as sexy for him as I can be, and the thrill of being able to give him what he wants makes my stomach flip. I pull the straps of my tank top back up and turn around. Just as I glance over my shoulder and start to slowly lower the straps back down, his eyes shift from ocean blue into midnight sky before me.</p><p>\u201cBut just know I\u2019m f**king you in your bed\u2014all day,\u201d he growls.</p><p>A sudden throbbing expands from my heart to my fingertips to my core but just as suddenly dissipates when there\u2019s a knock at my door and I hear the jangling of my mother\u2019s keys and very familiar voice.</p><p>\u201cBell, honey, are you up? Jack and I went to the market this morning and brought you a few things,\u201d she says as she tries to open the front door, but the chain prevents her.</p><p>\u201cFuck, not how I want to meet your parents,\u201d Ben mutters under his breath.</p><p>I quickly pull my top back down. Ben is fast too, moving to redo the buttons I just moments ago undid. Patting my hair and taking a deep breath, I walk toward the door and unhook the chain.</p><p>With bags blocking their view, my mother and stepfather come in.</p><p>\u201cSo glad you\u2019re finally using that lock I installed,\u201d Jack says.</p><p>I smile. Ben must have used it last night. Honestly, I always forget.</p><p>\u201cOh, good, you\u2019re already up. I thought we\u2019d have breakfast together. You left so fast last night I didn\u2019t get a chance to ask about your day at the beach,\u201d my mother says.</p><p>\u201cAnd, missy, how did you get home anyway? Xander told us you\u2019d left. I was worried about you,\u201d Jack scolds.</p><p>\u201cOh, Jack, a girl is allowed some secrets.\u201d My mother winks at him.</p><p>He shrugs. \u201cCharlotte, you know I can\u2019t help it. I worry about her on her own.\u201d</p><p>My mother dismisses his comment, but I know she worries about me too. \u201cIt smells like you\u2019re already cooking breakfast,\u201d she says.</p><p>As they move toward the kitchen I know I have to say something. \u201cActually Ben is making breakfast.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBen?\u201d my mother questions.</p><p>\u201cYes, Ben Covington. He stopped by to check on me.\u201d</p><p>My mother\u2019s face drops and she stands frozen just looking into the kitchen.</p><p>Jack sets his bags on the counter, grabbing my mother\u2019s from her and doing the same. Ben moves toward them and extending his hand first to my mother, he says, \u201cMrs. Tyler, it\u2019s a pleasure to finally meet you. Bell has told me so much about you.\u201d</p><p>Surprise and shock seem to swamp her, but she eventually smiles and extends her hand.</p><p>Ben turns to Jack and does the same. Jack is more cordial. When he extends his hand he says, \u201cBen, I heard the announcement this morning. Congratulations on the acquisition of Sound Music. I hear you have some terrific ideas for how to boost the publication. I\u2019d love to hear about them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do, sir. And I\u2019d be happy to share them anytime.\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t decide whether I want to hide underneath the sofa or jump on top of it in celebration at the effort Ben is making.</p><p>My mother clears her throat as she turns to me. Her eyes scan my flimsy attire that is not at all appropriate for visitors. \u201cYou said Ben was checking on you. What\u2019s the matter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI took her to the beach yesterday and was worried she might have gotten too much sun,\u201d he rushes to answer.</p><p>\u201cOh, you\u2019re the friend who was teaching Bell how to surf?\u201d Jack asks.</p><p>Ben\u2019s hands go to his pockets and he nods with a smile.</p><p>I\u2019ve kept my mother and Jack in the loop on my \u201cdates\u201d with Ben. I just failed to mention his name. And now I wonder if that was worse than not telling them. I\u2019d painted a picture of a proper suitor pursuing me, and he was one and he did pursue me. They just didn\u2019t know the guy was Ben Covington. But they were both really happy for me that I was finally spending time with someone I liked. So why should it matter who it is?</p><p>Jack even mentioned that since I called my new suitor a friend and not my boyfriend, it must be serious. And I was planning on telling them as soon as I knew for sure Ben wanted more than just sex from me, so that should count for something. Not that I\u2019d tell my parents that.</p><p>My mother\u2019s eyes dart to me again. \u201cOh my, you are really burnt. You looked pink last night, but today it\u2019s much worse. Did you put something on it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Ben brought over some aloe,\u201d I answer, rushing toward the bags that Jack set on the counter.</p><p>\u201cOh, let me,\u201d my mother answers as I start unloading the items.</p><p>\u201cBell, I should run. I have some calls to make at the office,\u201d Ben says, and I notice the use of my real name. I don\u2019t like it.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t realize you had to work today. It\u2019s Saturday.\u201d I know I\u2019m frowning but I can\u2019t help myself. He\u2019s trying to ease out of an awkward situation, but I really don\u2019t want him to go.</p><p>\u201cWith the announcement I really should head in and return a few calls,\u201d he says. \u201cMr. and Mrs. Tyler, it was a pleasure to meet you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCall me Jack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, and I\u2019m Charlotte of course,\u201d my mother adds, rounding the counter and making her way into the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cWhat about breakfast?\u201d I ask, hoping he\u2019ll stay.</p><p>\u201cI made it for you,\u201d he says.</p><p>I stop unloading the goods from the bags that my mother has already started to put away and follow him to the door. My mother and Jack begin their own conversation and Ben points to his feet. Crap, crap, crap.</p><p>\u201cLet me get you those books you asked to borrow before you leave.\u201d I don\u2019t know what else to say. Honestly I don\u2019t care if you\u2019re sixteen or twenty-six; getting caught by your mother with a boy in your room is just plain embarrassing.</p><p>Ben covers his mouth with his fingers in a move I\u2019ve come to love but right now hate. I know he does it when he\u2019s trying not to laugh. I scowl at him and he pats his pockets. I get it\u2014don\u2019t forget his keys and wallet. I make the walk of shame to my room as my mother and Jack act as if they don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on. Entering my room with a deep sigh, I gather everything. I come back with a brown-handled shopping bag, knowing my mother and stepfather must have noticed Ben didn\u2019t have his shoes on. I hand him the bag filled with his stuff and some random romance novels I grabbed off my floor. When our hands connect he brushes his thumb across the top of mine. Electricity shoots through me and I finally smile at him.</p><p>He opens the door and once again says good-bye to my mother and Jack.</p><p>\u201cBye, thanks for stopping by to check on me.\u201d</p><p>A devilish grin crosses his lips. \u201cAnytime. Call me later if you need anything,\u201d he replies with a wink.</p><p>When he leaves I collapse against the door. My body is taut with tension but also tingling at the same time.</p><p>\u201cBell, I think we should have a talk.\u201d My mother\u2019s voice is stern, but soft. And I hope to God she doesn\u2019t want to give me the sex talk again. She gave it to me when I was sixteen and again after I told her I was pregnant. I think I get it.</p><p>Jack busies himself putting the fruit in Tupperware containers my mother also brought over. Even though he isn\u2019t my father, he has always treated me like a daughter. His love and concern have meant a lot to me, but he also knows when to keep quiet\u2014like now.</p><p>Standing straight, I slowly make my way to the kitchen. \u201cMom, I\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t tell you I was seeing him. I just didn\u2019t want you to judge him.\u201d</p><p>My mother stops what she\u2019s doing. \u201cBell, I would never judge him. I just don\u2019t want you to get hurt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you are judging him. I can tell by the look on your face.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCharlotte, he seems like a nice boy. Respectful, concerned about Bell,\u201d Jack says, and my mouth drops. I wouldn\u2019t have counted on him as an ally.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not judging him.\u201d The tone of her voice rises. She glances at me. \u201cI am not one to judge anyone. What happened years ago when he was with Dahlia is for you and him and your brother to come to terms with, and I\u2019m sure you know that isn\u2019t going to be easy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBen and Dahlia have talked. They\u2019ve made peace.\u201d</p><p>She raises her hand. \u201cLike I said, that is between the four of you. My concern right now is only for you. Have you told him about the baby?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I shake my head no.</p><p>She levels with me. \u201cSecrets become lies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not you,\u201d I snap back.</p><p>She ignores me and I know I shouldn\u2019t have said that.</p> <p>\u201cBell, honey, not telling him isn\u2019t any way to start a relationship. You can\u2019t keep a secret like that. It\u2019s not fair to him. Everyone in our family knows. You know I think you should have told him years ago, but since he wouldn\u2019t return your calls I let you make the decision not to.\u201d</p><p>I tremble at the painful memory.</p><p>She reaches across the counter to grab my hand. \u201cI just don\u2019t want you to get hurt.\u201d</p><p>Tears spill from my eyes. \u201cBut, Mom, I\u2019m hurting now. Every time you bring it up, it hurts me. Don\u2019t you get it? I want to forget it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, honey, but you can\u2019t and I can\u2019t let you\u2014not this time.\u201d</p> <p>I run to my room crying and throw myself on the bed. My hand goes to my belly button, then to my scar, and the memory comes back as if it were yesterday.</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>There were no breathing exercises, no Lamaze classes. It was nothing like Rachel giving birth on Friends. I had been diagnosed with preeclampsia and was being monitored closely. Corticosteroid shots were part of my daily regimen to help mature the baby\u2019s lungs. Magnesium sulfate also became part of the ritual to help prevent seizures, but that drug wasn\u2019t an easy shot; it was given in IV form and I hated it. I was warned that when delivery time came the magnesium sulfate dosage might need to be increased. I didn\u2019t understand what that meant, but the nurses looked as though they felt sorry for me.</p><p>On March seventeenth, almost eight months after the baby had been conceived, I understood why. My already high blood pressure had risen to an unhealthy level, putting the baby\u2019s life in danger. The doctors had decided it was time to induce me. So with Pitocin in one IV and mag in another, I was in pain, burning up, and dry-heaving in a basin my mother held for me. Her tears only made me cry all the more. The contractions came on quickly. They were nothing like what I thought they would be. They were the worst kind of cramps and so painful I was screaming before I was even close to being fully dilated. I had opted to remain drug free, but the pain was so bad I begged the nurses to call an anesthesiologist. The fear of a needle stuck in my back seemed so small compared to what I was feeling.</p><p>However, before relief could even arrive, I was being wheeled down a sterile hall with the words emergency C-section being thrown at me. My blood pressure had reached an alarming level and the doctors could no longer wait for the birth-inducing drug to kick in. My mother wasn\u2019t allowed in and I was terrified. With fear and pain all I could fathom, a mask went over my face and as I counted backward, blackness came. I awoke sometime later in the recovery room. I patted my stomach but couldn\u2019t feel anything. I looked around for my mother, my brothers, but sleep called to me. The next time I woke up I was in a different hospital room. It wasn\u2019t the same one I had been recovering in since the accident. The one I had to stay in even after the trauma had passed while we waited for the baby to come.</p><p>I remember the nurse asking, \u201cDo you want to see the baby?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d I cried out.</p><p>I had told them I didn\u2019t. All I could think about was why were they asking me? The adoption was already arranged\u2014I had selected the people I thought would make the most perfect parents, but having my baby taken from me before I expected left me empty, wondering. I started to second-guess myself. I became hysterical and screamed for my mother. The nurses brought her to me.</p><p>\u201cIs the baby okay?\u201d I asked.</p><p>She cried, nodding.</p><p>\u201cDid you hold it?\u201d</p><p>She cried even harder, nodding again.</p><p>Once I knew the baby was safe, my doubts were no more. I couldn\u2019t hold the baby, because if I did I just knew I\u2019d never be able to give it up. So on that day I signed my child over to its new parents, never seeing it, never knowing if it was a boy or girl because it didn\u2019t matter. All I knew, all that mattered was that my child would be raised by two people who would forever love him or her. What I didn\u2019t know is I would never stop loving that child either.</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p> <p>A familiar comforting hand runs up and down my back and I twist around, wiping my tears away.</p><p>\u201cBell, you know how much I love you. I want more than anything for you to be happy. And if you think this man will make you happy, I will accept him with open arms. But you have to be honest with him. I\u2019ve been through a lot in my life and learned from my mistakes. I never told your brother who his real father was and I could have lost him because of that. I\u2019m not trying to hurt you. I know thinking about the baby is painful, but please think about what I\u2019ve said. I won\u2019t bring it up again. How you move forward is your decision.\u201d</p><p>With the memories so vivid and painful, I sit up and pull my mother to me. Eventually my cries muffle into familiar sobs as everything I\u2019ve tried so hard to forget circles around me.</p><p>CHAPTER 19</p><p>Pain</p><p>Ben</p><p>The beach is quiet as I sit outside on the deck and sip a cup of coffee. After I left S\u2019belle\u2019s house I decided to come home and change quickly and then head into the office before going back to get her.</p><p>I can\u2019t help thinking about her while I scan the ocean view. She\u2019s just so f**king sexy all I have to do is glance at her and I\u2019m hard. Everything about her captures my attention\u2014from her cute quirky personality to the sex kitten underneath it. I\u2019m so hot for her I can hardly stand it. The strange thing is our day at the beach was so much fun and last night, although not what I planned, was still memorable. And I actually think that running into her mother and stepfather this morning didn\u2019t turn out to be so bad. She\u2019s been so determined not to tell her family that maybe this was the best way for them to find out about us.</p><p>Heading inside, I rinse my cup and walk into my bedroom. My dirty clothes are in a pile on the floor and I stop while picking them up to look at the picture on my dresser\u2014my mother, my sister, Trent, and me just before my mother died. It\u2019s hard to believe she\u2019s been gone a year. I pull my phone from my pocket with an urge to talk to my sister.</p><p>\u201cHello,\u201d she answers sleepily.</p><p>\u201cHi, it\u2019s me. Did I wake you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay. I have to get up anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen did you get back?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLate last night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow was Hawaii?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Ben, it was beautiful, fun, and amazing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, how does it feel to be a married woman again?\u201d</p><p>She sighs happily and I can feel her smile through the phone. \u201cThe same but different.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s always so matter-of-fact.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you come by for dinner tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t. I have plans,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cOh yeah, what kind of plans?\u201d she asks curiously.</p><p>\u201cHow about lunch tomorrow and I\u2019ll catch you up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat scares me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t gone that long and I talked to you a number of times. So the fact that I am unaware of something and need to be caught up kind of scares me.\u201d</p><p>I chuckle. \u201cI\u2019ll call you tomorrow morning. I gotta run into the office now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, Ben, love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLove you too.\u201d I hang up and can\u2019t help wondering how she\u2019s going to react to hearing the news.</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>Typing a response to one of the dozens of e-mails in my in-box, I click SEND and close it down. My crystal typewriter award is sitting on my desk and the way the sunlight hits it creates a mock rainbow around it that mesmerizes me. But no matter how hard I try, I can\u2019t keep my glance from shifting to the screen of my phone for the umpteenth time. S\u2019belle hasn\u2019t contacted me yet and it\u2019s killing me. It\u2019s been more than six hours\u2014I ran home and showered, came here expecting to stop in for only a few short minutes, and hours later I\u2019m still here.</p><p>\u201cHey, man, you\u2019re here,\u201d Beck says from the doorway just as I pick up my phone to call S\u2019belle.</p><p>\u201cTechnically I\u2019m not.\u201d I shove away from my desk.</p><p>\u201cYeah, right. Well, anyway, I want to show you this. I came up with it yesterday but couldn\u2019t get it quite right until this morning.\u201d</p><p>He sits down with his laptop in front of him at the conference table in the corner of my office.</p><p>I join him. \u201cOkay, show me what you\u2019ve got.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe prepared for your world to be rocked,\u201d he gloats.</p><p>I shake my head, thinking how much my world has already been rocked and how right now I\u2019m tipping over the edge waiting to talk to her. As Beck walks me through a very detailed and complete design of how he plans to simultaneously launch all of Plan B\u2019s holding into the social media arena, I sit back in awe, genuinely impressed by not only his skills, but his visionary talent. But when my phone chirps from across the room, my attention wanes.</p><p>\u201cHot date?\u201d Beck asks as he catches my gaze drift to my desk.</p><p>\u201cI hope so.\u201d I grin. \u201cGive me a minute.\u201d I cross the room to grab my cell.</p><p>\u201cNo worries, mate, it\u2019s not like it\u2019s a Saturday and I am working or anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been spending too much time with Alexander. Only difference is you sound like a douche bag using the word mate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck off, at least I\u2019m not a pansy ass who can\u2019t go after what he wants.\u201d</p><p>I sit back in my chair. \u201cAh . . . that\u2019s where you\u2019re wrong. I have been going after what I want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGlad to hear it. All right, then I\u2019ll leave you to it. I\u2019m heading out, working a shift at my old man\u2019s tonight. Need anything before I go?\u201d Beck asks.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd, Ben,\u201d he says.</p><p>I look over at him.</p><p>\u201cIf I were you I wouldn\u2019t take too much longer. She\u2019s liable to move on to a douche bag like me who never would have taken six weeks to close a deal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks for the advice, mate.\u201d</p><p>He throws me the finger.</p><p>\u201cClose the door.\u201d</p><p>He laughs and walks away, leaving it open. Fucker. I read the message from S\u2019belle.</p><p>Can you meet me at Pebbles?</p><p>I can pick you up and take you out to dinner.</p><p>I\u2019d rather meet you there.</p><p>Okay, but I\u2019m pretty sure we broke through that wall yesterday. What\u2019s going on?</p><p>Can you just meet me there?</p><p>You\u2019re not f**king with me, are you? 50 First Dates is not what I have in mind for tonight.</p><p>Please.</p><p>Sure, when?</p><p>Two hours?</p><p>See you then. And, S\u2019belle, I can\u2019t wait.</p><p>I want to f**k with her some more, but something doesn\u2019t seem right. Her text messages are too straightforward, too direct, so I stop. After I read through a few more work e-mails and forward some of them on to Aerie for her to follow up on, my attention level is close to nil and I decide to call it a day.</p><p>Once I open the glass doors, the cool, crisp breeze assaults me. The air is much cooler than yesterday. Fall is definitely here. With plenty of time to spare, I zip up my jacket and decide to cruise up to Mulholland Drive. Having switched to my bike when I went home, I take the winding roads at a speed I\u2019ve come to love. It looks so different up here during the day but equally as breathtaking as when the sun falls off the cliffs and into the ocean at sunset.</p><p>Stopping at my favorite overlook, I take the time to get off my bike and climb the two flights of wooden stairs to the top. From up here I have to admit glancing around downtown Los Angeles during the day is a sight. It\u2019s one huge conglomerate. Tall buildings, freeways that sprawl for miles, homes, trees\u2014it\u2019s a view one could get used to. But I\u2019ve lived there and good and evil lie hand in hand\u2014although I suppose that might be true of anywhere. Shaking away the thought, I stride back down to my bike and head into the city. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The parking garage is empty, but the streets are full. I make a quick stop in Fiction Vixen for a purchase and then head to my destination. I\u2019m one of the first patrons to arrive at the restaurant, so getting the same table as our first date is easy enough. I set my package on it and order two sparkling waters, with lemon. The thought of her squeezing the juice over her arms last night makes me laugh to myself. Moments later the door opens and there stands the hottest little number\u2014her red hair tumbles in waves around her shoulders, her short green dress is anything but modest, her gold necklaces drape her neck, and she looks sexier than hell. Fuck me. I have no doubt now she\u2019s trying to kill by asking me to meet her in public\u2014yet again.</p><p>Trying to vanish my shit-eating grin, I rise from the table and stride over to greet her, but some older guy has his hands around her before I even make it over to the door. With the giant\u2019s arms still enveloping her tiny body, I clear my throat. She breaks free of his hold and with a glint in her eyes she looks at me.</p><p>\u201cBen, this is Pebbles. Well, really his name is Rocko and he owns the place,\u201d she says with an upward tilt of her lips.</p><p>I begrudgingly extend my arm. \u201cNice to meet you.\u201d</p> <p>He nods. \u201cSame here. Heard a lot about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally, don\u2019t believe it all.\u201d I grin.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all good, man,\u201d he says as if I need the assurance.</p><p>Dropping my eyes to S\u2019belle, I bend my elbow toward her. \u201cShall we?\u201d</p><p>She gives a little wave to Pebbles or Rocko or whatever he goes by and then wraps her arm through mine with the most effervescent smile.</p> <p>\u201cWho is he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA friend,\u201d she answers.</p><p>\u201cYou know I\u2019m jealous as f**k, don\u2019t you?\u201d I growl in her ear.</p><p>She tilts her head and lifts her hand to my face. Cupping my jaw, she whispers, \u201cYou have no reason to be.\u201d</p><p>Heat surges between us before I even pull her chair out and I wonder why she insisted on meeting at a restaurant. As she sits, I lean forward and brush my mouth over hers. A slight tremble rocks her shoulders. \u201cS\u2019belle, what are we doing here? I thought the next time I saw you you\u2019d be in that bikini sprawled out on your bed.\u201d</p><p>She tosses her head from side to side as if trying to break free of the vision I just created. \u201cI need to tell you something and wasn\u2019t sure how or where to do it. This place just seemed right.\u201d</p> <p>She sets her napkin on her lap and immediately starts nervously clicking her fingernails against the tabletop.</p><p>I take a seat and grab her hand. \u201cOkay. We\u2019re here now, so tell me, let\u2019s eat, and then I want to take you home and f**k you.\u201d</p><p>She swallows and I notice her hands trembling.</p><p>\u201cMaybe that was a bit crass. Let me try again. Okay. We\u2019re here now, so tell me.\u201d</p><p>She grabs for the water in front of her and drinks it down, all of it. Her eyes lift to mine. \u201cI\u2019m not sure how to tell you this.\u201d</p><p>I can feel confusion wrinkling my brow.</p><p>Her gaze falls. \u201cBut I know I have to. I have a confession to make. Something from a long time ago. And I\u2019m not sure how you\u2019re going to react.\u201d</p><p>My fingers creep up her arm to her chin.</p> <p>She leans into my touch and her face looks almost pained.</p><p>\u201cI already know what you\u2019re going to tell me.\u201d I try not to laugh as I reach for the wrapped brown package I set on the table.</p><p>She stares at it.</p><p>\u201cSince you lent me some of your books, I thought it was only fair I return the favor. Although I\u2019m not sure reading Fifty Shades of Grey is my thing,\u201d I chuckle.</p><p>Her eyes widen like saucers as I hand her the package. She takes it with trembling fingers.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s safe, I promise. You can open it. I\u2019m cool with your half-truth.\u201d</p><p>The waitress approaches our table and refills both our sparkling waters. \u201cAre you ready to order?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwo peppered beef skewers with rice,\u201d I tell her, and turn my attention back to S\u2019belle. \u201cSo, go ahead, open it.\u201d</p><p>Tearing open the wrap, she stares at the first book, Everything You Ever Need to Know About the French Riviera. Her eyes dart to mine.</p><p>\u201cI know you never went there.\u201d</p><p>She sits motionless.</p><p>\u201cThat first night we were together, when you told me all about what it was like on the French Riviera, I knew you\u2019d never been there as soon as you said you went.\u201d</p><p>She scrunches her eyebrows and purses her lips.</p><p>\u201cIt was written all over your face.\u201d</p><p>Tears fill her eyes as she sets the stack on the table. \u201cYou\u2019re right, I never went to the Riviera.\u201d</p><p>Feeling like a real ass**le, I pull her to me. \u201cCome here. I\u2019m only playing with you. And I got you some other books as well.\u201d</p><p>She sits on my lap and buries her head in my neck, not even looking at the other titles. Her lemon scent assaults me and her mess of wild hair brushes across my skin. I breathe her in. \u201cDon\u2019t cry about it. It\u2019s nothing to cry over. I think it\u2019s funny.\u201d</p><p>She buries her head farther in my neck. \u201cI\u2019m not crying about that. But I can\u2019t believe you knew the whole time. You should have said something and not let me go on and on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut that wouldn\u2019t have been nearly as much fun.\u201d</p><p>She gives a faint smile and wipes her tears, but then she stands up and goes back to sit in her chair. She takes another gulp of her water and then looks at me.</p><p>I soften my voice. \u201cPlease tell me.\u201d</p><p>She nods. \u201cDo you remember yesterday when you asked me what the shamrock I wear is for?\u201d</p><p>My mind recalls vividly the green emerald in her belly button and the thoughts I had about running my tongue around it. With a devilish grin I answer, \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>She sets her glass down. Her hands are shaking and she\u2019s unable to speak.</p><p>I suddenly lose any sense of fun in this conversation. \u201cHey, look at me,\u201d I say, leaning over the table and taking both her hands.</p><p>Her eyes cut to mine, the fire now dulled and consumed by sadness.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it? Just tell me.\u201d</p><p>She stays silent and draws in a breath as if gaining courage.</p><p>\u201cS\u2019belle? What the f**k is it?\u201d My impatience is getting the better of me.</p><p>Her stare searches the table. \u201cThe shamrock represents St. Patrick\u2019s Day.\u201d</p><p>I nod, agreeing with her that it does.</p><p>Silence falls again for another few short moments and then she looks up at me. \u201cThat\u2019s the day I gave birth to our child.\u201d Her voice is shaky and broken. Her words come out in alternating whispers and squeaks.</p><p>The floor drops from beneath me. My ears ring and the room doesn\u2019t seem quite so square anymore. I take a deep breath, replaying what she just said in my head, but it doesn\u2019t make sense. I sit there motionless. I couldn\u2019t have heard her correctly. When my senses recover, I flash her a look that seeks answers.</p><p>Through gritted teeth I ask, \u201cWhat did you say?\u201d</p><p>She squeezes my hands, but I jerk them away. Unbearable silence passes between us, and nothing except the overhead music of Frank Sinatra crooning a love song can be heard. There\u2019s a look of desperation on her face, but there is no way I can help her.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you just say?\u201d My voice takes on an aggressive tone I\u2019ve never used with her as her words register in my brain\u2014I have a child out in the world.</p><p>Tears now slide down her face. She leans forward and through sobs says, \u201cOn March seventeenth, almost six years ago, I gave up my child, our child. I gave it up for adoption. That\u2019s why I wear the shamrock. It symbolizes the love I have for the baby I wish every day I never let go.\u201d</p><p>My body goes limp. Looking around, I can\u2019t figure out why she\u2019d tell me this in a public place. Oh God, my stomach lurches when I think about how I wanted to run my tongue over the sparkling green emerald in her belly button. I start to get up but sit back down, needing a chance to understand what she\u2019s telling me. The words catch in my throat and nothing comes out. I stare at her in disbelief for the longest time, trying to see anything but the truth, but I can\u2019t find it. I glance around at the empty restaurant and feel as if I\u2019m suffocating.</p><p>\u201cI . . . I . . . didn\u2019t want . . . I didn\u2019t want to have to tell you, but I knew I couldn\u2019t start this relationship with a lie. That\u2019s\u2014that\u2019s why I wanted to keep it casual. I . . . I thought you\u2019d get me out of your system and move on,\u201d she stammers.</p><p>My eyes flare to hers, but the fire I feel is not from want or lust. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me then? Why?\u201d</p><p>She holds my gaze. \u201cBecause I didn\u2019t think you\u2019d care.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you don\u2019t know me at all,\u201d I spit out.</p><p>\u201cNo, I do know you. I do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what? Is this one of those half-truths? Because I\u2019ll tell you something\u2014you\u2019re only fooling yourself.\u201d</p><p>Standing up, I reach in my pocket and toss a fifty on the table. With her chest visibly rising and falling, she watches me silently. She stares at me with a blank expression and says nothing else. I look at her one last time and then walk away, leaving her sitting there. As soon as the cool air hits my lungs, I feel I can finally breathe. I pace the sidewalk with my hands behind my head and stare through the glass at her. A few seconds later she\u2019s standing in front of me.</p><p>\u201cBen, let\u2019s talk about this. I want to explain everything. It\u2019s not easy for me, but I understand you\u2019re upset.\u201d</p><p>My eyes burn into hers with an anger I\u2019ve never felt for anyone. \u201cWhat exactly are you going to explain? Explain how you had a baby, my baby, and gave it up without ever telling me?\u201d I hiss.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not like that. It wasn\u2019t that easy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? What part wasn\u2019t easy? The part you skipped about informing the father?\u201d</p><p>Her eyes drop. \u201cPlease, Ben, let\u2019s go back in and sit down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would you think you should tell me something like that in a public place?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said you wanted to put the past behind you. I just wanted to meet somewhere neutral and do the same.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you f**king kidding me? That is not the past.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is. It\u2019s mine.\u201d Her voice is a whisper.</p><p>My voice is tight. \u201cHow could you not tell me back then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI tried. I called you twice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI remember your calls. You called and left a couple of messages that said to call you back. There was no urgency in your tone. You knew I had a girlfriend. I couldn\u2019t call you back. That wasn\u2019t trying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI called,\u201d she cries again, her voice fading.</p><p>I throw my hands up in the air. \u201cYou knew I couldn\u2019t see you again. You had to know that\u2019s why I thought you were calling. So you may have called, but you didn\u2019t try to tell me this. Don\u2019t fool yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat difference would it have made if I had told you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat difference?\u201d My voice spikes up in anger.</p><p>\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t have changed anything.\u201d</p><p>I stare at her with coldness in my eyes. \u201cFuck, is that another one of your half-truths?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo guy wants to hear he got a girl pregnant,\u201d she says, her voice raspy.</p><p>\u201cHow would you know what I wanted to hear when you never gave me the chance?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat would have been the point?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe point in telling me we conceived a child? The point in telling me there\u2019s a part of me out there in the world? I don\u2019t know, maybe that I deserved to know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she cries, and closes her eyes.</p><p>I stare at her, my heart feeling pulled in so many directions I don\u2019t know what to do. Then without another word I turn and walk away.</p><p>CHAPTER 20</p><p>Little White Lies</p><p>Bell</p><p>The dogwood trees blow in the wind and their white blossoms whirl in the air. One sticks to my arm, but I swat it off. I don\u2019t want to make a wish on it today. I watch him, following his back as he walks away from me until I can\u2019t see him anymore. I bolt down the street as fast as I can, running nowhere. When another blossom blows in my path, I pause for a brief moment and decide to make a wish after all. I wish for him to understand\u2014even when I know that\u2019s impossible. Still, I\u2019m not sorry I told him. I know I had to. I am, however, sorry I didn\u2019t do things differently from the start. I\u2019m sorry about how I messed my own life up again. I\u2019m sorry I can\u2019t go back in time and change everything. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Feeling defeated, lost, and disheartened, I turn around and go back to the restaurant to get my things. It\u2019s quiet inside and thank God Rocko is nowhere to be seen. Pebbles has always been a place of comfort for me. That\u2019s why I flock here whenever I\u2019m nervous. It\u2019s kind of like a home away from home. When I was little, my dad would bring me here after school sometimes, just him and me. We\u2019d sit and talk about my day, about music, and about my brothers. Rocko would join us sometimes and they\u2019d talk about when they were younger. They were good friends, attended high school together and Rocko even played the drums for my dad when he was on the road. So after my dad died I came here a lot. I\u2019d take a bus after school to just sit and talk to Rocko. He\u2019s told me so many stories about my dad, good ones, happy ones\u2014it was the way I wanted to remember him.</p><p>A brief bittersweet smile passes across my lips as I walk by the bar and look at the picture on the wall of Rocko and my dad among all the other celebrity photos. My dad was famous even if he never thought so. More tears fill my eyes and I don\u2019t even know who they\u2019re for anymore\u2014my dad or Ben. I grab the package of books off the table and fumble for keys in my purse. When I go back outside I hand my keys off to the valet and wait while he quickly pulls my car up. He opens my door and I seek refuge inside. The sound of the car engine helps to muffle my loud cries.</p><p>You knew better, I cry to myself. You did. I slam the steering wheel. I thought he\u2019d be mad, but I didn\u2019t expect disdain from him or his disgust. The flame of attraction that burned in his deep blue eyes whenever he looked at me was extinguished the minute my words registered.</p><p>The drive home feels too short and the walk up the stairs even shorter. The longest part of the day is yet to come\u2014the night I was supposed to spend with him. I throw myself on the couch and lie here for the longest time. My phone rings and I glance at it, knowing it won\u2019t be him. It\u2019s not. It\u2019s Tate. Why won\u2019t he leave me alone? I ignore it and resume my blank stare, not wanting my numbness to vanish because the pain will be too much to bear.</p> <p>I must have fallen asleep, because the sound of my phone ringing again wakes me up. I sit up and look around before reaching for it. Romeo Fairchild flashes across the screen.</p><p>\u201cHello,\u201d I answer.</p><p>\u201cBell, it\u2019s Romeo. Sorry to bother you at home but that band you recommended is playing tonight at a bar not too far from the showroom and since you told me you lived close by I was wondering if you would come over and tell me what you think.\u201d</p><p>I contemplate the idea. Maybe some distraction is just what I need. Maybe a drink wouldn\u2019t be so bad either. I need to get Ben out of my system. To not let this bring me down. I knew better than to go down this road with him. I knew there was nowhere else for it to end up. Ben just isn\u2019t the kind of guy to open his arms and say I forgive you, it\u2019s okay. Somehow I hoped it would be different, yet in my heart I always knew things would end up like this.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think, Bell? Tate said he\u2019d try to make it too.\u201d</p> <p>His voice over the line jolts me from my thoughts. Something doesn\u2019t feel right with this invite. I remember when I was leaving last night in a rush to see Ben that I saw Tate and Romeo and that girl I feel I\u2019ve seen somewhere before standing together, the three of them at the makeshift bar.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, I can\u2019t tonight, but I\u2019m sure you and Tate will find your own kind of fun.\u201d</p><p>His laugh is a rumble. \u201cGuess you\u2019re not interested in our kind of fun. Sorry to hear that. But if you change your mind we\u2019ll be at a place called Beck\u2019s. It\u2019ll be fun, I promise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have to go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, no worries,\u201d he says, and hangs up.</p><p>I stand up and pace the room. The brown package is on the couch where I threw it. I open it up and place both books on the coffee table, The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn on top.</p> <p>I decide to call my mother. I can talk to her about this.</p><p>\u201cEverything okay?\u201d she answers.</p><p>\u201cYes, but you sound like everything isn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m talking to Aunt Celeste. Jagger\u2019s father is really sick and Jack and I are going to fly out in the morning to be with her. Can I call you back?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. No rush. I hope everything is okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll call you back,\u201d she says, and hangs up.</p><p>I try to call Jagger but there\u2019s no answer. I try Aerie but no answer there either. My aunt and Jagger\u2019s father were close; at least they were when I spent a year with my aunt in Paris. She spoke to him every day. I felt they were in love, but they were two ships that passed in the night, star-crossed lovers, I remember thinking.</p><p>With sadness for my aunt and Jagger in my already broken heart and no one else to talk to about Ben, I head for the door, leaving my cell phone behind. I need to chase away the dark clouds storming in my head\u2014a few bottles of wine, maybe even a bottle of vodka can certainly help me do that.</p> <p>CHAPTER 21</p><p>Away from the Sun</p><p>Ben</p><p>The winds have picked up as I tear down the road. I haven\u2019t wanted a drink in a long time, but I do now. I ride like hell to get out of town. I don\u2019t pay any attention to where I\u2019m going, turning right or left depending on which light is green. A few hours later I end up far from where I started, in West Hollywood, only a few blocks from Beck\u2019s. The traffic is f**king bumper to bumper and I can\u2019t sit in it. I park in the first open spot I find and walk the rest of the way to his place.</p><p>The sign above the door is lit in neon red. It\u2019s like a beacon lighting my way in a storm. I slip inside the hole-in-the-wall bar and look around. The place has really changed. The jukebox that sat in one corner is gone, as are the few booths that used to line the wall to the right. They\u2019ve been replaced by a stage and a dance floor made out of parquet wood. The few bunches of tables that used to be scattered throughout have multiplied into many. The giant L-shaped bar is the same and the wall of beer taps that rests behind hasn\u2019t changed. I sit at the end of the bar and a chick I don\u2019t know approaches me.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you having?\u201d</p><p>I scan the more than one hundred beers behind her. \u201cWhatever you want to give me,\u201d I answer, unable to decide.</p><p>She pours a beer and sets it in front of me. I stare at it for the longest time as she tends to some other customers. Then I pick it up and down it.</p><p>She bends down in front of me to wipe a few too many times around where the condensation from my beer mug dripped on the bar. \u201cAnother?\u201d</p><p>I nod. \u201cBeck around?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSenior or Junior?\u201d she asks, twisting to refill my glass.</p><p>\u201cJunior.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, he\u2019s not around much anymore.\u201d She bounces her tits in my face.</p><p>\u201cWho are you?\u201d I ask her.</p><p>She smiles. \u201cI\u2019m the new manager. My name is Kate.\u201d</p><p>I lift my glass. \u201cNice to meet you, Kate. The place looks great.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, the band Echo starts tonight. They\u2019re really good. You sticking around?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI might be.\u201d</p><p>Beer after beer . . . I chug them down and before I know it I\u2019ve moved on to my trusty old Jack. She pours me another drink and I hazily stare at what she\u2019s wanted me to notice all night. Her tits hang out of her tight T-shirt nicely. They\u2019re not bad-looking and neither is she\u2014short blond hair, medium height, about forty.</p><p>\u201cHow do you know Beck?\u201d she asks over the start of the blasting sound of the bass.</p><p>I glance around and notice the band is onstage and the dance floor is full. \u201cI met him here. He works for me now.\u201d</p><p>She smiles. \u201cYou\u2019re his new boss.\u201d</p><p>I try not to slur my words. \u201cThat would be me. I\u2019m Ben. Ben Covington.\u201d I reach for her hand.</p><p>She extends hers. \u201cNice to meet you.\u201d</p><p>A redhead I hadn\u2019t noticed before calls her over to the other end of the bar. When I look over toward her, she winks at me and I can\u2019t keep my lips from pulling into a frown as I think of S\u2019belle\u2019s red hair. My mind wanders back to what she told me today\u2014I have a child out there somewhere in the world. A child that is about the same age I was when my father died. My mood turns dark.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s bad news,\u201d the bartender says.</p><p>I turn to look at her. \u201cMakes no difference to me.\u201d</p><p>She nods. \u201cTrust me, it should.\u201d</p><p>I shrug. \u201cA chick\u2019s a chick.\u201d</p><p>I stand up and gain my balance, needing to hit the restroom. To get to the back hallway I need to weave my way through the crowd. The number of people has multiplied tenfold since I arrived and everyone seems to be in their own world, caught up in the music and seduction of those around them. The band is pretty decent and I catch the sound of horns in the background, which even in my state draws my attention. The bartender chick was right, they are pretty good.</p><p>When I come out I run right into the redhead from the bar. Her gaze traces me and I allow mine to do the same to her. She\u2019s tall, really tall. Her features are attractive enough and her body isn\u2019t bad. I zero in on her ample chest and catch sight of her ni**les pebbling through her sheer top. Fuck, she\u2019s not wearing a bra.</p><p>\u201cFancy meeting you here,\u201d she says, her eyes locking on mine.</p><p>I allow a smirk to cross my lips. \u201cSomething tells me you planned it.\u201d</p><p>She raises an eyebrow. \u201cCocky, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>I shrug. \u201cCan I buy you a drink?\u201d</p><p>She smiles and steps a little closer. \u201cI\u2019d love that.\u201d</p><p>I sidestep her to head to the bar. The place is so packed there\u2019s nowhere to move. I turn toward her. \u201cStay here and I\u2019ll grab us a couple of drinks. What are you drinking?\u201d</p><p>She tugs the collar of my shirt. \u201cWe could go somewhere . . . quieter,\u201d she whispers in my ear as she leans forward.</p><p>I pull back and stare at her, considering the possibility of forgetting everything and just getting lost in her. \u201cHow about a drink first?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure, vodka cranberry.\u201d</p><p>Just as I pass the dance floor I come face-to-face with not only Tate Wyatt but f**king Romeo Fairchild. I try to ignore them both, but as soon as I walk past them one of their hands is on my shoulder.</p><p>\u201cBen, man, it\u2019s been far too long.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m in no mood for this guy\u2019s shit. I turn to look at him. My eyes take him in\u2014dressed in a suit with a smug-ass look on his face. I really want to deck him. \u201cNot long enough,\u201d I mutter under my breath, and keep walking.</p><p>\u201cI saw your name on your friend\u2019s phone not too long ago. Shame you\u2019re just friends because she\u2019s a hot piece of ass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy the f**k is she showing you her phone?\u201d I don\u2019t even give him time to explain because I don\u2019t give a shit what he has to say. I just turn around ready to pound him to the floor like the piece of shit he is. This arrogant son of bitch and I were never friends, but his superiority complex isn\u2019t why he hates me. He hates me because he couldn\u2019t get the one thing in high school he wanted\u2014Dahlia.</p><p>A hand grips my shoulder a little too tightly and draws my attention. I twist around, ready to deck the guy getting in my space.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d Beck asks.</p><p>My teeth are gritted and the anger is all I can feel. He steps between me and them. He whispers something to them I can\u2019t hear and they make their way toward the door.</p><p>\u201cYeah, you better leave,\u201d I spit out.</p><p>Beck grabs me. \u201cShut the f**k up.\u201d</p><p>I take a step back. \u201cYeah, sorry, man.\u201d</p><p>His lips settle into a thin firm line. \u201cCome on, man, let\u2019s get out of here.\u201d He pulls me toward the back door and Ruby is right behind him. I nod in her direction. The fraction of a smile graces her lips in return.</p><p>I look at Beck. \u201cYou two just got here. Don\u2019t you want to stay and celebrate with me?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He furrows his brow. \u201cLet\u2019s get you home and you can tell me all about what you\u2019re celebrating.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFair enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, what happened to that drink?\u201d the redhead asks, pulling on my shirt.</p><p>I turn around. \u201cYeah, sorry about that. I have to go.\u201d</p> <p>She stands there pissed as hell looking at me. I shrug, not really caring about being cordial right now.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re an ass**le,\u201d she mutters.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I am,\u201d I toss back at her.</p><p>We hit the outside a few seconds later and the sudden burst of air makes my stomach turn. Beck and Ruby walk in front of me not saying a word. They turn into the side alley where Beck\u2019s Jeep is parked. I start to feel sicker with each step. I stop at his car but have to brace my hands against the brick of the building and hang my head. Inhaling and exhaling over and over, I catch my breath.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not going to barf in my car?\u201d he asks.</p> <p>I shake my head no and climb into the backseat with my head spinning.</p><p>Over his shoulder as he drives he asks, \u201cWhere are you parked?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have no f**king idea.\u201d I laugh.</p><p>\u201cAre you for real?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat crawled up your ass?\u201d</p><p>He slams his foot on the brake and jerks the car into PARK, then turns around. \u201cI don\u2019t want to see you ruin everything you\u2019ve worked so hard to accomplish.\u201d</p> <p>His words are sobering. \u201cI found out today I have a kid out there somewhere that I never knew about.\u201d</p><p>Ruby\u2019s head snaps in my direction.</p><p>Beck\u2019s eyes soften. \u201cLet\u2019s get your vehicle and get you home and I\u2019ll throw on a pot of coffee and we can talk about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, man. I think my bike\u2019s down on Melrose somewhere.\u201d</p><p>Beck rides my motorcycle and Ruby drives his Jeep to Laguna. I fade in and out of consciousness until we hit the beach. The smell of the sea air awakens my senses. I stare out the window and into the vast body of water. Childhood memories assault me one after another\u2014making sand castles, flying a kite, shell hunting. My phone is vibrating like a motherfucker, but I ignore it. When we get to my house, I sit at the kitchen table and cradle my head in my hands.</p><p>Beck makes the coffee and pulls three mugs from the cupboard.</p><p>Ruby sits beside me. She takes my hand. \u201cDo you want to talk about it?\u201d</p><p>I take a breath. \u201cYou know the girl I told you about?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe one with the French name?\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t hold back a slight smile. \u201cYeah, S\u2019belle. Well, her name is Bell.\u201d</p><p>She nods, obviously already knowing this.</p><p>Beck sets three cups of coffee on the table and has a seat.</p><p>I take a sip of mine. \u201cI . . .\u201d I ponder how to say I f**ked her one night without a condom and never thought twice about the lack of protection.</p><p>\u201cYou slept with her and she got pregnant?\u201d Ruby asks.</p><p>I stare down at the table. \u201cYes, I slept with her one night my senior year of college when I had a girlfriend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDahlia?\u201d she asks.</p><p>I nod, not really remembering how much I told her during any of my previous drunken ventures but ascertaining that I blabbed about plenty. \u201cShe told me today . . .\u201d I tell them both everything that happened earlier this evening. They listen, no judgment or comment.</p><p>When I\u2019m finished baring my soul, Ruby asks, \u201cDo you know if it was an open or a closed adoption.\u201d</p><p>My eyes rise to hers. \u201cI have no idea. What does it matter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAn open adoption usually has an option of contact.\u201d</p><p>I shoot her a quizzical look.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m adopted. I\u2019ve known since I was six years old, but my adoption was closed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour parents told you when you were young,\u201d I comment.</p><p>\u201cYes, they didn\u2019t want me to feel any less loved and I didn\u2019t. In fact, I grew up feeling extremely special. But a part of me wanted to know who my birth parents were. I went through the whole nature-nurture debate in my mind and when I turned eighteen I paid a woman five hundred dollars to locate my biological parents. She wasn\u2019t able to find my birth father, but she gave me the address and phone number of my birth mother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy couldn\u2019t she locate your birth father?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis name wasn\u2019t recorded on the birth certificate.\u201d</p><p>With my elbows on the table, I steeple my hands together and then look over toward Ruby. \u201cDid you contact your birth mother? Did she tell you who he was?\u201d</p><p>She shakes her head. \u201cI love my parents\u2014my adoptive parents, and once I had that piece of paper in my hand, I decided I didn\u2019t need to know.\u201d</p><p>Beck stands, lifting his empty cup. He looks down at Ruby. \u201cWe should go.\u201d</p><p>She glances up at him and nods. She rises and shifts her eyes to me. \u201cBen, if you ever want to talk, call me.\u201d</p><p>I walk them to the door and Beck leans over toward me. \u201cYou call me first the next time you feel the need to go to my bar. You know I\u2019m always here to talk.\u201d</p><p>I nod sincerely, shooting him an appreciative glance.</p><p>Staring at them as they walk to their car, I think about what Ruby said. Then I stand there wondering if someday in the future I\u2019ll be sitting across from a person with a piece of paper in her hand with my name on it.</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>He runs down the stairs with a football tucked under his arm. He\u2019s wearing a Chicago Bears football helmet and a blue jersey that\u2019s too big for him. It looks so familiar.</p><p>\u201cHey, champ, slow down,\u201d I call as he hurtles past me.</p><p>\u201cDaddy, Daddy, I did it,\u201d he says as he comes to a stop next to me.</p><p>I look down at his flushed face and brush his blond hair from his eyes. \u201cWhat did you do, champ?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI roared. I roared,\u201d he says with a gleam in his eye.</p><p>With a huge grin on my face, I bend down to pick him up. \u201cYou scored, little lion, you scored.\u201d</p><p>The little boy\u2019s laughter morphs into mine. His eyes look just like mine. His voice sounds like mine. Then all of a sudden, I become my father and the little boy becomes me.</p><p>Fuck, I wake up with sweat pouring from my brow. I look out into the ocean in an attempt to calm down. I couldn\u2019t sleep, so I moved out to the deck early this morning to listen to the sound of the water crashing against the rocks.</p><p>\u201cBen?\u201d a voice calls from somewhere below me.</p><p>My head thunders in pain as I quickly sit up in the lounge chair and look into the sky, assessing the time. The sun is overhead. Looks to be around noon.</p><p>\u201cBen?\u201d the voice says again.</p><p>\u201cUp here, Serena.\u201d</p><p>I can hear the thumping of her sneakers against the weathered wood of the stairs and I see her dirty blond hair, much shorter than the last time I saw her, blowing in the wind. \u201cAre you ignoring my calls?\u201d she asks, taking the last step.</p><p>I shade my eyes with my hand. \u201cNo, I just have a lot going on. You cut your hair?\u201d</p><p>She looks down at me in the lounge chair. \u201cYes, I did, and don\u2019t change the subject. Do the words let\u2019s have lunch tomorrow ring a bell?\u201d</p><p>I throw my head back against the chaise. \u201cSorry.\u201d I grimace. \u201cYour hair looks nice.\u201d</p><p>She kicks my leg off the lounge. \u201cThanks. Now come on, let\u2019s go for a walk.\u201d</p><p>I stare at her a beat, but don\u2019t move. \u201cCould you turn the volume down a notch?\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widen in disbelief. \u201cAre you hungover?\u201d</p><p>I slowly sit back up, still squinting to see her through the brightness of the sun. My head feels as if someone is pounding a hammer right in the middle of it. \u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet up. I\u2019m not leaving until you talk to me.\u201d There\u2019s an angry edge to her voice.</p><p>I shake my head and another crack of thunder explodes inside it.</p><p>She stretches out her hand with disappointment more than evident on her face. \u201cCome on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me brush my teeth first at least.\u201d</p><p>She crosses to the glass doors. \u201cI\u2019ll make us a cup of coffee.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d I grimace as I stand.</p><p>Water gushes from the faucet as I try to scrub last\u2019s night drunken encounter from my mouth. I hop in the shower, hoping that will make me feel better. When I head to the kitchen the smell of freshly brewed coffee assaults me, turning my stomach. I\u2019ll pass on a cup this morning.</p><p>My sister rinses her empty cup and places it in the sink. She turns around. \u201cAre you drinking again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, not really. I needed a release, so I went out last night.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes glisten with tears.</p><p>\u201cSerena, I\u2019m doing okay. I\u2019m not going down that road again. I promise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope not,\u201d she says, handing me a coffee and heading for the door.</p><p>I take a gulp and follow her. The heat burns my tongue and I leave the cup on the deck, taking two steps at a time to catch up with her. We walk the beach for a long while without conversation until she turns to look at me.</p><p>She finally breaks the silence. \u201cI went to the cemetery yesterday and saw the seashells you put on Mom\u2019s gravestone.\u201d I glance over at her. \u201cYeah, I\u2019ve been thinking about her a lot lately.\u201d</p><p>She takes a deep breath and inhales the fresh sea air. \u201cMe too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure she must miss the beach.\u201d</p><p>She nods.</p><p>I stare out into the distance and catch sight of a sailboat going by. I point to it. \u201cDo you ever wonder what life would be like if you could go back and change things?\u201d</p><p>She bends down in the sand to pick up a seashell. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t. There\u2019s no sense in doing that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSometimes I do. I think it\u2019s the littlest things that could make the biggest changes.\u201d</p><p>She makes a face of contemplation but doesn\u2019t answer. We walk for a bit and then I decide to just tell her. \u201cI started seeing S\u2019belle while you were gone,\u201d I blurt out.</p><p>She stops to pick up another shell and when she rises she hands it to me. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t surprise me.\u201d</p><p>Brushing the sand from it, I examine its beauty and think about its uniqueness. No two seashells are ever the same. I look at my sister. \u201cShe told me something yesterday that caught me completely off guard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you like to tell me what it was?\u201d</p><p>I\u2019ve gone over in my mind who must know about the baby. I\u2019m guessing S\u2019belle\u2019s family and more than likely Dahlia. What I\u2019m not certain about is if Dahlia would have told Serena. I turn toward her. \u201cDid you know about the baby?\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widen. A look of shock crosses her face. \u201cDo I know about what baby?\u201d</p><p>I toss the shell I\u2019m holding into the ocean and watch it hit the water.</p><p>She grabs my arms. \u201cWhat are you talking about, Ben?\u201d</p><p>I feel my throat tightening. \u201cMy baby.\u201d</p><p>She stares in disbelief, her mouth open. \u201cYour\u2014your ba-a-b-b-by?\u201d she stutters.</p><p>I nod. \u201cS\u2019belle, Bell, I mean, got pregnant that night I spent with her in college. She had the baby and gave it up for adoption.\u201d</p><p>My sister\u2019s hand flies to her mouth.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I was a little shocked too.\u201d I try to keep the edge off my sarcasm.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s sit down,\u201d she whispers, walking toward the rocks and choosing one. I sit beside her and bend to sift the sand with my fingers.</p><p>\u201cHow do you feel about it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you think I feel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re upset?\u201d she asks.</p><p>\u201cFuck yes, I\u2019m upset. There\u2019s been a kid out there in the world for the past six years that\u2019s mine and I never knew he or she existed until yesterday.\u201d</p><p>She takes my hand. \u201cWhat did she say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe told me she gave birth on St. Patrick\u2019s Day and gave the baby away.\u201d</p><p>She looks at me for the longest time. \u201cAre you sure it was yours?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYes, I mean no,\u201d I stammer.</p><p>\u201cBut she told you it was?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you believe her?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI have no reason to think she\u2019d lie about that.

She wanted to leave the past in the past.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t she tell you before?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe said she tried to contact me, but I didn\u2019t call her back.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDid she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSerena, come on. Yeah, she called me, but . . .\u201d I stop, not really sure what the but is. That she didn\u2019t try hard enough, try often enough?</p><p>\u201cWhere did you leave it?\u201d</p><p>I drop her hand and cradle my head. \u201cNowhere. I left her standing there. I was so f**king pissed. I had a right to know.\u201d I glance over at her. \u201cI had a right to know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you did, but put yourself in her place. You were with someone else. She was young and I\u2019m sure she was scared. It must have been hard for her. Shit, it was hard for me when I found out I was pregnant. I was twenty and scared shitless\u2014scared to tell Jason, scared to tell Mom, and so scared to have a baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but you had him. And you kept him . . . .\u201d My voice trails off.</p> <p>\u201cYes, but my circumstances were different. I was with Jason. He was there to help me through all my doubts.\u201d</p><p>I run my hands through my hair. \u201cAre you defending her?\u201d</p><p>She gives me a stern look. \u201cNo. I\u2019m not. I just think maybe you should think a little more about her and a little less about yourself.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 22</p><p>Burn</p><p>Bell</p><p>Guilt chased me for years. Guilt for pursuing a guy that belonged to someone else, guilt for asking a friend to drive me home from a bar and being oblivious of her drunken state, guilt for giving up my baby. It was a domino effect\u2014I chased someone I shouldn\u2019t have and wound up pregnant. When I found out, I couldn\u2019t wait to tell him in hopes he might be as thrilled as I was and that it might change things between us. But in my haste to get home to meet him, one of my friends died, and the guilt was more than I could stand. How could I raise a child? I was irresponsible and incapable\u2014I was sure of that. And with that realization came the certainty that someone else could give my baby the life I knew I couldn\u2019t.</p><p>I never blamed anyone for my actions but myself\u2014not my dead father, not my mother, not my brothers, and not any former lover. I just swam in my own self-condemnation. It hung around the fringes of my very existence. For years, it teased me, taunted me. It haunted me to the point that it almost dragged me under. But then something happened, something that made me realize I could let it go. That something was a friendship with a very special person\u2014Dahlia London. Her kindness and understanding helped me see through my pain and made me understand it was okay to move on. With her support and that of my family, I finally found direction in my life. I stopped flailing and decided it was time to grow up.</p> <p>Don\u2019t get me wrong\u2014the constant guilt is still there. Time can never fully heal those wounds. But I had come to accept my decision and because of that, I was able to start anew. It hadn\u2019t been easy. My wounds ran deep. Yet somehow I was confident that I could continue to heal. My choices had led me to where I ended up. I had accepted that. When I started down this path, I was a young, immature woman. And once I made my decision, I was a lost girl who looked for love in all the wrong places.</p><p>Now I\u2019ve turned my life around. I\u2019m doing great\u2014well, not great but really well. Sure, my job sucks. Working for Tate Wyatt started as a dream job, but the novelty wore off the more his attention toward me bled into possessiveness. I am handling it, though. And I don\u2019t really love living here. However, I\u2019m not home that often and my family stops by or I visit them often.</p><p>But the hardest thing about telling Ben is that I\u2019m feeling lost again, and I can\u2019t shake the feeling. All the memories keep swooshing around in my head and I can\u2019t get them out. I spent all day in bed and called in sick on Monday, but Tuesday comes way too fast. I wake up from a dream. The same dream I always have but this time instead of smiling I yell, \u201cDamn you, Ben Covington, you came back into my life with all your charm and turned my world around one minute, then upside down the next just like you did to me before.\u201d My mind keeps repeating over and over, You should have known better. You did know better. You kept yourself at a distance. You tried so hard to stay aloof. But the more time you spent with him, the more time you wanted to spend with him. I shake my head, saying to myself, \u201cYeah, it\u2019s all true but it doesn\u2019t make it any better.\u201d</p><p>My legs swing onto the floor and I push myself into the shower, drag myself out of it, force myself to dry my hair, dab on a minimal amount of makeup, and dress as casually and comfortably as I can for work and still get away with it.</p><p>With coffees in hand I enter the showroom. Tate is standing at Josie\u2019s desk with his arms crossed talking to her. His head snaps up.</p><p>I cross the room, stopping at Josie\u2019s desk. \u201cCoffees for everyone.\u201d I manage a smile.</p><p>Tate takes his and with a huff he storms off. His door slams, but before I can say anything to Josie, it reopens. \u201cBell, I need you in my office in fifteen minutes.\u201d</p><p>I nod and his door slams again.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on with you?\u201d Josie asks, clearly concerned.</p><p>\u201cNothing.\u201d I take the lid off my coffee.</p><p>\u201cYou look like shit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJeez . . . thank you.\u201d</p><p>She laughs. \u201cSeriously, where have you been and what\u2019s the matter? I left you a message and yesterday Tate was the biggest ass**le that ever walked on the planet. Did something happen?\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t want to break down at work. \u201cOh, Josie, so much has happened, but Tate is the least of my worries. He showed up at my event on Friday with Romeo.\u201d I lower my voice. \u201cI think they may have been having a threesome.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith you?\u201d she asks, shocked.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHoly shit, those are two hot men. I bet they both have big\u2014\u201d</p><p>I cut her off. \u201cEwww . . . don\u2019t say it. I am not interested in either of them and definitely not the two of them together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019d be in between.\u201d She tips her coffee cup in my direction.</p><p>I start to walk away. \u201cNot interested.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened to Glow Boy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGlow Boy?\u201d I toss over my shoulder.</p><p>\u201cThe one who had you glowing brighter than a firefly for the last few weeks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe dumped me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you were shagging him,\u201d she says, not exactly quietly.</p><p>\u201cShhh . . . And I was not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, whatever you were doing it\u2019s better than what I\u2019m doing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd since when do you say shag?\u201d</p><p>She smiles and shrugs. \u201cSeemed appropriate.\u201d</p><p>I toss my stuff on my desk and flop in my chair. \u201cHey, are you doing okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe? Ha! Me and Bob are doing great.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBob? Who\u2019s Bob?\u201d</p><p>\u201cB.O.B.,\u201d she spells out.</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d I laugh, thinking I haven\u2019t used mine in so long I kind of forgot about it.</p><p>\u201cOh is right,\u201d she says, turning around.</p><p>I turn on my computer and think that at least work will take my mind off Ben for a little bit.</p><p>\u201cBell, are you coming?\u201d Tate\u2019s voice booms from his office door.</p><p>\u201cYes, let me grab a pad and pen. I\u2019ll be right there.\u201d</p><p>Josie turns around. \u201cJust remember, big . . .\u201d</p><p>I cover my ears. \u201cDon\u2019t say it.\u201d</p><p>She doesn\u2019t know we dated, because I ended things before she started work here. And although I never actually had sex with him, I am very well aware how big he is from the couple of times he shoved my hands down his pants during some heavy make-out sessions. The thing was, I\u2019ve never needed more than first base with a guy. I do like to feel wanted, but the actual sex part isn\u2019t important to me\u2014until Ben. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I\u2019ve slept with my fair share of men. Any boyfriend\u2019s end game is to score, but I don\u2019t always let them win. Sometimes I cut them loose because I just don\u2019t feel any connection, but there are times when I\u2019ve drunk enough to get myself in the mood and then I feel something, and something is better than nothing. But those times are past.</p><p>I keep my eyes down as I pass Josie\u2019s desk for fear she\u2019ll make me laugh. Tate\u2019s door is cracked open. I knock. \u201cCan I come in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he says in a cold tone.</p><p>I step in and leave the door open.</p><p>\u201cShut the door and take a seat.\u201d</p><p>I inwardly roll my eyes at his dramatic behavior, but I do as he says.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell were you thinking? When a client asks you to come meet him, you don\u2019t say no. Was it because you didn\u2019t want to run into that boy toy of yours so you didn\u2019t come?\u201d</p><p>Boy toy? I have no idea what he\u2019s talking about, and the blank look on my face must register with Tate.</p><p>\u201cRomeo told me he saw some guy\u2019s name on your phone and that same guy was at Beck\u2019s with his face buried in another girl.\u201d</p><p>Tears sting my eyes and any energy I had managed to muster up this morning is depleted immediately. Ben already found someone else? I should have known. I sit up straight, knowing I am not going to allow my boss to see my weakened state. \u201cNo, Tate, that\u2019s not what I was thinking. I was actually thinking how inappropriate it was for you to tell our client where I live and for said client to call me at the last minute and expect me to drop everything to come running.\u201d</p><p>He clears his throat. \u201cWell, moving on, the Johnsons are having some issues with the florist. Can you see if you can help them out?\u201d</p><p>I jot it down on my pad, trying to control my furious shaking. He continues with a list of items that need to be taken care of and I write them down, never once lifting my head to meet his scrutiny. About twenty minutes later he finishes.</p><p>I stand up. \u201cI\u2019m still not feeling well, so if you don\u2019t mind I\u2019m going to take care of these issues from home.\u201d</p><p>He nods. \u201cThat\u2019s fine.\u201d</p><p>I walk out of his office on trembling legs and go to my desk, collect my things, and make my way to the door. As I step out onto the sidewalk I realize I never said good-bye to Josie. I didn\u2019t even notice if she was at her desk.</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>My grandmother loved to go places but hated to drive. She didn\u2019t think it an extravagance that she had a driver take her where she wanted to go, and neither did any of us. My grandfather used to joke that she was like Driving Miss Daisy. I own that movie now and watch it whenever I want to be close to her. I stop it and rewind before it gets to the sad part, though. I don\u2019t like sad. My grandmother had her license and she could drive; she just chose not to. She told me she liked to ride in the car and look out the window\u2014that was why. In fact, the only time I remember her being behind the wheel was the night my father killed himself. She came to pick up River and me, but I didn\u2019t know why at the time. It wasn\u2019t until much later that night that my mother and brothers told me my father was dead. I blamed myself, Xander blamed himself, we all blamed ourselves for our fractured family, but we stayed close, maybe even closer because of what had happened.</p><p>My father\u2019s death made River and Xander stronger but not me. Somewhere along the way I let everyone shelter me, coddle me even\u2014after all, I was the baby of the family, the younger sister to two older brothers, the girl who couldn\u2019t make her daddy happy when all he wanted was for her to play the guitar, and the young woman who got pregnant and who lost her direction at the same time. I might look like my grandmother\u2014the red hair, the shorter stature, the curvy form\u2014but unlike my grandmother who loved to go places and found an alternative way to get to them, I\u2019m struggling finding my own alternative way in life. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I want so much to find that elusive direction in my life that I\u2019m determined to make this job work even though it doesn\u2019t. It isn\u2019t just Tate either, it\u2019s me too\u2014I just don\u2019t love it the way I wanted to. But Tate\u2019s hot-and-cold demeanor isn\u2019t helping at all. And now it\u2019s Friday and the workweek isn\u2019t even over. I have to work with him all day tomorrow. The thought makes me want to crawl back into bed. It\u2019s been exhausting trying to push what happened with Ben aside and concentrate on work, so much so I\u2019ve ended up sleeping most of the week when I wasn\u2019t at work.</p><p>And just as draining has been my avoidance of my family. They\u2019ll know immediately something isn\u2019t right when they see me, and I don\u2019t want to discuss what happened with Ben right now. So every time one of them calls I blurt out a reason I have to rush off the phone. With my mother and Jack in New York City, avoiding them has been easy. My brothers too. But Dahlia saw through it all when she called me last night and I couldn\u2019t help myself\u2014I broke down and told her a little bit about Ben\u2014just that I had seen him and it didn\u2019t go well. I left it vague and she didn\u2019t pry. I thought it would be awkward, but it wasn\u2019t. As usual she listened and gave support.</p><p>Peeking through the blinds this morning, I see it\u2019s later than I usually get up, but I\u2019m not sure of the exact time. I unplugged my clock because time was moving too slow. I roll out of bed and relocate to the couch. The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn draws my attention and I decide to read a little bit more. I\u2019ve become obsessed with the boy who isn\u2019t thrilled with his new life of cleanliness, manners, church, and school. The boy whose life on the straight and narrow isn\u2019t necessarily for him but who sticks it out for his friend. It makes me wonder if Ben somehow relates to this character and that\u2019s why he loves the book so much. More than anything I wish I could ask him.</p><p>A light knock on my door tears me from my thoughts, but I opt to pretend I\u2019m not home. When the knocking turns into pounding and a familiar voice carries through the door, I can\u2019t ignore it any longer.</p> <p>\u201cBell, it\u2019s me, Dahlia. I know you\u2019re home. I saw your car in the parking lot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cComing,\u201d I call as I shuffle toward her. Turning the lock, I pull it open and see Dahlia\u2019s shining face.</p><p>Her eyes sweep me from head to toe. \u201cHi, are you just getting up?\u201d She sounds concerned. She pushes past me with a tray of coffees in one hand and a white pastry bag in the other. I step aside and cross my arms as she heads for the kitchen with determination. Today I can tell by the look on her face she\u2019s on a mission and I\u2019m having a hard time seeing the beauty that\u2019s usually the first thing I notice about her.</p><p>I follow her. \u201cHi yourself. What brings you here on a workday?\u201d</p><p>She sets the cups and bag on the counter and pulls out a coffee, squinting to read the side. \u201cDo I need a reason to visit?\u201d</p> <p>I eye her suspiciously. \u201cNo, I guess not.\u201d Although I know why she\u2019s here.</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m going to meet Aerie for lunch and I thought . . .\u201d She pauses, handing me a cup. \u201cHere, this one is yours. Extra cream and sugar.\u201d</p><p>I smile and remove the lid. Happy to have this delicious treat in my hands, I slurp down a big gulp. \u201cOw . . . that\u2019s hot.\u201d</p><p>She laughs. \u201cIt\u2019s coffee, Bell. Of course it\u2019s hot. You\u2019re supposed to sip it, not chug it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know but usually the cream makes it cold.\u201d</p><p>She traipses across the tile floor in her high-heel black boots.</p> <p>\u201cYou were saying?\u201d</p><p>She shrugs. \u201cI don\u2019t remember.\u201d She opens a cupboard and takes a plate out\u2014a clear pink glass one. \u201cCharlotte\u2019s been to the flea market, I see,\u201d she says, eyeing the plate.</p><p>\u201cYep. Came by last weekend with a bag full of groceries, Tupperware, and a few Depression-era pieces.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s beautiful,\u201d she says, opening the bag and setting some muffins on the dish.</p><p>\u201cYeah, it is,\u201d I agree.</p><p>Her eyes meet mine. \u201cBut you still don\u2019t like it here.\u201d</p><p>I lift one shoulder in a shrug. \u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBell, move in with River and me until you find a place you like better. Jagger stayed with us and it was fine, fun even.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI appreciate it but I\u2019ll be quitting Tate\u2019s by the end of the year and then I\u2019ll have a lot of time to figure out where I want to live. And besides, I could never live with my brother.\u201d</p><p>She scrunches her nose. \u201cWhy do you say that? He loves you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing bad, it\u2019s just him and Xander are so overprotective as it is. I couldn\u2019t imagine the third degree any date I brought home might get.\u201d</p><p>She giggles. \u201cYeah, that might be an issue.\u201d She takes the plate and her cup over to the sofa and sets them down on the coffee table. Her eyes dart to the book on the glass surface and I can see what she clearly knows\u2014it is Ben\u2019s favorite book. She pulls a leg up and tucks it under her other one. Turning toward me, she asks, \u201cSo, do you want to talk about it?\u201d</p><p>I sit next to her and take a muffin from the plate. My eyes search hers as I peel back the paper around it.</p><p>\u201cI talked to Aerie. She says Ben seems withdrawn but refuses to talk about it.\u201d She sips her own coffee through the small hole in her lid.</p><p>\u201cYou really should take the cover off. It\u2019s much easier to drink.\u201d</p><p>Her lip curls up. \u201cYou really should stop avoiding the conversation and your family.\u201d</p><p>God, she\u2019s observant\u2014too observant. I sigh as tears prickle my eyes and I can\u2019t hold them back anymore. And as awkward as the face-to-face conversation will be, I decide to tell her some of the things I skipped over last night. Like how I ran into Ben during the summer and then again at his award ceremony. How I was attracted to him and tried to fight it. How he seemed to care about me. How my mother told me I owed him and myself the truth and I agreed with her. And finally how he left me standing alone at the restaurant when I told him about the baby.</p><p>She listens quietly without even flinching and surprisingly without judgment. When I finish she says, \u201cBell, Ben has always been reactive and a bit of an ass**le at times and you have to understand that\u2019s who he is. Sometimes he just needs time alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, he\u2019s got it,\u201d I say. What I don\u2019t tell her is he was out with some girl the very same night, not because she\u2019d care but because I do.</p><p>\u201cHey, listen to me. I know you\u2019re upset right now, but he\u2019ll come around and when he does I just want you to be happy. And if he makes you happy I\u2019m okay with it.\u201d</p><p>I sigh in relief that the thought of me with Ben doesn\u2019t infuriate her, but also knowing there\u2019s no future with Ben anyway. \u201cSo you don\u2019t hate me for everything?\u201d I finally ask.</p><p>Her eyes fill with protectiveness. \u201cGod no! I\u2019m here for you whenever you need me. No matter what it is you want to talk about. Ben is a part of my past, but that doesn\u2019t mean I don\u2019t want what\u2019s best for him. And if you think he\u2019s what\u2019s best for you, then, Bell, I support you.\u201d</p><p>In this moment I can\u2019t possibly love her any more. I swipe my tears away. \u201cWell, he\u2019s not what\u2019s best for me, that\u2019s for sure.\u201d I can\u2019t say anything else as my throat tightens.</p><p>She frowns. \u201cHowever you choose to resolve this, do it, because it\u2019s what you really want. I hate to see you like this.\u201d</p><p>I nod. \u201cI\u2019m fine. Just a minor glitch but don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll be back to normal soon.\u201d</p><p>She eyes me suspiciously. \u201cBell, did Ben tell you how old he was when his father died?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I croak.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not making excuses for him, but he was the same age . . .\u201d She pauses and I answer for her.</p><p>\u201cAs our child would be now.\u201d</p><p>She nods and takes a deep breath. \u201cAnd I think Ben sometimes separates himself from that child who lost his father. . . .\u201d</p><p>As she talks it hits me . . . why he likes Tom Sawyer and Huck Finn\u2014two lost boys. I imagine he likes Peter Pan too. I quickly bring my attention back to Dahlia and shove those thoughts aside.</p><p>\u201cHe has a softness for kids. He always has. He took Trent under his wing and helped Serena raise him. He was a big brother to underprivileged kids for years, and even when he was in New York City he told me he volunteered as a drug counselor to teens. I\u2019m not saying his reaction was right. I\u2019m just saying I think I understand it.\u201d</p><p>I nod, absorbing everything she says. I feel a little raw. Looking at the time on my phone, I jump up. \u201cOh my God, I have to get ready. I have a retirement dinner downtown and I have to make sure the flowers arrived and the tables are set up.\u201d</p><p>She stands up and hugs me. I hold her tightly for a long time before I walk her to the door.</p><p>\u201cCall me,\u201d she says.</p><p>\u201cI will. I promise. And, Dahlia, please don\u2019t tell River about this.\u201d</p><p>She stares at me. \u201cI can\u2019t do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d I beg.</p><p>She sighs. \u201cI won\u2019t bring it up, but if he asks me, I have to tell him.\u201d</p><p>I understand that and hug her close again. \u201cHe won\u2019t ask. Why would he?\u201d</p><p>She pulls back and narrows her eyes at me. \u201cBut you do have to tell him and Xander too. I can\u2019t keep this from him forever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will,\u201d I promise.</p><p>She leaves and I slump back against the door. The thought of it is too much to bear right now. Dahlia wasn\u2019t there when it all went down\u2014how River and Xander wanted to confront Ben and I begged them not to. The truth was, I wasn\u2019t sure if Ben finding out about the baby would change my decision or possibly change my future and I didn\u2019t want it to change at that point. I was too broken to be fixed\u2014or that was how I felt. I wonder now, if I had let them confront him, would my life be different today?</p><p>CHAPTER 23</p><p>Stuck in the Middle</p><p>Ben</p><p>I\u2019m focused intently on my computer screen as I search the TRASH folder for Beck\u2019s monthly layout that I accidentally deleted. Almost a week has passed since I found out I have a kid out in the world. My sister\u2019s words are still swirling around in my brain. \u201cMaybe you should think a little more about her and a little less about yourself.\u201d The trouble is, she is all I have been able to think about. A memory sweeps through me.</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>It was October thirty-first my senior year and S\u2019belle e-mailed me and asked me to meet her that night. It had been almost two months since she had left me sleeping after our night together. I replied no. She asked again and that time I couldn\u2019t say no\u2014so I said I\u2019d meet her later that night. I knew I was lying to myself thinking I could just see her\u2014I knew I couldn\u2019t. I wanted her to know how I felt. I told her that her green eyes were the most otherworldly eyes I had ever seen. That thoughts of her touch excited me. And that her red, almost copper hair haunted me. We agreed to meet at her apartment. She gave me the address.</p><p>But I never went that night, I couldn\u2019t. Dahlia came back early\u2014I wasn\u2019t expecting her. Instead I went the next day to her apartment and she wasn\u2019t home. I went back the next five days and she never answered. The next time I showed up, someone answered and said she didn\u2019t live there anymore.</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>A soft knock on the door pulls me back to the present. \u201cCome in.\u201d</p><p>Aerie enters. \u201cHi. Do you have a minute? I need to talk to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey. Sure. Everything okay?\u201d</p><p>She takes a deep breath. \u201cI know you have a lot going on right now, but I have something to tell you and I\u2019m not sure how you\u2019re going to react.\u201d</p><p>I glance over to her and motion for her to take a seat. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t sound good.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Her eyes meet mine. \u201cJagger got some disturbing news earlier this week.

Let him know I\u2019m here if he needs someone to talk to and let me know if there is anything I can do.\u201d</p> <p>She leans forward. \u201cI\u2019ve decided to go to New York City to be with him. Jagger\u2019s mother, Celeste, is already there, but I feel I should go too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow does that impact Jagger\u2019s movie role?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s dropped out. The announcement will be made later today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you? What are your plans?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe December issue is ready for press. And I can work on January\u2019s from New York. My assistant is back from maternity leave and between her and my intern, who I\u2019d like to hire full-time, I know I can do it.\u201d</p> <p>I rub my hands together. \u201cWe could bring in someone temporarily to lessen your workload.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo! Ben, please. This is my magazine. Let me try,\u201d she pleads, and a few tears prick her eyes.</p><p>I stand up and round the desk. \u201cHey. Of course. I just wanted to lessen your stress. I know how important Sound Music is to you. I\u2019ll do whatever you think is best.\u201d</p><p>She glances up at me. \u201cThank you. I really appreciate it.\u201d</p><p>I lean back against the desk. \u201cWhen are you planning on leaving?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLater tonight.\u201d She grimaces. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry. I only just decided to go this morning when I got off the phone with him. I\u2019ll e-mail you all my information. And I\u2019ll be back for Xander and Ivy\u2019s wedding.\u201d</p> <p>My eyes flash to hers. \u201cThey set a date?\u201d</p><p>She nods. \u201cNew Year\u2019s Eve.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, that\u2019s quick,\u201d is all I can say as my mind wanders back to S\u2019belle.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I\u2019m fine. Anything else? I was just headed to the gym.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Thanks again, Ben.\u201d</p><p>I nod. \u201cNo need to thank me,\u201d I say to her as I usher her to the door and head to the locker room. I need to clear my head.</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p> <p>I\u2019m sweating and biting back grunts as I run like hell, trying to escape my own thoughts. The treadmill beeps three point five miles in twenty-four minutes, my fastest time in years.</p><p>\u201cFuck, mate, are you running from the devil?\u201d Kale asks from beside me, still hammering out his time.</p><p>Lifting my shirt, I pat my face. \u201cSome days it feels that way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou seem preoccupied this week. You got something going on?\u201d</p><p>I gulp my water and look at him. We\u2019re buddies but not in the same way I am with Beck. \u201cSame shit, different day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat girl whose arse you\u2019ve been chasing got you in a snit?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe aren\u2019t seeing each other anymore.\u201d</p><p>He slowed his pace. \u201cIt\u2019s about bloody time. Did you find a new piece yet?\u201d</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cWe aren\u2019t all dirty dogs like you. Some of us do have to work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh . . . don\u2019t forget who outchased whom when I met you. And I work, just not night and day like you.\u201d</p><p>I blanch at the memory of a time when all I cared about was forgetting. Then I force myself to grin at him. \u201cI know you do. Just busting your ass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you decent?\u201d Aerie calls out to us.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a gym, sweetie, not the locker room.\u201d Kale laughs, stepping off the treadmill.</p><p>She comes in and shoots him a look. \u201cI\u2019m not your sweetie.\u201d</p><p>He grins at her. \u201cBut I bet you wish you were.\u201d</p><p>She puts her finger in her mouth, pretending to gag. \u201cNot in this lifetime or any other.\u201d</p><p>I make a T with my hands. \u201cKale, cut the shit. You know she has a guy. And, Aerie, he\u2019s just trying to rile you and you let him every time.\u201d</p><p>She glares at him.</p><p>\u201cDid you need something?\u201d I ask her.</p><p>\u201cYes, I wanted to tell you that I just found out that Kaye left her job at the radio station and maybe we should see if she could help us out temporarily.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKaye?\u201d Kale wiggles his eyebrows.</p><p>Aerie rolls her eyes. \u201cKaye Hudson, or Kimberly as I know her, worked for Sound Music magazine when the former owner, Damon Wolf, wanted to expand into entertainment. She left before the first issue was published, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat sucks,\u201d Kale remarks.</p><p>I shoot him a quizzical look. He never gets emotional about things that don\u2019t impact him.</p><p>\u201cAll that work never to see your first issue go to press. That would suck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow, so you do have a heart,\u201d Aerie says.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not the f**king Tin Man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLanguage, Kale, language,\u201d Aerie says, exasperated.</p><p>His lips twitch. \u201cI bet you let that guy of yours talk dirty to you.\u201d</p><p>She ignores him. \u201cBen, should I call her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe won\u2019t take the job.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I think she might. I found out after she left she had been seeing Damon and things ended badly. So with him gone, I don\u2019t see a problem.\u201d</p><p>I take a deep breath, disgusted by that news. Damon is the biggest ass. I wonder if that\u2019s who she was crying over when we hooked up. \u201cI thought you said you could handle it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can. I\u2019m just worried about you. . . . What if you need something sooner than I can respond?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s see how it goes. After the New Year we can reassess and go from there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut she might have a job by then,\u201d Aerie says.</p><p>I rock back on my heels. \u201cAerie, she and I had a thing while I was in New York City, and we also . . . reconnected one night and things ended badly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I didn\u2019t know.\u201d Aerie blushes.</p><p>\u201cIs this chick that you f**ked hot?\u201d Kale asks.</p><p>With a disgusted look on her face, Aerie turns and slams the door. \u201cDahlia, hey, girl. You\u2019re early,\u201d she says just outside the door.</p><p>Kale\u2019s gaze darts to me. \u201cDahlia?\u201d he mouths. \u201cYour Dahlia?\u201d</p><p>I narrow my eyes at him. \u201cShe\u2019s not my Dahlia,\u201d I mutter, not hearing the rest of their conversation.</p><p>\u201cYeah, he\u2019s in there. I\u2019ll be in my office when you\u2019re ready,\u201d Aerie says.</p><p>Dahlia pops her head in. \u201cHey, Ben, I was hoping I could talk to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure, now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, if you don\u2019t mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWant to grab a cup of coffee?\u201d</p><p>She nods.</p><p>Kale clears his throat.</p><p>\u201cDahlia, this is Kale. Kale, Dahlia. Kale manages Surfer\u2019s End magazine.\u201d</p><p>His eyes sweep her. \u201cNice to meet you.\u201d He grins.</p><p>\u201cYou too,\u201d she answers, and quickly looks toward me. \u201cBen, I\u2019ll wait for you downstairs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, sure. Let me take a quick shower and I\u2019ll be right down.\u201d</p><p>The door closes and the sound of her boots click on the tile floor.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s hot,\u201d Kale says.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re such an ass**le.\u201d</p><p>He raises his hands in the air. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cForget it,\u201d I say, and pull the door leading to the locker room. \u201cYou\u2019re just hopeless.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did I do?\u201d he calls back.</p><p>I just ignore him.</p><p>\u201cHey, why do you call that Kaye chick Kimberly?\u201d</p><p>Again I ignore him and turn the water on, shower, and get dressed.</p><p>Curiosity has gotten the better of me. Dahlia couldn\u2019t possibly be here to talk about S\u2019belle, could she? I\u2019m pretty sure that even if we\u2019ve moved past our issues, that would still be one very uncomfortable conversation. We\u2019ve only seen each other one time since she bailed me out of jail and helped me find my way to the path I\u2019m on today. One where my life doesn\u2019t center on booze and chicks, but rather on working hard and trying to make something of myself.</p><p>The elevator door dings and, glancing around the lobby, I see her outside sitting on a bench with her face lifted toward the sun. She looks the same as she always does. Her blond hair hangs long, her denim jeans are tucked in her boots, she has on a concert T-shirt and a leather jacket. There\u2019s so much history between us, and when I see her like now, carefree and happy, it reminds me of all we shared. Sometimes I forget she was my best friend for so many years. It\u2019s times like now that I miss that\u2014just being able to talk to her.</p><p>\u201cHey, what\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>She lowers her head and pulls her sunglasses onto her face. \u201cI want to talk to you about Bell.\u201d</p><p>My stomach drops. So that is what she\u2019s here to talk about. Fuck me if this conversation isn\u2019t going to make me squirm. Even though the romantic feelings are gone between us, the fact that I cheated on her has to sting. I know it makes me feel like a real ass**le.</p><p>I straighten my stance and fix my gaze anywhere but on her.</p><p>\u201cBen, don\u2019t be nervous. Come on, let me buy you a cup of coffee,\u201d she says, standing up.</p><p>\u201cYou mean let me buy you a cup?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome things never change.\u201d</p><p>I grin at her. I don\u2019t care if I have ten cents or ten dollars in my pocket, I\u2019d never let a girl pay\u2014ever. Starbucks is only a few buildings over in the Commons and the line is fairly short. I grab our coffees and once she fixes hers with cream we sit outside.</p><p>I take a sip of mine. \u201cSucks that Jagger had to pull out of the movie. Had they started filming yet?\u201d</p><p>She holds her cup with both hands. \u201cNo, there was some kind of production delay. But I guess Aerie had a suggestion for a lead replacement and the director is meeting with him today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? Who?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you know the guy that plays guitar for Ivy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis name is Leif Morgan and Aerie and Jagger both think he is a shoo-in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm . . . sounds like a good plan.\u201d I tap my fingers on the table. \u201cSo, what exactly do you want to talk to me about?\u201d</p><p>She blows on her coffee before slurping a small amount so it won\u2019t spill. Her eyes lift toward me. \u201cThis isn\u2019t really any of my business, but I\u2019m pretty sure I know how you\u2019re feeling.\u201d</p><p>I take a deep breath. \u201cAbout?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBell. I talked to her this morning and she told me the two of you started seeing each other. And she also told me about what happened last week.\u201d</p><p>I stare at her for a moment. No need to beat around the bush. \u201cSo you already knew? About the baby, I mean.\u201d</p><p>Seconds of silence elapse. \u201cYes.\u201d She removes the lid from her cup and then looks back up. \u201cI found out the day she told me about the two of you.\u201d</p><p>My mouth forms a thin line as I try to control the anger rising up in my throat. \u201cAnd what, you didn\u2019t think I had a right to know either?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBen, it wasn\u2019t my place to tell you.\u201d</p><p>I narrow my eyes at her. \u201cNo, I guess not. It seems it wasn\u2019t anyone\u2019s place.\u201d I stress the word anyone.</p><p>She ignores my tone, but then again she always was good at doing that. \u201cDid you know Bell was in a really bad accident shortly after she found out she was pregnant?\u201d</p><p>I shake my head no.</p><p>\u201cShe was. The girl, Stacy, who was driving was killed and Bell was in the hospital for six months. She actually didn\u2019t leave until after she gave birth.\u201d</p><p>The words gave birth seize my attention, and any questions I might have had catch in my throat. I\u2019ve been thinking of nothing but my child for the past week. She searches my face for any reaction, but I don\u2019t have one. I\u2019m trying to process what she just said and I get lost in her words while attempting to work through the events in my head. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Dahlia leans forward. \u201cBen?\u201d</p><p>I snap out of it. \u201cWhen did she get in the accident?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was Halloween night our senior year.\u201d</p><p>I swallow. \u201cThe night you went out with Aerie and came back to the frat house early.\u201d It\u2019s not a question.</p> <p>She nods. She\u2019s already figured it out. That was the night I was supposed to meet S\u2019belle but couldn\u2019t go because Dahlia ended up at the fraternity party instead of having a girls\u2019 night.</p><p>I push up from the table.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d</p><p>I look down at her. \u201cI don\u2019t think I can sit here and talk to you about this. It doesn\u2019t feel right.\u201d</p><p>She stands up and grabs my elbow. \u201cBen, sit down. Please. I\u2019m not finished.\u201d</p> <p>I inhale a huge breath and glance around and then at her. The look in her eyes is stern but also full of concern and I decide to lower myself back down. When I do the steel toe of my boot starts tapping the floor so fast my thigh hits the table and I can see the black liquid inside my coffee cup swirl.</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t easy for me either, but I\u2019m here because I know you. I know how much learning about the baby must have bothered you.\u201d Her voice trembles.</p><p>I suddenly feel a swell of emotion for her. The fact that she lost a baby just a few months ago must weigh heavy on her mind with the conversation we\u2019re having. \u201cDahlia,\u201d I say, pausing. I reach across the table and give her hand a soft squeeze and quickly retreat. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>She shakes her head and her hair tumbles around her face. Her lips form a smile that isn\u2019t the least bit reflected in her eyes. I don\u2019t have to finish. She knows what I mean.</p><p>\u201cI want to ask you something,\u201d she says, her voice gaining strength and clarity.</p><p>I cut my gaze to hers and nod.</p> <p>She stares at me, holding my attention. \u201cWhat would you have done if she\u2019d told you? Back then, I mean.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s a question I\u2019ve asked myself. I put my elbows on the table and cradle my head in my hands. Then lifting my eyes toward her, I answer with all I have inside me, \u201cI honestly don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>The summer heat wave is over, but the brush fires seem even more stoked by the Santa Anas. Hot and dry, the winds wrap themselves around the Southern California coastline as I ride along knowing where I\u2019ll end up but not quite ready to seek the answers to the questions I\u2019ve asked myself over and over. The sweeping air picks up speed as I push through the narrow canyon passes, and the unusually warm temperature reminds me of a short story I read in college. Raymond Chandler described the \u201cdevil winds\u201d in \u201cRed Wind\u201d in the most eerie way. He wrote:</p><p>There was a desert wind blowing that night. It was one of those hot, dry Santa Anas that would come down through the mountain passes and curl your hair and make your nerves jump and your skin itch. On nights like that every booze party ends in a fight. Meek little wives feel the edge of the carving knife and study their husbands\u2019 necks. Anything can happen.</p><p>I furrow my brow thinking, Anything could have happened. Anything can happen. Despite the warm temperatures, a chill chases up my spine and then back down as I try to determine what I would have done if S\u2019belle had told me she was pregnant. Would I have been a dick? I\u2019d like to think I wouldn\u2019t have. Would I even have believed her? I\u2019d like to think so, that I would have done the right thing, but the more I think about it, the more I know it\u2019s a question I will never be able to answer with any absolute certainty\u2014but I do know with absolute certainty that I still want her.</p><p>CHAPTER 24</p><p>Say Something</p> <p>Bell</p><p>Even though it\u2019s only eight in the evening, I feel completely drained. I just want to tuck my thoughts away deep down where I had them stored for so long. I cradle my arms around myself as the clouds gather in the sky and the temperature begins to drop, and I think tomorrow has to be a better day. However, as soon as my foot hits the top step of my building and I look toward my door, I want to run back to my car. He\u2019s sitting on the ground with his forehead resting on his knees. The hood of his sweatshirt beneath his leather jacket is pulled up over his head, but I know it\u2019s him. Once I\u2019m practically standing in front of him, his head pops up. He looks worn, tired, and the glow in his blue eyes seems diminished.</p><p>I know that I\u2019m to blame for that. I cast this spell of pain over the both of us and I know we\u2019ll be chained to it forever. For us the only answer is to go our separate ways\u2014I figured that out the minute he left me standing outside Pebbles and ran to some other woman.</p><p>He rises and shoves his hands in his pockets.</p><p>The pull he has over me is still stronger than ever. All I want to do is throw my arms around him and cry with him for the child we made together but will never know.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d he says, his voice low and cautious.</p><p>I try to speak but can\u2019t. Emotion is so thick in my throat that I don\u2019t even look at him, because the threat of my turmoil spilling out in a waterfall of emotions is too great. I slide my key in the lock and walk inside, leaving him standing there. But I don\u2019t close the door. I leave it open, silently inviting him in.</p><p>He enters and shuts the door behind him. \u201cI think we should talk.\u201d</p><p>My heart pounds loudly in my chest as fear rips through me. I\u2019m not even completely sure what I\u2019m afraid of\u2014maybe that he\u2019ll tell me what he thinks or maybe that he won\u2019t. I pat my wild mass of curls that I know looks like a mess and drop my purse to the floor. I keep my eyes trained to the floor and my back to him.</p><p>\u201cWhat exactly do we have left to . . .\u201d I don\u2019t finish the sentence. I can\u2019t. I know what he wants to talk about\u2014the baby, of course.</p><p>He steps behind me. His breath blows in my hair. \u201cLook. I\u2019m sorry I acted like an ass**le the other night.\u201d</p><p>I sigh heavily. \u201cIt was a week ago,\u201d I say, the tears leaking from my eyes.</p><p>\u201cTime is all convoluted right now. I\u2019m sorry. But I\u2019m here now and I want to know everything you wanted to tell me last week.\u201d His hands grip my hips.</p><p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t,\u201d I say, kicking my shoes off and heading toward the kitchen to put some physical space between us.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t what?\u201d he asks, sounding genuinely confused.</p><p>I stop at the counter and use it for support. I finally summon the courage to look at him again. Oh God, the look in his face makes me ache to soothe his pain, but my own pain is too great. \u201cDon\u2019t touch me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cS\u2019belle,\u201d he says, moving toward me.</p><p>I put my hand out. \u201cDon\u2019t call me that anymore.\u201d I muster up all the courage I have. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you what you want to know, and then you need to leave for good.\u201d</p><p>He stares at me and an array of emotions crosses his face, but I think he settles on anger. Good. That\u2019s easiest to deal with.</p><p>\u201cI want to know what happened,\u201d he says again. This time his voice is sterner; the edge of kindness is gone.</p><p>\u201cWhat? In a nice little package?\u201d I echo his anger because it will be easier for him to leave if we\u2019re both upset at each other\u2014and that is what has to take place. It\u2019s best for both of us.</p><p>He furrows his brow. \u201cNo, just like it happened.\u201d</p><p>I open the refrigerator and take out an already uncorked bottle of wine and set it on the counter. I opened it last Saturday night but never drank any of it. I take a glass from the cupboard and pour a glass. I turn toward him. \u201cDo you want some?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. And I thought you didn\u2019t drink,\u201d he barks.</p><p>I shrug. \u201cI didn\u2019t say I don\u2019t drink. I said it\u2019s better if I don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why are you now?\u201d This time his voice is compounded with compassion.</p><p>His concern starts to break me down, but I need to keep that wall up. I slam the bottle on the counter and turn toward him, allowing my eyes to meet his for the first time tonight. \u201cLook, Ben, what do you want to know? Where the baby is? Because I don\u2019t f**king know.\u201d</p><p>His shoulders visibly shake and his eyes widen. I feel a tug at my heart. I\u2019ve never sworn in front of him, but it\u2019s necessary to get my point across\u2014that we cannot be together. He continues to stare at me, this time with confusion clear on his face, as I cross the room to the couch, averting my eyes when I can\u2019t stand it any longer.</p><p>\u201cI just want to understand everything a little better.\u201d</p><p>He lowers himself on the couch but keeps a safe distance. My eyes cut to the Huck Finn book on the coffee table with the bookmark sticking out at about the halfway point, and I notice he does the same. I hesitate a moment and then reach to set my phone and my glass down, drawing his attention away from the book. I pull my feet up and twist my head to look at him, resting my chin on my knees. I search deep in my soul and start by asking him a question. \u201cHave you ever been the reason someone died?\u201d</p><p>He bows his head and drags his hand down his face as though pained by my question. Silence hangs in the air for one, maybe two long moments. \u201cYes. When my mother had her stroke last year, I blamed myself for her death. I felt responsible.\u201d</p><p>More tears slip from my eyes and I will them to stop. We stare at each other, and the small distance between us suddenly seems like miles. I want him to wrap his arms around me and hold me forever, tell me I made the right choice, the choice that was best for the child with a whole life in front of it, but I shake those thoughts away. That\u2019s not what will happen. It can\u2019t happen. Being together will only end in blame, and I can\u2019t bear that cross. I blink my momentary lapse of misjudgment away. \u201cWell, then, you must know it changes your mind-set. You do things you might not normally do. . . . You make decisions that you might have made differently if you had been in a different state of mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I know that well. Too well,\u201d he answers, dropping his elbows to his knees.</p><p>His forthright honesty makes me suck in a shuddering breath. Blowing it out, I keep telling him what I\u2019ve held inside for so long. \u201cBy the time I had the baby I was in such a bad place I couldn\u2019t imagine raising a child. I didn\u2019t even want to get out of bed. How could I take care of a baby? I told my family I didn\u2019t want the responsibility, but really the pain of what I\u2019d done shadowed any good I thought I had left inside me.\u201d My voice cracks on the admission and I have to look away from him.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened? Tell me what happened,\u201d he pleads. His own voice sounds pained.</p><p>My mind slips back to that distant place. \u201cIt was Halloween and you had told me you\u2019d meet me at my apartment around twelve. My brother was in town, so I went to watch him sing. He drove me. He always did. That night my friend Stacy was there and she was after him, but by the end of intermission it was clear he wasn\u2019t interested in her. I wasn\u2019t paying much attention to what she was doing. I was listening to the band. When the night ended I wanted to get home.\u201d I look at him pensively. \u201cWell, my brother wasn\u2019t ready. I knew he\u2019d be there for a while, so I begged Stacy to take me home. She was upset over him anyway, so I said we\u2019d talk about it in the car. And . . .\u201d I take a deep breath and more tears fall from my eyes. \u201cI\u2019m not sure what happened, but a semi blew a light and hit us. You see, I made her drive me home so I could see you. I wanted to tell you I was pregnant. And her death was my fault.\u201d</p><p>He shakes his head. \u201cNo, Bell, it was the driver who blew the light. Not yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo everyone says.\u201d</p><p>He shifts his eyes but leaves his elbows on his knees. At that angle I catch his face in profile. I can see its flaws, the way his nose has a bump on it that looks as if it might have been broken once, his hair so messy that it covers his ears, the stubble on his jawline as though he hasn\u2019t shaved in a few days, but to me those flaws make him even more attractive. I try to stop myself from falling, from faltering as his mind works and he pieces the events of the past together. I can see it happening before me but can\u2019t stop it now that I started it. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>When he asks, \u201cWas your brother unable to take you home because he was with Dahlia?\u201d I pick myself up immediately. There\u2019s the elephant in the room that we\u2019ve only briefly touched on. I swat my tears away and stare in disbelief at him. The anger that rears this time is real, genuine, and I don\u2019t have to fake it.</p><p>\u201cNever mind, it\u2019s not important. What happened after that?\u201d he asks, but it\u2019s too late. My wall is already back up.</p><p>I purse my lips at him. \u201cDid you even show up that night? Did you go to my apartment like you said you would?\u201d</p><p>He sits up and wipes his palms on his jeans. His eyes cut over to the book on my coffee table. The book he gave me because it\u2019s his favorite. The book he remembered he was reading the first time we met.</p> <p>I take his lack of response to mean no, he didn\u2019t show up. \u201cWhat would you have done had I told you?\u201d</p><p>He swallows, working his throat.</p><p>My phone rings, interrupting this painful admission of guilt, and I seize the opportunity to put an end to the conversation when I see Tate\u2019s name flash across the screen. I reach to answer it, but he grabs my wrist.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to answer that in the middle of this?\u201d</p><p>I take a deep breath, then another one. My pulse is racing. \u201cIt might be important.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThis is important!\u201d he seethes, letting go of my wrist.</p><p>I let it ring.</p><p>Suddenly his eyes grow dark and his gaze sharp. \u201cYou\u2019re f**king him, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>His question temporarily stuns me, but I quickly scramble to my feet, needing more distance from him. But even the distance can\u2019t contain my hurt. He thinks I\u2019m the one screwing someone? Well, let him. That will work. I know how it feels. With my eyes narrowing at him I yell, \u201cWhy do you care!\u201d and a rage flames inside me as I consciously decide to keep silent.</p><p>He too rises and moves closer to me. His fingers curl around my upper arms and I blink rapidly, standing frozen in place\u2014love, lust, want, need, and even fear make my stomach tighten and my chest constrict.</p><p>His body stiffens and his grip tightens. \u201cYou know why I care.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo! No, I don\u2019t! What I know is that you will always do what\u2019s best for you!\u201d</p><p>He drops his hold on me as he stares in stunned silence.</p><p>But I said what I believe to be true. I finally admitted it out loud. It\u2019s why I kept my distance for as long as I did. He\u2019s proven to me time and time again that he makes the decisions that are best for him and him alone. He could have tried to find me after that first night we spent together\u2014but he didn\u2019t because he had a girlfriend. When he saw me at River\u2019s house that first time\u2014he could have come after me, but he went after Dahlia because that was what was best for him. Then this past summer when I realized he messed around with someone\u2014it wasn\u2019t morals that drove my anger but rather the lack of persistence to prove he was interested in me. And just last week when I told him I gave our baby up\u2014he left me at the restaurant because it was best for him.</p><p>I look away from his powerful stare, afraid of what I might see if I look any longer. \u201cDo you have anything else you want to know? Because if not I think we\u2019re done.\u201d</p><p>I dare to look up when he fails to answer, and the stricken look on his face is enough to make me avert my gaze again.</p><p>\u201cWas the baby a boy or a girl?\u201d he asks softly.</p><p>I cross my arms over my chest in a hopeless effort to protect my heart. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d I whisper.</p><p>My phone rings again and this time I scurry toward it. To put an end to both our pain I answer, \u201cHello.\u201d</p> <p>My eyes searching the floor, I spot his boots turn and I watch him go. He stops for a moment at the door.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here,\u201d I say into the phone.</p><p>The door slams and I jump. And as I strain to hear him pound down the concrete stairs, I feel my heart shrink just a little bit more as tears scald first my cheeks, then my neck, and finally my chest.</p><p>CHAPTER 25</p><p>Losing Sleep</p><p>Ben</p><p>Waking up on Thanksgiving morning to the smell of pumpkin bread baking in the oven reminds me so much of my mother. An aromatic wake-up call, the scent is enough to lure me from my old bedroom and out to the kitchen. I pad across the room and pour a cup of coffee that smells recently brewed. Standing at the large picture window in the kitchen, I stare out at the waves crashing against the rocks. Weeks have passed since I\u2019ve seen S\u2019belle, but I can\u2019t stop considering how different things might have been if Dahlia had stayed at the bar that night. And truth be told, I think that had I known about the baby I would never have let her give it up for adoption. But our issues run deeper than just our painful past\u2014she proved that.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re awake,\u201d Serena says, entering the room.</p><p>\u201cHow could I not be?\u201d I grin over at her.</p><p>She pulls the loaves of bread from the oven. \u201cDid the wafting smell of cinnamon wake you up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope you added extra cinnamon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. Just like Mom.\u201d She grins.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s strange, being here on Thanksgiving without her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, it is. I really miss her.\u201d</p><p>I turn back toward the window and sip from my cup. \u201cSo do I.\u201d</p><p>Serena and Jason both sold their own places and decided to make Mom\u2019s house their new home. Trent was home from college and Caleb was supposed to arrive in town last night but had a flight delay. My sister had insisted I spend the night with them since today was a holiday. Trent arrived home last Sunday and has alternated staying with me and staying here.</p><p>With Aerie gone from the office, I\u2019ve been extremely busy at work and although she\u2019s doing what she can remotely, there is some on-site work to be done. Well, maybe there isn\u2019t, but I\u2019ve volunteered to take it on nonetheless to keep myself busy. But with Trent\u2019s arrival I actually took the week off. We\u2019ve surfed, gone to the movies, and hung around talking about how college life is treating him. He really loves it.</p><p>\u201cCaleb called. He\u2019s on his way from the airport,\u201d Serena tells me.</p><p>I turn. \u201cGreat f**king news.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s great f**king news?\u201d Trent asks, standing shirtless in the doorway.</p><p>Serena shoots me a glare.</p><p>I shrug.</p><p>\u201cUncle Caleb will be here soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, cool,\u201d Trent says, then turns to me. \u201cWant to hit the point?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure, just let me finish my coffee.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll pack the shit in the car.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrent! Cut the swearing now. I mean it.\u201d</p><p>He rolls his eyes. \u201cI\u2019ll put the stuff in the car,\u201d he corrects himself.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you looking at me like that?\u201d I ask Serena.</p><p>She walks closer to me. \u201cFirst time I\u2019ve seen you laugh in a while. That\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? I hadn\u2019t noticed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I have.\u201d</p><p>I sidestep her and place my cup in the sink. \u201cWe\u2019re off. Will you be okay?\u201d</p><p>She laughs. \u201cLike the two of you would be any help anyway?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, I help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo have fun.\u201d</p><p>I salute her. \u201cIf you insist.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s a short drive to the beach and before I know it I\u2019ve found some peace on the water. Surfing has always helped me rid my mind of everything. Time flies and I\u2019m glad we hit the waves, but it\u2019s time to get back. The ocean shimmers in the distance as the clouds move toward us. From where we stand stripping off our wet suits, the sky is bright with the afternoon sunshine casting upon us. A sun shower has already left its marks in the sand, but the tide is picking up in an indication that downpours are imminent.</p><p>\u201cCome on, the storm is coming,\u201d Trent says.</p><p>I smirk at him. \u201cAre you afraid of a little thunder and lightning?\u201d</p><p>Trent turns, rolling his eyes. \u201cFuck no. It\u2019s just Mom will be calling every five minutes if we\u2019re not home before it starts.\u201d</p><p>I swing my arm around him. \u201cThat\u2019s sweet that you\u2019re concerned for your mother.\u201d</p><p>He snorts, shrugging out of my hold. \u201cYou were always concerned about Grandma too. And you wouldn\u2019t have wanted her on your case for not calling.\u201d</p><p>I catch his eye. \u201cYeah. Yeah, I was.\u201d</p><p>I let Trent drive home and just stare out the window. As we pull onto the gravel of the driveway, the tires spin. My head snaps to Trent. \u201cHey, watch it.\u201d</p><p>He grins. \u201cI love this car. It\u2019s the shit. And you know, you really need to let me ride your bike.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo f**king way. Your mother will kill me.\u201d</p><p>He rolls his eyes. \u201cI call car duty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a little shit.\u201d</p><p>He shrugs.</p><p>I carry the boards around back to the deck as Trent unloads the gear.</p><p>\u201cHey, man, how the f**k are you?\u201d Caleb calls over the railing.</p><p>I toss the boards on the sand as he rushes for me and we collapse into a flurry of backslapping.</p><p>\u201cFuck me, you made it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI sure did. And not just for a day. The week.\u201d</p><p>I slant him a look. \u201cA week?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I think so,\u201d he says with a cocky grin.</p><p>\u201cFucking awesome. Where are you staying?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was hoping I wouldn\u2019t have to crash with the newlyweds,\u201d he says with a laugh.</p><p>\u201cSo, are you asking to stay with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I was hoping . . .\u201d</p><p>I save him from groveling and push him into the sand. A headlock, a few rolls, and sand sticking to us everywhere don\u2019t stop us, but my sister\u2019s voice makes us freeze.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell are you doing?\u201d she calls from the top of the steps.</p><p>I rush to my feet.</p><p>Caleb one-ups me and rushes toward her. \u201cNeed help, Serena?\u201d</p><p>She narrows her eyes at him. He shrugs. \u201cFucker jumped me.\u201d</p><p>She sighs in deep exasperation and turns on her heel.</p><p>I catch up to Caleb. \u201cJust a little piece of advice, f**ker. Keep the swearing to a minimum around my sister. Trent\u2019s picked up the same nasty habit and Serena is not happy about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could have warned me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen? Between you begging me for a place to stay and using all your new fancy moves to beat the shit out of me?\u201d</p><p>His grin widens. \u201cI did learn some cool shit.\u201d</p><p>I shove him up the stairs. \u201cYou\u2019d better have time to teach me how to kick your ass, then.\u201d</p><p>An hour later the table has been set, the game is on, and Caleb, Trent, and I are sacked out watching it. I look up and see Serena gazing around the room with a peaceful look on her face.</p><p>\u201cWant some help?\u201d I ask her.</p><p>\u201cSuck-up,\u201d Caleb mutters quietly enough that my sister can\u2019t hear.</p><p>\u201cCould you help me bring out the food? Jason\u2019s busy trying to find the carving knife.\u201d</p><p>Trent clears his throat. \u201cThe one with the black-and-silver handle?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Serena answers, casting her piercing gaze his way.</p><p>\u201cLet me help Dad with that.\u201d He glares at me.</p><p>She looks at him.</p><p>He points to me.</p><p>I shrug. \u201cWe had to clean some fish the other day before we cooked them over the open fire.\u201d</p><p>Surprisingly she laughs. \u201cI like having everyone home.\u201d</p><p>I give her a smile, happy to be here but feeling as if a piece of me is missing. I\u2019m just not sure what piece.</p><p>During dinner we all eat as if we haven\u2019t eaten in years, and before I know it the sun is setting and I\u2019m ready to head home, stuffed with turkey, mashed potatoes, cranberries, and apple pie. Serena hands me a bag to take home.</p><p>\u201cHold on, I forgot the pumpkin bread,\u201d she says, hurrying toward the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m coming with you, Uncle Ben. Hold up for me,\u201d Trent says from the top of the stairs. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou sure? I think your parents might want you to spend the night here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m ready to scrub my eyes out from all the kissing going on in the kitchen earlier. I have to get out of here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFair enough. Let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>Three hours later we\u2019re at my house with Trent sacked out on the couch and Caleb and me flipping through the channels.</p> <p>\u201cLet\u2019s get out of here,\u201d he says.</p><p>\u201cNah. I don\u2019t feel like it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I do. I haven\u2019t gotten laid in months. The no-fraternization policy is killing me.\u201d</p><p>I bow my head and drag my hands down my face, feeling exhausted.</p><p>\u201cHey, what\u2019s going on with you? I noticed when I was home in October you weren\u2019t drinking and that today water bottles replaced beer bottles. What have I missed?\u201d</p> <p>I mute the television and then spill everything I neglected to tell him whenever we talked on the phone. The picture of a playboy fantasy life I had painted was far from reality. I had told him Dahlia and I were talking, I just didn\u2019t tell him how it happened\u2014that she had to bail me out of jail. While I was at it I went ahead and told him about Bell, the baby, and how I walked out on her\u2014twice. The second time because I figured out she was f**king her boss when she wasn\u2019t f**king me.</p><p>He slumps back on the chair and runs his hands through his hair. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, man. You should have told me. What are you going to do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing. Move on. What else can I do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeems like you care about her,\u201d</p><p>I hiss a breath through my teeth and shrug.</p><p>\u201cYou could go after her, you know?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSloppy seconds aren\u2019t my style.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you, Danny Zukko?\u201d</p><p>I raise an eyebrow. \u201cYou think I\u2019m quoting Grease?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I do. What are you going to do about it?\u201d</p><p>I lunge at him and this time when we wrestle on the floor I emerge the clear winner. I head to bed as he makes his way to the door and I call out, \u201cI don\u2019t need to learn your fancy martial arts moves to whip your ass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI let you win,\u201d he says under his breath.</p><p>\u201cFuck you,\u201d I call.</p><p>He turns and grins. \u201cLove you too, brother.\u201d</p> <p>I leave Trent where he is and take the steps two at a time, thinking about what Caleb said about S\u2019belle. I fall asleep with her on my mind just as I have done every night since I saw her across the ballroom.</p><p>My phone rings before I\u2019m even fully awake. \u201cYeah, this better be good,\u201d I answer without even looking at who it is.</p><p>\u201cBen!\u201d</p><p>I sit up. \u201cBeck?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry to wake you, man, but we have a problem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d I flop back on my pillow while I\u2019m checking the time\u2014nine forty-five a.m. Fuck, it\u2019s late. I never sleep this late.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a glitch in sending January\u2019s issue of Surfer\u2019s End to publication.\u201d</p><p>Cradling the phone to my ear, I scrub my face. \u201cDid you call the systems analyst?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t reach Eric.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAny idea what\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt has to be the new encryption program Australia sent us when we went live last month.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck! I\u2019ll be right in.\u201d</p><p>I hop out of bed and take a quick shower. When I head downstairs it\u2019s quiet. There\u2019s a note from Trent saying he went to have lunch with Dahlia, and it looks as though Caleb never came home. I rush around looking for my keys and accidentally knock Caleb\u2019s backpack off the coffee table. The contents spill and I spot it immediately\u2014the flash drive I gave him over a year ago. The same one he supposedly gave to Agent Bass during the drug cartel trial that the detectives said had a phone-book directory on it. I pick it up along with everything else but shove the drive in my jeans pocket before running out the door.</p><p>Traffic is light and I make it to the office in record time. When I reach Beck\u2019s door, I can see Eric Ryan sitting at the desk with Beck hovering over him.</p><p>\u201cWell?\u201d I ask.</p><p>They both turn their attention to me.</p><p>\u201cFound Eric.\u201d Beck grins.</p><p>Eric drops his gaze and pounds the keyboard ferociously.</p><p>\u201cI see that. And?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have the syntax corrected as soon as I can concentrate,\u201d Eric mutters, his baseball cap blocking any view of his face.</p><p>\u201cSo, is it going or what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShould be sent within the hour. Minor delay. Sorry I called you in,\u201d Beck answers.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to grab a coffee. I\u2019ll be back in a few.\u201d Neither one of them acknowledges me.</p><p>When I enter the break room, Ruby is sitting at the table reading on her iPad.</p><p>\u201cAnything good?\u201d I ask her.</p><p>She looks up. \u201cJust the latest on government health care and fiscal crisis.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo early in the morning,\u201d I joke.</p><p>I grab the pot and tip it toward her. \u201cWant a cup?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019ve had a few.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat hour did Beck drag you in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was supposed to be a two-minute stop over two hours ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I think it\u2019s under control now, so hopefully not much longer. Got plans? Christmas shopping?\u201d</p><p>She laughs. \u201cI wish. Actually we\u2019re going to visit my parents.\u201d</p><p>I nod.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been meaning to call you,\u201d she says. \u201cI went to the address I had for my birth mother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh yeah. Did you meet her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I changed my mind once I got there. I decided I am happy with the life I have. She gave me up for a reason, and honestly not knowing just seems better than knowing now.\u201d</p><p>I nod again. Not sure of what to say.</p><p>\u201cI love my parents. I don\u2019t need any other parental figures in my life. They\u2019re enough.\u201d</p><p>I stare at her for the longest time and it suddenly hits me\u2014I have to believe that my child, S\u2019belle\u2019s and my child, is just as happy with his or her life as Ruby is with hers. I have to let that go.</p><p>\u201cHey, man, Eric is a wizard. Whatever you pay him he\u2019s well worth it,\u201d Beck announces as he enters the room.</p><p>\u201cYou dragged my ass in here on a day off to tell me my computer engineer came from Oz?\u201d I smile at him.</p><p>\u201cSomething like that.\u201d</p><p>I grab my coffee and clap him on the shoulder. \u201cNow get out of here. I\u2019ll talk to you later.\u201d</p><p>I head to my office, figuring while I\u2019m here I might as well get some work done. But after an hour or so I head back home. When I arrive home at two p.m., Caleb\u2019s car is here, so I can ask him about the flash drive that looks suspiciously like the one I gave to him. I\u2019m glancing up just as Trent begins to pull in, but then he slams on the brakes and backs up, opting to park off to the side of the road rather than in the driveway. He rushes out of what used to be my car\u2014my beloved BMW M5 Touring. Dahlia had given it to him and there was no way I could take it back.</p><p>\u201cHey, Uncle Ben, I need to talk to you,\u201d he huffs, bending down to catch his breath.</p><p>I raise an eyebrow. \u201cWhat\u2019s so important that you\u2019re running, kid?\u201d</p><p>The wind shifts direction as he swipes the back of his hand over his forehead. \u201cI had lunch with Dahlia today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, so you told me in your note.\u201d I motion toward the house and walk toward the door.</p><p>When we reach the garage I turn toward him.</p><p>\u201cNow, don\u2019t be pissed,\u201d he says.</p><p>My eyes narrow on him. \u201cCome on, let\u2019s go in.\u201d</p><p>I open the unlocked door and we both walk in. As we enter the family room, my attention turns to Caleb sacked out on the couch with a few containers of Chinese food scattered on the floor and the coffee table, but I quickly turn my attention back to Trent. \u201cGo on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I mentioned to Dahlia that you thought the girl you like is f**king someone else.\u201d</p><p>I stare openmouthed at him. This is the first time his mouth has caught me off guard. \u201cYou did what?\u201d</p><p>He repeats himself and Caleb bolts upright.</p><p>I flop down on the couch and rub my palms on my jeans. \u201cI heard you.\u201d</p><p>Trent picks up one of the take-out boxes and a pair of chopsticks and slurps some noodles in his mouth.</p><p>\u201cFirst of all, why the f**k didn\u2019t you tell me you were awake? And second, why would you say anything to Dahlia?\u201d</p><p>He shrugs and settles into one of the oversized chairs across from the sofa. \u201cI wasn\u2019t asleep last night when you were talking to Uncle Caleb and I heard you telling him about Dahlia\u2019s sister-in-law. You sounded a little desperate.\u201d</p><p>I squeeze my eyes shut. Fuck, f**k, f**k. \u201cSo you heard everything?\u201d</p><p>I chance a glance at Caleb, who\u2019s sitting there with a blank look on his face\u2014red eyes, messy hair, and obviously very hungover.</p><p>\u201cHey, Trent, what you heard, I\u2019m not like that anymore.\u201d</p><p>He laughs. \u201cI know that. And, Uncle Ben, I\u2019m not twelve. I get we all make mistakes. Come on, you of all people know I get that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a pretty smart kid,\u201d Caleb finally chimes in.</p><p>I shoot daggers his way.</p><p>\u201cSo, do you want to hear what I have to tell you or lecture me on how not to behave?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKeep being a smart-ass and I\u2019ll call your mother,\u201d I threaten.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take the lecture,\u201d he jokes, biting into an eggroll.</p><p>I run my hands through my hair. \u201cOkay, what did she have to say?\u201d</p><p>He grins. \u201cThat the guy you were talking about is a complete douche bag.\u201d</p><p>My eyes widen in disbelief. \u201cDahlia called him that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, no, she called him an ass**le.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnyway, that douche bag still has the hots for her. I guess she dated him for like a month almost a year ago. Dahlia thinks he keeps coming on to her. And don\u2019t worry, I didn\u2019t tell Dahlia you were heartbroken or anything.\u201d</p><p>I ignore his smart-ass comment. I already knew Bell had dated Tate. Fuck me, obviously I was letting my anger about the baby impact my reaction. But why didn\u2019t she correct me? I guess because I was being just as big a douche as her ass**le boss. Wanting to hear her voice, to talk to her, I pull my phone from my pocket. When she doesn\u2019t answer I send her a text.</p><p>Where are you?</p><p>Her reply is immediate.</p><p>I\u2019m at work.</p><p>I need to talk to you.</p><p>She doesn\u2019t reply this time.</p><p>\u201cWell?\u201d Caleb and Trent say at the same time.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s at work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, go get her,\u201d Trent says.</p><p>I look at him, exasperated. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a movie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I thought you were Danny Zukko,\u201d he says, laughing.</p><p>Caleb laughs too and they both are almost crying in a matter of moments.</p><p>I leave the ass**les sitting here and stride into the kitchen. Today is the day after Thanksgiving and I remember her telling me something about where she\u2019d be.</p><p>\u201cYou know, I think you\u2019re actually over her?\u201d Caleb says as he\u2019s tossing a few containers in the trash.</p><p>Distracted by trying to remember where Bell had said she\u2019d be, I look at him quizzically. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDahlia\u2014I never thought you would get over her. But you call her Dahlia now. And there\u2019s no spark in your eyes when her name is mentioned.\u201d</p><p>I hadn\u2019t noticed that before but knew I had gotten over everything as best I could a while ago.</p><p>\u201cHey, Uncle Ben, I\u2019m serious as shit. I think you should go after that girl,\u201d Trent chimes in.</p><p>\u201cYou know what, I have to say I agree with the kid,\u201d Caleb says.</p><p>I open the refrigerator and grab a water bottle and toss one to him. \u201cHere, man, you need this. You look like shit.\u201d</p><p>He runs his fingers through his already disheveled hair. \u201cI feel like it too.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Ignoring the fact that Caleb and I are having a completely different conversation, Trent pulls us back to the previous one. \u201cWhere does she work?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s an event planner. I know she\u2019s been coordinating that ass**le Romeo Fairchild\u2019s wedding. But I have no idea where it is.\u201d</p><p>Trent turns on his heel and leaves the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d I call to him.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re the investigator. You figure it out.\u201d</p><p>I follow him into my office. \u201cDon\u2019t be a smart-ass.\u201d</p><p>He sits in front of the computer, taps a few keys, and then looks up. \u201cBingo! It\u2019s breaking news. Governor\u2019s son\u2019s wedding set to take place at Adamson House canceled at last minute.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLooks like you\u2019re going to Malibu. My guess is she\u2019s still there. Last minute sounds messy to me,\u201d Caleb says, high-fiving Trent.</p><p>I glare at him. \u201cYou told me she was forbidden fruit.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah, but you weren\u2019t walking around looking like your dog just died then. You wouldn\u2019t even go out with me last night. That\u2019s unheard of. You don\u2019t have to drink to go out and have a good time. And when was the last time you got laid?\u201d</p><p>I cringe at his question. No way I am telling him that and besides, there are just some things a nephew doesn\u2019t need to know. \u201cLet\u2019s just say it\u2019s been a while.\u201d I leave it at that.</p><p>\u201cCome on, man, you\u2019re miserable. If you want her, go get her,\u201d Caleb prods.</p><p>I lean against the doorway. \u201cYou act like it\u2019s that easy. It\u2019s complicated.\u201d</p><p>Trent pipes up, \u201cIt\u2019s only as complicated as you make it.\u201d</p><p>He has a point. I did say I wanted to leave the past in the past.</p> <p>Caleb lowers himself on the corner of the desk. \u201cWhen have you ever backed away from something because it wasn\u2019t easy?\u201d</p><p>Trent pushes back in my chair. \u201cI can drive you.\u201d</p><p>I grin at him. \u201cI\u2019m a big boy. I think I can go after a girl myself.\u201d</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>The ride should be fairly short, but the worsening weather conditions are making the drive tougher. The palm trees bend from the strong winds, and the county has issued the highest wildfire threat it\u2019s seen in years. I finally spot the sign at the road that reads CALIFORNIA STATE PARK NATIONAL HISTORIC SITE. I turn in and immediately notice the wildflowers that line both sides of the narrow drive. They lead me all the way to the end, where I see a building that must be the Adamson House. I\u2019ve never been here, but I have read the book written by the original owner, Frederick H. Rindge. Happy Days in Southern California provided a detailed history of the region and it was something I had picked it up at the library last summer when I had too much time on my hands and was reading every historical book about California I could find to help cement my decision to stay here.</p><p>There are no cars here and I hope I\u2019m in the right location. Standing in front of me is a very large Mediterranean-style house with hand-carved wooden front doors. Detailed filigree ironwork covers what looks to be lead-framed bottle glass windows. I walk around the side of the building, where I catch sight of Malibu Beach as well as the lagoon and the pier\u2014it\u2019s one gorgeous view. I loop to the back and spot her car and the Tate Wyatt catering van immediately. She\u2019s here.</p><p>Excitement combines with nervous energy as I finally allow my mind to consider what the hell I\u2019m doing here and what the f**k I\u2019m going to say. All of a sudden I feel like Richard Gere from An Officer and a Gentleman, and that couldn\u2019t be any lamer. Now I need to consider my options:</p><p>1) Go home</p> <p>2) Call her</p><p>3) Text her</p><p>4) Just go the f**k in.</p><p>I decide on texting.</p><p>I\u2019m outside and I want to talk to you. So you either come out or I\u2019m coming in.</p><p>I wait for a response\u2014one minute, two, three. Fuck it, I\u2019m going in. I pull open the rusted metal door that has been painted chocolate brown in an attempt to cover up the corrosion marring it. As I step inside, a musty smell fills the air. The room is dark and I flick on the light switch. I\u2019m in a closet of some sorts that\u2019s been turned into an employee entrance with a time clock machine, a few lockers, and coat hooks. I push through the door in front of me and end up in a hallway. It\u2019s quiet and I follow it to the end, where the next door opens into the banquet area. It\u2019s partially set up with place settings, flowers, and candelabras on each of the tables, but it\u2019s also empty of any people. A number of other doors line the walls and I walk the perimeter of the large space, peering into them. They are all dark inside and I can\u2019t find her anywhere.</p><p>CHAPTER 26</p><p>Sundown</p><p>Bell</p><p>Romeo Fairchild\u2019s wedding has been canceled without any explanation and Tate and I have been cleaning up what we had already set up. The weather may have kept everyone away anyway. I\u2019ve been out in the main room for a while when he calls me into the kitchen area.</p><p>As I push through the door I notice a bottle of scotch and a glass on the work area. \u201cYou\u2019re drinking?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCelebrating is more like it.\u201d He grins at me.</p><p>\u201cThe biggest wedding we have all year cancels and you call it a celebration?\u201d I raise an eyebrow.</p><p>\u201cHe wasn\u2019t ready for marriage and neither was she. It\u2019s the best thing for the both of them.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m actually impressed with his insight.</p><p>\u201cHow much more do you have left?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m more than halfway done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPut the flowers in here,\u201d he says, holding out a bucket. \u201cI\u2019ll drop them off at my mother\u2019s nursing home. The ladies love getting flowers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s sweet of you.\u201d</p><p>Something flickers in his eyes that I can\u2019t decipher.</p><p>I reach for the bucket, and his hand catches my wrist and he yanks me to him. \u201cYou like sweet, don\u2019t you? I can give you sweet. Just give me a chance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTate, come on. We\u2019ve talked about this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, we have and I think you need to stop fighting the attraction between us.\u201d</p><p>I push at his shoulder. \u201cI think you\u2019ve had too much to drink.\u201d</p><p>I keep trying to extricate myself from his grip, but instead he cages me. I try to remain calm because I know he won\u2019t hurt me; he\u2019s just had too much to drink. \u201cTate, please move out of my way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBell, I\u2019m tired of this game,\u201d he says with a warning in his voice.</p><p>I shove at him again, this time harder. \u201cI\u2019m not playing a game. Now let me get back to work.\u201d</p><p>In an unexpected move he takes my wrists and pins them to my side, pressing himself into me. I scream from the pure shock of it.</p><p>Suddenly the door swings open and Ben is standing there wearing an anger like nothing I\u2019ve ever seen before. \u201cLet her go,\u201d he seethes.</p><p>Tate turns. \u201cWhat the f**k!\u201d he yells.</p><p>My eyes desperately seek his, trying to tell him I\u2019m okay. I can practically see the hatred pumping through his veins as though he wants to kill him. With my chest heaving and my heart pounding, I scramble toward Ben but twist my ankle and stumble to the floor, hitting my head on the corner of the counter. Ben slams into Tate, who falls back but catches his footing. Tate\u2019s eyes darken as he lunges toward Ben. He swings at him and Ben tries to duck but falls into a crate on the floor.</p><p>He yells, \u201cGet out of here, Bell.\u201d</p><p>But I can\u2019t move. I can\u2019t believe this is happening.</p><p>Tate looks down at me. \u201cIf you want to keep your job, tell this dick to get out of here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeave her alone!\u201d Ben shouts as I get to my feet.</p><p>I take a deep breath and prepare to tell Ben it\u2019s not what he thinks, but I can see he\u2019s not listening. His fists are clenched and he rams into Tate, who starts to fall to the floor, and Ben swiftly kicks him in the gut. Tate lands on the floor and Ben straddles him, ready to deliver a punch to his face.</p><p>\u201cStop, Ben! Please stop!\u201d By now I\u2019m screaming.</p><p>He cuts his eyes toward me and looks at me for a few long seconds before he moves away from Tate.</p><p>He rushes over to me. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d he asks, stroking my cheek, and I can see the blood dripping down it onto his hand.</p><p>A sob escapes my throat and I suck in a breath to stop the hysteria. My heart hammers against my rib cage when he tenderly says, \u201cShhh . . . don\u2019t cry. Shhh . . . don\u2019t cry, Bell.\u201d</p><p>I look into his blue eyes and murmur, \u201cI don\u2019t like it when you call me Bell.\u201d</p><p>In the midst of everything that\u2019s going on, a smile flits across his lips. He lifts my chin and finds my eyes. \u201cDon\u2019t cry, S\u2019belle.\u201d</p><p>I hear a rumbling from behind as Tate approaches us. \u201cYou\u2019d better get out of here before I press charges for assault,\u201d he threatens.</p><p>Ben turns ever so slightly. \u201cYou ever touch her again and I will kill you.\u201d</p><p>Tate straightens his shoulders and turns around, storming out of the room.</p><p>Ben turns back to me and pushes the hair from my face. \u201cLet me see your forehead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m okay,\u201d I whisper.</p><p>\u201cNo, you\u2019re not. You\u2019re bleeding.\u201d</p><p>He reaches for a stack of clean towels near the sink and wipes my face. \u201cYou have a gash just above your eyebrow,\u201d he says softly, and presses the towel to it.</p><p>I can see the blood soaking through it.</p><p>\u201cCome on, we\u2019re going to the emergency room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be fine. I don\u2019t have to go to the hospital.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s your stuff?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy stu-stuff . . . ,\u201d I stammer.</p><p>\u201cWhatever you brought in the building with you. Where is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn a locker in the entrance, but I can\u2019t leave. I have to finish cleaning up. I\u2019m almost done.\u201d</p><p>Applying pressure to my gash, he frowns at me. He sucks in a deep breath and squats down so that we\u2019re eye level. \u201cYou are done working for that ass**le. Do you hear me?\u201d I can tell he\u2019s controlling his tone.</p><p>\u201cI have to keep my job,\u201d I cry.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to do anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t fail at something else. I fail at everything I do.\u201d The words come out without thought.</p><p>He swallows. \u201cYou are beautiful from the inside out. Failure is never anything you have to worry about. And what happened today is just proof of that.\u201d</p><p>My eyes fill with more tears.</p><p>Pressing a kiss to the top of my head, he holds me tight to him. Once my sobs are under control, he pulls away. \u201cGive me your hand.\u201d</p><p>I just look at him in confusion.</p><p>He lifts one of my hands to where he\u2019s holding the towel. \u201cKeep this tight to your head.\u201d</p><p>I nod.</p><p>He lifts me off the floor and cradles me to him.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d I yell.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m getting you out of here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can walk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can walk faster,\u201d he says. \u201cJust hold the towel.\u201d</p><p>I band my arms around his neck.</p><p>He makes his way down the hallway and stops in the employee entrance. \u201cWhich locker?\u201d</p><p>I point. I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s my head, or what happened with Tate, or the fact that he\u2019s here, but I\u2019m feeling as though I\u2019m in shock.</p><p>He manages to open it with me still in his arms and grabs my bag and carries me to his car before setting me down.</p><p>I look up at him, a little dazed. \u201cI can\u2019t leave my car here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll send someone to get it.\u201d</p><p>When he gets in the car he pulls up his GPS and selects the nearest hospital. After watching him for a minute, I sag back against the seat and shut my eyes.</p><p>His hand squeezes mine. \u201cHey, don\u2019t fall asleep, S\u2019belle. Not that I think you have a concussion, but you never know.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I glance down at his hand and give him a slight smile.</p><p>\u201cI think I should call your mother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d</p><p>My panicked reaction seems to surprise him and he glances over to me. \u201cHey, you didn\u2019t do anything wrong.

He would have left me alone.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure of that and I don\u2019t care what it was.

Tate Wyatt has obviously been harassing her for a while even if she didn\u2019t see it. Who knows what he would have done to her tonight? The situation could have been so much worse. And I accused her of sleeping with him. I take a few more deep breaths and squeeze my eyes shut, cursing my own stupidity.</p><p>After a few moments I pull out my phone to call Trent and Caleb and ask them to pick up her car. After explaining what happened and that I tucked the key in the wheel well, I get off the phone and make my way down the hall. Jack is standing outside the door of her room. When he sees me he starts walking my way.</p><p>He claps my shoulder, the one without the bloodstains. \u201cBell told us what happened. I think she\u2019s downplaying it. What did you see?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did she tell you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe said he was drunk and that he didn\u2019t really mean anything by it.\u201d</p><p>I stare at him. Eye to eye. Man-to-man. \u201cThat could be the case. But he was being forceful with her and she was trying to shove him back.\u201d I can feel my stomach lurching.</p><p>His face heats in anger. \u201cOh, Christ.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know how far he would have taken it. I don\u2019t know if he\u2019s done anything like this before. But I know she was scared even if she won\u2019t admit it.\u201d</p><p>Jack runs his hands through his hair. \u201cShe\u2019s worried he\u2019s going to press assault charges against you.\u201d</p><p>I shrug. \u201cLet him. Let him try to explain why I had to shove him off her to begin with.\u201d</p><p>His eyes glisten with unshed tears. \u201cI worry about her, you know. She wants everyone to like her. She wants to make everyone happy. But I never thought this guy was like that. I got her the job, for Christ\u2019s sake.\u201d</p><p>I take a deep breath. \u201cI don\u2019t know what he\u2019s like. But I saw him with her over the summer and he rubbed me the wrong way. Of course he didn\u2019t push himself on her then.\u201d</p><p>He clasps my shoulder again. \u201cI don\u2019t know what you were doing there, but I can\u2019t thank you enough.\u201d</p><p>My eyes find his before I respond. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to thank me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will make sure Wyatt knows I\u2019m aware of what went down. You can be sure of that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope he gets what he deserves\u2014one way or another.\u201d</p><p>He bobs his chin toward the room. \u201cCome on, let\u2019s get back in there before Charlotte has a breakdown. The doctors ordered a CT to rule out a concussion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid they do one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey took her down when I was waiting for you.\u201d</p><p>My pulse pounds as concern courses through me. She\u2019s sitting up drinking a small container of apple juice, making a slurping noise, when we enter the room. I feel slightly uneven as I slow and take the last steps toward her bed, but when she smiles at me around her straw, it eases my worry.</p><p>\u201cWhat did the doctors say?\u201d My voice comes out hoarse.</p><p>She sets her drink down, but Charlotte answers, \u201cThey said there were no signs of a concussion, but they want her to stay awake for at least the next six hours and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom, I got all the instructions. You don\u2019t have to repeat each one,\u201d Bell says.</p><p>My palms are sweaty and I wipe them on my pants.</p><p>\u201cYou should come home with us tonight,\u201d Charlotte says.</p><p>\u201cI can make sure she gets home,\u201d I blurt out, not wanting to be away from her.</p><p>S\u2019belle\u2019s eyes dart to mine.</p><p>\u201cIf she\u2019d rather be home, I mean,\u201d I add, not certain what she\u2019s thinking.</p><p>\u201cOh, we appreciate that, but I think she needs to be with us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCharlotte, why don\u2019t we go make sure the front desk has the correct insurance information?\u201d Jack takes her hand.</p><p>\u201cOh yes, of course.\u201d Charlotte picks her purse up off the table.</p><p>They both leave and I sit beside S\u2019belle on the bed.</p><p>S\u2019belle\u2019s eyes search mine. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to stay with me. I\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p><p>I take her hand. \u201cI want to stay with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if I\u2019m not sure I want you to?\u201d</p><p>\u201cS\u2019belle, why do you always to have to fight me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy did you run into the arms of another woman the night I told you about the baby?\u201d</p><p>I blink at her in confusion. \u201cI didn\u2019t. I haven\u2019t been with anyone since you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTate told me he saw you at Beck\u2019s that night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did get really drunk and some chick talked to me, but Beck and Ruby brought me home. I swear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you were going to sleep with her?\u201d</p><p>I shake my head as definitively as I can.</p><p>She searches my eyes. \u201cWhy did you come tonight?\u201d</p><p>I draw in a ragged breath. \u201cI wanted to talk to you. No, I wanted to tell you I was sorry, S\u2019belle, sorry for the way I acted when you told me. I was an ass**le. And you were right\u2014I do seem to always think of myself, but I promise . . .\u201d</p><p>Her eyes drop to the white sheet on the bed. \u201cBen . . . we can\u2019t do this. Just go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not leaving without you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust go home!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t do that.\u201d</p><p>Her gaze lifts to mine. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>The question makes me laugh a little, under my breath. I have to think for a moment how to explain my feelings. I lift her chin in my hand. \u201cSome part of me is drawn to you. No matter how long we\u2019re apart, I can\u2019t stop thinking about you. I know you feel it too. And I\u2019m not walking away.\u201d</p><p>Silence sweeps the sterile space around us.</p><p>She reaches out her neck and kisses me softly on the lips\u2014and the gesture feels like a new kind of kiss, a new beginning.</p><p>I smile at her. \u201cSo I\u2019m coming home with you.\u201d It\u2019s not a question.</p><p>She nods. \u201cYeah, I guess you are.\u201d</p><p>A strange feeling runs through me as I take her hand. I\u2019m not sure what it is, but I feel the connection I always feel when I\u2019m near her grow stronger than it\u2019s ever been.</p><p>She pushes some hair from my eyes, and the feel of her fingers on me makes my body burn.</p><p>\u201cYou have blood all over your shirt,\u201d she says.</p><p>I shrug and lean closer to her. \u201cI\u2019m just glad you\u2019re all right.\u201d</p><p>She takes my face in her hands and pulls me even closer.</p><p>\u201cOkay, honey, that\u2019s all set. We can go now,\u201d Charlotte says, walking into the room.</p><p>I quickly jump to my feet.</p><p>Jack clears his throat.</p><p>\u201cMom, Ben will take me home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCharlotte, Bell is old enough to make her own decisions. She\u2019ll be fine,\u201d Jack reassures her.</p><p>Charlotte turns toward me and hands me a bottle. \u201cShe\u2019s to take two of these antibiotics a day, plus Tylenol every four hours, she\u2019s not to fall asleep for six hours, and if she feels nauseated she\u2019s to go to the hospital.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take care of her, Mrs. Tyler,\u201d I promise.</p><p>She seems surprised. \u201cCharlotte.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCharlotte,\u201d I acquiesce.</p><p>She steps closer and gives me a little hug, whispering, \u201cThank you,\u201d in my ear.</p><p>I catch her eyes and nod. I see her throat working to hold back the tears. Obviously Jack filled her in.</p><p>Jack takes my hand and covers it with his. \u201cYou call us if anything happens.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will,\u201d I assure him.</p><p>As soon as Bell is dressed Charlotte and Jack walk us to my car and stand in the parking lot watching as we drive away. I did my best to reassure them, but I think the concern goes beyond her head wound. I get that.</p><p>We\u2019re both quiet as I drive from Malibu to LA. My thoughts keep flipping back to what might have happened to her if I hadn\u2019t gotten there in time.</p><p>\u201cHow long has he been harassing you?\u201d I ask because it\u2019s driving me crazy.</p><p>She turns toward me. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t really harassing me. But ever since I ran into you I think he could sense I was interested in someone and sometimes he\u2019d make inappropriate comments, but it wasn\u2019t anything I couldn\u2019t handle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cInappropriate how?\u201d I ask, my stomach plummeting.</p><p>\u201cI really don\u2019t want to think about it. But I promise, today was the first time he actually got physical.\u201d</p><p>I shudder at the word physical. The thought of anyone touching her sickens me. I take her hand in mine.</p><p>\u201cHe wouldn\u2019t have hurt me. I know what you\u2019re thinking.\u201d</p><p>I hope she\u2019s right, but it\u2019s over now and we never have to find out. \u201cHow about some food?\u201d I say, deciding to lighten the dark conversation.</p><p>\u201cI am kind of hungry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood, because I am too.\u201d I turn and grin at her and then look down at my shirt. \u201cTakeout okay with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Kettle has the best broccoli cheddar,\u201d she says.</p><p>\u201cYou want soup?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, when you\u2019re sick you\u2019re supposed to eat soup.\u201d</p><p>My head snaps to hers. \u201cDo you not feel well?\u201d</p><p>She presses her fingers to her bandage. \u201cI feel fine. You know what I mean.\u201d</p><p>I try to control my laughter but feel my shoulders shake. \u201cSure I do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can call ahead.\u201d</p><p>I grin over at her. \u201cI thought you didn\u2019t eat vegetables.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes light up. \u201cCheese goes with everything.\u201d</p><p>This time when I look over at her, I let my laughter fill the car.</p><p>CHAPTER 28</p><p>Talk Dirty</p><p>Bell</p><p>While Southern California is being battered by the powerful Santa Ana winds, Ben and I pick up the soups and he takes me to the ridge to look at the city view while we eat.</p><p>\u201cDo you believe me about Beck\u2019s?\u201d he asks.</p><p>\u201cStrangely enough, I do.\u201d</p><p>I place my spoon in my golden cheddar soup deliciously nestled in a bread bowl. \u201cWant to try some?\u201d I ask, pulling the spoon now laden with soup toward my mouth. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll pass. Even cheese can\u2019t conceal the broccoli smell. Brings back nightmares from my childhood.\u201d</p><p>I think about him as a child for a moment and how cute he must have been. \u201cDid you have to sit at the table until you ate all your vegetables?\u201d</p><p>His teeth graze his own spoon slurping in a giant noodle. Once he swallows he says, \u201cSomething like that. For me it was more like I had to sit at the table until I could get my dog to eat all my vegetables.\u201d</p><p>God, he was a bad boy even as a kid. I find that oddly to be a turn-on. Watching him eat has my stomach yearning with desire and not for food. \u201cWe had a dog too. A golden retriever named Beat.\u201d</p> <p>He laughs. \u201cThat makes sense since your dad was in the music business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat was your dog\u2019s name?\u201d</p><p>A gleam enters his eyes, one I\u2019ve never seen. \u201cKahuana. He was the biggest, baddest, chocolate Lab you could ever have seen.\u201d</p><p>I laugh. \u201cSounds like \u2018Leroy Brown.\u2019\u201d</p><p>Seemingly lost in his thoughts still, he looks at me questioningly.</p> <p>\u201cThe song \u2018Bad, Bad Leroy Brown.\u2019 He was meaner than a junkyard dog.\u201d</p><p>He shakes his head at me again. \u201cYeah, something like that. Can I ask you something?\u201d His tone changes to something more serious.</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d I say, blowing on my soup.</p><p>\u201cThat night I came over and you pulled out a bottle of wine, I saw vodka on your counter too. Are you drinking again?\u201d</p><p>I tense up while his eyes study my face. \u201cNo, I never drank any of what I bought. I thought about it. I opened the bottles. Even poured a glass or two but never drank a drop.\u201d</p><p>His hand moves to tuck a piece of hair behind my ear.</p> <p>I jerk away, moving to swat his hand. \u201cI\u2019m not like my father. I\u2019m not an alcoholic, you know.\u201d</p><p>He catches my wrist and gently closes his fingers around it. \u201cI know that and it doesn\u2019t matter anyway. I just want to make sure you\u2019re okay.\u201d</p><p>My heart beats faster, as if it\u2019s reaching for him. \u201cI am.\u201d</p><p>The moment suddenly feels too serious.</p><p>\u201cGood, because I\u2019m the jackass that got so drunk that night at the bar I couldn\u2019t remember where I parked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t drive home, I hope?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Beck drove my bike home, and believe me, he was not happy.\u201d</p><p>We finish our soups and talk about fun things we did as kids. When we\u2019re done and heading back, I stare out the windows watching the trees sway side to side. It seems as though so much time has passed since our first dates. But in actuality not that much time has passed; it\u2019s more that much has happened between us.</p> <p>Before I know it we pull up to my apartment building. He puts the car in PARK and turns to me. \u201cYou know, I really missed you.\u201d</p><p>I smile. \u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>He shakes his head, somewhat amused, I think.</p><p>I leave him there pondering my answer and open the door to get out.</p><p>He catches up to me just as I\u2019m climbing the steps. Once we hit the top, he grips my hips. \u201cAnd how do you know that?\u201d he growls in my ear.</p><p>I breathe him in\u2014that scent I\u2019ve missed for far too long makes me feel a little dizzy. I stabilize myself and take my keys from my purse. \u201cBecause I missed you too.\u201d</p><p>Then I turn to face him. He\u2019s staring at me, his eyes gleaming. \u201cThat strangely makes sense,\u201d he says, and takes the key from my hand before leaning in to place a soft kiss on my lips.</p><p>The heat between us intensifies and he pulls away, caressing my cheek and motioning for the door. When we get to it, he quickly shoves the key in the lock. I stand behind him as close as I can and rest my chin on his shoulder to peer down.</p><p>He twists his neck around to see me. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>I grin, liking the feel of his body so close to mine. \u201cMaking sure you know how to unlock the door.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know, I could use a little direction,\u201d he says.</p><p>I press closer into him. \u201cYou insert the rod into the hole,\u201d I whisper into his ear. My voice is low, raspy with desire.</p><p>His body stiffens and his breathing is rough.</p><p>I close my eyes and feel a rush of excitement. \u201cNext you turn it and pull it out.\u201d</p><p>He twists the key ever so slowly. \u201cLike this?\u201d he asks in that husky voice that makes me throb between my legs.</p><p>My own breathing picks up and I\u2019m shamelessly panting. If I never understood kinetic energy before, I do now. He grabs the door handle and quickly pushes it open, ushering me by him at a rapid speed. I take the key from his hands. \u201cThen you\u2014\u201d I start to say as I turn around to lock the door, but I\u2019m silenced when his hard body meets my back.</p><p>He grips my h*ps and his lips find my neck. \u201cAre you sure you\u2019re up to this?\u201d</p><p>I try to catch my breath, but all my air is gone. I let my head fall back on his shoulder. \u201cI\u2019m sure. I don\u2019t want to wait any longer.\u201d</p><p>He flips me around and runs his hands down the side of my body. \u201cDo you have any idea how badly I want you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShow me just how bad,\u201d I breathe huskily over his lips.</p><p>His eyes close and he shudders.</p><p>\u201cBen, stop thinking.\u201d</p><p>His eyes open at the sound of my voice, and they have never been bluer. \u201cI\u2019m trying to figure out if we should be doing this after everything that happened tonight.\u201d</p><p>I bring my hands to his face. \u201cHe didn\u2019t attack me. I wasn\u2019t really afraid, just startled. I\u2019m okay. This is okay,\u201d I reassure him, my body aching for him in a selfish way.</p><p>He stares into the depths of my eyes and brings a hand up to stroke my cheek. \u201cWe\u2019ll take this slow.\u201d</p><p>I slide my lips to his hand and kiss it, nodding.</p><p>And again he stares into my eyes. And then as if he can\u2019t take another minute of restraint, he slides his knee between my legs. My chest rises and falls with an intensity I\u2019ve never felt before. He brushes the hair from my forehead and softly kisses above my bandage. I wrap my arms around his neck and throw my head back as he feathers kisses down my neck. He kisses behind my ear, and a hum of some kind escapes my throat. He groans at the sound. My breath is shallow but fast. Finally he moves to my mouth. My lips part and when he presses his to mine, I slide my tongue inside his mouth and across his lower lip. I want to explore every part of his gorgeous mouth and I want him to do the same, but I know my breath must smell really bad right now.</p><p>\u201cBen?\u201d My voice is shaky.</p><p>He pulls away to search my eyes.</p><p>My palms flatten on his chest and I can feel his heart pounding. \u201cI need to brush my teeth.\u201d</p><p>Obviously fighting off laughter, he presses himself into me and kisses me even harder, deeper. \u201cYou taste delicious. You always do,\u201d he says.</p><p>I melt back against the wall and band my arms around his waist. \u201cYou sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure,\u201d he chuckles.</p><p>\u201cOkay, then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBesides I don\u2019t want to wait another minute to see you naked,\u201d he growls, and then promptly lifts me off the floor.</p><p>I flick my shoes off one at a time and hear each clatter against the floor. Then I wrap my legs around his waist and ask a question I already know the answer to. \u201cWhere are we going?\u201d</p><p>He slides his hands up and down my sides. \u201cTo your room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI liked the wall,\u201d I purr.</p><p>\u201cIf I f**ked you against the wall, I\u2019m afraid you\u2019d bang your head against it. Let\u2019s keep to soft surfaces like the mattress. I told you we were going to take this slow, and besides, we\u2019ve already done the wall.\u201d</p><p>I place openmouthed kisses down his neck, tasting him with each lick and suck. \u201cWhat if I don\u2019t want slow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood thing I\u2019m the one in control, then,\u201d he says, and my heart races at his tone.</p><p>\u201cMaybe that\u2019s where I want to be,\u201d I tease and run my nails down his back\u2014hard.</p><p>\u201cFuck,\u201d he groans, lowering me to the floor in my bedroom. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to make this easy for me, are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid I tell you I\u2019ve dreamed about you almost every night since the library?\u201d My fingers trail to the buttons on his shirt and I undo them one by one.</p><p>\u201cTell me what you dreamed,\u201d he says in a seductive voice.</p><p>\u201cI dreamed about you delivering pizza to my apartment but I had no money to pay you, about you pulling me over and me trying to get out of a speeding ticket, about you being my doctor and me needing a very thorough exam.\u201d Okay, so really I dreamed about him and me lying together, naked, happy, just us, but I want my dreams to sound a little sexier than they actually were. And I don\u2019t want to scare him off.</p><p>His tongue caresses my earlobe. \u201cDid all of your dreams end in me f**king you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm . . . hmm,\u201d I answer, shivering when his tongue slides inside my ear.</p><p>His breathing accelerates at a rapid speed. \u201cGood, because your dreams are about to come true.\u201d</p><p>I fumble with the last few buttons of his shirt, my entire body trembling in anticipation. He looks down at my hands and then rips the rest of his bloodstained shirt off, the remaining buttons flying to the floor. He looks at my pale pink silky top also spotted with blood and with his fingers gripping the V of it, he tears it right down the middle and pushes it off my shoulders to reveal my matching pink bra.</p><p>His eyes grow dark with desire and his hair has fallen and lies tousled over his forehead. He has to be the sexiest guy I have ever seen\u2014ever.</p><p>The lights are on in the room and although the blinds are pulled down, they aren\u2019t fully shut. I want to say something, but when his hands move around to undo my bra and he places both his palms over my br**sts, the tingle in my skin is all I care about. He feels me for a bit, thumbing my ni**les to draw them into stiff peaks. When his hands drop I immediately feel their loss and want that warmth back. He takes a moment to admire me.</p><p>\u201cSo f**king sexy,\u201d he murmurs.</p><p>His voice makes me shiver again. His head dips and he circles his tongue around my nipple, first one side, then the other. He tugs a little on one and traces circles around the other with his thumb. I press into his mouth, loving the way it feels on my skin.</p><p>\u201cTouch me,\u201d I plead, wanting his hands to move a little lower. Needing to feel them there.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m in control here,\u201d he says, letting his mouth drop a little as if teasing me.</p><p>I gasp when his lips hit the waistband of my skirt, his fingers gliding up the silk of my hose. In response I thread my fingers through his hair, tugging harder the farther up my thigh his fingers creep. My body hums at his sensual touch and my heartbeat accelerates. He undoes my skirt and as it floats to the floor, one of his hands spans my rear and the other the area between my hipbones. I moan so loudly I almost want to beg him to speed it up, but luckily I don\u2019t have to.</p><p>He quickly straightens and grabs my chin with my fingers to bring my eyes to his. \u201cI\u2019ve dreamed about being inside you every night too. My c**k has swollen so big thinking about it I\u2019ve come in my dreams,\u201d he confesses.</p><p>My hands fly to his jeans and I unbutton them as fast as I can. My need to feel him is out of control. I slide inside his pants, wrap my fist around him, pumping him up and down.</p><p>\u201cDoes that feel good?\u201d I purr, getting on my toes to nip at his lip.</p><p>\u201cReally, really good. So good,\u201d he hisses.</p><p>\u201cIn your dreams were you this big?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBigger.\u201d</p><p>I squeeze him harder, reaching down to grab even lower.</p><p>\u201cOh, f**k,\u201d he groans, and takes a step back, disengaging from me. Then he reaches his hand inside my hose. \u201cFuck, you\u2019re not wearing underwear again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never wear them with hose,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cSexy as f**k,\u201d he mutters again. He cups my sex, sliding a finger inside me so fast the pleasure seems more like pain. \u201cS\u2019belle . . . your skin is so soft and you\u2019re so wet. I think you like torturing my cock.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>A wicked smile tilts at my lips as I reach to touch him again, but he doesn\u2019t let me.</p><p>\u201cTake your hose off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake your pants off,\u201d I counter.</p><p>He grins at me but doesn\u2019t move.</p> <p>Okay, so I\u2019ll go first. I slowly slide my hose down and stand n*ked before him. \u201cYour turn.\u201d</p><p>He toes off his boots and pushes his jeans and boxers down at the same time. I stare in awe now that I finally get to admire him in all his glory. I want to reacquaint myself with every part of him. I step forward and run my hands over him, under him, around him.</p><p>\u201cOh, f**k,\u201d he groans again, this time letting his head drop back when my index finger touches that one sensitive spot. His response to my touch only further ignites the sexual energy between us.</p><p>\u201cStill want to take it slow?\u201d I taunt.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t play fair,\u201d he manages through gritted teeth.</p> <p>I rub my palms back and forth over his penis and stop only to squeeze it tight. Tight enough that I can feel an incredible pulsing. It matches the one between my legs. I do it again and then again. Each squeeze causes his face to bloom in a pleasure he can\u2019t mask.</p><p>His hands move quickly to my sex. The sound I make when he plunges a finger inside me is one I\u2019ve never heard and only escalates my urge to have him inside me.</p><p>\u201cI think we\u2019re done with the foreplay.\u201d The husky tone of his voice makes a wave of pleasure skip all the way from my head to my toes.</p><p>My pulse is racing as we fall to the bed together. He props himself up on an elbow and lets his gaze lazily slide down me, but he stops when he sees the gleaming green shamrock in my belly button. For a moment time stands still. He leans down to softly kiss it and I rest my hands on his head. A spark of uncertainty blossoms between us and I\u2019m almost afraid to look down. When I finally do, I can feel a tear shimmering in my eye and feel another slide down my cheek. He crawls up the bed and with both elbows resting on the mattress he hovers over me and catches my tears with his thumbs.</p><p>He swallows hard. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cDon\u2019t be sorry. I\u2019m not sad. What you did was beautiful.\u201d</p> <p>He kisses my tears one by one and once they\u2019ve all stopped, he finds my mouth. We kiss for a long time. Soft gentle kisses with tender touches. We share a sadness that we both take the time to mourn. His tongue strokes mine, his hands roam my body, and the flame between us reignites. With each touch my body burns hotter for him. When our kisses turn into hard, deep, soul-searching ones, he nudges my legs apart.</p><p>He presses his palms into the mattress, shifting his weight. I run my tongue in a frenzy up and down his chest, letting him know I\u2019m hungry for him. His penis throbs between us until finally he slides inside me. He groans at our contact and my back arches to allow him in\u2014all the way in. He slides deep, so deep. We\u2019re both so aroused there\u2019s no friction between us. I feel him everywhere\u2014inside me, surrounding me, in my soul even. I lift my hips, curl my fingers around his shoulders, dig my nails into my flesh, all while his body rocks over me. I\u2019m in sensation overload. He\u2019s everywhere and I want even more of him.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so wet, so tight,\u201d he whispers in my ear.</p><p>\u201cYou feel so good,\u201d I moan.</p><p>Everything around us disappears; every part of my body feels licked by flames. He moves deliberately, painfully slow, but it feels torturously good. I don\u2019t want this pleasure to ever end. His tongue thrusts into my mouth. I moan when he pulls out and slams back into me. He does it again and I cry out even louder. My hands graze his back, roam down, and push him deeper.</p><p>He stills. \u201cThe feel of your hands drives me wild.\u201d</p><p>I become impatient and thrust my h*ps up. \u201cYou drive me wild.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet,\u201d he groans. \u201cI want to stay buried deep inside you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPlease, Ben.\u201d I\u2019m begging him.</p><p>He looks at me and then he rocks harder, faster, thrusting in and out in an unrelenting momentum that makes me feel as if I\u2019ve gone to heaven.</p><p>My back arches. \u201cDon\u2019t stop. Please don\u2019t stop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou like that?\u201d</p><p>I scream out, \u201cYes, Ben, yes. Take me to heaven,\u201d over and over.</p><p>He buries his face in my neck and then I hear my name like a prayer. \u201cS\u2019belle,\u201d he calls out, his body convulsing.</p><p>I squeeze my eyes closed, seeing stars everywhere as I come harder than I ever have. My body shakes, pleasure radiates throughout it, and I feel him spasming over and over inside me.</p><p>\u201cOpen your eyes,\u201d he tells me.</p><p>He thrusts one last time and I watch as pleasure covers his face in a way I\u2019ve never seen on a man. He falls on top of me, breathless, panting, and completely spent. He murmurs my name against my neck. After a few minutes he rolls to my side and pulls my body tight to his. He cups my chin to look up at him. \u201cThat was . . .\u201d He stops and bolts up. \u201cFuck, I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d</p><p>I sit up, confused.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t wrap up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t wear a condom.\u201d</p><p>Laughter bursts from my mouth. \u201cI\u2019m on the pill. It\u2019s fine.\u201d</p><p>He darts his eyes to mine. \u201cI hope you don\u2019t say that to all the guys you\u2019ve fuc . . . been with.\u201d</p><p>I push his shoulder. \u201cI haven\u2019t actually slept with that many guys and, yes, they\u2019ve always . . . wrapped up.\u201d I laugh even harder.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t laugh at my choice of words. Why don\u2019t you tell me how good that felt for you?\u201d</p><p>I want to be embarrassed but I\u2019m not, so I decide to answer honestly. \u201cSex with you is like heaven. Plain and simple.\u201d</p><p>He grins devilishly and then grabs hold of me and pins me to the bed. \u201cYou seem perfectly fine.\u201d</p><p>My laughter fades as the heat surges between us again. \u201cI told you I am.\u201d</p><p>He dips his head. \u201cGood,\u201d he growls in my ear, \u201cbecause this time when I take you to heaven, I\u2019m not taking it slow.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 29</p><p>Shape of Love</p><p>Ben</p><p>The creamy white sheet that perfectly matches her skin tone covers our bodies from head to toe as I caress my hand down her back, dusting light kisses all over her face. She giggles and my heart skips every time. I really f**king love that sound.</p><p>\u201cThat tickles.\u201d She laughs from inside our cocoon.</p><p>I bury my face in her neck and suck on the spot behind her ear I\u2019ve already discovered doesn\u2019t tickle her but encourages her to make those sounds that drive me insane.</p><p>Her breathing picks up the minute my lips apply pressure. She might not be ticklish in that spot, but it definitely turns her on.</p><p>\u201cDoes that tickle?\u201d I murmur in her ear, knowing already it doesn\u2019t. Knowing the more I suck the wetter she\u2019ll get.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d But her voice sounds breathy.</p><p>We stay up most of the night exploring each other\u2019s bodies. We fall asleep much later than the six hours she was prescribed to wait and wake up before the sunrise. Aside from water breaks, bathroom runs, and one small food run, we haven\u2019t moved from her bed.</p><p>I nip at her earlobe, then roll over onto my back, pulling the sheet from our heads. I blink the brightness of the daylight away. \u201cWhat time is it?\u201d</p><p>She burrows out of the sheet and crawls up to lie beside me on the pillow. \u201cWhen I called my mom it was ten.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat had to be hours ago.\u201d I reach for my phone, but then I look over toward her. With her freckles bright, her smile wide, and her hair a beautiful mess of tangles, I unclench my hand and leave my phone where it is. \u201cYou know what, it doesn\u2019t really matter what time it is.\u201d</p><p>She takes a grape from the bowl beside her bed and pops it in my mouth before taking another one for herself. Once she\u2019s done chewing she flops back down. \u201cWe should probably get something to eat soon.\u201d</p><p>I raise myself up on my elbow and look down at her. \u201cLet\u2019s order in. I don\u2019t want you to leave this bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPasta?\u201d Her eyes light up at the thought.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re hungry, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, a little.\u201d</p><p>I pull the sheet back over our heads and entwine my legs with hers. \u201cOkay, tell me what you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou,\u201d she whispers.</p><p>With a growl I roll her and pin her to the mattress. \u201cI meant what restaurant, but I like your answer better.\u201d I let go of her wrists and glide my palm up her thigh. \u201cTell me what you want right now.\u201d</p><p>She looks at me and covers her face with her hands.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you so shy during the day?\u201d</p><p>She lifts her fingers from her eyes. \u201cI don\u2019t know. I\u2019ve never really had sex with anyone during the day.\u201d</p><p>I raise an eyebrow. \u201cAnyone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOther than myself,\u201d she confesses.</p><p>The things she says are sexy as f**k. Does she know that? \u201cYou\u2019ll have to show me someday.\u201d I offer her a grin.</p><p>She flips around so I can\u2019t see her. \u201cThe first month we dated and you\u2019d call me, all I wanted to do was listen to your voice and touch myself.\u201d</p><p>For her it was a deep, dark confession. One I could relate to. I\u2019d had to jerk myself off many times after hanging up the phone with her. A surge of some kind of emotion that again I can\u2019t clarify flows through me. I push it aside and pull the sheet even higher so we\u2019re covered in semidarkness again. And then I press myself into her back and skim my fingers over her clit.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here now. And if you\u2019re ready to touch yourself in front of me, then tell me what you want me to do to you.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes hood and her lips part. \u201cI like it when you put your face between my legs.\u201d</p><p>I crawl over her so I\u2019m facing her and place a soft kiss above her bandage. What I feel when I look at her winds me. It\u2019s more than just lust and desire\u2014it\u2019s a need to make her part of me. And with that sudden realization I kiss her mouth chastely, still trying to skate on the edge of softness. \u201cSee, that wasn\u2019t so hard.\u201d</p><p>I watch the rise and fall of her chest as the heat flares up again between us.</p><p>My pulse is racing at an uncontrollable level and I take a second to let it slow and to admire how beautiful she is\u2014her fiery red hair fanning out under the sheets of her bed, her br**sts full and perky. I draw my lips down her neck and stop at the hollow below it. I dip my tongue in and out of the space. Fueled by excitement, I continue down over the curves of her br**sts and stop to suck and lick her already pebbled ni**les. Her back arches and my dick twitches in response. But when my lips skate over her ribs and skim down to her navel, I have to stop the seduction and place a gentle kiss there. It\u2019s not surprising that her body tenses in response. My own does as well. But I quickly push aside the sadness I feel crawling up my throat and move to nibble on her hip before blowing a breath across her clit. A shiver shakes her body. Her legs part and slowly the tension between us turns into passion, turns to nothing but pleasure.</p><p>Her body is completely bare of any hair. Even her eyebrows are faint, lighter than the color of her hair. I had noticed on our dates the smooth skin of her arms, and on the few times she had worn skirts, I noticed her legs were just as bare. But when I felt her smooth, bare pu**y at the beach I almost came on the spot. I love this\u2014love the feel of her smooth, soft skin against my tongue. I love the lack of any barrier between us.</p><p>A gentle kiss on her thigh, then another and another. I trace a half-moon around her pu**y from one side to the other. She squirms and her fists clench the sheets. I feel a grin cross my lips when I see how turned on she is. When I get to the other thigh, I lift my face but quickly descend to cover her cl*t with my mouth. I suck on it immediately and she cries out, sending adrenaline shooting through my veins. Next I place a soft kiss in the same place I just engulfed with my mouth and suck on it again. She whimpers, alternating between sounds of pleasure and pain\u2014the pained sounds come when I stop; the pleasured moans escalate with every suck. I take my time, wanting her to thoroughly enjoy this. When I use my tongue to circle her clit, I can\u2019t suppress my own groan at her reaction. She almost jumps out of her skin. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDo you like that?\u201d I ask, already knowing she does.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she answers through gritted teeth.</p><p>\u201cDo you want me to do it again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she cries out, her legs stiffening in anticipation.</p> <p>I look up at her. \u201cDo you want to feel heaven?\u201d</p><p>I know she wants to roll her eyes at me, but instead she says, \u201cYes,\u201d in a pant.</p><p>\u201cThen take the sheet off us.\u201d</p><p>She peeks down at me. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou heard me, take the sheet off and watch me.\u201d</p> <p>I see her fingers let go of the bottom sheet and as she starts to tug the top one down I grab it and pull it off us. With sunlight shining on us I dive down, wanting to devour every single inch of her. Her fingers thread in my hair. And when my fingers move her apart and my tongue dips inside, she tugs on my locks. When her knees pop up and her toes dig into my calves, I know she\u2019s close. I look up at her\u2014her hooded eyes filled with desire look back at me.</p><p>\u201cNo, Ben. Please don\u2019t stop,\u201d she says, her words choppy, sounding as though she\u2019s having trouble speaking.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t. Just tell me where you want to go,\u201d I answer, my words coming out with equal effort</p><p>\u201cTake me to heaven, Ben. Make me come.\u201d</p><p>My mouth covers her again and this time I lick and suck at the same time and let her find her release. I want her to feel something she never has. I want to be the one to take her heaven.</p><p>\u201cOh, Ben, yes!\u201d she screams.</p> <p>My hands find her toes curled into my calves and I clutch them as she rides another wave of pleasure and then another. With my heart pounding in my ears, I crawl up her body and hover over her and stare down at her. Again I have to swallow the lump in my throat, but it has nothing to do with sadness. It\u2019s her beauty and I don\u2019t understand where these feelings are coming from, but at the same time I don\u2019t care. Her hands glide down my face, and the smile on her lips grows wider.</p><p>Unable to speak, I simply stare into her eyes. Her hands move to my cock, and her finger goes right to that spot beneath it. Fuck, if I weren\u2019t already ready for her, what she\u2019s doing right now would make me hard instantly. Finally I reposition myself and slide my straining c**k slowly inside her. Her pu**y is wet and as I fill her I can\u2019t stop from shuddering at the overwhelming pleasure.</p><p>Her back arches.</p><p>\u201cOh God,\u201d I groan, and bury my face in her neck.</p><p>Pleasure strikes immediately. She feels warm, welcoming, and so ready for me that I can\u2019t control myself.</p><p>She smooths her hands down my back and runs her nails over my muscles. My blood feels as if it\u2019s on fire. I push deeper, move faster. She urges me faster with her h*ps and this time I can\u2019t hold on. When she moans louder suddenly, that\u2019s all that matters. In this one single moment all I can feel is the need for release.</p><p>\u201cFuck,\u201d I call out when she changes the angle of h*ps by wrapping her legs around me, allowing me to thrust even deeper inside her. I\u2019ve had sex with countless women over the last three years, but not one of them has made me feel like this right now.</p><p>I chance a look in her eyes and I\u2019m done. It\u2019s a bolt of lightning crashing through my body.</p> <p>\u201cCome with me,\u201d I plead with her, my voice hoarse.</p><p>\u201cI will, I will, I promise,\u201d she cries in a ragged tone.</p><p>I close my eyes. My muscles tense everywhere. And as we call out each other\u2019s name in unison, my body jerks and I feel as if I\u2019m breaking through some unknown barrier I didn\u2019t know existed. I open my eyes to look at her as I come harder than I\u2019ve ever experienced. I feel as if my body is exploding\u2014as if it\u2019s separating into smaller pieces and leaving this universe for another. The feeling scares the living shit out of me.</p><p>It takes me a few minutes to collect myself. Sweat coats my body, my c**k throbs inside her, and finally I collapse next to her, unable to move. I bury my face in her neck and when I feel the air return to my lungs I kiss her softly. First her shoulder, then her neck, her jaw, and finally her mouth. She kisses me back, mimicking my own pattern. She kisses my mouth, my jaw, my neck, my shoulder. I shiver at her gentleness. Maybe that\u2019s what\u2019s different about her? The f**king isn\u2019t just f**king. It\u2019s intermixed with tenderness. I haven\u2019t felt that in a long time. I think I missed it.</p><p>I roll off her, the weight of my odd feelings heavy on my mind. She stays silent and so do I. But I pull her to me and then tug the sheet back over us. I bury us in our cocoon where I don\u2019t have to try to figure out what the hell is going inside my head.</p><p>I must have fallen asleep, because when she turns in her sleep, it awakens me. Her back nestles into my front and I curl my arm around her. Her skin is warm and feels incredibly comforting against mine. My fingers mindlessly play with the shamrock in her belly button.</p><p>\u201cYou asked me if I knew if the baby was a boy or a girl,\u201d she says, and the sound of her voice surprises me.</p><p>My movement stops for the briefest of moments but then I continue to finger the ornament. \u201cYeah, I did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat I said sounded cold. But it wasn\u2019t like that.\u201d</p><p>I close my eyes. \u201cI never thought you sounded cold.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI loved the baby. That\u2019s why I knew I couldn\u2019t keep it.\u201d</p><p>I kiss her cheek and let mine rest on hers. Inside our cocoon we can talk about anything and I know this is something that she needs to share and I need to hear.</p><p>\u201cKnowing the sex would have made it all too real. It was better for me not to know. Can you ever understand that?\u201d</p><p>I kiss her cheek again, leaving my lips there because I feel the wetness of her tears. Then I turn her around to face me. \u201cI do understand, S\u2019belle. I do.\u201d My fingers move back to the symbol of our baby she wears to remember, although I don\u2019t think she needs to wear the shamrock to remember. \u201cThis is a beautiful thing,\u201d I say, circling her belly button. \u201cBut you did what you thought was best for the baby and you don\u2019t have to take the blame alone anymore. Let me help you.\u201d</p><p>Her tears fall and her cries grow louder and I let her get it out. Let the emotion she\u2019s kept bottled up for all these years spill out onto me. I know we can\u2019t change the past. I have no idea what would have happened if she had told me, and that enables me to share in the blame. I want to help her heal the wounds that she hasn\u2019t allowed to close. My arms tighten around her and I whisper, \u201cIt\u2019s time to let go, S\u2019belle. It\u2019s time to let go.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t know how much time passes, but when I feel her breathing even out, I know she\u2019s fallen asleep. I hope when she awakes, the burden she\u2019s carried on her shoulders will feel a little less heavy. I carefully lift the sheet and slip out to shower. When I finish I go in search of my clothes, then remember I ripped the buttons off my shirt. I creep into her closet and find a USC sweatshirt large enough for me to wear. It looks familiar and I wonder if it\u2019s mine from so many years ago.</p><p>With a grin on my face, knowing it is, I grab my keys and hers as well. I open the door to go pick us up some food and come face-to-face with S\u2019belle\u2019s brother\u2014Xander Wilde. We were in the same fraternity in college, although he\u2019s older. I knew who he was but didn\u2019t really know him. Last year I saw him again at Dahlia\u2019s house when he pulled his brother off me and Caleb hauled my ass out of the room. Not one of my fondest memories\u2014getting my ass beat. But in hindsight it was well deserved. My cocky attitude and belligerent words were more than deserving of River\u2019s anger.</p><p>His eyes narrow as they assess me. I feel he\u2019s trying to determine if I\u2019m good enough for his sister. Maybe I\u2019m aiming higher than I should. In fact, I\u2019m sure I am because I actually feel he\u2019s trying to determine if I\u2019m as big a piece of shit as he believes I am. It\u2019s how I imagine I\u2019d feel going to pick a girl up for a first date and having to meet her father, one that already hated me. But since I dated Dahlia all through high school and I had grown up next door to her, thank f**k I never had to experience that kind of scrutiny, because this is a really uncomfortable feeling.</p><p>He steps around me and makes his way in, looking around for Bell. \u201cWhere\u2019s my sister?\u201d</p><p>I take a deep breath and extend my hand. \u201cXander.\u201d</p><p>His eyes keep sweeping the apartment. Then he nods, extending his hand in return, allowing his eyes to settle on me for a quick second. At least he doesn\u2019t leave me hanging. \u201cJack told me what happened yesterday. I stopped by to check on Bell.\u201d</p><p>Fuck me if this couldn\u2019t be more uncomfortable. Normally I\u2019d have already said f**k you. But since I\u2019ve just spent the last . . . I don\u2019t how long . . . f**king his sister and she\u2019s sleeping n*ked in the other room while he\u2019s here to check on her, and I do want to try to earn his respect, I face his scrutiny head-on. \u201cShe seems to be fine. She said her head only hurts around the stitched area.\u201d</p><p>His face turns red. His fists clench.</p><p>I start to wonder if he\u2019s going to be the next one throwing a punch at me. I\u2019m not worried for myself. I just want to prove to S\u2019belle that I can handle the situation. So if he wants to pound the shit out of me, I\u2019m going to let him. I need to make things right with her family, and although him throwing a punch at me isn\u2019t ideal, it\u2019s a start. I brace myself and fight the urge to retaliate.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to kill that motherfucker one day,\u201d he blurts out in a huff.</p><p>I let my tension release and nod in agreement. \u201cMy feelings exactly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had a bad feeling about him from the day I met him. I told Bell, but she always sees the good in people and couldn\u2019t see it.\u201d</p><p>I know there was a dig in there for me. I could hear it in his voice.</p><p>\u201cWhere is she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe fell asleep\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m right here.\u201d She pops up in the doorway fully dressed\u2014thank f**k.</p><p>\u201cYou woke up?\u201d I smile over at her.</p><p>Her eyes dart to my sweatshirt and she grins at me.</p><p>Xander crosses over to her and pulls her in for a tight embrace. He leans back to look at her forehead and hugs her again. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p><p>She nods.</p><p>\u201cYou sure?\u201d</p><p>I place my hand on the door as I witness what I already knew. This girl has been loved, protected, and sheltered her whole life by a family that adores her. There is no bad in her. She\u2019s good through and through. I wish I could say the same. A feeling that maybe she\u2019s too good for me makes my body tremble slightly. But when she looks over to me from her brother\u2019s arms and winks, my stomach leaps.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll leave the two of you to talk.\u201d</p><p>She pulls away from her brother and frowns at me.</p><p>\u201cI thought I\u2019d go grab some food.\u201d I quickly add, \u201cWhere is the closest Italian spot for takeout?\u201d</p><p>She smiles and her eyes gleam.</p><p>\u201cVito\u2019s. Around the corner on North La Cienega Boulevard,\u201d Xander says.</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d I turn the handle on the door.</p><p>\u201cHey, man,\u201d he says, and I turn around. \u201cThanks for taking care of my sister.\u201d</p><p>I nod and as I turn back I catch S\u2019belle\u2019s big green eyes shimmering with happiness.</p><p>CHAPTER 30</p><p>Roar</p><p>Bell</p><p>The thing about family is\u2014you can love them and dislike them at the same time, and right now I\u2019m torn at seeing Xander. I nod toward the dark clouds massing on the horizon. \u201cLooks like another storm is coming?\u201d</p><p>He huffs, \u201cI\u2019m not here to talk about the weather.\u201d</p><p>My brother\u2019s stare is fierce, but I know I can be fiercer, or at least I think I can.</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d I smile to lessen the tension.</p><p>His brow furrows as though he wants to say something but changes his mind.</p><p>\u201cI quit my job.\u201d</p><p>That earns me a smile.</p><p>\u201cFinally,\u201d he sighs with relief. \u201cYou know I never liked that guy. Bell, I understand you better than you think I do. I know you\u2019re determined to prove to us that you can make it on your own. But I came over here to tell you, the thing is, you don\u2019t have to.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I open and shut my mouth without coming up with a response.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re one of the lucky ones\u2014don\u2019t you get it? You have us. We\u2019re here for you.\u201d</p><p>He takes a step closer.</p><p>I breathe in, willing myself not to cry. \u201cI know that.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDo you? Do you really know that no matter what, we love you?\u2019</p><p>\u201cI do.\u201d My voice is a small squeak. So much for fierce.</p><p>\u201cThen the next time you\u2019re in a bad situation, I want you to tell me.\u201d He looks around the room before continuing.</p><p>\u201cAre we getting to the elephant in the room now?\u201d I stand up straight and face him head-on.</p><p>His expression grows darker and truth be told, I feel a little scared. Not of him, of course, rather of him judging me. But I believe in Ben and I\u2019m ready to take the first step. You have to crawl before you can walk, right? And Xander is going to be easier to open up to about Ben than River. So I take another deep breath. \u201cCan we sit down? I have some things to tell you, and the first one is something I should have cleared up a long time ago.\u201d</p> <p>We\u2019ve never spoken about the baby since the day I gave birth. But something inside me feels ready to open up to my brother in a way I\u2019ve never felt I could before. So I tell Xander that I actually never talked to Ben, that my attempts to contact him and tell him I was pregnant were really not attempts at all. I tell him about this summer and then meeting back up with Ben a couple of months ago. I tell him that I want to see where the relationship will go. I stay strong. I tell my brother how I feel. And surprisingly he handles it okay. He isn\u2019t thrilled, but he isn\u2019t disappointed in me either.</p><p>When I finish, his look is unreadable.</p><p>Then he reaches across the sofa to squeeze my shoulder. \u201cYou know all I really care about is that you\u2019re happy?\u201d</p><p>I nod.</p><p>\u201cAnd you know if you ever need me, no matter what the circumstances, I\u2019ll be there for you in a heartbeat?\u201d</p><p>I nod again. \u201cI love you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI love you too. Now I\u2019m going to get out of here.\u201d He grins at me.</p><p>I fly across the couch and hug him. \u201cI don\u2019t say this often, but you\u2019re the best brother\u2014ever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t tell River you said that,\u201d he jokes.</p><p>\u201cOh, I tell him the same thing.\u201d I laugh.</p><p>He just shakes his head at me in amusement.</p><p>After Xander leaves I hop in the shower. Then I decide a quick cleanup and a mood enhancer are just what we need for the night. Twenty minutes later there\u2019s a knock at my door.</p><p>\u201cWho is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s me, Ben.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBen who?\u201d</p><p>\u201cS\u2019belle.\u201d He sounds a little annoyed.</p><p>I\u2019m sure he\u2019s worried about what Xander had to say, so I cut him some slack. \u201cCome in.\u201d</p><p>He opens the door carrying bags of delicious-smelling Italian food. He looks around. I\u2019ve really outdone myself. Soft music is playing in the background, candles are lit around the room, and my green bikini is lying over the back of the sofa. He raises an eyebrow. \u201cD\u00e9j\u00e0 vu.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m in the kitchen slicing lemons with two glasses of sparkling water in front of me. I drop them in the glass and smile at him. \u201cYou didn\u2019t have to knock.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t sure if your brother was still here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope, he\u2019s gone.\u201d</p><p>He takes the bags and walks back out to close the door.</p><p>Did he forget something? There\u2019s another knock on the door. Now I\u2019m curious. I walk over and open the door just a smidge. \u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>He raises the bags. \u201cDelivery, ma\u2019am.\u201d He grins.</p><p>My smile grows wide and I throw open the door. \u201cCome in. You can set the bags on the counter, but I\u2019m not sure I have any money to pay you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMa\u2019am, I don\u2019t take cash anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, good, because after we eat I know just how to pay you back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfter?\u201d he questions.</p><p>\u201cYes, sorry, but I\u2019m starving.\u201d</p><p>He laughs. \u201cMe too.\u201d He crosses to the kitchen and deposits the bags on the table.</p><p>I can\u2019t restrain myself and I throw my arms his neck.</p><p>He pushes my wet hair to the side and kisses my neck while I press the weight of my body against him. \u201cYou smell so good,\u201d he says.</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t sure you\u2019d come back.\u201d</p><p>He takes my face in his hands as he reassures me, \u201cNothing would keep me away from you, even your brother camped outside the door.\u201d</p><p>I lick the lemon juice from my fingers while giggling. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t that bad.\u201d</p><p>He takes my hand and sucks one of my fingers still sticky with lemon juice. \u201cNo, he wasn\u2019t,\u201d he agrees, moving to the next one. \u201cIf I was looking to get my balls served on a platter, he\u2019d be just the guy I\u2019d go to.\u201d</p><p>The laughter is uncontrollable and I start hiccupping from the hysteria. Once I\u2019ve calmed I tell him, \u201cI called everyone else while you were gone, so we should be visitor free.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy everyone else I assume you mean your other brother, the one who isn\u2019t going to be even a fraction as unimpressed as his older brother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did you get us to eat?\u201d I ask, pressing against him in an attempt to change the otherwise awkward subject. And then before he can answer I lift my arms and snake them around his head. \u201cKiss me.\u201d</p><p>He finds my mouth and kisses me deeply before pulling away and walking over to the table, where he set the bags. He takes a round container out. \u201cSpaghetti and meatballs.\u201d He takes out another. \u201cChicken Parmesan.\u201d And then another. \u201cRigatoni.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYum, but are you feeding an army?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just wanted to make sure you were well fed.\u201d</p><p>I look up and catch his glance. His face looks perfectly content and I feel the same way.</p><p>CHAPTER 31</p><p>Start of Something</p><p>Ben</p><p>I have been with many women over the past three years, but I have never spent any real length of time in their places\u2014enough time to f**k and move on and that\u2019s been all. So to say lying on the couch with S\u2019belle and flipping through television channels after we\u2019ve both stuffed ourselves with pasta, garlic knots, and salad feels unfamiliar would be telling the truth. But in a sense there is something familiar about it, in terms of the only relationship I\u2019ve really ever had in my life, the one with Dahlia.</p><p>It isn\u2019t that I don\u2019t know how to be in a relationship, because obviously I do. I had been in one, the same one, for ten years. And I think for the majority of those years we were both happy together. But after that I have never wanted to seek out another relationship. It takes a lot of giving, and I think I have already proven to myself I am a taker. So why when I look at S\u2019belle lying in front of me do I feel that at last I have something to give?</p><p>The sound of the rain outside is calming even though my thoughts are swirling around my mind. I reach for the book on the coffee table, noticing that the bookmark is gone but the book itself still has a place on the table.</p><p>\u201cDid you finish this?\u201d I ask her.</p><p>She turns around. \u201cI did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did you think?\u201d</p><p>She smirks. \u201cThat I\u2019ll stick to romance novels.\u201d</p><p>I gently bump the book on her head. \u201cNo, really, what did you think?\u201d</p><p>Now she giggles.</p><p>My heart pounds a little faster whenever I hear that sound.</p><p>She sits up, waving her hand in front of her face until she settles. \u201cSorry, sometimes I\u2019m just so witty.\u201d</p><p>I withhold my own smirk at how f**king cute she is.</p><p>\u201cOkay, okay, so . . .\u201d She takes a deep breath. \u201cHere goes. At first I kept resisting the context, which made me dislike the book.\u201d</p><p>I raise an eyebrow. \u201cI did mention this is my favorite book. Didn\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>She pouts her lips. \u201cLet me finish.\u201d</p><p>I blink at her. \u201cI just had a vision of you as a teacher.\u201d</p><p>She bends down and kisses me. Running her tongue along the inside of my lip and then catching it with her teeth. \u201cI can be your teacher\u2014later.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m sure my eyes widen in delight.</p><p>\u201cNow let me finish.\u201d</p><p>Excitement starts to build within me because she\u2019s turning me on. \u201cPlease do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, so once I surrendered myself to the time frame and fictional virtuosities, the story finally captured my heart. I could picture a circus of events as everything came to life in my mind.\u201d</p><p>I raise my hand like the good student I never was.</p><p>She squares her shoulders. \u201cYes, Ben, you have a question.\u201d</p><p>I bite my lip to keep from laughing. She really would be a good teacher if I ever gave her that control. \u201cCan you explain what you mean by fictional virtuosities?\u201d</p><p>The corners of her lips tilt up. \u201cI can tell you\u2019re surprised. Believe it or not, I paid attention in school.\u201d</p><p>My laughter rasps. \u201cI believe it.\u201d</p><p>She continues. \u201cA variety of personalities are portrayed in the text, including children who are smart, women who are full of grit, strong old ladies, men with confidence, fools, drunks. The book is just a cornucopia of complex characters.\u201d</p><p>To be honest I am rightfully impressed, but I continue to play along with our little charade. \u201cSo you enjoyed it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStudents\u2019 hands should always be raised.\u201d</p><p>I pull her to me to say, \u201cI thought we were doing this later, but if you\u2019re ready, I think we should take it to the bedroom, where I can show you just the kind of student I am.\u201d</p><p>She nods, breathing heavy, and then pulls the strings of the sweatshirt I\u2019m wearing and yanks me up toward her. \u201cYou found your sweatshirt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought it looked familiar. Was it your choice of contraband sweatshirts back then?\u201d</p><p>She pushes me to the couch cushion and tries to hold my arms down, but fast as lightning I flip her on her back and pin her wrists above her head. \u201cAre we moving from student/teacher to submissive/dominant? Because I\u2019m up for that too,\u201d I growl. A rush of arousal floods me at the thought of tying her down.</p><p>Her eyes burn into mine, lust looming in their depths. \u201cAre you staying tonight?\u201d Pressing my raging hard-on into her belly, I return her stare. \u201cI didn\u2019t realize there was a question as to whether I would.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKiss me,\u201d she purrs, and ignores my statement.</p><p>\u201cYou understand I\u2019m the dominant, right? That means I take control, not you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKiss me, please,\u201d she repeats.</p><p>And I do that and so much more.</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>I stare at her for the longest time, trying not to breathe so as not to wake her. She stirs and flips around. Fuck me, my c**k lies pressed against her ass and I don\u2019t know if she\u2019s awake and doing it on purpose or if she\u2019s sleeping.</p><p>I kiss her head and slide my leg off the bed. Obviously not on purpose since she doesn\u2019t stir.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d she asks. So\u2014maybe on purpose.</p><p>Before leaving the room, I bend down and kiss her head. \u201cI\u2019m going to go get us some coffee.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh God, I love you,\u201d she says sleepily.</p><p>I freeze on the spot, but she doesn\u2019t say another word as she settles her head into the pillow and falls back asleep.</p><p>I pass her comment off as what it was, gratitude for much-needed coffee, but I can\u2019t keep her words from echoing in my head the whole drive to Starbucks and back. Love is the last thing I\u2019m looking for right now. I just got myself together and I\u2019m not looking for overly serious.</p><p>When I walk back into her apartment, I check my thoughts at the door the minute I see the green bikini still lying on the back of the sofa. I pick it up and with my tray of coffees I head into the bedroom, but she\u2019s not in the bed. I hear the shower and walk into the bathroom. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Setting everything down, I lean against the wall to look at her through the steamed glass. The shape of her perky br**sts, the curves of her perfect-sized ass, and the contour of her legs couldn\u2019t be more defined. I find myself biting my lip as she lifts her arms and scrubs her hair, then squeezes body wash into her palms and rubs it along her body, but when her hands rub circles across her tits, I can\u2019t suppress a groan.</p><p>She opens the door and peeks out from the shower. \u201cAre you watching me?\u201d</p><p>I pick up my coffee cup and sip from it. \u201cI was going to join you, but you looked so good from here I got caught up in the show.\u201d</p><p>She shrugs. \u201cFinish your coffee.\u201d</p> <p>Fuck, I almost choke. How could anyone not love her? I go back to watching and sipping my coffee. But the minute she lets her fingers wander to her pu**y, I have to jump in. \u201cI\u2019ll do that.\u201d</p><p>The shower water is hot, but nothing feels hotter than the feel of her skin against mine. I can\u2019t get enough of her. We\u2019ve spent two days together, had sex more times than I\u2019ve had with any one person in a forty-eight-hour window of time, and I still want more.</p><p>\u201cThe water\u2019s getting cold,\u201d she whispers to me.</p><p>I reach to pull the lever and turn it off. \u201cWe\u2019re clean enough.\u201d</p><p>She shivers and I reach for some towels, wrapping one around her shoulders and then dropping to my knees to pat her body dry. Once her legs are dry, I make my way up her body to the areas I want to concentrate on the most\u2014the silky skin between her legs and her br**sts. When I stand back up, I wring the water from her hair and take a moment to stare at her. \u201cLeave your hair curly today.\u201d</p> <p>She nods. Her palms are flush to the tile wall and her chest is visibly rising and falling.</p><p>So I drop back down to my knees and flick my tongue against her clit. Clutching her ass, I pull her closer to me. I work my mouth eagerly, loving the feel of her beneath my tongue, the taste of her, how wet she is. Her hands clasp my head and I can feel the muscles in her legs tighten. I clutch her ass tighter as I consume every inch of her sweet pu**y. Tension coils in my own body. But the sounds she makes practically make me come on the spot\u2014her stuttered sighs followed by her soft moans that become louder as she calls out my name.</p><p>She looks down into my eyes as she comes, and the picture is one of perfect bliss.</p><p>Afterward I slide up her body and bend to kiss her. My hands move slow and easy over her flesh. My lips press softly against hers. \u201cDid I say good morning?\u201d</p><p>Her eyes catch mine, and a fierce glimmer of light shines in them. \u201cGood morning,\u201d she says, a little breathless.</p><p>In a move that takes me by surprise, she pushes me back against the shower wall and drops to her knees. I close my eyes at the feel of her warm breath against my already bulging cock. The one thing we haven\u2019t done, she hasn\u2019t done this weekend, is suck me off. I haven\u2019t asked. I haven\u2019t pushed. I wanted her to be the one to decide. Before S\u2019belle I had always been a taker, but with her I want to give.</p> <p>Her lips wrap around my tip and I tremble at the first contact. She draws me in an inch at a time steadying herself by holding on to my thighs. A grunt I didn\u2019t mean to make leaves my throat. I open my eyes to watch her\u2014watch as her hand moves from my thigh to fist my base and her tongue flicks down my hard cock. I suck in air at how good it feels. Fuck me! My legs are shaking by now.</p><p>I hiss out the air I forgot to exhale. \u201cFuckkkk.\u201d</p><p>I can feel her lips form a smile, but she doesn\u2019t stop.</p><p>There\u2019s another harsh intake of breath when my c**k hits the back of her throat. I\u2019m not even sure it\u2019s me standing here right now. I feel as if I\u2019m watching this sweet girl blow me in a way no one ever has.</p><p>I put my hands in her hair.</p><p>Her eyes flick up.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so f**king beautiful,\u201d I mutter.</p><p>With her palms now flat on my hips, she takes me all the way in until her lips brush my stomach and then she slowly drags them back. She does this again, sucking a little harder. And again\u2014stopping to suck the head of my penis.</p> <p>\u201cS\u2019belle.\u201d I moan her name as I push my h*ps forward.</p><p>Her response is to fist my base again, but this time her hand follows her mouth\u2019s trail and overwhelming sensations after sensation start to race through my body.</p><p>Never feeling this sexually possessed by a woman in my life, I struggle to maintain my control as the pleasure flares through my body, but when her other hand cups my balls and her tongue trails along the underside of my cock, I give in to it and let it devour me whole.</p><p>\u201cS\u2019belle,\u201d I scream. \u201cI\u2019m going to come.\u201d</p><p>I give her a warning through gritted teeth, letting her decide what comes next. When she doesn\u2019t pull, I thrust into her, trying not to push too far or too hard so I don\u2019t choke her, but f**k, control left me a while ago. Warmth floods my body as my orgasm hits unlike anything I can remember. An animalistic cry I don\u2019t recognize as my own leaves my mouth as my c**k throbs against her tongue. Her warm mouth stays wrapped around me even after I\u2019ve come. I slip my hands under her arms and when she slides her lips down my c**k she stops to suck on my tip one last time, causing a shudder to chase down my spine.</p><p>When I pull her to her feet, blinking uncontrollably at her while clasping her arms to steady myself, I stare at her, unable to speak for the longest time. She licks her lips with her tongue and I take my thumb and wipe them for her.</p><p>My thoughts finally clear and I steady myself in front of her. \u201cWow.\u201d It\u2019s the only lame word that comes to mind, but there are so many more phrases catching in my throat\u2014words like best bl*w j*b I\u2019ve ever had, you\u2019re f**king amazing, I want to feel that over and over, but they all seem to belittle what just took place.</p><p>My hands glide down her n*ked body and I hold her as tight as I can for a long time. When she shivers I know she\u2019s cold and I pull away to gather the towels we discarded earlier.</p><p>\u201cLift your arms.\u201d</p><p>As soon as she does I wrap the towel around her and draw her to me again so I can kiss her on the lips, soft and gentle. The kiss quickly deepens as I suck on her tongue, her lip until neither of us can breathe and I pull away with a quick kiss above her bandage before I do.</p><p>\u201cWe need to change that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to.\u201d</p><p>She points to the supplies the hospital gave her behind me on the counter.</p><p>When I turn to retrieve them, I spot her green bikini. I turn back to get her attention. \u201cCome to Laguna with me today. We have to get your car anyway and I really need to shave.\u201d</p><p>She rubs her fingers over my face. \u201cI like the way your face feels against my skin.\u201d</p><p>My pulse races. This girl is going to kill me. \u201cOh yeah, where particularly do you like the way it feels?\u201d</p><p>She points to her lips. \u201cHere.\u201d And then she points between her legs. \u201cAnd here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck, you\u2019re hot as hell.\u201d</p><p>She shrugs. \u201cJust being honest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened to the shy girl under the sheets yesterday morning who wasn\u2019t sure she could tell me what she wanted during the day?\u201d</p><p>Her eyes meet mine. \u201cYou helped with that phobia pretty quickly.\u201d</p><p>I laugh and pat her bandage. \u201cThere, all done.\u201d</p><p>She laughs. \u201cThanks for the help.\u201d</p><p>I bow and say, \u201cMy pleasure.\u201d</p><p>A look I can\u2019t quite decipher crosses her face, but she doesn\u2019t say anything. And I don\u2019t ask but instead hand her the green bikini. \u201cI\u2019m going to see you in this one way or another, and since I\u2019m taking you to Laguna today, I want you to wear this under your clothes,\u201d I growl in her ear.</p><p>She playfully pushes me backward. \u201cI didn\u2019t say I\u2019d go home with you.\u201d</p><p>I feel a corner of my mouth turn up. \u201cI have food, lots of food, at my place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can be ready in ten minutes.\u201d</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>What you can learn about a person in a short period of time when you pay attention astounds me. I\u2019ve learned so much about S\u2019belle Wilde over the past couple of months and even more in this block of time we\u2019ve spent together. I\u2019ve learned she loves to eat but never keeps food in her apartment\u2014I\u2019m pretty sure she doesn\u2019t like to eat alone. I\u2019ve learned she\u2019s really smart and thinks long and hard about things\u2014but likes to come across as being more aloof or maybe even scatterbrained. Which she\u2019s neither. I\u2019ve learned she likes sex dirty and she likes it clean. And I\u2019ve learned she knows how to turn me on and she does it on purpose.</p><p>I glance over at her fingers as they tap the screen of her phone. \u201cDid you check in with your mother?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s texted me every four hours around the clock. I told her I\u2019m spending the day at the beach and Xander and River too. I don\u2019t want them to hunt me down.\u201d</p><p>I laugh. \u201cOr me.\u201d</p><p>She laughs back. \u201cThat too.\u201d</p><p>I reach out to caress her bare leg. She\u2019s wearing a pair of denim shorts with an eighties type of sweatshirt that hangs off her shoulder, exposing the golden threads of her bikini top. My heart beats a little faster at the thought of finally seeing her stand in front of me in it\u2014just the bikini top, that is, nothing else. I quickly chase the thought away.</p><p>\u201cI need to give Josie a heads-up too,\u201d she says, tapping her fingers on her phone again. \u201cShe\u2019ll be worried when I don\u2019t show up for work tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s Wyatt\u2019s assistant, right?\u201d</p><p>She looks up at me from over her sunglasses. \u201cYes. So you do pay attention.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think I don\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>She looks back down. \u201cNo. I just wonder how much people hear when I talk because sometimes I feel like I never shut up.\u201d</p><p>I smirk at her\u2014she\u2019s definitely quirky and it\u2019s a breath of fresh air from all of the other women I\u2019ve known. \u201cSpeaking of work, I wanted to ask you something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d she says, dropping her phone in the cup holder and twisting in my direction.</p><p>\u201cThe night Wyatt saw me at Beck\u2019s he was with that arrogant SOB.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRomeo?\u201d</p><p>I nod and go for broke. \u201cHe told me he\u2019d seen your phone, that he saw a message from me. Why would you show him that?\u201d</p><p>She frowns and reaches up to brush some fallen hair out of my eyes. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t like that.\u201d</p><p>I glance over and lift her sunglasses so I can see into her eyes; the green is even deeper than usual with the sunlight streaming through the window. \u201cWhat was it like, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do you hate him?\u201d Her voice is soft and full of curiosity.</p><p>My fingers tighten back around the wheel. \u201cFor a shit ton of reasons. Because he was captain of the football team and I was a surfer, because he lived on the bluff and I lived on the beach, because he was a jock and I was . . . well, I was more of a rebel, I guess, but most of all because from what I saw that night he\u2019s still a prick.\u201d</p><p>A laugh bursts from her. \u201cI think that has to be one of the most honest responses anyone has ever given me.\u201d</p><p>I shake my head at her and grab her hand.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s true.\u201d</p><p>I raise an eyebrow. \u201cYou haven\u2019t answered my question.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not interested in him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t say you were.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but I can tell what you\u2019re thinking. You\u2019re not going to like this, but I was late for work and when I got there Josie pulled me into the break room. I set all my stuff down, including my phone, and to make a long story short, Tate and Romeo came looking for me and since we use the break room as a meeting room sometimes, I left Romeo in there while I grabbed something from my office. You texted me and he saw the text.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee, he\u2019s a prick,\u201d I mutter under my breath. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She leans over and kisses my lips. \u201cI\u2019m not interested in him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019ve said.\u201d</p><p>Her hand runs up the leg of my jeans. \u201cI am interested in you, though.\u201d</p><p>I flick her a glance and the honesty I see in her expression puts a smile on my face\u2014and her touch, well, it\u2019s doing exactly what she intended. Trying to push sex out of my mind for a bit, I say, \u201cTell me something about you that I don\u2019t know.\u201d</p> <p>She picks up her phone, looks at the screen, then drops it in her bag before pulling her sunglasses down from atop her head and back onto her face. When I hop on the freeway she presses the button for the window and it slides down. She inhales as the wind blows her mass of red curls all around her face. Then she turns back to me. \u201cI love the feel of the wind in my face. I love riding on the back of your bike. And I love the Santa Anas.\u201d</p><p>The sun is shining today and the winds have died down, but they\u2019re still stronger than on a typical day. She points out the window to the smoldering smoke in the distance. \u201cBut I hate the destruction they cause.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know surfers think of them as heaven and hell mixed in one?\u201d</p><p>She cocks her head in my direction. \u201cDo explain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen they hit the surf head-on they hold up falling lips and hollow out pitching waves, making for an unbelievable ride. They turn reef breaks into emerald green tube-riding playgrounds. It\u2019s f**king awesome. But at the same time they can knock a foot or so off any incoming swell and can actually flatten an otherwise small but rideable wave. That f**king sucks.\u201d</p> <p>She smiles at me. \u201cYou really love surfing, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I do. I hated living in LA and not on the beach. It really made me miserable.\u201d</p><p>She seems to ponder this for a long time.</p><p>\u201cBut I was asking about you. Tell me something else I don\u2019t know about you.\u201d</p><p>My fingers caress circles on her leg and she glances down. \u201cI used to think I had superpowers.\u201d</p><p>A huge grin crosses my face. \u201cOh yeah?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s stupid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou tell me and then I\u2019ll tell you how I used think I was Aquaman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAquaman?\u201d she squeaks.</p><p>I shake my head and shift my eyes her way. \u201cYou first.\u201d</p><p>She inhales a deep breath. \u201cDon\u2019t laugh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t promise that. But, S\u2019belle . . .\u201d</p><p>Her eyes cut to mine.</p><p>\u201cYou . . .\u201d I stop, not sure of what I want to say or how to say it. \u201cYou know what, never mind. I promise to try my damnedest not to laugh.\u201d</p> <p>She narrows her eyes at me.</p><p>I pinch her leg. \u201cI said I promise.\u201d</p><p>She jumps in her seat at my touch.</p><p>\u201cAh . . . I think you might be ticklish.\u201d</p><p>She grabs my hand. \u201cI\u2019ll never tell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to.\u201d I grin and pull her hand to my lips to kiss it.</p><p>\u201cOkay, so when I was little I noticed that I could mix words up or say things I knew didn\u2019t make sense and people would give me what I wanted.\u201d</p><p>I nod, thinking about what\u2019s she\u2019s saying.</p><p>\u201cAs I got older it worked even better. One time just after I got my license, I got pulled over for speeding. I honestly didn\u2019t know I was speeding. The police officer asked if I knew how fast I was going. I answered that I was going sixty. He stared at me. I said, \u2018Sir, my car won\u2019t go any faster than that unless I really jam the gas down, so I\u2019m sorry if I was going too slow.\u2019 He looked at me flabbergasted but only gave me a warning and explained I had crossed into a residential area and three miles ahead the speed limit would increase again.\u201d</p><p>Clutching her hand on top of her leg, I roll my eyes at her. \u201cHe just thought you were cute.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, really it was my silver tongue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour silver tongue?\u201d I burst out laughing and drop her hand to cover my mouth.</p><p>She sits up straighter. \u201cYes, I used to believe my superpower was that I had a silver tongue.\u201d</p><p>My mind wanders back to sex at that comment, but she doesn\u2019t seem to notice and continues with her anecdotes about her silver tongue. When it\u2019s my turn I tell her my story about how I really believed I could grow gills and breathe underwater if I stayed in the ocean long enough. She laughs just as hard at me as I did at her.</p><p>CHAPTER 32</p><p>Burn</p><p>Bell</p><p>The glorious Pacific and the serene Catalina Island on the horizon are the only view from the floor-to-ceiling windows in the living room. A hand-forged copper-shingled roof engineered by a master shipbuilder to weather the worst of storms protects it. Ben\u2019s house, built on the bluff and jetting out over the ocean, looks like a physical paean to light, sky, and sea. I can make out sweeping views of the city and the surf breaking on the coastline.</p><p>He\u2019d told me all about it, but nothing could have prepared me for how beautiful it is in person. I look over at him. \u201cThis is supernice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks. I haven\u2019t lived here that long, but it really feels like home.\u201d</p><p>A sadness washes over me when I see the waves rolling onto the shore.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d he yells.</p><p>\u201cTo see the beach up close.\u201d</p><p>He chases after me around the side of the house and down to the back.</p><p>I kick my shoes off as soon as I hit the sand and look out into the calmness of the sea.</p><p>He catches up with me and grabs my hips. \u201cYou\u2019re crazy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I just love the beach. My dad used to take us all the time when we were kids. He\u2019d put the Beach Boys on in the car and sing along and eventually we all joined in.\u201d</p><p>He dips his head and skims the skin of my neck with his tongue. \u201cDo you miss your dad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSometimes I do. Sometimes I don\u2019t. The good times blend with the bad and it\u2019s hard to figure out which were more real.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry for what you had to go through when your dad died. My dad died when I was really young too and I don\u2019t really remember that much either,\u201d he says.</p><p>I look up at him and that\u2019s when I see it in his eyes. The same look I\u2019ve seen before but haven\u2019t been able to place. I think it\u2019s a longing for family. The thought makes me even sadder.</p><p>\u201cHow do you know how my dad died?\u201d I\u2019m not upset, just curious. I really never talk about it.</p><p>He scratches his head. \u201cI did some research earlier this year for Aerie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of research?\u201d</p><p>His silence has started to alarm me. \u201cBen, what kind of research?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know what? I think you should talk to your mom. I shouldn\u2019t have said anything.\u201d He says it delicately, not angrily, but his refusal to tell me something about my own family still stings.</p><p>\u201cBen,\u201d I plead. \u201cTell me now.\u201d</p><p>He grabs my hand. \u201cCome on, let\u2019s walk and I\u2019ll explain.\u201d</p><p>I nod and try to hide that my heart is beating abnormally fast with worry.</p><p>He leads us up the steps to a deck that looks out onto the ocean, offering a perfect view. I take a seat in one of the lounge chairs, pulling my legs up and tucking my chin on my knees, and he does the same.</p><p>Ben squints into the sun. I can tell he\u2019s teetering on whether to tell me what he knows or not.</p><p>\u201cBen, please.\u201d I say his name softly, prompting him to tell me what he knows.</p><p>He takes a deep breath. \u201cI was investigating Sheep Industries\u2019 finances for a story Aerie had me working on after I left the paper this past summer and I came across books for Little Red Records.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy father\u2019s label before they let him go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes\u2014Little Red is one of the holdings of Sheep Industries. Anyway, what we found proved the sales records had been severely altered and that he was let go under false pretenses.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo who altered the records? Damon Wolf?\u201d</p><p>He sits up and leans toward me with his arms on his thighs. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause he was jealous of my father?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know the answer to that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes my family know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cS\u2019belle, I don\u2019t really know who knows what. I only know what Damon told me the day I yanked Sound Music from his hands.\u201d</p><p>I stand up and head toward his glass doors. \u201cHow about a tour?\u201d</p><p>He pulls me onto his lap, his arms banding around me. \u201cHey, what\u2019s going through your mind?\u201d</p><p>I swallow a few times as I start to cry. \u201cThat my father spent his whole life chasing the dream of being famous, and he thought he lost his chance, but in reality he never lost it. Someone stole it from him. Why would anyone do that?\u201d My cries grow louder.</p><p>He cradles me in his arms. \u201cBecause so many people in the world don\u2019t understand what it is like to be good.\u201d</p><p>I bury my face in his neck. \u201cI failed him, you know?\u201d</p><p>He lifts my chin to look into my eyes. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe day he killed himself all he wanted me to do was get better at playing the guitar. I hated playing. I was never any good at it. He picked me up early from school that day. Xander always got me. When I asked him why he was there, he had a haunted look in his eyes. He told me he wanted to have more time for us to practice, but I knew something wasn\u2019t right. Then when I couldn\u2019t do what he wanted, he made me do it over and over. Xander came home and heard me crying, saw my fingers bleeding from strumming the strings over and over. My father and Xander argued and River brought me to the neighbor\u2019s house. All I knew after that was that my father had shot himself. My brother blamed himself for the longest time\u2014and I think he still might\u2014but if I hadn\u2019t failed my father they wouldn\u2019t have fought and my father might still be alive.\u201d</p><p>He holds me, rocks me, soothes me but doesn\u2019t judge. \u201cS\u2019belle, what happened is not your fault. Your father was in a bad place.\u201d</p><p>I shake my head no. Why couldn\u2019t I just do what he wanted?</p><p>\u201cHey, look at me.\u201d His voice grows louder. \u201cThere is nothing but good inside you. You should never think anything different. Your family loves you so much. It\u2019s evident by the lengths any of them would go to protect you.\u201d</p><p>He holds me for the longest time. Silence fits comfortably between us as the only sounds I hear are the ocean, the sky, and his breathing\u2014all of which calm me down. I know he\u2019s right. I\u2019ve been through this so many times. I\u2019m sure that\u2019s why my family didn\u2019t tell me. I\u2019m not even upset that they didn\u2019t. I know Xander and River and my mother must feel the burden of the information and they didn\u2019t want me to carry it too.</p><p>I don\u2019t blame them for not telling me what they had learned. The truth is it\u2019s over, but in a way it makes me proud that although he\u2019ll never know it\u2014my father did succeed.</p><p>Once my internal emotional battle settles, I pull away and smooth my hands down his face, but I see that his face looks haunted too. \u201cWhat are you not telling me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cS\u2019belle,\u201d he says hoarsely, and I feel that this conversation has stirred up something. \u201cI\u2019ve never said this out loud to another person before. But I think my father killed himself and made it look like an accident and I think my mother knew. That\u2019s why she never told us his body was found or about the settlement money.\u201d</p><p>Our eyes meet and my heart splits open at his confession. The emotion that echoes the loudest is written on his face. He had already told me that his father was hanged by a sail rope that was said to have malfunctioned, leaving his mother with a ten-million-dollar settlement payout. But now he has chosen to confide in me with what he believes is the truth behind the accident. \u201cWhy would you think that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen I was going through some old papers, I found his business bank statements and foreclosure notices. I think his business was collapsing and the need to take care of his family drove him to it.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>We sit with our arms wrapped around each other for a long while.</p><p>When he pulls away, I know he\u2019s had time to compose himself, but I didn\u2019t mind seeing that side of him\u2014in fact, I liked knowing we\u2019re both a little frayed.</p><p>He clears his throat. \u201cHey, I\u2019ve never told anyone my theory. It\u2019s just what I think, but I\u2019m telling you now because I believe everyone makes their own choices and your father, my father, they made theirs. Don\u2019t blame yourself. Your father wouldn\u2019t want that. Is that why you didn\u2019t quit when Wyatt\u2019s harassing started?

Do you hear me?\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m still nodding, but words escape me.</p><p>Suddenly the sliding door flies open. \u201cYou finally decided to come home,\u201d Trent yells, and stops in his tracks when sees us. \u201cOh, f**k, sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d Ben whispers in my ear.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I whisper back. I wipe away my tears and stand. \u201cHi, you must be Trent.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd you must be Bell.\u201d He grins and his eyes, just like Ben\u2019s, rove over me from head to toe.</p><p>Ben stands up and walks over to him, knocking the side of his head.</p><p>He rubs it with hand. \u201cWhat was that for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know what it was for, kid.\u201d</p><p>I giggle. Like uncle, like nephew. Isn\u2019t that a saying?</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m leaving at five to go back to college, so I wanted to stop by and say good-bye.\u201d</p> <p>Ben looks at him with a pride I find endearing. \u201cYou know I hate to say this, but I\u2019m going to miss you.\u201d</p><p>Trent snickers. \u201cI\u2019m starving. You making lunch?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I\u2019m starving too and you did promise food,\u201d I remind him.</p><p>\u201cI make a mean stir-fry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVegetables?\u201d I make a face.</p><p>\u201cI ate Chinese for two days with Uncle Caleb while you disappeared.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t disappear. And where\u2019s Caleb anyway?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe left you a note. It\u2019s in the kitchen.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s it say? That he loves me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, that he\u2019s pining away for you,\u201d Trent jokes. \u201cNo, I guess something came up at work, because he was called back early. He said he\u2019d be in touch when he could.\u201d</p><p>Ben pats the pocket of his jeans and then shrugs. \u201cHe could have called me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe both decided we didn\u2019t want to bother you.\u201d</p><p>He taps his head again. I like seeing this side of Ben with his family.</p><p>\u201cCut it out or I\u2019m telling Bell how I had to tell you how to find her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, do tell,\u201d I say.</p><p>Ben glares at Trent and takes my hand. \u201cI owe this beautiful lady a tour. When I\u2019m done I\u2019ll run out and get us some flatbreads from the Loft.\u201d</p><p>Inside, Trent flops on the large sofa and grabs the remote. \u201cSounds awesome.\u201d</p><p>The entire place is stunning, but my eyes keep going back to the towering ficus tree. \u201cIt\u2019s beautiful,\u201d I comment as we climb the stairs that lead to the second-floor balcony.</p><p>Ben follows me, hooking his finger in my belt loop and staying very close. I like him there. I reach the top stair and turn around. \u201cEverything here is perfect. I can see why you can call it home so quickly. This place reminds me why I hate my apartment.\u201d</p><p>He steps up so that we are nose to nose. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s so small and claustrophobic. My living room only has two windows, one door, very little direct sunlight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can understand that. Why don\u2019t you move?\u201d</p><p>I crane my head toward the skylight above us. \u201cI thought I just hated living alone. I never understood why . . . until now.\u201d</p><p>His hands coast down my sides. \u201cLet me show you my room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease do but remember your nephew is downstairs.\u201d I wave my finger back and forth. \u201cSo no monkey business.\u201d But honestly I want him, all of him. Now. But I know we have to wait.</p><p>\u201cLike that\u2019s what I had in mind,\u201d he says as if appalled, and tugs my hand.</p><p>I squeeze his\u2014hard.</p><p>The door is open, so he steps aside. I walk in and scan the gallery of graffiti-style artwork that lines the walls. It\u2019s just how I\u2019d have pictured his room to be. \u201cI love it. It\u2019s so you.\u201d</p><p>As he laughs he starts walking us toward the bed. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe whole place screams low-key beach living, but it\u2019s also got style.\u201d</p><p>Turning me around, with his body pressed against mine, he lowers us to the bed and hovers over me. \u201cGo on.\u201d</p><p>I look up into his eyes, smell his familiar scent, feel his body, and I know\u2014I have fallen for him. I try to control my crazy emotions. We haven\u2019t known each other long enough for me to be feeling like this. But the pull I feel toward him is so much stronger than what I felt in college, so much stronger than I\u2019ve felt for anyone.</p><p>\u201cEarth to S\u2019belle, earth to S\u2019belle. Have you gone to heaven?\u201d he laughs.</p><p>I smirk at him and try to shove him away, but he doesn\u2019t move. \u201cI don\u2019t know. I feel like it has a barefoot, carefree beach vibe that is all you.\u201d</p><p>His mouth finds mine. \u201cI\u2019ve never had a girl in my room before.\u201d</p><p>My breathing picks up. \u201cYou\u2019ve already got me on your bed. You don\u2019t need to feed me any lines.\u201d</p><p>He raises himself up on his forearms. \u201cI\u2019m not. I\u2019ve never had anyone here with me. In fact, until you I haven\u2019t been with anyone since March and I certainly never took anyone to heaven in these sheets,\u201d he adds with the biggest, baddest, devilish grin.</p><p>I laugh hard and long because if I don\u2019t I might confess the depth of my feelings for him.</p><p>\u201cSpend the night here with me tonight. Be my first.\u201d</p><p>I grab his face in that way I know drives him crazy and crush my lips to his. I want to taste his mouth, feel his tongue, touch his body for hours. I want to hear him call my name.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m starving and I have to go soon, so could you hurry it up?\u201d Trent calls from downstairs.</p><p>Panting, I smile up at him.</p><p>He shakes his head. \u201cI\u2019d kick his ass out if he wasn\u2019t leaving today.\u201d</p><p>I lift myself onto my elbows. \u201cI\u2019d love to spend the night.\u201d</p><p>He hops off the bed and we head back downstairs. Ben goes out to grab food while I sit down with Trent and talk about college and Hawaii. Before I know it we\u2019re in Ben\u2019s office at his computer and I\u2019m showing Trent just how to accomplish one of his biggest wishes.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d Ben\u2019s voice carries from the door as he eyes us curiously.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s f**king awesome,\u201d Trent says enthusiastically.</p><p>\u201cYeah, she is but tell me what specifically makes you say that,\u201d he says with a smirk on his face.</p><p>\u201cSo, you know how I never know what time of day is optimal to hit the waves until the morning tide rolls in?\u201d</p><p>Ben nods and moves closer to the desk.</p><p>\u201cWell, Bell took all the factors I use to determine when I want to ride and developed a formula she\u2019s going to use to create an app that can forecast over the next week the optimal times of day to hit the surf at whichever beach is selected.\u201d</p><p>He rounds the desk to stand behind me. His hands rest on my shoulders, squeezing them in the most delicious way. When I turn my head he\u2019s staring at the screen in amazement. I feel a slight sense of pride that I could put that look on his face.</p><p>\u201cI already knew you had a talent with apps, but you never told me you were a math whiz,\u201d he says.</p><p>I shrug. \u201cI was a biology major. Math was just a prerequisite.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s f**king brilliant,\u201d Trent says in awe.</p><p>\u201cThat and so much more,\u201d Ben responds.</p><p>\u201cCome on, let\u2019s eat. I\u2019m starving.\u201d</p><p>Ben\u2019s eyes devour me as if I\u2019m what\u2019s for lunch\u2014and the way he looks at me makes me wish I was.</p><p>As soon as we\u2019ve finished eating, we say good-bye to Trent and then both fall on the couch in a post-meal stupor. Naps on Sundays are the best. But naps in Ben\u2019s arms, on a sofa that is beyond comfortable, with a view of the ocean, well, that\u2019s almost heaven\u2014almost.</p><p>The ocean calms the chaotic and tames the wild in anyone who dares allow it. And I do. And I can tell Ben does.</p><p>When we wake up, the sun is just starting to set and he builds a bonfire on the beach so we can sit eating s\u2019mores for dinner while we talk and listen to the sound of the waves as time slows around us. At first we merely kiss and touch each other, but once the touches intensify, we hastily take our clothes off. I even prance around him in my bikini\u2014finally. And with only my top on, we have sex in the sand near the fire.</p><p>The entire night is magical in a way I\u2019ve never experienced. Eventually we make our way to his room and he takes me in his bed too. Afterward he holds me tight as I nod off with the same calm I felt on the beach when I first arrived.</p><p>CHAPTER 33</p><p>Best Day of My Life</p><p>Ben</p><p>My alarm goes off way too early. The sun is just beginning to rise.</p><p>\u201cWhat time is it?\u201d She pulls the sheet over her head.</p><p>\u201cSix,\u201d I say, flopping back on the bed.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s illegal.\u201d</p><p>I laugh. \u201cWhat is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGetting up at six in the morning.\u201d</p><p>I shift to my side and press against her before lifting the sheet to find her head so I can nuzzle her neck. \u201cTake a shower with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s too early to get up.\u201d</p><p>To persuade her, I run my hands down her sides and across her h*ps to settle between her legs. Her body jerks and she moans. My fingers play with her folds. She tries to act as though she\u2019s going back to sleep, but her movements give away her excitement.</p><p>I dip a finger inside her. \u201cTake a shower with me.\u201d</p><p>She doesn\u2019t answer, but her body does as it arches in response to my touch. I plunge another finger inside her and go deeper. My other hand fondles one of her br**sts. Then just like that, I take my hands sway and slide out of bed. \u201cShower with me.\u201d</p><p>She lifts the covers off her head. \u201cYou play dirty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have no idea.\u201d I\u2019m sure my grin tells her how much I love getting up in the morning and getting ready for work like this.</p><p>By seven we\u2019re both dressed and drinking coffee out on the deck.</p><p>\u201cYou can stay here today.\u201d</p><p>She draws in a deep breath. \u201cI have to get home and figure out what I\u2019m going to do with my life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d I ask, raising an eyebrow, thinking that\u2019s a little deep for the morning when the girl sitting across from me is not a morning person.</p><p>\u201cMy own event-planning business isn\u2019t going anywhere and Josie tells me Tate plans to blacklist me from every big event.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou talked to her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe texted me back last night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid she say anything else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, only that Tate contacted her and told her to clean out my desk first thing in the morning, that he had fired me for insubordination.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck him. And you don\u2019t know for sure that he\u2019ll blackball you.\u201d</p><p>She shrugs. \u201cI\u2019m sure he will if he can. Besides, honestly my own business has turned into more of a catering company than an event-planning one. And the truth is, I enjoyed the whole thing more when I did it for fun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome work for me.\u201d The words just come out without any forethought or warning.</p><p>She quirks a smile and turns to look out toward the ocean. \u201cRight!\u201d</p><p>I reach across the table and turn her head to face me. Planned or not, it\u2019s a great idea. \u201cI\u2019m serious. You\u2019re brilliant. I need someone like you. My goal is to bring my publications into the modern era. Beck is working on the technical side of things\u2014development, computer support, links, servers. But I need someone who can handle the social media. You\u2019d be perfect.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t even have a college degree.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, stop selling yourself short. Come in today. Spend the day with me. Tell me what you think at the end of it. If you don\u2019t like it, no harm, no foul.\u201d</p><p>She takes her hand in mine, kissing each finger one at a time in the most provocative way. \u201cIf you\u2019re my boss does that mean we can\u2019t . . . you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes.\u201d She drops her chin.</p><p>I lift it and lean across the table to whisper in her ear, \u201cBaby, it means absolutely no such thing.\u201d</p><p>Her smile grows bright and with a lift of her shoulder she says, \u201cOkay, I\u2019ll give it a try.\u201d</p><p>An hour later I\u2019m sitting at my desk waiting for her feeling a little nervous. On one hand, I think her talent is a match, just what I need. On the other hand, I can\u2019t get her off my mind and having her close isn\u2019t going to help that at all. I can\u2019t forget the weekend\u2014threading my fingers in her hair, kissing her neck, sucking on the skin behind her ear, letting my teeth graze her skin, and those sounds that drove me wild.</p><p>My phone jolts me from my erotic thoughts. \u201cHello.\u201d My voice comes out a little hoarse.</p> <p>\u201cBen, it\u2019s Aerie. Are you okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019m great. How are you? How\u2019s Jagger\u2019s father?\u201d I realize I never asked S\u2019belle this weekend.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m hanging in there. Jagger\u2019s dad is doing as well as can be expected.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t forget, if there\u2019s anything you need make sure you let me know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s why I\u2019m calling. The January issue is ready for press, but the social media column is still blank. Have you had any luck finding someone to fill it? You said you wanted to launch that piece in January and we\u2019re getting down to the wire.\u201d</p><p>A slight tap at my door snaps my head up. I cover the phone. \u201cCome in.\u201d</p> <p>The door cracks open and a very prim-and-proper-looking S\u2019Belle Wilde walks in. She insisted she go home and change before coming to the office. My grin grows as large as the tent in my pants. Fuck me, working with her might be a bit more of a challenge than just getting her out of my mind.</p><p>\u201cBen,\u201d Aerie calls from the line.</p><p>\u201cYeah, sorry. I\u2019ve actually been trying to fill that position all morning. Let me get back to you in a few hours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. Thanks,\u201d she says.</p><p>I disconnect the call, my eyes trained on S\u2019belle\u2019s every move. I can\u2019t help whistling a catcall. \u201cYou look f**king incredible.\u201d</p><p>She has on a black pantsuit with a white silk blouse unbuttoned just enough but not too much. Her hair is done in curls, but they aren\u2019t wild; they are somehow tamed. I prefer wild, but I\u2019ll save that for the bedroom.</p><p>She twirls around. \u201cDo you like it?\u201d</p><p>I push my chair out and pat my lap. \u201cCome here so I can tell you how much.\u201d</p> <p>Her eyes are cautious and slide to the door.</p><p>\u201cLock it,\u201d I tell her.</p><p>\u201cBut I thought you had to work and wanted\u2014\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t let her finish the thought. \u201cLock it and come here. We\u2019ll start the workday after I get a better look at you. After we do a little boss/secretary role exploration.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes gleam, and I know she\u2019s intrigued by the idea of some dirty role-playing. She sits on my lap and I peel off her jacket. My lips find her mouth, and my tongue dives in. It\u2019s only been a few hours since we left my house, but I\u2019m starving for her, for the feel of her lips on mine. I want to devour her. She shifts her weight to straddle me, and desire flares hotter than ever between us. I slide my hand inside her blouse and under her bra to thumb her nipple. My other hand finds the center of her thighs and I circle her cl*t through the fabric of her hose. \u201cNo underwear?\u201d</p><p>She shakes her head no.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so f**king sexy.\u201d</p><p>She pushes her cl*t against my palm.</p><p>\u201cYou like that?\u201d I ask her.</p><p>Her head drops back and her body arches into my touch. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want me to f**k you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she moans.</p><p>With my teeth grazing the skin of her neck, I stop at her ear. \u201cI want you to come to work for me. You\u2019re going to be my social media correspondent.\u201d</p><p>She doesn\u2019t answer.</p><p>\u201cWould you like a job like that?\u201d</p><p>She nods.</p><p>\u201cThen you\u2019ll work for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t do that.\u201d Her voice is ragged as my thumb continues to work her clit.</p><p>I apply a little more pressure, bringing her to the edge, and then I stop before starting again. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to give me a job.\u201d Her green eyes meet mine.</p><p>I lift her breast and drop my mouth to suck on her nipple. I pause and feel her heart beating faster and faster. \u201cI\u2019m offering you something that I need. Please help me out. Give me a month.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I work for you I don\u2019t think we should do this in the office.\u201d</p><p>My mouth skirts up her body to her lips. \u201cYou can start at noon. Now be a good secretary and do as I say. Stand up and take your clothes off so I can f**k you on my desk.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 34</p><p>Dark Horse</p><p>Bell</p><p>Three weeks later</p><p>\u201cHow about this one?\u201d Josie asks, picking up a large crystal bowl formed in the shape of a heart.</p><p>I shake my head no. Josie and I have kept in touch, having lunch every now and then. She told me Tate replaced me with a hot young guy who seems to jump every time he says fetch. Whatever works, I guess. Today her blond hair is tied back in such a way that none of the blue streaks are visible and her makeup seems lighter. She\u2019s also in jeans and a simple top. Her punk rock edge isn\u2019t visible. She looks really pretty, not that she\u2019s not anyway. But it\u2019s a softer look that I like on her.</p><p>\u201cWhy the change in style?\u201d I ask with a smile.</p><p>She pats her hair and laughs. \u201cOh, my parents are in town for Christmas. They would die if their little girl didn\u2019t look like the beauty pageant queen they raised.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? Well, I like it, but why not just let them see who you really are?\u201d</p><p>She blows a piece of loose hair from her eyes. \u201cSays the girl who won\u2019t bring her boyfriend around to meet her family?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know it\u2019s more complicated than that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat I know is something has you all worked up this week. Has Glow Boy\u2019s glow diminished?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, and stop calling him that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019d say you got it bad, but I\u2019m afraid you\u2019d bite my head off. Bad case of PMS or what?\u201d</p><p>She may be onto something. I can feel my mood shifting constantly but can\u2019t stop myself. I laugh. \u201cYeah, maybe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf Midol doesn\u2019t work you might want to check yourself away from everyone for the week, because you\u2019ve got crazy written all over you right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s enough. I get it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, you know I\u2019m a good listener if you need one. After all, I have no life, so listening about yours is better than nothing.\u201d</p><p>I nod in her direction. How can I talk to her about it when I don\u2019t understand it myself? I deflect the conversation from me. \u201cWhat about Hot Boy in the office?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t even know I work there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI find that hard to believe, Josie, since, A\u2014he has to pass your desk to get to his and, B\u2014you\u2019re beautiful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe usually goes straight to Tate\u2019s office.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrownnose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHa, right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you ask him out?\u201d</p><p>She makes a face. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis one?\u201d she asks, picking up a red-lacquered square dish.</p><p>\u201cGod nooo!\u201d I exclaim as I squish my nose.</p><p>\u201cNow, what exactly are we looking for? After all of yesterday\u2019s nos, I\u2019m not sure I can help you.\u201d She moves closer, standing at least a head taller than me.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. Something that looks like magic.\u201d</p><p>She rolls her eyes. \u201cOkay, then we\u2019ll keep looking.\u201d</p><p>Eclectics is a small boutique featuring blown-glass items where I always find unique centerpieces or table accessories. Xander and Ivy\u2019s wedding is just over a week away and I still haven\u2019t pulled together the table d\u00e9cor. All I know is I want them to look like magic. My eyes flutter to the shelves laden with vases of every shape and size, and then I see it\u2014magic in the shape of a fishbowl. I place my order for two dozen silver-and-gold-star-etched glass bowls and hug Josie good-bye.</p><p>\u201cCall me if you need to talk,\u201d she reminds me</p><p>\u201cAt least think about asking him out,\u201d I chastise her.</p><p>She ignores me. \u201cOh, I almost forgot, mouthwatering boy Romeo stopped by this morning asking about you. I guess Tate didn\u2019t tell him anything after all.\u201d</p><p>I shrug over Tate and the job. I\u2019m over it. I have a new job now. In fact, Kale asked me to join him and Ben for lunch today, but since I\u2019d already asked Josie to help me shop for the centerpieces, I told them I\u2019d meet up with them. Ben doesn\u2019t mind if I take an extended lunch as long as I get my work done. He\u2019s like that with all his employees. I\u2019ve made sure he doesn\u2019t show me any favoritism. Yet today even his generosity seemed to irk me.</p><p>But in general working at Plan B has been the best decision I\u2019ve ever made. I love my job. Love, love, love it. I get to tweet, surf the Web, go on Facebook, post on Instagram. I\u2019m building the company\u2019s social platform\u2014me! My career is finally just that\u2014a career. But my relationship with Ben has not been so easy to define. I\u2019ve tried to keep things casual between us, I really have, but I know we\u2019re so much more.</p><p>Together I feel we\u2019re magical, more alive, two halves made whole. We have no obstacles left between us. He knows about the baby. I\u2019ve told my family about him, even River, although that wasn\u2019t fun. River stayed silent, looked agitated, but didn\u2019t say anything bad, that I could hear anyway. Still, I haven\u2019t brought Ben to see my family, because I\u2019m concerned he might not be as committed to the relationship as I am. And the reason is stupid. I shouldn\u2019t be thinking about it so soon\u2014I shouldn\u2019t be thinking that those three little words I want so badly to say to him will make him run away.</p><p>As soon as I step onto the sidewalk, I spot his mop of dirty blond hair. He\u2019s sitting at an outdoor table with Kale.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, man, but I\u2019d say that\u2019s an easy one,\u201d Kale says to Ben, removing his black sunglasses. His light eyes almost disappear as he squints against the sun.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a lot of f**king help,\u201d Ben says.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s easy?\u201d I ask as I approach Ben from behind.</p><p>His head snaps around. He looks a little guilty about something. This past week I have felt that something\u2019s going on. My mind might be reading too much into everything, but I can\u2019t stop myself. He seems to be pulling back.</p><p>\u201cHey, you made it.\u201d Ben stands up.</p><p>I glance over at Kale to see if he\u2019ll answer, but obviously he isn\u2019t going to either. He\u2019s wearing khaki cargo pants, canvas slip-on shoes, and some kind of terry-cloth sun-blocking shirt that buttons up the front. His hair is long but swept back. And he\u2019s a man who calls it as he sees it. Sometimes I get nervous around him, but I try not to let him intimidate me.</p><p>\u201cSorry I\u2019m late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not late,\u201d Ben says, lowering his head.</p><p>I turn my cheek so his kiss lands on it.</p><p>His eyes sweep me in my short skirt and jacket and I know he has sex on his mind. He always does. Not that I don\u2019t, but I\u2019m also starting to feel that maybe that\u2019s all we have. I didn\u2019t go over there last night and we still had sex\u2014phone sex but sex nonetheless. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t like kissing the boss?\u201d he jokes, and pulls my chair out.</p><p>When he leans down to place my napkin on my lap, I whisper, \u201cYou know I do.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m full of mixed signals and even I know it. If it\u2019s driving me crazy it must be driving him crazy. I should tell him\u2014tell him that I love him and maybe that will set my mind at ease.</p><p>Kale sits there with an amused look on his face.</p> <p>Ben rolls his eyes. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re different when you have a girlfriend.\u201d</p><p>Ben flinches at the use of the word girlfriend. I see it. How can I tell him how I feel when he can\u2019t even call me his girlfriend?</p><p>\u201cHi, Kale. Thanks for inviting me,\u201d I break in, wanting to change the subject.</p><p>\u201cHey, sunshine, anytime,\u201d he answers. \u201cYou ever have wheatgrass before?\u201d He opens one of the menus on the table.</p> <p>\u201cNo.\u201d I twist my head around to look at the restaurant name again\u2014Sprouts. I\u2019ve never heard of it until today.</p><p>He waves the waiter over and points to the menu. \u201cThree to start.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get those right away, sir,\u201d the waiter answers.</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of restaurant is this anyway?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRaw food,\u201d he answers, licking his lips at his choices.</p><p>Ben opens his menu. \u201cKale chips, sunchokes, seawitch? Are you kidding me? What kind of food is this?\u201d</p> <p>I look at him with a zip it now look. \u201cI\u2019ve never eaten here. What\u2019s good?\u201d I ask Kale.</p><p>Ben bursts out laughing. \u201cLet\u2019s just say you\u2019ll want an early dinner.\u201d</p><p>I glare at him again.</p><p>He tosses me a questioning look as if he doesn\u2019t know why I\u2019ve reacted that way. Conversation during our meal is strained and once we\u2019ve finished I feel a little impatient to leave. I stand up.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d he asks me.</p><p>\u201cI have a lot to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll walk back with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have some stops to make before I go back to the office. I\u2019ll catch up with you later.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOkay.\u201d He lowers his head to kiss me.</p><p>Again I turn my cheek.</p><p>\u201cWhat the f**k is wrong with you?\u201d he whispers.</p><p>\u201cNothing. I just have a lot to do. See you, Kale,\u201d I say, and turn and walk away. Tears leak from my eyes and I can\u2019t stop them. Okay, so PMS it is.</p><p>About an hour later I feel really guilty for my behavior and for what I haven\u2019t told Ben yet. I pick up my phone and use the intercom to call him.</p><p>\u201cHey, sexy. I\u2019ve been thinking about you. I was hoping you\u2019d stop in when you got back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have work to do, Ben.\u201d I stress this, but the truth is I really want to see him. I want to feel the touch of his skin on mine.</p><p>\u201cWell, come in here and let me see what you\u2019re working on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t. I\u2019m just calling to see if you want to meet me at Pebbles tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. We can go together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll meet you there. I want to stop by my mother\u2019s first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go with you,\u201d he says, and I know he\u2019s trying really hard to help me bridge the distance between my family and him, but I\u2019m not ready for that. I mean he flinched today when Kale called me his girlfriend.</p><p>\u201cI have a bunch of other stops to make. Can you just meet me there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure thing, but anything I should know about ahead of time?\u201d he asks, sounding a little annoyed at me.</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019ll see you then.\u201d I hang up as more tears prick my eyes.</p><p>Six hours later I\u2019m sitting in the dimly lit restaurant that seems extremely crowded for a weeknight and I can\u2019t help wondering if I\u2019ve turned into a sex addict. All I can think about is him\u2014having him, wanting him, touching him. I even send him erotic messages. A few days ago I sent one that read:</p><p>Went to spin class at lunch and got wet thinking of you.</p><p>And another one that said:</p><p>Have you ever done it in an elevator?</p><p>With just one look from him as he joins me at the restaurant, it\u2019s stronger than ever. Now as I stare at him across the table, I can\u2019t help wondering how he feels about me. Does he feel the same?</p><p>He clears his throat. \u201cSo, are you going to tell me what this is about or make me suffer through dinner trying to figure it out?\u201d</p><p>There is an incredibly long silence before I push my plate aside. I take a deep breath and exhale, deciding I can\u2019t do it. I can\u2019t tell him how I feel. I\u2019m too afraid he\u2019ll leave me sitting here again. So instead I tell him the other thing I needed to let him know. \u201cMy whole family is flying to New York City to be with Jagger for Christmas and they want me to come with them.\u201d</p><p>He looks at me a little blankly.</p><p>\u201cDid you hear me?\u201d I snap, wanting to see that he at least cares he won\u2019t see me for Christmas.</p><p>He waits another moment before answering, \u201cAre you going?\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t tell how he feels about it. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>He reaches across the table and grabs my hand. \u201cStay here with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d I say, lowering my voice so I don\u2019t cry. I knew he felt more for me. But why won\u2019t he tell me that?</p><p>My phone rings and at first I\u2019m grateful for the distraction. But then our eyes dart to the name Romeo Fairchild on the screen. I ignore it and all is silent until Ben says, \u201cWhy is he calling you?\u201d His voice is edged with anger.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d I answer truthfully.</p><p>A text message scrolls across the screen.</p><p>I\u2019d really like to talk to you and explain things. I\u2019m not sure I\u2019ve made the best impression. Things at the release party weren\u2019t what they looked like.</p><p>\u201cHe was at the party?\u201d he hisses.</p><p>I bite the inside of my cheek, feeling nervous. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>His eyes narrow on me. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure. I guess I never thought of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s his message mean?\u201d</p><p>I look at him.</p><p>He has daggers in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure.\u201d</p><p>His brow furrows. \u201cS\u2019belle, I have a hard time believing you have no idea what he means.\u201d</p><p>My eyes meet his before dropping. \u201cWell, maybe he wants to clear something up.\u201d</p><p>He doesn\u2019t say anything. His stare does all the talking. He waits for me to explain.</p><p>\u201cI thought he and Tate were having a threesome with some girl that night.\u201d</p><p>His hands grip the table. \u201cAnd how would he know what you thought?\u201d</p><p>My voice grows small. \u201cI told him when he called me and asked me to meet him and Tate.\u201d</p><p>Fury blazes in his eyes now. \u201cFucker,\u201d he says a little too loudly.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you two like each other? There has to be more to it.\u201d</p><p>His jaw is stiff, his body rigid. \u201cBecause he wanted Dahlia in high school and he didn\u2019t care that she was mine. And now he obviously wants you and once again doesn\u2019t care.\u201d His words come out laced with resentment.</p><p>\u201cAm I yours?\u201d I ask him.</p><p>His eyes dart to the table and something shifts in his gaze. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on with you? Are you playing some kind of game with me? You\u2019ve been so hot and cold.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d I sound offended because I am. But the disappointment I feel that he won\u2019t answer the question rises again. \u201cWhen Kale called me your girlfriend today, you flinched like you didn\u2019t like him using that word.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t why you think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why was it?\u201d</p><p>He seems at a loss to come up with an answer.</p><p>\u201cDo you consider me your girlfriend?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I do. You know I do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s all this about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever mind, forget it.\u201d I\u2019m afraid I\u2019m losing him.</p><p>Shifting in his chair, he asks, \u201cWhen do you leave?\u201d</p><p>I swallow. \u201cTomorrow. I already planned to take the time off work anyway until the wedding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou leave tomorrow?\u201d His voice rises.</p><p>\u201cChristmas is in two days,\u201d I say incredulously.</p><p>\u201cI know when Christmas is,\u201d he blasts.</p><p>\u201cOh, I wasn\u2019t sure. You hadn\u2019t mentioned it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long have you known you were going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy mom asked us all last night at dinner. Jagger\u2019s dad has taken a turn for the worse and Mom wants us all to go to be with Aunt Celeste and him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit, S\u2019belle, I\u2019m sorry. Do you know how long you\u2019re going for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA week, hopefully less.\u201d Not that I don\u2019t want to be there for Jagger, but I need to get back and finish getting everything ready for Xander and Ivy\u2019s wedding.</p><p>\u201cDo you want me to come with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want to?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t have asked if I didn\u2019t. I\u2019m getting a little tired of asking you to be honest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019m sorry to inconvenience you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s with the attitude, S\u2019belle?\u201d He grabs my hand. \u201cTalk to me.\u201d</p><p>I search his face. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on with us?\u201d</p><p>He pauses a moment as if trying to figure out where this outburst is coming from. \u201cDo we have to define it now, here in the restaurant?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. But the mixed signals and blank stares are getting to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy mixed signals? Are you f**king kidding me? This week you\u2019ve been all over the place.\u201d</p><p>I motion between us. \u201cWhat is this for you? Just sex?\u201d</p><p>He hesitates before saying, \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs this about Dahlia, then? Are you not over her?\u201d I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m asking him that, but the Romeo comment must have brought it to the surface.</p><p>He glares at me. \u201cNo, I mean yes, I am. You know I am. This has nothing to do with her.\u201d</p><p>The hurt and shock are evident on his face and I want to take it all back, but it\u2019s too late. Maybe I\u2019m not just ready for this. I can\u2019t handle these kinds of feelings. That has become very clear. I stand up and toss my napkin on my plate because something that feels an awful lot like finality courses through my body.</p><p>\u201cSit down and let\u2019s talk about this,\u201d he says, trying to keep his voice controlled.</p><p>\u201cI have to go. I don\u2019t think I can do this anymore.\u201d</p><p>He stares at me in disbelief and even though I know I\u2019m being irrational I lay it all on the table. \u201cLook, Ben, I\u2019m not looking for forever, but before I bring you home to my family I need to feel like there\u2019s more than just tomorrow. And I\u2019m not sure you can give me that.\u201d</p><p>And then I leave him sitting in the dining room at Pebbles two days before Christmas. He doesn\u2019t come after me and I remind myself that I knew something like this would happen eventually.</p><p>What did I do? Why am I ruining this for no reason? I\u2019m unable to answer any of my own questions. The valet pulls my car up and I get in. As I drive home I try to figure out why I didn\u2019t just tell him the truth\u2014that I want him to come with me, to be with me, that all I need to know is that he wants the same. I think about my actions the whole way home\u2014maybe I\u2019m just self-destructive. When I drive down Sunset I stop at a light and look around. A purple sign flashes MISTY\u2019S WORLD. She\u2019s a fortune-teller; I\u2019ve passed the place many times but never gone in.</p><p>I find a place to park and walk down the street. When I get to Misty\u2019s I take a deep breath and walk in. A bell rings and I look around the tiny room with green walls, fluorescent lights, and stars hanging from the ceiling. A smiling woman opens a beaded curtain and I nod to her.</p>  </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cFortune,\u201d she says in broken English.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>She goes back behind the curtain and returns with a tiny cup of coffee in her hand. \u201cDrink.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCream?\u201d I ask her.</p> <p>She shakes her head no and I drink it quickly, not liking the taste at all and even more disgusted by the grinds at the bottom of the cup. She shakes her head at me, disappears, and comes back with another. \u201cDrink it slower.\u201d</p><p>I sit down on the tattered chair and take sip after sip. Once I set it down she points at me and then turns and goes back into the room behind the beads. I follow with my cup in my hand. I question what I\u2019m doing here, but the second thoughts are fleeting.</p><p>\u201cYour cup, please,\u201d she says.</p><p>I hand it to her.</p><p>She stares into the cup, and without asking me a single question, she begins to talk. \u201cYou will find love, but it won\u2019t make you happy. Be patient and let it come to you and you will find true happiness.\u201d</p> <p>I roll my eyes because that\u2019s a little generic.</p><p>\u201cYour job has changed in a big way. You have two bosses. Listen to them both.\u201d</p><p>How could she know that? She doesn\u2019t know me from Adam.</p><p>\u201cYou will find yourself in a situation you have been in before, and you will handle it much better this time.\u201d</p><p>Another generic statement, but the one about the job still makes me want to believe. She stands and leaves through a door, making it clear she is done with me. When I push the beads aside, a younger girl is waiting for me.</p><p>\u201cForty dollars please,\u201d she says.</p> <p>I open my purse, a little dumbfounded, and hand her two twenties. \u201cCan I ask her some questions?\u201d</p><p>The young girl shakes her head.</p><p>I leave there laughing that I just wasted not only my time but forty dollars. I pull out my phone and send Ben a text.</p><p>I\u2019m sorry but I knew this wouldn\u2019t work. Please give me time. I\u2019ll contact you when I get back.</p><p>I press SEND and resolve to push him out of my head until I have to go back to work.</p><p>CHAPTER 35</p><p>Say Something</p><p>Ben</p> <p>One week later</p><p>Don\u2019t be stupid\u2014my own words echo in my head. I\u2019d heard the statement from many different people and in many different contexts in my life. Mostly from teachers when I was growing up. I was far from an A student, but they knew I wasn\u2019t dumb. I just didn\u2019t know how to channel my energy. Fuck, I could never keep my mind on one task. How could I when I couldn\u2019t even sit still? And right now I feel like that same fifteen-year-old kid again. I haven\u2019t been able to concentrate, my leg is perpetually tapping the floor at high speed, and I feel I want to throw something, anything.</p><p>The office is closed but I came in anyway since I didn\u2019t have anything better to do. I\u2019ve been sitting here for hours alternating between staring out the window and glaring at my computer. I turn back around in my chair and this time I fixate on the keyboard. It\u2019s been just over a week since she left me sitting at Pebbles and then sent me a text to give her time. And I have. She has family responsibilities. I understand those. What I don\u2019t understand is what went wrong. Nothing that we talked about makes any sense. I drop my head to my hands. Fuck, f**k, f**k.</p><p>I haven\u2019t spoken to her. Not because she asked me not to but because I can\u2019t figure out what happened. I\u2019ve typed a few texts but never hit SEND. I\u2019ve dialed her number more than a few times but never let it connect.</p><p>Christmas came and went. Serena and Jason went to Hawaii to spend it with Trent. He had a surfing competition over the holidays that he didn\u2019t want to miss out on. I could have gone but wasn\u2019t really in the mood to be jovial. So instead I spent the day with Beck, Ruby, and Beck\u2019s dad. I ate with them and called it an early night.</p><p>Today is New Year\u2019s Eve and I find myself even more agitated than I\u2019ve been all week. I switch to staring at my phone, trying to figure out what to say to her, but I just can\u2019t find the words. Can I tell her that being without her is f**king hell? That I\u2019m miserable? That I miss her, and not just the sex? I\u2019m not sure any of those will work. Still tapping my toe, I grab a pencil, break it in half, and throw it across the room. \u201cFuckkk . . .\u201d</p><p>I push up in my chair and decide to hit the gym. Running always helps. I change quickly and yet as soon as I hit a steady stride she\u2019s back in my thoughts. Having her at Plan B has been a real asset and I hope she comes back to work here. In the past month she\u2019s created a comprehensive social media strategy to increase magazine visibility, membership, and traffic across both publications. She\u2019s experimented with new and alternative ways to leverage social media activities. And she\u2019s been monitoring trends in social media tools as well as trends in applications. Together she and Beck have successfully launched Plan B into the social media network.</p><p>I kept my promise and after that first day of a little boss/secretary fun, we haven\u2019t stripped down in the office again. However, one late night she did pretend to be my secretary again, push me back in my chair, and suck me off. And one morning when we had to be at work really early and she was extremely grumpy, I did punish her by lifting her skirt and slowly licking her to climax. But other than that I have really behaved while at the office. Our relationship was\u2014is, I\u2019m not sure\u2014incredible. Hot as f**k, fun, and engaging. I thought it was almost perfect.</p><p>There may have been a few flaws and I was working on them. She\u2019d spend most nights at my house except for Thursdays and Sundays when she went to her mother\u2019s for family dinners. Even then I\u2019d usually met up with her at her place later. She hadn\u2019t invited me to go with her and I hadn\u2019t asked to join her until the night at the restaurant when I knew she just wasn\u2019t going to let her two worlds collide. That\u2019s why I let her go. I don\u2019t know how to break that barrier between us.</p><p>\u201cRunning from the devil again, mate?\u201d Kale says, pulling my earbud from my ear.</p><p>\u201cSomething like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMust have to do with our girl.\u201d</p><p>I ignore the our. \u201cWhat makes you say that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were on top of the f**king world and now that she hasn\u2019t been around, you don\u2019t seem happy about it. Did you break up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have no f**king clue. I don\u2019t know if we were ever really together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure about what you Americans call together, but to me it looked like you were definitely together.\u201d</p><p>I slow my pace. \u201cI can\u2019t figure out what we were.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019d be cool with me asking her out?\u201d</p><p>I slam the STOP button and the treadmill slows and I get ready to pounce on him.</p><p>He raises his hands surrender-style. \u201cWhoa, mate, I\u2019m just messing with you. See, there\u2019s something more there you\u2019re not seeing. I\u2019d try to figure that out if I were you.\u201d</p><p>Even though it pains me to admit it, he\u2019s right. I know that. \u201cHave a great night,\u201d I say to him, and head toward the door.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m headed out if you want to join me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, thanks, man.\u201d I hit the shower.</p><p>On my way home from the office, I stop by Blondie\u2019s to say hi to Noel.</p><p>\u201cJust a f**king brilliant way to expand the merchandise,\u201d I say. I say it every time I walk in because I\u2019m so impressed.</p><p>He beams from behind the counter. \u201cHey, Benny boy. What brings you by?\u201d And he says it just as he always does.</p><p>\u201cWanted to check on you.\u201d But that\u2019s not the truth. I want someone to talk to. Someone to help me figure out what the hell is going on in my head.</p><p>\u201cGetting ready to close up and take Faith out for a night on the town. I might even swing for a hotel suite if she\u2019s up for it. Walk with me.\u201d</p><p>I follow him outside. \u201cWhere are you taking her?\u201d</p><p>The breeze pushes his salt-and-pepper hair in front of his eyes. He swipes it away. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he says.</p><p>I bend down to pick up one of the boards lying in the sand.</p><p>\u201cI was thinking about one of those fancy hotels in downtown LA where they have what they call the heavenly beds.\u201d</p><p>I glance over my shoulder toward him. \u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d he asks, pulling the shutters closed over the windows.</p><p>I shove the board under the shack. \u201cI think you should let me spring for it. Call it a late Christmas present.\u201d</p><p>He sits on one of the broken steps and looks up at me. \u201cAnything you want to talk about?\u201d</p><p>I put my hands in my pockets. \u201cWhat makes you ask that? Because I offered to do something nice for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Benny, because you look like shit and your leg is moving a hundred miles an hour. Now come sit next to me and tell me what\u2019s going on.\u201d</p><p>I give him a tentative smile, but it quickly cracks. The breeze picks up again and as the metal chimes surrounding the run-down shack sing in the wind, I tell him everything\u2014everything from my first conversation with S\u2019belle in the library to our last one in the restaurant.</p><p>He looks out toward the water once I\u2019ve finished to where the sun gleams off the waves. \u201cI\u2019m going to be honest with you. I think you\u2019re scared.\u201d</p><p>\u201cScared?\u201d I feign indifference.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I do. And I\u2019m going to give it to you straight. You had one girl growing up. She was your life. When you lost her, something in you changed and that\u2019s to be expected.\u201d He pauses to look at me, but it\u2019s without the smile he usually wears, then casts his eyes back out toward the horizon. \u201cDid I ever tell you about my first love, the girl I married in Hawaii?\u201d</p><p>My eyes dart to his. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHer name was Keilani. I met her when I moved to Hawaii to train. I was eighteen. I had never been in love, but I thought I was with her. I asked her to marry me right away. Needless to say, it didn\u2019t work out. We divorced two years later. But then I met Faith. And what I felt for her was so different from what I felt for Keilani it took her telling me how I felt to realize I loved her.\u201d</p><p>I grin at him. \u201cI could see her doing that.\u201d</p><p>He rests his hand on my shoulder. \u201cDo you love this girl?\u201d</p><p>I look at him stunned for a minute. \u201cLove her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, love her. You don\u2019t have to answer me. But you need to figure it out for yourself. I think you\u2019re afraid to admit your feelings for this girl because they\u2019re different from your feelings for Dahlia. But it\u2019s okay if they are.\u201d</p><p>He stands up. \u201cThink about it, Ben. And if I\u2019m wrong, then you need to let her go because it sounds to me like she really loves you.\u201d</p><p>It hits me then that I\u2019ve never really thought about it from her point of view.</p><p>He locks the door to the shop. \u201cCall me and come over for dinner next week. I want to finish this conversation after you\u2019ve had time to think.\u201d</p><p>I rise to my feet, my legs a little wobbly. I try to ignore what that means. I start walking toward my bike and turn around. \u201cNoel, head over to the Beverly Wilshire. It\u2019s on me.\u201d</p><p>He shakes his head.</p><p>\u201cI mean it. I\u2019m calling now. Tell Faith I said Merry Christmas.\u201d</p><p>Even from a distance I can see the old man\u2019s throat working. \u201cThank you,\u201d he calls out hoarsely.</p><p>I jump on my bike, and as I drive, every single minute I\u2019ve spent with her pops in my head. Things she\u2019s said, things I\u2019ve said. And f**k me if I don\u2019t see it clear as the sun descending on the horizon\u2014all she wanted from me was to acknowledge that I have feelings for her\u2014was it really that easy? Because if it was\u2014why didn\u2019t she just ask me? Am I really that thick that I didn\u2019t see it? Yeah, you are, the devil that\u2019s been sitting on my shoulder waiting for me to f**k up announces in my ear. Fuck that\u2014 I\u2019ll show him. I slow down and quickly turn around to head home to change. I know exactly where I plan to spend New Year\u2019s Eve. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>Although the scenic stretch of moonlit highway between Laguna Beach and Los Angeles is forever etched in my mind, it still captures my attention every time I drive past it. The exhilaration I feel when I see the crashing surf or the transcendent vision of the jagged shoreline is something I\u2019ll never get tired of. It\u2019s easy to lose yourself in its beauty\u2014in fact, the sight helps to calm my racing nerves. And the panoramic ocean view off to my right lit by streetlights overhead always seems to put things in perspective for me.</p><p>When I left the house I was still trying to figure out exactly what I was going to say to S\u2019belle when I saw her. But now looking out to the distance, I know I\u2019ll do whatever it takes to make her understand I\u2019m looking past tomorrow.</p><p>Sequestered behind iron gates, the SLS Hotel is perched on a secluded coastal bluff. The guard waves me forward with a pass of my ID. My car makes the mountainous climb and when I reach the top I valet it and head to the sixth floor. S\u2019belle managed to score exclusive access not only to the rooftop pool but also the hotel\u2019s restaurant conveniently located on the rooftop. The elevator dings and my palms start to sweat. When I exit the doors the wedding party is in full swing. Looking around, I notice right away what S\u2019belle had been so excited about\u2014the place looks magical. The pools have been turned into usable space. With pieces of Plexiglas covering them and lights shimmering from beneath them, one pool has been turned into a dance floor and the other a stage for the band.</p> <p>I take deep calming breaths and search the space for her. My eyes land on the restroom and I decide to slip inside there first. What the hell am I so nervous for? I splash cold water on my face and when I look up to straighten my tie, I\u2019m staring into the reflection of the face of the man I haven\u2019t seen in over a year. The man who for far too long I thought stole my girl from me. The same man Dahlia chose to marry. And up until today I didn\u2019t realize she must love him in a very different way than she ever loved me. And right now, strangely enough, I\u2019m thankful for that.</p><p>River Wilde\u2019s green eyes narrow on me as he takes another step inside. His resemblance to Bell is unbelievable. Their facial features, skin tone, and eye color are so much alike it\u2019s uncanny. I\u2019ve recognized it before, but right now I see it clearer than day.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d he asks. His tone is even and controlled.</p><p>Trying not to let my nerves rattle me and not wanting to upset anyone, I look at him and say without pretense, \u201cI came to talk to your sister.\u201d</p><p>His bow tie is undone and hangs to either side of his collar. His eyes look slightly glassy as though he might have had a few drinks. His piercing gaze makes me feel we are in some kind of silent stare-down. But I don\u2019t avert my eyes. Instead I allow him to study me. I get the feeling he\u2019s trying to gauge my intentions. I\u2019m okay with that. Then I notice his fingers tighten into fists and think, Fuck, I\u2019m not here to fight with him.</p> <p>Finally he says something. \u201cDid you tell her you were coming?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I\u2019m trying not to let his attitude get to me.</p><p>\u201cThen I think you should leave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need to talk to her.\u201d I\u2019m not sure what she told him, if anything, about what happened, but I don\u2019t like the impression I\u2019m getting from the way he\u2019s glaring at me. Silence hangs between us for a few long moments.</p><p>His face is like stone. \u201cIf you hurt my sister\u2014\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t give him a chance to finish, because the words leave my mouth without a thought. \u201cI would never hurt her. I love her.\u201d</p> <p>My knees start to shake and I grab the counter to steady myself as it occurs to me that I need her in my life because I love her in a way I\u2019ve never loved anyone. The part of me that I thought died a long time ago didn\u2019t. I just couldn\u2019t find it.</p><p>That\u2019s how I feel about her. She\u2019s my missing piece\u2014my Rosebud.</p><p>Those are the emotions I\u2019ve been feeling that I haven\u2019t been able to figure out. Fuck me. It\u2019s not the same kind of love I felt for Dahlia. What I feel for S\u2019belle is somehow different\u2014deeper, more consuming maybe. I don\u2019t know, but I do know Noel was right. It\u2019s not something any man wants to think about. Comparing the love for one woman to another seems wrong.</p><p>I shove all these thoughts aside, knowing all that matters is making sure she\u2019s in my life, because without her I don\u2019t feel whole.</p><p>The shock on his face has to mirror mine.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to find your sister now,\u201d I tell him in a surprisingly even tone. Then I walk past him and out of the room without a second glance.</p><p>Ivy plants are scattered through the room, and twinkling lights are strung beside paper lanterns. Banners reading HAPPY NEW YEAR and CONGRATULATIONS, XANDER AND IVY are wrapped around the chairs. Champagne bottles, party hats, and noise blowers decorate the tables along with white candles of all shapes and sizes. But what I notice most is the sheer amount of gold and silver confetti that dusts the floor and all of the wedding guests. It looks as though they might have celebrated midnight a little early.</p><p>When I drag my eyes over to the couples dancing on the clear platform over the pool that makes them look suspended in air, I spot her parents first. Charlotte has her arms around her husband but gives me a wave and Jack nods hello. My breath hitches when my eyes dart to a couple dancing beside them. I immediately spot the mass of red curls tumbling down her back.</p> <p>Time stands still as I stand frozen in the glow from the dance floor beneath me. She\u2019s all I can see as I drink her in. A vision of beauty, she\u2019s wearing a long silver satin dress that skims her body to perfection. Her back is bare and her skin looks soft and smooth. As my eyes drop, so does my heart. Someone else\u2019s hands are wrapped around her waist, resting just above her ass. I nearly jump out of my skin when I see his fingertips caress the dip at the bottom of her spine.</p><p>As if she senses me, she turns in my direction. Her green eyes flash in surprise, but her gaze catches mine and holds it. In that moment I see what I\u2019ve somehow known but not understood. I remember thinking so long ago that she looked at me as if she got me, understood who I am. I\u2019ve thought that since the first time I laid eyes on her. But it\u2019s not until right now that I really understood it. It has to be because she loves me as I love her.</p><p>The guy with his arms around her is tall, with dirty blond hair and a spray of freckles across his nose. He\u2019s wearing a white T-shirt with a screen-printed bow tie on it, black scuffed boots, and a tux with his jacket unbuttoned. His skinny downtown biker look makes my blood boil. Has she already moved on? I take a few slow breaths, trying to calm the jealousy erupting within me.</p><p>The music changes from a slow ballad to an upbeat tempo and more people rush the dance floor. I keep my eyes pinned to her, and when I\u2019m sure I can handle whatever the situation brings, I slowly make my way toward her. Thank f**k she pulls away from the guy who still hasn\u2019t removed his fingers from her back even with the start of a new song. She pops up on her toes and whispers something to him. He nods and finally drops his hands.</p><p>She moves off to one side of the dance floor. I can\u2019t help staring and begin to move closer and her eyes widen as she watches my every step. People cross the space between us, but I don\u2019t notice their faces; I only see her. She runs her hands down her arms as though she\u2019s cold. I increase my stride to be by her side faster. But once I\u2019m standing in front of her, my words catch and stick in my throat.</p><p>A mix of emotions crosses her face, but she seems to settle on confusion. My mind, on the other hand, is still spinning with what to say, how to say it. Shit, Casanova I\u2019m not.</p><p>She\u2019s the first to speak. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d A tear leaks from her eye and flows down her cheek. Her voice doesn\u2019t sound accusing or angry; it\u2019s soft as though she\u2019s genuinely surprised to see me.</p><p>My hand goes to her face and I gently wipe the tears away. \u201cYou invited me.\u201d I give her a slight smile, trying to make light of the situation, make light of the fact that I haven\u2019t called her in a week, that I\u2019m about six hours late, that I didn\u2019t pick her up\u2014that I\u2019m an ass**le.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t do this,\u201d she says, and rushes away.</p><p>When I follow her exit with my eyes, I also notice we\u2019ve got the attention of her mother, stepfather, brother, and Dahlia. Her mother starts toward the door, but I step in front of her and say, \u201cPlease let me.\u201d</p><p>Jack takes her hand.</p><p>\u201cLet me make this right.\u201d</p><p>Charlotte steps aside and with all eyes on me I head toward the closed door of the bathroom. My stomach is in knots as I lightly tap on it.</p><p>The door cracks open.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d I ask her as I take a step in and she takes a step back. It\u2019s a small bathroom just like the men\u2019s\u2014two stalls, one sink, and a mirror.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you here?\u201d she asks again, dropping her eyes.</p><p>I move closer still. My pulse pounds so fast I can hear it in my ears. \u201cI wanted to see you. I missed you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? I was such a bitch. I don\u2019t know what came over me. I feel ridiculous about the way I acted. Pushing you for more that wasn\u2019t there.\u201d</p><p>I lift her chin toward me. \u201cS\u2019belle, look at me.\u201d</p><p>I continue speaking once she raises her eyes to me.</p><p>\u201cYou were not a bitch. And there\u2019s more. I was the dumb ass who didn\u2019t understand what you needed because I couldn\u2019t see what I needed. I let you walk out because of it. But I\u2019ve had time to think about it and I know what I want.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes sharpen. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou. I came here for you.\u201d Finally I manage to say something that makes sense. Sweat coats my brow and I draw my hand back to loosen my tie because I feel as if I\u2019m suffocating. I\u2019m so f**king nervous. She\u2019s not saying anything. Maybe I\u2019m too late?</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d She steps closer to me. Her warm breath whispers across my skin. The heat from just that slight contact makes my body buzz.</p><p>I press my forehead to hers. \u201cCan we talk?\u201d</p><p>She nods but quickly pulls away. Her eyes flash over my face and I\u2019m certain that what she thinks she sees isn\u2019t how I feel. This has to be one of the hardest things I\u2019ve ever done. I\u2019ve been so closed off in my own life I haven\u2019t really allowed anyone in. She\u2019s the closest I\u2019ve come, but now I know it wasn\u2019t enough. Obviously it wasn\u2019t.</p><p>I look around at the small space. \u201cSomewhere that isn\u2019t the women\u2019s bathroom?\u201d</p><p>Her slight smile gives me a little bit of hope, but it gives way to a swallow, as if she\u2019s trying to hold back the tears. I try to pull her to me, but she pushes me back. It takes all of my willpower not to struggle with her. I want to comfort her, just hold her. But I\u2019m not sure how she\u2019ll react if I push. I know my chances are running out; they should have been up already. I want to do this right, so I opt to guide her out of here. My hand finds the dip in her back and with just that slight touch I\u2019m electrified. Every inch of her seems to draw me in. She fills me\u2014my body, my mind, my soul, and my heart.</p><p>I open the door and try hard to avoid the stares of her family huddled together on the edge of the dance floor. I whisper in her ear, \u201cWe have an audience.\u201d</p><p>She shakes her head. \u201cGive me a minute. I\u2019ll meet you at the elevator.\u201d</p><p>With my hands in the pockets of my suit pants, I rock back on my heels and wait for her. She\u2019s just a few feet away with her family gathered around her. My breath comes in stuttered pants until I see her hug her mother and head toward me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m ready,\u201d she says, her voice surprisingly much calmer.</p><p>I press the DOWN button at the only elevator servicing the rooftop. We enter along with two other couples. I stand behind her, and heat fills the large gap between us.</p><p>\u201cYou did a beautiful job planning the wedding,\u201d one woman compliments Bell. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt was breathtaking,\u201d the other throws in.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d is all she says, and I notice her hands are trembling.</p><p>I grab one and then the other as I stand behind her. She doesn\u2019t flinch or pull away until the doors open. When they do, the four older people in front of us vacate the space quickly, calling good-bye over their shoulders. I follow right behind them, taking the lead in front of her, and finally feeling my stride, I slink back to grab her hand.</p><p>\u201cWhere are we going?\u201d she asks.</p> <p>\u201cI want to show you something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you wanted to talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do,\u201d I say.</p><p>Pulling S\u2019belle to my side, I reach over the valet stand and grab my keys. \u201cI\u2019ll bring them right back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut, sir, you can\u2019t do that,\u201d the valet calls.</p> <p>S\u2019belle turns. \u201cHe locked his keys in his car.\u201d</p><p>I laugh and bend to whisper in her ear, \u201cThey\u2019re in my hand. How could I have locked them in my car?\u201d</p><p>She shrugs. \u201cI know that, but he\u2019s still trying to figure it out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSilver tongue,\u201d I joke. God, I missed her.</p><p>A slight giggle escapes her and when I stop at the car I have to take a moment to admire her. This girl has occupied so much space in my mind for so long and I had no idea why. But I do now. It\u2019s because she\u2019s perfect for me\u2014we are perfect for each other. I just hope she feels the same way.</p><p>I pop my trunk and pull out the large red box that I loaded before I left my house. \u201cThis is a little late, but Merry Christmas.\u201d</p> <p>Her expression falls. \u201cI can\u2019t take this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease, S\u2019belle, just open it. It will help me explain.\u201d</p><p>She sighs and sets it on the ledge of the hatch. \u201cBen, I think we need to talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd we will as soon as you open this.\u201d I push it toward her.</p><p>Her hands hang at her sides.</p><p>I lift her chin and stare at her with an intensity that I hope conveys just a little bit of how much I care about her. \u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>She looks down at the box and then back up to me.</p><p>I nod, my eyes pleading with her.</p> <p>With resignation she pulls the box toward her and lifts the lid.</p><p>I breathe deep as she stares inside the box and pulls out its contents one after the other\u2014red, black, white, green, gold. Cloth napkins from every restaurant I\u2019ve eaten at since I saw her stash in the parking lot of the Biltmore Hotel.</p><p>She glances up at me with a puzzled look on her face.</p><p>I pull her closer to me. \u201cYou said you wanted more than just tomorrow. I\u2019m shit with explaining my feelings, but I had this gift ready for you weeks ago. I want you to see that I never only thought of you in terms of just the next day. To me there was always more. I just didn\u2019t know how to tell you. S\u2019belle, I think about you all the time. Everywhere I go, everything I do. Fuck, I even steal napkins because they remind me of you. Look, I know I can be an ass**le, but I can promise you more than just tomorrow if you let me.\u201d</p><p>She crushes her lips to mine.</p><p>I close my eyes and savor the sensation of her body pressed against mine\u2014soft, warm, and tender. Then I wrap my arms around her and pull her as close as I can so I can feel all of her\u2014every single inch. When we\u2019re both breathless I lean back. \u201cThere\u2019s more in the box.\u201d</p><p>She reaches for it and removes the rest of the napkins before pulling out the shiny key from the bottom. She looks up at me. \u201cA key?\u201d</p><p>I nod. \u201cTo my house. I want you to move in with me. That\u2019s what I was talking to Kale about that day you overheard us. How to ask you.\u201d</p><p>Her mouth drops open in shock. \u201cI can\u2019t do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014I\u2014I\u2019ve never lived with a guy,\u201d she stammers.</p><p>I grin at her. At how f**king adorable she is. I open her hand and place the key in her palm before closing her fingers one by one. \u201cLucky for you I\u2019m not just any guy. I love you and I want you to live with me. Say yes?\u201d</p><p>My breath stops as I look down at the myriad of emotions crossing her face.</p><p>Her hand slides up my chest to my cheek. Tears glisten in her eyes and she closes them tightly.</p><p>\u201cS\u2019belle, open your eyes. Did you hear me? I know I\u2019m really shitty at this relationship stuff. I\u2019m nowhere near perfect and I never will be. I\u2019m not a heart-and-flowers kind of guy. I don\u2019t even know how to be one . . . but I\u2019m the guy who will love you with everything I have.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t bear to be away from you. I want you near me all the time. Not just in my bed but I want you sitting across from me at dinner, I want to go to the market with you, I want to do everything with you. I want to be the one who makes you smile for no reason. I want to be the one you can\u2019t stop thinking about. I want to be the one who rocks your world.\u201d</p><p>She opens her eyes. A shiver passes through her before she finally speaks. \u201cBen Covington, you\u2019ve rocked my world from the first time I laid eyes on you. I love you too,\u201d she says, her words hoarse and soft.</p><p>Bending down closer to her mouth, I whisper, \u201cIs that a yes? You\u2019ll move in with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d She throws her arms around my neck.</p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d I crouch down so we are eye to eye and grin at her. My hands move to her h*ps to hold her close against me.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe Misty was right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMisty?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA fortune-teller. Never mind, you\u2019d never believe me,\u201d she giggles.</p><p>I kiss the corner of her lip, taste it, tug on it. \u201cYou\u2019re crazy. Just the kind of crazy I need in my life.\u201d</p><p>She laughs.</p><p>Then her expression turns serious. \u201cI\u2019m sorry for bringing up Dahlia. I never really thought that at all. I don\u2019t really know what was going on with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShhh . . . ,\u201d I whisper, and place my finger over her mouth. \u201cWe can talk about all that, talk about everything, but first I want to kiss you.\u201d</p><p>Her lips part and I lower my mouth to hers. I kiss her more softly this time, sweeter, maybe full of love. When she moans I can\u2019t hold back my own groan. I want her so much. I need her so much. But instead of throwing her in the backseat of my car and taking her here as I really want to, I decide we should go back upstairs. I have to make things right with her family. I know it isn\u2019t going to be easy, but I also know I love her enough to do it.</p><p>\u201cSo I saw your brother in the bathroom before I saw you,\u201d I confess.</p><p>\u201cXander?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, River.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widen. \u201cHow\u2019d that go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s just say it went better than could have been expected,\u201d I whisper in her ear.</p><p>\u201cOh, that\u2019s really good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s going to be okay. They don\u2019t have to love me, but I\u2019ll make you feel comfortable enough that we can all be together\u2014I can guarantee you that.\u201d</p><p>I pull back to look at her. Her smile is wide and bright\u2014just the way I like it. There is no fear or concern anywhere on her face. Also the way I like it.</p><p>\u201cI believe you.\u201d</p><p>I step closer. The heat in her eyes flames, proof of the passion that\u2019s always between us, and I reconsider the backseat plan. I stare at her lips but quickly raise my gaze back to her eyes. They exude such innocence and trust they make me remember I\u2019m really trying not to always take. But f**k, this isn\u2019t easy. With my mouth now hovering over her lips, I grab her hand and say, \u201cCome on, let\u2019s go up to your brother\u2019s wedding. I\u2019d like to say congratulations.\u201d</p><p>She yanks my hand and pulls me back to her, flush to her body. Close enough that I can feel the hardness of her ni**les through her dress and my shirt. She grips my tie and pulls the knot from it. \u201cThe festivities were just ending when you arrived. Xander arranged a private fireworks display for Ivy and whisked her off on some yacht to watch the show alone. They\u2019re actually headed to Mexico on that boat for their honeymoon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes that mean you\u2019re mine, all mine, for the rest of the night?\u201d I lick my lips.</p><p>\u201cI am,\u201d she purrs. \u201cI even have a room on the fifth floor. Would you like to see it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee it? Oh, baby, I want to do more than see it,\u201d I growl in her ear.</p><p>The sound she makes in response sends my body into overdrive. My hands are skimming down her body and around to her back when the unpleasant memory of that guy\u2019s hands in the same place as mine comes to the forefront of my mind. \u201cWho was the guy with his hands all over you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeif?\u201d</p><p>My eyes drift down her body and back up. \u201cI\u2019m asking you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was Leif Morgan. He\u2019s the guy I told you about that took Jagger\u2019s place in the movie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh yeah, right. Lucky for him I didn\u2019t punch him out, then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBen, we\u2019re just friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve told you I\u2019m jealous as f**k, haven\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>She nods, biting her lip with an amused smile on her face. \u201cHave I told you that turns me on?\u201d</p><p>Fuck me.</p><p>CHAPTER 36</p><p>Our Song</p><p>Bell</p><p>Three weeks later</p><p>Happiness fills me, all of me, every part of me. I never thought two people so lost in this world could make each other feel found, but we have. I slip back into bed as the sun makes its way up on the horizon and look over at Ben, his bare back tan from our time out on the beach teaching me how to surf, his head buried in his pillow, and his hair a rumpled mess\u2014he couldn\u2019t look any hotter. I know he\u2019s tired but I can\u2019t resist letting my tongue draw a line from his neck down.</p><p>In a flash he has me on my back. \u201cWhat time is it?\u201d He shifts a squinting eye toward the clock.</p><p>\u201cSix.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn the morning?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s illegal for a Sunday.\u201d</p><p>I laugh. \u201cThat\u2019s my line.\u201d</p><p>His mouth travels down my neck with a lick and a suck. \u201cI like your lines.\u201d</p><p>A throaty moan escapes my throat and I shift beneath him.</p><p>He lifts his head. \u201cWhy are you up so early?\u201d</p><p>I arch my back, pressing my body into his. \u201cI had to pee.\u201d</p><p>He pulls away with a grin.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d he says, rolling us so he\u2019s on his back and I\u2019m straddling him. \u201cNothing.\u201d</p><p>I moved into Ben\u2019s house two weeks ago. It was the week after we got back together. He kept his promise, doing everything he could to make things with my family comfortable. And moving day couldn\u2019t have been a bigger testament to his desire to make things work. It was definitely a family move. My whole family insisted on helping and so did Ben\u2019s. My mom and Jack were of course really easygoing and more than welcoming toward Ben, but I already knew they would be. River, well, he and Ben didn\u2019t actually speak to each other, but they didn\u2019t fight either. And Ben and I both agreed we could live with that. At least they proved they could be in the same room together without killing each other. I even think I heard River mumble, \u201cNice place, cool tree,\u201d under his breath when Ben was in his proximity. I got a laugh out of that. They\u2019ll come around with each other; I know they will\u2014someday.</p><p>Once we finally leave the bed, we spend the day out. We meet my mom and Jack at the Farmer\u2019s Market where we buy a few things for the house as well as some groceries. Once we get home and get our bags unloaded, I turn on the music, pour two glasses of sparkling water, slice a lemon, and suck on a wedge. I notice Ben\u2019s stare as I do and a wave of relentless desire sweeps through me. I can feel my pulse racing and my breath quicken with every move around the kitchen he makes. He can feel it too, I can tell.</p><p>I lean back to watch Ben make dinner\u2014stir-fry. He finally convinced me to try it, but it wasn\u2019t that difficult. I\u2019ve had a weird need to eat carrots. It\u2019s as if I\u2019m Bugs Bunny lately. I would never admit it to Ben, though, because if he knew I wanted to eat vegetables, God knows what he\u2019d have me eating. So instead I wrinkled my nose at the idea and hesitantly agreed. But first he had to promise a few sexual favors in return. That part was fun. And since Ben\u2019s always telling me what a whiz with a wok he is, I really did want to see him in action. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I stand back with my arms against the counter watching him as he dices the onions, chops the peppers, and juliennes the carrots.</p><p>\u201cShow-off,\u201d I mutter as he slices perfect rectangle wedges out of the last orange stick.</p><p>I take a sip of my drink and move closer. \u201cI think you need an apron,\u201d I whisper in his ear, and then nibble on it.</p><p>\u201cI have to concentrate and with you doing that, it\u2019s hard.\u201d</p> <p>I giggle.</p><p>He picks up the cutting board and pours all the perfectly cut vegetables into a bowl. I lean over and grab a carrot, popping it in my mouth.</p><p>He turns and looks at me, raising an eyebrow.</p><p>I shrug. \u201cThey look edible the way you cut them.\u201d</p><p>He shakes his head.</p> <p>I squeeze his butt. \u201cDon\u2019t you want to know why I think you need an apron?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure, I\u2019m dying to know.\u201d</p><p>I let my hand trail between his legs to that spot I know he likes me to touch.</p><p>He sets the knife down and turns. He grabs my wrists and lets his tongue slip out of his mouth, wetting his lip. I\u2019m getting wet just thinking about what I want him to do with that tongue.</p><p>\u201cI thought you were hungry and you wanted to eat,\u201d he growls in my ear.</p><p>\u201cI am and I do. I just wanted to say you might want to wear an apron the next time you cook because I think you should be n*ked and this\u201d\u2014I rub myself against the erection I saw bloom the minute I sucked on the lemon\u2014\u201cmight stand out.\u201d</p> <p>He grins, unashamed. \u201cYou noticed, did you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>He walks me backward away from the island and toward the bank of cabinets behind me. His hands go first to my waist, then my hips, and farther down. I wish I wasn\u2019t wearing jeans. \u201cNext time we cook together, you\u2019re going to be wearing one of those little black-and-white maid outfits.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have anything that resembles an outfit like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou will,\u201d he says with a sexy smile that sends tingles all the way down to my toes.</p><p>He kisses me a few times, on my mouth, my chin, my ear\u2014a taste here and there.</p><p>\u201cBen.\u201d</p><p>He doesn\u2019t stop. My shoulder, my collarbone, my other shoulder. \u201cHmm?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou have to finish dinner,\u201d I manage to say.</p><p>We have been taking turns cooking and sometimes we cook together. The problem with cooking together is we usually end up eating cold meals because we have a hard time concentrating on the food, like right now.</p><p>His mouth quirks up. \u201cOkay, but you distracted me with the whole apron thing. And I know you just really want to wear one.\u201d</p><p>I scoff. \u201cHow do you manage to always turn things around?\u201d</p><p>He looks over at me, his eyes heavy lidded. God, what he can do to me with one look. I draw in a breath, squeezing my thighs together to control the pulsing.</p><p>He moves back to the island and turns the stove on. I want to tell him let\u2019s skip dinner, but I\u2019m also starving. He avoids making eye contact as he moves around. I\u2019ve figured him out\u2014it\u2019s the only way to accomplish his task without distraction. I go about my own business. Back to the cutting board, where I continue slicing lemons.</p><p>When he looks up he sees me holding a lemon under my nose. His stare grows curious. \u201cOkay, spill it.\u201d</p><p>I give him a smile. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy are you smelling the lemon?\u201d</p><p>I breathe it in again, but this time the smell I\u2019ve always loved hits me in a sour way and almost makes me want to gag. The oil crackles from the wok and he momentarily drops his gaze and lowers the heat so he doesn\u2019t notice. When he looks back up I outstretch my hand. \u201cHere, smell it?\u201d</p><p>His hand covers mine around the yellow oval. He inhales with an exaggerated whiff. \u201cOkay, I give.\u201d</p><p>I drop my hand and make a little noise, trying really hard not to sigh. \u201cArgh . . . don\u2019t you smell the lemony scent?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I smell it. I smell you. You know I love that scent, because I tell you that all the time. But if you want to know if one is ripe, you\u2019re supposed to squeeze it, not smell it.\u201d</p><p>I peel the skin back with my nails and toss it in the sink. I slip the tip of the wedge in my mouth, hoping it doesn\u2019t make me gag again.</p><p>\u201cUm . . . so good,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cI bet,\u201d he teases, flinching at the thought of eating a lemon.</p><p>\u201cBen, it doesn\u2019t matter what it tastes like. Don\u2019t you know that when you eat a lemon it\u2019s readily absorbed into your body and acts as a natural perfume? That\u2019s why I always smell it before I eat it to make sure that\u2019s what I want to smell like.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck . . . sometimes you actually can make sense out of your nonsense,\u201d he teases, grabbing another from the bowl and quickly slicing it into quarters and offering me the wedge with skin on. My lips circle his fingers and I put the piece in my mouth. I take my time, sucking all the juice, hollowing out my cheeks as I do. I know what I\u2019m doing. He stays close even after I drain the liquid from the lemon. He puckers his own lips and I know exactly what he\u2019s thinking. When I finish I take another quarter and hold it up for him to eat.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m good.\u201d He holds his hands up.</p><p>\u201cPlease try it. It tastes like lemonade.\u201d I lick my lips.</p><p>He sighs in exaggeration. \u201cIf I do you\u2019re going to owe me.\u201d</p><p>I pop up on my toes. \u201cI\u2019ll let you pretend to be Tom Sawyer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuck Finn and you have a deal,\u201d he counters with a devilish grin.</p><p>\u201cYou got it.\u201d I hold the fruit to his lips.</p><p>With my fingers so close to his mouth, my breathing only hitches higher and so does his. The oil crackles and splatters from the wok, but neither of us moves as his hands find their magical way down my body. Drawn to each other as we always are, the magnetic pull gets stronger with each day we spend together. \u201cI love you,\u201d I say softly.</p><p>Suddenly there\u2019s a tap at the glass doors from out in the family room. I turn with a jump and a screech to see the shadow of two people standing out on the deck\u2014a silhouette of a man and a woman.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so f**king adorable,\u201d Ben whispers in my ear.</p><p>He makes his way toward the door, obviously knowing who it is.</p><p>\u201cWho is that?\u201d I\u2019m wondering why they wouldn\u2019t just ring the doorbell.</p><p>Ben slides open the door. \u201cCaleb, where the f**k have you been?\u201d</p><p>The two guys slap each other\u2019s back in a semblance of a hug. I\u2019ve met Caleb a number of times. However, I\u2019ve never met the girl. She\u2019s stunning. Dark hair, dark eyes, and very fit, much like Caleb. I walk toward them.</p><p>\u201cI knocked, but . . . ,\u201d Caleb starts to say but stops when his eyes cut to mine. And with his grin wide asks, \u201cBell, how are you?\u201d</p><p>Ben reaches out and takes my hand.</p><p>I give Caleb a smile. \u201cGood, really good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is Gemma. Gemma, this is my best friend in the world, Ben, and his . . .\u201d He pauses for a brief moment.</p><p>\u201cThis is my girlfriend, Bell.\u201d</p><p>My heart chases itself in circles at his introduction. \u201cHi, nice to meet you.\u201d I smile like an idiot.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re just making dinner. There\u2019s plenty.\u201d</p><p>Caleb glances in the kitchen. \u201cBen\u2019s famous stir-fry\u2014I\u2019d love to but Serena and Jason are waiting dinner for us. I just wanted to stop by and say a quick hi and talk to Ben.\u201d</p><p>He rocks back on his heels and tucks his hands in his pockets, obviously feeling uncomfortable.</p><p>\u201cWell, how about something to drink?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d love a glass of water,\u201d Gemma says.</p><p>\u201cThe same.\u201d Caleb smiles.</p><p>I head to the kitchen, staring back at them. I see their gestures but can\u2019t hear anything. Ben keeps staring at me and once I put ice and water in two glasses I hurry back in to figure out what\u2019s going on. When I hand the waters to Caleb and Gemma, Ben opens his arms to fold me into them. With my head tight against his shoulder he kisses me and says to Caleb, \u201cYou know what, I\u2019m good the way things are.\u201d</p><p>There was a time I would have been eager for the story. But I went down that road once and I don\u2019t ever want to go down it again. I know he\u2019ll tell me as soon as I ask.</p><p>I look up. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>He smiles down at me and kisses the tip of my nose. \u201cNothing. Caleb was just looking for some advice, but I can\u2019t really help him.\u201d</p><p>Caleb nods.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be right back,\u201d Ben says, and when he comes back he hands some kind of flash drive to Caleb. \u201cGood luck, man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks. I\u2019ll be in touch.\u201d</p><p>We say our good-byes and once they leave through the front door, Ben looks over to me and sees my puzzled expression.</p><p>\u201cHe just needed some information that I had of his.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d It feels as though there\u2019s more to the story, but Ben\u2019s body language says it all. He\u2019s quiet, serene, and I feel he needs me to just be here for him. Next, he pulls me close and holds me tight for a very long time. \u201cI love you,\u201d he says.</p><p>\u201cI love you too.\u201d I relish it when he tells me that because it isn\u2019t often, but I know he means it, so I\u2019m okay with that.</p><p>He pulls away. \u201cDinner can wait.\u201d</p><p>I nod my agreement because there\u2019s a different kind of hunger I\u2019m feeling all the way to the depths of my soul.</p><p>He extends his hand and leads me up toward our room.</p><p>We start to make love and when he slowly slides inside me the only words out of mouth are \u201cI love you.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 37</p><p>Come to Me</p><p>Ben</p><p>We all want second chances. Perhaps we even all need them. But we don\u2019t all get them. I know I\u2019m one of the lucky ones. Caleb showing up last night proved it to me beyond any doubt. I\u2019m happy with my life\u2014more than happy. I open my eyes before the alarm clock goes off with those thoughts floating around my mind. I lift my head and reach for her, but she\u2019s not lying beside me.</p><p>\u201cS\u2019belle,\u201d I yell.</p><p>When she doesn\u2019t answer I sit up and that\u2019s when I hear it. The sound of her puking. I pull my boxers on and hurry into the bathroom. She\u2019s wrapped up in her short pink robe kneeling in front of the toilet.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d I squat beside her and hand her a towel.</p><p>She takes the towel and wipes her mouth. \u201cNo. I think those vegetables you made me eat gave me food poisoning.\u201d</p><p>I try not to laugh. \u201cI don\u2019t think the vegetables would do that to you. Maybe the chicken, though? We did leave it on the counter a little longer than we should have. But I\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>She looks up at me. \u201cYour stomach is probably used to it.\u201d</p><p>This time I have to laugh at the pout on her face. \u201cCome on. I\u2019m putting you back to bed.\u201d I feel her forehead. \u201cYou\u2019re not warm, but it could still be the start of a bug. Stay home today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t stay home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you can. If the boss gives you a free pass, you take it. If you feel better later, come in then.\u201d</p><p>Once she falls back to sleep, I shower and take off for work. I call her when I arrive and she sounds really groggy. At noon I shoot her a text.</p><p>How are you feeling?</p><p>She responds:</p><p>Better. I\u2019m going to stay home today, though. I\u2019m trying to figure out something that Misty told me.</p><p>Misty?</p><p>The fortune-teller.</p><p>Oh, right. Explain to me later.</p><p>I roll my eyes at her craziness but smirk at the same time. Then I look over at Aerie. It\u2019s her first day back in the office and there is a shit ton to catch up on. Sadly Jagger\u2019s father passed last week. I accompanied S\u2019belle to New York for the funeral. She had never met Jagger\u2019s father and although I hadn\u2019t either, being able to be there to support her cousin made her feel better and me feel a little closer to her family. The funeral did bring back many painful memories of my own mother\u2019s death and so I spent a lot of that trip talking to S\u2019belle about her. I think S\u2019belle got to know the woman who loved me regardless of my flaws a little better. Then again I guess now that I think about it, S\u2019belle has done the same thing. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOkay, what\u2019s first on your list?\u201d I ask Aerie.</p><p>She pulls out an organized stack of folders and I know we\u2019ll be here for a while. Around four in the afternoon she pulls out the March layout. As I stand up and walk around the room to stretch, my phone buzzes. It\u2019s another text from S\u2019belle.</p><p>Can you meet me at Pebbles for dinner?</p><p>I look up at Aerie. \u201cCan we finish this tomorrow?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSure, I have a ton of other things to do anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d I quickly look back down to respond.</p><p>You have to be joking!</p><p>Please.</p><p>Not if you\u2019re going to break up with me!</p> <p>No! I\u2019m not. Why would you think that?</p><p>Never mind. You\u2019re not going to tell me the world will end tomorrow, are you?</p><p>No! And I think I get what Misty was talking about.</p><p>You\u2019re crazy. You know that. Right? See you soon.</p><p>If I said my nerves weren\u2019t back in full force, I\u2019d be lying. By now I\u2019ve really begun to hate S\u2019belle\u2019s favorite restaurant. But I make it there by six. She\u2019s already seated at a table by the window with her back to me, and her red hair hangs in curls. The restaurant is by no means busy, so the atmosphere is tranquil and the room is somewhat quiet. Bending down, I swipe her hair to the side and kiss her neck. \u201cHi, sexy.\u201d</p><p>She twists and her lips meet mine. \u201cHi.\u201d</p> <p>I take a seat and pull my chair right up to hers. When I glance at the tabletop I see two glasses of sparkling water and a dish of lemons as well as a wrapped package that looks a lot like the one I brought her from Fiction Vixen the last time we were here.</p><p>I grab her hands. \u201cLet\u2019s cut to the chase. Please don\u2019t torture me by making me wait until after dinner to tell me why I\u2019m meeting you here.\u201d</p><p>Her innocent green eyes shine, although she looks a little peaked and a little scared.</p><p>\u201cAre you still sick?\u201d I ask, concerned.</p><p>She shakes her head. \u201cI have something to tell you and I\u2019m really nervous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy, have you been bad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she says quickly, and looks more sickly with each passing second.</p><p>\u201cShit, I thought I was going to have to spank you,\u201d I say, trying to ease her nervousness, but honestly my stomach feels as if it might fall at any second, so I\u2019m not sure I\u2019m doing a great job.</p> <p>But when a slight smile crosses her lips, I think I\u2019ve succeeded. She twists and pulls a brown paper bag out from her purse and hands it to me with trembling fingers.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s this? Nothing that\u2019s going to jump out at me, I hope.\u201d</p><p>She stares at me, looking scared shitless.</p><p>My own hands are shaking as I unfold the bag. What the hell could it contain that makes her look like that? I pull out a purple box that reads EPT, with the words early pregnancy test written out below it. My eyes widen, my heart pounds, and my pulse races as my head snaps to her.</p><p>\u201cAre you pregnant?\u201d I ask in shock.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know but I think I might be,\u201d she answers. All the color has left her face now.</p><p>A million different emotions pass through me, but I settle on one\u2014pure elation. I jump from my chair and take the box and her hand. \u201cWell, let\u2019s find out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow?\u201d she asks, completely taken aback.</p><p>\u201cRight now.\u201d I grin at her.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not upset?\u201d She sounds surprised.</p><p>I pull her flush to my body, not caring that we\u2019re in a restaurant. \u201cUpset? Are you out of your mind? Now come on, you have a stick to pee on.\u201d</p><p>She tugs on my hand.</p><p>I turn around.</p><p>\u201cWhat if I can\u2019t go?\u201d</p><p>I stride back to the table and pick up both glasses of water. When I return to her I tell her, \u201cDrink these, baby.\u201d</p><p>She smiles in a way that lights up her eyes and gulps both of them down.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t come in here,\u201d she says when I push open the door to the restroom.</p><p>\u201cFuck I can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>She shakes her head and enters under my arm.</p><p>I shakily open the box and hand her the stick.</p><p>She stares at me.</p><p>\u201cYou have to go in there,\u201d I say, pointing to the stall door.</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen go!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo bossy,\u201d she says as she takes the stick.</p><p>When she comes out we both stare at it as she sets it on the counter.</p><p>\u201cThe instructions say to wait two minutes to read the result. Be sure to read the result before ten minutes have passed,\u201d I tell her.</p><p>With my hands gripping the counter, my eyes are locked on the stick as the time slowly passes by. S\u2019belle is pacing the room. My foot taps the floor at a hundred miles an hour. When a blue line appears in the square window, I twist toward her. \u201cIt\u2019s turning.\u201d</p><p>She looks at her watch, the one I finally had fixed for her. \u201cIt says wait two minutes. It hasn\u2019t even been thirty seconds. You shouldn\u2019t be looking yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m impatient and never follow instructions. You know that.\u201d</p><p>She gives a little giggle. The one that makes my heart flip.</p><p>I decide I\u2019ll pick up the instructions to see what the window means.</p><p>\u201cI thought you didn\u2019t follow the instructions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShhh . . . let me figure this out.\u201d</p><p>She rushes over to me and pushes her way under my outstretched arms.</p><p>I read out loud with her cocooned inside my arms, \u201cIf a blue line appears in the square window within ten minutes, the test has worked.\u201d I continue reading the instructions. \u201cA plus sign in the round window indicates a pregnancy result\u2014\u201d</p><p>She pulls the folded paper from my hand.</p><p>\u201cHey, let me finish reading that.\u201d</p><p>She holds the stick up. It has the biggest, bluest plus sign displayed in the first window.</p><p>Every part of my body hums with a kind of happiness I\u2019ve never felt in my life. \u201cA baby?\u201d Shock takes over.</p><p>She nods.</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d I ask her.</p><p>She grins. \u201cWell, the birds and the bees . . .\u201d</p><p>I pull her to me and kiss her, soft and gentle. I can\u2019t believe this is happening. I can\u2019t believe I got a second chance at life.</p><p>After a few moments she leans back. \u201cI think this explains my mood swings and my puking. My mother told me taking antibiotics makes the pill less effective. I had no idea\u2014\u201d</p><p>I shut her up by putting my finger over her lips. \u201cShhh . . . I don\u2019t care how it happened.\u201d</p><p>Her hands go to my cheeks and she holds them there. \u201cAre you sure?\u201d</p><p>I nod with emotion clogging my throat. Is she kidding me?</p><p>We stare into each other\u2019s eyes for a long while and then I drop to my knees. She follows my movements as I lift her shirt and kiss the shamrock she wears to never forget our first baby. I look up at her and then glide my mouth to kiss above the gleaming green symbol of remembrance. And this time when I look up again I say, \u201cS\u2019belle Wilde, I love you and I promise you forever.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 38</p><p>Happy</p><p>Bell</p><p>Seven and a half months later</p><p>You might be a little horny were the first words I read when I opened a pregnancy book to a random page many months ago. It made me laugh because the description fit. I had bought Ben two books from Fiction Vixen the day I thought I might be pregnant\u2014the first one The Modern Kama Sutra: An Intimate Guide to the Secrets of Erotic Pleasure and the second Finding Out You\u2019re Pregnant. It was the latter that shared that helpful tidbit with me. Once we both calmed our racing nerves in the bathroom, we went back to our table and decided food to go would be best. I was ready to leave my refuge and go home. I just wanted to be alone with Ben.</p><p>Sex with Ben has always been . . . well, amazing. And in the past several months my need for him has been off the charts. When we were first together I knew that what we had was different. I don\u2019t know how I knew\u2014I just did. And no one I was with after him had ever made me feel the way he does. Everything about him, every touch, caress, word, and whisper, makes my body come alive. It still does. And now even though my belly is swollen beyond belief as I enter my ninth month of pregnancy, I want him more than ever.</p><p>Ben doesn\u2019t mind at all. He\u2019s happy to indulge my every need\u2014whether it\u2019s a slice of triple-crusted pie from Four &amp; Twenty Blackbirds at midnight, or my weird craving for vegetables, especially carrots with lemon juice drizzled over them, or of course my constant arousal. He likes that my br**sts are bigger\u2014a fact that amazes him on a daily basis. The Kama Sutra book has come in handy because as my body has changed, our favorite sexual positions have grown uncomfortable and some aren\u2019t even feasible.</p><p>We\u2019ve had to get very creative and experiment with different ways to please ourselves. We take turns picking new positions to attempt. It\u2019s been so much fun.</p><p>After showering, I tug the towel off my head and let my hair dangle in curls, patting the water from it.</p><p>He picks up the book as I walk into the bedroom and with complete focus looks through it.</p><p>I point to one of the drawings. \u201cThat one.\u201d</p><p>He strokes his chin. \u201cYou think? I\u2019m not sure about the leg placement.\u201d</p><p>I giggle and toss the book aside, throwing myself back on the mattress and bringing him with me. \u201cLet\u2019s make something up.\u201d</p><p>Both of our towels come undone. \u201cSounds like a plan,\u201d he growls.</p><p>It\u2019s not an exaggeration that we have sex at least twice a day. I made the mistake of telling my new girlfriend Summer from Lamaze and I don\u2019t think she believed me. We took a spin class together and when we went to the juice bar afterward, I told her my vagina was really sore and I wasn\u2019t sure if I was going to be able to have sex tonight.</p><p>Her head snapped to mine as she rubbed her own swollen belly. \u201cYou\u2019re still h**ing s*x?\u201d She went on to say, \u201cGod, that\u2019s the last thing I feel like doing.\u201d And then she laughed.</p><p>I didn\u2019t answer but laughed along with her even though that couldn\u2019t have been further from the truth for me. I love Ben and we do it a lot. Obviously I\u2019m very attracted to him and with him I\u2019ve discovered I love sex, I really love it\u2014a lot. And I know he definitely feels the same.</p><p>When he rests his head on his elbow and moves one hand to caress my stomach, I\u2019m pulled back to the here and now. His lips trail down my neck, over my br**sts, and stop to kiss the shamrock in my belly button, then just below it. He kisses the baby like this all the time. It gives me butterflies.</p><p>He looks up at me. \u201cSo we agree. We\u2019ll name the baby Huck?\u201d</p><p>We found out the sex of our baby at my four-month prenatal visit, and ever since then Ben has been relentless about naming him Huck. I peer down at him. \u201cNo, we did not agree. Remind me when we had the conversation where I said yes.\u201d</p><p>His fingers drift down to circle me.</p><p>I let out a long heavy breath, knowing soon my body will be hovering on the edge waiting for the crashing pleasure to peak.</p><p>\u201cThis morning,\u201d he murmurs as his tongue licks a path down the curve of my belly to join his fingers.</p><p>I raise myself up on my elbows. Still breathing heavy, I try to see over my stomach. \u201cDo you mean when your mouth was\u201d\u2014I point to where his fingers are\u2014\u201cthere and you were whispering things I couldn\u2019t even try to understand in the frenzied state you had me in?\u201d</p><p>His devilish grin widens. \u201cYes, when I had my tongue on your cl*t and you were screaming my name and calling out to heaven\u2014yeah, that\u2019s when. You said yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you, Ben Covington, but we are not naming our child Huck.\u201d</p><p>He stares at me and pats my cheek. \u201cMaybe once you see him you\u2019ll change your mind.\u201d</p><p>His eyes gleam whenever he talks about the baby. It\u2019s so cute. His thumb strokes my face and he kisses me gently before he moves his mouth to that spot behind my ear that makes my body dance on its own. When I arch my back and moan, I feel the grin that forms on his lips. I knot my fingers in his hair, feeling more than a little ready to do this again. His hand moves back down to caress my belly as we lie in bed n*ked getting ready to make love for the second time since I got home. I can\u2019t even wait until tonight. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>His hands move quickly as we lie on the bed both still lightly damp from our shower. One chaste kiss on the mouth and before I know it his lips are sucking on one of my ni**les and his hand moves to cup my sex and I\u2019m aroused all over again. I close my eyes as my body soaks in the pleasure of his touch. A loud moan escapes my throat and I lick my lips, but when he stops abruptly and jerks up, my eyes fly open.</p><p>\u201cS\u2019belle, there\u2019s a lot of, um . . . water on the bed.\u201d</p><p>I sit up and look. Oh my God, I feel it.</p><p>Ben is staring down\u2014petrified.</p> <p>Once I realize I haven\u2019t lost bladder control, I almost laugh at how scared he looks. Calmly I say, \u201cI think my water broke.\u201d</p><p>He bolts off the bed and pulls a pair of boxers from his drawer. \u201cYou\u2019re not due for two weeks.\u201d</p><p>I shrug. \u201cThe doctor did say anytime now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have to call the doctor.\u201d</p><p>I pat the bed. \u201cBen, sit down. Let\u2019s see if I have any contractions.\u201d</p> <p>I try to be calm, summoning all my willpower to not crumble and have him rush me to the hospital, because I know what to do\u2014what the classes taught me.</p><p>He looks at me as he lowers himself down onto the bed, his leg tapping up and down with his foot on the floor. \u201cHow long does that take?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have no idea.\u201d I laugh.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean you have no idea? We went to all those classes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were there too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but I was always a shitty student.\u201d</p> <p>I have to laugh at that. How can I not? I slide my feet to the floor and rise from the bed. As I slip into one of his button-up shirts, I feel a cramp and I slump over.</p><p>Ben rushes over to me. \u201cLet\u2019s go to the hospital.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me call my mother and see what she says first.\u201d I sit back on the bed, taking a deep breath.</p><p>Ben quickly hands me my phone from the night table. \u201cDid you pack a bag yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I thought I still had time.\u201d</p><p>He strides over to the closet. \u201cI\u2019ll do it.\u201d</p><p>I call my mother.</p><p>\u201cHow far apart are your contractions?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve only had one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJack and I are on our way. You should be fine until we get there. Just relax, okay, Isabelle?\u201d</p><p>Isabelle? She only ever calls me by my real name when she\u2019s nervous. Great. \u201cYes, Mom.\u201d</p><p>I hit END and look up to see Ben standing in utter sexiness in the doorframe. He is disheveled and so handsome\u2014his jeans are unzipped, his shirt, the frayed one that I love, is unbuttoned, and his feet are bare.</p><p>He lifts his eyes to me. \u201cDo you think we made a mistake?\u201d</p><p>My mouth drops. \u201cWhy would you say that? It\u2019s a little late now.\u201d My voice breaks.</p><p>He furrows his brow. \u201cI mean that we didn\u2019t get married before we have the baby. What did you think I meant?\u201d</p><p>Relief courses through me at the same time as another cramp bites from my lower gut. I wince and he flies to the bed.</p><p>\u201cWhat can I do?\u201d</p><p>I grab his hand. \u201cJust stay with me. I\u2019m scared.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going anywhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy are you second-guessing our decision?\u201d I ask as I look down at the large radiant-shaped diamond that adorns my finger.</p><p>The sun shining in the window reflects against the ring\u2019s cut edges. He proposed to me a week after we watched the white stick turn to a plus sign. It was so romantic\u2014like a scene out of an old film. He took me back to Hearst Castle. No one was there\u2014it was just the two of us. Before we entered the large exquisite doors, he dropped to his knee, called me his \u201cRosebud,\u201d and told me he wanted to marry me. Whoever said he wasn\u2019t romantic? He told me I was his missing puzzle piece\u2014a guy couldn\u2019t get more romantic than that. The gesture made my heart skip beat after beat. But later when the adrenaline rush slowed, we talked about it more. We agreed that we would get married . . . but only when the time was right. Plus, I would need time to plan the wedding.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to be that couple that gets married only because they\u2019re having a baby,\u201d I reminded him.</p><p>\u201cDoes my name still go on the birth certificate? Will the baby have my last name?\u201d he asks.</p><p>His voice is full of concern. I muster all of my energy as another cramp hits. Once it passes I straddle his lap and take his face in my hands. \u201cThis baby is yours and mine. Yes, your name will be on the birth certificate and, yes, he will have your last name.\u201d</p><p>He slides his lips to kiss my hand and takes them in his. \u201cI love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you too.\u201d Then I know what he needs. \u201cBen, just so you know, I did put your name on the birth certificate that just read baby.\u201d I can finally talk about the baby, our baby that I gave up, and feel that I did what was right.</p><p>His eyes glitter with tears, but before they can spill I let out a scream.</p><p>He takes my hand. \u201cLet\u2019s go. They\u2019re coming too close. We need to get to the hospital.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you pack my bag?\u201d</p><p>\u201cS\u2019belle, I can\u2019t find shit in there. Tell me what you want to wear to the hospital and I\u2019ll get it. We\u2019ll worry about the rest later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy white top with the . . .\u201d I gasp for air.</p><p>He\u2019s really in a panic now. He shoves his feet into his boots and zips and buttons his clothes.</p><p>When the contraction stops I stand up. \u201cLet me show you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, but make it quick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBen, you have to put socks on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d he asks, confused.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t put socks on before you put your boots on. Your feet are going to smell.\u201d</p><p>He laughs and grabs a pair from the dresser as I make my way to the closet. I can see what he\u2019s talking about. Huge mess of clothes everywhere. I point to the items I want. Ben throws them all in a bag along with some of my toiletries. Then he helps me slide on my panties. Next I shimmy a pair of jeans on and decide to wear his shirt with no bra. I don\u2019t really care at this point.</p><p>Once I\u2019m ready he takes my hand, but a knifelike pain radiates from my hipbone to my pubic bone and I can\u2019t move.</p><p>Sweat coats his brow.</p><p>I look around the room as I ride the wave out and spot the book with the blue spine. When my gaze swings back to Ben, his eyes are so wide with fear I can almost feel it. I take a step forward but stop again. \u201cWait, can you bring that book?\u201d</p><p>He looks confused but grabs it and shoves it in the bag.</p><p>\u201cSo you can read to me while we\u2019re in the hospital,\u201d I tell him as we leave the house.</p><p>He looks down at me and stops to hold me; then he says, \u201cYou\u2019re so f**king adorable.\u201d</p><p>From the car I call my mother and tell her to meet us at the hospital. My insides feel as if they\u2019re twisting inside out at this point. At the hospital I\u2019m quickly whisked to a room, given an IV, and asked if I want an epidural. Ben and I already decided I would take the epidural. My mother and Jack arrive just as it takes effect. Shortly after that River, Dahlia, Ivy, and Xander show up. Ivy is three months pregnant and still experiencing morning sickness morning, noon, and night. They all pop their heads in before going to the waiting room. When the nurse calls the doctor and time approaches, my mother leaves as well. And it\u2019s just Ben and me.</p><p>The doctor comes in and I begin pushing. At first I think I might throw up\u2014the pressure I feel everywhere is too intense. But once it subsides, I push again and again. My hand is gripping Ben\u2019s so tightly, but he doesn\u2019t care. He wipes some hair from my eyes and I look up at him and see amazement and wonder on his face. My eyes drop to where his are locked and I see our baby\u2019s head crowning. Intense stinging radiates from my core as I push harder and scream louder. Then just like that, our baby emerges into this world.</p><p>His cries are hoarse but steady as if he\u2019s having little tantrums.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do that,\u201d Ben says to the doctor as he prepares to cut the cord.</p><p>\u201cCan I hold him?\u201d I ask with tears of pure joy leaking from my eyes.</p><p>The nurse lays him on my chest for only a brief moment but long enough for me to feel the beat of his heart.</p><p>\u201cHe has red hair,\u201d Ben says, his voice strained with emotion as he tries to hold back his own tears.</p><p>The nurse takes him from me. \u201cThe doctor just has to examine him and we will have him right back to you.\u201d</p><p>Ben squeezes my hand and presses a kiss to my forehead before he follows her. When he turns around he\u2019s grinning ear to ear, holding our baby bundled in a blue blanket.</p><p>\u201cIs everything okay?\u201d I ask, unable to wait another minute.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s perfect,\u201d he says as he crosses back over to me.</p><p>I turn away for a brief moment with relief seeping through me to sip on the ice water by my bedside and catch sight of the book Ben had been reading to me just an hour earlier. Ben carefully places our baby on my chest and I study his little face\u2014the shape of his cheeks, the slope of his nose, the fullness of his lips. Suddenly he opens his eyes and lets out a loud cry. That\u2019s when I see his perfect dimples and blue eyes so much like his father\u2019s. With tears of joy I look up at Ben and say, \u201cFinn. Let\u2019s name him Finn.\u201d</p><p>Ben\u2019s grin is wider than I have ever seen. \u201cFinn is perfect.\u201d He smiles down, resting his hand over mine. And as my eyes shift from the baby to Ben and back to the baby, I think this has to be the single-most beautiful feeling in the world. It\u2019s a feeling that reaches all the way into my soul and takes my breath away. And it\u2019s a feeling I know will never leave me.</p><p>Hours later when I awake, I know Ben is nearby because I can hear the sound of his breathing, but this time my senses are heightened. As my eyes flutter open his soft lips are on mine, and although he is barely skimming them, I can feel the heat that sears me every time he touches me. My eyes lift to see Finn in Ben\u2019s arms. In looking at them together, observing the bliss I see on Ben\u2019s face, I know that what we have isn\u2019t perfect, but it is our own version of perfect. And even though the edges of our relationship may be frayed much like the hem of his shirts, the framework is solid and in the end . . . that\u2019s all that really matters.</p>  </body></html>"]
