Little Jasmine is already fifteen, and boy, is she a beauty,\u201d Joseph said.</p><p>Sitting on the back deck with the morning sun streaming down upon them, Joseph and his brother George were enjoying light breakfast pastries and coffee while catching up on news about the kids and their week.</p><p>\u201cI know, Brother. Little Molly is ten years old now. It feels like it was only yesterday that Trenton was fighting tooth and nail not to get married and settle down, and now he and Jennifer have a beautiful family with two kids. Not to mention their rowdy dog, Scooter, and feisty cat, Ginger.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t forget that dang goose. Last time I was there, the rascal got me right in the tush. I need to take my hunting rifle with me the next time that I visit,\u201d Joseph threatened.</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019d just bring him some cracked corn like I do, he wouldn\u2019t chase after you,\u201d George said, not even attempting to hide his amusement.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not bribing a damn bird, and I\u2019m certainly not running from one!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, simmer down, Brother. I have a feeling the goose won\u2019t be the end of you \u2014 it\u2019s not as if you have a fundamental problem here, and you haven\u2019t hit bottom. So forget that cheeky critter and put the incident behind you\u201d he guffawed, gleeful at making Joseph the butt of his joke. He tended to go a lot over the top when he found something so amusing.</p><p>Joseph mumbled something very unbrotherly under his breath, but he let go of his wrath against both George and the animals at his nephew\u2019s home. He had far more important issues to discuss, such as what they were going to eat that night.</p> <p>\u201cWhat are the plans for today?\u201d George asked. \u201cWith Katherine and Esther out shopping, we can sneak away. I\u2019m sick of golfing. Why don\u2019t we race go-karts again? That was a thrill.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you\u2019re trying to kill me off, George. You slammed me against the wall the last time we went,\u201d Joseph huffed.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re acting like an old man, Joseph. We still have lots of life left in these old bones.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue, George, very true. Fine. I\u2019ll give go-kart racing another try, though I hope that these old bones don\u2019t become these old broken bones. Let\u2019s see how many of the grandchildren we can gather up to go with us.\u201d</p><p>The men continued their morning meal as George pulled out the newspaper and flipped to the business section. Though George\u2019s son Trenton was now in charge of Anderson and Sons Incorporated, George still liked to keep up on what was going on in the Seattle area.</p><p>Joseph looked up just in time to see George gasp for air, his face white. Frozen with fear for a few endless seconds, Joseph felt his legs finally start working again and he jumped up to help his brother.</p> <p>\u201cGeorge! What\u2019s wrong? Are you choking? Is it your heart? Speak to me, Brother,\u201d he urged as he leaned over to see what he could do. They\u2019d had enough health scares to last them a lifetime and Joseph didn\u2019t think he could handle another near-death experience in his beloved family.</p><p>Just as Joseph began moving to race for the phone, George gestured wildly at the newspaper. Joseph stopped in his tracks and read the largest headline and subheadline on the page: \u201cBillionaire buys flailing computer tech firm: Richard Storm sells East Coast shipping business, brings thousands of jobs to Seattle.\u201d</p><p>It wasn\u2019t the article that had Joseph turning as white as his brother. It was the photograph of a man who appeared to be their age \u2014 and who looked almost identical to the two of them, just a different hairstyle, some added wrinkles around the eyes, and a short beard covering his face.</p><p>\u201cWhat is this?\u201d Joseph gasped as he sank down in the chair next to George.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. The picture just startled me \u2014 that\u2019s all. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s nothing.\u201d George tried to reason it away, but he couldn\u2019t stop staring at the still eyes of the man gazing into the camera. It was like looking into a mirror.</p><p>\u201cWell, read the dang thing,\u201d Joseph nearly shouted as he regained his voice. He pointed to a paragraph in the middle of the first column.</p><p>\u201cStorm, who was born in Seattle, moved to the East Coast with his adoptive parents when still a baby. He says he owes his hard-work ethic to his father, who was a doctor in Seattle for 25 years before moving his medical practice to Portland, Maine. Storm was orphaned at age 18, when his parents died in a boating accident, and he used his modest inheritance to become a shipper of historic relics, mainly hard-to-find European artifacts from the 15th century. By the time he turned 30\u201d \u2014 the newspaper gave a date \u2014 \u201che was worth more than $10 million \u2014 almost $60 million in today\u2019s dollars \u2014 and he continued to increase his fortune dramatically. Storm is a now a billionaire several times over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was born here on the same day as we were? This can\u2019t be a coincidence.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLet me keep reading.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo on then,\u201d Joseph said, still looking at the picture.</p><p>\u201cApparently, he married young, had five children \u2014 four boys and one girl \u2014 and then their mother left them. He\u2019s made the move here because he feels it\u2019s the right thing to do for his family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe need answers, and I want them now, George.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t agree more.\u201d</p><p>The two men went inside to Joseph\u2019s large den and looked through the bookcase containing old family albums. When they came upon the album from the year they were born, they sat with it in front of the fireplace.</p><p>Less than an hour later, both men were speechless with shock. Richard Storm\u2019s adoptive father was the same man who\u2019d delivered Joseph and George. Their mother even had notes in the album about her doctor, saying how kind he was and how sad she felt that he and his wife were unable to have children.</p><p>Only one conclusion appeared likely. This doctor must have seized the opportunity to give his wife a child, too desperate to care about the consequences of ripping another family apart.</p><p>\u201cThis man, Richard, may very well be our brother,\u201d George gasped as he gazed at the pictures of their mother holding them for the first time.</p><p>\u201cBut how is it possible she had a third child without realizing it?\u201d Joseph countered.</p><p>\u201cYou know how different times were back then, Joseph. They didn\u2019t have ultrasounds, and Mother suffered complications during delivery. She\u2019d lost a lot of blood and they had to put her under. Dad wasn\u2019t in the room \u2014 back then, fathers didn\u2019t belong there. The only other person in the room with the doctor was his nurse, who also happened to be his wife. They could have easily seen the third child and taken the opportunity to create their own family. Why else would they have moved away so suddenly?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just can\u2019t imagine that happening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because, if this is true, we have a brother out there we\u2019ve missed knowing, and our mother has a child she never knew,\u201d George said, overtaken by sadness.</p><p>\u201cOne thing I know for sure \u2014 we need to meet this man and find out if he really is family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut what do you think that will do to him, Joseph? We would cause upheaval in his life, change everything that he believes about himself and his loved ones,\u201d George said. \u201cLet\u2019s try to be reasonable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you honestly do nothing but stand by when a man who may be our kin is so close by? He has children, George, and they are most likely our nephews and our niece. We have to find out the truth, even if it\u2019s a painful one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right, Joseph. Of course you\u2019re right. I just don\u2019t know whether our visit will be a welcome one to this man. Heck, we know nothing about him. What if the man who could be our brother is a terrible person?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe can\u2019t be terrible, George. No matter what his birth certificate says, he\u2019s an Anderson, and Andersons are good people,\u201d Joseph said with confidence.</p><p>\u201cRight you are, Joseph. Well, you know what this means, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I do. Go-kart racing is off the schedule today. It looks like it\u2019s time to pay a visit to Richard Storm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll grab my hat. You lead the way brother; I\u2019m right behind you.\u201d</p><p>The two men walked out the door, climbed into Joseph\u2019s Mercedes and made their way to the new Storm Corporate offices. Expectant smiles spread across their faces as they neared their destination. Granted, it would be heartbreaking to learn they had a brother they hadn\u2019t had the pleasure of growing up with. But still, if it were true, they were now blessed with a whole line of family members to get to know.</p><p>Joseph grinned, thinking of all those first-rate great-nieces and -nephews. More and more babies on the horizon and potential love matches to make.</p><p>Chapter One</p><p>Two years earlier</p><p>\u201cDo any of you have any idea of what this is about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a clue. It seems the old man has got something up his keister again. I haven\u2019t gone to bed yet from yesterday. I seriously considered not showing up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou may as well stop complaining about it, because you know how father gets. You don\u2019t want your precious trust fund cut off, now, do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up, Brielle. You\u2019re the one who\u2019d be hurting if you lost Daddy\u2019s money.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll of you should shut up before the old man walks in. The more compliant we are, the sooner our family reunion can end, and the quicker we can get on with our lives.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s very good thinking, Lance. I know how important it is for you to run from my presence.\u201d</p><p>The five young bickerers turned in surprise to find their father standing in the doorway. Richard had to quickly disguise the sadness in his eyes. This wasn\u2019t the time to coddle his children, who, though grown up, were thoroughly spoiled. It was time to do what he should have done years ago, before it was almost too late. He didn\u2019t have much time left, and he feared that his kids would never change if he didn\u2019t act now.</p><p>Would they even care that the doctor had given him the grim diagnosis of only three years to live? At this point, he doubted they would. It saddened him to no end how much he had failed them \u2014 and he was certain that his failures as a parent had caused the distance among them all.</p><p>\u201cFine, you heard us complaining. We\u2019re sorry, Dad, but we haven\u2019t all been together in one room in years, so what\u2019s the big emergency?\u201d Richard watched as his youngest child, Brielle, walked to the liquor cabinet and poured herself a scotch. She was only twenty-four years old, but she had so much bitterness inside her.</p><p>Why shouldn\u2019t she? Their mother had walked out on all of them, but Brielle was the only one who couldn\u2019t remember her \u2014 she\u2019d only been three at the time. It made her feel as if she\u2019d really missed out the most. Lance had vague memories, as he had been five, but Tanner, Ashton and Crew remembered the most. The kids were all two years apart, his ex-wife having produced them almost on a strict schedule.</p><p>Soon after Brielle was born, Suzanne was done being a mother and left them without ever turning back around. Richard had been too busy for years to date another woman, and when he\u2019d tried, it had always been disastrous, since he\u2019d been too exhausted to put forth any real effort. Eventually, he\u2019d just given up. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He\u2019d been wealthy and worked long hours to become even richer, leaving the children with nannies during the day. Yet he\u2019d felt guilty enough to stay home in the evenings and on the weekends so he could spend as much time as possible with his offspring.</p><p>It was only when they\u2019d gotten older that he\u2019d started working even longer hours, and that\u2019s when they\u2019d begun to drift away from him. He just hoped it wasn\u2019t too late to reverse the damage.</p><p>Now, here he stood in a room with grown children ranging in ages from twenty-four to thirty-two, and he didn\u2019t like them. He loved them, as he always would, but they\u2019d become selfish and spoiled, and even worse \u2014 entitled.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve all been cut out of my will and I\u2019m freezing your trust funds.\u201d</p> <p>Richard watched as, slowly, each of his children turned toward him with varying expressions of disbelief. Of course it was Crew who finally cleared all expression from his face as he stood taller and faced his father.</p><p>\u201cDo you care to elaborate?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy parents were hard workers their entire lives. They built not only one medical practice, but two. They scrimped and saved, and gave me a good education. When they passed, I was devastated, but I took my inheritance and I created something both of them would be proud of. Unfortunately, I\u2019ve pampered and indulged the five of you, making you think that life is nothing more than one big party, and that you deserve to be handed everything on a silver platter. Well, that stops today. As I\u2019ve just said, you\u2019ve been cut out of my will. Your trust funds are frozen, and your credit cards canceled \u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t do that!\u201d Ashton shouted.</p><p>\u201cI can and I have. You can leave the room now and be on your way, or you can hear me out.\u201d</p> <p>None of them budged, and Richard made sure to look each child in the eye. He refused to back down this time, no matter how many tears Brielle shed, or how convincing the group charmer, Tanner, tried to be. He would lose his children forever if he didn\u2019t stand firm and show them that life was about so much more than what they\u2019d made it.</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t really given us a choice other than to listen to you, have you? Is this your way of saying you need some attention? You could have just scheduled a lunch date,\u201d Lance said, trying to make a joke, but the anxiety in the room allowed no break in the tension.</p><p>\u201cYou always have a choice, Lance. It\u2019s your decision whether to make the right one or not. I\u2019m really sorry you feel that way, though. It honestly breaks my heart. We were once a tight-knit family, laughing together, speaking often, living our lives. I don\u2019t know where I went wrong, but somewhere along the way, you got lost, and now I\u2019m allowing you to find yourselves again. I hope you do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOK, OK,\u201d Brielle said with a roll to her eyes. \u201cWhat is this journey you want us to take?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you asked, Peaches,\u201d he replied, reverting to the nickname he\u2019d given her at birth because of the sun-kissed color of her hair, which was as stunning as the beginning rays of a sunset. Her deep-blue eyes widened at the use of the name he and her brothers had always called her. Somehow along the way they had stopped.</p><p>Brielle pulled herself together and looked back at her father with rage evident in her now-narrowed eyes. \u201cI haven\u2019t been Peaches in fifteen years, Dad, but if you want to reminisce about the \u2018good\u2019 old days, then I\u2019ll go ahead and play your game.\u201d</p> <p>The sarcasm and scorn pierced Richard to the heart.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve sold the family business. I\u2019ve decided it\u2019s time for a fresh start, and I\u2019ve chosen to do it on the West Coast. There is nothing in Maine to hold me any longer, and I\u2019m tired of the tourist season. I\u2019ve just finalized the paperwork on a failing computer tech firm, and I plan to turn it around. Doing that gave me an idea for the five of you.\u201d</p><p>Richard waited for it to sink in that his shipping empire was now gone. He knew Lance would be the most upset, as he\u2019d been the one who\u2019d invested the most time in the corporate offices. Richard missed those days when Lance, still in high school, was eager to learn all he could by his father\u2019s side.</p><p>Once the boy had left for college, then graduated, that interest had waned, and he acted as if he were just waiting to take over the business, but no longer eager to put in the effort. In the last several years, he\u2019d become as spoiled as his siblings, but Richard, looking forward to a comfortable retirement, had still entertained a hope that the boy would one day take the reins. Now, that wasn\u2019t going to happen for his youngest son.</p><p>\u201cCan this be reversed?\u201d Lance\u2019s voice was strained with the amount of control he had to exert to keep his temper.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Richard didn\u2019t elaborate.</p><p>\u201cThe business was supposed to be mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you should have taken pride in it. You should have proved to me that you deserved a stake in the family business. I had hoped to pass it to you one day, but as of right now, you are unworthy to take the reins of any business of mine.\u201d</p> <p>Another son broke in. \u201cDon\u2019t you think that\u2019s a bit harsh, Father?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t, Crew. And you are no different from your brother. None of you has worked for an honest dollar, and I would rather see my funds passed down to people who can appreciate them than leave them to you with the way you\u2019ve been acting. You have time to figure this out \u2014 well, time for now, at least.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is that supposed to mean \u2014 for now?\u201d Tanner asked.</p><p>Richard took a calming breath. It wasn\u2019t yet time to tell his children of his prostate cancer. The doctor said he\u2019d done all he could do. Of course, they would keep trying, but his doctor was also a good friend, and he\u2019d warned Richard to get his affairs in order with his grim prognosis. Three years.</p><p>\u201cNothing, Tanner. You just need to pay attention. I want you to prove yourselves, make something of your lives. You are more than these spoiled brats I see before me right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow are we supposed to do anything if we have no money? What do you want us to do to prove ourselves?\u201d Tanner asked, throwing his hands into the air in exasperation.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the smartest question you\u2019ve asked me so far,\u201d Richard said with a smile before pausing to gaze at each one of his children. A glimmer of hope filled him at the fighting spirit he saw in each of them. \u201cI have purchased five more failing businesses. You can fight amongst yourselves to choose which one you want to run. I have created a sufficient budget for you to do what needs to be done to bring the companies back into profitability. If you do this, and do it well, only then will I reinstate your inheritance. If you fail, you will be on your own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, what if your idea of a successful business is different from what our idea would be?\u201d Ashton asked.</p><p>\u201cWhen you truly feel success for the first time in your life, you will know what it is. You\u2019ve never earned that badge of honor before. You\u2019ll learn now, one way or the other. I\u2019m done explaining this. You may come see me when you\u2019re ready.\u201d</p><p>Setting down the folders of the five businesses he\u2019d purchased, he noticed that none of the kids jumped up to see what the choices were. He knew they would, though. On the off chance they didn\u2019t, it would break his heart, but he would stay true to his word and cut them off. They would either make it, or not. What their decision would be was now out of their hands.</p><p>Richard walked from the room, his children bolting after him, trying to chase him down. Though he hadn\u2019t let them see the burden weighing on his shoulders, the conversation had hurt him in ways he couldn\u2019t begin to describe. He knew he was taking a huge gamble, but what other option had there been?</p><p>If he didn\u2019t kick his children out of their nest eggs, they\u2019d never learn how to fly, never take pride in a true victory. He could end up losing them forever, but he already felt as if they were so incredibly self-absorbed that their only connection with their family was through blood. Richard had faith that his children would soon find their wings \u2014 they\u2019d find their way back to him \u2014 and to each other. Only then would he be able to rest in peace.</p><p>Closing the door to his study in his children\u2019s faces, he looked down at the framed picture of his parents sitting in its special place on his desk. His mother\u2019s eyes were filled with joy as she cuddled him close to her heart. He was only six months old at the time, and it had taken his parents so long to have him that they\u2019d doted on him his entire life.</p><p>Still, they\u2019d taught him the core values that made him who he was today. He\u2019d always worked hard, earned everything he\u2019d ever striven for and appreciated the life he\u2019d been raised to lead. He\u2019d gotten lazy with his own children, but he knew it wouldn\u2019t be too late. He just had to have faith and stick with the plan.</p><p>They would all take it one day at a time, and then a week at a time. If he tried to think past that, it became too overwhelming. He had always protected his children, which he was still doing, just in a more tough love sort of way. He was determined that they would appreciate this, and him, someday.</p><p>Richard smiled as he thought back to their priceless expressions of rage and shock. They wouldn\u2019t be appreciating him anytime soon; that was for certain.</p><p>Chapter Two</p><p>Present day</p><p>Enjoying the fresh morning sun and gentle sea breeze, Crew Storm stood in front of his resort and smiled. Never would he admit to his father how good he felt, how much more alive, strong and happy he\u2019d become since taking on the monumental task of refurbishing an oceanfront resort on exotic Catalina Island.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t give the man too much encouragement or he\u2019d go on meddling in all of their lives from here on out. However, Crew did feel great. Maybe he\u2019d cave and give the old man just a small thank-you. It was the least he could do since his father had put him on the right path. For a while, Crew had been lost, but that was a thing of the past, and now he only looked straight ahead.</p><p>In the last two years, Crew had truly grown up, and because of that he was rising to the top, learning how to fight for what he wanted, and he had discovered that he wasn\u2019t one to back down from a challenge. Pride billowed up inside him as he turned to look at his finished project.</p><p>When he\u2019d pulled the file for the resort, all he\u2019d felt was extreme anger, resentment, and a determination to do the opposite of what his father wanted. It had all been nothing more than a game, and it was one that he had to win. He had planned on doing the bare minimum, getting his trust fund back, and never speaking to his dad again. What a fool he had been.</p><p>Now...now that had changed. Crew felt like a whole new man. It was about more than beating his old man \u2014 it was about taking pride in accomplishing a great task and feeling the satisfaction of victory over himself.</p><p>He\u2019d completed a task many others would have failed at, and it felt incredible to see the resort in all her former glory \u2014 better than her former glory, in fact. She was a shining jewel, ready to bring Catalina Island back to the ultimate vacation destination. In the nineteen-thirties Catalina Island had been at her heyday, the ultimate place to spot the stars, and to vacation like a king. This resort was the beginning of reinventing the thirties with a twenty-first-century bang. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Crew had always been tenacious, never willing to back down from a challenge. His father said it was because he came from good stock. And his dad seemed to have the Midas touch. Crew found it a thrill to know he was making smart choices, and he had a better relationship with his father than he\u2019d ever thought he\u2019d have again.</p><p>His father had thrown him and his siblings out to fly or to die, and changed all their lives forever. Never before had he looked himself in a mirror and felt shame, but after the first six months of sweating it out pounding nails into wood on the broken-down resort, he\u2019d woken up one day to realize he was a different man. After a year, he\u2019d called his father to apologize.</p><p>Now, finally, he was ready to open his new resort, and he was proud for people to walk through her doors. Yes, this thing of beauty before him couldn\u2019t be called anything but a woman, because her curves were smooth, her lines flawless, and she\u2019d been transformed by his blood, sweat and...well, not tears, but she\u2019d gotten everything else she could out of him.</p><p>As he gazed in adoration at the sleek and glistening entryway, he felt a pang in his heart. He knew to sell her would be bittersweet, but that was the deal. Get the business up and running, turn it around, and then make a profit.</p> <p>It wouldn\u2019t be easy, but a smile flitted across his lips when he thought of doing it all over again. His father had laid down the law, setting the ultimate challenge, and the old man had won, because Crew was changed forever now, and a man his dad could be proud of. Crew had discovered what he excelled at, and he would embrace that gift, even if he left a piece of himself behind each time he left the old and ventured on to a new project.</p><p>The old resort had been in shambles, the corporation going bankrupt, and it was walking away, leaving the place to fall into the sea. She wasn\u2019t tall, only ten stories high, but each floor had a theme, and each room was fit for royalty. Crew\u2019s absolute favorite floor was the flamboyant thirties. He had to dedicate a floor to the year the resort had originally opened, of course.</p><p>The wide hallways were decorated with fine pieces of art and vintage antiques he\u2019d uncovered in his high-powered hunting. Fresh flowers decorated delicate tables; the colorful bouquets would draw the eye of every customer who stepped from the cherry-wood-lined elevators. Hand-fashioned carved railings led up the wide staircases, and the walls were painted in soft golden hues. Dazzling chandeliers glowed in the center of each room and down the grand corridors.</p><p>He\u2019d poured his entire soul into the place, and he wanted his clientele to walk through the doors and instantly feel as if they were in a luxurious wonderland. His staff would treat each and every one like the most important guest in the building, and they all would want to return over and over again.</p><p>He\u2019d hired only the best cooks, and his restaurants would soon be famed for tantalizing entr\u00e9es and enticing ambience. A small theater room was decorated with dark colors, soft lighting and red velvet curtains above a stage where live bands and professional vocalists would perform. The resort planned to cater to its guests\u2019 every whim, wanting no one to feel the need to step outside onto the island for anything except the abundant gifts of nature.</p> <p>Half of the rooms faced an exquisite stretch of the Pacific Ocean, and half faced the inner workings of the island. Crew\u2019s preference, of course, was the water, but there were many who would want to open their French doors and step out on the balcony to watch the entertainment below of a town that played hard, and never stopped moving.</p><p>The price tag at his resort wasn\u2019t cheap, but the clientele he attracted wouldn\u2019t bat an eyelash. They would pull out their wallets, open them willingly, and, in turn, they would get to experience a once-in-a-lifetime vacation.</p><p>A stay on his small corner of Catalina would have them floating back home, dreaming in vivid color with digital animation where before they arrived it was only in black-and-white Claymation. The longing for a return, for paradise regained, would begin the minute they left the resort.</p><p>A burst of adrenaline caused Crew\u2019s stomach to tense as he took a stroll around the outside of the building. His staff was busy, doing all the last-minute preparations needed for a successful grand opening. As the small island awoke to a new day, he awaited the twelve o\u2019clock hour \u2014 when the resort doors would open to the public for the first time in ten years.</p><p>Though she wouldn\u2019t be his for too long, when he finally proved her a success, the months he did have her would be glorious, and he would set the standard for the staff to follow. When he finally sold, under the deal with his father, it would be only to someone who would give the Catalina Couture Resort the same tender loving care that he did.</p><p>As he stepped back inside, he was pleased that his marbled floors gleamed, too clean to admit a single germ on their pristine surface. The detailed stained glass sparkled in brilliant colors, the flowers majestic fragrance filled the room, and the Italian granite counters shone. The last of the edibles were being put away in the kitchens, and the final inspection was being performed on the rooms. His project was a work of beauty and she was soon to open her doors.</p> <p>Chapter Three</p><p>Gazing at the man walking from the resort, Haley felt her blood racing as she firmed her shoulders and gave herself a pep talk, which sadly, wasn\u2019t unusual for her. Though she put forth the appearance of a woman who had it all together, she didn\u2019t know how she pulled it off.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t do this,\u201d she whispered to herself, then felt anger well up inside. She was tired of backing down, tired of being afraid of rejection. She wasn\u2019t the horrid being that her evil grandparents had continually made her believe she was. She was a strong, beautiful woman who could speak to a handsome stranger without fear and trembling.</p><p>As a matter of fact, Crew Storm didn\u2019t feel like a stranger to her, because she\u2019d researched the heck out of the man. She needed to know him inside and out if she were to ask him what she was about to \u2014 that was, if she didn\u2019t chicken out.</p><p>Her college professor had suggested a summer assignment just for her. She was to approach a stranger and ask for a date. It didn\u2019t need to be anything more than a ten-minute coffee date, but she still had to ask a man out. He felt this would help her to get over her fears. At first she\u2019d thought he\u2019d gone mad, but as the idea had sunk in, she realized he was right. She could and would ask a man on a date. She just needed someone to teach her how to do it properly.</p><p>Why had she taken the human-sexuality course in the first place? It wasn\u2019t as if it were going to be a part of her career. She was an archaeology major, eager to explore the ruins of ancient civilizations. Living people were trouble; Haley wanted to focus on the dead. Or did she?</p><p>She knew why she\u2019d taken the course. She was tired of being afraid of men. It was ridiculous to make it to the age of twenty-six and still be a virgin. She\u2019d been infatuated with a man on her college campus for two years and yet she couldn\u2019t work up the courage to ask him out on a date.</p><p>Now, she was on Catalina Island with a free two-week stay in an exclusive resort, and it was the perfect time for her to learn how to be a consummate seductress. If she could convince this man to teach her, she could go back to her college and ask the guy of her dreams out to lunch \u2014 maybe even dinner, if she worked up enough courage.</p> <p>Haley watched cautiously as Crew Storm checked every inch of his resort, not the slightest possible flaw invisible to his fastidious blue eyes. If there was something wrong, he would find it. The man\u2019s strides were long and powerful, as if every step he took had a purpose, and there was no wasted energy in his movements.</p><p>He was tall \u2014 intimidatingly tall \u2014 standing a few inches over six feet, making her feel almost dwarflike at five foot six. Working on the island had obviously been good to him. His tan was a creamy golden color, making the blue of his eyes glow from beneath his thick, dark lashes.</p><p>Without a doubt, however, his hair was his best feature \u2014 just long enough for a woman to run her fingers through, then grab a handful and guide his mouth in the direction she most desired.</p><p>Although she hadn\u2019t spoken the words aloud, Haley\u2019s face flamed; she looked around, afraid someone nearby could actually hear her thoughts. What was wrong with her? She didn\u2019t want to appreciate Crew Storm\u2019s beauty; she wanted to hire him.</p><p>She could do this. When she\u2019d found out she\u2019d won the dream vacation, she\u2019d hopped on her computer and researched all she could about the island and the resort. She\u2019d found out the owner was an eligible bachelor and babe magnet. He had a new woman on his arm every week and was exactly the kind of man she needed to teach her how to be what she wanted to be.</p><p>\u201cDo not chicken out!\u201d she snarled under her breath before stepping from the shadows and making her way down the beautiful slate walkway. She\u2019d parked around the corner, since the resort wasn\u2019t open yet and management wasn\u2019t allowing in cars, trying to prevent an early mob.</p><p>Though she should be trying to be a femme fatale at the moment, she was woefully underdressed in her loose linen blouse and jean capri pants. She\u2019d been in school for the past three years, plus working part-time at a small stationary store and she never had the energy to dress up or worry about clothes. It had taken her five years of therapy to work up the courage to go to college in the first place, or she would have been finished with her education by now.</p><p>Though she\u2019d received a large inheritance when she was nineteen, she hated using the money because her grandparents hadn\u2019t wanted her to have it. They\u2019d just never made a will, and because she was their only heir, the money had come to her. She was sure that if they\u2019d taken the time to designate beneficiaries, they would have left it all to their precious birds rather than to her.</p><p>Still, there were times it was necessary for her to dip into her substantial funds. This was one of those times.</p><p>It was now or never.</p><p>\u201cAre you lost?\u201d Haley stopped the shiver fighting to travel down her spine from just the deep timbre of his voice. Oh yes, she had chosen well. This man could teach her all she wanted to know. He was sex personified.</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019m looking for you, Mr. Storm.\u201d</p><p>Nervous tension filled her as his gorgeous eyes gave her body the once-over. When they reached her face, she had the feeling that he\u2019d checked her out and found her wanting.</p><p>Too bad!</p><p>She\u2019d planned this down to the smallest detail, and she\u2019d make him help her.</p><p>\u201cAnd what can I do for you, miss?\u201d</p><p>Oh, the promise in his tone was what women\u2019s wet dreams were made of. She knew he spoke to every woman this way. She\u2019d studied him, read about how effortlessly he flirted \u2014 how women fell at his feet. With one snap of his fingers, females young and old were panting, their salivary glands in overdrive.</p><p>\u201cHaley Sutherland,\u201d she said a little breathlessly as she stuck out her hand.</p><p>After a slight pause, he grasped her fingers and squeezed, then slowly lifted their entwined hands to his mouth and ran his lips across the top of her knuckles, his warm breath brushing over her skin.</p><p>\u201cThis!\u201d Haley practically shouted as excitement filled her.</p><p>Crew\u2019s normal cool seemed to be shaken; he stared at her in confusion. The expression on his face was almost comical as he stood frozen with his lips only a couple of inches from her skin. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI want you to teach me how to seduce someone. I have been reading about you, studying the way you flirt, how you can have any woman you want. I want you to teach me how to get a man, how to make him want me so much that he can\u2019t see straight, how to make him drop to his knees.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUmmm...are you drunk?\u201d Crew asked after a long pause as he dropped her hand and took a retreating step. Haley had no doubt he thought she was crazy. Perhaps she was at the moment.</p><p>However, now that she was warmed up, she couldn\u2019t hold back. She followed his steps, not realizing what she was doing until he bumped against the outside wall of his resort and her hand was pressed against his chest.</p><p>\u201cI know this seems weird, and maybe I should have eased into it, but I am in love with a man who doesn\u2019t know I\u2019m alive and my psych professor suggested that I ask him out as a way of getting over my fears, but I get all tongue-tied around him, which just can\u2019t happen. I want you to teach me how to make him want me \u2014 desire me \u2014 need me! I have money. Lots of it. I\u2019ll pay you any amount you want if you will agree to be my teacher.\u201d</p> <p>Haley didn\u2019t feel a trace of fear as she gazed into Crew\u2019s eyes. All she felt was exhilaration. She knew he could do it \u2014 he could turn her from the wallflower she\u2019d always been into a seductress who would get her man.</p><p>\u201cLet me get this straight. You want to pay me to teach you how to seduce a man?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d she gasped, relieved he was starting to get it.</p><p>\u201cI honestly don\u2019t know what to say.\u201d His tone of voice didn\u2019t alert her at all to what he was thinking.</p><p>\u201cSay yes.\u201d</p> <p>Chapter Four</p><p>Crew couldn\u2019t remember a time in his life when he\u2019d been rendered speechless, not even when his father had given him and his siblings that horrendous ultimatum a couple of years earlier.</p><p>This wisp of a woman, who looked a bit too much like a teenage girl, was asking him to teach her how to be a seductress. If it were dark out, he\u2019d think he was dreaming. Was she a kid, and was he being punked? Or was she a crazy person who\u2019d escaped from a mental hospital?</p><p>Whoever she was, she couldn\u2019t be serious. Who walked up to a stranger and asked such a thing of them? Certainly not a rational person, someone with full brain functionality.</p><p>As he stalled to try to figure out how to make her go away, she pulled her hand back and leaned to her right, her other hand propping on her hip, giving him a glimpse of the curves beneath her baggy blouse. Her foot began to tap, and he noticed her slim ankles, and the smooth skin of her tanned shins.</p><p>Giving Ms. Haley Sutherland a bit more of a thorough evaluation, he decided she couldn\u2019t possibly be a teenager. There was a woman\u2019s body hiding behind all that fabric, and sparks were radiating in her misty eyes, such a pale color of green that they were almost translucent.</p> <p>Her hair was tied back in a very sloppy bun, but tendrils of her long blond hair floated about her face. She was pretty, he decided, but obviously crazy, too, which could be a key reason this man she was in love with avoided her at all costs.</p><p>It was too bad, really, since she was enticing enough to drop a man to his knees if she knew how to put away the crazy talk and maybe choose another outfit. His inner thoughts amused him, and a smile broke free. He hated to disappoint any person of the female persuasion, but it looked as if this was one damsel in distress he wouldn\u2019t be able to help.</p><p>\u201cWell, are you going to just stare at me all day, or are you going to give me an answer?\u201d she huffed, then before he could say anything, she held up her hand. \u201cAnd before you think I\u2019m insane, I guarantee you, I\u2019m not. I am just tired of sitting in a corner, tired of being this invisible person. This is one assignment that I\u2019m determined to get an A on, even if it\u2019s not for credit. You wouldn\u2019t know what it\u2019s like to always be invisible, since you\u2019re gorgeous and wealthy and have women drooling over you, but I am all too aware. It\u2019s lonely and disappointing and I just want a new life for myself.\u201d</p><p>Crew held up his hand to cut her off. Man, could the woman talk, and talk, and talk. To his utter surprise, her babbling was actually getting through to him on some insane level in his brain. He was intrigued by her request.</p><p>How was he supposed to teach her how to catch a guy, though? It wasn\u2019t as if there were books out there on how to seduce a man. Or maybe there were. Hell, he didn\u2019t know. After all, he\u2019d never had to learn the art of seduction. It just came naturally to him, he thought proudly.</p><p>\u201cWhy would you think I\u2019d even consider doing such a thing?\u201d he finally asked, surprised he was in fact leaning toward accepting her wacko proposal. He didn\u2019t have time for this. There was no way. He had a resort to run, and then to sell. When this project was safely locked in the hands of someone else, he had to start all over on his next project. He didn\u2019t have time for crazy females with even nuttier requests.</p><p>\u201cBecause I\u2019ve learned about you. The way you flirt with women is simply effortless. If you teach me how to be one of those women you\u2019d want to be with, then I know I can win my guy. He won\u2019t even know what hit him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow far exactly do you want this to go?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d By the innocent expression on her face, he could see she really had no clue of what he was talking about. With quick movements, he decided to show her.</p><p>In one smooth motion, his arms encircled her, and he backed her against the side of the resort, tucking them both into the shadows and bringing his face to within an inch of hers. The widening of her eyes and quick intake of her breath sent a surge of adrenaline warming his insides. Let her see what happens when she decides to play with fire. By the time he was done with his lesson, she\u2019d run away before he had a chance to blink, and her ridiculous idea would be totally forgotten.</p><p>\u201cDo you want me to teach you how to be a seductress, or teach you how to seduce? I can teach you many things, Haley, but believe me, I don\u2019t need to be paid for my lessons \u2014 at least not in cash.\u201d</p><p>When her cheeks flushed and her eyelids drooped, Crew was overwhelmed with the desire to kiss her. Since she\u2019d be running away screaming in a few moments, he was debating on sampling her lips just one time. Just as he got ready to close the gap between them, her eyes widened and a huge smile spread across her face, causing him to lose his momentum.</p><p>What had just happened?</p><p>\u201cYes! That! That\u2019s what I want you to teach me. Oh, my gosh, I couldn\u2019t breathe for a second there as you were all sultry and sexy and pressing against me. It felt like my stomach was on fire and my heart was going a thousand beats a minute. Teach me how to do that same thing to Walker!\u201d</p><p>The excitement bouncing from her was a real blow to Crew\u2019s ego, especially when she slid out from beneath his arms and danced in a little circle in front of him. But the wide-eyed innocence in her expression made him want to tuck her away and save her from herself.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t do this.\u201d</p><p>For a split second her smile stayed in place, and then her face fell. He felt as if he\u2019d just shot her favorite kitten. She was obviously crushed.</p><p>\u201cI understand. I thought it was a long shot getting you to be my teacher, but a girl\u2019s got to try, right?\u201d</p><p>Were those tears in her eyes? He hated feminine tears, hated the power they wielded. Everyone cried, so why did it make him feel like such a tyrant when a stranger shed a tear or two? Until a few minutes ago, he hadn\u2019t even known Haley Sutherland existed, so what did it matter if she was crying?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Haley. I really am, but I\u2019m a busy man, and I don\u2019t know the first thing on how to teach this kind of...lesson. I\u2019m sure you can find a good self-help book, though, one that will give you all the answers you need. They\u2019re publishing everything nowadays.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019re right, Mr. Storm. I appreciate your listening to me, and thinking about it, even if it was only for a second,\u201d she said, her eyes narrowing at the end of her sentence.</p><p>Without saying anything further, Ms. Haley Sutherland turned and walked away from him. He watched the sway of her curvy hips, and, stupidly, he wanted to shout out to her that she had a few moves already capable of seducing a man, but he knew that would be a mistake.</p><p>The farther away the crazy woman was, the quicker he\u2019d be able to forget about her. Once she had turned the corner, he went back to admiring his resort, his achievement. Unfortunately, as the day progressed and his doors officially opened, one small woman and her ridiculous proposal remained on his mind.</p><p>He knew that the madness would pass soon enough.</p><p>Haley walked away feeling defeated for about five minutes. Once she was out of sight of the resort, she turned back around and glared in the general direction of where she assumed Crew Storm was.</p><p>He was the only man she\u2019d found so far who could teach her how to be the perfect seductress, but he wasn\u2019t the only man capable of teaching her. With relentless determination building inside, Haley walked to her car and looked at her paperwork. She was going to be staying in a tropical paradise in the summertime.</p><p>There were bound to be several single men staying at the luxury resort. At least one of them would take her up on her offer. With a smile, she drove to a small caf\u00e9 where she could comfortably wait for the resort to open.</p><p>Looking around, she thought, It\u2019s all or nothing.</p><p>Haley\u2019s upbringing had been the stuff of horror. It had taken her years of therapy and then college to learn how wrong her grandparents had been in the way they\u2019d treated her. The shame was on them for how they treated her and she shouldn\u2019t feel this much inadequacy. When they\u2019d died and she inherited their money, it had felt not like a victory, but a burden.</p><p>Until now, she\u2019d been unwilling to use her inheritance for anything other than her schooling, so she\u2019d squirreled the money away, living cheaply while working on her bachelor\u2019s degree. Now, she was almost finished with her education, but her line of study wasn\u2019t doing much for her at this particular moment. She had a ways to go before she\u2019d make a real living at it.</p><p>Some people might have thought her vain or irresponsible for rushing off on a quest to learn the art of love, but if they knew about the despair and utter loneliness of the childhood neglect she\u2019d suffered, or about the many years of being picked on and feeling invisible, they\u2019d probably have given her a pass. She wanted to reinvent herself, and nothing was going to stand in her way.</p><p>The spring term had just ended, and with studying for finals and excitement about her trip, she hadn\u2019t had a decent night\u2019s sleep in weeks, and she couldn\u2019t remember the last time she\u2019d thought to feed herself something other than Ramen Noodles and Budget Gourmet. It would be nice to stay in the resort, where she could sleep in without fear of missing school, and eat at the press of a button.</p><p>Once her basic bodily needs had been taken care of, the hunt for a new guy to teach her what she wanted would be on. The perfect place to start would be the resort lounge. From her observations, slightly intoxicated men were far more willing to do the bidding of strange women. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>After finishing her meal and noting the time, Haley drove back to the resort, surprised by the huge line of people parading down the quaint paths. Luckily, valet parking wasn\u2019t too busy, and she had to wait only about five minutes before a good-looking young man opened her car door.</p><p>\u201cSorry about the wait, Miss, but opening day has been busy. Are you staying with us tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes I am, and the wait wasn\u2019t bad at all.\u201d She gave him a huge smile and was delighted when his cheeks flushed. Too bad he was so young \u2014 and so shy. She needed a man, not a boy.</p><p>\u201cUm...just take this slip inside with you, and we\u2019ll be sure to bring your bags to your room,\u201d he stuttered, giving Haley confidence she didn\u2019t know she had.</p> <p>\u201cThank you...,\u201d she said, pausing as she looked at his name tag, \u201c...Sammy. You have a great day.\u201d</p><p>Life was already looking up. As she stepped inside the plush lobby of the resort, Crew was nowhere to be seen, but that was OK with her, because there were plenty of men to take his place.</p><p>As she looked around, she suddenly felt like sinking through the floor. This place was so far out of her league, she felt it was a sin to be standing on the magnificent floors. Though, she had seven figures in the bank, the clientele here spent that kind of money in a month, for vacation homes, expensive cars, and charity donations.</p><p>When her grandparents had died, a big chunk of their estate had been taken in taxes and payment on debts, but she still wouldn\u2019t complain at what she had. She could live comfortably on the interest alone if she chose, but she wouldn\u2019t be able to come to resorts such as this on the money in her bank account.</p><p>Beautifully dressed staff members were walking around the crowded lobby, carrying trays filled with eye-catching appetizers and full glasses of wine in honor of the grand opening. The lobby oozed elegance and perfection. Every last touch seemed to have been planned, down to the minutest detail.</p> <p>Overwhelmed and hoping she hadn\u2019t made a mistake, Haley found she couldn\u2019t get her feet to move. She was underdressed and she stuck out like a sore thumb in the roomful of sophisticated people. Even the cleaning staff were dressed better than she was.</p><p>In every direction she looked, handsome men in hand-tailored suits were standing around chatting with other people also dressed to the nines, or leaning against the romantic railings lining the whimsical staircases.</p><p>This was a high-class place, one where even the floors stood out with their unique marble patterns, and she felt a thrill to be a guest. Not entirely a good thrill, but she refused to allow herself be too intimidated. Though she felt an intense impulse to turn around and run back outside, she fought it and was winning. She wasn\u2019t that girl who was allowed to associate only with the servants and certainly no one of any social standing, not anymore.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t living with her tyrannical grandparents \u2014 they were long gone. She had money, and she could go wherever she felt like going.</p><p>Still, her surroundings filled her with the overwhelming emotion of not being good enough. It was impossible to go through life on the outside, and then suddenly feel as if you were a part of the action. No matter how much was in her bank account, she knew who she was, and she just didn\u2019t fit in with this diamonds-and-caviar crowd. Refusing to cower, though, she raised her chin and squaring her shoulders, sauntered up to the granite-topped front desk, where a smiling woman greeted her.</p><p>\u201cWelcome to the Catalina Couture Resort. We\u2019re delighted to have you on our opening day.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Haley replied as she reached into her purse for her identification and credit card. Though her room was free, she would definitely take advantage of the room service options. This was the vacation of a lifetime and she was going to enjoy every moment, even if she had to plaster a fake smile on her face.</p><p>\u201cYour reservation is all set, Ms. Sutherland. I\u2019ll just have you sign right here, and our bellman will assist you to your room and explain about our services.\u201d With a smile that still betrayed a hint of awe, Haley thanked the woman, grateful for her genuine kindness that somehow settled her nerves, then followed a young man to the elevators, where he pushed the number for the tenth floor.</p><p>When she\u2019d won this vacation, she hadn\u2019t thought she\u2019d get the top floor. This was truly a cream-of-the-crop prize. She\u2019d have a nice view of either the ocean or the island.</p><p>As they began the short journey up, Haley turned toward the kid assisting her. \u201cDo you enjoy working here?\u201d</p><p>His eyes glanced down, but not before settling a split second longer than usual at her chest as he replied. \u201cWe\u2019ve only done training so far, but yes, this place is the breast...I mean...um...best!\u201d he exclaimed; his face reddened and he stared at his shoes in mortification.</p><p>Haley could fully understand the poor kid\u2019s feelings. She had put her foot in her mouth more often than she cared to think about. Patting his shoulder, she waited for him to look up again, which he did with obvious reluctance.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about the slip. I do it often,\u201d she said with a kind laugh. Well, not that particular slip, but...</p><p>He breathed out a sigh of relief and his eyes practically worshipped her. If only she could speak to men she was attracted to as easily as she spoke to service employees. It was just that she felt closer to the workers, as if they were her kin, because she\u2019d been raised by her grandparent\u2019s staff members.</p> <p>\u201cYou have one of our larger suites, reserved for our VIP guests,\u201d the boy said as he stepped from the elevator. He escorted her a short distance down the hallway before sliding a card into a key slot and then holding the door open for her to walk in ahead of him.</p><p>\u201cPerfect,\u201d Haley gasped as she glanced around the spacious living room area. The scent of roses drifted to her from the large bouquet on the coffee table \u2014 with a box of chocolates next to it. The furnishings were antique, matching much of the resort decor. Across the room, opening onto a private balcony, were ornate French doors displaying a spectacular ocean panorama.</p><p>At least if she couldn\u2019t find a man to teach her all she wanted to know, she\u2019d spend two fabulous weeks in complete paradise. This room was too good to be true, and she hadn\u2019t even wandered into the bedroom yet.</p><p>The young bellhop began telling her about all the amenities of the resort: spa, gym, room service, lounges, and more. She didn\u2019t really care. She could learn all of that by looking through the catalog on the small desk in the corner.</p><p>She just wanted some food and a lot of sleep.</p><p>When he finished speaking, she handed him a nice tip and moved him toward the door. He smiled in delight before finally departing. Not wanting to wait for room service, Haley ripped into the box of chocolates, then walked to the small fridge and found a Coke.</p><p>Grabbing her sugary dessert, she carried them to the bedroom, where she smiled in pure happiness. The four-poster king-size bed was heaven on wooden feet. She ripped off her pants and shirt, dived onto the bed, and wriggled gleefully under the covers.</p><p>It didn\u2019t take her long to devour half of the box of chocolates and guzzle down the Coke. She knew she should at least get up and brush all the sugar off her poor teeth, but the feather pillows were calling her name.</p><p>With a sigh, she gave up the fight. Closing her eyes, she indulged in her first good nap in ages. How could she do anything other than relax while in such a fantastic place? Tonight, she needed to be fully alert when she went on the prowl.</p><p>Chapter Five</p><p>Haley awoke with a huge yawn, stretching her arms above her head until she grasped the headboard. She\u2019d left the curtains open and she watched as the last rays of a spectacular sunset glowed through the huge open windows, a salty breeze blowing in from the Pacific Ocean.</p><p>A smile flitted across her face as she let go of the deep cherry wood and sat up. Her days of finals at school and planning her summer assignment had worn her out and she hadn\u2019t rested this well in what seemed like eons. She\u2019d have to find out where Crew purchased his beds because the mattress was simply divine.</p><p>As a loud growl from her stomach interrupted her happy thoughts, Haley laughed, then bounded out of bed. She loved waking, finding herself in a whole new day \u2014 well, a whole new night, since it was beginning to get dark outside.</p><p>Rapidly moving to the bathroom, she stripped down and jumped into the oversized shower, moaning as the forceful jets did their job of fully waking her up and of washing the grime of the day down the drain.</p><p>Maybe it was time she dipped into her inheritance funds for more than her schooling; she had a feeling that after staying in such a nice place, it would be difficult to go back to her small apartment in Seattle. If she could transport this shower, it might not be so bad...</p><p>The brass fixtures and granite tile gleamed, and the beveled glass was crystal clear. The bathroom even had a separate beauty area with a dark velvet bench where she could sit if she wanted to apply makeup and do her hair. It wasn\u2019t her style to get done up, but maybe she should experiment, spend some more time on trying to look her best.</p><p>It was evident that Crew insisted on only the best, because the shampoo was amazing and the scent of peaches and mangoes drifted around her as suds enveloped her hair. Maybe there was something in aromatherapy \u2014 Haley was energized to face the night and Plan B in the seduction stakes.</p><p>Within an hour she was showered, dressed, and ready to seek out conversation and perhaps a bit of food, so she decided on the jazz bar inside the resort. And since Haley had worked a number of years in restaurants, she knew it was wise to make friends with the resort staff and especially the cooks. If you were friendly with them, tipped well, and sucked up a bit, you could eat so much better and get to try dishes no one else knew existed.</p><p>Anticipation hurried her movements. She tucked some cash into her pockets, along with her room key, then grabbed her small handbag. She preferred leaving it behind, but it had a couple of essential items she couldn\u2019t go without.</p><p>Ready to roll. She had a determined set to her mouth as she shut the suite door behind her and made her way toward the elevators. It was time to find a teacher.</p><p>The lobby was even busier now than when she\u2019d arrived, with people speaking excitedly as they sat in the high-backed chairs circling small tables with stunning vases sitting atop them. The flowers had to be real, making her want to touch them to make sure, but she kept on moving forward, on a mission to find a friendly staff member to give her information. She wished she had the courage to sit down and join in a conversation with the other hotel guests, but she didn\u2019t at this point. Maybe soon...</p><p>Put a uniform on a person, and she could open up like a pirated book, but a man wearing a business suit like her grandfather had worn made her want to hide in the farthest corner. She was going to work on that \u2014\u2013 even if it took her a while, as change often did, she\u2019d eventually gain the courage to step outside her comfort zone.</p><p>Approaching the busy bar, she saw and heard an attractive musician playing soft music in the corner. His fingers caressed the keys of the grand piano, and several guests at nearby tables applauded when he finished a piece.</p><p>Hmmm. Those fingers showed promise.</p><p>Haley could picture herself sitting next to him on the bench, his chords washing over her as her own fingers drifted up his thigh. Whoa! Such thoughts weren\u2019t helping her. She had a mission \u2014 a mission to ask the man she liked back home out on a date \u2014 not to hit on every eligible bachelor in this place. All she needed was to find a man willing to give her some pointers, give her some confidence, teach her how to seduce the man she wanted. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>So far tonight, luck was with her: she found an open bar stool at the back of the counter, a spot almost guaranteed, in her experience, to get the most attention from the bartender. Seeing an ashtray nearby, she knew this was where he\u2019d sneak over when he had a few moments to drag in a couple puffs of nicotine.</p><p>\u201cGood evening. What are you drinking?\u201d he asked hurriedly, barely glancing at her. This, Haley was used to. Story of my life.</p><p>\u201cHow about you surprise me? You look like a man who knows how to make a good drink,\u201d she said with an open smile, and she pulled out her emergency cigarettes. She hated the smelly things, but she\u2019d found they could be a great ice-breaker when she was with a smoker.</p><p>That gained his attention. He looked longingly at her thin white cigarette as she lit it with a flick of her cheap plastic lighter. Making sure she didn\u2019t inhale \u2014 she hardly wanted to start coughing all over the poor man \u2014 she took a shallow puff while waiting for him to reply.</p> <p>\u201cAh, an adventurous woman. I like that,\u201d he said with a smile, showing he had one tooth missing in the corner of his mouth. It added character to his leathery cheeks.</p><p>Within a minute, he brought her a large layered cocktail with fruit on a stick. What fun!</p><p>\u201cThis here I call Marlin\u2019s special,\u201d he said with a chuckle. \u201cDo you want to open a tab?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m assuming you\u2019re Marlin?\u201d When he nodded, she continued. \u201cWell, Marlin, that would be lovely. Do you need my credit card or room key?\u201d When his eyes drifted to her dangling cigarette again, Haley remembered to take a puff, before catching his eye.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m being so rude. Would you like one?\u201d</p> <p>Marlin looked around to be sure nothing needed to be done at his bar, and then held out his hand. \u201cThat would be great, and your room key is sufficient.\u201d</p><p>Gotcha! Haley thought. Yes, she knew how to speak to staff.</p><p>Within an hour Haley knew that Marlin had a wife he\u2019d been married to for thirty years, two grown children, and two unexpected, but wanted, surprises. He\u2019d moved to Catalina Island ten years earlier, and he was elated to be working at the Catalina Couture Resort, telling her it was the nicest bar he\u2019d ever run. She had to agree with him there.</p><p>\u201cTry this, honey,\u201d Marlin said as he placed a bowl of soup in front of her.</p><p>Haley didn\u2019t even bother asking what was in it. The intoxicating aroma made her stomach and her salivary glands sit up and take notice. With her first sampling, she couldn\u2019t repress an ecstatic groan.</p><p>\u201cThat there is a chef\u2019s special he only gives to the boss and staff. Don\u2019t ask what he puts in it. Ignorance is bliss,\u201d he said with a cackle.</p> <p>\u201cCan I get a bowl of that?\u201d a man sitting two seats down asked as he eyeballed Haley\u2019s soup.</p><p>\u201cSorry, we don\u2019t serve food,\u201d Marlin told him. The man raised his brows as he looked from Marlin to the bowl of soup in front of Haley. He obviously didn\u2019t want to call Marlin a liar, but the evidence was right there.</p><p>\u201cUm...\u201d the man cleared his throat.</p><p>\u201cHaley works here. She\u2019s just on break,\u201d Marlin lied with a perfect smile at the man, and Haley had to hide her giggle. Yes, she and Marlin were going to be great friends.</p><p>She fearlessly finished her bowl before reluctantly passing it back. It had took the edge off her hunger, but not taken it away. \u201cWhatever his secret ingredients are, they are working for him. Thank you, Marlin. I know where I\u2019m hanging out in the evenings from now on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t complain about that. You\u2019re quite a treat to visit with. How long are you staying with us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I have two weeks that I won for free, but really as long as it takes!\u201d When his eyebrows rose in question, she laughed before filling him in. \u201cI\u2019m looking for a man to teach me how to be the perfect seductress.\u201d</p><p>Marlin\u2019s jaw dropped and he choked on his coffee. Haley wiped the spray from her cheek as he looked her in the eye, obviously trying to figure out whether she was pulling his leg or not. When she stared back, he finally roared with laughter.</p> <p>\u201cWell, I\u2019d offer my services, but then my wife would chop my head off,\u201d he said between bouts of laughter.</p><p>\u201cOh, Marlin, I think you are way too much man for me to handle anyway,\u201d she said with a wink.</p><p>\u201cYou are sure good for my ego, honey. Now, tell me about your plans,\u201d he insisted as he grabbed another cigarette and leaned against the counter so their faces were close together.</p><p>\u201cWell...\u201d She hesitated. \u201cMy original plan was for your boss to teach me, but he isn\u2019t cooperating,\u201d she pouted.</p><p>Marlin\u2019s eyes widened for a second before he burst out laughing again. \u201cOh, Haley, I\u2019m so very pleased I\u2019ve met you. I have a feeling you\u2019re sure going to shake up things around here,\u201d he guffawed.</p><p>Was he making fun of her? Haley wasn\u2019t certain, but she had come too far to turn back now. \u201cTell me about him. How can I get Crew Storm to help me?\u201d</p><p>Marlin looked down the bar, again making sure that his employees were doing their job and that his customers were all happy before he turned back to her and leaned in even closer.</p><p>\u201cCrew is a good guy. Most places like this \u2014 kinda snooty, to tell you the truth \u2014 take one look at me and move on down the line. They want pretty young girls or studly young men to tend the counters, figuring they\u2019ll draw in more people. They don\u2019t look at experience; all they care about is the way a person looks.\u201d</p><p>Sadly, Haley knew this was true.</p><p>\u201cBut not Crew. No siree. He doesn\u2019t mince his words, though. He asked me flat out what happened to my missing tooth. I told him I was young and got in a fight. You want to know what he asked then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Haley said. She hadn\u2019t a clue.</p><p>\u201cHe asks if I won or not,\u201d Marlin said with a laugh. \u201cI proudly told him the other guy went away without three of his teeth.\u201d</p><p>Haley burst into laughter as she looked at Marlin\u2019s gaping grin, but her amusement wasn\u2019t complete. She already knew that she would miss this man when she moved on. She could choose to just live here, but then she\u2019d never finish her degree. She felt a little heartbreak over the inevitable: people always said they\u2019d write, but then friendship would slowly fade into nothing.</p><p>She shook herself out of her melancholy. \u201cWow! You must have been surprised,\u201d she told Marlin.</p><p>\u201cI knew as soon as he gave me that Crew Storm smile that he was a different kind of man \u2014 one of the good guys. He told me he\u2019d both won and lost his own share of fights. Then, he got real professional and asked me what I could do to make this the best bar on the whole island. It took me a minute, then I just told him what I did best. He hired me on the spot, didn\u2019t even hesitate. He said he just got a feeling about people, and he could tell I was the right man for the job.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long have you known him, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGoing on three months now. He interviewed and then I got to work figuring out how I wanted my bar set up. He had his ideas, and let me tell you, Missy, he don\u2019t like anything other than the best. He\u2019s got real nice taste. I\u2019d\u2019ve rather had a jukebox in the corner with some good ol\u2019 rock \u2019n\u2019 roll, but Crew insisted on a piano. I hate to admit it, but I like the piano. It\u2019s real nice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes he pay you well?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah. I have no complaints there. He gives us more than any other place here would and he even offered me and the missus a honeymoon suite. Not right now, \u2019cause it\u2019s gonna be too busy for a while, but in the off season we getta get away from the kids and come be treated to the life of luxury. He works hard and plays even harder. Wow, do the ladies love him! I ain\u2019t seen him go a single day here without at least one hot girl trying to hang all over him. He doesn\u2019t seem like he minds the attention. Not a lick,\u201d Marlin finished with a knowing grin.</p><p>\u201cI just bet,\u201d Haley answered, her eyes narrowing. She\u2019d learned that about him, herself. That\u2019s why she wanted him to be her teacher so dang bad.</p><p>\u201cWell, don\u2019t you worry, honey, he simply gives them a little kiss, then a night of lovin\u2019, then he slips right out of their grasp, and they never knew what hit \u2019em. They think he\u2019s the man of their dreams, but they wake up and it\u2019s all just been one big fantasy. Yet somehow they\u2019re grateful for even just a night. He\u2019s still available for ya. Maybe you can even make the rogue settle down,\u201d Marlin said with a chuckle.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want Crew for myself. I\u2019m in love with another guy. I just want Crew to teach me his secrets \u2014 show me how to be one of those women men can\u2019t resist. But, you know what, I see a bar full of men who would probably be more than willing to teach me what I need to know,\u201d she said as she looked around the room.</p><p>The piano player was looking her way, and before she turned back to Marlin, the man gave her a wink. Oh yes, it was time to come out of her corner and fetch herself a teacher. Who said she couldn\u2019t mix business and pleasure?</p><p>\u201cSure, missy, sure. That\u2019s what they all say. If you think you can dance on a cliff without the wind pushing you over, then you just be my guest, but one night with a man like Crew and you\u2019ll forget all about this other guy you\u2019re trying to win.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll just have to see about that,\u201d Haley said with confidence. \u201cI think I\u2019m going to request a song,\u201d she finished with a wink at Marlin. He just laughed and handed her a fresh drink.</p><p>As Haley stood up, feeling just a bit wobbly from too many of Marlin\u2019s drinks, she wished she knew how to sashay like a model, how to sway her hips provocatively. Oh, well. She\u2019d have to do her best. With glinting eyes and a determined step, she approached the musician, and he wasn\u2019t taking his eyes off her.</p><p>Invisible? Not this time.</p><p>Chapter Six</p><p>Everything was running smoothly. Crew\u2019s staffers, all of whom he\u2019d handpicked, were efficient, unobtrusive, and expert at anticipating a guest\u2019s needs. The customers were smiling and complimentary about his beautiful resort. On top of everything, they were spending \u2014 and spending plenty.</p><p>The kitchen staffers were working nonstop preparing stellar dishes, and room service orders were flooding in. This was a perfect grand opening. But somehow, Crew eventually found himself with a few minutes to spare.</p><p>He was drawn toward the bar, in part because he loved spending a few minutes with his head bartender. Marlin wasn\u2019t a pretty sight, but he was shrewd and knew his business. Each time Crew passed by, business was in full swing.</p><p>Stepping into the dimly lit, smoky room, he closed his eyes for the briefest of moments and enjoyed the sound of ice clinking in glasses while murmurs, chortles, and titters filled the room. Spirits were high, and the cash register was working overtime.</p><p>Business was good.</p><p>When Crew\u2019s potential buyer came in, he\u2019d have nothing to fear in purchasing this establishment. It was a sure investment for anyone who was dedicated to continuing what Crew had started, because Crew didn\u2019t do anything by half measures. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Almost at the bar, he glanced back for the briefest of moments, started to go forward again and then whipped his head back around. He recognized that golden hair, even from a distance. The woman who\u2019d propositioned him was cozying up real close to his pianist, and the guy didn\u2019t seem to mind one bit.</p><p>What should it matter to Crew? He didn\u2019t know her. If she had moved on to find the next man foolish enough to grant her request, then good for her. It meant she\u2019d leave him alone.</p><p>If he felt that way, why was he suddenly changing direction and heading toward the happy couple? He was the owner of this establishment, that was why. He couldn\u2019t have her trying to prostitute herself to his staff. This place wasn\u2019t that kind of business.</p><p>As he approached, he saw her hand lift and settle on Sid\u2019s leg. His piano player just slid her a wink while his fingers continued to fly over the keys.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s lovely,\u201d she purred, her face inches from the guy\u2019s ear. Crew had heard enough.</p><p>\u201cMs. Sutherland,\u201d he said, his voice quiet but hard.</p><p>He had to give the woman credit, because her shoulders tensed in surprise for only the briefest of moments before she turned \u2014 slowly, quite slowly \u2014 to look at him.</p><p>\u201cHello, Mr. Storm. How nice to see you again.\u201d Her voice gave nothing away, but her big green eyes were pretty damned eloquent. The woman didn\u2019t need a teacher; her eyes alone had the power to seduce.</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t expecting to see you again \u2014 ever.\u201d His voice must have been more cold than he\u2019d meant it to be, because his piano player stumbled on his notes before quickly recovering.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m a determined woman, Mr. Storm. Now, if you don\u2019t mind, I was having a conversation with Sid. His music is breathtaking,\u201d she sighed before turning from Crew and giving him the brush-off. He had no idea that inside she was shaking terribly.</p><p>Crew didn\u2019t like her cavalier attitude. He was steaming, though he couldn\u2019t figure out exactly why. Though he\u2019d wanted nothing to do with her proposition, he'd still had the woman on his mind all day, thinking of a million ways he could teach her, and now he found her in his resort looking for a man to fill her...bill. He wasn\u2019t appreciative, not in the least.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to speak to you in private, Ms. Sutherland.\u201d It wasn\u2019t a request, but a command.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a little busy right now. Why don\u2019t we chat tomorrow?\u201d With that, she dismissed him again. Twice in a minute\u2019s time wasn\u2019t doing much for his ego.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t we do it now?\u201d He took her arm and pulled her from the bench. The cowardly pianist continued playing as if Crew hadn\u2019t just manhandled his potential one-night stand. Crew would need to find a new player \u2014 he was disgusted with Sid.</p><p>Haley\u2019s eyes lit up. \u201cIf you insist,\u201d she said, slightly breathlessly, her head bent back so she could gaze at him.</p> <p>His entire body tensed. Why was he attracted to this crazy woman? She was wearing a baggy T-shirt, another pair of loose Capri pants, and not a lick of makeup. There was nothing about her that screamed sex siren, and yet he found himself more than intrigued; what was she trying to hide with all those loose clothes?</p><p>As he started leading her from the bar and toward the lobby, the sound of her breathing shouldn\u2019t have scraped his nerves raw. She just wasn\u2019t his type in any way. Yet even the smell of peaches drifting from her hair was turning him on.</p><p>Maybe it had been too long since he\u2019d spent the night with a woman. Those around him might have thought he was a lady killer, but not that many women had actually made it into his bedroom. He was choosy. Yes, he\u2019d had the occasional one-night stand, but his reputation was a lot more rumor than reality.</p><p>He liked women, didn\u2019t like mistreating them, didn\u2019t like to use them for a night, only to walk away the next day. His father had taught him to be a better man than that. If the world wanted to believe he was a playboy, then let it. That only brought more people out of the woodwork to find out what he was about.</p><p>It was good for business, and it meant more money for him. Though his trust fund was more money than most people ever dreamed of having, it was only his if he passed his father\u2019s ridiculous test.</p><p>One problem: Crew just didn\u2019t care about the challenge anymore. He cared about what path in life he was on. If that meant the old man won, then so be it. Before starting on this resort, Crew hadn\u2019t realized it, but he really hadn\u2019t been able to look himself in the mirror without feeling shame at what he\u2019d become. So much had changed, and he had to admit that he was grateful to his dad.</p><p>He passed the front counter, his staff barely glancing his way before going back to their work. Luckily, Haley had decided to keep her mouth shut while he led her to his private office.</p><p>He placed his hand on the small of her back and let her walk in ahead of him while he enjoyed the gentle sway of her hips. Once inside, he shut and locked the door. He didn\u2019t want interruptions. This woman just had to go away \u2014 he was too busy to deal with her request, or to watch her try to achieve her goals with other men.</p> <p>Crew offered her a chair, then moved behind his desk, thinking it wiser for him to place a solid piece of furniture between the two of them. As she took her time sitting down, he noticed her eyes taking in everything around her. She was observant, well aware of her surroundings. This was a good quality to have, something to admire.</p><p>\u201cI thought my room was nice, but this office is spectacular. I bet you a month\u2019s worth of groceries that the paintings are real,\u201d she said with a whistle.</p><p>Crew was about to make a snarky comment when her words hit him. \u201cYour room?\u201d He wanted clarification.</p><p>\u201cYes. I checked in tonight. I have to tell you, you know how to decorate. My room is fantabulous, and I haven\u2019t seen one tiny grain of sand inside this entire resort. That\u2019s impressive, considering we\u2019re right on the beach.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy did you check in?\u201d he growled, coming right to the point.</p><p>\u201cBecause I won a terrific prize package back in Seattle and I get two spectacular weeks here. Are you saying I\u2019m not welcome?\u201d she asked a bit too innocently.</p><p>\u201cI told you I wasn\u2019t willing to play your games, Haley, and yet you stalk me. Why not just leave?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI accepted your answer, Mr. Storm. Was I following you tonight? Did I seek you out? No, I did not. Just because you won\u2019t give me what I want doesn\u2019t mean that I will simply give up. I have a mission to complete, and there are plenty of men out there who can help me. Maybe I haven\u2019t seen any as charming as you \u2014 OK, charming at times \u2014 or with your knowledge of what it is that makes a woman sexy, but their advice and teaching should be enough to guide me to become the woman I wish to be. Besides, who in their right mind would give up two free weeks here?\u201d she asked, looking at him as if he were certifiable.</p><p>Crew\u2019s vision was starting to blur. She spoke with such conviction that he had no doubt she would succeed in finding a suitable man. Shouldn\u2019t that be a good thing for him? She\u2019d be out of sight, out of mind, not his problem. Unfortunately, she was his problem \u2014 for no reason he could figure, he actually cared what happened to her, and he shouldn\u2019t. Sheesh. He\u2019d met this woman only this morning.</p><p>He had plans \u2014 goals \u2014 and he couldn\u2019t afford any distractions right now. His father would be here soon, and though Crew didn\u2019t care about his stupid trust fund any longer, he needed to prove to the man who had raised him that neither of them had wasted their time and effort.</p><p>\u201cWho is this man you seek to attract? Why would you want someone who doesn\u2019t want you for who you are? I\u2019m really just curious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho he is doesn\u2019t matter. As for wanting me for who I am, that\u2019s more difficult. You wouldn\u2019t know anything about not being raised as a Storm, not having a privileged life from the moment you were born. You\u2019ve always had everything, never had to struggle; you\u2019ve never gone through troubles. You were born wealthy and beautiful. There is no way you could possibly have a clue what it\u2019s like for those of us on the other side,\u201d she spat out.</p><p>\u201cI am not a snob.\u201d He was insulted she\u2019d even think such a thing.</p><p>\u201cHa! I have always wondered if snobby people realize they\u2019re snobs. Do they go to bed at night thinking they\u2019re better than others? Do they snicker at people less fortunate than they are and go out of their way to make the poor saps\u2019 lives miserable? Or do they not know the pain and suffering they cause? As I look at the confusion in your eyes, I think I have my answer. Maybe some of them do and some of them don\u2019t. But I will tell you this: my years of school were a misery. The girls tormented me, called me names, made me feel horrible about myself. They sought joy through the pain they inflicted on me and others. Did it make them feel better about themselves, superior? Maybe. Maybe not. I really don\u2019t care. My revenge comes by having a good life now. I get revenge through my success. Part of that is by changing from being a girl who was so persecuted that I had to hide in the shadows just so they wouldn\u2019t notice me. I am done being afraid. I am done letting what other people think about me predict my actions. I am also done speaking to you. There is no way you will ever understand any of this.\u201d</p><p>Haley started to stand and Crew felt a moment\u2019s panic. What she said tore at him. Had he ever made someone feel like this? Either knowingly or unknowingly? If he had, it was unacceptable and to his eternal shame. He could never be OK with hurting another human for his own personal gain or pleasure.</p><p>\u201cPlease sit.\u201d His tone had calmed; his anger was deflated. How could he be angry with this woman, a woman who had so much hurt evident in her eyes? How could he possibly turn her away? Though he knew better than to accept her offer, he somehow couldn\u2019t chase away the desire to help.</p><p>And he knew he would regret this before the words came from his mouth.</p><p>\u201cI will help you.\u201d</p><p>At first she just stared, but joy quickly overspread her face.</p><p>Crew shook his head gently. \u201cHold on before you get too excited. You have much more inside you than you realize, Haley. There is fire brewing in your veins, passion in your eyes, and what I\u2019m sure is a pretty spectacular body beneath your ridiculously baggy clothes. I will help you to see yourself \u2014 not help you change who you are. There is nothing I see that needs changing.\u201d</p><p>He could tell by the shocked look on her face that she didn\u2019t believe him for a second. How cruel people must have been to her.</p><p>\u201cI need to know a little bit about you,\u201d he continued. \u201cWhere you grew up. What your dreams are. What things you are attracted to. Before I can show you who you truly are, I need to know who you think you are.\u201d</p><p>Confusion covered her face. It was obvious she really had no idea of her own appeal. Her light green eyes peered at him through her befuddlement. Her soft blond hair cascaded down her back, most of it having worked loose from her sloppy bun. Even without makeup, she was a beauty. With it, she\u2019d look like any one of the women who so confidently threw themselves at him. He preferred her the way she was now \u2014 well, maybe with tighter clothing. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI am just me. You know my name\u2019s Haley Sutherland. I\u2019m twenty-six; I went to school in Washington state. I grew up with my grandparents, but they passed away several years ago. I have no idea who my dad is, and my mom died during childbirth. I have no other family members. My life has been boring up until now. I\u2019m ready for excitement.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThose are facts I could find out from the most basic of background searches. I will only agree to do this if you share with me \u2014 really share. I grew up with a younger sister who loved to talk, and talk often, so I know a little bit about what it is that makes women tick. I want to know your dreams, what excites you, what makes your heart pound. I need to know your fears, your darkest desires, the things you\u2019ve thought about but never imagined telling anyone. I want to know you, Haley, not the image you show the world.\u201d</p><p>Crew watched as the shutters came down on her revealing eyes, closing him out. She was hiding something from him, and the competitive man he was wanted to know all her deepest secrets. He wanted to strip her bare, take her apart, and then help to build her back up. After all, that\u2019s what he did, wasn\u2019t it? He made things whole again. It couldn\u2019t be any more difficult than fixing a failing business.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want a mental makeover. I want you to teach me how to seduce a man. If I wanted to talk about my pathetic life, I\u2019d see a psychiatrist.\u201d</p> <p>Her snappy response showed him just how much she was holding back. Well, he would just have to call her bluff. If she walked, that was it. There was nothing he could do about it. He feared curiosity would eat him alive, but only for now. He\u2019d eventually forget about her.</p><p>\u201cThen we have nothing else to discuss. You can enjoy your stay in the resort, but I have more important things to do.\u201d Crew looked down at his desk, opened a drawer and pulled out a cigar, then snipped the end. He didn\u2019t indulge often, but when stress was at a peak, the smooth flavor of a good Cuban could ease his nerves.</p><p>Haley sat fuming as he waited for her to make a decision. Though he gave her no sign of what he was feeling, while he leaned back and propped his feet on the desk as if he didn\u2019t have a care in the world, his muscles were taut.</p><p>Crew played to win. There was no use in entering this game with her if she wasn\u2019t putting all her cards on the table. When the silence grew too long, he looked pointedly at his clock, and then at her face.</p><p>He almost feared seeing fire shooting from her eyes as she realized the bind she was in. For her to walk away when he\u2019d agreed to her proposal would be mad on her part, but she clearly wanted to tell him to shove it.</p> <p>Chapter Seven</p><p>\u201cFine. If you insist on trying to understand me, I\u2019ll tell you, but I\u2019m tired right now and don\u2019t feel like talking,\u201d Haley responded. \u201cIt\u2019s been a long day.\u201d</p><p>She wanted to get up and kick his feet from the desk, then grab his stupid cigar and take a big puff for herself. But that would only end with her hacking up a lung, so she sat stiffly while she waited for whatever he had to say next.</p><p>\u201cGood. Now that we have the practicalities out of the way, I can learn a little more about you.\u201d</p><p>The man just didn\u2019t listen. She didn\u2019t want to discuss anything about herself. She needed time to come up with a convincing story for him. There was no way she would tell him about the hell she\u2019d gone through living with psychotic grandparents who had wished she were dead every single day of her life.</p><p>She\u2019d buried the past, and to dig it back up again would do too much damage. It would destroy everything she\u2019d worked at building over the last eight years. The moment they buried her bitter grandparents in the ground, she\u2019d been freed. It had just taken her a long time to figure that out. To tell the truth, she was still learning.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so, Haley. I believe you need time to regroup, time to come up with a clever story. I don\u2019t want to give you that time. I won\u2019t force you to tell me your entire life story, but I\u2019d at least like to know something about you. Give me a small piece and I\u2019ll call it a night.\u201d</p><p>Haley scrambled to come up with something that wasn\u2019t too revealing, but the man seemed to have a built in radar for lies. It seemed that she had no choice but to part with a few honest details. In the end, it would all be worth it, because then she\u2019d be one of those women she\u2019d always admired, and she\u2019d be free of the past.</p><p>\u201cI plan on discovering an ancient culture that no one has ever discovered before. I don\u2019t care where, but I want to do an archeological dig. Ancient peoples fascinate me \u2014 how they worked so well together, how they survived such harsh conditions, and how they continued to procreate. I also have a fascination for old journals and the lives of people who lived before I was ever born.\u201d Maybe she\u2019d revealed just a little more than she\u2019d planned to, but when she spoke of her dream, she tended to get excited.</p><p>His eyebrows rose and the corners of his lips turned up. She had the sudden urge to smack the look off his face. The thought stunned her; she\u2019d never felt desire to hit anyone, not ever, not even when those horrid kids at school had made her feel two inches tall.</p><p>\u201cDo you have a journal of yours I can read?\u201d</p><p>Now he was mocking her! She was done.</p><p>Haley stood quickly and began moving toward the door. There was nothing that made sitting here any longer worth it. She\u2019d rather die a wallflower than be constantly humiliated.</p><p>\u201cHaley, I was just kidding. You have to learn the difference between a joke and the intent to harm another person. I wasn\u2019t making fun of you,\u201d he said as he caught up to her at the door and gripped her arm.</p> <p>A sensual fire shot down her arm from the touch of his firm grasp on her bare skin. Her legs felt weak and she was afraid to look up into his eyes. This wasn\u2019t what she wanted. She didn\u2019t want to feel an overwhelming sense of desire for a man she needed only as a teacher.</p><p>\u201cHaley.\u201d The deep tone of his voice sent butterflies to her stomach. She needed to regroup. Subduing the strange feelings as forcefully as she could, Haley squared her shoulders and lifted her head, crooking the corner of her mouth and gazing at him with total disregard.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t hurt my feelings, Crew. I\u2019m just done for the night. We can begin my transformation tomorrow.\u201d She was quite proud of her performance.</p><p>She knew as he gripped both her arms and pulled her close to him, though, that she hadn\u2019t fooled him. Still, she didn\u2019t reveal the effect he was having on her. That would be giving up too much, and she couldn\u2019t let the tables turn completely in his favor. She had pride, and she\u2019d sunk as low as she was willing to allow herself.</p><p>\u201cMmm, Haley. The more I think about this, the more I am liking it. Can you feel the sparks?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat sparks?\u201d she bluffed.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to say it out loud. I can see the fire in your eyes, and I can feel your thighs quivering.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet go,\u201d she demanded, enraged that she was exposing so much of herself and her feelings to him when all she wanted was to run and hide. After all, that\u2019s what she was best at doing.</p><p>Crew held her for just a moment longer \u2014 just long enough to let her know he was stronger, could take what her eyes were offering him \u2014 then, he finally released his grip.</p><p>Haley wanted to bolt, run to her room, lock the door, and then slide down it and fold into herself. She wanted to do what she\u2019d always done. But, wasn\u2019t this her seduction makeover? Wasn\u2019t it time for her to be that wanton woman she\u2019d fashioned in her brain?</p><p>Before she could talk herself out of it, Haley reached up and grabbed his neck, pulling his head down to hers. She gloried in the shocked look in his eyes just before their lips connected.</p><p>\u201cLesson One: Take What You Want,\u201d she whispered. As his lips touched hers and his tongue quickly demanded entrance, Haley was nearly knocked flat. She was grateful there was a door behind her, because she had to lean against it as heat pooled deep within her.</p><p>Her mind blanked while her body flamed and their tongues danced back and forth between them. It was the steamiest kiss she\u2019d ever shared \u2014 not that she\u2019d shared many. Two, in fact, before this one.</p><p>When her brain started to completely short-circuit, she knew it was time to pull back. With extreme reluctance she broke the connection of their lips, with her tongue automatically emerging one last time to lick his flavor from her mouth.</p><p>\u201cWell, that wasn\u2019t unpleasant,\u201d she said with a laugh that was far too breathy, and not as casual as she\u2019d intended. If only she could clear the fog from her dazed brain, she could think enough to turn and leave the room. Eventually she got her feet to cooperate.</p><p>\u201cOh, no,\u201d Crew said with a huge smile as his hands shot around her and grabbed her from behind. \u201cLesson Two: When You Play with Fire, You Get Burned.\u201d</p><p>Before Haley could reply, he pulled her tightly against his body, the rock-hard evidence of his arousal pressing into her stomach as he leaned down and began kissing her again as if they\u2019d never paused.</p><p>Taking a step back, he pressed her against his door, then moved his hands down the curve of her backside as he lifted her off her feet so he could press his straining manhood against her heat.</p><p>His mouth ravished hers, showing no mercy as he stole the air right from her lungs, and sizzled her skin. She forgot why she needed to stay in control, forgot everything as he continued taking her deeper and deeper into the throes of passion.</p><p>Had she known years earlier how explosive a kiss could be, she wouldn\u2019t have remained a virgin, wouldn\u2019t have let her grandparents\u2019 constant voice in her head keep her from enjoying something so amazing.</p><p>For the first time ever, she was alive, wanting only to sink further and further into sensation, to feel the passion he was so easily igniting. She pressed against him, her hands fisting in his hair as she silently begged him to continue \u2014never, ever to stop filling her with the magical emotions she was losing herself in.</p><p>When a low growl rumbled deep in his chest, a feeling of power surged through Haley at her beginner\u2019s luck. She\u2019d turned this man into an animal bent only on fulfilling his needs. She\u2019d brought this handsome, powerful playboy to a state of no return.</p><p>When his mouth softened on hers, she wanted to scream out in passion. When he pulled back, sliding his tongue across her bottom lip before pulling all the way back and setting her on her feet, she felt disoriented, not even sure if she could stand.</p><p>\u201cDo you still think there are no sparks, Haley?\u201d he asked, his voice drifting over her as his breath warmed her neck. She thought she felt the barest of kisses, but then he pulled back so she was looking into his eyes.</p><p>Haley didn\u2019t know how to respond. Should she be flippant? Laugh it off? Or should she just run away until she figured it out?</p><p>No.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve had better,\u201d she finally managed to reply, her voice not particularly thick and uneven. He narrowed his eyes before he leaned into her for the briefest of moments, showing her again what their kisses had done to him \u2014 how hard he was.</p><p>\u201cI somehow don\u2019t think so,\u201d he answered confidently. \u201cGo get some rest. You will need it,\u201d were his last words before he grabbed her hand and pulled her away from the door so he could open it. \u201cWould you like me to escort you upstairs?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The knowing tone of his voice had her back straightening. \u201cI\u2019m capable of reaching it safely in your well-secured resort,\u201d she said, acting casually as she stepped through the door. \u201cSweet dreams,\u201d she threw over her shoulder as her gaze slid down his body and landed pointedly on his bulging pants.</p><p>The curse word that followed her down the hall lifted her spirits.</p><p>Power.</p><p>She now knew what it was like to feel power in the arms of a man. As Haley made her way dreamily up the elevator and let herself into her suite, she didn\u2019t even realize she hadn\u2019t once thought about Walker, the man she...wanted.</p> <p>Chapter Eight</p><p>Two months earlier</p><p>Joseph and George pulled up to the Storm Corporate offices and looked at each other. The building was sleek and modern, not overly large, but charming and well-built; it fit in nicely with the busy business district.</p><p>Large glass panels reflected the sun, announcing its presence among the other structures around it. The brothers made their way inside and nodded with appreciation at the appealingly cut gray marble. The silver and black color scheme and modern decor of the building\u2019s interior welcomed visitors but filled them with awe at the same time.</p><p>\u201cIt seems our brother has true Anderson blood running through his veins. He has good taste.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe certainly does. Now remember, we don\u2019t want to overwhelm him,\u201d Joseph reminded George.</p><p>\u201cI think he\u2019s going to be quite shocked when he faces us, Joseph. There\u2019s no getting past the good looks that run in our blood,\u201d George joked.</p><p>\u201cWell, when you\u2019re right, you are right,\u201d Joseph said with a wink.</p><p>They approached the front desk, where a pretty young secretary looked up with a professional smile before her expression froze and she did a double take. It was almost comical to see her eyes flash between George and Joseph\u2019s faces.</p><p>\u201cUm...how...how can I help you?\u201d she stuttered as she tried to gather her wits.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re here to see Richard Storm.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDo you...um...have an appointment?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, darling, we don\u2019t, but I think he\u2019ll want to meet with us,\u201d Joseph said as he leaned forward and gave her his most appealing smile. He was a master negotiator, after all.</p><p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t normally see people without an appointment,\u201d she answered, still a bit shell-shocked.</p><p>\u201cI think he\u2019ll make an exception. Just let him know it\u2019s relatives of his,\u201d George told her with a wink.</p><p>The woman fumbled for the phone and pressed a button. She leaned away, speaking quietly, but the two men were both sure she was saying something like Richard\u2019s look-alikes are here. They\u2019d had a few hours to process the possibility of having a brother. The rest of the world was in for a big shock.</p><p>\u201cHis executive secretary said to come on up. He\u2019s on the twelfth floor. She\u2019ll see you there,\u201d the woman said and handed them both an elevator pass.</p><p>After thanking her, the two headed straight but not swiftly to the elevator. Neither of them would admit to the nervous butterflies dancing around in their stomachs, but they pressed the button for the twelfth floor in silence and just stared at the metal doors.</p><p>They got the same reaction from the woman behind another efficient modern desk when they introduced themselves as Joseph and George Anderson.</p> <p>\u201cWhat is your business with Mr. Storm?\u201d She was keeping it together a bit more than the first woman, but they could see that she couldn\u2019t stop looking at them both with a wary and assessing eye.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s private family business, ma\u2019am,\u201d George calmly stated.</p><p>After a moment on the phone, she hung up and faced them. \u201cFollow me, please.\u201d Neither of them was surprised. They weren\u2019t used to being denied anything they wanted, so they\u2019d have been more shocked had they not gotten in.</p><p>When the secretary knocked on a door, a voice called out telling them to enter. The man had his back to them as he looked out his window at the picturesque view of the Sound. Both Joseph and George had spent a lot of their own time in a similar position in front of their office windows.</p><p>The woman left the room, though they could see her reluctance and the curiosity in her eyes as she casually departed. They noticed that she left the door open. Joseph also noticed the guard not far away, prepared to rush forward in an instant if he was needed.</p><p>When Richard Storm turned around with an indulgent smile on his face as if he were about to appease a couple of batty old men, it didn\u2019t take long for his jaw to slacken as he stared at the two strangers.</p><p>\u201cHello Richard. This is my brother, George, and I\u2019m Joseph. We believe we have a lot to talk about,\u201d said Joseph as he approached the man he had no doubt was his brother.</p><p>After a moment\u2019s pause, Richard pulled himself together and held out a hand. \u201cHave we met before?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Trust me, we\u2019d all remember,\u201d George cut in as he took the man\u2019s hand next. \u201cWe believe we\u2019re related, though.\u201d There was no need to beat around the bush. They\u2019d already lost sixty-plus years.</p><p>\u201cI can see why you\u2019d think so. How do you know about me? I have been careful over the years to stay out of the media. Who are you?\u201d As if he were unable to stand anymore, he moved to a seating area in the corner of his spacious office and sank down into a chair.</p><p>The Anderson brothers joined Richard. \u201cLet me explain...\u201d George said.</p><p>Joseph pulled out the documents they\u2019d brought and George told Richard what they\u2019d put together that afternoon, with Joseph filling in any gaps. Richard said nothing at all. After half an hour, the three men sat there just staring at each other.</p><p>\u201cThis can\u2019t be. My parents...they were good people,\u201d Richard finally choked out as he looked at the compelling evidence before him.</p><p>\u201cWe can always get blood tests,\u201d Joseph said, firmly but gently. \u201cI think that would be a good idea, but it\u2019s like looking in a mirror to be staring at you. You can see the picture of our father here. We take most after him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy father was Thomas Storm no matter what a blood test says,\u201d Richard said automatically.</p><p>\u201cYes, he raised you and obviously loved you, but I believe you are our brother. I believe our mother and father never knew you existed.\u201d Joseph said the words in the kindest way he could, but Richard had to know the truth. They couldn\u2019t possibly lose any more time.</p><p>\u201cI just don\u2019t understand. If this is true, maybe your parents didn\u2019t want three children. Maybe they\u2019d made a deal with my parents...\u201d The man was reaching for straws, not wanting to believe his parent would be capable of kidnapping.</p><p>\u201cThat is something we will never know, Richard, and it\u2019s something we don\u2019t have to know. Your parents obviously loved you, as ours loved us. We just want you to be a part of our lives if you\u2019re our brother. Family is very important to us,\u201d George said as he leaned forward.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what to say. I need some time. I will send for blood tests right away, though. I have never been a man to hide from the truth, and if you are my brothers, I would very much like to know about you and your families.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat goes the same for us, Brother. I don\u2019t know what made you decide to move back to Seattle, but we are grateful it happened,\u201d George said with a big smile.</p><p>The men chatted for a few minutes more before Joseph and George left.</p><p>They took the blood tests the next day and, with the help of their wealth and influence, had their answer by that afternoon. Richard Storm was indeed their brother, with identical DNA. That didn\u2019t answer the question of how he\u2019d been separated from them at birth, whether Richard\u2019s adoptive parents had taken him, or whether their biological parents had given him up, but Joseph and George knew their parents \u2014 knew they would never part with one of their own.</p><p>They didn\u2019t need to repeat that to Richard, however. The past couldn\u2019t be changed, and all they could do from this moment on was to get to know one another, become the family they should have been all along. It might be a long journey, but family bonds were hard to break, and determination was in the Anderson blood.</p><p>The hearts of all three men raced as they considered the prospect of learning about each other and their thriving families.</p><p>Chapter Nine</p><p>Crew sat back and finished his cigar while he waited for his body to return to normal. Haley Sutherland might have thought she needed training on how to become the perfect seductress, but if the way she\u2019d kissed was any indication, she was miles ahead of any woman he could think of off the top of his head.</p><p>Damn, his body was on fire, and he didn\u2019t see it returning to a functioning state any time soon. She\u2019d set his world spinning, and he suspected it wasn\u2019t going to stop until he taught her a few horizontal lessons.</p><p>The smile spreading across his lips caused faint crow\u2019s-feet to crinkle at the corners of his eyes. He would bet his resort that she was fire beneath the sheets. All of that repressed energy would explode as he sank deep within her heat.</p><p>He groaned. Those thoughts hadn\u2019t helped at all \u2014 his erection was now pulsing painfully in his pants. He desperately needed something, anything as a distraction.</p><p>As if on cue, his telephone rang and he picked up without thinking.</p><p>\u201cCrew Storm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m heading down there soon, and I have company.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDad?\u201d The brisk excitement in his father\u2019s tone surprised him. He couldn\u2019t remember hearing him so elated, not in years, at least.</p><p>\u201cOf course, it\u2019s your father. Who else?\u201d he asked sourly.</p><p>\u201cSorry. What\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou remember when I called you a couple of months ago about those two men stopping by my office?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVaguely. You said they might be relatives of ours or something.\u201d Crew had been tied up in last-minute preparations for the resort. He could barely remember the conversation.</p><p>\u201cWell, they are related. That\u2019s all I\u2019m going to say until we get there. I want you to see for yourself. I will tell you that I\u2019ve gotten to know them and they are good men \u2014 very good men. I think you will like them. I think they may even rival us in large families,\u201d he said with a sly chuckle.</p><p>\u201cSounds good, Father. It\u2019s nice for you to find some long-lost relatives. But I thought your adoption records were sealed. Are you sure you want to open all of that up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m absolutely sure, son,\u201d he answered.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good.\u201d Crew didn\u2019t know what else to say.</p><p>\u201cHow did your grand opening go? I\u2019m looking forward to seeing what you\u2019ve achieved.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt went even better than I\u2019d hoped. A lot has changed since you were here six months ago. I will miss this place...\u201d he sighed as he looked around his office. The more he thought about it, the more he didn\u2019t want to let her go. Still, he was sure his attachment would fade as the excitement of new beginnings wore off.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to, Crew. I know I told you that was the deal \u2014 that you all make a profit selling the businesses \u2014 but I think you\u2019ve learned what I wanted you to. I\u2019m very proud of you. In the end you have to choose if you want to settle in one place, or if you\u2019ve found your passion and want to do it again and again with new projects.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The sudden choking in his father\u2019s voice came through the telephone line loud and clear. Crew didn\u2019t know what to say. In all his life, he\u2019d never heard his father cry. It just didn\u2019t happen.</p><p>Crew quickly changed the subject. \u201cGive me the dates you\u2019re coming down so I can make sure to have our best rooms available for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll need three rooms, and any will do. The point is to see you, not to vacation,\u201d Richard said, then he promised to give his son a heads up when he knew a more exact time of his arrival.</p><p>\u201cThree rooms? I\u2019ll have to check, but I save a block for emergencies, so I think we\u2019ll be fine.\u201d He paused for a moment. It needed to be said, but it was hard for him to get the words to come out. \u201cDad, you did a good thing \u2014 a really good thing.\u201d</p> <p>Crew wasn\u2019t going to elaborate. His father had a big enough head already. When Richard was silent for several seconds, Crew thought they might have lost the connection. Then, he realized that his dad was just trying to regain his composure.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Crew. Now, enough business talk. Have you managed to find a woman yet?\u201d</p><p>Classic. The statement made Crew laugh into the phone receiver. \u201cNo, father. I\u2019m not looking for love. One step at a time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know, you aren\u2019t getting any younger, boy. You\u2019ll be thirty-five on your next birthday. It\u2019s time to settle down and keep the family name alive. A good woman will add years to your life.\u201d</p><p>Something about the sadness of his tone alerted Crew that something was wrong, but he couldn\u2019t figure out what it might be. It was most likely just his imagination, anyway. His father was as strong and vibrant as ever. If anything were worrying him, he would be sure to tell his children, despite their reprehensible behavior before Richard finally laid down the law.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not quite ready, Dad, but I\u2019ll let you know when I find the one. As for kids, I don\u2019t see that happening. I\u2019m not the \u2018dad type,\u2019\u201d he said, taking a large puff from his cigar and blowing the air out.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s utter nonsense, boy!\u201d his father snapped, sounding much more like himself.</p><p>The tense muscles in Crew\u2019s neck relaxed. One worry down. And at least he wasn\u2019t thinking about bedding Haley Sutherland. Unfortunately, if it wasn\u2019t one kind of stress, it was another. His arousal had disappeared, and his father seemed just fine, but once again, he had his father on his back, pushing him to get married and settle down. It seemed there would be no relaxation for him today.</p><p>\u201cDad...\u201d he warned.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m getting to be an old man, Crew, and I demand to have some grandchildren before the good Lord decides to take me from this earth. I don\u2019t see what\u2019s so wrong with that request. Why, most people my age have at least ten grandchildren, but oh no, not me. My kids don\u2019t think about raising the next generation. They don\u2019t think about bringing me some happiness in my declining years...\u201d Richard continued to rant for several long minutes, making Crew set down the phone and rush to the liquor cabinet, where he poured himself a shot of scotch. He needed something warm and soothing in his bloodstream. He knew this stupid speech by heart \u2014 he\u2019d been hearing it for years, and he knew he wouldn\u2019t miss a thing.</p><p>When Crew picked the phone back up, his father was nearing the end of his whine. \u201c...and that\u2019s why you need to settle down!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019d better not be doing any more scheming. I still haven\u2019t forgiven you for that time Sue Ellen and I managed to get locked in the boathouse overnight when I was twenty-four,\u201d Crew reminded his father.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about. I wasn\u2019t the one who locked you in, if that\u2019s what you\u2019re implying. But, at the age of twenty-four, you were more than ready to be married. Heck, by now, you should have at least three kids. I wouldn\u2019t mind each of you having a dozen of the little ankle-biters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI get it, Dad. You want grandkids. Talk to Lance. He\u2019s more likely to give them to you than the rest of us.\u201d</p><p>Crew felt a slight pang at selling out his brother, but Lance was more the father type, if there were such a thing. Their dad, with his incredible dedication, had given his children a great example of what a father should be, and it wasn\u2019t that Crew didn\u2019t want kids; it was just something he didn\u2019t anticipate in the foreseeable future. Time to cut this call short.</p><p>\u201cHey, Dad. I\u2019m sorry, but I\u2019m getting a call on the other line,\u201d he told him, grateful for the flashing red light. He wouldn\u2019t tell an outright lie, but he\u2019d suffered through his father\u2019s guilt trip long enough; reports of zombies in the spa pool might have sounded good in comparison.</p><p>\u201cFine, fine. But you\u2019ll have no choice but to listen when I show up down there,\u201d Richard said.</p><p>\u201cYes, you can give me the talk about family obligation again, and again, very soon,\u201d Crew told him. His tone was genial, and he hoped his remark wouldn\u2019t set his dad off. Luckily, it didn\u2019t, and he was able to say goodbye.</p><p>Crew missed the incoming call, but wasn\u2019t too worried about it. After hanging up the phone, he looked at the clock and found to his surprise that it was nearing midnight. Time really flew when you weren\u2019t having fun. Since he had an early-morning meeting, he decided to call it a night.</p> <p>Switching his phone over to the emergency desk, Crew locked up the office and headed to his private suite.</p><p>Had he known he was going to spend the night sweating in bed with erotic dreams starring Haley, he\u2019d have stayed up and caught up on work instead.</p><p>Chapter Ten</p><p>Crew woke up in a foul mood. He\u2019d tossed and turned most of the night, finally giving up on sleep at five in the morning, stumbling from his bed and heading straight to the shower.</p><p>He would have just guffawed had a fortune-teller laid out his tarot cards and said: \u201cI see in your future a crazy blond woman wearing shapeless clothes. She will approach you with an indecent proposal, and you\u2019ll be unable to do anything but think about her.\u201d</p><p>Both awake and asleep.</p><p>After washing the sweat from his body, Crew planned his day. There was no time like the present, he decided, to begin his damnable lessons. In order for Haley to become the seductress she wanted to be, she needed first to feel like a beautiful woman.</p><p>This was something Crew knew how to do. He loved the courting game, though it had been a while. A man who didn\u2019t spoil his woman or treat her like his most valuable treasure wasn\u2019t worthy of her love. And, hey, it could be fun.</p><p>Romance didn\u2019t always mean large gestures. Often it was the small things that mattered most. A note telling her how beautiful she was, a single rose laid upon her pillow at night, a chocolate sitting next to her coffee cup. Small things to let her know she was always on his mind.</p><p>Crew was often confused by his fellow men. He didn\u2019t see how guys were so blind to what women wanted and needed. Haley wanted to make men flock to her, but it would help her to find out \u2014 and she was about to \u2014 why women flocked to him, and how he chose a woman.</p><p>Once she knew how incredibly intoxicating she was, she\u2019d be the type of girl he would have approached a week ago. Her only flaw was her lack of confidence. She didn\u2019t realize it, but the only thing he was teaching her was how to love herself \u2014 everything else would easily fall into place for her after that.</p><p>First on his list of to-dos was to order a large bouquet of pink and purple stargazer lilies, making sure the greenery matched the color of her eyes and the flowers themselves were fragrant enough that each time she entered the room, their smell would tease and delight her senses.</p><p>He also ordered breakfast to be delivered, heading to the kitchen himself to ensure that no mistakes were made. He\u2019d yet to find a woman who couldn\u2019t be seduced by silky chocolate and vibrant flowers. The longer she was with him, the more expensive the gifts, but in the beginning, subtlety was best.</p><p>Sliding the delicate chocolate truffles onto her plate and attaching a note, Crew smiled and waited for her call. It didn\u2019t take long \u2014 about twenty minutes, in fact.</p><p>\u201cCrew?\u201d her sleepy voice drifted through the phone line, to his ear.</p><p>\u201cSpeaking,\u201d he said softly as he made his way toward her room.</p><p>\u201cYou have an impressive way of wangling a breakfast invitation,\u201d she said, her voice soft and husky from sleep.</p><p>\u201cI do what I can,\u201d he replied as he neared her door.</p><p>\u201cThe flowers are beautiful, and this chocolate is the best I\u2019ve ever had,\u201d she mumbled around the sweet concoction in her mouth. As Crew pictured filling her mouth with much more than chocolate, his groin tightened. Man, he wanted her sweet, full lips around his shaft \u2013 hell, all over his body, but especially his shaft!</p><p>\u201cAre you going to invite me in?\u201d he practically whispered. To himself, he said: Down, boy!</p><p>\u201cWell...you did have breakfast for two sent up. I hate to see such a good meal wasted...\u201d</p><p>\u201cInvite me in, Haley. This is Lesson Three,\u201d he said, his voice purposely low and seductive. Satisfaction filled him at the hitch in her voice.</p><p>\u201cI need time to get dressed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen our breakfast will get cold. You look fine, I\u2019m sure,\u201d he said with a hint of impatience. He really wanted to know what she slept in. Was it nothing at all? The sudden thought had his blood racing.</p><p>\u201cFine. Come on up,\u201d she conceded.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m already here. Open the door.\u201d Crew hung up and waited. He had the master key in his pocket, but he wouldn\u2019t use it. She needed to have the confidence in herself to let him through her door.</p><p>The door opened just a crack and Crew first saw big green eyes peering out at him. He said nothing, just raised his eyebrows as he waited for her to open the door all the way.</p><p>He wanted to push his way through, take her in his arms, and taste the chocolate on her tongue, but he was supposed to be teaching her. This wasn\u2019t about his own needs, though he promised himself they would get met.</p><p>By the time he was finished with Haley Sutherland, she\u2019d never think again about this other man she\u2019d been so desperate to capture. Of course, it wasn\u2019t as if Crew wanted to find himself captured either. He just needed a few nips of her perfect skin, a few cries of passion from her slender throat, and a few whimpers and gasps for air as she fell apart in his arms.</p><p>\u201cAre you going to let me in, Haley, or just stand behind the door gaping at me?\u201d he asked with a smile.</p><p>She narrowed her eyes, then rolled them as she gave him enough room to step through. Crew waited patiently for the door to shut firmly behind him before he made eye contact.</p><p>He was grateful for his decision, because when he turned and saw her, his jaw nearly dropped. She was wearing nothing but a pair of men\u2019s flannel boxers and a tight tank top, displaying exactly what she\u2019d been hiding beneath those baggy clothes.</p><p>To make matters worse, the white cotton tank was just the slightest bit too thin, showing him the shadow of her dark nipples beneath the soft fabric. His throat went dry and he took an involuntary step toward her.</p><p>As if she knew exactly what he was thinking, she turned quickly and raced toward the bathroom, calling out that she\u2019d be right out. Damn! She was most likely covering up all that beautiful skin. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Lesson Four was coming real quick, because if she wanted to seduce a man, she was certainly more than qualified to do it.</p><p>Crew sat at the table, pouring himself a cup of hot coffee and releasing a deep breath while he sat back in his chair and waited. It didn\u2019t take her long, but when she returned, he found that he\u2019d predicted correctly: she was wearing too many clothes.</p><p>\u201cYou should have stayed in your pajamas,\u201d he said, disappointed by the oversized knit shirt she\u2019d thrown on. At least her slender legs were still on display.</p><p>\u201cI was cold,\u201d she lied.</p> <p>\u201cNo you weren\u2019t, Haley. That shirt hid nothing, and if you had been cold, I would have known about it,\u201d he smirked.</p><p>Her cheeks flamed; she picked up a croissant and began nibbling on its corner in hopes of hiding her embarrassment.</p><p>\u201cThank you for the lilies \u2014 they\u2019re my favorite, but you really don\u2019t need to do that. I asked you to teach me how to be the one to seduce a man. There\u2019s absolutely no need for you to try to seduce me,\u201d she said crisply as she poured tea into a cup and added a little lemon and sugar.</p><p>Crew waited until he had her full attention before he spoke, making sure to capture her eyes with his gaze. He wanted her to have no doubt where this was going.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t do anything by half measures, Haley. I agreed to your ridiculous request, but I\u2019m going to be the one in charge here. If you are to become anything like the kind of woman you\u2019re asking me to make you, then we do it my way \u2014 without any complaints. Today\u2019s lesson: you must realize your own appeal. A woman who feels sexy is sexy. You don\u2019t have to be a model \u2014 you can be too thin or too large \u2014 and you don\u2019t have to be the perfect height or have the perfect curves. You just have to know how to use what you\u2019ve got, and display it in the best possible light.\u201d</p> <p>Haley looked down as if making a catalog of her best points. Then she shook her head and frowned.</p><p>\u201cWhat are my assets, then?\u201d</p><p>That she honestly didn\u2019t know made Crew\u2019s breath catch in his throat. Man, was he turned on. He didn\u2019t know if he\u2019d make it through this \u201clesson.\u201d Her innocence was...exciting.</p><p>Instead of answering her, Crew stood up from the table. He\u2019d lost all his appetite...for food, that was. She tensed as he circled around her and kneeled behind her low-back chair. But, to her credit, she didn\u2019t pull away when he rested his hands on her shoulders.</p><p>\u201cFirst off, your hair. It\u2019s stunning. The color is golden, and the strands are long and soft.\u201d As he spoke, his fingers glided through her hair. Even after a night\u2019s sleep, it was sleek and smooth to the touch.</p><p>\u201cThen there are your eyes \u2014 the soft green shines with vibrancy and life when you aren\u2019t looking down. Fire flashes in them when you\u2019re determined or irritated. Passion pours out of them when you\u2019re turned on.\u201d His hand moved to her cheekbones as he spoke, his body pressing against the back of the chair. He didn\u2019t want her to look at him, just feel his hands caressing her, and let his words cascade through her so she could focus wholly on herself.</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t forget your neck; its taut, creamy skin with your pulse beating just below the surface can drive a man wild,\u201d he whispered in her ear as he leaned forward and circled his hands around her throat, his fingers gentle as he caressed her.</p><p>Her pulse was speeding up, making his own race. He moved to the side of the chair so he could stroke her cheek and run his lips across her smooth skin. Her responses to him were fueling his desire, but he refused to let himself get out of control. This was about teaching her to embrace her sexuality, not about seducing her, even if it killed him.</p><p>\u201cThen, of course, we start to reach the perfection of your breasts. When you don\u2019t hide them, they can drop a man to his knees. They\u2019re firm and high and just the right fit for a man\u2019s large hands,\u201d he groaned as his hands moved downward and grazed over the outside of her shirt, shaping her luscious curves with his palms.</p><p>Her nipples hardened beneath his touch; her body went limp in the chair and her head fell backward. Crew knew he could lift her in his arms and take her to the bed \u2014 make her his right now. With a will he didn\u2019t know he had, he forced himself to continue his demonstration.</p><p>\u201cYour hips are curved and perfect, making a man want to grip them tightly in his hands while he pulls you against his body and fits himself right at the edge of glory. I could take you right now and feel a deep, satisfying pleasure from my head to my toes,\u201d he said as he rubbed his hands down her hips before coming around the front of her chair.</p><p>He knelt before her, then took her hips again and pulled her forward, her legs spreading around his thighs, aligning her heat perfectly with his excruciatingly hard manhood.</p><p>Gripping her backside, he squeezed her firm, yet soft tush as her eyes opened the tiniest fraction of an inch and she looked at him with fire leaping from those beautiful green depths of hers.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t continue telling you about the most appealing pieces of you, because if I do, this lesson will end with me taking you hard and fast, and we\u2019re not there yet, Haley. But, I want you to go into the bathroom, strip naked and run your hands over your body. I want you to close your eyes as you touch yourself, feel what I\u2019m feeling. I want you to feel what makes you so sexy \u2014 feel what will make a man crawl over hot coals to touch.\u201d</p> <p>Crew pulled her against him for just one moment \u2014 just a brief second, it seemed \u2014 to try to alleviate the pain throbbing in his groin. Then he moved her back and lifted her hands, placing them both on her chest, causing her eyes to snap open, arousal clouding her vision.</p><p>\u201cGo do it, Haley. Go complete your lesson,\u201d he groaned as she automatically flexed her fingers, making the muscle in his jaw jump from the amount of restraint he was exerting over himself.</p><p>In a daze, Haley stood up, her legs shaky. Without a word, she turned and went toward the bathroom. He didn\u2019t know whether she\u2019d do what he asked or not right at this moment, but he knew it would sink in and she\u2019d eventually follow through.</p><p>He sat back down, seriously thinking about grabbing a glass of the ice water on the table and dumping it down his ridiculously tight trousers. When he heard a soft groan from the bathroom as the shower started, he nearly lost it.</p><p>This lesson was over. Crew stood up and grabbed a sweatshirt he saw hanging over a chair. Draping it across his arm, he hid the enormous erection he was sporting and practically sprinted from her room.</p><p>Only one employee tried to speak to him as he made a beeline to his suite. He ignored the woman and dashed into his room. He locked his door behind him and barely paused before heading straight to the shower, scattering his clothes along the way. This adventure with Haley wasn\u2019t going to be good for his body \u2014 not one little bit.</p><p>Chapter Eleven</p><p>For the next five days, Crew tested the very limits of what he could handle. He didn\u2019t know whether he was a glutton for punishment or if he was determined to walk around with certain body parts south of the equator forever swollen. Haley was an eager learner, which made everything, er...harder. If she had been impatient or snooty, this would have been so much easier on him.</p><p>He could write her off \u2014 say he\u2019d tried and then get her out of his head. But the light of excitement shining in her eyes each time he showed her something new was intoxicating for him. The moment was approaching when he would take her to the furthest reaches she could imagine.</p><p>That was a lesson that must be taught \u2014 personally. Though she wouldn\u2019t admit to him how many sexual partners she\u2019d been with, he knew it couldn\u2019t be many. She was too shy, too unaware of her own body to have slept with more than a few men. Heck, he wouldn\u2019t be surprised if she\u2019d been with only one or two.</p><p>Well, by the time he was done teaching her, she\u2019d be a regular siren in bed. Unfortunately, the thought of her using these skills, the skills he\u2019d taught her, with another man sparked a nasty little twinge in his gut. But he wasn\u2019t going to dwell on that now</p><p>As he walked toward her door, he was determined to keep his hands to himself. The touching had been a part of teaching her to appreciate herself, but that wasn\u2019t on the syllabus for today. Today was Lesson Ten \u2014 or was it Twelve? \u2014 he couldn\u2019t remember. Anyway, they were going shopping. The loose clothing had to go. She was a stunner, and she needed to show that off.</p><p>He\u2019d have her fitted for a body-hugging gown, pick out a few outfits, and then take her out for a romantic dinner and dancing. Every man in the room would be jealous and every woman would want to be Haley Sutherland. If she didn\u2019t feel alive at the end of the day, he\u2019d be earning a failing grade.</p><p>Bright-eyed and smiling, he almost bounced from his office, and was immediately stopped by his head manager, who was able to suppress his surprise at the boss\u2019s bizarre cheeriness and was not to be deflected from a discussion of some documents. Typical. But business always came before pleasure, or it should.</p><p>Looking out at the ocean waves crashing against the shores of the island had Haley excited to get away from the resort for a while. She\u2019d heavily pursued Crew and been persistent in persuading him to be her teacher, but she felt as if she couldn\u2019t breathe while in his presence. The man was so overwhelming \u2014 and what was worse, she wanted his touch, wanted more of him.</p><p>She enjoyed when he touched her \u2013 wanted more of it. She was trying to remember that she\u2019d hired him \u2014 was it still hiring him if he wouldn\u2019t accept pay? \u2014 oh, well, that didn\u2019t matter. It was just a technicality.</p><p>The point was that she had hired him so she could catch her man, not so she could be caught by her teacher. But she had to remind herself of that every minute she spent with him. And that was a lot of minutes.</p><p>How did he manage to run his resort so successfully when he was constantly at her side? He had gathered an amazingly efficient staff, and he did work hard in the morning. And he kept checking in with his employees when they were in and out of the resort during the rest of the business day.</p><p>It was the nights that were the hardest. When he held out a chair for her and gently pushed her in, his fingers skimmed over her neck and her skin tingled for long minutes afterward. When the palm of his hand rested on the small of her back or when he whispered evocative words in her ear, oh, her resistance was low. She\u2019d never intended to sleep with him, but her will was breaking.</p><p>What would it be like to have a man\u2019s hands caress her body, to have his mouth travel down the side of her neck and then capture her swollen nipple, wetting it with his tongue? It seemed that was all she thought about lately.</p><p>Before, when she pictured a man lying with her, the images hadn\u2019t been nearly as vivid and the face hadn\u2019t belonged to Crew Storm. For that matter, the man had always been faceless. She\u2019d never really thought about that fact. It certainly hadn\u2019t been the face of Walker, the man she\u2019d believed she wanted so very badly.</p><p>Scratch that. She did want him, she did! This was just a matter of her spending too much time with Crew. Of course the man was going to get inside her head. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Crew was dangerously masculine \u2014 sinfully, in fact. He was everything she should avoid, but he was her teacher, so how could she stay away? She smiled at the thought. It wasn\u2019t her fault if she was just following through on her plan, right? If something did happen between the two of them, it was just Crew teaching her, wasn\u2019t it?</p><p>If only she didn\u2019t have the voice of her grandparents still in her head, making her feel so guilty about her thoughts. She was planning on having sex, so what did it matter if it was with her teacher or the man she intended to pursue? Nothing seemed to make sense anymore.</p><p>Well, she wouldn\u2019t be a fool. She wouldn\u2019t do something rash like fall for him. She was just suffering from a minor case of lust; that was all. It was perfectly normal \u2014 nothing to get too worked up about.</p><p>Her spirits reviving, Haley turned from the magnificent ocean view off her balcony and headed into the bathroom, shedding the robe that had been a gift from Crew. The soft pink silk slid over her skin, making her feel feminine and sexy.</p> <p>It was silly, really, how just a piece of material \u2014 even expensive material \u2014 could change how you felt about yourself. When she tied the soft sash around her waist and looked in the mirror, she felt...sensual.</p><p>It didn\u2019t take her long to shower and then to pad naked out to her bedroom, where she pulled open the closet doors and looked inside with disgust. Never before had she given much thought to what she wore, but as she looked at her bland clothing, all in shades of beige, white and dull pastels, she wished for something different.</p><p>After wearing the ultrafeminine nightie and robe, she wanted something nice for the daytime, too. Staring hopelessly into her closet, she knew she couldn\u2019t wave a magic wand and suddenly change what was in there, so she needed just to close her eyes and take the first thing she touched.</p><p>But a sudden inspiration hit her. Crew had made her appreciate her legs as he\u2019d run his hands up them, commenting on what nice muscle tone she had. So Haley grabbed one of her long skirts and a pair of scissors, along with the small sewing kit in the bathroom. Slipping her robe back on, she laid the skirt out on the bed and began to rip out stitches to make a long slit up one side, to stop at the top of her thigh. With a wide grin, she took the skirt to the ironing board provided in her suite.</p><p>She was quick to secure the hems with an invisible stitch, and when she slipped into the skirt and took a step, she felt daring and bold. If a strong wind blew, her legs would be on display. For the very first time, she felt the desire to wear something so sexy. Turning to look in the mirror, she wiggled her hips, feeling slightly attractive even with her all-too-white thighs so blatantly revealed. At least she\u2019d just shaved, she thought, as she made her leg shimmy, loving the effect from the impromptu slit in the soft material.</p> <p>Her next dilemma was a shirt. Only her sleep shirts were even sort of fitted, so she\u2019d have to get creative again.</p><p>She took one of her button-up blouses and cut off the sleeves, being careful not to make it looked hacked apart, and she rolled the cut edges and threw in another quick hem job. Then, putting the blouse on, she left the bottom five buttons undone and pulled the corners forward, tying a loose knot so the shirt rested just above the waistline of her skirt. About an inch of skin showed when she moved. Better and better.</p><p>So why not be even more daring? Haley unbuttoned the top three buttons, then looked in the mirror, blushing slightly at what she saw. If Crew wasn\u2019t knocked for a loop, she\u2019d be crushed. The way the skirt rode low on her hips and the blouse was tied at her waist made her look as if she had an hourglass figure.</p><p>\u201cNot too bad,\u201d she murmured as she turned to go back into the bathroom and tie her hair up into a somewhat sexy bun with a small braid running through it, and wisps of hair flying around her face. Yes, Crew had told her that he loved the way her hair cascaded halfway down her back, but it was a warm day and she didn\u2019t want to be uncomfortable. She did wear it down in the evenings, though it drove her a little bit mad when it kept falling in her face.</p><p>Deciding she was as ready for the day as she\u2019d ever be, she glanced at the clock; the little hand on the eleven surprised her. She gathered up money, sliding it into her small handbag, then grabbed her sunglasses and made it to the door.</p><p>It didn\u2019t take her long to reach the lobby, and she thought she might actually make her escape when Crew\u2019s rich baritone voice caught her at the door. She\u2019d planned on seeing him after her shopping, hopefully getting a bit of color in her cheeks, and time to think about how far she was willing to go with him in his lessons.</p> <p>But it looked as if sneaking away from him in his own resort was easier said than done.</p><p>\u201cWe may not need to have shopping lessons, after all.\u201d</p><p>Hesitating for only a moment before she turned with a false smile, Haley replied without thinking: \u201cI\u2019m on my way out now to look for clothes.\u201d She shouldn\u2019t have told him her plans</p><p>\u201cGood. I\u2019m ready to leave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t inviting you this time. Last I knew, men despised shopping,\u201d she said with an air of indifference, trying to suggest that she wasn\u2019t bothered whether he came along or not. She didn\u2019t want him to know how much he was getting under her skin.</p><p>She needed him for a while longer \u2014 she knew that \u2014 so she couldn\u2019t let on that she was actually attracted to him. Men like Crew Storm liked to reel women in, and then cast them back out to sea as soon as they made their catch.</p><p>As long as he thought he was still on the hunt, he\u2019d continue helping her. Once he knew how infatuated she was becoming, how easily she was taking the bait, he\u2019d head for the hills in horror.</p><p>Propping her hand on her hip, she took a casual stand. Resist! Resist! she told herself.</p> <p>\u201cI love to shop. And that happens to be our lesson plan today,\u201d he said as he grabbed her arm and then entwined their fingers. Dang it!</p><p>\u201cSorry, Crew, but today\u2019s mission is solo. I\u2019ll catch up with you later tonight. You can teach me how to make eyes at cute guys.\u201d She laughed as she tried to pull her hand from his.</p><p>\u201cTough. I want to be with you this afternoon. Besides, I know what men like to see on a woman, and isn\u2019t that why you \u2018hired\u2019 me \u2014 to teach you how to be a sex goddess?\u201d</p><p>He had her there.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t even realized it, but while he\u2019d been cajoling her, he\u2019d also been moving her outside, and soon he was holding open the passenger door of his car.</p><p>\u201cWhere do you plan on taking me?\u201d she asked, submitting to the inevitable. Her day to herself was over.</p><p>\u201cShopping, of course,\u201d he replied. \u201cI said that before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s hardly an answer, but fine. If you insist on taking me, then you\u2019re buying.\u201d She figured that would make him reconsider.</p><p>Wrong.</p><p>He grinned as he helped her get in. \u201cIt will be my pleasure,\u201d he said with a bow before jogging to the other side of the car and getting in.</p><p>When they arrived at the airstrip a few minutes later, she turned with suspicion. He said nothing as he jumped from the car, then came around to her side. It wasn\u2019t until they were heading toward the helicopter that she realized he planned to take her up in the air in that death trap.</p><p>\u201cNo way!\u201d she yelled and began to back away.</p><p>\u201cOh, you really need to live a little,\u201d he said, chuckling as he lifted her into his arms and carried her the rest of the way, unceremoniously plopping her into the seat.</p><p>Before Haley could protest any further, he had her strapped in, and soon the miserable, claustrophobic contraption was lifting off into the air. She just closed her eyes and prayed they wouldn\u2019t end up as food for the Pacific Ocean fishes.</p><p>Chapter Twelve</p><p>Haley\u2019s arrival at Santa Catalina Island had been by ferry \u2014 a nice, safe way to travel across an ocean, she insisted to herself. And she had endured the thirty-seven-hour train trip from Seattle to Long Beach, not tempted by any airlines that promised to get her from Point A to Point B in less than three hours. She had vowed never, ever to fly in a helicopter, never wanting to have that feeling of not being in control. On the ground, if you fell, you didn\u2019t have far to go, but way up in the sky... Splat!</p><p>She wasn\u2019t as terrified of huge airliners as she was by tiny helicopters, which had a far higher fail rate than jets, but still, she would only fly if it were a life and death matter. Going shopping on the mainland was certainly not an emergency. It could, however, end up being a death matter if the pilot screwed up in even the smallest way.</p><p>A shudder raced through her as she listened to the rotors spin. Luckily, the ride didn\u2019t take long. She didn\u2019t care what Crew would attempt to say \u2014 she wouldn\u2019t even listen. There was no way she was going back to that island unless it was by boat.</p><p>She glared at him as he assisted her from the chopper. But because her top priority was to leave those lethal wing blades far behind her, she decided to wait before letting him have it. She wanted no chance that he might force her back into that mean machine if she made him so angry, he decided to call the whole day off.</p><p>\u201cIf you ever, ever, ever even attempt to put me back in that thing, I will lose all vestiges of civilization and subject you to a quick but agonizing death,\u201d she told him, wishing her voice had more thunder and less quiver.</p><p>When Crew stopped and looked at her, really looked, she watched his face fall, and all her outrage melted away. Dang the man for actually caring.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry, Haley. I thought you just had a normal fear of flying, like most people. We\u2019ll return by ferry.\u201d His sincere apology soothed her, and what was better, she wouldn\u2019t have to go back up into the sky!</p><p>Haley tried telling herself that her fears were irrational, but she just couldn\u2019t let go. Even knowing that the chance of her plummeting to her death in a spiraling, smoking helicopter was almost nonexistent, it would still be her luck to be that one-in-a-whatever number.</p><p>\u201cOK. Where are we?\u201d She finally realized that they must have returned to the mainland, but she had no idea what city they were in.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re in Long Beach. There are some great boutiques on the island, but I want to take you to some better stores to find a few knockout outfits, and most especially a killer dress,\u201d he said.</p><p>Haley was worried. She\u2019d been acting like a brat when she told him he\u2019d have to pay, but she knew the prices in some of the stores in this area, and she didn\u2019t want to end up blowing ten grand on some glad rags. She\u2019d feel much better just heading to a mall and finding a Macy\u2019s. They had great clothes and wouldn\u2019t cost her a fortune.</p><p>No matter what she\u2019d said on the island, she wasn\u2019t making him pay for her clothing.</p><p>As he took her hand, leading her to another car, a nice Mercedes GL with a driver holding the back door open, she felt a knot in her stomach. She wouldn\u2019t fight with him again unless there was a reason to.</p><p>An hour later there was definitely a reason!</p><p>\u201cAre you kidding me?! There is no way we are shopping on Rodeo Drive. I may not be the most worldly of people, but I\u2019ve watched enough movies to know that I can\u2019t afford to look at even the panties in any of these shops!\u201d Haley thundered. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Crew figured he might want to let the panty comment go. Haley was fit to be tied. Anyway, he found the fire flashing from her eyes rather amusing. He also wanted to get her the perfect dress, and there was no better place than the beautiful and celebrated Rodeo Drive.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not paying, remember? That was the deal,\u201d he reminded her.</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t serious, Crew. I demand that you call the driver back right this minute. I don\u2019t think people like me are even allowed to walk in front of these stores,\u201d she hissed while tapping her foot. \u201cEven though I\u2019m not a hooker with a heart of gold.\u201d</p><p>Damn, the woman was hot when she was fired up. He could press her against one of the pristine storefront windows right now and take her \u2014 well, he could if he were an exhibitionist. And wanted to have his mug shot plastered all over the Smoking Gun website.</p> <p>The day was warm and her cheeks were flushed, and with her hair slightly mussed, she looked as if she\u2019d just crawled from one hell of a lucky man\u2019s bed.</p><p>Ignoring her Pretty Woman comment, he tried to reason with her. \u201cLook, Haley, I\u2019m on a mission. You can come easy or hard, but this is going to happen. I don\u2019t change my mind once it\u2019s made up, so what will it be?\u201d</p><p>He waited while she seethed. She had no real choice \u2014 he\u2019d kidnapped her for the afternoon. He\u2019d just see whether she got over it or threw a tantrum. It was as much a test of her temperament as a mission for the perfect dress, and some indecent lingerie if he could sneak it in.</p><p>Finally, she blew out her breath, sent him one final glare, and then uncrossed her arms. It looked as if the battle was over.</p><p>\u201cFine. I\u2019ll go, but I insist on paying.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019m not doing it.\u201d He looked into her eyes to try and intimidate her into backing down, but it wasn\u2019t happening. He liked her spunk. However, if she insisted on buying her clothes, he couldn\u2019t take her where he\u2019d originally wanted to. He wasn\u2019t about to let her stubborn pride break her bank account.</p><p>Yes, she\u2019d offered him money to be her teacher, but he\u2019d done a thorough background check on her. She wasn\u2019t poor, but she was living off an inheritance from her grandparents and what little money she made at her part-time job while attending school. Since she\u2019d chosen to come on this trip she\u2019d won, she most likely didn\u2019t even have the part-time employment any longer. And when this ended, she\u2019d need to make her inheritance last until she was finished with her schooling and could get a decent job.</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d Crew gripped her hand and began strolling down the street with her. Then inspiration hit. His sister\u2019s best friend worked in one of the better dress shops. He\u2019d pull her aside and make sure that she gave Haley a believable amount to pay while charging the rest to him. It was win-win for both of them.</p><p>Haley didn\u2019t look convinced, but she went ahead and allowed him to lead her down the street. With both of them dressed casually, a few people turned up their noses, but he noticed Haley relax when she saw others strolling the beautiful street in similar apparel.</p><p>\u201cNot everyone with money is a snob, Haley. That is something you must learn,\u201d he said as they approached the store. He needed to discover why she had such a problem with affluent people, why she had such money issues. From the information he\u2019d been able to gleam from her, he knew she\u2019d grown up in a fairly wealthy home. She wasn\u2019t poor, by any means. Then again, if she wasn\u2019t smart, she could be within a couple years.</p> <p>As they walked inside, he felt Haley\u2019s muscles tense. Then, when Celia popped out and noticed him, her face lit up and she rushed over.</p><p>\u201cCrew Storm! What are you doing here?\u201d she squealed as she threw her arms around his neck and gave him a smacking kiss on the lips.</p><p>\u201cCareful, Celia. You\u2019ll ruin your reputation,\u201d he said fondly as he returned her hug.</p><p>\u201cI know. I know,\u201d she said with a roll of her eyes, before her attention turned toward Haley.</p><p>\u201cThis is my friend, Haley. We\u2019re looking for a few outfits and the perfect evening dress. Not something too over-the-top, but a dress that will make her feel like a million bucks,\u201d he said.</p><p>Celia\u2019s eyes gleamed. \u201cI\u2019d be glad to help you lighten that wallet a bit, Crew.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be paying,\u201d Haley spoke sternly, then realized how rude she was being. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m just a bit nervous. It\u2019s nice to meet you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAny friend of Crew\u2019s is a friend of mine. I\u2019ve known him since I was five years old. His sister, Brielle, and I are best friends. I only moved out to California four years ago. Same old sad story of wanting to make it big in Hollywood. Of course, it\u2019s never happened.\u201d She sighed dramatically, reminding Crew of what an excellent actress she was. \u201cInstead, I\u2019m stuck working in retail, but things could be worse. At least there\u2019s a large collection of half-naked men I get to ogle on a daily basis.\u201d</p> <p>At those words, he felt Haley relax. He knew being around Celia would do the trick. She was a sweet girl, always had been. She needed to focus more, that was all. At one point, he\u2019d been sure she and Tanner would end up together, but it had just never happened.</p><p>The next hour was a blur as Celia grabbed a variety of outfits, making Haley try each one on, then shaking her head every time. He had to agree. Sure, she looked nice in all of them, but none of them called to him yet. He wanted something that would pop. Though he didn\u2019t know exactly what he was looking for, once it was found, he\u2019d just know.</p><p>He was looking down, reading the New York Times, when Celia cleared her throat. Haley stood before him with three-inch heels and a shimmering teal gown. The top hugged her tight, with thin straps holding it in place, and accented her scrumptious breasts. The dress molded to her body until just below her hips, where it flared slightly, then stopped four inches above her knees.</p><p>\u201cPerfect,\u201d he said out loud, his tongue nearly hanging from his mouth.</p><p>At his words, Haley grinned while doing a full spin and he got his first mouthwatering glance at her bare and exquisitely toned back. No fabric blocked his view, and as his eyes dipped lower, he itched to run his fingers over the top of the material, which rested just above the curve of her perfectly rounded backside.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll take it!\u201d There was no question. This was the dress.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I thought as soon as I saw her in it,\u201d Celia sighed dreamily. \u201cThe shoes are perfect, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t agree more. Now, where do we go for lingerie, Celia?\u201d Crew asked.</p><p>Haley flushed as she turned to him in surprise. His own question was taking him by surprise, too. The thought of her in a garter belt and stockings with nothing else on but those heels had him shifting in his seat. Oh yes, they were lingerie shopping. He would certainly work in a lesson that involved her modeling the sheer lace and garters for him. Before too much longer, he would be taking this game to a whole new level.</p><p>\u201cYou must go to Agent Provocateur. No woman can wear any of their pieces without feeling like an absolute sex goddess,\u201d Celia insisted as she led Haley to the back.</p><p>When it came time to pay, he slipped Celia his credit card, feeling a tad guilty about the deception, but if Haley had known the true cost of the dress, she\u2019d have had a minor stroke. Never had he thought about money before the day his father had told him that his inheritance and trust fund were being taken away. He\u2019d always just had plenty of it. Life as a billionaire\u2019s kid...</p><p>That first year of being on his own, however, had taught him a lot. He no longer took wealth for granted, and he now knew how important it could be for someone who didn\u2019t have much. But there were some items that were worth splurging on. The perfect dress was one of them.</p><p>Surprisingly, Haley didn\u2019t fight him on the panties. She was entranced from the moment they entered Agent Provocateur. The only problem he had was her refusal to allow him to give her his opinion.</p><p>In this store, he wasn\u2019t able to slip in his credit card. Haley wouldn\u2019t even let him know the amount. He knew it wouldn\u2019t be cheap, but he\u2019d figure out a way to make it right with her, soften the financial blow.</p><p>They passed the next couple of hours purchasing a few more outfits, now at less expensive boutiques, and enjoying the beautiful California sunshine. When dusk arrived, Crew led Haley back to Long Beach, where this time they boarded a private boat for the twenty-two-mile ride to the island.</p><p>\u201cYou are both in luck tonight. The dolphins have been entertaining the guests.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOoh, I love dolphins. I have been meaning to take one of the tours offered on the island, but haven\u2019t had a chance yet. I must do it before I have to leave. I can\u2019t believe I have only a little over a week left,\u201d Haley said with a frown.</p><p>Crew\u2019s gut clenched at her words. He\u2019d known her for less than a week and already he was growing attached in a strange way. She was just so full of life, so full of happiness. Her enthusiasm for everything around her was contagious.</p><p>Halfway to the island, they saw the dolphins dancing on the water next to the boat, showing off for Crew and Haley as the captain slowed so they could enjoy the show a little longer.</p><p>The sun was just starting to set and Crew couldn\u2019t fight the urge to slip his arm around Haley\u2019s shoulders and pull her tightly against his side. And when she looked up, he couldn\u2019t resist bending down and capturing her lips for just the briefest of moments.</p><p>As she sighed into his mouth, he felt his wavering control snap. They would make fireworks ignite when they finally came together \u2014 it couldn\u2019t be soon enough.</p><p>Chapter Thirteen</p><p>As she walked from the elevator, Haley felt a twinge of her old insecurities. Here she was in a stunning gown with her hair piled atop her head and with her newly acquired makeup lightly applied. She\u2019d even spritzed herself with the subtly scented bottle of perfume she\u2019d found in the bathroom with a ribbon tied on top. This was what she wanted. She wanted to turn heads. She wanted to feel gorgeous.</p><p>So why was everything inside of her telling her to turn around and run back to her room? She wanted to hide away and slip back into a baggy T-shirt and frayed shorts.</p><p>But refusing to let her fears dictate her actions, Haley moved purposefully through the lobby toward the softly lit bar where Marlin was working. Crew had only instructed her to meet him at ten at the bar; all she knew was that he was taking her to a nice dinner. If only she could feel a little less afraid, a little more excited.</p><p>\u201cWowee! You look hot!\u201d Haley looked up to find Marlin giving her an exaggerated wink. \u201cBeautiful ladies get the first-class bar stool,\u201d he finished as he came around the bar and pulled out the seat for her.</p><p>\u201cWhy, thank you, kind sir,\u201d she replied demurely. She sat as gracefully as she could, but getting comfortable took her a few moments, what with adjusting her dress and positioning her heels just right on the rungs of the stool.</p><p>\u201cWould you like a surprise or would a woman of your high class like a glass of champagne?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou may surprise me. And you can quit that flattery any time, Marlin. You\u2019re making me blush,\u201d she whispered as she looked over her shoulder. The bar was crowded, but luckily the crowd was near the new piano player and the large gas fireplace on the other side of the room, and no one was paying the two of them the least bit of attention. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHey, a dress that hot, covering a body that\u2019s even hotter, deserves some of my special attention.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to tell your wife,\u201d she said. \u201cIn fact, she\u2019s right over there.\u201d</p><p>Marlin looked around in terror, causing Haley\u2019s nerves to fade away into laughter. She was glad Crew wasn\u2019t there yet \u2014 it gave her a few necessary moments to relax.</p><p>\u201cI was just having some fun. That was downright cruel,\u201d he pouted as he began mixing her a drink.</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t mess with a woman in heels, Marlin. You\u2019ll lose every time,\u201d she said, still laughing.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t I know it,\u201d he sighed as he placed a martini in front of her. She raised her eyebrows at the choice, but picked up the amusingly retro silver-plated cocktail stick and started moving it and its olives around in the glass. \u201cI figure you\u2019re dressed classy, so you need a classy drink,\u201d he offered.</p><p>\u201cI see. So when I\u2019m in my cutoffs, I get the Bottom-Feeder Special?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d never think of doing that to you, missy. Do you want me to slip you some brazini with fennel puree? It\u2019s delicious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would love some, but I\u2019m meeting Crew here and he\u2019s taking me out to dinner.\u201d She was thinking the brazini sounded much better, though.</p> <p>\u201cThat explains the new dress. I knew the boss man would get his claws into you. He has an eye for the pretty ladies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not like that. He\u2019s helping me out \u2014 and though he\u2019s a pain in the butt, I have to admit that he\u2019s doing a pretty good job so far,\u201d she admitted.</p><p>\u201cMmm, that\u2019s what I like to hear. You smell divine.\u201d Haley tensed all over again as Crew\u2019s mouth descended on her neck and he took a gentle bite from her skin. She instantly felt goose bumps and found herself fighting the urge to lean into the firmness of his chest when he pressed his body against her back.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not supposed to eavesdrop,\u201d she said when she found her voice again.</p><p>\u201cHaven\u2019t you heard that it\u2019s not nice to talk about people behind their backs?\u201d he countered.</p><p>\u201cWe were just discussing my upcoming mystery date,\u201d she defended.</p> <p>\u201cSpeaking of which, everything is ready. I\u2019m sorry to keep you waiting. My sister was on the phone and no matter how many times I tried, I couldn\u2019t get her off the line. Melodrama is Brielle\u2019s middle name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs she OK?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, she\u2019s fine. It\u2019s just family theater, and Brielle has bitten off a bit more than she can chew. It\u2019s actually kind of enjoyable. She\u2019s always been the baby and quite spoiled. I am going to have to visit her soon, just to see how her ranch is working out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you say ranch?\u201d Haley asked.</p><p>\u201cI did indeed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOK. You are definitely going to have to give me more details. I want to know how a wealthy member of the Storm family ends up working right in the dirt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know I\u2019m wealthy?\u201d he asked with a smirk. Haley rolled her eyes.</p><p>\u201cWell, let\u2019s see, maybe it\u2019s all the magazine articles, or the charities your family donates to. It might possibly be the over-the-top resort that you run. Nah, it\u2019s the Rolex.\u201d She laughed as she placed her arm through his so he could lead her away. \u201cNight, Marlin,\u201d she called back before they made their exit.</p> <p>To Haley\u2019s surprise, Crew started leading her not out the resort\u2019s front doors but toward the back. Yet she made no comment as the two of them walked side by side toward the ornate patio doors behind an elegant sitting area. A violinist was playing for a small crowd of people sipping wine and eating a variety of cheeses and fruits. This place was amazing.</p><p>They stepped through the doors onto the candlelit patio, an area she hadn\u2019t seen before. Large fire pits were strategically placed with lounge chairs surrounding them, and plants and trees were positioned to offer privacy for each grouping. Hearing light laughter and happy voices in the different nooks, Haley started imagining passionate embraces, drugging kisses, and racing hearts.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so happy to be dining here, Crew,\u201d she said quietly. \u201cYou\u2019ve done well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you think so.\u201d His eyes captured hers in an intense gaze, and her heart nearly stalled as she continued walking beside him. Being fully aware that she was getting too caught up in the moment didn\u2019t help her heart flutter any less. This wasn\u2019t going according to plan, but she was having a hard time caring.</p><p>When the path ended, she gasped at the sight of a rich red carpet laid out upon the sand. As she looked up at him, her vision seemed to fog momentarily. What lesson could he be trying to teach her now?</p><p>Without giving her a moment to breathe, he led her down the carpet to a golden cabana only about ten yards from the gently lapping water of the warm Pacific Ocean. Beneath the structure was a table for two. The only illumination inside was a string of twinkling lights overhead, casting a soft, intimate glow.</p><p>She sighed as he showed her to one of the chairs, which easily slid out from the table on the hard, clear floor of the cabana. The glass was almost like a window on the beach floor, giving the feeling of sitting directly on the sand without sinking into it.</p><p>After pushing her chair in and dropping a light kiss on the back of her neck, he sat across from her, and within seconds a waiter appeared and opened a bottle of wine, presenting it to Crew for his approval.</p><p>\u201cI hope you don\u2019t mind, Haley, but I\u2019ve ordered our dinner. Would you care for a glass of Pouilly-Fuiss\u00e9? It will taste like nothing you\u2019ve tried before.\u201d</p><p>Haley nodded with wide, curious eyes, taking the long-stemmed glass and sampling the crisp white liquid, smelling tantalizingly of fruit and oak. The explosion of flavors in her mouth was divine. The only wine she\u2019d drunk before came out of a cheap supercenter store bottle. She couldn\u2019t drink that stuff again \u2014 not after this.</p><p>The waiter set down a dish, and left them. Crew dipped a silver spoon in the small bowl, and slipped something onto a buttered toast point, then lifted it to her lips. Without even thinking of saying no, she took a bite, then wrinkled her nose at the salty flavor.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like that,\u201d she said, quickly swallowing it down, and then taking a large gulp of her wine. Crew laughed as he took a big bite of his own portion and hummed in pleasure.</p><p>\u201cNot everyone cares for caviar, even Golden Osetra,\u201d he said with a smile. \u201cPeople always say that it\u2019s an acquired taste.\u201d</p><p>Not one I\u2019d like to acquire, Haley muttered to herself and hoped the meal improved from this point on. Things did look up when the waiter set down their next course, asparagus salad with brilliant roasted red peppers.</p><p>\u201cWhat is the lesson in all of this, Crew? I don\u2019t want to sound ungrateful, because this is by far the most romantic evening I\u2019ve ever had in my life, but I am curious why you\u2019re doing all of this,\u201d she finally asked.</p><p>\u201cThis is how a woman should be treated, Haley. She should be worshipped, wined and dined. When a beautiful lady takes the time to put on a stunning gown, she needs to be given the royal treatment. Men will fall all over themselves just for a chance to be in their woman\u2019s presence. The lesson in this is to teach you what your expectation should be in how a man treats you. If you want to attract your man, you first need to feel that you\u2019re worthy of attracting him. A night of romance should be deserved. When a man truly wants you, there is no limit to what he will do for nothing more than an evening in your presence.\u201d</p><p>The deep baritone of his voice, and the words he uttered, held Haley spellbound. Was she beautiful? As she\u2019d looked in the mirror at the glimmering teal gown, she\u2019d felt...different, more attractive. But would she go so far as to say she was beautiful? No one had ever told her she was \u2014 certainly not her grandparents \u2014 so how could she think that of herself?</p><p>She wanted to believe the light in his eyes was real, but could it all be just an act? He\u2019d refused to take payment from her for being her teacher, but was this all a game to him? She couldn\u2019t fault him for that, but what if he were setting her up, planning to rip her apart? She might never heal, might never have the confidence in herself that she so desperately sought.</p><p>\u201cI can see the doubt in your eyes; it\u2019s your biggest weakness. You have to have faith in yourself. You asked me to teach you how to seduce a man, but it\u2019s not an answer I can give you. The way you seduce a man is by having confidence in yourself. Remember what I told you? It doesn\u2019t matter if you are slim, athletic or curvy. It doesn\u2019t matter the color of your hair or eyes. Nothing matters except for you knowing that you are sexy. If you look into a man\u2019s eyes and let him know you are too good for him, then you own him. The most important rule is that you are what you believe you are, so be careful how you feel about yourself.\u201d</p><p>The truth was shining in his eyes as he spoke. Haley could see he wasn\u2019t playing a game with her, he wasn\u2019t lying just to make her his slave. Was it really that simple? Could she just believe she was a prize to be won, and suddenly have any man she wanted \u2014 at least if she really wanted him enough?</p><p>The waiter slipped in and took away her barely touched salad as he set down their next course, seared sea scallops with spring onion soubise. Though the smell was heavenly, she was too lost in Crew\u2019s eyes to pay attention to the food.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll have more on this lesson after our meal, while we\u2019re sitting by the fire. I\u2019ve had my chef prepare this especially for you, and I want you to enjoy the entire experience,\u201d Crew said and took a bite.</p><p>Finally freed from his gaze, Haley speared a scallop and slipped it inside her mouth, then purred in pleasure. It practically melted on her tongue. Crew kept the conversation more light as they finished their main course.</p><p>The last drop was drank from the exquisite bottle, the wine having helped Haley\u2019s confidence to grow, and the waiter laid out their dessert and set a new bottle down at their table. Her first bite of beignets with coffee pots de cr\u00e8me was almost an out-of-body experience. But, still, it was hard to enjoy the meal, no matter how good, when she was in a constant state of arousal \u2014 something very new for her inexperienced body.</p><p>\u201cSo, tell me how your sister managed to end up on a ranch,\u201d she asked between small bites. She wanted to prolong the bliss.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to bore you during our date,\u201d he hedged.</p><p>\u201cI promise that you won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, don\u2019t say that I didn\u2019t warn you,\u201d he said with a chuckle. \u201cA couple of years ago, my siblings and I were...I guess the word would be spoiled.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou? Spoiled?\u201d she gasped dramatically, then smiled. \u201cI simply can\u2019t imagine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOK, yes, I was spoiled. This is about Brielle, not me, though,\u201d he said with his twinkling eyes crinkling at the corners.</p><p>\u201cSorry. I will behave,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cAnyway, my father decided to teach us a lesson. We would lose our inheritance and trust funds if we didn\u2019t play by his rules. That, of course, left us little choice but to do what he asked of us, but we were all resentful, thinking there was nothing that needed changing in our lives.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDo you still feel bitter toward your father?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. About six months into this project my resentment faded, and I realized he was right. We had become spoiled brats \u2014 of no use to society at all. I will deny that if you repeat it, though,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cMy lips are sealed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, the task was to take a failing business and make it a success.\u201d She waited for him to go on, but he picked up his glass and took a sip of wine.</p> <p>\u201cHow did you end up with the resort and your sister get landed with a ranch?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy father set down five folders and told us to fight among ourselves over which failing business we would take. My sister was horrified, and she refused to even look at the various operations. By the time she came around and decided a life of poverty wasn\u2019t for her, the ranch was all that was left. Let\u2019s just say that she threw a fit, and tried to bribe, cajole, and blackmail each of us to trade. No one would. So, long story short, she was stuck with the ranch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd how does she feel now?\u201d Haley thought she\u2019d get along really well with Crew\u2019s father. He sounded like a good man.</p><p>\u201cShe won\u2019t admit it to our father, but she loves it. Her first week there, she called me ten times a day in tears, telling me nothing was worth what she was going through, but after a few months, the calls started coming in less often. I had my doubts that she would see it through, but I am very proud of her now. She\u2019s grown more than the rest of us, I believe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe sounds like a good woman.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShe is now. Without a doubt, she was once a self-centered little witch, but this lesson has changed all of us for the better, and probably Brielle the most. My siblings and I are closer than we have been since we were small kids, and this last Christmas was the first time we all got together because we wanted to, and not because we were obligated to. It has changed us, and I am grateful to my father for giving us a swift kick in the derri\u00e8re,\u201d Crew said with a small smile.</p><p>This man before her was strong as solid steel, both with his love of his family and his complete focus on helping a stranger. He was also kind and gentle when he needed to be, loyal and compassionate. How could Haley help but fall for him? She knew it was a deadly error. But she didn\u2019t know how to pull back, how to lock down emotions that she\u2019d never felt before. Somehow, she must try. Could she just focus on Walker?...Who? She couldn\u2019t even seem to picture the face of the man who was the reason she\u2019d begun this entire process.</p><p>A peaceful silence surrounded them as they continued eating, both of them lost in their own thoughts. She just hoped Crew never became a mind reader, because she didn\u2019t want to reveal so much about herself.</p><p>When they\u2019d taken their last bite, Crew led her to a couple of lounge chairs placed side by side, with a fire burning in a pit off to the side, keeping a dim glow of light around them. Haley slipped off her shoes, and the sand felt soft and cool as it slid between her toes. As she looked around, she realized they were completely alone. This must be his own personal area.</p><p>Haley lay back on one of the chairs, enjoying the soft breeze blowing over her, and she felt Crew\u2019s hand move gently across her stomach, sending butterflies fluttering from the pit of her stomach to her toes and back.</p><p>\u201cSeduce me, Haley,\u201d he whispered.</p> <p>She turned her head, her eyes suddenly heavy as she looked at him.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know how. You\u2019re supposed to teach me,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>\u201cSeduce me,\u201d he repeated, heat flaring between them.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t...\u201d she trailed off.</p><p>\u201cSeduce me.\u201d</p><p>Something inside her came alive and her body moved. She didn\u2019t know what she was doing, but somehow nature took over and it became all about quenching the fire within her.</p><p>Chapter Fourteen</p><p>Crew watched the flare in her eyes as she made her decision. There was passion in those green depths, but there was also grit and determination. She was done being a wallflower and was ready to explore what was locked within the deepest realms of her being.</p> <p>As difficult as it was for him to keep his hands to himself, he lay back and waited. She needed to break free, and for her to do that, she had to escape from her shell. He wouldn\u2019t let it go too far, not far enough that she\u2019d have regrets. He would just let her see what effect she had on him.</p><p>After their last course, he\u2019d dismissed his waitstaff, to eliminate the chance of interruption. He could now give her a hands-on lesson of what a woman could do to a man. Damn but he was attracted to her, and that was a problem for his noble plan. He never would have believed that this was the same woman who\u2019d stepped into his life on a sidewalk and offered him money.</p><p>She\u2019d already grown, and now it was time for him to show her exactly how much.</p><p>Lifting the fabric of her skirt above her knees, Haley moved over, straddling his lap and positioning her luscious round behind right against his rapidly growing erection. A groan escaped from his throat, and she smiled in victory.</p><p>Watching her expressions as she tentatively moved her hips in a slow circle was about the sexiest damned thing he\u2019d ever witnessed in his life. He was certain he wouldn\u2019t survive her exploration.</p><p>\u201cWhat do I do?\u201d she asked as her hands rested on his chest. He wouldn\u2019t tell her. She had to listen to what her body was demanding of her. She needed to let go of her inhibitions and dance to the beat of her heart.</p><p>\u201cYou need to seduce me. Make me think of no woman other than you,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>She tensed as if unsure of the next step, then slowly bent forward. He almost breathed out in relief as her lips neared his. He wanted to taste her flavor, devour her mouth. But she kissed only the corner of his lips before moving on to his chin.</p><p>When her mouth trailed delicate kisses along his jaw, and then her tongue smoothed its way along his neck, his erection jumped painfully as it tried to escape the confines of his slacks. She could obviously feel his excitement, because she pushed her hips harder against him as the two of them played a very dangerous game.</p><p>No longer able to refrain from touching her, Crew lifted his hands and ran them through the strands of her soft blond hair. Pulling out the clips and band holding it captive, he sighed as her hair cascaded down, creating a glowing curtain between her face and his body.</p><p>Haley leaned up, and he wanted to protest as her mouth left his skin, but then her shaking fingers moved to the top button of his shirt, and his heart stopped for a moment before it resumed with a pounding intensity.</p><p>One by one, she undid his buttons until the material fell to his sides. Then her fingernails scraped along the light brushing of hair on his chest and she drew patterns on his skin, then circled his hard nipples.</p><p>When she bent down and ran her tongue over the tanned skin of his chest, his back arched off the lounge chair.</p><p>She was learning quickly. He was going to have to end this soon \u2014 before he couldn\u2019t.</p><p>Just as he was getting ready to tell her, Good job, you\u2019ve succeeded in seducing me, her lips traveled lower and the hot breath from her mouth was now on his stomach. No words could possibly escape his tight throat.</p><p>When he thought she\u2019d stop, her hand drifted lower, running across the hardness begging to be set free. She glided her skillful fingers across the head of his clothes-covered arousal and he could feel himself losing control. When she took care of his button and zipper, his sanity flew out the window.</p><p>He knew he should stop this \u2014 knew this wasn\u2019t part of the deal \u2014 but he was human, after all. Thank heavens, he always had protection on him, whether he planned on sex or not. It was just something instilled in him \u2014 the old Boy Scout motto. Before he lost his mind altogether \u2014 along with his pants \u2014 he grabbed the foil packet from his pocket and clutched it tightly within his palm.</p><p>The first tentative swipe of her tongue along the tip of his arousal was the last of his undoing. His mind went blank as she worked her innocent magic. When she sucked him into the warm recesses of her mouth, he saw stars.</p><p>Mission accomplished.</p><p>He enjoyed the unbelievable pleasure of her mouth fully around his head for a few more moments before he couldn\u2019t take any more without embarrassing himself.</p><p>\u201cMy turn,\u201d he gasped, then sat up and grabbed her by the hips, quickly pulling her up his body so she was sitting on his lap.</p><p>\u201cYou taste salty and sweet, silky...yet so hard. I want to do that some more.\u201d</p><p>Her enthusiasm had him throbbing to the point of madness.</p><p>\u201cBaby, you can do it plenty more later, but right now, I need to taste you,\u201d he said before pulling her to him and finally closing his mouth over hers. As his tongue slipped inside her warm mouth, he knew he just couldn\u2019t get enough. Nothing was enough.</p><p>Not deep enough.</p><p>Not long enough.</p><p>Not fast enough.</p><p>Not slow enough.</p><p>Not enough of her open to his touch.</p><p>His hands found the clasp behind her neck and he quickly undid it before sliding her straps down her naked back and finding the zipper to undo the skirt of her dress. Within seconds, her bare breasts pressed against his naked chest.</p><p>As her hard nipples rubbed against his skin, she groaned into his mouth, and rubbed her hips against him. Lifting her dress, he quickly pulled it up over her head and tossed it aside, then raised his hips and thrust down his pants. The only thing keeping him from entering her was an incredibly small piece of black lace.</p><p>As his erection throbbed against her \u2014 so hot! \u2014 he decided he\u2019d better change positions fast before he plunged in and satisfied only himself. She\u2019d done her job of seducing him; now it was his turn to seduce her.</p><p>Haley gasped to find herself on her back, looking up at Crew whose frame was enveloped in the black night sky with speckled brilliant stars surrounding him like an aura. Crew smiled down at her, excitement shuddering through him. Kissing her again, he lay on top of her, enjoying the way her soft curves held him just right.</p><p>As she pushed her hips up toward him, her body telling him exactly what she desired, he moved his mouth down her throat, taking a moment to feel her excited pulse against his tongue as her blood raced.</p><p>His first taste of her dusky nipples was magical, and he sucked her deep within his mouth as she groaned her approval. Lavishing her breasts with nips, kisses, flicks of his tongue and the stroke of his fingers while her hands fisted in his hair, Crew felt on the verge of breaking.</p><p>But only when he had made her come would he take his own pleasure. As he continued fondling her generous breasts with one hand, he moved the other one downward, easily ripping away her panties, then slipping a finger inside her wet heat.</p><p>When his thumb began stroking her swollen womanhood, she bucked against his hand, her breathing shallow, panting. He bit down gently on her nipple as he flicked his thumb across her tender flesh below, and then moved up just in time to capture her scream with his lips as her body released, his fingers saturated with her orgasm.</p><p>Before she was finished, Crew barely managed to sheath himself before he opened her legs wide and positioned himself.</p><p>\u201cOpen your eyes,\u201d he demanded, barely recognizing his own strained voice.</p><p>When Haley could open them just enough for him to see how she was feeling, he plunged fully inside her, nearly exploding as her tight skin closed around him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Before he pulled back to plunge in again, the pain on her face registered somewhere in his mind. Her mouth gaped open as her nails dug into the skin of his arms.</p><p>Crew was so shocked, he couldn\u2019t seem to move. She was a virgin. It was evident by the tightness, the pain crossing her features, the shocked look on her face.</p><p>\u201cWhy? How?\u201d He whispered as he stilled, staying connected inside her.</p><p>\u201cOuch,\u201d was her reply.</p> <p>Noble? Ha. He felt decidedly unheroic.</p><p>Finally regaining a semblance of control, Crew tenderly pulled out of her, then reached below the lounge chair and grabbed a blanket he\u2019d placed there earlier.</p><p>He turned on his back and pulled her tightly against him, then covered them both. His body was still throbbing dangerously \u2014 could he be risking permanent damage? \u2014 but he wouldn\u2019t go on until she talked to him, explained.</p><p>She\u2019d just given him something so special, a gift indescribably sacred. The least he could give her in return was a chance to adjust. The one thing he wouldn\u2019t give her was freedom.</p><p>In a blink of an eye, she\u2019d just become his, and there was no way he was teaching her how to seduce another man. She was his now, only his.</p> <p>Chapter Fifteen</p><p>As Haley lay in Crew\u2019s arms, his hand rubbed soothingly up and down her back. He said nothing while she sorted through the varying emotions filling her heart and whirling in her mind. She was in a bit of shock, a little pain, and a lot of pleasure.</p><p>Her body was aching, but the burning had already gone away, and now she was more filled with confusion than anything else. She\u2019d never before been with a man, and yet his soft whisperings of seduce me had made her turn into a wanton.</p><p>Hadn\u2019t her grandmother once told her that all women were whores? She\u2019d said that Haley\u2019s mother had been a whore and that\u2019s why she\u2019d gotten pregnant. She\u2019d blamed Haley\u2019s mother for being a whore, and blamed Haley for being alive. Haley was an abomination that never should have been born, and it was all because of sex. Lord, just remembering those bitter tirades the few times her grandmother even deigned to speak to her sent her thoughts tumbling over each other wildly.</p><p>Even knowing all of this, Haley had still lain with a man, was still lying across his chest. She might not be fifteen, as her mother had been, but she hadn\u2019t once thought about protection. His words seduce me had melted her from the inside out, and instinct had drowned out all rational thought. Her body had reached blindly for relief. And she\u2019d felt relief in spades, though Crew hadn\u2019t.</p><p>How could something that felt so wonderful be wrong? What if her grandmother was wrong? The world would end if people didn\u2019t make new children, wouldn\u2019t it? So sex couldn\u2019t be the evil thing her grandmother had taught her it was. The old woman had obviously had sex herself. Haley had never thought to question whether her grandmother thought of herself as a whore too. Maybe the old hypocrite had only done it that one time out of duty. It wouldn\u2019t surprise Haley a bit.</p> <p>As Haley lay in Crew\u2019s arms, she didn\u2019t feel shame, she felt...something indescribable. She felt safe and comforted. She felt as if what she was doing was right.</p><p>\u201cTalk to me, Haley. Why wouldn\u2019t you tell me you are a virgin?\u201d When she was silent, he continued. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean for this to go so far...at least not tonight. I just wanted you to see how desirable you are.\u201d He stopped as a deep sigh emerged from within his chest and vibrated through her body. \u201cThere\u2019s obviously no problem there, because you made me lose my mind. I\u2019m still burning for you, though I know I shouldn\u2019t be. Yes, you are an amazing seductress.\u201d</p><p>Curiosity to see whether he was telling the truth made Haley move. Her hand slid down his chest, past his stomach, which quivered at her touch, and then over his still-sheathed manhood, which, true to his word, was hard as stone.</p><p>Fearlessly, she cupped her hand around his thick shaft and gently squeezed it.</p><p>\u201cHaley...\u201d he warned. \u201cI\u2019m trying to get this to go away...\u201d His sentence ended on a moan.</p><p>But she didn\u2019t want it to go away; she wanted him to experience the same firestorm of feeling that she had.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t tell you. I wasn\u2019t expecting... I mean, I didn\u2019t think we\u2019d...\u201d Her words trailed off.</p><p>\u201cIf you keep stroking me like that, I\u2019m not going to be able to remain a gentleman,\u201d he warned.</p> <p>Instead of backing off, she tightened her fingers around him and moved her hand down, and then up again around the head of his arousal.</p><p>\u201cHaley,\u201d he groaned as he lifted his head and gently took her lips in his. She didn\u2019t hesitate, clasping onto his supple mouth and accepting the caress of his lips, her hands finally moving from his shaft only so she could clasp his head.</p><p>He shifted so they were lying side by side beneath the blanket, his hand rising to enclose her breast, stirring the ever burning coals of desire in her stomach. She felt a pulsing throb begin in her core, as if begging to have him within her body again.</p><p>Fear of the pain of his entry was fading as one of his hands rubbed her swollen nipples, and the other ran along her back and then down to grip her enticing behind. She wiggled in his grasp, not able to get close enough to him.</p><p>More. She needed more.</p><p>\u201cWe shouldn\u2019t do this. I don't want to hurt you,\u201d he warned.</p><p>\u201cEverybody does this, and the slight pain is so worth the pleasure,\u201d she countered.</p><p>With a moan, Crew slowly turned her onto her back, leaned over and kissed her until she was breathless, then sucked her bottom lip into his mouth. Her hips lifted, seeking his touch.</p><p>His fingers moved down her stomach, and then, using the moistness from her body, he rubbed his fingers over that oh-so-pleasurable-spot, drawing out her lustful cry. Just as she was tightening, getting ready to fall headlong over that wonderful cliff again, he pulled back and her cries now voiced her protest.</p><p>A low chuckle at her impatience rumbled through his chest. \u201cLet\u2019s go over the edge together,\u201d he said as he slid over her, his body once again poised above hers, the head of his impressive arousal resting in the cradle of her thighs.</p><p>Yes. That was what she wanted. She wanted to fly with him, to soar away into paradise.</p><p>Far more controlled, Crew slid a couple inches inside her heat, her body stretching to accommodate him. She felt just the slightest pinch of discomfort, but he apparently could read her body better than she could, because he was slow and easy as he pushed in inch by beautiful inch.</p><p>By the time his hips were flush against hers, all Haley could feel was a pulsing need for him to move, to stoke the flames of burning desire that were radiating through her. He stilled as she wrapped her legs around his back, and tugged on him with her hands.</p><p>She might have been inexperienced, but her body was having no trouble telling her what she needed. Her limbs were moving as if they had a brain of their own.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m trying to be careful, Haley,\u201d he groaned as she continued tugging on him.</p><p>\u201cTake me, Crew. Please, now,\u201d she begged. \u201cI need you.\u201d</p><p>Watching his eyes flash with need, she cried out as he began to move, slowly and steadily, in and out of her heat, causing her body to throb.</p><p>Closer.</p><p>Higher.</p><p>Faster.</p><p>She was so close to exploding. She needed more, just a little more. Playing her like a master, he sped up, his body hitting against hers in all the right places.</p><p>\u201cYour body is so sexy, Haley. I want to be deep within your folds all day and night. The curve of your hips in my hand, the slickness of your heat encircling me.\u201d Crew breathed heavily as he continued to thrust inside her.</p><p>Haley couldn\u2019t form words, could only groan as he lifted her higher, his words pushing her even closer to the edge of glory.</p><p>Her tender breasts ached as they rubbed against his solid chest, her body fully enflamed.</p><p>Just as she felt him tense, felt his body stiffen, and his shaft began pulsing against the walls of her core, Haley flew apart, her body gripping him tight as she spiraled down a long tunnel into a dark abyss.</p><p>The first explosion had been wondrous and eye-opening; this one beggared speech. Crew stilled above her as the two of them flew down the mountain, their orgasms sapping their last ounce of energy. Haley barely registered the movement as he pulled from her body and shifted their positions so she was once again lying in his arms.</p><p>\u201cThank you for such a gift,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>She didn\u2019t understand what he was talking about, but she was embarrassed at her inexperience and didn\u2019t want him to realize how very little she knew of love.</p><p>\u201cWhy haven\u2019t you slept with a man before?\u201d he pressed on.</p><p>This she could answer. \u201cI told you when I met you that I wanted to learn to seduce a man. I didn\u2019t know how.\u201d It was pretty simple.</p><p>\u201cJust because you don\u2019t know how to seduce a man doesn\u2019t mean men aren\u2019t chasing after you,\u201d he said, the soothing feel of the tips of his fingers continuing to lazily trail up and down her spine, added to her relaxation in his arms.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want you to know who I really am.\u201d The thought terrified her. She was comfortable, sated, happy in this moment. She didn\u2019t want it ever to end. Didn\u2019t want her past to spoil the mood for either of them.</p><p>\u201cPlease tell me.\u201d He wasn\u2019t demanding answers but seemed honestly to want to know.</p><p>If he ran screaming, then at least she could say she\u2019d learned a lot about herself. There was a burning need inside her to tell him, to let him inside her childhood heartbreak. She hadn\u2019t really had anyone else to talk to before, no one like a friend. Wasn\u2019t it supposed to be therapeutic to get things off your chest?</p><p>Here goes, she thought, as she started to let the story pour out.</p><p>\u201cMy mother was only fifteen when she got pregnant with me. She was from a very affluent family and her parents were furious when they found out, but she\u2019d kept it hidden so long that they couldn\u2019t force her to get an abortion. Her parents told her she was a sinner and would burn in hell. I was born a month early and there were severe complications and she ended up bleeding to death on the table,\u201d she began.</p><p>\u201cOh, Haley, I\u2019m so sorry...\u201d he said, but she held a finger to his mouth. If she was going to get through this, she couldn\u2019t have him interrupting, or she\u2019d fall apart.</p><p>\u201cBoth of my grandparents thought I was an abomination, a sin come to life. They were ashamed of my mother, but some of their so-called friends had found out about me, so they couldn\u2019t give me up for adoption or they risked shame upon their family. They were stuck with a baby they didn\u2019t want and hated to look at.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHaley \u2014\u201d he tried again, sighing and tightening his arms around her in comfort.</p><p>\u201cThey hired a nanny and solidified the truth that they didn\u2019t ever really want to know me. The only time I ever even saw them was when they came to tell me how terribly I was doing, or what a disappointment I was. I grew up with the servants, who were kind to me, taking me under their wing and teaching me all I needed to know. My grandparents didn\u2019t send me to school until I was old enough for boarding school, and then only did that so I\u2019d be out of their house and they wouldn\u2019t have a constant reminder in front of them of the shame their daughter had brought upon them.\u201d Haley paused to wait for the lump to go away. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Crew said nothing, just gently stroked her back and waited for her to continue.</p><p>\u201cI was so ashamed of who I was, even though the servants tried for years to tell me that my grandparents were wrong. Many of them stayed on only so they could look out for me when I was home during school holidays, and I\u2019m grateful they did. It\u2019s why it\u2019s so much easier for me to speak with people in the service industry. I was never to show my face when my grandparents were entertaining guests. They didn\u2019t want to remind the community that I was around. They\u2019d done their duty by providing a roof over my head and food, but that was as far as they were willing to go.</p><p>\u201cHow was school? Did it give you freedom?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. School was worse than home. My grandparents paid my tuition and gave me the bare minimum of supplies and clothing, but I was going to a wealthy school where all of the other kids had plenty of money to spend on activities and socializing. I had nothing and was left behind. They all looked at me like a charity case, and I made zero friends while there. It was lonely, of course. I always was. I became interested in boys even though I had my grandmother\u2019s voice in my head calling me a slut for even thinking about wanting to kiss one of them.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShe was wrong!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that now. I honestly do, but it took me years. My grandparents died when I was eighteen. There was a gas leak in the house and they passed in their sleep. Even though they were horrible to me, I still felt sadness. None of the servants died \u2014they slept in separate quarters behind the house. They\u2019ve moved on, and we\u2019ve now lost touch. A couple checked on me for a couple of years after the death of my grandparents, but then they had to worry about their own lives. The house sits empty, only a gardener left to make sure the grass doesn\u2019t overtake it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, you\u2019ve held on to it for six years?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t sold it yet. I honestly don\u2019t know why. It took over a year for all the estate to finalize and for me to get my inheritance since there wasn\u2019t a will. I have always planned on getting rid of it. There are no happy memories there for me now, I just haven\u2019t done it yet. I will...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know how I can make any of this better for you, Haley. I can\u2019t even say that I understand, because I don\u2019t. It\u2019s inconceivable for me to think of people treating one of their own kin, someone they are supposed to love, in that heartless, inhuman way.\u201d</p> <p>Silence stretched out between them as she tried to push her raw emotions down. She\u2019d shared her tale with only one other person, her counselor at college, and it had helped her to see she wasn\u2019t a child of Satan who didn\u2019t deserve to live. Still, it wasn\u2019t easy to get beyond the horrors of her early life.</p><p>She hated admitting all of this to Crew, since she wanted him to view her as something more than a child in the shadows, but it also felt good to get it off her chest, to share this burden with another human being, one who wasn\u2019t being paid to listen. As much as speaking with her counselor had helped, the woman had just sat behind her desk taking notes, hadn\u2019t rubbed Haley\u2019s back and let her know it would all be OK. Still, without her, Haley would never have had the confidence to get a job or take this vacation she\u2019d won, or ever been able to approach Crew to ask for his help.</p><p>It had taken her years to gain the courage to try to change who she was. She wanted to find a man who would look at her, desire her, maybe even love her. Every romantic movie she\u2019d watched had a hero racing in to save the day, and she\u2019d ached for that, whether it was politically correct or not. She wanted her prince charming to save her.</p><p>\u201cSo, you decided to change your life, and then you found me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Not quite that quickly. It took me years to work up the courage to actually find a man to teach me,\u201d she admitted. \u201cI came here because I won the trip, and I figured this was a good place to find a teacher because it\u2019s an island \u2014 much harder for a man to escape,\u201d she finished with a laugh.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to escape you.\u201d The words sounded wonderful, but she wasn\u2019t stupid. They were both caught up in this magical night \u2014 in this surreal moment. They would probably both see things in another light once dawn approached.</p> <p>\u201cYou are teaching me to feel different about myself, Crew. I\u2019ve felt things in the last week that I never imagined I would, but this is all just a fantasy, a game I came up with to change who I am. It may work, and it may not, but I don\u2019t want to think past right now. I need to remain in reality.\u201d She pleaded with him to understand. \u201cLet\u2019s not pretend this is something it isn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>After a short pause, he responded. \u201cI will agree to live in the moment if you agree to quit the game and give me a chance. I\u2019m not a bad guy, and though it surprises me to say this, I like you, Haley...a lot. Let\u2019s forget about this other man you wanted to seduce, and focus on having you seduce only me from now on. You\u2019re pretty damned great at it!\u201d</p><p>Haley knew there was a reason she should protest \u2014 knew she\u2019d figure out what that reason was if she thought about it long enough, but while his hands caressed her, while his warmth kept her sated and secure, she couldn\u2019t find fault with what he was asking of her. After a brief pause, she nodded her head.</p><p>\u201cSay it, Haley.\u201d The nod wasn\u2019t good enough.</p><p>\u201cI will forget the other guy...for now.\u201d She knew her answer wasn\u2019t good enough for Crew, but at least he wasn\u2019t pushing her.</p><p>The two of them lay in each other\u2019s arms for the next hour, or two \u2014 they didn\u2019t know \u2014 listening to the soothing sound of the ocean waves until the cool evening air had them admitting it was time to go in. When Crew led her to his room that night, she didn\u2019t fight him. She wasn\u2019t ready to let go just yet.</p><p>Pulling her into his arms to hold her and nothing more, she felt the first warm stirrings in her untutored heart. But she couldn\u2019t be falling in love with him. She didn\u2019t know what love was, had no examples of it in her life. Her emotions were clearly just in overdrive from everything that had occurred during the day, and night.</p><p>Falling asleep with a smile on her face and Crew\u2019s arms wrapped around her, she slept better than she ever had before.</p> <p>Chapter Sixteen</p><p>\u201cWake up. We\u2019re going to one of my favorite places for lunch.\u201d</p><p>Haley felt as if one-ton weights were pressed against her eyelids. Wake up? No way. She was warm, sated, very sore, and unwilling ever to climb from bed again. Maybe if she ignored him, he\u2019d eventually go away. It was worth a shot.</p><p>\u201cPretending to be asleep won\u2019t do you any good. It\u2019s already noon. I\u2019ve gotten in four hours of work and a ten-mile jog on the beach, plus I calmed down my sister on a half-hour-long phone call.\u201d</p><p>Crew was sounding way too cheery. \u201cShow-off,\u201d she muttered under her breath. She wanted to throw one pillow at his face, and bury her head underneath another one. She wasn\u2019t budging.</p><p>\u201cHaley, I can see your muscles tensing. I know you\u2019re awake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t be if you\u2019d kindly shut up,\u201d she grumbled, savagely twisting her body away from the sound of his voice and snuggling down deeper into the softness of his mattress.</p><p>Normally, Haley was a very happy person in the mornings, but she\u2019d stayed up long into the night. And anyway, accomplished seductresses needed their beauty rest.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m taking you to my favorite place on the island to eat. Now get up,\u201d he said before playfully swatting her on her bare behind. She was so shocked, she sat up in bed, clutching the sheet to her chest, her eyes wide as she looked into his smiling face.</p><p>This wasn\u2019t the same man she\u2019d met a week before.</p><p>\u201cI saw and tasted your luscious curves last night...twice. Why hide them now?\u201d he asked as he sat on the bed and ran his finger along the top of the sheet in an attempt to free it from her grip.</p><p>\u201cThat was...well, that was...\u201d She didn\u2019t know what she wanted to say.</p><p>\u201cSomething we will do again and again,\u201d he finished for her.</p><p>Haley was in shock. She hadn\u2019t known what to expect this morning, but certainly not this playful, lighthearted Crew. She had expected him to look at her with pity, or not look at her at all, having made his conquest.</p><p>\u201cThat wasn\u2019t our deal,\u201d she finally said as her fingers clung to the silken sheet \u2014 her only protection at the moment. She had a sudden desire to slip into one of her baggy tops and hide away for the next week.</p><p>\u201cThe deal has changed,\u201d he answered her simply. \u201cIf you keep gazing at me with those wide, innocent eyes, looking so delectable, I will have to forget about taking you out, and just ravish you all day instead.\u201d</p><p>The desire instantly forming in his expression had her green eyes rounding. She wasn\u2019t so sure that was a bad idea.</p><p>\u201cWoman!\u201d he groaned as he got up and walked to the door as if it would somehow protect them both. \u201cYou were a virgin and you got a serious workout last night. It would do more damage than good for us to go another round. Please, for the sake of my health, too, get showered and dressed before I change my mind.\u201d</p><p>With those words, he turned and left the suite\u2019s bedroom, leaving Haley leaning back against the headboard with a thoughtful smile on her face.</p><p>This was what he\u2019d been talking about \u2014 this feeling of power, of knowing she was responsible for making his body harden, for making him want her. She was getting a small taste of what it felt like to be a seductress \u2014 and she liked it.</p><p>Fully awake now and ready for her day out with Crew, she jumped from the bed, letting the sheet drop without feelings of shame as she walked into the bathroom and climbed into the shower. She didn\u2019t realize what he was talking about until her hand ran over the outside of her core while she was washing.</p><p>She was tender, and now grateful for his consideration. She suspected that walking around would be difficult enough on her.</p><p>Panicking for a moment when she realized she was in Crew\u2019s suite, she returned to his bedroom, then sighed with relief when she found her newly purchased outfits sitting atop his bed. He thought of everything.</p><p>Thankfully, she\u2019d bought some silky panties that wouldn\u2019t scrape against her lower regions. With care, she slid them on, and then chose a skirt and blouse.</p><p>Haley was happy with what she saw in the mirror. Her new colorful clothes made her feel feminine and appealing. She decided to put on a little makeup, which she\u2019d found after rummaging through the bathroom drawers in search of a washcloth. Who had brought it here and knew that she\u2019d stayed in the owner\u2019s suite? It was too mortifying to think about.</p><p>She was just finishing placing her hair into a loose bun when Crew joined her.</p><p>\u201cYou look good enough to lick up and down your entire body. Do you smell just as tasty?\u201d he asked as he pulled her into his arms and lowered his head. As his lips tugged on hers, Haley forgot all about soreness and pushed her body up against his. This was something she could get used to.</p><p>With a growl, Crew pulled back and looked deep in her eyes. \u201cYes. Yes, you do,\u201d he said before pulling back and grasping her hands. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThanks for having my things here,\u201d she said shyly. He must have seen the blush stealing across her cheeks because he answered her earlier question.</p><p>\u201cI went to your room and picked up what I thought you might need.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, Crew. I don\u2019t know if many men would have been so considerate,\u201d she said and followed him to the living area.</p><p>\u201cWould you like a cup of coffee and a pastry before we go?\u201d</p> <p>She sat down and happily poured herself a cup, then added cream and sugar before taking a sip. Sighing with pleasure at the much-needed caffeine, she pulled a foot up and hugged her leg while taking small sips and briefly attempting to interpret the clouds in her coffee.</p><p>Passing on the pastry so she wouldn\u2019t ruin her lunch, she took a moment to study Crew as he conducted a phone call. She didn\u2019t understand how the two of them had reached this place so quickly, how she\u2019d had the boldness to make love to him, but she found that she had no regrets. Even if their time together turned out to be short, she knew she\u2019d carry the memories with her for years to come.</p><p>Haley had the feeling that getting over a man like Crew wouldn\u2019t be an easy task. It didn\u2019t matter, though, and it wasn\u2019t worth dwelling on. She was living in the here and now, and it was a great place to be. Whatever happened, happened. That was going to be her new motto.</p><p>At the very least, she\u2019d walk away with more confidence and knowing she\u2019d been well satisfied and treated well. Her grandmother had always said that all men were only after sex and they didn\u2019t care about who they slept with. Even if that was true, she had him in this moment, and that was surely worth something. Besides, she was after sex, too, she thought wickedly.</p><p>No one could predict tomorrow with perfect accuracy. All you could do was make a guess, throw in your wager, and hope for the turnout you wanted. And that was what she\u2019d do every day as long as this lasted.</p> <p>\u201cAre you ready?\u201d he asked as he disconnected his call.</p><p>\u201cYes. Let\u2019s see if this caf\u00e9 is as good as you think it is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour faith in me is humbling,\u201d he said, chortling, and Haley added one more item to her list of things she liked about Crew. He could laugh at himself.</p><p>\u201cIt may look like a dive, but I\u2019m telling you, Aunt Mae makes the best food I\u2019ve ever tasted, and I\u2019ve traveled a lot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t lived here very long, have you? I thought you moved here only two years ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did move here two years ago, but my family owns a home on the other side of the island and we spent at least a couple of weeks a year here. I discovered Aunt Mae\u2019s caf\u00e9 when I was sixteen, and I\u2019ve been coming back ever since.</p> <p>\u201cWell, I hope it\u2019s as good as you say because right now I feel like I could take a knife and fork to a grizzly.\u201d</p><p>Crew stopped and laughed before opening the restaurant door. He was relieved to see her want a decent meal, for too often she just picked at her food. If he\u2019d thought for a moment it was because she was putting on airs or worried about her figure, he\u2019d be disgusted. Women who did that irritated him.</p><p>With Haley, he suspected that stress was the biggest problem. If she was worried about something, or frightened, she didn\u2019t function right. When she was happy or sated \u2014 he\u2019d done a good job with that last night \u2014 then she seemed to have a bottomless appetite.</p><p>Well, he\u2019d brought her to the right place. Aunt Mae liked to pile on the food. He didn\u2019t even bother ordering when he came here. Whatever she decided to bring him was always top notch.</p><p>He could see the surprise in Haley\u2019s eyes as they walked through the rickety door with tall, lush plants framing it. The building needed a fresh coat of paint and was in desperate need of new furnishings, but no matter how many times he\u2019d offered his help, pleaded with her to accept it, or even tried to force it upon her, Aunt Mae had turned him down flat.</p><p>The tables were scarred, but she said that just added to the atmosphere. He knew that one of these days, the rickety chairs were going to leave him with his ass on the floor, but the food was divine and the d\u00e9cor just added to the experience.</p><p>Crew and Haley were lucky to find two bar stools open, and they sat down and rested their arms on the worn yet squeaky-clean counter. Behind it was an open window with a behemoth of a man wiping his brow with his forearm as he flipped burgers in the air.</p><p>Crew watched Haley eye the colorful posters announcing various menu items; there wasn\u2019t a handheld menu in sight. The pies sat in a small display case on the end of the counter, and the oven-baked aromas drifted out to torment them, making Haley\u2019s stomach rumble loudly.</p> <p>\u201cI guess you are hungry,\u201d he said with a grin as Aunt Mae approached them.</p><p>Haley\u2019s eyes widened at the stick-thin figure who couldn\u2019t reach five feet tall if she were wearing heels. Aunt Mae planted her hands on the counter, then leaned forward and gave Crew a kiss on the cheek before turning suspicious eyes on Haley.</p><p>Crew had never brought another woman in here, so he could see the surprise in the woman\u2019s eyes and knew she was judging Haley. He wasn\u2019t worried. There was something about Haley that drew others to her, and he was sure that by the end of their lunch, Aunt Mae would be trying to coddle her and send her home with a doggie bag loaded with food.</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t visited me in weeks, Crew Storm. What makes you think I\u2019ll serve up anything for you to eat?\u201d she pouted, and Crew could see the surprise in Haley\u2019s eyes at the deep, husky voice that didn\u2019t match her petite face and body. Years of hard booze and cheap cigarettes had given her what was just one of her many charms in Crew\u2019s eyes.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been busy getting the new resort running, Aunt Mae. I\u2019ve noticed you haven\u2019t taken up my offer of staying a night and testing out my chefs,\u201d he countered, and she blushed.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t stay in your hoity-toity resort. I\u2019d never be able to sleep again in my shabby little room upstairs. I will make it over some night to get a free meal. I\u2019m not telling you until it\u2019s over, though. I don\u2019t want you telling them to fix something special. The best way for me to see if they\u2019re good enough to be cooking for you is for them not to know who I am.\u201d</p><p>Though it wasn\u2019t widely known, Aunt Mae had been a top-rated food critic when she was younger. Getting fed up with all the terrible dishes she had to endure, she\u2019d given up her high-paying job and settled down to open her own place nearly thirty years before. The building had been old then, but in better shape.</p><p>Hard economic times had made the years rough, but she still had a steady stream of regular customers. One way or another, Crew would make sure she kept the place as long as she liked, even if he had to tie her down while the workers came in and made repairs.</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t dream of trying to fool you, Aunt Mae. You are far too wise a woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t get cheeky with me, boy! Now, who\u2019s this pretty little girl you\u2019ve brought in?\u201d she asked, turning her full gaze on Haley, who smiled big at her.</p><p>\u201cHaley Sutherland. It\u2019s nice to meet you.\u201d</p><p>Crew was shocked by the ease with which Haley spoke to Aunt Mae. A lot of folks were intimidated by her at first, despite her diminutive stature. Haley seemed right at home.</p><p>\u201cWell, well. What are you doing out with this hooligan?\u201d</p><p>Haley\u2019s grin never faltered. \u201cHe told me he was going to feed me the best meal I\u2019ve ever had. I could hardly resist,\u201d she said easily as Aunt Mae pulled out a cigarette and lit it, the smoke swirling in the air.</p><p>A man from a nearby table grumbled and Aunt Mae\u2019s eyes turned to fire as she looked right at him.</p><p>\u201cThis is my place. If you don\u2019t like the atmosphere, you know where the door is,\u201d she said pleasantly as she took another drag.</p><p>The fellow looked down as he speared a piece of battered fish and continued eating. It appeared he was willing to risk his life with secondhand smoke for the food...that must be some food, Haley thought to herself.</p><p>\u201cSo, Haley, what do you do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing at the moment. I quit my job so I could find a good enough man to teach me how to be the perfect seductress,\u201d she replied as if she were speaking of nothing more casual than going to the post office.</p><p>Crew\u2019s eyes rounded in shock, and he choked on the water he\u2019d just drunk. As he sputtered, he looked from her to Aunt Mae, wondering what his longtime friend was going to say to that remark. After a short pause, she put out her smoke and then laughed. The sound was raspy and a bit wheezy and asthmatic, and he always worried she was going to keel over when she did it.</p><p>\u201cI like this one, Crew. I like her a lot, much more than some of those broads I\u2019ve seen you with in town. I notice you\u2019ve been smart enough to never bring one of them in here,\u201d she said knowingly.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t like them enough to give them the treasure of your cooking, Aunt Mae.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a good answer, boy, a good answer,\u201d she said. Haley\u2019s stomach rumbled again and Aunt Mae turned her eyes back to her. \u201cI\u2019d better feed you before you turn into a skeleton right there in that chair.\u201d With that she turned and scribbled something on her notepad before seeing to another customer, who had managed to snag a spot at the end of the counter.</p><p>\u201cI like her,\u201d Haley commented, making him glow.</p><p>It shouldn\u2019t have mattered to him what Haley thought of Aunt Mae, but it did. Without realizing it, he\u2019d been testing her. Shyness he could understand, but if she\u2019d turned her nose up at a woman Crew cared about deeply, he wouldn\u2019t have wanted to be with her.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s a spitfire. Though she\u2019s in her sixties, you\u2019d never know it. I think she\u2019ll outlive us all,\u201d he said as Aunt Mae slapped down a plate between them.</p><p>At the look of lust in Haley\u2019s eyes over the sizzling cheese, artichoke and spinach appetizer, he fell a bit in love. She\u2019d barely touched his five-course meal, but Aunt Mae\u2019s secret menu was making her drool. Haley polished off most of their appetizer, then dug in when her shrimp pasta was placed in front of her.</p><p>When she looked at his seafood sandwich with longing, he offered her a bite, then felt himself turning hard at her deep moan of pleasure when she swallowed.</p><p>No sex today, he reminded himself. Tomorrow. He\u2019d have plenty of sex with her tomorrow. And somehow he\u2019d better keep her away from his bed for the day if he wanted to keep that promise to himself.</p><p>When their plates were cleaned, Haley leaned back with a satisfied grin. \u201cYou were right. That\u2019s the best meal I think I\u2019ve ever eaten. I\u2019m going to have to come here over and over while I\u2019m on the island. But right now, I don\u2019t think I could eat another bite.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t doubt it,\u201d he answered with a chuckle since she\u2019d polished off her meal, then eaten a quarter of his sandwich. It was nice to see her cheeks flushed and a relaxed look in her eyes.</p><p>\u201cHere\u2019s your dessert, Ms. Haley. This is my special cobbler. Don\u2019t even try and guess what\u2019s in it; just enjoy the heavenly taste,\u201d Aunt Mae said as she placed a warm bowl in front of both of them with sugary berries beneath a perfectly browned crust and vanilla ice cream melting on top. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know if we can...\u201d Crew started to protest.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Aunt Mae,\u201d Haley interrupted as she picked up the spoon and scooped up a large bite, placing it on her tongue. When her eyes rolled back and she sighed in ecstasy, the blood rushed to Crew\u2019s groin yet again. This lunch was going to bury him. Had he known eating a meal could be so damned erotic, he would have taken Haley to the corner for a loaded hot dog \u2014 extra onions.</p><p>When she was halfway through her cobbler, he watched as a piece of berry juice dripped out the corner of her mouth and her tongue emerged to lick it as best as she could. \u201cLet me,\u201d he said as he lifted his thumb and rubbed the trace of juice left behind over her chin and then her moist lower lip.</p><p>Without thinking \u2014 he couldn\u2019t stop himself \u2014 he leaned forward and sucked on her lip, the taste of berries and ice cream sweet on his tongue. When the tip of her tongue slid across his lip, he had to fight to keep from clinging tightly to her and kissing her the way he wanted to. No, not in front of Aunt Mae. That was for later.</p> <p>Pulling back, he locked his gaze with hers and filled his eyes with promise. He was going to take her to the furthest reaches of heaven and never let her settle back down on the ground again. The constant stirring inside his body was worth a bit of pain, because he felt alive and ready to conquer the world.</p><p>\u201cCrew Storm, that kind of look should be reserved for the bedroom only,\u201d Aunt Mae scolded as she set a bag on the counter in front of Haley. Crew couldn\u2019t help his wide grin, knowing the woman so well. She couldn\u2019t help but feed those she thought needed a little more plumping up.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d Haley asked brightly. Crew didn\u2019t know how she could even think about wanting more food after the meal she\u2019d eaten, but she eagerly opened the bag and peered in.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a treat for later. You come back and visit me soon, Ms. Haley \u2014 and leave Crew at home. I want to have some girl talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey...\u201d Crew said with mock hurt.</p> <p>\u201cI promise I\u2019ll be back soon,\u201d Haley grinned. Crew had no doubt she\u2019d be there tomorrow if she could get away.</p><p>\u201cI gotta get cleaned up now, but I\u2019d better see you both much sooner than your usual two weeks, Crew,\u201d she said with a slight glare his way before leaning forward and kissing him on the cheek again, then patting Haley\u2019s hand.</p><p>Crew pulled out his wallet and slipped two large bills into her tip jar when Aunt Mae wasn\u2019t looking, and Haley picked up her prized takeout bag.</p><p>The warm breeze blowing outside was perfect for a walk. Strolling back to the resort took them half an hour, but all they did there was leave the bag at the front desk, making sure the staff would have it delivered to Haley\u2019s room and refrigerated.</p><p>Crew took her on a walk through the touristy area that she hadn\u2019t yet visited, and they spent the next couple of hours going in and out of small shops.</p><p>When she found a quaint antique store, she rushed inside and started fondling small trinkets and old antiques. An old woodstove with a cast-iron skillet from the eighteen-hundreds then caught Haley\u2019s attention; Crew strolled over to a small glass case.</p> <p>Inside was an old diary, the leather frayed on the cover and edges, but it was open and he could clearly see writing inside. He was certain that the stories it contained would be fascinating. On impulse, he purchased the treasured item and had it wrapped, knowing he\u2019d find a good moment to give it to Haley as a gift. With her dreams of being an archaeologist, she would appreciate the words of an early settler.</p><p>When they left, he was also carrying her purchase, an old coffee grinder with a worn wooden box and small cast-iron handle.</p><p>\u201cWhy would you want that?\u201d He didn\u2019t see a use for it.</p><p>\u201cBecause it\u2019s amazing. Imagine the stories that could be told about this box. It\u2019s well over a hundred years old, and settlers used it to grind coffee beans in the early morning hours while they heated their water on the stove. Maybe a grandmother rocked her daughter\u2019s newborn baby while the mother rested for a few minutes on the other side of a curtain. Doesn\u2019t the past fascinate you? Don\u2019t you want to know how our ancestors survived harsh winters, the devastation of ruined crops, and enemy attacks?\u201d</p><p>Crew honestly had never thought about any of that \u2014 he was half asleep during his required history classes \u2014 but he didn\u2019t want to admit that to her. That he\u2019d ignored where he came from made him feel shallow and self-absorbed.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll have to go tour the one museum here, and more on the mainland.\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cOh yes, that would be so much fun. When I was a teenager, I wanted to own an antique store, but I realized I\u2019d never want to part with any of the items, so I\u2019d never be able to make it. My second dream career would probably be working with documents of the past, or in a museum. It\u2019s all just so fascinating. But, if I get my way, I will lead an archaeological dig, discovering an unknown ancient culture. That is the brass ring as far as I\u2019m concerned.\u201d</p><p>Crew beamed at her and patted his pocket. He\u2019d chosen his gift well, knowing she\u2019d pore through the pages for hours. Paying attention when women spoke was a critical survival skill. He\u2019d learned early that not paying attention could have dire consequences. His sister\u2019s wrath when they ignored her had been deadly.</p> <p>Crew and Haley continued to stroll the streets, but as the sun started to set, his phone rang with a minor emergency at the resort and he had to get back.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll meet you in a couple of hours,\u201d he promised before escorting her to the elevator. As the doors shut, he sighed. His day had been far too enjoyable to even think about work right now. But, as his manager came rushing toward him, he put away his personal feelings and focused on his other woman, the resort, and on the man he trusted so well.</p><p>Chapter Seventeen</p><p>Crew\u2019s minor mishap ended up being a couple on the fourth floor who\u2019d left their tub running. By the time it was discovered, the room below it had flooded, too. He\u2019d had to make sure the mess was cleaned up, his inconvenienced guests were transferred to a new hotel, offered full refunds, plus free stays and resort amenities, and the plumber was getting the job fixed quickly. Then, suddenly, it was three in the morning.</p><p>Though exhausted, he wanted to go straight to Haley\u2019s room, but he didn\u2019t want to wake her, so he instead trudged off to his own room, where he took a two-minute shower to wash off the grime from working in the slush, then fell face first into his depressingly empty bed.</p><p>Thinking sleep would be hard to come by, he was shocked when he woke up the next morning at eight, two hours later than usual. Not having time for the breakfast with Haley that he\u2019d promised himself the night before, he raced to his office, where he was thrust into a whole host of problems that made him want to pull out his hair.</p><p>As the day crept by, he dialed her room when he had a minute, but when he never got an answer, he realized it was time the woman entered the cellular age. Placing a rush order, he had a smart phone brought to the resort and delivered to her room, then tried texting her several times but with no reply.</p><p>Where had she disappeared to? He owned neither her nor her time, but as the day wore on, he kept missing her \u2014 which was strange in itself. By the time the sun was setting, he found himself wandering through the resort, seeking her company. He was falling in too deeply, he knew, but he had no desire to pull back.</p><p>The ever-changing faces of new clientele checking in and others checking out would normally excite him, but nothing seemed to stir his anticipation these days except for a wisp of a blonde who, on paper, was all wrong for him.</p><p>None of that mattered.</p><p>He wandered into his favorite lounge and found Marlin busy as always with a full crowd circling the bar and filling up the tables as his new pianist lured people in.</p><p>The atmosphere was especially animated because tonight was the first day of the Catalina Film Festival, and crowds had flocked to the island in hopes of spotting a favorite Hollywood star. The red carpet was rolled out, limos were traveling through town, and the streets were jammed.</p><p>Crew would be lucky to get five minutes alone with Haley over the next five days.</p><p>With determination, he took a seat at the bar, determined to get information out of Marlin. His bartender and Haley seemed to be quite chummy, so Crew hoped his loyal employee might know where she was.</p><p>As he listened to the clink of glasses and the cheerful voices of his patrons, and waited for Marlin to have a free moment, Crew took out a cigar. He didn\u2019t mind waiting \u2014 it meant his place of business was busy and a constant stream of cash was flowing in.</p><p>\u201cSorry I took so long, Mr. Storm. We\u2019ve been swamped all afternoon and into the evening. I don\u2019t expect we\u2019ll be slowing down any time in the near future,\u201d Marlin said as he pulled out a special bottle of single-malt scotch. He grabbed a glass and poured in three fingers of the fine liquor. Marlin pretended to be about to dull the experience with ice cubes, but Crew knew not to fall for that joke anymore.</p><p>Crew grabbed the glass and savored the first sip, enjoying the warm burn down his throat. With the night and day he\u2019d had, he could down the entire bottle and still not lose the tension in his shoulders, but no \u2014 he wanted to be sober when he found Haley.</p><p>\u201cHave you taken any breaks?\u201d Crew asked suspiciously. He knew Marlin would work himself to the bone if he didn\u2019t get caught. Crew admired the man\u2019s work ethic, but he didn\u2019t want his head bartender to get worn out when needed most.</p><p>\u201cWhy? Are you offering to take over? I think the ladies would enjoy that. You\u2019d get my tip jar filled up real fast,\u201d Marlin offered with a cackle, then lit a smoke and took a grateful drag.</p><p>Obviously, Marlin hadn\u2019t had a break, or even the time to sneak in one of his beloved smokes. Crew had worked the bar before, and he knew the drill well, but tonight he was on a mission and that didn\u2019t include warding off drunken socialites who had more money than brains.</p><p>\u201cMaybe some other time, but I\u2019ve been up since last night with only a few hours\u2019 sleep. I\u2019m starting to feel it,\u201d Crew told him as he blew out a fragrant puff of cigar smoke, which Marlin leaned over to smell.</p><p>\u201cDid you notice the two bombshells over in the booth? They\u2019ve been eyeing you since you walked in. The broads have more plastic on them than a Barbie doll, but man, are they hot! If it wasn\u2019t for my old lady, I might give \u2019em a wink or two. Not that I\u2019m their type.\u201d Marlin cackled again at his own brand of wit.</p><p>\u201cYes, I noticed them right off. They\u2019re kind of hard to miss in the getups they\u2019re...\u2018wearing.\u2019 Keep an eye out, and if they get too inebriated, have security escort them upstairs. I don\u2019t need anything to happen to the double-D twins,\u201d he said with a wink.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you just escort them on up yourself? I know how you like the girls with nothing but sex on their mind, and believe me, those women are looking to get laid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019ll pass, Marlin. They\u2019ll find their next victim soon enough.\u201d Even as he spoke, one of the girls had begun scanning the room for new prospects since it was obvious Crew wasn\u2019t interested. The other one wasn\u2019t giving up so easily. He had a bad feeling that if he stayed at the bar too long, she\u2019d work up the energy to approach. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Women like her weren\u2019t used to making the first move. They normally had to fend guys off. Well, he wasn\u2019t just any guy.</p><p>\u201cYeah, that\u2019s what I thought, especially with the way you\u2019ve been all googly-eyed over Ms. Sutherland,\u201d Marlin said as he put out his smoke, then moved down the bar quickly to replace a beer in front of one customer, and a gin and tonic in front of another.</p><p>Even if Marlin didn\u2019t seem to be paying attention, the man had eyes in the back of his head. He kept the drinks coming so customers never had the opportunity to think about leaving. It was why this lounge was making the most money in the resort, or the island for that matter, by a long shot.</p><p>\u201cSpeaking of Haley, have you seen her today?\u201d Crew tried to ask casually, but by the triumphant look in Marlin\u2019s eyes, he hadn\u2019t succeeded in downplaying the way he felt.</p> <p>That\u2019s why women were nothing but trouble, Crew warned himself.</p><p>\u201cYeah, she was in here about an hour ago. Had some soup and crackers, then said something about seeing the show tonight. I bet you\u2019re wanting to join her in that nice, dark theater.\u201d Marlin mocked him by making a kissing sound.</p><p>Seriously, the man was too old to be acting like a horny teenager.</p><p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d Crew said noncommittally.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t give all his secrets away, after all.</p> <p>Just as he got up to leave, his phone rang. With a frustrated groan, Crew picked it up, waved goodbye to Marlin, then headed toward his office. Perfect. A little longer until he got to meet up with Haley.</p><p>Chapter Eighteen</p><p>Crew\u2019s luck was out again, for things weren\u2019t going at all smoothly at his other lounge. The business there wasn\u2019t nearly as good as at Marlin\u2019s, and, worse, one of the employees had gotten into a fight with a patron and the manager had to fire the man on the spot. The guy was just lucky Crew hadn\u2019t been the one dealing with him.</p><p>Crew couldn\u2019t stand it when staff got unpleasant with their customers. Even if the customer was in the wrong, there were professional ways of handling it without making his resort look low-class.</p><p>Adding insult and injury, one of the cocktail waitresses got sick, and his other bartender slipped and sprained an ankle. This was certainly one of those nights in which Murphy\u2019s law ruled \u2014 anything that could go wrong, did.</p><p>So Crew did find himself behind the bar pouring drinks, and he wasn\u2019t happy about it. His manager was scrambling to call in replacement staff. This was all part of owning a resort, though. Everyone had to pitch in from time to time, even the owner \u2014 or sometimes the owner\u2019s family members. Crew would give anything, or almost anything, to have Ashton there with him. Hell, his younger brother had spent several years in Hawaii bartending while taking lessons in surfing, partying and being a jackass playboy. The kid was a pro, but he\u2019d turned things around, thankfully.</p> <p>Much to Crew\u2019s dismay, it didn\u2019t take long for the Double-Ds to hunt him down. He watched their eyes light up when they saw him trapped behind the counter. Twin feline grins spread across their faces as they nudged their way up to the bar. Two men eagerly jumped up to give them their stools and, on top of that, paid for their drinks.</p><p>Crew couldn\u2019t complain. The women had expensive tastes, and their swains\u2019 credit cards were racking up some serious income for him. If he ever wanted to sell the resort, the profit margins needed to stay well in the black. So, suppressing his shudders of disgust, he pasted on his most gracious and good-tempered smile as he leaned toward them. Surely a little light flirting couldn\u2019t get him into trouble.</p><p>\u201cAre you ladies enjoying your stay here at the Catalina Couture?\u201d he asked, keeping his voice low and warm.</p><p>\u201cMmm, well, the night sure has become a lot better now. We were in the film that won the \u2018Great Communicator\u2019 Award,\u201d one of them answered.</p><p>Crew barely managed to keep his laughter from exploding. He somehow pictured them for a much different type of film than one that would win an award from the Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation.</p><p>\u201cYes, we can be seen sitting at the bar during a seriously intense scene midway through,\u201d the other one piped in eagerly.</p><p>\u201cAfter the filming was over, another director came and spoke to us. He was greatly impressed. We\u2019re meeting him next week. Soon, we\u2019ll be front and center on the red carpet.\u201d</p><p>Crew had no doubt which kind of director wanted to meet with them. He was sure that if he himself were interested in triple-X movies, he\u2019d see the two of them front and center and wide open.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s wonderful. I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll see you in the next big Hollywood hit,\u201d he said, amazed he was able to keep a straight face. The two of them beamed at him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Kadence, and this is my bestie, Roxanne.\u201d</p><p>He could not care less what their names were. But a businessman\u2019s gotta do what a businessman\u2019s gotta do. \u201cLovely names for lovely ladies,\u201d he said as he refilled their glasses. Keep drinking up, girls. The poor saps they were completely ignoring kept on shelling out cash, and it would probably work in the men\u2019s favor.</p><p>\u201cYou are such a charmer, Crew. What are you doing later tonight?\u201d</p><p>The invitation in both their eyes was easily read. He had no doubt that one little nod of his head would have him in bed with the both of them. Nope. He\u2019d never been big on threesomes and he never would be.</p><p>\u201cAh, ladies, you are too much for me to handle. One night with you and I\u2019d never be the same man again,\u201d he said as if filled with regret.</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t need to be just one night, sugar...\u201d Kadence\u2019s red-tipped nail trailed down his forearm and Crew was coming to the end of his patience. His flirting wouldn\u2019t win him any great-communicator awards.</p><p>\u201cCrew, you\u2019re free to go do your real job now.\u201d Crew turned with relief as his replacement showed up with a smirk on her face. She could read him well, and she knew he wasn\u2019t enjoying himself.</p><p>The two girls stuck out their bottom lips with a pout. No doubt they\u2019d learned that at acting school for extras.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been a pleasure visiting with you lovely ladies this evening, but duty calls,\u201d he said, backing away.</p><p>Their disappointed sighs grew fainter and fainter as he fled the bar and made a straight path to the theater. It was time he found Haley. If she\u2019d gone off elsewhere, he was tracking her down one way or another.</p><p>Slipping inside the dimly lit room, Crew looked around, wondering how he was going to find Haley in the throng of people crowding the intimate tables arranged strategically around the warm setting.</p><p>Like the rest of his resort, the room was filled with a mixture of modern and old-world charm. Tables for two and four were positioned so everyone had a perfect view of the stage, but people weren\u2019t knocking into each other.</p><p>Along the back wall, where the lights were at their lowest, round bench seats circled tables that were just large enough to hold drinks and appetizers. He saw couples snuggle together while listening to the magical voice of his latest hire, a young woman whom he wouldn\u2019t be surprised to hear on the radio quite soon.</p><p>Her voice carried the customers off to another world as she sang of lost love and burnt bridges. He wasn\u2019t normally a fan of mushy love songs, but with her vocals, it didn\u2019t matter what she was singing about. Hand her the Congressional Register and they\u2019d still listen...</p><p>Crew finally spotted Haley in a small booth in the back corner. Since she hadn\u2019t noticed him yet, he took a moment to appreciate her understated but profound beauty, the dim glow of the lighting leaving half her face in the shadows.</p><p>The vocalist had Haley as mesmerized as the rest of his guests; like theirs, her eyes stayed glued to the small stage up front.</p><p>Crew was gratified to see his staff moving quietly from table to table, not disturbing the performance in any way, but keeping the guests supplied with drinks and plates of nibbles both warm and cold to keep any loud stomach rumbling at bay.</p><p>In the middle of an original song about young heartbreak, Crew slid in next to Haley, finally capturing her gaze and seeing her eyes grow round in pleasure. He knew he was a goner.</p><p>In such a ridiculously short amount of time, he was falling head over heels for this woman. She took his breath away, and he found himself wanting to give her the moon and stars. Oh, good grief. Shaking his head, he blamed his sappy thoughts on the lyrics and voice bewitching the room. Who wouldn\u2019t think of happily-ever-afters here? He\u2019d created the room with just that in mind \u2014 though not for himself.</p><p>Trying to gain back the breath that seemed to have left his chest, Crew leaned closer and took Haley\u2019s lips, running his tongue along the soft lines of her lush mouth until she lifted her hands up and grasped his neck, deepening the kiss as if their recent time apart had been painful for her, too.</p><p>Before their embrace got too heated for public consumption, he reluctantly pulled back and looked into her glowing eyes. The light from the soft wall sconces and dripping chandeliers made them almost translucent. Losing himself in them was exactly what he wanted to do.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s good to see you,\u201d he whispered as he nuzzled her neck.</p><p>\u201cI will spend the day apart from you any time if I get another kiss like that,\u201d she said huskily. He wanted to take her from the room right then and show her just how much he\u2019d missed her.</p><p>\u201cGood evening, Mr. Storm. Shall I get you your usual?\u201d</p><p>With a sigh, Crew leaned back and nodded at his waitress. \u201cAdd spinach dip and fresh baked chips, and have Joey throw in a bowl of soup.\u201d He was starving. Normally, only appetizers were served in the theater, but that didn\u2019t apply to him.</p><p>\u201cOooh, I\u2019ll have the same, but can I have some bread, too?\u201d Haley piped in.</p><p>His waitress nodded and hurried away.</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t eaten yet?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cNo. I was running around town today and forgot. Then, I was so entranced by the show, food was the farthest thing from my mind. Now that you brought it up, though, I can\u2019t think of anything else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can leave and I will take you to a real dinner. Or, better yet, we can go to my room and order room service. I have a sudden desire for strawberries and champagne, preferably eaten off your skin.\u201d</p><p>Haley\u2019s eyes shone as she seriously considered his suggestion. One word, and he\u2019d have gladly left the table and hauled her away.</p><p>\u201cNo. It would be rude to walk out on her performance. She\u2019s doing a beautiful job. We\u2019ll have the soup as an hors d\u2019oeuvre, then the strawberries for dessert,\u201d she promised.</p><p>Crew\u2019s body instantly hardened at her bold words. Where was the shy yet determined woman he\u2019d first met? It seemed she was slowly being replaced by this more confident, alluring female, and he could barely keep his hands off her.</p><p>Though the vocalist\u2019s performance remained flawless, Crew kept glancing at his watch. His overheated body had been pressed against hers for only one night, and now he needed a repeat performance.</p><p>The food came and it helped to get the edge off at least one of his hungers, but did nothing for the insatiable need still tearing at his insides. When the final song ended, Crew clapped loudly, a little for his singer, and a lot because now he could get Haley alone. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d he said urgently; he jumped up and held out a hand.</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you eager!\u201d She smiled and let him assist her from the intimate booth.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t imagine,\u201d he groaned as he began leading her toward the doors.</p><p>\u201cI know you want to get up there immediately, Crew, but I\u2019m so warm right now. Would you mind taking a small stroll outside with me first?\u201d</p> <p>Haley must secretly hate him and want him to expire from sexual frustration, he decided. Yet unable to deny her request, he slapped down the monster clawing to be freed from inside of him, and led her through the lobby and out the back doors, moving quickly to the beach.</p><p>This would be the fastest stroll he\u2019d ever taken \u2014 not that he was a man who normally took strolls. He was either running or sleeping; there didn\u2019t seem to be a middle ground with him.</p><p>\u201cAmari is a beautiful singer. I could listen to her all night,\u201d Haley said. When they reached the edge of the water, she slipped off her shoes and let the waves splash over her toes. He was forced to retreat a step back or ruin his favorite leather loafers.</p><p>\u201cYes, I was lucky to find her before a record label picks her up. It won\u2019t take long \u2014 she\u2019s amazingly talented. I have a contract for eight weeks, though, so this may very well be her last personal gig before she records something and hits it big.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t want to speak about his headliner act. He wanted to talk about the two of them, but he could see that Haley was avoiding the topic for some reason. Alarm bells rang in his mind, and in his groin. If he didn\u2019t take her tonight, he would need to take one heck of a long swim in the cool water currently caressing her feet \u2014 something he\u2019d rather be doing himself.</p> <p>\u201cI grew up less than a hundred miles from the ocean, but still I never made it there until a couple of years ago. How sad is that? I wonder how many people have similar stories to tell. There is just so much beauty in this world, and most of us don\u2019t even see one percent of it. Someday, I\u2019ll travel the entire world and look in the most ancient of museums and touch as many of the Wonders of the World \u2014 ancient, medieval and modern \u2014 as I can. I am feeling a need to roam now, thinking I may just leave school for a while and travel...\u201d</p><p>Her dreamy sigh told him she would do that, but he didn\u2019t want her to leave without him. When people\u2019s dreams were big enough and their will strong enough, they could make anything happen. He\u2019d seen it countless times before. It was when people gave up that their life dwindled to nothing. What was the point of existing in this world if you didn\u2019t really live your life to its fullest potential?</p><p>To hell with the distance between them. Crew threw off his shoes and socks in seconds and stepped in the water with her. The bottom of his custom slacks were instantly soaked, but he didn\u2019t care.</p><p>Maybe a part of her was trying to keep him at a distance, but he didn\u2019t want that and if she was honest, she didn\u2019t want it either. She was just protecting herself, reverting to her old habits. He could feel her withdrawal in the melancholy mood she was in. He didn\u2019t know what had brought it on, but he was determined to find out, and refused to allow her to slip away.</p><p>\u201cNothing is as beautiful as you, and I can guarantee you that anywhere you want to go can happen,\u201d he said, his hand coming up to caress her cheek. Though it might sound a bit cheesy \u2014 par for the course that evening \u2014 he truly felt those words as he looked into her eyes.</p><p>She took his breath away far more than any sunset ever had, than any of the Wonders he\u2019d been lucky enough to visit. She was a vision, and she was his for now.</p> <p>Crew waited, his fingers rubbing her delicate skin, but he wanted her to choose the kiss, he wanted her to be in control. She needed that, and then he wouldn\u2019t feel the guilt of knowing he\u2019d coerced her into it. He needed her to choose him.</p><p>Yes, he could seduce her \u2014 easily. But, he wanted more than the night before, more than tonight. He wanted to be with her without thought of an end in sight.</p><p>Slowly, she relented; her hands reached into his hair and she pulled his mouth to hers, her tongue demanding entrance. Just having him hold her was enough to lift the unseen burden she was carrying on her shoulders. She knew he was strong enough to carry it for her if only she could bring herself to let him.</p><p>He nearly lost his balance in the gently lapping ocean waves as his raw hunger awakened with a vicious groan. Fire licked at his gut, and no matter how she touched him, he hungered for more, his body demanding her total compliance.</p><p>Letting her lead him for a few more moments, Crew knew his control wouldn\u2019t last much longer, so he began walking them backward out of the cool water.</p><p>\u201cCome to my room.\u201d She was ready \u2014 so was he. He didn\u2019t want to start their lovemaking in the sand. He hadn\u2019t cleared it with his staff to leave them alone, and it would kill him to be interrupted once he started. He was too damned hungry for her.</p><p>She didn\u2019t speak, but the slight nod of her head was better than love songs to his ears. Grasping her hand, he led her back up the beach and through the French doors, making a beeline for the elevator.</p><p>He looked straight ahead, unwilling to risk even eye contact with anyone. This time, he didn\u2019t care if the place caught fire. He wasn\u2019t going to be called away from her side.</p> <p>Doing something he hadn\u2019t done once in the last two years, Crew pulled out his cell phone as they entered the elevator and pushed the power button. He felt total victory as the small picture on the screen disappeared and his main means of contact with his staff was terminated.</p><p>A small lamp was burning in his room, just enough light so they wouldn\u2019t bump into the furniture, but not enough to ruin the moment. Hesitating long enough only to unplug the resort phone, too, he backed her toward his bedroom.</p><p>Her body shook as he pushed her gently but firmly, causing her to land with a satisfying bounce on his soft comforter. Tonight was going to be so much more magical than her first time. He now knew how innocent she was, so he would take his time and make her think of no other man but him ever again. He would end any and all thoughts she had of leaving him behind.</p><p>Chapter Nineteen</p><p>Haley so wanted to cover herself, but she resisted the urge as she lay naked before him. Crew obviously desired her \u2014 there was no hiding that he\u2019d been ready to take her the moment they touched \u2014 and they couldn\u2019t make love while all her clothes were on. But the supreme self-consciousness she\u2019d lived with for so many years didn\u2019t disappear overnight. He didn\u2019t give her time to dwell on it, though.</p><p>She sighed in pleasure as Crew\u2019s hands slid across her torso, skimming over her waist, then moving higher and gliding across the sides of her breasts. He used just his fingertips to excite her skin, making her heart pound and her breathing grow ragged. He knew how to give pleasure, and luckily, she was the sole focus of his desire.</p><p>Accepting that this was where she wanted to be, this was where she\u2019d always longed to be, took away the burden of guilt that her grandparents had instilled in her. She\u2019d never truly known pleasure before lying in Crew\u2019s arms, and she feared she\u2019d never know it again once this affair ran cold.</p><p>Chasing away these negative thoughts, she embraced the woman within her and greedily took everything he was willing to give as his mouth began trailing across her jaw, just grazing the edges of her lips as his sweet breath warmed her face. It was both torment and pleasure, and she was already beginning to fly.</p><p>When his tongue began lazily stroking the edges of her lips, she tried to pull him to her, tried to fuse their mouths together, needing the torment to end, but he had other ideas. He was obviously in no hurry.</p><p>Considering the pace at which they were moving, they\u2019d probably still be making love when the early morning sun rose high in the sky. Oh, well. There could be worse things. Relaxing into the gentle caress he offered, she tightened when he began nibbling her bottom lip, applying gentle pressure as he threw his shirt off, then lay across her body.</p><p>\u201cSex is all about the touch, taste and smell. Trust me,\u201d he said.</p><p>She found her hands raised above her head and then felt that she couldn\u2019t move them. What was this? She struggled against his makeshift bonds as her eyes opened.</p><p>\u201cCrew?\u201d she whimpered.</p><p>\u201cTell me to stop if at any moment you\u2019re not feeling pleasure,\u201d he said and kissed each of her eyelids before slipping his tie across her eyes and making the room go dark.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I like this,\u201d she whispered as his hand trailed between her breasts and down the flat of her stomach.</p><p>\u201cDo you want me to stop?\u201d</p><p>When Haley said nothing, he continued to speak. \u201cI didn\u2019t think so. This is your next lesson \u2014 on touch. If you want a man to desire you, then you need to know what you like, Haley. You need to tune out the world around you and focus only on your body and your needs,\u201d he said before his mouth captured her taut nipple and sucked it deep within.</p><p>\u201cDo you like this?\u201d he asked as he paused before moving to her other breast and giving her other peaked nipple equal attention.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she sighed as her back arched.</p><p>\u201cAnd, this?\u201d he asked as he moved lower to skim over her stomach with his mouth.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Moaning as his hands slid up her thighs, she spread them wide.</p><p>\u201cTell me what you like.\u201d</p><p>She paused, feeling her face grow warm. How could she do that? She didn\u2019t know what she liked \u2014 she just knew that everywhere he touched sent fire through her veins.</p><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t tell me what you like, don\u2019t tell me how to touch you, then I won\u2019t know. Remember to feel the pleasure, think about where it begins and branches out. Think about what will drive you over the edge.\u201d</p><p>His seductive words were mesmerizing her, and her muscles went slack as his hands slid up and down her thighs, making flames of heat shoot through every inch of her body.</p><p>When Crew\u2019s mouth moved back up her torso, she was frustrated and disappointed that he hadn\u2019t continued south and given her the pleasure he had the last time. She couldn\u2019t tell him that, though, could she?</p><p>As his lips brushed across hers, teasing them into opening, she gratefully took his tongue inside her mouth, entwining it with her own. Burning need raged deep with her, and she now knew that he was right \u2014 being blind and unable to move her hands electrified her other senses, made them spring to life with new vigor and intensity.</p><p>Focusing on every touch of his hands, body and mouth made her tremble in his arms as she eagerly awaited his next move.</p><p>\u201cWhere do you want me to touch you?\u201d he asked as he moved over, now pressing the warmth of his chest against her side and swirling his tongue around her ear.</p><p>\u201cEverywhere,\u201d she gasped.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not good enough, Haley. Tell me where you burn, where you want me to relieve the ache,\u201d he whispered into her ear, causing tremors to race through her.</p><p>After a pause, she threw away her embarrassment. \u201cMy breasts,\u201d she gasped, her nipples hard and aching, elongating as her body arched beautifully toward him, needing his soothing tongue to quench the burning. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He swiftly obliged, his tongue laving one nipple until it glistened, then the next, before latching onto each of them in turn. He circled his tongue over her pink areola, then gently nipped the hardened peak, before repeating on the other side. It relieved the ache there, but made her stomach tremble with need.</p><p>He didn\u2019t move, forcing her to try to twist in his arms. If she\u2019d had her hands free, she would have pushed his head down, moved him where she now needed his mouth so desperately. Knowing that he wouldn\u2019t go elsewhere until she asked him filled her with frustration, and yet power, too. She was in control here with nothing but her words.</p><p>\u201cLower,\u201d she gasped as he sucked her nipple harder.</p><p>Crew obliged, running his tongue along her stomach, trailing light kisses up and down her torso and sides. He traced every inch of her skin there, stoking her heat to white hot, making need layer on top of need until she felt she would explode.</p> <p>\u201cLower,\u201d she called breathlessly, and he moved to her thighs, his tongue slipping along the inside of her legs, licking the sensitive skin just outside her core. He sucked on her quivering flesh, but he still wouldn\u2019t give her what she truly wanted.</p><p>The throbbing inside her seemed to be taking on a life of its own. Could she possibly blow up if he didn\u2019t relieve the ever-mounting pressure? She was certain that could happen. If a boiler built up this much steam without someone pulling the valve and letting it release, there would be a giant crater in the ground. She just had to do something, say something, now.</p><p>\u201cLick me, Crew, please,\u201d she begged. His tongue ran along her thighs. \u201cNo! Take my heat; make me come in your mouth!\u201d she demanded, tossing her head from side to side.</p><p>\u201cOh, my...\u201d she screamed when his lips clamped down on her swollen core. The textured tip of his tongue ran in circles around her moist flesh, and she felt the buildup of pressure go into the red zone.</p><p>\u201cYes, Crew, yes!\u201d she praised. This was the spot. This was where she wanted, needed his masterful technique now.</p> <p>With a few more exquisite passes from his tongue, Haley exploded into a paradise all her own. There was no gentle falling. This was a detonation of light and sound, of pure adrenaline almost to the point of pain, a wonderful, mind-blowing pain. Never had she imagined feeling such intensity.</p><p>She shook as his hand moved below her, gripping her quivering backside as he ran his tongue across her flexing skin a couple of times more. When he released her, she melted into the bed, her eyes rolling into the back of her head behind the silk tie still secured there.</p><p>When she felt his hands at her arms, she jumped, her flesh feeling like one big erogenous zone. She couldn\u2019t possibly do anything else.</p><p>All of a sudden, she was free. Her arms fell limp to the bed, and she felt his gentle fingers rubbing over them, making the blood run through their length. Next, the tie came off and she squinted at him in the dim light as she forced her eyes open.</p><p>\u201cThat was magnificent,\u201d she told him and smiled lazily into his strained face.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s about to reach a whole new level, Haley. I\u2019ve only begun.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOoh,\u201d she said in a whoosh of breath. The thought of more should have terrified her, but a stirring began in the pit of her stomach, where her body still trembled from the powerful release he\u2019d just given her.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want now?\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widened. She was still in control, able to demand anything she wanted from him. As she looked down his perfect body, she knew she wanted only one thing.</p><p>\u201cYou. Deep inside me.\u201d</p><p>Crew seemed to speak another language his words were so inarticulate before he immediately sheathed himself and then lay on top of her. Thinking he would slam inside without preliminaries, she tensed, waiting for the initial pain again.</p><p>When he lubricated her moistness with the tip of his erection and slowly inched in, she felt herself relax, enjoying the stretching of her skin, as inch by beautiful inch he filled her.</p><p>\u201cDeeper,\u201d she called, \u201cfaster.\u201d She was done with slow and steady. As her stomach tensed with a renewed need, she wanted speed and friction \u2014 she wanted the burning release she\u2019d received only from him.</p><p>\u201cLike this...?\u201d he asked seductively as he pushed forward, burying himself deep inside her.</p> <p>\u201cYes, Crew. Always like this, always! Take me,\u201d she demanded as her legs wrapped around him. She didn\u2019t know who she was anymore, but his presence was giving life to an insatiable monster, a man-eater, even, and she hoped the creature never retreated.</p><p>\u201cOpen your eyes, Haley. I want to see the pleasure explode in them when I slam against your body.\u201d</p><p>She did as he asked, looking deep inside his eyes as he began moving his hips, bringing her closer and closer to the peak again. She could do this night and day and still it wouldn\u2019t make up for the years she\u2019d lost without it.</p><p>How could she somehow experience something so magical and then never do it again? She didn\u2019t think she could ever let him leave the bed after this night.</p><p>Sounds of pleasure and slick coupling filled the air, heightening her craving for more. Her mind had only one thought \u2014 how to find the way to another delicious orgasm. As he tightened against her and called out her name, she fell with him, lost in an abyss of darkness, her body turned to liquid and sated to the fullest.</p><p>As he pulled from her, she turned, snuggling down deep, deciding she\u2019d never leave the safe softness of his bed again.</p><p>His hand stroked along her side, and Haley smiled, loving his touch, completely content in this perfect moment.</p><p>\u201cRound three, beautiful. We\u2019re not done yet,\u201d he whispered, making goose bumps appear on her skin.</p><p>He had to be kidding. She was spent. Yes, she\u2019d just told herself that she never wanted this to stop, but surely there were limits to human sensation. There was no possible way she could do that all over again. Her nervous system just couldn\u2019t take it.</p><p>Haley ignored his words, but as Crew continued to stroke her skin, unbelievably, her body awakened again, and she found herself turning toward him.</p><p>It was a couple of hours more before, despite a touch of soreness, she found the sweet pleasure of oblivion. Her last thought before she descended into sleep was that the pain was well worth that incredible night of lovemaking.</p><p>Chapter Twenty</p><p>Waking up with the morning sun streaming through Crew\u2019s window, Haley stretched her arms and connected with the firm muscles of Crew\u2019s naked chest.</p><p>Deliciousness.</p><p>For just a moment, she practically purred, but reality quickly dropped down with a thud. She didn\u2019t know the rules of a game such as this. Was she supposed to slip quietly out the door? When she\u2019d slept over before, he\u2019d woken her up and had her out the door so fast, she didn\u2019t have time to think about any of those things.</p><p>Crew Storm could have any woman he wanted, and he had many of them figuratively notched on his impressive bedpost. She knew she was a novelty item, the virgin who\u2019d asked him to be her teacher. Thinking back, she\u2019d been quite na\u00efve and unaware of what she\u2019d been asking.</p><p>Teach her he had, though. She could feel confidence flowing through her. Though it wouldn\u2019t be easy, or even possible, to be an entirely new person, at least she felt attractive, and she knew she didn\u2019t belong in a corner. The problem was that she wanted to belong by his side.</p><p>Should she play it cool? Act as if this were no big deal? He was well aware that it wasn\u2019t something she did all the time, but he seemed to prefer confident socialites \u2014 that\u2019s what she\u2019d read, anyway \u2014 so should she try and mold herself into one of them to stay at his side a while longer?</p><p>No.</p><p>Even if that was what he wanted, she couldn\u2019t pretend to be one of those shallow women. She was just Haley Sutherland, a girl who\u2019d missed out on life while the rest of the world continued spinning rapidly around her. I am what I am.</p><p>Just as she was deciding it was time to get up and sneak off to her room and wait for his next move, his arm snaked out and pulled her tightly against his side.</p><p>\u201cGood morning, my little siren. I hope you slept well,\u201d he mumbled against her neck, making all sorts of tingles dance in her stomach.</p><p>\u201cVery well, thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could use a large cup of coffee, and a gigantic breakfast. I feel like I ran a marathon,\u201d he said with a laugh.</p><p>His positive mood was a good thing. She\u2019d just take her cue from him.</p><p>\u201cThe coffee sounds wonderful, but I need a hot shower first,\u201d she said as she stretched her legs out and felt the soreness in her thighs. Feeling it made a grin spread across her face. She\u2019d take her workouts beneath him any day over on top of a treadmill.</p><p>\u201cScratch what I said before. I\u2019ll join you \u2014 coffee can wait.\u201d His mouth was doing wicked things to her body, but she couldn\u2019t go there again so soon. Maybe after a day of rest...</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019ll take the shower alone for the sake of my sore...muscles,\u201d she replied, giggling.</p><p>\u201cAh, you have no imagination,\u201d he said with a wolfish grin, but his grasp loosened as he sat up in bed, then gently gripped her beneath the arms to help her up, slinging one of his arms around her back so she was still snuggled against him.</p><p>The feel of his hand massaging her back had her melting into him. His touch could turn her on fire, or soothe away her fears. A very talented man.</p><p>Her heart suffered a sudden pang of alarm while he held her in his arms. Many times she\u2019d see lovers embracing in a park, or cozying up together at the movies. She\u2019d envied their obvious ease in each other\u2019s company. Now that she was getting a taste of it, she feared having to give it up.</p><p>Idly, her fingers stroked along his chest, memorizing the map of his toned muscles. She could sit like this the rest of the day and feel that there was no better thing to do in the world. Who needed to get up and work when they had a strong man to hold them in his arms all day, instead?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m loving just holding you, Haley, but my body has other ideas. I don\u2019t know how, but it does. If you don\u2019t run away to the shower soon, I can\u2019t be held responsible for my actions,\u201d he warned with a playful nip on her shoulder.</p><p>The heck with being sore. It was worth it to have him pressed against her. As if he could read her thoughts, he gently shifted her away and rose from the bed with a pained but resolute expression across his beautiful features.</p><p>As he turned, her eyes were glued to his magnificent backside while he walked toward his discarded clothes and bent over. The muscles flexing in his legs were a sight to behold. She\u2019d never been interested in painting, but as the early morning sun streamed down on his rock-hard body, she suddenly had a desire for a paintbrush and canvas. Perfection such as his should be recorded for all time.</p><p>Inspiration hit when she saw her new cell phone on the nightstand. With a quick lunge, she snatched it up and focused on his bare behind, then snapped a couple of shots. He turned incredulous eyes on her when he heard the click.</p><p>\u201cAll right, woman, get your shower. I\u2019ll have breakfast waiting when you come out,\u201d he said, glaring at her small black device before coming back over and giving her a lingering kiss. A low growl escaped his throat, but he turned and walked from the room. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Haley savored the moment, closing her eyes, leaning her head back, and inhaling deeply. She allowed herself to just soak it all in and think of nothing other than the fast rhythmic tempo of her heart. He was a heartbreaker \u2014 she had no doubt about that \u2014 but she was just too satisfied, too relaxed to care about that right now.</p><p>Finally getting up, she showered quickly, eager for that cup of coffee. Finding his oversized robe, she wrapped it around her body, then followed her nose to the smell of rich brewed espresso.</p><p>Crew was sitting at the table reading the paper while he sipped on a steaming mug, and she joined him, preparing her cup before grabbing a warm cinnamon roll and taking a bite, sighing as the fresh cinnamon, sugar and melted butter dripped on her tongue.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s move your things in,\u201d he said, not looking up from his newspaper.</p> <p>Haley\u2019s eyes bolted up, her bite turning to sawdust in her mouth. Was he speaking to her?</p><p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d she managed to mumble after a strained pause.</p><p>\u201cI want you to move out of your room and come stay with me,\u201d he replied as he put the paper down, his eyes gazing steadily back at her.</p><p>How did she reply to this? She hadn\u2019t known him long enough to stay in his suite. That was insane, wasn\u2019t it?</p><p>\u201cI, ah, don\u2019t think that would be wise,\u201d she replied, automatically lifting her cup and taking a fortifying sip of her coffee, hoping the caffeine would clear the cobwebs from her brain.</p> <p>\u201cI plan on spending every night with you anyway, so wouldn\u2019t it be much easier to just have your items here? This is a resort, Haley. It\u2019s not like I\u2019m asking you to give up your house,\u201d he said as if he were making the most logical statement ever.</p><p>\u201cWell, I just like to have my space,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>He paused for a moment, looking at her quizzically. \u201cWhere do you live, anyway?\u201d</p><p>It was a perfectly rational question, but she\u2019d seem pathetic if she told him the truth. Dread filled her that he might realize she was indeed pitiful, and then end what they had barely even started.</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter. I think we\u2019re fine the way we are. So, any good articles in your paper?\u201d Maybe she could sidetrack him with a change of subject.</p><p>Her ploy didn\u2019t work.</p> <p>\u201cCome on, Haley. Give me something,\u201d he said, then leaned across the table and grasped her free hand. She took another sip of coffee, scalding her tongue slightly.</p><p>\u201cI live in Seattle in an apartment,\u201d she murmured, her voice barely above a whisper.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not so bad. Why are you hesitant to tell me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I just don\u2019t like to give out too much information about myself. I guess it\u2019s from the years of having to be self-reliant. It\u2019s difficult for me to share...\u201d she trailed off.</p><p>Crew looked at her strangely, just as she\u2019d expected him to. She was hard to understand. Heck, she couldn\u2019t really understand herself. How was she supposed to explain it to him?</p><p>\u201cDid you have any other family you could turn to? I know your grandparents should have been drawn and quartered for the way they treated you, but was there anyone else in your life at all?\u201d</p><p>This was a subject that Haley absolutely hated speaking about. No. She hadn\u2019t had anyone in her life but the servants at her grandparents\u2019 place, and even those relationships had faltered over the years. She hated dwelling on how alone she truly was. She\u2019d fantasized about being part of a large, loving family, but had given up on that dream years before. She didn\u2019t want him to fully comprehend how messed up her life was. This sharing of her past and present wasn\u2019t what she\u2019d signed on for.</p><p>\u201cI had some rough years with my grandparents, as you know. I have fought against all the doubts they instilled in me since I got away from that \u2018home,\u2019 but I tend to psych myself out about it all too often. Going to school has really helped, but at the end of the day when I look in the mirror, I still see this person whom nobody wanted. I promise it\u2019s getting better, but I\u2019ve just had to do whatever it takes to make it day by day. If I think too far ahead, I get overwhelmed, and that\u2019s when I find myself start sinking within myself.\u201d She held her breath, waiting for him to roll his eyes and give up on her. She was too crazy for a man like Crew, who had it all together.</p> <p>Now he was going to know she was too much effort, and she\u2019d never get the privilege of sleeping in his arms again. The thought was horribly depressing.</p><p>Crew\u2019s gaze didn\u2019t shift as he brought his cup up and took a sip.</p><p>\u201cAll the more reason for you to move in with me. You need to have someone take care of you. We\u2019ll go pack your things after breakfast.\u201d Treating the matter as closed, he set down the mug, picked his paper back up and started reading again.</p><p>Haley ran her hands through her hair and stared at the back of his newspaper. Was he the one who was insane? Why wasn\u2019t he trying to delve deeper, get into her head, or just send her packing? If she knew she wasn\u2019t completely together, why couldn\u2019t he see it?</p><p>Yet wasn\u2019t she overanalyzing this, and trying to seek out serpents in her temporary paradise? It wasn\u2019t as if she couldn\u2019t just move back out again when their relationship, or whatever this was called, ran its course. He hadn\u2019t mentioned anything about her two-week vacation. Did he want her to stay longer? Doubtful.</p><p>It might be best to avoid reminding him that she was only here because she\u2019d won a raffle. If she brought that up right now, he might snap out of this spell he seemed to be under and tell her that he\u2019d personally pack her bags and get her to the airport to send her off. The thought of leaving him in a couple of days turned her stomach inside out.</p><p>With a sigh, she looked at her breakfast, the once delicious cinnamon roll now turning her stomach. There seemed no need to respond to Crew anymore, since he\u2019d already made up his mind, and to tell the truth, she wanted to sleep by his side each night. At least for a while, she could pretend this was a normal relationship, and that this incredible man cherished her. A little fantasy would help her sleep on those nights when loneliness was eating her alive.</p><p>Making up her mind, she pushed away her plate and took small sips from her cup while she tried to convince herself that it was OK to seek enjoyment from life. It was OK to not worry about what tomorrow would bring. She\u2019d see this through to the natural end, and she\u2019d grow as a person. That was all she could ask of herself and Crew.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-One</p><p>A few days later, Haley felt obliged to tell Crew that her time was up. Her train ticket was for the next day, and though she didn\u2019t want to leave, she needed to get back to the real world. She\u2019d always believed that the word heartache was a metaphor, but there was no denying the physical pain in her chest as she stood in the bathroom and practiced her goodbye speech.</p><p>Would he ever think of her again? In time, would she get over him? She and Crew had been together only two weeks, but they were two glorious weeks, and she knew she\u2019d never be the same.</p><p>That was all thanks to him, and to his wonderful lessons. Her gloom didn\u2019t prevent a contented grin from spreading across her features when she thought of the magic he\u2019d created within her. She now knew it wasn\u2019t a sin to enjoy sex; it wasn\u2019t a crime to feel like a woman.</p><p>Her grandparents had been so wrong in so many ways, and she wished they were still alive so she could confront them with their cruelty. Was it always wrong to think ill of the dead? They\u2019d tried their hardest to destroy her, and they\u2019d almost succeeded, so she didn\u2019t think so in this case. As long as she didn\u2019t descend into anger and bitterness, they wouldn\u2019t control her from beyond the grave.</p><p>It was amazing how much could change within a person in such a short amount of time. She knew she had a long way to go before she\u2019d be the person she wanted to be, but because of Crew, she was much closer than she\u2019d ever been.</p><p>Taking a soothing breath, she gripped the doorknob and emerged from the warm bathroom. She could hear the crinkling of the paper as Crew turned the page. After closing her eyes for a moment to imprint everything to her memory, she moved forward.</p><p>No matter what, she wouldn\u2019t cry. Why make him feel guilty about her pain? Everything he\u2019d ever done was meant to help her feel better about herself.</p><p>He mumbled a good morning as she sat and poured herself a cup of coffee, and grabbed a chocolate croissant. With the churning in her stomach, she doubted she\u2019d be able to eat, but it was such a habit now to sit at this small table while he read the paper and she nibbled on the goodies before her while downing a couple of cups of espresso.</p><p>\u201cI was thinking of playing hooky today, Haley, and taking you out to see the Catalina Island Conservancy so you can see the bison. You told me last week that you wanted to do some exploring.\u201d</p><p>Crew set down the paper to focus all of his attention on her. Normally, he finished reading first, then gave her his undivided attention. On the morning she had to tell him goodbye, his extra attention hurt even more. Could the man get any more perfect? Was he really as flawless as she\u2019d made him in her mind, or was she just placing him on a pedestal?</p><p>There was no need to drag this out, so she plastered a fake smile on her face. \u201cI really need to pack today. My train leaves early tomorrow,\u201d she said, proud she\u2019d been able to say the words without trembling.</p><p>Crew froze and his face lost all expression; his eyes bored into hers. After a few moments, he finally set his cup down.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want you to leave.\u201d It was simple and to the point and her heart began to swell in joy...but wait. Maybe he\u2019s just saying that.</p><p>\u201cI know, Crew. I\u2019m having a wonderful time here, too, but the package I won was for only two weeks, and my time is up...\u201d she said, her voice starting to crack just the slightest bit.</p><p>\u201cScrew the contest. Are you happy being here with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I am,\u201d she replied with exasperation. It wasn\u2019t about her happiness; it was about her time being up.</p><p>\u201cDo you have a job to get back to?\u201d She shook her head no. She\u2019d quit to come on this trip.</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you on break from school right now?\u201d Again, he was correct, so she nodded.</p><p>\u201cBut, Crew \u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t see any reason for you to leave. I want you to stay. You want to be here, and you have no obligations calling you back to Seattle right now. Let\u2019s cancel your return and go see the bison.\u201d</p><p>She wanted that so badly, but...</p><p>\u201cLook, Haley. Let\u2019s not make this complicated, OK? We like each other. It\u2019s still new and exciting, and I\u2019m not asking you for forever, here. I\u2019m asking you to give me a chance. Let\u2019s have fun together, light the sheets on fire, and not throw this out the window just because of semantics.\u201d</p><p>He rose from his chair and came around to her, kneeling in front of her and caressing her thighs. She couldn\u2019t think when he touched her like this. She knew she should protest, just a little, but she\u2019d suddenly forgotten why. And she wanted to be with him, wanted to feel his touch, sleep in his bed, hear his words of encouragement. She wanted to continue having the feelings of love and affection she felt while in his arms \u2014 whether hot and heavy in the bedroom or just cuddling on the beach. Was she asking for too much? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Really, what would it hurt for her to stay another week or two? It wouldn\u2019t alter her life in the least. It may even make her that much stronger in the end.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know...\u201d she hedged, trying not to be rash.</p><p>As if he\u2019d already won, Crew smiled before standing up and pulling her into his arms. \u201cLet me convince you, then,\u201d he said as he lifted her up and carried her toward the bedroom.</p><p>\u201cI need to think, Crew,\u201d she whispered as he set her on the bed.</p> <p>\u201cNo you don\u2019t. Obviously you get poor ideas in your head when you try to reason out what the right choice is. Let me remind you of why you can\u2019t leave,\u201d he replied as he parted her robe and began nibbling on her neck.</p><p>\u201cOhh,\u201d she moaned, trying to focus but quickly losing the battle. The man did crazy things to her crazier mind, and that was fine by her.</p><p>As he began moving his head down her body, she gave up any ideas of going \u201chome.\u201d Her heart was right here \u2014 at least for the moment.</p><p>They didn\u2019t make it out to see the bison...</p><p>Haley kept checking the calendar, counting the days, and shaking her head in disbelief. August had hit and she was still with Crew.</p> <p>Marlin had told her that Crew was choosy about his women, that the scandals about him in the papers were made-up lies. Still, even Aunt Mae was surprised by the length of time that she and Crew had been together. He wasn\u2019t known for long relationships. Should Haley still be afraid? He\u2019d said nothing of a more permanent relationship, but he also didn\u2019t seem in the least bit of a hurry for her to go. She had to make a decision about whether to get back to the real world or not, though. School started in a month. She needed to choose that or travel...</p><p>Most mind-boggling of all was that he continued his lessons with her. She found small trinkets on the nightstand, flowers on the bathroom counter, her favorite coffee waiting for her when she woke up after he\u2019d had to rush out and miss their breakfast together.</p><p>The greatest present she\u2019d received had been the day he\u2019d taken her on his private boat to a secluded beach on the island. They\u2019d had a picnic, and he presented her with a map he\u2019d had made, then walked with her as she went on a treasure hunt.</p><p>At the end of the hunt, she\u2019d found an antique chest, and inside had been a beautiful old journal, antique sterling silver cup and hankie from the eighteen-hundreds. She\u2019d treasure those items forever. Already, she\u2019d spent countless hours poring over the words of the journal, tears falling as she read about the heartbreak of the woman writing in it when she\u2019d lost her infant child.</p><p>In this new age, it was hard to imagine that common ailments that we simply shrug off today could lead to death back then. Still, even though it broke her heart to read the words of this brave woman, she couldn\u2019t put the gift down, knowing she\u2019d treasure it forever.</p><p>Twice, Crew had had to leave for a couple of days, and when he came back, he hadn\u2019t been empty-handed, bringing her a glorious string of sapphires and gold that she refused to take off, and an anklet that was their own personal joke.</p> <p>He told her that if it had been the days of old, he\u2019d have had her chained to his bed, where he could feast upon her day or night. She replied that she would be an open buffet for him any time he liked, no chains required. Still, each time she looked at the little lock on her ankle, she felt herself grow warm as she imagined what new adventure he\u2019d take her on that night.</p><p>The sex was otherworldly. Sometimes it was hot and passionate, with clothing shredded and flying in their passionate frenzy to fuse with each other. At other times, it was slow and sweet. He\u2019d lick her all over while his hands caressed her heated skin. No matter how they made love, the crashing conclusion was always the same \u2014 explosions and fireworks and an afterglow that bonded her closer to him.</p><p>But it couldn\u2019t last. Haley knew that good things never did. Once a servant of her grandparents had given her a Pound Purrie, an adoptable \u201cdown on her luck\u201d kitty found in a charity thrift shop. She\u2019d loved that ratty, stained stuffed animal with all her starved soul. Then one day it just disappeared. OK, Crew couldn\u2019t be likened to her grandparents. He was kind and attentive, but he was simply too wonderful, too good for her. The other shoe was poised to drop. After all, the Catalina Couture Resort was for sale, and there was a very interested buyer.</p><p>But she had to be grateful. \u201cTake this day as if it\u2019s your last, Haley. Live, love, laugh,\u201d she told her reflection in the mirror. To live truly happy for even a short time was so much better than to walk through life as an empty shell.</p><p>There was no time to dwell on the future. She didn\u2019t know what it would hold. All she knew for sure was that for today she was a happy person \u2014 carefree and with a terrific man. Well, she would be carefree and happy if she\u2019d quit stressing over every little thing for ten seconds.</p><p>Crew had business meetings all day long, so she planned to go shopping. The island wasn\u2019t a place for good bargains \u2014 for that, you needed to go to the mainland \u2014 but laziness was seeping through her bones. She\u2019d stroll the beaches and check out some of the gift shops here on the island, part of a private tour to take it all in before she moved back home.</p><p>One thing she knew for sure was that her life was forever changed. She wouldn\u2019t hide in the corner anymore, and she wouldn\u2019t be afraid to go after what she wanted. Once she\u2019d left Catalina Island behind, she would move forward, finish her degree and go on that dig someday. She wasn\u2019t going to give up on herself ever again. Hey, maybe she\u2019d even get a cute little house, or a nice apartment with access to a swimming pool.</p><p>Wherever she ended up, she was going to be a grown-up and make adult decisions. There was no need to keep being fearful she was this person her grandparents had convinced her she was \u2014 an abomination that no one wanted.</p> <p>Now that she\u2019d had a small taste of security and love, she wanted it on a more permanent basis. Her grandparents\u2019 taunts were a thing of the past; she wouldn\u2019t let those people haunt her from the grave.</p><p>Leaving the room with a smile on her face, and a future filled with endless opportunities, Haley pushed aside her fears of no tomorrow with Crew as she entered the lobby, then decided to go out the back door and walk to town by way of the beach. The breeze was a bit warm, but the waves were calling to her.</p><p>Stepping onto the patio, she looked to the right and froze. Crew was standing in the center of a group of people with big smiles on their faces as a petite redhead had her arms wrapped tightly around him.</p><p>With Haley\u2019s jaw gaping open, she watched as the woman kissed him loudly on the cheek and then told him how much she\u2019d missed him and civilized life. With a burst of laughter, Crew lifted her from the ground and spun her in a circle.</p><p>After the initial shock, fire ran through Haley\u2019s veins, and she fought the urge to rush forward and rip the girl\u2019s hair out. How dare he humiliate her like this! No, she and Crew were not committed, there were no promises of forever, but he could have at least had the decency to end it with her before moving on to his next conquest.</p><p>She\u2019d certainly been giving him enough sex to appease ten men, and yet he\u2019d still felt a need to cheat on her. She wanted to destroy both of them, then kick him so hard he\u2019d never be able to please another woman.</p><p>Before she could screech and act on her impulse, she took a fortifying breath and thought back to all the lessons he\u2019d taught her on how to be more confident, how to make a man desire her so much, he couldn\u2019t see straight.</p><p>Squaring her shoulders, she strode into the small alcove, watching as Crew\u2019s eyes lifted and met hers. The jerk didn\u2019t even have the decency to look ashamed that he\u2019d been so blatantly caught out.</p><p>\u201cI see your morning meetings are going well. It seems you\u2019ve even made your next major acquisition,\u201d she spat. She was trying to control her voice, but the venom running wild in her blood seeped through her words.</p><p>His smile fell away, replaced by a look of surprise. The cheating creep hadn\u2019t even removed his arm from around that little bimbo\u2019s waist. Was he really that cruel?</p><p>\u201cI know we never talked about being exclusive, but I figured if you can sleep in the same bed with me all night, the least you could do is stay away from harlots during the day.\u201d Haley shook with mounting frustration; tears welled up in her eyes.</p><p>Trying to calm herself and keep her cool, she took a few deep breaths. He wasn\u2019t worth her tears.</p><p>When his mouth lifted and a sparkle entered his eyes, she saw red and lifted her hand to smack the grin from his face. He easily caught her and pulled her against his side, finally releasing the woman beside him. And the little winch also happened to be smiling. How punishing could these people be?</p><p>Toast. They were toast.</p><p>\u201cHaley, I\u2019d like you to meet my sister, Brielle.\u201d</p><p>It took several heartbeats for Crew\u2019s words to sink in, and once they did, Haley\u2019s face flamed. Now he would know for sure how crazy she was. She couldn\u2019t even look in the chuckling woman\u2019s eyes. She\u2019d just called his sister a whore. Who did that?</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nice to meet you, Haley. Don\u2019t worry about it; I know what a rake my brother can be. You have every right to assume the worst, though I will tell you, he was just gushing about you five seconds before you walked up in all your terrifying glory.\u201d Brielle stuck out her hand.</p><p>Suddenly unable to speak, Haley met Brielle\u2019s outstretched hand and shook it, feeling like a fool. It was Crew\u2019s fault \u2014 she just couldn\u2019t quite figure out how. Never before had she wished for a natural disaster, but she was praying for a hurricane to appear instantly and carry her off deep into the sea. Or a boiler could blow up...</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d she finally mumbled when her wish wasn\u2019t granted and the sky remained clear.</p><p>\u201cMy father wanted to surprise me by showing up out of the blue. Last time we chatted, he just said he was coming sometime. I figured he\u2019d give me notice, but he likes to pop up unannounced. This is my dad, Richard,\u201d he introduced.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a pleasure to meet you, Ms. Sutherland. As Brielle told you, Crew was speaking highly about you moments before you appeared. I hope you will be joining us this evening for dinner so we can get to know you better.\u201d The twinkle in his eyes looked familiar, but Haley couldn\u2019t trust anything she was seeing right now. She could barely meet the man\u2019s eyes, let alone try to figure out why he looked like someone she\u2019d met before.</p><p>Haley would rather be dropped off a cliff than spend time with the people she\u2019d just insulted, but she nodded and smiled, trying furiously to think of any excuse to go running back into the resort. She\u2019d bury herself under a mound of blankets and inhale a gallon of ice cream.</p><p>\u201cExcellent. Our family has much to talk about and much to celebrate,\u201d Richard said, taking her nod for affirmation, and then looking back at his son.</p><p>Haley spoke a bit too brightly. \u201cThat\u2019s wonderful. I really have to be getting back inside. I\u2019ll let you all catch up,\u201d she said, tugging against Crew, ready to make her escape.</p><p>\u201cMmm, I like this jealous streak. Maybe you can punish me later,\u201d he whispered in her ear, making her cheeks heat all over again. \u201cToo bad the anklet doesn\u2019t fit me.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>How could he say that in front of his family? Even if they couldn\u2019t hear, she was terrified they knew exactly what he was whispering in her ear.</p><p>Without another word, she managed to untangle herself from Crew\u2019s arms, and she fled inside.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t coming out again for another ten years. Maybe her blush would have faded by then. She doubted it, but miracles did come true sometimes.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-Two</p> <p>It wasn\u2019t often that Crew didn\u2019t have a word to say, but this was too much for him. How could it be possible? Things like this happened only in fiction, not in real life.</p><p>\u201cI understand your shock, son,\u201d Richard said. \u201cI couldn\u2019t believe it myself, but it is true. Signed, sealed, delivered, and scientifically verified. I didn\u2019t want to give you news like this over the telephone, and I certainly didn\u2019t want to tell you until I knew it was fact. We\u2019ve already spoken to Ashton, Tanner and Lance. Brielle was the stop right before we came here. She insisted on joining us.\u201d</p><p>Still, Crew sat there and stared at these men, these near duplicates of his father \u2014 his uncles. As the oldest child, Crew had always wanted more family when he was younger, cousins to play with, tell secrets to, and run amok with. Now that he was a grown man, he was finding out they\u2019d been there all along, on the other side of the USA.</p><p>His family had taken vacations in California, had been through Seattle. He could have sat next to his cousins at a table, and never known. It was all so overwhelming.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re taking it about as well as my oldest boy, Lucas, did,\u201d Joseph said. The booming sound of his voice finally snapped Crew out of his shock.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry I\u2019m being so disrespectful. I...it\u2019s just a lot to take in,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>\u201cWell, of course it is, boy. It\u2019s not every day you find out you have aunts and uncles, and a heck of a lot of cousins. We\u2019ve planned a family gathering so you can meet. They will love you all as if you\u2019ve known each other since day one. Family means everything to George and me. Plus, it\u2019s been a real privilege for us to meet our brother, Richard. We want to know our new niece and nephews.\u201d</p><p>The way this larger-than-life man instantly accepted a new family as his own was humbling. How many years had Crew taken family for granted? How many times had he gone off and not once thought of calling his siblings? It had been only after his father\u2019s ultimatum that he\u2019d pulled himself together \u2014 finally seeing what he had to lose.</p><p>Not the money. Sure, at first, that had been the worst of it, but when he and his siblings had sat down to plot against their old man, something else had happened. They\u2019d bonded again \u2014 a bond that had been stretched thin over the years, but never broken. Now, they spoke at least once a week. They knew what was happening in each other\u2019s lives. They were a family again, leaning on each other for moral support during the difficult undertaking of transforming troubled businesses.</p><p>Now, they had even more family, and Crew wanted to meet them all.</p><p>\u201cWhen is the soonest we can do this?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI want everyone there for Thanksgiving. It\u2019s my favorite holiday because that\u2019s when I get to look around an abundant table and count my blessings. I hope you\u2019ll plan on it,\u201d Joseph replied.</p><p>\u201cYes, of course,\u201d Crew responded.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s an extra setting for your spitfire girlfriend, too,\u201d Joseph said, sending Richard a wink.</p><p>Crew looked incredulously from Joseph to his father and then burst out laughing. Despite being apart their entire lives, the men were more alike than seemed possible. Was matchmaking in the family genes? Next Joseph would be yammering on about grandbabies... No. Not likely. No one could be as bad as his dad was when it came to pushiness for the next generation to be born.</p><p>\u201cI will consider that,\u201d he said, refusing to satisfy the old meddlers\u2019 obvious curiosity. Let them sweat. Yes, he was in love with Haley, but she was still frightened. He was waiting for the right moment to tell her she was never escaping him. She could run and she could hide, but he would never let her get away.</p><p>\u201cStubborn. That\u2019s definitely Anderson blood,\u201d George grumbled.</p><p>Crew sat back smugly, pulled out a cigar and lit it.</p><p>\u201cWell, don\u2019t be selfish there, boy. Offer your uncles one, too,\u201d Joseph bellowed. With a laugh Crew handed over cigars to all three men.</p> <p>\u201cDisgusting habit,\u201d Brielle said as she moved her chair away from the smoke.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know what you\u2019re missing out on, Brielle. These are magnificent, came to me all the way from Colombia.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m done with this testosterone-filled room. I think I\u2019ll find your girlfriend, Crew, and see what dirt I can get on you. I have a few stories to tell her, too.\u201d</p><p>Crew considered trying to stop her, but knew he\u2019d be wasting his time or worse. His sister was a force of nature, and when she went after something, it was dangerous to stand in her way.</p><p>Instead, he sat back and whipped his head to and fro, listening to the three brothers bantering together as if they\u2019d never spent a day apart. His father wouldn\u2019t be lonely ever again.</p><p>Brielle took her time exploring her brother\u2019s resort. She couldn\u2019t deny feeling a bit of jealousy that his project was a luxury hotel, while she was stuck on a ranch.</p><p>Then she smiled, for there was nothing at all to pout about. She wouldn\u2019t trade places with Crew if she could. She\u2019d never admit that ranch life was suiting her, but her incredibly hot neighbor was certainly a plus in keeping her in the wilds of Montana.</p><p>She\u2019d let her neighbor come milk her...cows anytime!</p><p>As she passed the bar, a curious sound caught her attention. Inching the door open, she slipped inside the dimly lit room, then stood by the back wall as she watched Haley in the corner of the room with her long fingers stroking the keys of the piano.</p><p>The poor woman was doing a terrible job of playing, but the man behind the bar didn\u2019t seem to mind in the least. When he spotted Brielle, he walked over.</p><p>\u201cSorry, we aren\u2019t open for another two hours,\u201d he said kindly as he motioned for the door.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here to see Haley,\u201d Brielle said.</p><p>The man\u2019s eyes narrowed protectively, which had Brielle\u2019s curiosity piqued. Who was this woman who had the men in her life so ready to spring to her defense? Brielle was determined to figure it out.</p><p>\u201cWhat business do you have with Ms. Sutherland?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI promise you it\u2019s nothing bad. Let me introduce myself before you call for the bouncers. My name\u2019s Brielle Storm \u2014 Crew\u2019s baby sister.\u201d She stuck out her hand, and after a moment\u2019s pause, the man\u2019s shoulders relaxed.</p><p>\u201cMarlin. It\u2019s good to meet you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have a last name, Marlin?\u201d Brielle asked with a low chuckle.</p><p>\u201cYeah, but I don\u2019t like it. Just call me Marlin. I\u2019ll leave you ladies for a few minutes. I have to run to the back anyway to let the guys know what to bring out.\u201d With that, the man slipped out the door. Haley hadn\u2019t noticed their exchange as she continued to fumble with the chords on the piano.</p><p>The girl had also decided to sing, and Brielle didn\u2019t know which was worse, the piano playing, or her singing. She wouldn\u2019t be winning a Grammy anytime soon, though she certainly was enthusiastic.</p><p>Now it was time to get to the bottom of what was going on between her and Crew. From the steam flying between Haley and her brother, Brielle strongly suspected she was more than just a girlfriend. Was this woman worthy of her brother? A feeling deep in her gut told her yes.</p><p>\u201cI hope I\u2019m not interrupting you,\u201d Brielle said as she came out of the shadows. Haley hit the keys with a jolt, thus ending her \u201csong\u201d with an impressive array of discordant notes. Brielle could see Haley had been hoping her hiding spot would hold, but when Brielle wanted something, nothing would stop her, and right now she wanted to find out who Haley was and exactly what she stood for.</p><p>\u201cNo. Of course not. I\u2019m not really supposed to be in here, but the bar\u2019s closed right now. Marlin lets me sneak in because I enjoy playing around on the piano, though I\u2019m obviously terrible at it. I took a class in college on music appreciation and picked up the basics. The instructor, who played beautifully, taught me a few simple songs.\u201d Haley neglected to mention the impressive piano in her grandparents\u2019 house \u2014 after all, she\u2019d been forbidden to touch it while they were alive.</p><p>\u201cI know \u2018Frosty the Snowman,\u2019 and \u2018Silent Night.\u2019 My father always insists on Christmas carols around the piano, so each of us were required to learn a couple of songs,\u201d Brielle said with a hopeful grin. She sat down on the bench beside Haley and started plunking out \u201cFrosty\u201d since Haley was too shocked to play right then.</p><p>\u201cWhat are the songs Crew knows?\u201d Haley asked, her eyes wide and mouth agape.</p><p>\u201c\u2018The Drummer Boy\u2019 and \u2018Friendly Beasts.\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love both of those songs. I\u2019ll have to see if he\u2019ll play them for me,\u201d she said with excitement and delight.</p><p>\u201cWell, if you\u2019re planning on coming for Christmas, you\u2019ll hear him,\u201d Brielle said slyly and watched Haley\u2019s reaction.</p><p>There was hope in the girl\u2019s face, true hope that she would still be with Crew at Christmas. The worry in Brielle\u2019s chest evaporated when she saw how smitten this woman was.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s several months away,\u201d Haley said, gathering herself together quickly and looking down at the keys.</p><p>\u201cWell, I wanted to seek you out to make sure you\u2019ll be there for dinner tonight. I want you to know that I thought you were great not letting Crew get away with anything. If I had been some floozy instead of his sister, you probably would have clawed my eyes out.\u201d</p><p>Reddening, Haley glanced over at Brielle, then plunked a few keys with Brielle in a terrible rendition of \u201cSilent Night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know why I got so upset,\u201d she murmured. \u201cIt\u2019s not like we\u2019ve ever said this is something official. We\u2019ve only been together a couple of months now...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you got so upset because you like my brother \u2014 as hard as that is to believe \u2014 and maybe even love him.\u201d</p><p>Haley now blanched, and Brielle knew without a doubt that she\u2019d just met her future sister-in-law. She and Crew were crazy about each other. Now, they just had to admit it, and Brielle would have her first sister-in-law.</p><p>\u201cI...uh...don\u2019t love him,\u201d Haley said. \u201cIt\u2019s complicated, but he\u2019s been helping me with some stuff. Men like Crew marry debutantes or Ivy League girls. They may date women like me, but they marry ladies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>Haley\u2019s pain-filled words tore at Brielle\u2019s heart.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not exactly in the same class as Crew \u2014 as you. I\u2019m not too stupid to realize that. I enjoy him, and he\u2019s been wonderful to me, but this is a summer thing, nothing more. We\u2019re just having fun,\u201d she trailed off.</p><p>Brielle studied her, wanting to know this woman\u2019s secrets, wanting to know what had happened in her life that had filled her with so much insecurity. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Guilt consumed her as she thought back to all those years she\u2019d been nothing but a rotten little brat. She\u2019d taken everything she\u2019d been given for granted \u2014 the best education, the best clothes, a new car for her sixteenth birthday, everything she\u2019d ever wanted. How shallow she\u2019d been. What a waste of life.</p><p>Here was a woman who\u2019d obviously had so much less, yet she was proud and strong and doing it on her own. Brielle had a feeling the two of them would be close friends, and she herself would be the one to gain by the friendship.</p><p>\u201cHaley, you should know that love doesn\u2019t care about your rank in life. It doesn\u2019t care where you went to school, or if you can play the piano. Love is magical and honest and it will find you whether you want it to or not. Don\u2019t give up on yourself, because it\u2019s pretty obvious to me that my brother thinks you\u2019re about the classiest girl out there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...uh...\u201d Haley couldn\u2019t speak.</p> <p>\u201cI adore my brother. He and my other three brothers always spoiled me rotten \u2014 quite rotten, I\u2019m afraid, but that\u2019s a story for another time. I just wanted to meet the woman he\u2019s obviously fallen in love with.\u201d</p><p>Brielle beamed to see Haley\u2019s mouth drop open. If nothing else, she\u2019d gotten the wheels in Haley\u2019s head spinning. Sometimes men were big buffoons who just didn\u2019t know how to express themselves, and women had to take matters into their own hands. In fact, she knew of one particular man in Montana who could benefit from hearing her thoughts.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t keep you any longer, Haley, but I really do hope to see you tonight at dinner. It\u2019s been a real pleasure speaking with you.\u201d With that, Brielle got up and left the flustered woman alone. Haley had a lot to think about, and Brielle was hoping for a winter wedding.</p><p>There was nothing like snow-covered ground when two people joined their lives together. The new bride and groom were literally forging a new path for themselves from the moment they stepped from the warmth of the church and made their way home \u2014 their footprints marking their progress in the pure white snow.</p><p>Yes, despite a few bumps in her own road, Brielle was a romantic. It was grand to be herself again and even grander to have her family back, all close-knit and full of love.</p> <p>Smiling giddily to herself as she made her way toward her room, she didn\u2019t even notice the men stopping in their tracks to gaze at her. She knew she was attractive \u2014 she wasn\u2019t stupid \u2014but she had no idea of the full power she possessed.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-Three</p><p>OK, she was in love. Hopelessly, irrevocably and forever in love. Haley\u2019s heart glowed with warmth as she watched the three men sip on their scotch and fill the room with cigar smoke and raucous laughter. They were a riot and she couldn\u2019t get enough of them.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s four of a kind. I win!\u201d Haley pulled the pile of Skittles candies toward herself. She\u2019d more or less cleaned them out.</p><p>\u201cI think you\u2019ve been cheating, young lady,\u201d Joseph said with a mock pout as he put down his lowly two pair.</p><p>\u201cYou, my kind sir, are being a poor loser,\u201d she taunted.</p> <p>\u201cIf only I wasn\u2019t so in love with my Katherine, I\u2019d fight my new nephew for your affections.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could fight Katherine for you,\u201d Haley said with a wink, loving the soft pink glow in his cheeks.</p><p>\u201cAh, young lady, you do know how to make an old man feel young.\u201d He leaned over and kissed her cheek.</p><p>The men had been at the resort for a week, and she sought them out regularly when Crew was busy running his resort. The potential buyers were there, and they\u2019d made an official offer. It looked as if her time in paradise was nearly at its end.</p><p>She would miss this place beyond expression, but at least she\u2019d have amazing memories to take home with her. The steamy nights with Crew, and this precious week with his father and his new uncles. It was as if she was getting a taste of what a normal family was like and oh how she longed for such.</p><p>What a story, a beautiful story \u2014 triplets reunited after more than sixty years. And a few days was all it had taken for them to bond. Haley was delighted that both Joseph and George were happily married men, and she simply didn\u2019t understand how Crew\u2019s father could be single.</p><p>Richard was suave and adventurous, and had a devilish attitude. She could certainly see where Crew had inherited not only his good looks, but also his casual but polished manners. She was in over her head with this Anderson/Storm family.</p><p>And when she didn\u2019t get to see any of them anymore...?</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve always said a woman who can gamble is a force to be reckoned with. We are leaving in two days, but I expect you to come and visit us, young lady,\u201d George said as he looked her in the eye.</p><p>Haley didn\u2019t want to ruin the mood.</p><p>\u201cI think you only want to earn back your candy. You keep trying, but you just can\u2019t beat me,\u201d she joked as she lifted a few brightly colored pieces and slid them into her mouth.</p><p>\u201cYou quit trying to change the subject,\u201d Joseph pointedly replied, not fooled by her tactics. \u201cYou\u2019ve yet to tell me you\u2019ll be there for Thanksgiving. It\u2019s only a couple months away and I like a lot of pretty ladies sitting around my table.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will come if I can,\u201d she said without elaboration. She so wanted to say she\u2019d be there, but she had to remember that this wasn\u2019t her family. She was simply borrowing them for a very short time.</p><p>\u201cYes, Haley, I want you to be there, as well. You have brought a sparkle to my ornery son\u2019s eyes that I haven\u2019t seen in years. You\u2019re good for him,\u201d Richard said. He was the quietest of the three brothers, but that didn\u2019t dim his power in the least.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because I give him so much trouble. Now, if you want to run away with me, we can find a deserted island and hide away forever,\u201d she added with a wink, making Richard blush.</p><p>\u201cOh, if I were thirty years younger, I\u2019d throw you over my shoulder and take you to paradise any time,\u201d he said with a laugh; Joseph and George joined in.</p><p>\u201cThis one\u2019s taken, Dad,\u201d Crew said, surprising Haley with his quiet approach. She peered up at his smiling features.</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t mean I can\u2019t duel you for her,\u201d Richard told his son.</p><p>\u201cI would be sure to lose to such a smooth man,\u201d Crew said before lifting Haley from her chair and seizing her mouth with his so swiftly that she didn\u2019t have time even to think about protesting.</p><p>As his lips covered hers, she forgot about her three favorite men and melted into her lover\u2019s arms. Losing all sense of time or place, she just held on for the ride as he made her body soar.</p><p>\u201cNow, that\u2019s a kiss,\u201d Richard said with a chuckle. Haley plummeted back to solid ground. It was her turn to blush as Crew slowly released her.</p><p>\u201cI hate to take Haley away, but I have plans that don\u2019t involve three meddlesome men,\u201d Crew said as he clasped her hand. Haley tried to pull back, uneasy at the wicked gleam in his eye.</p><p>\u201cThatta boy. You give this girl some good romance. And don\u2019t you dare let her go. I didn\u2019t raise a fool for a son,\u201d Richard said.</p><p>Joseph emphatically agreed. \u201cA good woman is not something to treat lightly. You hold on tight and pray she never lets you go. I\u2019ve been with my Katherine for over forty years now, and not a day goes by that I\u2019m not grateful to have found her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I\u2019ve been blessed by having two great loves in my life. The last ten years with Esther have been a blessing, and I don\u2019t know what I\u2019d do without her,\u201d George added.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d give anything to have a woman to hold my heart close to hers. I haven\u2019t given up,\u201d Richard added with sadness.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you worry, Brother! We\u2019ll find you a bride,\u201d Joseph said with excitement.</p><p>\u201cOh, no you won\u2019t, Joseph. If love finds me, then it does, but I don\u2019t need my brothers meddling in my life,\u201d Richard said with a glare.</p><p>\u201cYou three argue about it. I\u2019ll see you tonight.\u201d With that, Crew picked Haley up in his arms and left the room. The sound of the men whistling followed them to the door.</p><p>Crew\u2019s he-man act embarrassed her, but she melted against him. The strength of his arms as they flexed beneath her back, the feel of his tight abs pressing against her side, and the look of hunger in his eyes had her breath trapped in her throat.</p><p>\u201cYou are in quite the mood, aren\u2019t you?\u201d she teased as he rounded a corridor behind the bar and headed to his office.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve missed you,\u201d he answered simply.</p><p>Her heart warmed at the thought.</p><p>\u201cI like spending time with your dad and uncles. They are stubborn and ornery and I love every minute of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love being with them, too, but right now I\u2019m going to love being with you,\u201d he said as he walked through his office door, quickly shutting it and latching it behind him.</p><p>After he put her down on his desk, his mouth quickly seized hers, and she forgot all about scotch, poker, and amusing old threes of a kind. Hunger washed through her as Crew unbuttoned her blouse, exposing her lace bra within seconds.</p><p>\u201cWell, why didn\u2019t you just say so?\u201d she gasped as his mouth moved down her throat, and then sucked a hardening nipple through the delicate lace. She leaned back and cried out in pleasure.</p><p>He was moving quickly, and Haley wouldn\u2019t have had it, or him, any other way. She wanted him to take her fast and hard, make her scream in pleasure again and again.</p><p>His hand found her front clasp and released her breasts so he could stroke them, tease them, and make her stomach ripple with need.</p><p>Running his arm across the surface of the desk, he flung everything there to the floor, then lay her down, unbuttoning her skirt and yanking it and her panties free, leaving her bare before him.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t ever get over how breathtaking you are. I look upon you and wonder how I ever got to be the lucky one who gets to bury myself deep within your heat, kiss every delicate piece of your skin, and then hold you all night while you dream of tomorrow,\u201d he whispered, his eyes slowly moving across her body.</p><p>Oh, my gosh, the man knew what to say. She was a quivering mess as he ran his hands up her thighs and pushed them apart, leaving her wide open for his hungry gaze.</p><p>Suddenly his mouth descended, and she did indeed cry out when he fastened on to her swollen womanhood and turned her heat into an inferno. Lying back on her elbows, she called out his name as he stroked her flames higher, bringing her to the brink of pleasure before...stopping.</p><p>\u201cKiss me,\u201d he demanded as he moved up her body, his clothing gone. When on earth had that happened? She didn\u2019t know.</p><p>Instead of plundering her mouth as he\u2019d done earlier \u2014 which she happened to like, a lot \u2014he hovered over her, lightly brushing his lips across hers as his hands framed her face. The sweet moment brought tears to her eyes.</p><p>Heat and passion she could take, and take, and take. This loving, slow exploration of her mouth and mind dropped her to her knees. Trying not to shout her love for him, she deepened the kiss, knowing he was close to losing all control.</p><p>\u201cI need you, Haley. I always need you,\u201d he said as he aligned their bodies together. As he rested the thick head of his erection against her for just a moment, their eyes connected, and they were one. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She was his for the taking, and she wouldn\u2019t let go until the moment he forced her to.</p><p>Flames ripped through her again as he slowly sank deep within her folds, and then pounded against her flesh, rocking her closer and closer to the edge of pure pleasure. She felt the muscles in his back flexing as he pushed inside her, and she sucked in his moans of desire as their tongues twined together.</p><p>The faster and harder he thrust against her, the louder she cried out. More. Always more. She couldn\u2019t get enough of him.</p><p>Just before she came apart, Crew lifted his mouth and looked deep into her eyes. \u201cMine, Haley. You are mine. Today. Tomorrow. The day after. I won\u2019t let you go.\u201d</p> <p>She tried to refuse his words, tried to not let them plant within her heart, but as they shattered together, she felt her tears threatening to spill. Yes. She wanted to be his forever.</p><p>But wasn\u2019t that what people said in the heat of passion? They felt emotions on a much deeper level, but those emotions burned out swiftly. Still, she allowed herself to cherish a tiny hope of forever as he wrapped her in his arms and carried her to his oversized chair in the corner, holding her as she pulled herself together.</p><p>Maybe she wouldn\u2019t have to let him go. Maybe her today would last an eternity.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-Four</p><p>\u201cWhat are you so afraid of, Haley?\u201d</p> <p>Grabbing her shirt and covering herself, she turned away as she searched for her panties. Where were the stupid things? There was no way she would leave this office without them and risk the embarrassment of having a resort maid suck them up into her vacuum.</p><p>It had been bad enough when they\u2019d been caught making out in the sauna like a couple of teenagers. She\u2019d been utterly mortified. Crew, darn him, had just sat back with a big grin on his face while his poor employee had run from the room with excuses and a flushed face. But really, why was she thinking of that incident now?</p><p>Probably because she was afraid to face the conversation he was attempting to have. If she opened up to him only to be let down, she would be hurt, just as she always was. He had a family he could lean on \u2014 she had nobody. Why couldn\u2019t he understand that?</p><p>Even knowing all along it wasn\u2019t smart to do anything with him other than take him on as a teacher, she\u2019d still managed to let her heart get involved. So now she was scrambling to build up some sort of defense against the inevitable pain.</p><p>He was selling the resort, probably in a matter of days, and after the sale closed, he\u2019d move on to his next big adventure and she\u2019d be by herself again. She used to deal with that just fine, but that was before meeting Crew.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not afraid of anything, Crew. I like the way things are with us, and I don\u2019t see why you keep pushing me,\u201d she finally said when he blocked the door.</p> <p>\u201cWhat is wrong with admitting that we\u2019re good together?\u201d His face was earnest, but she\u2019d shared so much already. What would he think if he knew the depth of her feelings? He was the man out for a good time \u2014 not a happily-ever-after.</p><p>\u201cWe are good together. I don\u2019t deny that,\u201d she said, giving him something so he\u2019d hopefully let the subject drop. She tried to make her tone light, but her soaring stress levels weren\u2019t making it easy.</p><p>\u201cI love being with you, Haley,\u201d he told her as he grabbed her from behind and slid his hand around her waist, his fingers spanning across the flat of her stomach as he pulled her back against his chest. The way his thumb rested just below her breast had her body heating up again.</p><p>This was unbelievable torture. She needed some time to think \u2014 to pull herself together, and to try to figure out what all of this meant.</p><p>\u201cAnd I love being with you, too, Crew. I do, honestly. I just don\u2019t think we should try and put a label on what we have. We\u2019re both in an unstable point in our lives and this is supposed to be fun and carefree. You\u2019re my teacher, remember?\u201d she said with an attempt at humor.</p><p>It fell flat.</p><p>\u201cDo you want poems and chocolates?\u201d he asked, sincerely perplexed. \u201cI\u2019m not being sarcastic, Haley. I need to know.\u201d</p><p>The genuine confusion in his voice almost melted her. He was so good to her, anticipating her needs, caring about how she felt, and making her body sing for him. If only she could hold on to him forever.</p> <p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t every woman?\u201d she laughed as she turned in his arms and slid her lips across his in slow motion.</p><p>\u201cDone. I\u2019ll clear out the candy shop and have a poet flown in tonight.\u201d</p><p>She wished she knew whether he was kidding or not.</p><p>\u201cHow about you just surprise me with a large Dove Bar and we don\u2019t stalk writers,\u201d she replied while his hands slid down her back. Then he took hold of her head and turned her gentle caress of the lips into a full-scaled attack on her mouth. It looked as if she\u2019d done a good job of distracting him; she didn\u2019t know, however, whether to be happy at her success.</p><p>When his phone rang just then, Haley felt a mixture of relief and frustration. Her body had just begun to warm up again, but she was glad that she could escape this awkward conversation.</p><p>\u201cYou take your call, and I\u2019ll go for a swim,\u201d Haley told him. Fire was just starting to flare in his eyes, so she retreated several feet, to keep temptation from winning her over.</p><p>She\u2019d made it to the door before his voice stopped her. \u201cHaley.\u201d He paused while she turned. \u201cThis conversation is far from over.\u201d</p><p>As she left the office, she felt fear battle with hope. The hope was more terrifying. If she let herself think of a real future with him, she\u2019d be swimming without a life jacket in the middle of a stormy ocean, and it would probably be easier to just give in and let the water drag her under.</p><p>With a shake of her head, she suppressed her confused tears and made her way to their suite to change. A good swim and workout would put her mind back on track. That was all she needed, she convinced herself.</p><p>Crew got off the phone, and then rested his head in his hands. He knew and understood her fears of the future, but he\u2019d hoped she\u2019d have a bit more trust in him by now. He would give her a week or two to work through her emotions, and then he\u2019d pounce.</p><p>Haley had changed his life for the better; he couldn\u2019t possibly let her go now. Did everyone have a one perfect mate out there somewhere? He only knew that without her, his life would be emptier.</p><p>The two of them could have a good life together. Her insecurity still held her back, but over the last couple of months, he\u2019d watched as she\u2019d come alive, opened up and faced so many of the demons that littered her past.</p><p>One by one, she was slaying her dragons, and he vowed to be there fighting by her side.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-Five</p><p>Crew ended up giving Haley a break for only a day. He\u2019d planned to give her more time, but he had news, and he couldn\u2019t wait to tell her.</p><p>His lawyers and those hired by the buyers had pushed through the paperwork, and he needed to let Haley know that at the end of the month it was time to move on. He hoped she wouldn\u2019t mind going off with him to a new location. Though she had her schooling to finish, she was taking this semester off, and he\u2019d find her the best school possible. What was important to her was important to him, too.</p><p>Crew had decided that his next business venture was going to be in Oregon. There was a great resort on the beaches of Tillamook, and he wanted to restore it. He\u2019d be closer to his newfound family and get to know the cousins he\u2019d never met.</p><p>Haley should love it there. The weather was almost identical to that in Seattle, plus she\u2019d still be on the beach, he reasoned.</p><p>This kind of news required a candlelit dinner with at least a few dozen roses, and a lot of chocolate. Women, he\u2019d theorized, were a lot more likely to listen if they had good chocolate in their hands. Haley had certainly proved that often.</p><p>A flashback to one night when they\u2019d experimented with chocolate syrup and whipped cream flooded his memory, and Crew lost his train of thought. Dammit. Shaking his head, he got back to work. There was a lot to plan, and it needed to be just right.</p><p>\u201cMr. Storm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMr. Storm.\u201d</p><p>Crew turned to find the Stanther twins wobbling toward him. The two old ladies were in their eighties and full of life, though doubtless a bit slower than they\u2019d been in years gone by.</p><p>They must have been true beauties in their day. Knowledge and laughter glowed in their eyes, and he\u2019d delighted in having them at the resort for the past week. He rarely became attached to guests, but he\u2019d made an exception with the two spitfires.</p><p>\u201cHow can I help you beautiful ladies?\u201d he said as he gave each woman a kiss on the hand.</p><p>\u201cOh, you\u2019re such a charmer. If I had the energy that I used to,\u201d Bertha Stanther said, \u201cI\u2019d drag you up to my nice big suite with me. It\u2019s just too bad age has caught up to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, age has made you only more striking,\u201d he said with a wink.</p><p>The two ladies giggled, and soft blushes stole over their cheeks. Penelope now spoke: \u201cWe just wanted to say goodbye. Our grandnephew is picking us up today and taking us back home. We\u2019ve so enjoyed our time with you, Mr. Storm. I do hope to see you again in a couple of months.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSadly, I won\u2019t be here, ladies. But when I get my next resort up and running, you have a free week on me,\u201d he promised, handing them each his personal business card.</p><p>\u201cOoh, we\u2019ll certainly take you up on that. A free vacation sounds divine,\u201d Bertha said. The women were dripping in jewels and had more money than they\u2019d ever need to spend, but they\u2019d been through hard times in their lives, and pinched pennies where it counted. He was honored to give them a week vacation at his cost.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d better come, because I will miss you both. How about a kiss?\u201d He leaned down so each of them could give him a pink-lipstick-stained kiss on his cheek.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll see you soon, Mr. Storm,\u201d they called out as they turned to walk toward the nicely dressed young man who gave each of them a hug and began asking how their trip had been. Crew hoped to see them again. He really had enjoyed their sense of humor and positive attitudes. Neither of them was letting age stop them from enjoying life, and he hoped he was just the same when he hit his eighties.</p><p>After watching the sisters safely escorted away, Crew turned to hunt down his father and uncles. His family was leaving the next day and, though he hated to confess it, the ease with which they\u2019d snuck into Haley\u2019s heart made him the slightest bit jealous.</p><p>Every moment she could find, she was with the three old men, and she and his sister had really hit it off, even teaming up with some of his staff to cause chaos for him.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t be angry, though, because Haley had no family, no friends \u2014 no one. That was before he\u2019d entered her life, of course; now she\u2019d never be alone again.</p><p>Each day he was with her, he fell further in love. The deepest desire of his heart was to hold on tight and never let her go. And, yes, he would miss the meddling old men once they departed, but he had a feeling Haley would miss them even more.</p><p>Crew was hardly surprised to find the three of them sitting at the bar, visiting with his favorite bartender, with whom they\u2019d hit it off quickly. Not a shocker, since both they and Marlin swore by fine booze and expensive cigars. Crew had decided already to offer Marlin a job package too good to refuse if he came to the next resort with him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cLast I checked, this was a place of business,\u201d Crew said, trying to sound gruff, but not pulling it off.</p><p>\u201cOh, quit your bellowing and join us for a smoke,\u201d his father said as he scooted his chair over a bit so Crew could sit down. At this time in the afternoon, there were few patrons, and Crew had a chance to relax.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t mind if I do,\u201d he said accepting a cigar from his Uncle Joseph and lighting up. Leaning back in the chair, he noticed that all eyes were on him. The men were looking at him as if they\u2019d weighed him and found him wanting.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d he finally asked, not normally self-conscious, but struggling not to squirm under the heat of their stern gazes.</p> <p>\u201cWe were just discussing you, boy, and wondering what the heck is wrong with you that you haven\u2019t asked Haley to be your bride.\u201d</p><p>Leave it to his father to come right to the point.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t see how that\u2019s any of your business. That goes for all of you.\u201d Crew pointedly looked each of them in the eye, giving Marlin an extra look for good measure. But the man didn\u2019t back down an inch \u2014 was Crew losing his touch?</p><p>\u201cWell, of course it\u2019s our business. We\u2019re family and want to make sure you\u2019re OK,\u201d Joseph bellowed, blowing a thick plume of smoke from his mouth.</p><p>Crew had known of the man\u2019s existence for only a couple of weeks and yet Joseph was already comfortable in his role as uncle. To Crew\u2019s great surprise, he found he didn\u2019t mind at all. He felt as if he\u2019d known Joseph and George his entire life, and he was grateful to be a part of their family now.</p> <p>\u201cNot that I should admit this to any of you, but I won\u2019t be letting Haley slip through my fingers. I may have made some stupid decisions in my younger years, but when you get your hands on a woman that good, you certainly don\u2019t let her get away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd besides, it\u2019s about time I had grandkids...\u201d Richard trailed off as Crew\u2019s words registered in his ears. A huge smile broke out on his face as he looked at his eldest son.</p><p>Crew had never been a pathological people pleaser, but he felt a swell of pride at the slight sheen of tears in his dad\u2019s eyes.</p><p>\u201cUh...well...that\u2019s very good, Crew. I\u2019m mighty proud of you,\u201d Richard finally said as he clapped his boy on the back.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you proud about, Dad?\u201d Brielle asked as she joined them, plopping down in a chair and grabbing Crew\u2019s cigar, much to his dismay.</p><p>\u201cI thought you hated these,\u201d he snapped as he tried to grab it back.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m trying to broaden my horizons,\u201d she said and she took in a puff, then doubled over as the smoke clogged her lungs.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not supposed to inhale, darling niece; just taste the sweet smoke on your tongue.\u201d George patted her back and offered her some water.</p><p>\u201cThanks for the warning,\u201d she gagged with a glare at Crew.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t give me a chance,\u201d he responded with a smirk as he took his cigar back. That would show her to take one of his.</p><p>\u201cOK. OK. You got me. So what are you so proud about?\u201d she asked again.</p><p>\u201cCrew\u2019s getting married,\u201d Joseph piped in.</p><p>Crew looked around in a panic. \u201cShh. I haven\u2019t talked to Haley about any of this, and no one said anything about marriage. I just said I wasn\u2019t going to let her go,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d better not plan on just shacking up with the girl. She\u2019s a lady and deserves a ring on her finger,\u201d George admonished him.</p> <p>\u201cYou guys are so nosy,\u201d Crew growled as he stood and smashed out his cigar in the ashtray. He\u2019d best find Haley before the old men gave away his game plan. He would bet his fortune none of them could keep a secret. Why he\u2019d said anything, he didn\u2019t know.</p><p>\u201cWell, we wouldn\u2019t have to be if you weren\u2019t such a blasted fool,\u201d Richard called out.</p><p>Crew didn\u2019t bother responding as their laughter followed him from the room. It was a good thing Marlin had kept quiet; otherwise, he might have canned him on the spot.</p><p>He wouldn\u2019t have, of course, but it was a nice thought, anyway.</p><p>With a determined stride, Crew headed to his room. It was time to give Haley the romance she wanted. He had big plans for them, and the tighter he weaved his net, the more likely he\u2019d be able to keep her stuck in it forever.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-Six</p><p>Several hours later Crew found Haley reading a book out back by one of the fire pits. He loved the way her face lit up when she came to a good part in a story, and the different ways her tears would fall during joyous and sorrowful scenes.</p><p>He didn\u2019t even need to pick up the book. He could read it through her expressions alone. If only she were as easy to read when they talked. She had grown very good at masking her emotions in front of him.</p><p>He hoped by the end of the night she\u2019d trust him enough never to do that again.</p><p>\u201cGood evening, beautiful,\u201d he said as he sat next to her and nuzzled her neck.</p><p>\u201cHi, Crew. Sorry I haven\u2019t come up yet. I lost track of time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t too hard to find you. Are you ready?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. I\u2019m getting sleepy.\u201d</p><p>Helping her stand, he wrapped his arm around her and began leading her toward the elevators.</p><p>\u201cDid you have a good day?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. I went golfing for the first time in my life. It\u2019s a good thing your father and uncles are so patient; I was afraid they might throw me into one of the water traps. I\u2019m terrible at it,\u201d she told him with a laugh. \u201cCorrection. I\u2019m very good at finding the water traps.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll tell you a little secret. I\u2019m terrible, too.\u201d</p><p>He could see she didn\u2019t believe him.</p><p>\u201cYou know those old men are crazy about you. I thought there for a while that I might have to fight my father for you. He\u2019s pretty infatuated.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I love them, Crew. They are all so funny and kind. Whenever I dreamed of having a father, I imagined him being the perfect mixture of all three of them. They may bark pretty loudly, but they all have hearts of gold, and are really just big softies,\u201d she said with a sigh.</p><p>Crew was grateful she loved his family so much. Now that he\u2019d found his way back home again, he could never settle down with a woman who didn\u2019t think family was just as important as their relationship. They went hand in hand.</p><p>If you had family, Crew believed, but no one by your side to love, you were only half a person. It went both ways, though. If you had true love, but no family to come home, too, you were still only half a person. To feel the full effect of a happily-ever-after, you needed your true love and your family to keep you standing strong. They were the ones who\u2019d hold your hand in a storm, fall to their knees with you when the rest of the world let you down \u2014 they were everything that made you a whole person.</p><p>Poor Haley had gone so many years without that special bond. And though he\u2019d had it all along, for years he\u2019d taken for granted those who mattered most. At least it wasn\u2019t too late for either of them.</p><p>They reached the room, and he slowly opened the door and ushered her inside. She stopped in her tracks.</p><p>Crew was proud of himself. Since he wanted to uproot her life, he\u2019d gone all out to make this night special, do it the correct way. Nothing but scented candles lit the room; they cast dancing shadows on the wall and released the sweet scent of jasmine in the air.</p><p>A table was set in the middle of the room with silver and crystal and the finest bottle of champagne he could get his hands on. A menu of cold salad, lobster fettuccine and chocolate mousse was ready to be served when they were, and overflowing vases of flowers sat on the two end tables. A few roses lay across her plate.</p><p>\u201cWhat is the occasion?\u201d she asked in a whisper. She looked up at him with gleaming eyes.</p><p>Yes, he\u2019d done well, he thought as he pulled her close.</p><p>\u201cEvery day I\u2019m with you is an occasion to celebrate,\u201d he told her, surprised by how much he meant the words.</p><p>\u201cCrew, you make me melt,\u201d she said as she kissed him in appreciation.</p><p>Before he got lost in her touch, he led her to the table, where he picked up one of the delicate flutes and poured a glass of the sparkling wine.</p><p>\u201cTo yesterday, today, and tomorrow. May each and every day we face be as magical as this very moment,\u201d he offered as a toast, and she clinked her glass against his.</p><p>He held out her chair and had her sit, then moved around to the other side of the table so he could relish her every expression and gesture. When he watched her pick up her fork with her long, slender fingers and begin to nibble on her salad with her luscious mouth and tiny white teeth, moaning her approval, his body had no choice but to tighten.</p><p>He had to remind himself again that there was a purpose to this night. Yes, he planned on getting her into bed afterward, but he needed her to accept his offer to move with him. He refused to leave the island without her.</p><p>Feeling the inside of his pocket, where a small velvet box rested against his heart, he couldn\u2019t believe he was working up a sweat. Why on earth was he so nervous?</p><p>Because, for once in his life he was going into something to which he didn\u2019t know the outcome. He normally never gambled on anything; he was all about guaranteed wins. With Haley, although he felt that she loved him, what if he were simply seeing what he so desperately wanted to see?</p><p>She spoke of her fears, but Crew found himself the one now afraid \u2014 afraid of losing her. It was unthinkable.</p><p>\u201cThe resort has sold,\u201d he told her. \u201cThe papers were signed today and the new owners will take over at the end of this month.\u201d</p><p>Haley\u2019s fork clattered to her plate. She quickly picked it back up and threw him one of her trademark fake smiles.</p><p>\u201cThat is wonderful, Crew. I\u2019m very happy for you,\u201d she said, her voice almost convincing.</p><p>He didn\u2019t understand why she was upset. He\u2019d told her for months this was in progress. Was she that attached to Catalina Island? If she was, he could most likely find another development property nearby. Not on the island, as he\u2019d signed a non-compete clause, saying he wouldn\u2019t build another resort there that could possibly be better than this one. But the California mainland was only twenty-two miles away, and he could easily commute to another spot on the coastline to do what was now his passion, restoration.</p><p>\u201cIs everything OK, Haley? You seem a little...I don\u2019t know...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m very happy for you, Crew. Very happy,\u201d she said, rising from the table. When her arms twisted around his neck and she sat on his lap, he didn\u2019t fight her; nor did he when her lips moved over his.</p><p>But after a few moments, he pulled back and tried to get the situation under control. Sex would come later. Right now, he had a very important question.</p><p>\u201cMake love to me,\u201d she pleaded, and she wiggled herself against him. This was hard; he was hard. Harder. Hardest. No! He couldn\u2019t do this right now. He had to think. The night was planned out for a reason.</p><p>\u201cHaley...\u201d he groaned as her breasts pushed into his chest and her fingers began undoing his shirt.</p><p>\u201cNo more talking, Crew. Make love to me,\u201d she demanded as she slipped from his lap and knelt before him, unbuttoning his pants and freeing his pulsing arousal. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He intended to stop her, even moved his hands to her hair to push her away, but as her sweet, hot mouth circled over him, his head fell back in ecstasy.</p><p>Afterward. They\u2019d talk afterward...</p><p>Chapter Twenty-Seven</p><p>Crew woke up alone in the bed. The sheets were cold where Haley normally slept, and a sense of unease filled him.</p> <p>He\u2019d lost his head for a while last night, totally and completely lost it. Yet how could he refuse her when she was begging him to make love to her? He\u2019d never claimed to be a saint and she\u2019d pushed him beyond the limits of what he could possibly handle.</p><p>He\u2019d gladly do it all over again. She\u2019d been spectacular.</p><p>Wait. Now Crew was sitting up quickly in bed. No matter how good it had been, it wasn\u2019t even close to worth it if she\u2019d somehow managed to sneak out on him. He\u2019d felt her pulling away, and should have been thinking of more than his sexual needs. He needed Haley in his life.</p><p>Relief whooshed through him when he discovered all her things still there in the room. She hadn\u2019t left him, not yet, at least.</p><p>He knew she was planning to run, but he wasn\u2019t going to let her get far. She\u2019d put him under her spell last night, but even if he had to find a damned chastity belt for himself, he wasn\u2019t going to let her pull that trick again until the ring in his pocket was on her beautiful finger. Hello, cold showers.</p> <p>Haley\u2019s Cinderella-size feet enjoyed their shoeless freedom, relishing the feel of the cool wet sand between their toes. She left a pattern behind her as she walked lazily along the beach. She\u2019d gone several miles and it was past time to turn around, but she couldn\u2019t bring herself to do it just yet. Last night had been special, something that she could remember Crew by.</p><p>She loved him. How could she not when he\u2019d been nothing but kind to her, done nothing but show her how to be a better person? Everything he\u2019d done so far had been about her, for her, and now she owed him his freedom.</p><p>She\u2019d be OK. She didn\u2019t know how, but she would make it through this. He\u2019d taught her how to respect herself, to be comfortable with the person she was inside. He\u2019d taught her that she was a beautiful woman. Though it wouldn\u2019t come easily for her, she would never put on a dunce cap and stand in a corner again. That was all thanks to Crew Storm.</p><p>In the far recesses of her mind, she knew she was running away. She knew she was far more afraid of his rejection \u2014 of actually hearing him say the words that he didn\u2019t want her anymore. If she were the one to walk away, maybe, just maybe, it wouldn\u2019t hurt as badly.</p><p>After all they\u2019d been through together, if he turned on her, pushed her away from him, she would have a hard time getting past it. She\u2019d been rejected her entire life by those who should have been the first to embrace her. She deserved to be a little weak just this once, didn\u2019t she? If she found love ever again \u2014 doubtful \u2014 and met again with failure \u2014 more likely \u2014 she would try to face up to rejection head on.</p><p>After another half mile, Haley turned around. The sun was rising in the sky, and the last of the morning fog was dissipating, bringing a beautiful new day to the rest of the people on the island. Haley wished the fog around her heart would clear as well, leaving her ready to begin a new life.</p> <p>She picked up her pace for her return toward the Catalina Couture Resort. It was best to just get this over with. She\u2019d rip off the bandage and then she and Crew could both move forward.</p><p>What she wanted next she just didn\u2019t know, whether it was to get back into school, move, or keep things the way they\u2019d been before coming to this small paradise. But after their conversation, she simply couldn\u2019t stay here any longer. To see him would be heartbreak. Maybe she\u2019d go to Italy and be a tourist, find a job in a small caf\u00e9 and try her hand at art.</p><p>As she reached the resort and stepped inside the lobby\u2019s beautiful French doors, her heart thudded. No matter how she\u2019d tried to prepare herself for what was to come, her heart still ached, and fear climbed higher in her throat.</p><p>Somehow she put one foot in front of the other and managed to return the kind smiles of the front-desk associates, and then she walked down the short hallway to his office. Maybe he wouldn\u2019t be there and she could just leave him a note, take the coward\u2019s way out.</p><p>No. She wouldn\u2019t do that. After all he\u2019d done for her, he deserved to hear her say goodbye to his face.</p><p>Crew was sitting at his desk, his phone held to his ear, when he looked up and saw her in the doorway. A wide grin spreading across his face, he motioned for her to enter.</p><p>Why did he have to be so perfect? Why was it that every muscle in her body was urging her to rush into his arms? If he\u2019d been cruel even once, this wouldn\u2019t be so difficult.</p><p>But then, if he\u2019d been cruel, her heart wouldn\u2019t be breaking right now. Trying her best to look upbeat, she moved forward and sat down, crossing her legs and leaning back as she waited for his call to end.</p> <p>\u201cSorry about that, Haley. I was planning on looking for you this morning, but then I got called down for an early staff meeting. Since then, I haven\u2019t been able to get off the phone for more than five minutes at a time. Where did you go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I needed to take a walk. It was no big deal. Now I just need to speak to you, for only a minute,\u201d she said, adopting a cheerful yet businesslike tone.</p><p>\u201cLet me switch the phones over and I\u2019ll take you for a late breakfast,\u201d he said as he stood up.</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t need to do that, Crew. This won\u2019t take long. I just wanted to let you know I\u2019m leaving tomorrow. I have everything arranged already and didn\u2019t want to take up too much of your time today. I know you have a lot going on with the sale. I need to spend the rest of the day packing, and then I\u2019ll be out of your hair before you know it,\u201d she said. She refused to acknowledge the tears burning at the bottom of her throat, let alone give in to them.</p><p>Crew went from smiling to stone-faced in the span of two seconds. She couldn\u2019t read anything in his eyes as he refused to let her look down \u2014 refused to break their gaze.</p><p>\u201cWould you care to explain further?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d she asked, deciding it easiest to play dumb.</p><p>\u201cWhy the sudden urgency to leave?\u201d</p><p>A shiver ran down her spine at the cold fury in his voice. He was pissed and not trying to hide it. Maybe she should have just slipped away during the night.</p><p>Not knowing her next move, Haley just sat there, frozen.</p><p>Crew was furious. He couldn\u2019t remember ever being this angry. He didn\u2019t know whether he wanted to haul her into his arms and rip her clothes off, reminding her how good they were together, or to bend her over his knee and smack her on the ass.</p><p>As her large green eyes grew wide and he saw the glimmer of insecurity and self-doubt, his temper instantly cooled. She was trying her damnedest to act cool and collected, but she obviously wasn\u2019t in as much control as she wanted him to believe.</p><p>Something else was going on here, and he was going to find out what.</p><p>\u201cWhy the sudden desire to run away, Haley? I thought you were finished hiding.\u201d</p><p>His comment made the color rise in her cheeks; she gazed at him and seemed at a loss for words. Emotions, he could deal with; dead-silence, he couldn\u2019t. As long as she wasn\u2019t just through with him, he could fix this. And there was just no way he could have been so wrong about her.</p><p>Drawing up closer, he took pleasure in the tenseness of her shoulders. She was far from cool, and, with the last of his apprehension fading away, he reached down and lifted her to her feet.</p><p>She took a faltering step backward as she tried to regroup, but he didn\u2019t give her the opportunity. Tracking her as she bumped up against his desk, he boxed her in, then stood over her.</p><p>\u201cI need some space!\u201d she cried as she tried to skirt around him.</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019ve given you enough room to breathe. I asked a question and I want to know what this is about,\u201d he said, his hand rising to trace the contour of her cheek.</p><p>She flinched as if his touch were painful.</p><p>Good. She was hurting. She didn\u2019t want to leave him. His senses were heightened and he picked up on the slightest twitch of her muscles \u2014 in her face, her body \u2014 as he searched for clues to why she would say something so random and ludicrous.</p><p>\u201cThis is nothing more than your dignity getting squashed,\u201d she huffed. \u201cFine. If you want to be the one to call it quits, be my guest. We both know you are leaving in a couple of weeks. So, you don\u2019t want to lose your easy lay for your remaining time here. Well, too damned bad. I\u2019m going.\u201d She ended with just the slightest hitch to her voice.</p><p>That was it. She was afraid he would walk away from her. Man, did she have it all wrong. Crew pushed up against her, unashamedly crowding into the last remaining space between them.</p><p>\u201cIs that what you think? Do you honestly believe this has all meant nothing to me \u2014 that I\u2019m going to just walk away from you without ever looking back?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what you do, isn\u2019t it? You like the ladies, like to wine and dine them, show them a good time, and then walk away. I\u2019ve heard all the stories. Well, I\u2019m giving you your freedom, Crew. You\u2019re free to move on to your next woman,\u201d she forced out through gritted teeth.</p><p>He rocked his hips forward, brushing his rapidly rising arousal against her, enjoying the shock in her eyes as their bodies connected.</p><p>The two of them had never had a problem when it came to sex. She was responding to him as she always did, and he was forced to back off just a hair before he got too turned on and forgot what was most important. That had happened before...</p><p>Haley pulled against him, desperately trying to escape his grasp. Crew wasn\u2019t having it. He gripped her arm and held on tight. He wasn\u2019t letting her go anywhere, not unless she truly wanted to leave him. He was done with her trying to hide from him. He wanted all or nothing from here on out.</p><p>\u201cLet me go, Crew. I have things to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if I don\u2019t want to let you go? What if I like you right where you are?\u201d he said with a knowing smirk.</p><p>\u201cThis is ridiculous. Stop now!\u201d she cried out, on the verge of tears.</p><p>Good. They were finally getting somewhere real. \u201cStop what, Haley? Stop caring about you? Stop making love to you? Stop dreaming of a future with you? Stop loving you? Which emotion, which temptation, which feeling should I stop?\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widened as tears filled them, then began trickling down her face.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you trying to hurt me?\u201d she begged, raw pain flashing across her features.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not the one wielding the knife, Haley. You are. All I\u2019ve wanted for the past month was to show you that you can\u2019t live without me. I love you. I need you by my side.\u201d He didn\u2019t see how he could get much clearer than that.</p><p>\u201cBut, for how long, Crew? You think you love me, but you don\u2019t know the real me. You don\u2019t know how messed up I really am. I\u2019ve been on good behavior with you...but I have so many issues, so many problems...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care. I love you, Haley.\u201d</p><p>When she was silent and an innocent hope began filling her eyes, he pressed on. \u201cI love you, Haley.\u201d She still said nothing. \u201cDo you understand what I am saying? I love you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI...I...how?\u201d she gasped.</p><p>\u201cHow can I not? You make me want to be a better person. You\u2019re kind to strangers, loving and giving. You make me laugh and burn even at the same time. I love you because you make me the person I\u2019ve always wanted to be, but didn\u2019t know how to become. You are special and talented, and it would be my pleasure if you\u2019d stand by my side even when I\u2019m a fool, even when I don\u2019t always make the wisest of choices. I want to build a life with you, take you to any and all of the surviving Wonders of the World, make love to you in the ancient pyramids. You make me want to fly and to take you with me.\u201d</p><p>Crew let her go so he could drop to his knees. Drawing from his pocket the ring he\u2019d been holding onto, he opened the box and held it out to her, his heart hers for the taking.</p><p>Haley\u2019s body froze as she looked at the box, and gasped. When she finally raised her head to return his gaze, her eyes were overflowing with emotion. Crew had gotten through to her.</p> <p>The weight on his chest lifted as he looked upon her raw beauty. He\u2019d have the rest of his life to worship her, show her how special she truly was.</p><p>\u201cMarry me, Haley. Please say that you will be my wife. Please don\u2019t run from me. I can\u2019t ever say it enough, but you are my world now.\u201d</p><p>Haley dropped to her knees to be at eye level with him, and too overcome with emotion to speak, she simply nodded her head, sobbing as he clasped her hand in his and slipped an exquisite diamond in place.</p><p>\u201cIs this what you really want?\u201d she finally asked.</p><p>\u201cThis is the Final Lesson, Haley. Just be yourself, always, and your man will fall to his knees to honor and cherish you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI do love you, Crew. I thought I was doing the right thing in walking away, letting you live your life because you\u2019ve given me more than any other person ever has. But it was ripping me apart to think of never seeing you again.\u201d She wound her arms around his neck and laid her head on his shoulder.</p><p>It was over \u2014 the pain, sorrow and fear was over. Relief and unadulterated love consumed him as he realized he\u2019d never have to be apart from her.</p><p>Crew lifted his hand and stroked her hair, holding her as she cried quietly against him. \u201cYou will never be alone again, Haley Sutherland. Not only do you have me to love you forever, but you now have the family you always should have had. We will always be there for you.\u201d</p><p>Raising her head, she gave him a watery smile and thanked him with a gentle kiss before he stood and lifted her into his arms. They would forge that path in the pure snow together, and he\u2019d keep his promises of cherishing her always.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-Eight</p><p>\u201cThat is absolutely the best engagement sex I\u2019ve ever had,\u201d Crew said with a satisfied grin.</p> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Haley gasped. The thought that he\u2019d been engaged before pierced her heart.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just kidding, Haley...well, not about the sex. That was incredible. I\u2019m kidding about engagement sex. You are the one and only woman I\u2019ve ever wanted to spend the rest of my life with,\u201d he appeased her.</p><p>Haley relaxed against his chest, grateful he hadn\u2019t let her walk away. What a fool she\u2019d been to succumb to her fears. She gazed adoringly at the ring on her left hand, and she couldn\u2019t help but think of how far she\u2019d come in the last several months.</p><p>At the beginning of the year she\u2019d been taking a psychology course, and thank goodness her professor had suggested the assignment to do something outside their comfort zone. If she\u2019d never gone to that auction, she wouldn\u2019t have met the nice man who\u2019d given her a ticket for two weeks at the Catalina Couture...</p><p>\u201cOh, my gosh, I knew I\u2019d seen your father before!\u201d Haley exclaimed as she sat straight up.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d Crew looked at her as if she were going mad.</p><p>\u201cYour dad. I met him right before coming down here. I was at a charity function...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait. Slow down. You need to start from the beginning,\u201d Crew said, his brows drawn together. So Haley leaned back and began telling him the story...</p> <p>Nine months earlier</p><p>\u201cFor your final project, each of you will step out of your comfort zone, and approach a stranger, strike up a conversation, and ask that person three questions. Here are the places you may choose from. You must pick the three questions, but they may not be simple and impersonal, like \u2018What is your favorite color?\u2019; they have to be complex or personal, such as \u2018Where did you spend your honeymoon?\u2019\u201d</p><p>Haley sat frozen in the chair. How was she supposed to ask a complete stranger intimate questions?</p><p>As if the professor could read her mind, he spoke again. \u201cDon\u2019t let this overwhelm you. Each of you signed up for my class because something was missing in your lives. You wanted to delve a bit deeper. After this term, each of you will move on to new and exciting adventures. This person you approach will be a stranger whom you will most likely never see again. This is a good test for future job interviews, for your confidence, and for your overall education. If you have any questions, see me after class.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat exactly are we looking for as a response?\u201d someone asked.</p><p>\u201cThat is a good question. You are going to take note of their reaction. What is the expression in their eyes? Do they look away as you ask them? Are they open or closed off? Does their jaw tense as if they are uncomfortable, or do they laugh and relax? How you read people is important to how you will later conduct interviews and act in places of business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you expect on the paper?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want a diagnosis of the emotional state of the stranger. Think of yourselves as psychologists, and the people you question as your patients. Write a five- to seven-page paper on how they respond, not just their answers, but their demeanor. Look beyond the box.\u201d</p><p>The handout came down Haley\u2019s row and she glanced at the short list of events placed before her. She hadn\u2019t come so far only to fail, so it looked as if she was going to be putting her newly learned skills to the test.</p><p>She chose a charity auction, and felt the first stirrings of unease settle in her stomach. No. She pushed the anxiety away. She could do this.</p><p>Leaving the class, she drove to a local mall and wandered around for a while, looking for the most nondescript black dress she could find. It was a strange feeling not to worry about money, but still she was frugal. Years of not knowing what the next day would bring had taught her to be careful. She couldn\u2019t change that in the course of a few years. She didn\u2019t want to change it.</p><p>Never would she be as selfish and bitter as her grandparents.</p><p>Finding a dress she could live with, she paid the cashier, then drove home. The event was that night and she figured she\u2019d better get it over with, or else lose her nerve. If that happened, she\u2019d have to try another event, and on and on until no events were left. She could do this.</p><p>Taking a little time to apply a spot of blush and some mascara, she threw her hair into a bun and slipped into the dress and low heels, then grabbed a purse and headed back out the door of her apartment.</p><p>Arriving at the fundraiser, she found herself in a line of cars waiting for valet parking. It didn\u2019t take long for her to reach the front of the line, and she offered a genuine yet nervous smile to the young boy who opened her car door.</p><p>\u201cGood evening, ma\u2019am. Have a pleasant night,\u201d he said as she handed him a tip and stepped from the car.</p><p>Walking through the open double doors on trembling legs, she found herself in a glamorous ballroom, and the butterflies in her stomach nearly flew out of her mouth. To be more exact, she felt as if something were going to come out of her mouth...and it probably wasn\u2019t butterflies. There was so much to take in around her.</p><p>Men were dressed in impeccably tailored tuxedoes \u2014 no rentals here \u2014 and women displayed gowns in all styles and colors, though none came close to her sixty-dollar off-the-rack pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance. The amount of sparkle from the diamonds dripping from the women was enough to blind her, but she kept her head high as she scanned the items up for bid.</p><p>Though she had enough money to pay for any of the items for sale, she would never spend ten thousand dollars on a one-of-a-kind diamond bracelet or twenty thousand for a night on the town with a Hollywood megastar. She had so picked the wrong place to come for her psychology paper.</p><p>Just as she was thinking it was time for her to abandon this mission, her eye caught on a poster showcasing an exclusive island resort with blue skies and shining beaches. Intrigued, she moved toward it and found an older gentleman standing nearby.</p><p>His expression was friendly; she wondered whether he might be willing to answer a few questions, but her shyness took over and she turned to stare at the advertisement.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t an auction item, but a vacation won by raffle only. At the end of the night, a name would be drawn, and the winner would spend two weeks at the new resort in Catalina Island when it opened in May. She was tempted to invest a few dollars on the off chance of winning.</p><p>\u201cIt looks like paradise, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>Haley was startled when the older gentleman spoke. She tentatively glanced up and realized he was speaking to her.</p><p>\u201cYes, it does. After my finals are done, I could use a vacation,\u201d she shyly responded.</p><p>\u201cFinals? What are you studying?\u201d</p><p>This was the perfect opportunity to ask him some questions.</p><p>Taking a deep breath, she thought, Here goes. \u201cAmong other things, I\u2019m taking a psychology class right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love psychology courses. I remember learning more about myself than anything else while there,\u201d he replied, and she relaxed.</p><p>A soft beard covered his cheeks and chin, and he wore tinted glasses. She wondered why, and thought that would be a good question, but more than a bit rude.</p><p>\u201cYes, I think I\u2019ve grown over the past four months, though our professor likes to give us assignments that many would consider outside of the box,\u201d she said with a slight laugh.</p><p>\u201cAh, I had a few professors like that. What is this man or woman doing to torment you at the moment?\u201d</p><p>His easy laughter made Haley feel a bit more comfortable. \u201cI\u2019m supposed to ask questions of strangers,\u201d she said nervously.</p><p>\u201cMmm, that sounds interesting.\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t tell whether he would be willing or not, but she had nothing to lose by asking. \u201cWould you mind answering a few for me? Though asking the questions is the entire reason that I\u2019m here tonight, I\u2019d rather die, honestly, than approach people.\u201d Her heart pounded as she waited for his response.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s never a hardship to speak to a woman as beautiful as you,\u201d he suavely replied.</p><p>Blushing furiously, Haley pulled out her notepad and a pen. If he thought it strange, he didn\u2019t say anything.</p><p>She really should have planned better because she didn\u2019t have anything written down. She honestly hadn\u2019t thought she\u2019d get this far. She\u2019d start off easy, and just ask a few more than the three she was supposed to, then pick and choose what she wrote about in her paper.</p><p>\u201cDid you grow up in Seattle?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I didn\u2019t. I was born here, but then my parents moved to the East Coast when I was a young boy. I just recently moved back,\u201d he said before asking his own question. \u201cNow it\u2019s my turn. Why did it take a college class to get you out here, and why are you all alone?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Haley was nervous to the point of nausea, but she stifled it and smiled at him. \u201cI don\u2019t like public events at all, especially parties like this, though I shouldn\u2019t tell you that. I just feel like I\u2019m in far over my head. I\u2019d rather be home in my jammies studying,\u201d she answered with a nervous giggle.</p><p>\u201cNow you have me intrigued. Tell me more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s not a whole lot to tell. I go to school, work part time, and harass strangers on the side,\u201d she tried to joke.</p><p>When his lips twitched and a chuckle escaped his mouth, she felt her nausea rise. She couldn\u2019t have a sophisticated conversation with a man in a tux. He was so far above her station in life, it wasn\u2019t even funny. It didn\u2019t matter how much she had in her bank account. That wasn\u2019t truly her money; it was an inheritance \u2014 and to make it worse, her grandparents were surely rolling over in their graves at the way she was using it. They\u2019d never thought her worthy of going to college, of being anything other than a burden on society.</p> <p>\u201cWell, we don\u2019t want you failing your course, now, do we? Ask me anything else you\u2019d like,\u201d he said.</p><p>Haley beamed up at him and lifted her notepad back up. \u201cDo you have children?\u201d</p><p>A happy smile spread across his features. \u201cYes. I have five of them, though there are times I want to toss each and every one into the ocean and make them swim back to shore like the Navy Seals do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. Are there family problems at home?\u201d Realizing that was far too personal to ask, Haley backed off. When she felt someone was in pain, she wanted to help, since she\u2019d gone through so much of her own trauma, but this man was obviously successful and didn\u2019t need her help. \u201cI apologize. That was rude. Please ignore me and let me ask something else.\u201d</p><p>Before she could say anything further, he cut in. \u201cYes, there are some problems. My children can be very spoiled. They are doing much better now, but some of us are still struggling a bit. I have faith that it will all work out, however.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI would have loved having siblings. I really would have loved having a mom and dad. Sometimes we aren\u2019t given what we truly want, or think we need most, but I think in the end it all works out for the best,\u201d she said while lifting her hand and placing it on his arm in a comforting touch. For just a moment, she forgot this man wouldn\u2019t want or need her advice, or her comfort.</p><p>\u201cWhat is your name, young lady?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHaley Sutherland.\u201d She realized she was gripping his arm and instantly tried to remove her hand.</p><p>\u201cWhat other questions do you have for me,\u201d he asked while placing his hand over hers. She relaxed, feeling an odd connection with this gentle man.</p><p>\u201cWhat is the one thing you want more than anything else?\u201d</p><p>For a brief moment, he was silent, and Haley hoped she hadn\u2019t overstepped again.</p> <p>\u201cI want my children to be happy and married, to have children of their own and to live their lives to the fullest without throwing away their futures,\u201d he said with a wistful note in his voice.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s asking for too much. From only speaking to you for a few moments, I have a feeling that you will make a wonderful grandfather.\u201d She gave him her best smile, then decided she\u2019d monopolized enough of the kind man\u2019s time.</p><p>\u201cYou are a sweet girl, Haley. Let me give you a small token as an early graduation gift,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cOh, I have three semesters left,\u201d she corrected him, not wanting to accept anything from a stranger who had shown her nothing but kindness.</p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s why it\u2019s an early gift. I have a few extra tickets for the drawing for two weeks at the Catalina Couture Resort,\u201d he said, placing the tickets in her hand and folding her fingers over them.</p><p>To say no again would be rude, so Haley smiled up at him, never dreaming that she might win.</p><p>\u201cThank you. You\u2019ve been very kind.\u201d With a smile, Haley turned and wandered around the room. At the end of the night, when her name was called, she was so stunned she didn\u2019t know what to think or do.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t until she was writing up her report that she realized she\u2019d forgotten to get the man\u2019s name. It was too late now. She hoped her professor would still accept the paper and not make her suffer through something like that again.</p> <p>Present time</p><p>\u201cThat was my dad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I didn\u2019t recognize him when he was here because he was clean shaven and not wearing the glasses, but his voice sounded so familiar that I knew I must have met him before. I just didn\u2019t know where.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think...? No. There\u2019s no way...\u201d he trailed off.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d she asked, needing to know why he suddenly looked so full of suspicion.</p><p>\u201cHe couldn\u2019t have fixed that drawing, could he?\u201d</p><p>Haley thought about it for a moment and didn\u2019t see how that was possible. \u201cNo. Why would he want to, anyway?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe he was trying to set us up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut...he didn\u2019t know anything about me. That makes no sense, none whatsoever. Besides, how was he to know my next class was human sexuality and I\u2019d have to approach another stranger and ask for a date?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou weren\u2019t asking me for the date. You were asking me to teach you how to be with another man,\u201d he growled as he pinned her down on the mattress.</p><p>\u201cThat was the best decision I ever made,\u201d she said. How she loved the man who\u2019d taught her so much.</p><p>\u201cYes, it was. Now, I have a few more lessons to teach you...\u201d</p><p>He spent the rest of the day teaching her how very much he honored her with his body. We may as well start the honeymoon now, she thought with a satisfied smile. Yes, Haley had changed. The shy, frightened girl she\u2019d been was slowly being replaced by this confident woman she was becoming. It was all thanks to the faith of a lonely old man, who happened to like meddling in his children\u2019s lives, and of course, thanks to Crew, who would forever be her true love for always having confidence and faith in her.</p><p>Epilogue</p><p>Three months later</p><p>\u201cOh, my gosh, seriously, you guys are not teenagers!\u201d</p><p>Lucas glanced up and grinned at his fifteen-year-old daughter, Jasmine. He couldn\u2019t believe how much time had passed since the day she was born. Nearly sixteen now and just as much a beauty as her mother. She was also as stubborn as any of the Anderson males.</p><p>\u201cI am simply giving your mother a kiss,\u201d he said and nuzzled Amy\u2019s neck.</p><p>\u201cHonestly, I\u2019ll need therapy,\u201d Jasmine said with a roll of her eyes, but there was a sparkle in them, too. For all her protests, she lived in a very loving home, and she was a well-rounded and idealistic young woman. She just couldn\u2019t let her parents know that she thought their constant need to hold each other even after sixteen years was beautiful. Saying ewwww was more fun.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll soon be sneaking off to kiss boys yourself, young lady,\u201d Amy said, making Lucas tense up.</p><p>\u201cOver my dead body!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Lucas. Our baby girl is no longer a baby. If you\u2019d quit scaring all her male friends, she might actually get her first kiss,\u201d said Amy, running a soothing hand over his arm, though it was doing nothing to soothe him.</p><p>\u201cJasmine\u2019s far too young to be kissing anyone,\u201d he stated emphatically.</p><p>\u201cOh, so you hadn\u2019t kissed anyone by the age of sixteen?\u201d Amy challenged.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s beside the point,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019ll go kiss a boy right now just to show you both how gross you look doing it all the time, and in front of me,\u201d Jasmine said with a smirk.</p><p>\u201cGood. I need someone to kill.\u201d Mark joined in the conversation as he entered the room.</p><p>\u201cHi, Uncle Mark. It\u2019s about time you got here. I can\u2019t wait to come spend the weekend with you and Aunt Emily,\u201d Jasmine said and launched herself at her favorite uncle.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s good to see you, squirt. What in the hell is this talk of you kissing boys?\u201d he demanded, though his eyes were soft as he looked down at her. They had a close bond. Mark had a softer spot for Jasmine than any of the other nieces and nephews.</p><p>\u201cI was just trying to prove a point to my parents about how disgusting it is to see old people smooching all the time. Not that you\u2019ll help me, because you and Aunt Emily are just as bad. But, for some reason, it\u2019s just not as gross catching the two of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because I\u2019m so much younger and better-looking than your old stuffed shirt of a father,\u201d Mark said and puffed out his still-magnificent chest.</p><p>\u201cYou are still quite the looker, babe,\u201d Emily said, joining them and giving him a brief kiss.</p><p>\u201cUgh. I\u2019m going to find Uncle Alex. At least he has some manners,\u201d Jasmine told them, then skipped away.</p><p>\u201cShould I tell her that he\u2019s currently hiding in the closet with Jessica?\u201d Mark said with laughter.</p><p>\u201cNah, let her face even more trauma when she finds them,\u201d Lucas answered.</p><p>Placing their arms around their wives, Lucas and Mark led them into the great room, where their huge family was gathering.</p><p>Over the past fifteen years, the Anderson family had certainly grown a lot larger. With Lucas marrying his beautiful wife Amy, and then Alex and Mark following in his steps, the clan had more than doubled in size.</p><p>When their Uncle George had come back to town with their four cousins, it had grown even more, especially as the cousins had married one by one, and then started having their own children.</p><p>The holidays were never quiet, and the home of their father, Joseph, was filled with love and laugher, just as he wanted it.</p><p>\u201cHey, Cousin, can you give me a hand? Isabelle is throwing a major fit, and you know how she adores you.\u201d</p><p>Lucas laughed at the panicked look on Austin\u2019s face. Isabelle, who was five years old now and an only child, was a holy terror. Lucas adored her.</p><p>\u201cOf course. She just needs her Uncle Lucas,\u201d he said confidently</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Austin said in relief. \u201cI swore up and down to Kinsey that I had everything under control. I don\u2019t know how she manages to keep everything running so efficiently, but my hat\u2019s off to that woman,\u201d he said as the two of them walked out front, where Isabelle\u2019s impressive vocal cords could be heard echoing from the front driveway.</p><p>Two of the employees were standing guard at the vehicle, but both looked as if they\u2019d rather be flayed alive than reach into the car and try to get the screaming child out.</p><p>\u201cWhy is she so upset?\u201d Lucas asked as they approached.</p><p>\u201cI forgot her blankie,\u201d Austin said, as if afraid the world would implode because Isabelle\u2019s favorite pink blankie had been left behind.</p><p>\u201cOoh, I see how much trouble you\u2019re in. It\u2019s a good thing Uncle Lucas can make it all better.\u201d Walking up to the large SUV, Lucas leaned in and smiled at a screaming Isabelle. \u201cHey, darling, did your daddy make you mad?\u201d</p><p>She quieted as soon as she saw Lucas, and then the tears started in earnest as she looked pitifully up at him with her big blue eyes. She could already milk a situation for all it was worth. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDaddy...for...forgot...my...blankie,\u201d she sniffled in between sobbing hiccups.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, baby. Let Uncle Lucas take you inside, \u2019cause I have a surprise for you,\u201d he said.</p><p>She looked up at him with a bit of curiosity and her crying dimmed. Lucas could hear Austin sigh heavily behind him.</p><p>\u201cSu...su...surprise?\u201d she asked, still not sure whether she was willing to leave the car.</p> <p>\u201cYes, surprise. But, only big girls get it.\u201d That was all it took. Because she was the youngest of all the cousins, Isabelle\u2019s major goal in life was to be a big girl.</p><p>Lucas knew that Grandma Katherine and Grandma Esther and all the children\u2019s aunts and moms had spent all year making them new quilts. They\u2019d used pieces of their newborn clothes and nursery blankets, and other cherished fabrics. Their grandmothers wanted to give these gifts to each of them on Thanksgiving, not Christmas, when the abundance of toys would make the quilts seem less special.</p><p>The women had all put their hearts into the project, and Lucas had a feeling it was going to become a family tradition for any new members of the family to receive one the year they were born.</p><p>While Lucas calmed Isabelle and Mark hunted Alex down to offer help in the sitting room, their new cousins began arriving. The entire family was happy to meet new kinfolk, and knew that Joseph, George and Richard were particularly jubilant.</p><p>As they rounded the corner, Lucas bumped into someone he hadn\u2019t met yet.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he said as he brought up his hand to protect Isabelle\u2019s head.</p><p>\u201cThis house is huge, and I was admiring a painting, so wasn\u2019t paying attention. I\u2019m Crew Storm,\u201d said the man, whose arm was around a petite blonde.</p><p>Lucas shifted Isabelle to his hip so he could shake Crew\u2019s hand.</p><p>\u201cLucas Anderson. I\u2019m one of your many cousins,\u201d he replied.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve heard all about you, Lucas. It\u2019s a pleasure to finally put a face to the name. This is my fianc\u00e9e, Haley Sutherland.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHello, Crew,\u201d Amy said as she joined them. \u201cHaley, would you like to join us women in the library?\u201d</p> <p>Lucas beamed at his wife. She always had a friendly smile for everyone, and he knew she would welcome his new family with open arms.</p><p>Haley gave Amy a tentative smile as she released Crew\u2019s arm and followed Amy away.</p><p>\u201cCongratulations, Cousin. She\u2019s beautiful,\u201d Lucas said and slapped him on the back. The two of them went to the playroom so they could hand off Isabelle to her grandmother and then go together for a cigar and a drink.</p><p>Meanwhile, Joseph, George and Richard sat in the den sipping cognac from crystal glasses as they enjoyed the warmth of the fire.</p><p>\u201cRichard, I can\u2019t even tell you how thankful I am this year that we\u2019ve discovered a new brother. You are a person I\u2019d call friend even if you weren\u2019t blood,\u201d Joseph said, his voice choking just the slightest. He quickly took a sip from his glass and looked at the leaping flames.</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t be happier to know you. But I have decided to forgive my parents. What they did was wrong on so many levels, but they loved me, and I know I\u2019m the man I am today because of the way they raised me. It saddens me to have missed the opportunity to meet my real parents, but I\u2019ll learn all about them through the both of you. Our kids will now get to know each other, and our grandkids will be close, as well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpeaking of grandkids, congratulations on the upcoming nuptials of Crew and Haley. That is wonderful. You may have your first grandbaby by Christmas next year,\u201d George said. \u201cI wish our kids had gotten engaged without us having to push them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Crew needed a little push. I met Haley and fixed the drawing for her to get two weeks at Crew\u2019s resort,\u201d Richard said with a beaming smile.</p> <p>\u201cBrother, you are a man after our hearts. You must tell us what happened,\u201d Joseph said, leaning back. The three of them were roaring with laughter by the time Richard finished his tale.</p><p>\u201cSo now that you have one child married off, what are your plans for the other four?\u201d Joseph asked, his eyes lit up.</p><p>\u201cWell, a few months ago I met this real sweet girl who\u2019s graduating at the end of spring term with her bachelor\u2019s in biochemistry. She\u2019s going on for her master\u2019s in oceanography sciences, but she has the summer off, and she\u2019s fascinated by sunken treasures. It just so happens that my boy Ashton owns a boating business out of Seattle. I\u2019ve given her a card and told her he\u2019d be more than happy for some work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt sounds like she\u2019ll be too busy for a family,\u201d George stated as he took a puff from his cigar.</p><p>\u201cNonsense, Brother. She\u2019s such a sweet thing, and in need of a man to help her let down her hair. I think sparks are going to fly between the two of them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, then, we have some work to do,\u201d Joseph exclaimed, and he leaped from his chair. The thought of matchmaking again sent his blood pumping.</p><p>There was nothing like family \u2014 and finding true love for those you loved so dearly.</p><p>The three men walked from the room toward the warmth and laughter of their still-expanding clan. It was a new day \u2014 and the sun continued to shine for the Andersons.</p><p>The End </p> </body></html>"]
