It\u2019s exhausting. But for some womenthere is an occasional out. An excuse that lets them say what\u2019s really on their minds, allows them to forgive even if they know they shouldn\u2019t, and pushes them to indulge all those nasty little fantasies\u2014without the scarlet consequences.</p><p>Alcohol.</p><p>It can give the courage to talk dirty and the permission to go home with the bartender.</p> <p>It\u2019s the alibi. The cover story.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t really you\u2014you were possessed by Captain Morgan and the Grey Goose.</p><p>Unfortunately, I have a very high tolerance for alcohol.</p><p>Sucks to be me.</p><p>In all our years together, Billy was never able to drink me under the table. Not once. Maybe it\u2019s because I started drinking at a young age. Maybe I was just born that way.</p><p>Regardless, it takes a lot to get me buzzed and even more to get me drunk.</p> <p>That\u2019s why, back in the day, I preferred pot.</p><p>Much more efficient.</p><p>Yep, you heard me right. Kate Brooks\u2014pothead extraordinaire. Me and the Grateful Dead? We could\u2019ve been bestest friends. Weed courage is what made me brave enough to get my tattoo.</p><p>But, sadly, those days are over. As I started business school, I realized the consequences of getting caught with a controlled substance were just too high.</p><p>So now I stick to legally sanctioned drugs only. Mostly wine.</p><p>Drew and I drink it nightly, just to unwind. And once a week we have kind of a date night\u2014a special night. We cook together.</p><p>Drew is a big fan of the fajitas. We drink and talk and drink some more.</p><p>Tonight we drank a bit more than usual. So, even though I\u2019m not wasted in the literal sense, my limbs feel loose. Relaxed. Just like my inhibitions.</p> <p>have I got your attention? Excellent.</p><p>Open a window, ladies and gents\u2014it\u2019s about to get hot in here.</p><p>We\u2019re in bed.</p><p>I\u2019m on my back. And Drew is between my legs.</p><p>Well\u2014his face is, anyway.</p><p>\u201cI love your pu**y.\u201d</p><p>I moan, and he reinforces his words with actions. he\u2019s big on actions.</p><p>Wet, worshipful actions.</p><p>\u201cI could f**king live down here.\u201d</p><p>he picks up his pace, and before you can say \u201cSlap me with a riding crop,\u201d I\u2019m pulling on his hair and screaming his name.</p><p>Moments later, Drew smirks proudly and crawls up my body.</p><p>My limbs are lazy from the wine\u2014and the orgasm, of course. All around, there\u2019s a pleasant haze, a mist of numbness, making everything seem dreamlike.</p><p>And then we\u2019re kissing. And heat spreads throughout my body like an electrical current, bringing me back.</p><p>Making me feel how real this is.</p><p>I rip my mouth from his and whisper\u2014the alcohol making me brave\u2014\u201cDrew . . . Drew, I want to try something.\u201d</p><p>That gets his attention. \u201cWhat do you want to try?\u201d his tongue glides over my nipple.</p><p>I smile and bite my lip. \u201cSomething new.\u201d</p><p>he raises his head. his lids are adorably heavy. \u201cI like new.\u201d</p><p>I chuckle and push him off me, then stand up and make my way toward the dresser\u2014bumping into the nightstand as I go.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me.\u201d</p><p>I open the top drawer and pull out two pairs of handcuffs.</p><p>Delores got them for her post-wedding bachelorette party, but she already had a pair.</p><p>Don\u2019t ask.</p><p>I swing one around my finger. My sexy strut back to the bed is almost ruined as I stumble on my four-inch heels, and I giggle.</p><p>Drew rises up on his knees. he looks hungry, like a starving lion eyeing up a juicy steak that\u2019s just out of reach.</p><p>he moves to take the cuffs from me, but I push him away.</p><p>\u201cOn your back, big boy.\u201d</p><p>I know what he\u2019s thinking. Can\u2019t you almost hear him?</p><p>\u201cMmm . . . Kate wants to run the show? Interesting.\u201d he backs up and brings his wrists to the posts of the headboard. I circle his wrists and lock the half moons in place.</p><p>Click.</p><p>Click.</p><p>he gives each one a tug, testing it out, as I rest on my heels beside him, my eyes smoothing over the rippling naked perfection that is Drew Evans.</p><p>Beautiful.</p><p>\u201cYou plan on doing something? Or are you just going to stare at me all night?\u201d</p><p>I look up at him. And his eyes are eager, daring me to bring it on.</p><p>Oh, I can bring it. Don\u2019t ever doubt that.</p><p>I lift my chin proudly and bring my hands between his thighs.</p><p>Rubbing and massaging his balls slowly. I slide my hand up his already hard cock, gripping it tight\u2014the way I know he likes\u2014 before giving it a few firm pumps.</p><p>Drew\u2019s chest starts to rise faster.</p><p>Interesting indeed.</p><p>And before you ask, no, I wasn\u2019t always this way. This adventurous.</p><p>Bold.</p><p>My entire sexual relationship with Billy involved two levels: shy and mundane. hesitant and rote. And that\u2019s just where it stayed. It was only after Drew that I realized how much Billy and I were holding each other back.</p><p>In sex\u2014in life.</p><p>In each other\u2019s eyes, we would always be Katie and Billy. Immature. Dependent. Forever young\u2014like that Tuck movie about the fountain of youth.</p><p>Then Drew Evans came into my life, and the outspoken, demanding, and yes, horny woman who had been growing inside me for a decade was set free. At least in bed.</p><p>his bed.</p><p>I bend at the waist, ass in the air, and take his length in with my mouth. he jerks at the contact. The alcohol must have numbed my gag reflex, because I\u2019m able to take him all the way down my throat.</p><p>And I do.</p><p>Four, five, six times. Then I bring my eyes to his. During a blow job? Guys love eye contact. Don\u2018t ask me why\u2014I have no idea.</p><p>\u201cYou like it when I suck your cock, Drew?\u201d</p><p>he likes dirty talk too. Actually, there\u2019s not much Drew doesn\u2019t like.</p><p>his eyes roll back. \u201cFuck, yes.\u201d</p><p>I go back to work, letting my tongue get into the action.</p><p>his voice is breathy, panting. \u201cGod, baby\u2014you give the best head. You could teach a frigging class.\u201d</p><p>ha\u2014that\u2019s funny! Dick Lick 101.</p><p>After almost two years together, I\u2019m an expert at reading Drew\u2019s body language. So when his hips start to lift and his hands clench in the air, I know he\u2019s close. his appreciative grunts and groans almost make me abandon my plan.</p><p>But I don\u2019t.</p><p>At the last second, just before he comes, I pull away. And sit up. Drew\u2019s eyes are squeezed shut, waiting for the explosion that\u2019s not coming.</p><p>he opens his eyes and they\u2019re bewildered. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I smile, feeling empowered.</p><p>And naughty.</p><p>I yawn dramatically. \u201cYou know, that wine really took a lot out of me. I\u2019m kind of tired.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWh . . . what?\u201d he pants.</p><p>\u201cI think I need a breather. You don\u2019t mind, do you?\u201d</p><p>Drew growls, \u201cKate . . .\u201d</p><p>I swing my leg over him, sliding his massively impressive hardon between my legs. Sitting on it, but not letting it slip inside.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m kind of thirsty too. I\u2019m going to get a glass of water. You want some?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t f**king funny, Kate.\u201d</p><p>Oooh, he\u2019s mad.</p><p>Scary.</p><p>I slide my finger down the middle of his chest. \u201cWho\u2019s laughing?\u201d</p><p>he pulls at the cuffs\u2014harder this time. When the locks hold, I giggle. Who knew poking a lion with a stick could be so much fun?</p><p>\u201cRelax, Drew. Stay put like a good boy and I\u2019ll come back . . .\u201d</p><p>I shrug. \u201cEventually.\u201d</p><p>I kiss his nose quickly, hop off the bed, and scurry from the room as he calls my name.</p><p>Don\u2019t look at me like that; I\u2019m just teasing him a little. You know he deserves it. No harm in that, right?</p><p>I skip down the hall to the kitchen, proud of myself. When I step onto the cold tile floor, goose bumps rise up my legs and down my arms. I really am thirsty, so I get a glass from the cabinet and fill it with cold water.</p><p>Standing at the sink I take a nice long gulp, closing my eyes as the cool liquid soothes my dry throat. A drop trails down my chin, over my collarbone, and down my breast.</p><p>Without warning, a hard chest presses up against my back, shocking me. I squeak and the glass drops and shatters in the sink.</p><p>I don\u2019t know how he got free, but the handcuffs are dangling from his wrists. Rough hands pull me back, trapping me.</p><p>I shiver as seductive warm breath scrapes my ear.</p><p>\u201cThat wasn\u2019t nice, Kate. I can be not nice too.\u201d</p> <p>his voice is low\u2014not angry, but firm. It\u2019s incredibly arousing.</p><p>One hand grips my hair at the nape and pulls, making me arch my back and press my pelvis against the rim of the sink. he jerks my head to the side, and then he\u2019s kissing me\u2014plunging his tongue into my mouth as I race to keep up.</p><p>The kiss is possessive.</p><p>Dominating.</p><p>A moment later he pushes easily inside me and starts a pounding rhythm, his lower abdomen slapping against my ass with each push.</p><p>It\u2019s exhilarating.</p><p>I hear myself moan. The counter bites into my stomach, but I don\u2019t care. All I can feel is Drew.</p><p>Controlling me. Driving me. Owning me.</p><p>his free hand grips mine and brings it around front to my clit.</p><p>Pressing my fingers down, compelling me to pleasure myself.</p><p>Guys have a thing for mast***ation. I\u2019ve come to realize it\u2019s a huge turn on\u2014like throwing a match into a barrel of gasoline.</p><p>he releases my hand, but my fingers continue to move like he wants them to. Like I\u2019m a puppet on a string, and Drew is the master puppeteer. And then he leans back, taking the heat of his chest away.</p><p>The pace of his thrusting slows. And I feel his hand slide down my spine. Between us.</p><p>To my ass.</p><p>his hand kneads and rubs, then his fingers glide around the mounds of flesh. Back and forth over the hypersensitive hole between them.</p><p>And I tense up.</p><p>This is new territory for us. Well\u2014for me. I have no doubt that Drew has, at one time or another, been inside every available orifice of the female form.</p><p>But for me it\u2019s unknown. And a little nerve-racking.</p><p>his fingers make several harmless passes until I relax. Until the tension drains from my shoulders, and I\u2019m once again distracted by the intense pleasure the rhythm of his hips invokes.</p><p>And then he slides one finger inside.</p><p>There\u2019s no pain. No discomfort. Double penetration is a lot like skydiving. To truly appreciate it, you have to experience it.</p><p>Words don\u2019t really do it justice.</p><p>But I\u2019ll try: delicious.</p><p>In a forbidden, naughty kind of way.</p><p>Slowly Drew moves his finger in and out, catching up with the pace of his cock.</p><p>And I\u2019m moaning, low and deep and uninhibited. My own fingers rub faster\u2014harder\u2014in front. Then I gasp as he stretches me wider, making room for the second finger he just slipped in.</p><p>his movements are unhurried. Torturous and teasing.</p><p>And I want to open my mouth and beg for more.</p><p>More friction, more heat.</p><p>Faster. More. Please.</p><p>Drew compels me forward gently. Bending me over, so my hair brushes the bottom of the sink. And then he\u2019s gone\u2014out of my body.</p><p>And I ache with the loss of it.</p><p>Until I feel the head of his cock, wet with my fluids, stroking back and forth over the opening his fingers just occupied.</p><p>\u201cDrew . . .\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s a keening moan, half pleasure, half pain.</p><p>All pleading.</p><p>\u201cSay yes, Kate. Fucking Christ . . . please say yes.\u201d</p><p>his voice is raspy. Raw.</p><p>With need.</p><p>For me.</p><p>And suddenly I feel powerful.</p><p>Strange, considering our current position, but still\u2014I\u2019m the one in control. he may as well be begging at my feet.</p><p>Waiting and hoping for my command.</p><p>I don\u2019t think. I don\u2019t weigh the options or contemplate the consequences. I only feel, submerged in rapturous sensation.</p><p>I let go.</p><p>And I trust.</p><p>\u201cYes . . .\u201d</p><p>Ever so slowly, Drew presses forward into me. There\u2019s a moment of pain\u2014a stretching burn\u2014and I inhale sharply. he pauses. Until I release my breath. Then, gently, he continues forward, until his most intimate flesh is fully ensconced in my own. Then he stays completely still. Letting my body adjust to the intrusion.</p><p>I feel his hand slide across my hip and down my thigh, coming around to my front. his hand goes under mine, his fingers rubbing in a circular motion. In that sensuous, magnificent way, before dipping inside me. Over and over and over again.</p><p>I always thought of anal sex as the ultimate show of domination, forceful, maybe humiliating.</p><p>But this doesn\u2019t feel that way.</p><p>It\u2019s primal . . . unexplored . . . but beautiful too. Sacred.</p><p>Like I\u2019ve just given him my virginity. And in a way, I guess I have.</p><p>I move first, pushing back against him.</p><p>Giving Drew permission\u2014wanting to know, to experience these new sensations. Needing to cross the finish line. With him.</p><p>It\u2019s more than erotic. Beyond intimate.</p><p>Drew\u2019s lips press against the skin on my back. Kissing and cursing and whispering my name. And then he\u2019s the one moving.</p><p>Taking back control. Gliding in and out\u2014tender but steady. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>It\u2019s divine.</p><p>My hand clasps over his at my clit. My legs tremble and I know I\u2019m getting close. So close. Like climbing a mountain and realizing the peak is just mere steps away.</p><p>Our breaths come in deep open-mouth pants with each drive of Drew\u2019s hips.</p><p>\u201cYes . . . yes . . . yes . . .\u201d</p> <p>Men\u2019s orgasms are ninety percent physical. It\u2019s easy for them to get off, regardless of where their thoughts are. Women have it harder. Our orgasms usually hinge on our mental state. Which means if you guys want to get us there? We can\u2019t be thinking about that load of laundry in the next room, or the pile of papers waiting on our desks.</p><p>Which explains why it\u2019s not Drew\u2019s hand, or dick, that does me in.</p><p>It\u2019s his voice.</p><p>With his forehead against my shoulder blade, he chants, \u201cOh God, oh God, oh God . . .\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s so unlike him.</p> <p>he sounds open. Exposed.</p><p>Vulnerable.</p><p>This infuriating man, who always wants to be in charge, calling the shots. Who doesn\u2019t make a move without examining it from every angle, turning it around in his amazing mind\u2014the pros, the perks, the ramifications.</p><p>he\u2019s falling apart behind me.</p><p>And as he whispers a litany of profanities and prayers\u2014I fall over the edge.</p><p>Into ecstasy.</p> <p>My head snaps back and my eyes close. And stars burst behind my eyelids as I tense and scream, and wave after dizzying wave of pleasure wracks my body.</p><p>Drew\u2019s movements become uneven and jerky, more forceful and uncontrolled.</p><p>And a moment later he pulls my hips back against him, holding me there, as one long, last guttural moan spills from his lips.</p><p>Afterward, we catch our breaths. Still connected and quaking with aftershocks. his hands smooth up my arms as he slips out of me.</p><p>he turns me around to face him. his hands caress my cheeks, and then he\u2019s kissing me.</p><p>And it\u2019s so sweet. Kind and loving. Such a stark contrast to our desperate movements moments before.</p><p>I don\u2019t know why, but my eyes fill with tears.</p><p>Instantly, Drew\u2019s gaze turns worried. \u201cAre you okay? Did I . . .</p> <p>did I hurt you?\u201d</p><p>I smile through the tears, because they\u2019re happy ones. Because in some weird, unexplainable way, I\u2019ve never felt closer to him than I do right now.</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019m wonderful. Feel free to be not nice to me anytime.\u201d</p><p>Then he smiles too. Relieved and satisfied.</p><p>\u201cNoted.\u201d</p><p>Drew picks me up and carries me to the shower. We stand under the warm spray and wash each other worshipfully. Then Drew wraps us in thick, heated towels and bears me to bed.</p><p>he pulls the blanket up over both of us and holds me tight against him.</p><p>And it makes me feel precious.</p><p>He makes me feel that way. Always.</p><p>Cherished.</p><p>Adored.</p><p>Was I sore the next day? A little. But it wasn\u2019t so bad.</p><p>Too much information?</p><p>Sorry. Just trying to be helpful.</p><p>In any case, the aches and pains of the following morning were more than worth it, as far as I was concerned.</p><p>But what\u2019s the point of all this, you ask? Why am I sharing it with you?</p><p>Because good sex? Really, really good sex?</p><p>Doesn\u2019t need alcohol. And it\u2019s not about compatibility, or practice, or even being in love.</p><p>It\u2019s about trust.</p><p>Letting your guard down. Putting yourself in another person\u2019s hands and letting him lead you to places you\u2019ve never been before.</p><p>And I trusted Drew. With my mind, my heart, my body. I trusted Drew with everything.</p><p>At least I did then.</p><p>Chapter 1</p><p>In high school, biology was my favorite subject. What fascinated me most were species that transform into a whole new being. Like pollywogs. Or butterflies. They start out as one thing, but end up something else entirely.</p><p>Unrecognizable.</p><p>Everyone always looks at butterflies and thinks, \u201chow lovely.\u201d</p><p>But no one ever thinks about what they had to go through to become what they are. When the caterpillar builds its cocoon, it doesn\u2019t know what\u2019s happening. It doesn\u2019t understand that it\u2019s changing.</p><p>It thinks it\u2019s dying. That its world is ending.</p><p>The metamorphosis is painful. Terrifying and unknown. It\u2019s only afterward that the caterpillar realizes it was all worth it.</p><p>Because now it gets to fly.</p><p>And that\u2019s what I feel like right now. I\u2019m more than I was before. Stronger.</p><p>Did you think I was tough before?</p><p>Fooled you. Some of it was just bravado. A fa\u00e7ade.</p><p>Dealing with Drew Evans is like swimming into one of those rogue waves at the beach. he\u2019s overwhelming. And either you kick hard to keep up, or he rolls over you and leaves you behind with a face full of sand.</p><p>So I had to pretend to be a hard ass.</p><p>I don\u2019t need to pretend anymore, because now I\u2019m granite.</p><p>Impenetrable, all the way through.</p><p>Ask anyone who\u2019s survived an earthquake at midnight, or a house fire that wipes out everything that matters. Unexpected devastation changes you.</p><p>And I mourn the old me. And my old life. The one that I had planned to share with Drew forever.</p><p>You seem confused. Sorry\u2014let\u2019s start again.</p><p>See that woman over there? On the swing, in this empty playground?</p><p>That\u2019s me\u2014Kate Brooks.</p><p>But not really. Not the Kate you remember, anyway. Like I said, I\u2019m different now.</p><p>You\u2019re probably wondering why I\u2019m here, back in Greenville, Ohio, all alone.</p><p>Technically speaking, I\u2019m not alone.</p><p>But we\u2019ll get to that later.</p><p>The reason I\u2019m in Greenville is simple. I couldn\u2019t bear to stay in New York. Not for another day. Not after everything.</p><p>Drew?</p><p>he\u2019s still in New York. Probably nursing a vicious hangover. Or maybe he\u2019s still drunk. Who knows? Let\u2019s not concern ourselves with him too much. he has an attractive stripper to take care of him.</p><p>Yep\u2014I said a stripper. At least I hope she was a stripper. She could\u2019ve been a prostitute.</p><p>Did you think Drew and I were going to ride off into the sunset? Live happily ever after? Join the club. Apparently happily ever after only lasts two years.</p><p>Don\u2019t check the title. You\u2019re in the right place. This is still the Drew and Kate show. It\u2019s just twisted around. Messed up. Welcome to Oz, Toto. It\u2019s a f**ked-up place to be.</p><p>What\u2019s that? You think I sound like Drew? That\u2019s what Delores says\u2014that he\u2019s infected me with his profanity. She calls it Drewspeak. I guess after two years, it kind of rubs off.</p><p>So I can see that you\u2019re wondering what happened. You were so in love. You were so perfect for each other. Tell me about it. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Or better yet, tell the stripper.</p><p>Anyway\u2014believe it or not\u2014the real problem wasn\u2019t another woman.

Apparently that was a chance John was willing to take. Of course, he didn\u2019t know we\u2019d end up together like we are now, but . . . he takes credit for that part too. Starting to see where Drew gets it from, aren\u2019t you?</p><p>Erin walks in now with our clients\u2019 coats. She makes eye contact with Drew and taps her watch. he nods discreetly.</p><p>\u201cI say we go out and celebrate\u2014paint this town red! See if you city folk can keep up with the likes of me,\u201d Jackson howard says.</p><p>Even though he\u2019s pushing seventy, he\u2019s got the energy of a twenty-year-old. And I suspect he\u2019s got more than a few bull-riding stories up his sleeve.</p><p>I open my mouth to accept the invite, but Drew cuts me off.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019d love to, Jack, but unfortunately Kate and I have a previously scheduled appointment. There\u2019s a car waiting for you downstairs to take you to the finest establishments in the city. Enjoy yourselves. And of course the tab\u2019s on us.\u201d</p><p>They stand and Jack tips his hat to Drew. \u201cThat\u2019s damn fine of you, son.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s our pleasure.\u201d</p> <p>As we walk to the door, Jack Jr. turns to me and holds out his card. \u201cIt was a real pleasure working with you, Miss Brooks. The next time you\u2019re in my neck of the woods, I\u2019d be honored to show around. I have a feelin\u2019 Texas would agree with you. Maybe you\u2019ll even decide to stay and put down some roots.\u201d</p><p>Yep, he\u2019s coming on to me. Maybe you think that\u2019s sleazy. I would have, two years ago. But like Drew told me then, it happens all the time. Businessmen are slick, cocky. They kind of have to be.</p><p>It\u2019s one of the reasons this field has the third-highest rate of infidelity\u2014right after truck drivers and police officers. The long hours, the frequent traveling, hooking up almost becomes inevi-table. A foregone conclusion.</p><p>It\u2019s how Drew and I started, remember?</p><p>But Jack Jr.\u2019s not like the other jerks who\u2019ve propositioned me.</p><p>he seems sincere. Sweet. So I smile and reach out to take his card, just to be polite.</p><p>But Drew\u2019s hand is faster than mine. \u201cWe\u2019d love to. We don\u2019t get a lot of work down South, but the next time we do, we\u2019ll cash in that rain check.\u201d</p><p>he\u2019s trying to be professional, unemotional. But his jaw is clenched. Sure, he\u2019s smiling, but have you ever seen Lord of the Rings? Gollum smiled too.</p><p>Just before he bit that guy\u2019s hand off who was holding his \u201cprecious.\u201d</p><p>Drew is territorial and possessive. That\u2019s just who he is.</p><p>Matthew once told me a story: For Drew\u2019s first day of kindergarten, his mother bought him a lunch box. A Yoda one. On the playground, Drew wouldn\u2019t put it down because it was his and he was afraid someone would break it. Or steal it. It took Matthew a week to convince him that nobody would\u2014or that together, they could beat the everlasting hell out of anyone who did.</p><p>At times like this, I know just how that lunch box felt.</p><p>I smile kindly at Jack Jr. and he tips his hat. And then they\u2019re out the door.</p><p>As soon as it\u2019s closed behind them, Drew tears John Jr.\u2019s card in half. \u201cDickhead.\u201d</p><p>I push his shoulder. \u201cStop it. he was nice.\u201d</p><p>Drew\u2019s eyes snap to mine. \u201cYou thought Luke and Daisy Duke\u2019s inbred love child was nice? Really?\u201d he takes a step forward.</p><p>\u201cAs a matter of fact, yes.\u201d</p><p>his voice morphs into an over-the-top southern drawl. \u201cMaybe I should buy myself some chaps. And a cowboy hat.\u201d Then he drops the accent. \u201cOohh\u2014or better yet, we\u2019ll get you one. I can be your wild stallion and you can be the brazen cowgirl who rides me.\u201d</p><p>And the funniest thing of all? he\u2019s really not kidding.</p><p>I shake my head with a smile. \u201cSo what\u2019s this mysterious meeting we have? There\u2019s nothing on my schedule.\u201d</p><p>he smiles widely. \u201cWe have an appointment at the airport.\u201d</p><p>he slides two airline tickets out of his suit pocket.</p><p>First class\u2014to Cabo San Lucas.</p><p>I inhale quickly. \u201cCabo?\u201d</p><p>his eyes sparkle. \u201cSurprise.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019ve traveled more in the last two years than I had in my entire life before\u2014the cherry blossoms blooming in Japan, the crystal waters of Portugal. . . . All things Drew had already seen, places he\u2019d already been to.</p><p>Places he wanted to share\u2014with me.</p><p>I look closer at the tickets and frown. \u201cDrew, this flight leaves in three hours. I\u2019ll never have time to pack.\u201d</p><p>he takes two bags out of the closet. \u201cSo it\u2019s a good thing that I already have.\u201d</p><p>I wrap my arms around his neck and squeeze. \u201cYou are the best boyfriend ever.\u201d</p><p>he smirks in that way that makes me want to kiss him and slap him at the same time.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I know.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The hotel is stunning. With views I\u2019ve only seen on a postcard.</p><p>We\u2019re on the top floor\u2014penthouse. Like Richard Gere in Pretty Woman, Drew is a big believer in \u201conly the best.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s late when we get in, but after a nap on the plane, we\u2019re both wired. Energized.</p><p>And hungry.</p> <p>All the airlines are cutting back these days, even in first class.</p><p>The sandwiches may be complimentary, but that doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re edible.</p><p>While Drew is in the shower, I start to unpack. Why aren\u2019t we showering together? I really don\u2019t need to answer that, do I?</p><p>I put the bags on the bed and open them. Most men look at an empty suitcase like it\u2019s some kind of physics equation\u2014they can stare at it for hours, but still have no frigging clue what they\u2019re supposed to do with it.</p><p>But not Drew.</p> <p>he\u2019s Mr. I-Think-of-Everything.</p><p>he packed all the incidentals that most men wouldn\u2019t think of. Everything I\u2019ll need to make my vacation comfortable and fun.</p><p>Except for underwear. There isn\u2019t a single pair of underwear in this entire suitcase.</p><p>And it\u2019s not an oversight.</p><p>My boyfriend happens to hold a serious grudge against undergarments. If he had his way, we\u2019d both be walking around like Adam and Eve\u2014minus the fig leaves, of course.</p><p>But he did bring the rest of the essentials. Deodorant, shaving cream, a razor, makeup, birth control pills, moisturizer, the rest of my antibiotic for the ear infection I had last week, eye cream\u2014and so on.</p> <p>And we should pause here, for a brief public service announcement.</p><p>I have a few clients who are in the pharmaceutical field. And those companies have whole departments whose sole job is writing.</p><p>Writing what, you ask? You know those little inserts that come with your prescription? The ones that list every possible side effect and what you should do, should any of them occur? May cause drowsiness, don\u2019t operate large machinery, contact doctor immediately, blah blah blah.</p><p>Most of us just open the little paper bag, take out our pills, and throw the insert away. Most of us do . . . but we shouldn\u2019t. I\u2019m not going to bore you with a lecture. All I\u2019ll say at the moment is: Read the insert. You\u2019ll be glad you did.</p><p>And now\u2014back to Mexico.</p><p>Drew walks out of the bathroom with a towel around his waist, and I forget all about the suitcase. You know how some men are boob guys, or ass guys? It works the same for women. I\u2019m a forearm girl, myself. There\u2019s something about a man\u2019s forearms that\u2019s just . . . hot. Masculine\u2014in a manly man kind of way.</p><p>Drew has the finest set I\u2019ve ever seen. Tight and toned\u2014not too bulky, not too thin\u2014with just the right amount of hair.</p><p>he removes the towel from his hips and rubs it over his shoulders. And I\u2019m pretty sure I start to drool.</p> <p>Maybe I\u2019m an ass woman after all.</p><p>\u201cYou know it\u2019s impolite to stare.\u201d</p><p>I drag my eyes up to his. he\u2019s smiling. And I take a step toward him\u2014like a cougar closing in on her prey.</p><p>\u201cIs it, now?\u201d</p><p>Drew licks his lips. \u201cDefinitely.\u201d A drop of water slides down the middle of his chest.</p><p>Anyone else thirsty?</p><p>\u201cWell, I don\u2019t want to be rude.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod forbid.\u201d</p><p>Just as I\u2019m about to lean down and lick the droplet off him, my stomach growls. Loudly.</p><p>Grrrrrrrr.</p><p>Drew laughs. \u201cMaybe I should feed you first. For what I have planned, you\u2019re going to need some energy.\u201d</p><p>I bite my lip in anticipation. \u201cYou have something planned?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor you? Always.\u201d</p><p>he spins me around and slaps me on the rear. \u201cNow get that delectable ass in the shower so we can go. The sooner we eat, the quicker we can come back here and f**k till the sun comes up.\u201d</p><p>he really doesn\u2019t mean to be as crude as he sounds.</p><p>Yeah\u2014you\u2019re right\u2014he probably does.</p><p>An hour later, we\u2019re on our way to dinner. Drew surprised me with a new dress\u2014white eyelet and strapless, with a hem that flares out just above my knee. My hair is down with a slight curl, the way I know he loves it.</p><p>As for my boyfriend\u2014I can\u2019t take my eyes off him. Tan slacks and a crisp white shirt, the top few buttons open, the sleeves rolled up halfway.</p><p>Gorgeous.</p><p>We arrive at the restaurant.</p><p>I\u2019ve always thought the Latino culture was interesting. The music. The people. They\u2019re vibrant. Volatile.</p><p>Passionate.</p><p>All words that describe where we\u2019re dining tonight. It\u2019s dim\u2014the only illumination comes from the candles on the tables and the twinkling lights on the ceiling. A pulsing rhythm emanates from a small band of musicians in the corner.</p><p>Drew requests in Spanish a table for two.</p><p>Yes\u2014he speaks Spanish. And French. he\u2019s working on Japanese. Did you think his voice was sexy? Trust me\u2014until you\u2019ve heard him whisper blush-worthy phrases in a foreign language, you don\u2019t know the meaning of the word sexy.</p><p>We follow the robust, dark-haired hostess to a table in the corner.</p><p>Now, take a moment to look around. See all the female attention Drew gets, just by walking through the room? The appreciative glances, the inviting eyes?</p><p>I notice\u2014I always do.</p><p>But here\u2019s the thing: Drew doesn\u2019t. Because he\u2019s not looking.</p><p>At any of them.</p><p>For you guys out there who think looking doesn\u2019t hurt? You\u2019re wrong. Because we women don\u2019t think you\u2019re just enjoying the view. We think you\u2019re comparing, finding us lacking. And that stings. Like a paper cut on your eyeball.</p><p>I\u2019m fully aware that Drew could have any woman he wants\u2014 the model in Beverly hills, the heiress on Park Avenue. But he picked me. he fought for me. So when we go out, it\u2019s a major boost to my confidence.</p><p>Because I\u2019m the only woman he\u2019s looking at.</p><p>We sit at the table and scan the menus. \u201cSo explain to me again how you made it through college and business school without ever drinking straight tequila?\u201d</p><p>I laugh at the question, remembering. \u201cWell, back in high school, we\u2019d have these bonfires\u2014campouts.\u201d</p><p>You ever sleep with an empty two-liter soda bottle for a pillow?</p><p>It\u2019s not fun.</p><p>\u201cSo one night, Billy and the guys were drinking tequila\u2014and Billy swallowed the worm. And then he started to hallucinate. We were working on amphibian anatomy in bio at the time, and as messed up as he was, Billy was convinced he was a frog\u2014and that Delores was trying to dissect him. he hopped off into the woods by himself, and it took us three hours to find him\u2014with his tongue in the dirt. \u201cI\u2019ve been hesitant to try tequila ever since.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Drew shakes his head. \u201cConfirming, once again, what I\u2019ve known all along. Billy Warren is, and always has been, a complete f**king idiot.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m used to Drew\u2019s digs against Billy. And in this case? he\u2019s not exactly wrong.</p><p>So I tell him, \u201cAs long as you don\u2019t to make me swallow the worm, I\u2019ll give it a go.\u201d</p><p>his eyes light up, like a kid in a bike shop. \u201cYou know what this means?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>he wiggles his brows. \u201cI get to teach you how to do body shots.\u201d</p><p>Although I don\u2019t believe you need to be drunk to have great sex, having a good buzz certainly doesn\u2019t hurt.</p><p>Drew and I are in the elevator heading back to our room, both of us more than tipsy from the tequila. I can taste it on Drew\u2019s tongue\u2014bitter with a touch of citrus. he has me pinned against the wall, my skirt bunched up around my hips, and we\u2019re pushing and grinding against each other.</p><p>I\u2019m glad there\u2019s no one else in the elevator\u2014although at this point? I\u2019m really too far gone to give a damn.</p> <p>We stumble into the room.</p><p>Still groping and kissing.</p><p>Drew slams the door and spins me around. In one quick movement he pulls the dress down my body, leaving me bare. Except for my heels.</p><p>I lean over the desk, resting on my elbows. I hear the hiss of a zipper\u2014and then I feel him. Sliding his c**k between my lips\u2014 testing the waters\u2014making sure I\u2019m ready.</p><p>I\u2019m always ready for him.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t tease,\u201d I whimper.</p> <p>Between the tequila and the elevator, I\u2019m really turned on.</p><p>Needy. he pushes in slowly but to the hilt. And I sigh.</p><p>Now, we all know the old phrase that bigger is better. And Drew is big\u2014not that I have a lot to compare him to, but he\u2019s twice the size of Billy.</p><p>I\u2019m not making you boys out there uncomfortable, am I? News flash\u2014this is how woman talk. At least when you\u2019re not around to listen.</p><p>Anyway, it\u2019s not really size that makes the man. It\u2019s rhythm\u2014the pace\u2014knowing how to hit all those delicious spots with just the right amount of pressure. So the next time you see an infomercial for Cockgrow or Miracle-Dick?</p><p>Save your money. Buy the Kama Sutra instead.</p><p>Drew grabs my hair, pulling my head back, and moves quicker. hard and fast. I grip the edge of the desk, holding on for balance.</p><p>he kisses my shoulder and whispers in my ear, \u201cYou like that, baby?\u201d</p> <p>I moan. \u201cYes . . . yes . . . so much.\u201d</p><p>he thrusts into me with more force, shaking the desk.</p><p>And just like that, I\u2019m coming like an out-of-control locomotive.</p><p>I\u2019m floating. Weightless.</p><p>And it\u2019s sublime.</p><p>Drew slows the movement of his hips as I come down, drawing it out\u2014making it last. he pulls me back against his chest and his fingers skate up across my stomach and up to my br**sts, cupping and kneading them with both hands.</p><p>I raise my arms around his neck, turning my head, bringing his mouth to mine.</p><p>I love his mouth, his lips, his tongue. Kissing is an art form, and Drew Evans is Michelangelo.</p><p>he pulls out of me and I turn around to face him. Backing him up to the bed. Drew sits on the edge and I climb on, wrapping my legs around his waist.</p><p>God, yes.</p><p>This is how I like it best\u2014chest to chest, mouth to mouth, not an inch of space between us. I take him in my hand and slide down onto him. My insides stretch with the fullness and Drew moans.</p><p>I rise slowly and slam down hard. Testing the strength of the bed springs.</p><p>Squeak.</p><p>Squeak.</p><p>I move faster. Deeper. Our bodies are slick from the Mexican heat.</p><p>And then Drew is holding my face in his hands, his thumbs moving back and forth across my skin. Suddenly tender. Worshipful.</p><p>Our foreheads press together and in the dim light I can see his eyes looking down, watching where he moves in and out of me.</p><p>And I look down too.</p><p>It\u2019s erotic. Sensual.</p><p>I push his hair back from his forehead.</p><p>And my voice is begging, \u201cTell me you love me.\u201d</p><p>he doesn\u2019t say it often. he prefers to show me. But I never get tired of hearing it. Because every time he actually says the words, I\u2019m filled with same wonderment as the first time.</p><p>\u201cI love you, Kate.\u201d</p><p>his hands still hold my face. Both of us panting\u2014moving faster\u2014getting closer. It feels spiritual.</p><p>A holy communion.</p><p>Drew\u2019s voice is hushed. Breathless. \u201cTell me you\u2019ll never leave me.\u201d</p><p>his eyes are soft now, liquid silver. Pleading for reassurance.</p><p>For all his audacity and over-confidence, I think there\u2019s a part of him that\u2019s still haunted by the week he thought I\u2019d chosen Billy over him. I think that\u2019s why he works so hard to prove how much he wants me.</p><p>To show me that I chose wisely.</p><p>I smile softly and look right into his eyes.</p><p>\u201cNever. I\u2019ll never leave you, Drew.\u201d</p><p>The words feel like vows.</p><p>his hands grip my hips, raising me up, helping me move.</p><p>\u201cGod, Kate . . .\u201d his eyes close.</p><p>And our mouths open, giving and taking each other\u2019s breaths.</p><p>he expands inside me, throbbing, as I clamp down hard around him.</p><p>And we come together. In perfect unison.</p><p>Perfect splendor.</p><p>Afterward, Drew\u2019s arms tighten around me. I touch his face and kiss him gently. he falls backward on the bed, taking me with him, keeping me on top. We lie like that for a while until our heart rates come back down and our breathing slows.</p><p>And then Drew rolls me under him.</p><p>And we do it again.</p><p>Chapter 2</p><p>The New York City club scene.</p><p>Pounding music that only allows for conversation if you\u2019re a lip-reader. Sweaty guidos in their I\u2019m-too-sexy silk shirts, who think breathing is a sign that you\u2019re interested. Impossibly long lines at the bar and insanely priced watered-down drinks.</p><p>Not really my favorite place to be.</p><p>I\u2019m more of a bar girl. Bottled beer, jukeboxes, pool tables\u2014I can be quite the pool shark when I need to be.</p><p>Not that I haven\u2019t enjoyed a good rave or two in my time.</p><p>What? You thought pot was the only illegal substance to grace my bloodstream? Afraid not. Ecstasy, acid, \u2019shrooms\u2014I\u2019ve tried them all.</p><p>You look a little shocked. You shouldn\u2019t be.</p><p>The whole drug culture was started by intellectuals in institutions of higher learning. Don\u2019t even try and tell me Bill Gates came up with Windows\u2014a maze of interconnected, multicolored path-ways\u2014without some serious psychedelic assistance.</p><p>Anyway, despite my preferences, four weeks after Cabo, Drew and I end up at the hottest club of the moment. With our best friends, Matthew and Delores. To celebrate their first anniversary. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>You didn\u2019t know they got married? It was great. Vegas. Need I say more?</p><p>Delores is into dance clubs. She enjoys any kind of sensory stimulation. When we were ten, her mother, Amelia, bought her a strobe light for her bedroom. Delores would sit and stare at it for hours, like it was a crystal ball or a Jackson Pollock painting.</p><p>Now that I think about that, it explains a lot.</p><p>Anyway, see us there? Delores and Matthew are just walking off the dance floor, to where I\u2019m sitting in a circle of trendy over-stuffed red chairs. Drew went to get another round.</p> <p>I\u2019m just too damn tired to dance tonight. Delores falls into the chair next to me, laughing.</p><p>I yawn.</p><p>\u201cYou look like shit, Petunia.\u201d</p><p>A good friend should be able to tell you anything. Maybe your boyfriend\u2019s screwing around, or a dress makes your love handles hang over like a shar-pei\u2019s skin? In either case, if they\u2019re not brave enough to tell it like it is? They\u2019re not your best friend.</p><p>\u201cThanks, Dee Dee. Love you too.\u201d</p> <p>She flips her long blond hair back, crimped and shining with glitter for this evening\u2019s festivities. \u201cI\u2019m just saying, you look like you could use a spa day.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s not wrong. I\u2019ve been exhausted all week\u2014that full-body type of weariness that feels like you\u2019re carrying weights on your ankles and your ribs. Yesterday, I actually fell asleep at my desk.</p><p>Maybe I\u2019m coming down with the flu that\u2019s going around.</p><p>Delores fans herself with her hand. \u201cWhere the hell is Drew with those drinks? I\u2019m dying here.\u201d</p><p>he\u2019s been gone a few minutes, which isn\u2019t unusual in a place like this.</p><p>Still, my eyes scan the room.</p> <p>And then they find him. By the bar, drinks in hand, talking to a woman.</p><p>A beautiful blond woman with legs as long as my whole body.</p><p>She\u2019s wearing silver stilettos and a sequined minidress. She looks . . . fun. You know the type\u2014one of those cool girls who guys love to hang out with because they burp and watch sports.</p><p>She\u2019s smiling.</p><p>More important, Drew is smiling back.</p><p>And do you see the way she\u2019s leaning toward him? The tilt of her head? The subtle rubbing of her thighs?</p><p>They\u2019ve had sex. No doubt about it.</p><p>Son of a bitch.</p> <p>This isn\u2019t the first time I\u2019ve been faced with one of Drew\u2019s past random hookups. In fact, it\u2019s pretty much an everyday occurrence\u2014the waitress at Nobu, the bartender at McCarthy\u2019s Bar and Grill, several random patrons at Starbucks. Drew is polite but brisk, paying them no more attention than an old classmate from high school whose name you can\u2019t quite remember.</p><p>So it doesn\u2019t normally bother me.</p><p>But like I said, this isn\u2019t a normal week. Fatigue has made me short-tempered. Overly sensitive. Pissed off.</p><p>And he\u2019s still f**king talking to her.</p><p>She puts her hand on his arm, and my inner cavewoman pounds her chest like King Kong in drag. There\u2019s an empty glass in front of me. Remember Marcia Brady and the football? Think I could reach them from here?</p><p>have you ever noticed that serial killers and mass murderers are almost always male? That\u2019s because men like to spread agony around. Females, however, turn our pain inward. Keep it to ourselves. Let it fester.</p><p>Yes, I took Psych 101 in college.</p><p>But the point is, instead of going over there and ripping out Blondie\u2019s hair extensions like I want to, I stand up.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going home.\u201d</p><p>Delores blinks. \u201cWhat? Why?\u201d Then she sees my face. \u201cWhat the hell did that moron do now?\u201d</p><p>Some advice\u2014when you\u2019re angry with your significant other, try not to tell your friends. Because after you\u2019ve forgiven him?</p><p>They\u2019ll never forget.</p><p>I recommend complaining to his family, instead. They\u2019ve already seen all his negative, selfish, immature traits in full swing\u2014 so it\u2019s not like you\u2019re letting the cat out of the bag.</p><p>I shake my head, \u201cNothing. I\u2019m just . . . tired.\u201d</p><p>She doesn\u2019t buy it. And her gaze locks on to where I\u2019m still looking. Legs throws her head back and laughs. her teeth are pearly white and perfect. Apparently the bulimia hasn\u2019t rotted the enamel away.</p><p>Yet.</p><p>Delores turns to her husband. \u201cMatthew, go collect your friend. Before I go over, because then you\u2019ll need a mop to collect him.\u201d</p><p>I raise my chin stubbornly, \u201cNo, Matthew\u2014don\u2019t. Drew is obviously happy right where he is. Why drag him away?\u201d</p><p>Immature? Possibly.</p><p>Do I care? Nope.</p><p>Matthew looks back and forth between us. Then he rushes off in Drew\u2019s direction.</p><p>Dee Dee has him so well trained. She puts the Dog Whisperer to shame.</p><p>I hug her good-bye. \u201cI\u2019ll call you tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>And then I head for the door without looking back.</p><p>I\u2019ve never lived by myself.</p><p>At eighteen, I went from my parents\u2019 house to a dorm room.</p><p>Sophomore year, Billy joined Delores and me in Pennsylvania, and we leased a huge dilapidated house off campus with four other students. The roof leaked and the heat sucked, but the rent was right.</p><p>After Delores left for New York, while I was still at Wharton, Billy and I got a place of our own. Then we moved to the city too\u2014and you know the rest.</p><p>Why am I telling you this?</p><p>Because I\u2019m not as independent as I come off. I\u2019m one of those women. The kind who turns on every light in the house when she\u2019s home by herself. The kind who sleeps over at a friend\u2019s when her boyfriend\u2019s out of town.</p><p>I\u2019ve never been alone. Never not had a boyfriend. It\u2019s one of the reasons Billy and I lasted so long\u2014because I preferred an expired relationship to none at all.</p><p>When I get back to the apartment, I head to the bedroom and change into a tank top and cherry-colored pajama pants. As I finish washing the makeup off my face, I hear the front door open and close.</p><p>\u201cKate?\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t answer.</p><p>his footsteps come down the hall, and a moment later Drew fills the bathroom doorway. \u201chey. Why\u2019d you leave? I came back with the drinks and Delores starts chucking ice cubes at my head, calling me a shit heel.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t make eye contact. And my voice is stiff. Dismissive. \u201cI was tired.\u201d</p><p>Why don\u2019t I just tell him what\u2019s bothering me? Because this is the game women play. We want you to drag it out of us. To show us you\u2019re interested. It\u2019s a test\u2014to see how much you care.</p><p>Drew follows me into the bedroom. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you wait for me? I would\u2019ve come with you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I raise my eyes to his. My face is tight, my body tense, ready for battle. \u201cYou were otherwise occupied.\u201d</p><p>he looks down, eyes squinting. Trying to decode my words.</p><p>Then he gives up.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d</p> <p>I spell it out for him.</p><p>\u201cThe blonde, Drew. At the bar?\u201d</p><p>he regards me with curiosity, \u201cWhat about her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou tell me. Did you f**k her?\u201d</p><p>Drew scoffs. \u201cOf course I didn\u2019t f**k her. I left two minutes after you did. We both know I last a hell of a lot longer than that.</p> <p>Or do you need a reminder?\u201d</p><p>No, he\u2019s not as obtuse as he seems. It\u2019s kind of brilliant, actually. he\u2019s trying to be cute. Sexy. Trying to distract me.</p><p>It\u2019s what he does. And usually it works. But not tonight.</p><p>\u201chave you ever f**ked her?\u201d</p><p>Drew rubs the back of his neck. \u201cYou really want me to answer that?\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s a big fat yes, in case you were wondering.</p> <p>I throw my hands up. \u201cOf course! Of course you screwed her\u2014because God forbid we go one day without seeing someone that your dick isn\u2019t intimately acquainted with! Not that you even remember them, half the time.\u201d</p><p>Drew\u2019s eyes narrow, \u201cSo which is it? Are you pissed off when I do remember them, or when I don\u2019t? Throw me a clue here, Kate, so I can give you the fight you\u2019re obviously hell-bent on having.\u201d</p><p>I pick up my body lotion and rub it swiftly over my arms. \u201cI don\u2019t want to fight\u2014I just want to know why you remember her.\u201d</p><p>Drew shrugs, and his tone turns neutral. \u201cShe\u2019s a model. her billboard\u2019s in the middle of Times Square. It\u2019s a little hard to forget someone when you see her picture every day.\u201d</p><p>And doesn\u2019t that just make me feel so much better.</p><p>\u201chow nice for you. Why are you even here then? Why don\u2019t you go back and find your little model, if she means so much to you?\u201d</p><p>A small part of me realizes I\u2019m being irrational, but my anger is like a mudslide\u2014now that it\u2019s started, there\u2019s just no way to hold it back.</p><p>Drew looks at me like I\u2019ve gone crazy and holds out his hand.</p> <p>\u201cShe doesn\u2019t mean anything to me. You know that. Where the f**k is this coming from?\u201d</p><p>And then a thought occurs to him.</p><p>he takes a step back before asking, \u201cAre you due for your period? Don\u2019t freak out\u2014I\u2019m only asking because, the way you\u2019ve been acting lately, I think Alexandra\u2019s title is in jeopardy.\u201d</p><p>he could have a point. In high school, there was this hallway, the L wing, that was always really crowded between classes. And I knew my period was coming when I\u2019d walk down that hallway and want to jab my pencil into the neck of the person in front of me.</p><p>however\u2014for you guys out there? Even if your girlfriend\u2019s tirade is PMS derived? Don\u2019t point that out to her. It won\u2019t end well for you.</p><p>I pick up my shoe and throw it, hitting Drew right between his bright blue eyes.</p><p>his hands go to his forehead. \u201cWhat the shit?! I told you not to freak out!\u201d</p><p>Every relationship has a screamer. A thrower. A breaker of things. In this one, that would be me. But it\u2019s not my fault. You can\u2019t blame the nuclear missile for going off after all its buttons have been pushed.</p><p>I pick up the other shoe and throw that one too. Drew grabs a pillow and uses it as a shield. I retreat to the closet for more ammo, but he grabs my arm before I can get there.</p><p>\u201cWould you f**king stop! Why are you being like this?\u201d</p><p>I glare up at him. \u201cBecause you don\u2019t even care! I\u2019m really upset here\u2014and you don\u2019t give a shit!\u201d</p><p>his eyes open wide, incredulous.</p><p>\u201cOf course I give a shit\u2014I\u2019m the one getting Jimmy Choos thrown at my head like Chinese freaking stars!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you care so much, why don\u2019t you apologize?!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I didn\u2019t f**king do anything! I have no problem crawling on my hands and knees when I screw up. But if you think I\u2019m gonna beg because you\u2019ve been possessed by the hormone Demon, you\u2019re out of your mind, sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>I break out of his hold and push him on the chest with both hands. \u201cFine. That\u2019s fine, Drew. I don\u2019t care what you do anymore.\u201d</p><p>I grab a blanket and pillow and shove them at him. \u201cBut you\u2019re sure as shit not sleeping next to me after you do it. Get out!\u201d</p><p>he looks down at the linens. Then back at me. And his face relaxes, turning calm.</p><p>Too calm\u2014like the kind before a storm.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going anywhere.\u201d</p><p>he throws himself on the bed, spreading his arms and legs wide like a kid making a snow angel.</p><p>\u201cI happen to like this bed. It\u2019s comfy. Cozy. I\u2019ve made some great memories here. And this is the only place I\u2019m sleeping.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s no point in arguing when Drew gets like this\u2014willful and childish. Sometimes I actually expect him to hold his breath until he gets his way.</p><p>I whip the pillow out from under his head, leaving him flat on the mattress, looking up at me.</p><p>his brow furrows. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>I shrug. \u201cI said I\u2019m not sleeping with you. So if you won\u2019t take the couch, I will.\u201d</p><p>he sits up. \u201cThis is frigging insane, Kate\u2014tell me you realize that. We\u2019re fighting over nothing!\u201d</p><p>My voice rises. \u201cSo now my feelings mean nothing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t f**king say that!\u201d</p><p>I point a finger at him. \u201cYou said we\u2019re fighting over nothing, and we\u2019re fighting about how you made me feel\u2014so that means you think my feelings are nothing!\u201d</p><p>his mouth opens, like a fish searching for oxygen.</p><p>\u201cYou lost me. I have no idea what you just said.\u201d</p><p>I close my eyes. And just like that, my anger deflates.</p><p>hurt fills me instead.</p><p>\u201cForget it, Drew.\u201d</p><p>As I walk down the hall, his voice follows me.</p><p>\u201cWhat the f**k just happened?\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m too tired to try and explain it anymore. Usually when we argue, I have a hard time falling asleep. I\u2019m too charged up with adrenaline, with passion.</p><p>But that\u2019s not a problem tonight. I\u2019m out like a narcoleptic as soon as my head hits the pillow.</p><p>Sometime later\u2014could be three minutes or three hours\u2014a warm, hard chest presses against my back, waking me up. I feel his hand on my stomach. he presses his face into my hair and inhales.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>See, boys, that\u2019s all you have to do. Those really are the magic words\u2014capable of overcoming any obstacle. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Even PMS.</p><p>I turn in his arms, and look into his eyes. \u201cWhat are you sorry for?\u201d</p><p>Drew\u2019s face goes blank, searching for the correct answer.

You didn\u2019t do anything wrong. I\u2019m definitely pre-menstrual.\u201d</p> <p>he kisses my forehead. \u201cIt\u2019s not your fault. I totally blame Eve.\u201d</p><p>I kiss his lips softly.

I look up at him. \u201cYou want me to make it up to you?\u201d</p><p>his fingers trace what I\u2019m sure are dark circles under my eyes.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re exhausted. how about you make it up to me in the morning?\u201d</p><p>I pull myself closer and rest my cheek against his skin. I close my eyes, ready to go back to sleep.</p> <p>Until Drew\u2019s voice breaks the silence.</p><p>\u201cUnless . . . you know . . . you really want to make it up to me now. Because if you do, far be it from me to\u2014\u201d</p><p>I laugh out loud, cutting off his words as I duck my head under the covers, slowly traveling downward to make it up to him.</p><p>In his most favorite way.</p><p>Chapter 3</p><p>Two days later, we\u2019re having breakfast at the kitchen table. Drew likes to exercise in the evening after work, to decompress and release the stress of the day. I, however, am one of those highly annoying people who love to go for a five a.m. run. Breakfast is where we meet in the middle. After which, Drew goes to the office and I shower.</p> <p>\u201cYou know what I love about Cookie Crisp cereal?\u201d he\u2019s staring at his spoon.</p><p>I\u2019ve never seen one person ingest so much cereal. I swear, if I didn\u2019t cook, it\u2019s all he would eat.</p><p>I swallow a mouthful of yogurt\u2014Dannon Light &amp; Fit. The commercials don\u2019t lie; it\u2019s really delicious. Strawberry banana is the best.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s shaped like cookies. So, not only is it awesome, but I feel like I\u2019m getting revenge on my parents for making me eat frigging oatmeal the first half of my life.\u201d</p><p>A poet and a philosopher, Drew is truly a Renaissance man.</p><p>I open my mouth to tease him, but I snap it shut as a wave of nausea strikes like a lightning bolt. I clear my throat and bring the back of my hand to my lips.</p><p>\u201cKate? You okay?\u201d</p> <p>As I try to answer, my stomach does a somersault that would make Nadia Com?neci jealous.</p><p>I\u2019m going to throw up.</p><p>I hate throwing up.</p><p>It makes me feel claustrophobic. Suffocated.</p><p>To this day, when I have a stomach virus, I sit on the phone with my mommy while she talks me through the heaves.</p><p>I\u2019m not going to make it to the bathroom, so I lunge for the kitchen sink. As I splatter my breakfast into it, Drew holds back the strands of hair that have escaped my ponytail.</p><p>I want to tell him to go away, but another round of retching commences. Some women have no problem going to the bathroom, passing gas, or throwing up in front of their boyfriends.</p><p>I\u2019m not one of them.</p><p>Maybe it\u2019s stupid, but if I were to die suddenly, I don\u2019t want the last image Drew has of me to be one where I\u2019m sitting on the toilet.</p><p>Or in this case, barfing in the sink.</p><p>his voice is kind. Soothing. \u201cOkay . . . easy. You\u2019re okay.\u201d</p><p>When it seems like the worst is over, Drew hands me a wet paper towel. Then he glances toward the drain. \u201cWell, that\u2019s colorful.\u201d</p><p>I croak, \u201cUgh\u2014I knew I was getting the flu.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeems like it.\u201d</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cI don\u2019t have time be sick. I have the Robinson meeting today.\u201d Anne Robinson is a client I\u2019ve been courting for months. Old money\u2014and I stress the word old. She\u2019s like, ninety-five. If I don\u2019t sign her today, it might literally be too late to sign her at all.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sick, baby. And I don\u2019t think Mrs. Robinson will be impressed if you yak all over her antique brooch. Lucky for you, you have a genius boyfriend who performs exceedingly well in clutch situations. Give me the folder\u2014I\u2019ll run the meeting. Annie\u2019s as good as yours.\u201d</p><p>he scoops me up in his arms.</p><p>\u201cDrew, no\u2014\u201d</p><p>he cuts me off. \u201cNope. No bitching. Don\u2019t want to hear it. I\u2019m putting you to bed.\u201d</p><p>I smile weakly.</p><p>Drew tucks me in and leaves a glass of ginger ale on the nightstand.</p><p>I think he kisses my forehead, but I can\u2019t be sure. Because I\u2019m already drifting off to sleep.</p><p>Three hours later, I walk out of the elevator onto the 40th floor of our office building.</p><p>My stomach\u2019s empty, but after a good nap, I woke up feeling better. Refreshed. Ready to take on the world and Anne Robinson.</p><p>I walk to the small conference room and peer in through the glass.</p><p>Can you see Drew? Sitting next to the little gray-haired lady in the wheelchair? While he\u2019s speaking to the legal representation seated around the table, Mrs. Robinson\u2019s hands disappear under it.</p><p>And a second later Drew flinches, like he\u2019s been given an electric shock.</p><p>Old women have a thing for Drew.</p><p>It\u2019s completely hilarious.</p><p>he gives Mrs. Robinson a harsh look. She just wiggles her eyebrows. Then he rolls his eyes before looking away, spotting me in the process.</p><p>Drew excuses himself and comes out into the hall, relief shining on his face like a beacon. \u201cFor the love of all that is holy\u2014thank God you\u2019re here.\u201d</p><p>My lips slide into a smirk. \u201cI don\u2019t know; Mrs. Robinson seems to be enjoying your company.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah\u2014if she tries enjoying it any more, I\u2019m going to staple her hands to the conference table.\u201d</p><p>Then he looks me over, concerned. \u201cDon\u2019t think I\u2019m not overfucking-joyed to see you, \u2019cause I am. But what are you doing here?</p><p>You\u2019re supposed to be in bed.\u201d</p><p>I shrug. \u201cMust\u2019ve been a three-hour bug. I feel fine now.\u201d</p><p>Drew cups my cheek and palms my forehead, feeling for a fever. \u201cYou sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. Right as rain.\u201d</p><p>he nods, but his eyes are suspicious, not totally convinced. \u201cAll right. Oh\u2014we\u2019re supposed to have dinner at my parents\u2019 tonight.</p><p>Think you\u2019ll be up for it, or do you want me to cancel?\u201d</p><p>Dinner at the Evans\u2019 is always an interesting affair.</p><p>\u201cI should be good to go.\u201d</p><p>he hands me the Robinson folder. \u201cOkay. Your investment strategies got them all quivery. They\u2019re wet and spread-eagled, just waiting for you to nail them.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>his imagery is slightly disturbing.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s gross, Drew.\u201d</p><p>he\u2019s unperturbed. \u201cYou say tomato, I say tomahto.\u201d Then he kisses me quickly. \u201cGo get \u2019em, killer.\u201d</p><p>he walks away and I head into the conference room to seal the deal.</p> <p>So you\u2019re starting to get it now, aren\u2019t you?

Coming from a single-child home, I found the family gatherings a little overwhelming at first. But now I\u2019m used to it.</p> <p>Drew and I arrive last.</p><p>Frank Fisher\u2014Matthew\u2019s father\u2014and John Evans stand by the wet bar in the corner, trading stock quotes. Delores is perched on the arm of the recliner beside Matthew, watching the football game, while Drew\u2019s sister, Alexandra, aka \u201cThe Bitch,\u201d and her husband, Steven, sit on the couch.</p><p>Mackenzie, Drew\u2019s niece, sits on the floor. She\u2019s changed since the last time you saw her. She\u2019s six years old now, her hair is longer, her face a little thinner\u2014more girlish, less toddler, but still adorable. She\u2019s playing with a gaggle of dolls and miniature nursery accessories.</p><p>Drew\u2019s mother, Anne, and Matthew\u2019s mom, Estelle, are most likely in the kitchen. And if you\u2019re wondering where Steven\u2019s widowed father, George Reinhart, is, we won\u2019t be seeing him until later.</p><p>As we walk into the room, Steven greets us and offers us both a drink.</p><p>We settle on the love seat, drinks in hand, and watch the game.</p><p>Mackenzie pushes a button on one of her dolls, and an animatronic voice fills the room. \u201cNo, no, no! No, no, no!\u201d</p><p>Mackenzie\u2019s head tilts as she looks at the annoying doll. \u201cI think you\u2019re wrong, Daddy. No-No Nancy doesn\u2019t sound like Momma at all.\u201d</p> <p>The comment gets Alexandra\u2019s attention. \u201cWhat do you mean, Mackenzie?\u201d</p><p>Behind his wife\u2019s shoulder, Steven shakes his head at his daughter, but unfortunately for him, she doesn\u2019t get the message.</p><p>Instead she explains, \u201cThe other day, when you were out, Daddy said No-No Nancy sounds just like you. But instead of no, you say, \u2018Nag, nag, nag.\u2019\u201d All heads turn to Alexandra, watching her like a ticking time bomb counting down to zero.</p><p>Steven tries valiantly to defuse her. he smiles and teases, , \u201cYou have to admit, honey, the resemblance is uncanny. . . .\u201d</p><p>Alexandra punches him in the arm. But he tightens his bicep before she makes contact, absorbing the blow. She punches him again, less playfully.</p><p>Steven just boasts, \u201cYou can\u2019t dent steel, babe. Be careful\u2014 don\u2019t want to hurt your hand on the gun.\u201d</p><p>Faster than a speeding bullet, Alexandra\u2019s fingers lash out and pinch the tender flesh on the back of his tricep, bringing him to his knees.</p><p>Drew grimaces and rubs the back of his own arm in sympathy.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s gonna leave a mark.\u201d</p><p>Alexandra\u2019s voice is firm. And final. \u201cI don\u2019t nag. I\u2019m a kind, nurturing, supportive wife, and if you would just do what you\u2019re supposed to, I\u2019d never have to say anything at all!\u201d</p><p>he yelps, \u201cYes, dear.\u201d</p><p>She releases his arm and stands. \u201cI\u2019m going to help my mother in the kitchen.\u201d</p><p>After she leaves, Mackenzie looks down at the chastising doll thoughtfully, then up at her father. \u201cActually, you\u2019re right, Daddy.</p><p>Momma really does sound like Nancy.\u201d</p><p>Steven puts his finger to his lips. \u201cShhhh.\u201d</p><p>A while later, Drew, Matthew, Delores, and I are in the den for Mackenzie\u2019s guitar lesson.</p><p>I\u2019m teaching her to play. I was five when my father taught me.</p><p>he told me music was like a secret code, a magical language that would always be there for me. To comfort me when I was sad, to help me celebrate when I was happy.</p><p>And he was right.</p><p>It\u2019s a lesson I\u2019ve treasured my entire life. A small piece of him that I was able to hold on to after he was gone. And I\u2019m thrilled to be able to pass that knowledge on to Mackenzie.</p><p>She\u2019s playing \u201cTwinkle, Twinkle, Little Star\u201d right now.</p><p>She\u2019s good, isn\u2019t she? Focused. Determined. I\u2019m not surprised\u2014she\u2019s Drew\u2019s niece, after all. As she finishes the song, we all clap.</p><p>Then I turn to Delores. \u201cBilly called me last night. he\u2019s got a few weeks off. he\u2019s coming to the city next week and wants to meet up for dinner.\u201d</p><p>Sarcasm drips off Drew\u2019s words like chocolate on a strawberry.</p><p>\u201cJackass is coming to town? Oh, goody. It\u2019ll be like Christmas.\u201d</p><p>Delores looks at Drew. \u201chey\u2014Jackass is my nickname for him. Get your own.\u201d</p><p>Drew nods. \u201cYou\u2019re right. Douche Bag has a much nicer ring to it.\u201d</p><p>Are you wondering about the Bad Word Jar? For those of you who don\u2019t know, the Bad Word Jar was started by Alexandra to financially penalize anyone\u2014usually Drew\u2014who cursed in front of her daughter. Originally, each curse cost a dollar, but when Drew and I were working through our issues, I convinced Mackenzie to bump the price up to ten. Color me vindictive.</p><p>Anyway, these days, the Jar is no longer used. Mackenzie has a checking account now. And since she\u2019s old enough to write, she keeps a log of who owes what in that blue notebook there\u2014the one she\u2019s scribbling in right now.</p><p>We\u2019re all expected to pay our fines before we leave. Or run the risk of a 10 percent late fee.</p><p>I have a feeling Mackenzie\u2019s going to be a brilliant banker someday.</p><p>She puts her book down and goes back to strumming her guitar. Then she turns to Drew.</p><p>\u201cUncle Drew?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sweetheart?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere do babies come from?\u201d</p><p>Drew doesn\u2019t even hesitate. \u201cGod.\u201d</p><p>I got the basics when I was eleven. My mother took the \u201cstay my little girl forever and don\u2019t ever have sex\u201d approach. Amelia Warren, on the other hand, was more than willing to fill in the gaps. She wanted her daughter Delores and me informed. And prepared. By the time we were thirteen, we could get a condom on a banana faster than any hooker on the strip. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Whatever you do, don\u2019t let your kids learn about procreation from \u201cThe Video.\u201d Finding out about the birds and the bees is a lot like finding out there\u2019s no Santa\u2014kids are bound to figure it out eventually, but it\u2019ll go down much easier coming from you.</p><p>Mackenzie nods and goes back to her guitar.

And you mix blue and red together? And you get . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cPurple!\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcellent, yes, you get purple. Babies are kind of like that. A little blue paint from the daddy, some red paint from the mommy, shake it all together, and boom\u2014you get a whole new person.</p><p>hopefully not purple, but if Aunt Delores is involved? Anything is possible.\u201d</p><p>Delores gives Drew the finger behind Mackenzie\u2019s back.</p><p>Mackenzie nods. And goes back to strumming her guitar. For one whole minute.</p> <p>\u201cUncle Drew?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep?\u201d</p><p>\u201chow does the daddy\u2019s blue paint get to the mommy\u2019s red paint?\u201d</p><p>Drew raises both eyebrows. he stutters, \u201chow . . . how does it . . . get there?\u201d</p><p>Mackenzie gestures with her hand. \u201cWell, yeah. Does the doctor give her a shot of blue paint? Does the mommy swallow the blue paint?\u201d</p><p>Matthew snickers. \u201cOnly if the daddy is a very lucky guy.\u201d</p><p>Delores smacks him on the head. But Mackenzie\u2019s round blue eyes stay on Drew, waiting for an answer.</p><p>he opens his mouth.</p> <p>And then closes it.</p><p>he starts again.</p><p>And then stops.</p><p>Finally, like cannon-balling into a pool on the first day of spring, he takes the plunge. \u201cWell . . . the mommy and daddy have sex.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s official. Alexandra\u2019s going to kill him. For real this time. I\u2019m going to be a widow before I\u2019m ever a wife.</p><p>Mackenzie\u2019s face rumples with confusion. \u201cWhat\u2019s sex?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSex is how babies get made.\u201d</p><p>She thinks about it a moment. And then she nods. \u201cOh. Okay.\u201d</p><p>Wow.</p><p>And I thought the final exams in business school were hard.</p><p>Drew handled that pretty well, don\u2019t you think? he\u2019s good with kids. Which makes sense, because in so many ways . . . he still is one.</p><p>Alexandra walks into the room. She seems happy, now\u2014now that she\u2019s showed Steven that his \u201csteel guns\u201d can, in fact, be dented.</p><p>She\u2019s all glowy.</p><p>\u201cWhat are we doing in here?\u201d</p><p>Drew smiles innocently. \u201cTalking about paint colors.\u201d</p><p>Alexandra smiles and strokes her daughter\u2019s hair.</p><p>As Mackenzie adds, \u201cAnd sex.\u201d</p><p>Alexandra\u2019s hand stops. \u201cWait . . . what?\u201d</p><p>Drew leans over and whispers in my ear, \u201cWe should probably leave the room now.\u201d</p><p>As the door swings closed behind us, we hear \u201cDrew!\u201d And Alexandra doesn\u2019t sound so happy anymore.</p><p>At last, dinner is served. The actual eating of the meal is unevent-ful, but during dessert, Alexandra taps her glass with a spoon.</p><p>\u201cEveryone\u2014can I have your attention, please?\u201d She beams at Steven and then goes on. \u201cMackenzie has an announcement she\u2019d like to make.\u201d</p><p>Mackenzie stands on her chair and proclaims, \u201cMy mom and dad had sex!\u201d</p><p>The entire table is silent.</p><p>Until Matthew raises his glass. \u201cCongratulations, Steven. It\u2019s like halley\u2019s Comet, right? You only get to come every seventy-five years?\u201d</p><p>Delores laughs.</p><p>And John clears his throat. Awkwardly. \u201cThat\u2019s, ah . . . that\u2019s . . .</p><p>very nice, dear.\u201d</p><p>Then Frank decides to share. \u201cSex is good. Keeps you regular. I make sure I have sex at least three times a week. Not that my Estelle is into any of that freaky-freaky stuff, but in forty years of marriage, she\u2019s never had a headache.\u201d</p><p>Estelle smiles proudly beside him.</p><p>And Matthew covers his face with his hands.</p><p>The rest of us just stare. Eyes wide, mouths slightly opened.</p><p>Until Drew throws his head back and laughs. \u201cThat\u2019s so great.\u201d</p><p>he wipes his eyes, practically crying.</p><p>Alexandra shakes her head. \u201cWait. There\u2019s more. Go ahead, Mackenzie.\u201d</p><p>Mackenzie rolls her eyes. \u201cWell, that means they\u2019re gonna have a baby, of course. I\u2019m gonna be a big sister!\u201d</p><p>Congratulations erupt all around. Anne tears up as she hugs her daughter. \u201cI\u2019m so happy for you, honey.\u201d</p><p>Drew stands and hugs his sister sweetly. \u201cCongratulations, Lex.\u201d Then he smacks Steven on the back. \u201cI\u2019ll keep the guest room ready for you, man.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m confused. \u201cGuest room?\u201d</p><p>Drew explains. \u201cThe last time Alexandra was pregnant, she kicked Steven out\u2014not once, not twice, but four f**king times.\u201d</p><p>Matthew joins in. \u201cAnd that\u2019s not counting the time she let him stay, but she threw all his shit out the window.\u201d</p><p>Drew chuckles. \u201cIt looked like a Barney\u2019s delivery truck exploded on Park Avenue. The homeless were never dressed so well.\u201d</p><p>Alexandra rolls her eyes and turns to me. \u201cPregnancy hormones. They can cause some pretty bad mood swings. I tend to get a little . . . bitchy . . . when I\u2019m pregnant.\u201d</p><p>Drew smirks. \u201cAs opposed to the rest of the time, when you\u2019re just so pleasant?\u201d</p><p>You know how some dogs still keep chewing your shoes\u2014no matter how many times you smack them with a newspaper? They just can\u2019t resist?</p><p>Drew is one of those dogs.</p><p>Alexandra turns on her brother like a cat hissing at a snake.</p><p>\u201cYou know, Drew, being with child? It\u2019s kind of like a \u2018get out of jail free\u2019 card. There\u2019s not a jury in the country that would convict me.\u201d</p><p>he backs away slowly.</p><p>I shake my head at him, then ask Alexandra, \u201cOther than that, how are you feeling?\u201d</p><p>She shrugs. \u201cTired, mostly. And the vomiting doesn\u2019t help.</p><p>Most women get morning sickness, but I get it at night, which sucks pretty bad.\u201d</p><p>Huh Vomiting.</p><p>Tired.</p><p>Moody.</p><p>They certainly sound familiar.</p><p>What? Why are you looking at me like that?</p><p>No, no\u2014everyone knows the surest sign of pregnancy is a missed period. And my period\u2019s not due for . . . one . . . two . . . </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>four . . .</p><p>Five . . .</p><p>My period was due five days ago.</p><p>Oh.</p> <p>My.</p><p>God.</p><p>Chapter 5</p><p>Denial is a skill I mastered at a young age.</p><p>Don\u2019t think about it.

I didn\u2019t shed a tear during the wake\u2014or at the funeral.</p><p>Thank you for your condolences.</p><p>Yes, I\u2019ll be strong for my mother.</p><p>You\u2019re so kind.</p> <p>Eight days after he was laid in the ground, my mother was working in the diner downstairs. I was in our kitchen, trying to open a jar of pickles.</p><p>I walked into my parents\u2019 bedroom and called my Dad for help. And that\u2019s when it hit me\u2014staring at their empty room. he wasn\u2019t there. he\u2019d never be there again. I collapsed on the floor and sobbed like a baby.</p><p>Over a jar of pickles.</p><p>It\u2019s that same skill set that gets me through the rest of the night at the Evans\u2019. I smile. I chat. I hug Mackenzie good-bye. Drew and I go home and make love.</p><p>And I don\u2019t tell him.</p><p>You don\u2019t yell fire in a movie theater unless you\u2019re sure there\u2019re flames.</p><p>have you ever seen Gone with the Wind? Scarlett O\u2019hara is my idol.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t think about this now. I\u2019ll think about it tomorrow.\u201d</p> <p>So that\u2019s my plan. At least for the moment.</p><p>Tomorrow comes quickly.</p><p>And apparently God has a sick sense of humor. Because everywhere I turn, I\u2019m surrounded by pregnancy.</p><p>Take a look: The dog walker passing me on the sidewalk, the police woman directing traffic, the man on the cover of People magazine at the newsstand, the fellow executive in the cramped elevator who looks like she\u2019s smuggling a contraband medicine ball under her blouse.</p><p>I cover my mouth and keep my distance, like a tourist trying to avoid the swine flu.</p><p>Eventually, I make it to my office. I sit at my desk and open my trusty daily planner.</p><p>Yes, I still use a paper-based calendar. Drew bought me a Blackberry for Christmas, but it\u2019s still in the box. I don\u2019t trust any device capable of banishing my work to the unknown abyss with the touch of a button I like paper. It\u2019s solid\u2014real. To destroy it, you have to burn it.</p><p>Usually I\u2019m pretty anal retentive. I write everything down. I\u2019m a banker\u2014we live and die by the schedule. But lately I\u2019ve been distracted; preoccupied by exhaustion and the overall feeling of crappiness. So I missed the fact that I\u2019d started a new pack of birth control pills, but never got a period for the last one.</p><p>And speaking of birth control pills\u2014what\u2019s up with that?</p><p>Ninety-nine-point-nine percent effective, my ass.</p><p>It\u2019s the same statistical accuracy of those pee-on-a-stick pregnancy tests\u2014so I\u2019m not going near one of those. Instead, I pick up the phone and call the office of Dr. Roberta Chang.</p><p>Remember those four other students who Delores, Billy, and I lived with off campus in Pennsylvania? Bobbie was one of them.</p><p>her husband, Daniel, was another.</p><p>Bobbie\u2019s an amazing person. her parents emigrated from Korea when she was just a baby. She\u2019s petite\u2014tiny enough to shop at GAP Kids\u2014but she\u2019s got the personality of an Amazon.</p><p>She\u2019s also a brilliant ob/gyn. That would be a baby doctor for you guys out there.</p><p>Bob and her husband moved to New York just a few months ago. I haven\u2019t seen her in years, but ours is one of those friendships that can go a decade without contact; then when we finally do get together, it\u2019s like we haven\u2019t missed a day.</p><p>I make an appointment and automatically mark it in my planner.</p><p>Bob\u20147:00.</p><p>I close the book and place it next to the phone on my desk.</p><p>Then I glance at the clock and realize I\u2019m late for a meeting.</p><p>Shit.</p><p>I grab a folder and head out the door.</p><p>Still not thinking about it . . . in case you were wondering.</p><p>When I get back two hours later, Drew is sitting at my desk, tapping a pen impatiently against the dark wood. We usually eat lunch together\u2014order in\u2014and share it in one of our offices.</p><p>\u201chey.\u201d</p><p>he glances up. \u201chi.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you already order, or were you waiting for me?\u201d</p><p>he looks confused. \u201chuh?\u201d</p><p>I perch myself on the edge of the desk. \u201cLunch, Drew. That\u2019s why you\u2019re here, right?\u201d</p><p>he shakes his head. \u201cActually, I wanted to check in with you about dinner. A new place opened in Little Italy, and I could really go for some pasta. I was going to make reservations for us tonight. At seven.\u201d</p><p>I freeze.</p><p>I don\u2019t have a lot of practice with lying. Not since high school, anyway. Even then, there weren\u2019t a lot of outright lies. More . . .</p><p>omissions of activities my mother would have blown a gasket over.</p><p>When it was necessary to lie, Delores was my go-to girl, my alibi.</p><p>That hasn\u2019t changed.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t tonight. Delores wants to have a girl\u2019s night. We haven\u2019t had one of those in awhile.\u201d</p><p>Let\u2019s pause for a moment. This is important.</p><p>Can you see his face? Look closely or you\u2019ll miss it.</p><p>For just a second, there\u2019s a flash of surprise. A touch of anger . . . maybe hurt. But then he catches himself, and his expression smooths back out to neutral. I missed that look the first time around. You should remember it. It\u2019ll make a lot more sense in about ten hours.</p><p>Drew\u2019s voice is flat. Like a detective trying to trip up a perpetrator. \u201cYou just saw Delores last night.\u201d</p><p>My stomach gurgles like Pop Rocks in soda. \u201cThat was different\u2014everyone was there. Tonight it\u2019ll just be the two of us. We\u2019ll grab a few drinks, eat some fattening appetizers, and then I\u2019ll come home.\u201d</p><p>Drew stands, his movements hurried, tense. \u201cFine, Kate. Do whatever the f**k you want.\u201d</p><p>he tries to walk past me, but I grab onto his belt. \u201chey. Don\u2019t be like that. We can go out to dinner tomorrow night. Don\u2019t be mad.\u201d</p><p>he lets me pull him closer, but he doesn\u2019t say anything. I give him a flirty smile. \u201cCome on, Drew. Let\u2019s do lunch. And then afterward, you can do me.\u201d</p><p>I rub my hand up his chest, trying to soften him up.</p><p>But he doesn\u2019t give. \u201cI can\u2019t. I have some work to finish. I\u2019ll talk to you later. \u201d</p><p>he kisses my forehead, and his lips seem to linger a moment longer than normal. Then he pulls back and walks away. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>In New York City, there\u2019s one thing you can depend on.

It\u2019s what I\u2019m sitting in right now.</p><p>Bumper to bumper.</p><p>I tried calling Delores three times to fill her in on my covert operation, but she didn\u2019t answer. Cell phones aren\u2019t allowed in the lab. I also haven\u2019t seen Drew since he walked out of my office, and that\u2019s a good thing.

It\u2019s a doozy.</p> <p>When we were young, Amelia told Delores that her daddy just couldn\u2019t live with them. She kept it simple\u2014kind. But when she was older, Delores got the full story.</p><p>Amelia grew up in California. Can\u2019t you just picture it? Amelia the surfer chick\u2014young and tan, lean and laid back.</p><p>When she was seventeen, she met a guy at the Santa Monica Pier\u2014dark hair, chiseled arms, and eyes the color of jade. his name was Joey Martino. They had an instant \u201cconnection,\u201d and like Juliet before her, Amelia fell fast and hard.</p><p>Then it came time for Joey to move on, and he asked Amelia to come with him. her mother told her if she walked out the door, she wouldn\u2019t be allowed to walk back in.</p><p>Ever.</p><p>Amelia hugged her little sister good-bye and hopped on the back of Joey\u2019s harley. About six weeks later, they were passing through Greenville, Ohio.</p> <p>And Amelia realized she was pregnant.</p><p>Joey took the news well, and Amelia was thrilled. Now they\u2019d be a real family.</p><p>But the next morning, all she woke up next to was a note. It read: It was fun.</p><p>Sorry.</p><p>Amelia never saw him again.</p><p>Some kids need to get burned a few times before they stop playing with matches. But Amelia was never that kind of kid. One lesson was all she needed. From then on, she only dated a certain type of man\u2014humble, simple\u2014not smooth or flashy or arrogant. Guys who were nothing like Joey.</p><p>Who were nothing like Drew.</p><p>It\u2019s why she doesn\u2019t like him.</p> <p>No\u2014that\u2019s not quite right. It\u2019s why Amelia doesn\u2019t trust him.</p><p>She took me aside that first Christmas, when she and my mother came up to visit. She told me to go slow, to watch myself with Drew.</p><p>Because she\u2019d seen his kind before.</p><p>Anyway\u2014story time\u2019s over, kids.</p><p>We\u2019re here.</p><p>Bob\u2019s office is nice\u2014a homey-looking brownstone with a real, live parking lot. Those are hard to come by in the city, in case you didn\u2019t know. It\u2019s a busy lot, shared with the building next door. Cars come and go and jockey for spaces.</p><p>I kill the engine and grip the steering wheel. And take a deep breath.</p><p>I can do this.</p><p>I mean, really\u2014it\u2019s only the next eighteen years of my life, right?</p><p>I get out of the car and stare at the small sign in the window of the building.</p><p>ROBERTA ChANG GYNECOLOGY AND OBSTETRICS As I try to get my feet to move, two large hands come from behind me and cover my eyes. A familiar voice whispers in my ear, \u201cGuess who?\u201d</p><p>I turn around, bursting at the seams. Living with someone, particularly during the college years, creates a bond born of shared experiences and precious memories.</p><p>\u201cDaniel!\u201d</p><p>Daniel Walker is a mammoth-sized guy. he and Arnold Schwarzenegger could totally be brothers. But don\u2019t let that fool you. he\u2019s like one of those Werther\u2019s candies\u2014hard on the outside, soft and gooey on the inside.</p><p>he\u2019s affectionate. Giving. Compassionate.</p><p>During our junior year, a mouse decided to move into our ramshackle house. All of us voted to kill it\u2014except Daniel. he constructed a trap with string, cardboard, and a stick that would have made the Little Rascals proud.</p><p>And he actually caught the little bugger. We kept him. In a cage, kind of like a mascot. We named him Bud after our favorite beer.</p><p>Daniel pulls me into a bear hug, picks me up, and spins me around. Then he sets me on my feet and kisses my cheek. \u201cIt\u2019s so good to see you, Kate. You look great!\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m smiling so hard, my face hurts. \u201cThanks, Daniel. You too.</p><p>You haven\u2019t changed a bit. how\u2019s everything going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t complain. Things are good\u2014busy. I\u2019m still interviewing at hospitals.\u201d</p><p>Daniel\u2019s an anesthesiologist. Whenever they can, he and Bob work together. Like me and Drew.</p><p>he goes on. \u201cBut Bobbie\u2019s practice is booming, so I\u2019m the gofer boy for now.\u201d he holds up a bag of Chinese takeout.</p><p>When the smell hits my stomach, it twists, letting me know it is not pleased. I swallow hard.</p><p>he throws a heavy arm over my shoulders and we chat for a several minutes. About their move , about Delores and Billy. I tell him about Drew and how I want the four of us to get together for dinner.</p><p>And then there\u2019s a loud screech of rubber tires.</p><p>We both turn and watch the taillights of a speeding car disappear out of the parking lot.</p><p>Daniel shakes his head. \u201cAnd I thought Philadelphia drivers were bad.\u201d</p><p>I chuckle. \u201cOh, no\u2014New Yorkers have the monopoly on bad driving. And crazy baseball fans. Don\u2019t wear your Philly\u2019s jersey here; it could end in bloodshed.\u201d</p><p>Daniel laughs and we head into the building.</p><p>Well, it\u2019s official.</p><p>Life as I know it is over.</p><p>I\u2019m pregnant. Knocked up. The bun is in the oven and that bad boy is baking. I wasn\u2019t really surprised. Just hoping I was wrong.</p><p>According to Bobbie, my antibiotics were the culprit. They lower the effectiveness of birth control pills.</p><p>So you see what I was saying about those pamphlets? Read \u2019em. Learn \u2019em. Live \u2019em.</p><p>It\u2019s too soon to do an ultrasound, so I have to come back in two weeks. And every day I also have to take prenatal vitamins that are big enough to choke a large elephant.</p><p>Lucky me.</p><p>I park my car in the garage, but I don\u2019t go up to the apartment.</p><p>One of the best parts of living in the city is that there\u2019s always someplace that\u2019s open, somewhere to walk to with people around.</p><p>I head out onto the sidewalk and walk a few blocks, trying to clear my head. Trying to figure out what the hell I\u2019m supposed to do now.</p><p>If you\u2019re wondering why I don\u2019t sound happy, it\u2019s because I\u2019m not. You have to understand\u2014I was never that girl. I didn\u2019t play with baby dolls; I played with my parents\u2019 cash register. When the other kids wanted to go to Toys\u201cR\u201dUs? I wanted to go to Staples. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Even before my craving for financial independence began, my dreams revolved around office buildings and desks\u2014not cradles and baby carriages. It\u2019s not that I don\u2019t want children. I just don\u2019t want one now. Now was not part of the plan.</p><p>And then there\u2019s Drew. he loves me, I know. But pregnancy changes things. It means stretch marks and saggy boobs and sleepless nights. No more spontaneous vacations. No more sex marathons.</p><p>he\u2019s going to freak out. Definitely.</p><p>I sit down on a bench and watch the cars drive by.</p> <p>Then a voice to my right grabs my attention.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s a good boy? Andrew is! My sweet boy.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s a woman with soft blond curls and dark eyes, about my age.</p><p>And she\u2019s holding a doe-headed bundle of drool.</p><p>Do you believe in signs? I don\u2019t.</p> <p>But my grandmother did. She was an incredible woman\u2014a respected archeologist who did extensive study on the southern Native American tribes. I worshipped my grandma. She once told me that signs were all around us. Guides to point us in the right direction, toward our fate. Our destiny. That all we had to do was open our eyes and our hearts, and we would find our way.</p><p>So I watch the young mother and her child. And then a man comes up to them.</p><p>\u201chey. Sorry I\u2019m late. Damn meeting ran over.\u201d</p><p>I assume he\u2019s her husband. he kisses her. Then he takes the bundle from her and holds it up over his head.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s my guy. hey, buddy.\u201d</p><p>And his smile is so warm, so beautiful, it literally takes my breath away. The golden couple lean against each other tenderly, the baby between them, pulling them together like a magnet.</p> <p>I feel like a voyeur, but the moment is so precious I can\u2019t look away.</p><p>And that\u2019s when it hits me. I\u2019m not just pregnant. I\u2019m having a baby. Drew and I made a baby. A whole new person.</p><p>And an image appears in my head. So clear. So perfect.</p><p>A dark-haired little boy, with Drew\u2019s smart-ass smile and my sparkling personality. A part of each of us.</p><p>The best parts.</p><p>I think about the way Steven looked at Alexandra last night when they announced the big news. I picture the way Drew watches me when he thinks I\u2019m not looking. And the way he cuddled with Mackenzie when she fell asleep beside him on the couch. I remember how wonderful it feels to teach her to play the guitar.</p><p>And how amazing it would be to teach a baby . . . everything.</p><p>Drew would adore having a small someone to show things to\u2014like how to play chess, and basketball.</p> <p>And how to curse in four different languages.</p><p>Drew isn\u2019t Joey Martino. his family means everything to him.</p><p>I mean everything to him.</p><p>And I\u2019m having his baby. Oh my God. The pregnancy hormones must be on overload, because tears fill my eyes and stream down my cheeks. happy tears.</p><p>Because it\u2019s going to be okay.</p><p>Maybe I will have stretch marks, but this is New York\u2014the plastic surgery capital of the world. And sure, there are things I want to accomplish professionally. And I will. Because Drew will be there to help me. To support me. Like he has since the day I met him.</p><p>he\u2019s going to be excited\u2014like a kid getting an unexpected gift on Christmas morning. It\u2019ll be a shock at first, but can\u2019t you just see him? Elated. Overjoyed.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me, miss, are you all right?\u201d I must be crying louder than I thought, because Baby-Daddy is looking at me with concern.</p><p>I wipe at my cheeks, embarrassed. \u201cYes, I\u2019m fine. I\u2019m just . . .\u201d</p><p>I gaze at their child. \u201che\u2019s just so beautiful. You\u2019re all so beautiful.\u201d</p><p>I break down in a round of fresh sobs, and the mother takes a step back.</p><p>Great. Now I\u2019m the crazy lady on a bench.</p><p>She asks, \u201cIs there someone you need us to call?\u201d</p><p>I take a breath and pull myself together. And then I smile. \u201cNo.</p><p>I\u2019m all right. Really. It\u2019s just . . . I\u2019m having a baby.\u201d</p><p>There.</p><p>I said it.</p><p>Sure, I just said it to two perfect strangers, which is a little messed up, but still. Am I scared? Of course I am. But I\u2019ve never run from a challenge in my life\u2014why would I start now?</p><p>\u201cWell, congratulations, and good luck to you, miss.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>The family turns and walks down the street together. As I watch them go, a store display to the right catches my eye. It\u2019s a Yankee merchandise store, and in the window is a teeny-tiny T-shirt that says, FUTURE YANKEES PITChER. And my excitement blooms like a flower in a rainforest.</p><p>Because now I know just how I\u2019m going to tell Drew.</p><p>Chapter 6</p><p>What do you know about ESP? Extrasensory Perception; the knowledge of an incident before it takes place. We all have a little bit of it\u2014that other ninety percent of our brains we don\u2019t use.</p><p>It\u2019s those times in the car when you think of a song you haven\u2019t heard in years, and it\u2019s the next one that comes on the radio. It\u2019s those mornings when you picture an old friend and at dinnertime the phone rings, and it\u2019s the friend you were thinking of.</p><p>I was never a big believer in that sort of thing. But as the store clerk handed me my change for the tiny T-shirt, a ball of anxiety settled deep in my gut.</p><p>And it wasn\u2019t normal butterflies. It was urgent. Desperate unease, like when you realize you forgot to pay a credit card bill.</p><p>I had to get to Drew. I had to talk to him\u2014to tell him\u2014and it had to be now. I walked quickly down the street. Well . . . as quickly as I could in three-inch heels.</p><p>As every step carried me closer to our building, the worry increased exponentially.</p><p>At the time I chalked it up to the news I was about to break.</p><p>But looking back now, I think it was something else.</p><p>Precognition.</p><p>By the time I stood outside our apartment door, my knees were shaking and my palms were sweaty. Then I reached for the knob. . . .</p><p>If you have a weak stomach? You may not want to watch this.</p><p>It won\u2019t be pretty.</p><p>I step into the apartment. The lights are out. I put my keys on the table and take off my coat. I flick the switch on the wall, flooding the room with light.</p><p>And that\u2019s when I see him.</p><p>Them.</p><p>Drew is standing in the middle of our living room, his dress shirt unbuttoned, exposing the chest that I\u2019ve traced my fingers over a thousand times. The warm, bronze skin I love to touch. he has a half-empty bottle of Jack Daniel\u2019s in one hand. And the other hand is hidden. Buried.</p><p>In a mane of wavy auburn hair.</p><p>She\u2019s the opposite of me in every way. Thick red tresses, br**sts the size of watermelons, perky in their fakeness. She\u2019s tall\u2014as tall as Drew\u2014even without the stilettos. her lips are red and lush, plump enough to make Angelina Jolie envious. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>And those plump red lips are moving against Drew\u2019s mouth.</p><p>Good kissers, really good kissers, don\u2019t just use their lips. They utilize their entire body\u2014their tongue, their hands, their hips.</p><p>Drew is a good kisser.</p><p>But I\u2019ve never had the chance to observe him in action. I\u2019ve never seen him kiss anyone. Because I\u2019ve always been on the receiving end. The kissee.</p> <p>But that\u2019s not the case now.</p><p>I stand there\u2014stunned. Watching. And though it\u2019s only for a few seconds, it feels like forever. Like an eternity.</p><p>In hell.</p><p>Then Drew pulls back. And almost as if he knew I was here all along, his eyes find mine immediately. They\u2019re hard. Merciless.</p><p>And his voice is as cold as the steel of an outdoor gate in a snowstorm.</p> <p>\u201cLook who\u2019s home.\u201d</p><p>Lots of women imagine how they would react if they caught their boyfriend or husband cheating. What they would say. how strong they\u2019d be.</p><p>Righteous and indignant.</p><p>But when it\u2019s for real? When it\u2019s not just pretend predictions?</p><p>Those emotions are peculiarly absent.</p><p>I\u2019m numb inside.</p> <p>Dead.</p><p>And my voice is nothing more than a whispered stutter.</p><p>\u201cWhat . . . what are you doing?\u201d</p><p>Drew shrugs. \u201cJust having a little fun. I figured, why should you be the only one who gets to?\u201d</p><p>I hear the words, but I don\u2019t understand them. My eyes squint and my head tilts, like a bewildered dog.</p><p>Drew steps away from the redhead and takes a swig from the bottle. he flinches as he swallows.</p><p>\u201cYou look confused, Kate. I\u2019ll explain. The first rule of lying is always get the alibi straight. See\u2014right now, Matthew and Dolores are on a plane to Vegas. Matthew\u2019s been planning the trip for weeks\u2014a surprise second honeymoon. So I knew you were full of shit this afternoon. I just needed to see if you\u2019d actually go through with it. So I followed you. Gotta love the GPS.\u201d</p><p>Last year, a woman named Kasey Dunkin disappeared after a night out with friends in the city. It was all over the news. The police were able to trace her cell to an abandoned warehouse in Brooklyn, and even though she\u2019d been stabbed multiple times, she survived. Drew and I had the same kind of program installed on our phones the next day.</p> <p>\u201cYou followed me?\u201d</p><p>he followed me to Bob\u2019s office. he knows where I went. Does that mean . . .</p><p>\u201cYep. I know where you were. I know everything. I f**king saw you.\u201d</p><p>he knows. . . . Drew knows I\u2019m pregnant.</p><p>And obviously he\u2019s not pleased.</p><p>My voice rises as I speak, gaining momentum. \u201cYou know?\u201d I point at the woman who\u2019s watching us like we\u2019re her own personal soap opera. \u201cAnd this is how you react?\u201d</p><p>Drew looks confused. \u201cDo you frigging even know me at all?</p><p>how the f**k did you think I\u2019d react?\u201d</p><p>I\u2019ve seen Drew annoyed before.</p><p>Thoughtless.</p><p>Frustrated.</p><p>But this is different.</p><p>This is . . . cruel.</p><p>he asks me, \u201cYou\u2019re not even gonna try and deny it? Make me think I\u2019m delusional?\u201d For a moment his face crumples. And he looks . . . anguished\u2014like a torture victim about to break his silence. \u201cAren\u2019t you going to tell me I\u2019m wrong, Kate?\u201d</p><p>he blinks and the anguished look is gone. And I\u2019m pretty sure I just imagined it.</p><p>Wishful thinking.</p><p>I fold my arms across my chest. \u201cI won\u2019t discuss this with you in front of an audience.\u201d</p><p>Drew\u2019s jaw locks stubbornly. \u201cAre you going to end it?\u201d</p><p>My feet move back away from him, all on their own.</p><p>And my hand drops protectively to my abdomen.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>he repeats himself, impatient with my shock. \u201cI said\u2014are you going to f**king end it?\u201d</p><p>Politically, Drew is pro-choice. Despite his Catholic upbringing, he respects and loves the women in his family far too much to let some old man on Capitol hill dictate what they can or can\u2019t do with their bodies.</p><p>But emotionally\u2014morally\u2014I\u2019ve always thought he was prolife. So the fact that he\u2019s standing here telling me to abort a child, our child, is just . . . incomprehensible.</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t . . . I haven\u2019t had time to think about it.\u201d</p><p>he laughs bitterly. \u201cWell, you better start thinking, because until your little indiscretion is out of the picture? I don\u2019t even want to f**king look at you\u2014let alone discuss anything.\u201d</p><p>his words hit me like a gust of wind on a cold day. The kind that leaves you breathless.</p><p>Drew isn\u2019t Joey Martino.</p><p>he\u2019s worse.</p><p>Because he wants me to choose. An ultimatum. Like he did with Billy.</p><p>And what the hell is he talking about\u2014 my indiscretion? Like I made it happen all by myself?</p><p>And then it sinks in\u2014his anger. his vindictiveness. It starts to make sense.</p><p>\u201cDo you think I planned this? That I did it on purpose?\u201d</p><p>he smirks, and even a deaf person would be able to hear the sarcasm. \u201cNo\u2014of course not. These things just happen sometimes, right? Even when you don\u2019t mean them to.\u201d</p><p>I open my mouth to argue, to explain, but the stripper\u2019s giggle cuts me off. I glare at her. \u201cGet out of my house before I put you out with the rest of the trash.\u201d</p><p>In situations like this? Women can cut each other down faster than a tree dealer on Christmas Eve. But it\u2019s not because we\u2019re petty. Or catty.</p><p>It\u2019s because it\u2019s easier to go after a nameless woman than to admit that the true fault lies with the man who was supposed to love you. Who was supposed to be committed. Faithful.</p><p>And wasn\u2019t.</p><p>She says, \u201cSorry, honey, you\u2019re not paying for this show. I go where the money man tells me.\u201d</p><p>Drew loops an arm around her waist and smiles proudly. \u201cShe\u2019s not going anywhere. We\u2019re just getting started.\u201d</p><p>I find the strength to raise a brow. And try to land a shot of my own.</p><p>\u201cPaying for it now, Drew? Isn\u2019t that pathetic.\u201d</p><p>he smirks. \u201cDon\u2019t kid yourself, sweetheart\u2014I\u2019ve been paying for it for the last two years too. You\u2019ve just been slightly more expensive than the average whore.\u201d</p><p>I should have known better. Arguing with Drew is like dealing with a terrorist. he has no boundaries; nothing\u2019s off limits. There are no depths he won\u2019t sink to to win.</p><p>Then he looks thoughtful.</p><p>\u201cAlthough I must say, despite how everything\u2019s turned out, you were money well spent. Especially that night, against the kitchen sink\u201d\u2014he winks\u2014\u201cworth every penny.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I\u2019m dying.

You shouldn\u2019t be.</p><p>Drew Evans doesn\u2019t burn bridges. he sets dy***ite to them.</p><p>Decimating the bridge, the mountains it connects, and any other living thing unlucky enough to be within a fifty-mile radius.</p> <p>Drew never does anything halfway. Why should destroying me be any different?</p><p>I turn to walk down the hall before I crumble in front of him like an Egyptian pyramid.</p><p>But he grabs my arm. \u201cWhere are you going, Kate? Stick around\u2014maybe you can learn a new trick.\u201d</p><p>You know how someone\u2019s personality can make him more attractive? Like that kid in high school who, despite the lack of muscle tone and the case of mild acne, was able to run with the popular crowd? Because he told the funniest jokes and had the best stories.</p><p>I wish I could tell you it worked in reverse. I wish I could say that Drew\u2019s words magically transformed his face into the monstrosity he sounds like.</p> <p>But I can\u2019t.</p><p>Look at him.</p><p>I imagine this is what Lucifer looked like when God tossed him out of heaven. Bitter and broken.</p><p>But still so achingly beautiful.</p><p>I pull my arm free. And my voice is high-pitched, almost hysterical. \u201cDon\u2019t touch me! Don\u2019t you ever f**king touch me again!\u201d</p><p>he smiles slowly, the very picture of serenity. he wipes his hand on his pants, like he just handled something dirty.</p> <p>\u201cThat really won\u2019t be a problem for me.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m going to be sick. I\u2019m going to throw up all over his black Bruno Magli shoes.</p><p>And it\u2019s got nothing to do with the pregnancy.</p><p>I go down the hall, forcing myself to walk. Because I refuse to let Drew see me run from him.</p><p>I barely make it to the bathroom in time.</p><p>I drop to my knees and hold on to the toilet for dear life. A nail breaks and my knuckles turn white. My stomach contracts and I heave violently. Blood pounds in my ears and acid burns my throat.</p><p>I cough and I sob, but my eyes are dry. There are no tears.</p><p>Not yet. That part comes later.</p> <p>how can he do this? he told me he wouldn\u2019t . . . and I trusted him. When he said he loved me. When he promised he\u2019d never hurt me.</p><p>I believed him.</p><p>We never talked about having kids. We never talked about not having them either. But if I had known he\u2019d be this way, I would have been more careful. I would have . . .</p><p>God.</p><p>Listen to me. My boyfriend is in the living room with another woman on his lap, and I\u2019m sitting here thinking of all the things I could have done to keep it from happening?</p><p>And I called Drew pathetic.</p><p>When there\u2019s nothing left in my stomach, I pull myself up to the sink and look in the mirror. Splotchy cheeks and dull redrimmed eyes stare back at me from a face I don\u2019t recognize.</p><p>I douse my face with cold water, over and over. Drew may have ripped me apart\u2014turned me into a quivering mass of shame and self-recrimination\u2014but it\u2019ll be a cold day in hell before I let him see that.</p><p>I stumble to the bedroom, grab a duffel bag out of the closet, and blindly fill it with the first things my hands touch. I have to get away. From him. From everything that reminds me of him.</p><p>I know what you\u2019re thinking. \u201cYour career, everything you\u2019ve worked for\u2014you\u2019re throwing it all away.\u201d</p><p>And you\u2019re right\u2014I am. But none of that matters anymore.</p><p>It\u2019s like . . . like those poor people who jumped from the towers on September eleventh. They knew it wouldn\u2019t save them, but the fire was too hot and they had to do something, anything, to get away from the pain.</p><p>I zip the bag shut and put it on my shoulder. Then I brace my hand against the door and I breathe. Once. Twice. Three times.</p><p>I can do this. I just have to make it to the door. It\u2019s only a dozen steps away.</p><p>I walk down the hall.</p><p>Drew is sitting on the couch, legs spread, eyes on the dancing woman swaying in front of him, the bottle of Jack beside him. I focus on his face. And for just a moment, I let myself remember.</p><p>Grieve.</p><p>I see his smile\u2014that first night in the bar\u2014so boyishly charming. I feel his lips, his touch, the first night we made love, here, in this apartment. All heat and need. I relive every tender word, every loving moment since then.</p><p>And I lock it all away.</p><p>In a box of steel, banished to the farthest corner of my mind.</p><p>To be opened later. When I\u2019m able to fall apart.</p><p>I step into the room and stop just a few feet from the couch.</p><p>Redhead dances on, but I don\u2019t look at her. My eyes never leave Drew\u2019s face.</p><p>My voice is raw. Scratchy. But surprisingly resolute.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m done. With you, with all of this. Don\u2019t track me down a week from now and tell me you\u2019re sorry. Do not call me and say you\u2019ve changed your mind. We. Are. Over. And I never want to see you again.\u201d</p><p>how many parents have told their teenagers that they\u2019re grounded forever? how many teenagers have responded that they\u2019ll never speak to them again?</p><p>Over. Forever. Never.</p><p>Such big words. So final.</p><p>So hollow.</p><p>We don\u2019t really mean them. They\u2019re just things you say when you\u2019re looking for a reaction. Begging for a response. The truth is, if Drew came to me tomorrow or next month, or six months from now, and told me he\u2019d made a mistake? That he wanted me back?</p><p>I\u2019d take him back in a heartbeat.</p><p>So do you see now what I was saying before? I\u2019m not a strong woman.</p><p>I\u2019m just really good at acting like one.</p><p>Drew\u2019s voice is blunt. \u201cSounds good.\u201d he toasts me with the bottle. \u201chave a rotten f**king life, Kate. And lock the door on your way out\u2014I don\u2019t want any more interruptions.\u201d</p><p>I want to tell you he hesitated. That there was a hint of regret on his face or a shadow of sadness in his eyes. I would stay if there was.</p><p>But his face is blank. Lifeless\u2014like a dark-haired Ken doll.</p><p>And I want to scream. I want to shake him and slap him and smash things. I want to, but I don\u2019t. Because if you try and hit a brick wall? All you\u2019ll get is a broken hand.</p><p>So I pick up my bag and lift my chin. And then I walk out the door.</p><p>Chapter 7</p><p>The defining characteristic of a Type-A personality is having goals and having the strategies to achieve those goals. I\u2019m most definitely a Type A.</p><p>Planning is my religion; the To-Do List is my bible.</p><p>But as I reach the middle of the lobby of the building that has been my home for the last two years, I freeze.

Whatever the reason, a father\u2019s endorsement is important\u2014it carries more weight.</p><p>When I was ten, the Greenville Parks and Recreation Department had Little League tryouts. Without a son to pour his baseball dreams into, my dad spent his time teaching me the finer points of the game. I was a tomboy anyway, so it wasn\u2019t hard.</p><p>And that year, my father thought I was too good to play softball with the girls. That the boy\u2019s league would be more of a challenge.</p><p>And I believed it. Because he believed it.</p><p>Because he believed in me.</p><p>Billy made fun of me; he said I was going to get my nose broken. Delores came to watch and paint her nails on the bleachers. I made the team. And when the season ended, I had the best pitching record in the whole league. My dad was so proud, he put my trophy next to the cash register at the diner and bragged to anyone who wanted to listen. And even to those who didn\u2019t.</p><p>Three years later, he was gone.</p><p>And it was crippling because, like a blind person who at one time could see, I knew exactly what I was missing. I never played baseball again.</p><p>Then later, I met John Evans. he picked me\u2014chose me\u2014out of a thousand applicants. he nurtured my career. he was proud of every deal I closed, every success.</p><p>And for just a moment, I knew how it felt to have a father again.</p><p>And John brought me to Drew. And our lives intertwined, like ivy around a tree. You know how it is\u2014his family became my family, and all that comes with it. Anne\u2019s gentle admonishments, Alexandra\u2019s protectiveness, Steven\u2019s jokes, Matthew\u2019s teasing . . . sweet Mackenzie.</p><p>And now I\u2019ve lost all them too.</p><p>Because although I don\u2019t think they\u2019ll agree with what Drew has done, how he\u2019s treated me, you know the saying: Blood is thicker.

Are you ready?\u201d</p><p>Before I fold the letter, I scribble two words under my signature.

If I had to guess, I\u2019d say Drew just wasn\u2019t ready to grow up\u2014to take on that level of responsibility. Of commitment.</p><p>Look at my hand. Do you see a ring? That\u2019s not an accident.</p><p>he\u2019s a wonderful uncle to Mackenzie. Dedicated. Nurturing.</p><p>The kind of man who would beat the hell out of another shopper for the last Tickle Me Elmo or Cabbage Patch Kids doll, two days before Christmas. he\u2019d do anything for her.</p> <p>But being a father is different. It\u2019s all on you and yet nothing is ever about you again. And that\u2019s the part I think Drew couldn\u2019t handle.</p><p>Personally, I blame Anne and Alexandra. Don\u2019t get me wrong, they\u2019re good people, but . . . let me put it this way: Last summer, Alexandra had us all up to her parents\u2019 country place for Mackenzie\u2019s birthday. Drew and I got there late because we pulled over on a deserted road to make out.</p><p>By the way\u2014car sex? It\u2019s a wonderful thing. If you ever want to feel young and uninhibited, do it in the backseat. But I digress.</p><p>So there we are, hanging out by the pool, and I get up to grab a slice of pizza. But does Drew get up? Of course not. Because his mother has already heated him a crispy, fresh slice in the kitchen.</p><p>And his sister brought it right to his lounge chair\u2014with a cold beer.</p> <p>Were his legs broken? Was he suffering from some early onset Parkinson\u2019s disease that made it impossible for him to heat up his own food? Or\u2014God forbid\u2014eat it cold? No. That\u2019s just the way they are with him, the way they\u2019ve always been.</p><p>Coddling. Overindulgent.</p><p>And I can\u2019t help but think that if Anne and Alexandra had let him get his own goddamn pizza once in a while, then maybe he would have taken the news better. Been more prepared.</p><p>In the end, it doesn\u2019t really matter. Knowing why doesn\u2019t change anything. So as I passed the WELCOME TO GREENVILLE sign, I promised myself that I wouldn\u2019t ever ask why again. I wouldn\u2019t waste the energy.</p><p>But you know something? God has a sick sense of humor.</p><p>Because I would be asking why again in just a few short days.</p> <p>For a completely different and infinitely more devastating reason.</p><p>Sorry to be the one to tell you this, but yes\u2014it does actually get worse.</p><p>You\u2019ll see.</p><p>have you ever visited your high school years after you graduated?</p><p>And the desks and the windows and the walls are the same . . . yet it still looks different? Smaller somehow.</p><p>That\u2019s what this feels like.</p><p>Driving down Main Street, coming home, it\u2019s all exactly like I remember it . . . but not. The red awning outside Mr. Reynold\u2019s hardware store is green now. Falcone Pharmacy turned into a Rite Aid. But the gaudy pink palm tree is still in the window of Penny\u2019s Beauty Salon where Delores and I got our nails done before prom.</p><p>The old green park bench is still there, too, outside my parents\u2019 restaurant, where I used to chain my bike after school.</p> <p>I park the car and get out, my duffel bag hanging on my shoulder. It\u2019s a little after noon, and the sun is high and hot, and air smells like sand and burning tar. I cross the street and open the door. The hum of conversation simmers down as I stand at the entrance, and a dozen friendly, familiar faces look me over.</p><p>Most of the people in this room have known me since I was born. To them, I\u2019m Nate and Carol\u2019s daughter\u2014the small-town, dark haired, pigtailed girl who made good. Who beat the financial odds and did her family proud. I\u2019m the success story the grade school teachers tell their students about, in the hopes of inspiring them to bigger dreams than the automobile factory has to offer.</p><p>I force my lips to smile politely, nodding and waving brief greetings as I make my way between the tables, toward the door in the back. See the sign?</p><p>EMPLOYEES ONLY.</p><p>I blow out a big breath. And all the anger that kept me going\u2014 that got me here\u2014goes out with it. Exhaustion swamps me. And I feel drained, empty. My limbs are boneless, like I just crossed the finish line of a ten-mile uphill marathon.</p><p>I push the door open. And the first thing I see is my mother, bent over a table, scanning a produce delivery list.</p><p>Beautiful, isn\u2019t she? I know most daughters think their mothers are pretty\u2014but mine really is. her dark brown hair is pulled into a high ponytail, like mine. her skin is fair and clear, with the barest of lines around her lips and eyes. If wrinkles are hereditary, I\u2019ve hit the genetic jackpot.</p><p>But beyond her looks, my mother\u2019s beautiful on the inside. It sounds clich\u00e9d, but it\u2019s true. She\u2019s unchanging. Steady. Dependable. Life hasn\u2019t always been easy for her\u2014or kind. But she moved forward, carried on, with dignity and grace. My mother isn\u2019t an optimist. She\u2019s stoic, like a statue that\u2019s still standing after a hur-ricane.</p><p>The door swings closed behind me and she lifts her head. her eyes light up and she smiles big. \u201cKate!\u201d She puts the list down and moves toward me.</p><p>Then she sees my face. And the corners of her smile fall like a feather in the wind. her voice is hushed and laced with concern.</p><p>\u201cKate, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>My arms give up, and my bag drops to the floor.</p><p>She takes another step.</p><p>\u201cKatie? honey? What happened?\u201d</p><p>Now, there is an excellent question. I should answer\u2014but I can\u2019t. Because my hands are covering my face. And the only sounds that escape my lips are gasping sobs.</p><p>her arms pull me forward, strong and warm and smelling of Downy April Freshness. And she holds me, tight and secure, like only a mother can.</p><p>Remember the steel box? Yeah, it\u2019s open now. And everything that happened comes spilling out of it.</p><p>Chapter 9</p><p>The average human being spends a third of their life in bed.</p><p>Eight thousand, three hundred, thirty-three days. Two hundred thousand hours.</p><p>Why am I telling you this? Because you should never feel bad about spending a lot of money on decent bed linens. A good blanket is priceless. When you\u2019re young, it protects you from the boogeyman. And when you\u2019re not so young, it keeps your old bones warm.</p><p>My mother pulls my down comforter up to my chin, tucking me into my childhood bed, like a six-year-old during a thunderstorm.</p><p>After my meltdown in the break room, she brought me upstairs to the small but quaint two-bedroom apartment above the diner where I was raised. Where my mother still lives. The home of my youth.</p><p>She wipes at the tears that stream down my cheeks. I hiccup and stutter, \u201cI-I-I\u2019m . . . s-so . . . s-s-stupid.\u201d</p><p>I was valedictorian of my high school class. I graduated from harvard Law School. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Ignorance is not something I\u2019m familiar with. So I can\u2019t help but feel that I should have known\u2014should\u2019ve seen this coming.</p><p>After all, I lived with Drew for two years. how long does it take for a leopard to change its spots?</p><p>Oh, that\u2019s right\u2014they don\u2019t.</p><p>My mother brushes my hair back from my face. \u201chush now, Katie.\u201d</p> <p>My eyes are swollen and my nose is stuffed, making my voice sound nasally and childlike. \u201cW-w-what . . . am I . . . g-g-going to do, Mom?\u201d</p><p>She smiles calmly, like she has all the answers. Like she has the power to take away any hurt\u2014even this one\u2014as easily as she used to kiss away the pain of my bumped shins and scraped knees.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to sleep now. You\u2019re so tired.\u201d</p><p>She continues running her fingers through my hair. It\u2019s soothing. Relaxing. \u201cSleep now. . . . Go to sleep my sweet, sweet girl.\u201d</p><p>My father taught me to play the guitar, but I get my voice from my mother. Lying in bed, I close my heavy eyes as she sings. It\u2019s a Melissa Etheridge song about angels knowing that everything will be all right. It\u2019s the same song she sang to me the night my father died\u2014the night she slept in this bed with me. Because she couldn\u2019t bear to sleep in their bed alone.</p> <p>With my mother\u2019s voice in my ears, I finally let go.</p><p>And fall asleep.</p><p>You know when you have a fever? And you lie in bed, and toss and roll and twist the sheets around your legs? You\u2019re not really sleeping, but you\u2019re not really awake either. There\u2019s moments of consciousness, when you open your eyes and realize with disoriented wonder that it\u2019s dark outside. But for the most part it\u2019s just a foggy blur.</p><p>That\u2019s what the next two days were like for me. A montage of sunlight and moonlight, of tears and vomiting and trays of food being taken away untouched.</p><p>The moments in that space between wakefulness and slumber were the hardest. When I\u2019d start to believe it was all some horrible nightmare conjured from watching too many 90210 reruns. I\u2019d feel a pillow against my back and swear it was Drew behind me.</p><p>he gives the best wake-up calls\u2014it\u2019s our own little tradition. Every morning he presses up against me and whispers in my ear, worshipping me with his words and with his hands.</p> <p>But then I would open my eyes and see that the pillow was just a pillow. And it felt like a newly formed scab being torn off\u2014I bled a little more each time.</p><p>There just aren\u2019t words to describe how I missed him. None that could even come close.</p><p>I physically ached for his smile, his scent, his voice.</p><p>Imagine a car\u2019s going sixty miles an hour down a country road and a tree falls and the car hits it. Boom\u2014instant stoppage. But if the person in the driver\u2019s seat isn\u2019t wearing a seat belt? They\u2019re still going sixty.</p><p>And that\u2019s what love is like.</p><p>It doesn\u2019t just stop. No matter how hurt or wronged or angry you are\u2014the love\u2019s still there.</p><p>Sending you right through the windshield.</p><p>On the evening of the second day, I open my eyes and stare out the window. It doesn\u2019t rain often in Greenville, but it\u2019s drizzling now.</p> <p>Fitting\u2014what with the black cloud over my head and everything.</p><p>Then I hear my bedroom door open. I roll over. \u201cMom, could you . . .\u201d</p><p>Only it\u2019s not my mother standing there. My voice is quiet, softly surprised. \u201cOh\u2014hey, George.\u201d</p><p>You remember George Reinhart, don\u2019t you? Steven\u2019s widower father? he and my mom are together. They hooked up at Matthew and Delores\u2019s wedding.</p><p>Don\u2019t worry\u2014I\u2019ve tried to block that part out too.</p><p>But they\u2019ve been going strong about a year now. In spite of George\u2019s best efforts, my mother refuses to move to New York. She says Greenville is her home, that she likes her independence. So George comes down here pretty often to visit\u2014weeks at a time.</p><p>And my mom reciprocates when she can.</p><p>George is a good guy. he\u2019s kind of like Jimmy Stewart in It\u2019s a Wonderful Life\u2014a little on the dorky side, sure, but decent. The kind of man you\u2019d want looking after your mom.</p><p>his glasses sit crookedly on his face as he holds up a tray. \u201cYour mother\u2019s swamped downstairs, but she thought you might like a cup of tea.\u201d</p><p>Running your own business isn\u2019t as easy as it looks. Yeah, you\u2019re your own boss\u2014but that means no calling out sick, no playing hooky. And if an employee doesn\u2019t show up? You\u2019re the one who has to pick up the slack.</p><p>George tries hard to help out with the diner. Last week my mom had to drive Jose, the cook, to the hospital after he sliced his hand open chopping potatoes. And George tried to fill in for him.</p><p>No one was injured\u2014but the fire department had to come to put out flames, and the diner closed early because of the smoke.</p><p>Still, I guess it\u2019s the thought that counts.</p><p>I sit up and adjust the pillows behind me. \u201cTea would be great.</p><p>Thank you.\u201d</p><p>he puts the tray on my nightstand and hands me a warm cup.</p><p>Then he wipes his hands on his pants nervously.</p><p>\u201cMay I sit?\u201d</p><p>I take a sip and nod. And George plops down in the beanbag chair beside my bed. he adjusts his glasses and wiggles around to get comfy.</p><p>I almost smile.</p><p>Then he looks at me for a few seconds, trying to find a way to start. I save him the trouble. \u201cMom told you, didn\u2019t she?\u201d</p><p>he nods solemnly. \u201cDon\u2019t be upset with her. She\u2019s worried about you, Kate. She needed to vent. I would never divulge your personal information to anyone.\u201d he taps his temple with one finger. \u201cIt\u2019s in the vault.\u201d</p><p>I actually manage to chuckle, because he reminds me so much of his son, Steven.</p><p>And then my smile fades, because he reminds me so much of Steven.</p><p>\u201cJohn called me. Asking about you. I told him you were here.\u201d</p><p>My eyes rise sharply. Questioning.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t tell him why you were here\u2014not exactly. I told him you were worn out. Burnt out. It\u2019s not uncommon in our field.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t have a plan regarding the Evans. Technically, I\u2019m carrying their grandchild, a part of their family. And even if their son feels otherwise, I have no doubt that Anne and John will want to be a part of its life.</p><p>But I can\u2019t think about that. Not yet.</p><p>George continues. \u201che\u2019d like you to call him when you\u2019re feeling up to it. And he wanted me to tell you that he unequivocally rejects your resignation.\u201d</p><p>My brow furrows. \u201cCan he do that?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>George shrugs. \u201cJohn does what John wants.\u201d</p><p>Boy, does that sound familiar.</p><p>\u201che said he can\u2019t afford to lose both of his best investment bankers.\u201d</p><p>Wait\u2014 both?</p> <p>\u201cWhat does that mean? has Drew not been going to work?\u201d</p><p>A small, wishful flame flickers in my stomach. Maybe Drew is just as devastated as I am. Maybe he\u2019s gone into hibernation again\u2014like he did the last time.</p><p>George quickly douses my poor little flame. \u201cNo, no he\u2019s been there . . .\u201d</p><p>Damn it.</p><p>\u201c. . . twice, actually. And drunker than a longshoreman on leave, from what I heard. When John asked him about your resignation letter, Drew told him to mind his own business\u2014in his own colorful way, of course. Needless to say, his future at the firm is . . .</p> <p>fluid . . . at the moment.\u201d</p><p>I interpret this information the only way I can, considering who Drew was keeping company with the last time I saw him.</p><p>\u201cWow. he must be having a really good time if he\u2019s still drunk the morning after.\u201d</p><p>George tilts his head to the side. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t quite look at it that way, Kate.\u201d</p><p>I clench my jaw stubbornly. And lie. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter. I don\u2019t care anymore.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s a moment of silence, and George stares at the pattern on the teacup. Then he purses his lips. And his voice is hushed\u2014 reverent\u2014like talking in church. \u201cI don\u2019t know how much Drew told you about my Janey.\u201d</p> <p>Quite a lot, actually. Janey Reinhart was a wonderful woman\u2014 kind, bright, warm.</p><p>She was diagnosed with breast cancer when Drew was ten and fought it for four years. Drew told me the day she passed away was the day he realized that bad things really happen\u2014and not just to people you read about in the newspaper.</p><p>\u201cWhen she died . . . I wanted to die too. And I would have, if it wasn\u2019t for Steven. Because that\u2019s what children are, Kate. Life renewed.\u201d</p><p>I know he means well. Really I do. But I can\u2019t handle this.</p><p>I\u2019m not ready to deal with the speech about how lucky I am to be pregnant.</p><p>And alone.</p><p>\u201cStill . . . it was . . . awful. For a long time, it was just one terrible moment after the next. You know Steven has his mother\u2019s eyes. Looking at him is like looking at Janey. And there were some days\u2014really bad days\u2014that I almost hated him for it.\u201d</p><p>I suck in a quick breath. This isn\u2019t the pep talk I was expecting.</p> <p>\u201cBut still, time marched on. And things became . . . bearable.</p><p>I gained a daughter-in-law and a beautiful granddaughter. And eventually, it didn\u2019t hurt to breathe.\u201d</p><p>Tears creep into my eyes. Because I know what he\u2019s saying. I know that pain.</p><p>\u201cBut it wasn\u2019t until I met your mother that the part of me that died with Janey came back to life. That I was whole again.\u201d</p><p>I rub my eyes dry and scoff, \u201cSo what are you telling me, George? I\u2019ll find another Drew again? It may just take fifteen years or so?\u201d</p><p>Bitterness? Not attractive. Yeah\u2014I know.</p><p>George\u2019s shakes his head slowly. \u201cNo, Kate. You\u2019ll never find another Drew. Just like I\u2019ll never have another Janey, and your mother will never have another Nate. But . . . what I\u2019m trying to tell you is . . . the heart heals. And life goes on . . . and brings you with it . . . even if you don\u2019t want to go.\u201d</p><p>I bite my bottom lip. And nod my head. I put the cup back on the tray, ending the conversation. George pulls himself out of the beanbag chair and picks up the tray. he walks to the door, but he turns back to me before he goes through it.</p><p>\u201cI know you probably don\u2019t want to hear this right now, but . . .</p><p>I\u2019ve known Drew his whole life. I watched him grow up with Matthew and Steven and Alexandra. I\u2019m not defending him; I have no idea why he\u2019s made the choices he has. But . . . I can\u2019t help but feel sorry for him. Because one day he\u2019s going to open his eyes and realize that he\u2019s made the biggest mistake of his life. And because I love him like a son . . . the pain he\u2019s going to feel that day . . . well . . .</p><p>it breaks my heart.\u201d</p><p>he\u2019s right.</p><p>I don\u2019t want to hear this. I don\u2019t have the patience to feel sorry for Drew.</p><p>But I appreciate his effort. \u201cI\u2019m really glad you\u2019re with my mom, George. I\u2019m . . . grateful that she has you. Thank you.\u201d</p><p>he smiles warmly. \u201cI\u2019ll be close by. Just give a call if you need anything.\u201d</p><p>I nod. And he closes the door behind him.</p><p>I want to be moved by George\u2019s words. Inspired. Motivated to drag my ass out of this bed. But I\u2019m just too . . . tired. So I lay back down, wrap myself up in my blanket cocoon, and go to sleep.</p><p>On the third day, I rise again.</p><p>I don\u2019t really have much of a choice anymore. Lying around and breathing your own stench isn\u2019t exactly effective in lifting the spirits. Oh\u2014and I\u2019ve still been having morning sickness, like clockwork, in the same bucket my mother used to put beside my bed when I had a stomach virus. Yummy. Plus, I\u2019m pretty sure if I squeeze my hair, I\u2019ll have enough grease to cook up a large fry at McDonald\u2019s.</p><p>Yeah\u2014I\u2019d say it\u2019s time to get up.</p><p>I drag myself to the bathroom, my movements stiff and slow.</p><p>I take a long, hot shower\u2014almost scalding. And the steam billows out behind me as I walk back into my room.</p><p>My mom\u2019s a saver. Not like the hoarders you see on that TLC show, but she\u2019s kept all the little mementos I didn\u2019t take with me to college and beyond.</p><p>See them? On those freshly dusted shelves? Little League trophies, science fair medals, and field day ribbons, next to framed photos of Delores, Billy, and me at graduation and halloween and Delores\u2019s eighteenth birthday party.</p><p>I grab my bottle of body lotion out of my bag, but as the smell hits me I freeze. Vanilla and lavender. Drew\u2019s favorite scent. he can\u2019t get enough of it. Sometimes he drags his nose up my spine, sniffing and tickling me.</p><p>My chest tightens. And I toss the bottle in the trash can.</p><p>Glancing back to my bag, I notice my cell phone. It had been lying under the bottle of lotion, almost as if it were hiding on purpose.</p><p>It\u2019s been off since the flight. I consider calling Delores, but I quickly scrap that idea. Why ruin her vacation so she can rush home to commit premeditated murder?</p><p>Okay\u2014you\u2019re right\u2014I\u2019m lying. I haven\u2019t called Delores because there\u2019s still a small, shriveled part of me that\u2019s hoping Drew will change his mind. That he\u2019ll find a way to fix this. And I won\u2019t have to give my best friend a reason to hate him. Well . . . another reason. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I turn the phone on to find four messages waving back at me.</p><p>And there it is again.</p><p>Hope. It\u2019s becoming rather pathetic now, isn\u2019t it?</p><p>I bite my lip and take a steadying breath. And I punch in my code\u2014praying to all the angels and saints that Drew\u2019s voice comes out of the speaker.</p> <p>But of course it doesn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cKate? It\u2019s Alexandra. I need you to call me right away.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t know why I\u2019m surprised. Alexandra has a sixth sense when it comes to Drew. Don\u2019t get me wrong\u2014she\u2019s first in line to hand him his ass when he screws up. But if she thinks he\u2019s in trouble? She swoops in like Batgirl on crack.</p><p>\u201cKate? Where are you and what the hell is going on with my brother? Call me back.\u201d</p><p>Drew and Alexandra are a lot alike. I wonder if it\u2019s genetic.</p> <p>Delayed gratification is not popular among the Evans offspring.</p><p>\u201cKate Brooks\u2014don\u2019t you dare ignore my phone calls! I don\u2019t know what happened between you and Drew, but you just can\u2019t abandon someone like this! Jesus Christ, what\u2019s wrong with you? If these are your true colors, then . . . then he\u2019s better off without you!\u201d</p><p>Neither, apparently, is emotional stability. I could say her words don\u2019t bother me\u2014but I\u2019d be lying. That last line hurt.</p><p>One more message to go.</p><p>\u201cKate . . . it\u2019s Alexandra again . . .\u201d</p><p>her voice is different. Less urgent and impatient.</p> <p>Almost a whisper.</p><p>\u201c. . . I\u2019m sorry. I shouldn\u2019t have yelled like that. I\u2019m just worried.</p><p>He won\u2019t talk to me, Kate. He\u2019s never not talked to me before. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on between you two . . . and I don\u2019t need to know, but . . . just . . . please come back? Whatever happened . . . wherever you are . . . I know you two can work it out. You don\u2019t have to call me . . . just . . . please . . . please come home. He loves you Kate . . . so much.\u201d</p><p>I stare at the phone, breathing hard. Of course Drew won\u2019t talk to her. There\u2019s no way in hell he\u2019s going to look his pregnant sister in the eye and tell her he all but kicked me out because I\u2019m pregnant too.</p><p>he\u2019s a lot of things. Stupid isn\u2019t one of them.</p><p>I throw the phone across the room out of self-preservation, because I want to call. I want to go back. But apparently I do have some dignity left, even if it\u2019s just a shred. Why should I extend the olive branch? I\u2019m not the one who burnt down the tree. John knows where I am now. If Drew wants me, it won\u2019t be hard for him to find me.</p><p>I push my hands through my quickly drying hair and open my closet door. And there, staring back at me, is my good, old waitress uniform\u2014plaid skirt, lace top, white cowgirl hat.</p><p>It\u2019s been ten years since I last wore it. I take out the hanger, smiling. I had a lot of good times in this uniform.</p> <p>Easy, uncomplicated times.</p><p>I put it on\u2014like a bride trying on her wedding dress a year after the wedding\u2014just to see if it still fits. It does. And as I look at myself in the full-length mirror, I know just what I\u2019m going to do next. Because routine is good. Any routine. Even an old one.</p><p>I may not have a plan for the rest of my life.</p><p>But at least I\u2019ve got one for the rest of today.</p><p>Feeling a lot less like a corpse than I have the last few days, I make my way toward the back stairs that lead to the break room. On the second step, I overhear my mom and George talking below.</p><p>Brace yourselves, this one\u2019s a doozy.</p><p>\u201cGoddamn him! Who does he think he is? When Billy and Kate broke up, I was relieved\u2014a blind man could\u2019ve seen that they had grown apart. And when . . . when she introduced me to Drew, I thought he was perfect for her. That he was more . . . like her. A part of the world she lives in now. And the way he looked at her, George.</p><p>It was so obvious he adored her. how can he treat her like this!?\u201d</p><p>George\u2019s voice is calm. Understanding. \u201cI know. I . . .\u201d</p><p>My mother cuts him off, and I imagine she\u2019s pacing. \u201cNo! No.</p><p>he\u2019s not going to get away with this. I\u2019m going to . . . I\u2019m going to call his mother!\u201d</p><p>George sighs. \u201cI hardly think that\u2019s what Kate would want you to do, Carol. They\u2019re adults\u2014\u201d</p><p>My mother\u2019s voice rises, high-pitched and protective. \u201cShe\u2019s not an adult to me! She\u2019s my baby! And she\u2019s hurting. he broke her heart . . . and . . . I don\u2019t know if she\u2019s going to get through this. It\u2019s like she\u2019s just . . . given up.\u201d</p><p>I hear a hand slap against the wood table. \u201cThat little . . . punk! he\u2019s a foul-mouthed, smart-ass little punk. And he\u2019s not going to get away with this!\u201d her tone is determined.</p><p>And a little scary.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right\u2014I won\u2019t call Anne. I\u2019m going to New York myself.</p><p>I\u2019ll show him what happens when you mess with my daughter.</p><p>he\u2019ll think Amelia Warren is Mother Fucking Theresa when I\u2019m done with him. I\u2019ll rip his balls off!\u201d</p><p>Holy Moley.</p><p>Okay, my mother? Doesn\u2019t curse. Ever. So the fact that she\u2019s dropping f-bombs and talking about the ripping off of balls?</p><p>Frankly, it\u2019s disturbing.</p><p>I walk down the rest of the steps, like I haven\u2019t heard a thing.</p><p>\u201cMorning.\u201d</p><p>My mother\u2019s face is slack. Shocked. \u201cKate. You\u2019re up.\u201d</p><p>I nod. \u201cYes. I\u2019m feeling . . . better.\u201d</p><p>Better might be too strong. Resurrected road kill is more accurate.</p><p>George offers me a mug. \u201cCoffee?\u201d</p><p>My hand covers my queasy stomach. \u201cNo, thanks.\u201d</p><p>My mother shakes off her surprise and asks, \u201chow about some warm Coca-Cola?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. That sounds good.\u201d</p><p>She gets it for me. Then she smooths my hair down as she says, \u201cWhen I was pregnant with you, I was sick for seven months.</p><p>Warm Coca-Cola always made me feel better. Plus if it comes back up, it doesn\u2019t taste all that bad.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s got a point.</p><p>FYI\u2014peanut butter?

She\u2019s a terrible waitress\u2014I think my mother just keeps her on out of charity. Legend says that she was once a beauty queen\u2014Miss Kentucky, or Louisiana, or something like that. But she lost her looks and her zest for life when her fianc\u00e9 played chicken with an oncoming freight train. And lost.</p><p>Now she lives in the apartment complex downtown, and smokes two packs a day.</p><p>But she\u2019ll probably live to be a hundred and seven\u2014compared to the thirty-one-year-old mother of three who\u2019s never touched a cigarette a day in her life, yet somehow still dies from lung cancer.</p><p>Like I said, God? he\u2019s a real sick son of a bitch sometimes.</p> <p>Waitressing skills are like riding a bike\u2014you never really forget.</p><p>Though there are a few close calls, I manage to get through the morning without vomiting in any of the customers\u2019 cheeseburger deluxes or French onion soups.</p><p>Golf clap for me.</p><p>The toughest part is the questions.

Physically and mentally.</p> <p>I\u2019m just about to retreat to my room for a nap when the bell above the door rings, and a voice comes from behind me.</p><p>A voice I would know anywhere.</p><p>Chapter 10</p><p>\u201cKatie Brooks in a cowgirl uniform. Is this for real, or some freakishly vivid acid flashback?\u201d</p><p>I was six years old the first time I laid eyes on Billy Warren.</p><p>Around the same time that Joey Martino was abandoning Amelia in that hotel room? her younger sister, Sophie, was being kicked out of the house.</p> <p>Because she was pregnant too.</p><p>Apparently the elder Mrs. Warren subscribed to the Mommy Dearest style of parenting\u2014wire hangers and all. Anyway, five years later, Sophie died in a drug den from a meth overdose. The state took custody of Billy until they were able to track down his only living relative, Amelia Warren.</p><p>Delores stayed with us for the weekend while her mother drove to California to get him. Amelia walked into the group home and saw a small, hollowed-eyed little boy in a ripped black T-shirt. And from that moment on, Billy was hers\u2014even though she hadn\u2019t given birth to him.</p><p>For the first four months that Billy lived with Amelia and Delores, he didn\u2019t speak. At all. he followed us around, did everything we did. When we played school he was the chalkboard, when we dug for buried treasure, he was our pack mule.</p><p>But he didn\u2019t talk.</p><p>And then one day Amelia was running errands on Main Street, and they passed a pawn shop. Billy stopped in his tracks. And stared into the front window.</p><p>At a shiny red guitar.</p><p>Amelia went in and bought it for him. By this time I was pretty good at playing, so she figured my father could give Billy lessons too. But\u2014here\u2019s the thing\u2014before my dad got around to giving him even one lesson? Billy already knew how to play. he was a prodigy, like Mozart. A true musical genius.</p> <p>he can be really annoying about it sometimes.</p><p>\u201cBilly!\u201d</p><p>I throw my arms around his neck. he squeezes me tight at the waist and my feet leave the floor. My voice is muffled by his shoulder. \u201cGod, it\u2019s good to see you!\u201d</p><p>I know you think he\u2019s a dick. But he\u2019s not. Really.</p><p>You\u2019ve only seen him through Drew-colored glasses.</p><p>Billy pulls back, his hands on my upper arms. It\u2019s been about eight months since I saw him last. he\u2019s toned and tan\u2014healthy.</p><p>he looks good. Except for the beard. I\u2019m not digging the beard. It\u2019s thick and shaggy\u2014reminds me of a lumberjack.</p><p>\u201cYou too, Katie. You look . . .\u201d his brow furrows. And his smile turns into a frown. \u201cGod damn. You look like day-old shit.\u201d</p><p>Yep, that\u2019s Billy. he always did know just what to say to a girl.</p><p>\u201cWow. With lines like that, you must be beating them off with a bat in LA. By the way\u2014you know there\u2019s a rat hanging off your face?\u201d</p><p>he laughs and rubs his beard. \u201cIt\u2019s my disguise. I need one now, you know.\u201d</p><p>On cue, a boy who looks to be about ten approaches us hesitantly. \u201cCan I have your autograph, Mr. Warren?\u201d</p><p>Billy\u2019s grin widens. And he takes the offered pen and paper.</p><p>\u201cSure thing.\u201d he scribbles quickly, hands the autograph back, and says, \u201cDon\u2019t stop dreaming, kid\u2014they really do come true.\u201d</p><p>After the starstruck boy walks away, Billy turns back to me, eyes sparkling. \u201chow f**king cool is that?\u201d</p><p>he\u2019s the hottest thing in music these days. his last album stayed at number one for six weeks\u2014and there\u2019s big Grammy buzz for this year\u2019s awards. I\u2019m proud of him. he\u2019s right where I always believed he could be.</p><p>Still, I tease, \u201cCareful. You still have to get that big head back out the door.\u201d</p><p>he chuckles. \u201cWhat are you doing here? I was supposed to come to the city to see you guys next week.\u201d</p><p>Before I can answer, a face appears out of thin air on the other side of the glass door.</p><p>Scaring the ever-loving shit out of me. \u201cAh!\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s a light-haired woman with huge, unblinking brown eyes.</p><p>Kind of like ET in the blond wig.</p><p>Billy turns. \u201cOh\u2014that\u2019s Evay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEvie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, E-vay. Like eBay. She\u2019s with me.\u201d he opens the door and ET girl walks in, hands folded tightly at her waist. She\u2019s wearing black leggings and a Bob Marley T-shirt. The word skinny doesn\u2019t even come close. She reminds me of one of those skeletons in biology class, with a thin, flesh-colored coating.</p><p>She\u2019s kind of pretty\u2014in a concentration camp kind of way.</p><p>\u201cEvay, this is Kate. Kate\u2014Evay.\u201d</p><p>In the professional world, handshakes are important. They give prospective clients a sneak peek at how you do business. They can make or break a deal. I always make sure my grip is firm\u2014strong.</p><p>Just because I\u2019m petite and a woman doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m gonna get stepped on.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nice to meet you, Evay.\u201d I hold out my hand.</p><p>She just stares at it\u2014like it\u2019s a spider crawling out of the shower drain. \u201cI don\u2019t make direct female-to-female contact. It depletes the beautification cells.\u201d</p><p>O-kay. I glance at Billy. he seems unperturbed. I hook a thumb over my shoulder. \u201cSo . . . do you guys want to eat? how about a booth?\u201d</p><p>When Evay answers, her tone is airy, dazed, like a concussion victim. Or an acting coach\u2014 be the tree. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI have my lunch right here.\u201d She opens her palm to reveal an assortment of capsules that make my prenatals look like baby candy. \u201cBut I need water.

Not one freaking time.</p><p>\u201cI only drink snowy mountain spring water.\u201d</p><p>Billy raises his hand. \u201cI\u2019m jonesin\u2019 for some onion rings.\u201d</p><p>I smile and put in his order. \u201cSure.\u201d</p> <p>Evay sniffs the air, like a squirrel before a storm. Then she looks a little petrified. \u201cIs that grease? Do you cook with actual grease?\u201d</p><p>I take a step back. She might be one of those wacked-out, PETA-loving, vegan people who are offended by animal byproducts\u2014and the prospect of being doused with red paint isn\u2019t too appealing at the moment.</p><p>\u201cAh . . . yes?\u201d</p><p>She covers her nose with bony fingers. \u201cI can\u2019t breathe this air! I\u2019ll break out!\u201d She turns to the door.</p><p>And waits.</p><p>Guess females aren\u2019t the only thing she doesn\u2019t make contact with.</p> <p>Billy opens it for her and she scurries out. I look at him, flabbergasted. \u201cOkay, what the hell was that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was a Californian. They\u2019re all like that. I think it\u2019s from too much sun . . . and weed. They make Dee Dee look f**king mundane. Plus Evay\u2019s a model, so she\u2019s an extra-large kind of weird.</p><p>She won\u2019t smell grease, but she smokes like a chimney.\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s why I\u2019m happy I live in New York.</p><p>Where the normal people are.</p><p>Well . . . lived, anyway.</p><p>I walk behind the counter to get a take-out box for Billy\u2019s rings.</p><p>he rests his elbows on the counter, leaning over. \u201cSo where\u2019s Dr.</p> <p>Manhattan?\u201d</p><p>he means Drew. You know\u2014after the arrogant, inhuman, blue physicist in the Watchmen comics?</p><p>\u201che\u2019s not here.\u201d</p><p>Billy looks surprised. Pleasantly so. \u201cNo kidding? I didn\u2019t think he let you out of his sight, let alone out of the state. What\u2019s up with that?\u201d</p><p>I shrug. \u201cLong story.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds promising. hey\u2014let\u2019s hang out later. Catch up. I have to get Evay back to the hotel for her nap, then I\u2019ll swing back and pick you up.\u201d</p><p>My eyes squint. \u201cher nap?\u201d</p><p>he lifts his chin defensively. \u201cYeah. Lots of people sleep twelve hours during the day.\u201d</p><p>I hand him his onion rings. \u201cI know. They\u2019re called vampires, Billy.\u201d</p><p>he laughs.</p><p>And then my mother walks out of the kitchen. \u201cBilly! Amelia said you were visiting.\u201d</p><p>She hugs him and he kisses her cheek. \u201chey, Carol.\u201d</p><p>She looks disapprovingly at his beard. \u201cOh honey, you have such a handsome face. Don\u2019t cover it up with all . . . this.\u201d</p><p>My mother is such a mom, isn\u2019t she?</p><p>Billy defends his facial hair. \u201cWhy\u2019s everyone hating on the beard? I like the beard.\u201d Then he holds out a hundred-dollar bill.</p><p>\u201cFor the onion rings.\u201d</p><p>She shakes her head and pushes his hand back. \u201cYour money\u2019s no good here\u2014you know that.\u201d</p><p>A crash of breaking glass comes from behind the kitchen door.</p><p>And George Reinhart\u2019s voice: \u201cCarol!\u201d</p><p>My mother clicks her tongue. \u201cOh, dear. George is trying to work the dishwasher again.\u201d</p><p>She runs off to the kitchen. Billy and I share a laugh. Then he hands me the hundred-dollar bill. \u201cSlip this into the register when your mom\u2019s not looking, okay?\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s tough when you get to the point in your life\u2014like we have\u2014when you\u2019re able to help the parentals financially, but they\u2019re too stubborn to accept.</p><p>\u201cSure thing.\u201d</p><p>he taps the counter. \u201cOkay, four o\u2019clock, I\u2019ll pick you up. Be ready. And don\u2019t wear any power suit or shit like that\u2014this is a strictly jeans and sneaks kind of mission.\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s what I\u2019d planned on. But still I have to ask, \u201cWhy? What are we gonna to do?\u201d he shakes his head at me. \u201cYou\u2019ve been gone too long, Katiegirl. What else would we do? We\u2019re goin\u2019 womping.\u201d</p><p>Right. Silly me. Of course we are.</p><p>Billy leans over the counter and kisses my cheek quickly.</p><p>\u201cLater.\u201d</p><p>Then he grabs his take-out and walks out the door.</p><p>have you ever gone for a ride in your car, after your last final exam or the beginning of a long weekend from work? And the road\u2019s wide open, your sunglasses are on, and your favorite song is blaring out of the speakers?</p><p>Good. Then you know just what this feels like.</p><p>Womping.</p><p>how to explain it? I\u2019m sure there\u2019re various names for it, depending on where you live, but here, that\u2019s what we call it. It\u2019s like mountain climbing . . . only . . . with a car. Or a truck. Or any other automobile with four-wheel drive.</p><p>The goal is to scale a hill, the steepest you can find, and get as vertical as you can, as fast as you can, without flipping car. It\u2019s fun\u2014in a stupid, dangerous, adrenaline-junkie kind of way.</p><p>Don\u2019t worry about my delicate condition. Billy\u2019s truck is an off-road vehicle with safety harnesses instead of seatbelts. So even if we flip? I\u2019m not going anywhere.</p><p>We\u2019re riding out to the hills right now, full speed ahead. Ohio isn\u2019t exactly known for its hilly terrain, but there are a few spots where these abound. Lucky for us, Greenville is near them.</p><p>The windows are open, the sun is bright, and it\u2019s a comfortable seventy degrees. I yell above the sound of the stereo, \u201cSo . . . another new car?\u201d</p><p>Billy smiles and rubs his hand lovingly across the dash. \u201cYep.</p><p>And this baby\u2019s unpolluted by my cousin\u2019s evil handiwork.\u201d</p><p>I roll my eyes. I definitely need to check out Billy\u2019s financial portfolio. The wind whips my hair around my face. I push it back and yell again, \u201cDon\u2019t be that guy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat guy?\u2019 \u201cThe guy that has a different car for every day of the month.</p><p>Spend your money on more practical things.\u201d</p><p>he shrugs. \u201cI told Amelia I\u2019d buy her a house. As long as she doesn\u2019t tell Delores where it is.\u201d</p><p>Billy and Delores love to rag on each other.</p><p>The song on the radio changes, and Billy turns it up to maximum volume. he looks at me. And he\u2019s smiling. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>We both are.</p><p>Because, once upon a time, it was our song. Not in a romantic way. In a teenager, rebel-without-a-cause kind of way. It was our anthem; our Thunder Road.</p><p>Alabama sings about getting out of a small town, beating the odds, living for love. We belt out the lyrics together.</p><p>It\u2019s great. It\u2019s perfect.</p> <p>Billy pushes the gas pedal to the floor, leaving a cloud of dust behind us, and I remember how it feels to be sixteen again. When life was easy, and the most pressing matter was where we could hang out on a Friday night.</p><p>They say youth is wasted on the young\u2014and they\u2019re right.</p><p>But it\u2019s not the youths\u2019 fault. No matter how often they\u2019re told to appreciate the days they\u2019re living, they just can\u2019t.</p><p>Because they have nothing to compare it to. It\u2019s only later, when it\u2019s too late\u2014when there\u2019re bills to pay and deadlines to make\u2014that they realize how sweet, how innocent and precious, those moments were.</p><p>The singer croons about Thunderbirds, and driving all night, and living your own life. Billy\u2019s first car was a Thunderbird. You got a glimpse of it in New York, remember? It was a junker when he bought it, but he fixed it up himself on weekends and during the many days he blew off school.</p> <p>I lost my virginity in its backseat. Prom weekend. Yes\u2014I\u2019m a statistic. At the time, I thought it was the epitome of romance, the peak of perfection.</p><p>But\u2014again\u2014I didn\u2019t have anything else to compare it to.</p><p>Billy loved that car. And I\u2019d bet my business degree he\u2019s still got it in his garage in LA.</p><p>Still singing, I hold on to the harness straps with both hands as Billy spins the car into a 360-degree turn. It\u2019s a terrific maneuver.</p><p>You floor the gas pedal, jerk the steering wheel, and pull up on the emergency break. It\u2019s the best way to do a donut\u2014as long as the transmission doesn\u2019t drop out the bottom of your car or anything.</p><p>Dust billows up from the ground, and dirt scatters across the windshield. It\u2019s always been this way with us. Comfortable.</p> <p>Uncomplicated. Well\u2014at least when we were here in Greenville, it was.</p><p>As I went through college and business school, we drifted.</p><p>Became less Bonnie and Clyde and more Wendy and Peter Pan.</p><p>But out here, when it was just the two of us and the rest of the world didn\u2019t exist, we could be those kids again. Kids who wanted the same things, who dreamed the same dreams.</p><p>The wheels spin and Billy peels out across an unpaved, flat piece of land. And it feels like we\u2019re flying. Like I\u2019m free. Not a care in the world.</p><p>And the best part? For the first time in almost four days, I don\u2019t think about Drew Evans at all.</p><p>Chapter 11</p><p>By the time we make it back to Billy\u2019s motel room, it\u2019s dark.</p> <p>We stumble through the door\u2014tired and dusty and laughing. I plop down on the couch while Billy picks up a piece of paper from the kitchenette counter.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Evay?\u201d</p><p>he holds up the note. \u201cShe took a car back to LA. She said the unprocessed air was invading her pores.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t look too broken up about it.\u201d</p><p>he gets two beers from the fridge and shrugs. \u201cThere\u2019s more where she came from. No shit off my shoe.\u201d</p><p>Billy picks up the guitar lying across the coffee table and strums a few chords. Then he reaches under the cushion and takes out a clear plastic baggie. he tosses it to me. \u201cYou still roll the best joints this side of the Mississippi\u2014or has the establishment completely assimilated you into the collective?\u201d</p><p>I smirk and pick up the bag. Rolling a good joint takes concentration. Use too much weed and it\u2019s just wasteful\u2014too little and you defeat the purpose.</p><p>It\u2019s a relaxing process. Like knitting.</p><p>I lick the edge of the paper and smooth it down. Then I pass it to Billy.</p><p>he looks at it admiringly. \u201cYou\u2019re an artist.\u201d</p><p>he puts the joint between his lips and flips open his Zippo.</p><p>But before the flame touches the tip, I snap the metal cap closed.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t. I could get a contact high.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo?\u201d</p><p>I sigh. And look Billy straight in the face. \u201cI\u2019m pregnant.\u201d</p><p>his eyes go wide. And the joint falls from his lips.</p><p>\u201cNo shit?\u201d</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cNo shit, Billy.\u201d</p><p>his turns forward, staring at the table. he doesn\u2019t say anything for several moments, so I fill the dead air.</p><p>\u201cDrew doesn\u2019t want it. he told me to have an abortion.\u201d</p><p>The words come out detached. Flat. Because I still can\u2019t believe they\u2019re true.</p><p>Billy turns back to me and hisses, \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>I nod. And fill him in on the more sordid details of my departure from New York. By the time I\u2019m finished, he\u2019s on his feet, pissed off and pacing. he mumbles, \u201cThat motherfucker owes me a gun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>he waves me off. \u201cNothing.\u201d Then he sits down and pushes a hand through his hair. \u201cI knew he was an ass**le\u2014I f**king knew it. I really didn\u2019t take him for a Garrett Buckler, though.\u201d</p><p>Every town has two sides of the tracks\u2014the good side and the not-so-good side. Garrett Buckler came from the good side of Greenville, with its automatic sprinklers and stucco-sided McMansions. he was a senior, our sophomore year in high school. And from the first day of school that year, Garrett was focused on one thing: Dee Dee Warren.</p><p>Billy hated him on sight. he\u2019s always been distrustful of people with money\u2014money they didn\u2019t earn themselves. And Garrett was no exception. But Delores blew Billy off. Told him he was being ridiculous. Paranoid. Said she wanted to give Garrett a chance.</p><p>So she did. She also gave him her virginity.</p><p>And four weeks later, behind the bleachers at school, Delores told Garrett she was pregnant. Apparently we Greenville women are quite the Fertile Myrtles.</p><p>Don\u2019t spit on us\u2014you might knock us up.</p><p>And yes, despite all the sex education Amelia gave us, it still happened. Because\u2014here\u2019s the thing a lot of people forget about teenagers\u2014sometimes they just do stupid things. Not because they don\u2019t have the education or resources, but because they\u2019re too damn young to really understand that actions have consequences.</p><p>Life-changing ones.</p><p>Anyway, as you can imagine, Delores was terrified. But like any moon-eyed, romantic, adolescent girl, she figured Garrett would be there for her. That they\u2019d get through whatever was coming together.</p><p>She was wrong. he told her to f**k off. he accused her of trying to trap him\u2014said he didn\u2019t believe that the kid was even his. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>history\u2019s a lot like shampoo that way\u2014rinse, repeat, and repeat again.</p><p>Delores was crushed. And Billy . . . Billy was f**king furious. I was with him the day he stole a white Camaro from the Walgreen\u2019s parking lot. I followed him in the Thunderbird to a chop shop in Cleveland, where he got paid three hundred dollars for it.</p><p>Just enough to pay for the abortion.</p><p>We could\u2019ve gone to Amelia, but Delores was just too ashamed.</p> <p>So we went to the clinic ourselves. And I held Delores\u2019s hand the whole time.</p><p>Afterward, Billy dropped us off at my house. Then he went looking for Garrett Buckler. When he found him, Billy broke his arm and fractured his jaw. And he told him if he ever breathed a word about Delores to anyone, he\u2019d come back and break his other four appendages\u2014including the one between his legs.</p><p>To this day, it\u2019s the best-kept secret in Greenville.</p><p>\u201cYou know what? Fuck him. You make good cash, so you sure as shit don\u2019t need his money. And as for the whole dad thing? Overrated. You had a father for like, five minutes . . . me and my cousin never did. And the three of us turned out great.\u201d</p><p>he rethinks that statement.</p> <p>\u201cOkay\u2014maybe not Delores. But still\u2014two out of three ain\u2019t bad. We could\u2014\u201d</p><p>I cut him off. \u201cI think I\u2019m gonna get an abortion, Billy.\u201d</p><p>he goes silent. Totally. Utterly.</p><p>Completely.</p><p>But his shock and disappointment pound loudly\u2014like a big bass drum.</p><p>Or maybe that\u2019s just my own guilt.</p> <p>Remember about twenty years ago, when that Susan Smith lady drowned her two children, because her boyfriend didn\u2019t want a woman with kids? Like the rest of the country, I thought she should\u2019ve been strung up by her fingertips and had the skin scraped off her body with a cheese grater.</p><p>I mean, what kind of woman does that? What kind of woman chooses a man over her own flesh and blood?</p><p>A weak one.</p><p>And that\u2019s a characteristic I\u2019ve already admitted to, remember?</p><p>It\u2019s been in my mind for a while now\u2014like a cobweb that\u2019s clinging to a corner but you walk on past because you just don\u2019t have the time to deal with it.</p><p>I\u2019m a businesswoman, first and foremost. I\u2019m analytical.</p><p>Practical.</p><p>If one of my investments isn\u2019t turning out the way I thought it would? I get rid of it. Cut my losses. Simple mathematics\u2014if you take the emotion out of it, it\u2019s a no brainer.</p> <p>I know. I know what you\u2019re thinking. But what about that little boy you pictured? That beautiful, perfect boy with dark hair and the smile you love?</p><p>The truth is, there is no little boy. Not yet. Right now, it\u2019s nothing more than a cluster of dividing cells. A mistake that\u2019s standing in the way of me and the life I was supposed to have.</p><p>I don\u2019t know if Drew and I can ever get back to where we were\u2014but I know giving birth to a child he obviously wants nothing to do with isn\u2019t going to win me any points. And it would make everything so much easier.</p><p>Like getting my eyebrows waxed. A simple procedure for a lifetime of convenience.</p><p>You think that makes me a cold bitch, don\u2019t you?</p><p>Yeah . . . well . . . I guess you\u2019re right.</p><p>Billy\u2019s voice is cautious. hesitant. Like he doesn\u2019t want to ask the question, and he wants to hear the answer even less. \u201cFor him?</p><p>You\u2019re gonna get an abortion because of him?\u201d</p><p>I wipe at the wetness on my cheeks. I didn\u2019t even know I was crying. \u201cI can\u2019t do this on my own. Alone.\u201d</p><p>It always comes back to that, doesn\u2019t it?</p><p>Billy grabs my hand. \u201chey. Look at me.\u201d</p><p>I do.</p><p>And his eyes are burning. With tenderness. And determination. \u201cYou are not alone, Kate. And you never will be. Not as long as I\u2019m breathing.\u201d</p><p>I bite my lip. And shake my head slowly. And the lump in my throat makes my voice raspy and frail. \u201cYou know what I mean, Billy.\u201d</p><p>And he does. Billy understands better than anyone, because he was there. he knows how hard it was, how bad it felt. All those nights when I went out with him, for ice cream or to the movies\u2014 leaving my mother home in an empty house.</p><p>All the awards and graduation ceremonies, when my mother\u2019s face glowed with pride, but her eyes shone with sadness. Because she had no one to share it with.</p><p>Every holiday\u2014New Year\u2019s Eves and Thanksgivings and Easters\u2014when I couldn\u2019t make it home from college, and I\u2019d cry in his arms after getting off the phone with her, because it killed me that she was spending the day by herself.</p><p>Billy was there for all of it.</p><p>And Amelia. he saw his aunt struggle\u2014financially, emotionally\u2014trying to be two parents in one for him and Delores. he watched her date guy after guy, looking for a Mr. Right who never showed up.</p><p>Theirs were the anti-lives. The ones I never wanted for my own.</p><p>And yet, here I am.</p><p>Billy nods. \u201cYeah, Katie\u2014I know what you mean.\u201d</p><p>I rub my eyes hard. Frustrated. Aggravated . . . with myself. \u201cI just need to make a goddamn decision. I have to figure out a plan and stick with it. I just . . .\u201d My voice breaks. \u201cI just don\u2019t know what to do.\u201d</p><p>Billy breathes deep. Then he stands up. \u201cAll right, screw this.</p><p>Let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>he walks around the corner and digs into the cabinet under the kitchen sink. I have no idea what he\u2019s looking for.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean? Go where?\u201d</p><p>he pops up holding up a screwdriver. \u201cTo the place where our problems can\u2019t touch us.\u201d</p><p>Billy pulls the truck into the parking lot. And the headlights illu-minate the huge darkened sign.</p><p>Can you see it?</p><p>ROLLER RINK We climb out. \u201cI don\u2019t think this is a good idea, Billy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>We walk to the side of the building. here\u2019s some advice I learned young: When you\u2019re walking in the dark? Or running from the cops through the woods? Step high. It\u2019ll save your shins and the palms of your hands a world of pain.</p><p>\u201cBecause we\u2019re adults now. This is breaking and entering.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was breaking and entering when we were seventeen too.\u201d</p><p>We get to the window. I can just barely make out Billy\u2019s face in the moonlight.</p><p>\u201cI know. But I don\u2019t think Sheriff Mitchell\u2019s going to be so quick to let us off the hook now.\u201d</p><p>he scoffs. \u201cOh, please. Amelia said Mitchell\u2019s been bored out of his gourd since we left. he\u2019d kill for some excitement. Kids today . . . too lazy. There\u2019s no creativity to their vandalism.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Wait.

Since when does Amelia talk to Sheriff Mitchell?\u201d</p><p>Billy shakes his head. \u201cTrust me\u2014you don\u2019t want to know.\u201d</p> <p>he holds up the screwdriver. \u201cYou still got it? Or have you lost your touch?\u201d</p><p>For the second time tonight, I accept his challenge. I snatch the screwdriver and walk up to the window. And under twenty seconds later, we\u2019re inside.</p><p>Oh, yeah\u2014I\u2019ve still got it.</p><p>The roller rink was our place: breaking in after closing, our national pastime. Idle hands really are the devil\u2019s tools. So\u2014for God\u2019s sake\u2014get your kids a hobby.</p><p>Ten minutes later I\u2019m flying across the slick floor in worn, size-six skates.</p> <p>It\u2019s a wonderful feeling. Like floating on air\u2014spinning on big, puffy clouds.</p><p>The stereo system plays the eighties\u2019 greatest hits in the background. Billy leans against the wall\u2014toking up and blowing the smoke out the open window.</p><p>he inhales deeply. And tufts of white puff out from his lips as he says, \u201cYou know, you could come to California with me. Set up your own shop. I have friends\u2014guys with money\u2014they\u2019d invest with you. My friends are your friends. Me casa es su casa\u2014and all that.\u201d</p><p>I stop sliding as I consider his words. \u201cActually, that means, \u2018My house is your house.\u2019\u201d</p><p>Billy\u2019s eyebrows come together. \u201cOh.\u201d he shrugs. \u201cI always did suck in Spanish. Senorita Gonzalas hated me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because you crazy-glued her Lhasa apsos together.\u201d</p> <p>he giggles, remembering. \u201cOh, yeah. That was a great night.\u201d</p><p>I chuckle too. And go into a spin that any Olympic ice skater would be proud of. The song changes to \u201cNever Say Goodbye\u201d by Bon Jovi. It was our prom song.</p><p>Raise your hand if it was yours too. I\u2019m pretty sure, after 1987, it\u2019s been the prom song of every high school in America at least once.</p><p>Billy snuffs out the joint with his fingertips. Then skates up to me. he holds out his arm, doing his best Beetlejuice impression.</p><p>\u201cShall we?\u201d</p><p>I smile. And take his arm. I put my hands on his shoulders, and while Bon Jovi sings about smoky rooms and losing keys, we start to sway.</p><p>Billy\u2019s hands sit low on my back. I turn my head and rest my cheek against his chest. he\u2019s warm. his flannel shirt is soft and smells like pot and earth . . . and home. I feel his chin against the top of my head as he asks me quietly, \u201cRemember prom?\u201d</p><p>I smile. \u201cYeah. Remember Dee Dee\u2019s dress?\u201d</p> <p>he laughs. Because Delores was the original trendsetter\u2014even then. Lady Gaga\u2019s got nothing on her. her dress was white and stiff, like a ballerina\u2019s tutu. And it had a string of twinkling lights along the hem. It was really pretty.</p><p>Until it caught on fire.</p><p>her date, Louis Darden, put it out with the punch bowl of spiked Kool-Aid. She spent the rest of the night sticky and smelling like a doused campfire.</p><p>I continue our trek down memory lane. \u201cRemember the last day of junior year?\u201d</p><p>Billy\u2019s chest rumbles as he snickers. \u201cNot my stealthiest moment.\u201d</p><p>It was the final day of school\u2014and about one hundred and three degrees inside our sadly under-air-conditioned school. But Principal Cleeves refused to let us out early. So Billy pulled the fire alarm.</p><p>Right down the hall from where the principal was standing.</p><p>A hot pursuit ensued, but Billy successfully avoided capture.</p><p>So the principal went on the intercom system and tried paging him. \u201cBilly Warren, please report to the main office. Immediately.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know I\u2019m not the brightest bulb in the box, but come on.</p><p>Did they really think I was stupid enough to actually go?\u201d</p><p>I laugh against Billy\u2019s shirt. \u201cAnd then as soon as you walked in senior year, Cleeves grabbed you and was all like, \u2018Mr. Warren, there\u2019s a chair in detention with your name on it.\u2019\u201d</p><p>And there really was. They stenciled his name on the back of a chair, like a director\u2019s chair on a movie set.</p><p>Billy sighs. \u201cGood times.\u201d</p><p>I nod. \u201cThe best.\u201d</p><p>And as words about favorite songs and loves that would never end swirl around us, I close my eyes. Billy\u2019s arms tighten around me just a bit, pulling me closer.</p><p>Do you see where this is going? I didn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve missed this, Katie. I miss you.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t say it back, but it\u2019s nice to hear. And it\u2019s even nicer to be held.</p><p>To be wanted.</p><p>I haven\u2019t felt anything more than friendly affection for Billy in a long, long time. But that doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019ve forgotten. The girl I used to be. The one who thought there was nothing sweeter than looking into Billy Warren\u2019s eyes. Nothing more romantic than hearing him sing. Nothing more exciting than riding in his car, late at night, after curfew.</p><p>I remember what it feels like to love him. Even though I don\u2019t love him in quite the same way anymore.</p><p>I gaze up at Billy\u2019s face as he sings the song\u2019s words softly. To me.</p><p>Looking back now, I\u2019m not exactly sure who leaned where, who moved first. All I know is one minute we were dancing in the middle of the skating rink . . . and the next, Billy was kissing me.</p><p>And it only took a second before I was kissing him back.</p><p>Chapter 12</p><p>Kissing Billy is . . . nice. It\u2019s familiar. Sweet.</p><p>Like finding your old Strawberry Shortcake house in your parents\u2019 attic. And you smile when you see it. You run your hand over the balcony and remember all the days you spent wrapped up in its make-believe world. It\u2019s nostalgic. A part of your childhood.</p><p>But it\u2019s a part you\u2019ve left behind. Because you\u2019re a grown-up now.</p><p>So no matter how dear the memories are, you\u2019re not going to bust out Apple Dumplin\u2019 and Plum Puddin\u2019 and start playing.</p><p>The kiss ends and I lower my head. And I stare at Billy\u2019s shirt.</p><p>You know that line\u2014I think it\u2019s from a song\u2014if you can\u2019t be with the one you love, love the one you\u2019re with?</p><p>That could fit really well in this situation.</p><p>Except for the fact that I already love Billy. Too much to take advantage of his devotion\u2014too much to use him to heal my broken heart and bruised ego. he deserves better than that. Billy Warren is no one\u2019s consolation prize. And I\u2019d happily scratch the eyes out of any woman who tried to make him one.</p><p>he once told me I wasn\u2019t the girl he fell in love with anymore. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>And as much as it hurt to hear, as inadequate as it made me feel at the time\u2014he was right.</p><p>I\u2019m not that girl anymore.</p><p>I drag my eyes from his shirt to his face. \u201cBilly . . .\u201d</p><p>he puts his finger to my lips, brushing them softly. he closes his eyes and takes a breath. Neither of us moves for a moment, caught up for a few final seconds in the enchantment of the past.</p> <p>Then he speaks, breaking the spell. \u201cBeing here with you? It\u2019s awesome. As good as I remember\u2014better, even. It feels . . . it feels like we got to take a ride in the DeLorean.\u201d his hand holds my face tenderly. \u201cBut it\u2019s okay, Kate. It was just for a minute. And now we\u2019re back to the future. It doesn\u2019t have to mean anything more than that. It doesn\u2019t have to change what we have now, \u2019cause that\u2019s pretty awesome too.\u201d</p><p>I nod, relieved. Thankful that Billy knows what I feel without me having to say the words. And that he feels the same.</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>he smiles. \u201cI should get you home, before Carol calls out the dogs. Or worse\u2014Amelia.\u201d</p><p>I chuckle. And hand in hand, we leave the roller-skating rink and all of its memories behind.</p> <p>Twenty minutes later, Billy pulls into the back parking lot of my mother\u2019s diner. We sit in the truck silently, side by side.</p><p>\u201cYou want me to walk you up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo\u2014it\u2019s all right. I can manage.\u201d</p><p>he nods slowly. \u201cSo . . . is there gonna be like . . . weirdness between us now? Because we tongue-wrestled for a couple minutes?\u201d</p><p>Like I said before\u2014Billy always did have a way with words.</p><p>\u201cNo. No weirdness. No worries.\u201d</p> <p>he needs further confirmation. \u201cYou still my girl, Katie?\u201d</p><p>he doesn\u2019t mean in the girlfriend way. he means in the friend\u2014the best friend, who happens to be a girl\u2014kind of way. In case you were wondering.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll always be your girl, Billy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d he turns his head to the windshield and looks out.</p><p>\u201cYou should really think about California. I think it would be a nice change for you. A clean break.\u201d</p><p>he\u2019s right, in a way. California would be a blank page for me.</p><p>No memories. No painful run-ins. No awkward conversations.</p><p>And with my r\u00e9sum\u00e9, I don\u2019t foresee finding a new job to be too much of a problem.</p> <p>That being said . . . I have connections in New York. Roots.</p><p>And I\u2019m not sure I want to sever all of them. So like every other aspect of my life at the moment, I don\u2019t know what the hell I want to do.</p><p>Sound like a broken record, don\u2019t I? Sorry.</p><p>I put my hand over his on the gearshift. \u201cI\u2019ll think about it.\u201d</p><p>he puts his other hand on top of mine. \u201cYou\u2019ll figure it out, Kate\u2014I know you will. And it gets better. You won\u2019t hurt like this forever. I speak from experience.\u201d</p><p>I smile gratefully. \u201cThanks, Billy. For everything.\u201d Then I climb out of the truck and he drives away.</p><p>After letting my mother know I\u2019m back, I head to my room. I shut the door behind me and lean against it. Exhausted.</p><p>Talk about a long frigging day.</p><p>My mother\u2019s cleaned my room. Not that it was messy before, but I can tell. The pillows are fluffed just a bit more, and my cell phone sits neatly on the nightstand.</p><p>I kick off my shoes, pick it up, and turn it on. Despite my hissy fit earlier, it still works. I stare at the numbers. They\u2019re lit up. Calling to me. Taunting me.</p><p>It would be so easy. Just ten quick digits and I could hear his voice. It\u2019s been forever since I heard his voice. My hands shake a little. Like a junkie, needing a fix\u2014just a taste.</p><p>Do you think he\u2019d pick up?</p><p>Do you think he\u2019d be alone if he did?</p><p>And that\u2019s the thought that kills the craving. There\u2019s no way I\u2019m calling.</p><p>Still . . . I don\u2019t listen to my voicemails often. Usually I just check the missed call list. I delete my voicemails even less.</p><p>I scroll down the screen, to the date I need.</p><p>And press play.</p><p>\u201cHey, babe. The golf outing ran over. I was gonna stop and pick up a bottle for later. You want Dom or Philipponnat? You know what?</p><p>On second thought\u2014screw the champagne. You taste better than both of them put together. I\u2019ll be home in five minutes.\u201d</p><p>I close my eyes and let his words wash over me. Drew has an amazing voice. Calm and soothing\u2014but devilishly seductive at the same time. he totally could\u2019ve gone into radio.</p><p>I press another button.</p><p>This time his tone is teasing. \u201cKaate, you\u2019re late. Tell Delores to pick out her own goddamn shoes. You\u2019ve got a boyfriend who\u2019s sitting in a big, frothy Jacuzzi all by his lonesome. Come home, sweetheart. I\u2019m here waiting for you.\u201d</p><p>If only that was true today.</p><p>There\u2019s more\u2014some are quick and to the point, some are downright dirty. And I listen to every single one. he doesn\u2019t say \u201cI love you\u201d in any of them\u2014but he doesn\u2019t have to. I hear it in every word. Every time he says my name.</p><p>And I can\u2019t help but wonder how this all happened? how did we get here? And can we ever go back?</p><p>I don\u2019t cry. There just aren\u2019t any tears left. I curl up in the middle of my bed. And Drew\u2019s voice lulls me to sleep.</p><p>The next afternoon, Billy and I are in the back room of the diner, sharing a plate of fries. he\u2019s working on a new song and he thinks better on his feet.</p><p>See him there? Walking from one end of the room to the other, mumbling and humming, and occasionally strumming the guitar strapped across his chest?</p><p>I sit at the table. Trying to think my way out of the pit of despair that is now my life.</p><p>As Billy crosses toward the door that leads to the diner, something catches his eye in the round window at the top. And he backs away. \u201cOh, shit.\u201d</p><p>I look up. \u201cWhat? What\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>Then the door bursts open. It slams against the wall and then stays in place\u2014afraid to move an inch. Because there, standing in the doorway in all her pissed-off glory, is my best friend.</p><p>Delores Warren.</p><p>Oh, shit indeedy.</p><p>She\u2019s wearing red knee-high leather boots, tight black pants, an embellished black top, and a short, black-and-white faux fur jacket. A myriad of Louis Vuitton bags hang off her shoulders, matching the large wheeled one trailing behind her.</p><p>And the anger in her amber eyes makes them sparkle like freshcut topaz stones . \u201cDoes someone want to tell me why I had to hear from my mother that there was a Three Musketeers\u2019 reunion going on in Greenville that I wasn\u2019t invited to?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She stomps forward.

She\u2019s a waitress here. Works after school. She\u2019s seems nice.</p><p>And at the moment\u2014terrified.</p><p>\u201chey, Gidget, how about you make yourself useful and get me a Diet Coke? Don\u2019t scrimp on the ice.\u201d</p><p>Kimberly flees the room .</p><p>Lucky girl.</p> <p>Delores points at me and yells, like Jack Nicholson in A Few Good Men, \u201cWell?! You can\u2019t keep me out of the loop, Kate. I am the loop!\u201d</p><p>My voice comes out meek. Repentant. If you\u2019re ever in the attack range of an angry she-wolf, lay down and play dead. It\u2019ll go easier that way.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t want to ruin your vacation.\u201d</p><p>Delores snorts, \u201cIf only Queen Bee-atch Alexandra had been so thoughtful. She called us twenty times at the hotel\u2014freaking out about how we had to come home because Drew needed a suicide watch.\u201d</p><p>I roll my eyes. \u201cShe\u2019s exaggerating.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought so too. Until I saw the Dark Prince myself. Wasn\u2019t pretty.\u201d</p> <p>I take the news like a newborn bird to a worm, greedy for more. \u201cYou saw Drew? What did he say? Did he ask about me?\u201d</p><p>\u201che really wasn\u2019t capable of coherent speech at the time.</p><p>Mostly just mumbled like the village idiot he is. Jack was carrying him. Apparently Dickwad is making quite the dent in the bar scene these days, and Jack\u2019s been watching his back. Which is frightening in and of itself, considering Jack is poised for the Slutman of the Year award.\u201d</p><p>Drew has been going out. To the bars. With Jack O\u2019Shay. You remember the last time Drew went out with Jack, don\u2019t you? Taxi girl?</p><p>So this is how it feels to get stabbed with an ice pick\u2014right in the heart.</p><p>Billy\u2019s voice is sarcastic, drawing her fire away from me. \u201chey, Delores, it\u2019s good to see you too. I\u2019m great, thanks for asking. The album? Doin\u2019 awesome\u2014triple platinum. California? Fabulous, couldn\u2019t be happier. Again . . .\u201d he cups his hands around his mouth, megaphone style, \u201c. . . thanks for asking.\u201d</p><p>Delores\u2019s eyes zero in on him, looking him over head to toe.</p><p>Not happy with what she sees. \u201cIt\u2019s called a razor; you should get one. If ancient man could figure it out, you\u2019ve got a slim chance.</p> <p>Oh\u2014and Pearl Jam called. They want their flannel back.\u201d</p><p>Billy\u2019s brows go up. \u201cYou\u2019re criticizing my style? Really, Cruella? how many puppies had to die so you could wear that coat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEat shit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCooking again, are you? I thought the health department banned you for life the last time you tried?\u201d</p><p>Delores opens her mouth for a rebuttal, but nothing comes out. her glossy lips stretch slowly into a smile. \u201cI\u2019ve missed you, Jackass.\u201d</p><p>Billy winks. \u201cRight back at you, cuz.\u201d</p><p>he sits in the chair beside me and Delores collapses in the other one. \u201cOkay, Lucy. Fuckin\u2019 splain.\u201d</p><p>I take a big breath. \u201cI\u2019m pregnant.\u201d</p><p>At first, Delores doesn\u2019t say a word. Then she makes the sign of the cross. \u201cThe Antichrist has spawned? For f**k\u2019s sake, we have to hose you down with holy water or something. have the Four horsemen arrived yet?\u201d</p><p>Kimberly comes back with a big glass of soda. She puts it down in front of Delores, then scurries away.</p><p>Delores takes a long sip. \u201cSo you\u2019re unexpectedly knocked up\u2014 congratulations. happens to the best of us. What\u2019s the problem?\u201d</p><p>I stare down at the table. \u201cDrew doesn\u2019t want the baby.\u201d</p><p>As you already know, my best friend is not a fan of Drew\u2019s.</p><p>When it comes to him, she always assumes the worst. Always. So I expect her to be angry on my behalf. I expect her to go off on a magnificent tirade about man-whores and dogs and venereal diseases. I expect her to join me in another round of the naughty name-calling game.</p><p>But she doesn\u2019t do any of those things.</p><p>Instead\u2014she laughs.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about? Of course he wants the baby.</p><p>Drew Evans not wanting a mini-him running around? That\u2019s like saying Matthew doesn\u2019t want a blow job when we\u2019re stuck in traffic.</p><p>Just ridiculous.\u201d</p><p>Needless to say, I\u2019m surprised. \u201cWhy do you think that?\u201d</p><p>She shrugs. \u201cA conversation we had once. Plus, he and Mackenzie\u2014they\u2019re like Master Blaster from Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome. Tell me exactly what he said to you. Sometimes guys talk out their asses, and you have to wade through the shit to figure out what they really mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, he was pretty clear. his exact words were \u2018End it.\u2019 And of course the stripper he was making out with at the time really drove the point home,\u201d I say bitterly.</p><p>Delores points at me. And now she looks pissed. \u201cThat, I believe. Fucking prick.\u201d She holds her hands up. \u201cBut it\u2019s okay.</p><p>Don\u2019t panic. I\u2019ll take care of everything. We have this new fuel at the lab that\u2019s ready for animal testing. he won\u2019t know what hit him\u2014I can slip it right through the vents.\u201d</p><p>She turns to Billy. \u201cYou\u2019re in charge of the garden hose and duct tape.\u201d Then she looks at me. \u201cI\u2019ll need your keys and security code.\u201d</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cDelores, you can\u2019t gas Drew to death.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt might not kill him. If I had to guess, I\u2019d say the odds for survival are fifty-fifty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDelores . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, thirty-seventy. But still, that gives us plausible deniability.\u201d</p><p>My mother and George walk into the room, interrupting the diabolical plan. My mom hugs Dee Dee tight. \u201chi, honey! It\u2019s so good to see you. Are you hungry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStarved.\u201d She looks at George. \u201chey George, how they hanging?\u201d</p><p>I think George Reinhart is a little afraid of Delores.</p><p>Maybe more than a little.</p><p>he adjusts his glasses. \u201cThey\u2019re . . . hanging well . . . thank you.\u201d</p><p>My mother coos, \u201cLook at the three of you. here, all together again, just like old times.\u201d</p><p>Delores grins. \u201cFrightening, isn\u2019t it?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>My mother takes George\u2019s hand. \u201cWe\u2019ll go cook you kids something for lunch.\u201d</p><p>They leave, and Delores rubs her hands together like the mad scientist she is. \u201cNow, back to the gas chamber . . .\u201d</p><p>I cut her off. \u201cDelores\u2014I don\u2019t think I\u2019m going to have it.\u201d</p><p>All traces of humor leave her face. She thinks for a moment.</p> <p>Looks thoughtful, but nonjudgmental. When she speaks, her voice is serious. But kind.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll support you a hundred and fifty percent, Kate; you know that. But because I know you, I\u2019m gonna say this: If you decide to do this? Make sure it\u2019s for you\u2014because it\u2019s what you want to do. If you\u2019re doing it because you think it\u2019s what Drew wants, or as some warped attempt to work things out with him? Don\u2019t. You\u2019ll just end up hating yourself for it\u2014and resenting him.\u201d</p><p>You can\u2019t bullshit best friends. And sometimes that\u2019s a double-edged sword\u2014because it means they won\u2019t let you bullshit yourself.</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t decided anything for sure. Not yet.\u201d</p><p>Delores\u2019s phone goes off in her purse, and the sound of Akon\u2019s Sexy Bitch fills the air. While she digs into her bag, she asks Billy, \u201cCould you bring my luggage up to Kate\u2019s room? I\u2019m gonna crash here tonight.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDo I look like a f**king bellboy?\u201d</p><p>Delores doesn\u2019t miss a beat. \u201cNo, you look like a homeless person. But I don\u2019t have a windshield for you to spit on. So be a good little vagrant and take my bags upstairs\u2014then maybe I\u2019ll throw a dollar at you.\u201d</p><p>With a grin, Billy goes to do it. Still, he complains, \u201cThis was so much more fun when she wasn\u2019t here.\u201d</p><p>Delores looks at her phone. \u201cUgg\u2014it\u2019s Matthew. I swear, that boy can\u2019t take a shit without calling to tell me what color it is.\u201d She walks through the back door to take the call outside.</p><p>And Billy looks at me. \u201cOkay, I\u2019m a guy\u2014and even I thought that was gross.\u201d</p><p>Can\u2019t say I disagree with him.</p> <p>A few minutes later, Delores tears back into the room. Still on the phone and going off like a cherry bomb. \u201cOf all the ignorant, balls-out shitty things to say . . . by the time I\u2019m done with you, they\u2019re going to have to reinstate your V card, buddy!\u201d</p><p>She punches the OFF button on her cell much harder than necessary.</p><p>\u201cProblem?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. The problem is, people are what\u2019s between your legs\u2014which explains why my husband is behaving like a big, fat, uncircumcised dick!\u201d</p><p>I cover my ears. \u201cTMI Delores! T. M. I.\u201d There are some things you just don\u2019t want to know about your friend\u2019s husband. What happened?\u201d</p><p>She huffs and sits down next to me. \u201cApparently, after I left for the airport this morning, Matthew went to check on Drew.</p><p>The apartment was locked up like Fort Knox, but Matthew had that extra key. So he goes in and finds your ass-hat ex-boyfriend passed out wasted, on the bathroom floor. After he went all Left Eye Lopes, setting shit on fire in the bathtub.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat!?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cExactly. Matthew said if he hadn\u2019t gone by when he did, the whole place could\u2019ve gone up.\u201d</p><p>I shake my head in disbelief. \u201cWhat was he burning?\u201d</p><p>Delores shrugs. \u201cMatthew didn\u2019t say.\u201d</p><p>Yeah\u2014but I bet it wasn\u2019t any of Drew\u2019s stuff going up in flames.</p><p>Bastard.</p><p>Delores goes on. \u201cSo Matthew got the pathetic excuse for a man sobered up. At first Drew didn\u2019t want to talk, but Matthew kept at him. And eventually, he spilled like oil in the Gulf.\u201d</p><p>My stomach clenches, \u201che . . . he . . . told Matthew about the baby?\u201d</p><p>Delores nods. \u201cMatthew said Drew told him everything that went down between you two.\u201d</p><p>Okay. This is a good thing. If Drew is telling his family I\u2019m pregnant, maybe he\u2019s changed his mind. Maybe all he needed was some time to get used to the idea. And Matthew\u2019s a great person to talk to in this situation. Not as good as Steven or Alexandra, but still\u2014he\u2019s pretty level-headed. At least compared to Drew.</p><p>\u201cWhat did Matthew say?\u201d</p><p>Delores grinds her teeth together. \u201che said he couldn\u2019t believe you would do something like this to Drew.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>Cue the music.</p><p>It\u2019s the Twilight Zone.</p><p>In the end, I knew Team New York would take Drew\u2019s side\u2014I said they would. But I thought . . . maybe . . . they\u2019d defend me. Or at the very least, be pissed off about his methods.</p><p>Delores puts her hand over mine. \u201cDon\u2019t let what Matthew said get to you. It\u2019s only natural that he\u2019d back Drew up\u2014just like I\u2019d help you bury the body, even if it was my own dear mother we were tossing into the ground.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDelores, that\u2019s sick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, really? You weren\u2019t the one who walked into the house and heard her mother knockin\u2019 boots with Sheriff Mitchell!\u201d</p><p>My mouth drops open.</p><p>Delores continues disgustedly, \u201cAnd they were loud. Like surround-sound, IMAX-theater loud. I\u2019m totally scarred for life.\u201d</p><p>Let\u2019s pause here a moment.</p><p>You\u2019ve never met the good sheriff, so I\u2019ll explain. Growing up, Sheriff Ben Mitchell was the thorn in our sides, the rock in our shoes, the pain in our asses. he had nothing better to do than follow us around\u2014breaking up our beer bashes, pulling Billy\u2019s car over and searching it for weed.</p><p>he always thought we were up to something . . . and . . .</p><p>well . . . he was right.</p><p>But that\u2019s beside the point.</p><p>Even though Sheriff Mitchell was about the same age as our parents, to us, he always seemed older\u2014like that grumpy neighbor with a cane who never lets you get the baseball that accidentally lands in his yard. Mitchell was never married and didn\u2019t date as far as we knew, so it was always assumed that his wrinkly face and piss-poor attitude came from his extreme inability to get laid.</p><p>Amelia Warren is the opposite of Mitchell in every way. She\u2019s a free spirit. An official card-carrying member of the healing Power of Crystals Club. A flower child for the modern age.</p><p>The very idea of them getting it on is equal parts horrifying and peculiar.</p><p>I shudder. \u201cYou\u2019re right. That is sick.\u201d</p><p>Billy hops down the stairs. \u201cWhat\u2019s sick?\u201d</p><p>Delores drops the bomb. \u201cAmelia and Old Man Mitchell screwing\u2014on the kitchen table.\u201d</p><p>Billy grimaces. And whines, \u201cAw, man . . . I ate on that table this morning.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I turn to him. \u201cDid you know about this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had my suspicions. But I was hoping I was wrong.\u201d</p><p>Delores agrees, \u201cWeren\u2019t we all. I don\u2019t know what was worse\u2014 having to listen to my mother moaning in ecstasy, or hearing him beg for more and having to visualize what the f**k she was doing to him.\u201d</p><p>I cover my mouth.</p> <p>And laugh.</p><p>We all do. It starts off small, and then builds\u2014to a tablesmacking, eye-tearing, bent-over-at-the-waist crescendo.</p><p>\u201cOh . . . my . . . God!\u201d</p><p>And even though Delores is cackling, she insists, \u201cIt\u2019s not funny! I think my girl parts are broken. Every time I think about it, my vagina clamps down like a littleneck clam fighting to stay closed.\u201d</p><p>We howl louder. And it\u2019s the first real, genuine laughter I\u2019ve had since this all began. My cheeks hurt and my sides ache\u2014and it feels wonderful.</p> <p>You know, sometimes I try and picture what my life would be like if Dee Dee wasn\u2019t in it. And then I stop.</p><p>Because I just really can\u2019t imagine it.</p><p>Chapter 13</p><p>After we got Delores settled in my room, Billy put a call in to his manager. he planned to do a show here at a little bar called Sam\u2019s Place, where he used to play in high school. he wanted to honor the place where he came from\u2014give something back to the locals, like Bruce Springsteen always does at the Stone Pony.</p><p>And Sam\u2019s Place is where we are right now.</p><p>It\u2019s packed\u2014standing room only. Delores and I are in front, our arms bumping against each other as we dance and sing. Billy\u2019s up on stage, a few songs into his first set. he looks fantastic. Dark jeans, a crisp white button-down, and a clean-shaven chin.</p> <p>he knows just how to work the crowd\u2014when to get them fired up with a guitar-screaming riff or settle them down with soft ballad.</p><p>I\u2019ve never been more proud of him.</p><p>The song ends and someone in the back yells that they love him. Billy looks down and laughs, a little bashful. Then he brings his mouth to the microphone. \u201cI love you guys too. So this next song is new. I haven\u2019t played it for any of the suits yet, but I wanted to play it for you tonight. It\u2019s for someone . . . who believed in me . . . even when there wasn\u2019t much of a reason to. And I want her to know that I\u2019ll always have her back, that she\u2019ll always be in my heart, and she\u2019ll never be alone.\u201d</p><p>his eyes find mine in the crowd. And he winks. I nod, message</p><p>received. Then he starts to sing.</p><p>Years feel like yesterday</p><p>And I can\u2019t believe how fast time flies</p><p>Don\u2019t want to let another second go</p> <p>Without letting you know</p><p>What you always should have known</p><p>I\u2019ll catch you if you stumble</p><p>Pick you up if you fall</p><p>Hold you when you\u2019re hurting</p><p>But baby, most of all,</p><p>I\u2019ll be there . . . so you\u2019ll never be alone</p><p>Don\u2019t ever feel alone</p><p>The beat pulses in my stomach. And I listen to the words. And I think about how lucky I am to have all the things I do. Priceless, precious blessings. I have a family that loves me. Friends who would kill for me. Literally.</p><p>And I think about who I am. I survived my father\u2019s death with my soul intact. I graduated Wharton School at the top of my class.</p><p>Remember when I first started working at the firm? And Drew Evans was the golden boy? And I put him right in his place\u2014 kicked his ass from one end of the office to the other.</p><p>I did that.</p><p>Because I was stubborn. And smart. And because I believed I was capable. Drew once told me you can change the color of the walls, but the room would still be the same.</p><p>And he was right.</p><p>I was all those things before him\u2014and I\u2019m still all those things now.</p><p>Without him.</p><p>From now on, each day that goes by Gonna give it my best try To show you what you mean to me \u2019Cause if I don\u2019t have you on my side None of this means anything Don\u2019t want to let another second go Without letting you know What you always should have known have you ever lost your keys? And you check all your pockets and pull the cushions off the couch. And then\u2014after searching for ten minutes\u2014you turn around and there they are. On the table.</p><p>Right in front of you the whole time.</p><p>Almost . . . like the answer was too easy to see right away.</p><p>That\u2019s what this feels like.</p><p>Because suddenly I know what I want. I\u2019m confident. Certain. And I know what I\u2019m capable of. It won\u2019t be easy\u2014the greatest achievements in life never are. Things like climbing Everest, or becoming the president? They\u2019re difficult. But so worth it.</p><p>I\u2019ll catch you if you stumble</p><p>Pick you up if you fall</p><p>Hold you when you\u2019re hurting</p><p>But baby, most of all</p><p>I\u2019ll be there . . . so you\u2019ll never be alone</p><p>Don\u2019t ever feel alone</p><p>I imagine myself a few years from now, walking home on the city streets from the job I love\u2014one hand holding a briefcase, the other holding the small, sweet hand of my little girl or boy.</p><p>And I picture us at the dining-room table, working on homework and talking about our day. I see story times, and bedtimes, tickle-times, hugs, and butterfly kisses.</p><p>Being a single mother wasn\u2019t something I\u2019d ever planned to be . . . but now? It\u2019s who I want to be.</p><p>I\u2019ll be there every step of the way</p><p>Won\u2019t miss a moment</p><p>I\u2019ll be there every step of the way</p><p>Won\u2019t miss a moment</p><p>You know that saying? The best-laid plans of mice and men . . . ?</p><p>You might want to remember that right about now.</p><p>Because as soon as the decision takes root in my mind, I feel a dull throbbing. You ladies will know what I\u2019m talking about. That pulling cramp in my lower abdomen. And a thick, warm wetness oozes out from between my legs, seeping into my underwear.</p><p>My heartbeat pounds against my chest, and I head for the restrooms. hoping I\u2019m wrong.</p><p>But once I\u2019m in the stall, I see that I\u2019m not.</p><p>I stumble back out of the bathroom, into the crowd. My hands shaking with dread, with fear. Because this is wrong.</p><p>Wrong, wrong, wrong.</p><p>I grab Delores\u2019s arm and tell her. But the music\u2019s too loud, and she doesn\u2019t hear me. I pull her to the back of the bar, where it\u2019s quieter, and I force the words out.</p><p>\u201cDee, I\u2019m bleeding.\u201d</p><p>Forest Gump had it all wrong.

But he\u2019s not looking at me\u2014he\u2019s too busy writing on his clipboard.</p><p>\u201cWh . . . what did you say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpontaneous abortion\u2014miscarriage. It\u2019s common in the first trimester.\u201d</p> <p>I make an effort to process his words, but I can\u2019t quite manage it. \u201cAre you . . . are you saying I\u2019m losing my baby?\u201d</p><p>Finally he looks up. \u201cYes. If you haven\u2019t already lost it. This early in gestation, it can be difficult to tell.\u201d</p><p>As he wipes the cool, clear gel off my abdomen, Delores squeezes my hand. We called my mother on the way to the hospital, but she hasn\u2019t gotten here yet.</p><p>I swallow hard, but I refuse to give up. Stubborn\u2014remember?</p><p>\u201cIs there anything you can do? hormone therapy or bed rest?</p> <p>I\u2019ll do bed rest for the entire nine months if it\u2019ll help.\u201d his tone is clipped and impatient. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing I could prescribe that could stop this. And believe me, you wouldn\u2019t want me to. Spontaneous abortion is natural selection, the body\u2019s way of terminating a fetus with some catastrophic deformity that would have prevented it from surviving outside the womb. You\u2019re better off.\u201d</p><p>The room starts to spin as the hits keep on coming. \u201cYou need to make a follow-up appointment with your regular gynecologist.</p><p>When the fetal tissue is expelled, you should scoop it out of the toilet with a strainer. Then put it in a spill-proof container\u2014a jelly jar would work well\u2014so your doctor can analyze the remains and ensure the uterus is empty. If all the uterine matter isn\u2019t . . .\u201d</p><p>I press the back of my hand against my mouth to keep the bile in. And Delores charges to the rescue. \u201cThat\u2019s enough. Thank you, Doctor Frankenstein\u2014we\u2019ve got it from here.\u201d</p><p>he\u2019s offended. \u201cI need to give the patient accurate instructions.</p><p>If tissue is left inside the uterus it could lead to sepsis, and possibly death. She may need a D&amp;C to prevent infection.\u201d</p> <p>My voice is weak. \u201cWhat\u2019s . . . what\u2019s a D&amp;C?\u201d</p><p>It sounds familiar. I\u2019m sure at some point in my life I\u2019ve learned the definition, but I just can\u2019t remember.</p><p>\u201cVacuum extraction.\u201d</p><p>Images pop into my head with his words, and I gag.</p><p>he continues, \u201cA suction hose is inserted into the cervix\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus Christ, would you stop talking!\u201d Dee Dee shouts. \u201cCan\u2019t you see she\u2019s upset? Were you in the f**king bathroom when they taught bedside manner in medical school?\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcuse me, miss, I don\u2019t know who you think you are, but I won\u2019t be spoken to\u2014\u201d</p><p>her finger points at the curtained doorway like the snap of a soldier\u2019s salute. \u201cGet. Out. She\u2019ll make an appointment with her regular doctor. We\u2019re done with you.\u201d</p> <p>A slight breeze blows past me, and I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s the doctor. Because my eyes refuse to focus, and my mind is reeling.</p><p>Trying so hard to grasp this latest turn of events . . . and failing miserably.</p><p>Delores puts her hand on my arm and my head turns toward her, surprised.</p><p>Like I forgot she was there.</p><p>\u201cKate? We\u2019re gonna get you dressed now, okay? I\u2019m going to take you home.\u201d</p><p>I nod my head numbly. It feels like I\u2019m not even here\u2014like an out-of-body experience. Or a nightmare. Because there\u2019s no way this can really be happening.</p><p>After everything . . . it\u2019s just not possible that this is how it all ends.</p><p>Delores dresses me, like I\u2019m a child. Then she helps me off the table. And together we make our way to the car.</p><p>Back in my room, Delores sits at the foot of my bed and my mother tucks the covers in around me. her eyes shine with unfallen tears.</p><p>But not mine. Mine are as dry as the Sahara.</p><p>Barren.</p><p>My mom brushes my hair back and picks lint off the bedsheets. \u201cYou want something to eat, honey?\u201d</p><p>her voice is a little desperate, grasping for some action that will somehow make this better. I shake my head without a word.</p><p>Because all the chicken soup in the world isn\u2019t going to help me.</p><p>Not this time.</p><p>She kisses my forehead and leaves the room, closing the door behind her. And Delores and I sit. Silently.</p><p>I should feel . . . relieved. I mean, just a short while ago, I thought this was what I wanted, right? Out of my hands.</p><p>Problem solved.</p><p>But the only thing I feel is . . . regret. Remorse. It fills my lungs and chokes me with every breath I take. Because deep down, under all the fear and the shock and uncertainty, I wanted this baby. I loved this perfect little piece of Drew and me. So much.</p><p>I just didn\u2019t realize it in time.</p><p>Too little, too late. You don\u2019t know what you\u2019ve got until it\u2019s gone.</p><p>All clich\u00e9s\u2014and all so f**king true. Then a thought comes to me, and I throw the covers back and jump out of bed. I open my drawers and dig through them, searching fruitlessly.</p><p>Then I drop to my knees at the closet and drag out the duffel bag I brought from New York. And I rummage through it, like a widow who\u2019s lost her wedding ring.</p><p>\u201cKatie?\u201d</p><p>And then I find it. The tiny T-shirt I bought that night. The one I was going to give to Drew\u2014to announce the big news.</p><p>I stare at it and I feel the tears come. I trace my fingers over the letters: FUTURE YANKEES PITChER. And in my head I see that little boy again. My sweet little boy.</p><p>Ours.</p><p>The one with his father\u2019s eyes and irresistible smile. The one that will never be. I bring the shirt to my face and inhale. And I swear to God it smells like baby powder.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d My shoulders shake and a monsoon pours down from my eyes. My breaths come in gasps, and I clutch the shirt against me\u2014the way a toddler does with his favorite stuffed animal. \u201cPlease . . . I didn\u2019t mean it. I was just scared . . . I wasn\u2019t going to . . .\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m not sure who I\u2019m talking to\u2014myself, or my baby, or maybe even God. I just need to say the words, so they\u2019ll be out there and real. So the universe will know that this was never how I wanted things to be.</p><p>Delores rubs my back, letting me know she\u2019s there. That she\u2019s behind me, like always. I turn to her. And with my head against her chest, I cry my heart out.</p><p>\u201cOh God, Dee. Please . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, Kate. I know.\u201d</p><p>There are tears in her voice too. Because that\u2019s how real friends are\u2014they share your pain. Your agony is theirs, even if it\u2019s not in equal measure. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay . . . it\u2019s gonna be okay,\u201d she tries.</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cNo. It\u2019s not.

Drew and I are . . . and now the baby . . . and it was all for nothing. Nothing.\u201d</p> <p>I told you I\u2019d be asking why again, remember?</p><p>Delores smooths my hair down. And her voice is calm. \u201cI don\u2019t know why, Katie. I wish I could tell you . . . but . . . I just don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>We stay like that for a while. And eventually, the tears die down. I make my way back to the bed and Delores sits beside me.</p><p>I look at the little shirt again and shake my head. \u201cIt hurts so much.</p><p>I never knew anything could feel this bad.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIs there anything you want me to do, Kate?\u201d</p><p>My eyes leak quietly. And my voice is frail. \u201cI want Drew. I want him here.\u201d</p><p>If the world was like it\u2019s supposed to be, he\u2019d be here. And he\u2019d be just as devastated as I am. he\u2019d try to hide it, but I\u2019d know. he would climb into this bed with me, and he\u2019d hold me and I would feel safe, and loved . . . and forgiven.</p><p>And he\u2019d tell me that this just wasn\u2019t the right time. But that if I want a baby, he\u2019ll give me a dozen. Drew is really big with the overkill.</p><p>And then he\u2019d kiss me. And it would be gentle and sweet. And then he\u2019d say something silly like, \u201cJust think of all the fun we\u2019ll have making them.\u201d And I\u2019d smile. And it would hurt a tiny bit less.</p><p>Just because he was with me.</p> <p>Delores nods and reaches for the phone. But my hand covers hers\u2014stopping her. her eyes look at me with understanding, like she already knows what I\u2019m thinking. And she probably does.</p><p>\u201che\u2019ll come, Kate. You know he\u2019ll come.\u201d</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cYou weren\u2019t there, Delores. he was . . .</p><p>vicious. I\u2019ve never seen him so angry. It was like . . . like he thought I was picking the baby over him. Like I\u2019d betrayed him.\u201d</p><p>I close my eyes against the memory. \u201che\u2019ll be happy. he\u2019ll be glad the baby\u2019s gone . . . and then I\u2019ll hate him.\u201d</p><p>And even after everything that\u2019s happened\u2014I\u2019m just not ready to hate Drew Evans.</p><p>Delores sighs. And her hand moves away from the phone. \u201cI think you\u2019re wrong. I\u2019ll be first in line to point out what an idiot Drew can be, but . . . I can\u2019t imagine him ever being happy about something that\u2019s hurt you. Not like this.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t answer her, because the door to my bedroom opens.</p> <p>And Billy walks in. he looks tired, his face is somber, and I know my mother\u2019s told him.</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d</p><p>I shake my head.</p><p>\u201cYeah. I figured as much.\u201d he sits down in the beanbag chair and rubs his eyes. \u201cThis is just . . . totally FUBAR. And when really f**ked-up things happen? All you can do is get f**ked up right along with it.\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s when I notice the bag he brought with him. It\u2019s supermarket brown, and bulging.</p><p>he picks it up and dumps some of the contents out. There\u2019s a few bags of weed, a carton of Marlboro reds, and two bottles of tequila. I stare at the honey-colored liquid. And I think of Mexican music, and warm skin, and midnight whispers with Drew.</p><p>I love you, Kate.</p><p>I look away. \u201cI can\u2019t drink tequila.\u201d</p><p>Like Mary Poppins with her bottomless bag, Billy reaches back in and takes out a bottle of Grey Goose.</p><p>And I nod slowly. \u201cVodka works.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 14</p><p>Have you ever licked the floor of the men\u2019s room at Yankee Stadium? Neither have I. But now I know just what it tastes like.</p><p>Yep\u2014we\u2019re hung over. It\u2019s hell. Forget the drones; if the army could unleash this feeling? There\u2019d be world peace for all.</p><p>I\u2019m in the office of my mother\u2019s gynecologist. Billy and Delores came along for moral support. See us there? Lined up in the chairs, like three delinquents waiting outside the principal\u2019s office. Delores is wearing sunglasses even though we\u2019re inside, reading a pamphlet about the new female Viagra. Billy\u2019s asleep, mouth open, head tilted up and resting against the wall behind us. My mother\u2019s here too, flipping through a magazine without reading any of the words.</p><p>And I just sit, trying too hard not to look at those pictures of newborn babies covering the walls.</p><p>Billy lets out a snot-sucking snore, and Delores jabs him in the ribs with her elbow. he wakes up sputtering, \u201cMonkey ball banana blitz!\u201d</p><p>We all look at him questioningly.</p><p>And he realizes where he is. \u201cSorry. Nightmare.\u201d Then he lays his head back against the wall again, eyes closed. \u201cI feel like gassy stool.\u201d Delores and I nod in unison. And Billy solemnly swears, \u201cI\u2019m never drinking again. I\u2019m going legit.\u201d</p><p>his cousin scoffs, \u201cheard that before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mean it this time. No more alcohol for me. From here on out, it\u2019s weed only.\u201d</p><p>Yeah. That makes sense.</p><p>Since we\u2019re waiting anyway, let\u2019s take a moment to reflect on one of the most sacred womanly rites of passage: the gynecological exam. It\u2019s completely bizarre.</p><p>See, our whole young lives, we girls are told to stay pure. Keep our legs crossed, our knees locked. And then we turn eighteen.</p><p>And we have to go to an office and meet a doctor who, based on statistics, will be a middle-aged man. And then we have to strip bare\u2014completely naked. And let him feel us up. And finger us. A total frigging stranger.</p><p>Oh\u2014and then there\u2019s the best part: the conversation. Yep, he talks to you during the exam. How\u2019s school? Sure is rainy out today, isn\u2019t it? Is your mother doing well? All in the effort to distract you from that fact that he\u2019s wrist deep in your vagina.</p><p>Can you say awkward?</p><p>And don\u2019t any of you men out there try and cry me a river about the horrors of your prostate exam. Doesn\u2019t compare. One little finger up the ass can actually be rather pleasant. At least you don\u2019t have to put your legs up in a contraption that originated as a medieval torture device. Women definitely got the raw end of the deal on this one.</p><p>A nurse in blue scrubs calls my name. My mother and I stand up and walk into the first exam room on the left.</p><p>I take my clothes off and put on the pink plastic robe, opening in the front, of course.</p><p>The better to see you with, Little Red Riding hood.</p><p>I sit on the table, the paper liner crunching beneath me. My mother stands to the side, rubbing my arm supportively. And in walks the doctor. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Take a look.

Your mother\u2019s regular physician, Joan Bordello, is on vacation\u2014\u201d</p><p>Of course she is.</p><p>\u201c\u2014and I\u2019m filling in for her.\u201d he looks down at the file in his hand. \u201cJudging by the date of your last menstrual cycle, you\u2019re almost six weeks into your first trimester?\u201d</p><p>I nod.</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019ve had some bleeding and cramping?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you describe the blood for me, please? The color? Were there any clots?\u201d</p><p>My voice is raspy. \u201cIt started out brownish-pink. Like the first day of my period. On the way to the hospital there was a gush . . .</p><p>of bright-red blood . . . and then . . . it turned brown again. I didn\u2019t . . . I don\u2019t think there were any clots.\u201d</p><p>he nods his head, and his eyes are kind. \u201cI\u2019ve read the emergency room physician\u2019s report, but I\u2019d like to take a look myself. Is that all right, Katherine?\u201d</p><p>I force a smile. \u201cOkay. And you can call me Kate\u2014everyone does.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAll right, Kate. When you\u2019re ready, slide down to the edge of the table and put your feet in the stirrups, please.\u201d</p><p>While I follow his directions, he wheels a cart over with a monitor and keyboard. And then he picks up a long plastic white wand that looks . . . well . . . like a dildo.</p><p>For an elephant.</p><p>I lift my head from the table. \u201cUh . . . what\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is an internal ultrasound. Looks a little scary, I know . . .\u201d</p><p>No shit, Santa.</p><p>\u201c. . . but it won\u2019t hurt.\u201d</p><p>And then he takes out a foil packet, tears it open, and rolls an extra-large condom onto the elephant dildo.</p> <p>Not kidding. I couldn\u2019t make this stuff up if I tried.</p><p>\u201cJust try and relax, Kate.\u201d</p><p>Sure. No problem. I\u2019ll just pretend I\u2019m at the spa. having my ovaries massaged.</p><p>he inserts the rod carefully. And I flinch. The room is silent as he moves the instrument to and fro. he wasn\u2019t lying; it\u2019s not painful. Just . . . disconcerting.</p><p>\u201cAre you still experiencing any cramping?\u201d</p><p>I stare at the beige-tiled ceiling, purposely avoiding the little screen.</p><p>\u201cNo. Not since last night.\u201d I\u2019m pretty sure the alcohol and pot disabled every pain nerve in my body.</p><p>I hear the tapping of buttons on the keyboard, and the rod is removed. \u201cYou can sit up now, Kate.\u201d I do. \u201cDo you see that flickering, right there?\u201d</p><p>My gaze settles on the screen, where he\u2019s pointing. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat is your baby\u2019s heartbeat.\u201d</p><p>The breath rushes from my lungs. And I\u2019m horrified. \u201cYou mean . . . it\u2019s still . . . alive?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d</p><p>My hands squeeze together and I feel the tears coming back up, ready to gush like a weakened dam. \u201cWhen is it going to . . .</p><p>how long will it take before . . . I fully miscarry?\u201d</p><p>he covers my clasped hands with one of his own. \u201cBased on my examination, your hormone levels, and what you\u2019ve told me, I see no reason why you should.\u201d</p><p>My head snaps up. \u201cWait . . . what? But the doctor last night said\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt can be difficult, this early, to detect a fetal heartbeat with a traditional ultrasound. As for your bleeding, some spotting in the first trimester is quite common. Now, however, your cervix is closed, your blood work is unremarkable, and the fetal heart rate is normal. All of these factors indicate a routine pregnancy that should progress to full term.\u201d</p><p>My mother\u2019s arms wrap around my shoulders, relieved and excited. But I need more. \u201cSo you\u2019re saying . . . I get to keep him?</p><p>I\u2019m going to have this baby?\u201d</p><p>Dr. Witherspoon chuckles.</p><p>It\u2019s a jolly sound.</p><p>\u201cYes, Kate. I believe you\u2019re going to keep this baby. Your due date is October twentieth. Congratulations.\u201d</p><p>I cover my mouth and the tears flow. I\u2019m smiling so big, my face hurts. And I hug my mother back. \u201cMom . . .\u201d</p><p>She laughs. \u201cI know, honey. I\u2019m so happy for you\u2014I love you so much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you too.\u201d</p><p>This is how it should have been the first time. No fear. No doubts. Only elation. Euphoria.</p><p>It\u2019s the most wonderful moment of my life.</p><p>I throw my clothes on faster than a cheating wife caught in the act and burst into the waiting room. Delores and Billy stare at me in surprise. \u201cI\u2019m still pregnant! I\u2019m not having a miscarriage!\u201d</p><p>They stand up.</p><p>\u201choly shit!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI knew Dr. Dickhead didn\u2019t know his ass from his elbow!\u201d</p><p>Smiles and hugs are passed around like acid at Woodstock.</p><p>And my best friend asks me, \u201cSo I guess your mind\u2019s made up?</p><p>You\u2019re keeping it?\u201d</p><p>My hands drop to my stomach, already imagining the bump.</p><p>\u201cUntil he turns eighteen and goes to college. And even then, I might make him live at home and commute.\u201d</p><p>She nods, bestowing the coveted Delores Warren seal of approval.</p><p>Billy drops to his knees in front of me. \u201chey, in there. I\u2019m Uncle Billy.\u201d Then he looks up at me, worried. \u201cI can be Uncle Billy, right? You gotta let me be Uncle Billy. The only other shot I\u2019ve got is Delores\u2014and who the hell knows what kind a freak of nature she\u2019s gonna squeeze out.\u201d</p><p>Delores smacks him on the head.</p><p>And I laugh. \u201cYes. You can be Uncle Billy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSweet.\u201d his attention reverts to my stomach. \u201chey, kid. Don\u2019t worry about a thing\u2014I\u2019m gonna tell you everything you need to know. Say it with me: Strat-o-caster.\u201d</p><p>Delores shakes her head. \u201cIt can\u2019t understand you, Jackass. It\u2019s like the size of a tadpole.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfter last night, it\u2019s probably a wasted tadpole. But that\u2019s cool, right? It\u2019ll build up its tolerance\u2014put hair on its chest?\u201d</p><p>Delores grins. \u201cWhat if it\u2019s a girl?\u201d</p><p>Billy shrugs. \u201cSome guys are into girls with hairy chests. You\u2019d be surprised.\u201d</p><p>I turn away from the Tweedledum-Tweedledee exchange and walk down the hall to Dr. Witherspoon. My words come out stunted. Guilty. \u201cExcuse me?

I was upset and I . . . drank alcohol and smoked cigarettes.\u201d I lower my voice. \u201cAnd marijuana. A lot.\u201d</p><p>A montage of Special Report News flashes through my mind: Fetal Alcohol Syndrome.</p><p>Super-preemies.</p><p>Low Birth Weight.</p> <p>he puts his hand on my shoulder reassuringly. \u201cYou\u2019re not the first woman to engage in some rather . . . unhealthy behaviors before learning she was pregnant, Kate. Babies in utero are heart-ier than you think. They have the ability to overcome momentary exposure to drugs and alcohol. So as long as you abstain from these substances from now on, there shouldn\u2019t be any lasting effects.\u201d</p><p>I throw my arms around his neck, almost knocking him over.</p><p>\u201cThank you! Thank you, Dr. Santa\u2014this is the best Christmas present ever!\u201d</p><p>I run back to Delores and Billy. \u201che said it\u2019s okay!\u201d We jump up and down in a circle like three kids on the playground doing Ring Around the Rosie.</p><p>And it\u2019s almost perfect. Almost. Because there\u2019s something missing.</p> <p>Someone.</p><p>The only other person on earth who\u2019s supposed to be as happy as I am at this moment. he should be here. he should be picking me up, spinning me around, and kissing me until I pass out.</p><p>And then he should be telling me that of course the baby\u2019s fine\u2014 because his studly super-sperm is indestructible.</p><p>Can\u2019t you just see it?</p><p>But he\u2019s not here. That\u2019s just the way it is. I\u2019d like to tell you it doesn\u2019t hurt\u2014that I don\u2019t miss him\u2014that I don\u2019t really care anymore. But that\u2019d be a big fat lie. I love Drew. I can\u2019t imagine ever not loving him. And I want to share this with him, more than anything.</p><p>But we don\u2019t always get everything we want; sometimes we just have to be grateful for what we have. And I am. Grateful, I mean.</p> <p>happy. Because I\u2019m going to have this baby and take care of him.</p><p>And I don\u2019t have to do it alone. Between my mother and George, Delores and Billy, there won\u2019t be any shortage of helping hands.</p><p>he\u2019s going to be loved enough for ten babies.</p><p>Forty-eight hours ago, I didn\u2019t know what I was capable of, what kind of steel pumps in my veins. Now I do. And I guess that\u2019s the moral of the story.</p><p>You have to fall down, scrape your palms and knees, before you know you have the ability to pick yourself back up.</p><p>So don\u2019t worry about me. I\u2019m going to be just fine. Eventually, I\u2019ll be great. We\u2019l be great.</p><p>We pull into the rear parking lot of the diner and my mother rushes in through the back door. She left George manning the ship, and she\u2019s a little eager to make sure he hasn\u2019t single-handedly sunk it.</p><p>As Delores, Billy, and I walk less hurriedly, Delores asks me, \u201cSo what\u2019s the plan, Stan?\u201d</p> <p>I breath deep and squint up at the sky. And it feels like a new day. A blank page. A fresh beginning. More clich\u00e9s, I know.</p><p>But still\u2014so true.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to hang here another day or so. Just . . . recharge.</p><p>Then I\u2019m going back to New York. And Drew and I are going to have a long talk. I have some things to say, and he\u2019s going to listen\u2014whether he wants to or not.\u201d</p><p>She taps my shoulder. \u201cThat\u2019s my girl. Give the bastard hell.\u201d</p><p>I grin. Billy opens the door for us but I don\u2019t follow Dee Dee inside. he asks, \u201cYou coming, Katie?\u201d</p><p>I hook my thumb over my shoulder. \u201cI\u2019m gonna go take a ride.</p><p>Clear my head, you know? Tell my mom for me?\u201d</p><p>he nods. \u201cSure. Take your time. We\u2019ll be here when you get back.\u201d</p><p>The door swings closed behind them.</p><p>And I walk to my car.</p><p>So there it is. You\u2019re all caught up now. That\u2019s my story. It was a whopper, huh?</p><p>My father used to bring me to this playground when I was young. Even then, when it was newly built, it was never very crowded. I don\u2019t know why the town chose this location to build; it\u2019s an unusual place for a children\u2019s park. There aren\u2019t any housing developments or apartment complexes nearby. And you can\u2019t see it from the main road\u2014it\u2019s off the beaten path.</p><p>Time hasn\u2019t been kind to the metal swing set frames and wavy steel slide. They\u2019re rusted, faded, and discolored from the lively primary colors they once were. Still . . . it\u2019s kind of beautiful here\u2014in an industrial modern art kind of way. It\u2019s solitary. Peaceful.</p><p>And I need as much of that as I can get. Because thinking about what comes next, what\u2019s ahead of me? I\u2019m not going to lie\u2014 it\u2019s scary. It feels like . . . moving into a new house. Exciting, but nerve-racking too. Because you don\u2019t know where the closest gas station is, or the number of the local fire department. There\u2019re so many things to learn.</p><p>I read somewhere that babies can actually hear what\u2019s going on outside the womb. That they\u2019re born knowing the sound of their mother\u2019s voice. I like that idea.</p><p>I look down at my stomach. \u201chey, Tadpole. Sorry about everything that\u2019s been going on lately. My life usually isn\u2019t this dramatic.</p><p>Although Drew would probably disagree with me on that. he tends to think I\u2019m quite the drama queen.\u201d</p><p>Drew. That\u2019s gonna be a tough one. Might as well start now\u2014 practice makes perfect.</p><p>My hand rests against my stomach, cradling it. \u201cYeah . . . your father. Your dad is like . . . a shooting star. When he\u2019s around, every other light in the sky just . . . fades out. Because he\u2019s that vibrant\u2014 you can\u2019t take your eyes off him. At least I never could.\u201d</p><p>I bite my lip. And watch as a hawk soars overhead.</p><p>Then I go on. \u201cWe loved each other. No matter what\u2019s happened or what will happen from here on out, it\u2019s important to me that you know we were in love. Your father made me feel like I was everything that mattered to him. The only thing. And I\u2019ll always be grateful to him for that. I hope you get to know him one day.</p><p>Because he\u2019s actually a really . . . great guy.\u201d I laugh softly. \u201cWhen he\u2019s not too busy being as ass.\u201d</p><p>When I finish speaking the air settles, and all is quiet for several minutes. It\u2019s so different from the parks in the city, with their honking cars, screaming children, and jogging footsteps. It\u2019s serene.</p><p>So when a car door suddenly closes nearby, it startles me. My head whips toward the sound.</p><p>And standing there is the last person I ever thought I would see out here, in Greenville, at this moment.</p><p>It\u2019s Drew.</p><p>Chapter 15</p><p>He looks awful. Stunningly, breathtakingly awful. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>his eyes are bloodshot, his face is pale, there\u2019s a few days of stubble on his chin\u2014and despite all that, he\u2019s still the most beautiful man I\u2019ve ever seen.</p><p>Looking anywhere else just isn\u2019t possible.</p><p>Drew is staring too. his gaze is unwavering\u2014drinking me in\u2014burning me up.</p><p>We stand like that for a minute. And then he walks toward me. his steps are purposeful and focused, like he\u2019s marching into a business meeting with his entire career on the line.</p> <p>he stops just a few feet away.</p><p>But it feels like much farther.</p><p>And everything I\u2019d planned on saying to him in New York flies right out of my head. So instead, I start off easy. \u201chow did you know I was here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI went to the diner first, saw your mom in the kitchen. She said she didn\u2019t know where you were. And she was looking at me like she wanted to chop my dick off and put it on the Specials Menu. So I went out front\u2014ran into Warren. he told me you\u2019d probably be here.\u201d</p><p>Of course Billy would know where I was. Just like he knew I would want him to send Drew to me.</p> <p>\u201cDid he do that to your face?\u201d I\u2019m talking about the fist-sized welt on his left cheek. It looks fresh\u2014just starting to bruise.</p><p>he touches it gingerly. \u201cNo. Delores was with him.\u201d</p><p>No surprise there. Although I don\u2019t think her heart was really in it. If Dee Dee seriously wanted to do Drew damage? She wouldn\u2019t have wasted her time with his face\u2014it would have been straight to the crotch.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want, Drew?\u201d</p><p>he lets out a short bark of laughter, but there\u2019s no humor behind it. \u201cThere\u2019s a loaded question.\u201d Then he looks off into the horizon. \u201cI didn\u2019t think you\u2019d leave New York.\u201d</p><p>I lift a brow, questioning, \u201cAfter your little show? What did you think I would do?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI thought you\u2019d curse me out, maybe smack me. I thought you\u2019d choose me . . . even if it was just to keep someone else from having me.\u201d</p><p>Jealousy. Drew\u2019s weapon of choice. he used it when he thought I wanted to win Billy back, remember?</p><p>\u201cWell, you were wrong.\u201d</p><p>he nods grimly. \u201cSo it seems.\u201d his eyes meet mine for a long moment. And his brow wrinkles just a little. \u201cWere you . . .</p><p>happy . . . with me, Kate? Because I was really happy. And I thought you were too.\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t help the small smile that comes to my lips. Because I remember. \u201cYes, I was happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen tell me why? You owe me that much.\u201d</p><p>My words come out slow, hushed sadness weighing down every syllable. \u201cI didn\u2019t plan it, Drew. You have to know that I didn\u2019t mean for it to happen. But it did. And people change. The things we want . . .</p> <p>change. And right now, you and I want two very different things.\u201d</p><p>he takes a step toward me. \u201cMaybe not.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m trying hard not to read into the fact that he\u2019s here. I don\u2019t want to hope. Because hope really does float, like a piece of wood on a wave. But if it turns out to be unfounded?</p><p>It smashes against the rocks\u2014breaking you into a thousand pieces.</p><p>\u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d</p><p>his words are careful. Planned. \u201cI\u2019m here to renegotiate the terms of our relationship.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRenegotiate?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve given it a lot of thought. You went right from Warren to me, jumped in with both feet. You\u2019ve never just . . . screwed around. Played the field. So . . . if you want to hook up with other people\u201d\u2014his jaw tightens, like the words are trying to stay in, and he has to force them out\u2014\u201cI\u2019m okay with that.\u201d</p><p>My face pinches with confusion. \u201cYou came all this way, to tell me you want us to . . . see other people?\u201d</p><p>he swallows hard. \u201cYeah. You know\u2014as long as I still get to be in the rotation.\u201d</p><p>Sex has always been a top priority for Drew. That\u2019s what this is about, right? he doesn\u2019t want the baby\u2014but he doesn\u2019t want to stop sleeping with me either? having his cake and all that. No strings attached.</p><p>It\u2019s like an episode of Jerry Springer.</p><p>\u201chow would that work exactly, Drew? A quick f**k on our lunch break? A midnight booty call? No talking allowed\u2014no questions asked?\u201d</p><p>he looks ill. \u201cIf that\u2019s what you want.\u201d</p><p>And I\u2019m so . . . disappointed. Disgusted.</p><p>With him.</p><p>\u201cGo home, Drew. You\u2019re wasting your time. I have no desire to play the field at this particular point in my life.\u201d</p><p>That takes him by surprise. \u201cBut . . . why not? I thought . . .\u201d</p><p>he trails off. And then his eyes harden. \u201cIs this about him? Are you seriously f**king telling me he means that much to you?\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t appreciate his tone. It\u2019s derogatory, mocking. Did I say I was a butterfly before? Nope. I\u2019m a f**king lioness.</p><p>\u201che means everything to me.\u201d I point my finger. \u201cAnd I won\u2019t let you make me feel bad about it.\u201d he flinches, like I\u2019ve Tasered him with a stun gun. Five thousand volts straight to the chest. But then he recovers. And he folds his arms obstinately. Completely unapologetic. \u201cI don\u2019t care. It doesn\u2019t frigging matter.\u201d</p><p>If you fill a tire with too much air, push it past its limit, do you know happens?</p><p>It explodes.</p><p>\u201chow can you say that! What the f**k is wrong with you?\u201d</p><p>he comes right back at me. \u201cAre you serious? What the hell is wrong with you? Are you on drugs? Do you have some split-fucking-personality disorder that I haven\u2019t picked up on?</p><p>Two years, Kate! For two goddamn years I\u2019ve given you everything . . . and you . . . you\u2019re just so f**king eager to throw it away!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you dare say that! The last two years have meant everything to me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen act like it! Fucking Christ Almighty!\u201d</p><p>\u201chow am I supposed to act, Drew? What do you want from me?\u201d</p><p>he yells, \u201cI want any part of you that you\u2019re willing to give me!\u201d</p><p>We both fall quiet.</p><p>Breathing hard.</p><p>Staring each other down.</p><p>And his voice drops low. Defeated. \u201cI\u2019ll take anything, Kate.</p><p>Just . . . don\u2019t tell me it\u2019s over. I won\u2019t accept that.\u201d</p><p>I fold my arms across my chest, and sarcasm crackles in the air like static. \u201cYou didn\u2019t seem to have a problem accepting it when your tongue was down that stripper\u2019s throat.\u201d</p><p>\u201chypocrisy really isn\u2019t a good look for you, Kate. You gutted me.

In celebrity magazines, on TV. One minute, couples are all soul mates, never felt this way before, jump up and down on Oprah\u2019s couch in love. And the next, they\u2019re at each other\u2019s throats\u2014dragging out the lawyers to battle over money, or houses . . . or children. I always wondered how that happens.</p><p>Take a good look. This is how.</p><p>\u201cWell, pat yourself on the back, Drew. You wanted to hurt me?</p><p>You did. Feel better now?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019m thrilled. A regular happy camper. Can\u2019t you tell?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you stop acting like a child for five minutes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDepends. Can you stop acting like a heartless bitch?\u201d</p><p>If he was close enough, I\u2019d slap him. \u201cI hate you!\u201d</p><p>he smirks coldly. \u201cConsider yourself lucky. I wish I could hate you\u2014I prayed for it. To get you out of my system. But you\u2019re still there, under my skin, like some fatal f**king disease.\u201d</p> <p>have you ever worked on one of those crossword puzzles in the newspaper? And you\u2019re determined to finish it\u2014you start off so sure that you can? But then it just gets too hard. Too exhausting.</p><p>So you give up. You\u2019re just . . . done.</p><p>I press a hand to my forehead. And even though I try to put up a strong front, my voice comes out small. \u201cI don\u2019t want to do this anymore, Drew. I don\u2019t want to fight. We can go around and around like this all day, but it\u2019s not gonna change a thing. I won\u2019t have half a relationship with you. It\u2019s non-negotiable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBullshit! Everything is negotiable. It just depends on how far the parties are willing to bend.\u201d And then he\u2019s begging. \u201cAnd I will, Kate\u2014 I\u2019ll bend. hate me all you f**king want, but . . . don\u2019t . . . leave me.\u201d</p><p>And he sounds so despondent. Desperate. I have to stop myself from comforting him. From giving in, from saying yes. A few days ago, I would have. I would have jumped at the chance to eat his crumbs. To keep him in my life\u2014any way I could.</p><p>But not today.</p> <p>Because this isn\u2019t just about me anymore. \u201cI\u2019m a package deal now. You have to want both of us.\u201d</p><p>his fists flail in the air, searching for something to hit. \u201cWhat the f**k are you talking about?\u201d he roars. \u201cIt\u2019s like I\u2019m stuck in some screwed-up Tim Burton movie, where nothing makes sense! None of this makes any f**king sense!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m talking about the baby! I won\u2019t bring a baby into a relationship where he\u2019s not wanted! It\u2019s not fair. It\u2019s not right.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t think it was possible for a person to be any paler than Drew was when he first got here, and still be alive. But I was wrong.</p><p>Because his face just got whiter. About two shades.</p><p>\u201cWhat baby? What are you . . .\u201d he scrutinizes me, trying to see the answer before he asks, \u201cAre you . . . pregnant?\u201d</p><p>Kind of makes you wonder just how hard Delores hit him, huh?</p><p>\u201cOf course I\u2019m pregnant!\u201d</p> <p>he takes a step forward. And his face looks like one of those theater masks, horror and hope side by side. \u201cIs it mine?\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t answer right away because I\u2019m so surprised by the question.</p><p>\u201cWho . . . who else\u2019s would it be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBob\u2019s,\u201d he says matter-of-factly.

The guy who means everything to you.</p><p>Obviously you\u2019ve been f**king him, so how the hell do you know the baby\u2019s not his?\u201d</p><p>I flip through my mental Rolodex, looking for a Bob, trying to figure out why in God\u2019s name Drew thinks I\u2019d be f**king him.</p><p>\u201cThe only Bob I know . . . is Roberta.\u201d</p><p>That takes the wind right out of his sails. \u201cWho?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRoberta Chang. Bobbie\u2014Bob. I went to school with her.</p><p>She\u2019s an ob-gyn. You saw me go into her office the night you followed me. That\u2019s how you knew . . .\u201d</p><p>his eyes widen, thinking. And then he shakes his head in disbelief.</p><p>In denial.</p><p>\u201cNo. No\u2014I saw you with a guy. You were meeting him. he picked you up and hugged you. he kissed you. he had food.\u201d</p><p>It takes me a moment to process his words, and then I remember. \u201cOh\u2014that was Daniel. Roberta\u2019s husband. he lived with us in during undergrad too. They just moved to the city a few months ago. I told you about them.\u201d</p><p>Drew\u2019s expression is unreadable. Then he takes a hand and rubs it down his face\u2014hard\u2014like he wants to scrape off skin.</p><p>\u201cOkay, just . . . go with me here for a second. When you wrote the name Bob in your calendar, you were talking about Roberta, who\u2019s a woman and a baby doctor that you went to school with in Boston?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the guy that I saw you with, in the parking lot, is her husband and also an old friend of yours?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>his voice is tight. Strained. \u201cAnd you think we\u2019ve been fighting this whole time because . . . ?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you don\u2019t want me to have the baby.\u201d</p><p>have you ever seen a skyscraper demolished? I have. It implodes. From the top down, so as not to damage the buildings beside it. And that\u2019s exactly what Drew does. Right in front of my eyes. he crumbles.</p><p>his legs give out and he falls to his knees. \u201cOh, God . . . Jesus Christ . . . I can\u2019t believe . . . f**k . . . I\u2019m an idiot . . . so f**king stupid . . .\u201d</p><p>And I go down with him. \u201cDrew? Are you all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo . . . no, Kate . . . I\u2019m so far from all right, it\u2019s scary.\u201d</p><p>I grab his hands and his eyes meet mine. And just like that\u2014it all makes sense. Finally.</p><p>The things he did.</p><p>The things he said.</p><p>It all falls into place like the last piece of a mosaic.</p><p>\u201cYou thought I was having an affair?\u201d</p><p>he nods. \u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>The world spins and I\u2019m barely breathing. \u201chow could you think that? how could you ever believe I would cheat on you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere was a guy\u2019s name in your calendar . . . and you lied . . .</p><p>.and I saw you hugging that man. how could you think I wouldn\u2019t want a baby?

You told me to end it.\u201d</p><p>he shakes his head and groans. \u201cEnd the affair, Kate. Not the baby.\u201d</p><p>My chin rises defensively. \u201cBut I wasn\u2019t having an affair.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWell, I didn\u2019t f**king know that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you f**king should have!!\u201d</p><p>I tear my hands from his and push him on his shoulders. \u201cGod, Drew!\u201d I stand up, needing to get away from him, because it\u2019s all too much. \u201cYou can\u2019t treat people like this!

I was so excited to tell you . . . and now whenever I think about it, all I\u2019ll remember is how horrible this has all been!\u201d I stop pacing. And my voice trembles. \u201cI needed you.</p><p>When I saw the blood . . . when they told me I was losing the baby . . .\u201d</p><p>Drew reaches for me, still on his knees. \u201cBaby, I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re saying . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you weren\u2019t here! If you\u2019d been here then you\u2019d know, but you weren\u2019t! And . . .\u201d My voice cracks and tears blur my vision.</p> <p>\u201cAnd you promised. You promised you wouldn\u2019t do this . . .\u201d I cover my face with my hands, and I cry.</p><p>I cry for every second of useless pain. For the crevasse that\u2019s still between us\u2014and for the stupid choices that created it. And I don\u2019t mean just his. I\u2019m a big girl\u2014I can take my share of the blame.</p><p>Drew may have pulled the trigger, but I loaded the gun.</p><p>\u201cKate . . . Kate, please . . .\u201d he holds his hand out to me.</p><p>\u201cPlease, Kate.\u201d</p><p>he looks shattered. And I know, then and there, that I\u2019m not the only one who\u2019s suffered.</p><p>Still, I shake my head. Because do-overs only exist in playground games. Real life doesn\u2019t have take backs.</p><p>\u201cNo, Drew.\u201d I turn my back on him and walk toward the car.</p> <p>But I only make it a few steps before I pause and look back.</p><p>Can you see him?</p><p>On his knees, his head in his hands. Like a man waiting for the executioner.</p><p>When I think of Drew, two words always stand out: passion and pride. They\u2019re ingrained. Who he is. Arguments, work, love\u2014 it\u2019s all the same to him. Full steam ahead. No hesitation, no holding back. And Drew knows what he\u2019s worth. he doesn\u2019t settle; he doesn\u2019t compromise. he doesn\u2019t have to.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you here?\u201d I whisper, so low I don\u2019t know if he\u2019ll even hear me.</p><p>But his head snaps up. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou thought I cheated on you?\u201d</p><p>he grimaces. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou thought I could be in love with someone else?\u201d</p><p>he nods.</p><p>\u201cBut you came . . . for me. Why?\u201d</p><p>his eyes drift across my face. It\u2019s the way he looks at me in the morning, when he wakes up before I do. It\u2019s the way he watches me, when he thinks I\u2019m not looking.</p><p>\u201cBecause I can\u2019t live without you, Kate. I don\u2019t even know how to try.\u201d</p><p>I was in advanced placement English in high school. For weeks, we analyzed Wuthering Heights by Emily Bront\u00eb. In most of it, heathcliff is the villain. he\u2019s ruthless, often cruel. And as a reader, you\u2019re supposed to hate him.</p><p>But I never could. Because in spite of all his despicable actions, he loved Cathy so much.</p><p>Be with me always\u2014take any form\u2014drive me mad! only do not leave me in this abyss, where I cannot find you. . . . I cannot live without my life! I cannot live without my soul! Some of you are going to say that I should\u2019ve punished Drew more. But he\u2019ll do a better job of that than I ever could. Others are going to say that I should\u2019ve made him work for it more. But we all know that he would have.</p><p>And sometimes, forgiveness is selfish. We give it not because it\u2019s earned, but because it\u2019s what we need. To find peace. To be whole.</p><p>I can live without Drew Evans. I know that, now. But if given the choice?</p><p>I won\u2019t ever want to.</p><p>There\u2019s only a dozen steps separating us, and I run every one of them. I throw myself at him, and he catches me. he wraps his arms around me and holds me so tight, I can\u2019t get air in my lungs.</p><p>But it doesn\u2019t matter. Because Drew is holding me\u2014who needs to breathe?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Kate . . . God, I\u2019m so f**king sorry.\u201d he sounds so forlorn.</p><p>And tears well up in my eyes. \u201cI didn\u2019t think we\u2019d ever . . . when you said . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cShh . . . I didn\u2019t mean it. I swear on Mackenzie I didn\u2019t mean any of it. I never wanted to . . .\u201d he buries his face in my neck, and his regret leaks from his eyes and soaks into my shirt.</p><p>I press closer against him. \u201cI know, Drew. I know you didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>his hands run through my hair\u2014they caress my face, my arms, my back. \u201cI love you, Kate. I love you so much.\u201d</p><p>Last year, Drew and I went to Japan. One day we stopped in a bonsai tree shop. They\u2019re kind of strange-looking, don\u2019t you think?</p><p>With their stunted trunks and twisted branches. The shop owner told us that it\u2019s the knots and twists that make them strong, that keep from splintering even during the harshest storm.</p><p>That\u2019s what Drew and I are like.</p><p>his lips touch my forehead, my cheeks. he holds my face in his hands, and I frame his with mine. And we kiss. Our mouths move in sync\u2014fierce and bruising, tender and slow. And all the rest, every injury, every harsh word, melts away like snow in the sunlight.</p><p>They don\u2019t matter. Because we\u2019re together. We\u2019ll find our way.</p><p>Drew presses his forehead against mine, then his hand covers my stomach. his touch is reverent and his voice is awed. \u201cAre we really having a baby?\u201d</p><p>I laugh, even though the tears are still falling. \u201cYeah. We are.</p><p>Do you really want to?\u201d</p><p>he wipes the wetness from my cheeks. \u201cWith you? Are you crazy? It\u2019s one of the few fantasies I have left. I\u2019d have twenty kids with you\u2014give those freaky Duggar people a run for their money.\u201d</p><p>I laugh again, and it feels so good. So right. I lay my head on Drew\u2019s shoulder. his face rests against my hair, breathing it in.</p><p>And then he vows, \u201cIt\u2019s okay, Kate. We\u2019re gonna be okay now.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>And I believe him.</p><p>Chapter 16</p><p>I don\u2019t know how long we stay like that, on the ground quietly clinging to each other, but when we rise the sun has moved low in the sky, beginning its descent into dusk. Drew convinces me to leave my car here, that we\u2019ll come back for it later. he\u2019s worried that I\u2019m too exhausted, too emotional to drive safely. For once, I don\u2019t argue with him.</p><p>As he drives us back to the diner, he keeps one hand on the steering wheel and one hand on me\u2014my thigh, my shoulder, or softly entwined with my own. And it\u2019s reassuring. Wonderful. I\u2019d hoped for this moment, wanted it more than I ever wanted anything else.</p> <p>To have him here, with me\u2014loving me\u2014after I\u2019d honestly never thought we\u2019d be together like this again.</p><p>It\u2019s like a movie. The reunion. The reconciliation. The happy ending.</p><p>The only problem is, in real life, there\u2019s no theme song that plays afterward. No rolling of credits. In real life, you have to deal with what happens after the reunion. The fallout from the things you said, the consequences of the things you did, that almost destroyed it all.</p><p>That still could.</p><p>That\u2019s why we watch movies like that\u2014because real life is just never that easy.</p> <p>And it\u2019s not that I\u2019m not deeply happy in a way I can\u2019t fully describe. Despite what I said earlier, there is warm comfort in the knowledge that Drew\u2019s words, the stripper, all stemmed from a terrible misunderstanding.</p><p>It\u2019s the prayer of every person who\u2019s ever been told heartbreaking news. Your son was killed in a car accident, you have stage-four cancer. The hope is always that the bearer got it wrong. A misiden-tification. A misdiagnosis.</p><p>A mistake.</p><p>But what happens after the \u201cmis\u201d? After you\u2019ve accepted tragedy as truth, or blown your life savings because you thought you only had weeks to live? What do you do then?</p><p>You step forward. You rebuild. You climb your way up from rock bottom with the determination that not only will life go back to normal, but that it will be better, sweeter.</p><p>Because hindsight is more than 20/20. Perspective doesn\u2019t just change how you look at things, it changes how you feel.</p> <p>And once you think you\u2019ve lost it all, you value every moment infinitely more.</p><p>We pull into the parking lot of the diner and walk through the back door into the kitchen, hand in hand. Like two teenagers who didn\u2019t just stay out past curfew, but stayed out all night, scaring everyone who cares about them nearly to death.</p><p>My mother stands at the counter, furiously chopping raw carrots with a gleaming knife. It\u2019s not difficult to guess she\u2019s imagining the carrot is something else entirely. George sits at the small table beside Billy. Dee Dee\u2019s on the other side of him, her cell phone at her ear.</p><p>When she spots us, she says in a low voice, \u201cThey\u2019re here. I\u2019ll call you back.\u201d And ends the call.</p><p>My mother\u2019s head jerks up. She slaps the knife down and turns to face us. Then she zeroes in on our joined hands and glares at Drew.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got a lot of nerve, showing your face here again.\u201d</p><p>Drew takes a resigned breath and tries to answer, \u201cCarol\u2014\u201d</p><p>My mom cuts him off at the knees. \u201cI don\u2019t want to hear it! You don\u2019t get to talk.\u201d She points at me. \u201cI realize my daughter is a grown woman, but to me? She\u2019s my baby. My only baby. And what you\u2019ve put her through is inexcusable.\u201d</p> <p>he tries again. \u201cI understand\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI said you don\u2019t get to talk! There\u2019s nothing you can say that will make this better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKate and I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up! When I think about how she looked when she got here . . . What makes you think you can just waltz back into her life, after the things you said to her? After what you did!\u201d</p><p>Drew keeps his mouth closed.</p><p>And my mother yells, \u201cWell, don\u2019t just stand there! Answer me!\u201d</p><p>I\u2019ve always thought of my mother as calm in the face of chaos.</p><p>Rational. That image is now totally blown.</p><p>Drew opens his mouth, but nothing comes out. Instead, he turns his baffled eyes to me. And I come to the rescue. \u201cMom, it was all a horrible mistake. Drew didn\u2019t know about the baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said you told him about the baby\u2014and his reaction was to hire to a cheap stripper!\u201d</p><p>And my newly retitled boyfriend thinks it\u2019s a good idea to point out, \u201cShe wasn\u2019t cheap, believe me.\u201d</p><p>I dig my fingernails into his palm to shut him up.</p><p>Then I explain to my mom, \u201cNo, he didn\u2019t know. he thought I was talking about something else. It was a misunderstanding.\u201d</p><p>Dee Dee interjects, \u201cNow there\u2019s a song I\u2019ve heard before. That tune\u2019s starting to get real old.\u201d</p><p>I roll my eyes. \u201cNot now, Dee.\u201d</p><p>My mother folds her arms and taps her foot. \u201cI won\u2019t have him under my roof, Katherine. he\u2019s not welcome here.\u201d</p><p>And this is why you should never complain to your family about your significant other. They don\u2019t know him like you do, and they sure as hell don\u2019t love him like you do. So they will never\u2014 ever\u2014forgive him like you will.</p><p>Even though I can see where my mom is coming from, I\u2019ve kind of got a lot on my plate at the moment. And she\u2019s really not helping the situation.</p><p>\u201cIf that\u2019s the case, then I won\u2019t be staying here either.\u201d</p><p>My mom looks shocked and her arms drop to her sides.</p><p>And Delores says, \u201chey, Moron\u2014\u201d Drew looks her way.</p><p>\u201cYes, you. This is the part where you\u2019re supposed to say you don\u2019t want to come between Katie and her mother. That you\u2019ll go stay at a hotel.\u201d</p><p>Drew snorts. \u201cGuess I\u2019m not that chivalrous. I\u2019m staying with Kate. Where she goes, I go.\u201d</p><p>Dee smirks. \u201cAww, it\u2019s like Jack and Rose on the Titanic.\u201d She raises her hand. \u201cWho else is hoping Douche Bag ends up the same way Jack did?\u201d</p><p>I ignore her and stay focused on my mother. Whose voice turns imploring. \u201cIt\u2019s been an emotional day, Katie. You need space, distance, so you can think clearly.\u201d</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cNo, Mom. I\u2019ve had all the distance I can stand. Drew wants this baby. he loves me. We need to talk, to work things out.\u201d I glance at Dee Dee. \u201cWithout audience partici-pation.\u201d</p><p>Then I turn back to my mother. \u201cAnd this wasn\u2019t all his fault.</p><p>I made mistakes too.\u201d</p><p>Like many mothers, mine is hesitant to acknowledge her child\u2019s shortcomings. \u201cIs that what he told you? That this is your fault?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s what I know. Part of this is my fault, Mom.\u201d I sigh.</p><p>\u201cMaybe it\u2019d be best for everyone if Drew and I do go to a hotel.\u201d</p><p>Stubbornness is apparently hereditary, because then she says, \u201cNo. I don\u2019t want you at a hotel. If you want him to stay, then I won\u2019t object. But I don\u2019t like it.\u201d She glares at Drew. \u201cYou just keep away from me, if you know what\u2019s good for you.\u201d</p><p>Then she stomps out of the room.</p> <p>George stands up. \u201cI should go talk to her.\u201d Before he leaves, he turns to Drew and holds out his hand. \u201cGlad to see you, son.\u201d</p><p>Drew releases my hand to shake George\u2019s, which morphs into a back-slapping man-hug. \u201cGood to know someone is, George.\u201d</p><p>George smiles and follows after my mother.</p><p>Then Billy stands up in front of us.</p><p>If you look closely, you can actually see Drew\u2019s chest puff out\u2014like an ape in the jungle wild, preparing to fight to the death over the last banana.</p> <p>\u201cGot something you want to add, Warren?\u201d</p><p>Billy looks at Drew. And then dismisses him, turning his gaze toward me.</p><p>\u201cI told him you\u2019d be at the park because I knew it was what you would\u2019ve wanted.\u201d</p><p>I smile kindly. \u201cIt was. And I appreciate that you did. We both do.\u201d</p><p>I nudge Drew with my elbow. he just shrugs, non-committedly.</p><p>And Billy says, \u201cYou don\u2019t need him, Katie. It\u2019s that simple.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI love him, Billy. It\u2019s that simple.\u201d</p><p>he holds my gaze another moment, then shakes his head and raises his hands in surrender. \u201cFor the record? You two need buckets of therapy, like yesterday. Trust me, I know dysfunctional when I see it.\u201d</p><p>I nod once. \u201cWe\u2019ll keep that in mind.\u201d</p><p>Drew scoffs, \u201cWhatever.\u201d</p><p>Delores stands up next to Billy and addresses Drew, \u201cI\u2019m gonna enjoy watching you try to claw your way out of the shitfilled septic tank you\u2019ve dug for yourself. That\u2019s going to be better than anything I can think of to do to you.\u201d She adds as an after-thought, \u201cAnd if it\u2019s not . . . I\u2019ll have to get really creative.\u201d</p><p>Don\u2019t be too disappointed in Dee\u2019s lack of retribution. Like the true friend she is, she respects my choices, even if she doesn\u2019t agree with them. She knows when to back off and let me handle things.</p><p>Or . . . she\u2019s just biding her time.</p><p>Dee pulls me into a hug and says in my ear, \u201cDon\u2019t let him f**k his way out of this one. Multiple orgasms are just a Band-Aid, not a cure.\u201d</p> <p>I chuckle. \u201cThanks, Dee.\u201d</p><p>She turns to Billy. \u201cCome on. Let\u2019s see if Amelia can stop doing the dirty with Sherriff Mitchell long enough to make us some dinner.\u201d</p><p>Billy grimaces. \u201cWay too soon to joke about that.\u201d</p><p>They walk out the back door, leaving Drew and me on our own.</p><p>I run my hand up his bicep. \u201cGeorge isn\u2019t the only one who\u2019s glad to see you. In case I didn\u2019t say it earlier . . . I\u2019m really happy you\u2019re here.\u201d</p><p>Drew smiles tenderly and touches my cheek. \u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>We go upstairs to my room, and I close the door behind me. I walk around the bed and slip off my shoes, pushing them under. The shades are drawn, and I turn on the bedside lamp, casting the room in a warm, dim glow.</p><p>\u201cIt may take some time for my mother to understand everything. She probably won\u2019t be very nice to you in the meantime.\u201d</p><p>Drew sits on the edge of the bed and shrugs. \u201cI\u2019m not concerned about your mother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe loves you. She\u2019ll fall in line when she realizes I\u2019m what you want. That I make you happy. Accomplishing that is really my only concern at the moment.\u201d</p><p>We\u2019re silent for a few seconds. I sit on the bed next to Drew, tucking my feet under my legs. Drew rubs his palms on his thighs.</p><p>Thinking.</p><p>Then he speaks what\u2019s obviously on his mind. \u201cSo . . . has Warren been here the whole time?\u201d</p><p>Although Drew spoke with Billy before he came to find me at the park, I\u2019m guessing his presence didn\u2019t fully register until now.</p><p>\u201cBilly came home to visit Amelia. he stopped by the restaurant a few days after I came home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you two have been . . . hanging out?\u201d</p><p>I know where he\u2019s going with this. Like an expert lawyer, setting up his cross-examination with a witness he\u2019s trying to trip up.</p><p>Laying the groundwork, building up to the question that will blow the case wide open.</p><p>I look down at my bed, unable to meet Drew\u2019s eyes. Feeling guilty, even though technically, I shouldn\u2019t.</p><p>Drew\u2019s habits aren\u2019t the only ones that die hard. Like always, procrastination is my friend.</p><p>\u201cIs this a conversation you really want to have right now?\u201d I ask him.</p><p>he chuckles harshly. \u201cFor the record? This isn\u2019t a conversation I want to have ever. But it\u2019s better to get all the shit out of the way now.\u201d he shakes his head slightly. \u201cWhat did you do, Kate?\u201d</p><p>My head snaps up. And I feel insulted\u2014defensive\u2014at his implied accusation.</p><p>\u201cWhat did I do? You\u2019ve got some set of balls, asking me that question.\u201d</p><p>he shrugs. \u201cI think they\u2019re pretty impressive, thanks. But my balls aren\u2019t the topic of this particular discussion. Did you f**k him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you f**k the stripper?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI asked you first.\u201d</p><p>That brings me up short. And I\u2019d probably laugh, if this all wasn\u2019t so sad.</p><p>In a resigned voice I tell him, \u201cNo. No, I did not f**k Billy.\u201d</p><p>Drew blows out his held breath. And his voice softens. \u201cMe neither. I mean . . . not Warren . . . I didn\u2019t f**k the stripper either.\u201d</p><p>I stand up from the bed. \u201cDid you want to?\u201d</p><p>Given Drew\u2019s past preference for variety, I think it\u2019s a fair question. The way I see it, this was his chance to relive the days when diversity was his norm.</p><p>\u201cNot even a little.\u201d</p><p>he slips a finger into the belt of my jeans and pulls me between his open knees. his hands rest on my hips as he looks up at me.</p><p>\u201cDo you remember that awful chick flick you made me watch last year? The one with the guy from The Office?\u201d</p><p>he\u2019s talking about Crazy, Stupid, Love. I nod.</p><p>Drew continues, \u201cAnd at the end, how he said \u2018Even when I hated you, I loved you.\u2019\u201d</p><p>I nod again.</p><p>\u201cIt was like that. It was never about what I wanted\u2014it was what I thought I had to do. It was always all about you. You were in my head, in my heart . . . even when you weren\u2019t there anymore . . . </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>you were still f**king there.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s never going to be a good time to say it. Lying or not telling him isn\u2019t a possibility.</p><p>\u201cBilly and I kissed.\u201d</p><p>his hands grip my hips tighter. The words hang in the air, like a heavy stench.</p><p>When he doesn\u2019t respond, I insist, \u201cIt didn\u2019t mean anything.\u201d</p><p>Drew smirks bitterly. \u201cSure, it didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was hurt. And confused. It was only a few seconds. And it wasn\u2019t about desire or attraction. It was just . . . comfort.\u201d</p><p>Drew moves me to the side and stands up. Then he starts to pace sharply. Every muscle in his body is drawn tight and contracted. \u201cI told you this would happen. All this time, I f**king told you. That f**kface has just been waiting for the opportunity to sneak his way into your pants again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not like that, Drew. It was innocent.\u201d</p><p>The image of Drew\u2019s salacious kiss with the stripper slams to the forefront of my thoughts. And my anger is right behind it. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t anything like what you did. What I had to watch you do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd that\u2019s supposed to make me feel better?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not trying to make you feel better! I\u2019m trying to explain what happened. So we can put it behind us and move on. That\u2019s what you want, isn\u2019t it ? Isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>The desperation in my voice must have gotten through to him.</p><p>Because he stops pacing and looks at me for several moments.</p><p>his blue eyes show warring emotions of indignation and begrudging understanding. With the desire to give in to a fury that will serve no purpose\u2014a fury that Drew must know he has no right to feel.</p><p>he blows out a breath and sits back on the bed. \u201cYes, that\u2019s what I want.\u201d</p><p>I smile sadly. \u201cMe too.\u201d</p><p>he doesn\u2019t look at me, but stares straight at my bedroom door.</p><p>\u201cIt was just a kiss?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo second base? No sliding into third?\u201d</p><p>I roll my eyes. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Tensely, he nods. \u201cOkay . . . okay. That evens things out, I guess.\u201d he\u2019s quiet for a moment. Then he says firmly, \u201cI don\u2019t want you talking to him again. Ever.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDrew\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mean it, Kate. I don\u2019t want him calling the apartment or emailing you. I don\u2019t want you meeting him for a goddamn lunch date or girls\u2019 night out.\u201d his eyes burn into mine as he pleads, \u201cI want Billy Warren out of our life. Permanently.\u201d</p><p>I close my eyes. Because I knew this was coming. And don\u2019t think I don\u2019t understand how Drew feels. Maybe you even agree with him.</p><p>But choosing between Billy and Drew isn\u2019t an option. Maybe it\u2019s selfish, but I need them both. Drew is my lover, the love of my life, the father of my child. But Billy is my best friend\u2014right up there with Dee Dee.</p><p>\u201che\u2019s my friend.\u201d My expression is stoic, telling him without words that I won\u2019t give in. Not about this, not this time.</p><p>his jaw clenches. \u201chow can you ask me to do this? how can you f**king expect me to see him and watch you talk to him and not obliterate him?\u201d</p><p>I take Drew\u2019s hands in mine, holding them tight. \u201cIf you and I decided to not be together anymore, I still wouldn\u2019t be with Billy again. Ever. And he wouldn\u2019t want to be with me.</p><p>\u201cAnd when I first came here, I believed you didn\u2019t want this baby. And I didn\u2019t think I could have it alone. Billy made me see that I could. And more importantly, he helped me realize that I wanted to.\u201d</p><p>Drew turns away.</p><p>I cup his face in my hands and bring him back to me. \u201cIf Billy hadn\u2019t been here for me, there\u2019s an excellent chance I would\u2019ve had an abortion before you came. Think about that. Think about what we would\u2019ve lost, Drew. And that I never would have been able to forgive myself\u2014or you. I owe him for that. We owe him for that.\u201d</p><p>he closes his eyes tightly. I don\u2019t really expect him to agree with me. It\u2019s a hard pill for any man to swallow, especially a man like Drew. But he listened. And I can only hope that he\u2019ll think about what I said and realize that my life\u2014our life\u2014is better with a friend like Billy in it.</p><p>The fact that he\u2019s not actively disagreeing with me is enough for now.</p><p>he rubs his eyes wearily with the palms of his hands. When they drop, he asks me a question. And there\u2019s despondent curiosity in every syllable. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you just tell me, Kate? When you first thought you could be pregnant. Why didn\u2019t you say anything?\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s something you\u2019ve been wondering about too, isn\u2019t it? None of this would\u2019ve happened if I hadn\u2019t kept my suspicions to myself.</p><p>If Woody would\u2019ve gone right to the police . . .</p><p>\u201cI was . . . stunned. Scared. I didn\u2019t even know how I felt about the possibility of being pregnant and . . . I wasn\u2019t sure how you would feel about it. I needed time to process it. To accept it.</p><p>To\u2014eventually\u2014be excited about it. And I was. After my appointment with Bobbie, I was happy. I was coming home to tell you . . .</p><p>but . . . it was too late.\u201d</p><p>Drew tells me, \u201cI tried so goddamn hard not to jump to conclusions. Again. When I saw a guy\u2019s name in your calendar and then you lied about where you were going . . . I was really pissed.</p><p>But then I cooled off and I thought, maybe it was good thing.</p><p>Maybe you were going to buy me something, or plan a surprise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd instead of asking me, or waiting to see what the surprise was, you followed me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t just sit there. I had to do something. And then I saw you, in the parking lot, looking so happy to see that son of a bitch.</p><p>I never thought you\u2019d cheat on me. I didn\u2019t want to believe it, but it was right there in front of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy grandmother used to say, \u2018Don\u2019t believe anything you hear, and only half of what you see.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>Drew snorts. \u201cShe was f**king genius.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m willing to accept the part I played in the situation, but I don\u2019t have a martyr complex. So I ask, \u201cIf you thought I was cheating on you, why couldn\u2019t you react like a normal guy? Punch a wall or get drunk. Why do you have to come up with these diabolical schemes, like some super-villain from Batman?\u201d</p><p>he shakes his head and touches my hair. \u201cWhen I thought I saw what I saw . . . it was a nightmare. It was hell. Nothing God or Satan could ever dream up would come close to feeling as awful as that.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI can relate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I just wanted it to go away. The f**king crushing pain.</p><p>Even for a little while. So, after I bought the bottle of Jack, I went to this gentleman\u2019s club me and the guys used to go to in the old days. She was just . . . there. And you know what they say\u2014the best way to get over someone is to get on top of someone else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNobody says that, Drew.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell, they should. Anyway, I got the idea that if you saw me with someone else, you\u2019d realize what you were losing. And then you\u2019d . . . stop . . . and come back to me. Plead for mercy. Beg my forgiveness. I had it all planned out.\u201d</p><p>Dryly, I reply, \u201cYeah, that worked out well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI said it was a plan\u2014I didn\u2019t say it was a good plan.\u201d</p><p>he turns somber. \u201cWhen you walked out . . . I went a little insane. I just couldn\u2019t believe . . . that you didn\u2019t pick me.\u201d And he sounds so broken, so unlike the man I\u2019ve lived with for two years.</p><p>Guilt- and grief-laden tears fall from my eyes. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p> <p>Drew pulls me into his arms. his lips rest against my neck as he professes, \u201cI\u2019m so sorry, Kate.\u201d Then he pulls back and wipes my cheeks. \u201cPlease don\u2019t cry. I don\u2019t want to make you cry ever again.\u201d</p><p>I sniffle and rub the wetness from my eyes. \u201cThat first night, after dinner at your parents\u2019, what would you have said if I\u2019d told you then?\u201d</p><p>A small smile tugs at his lips as he imagines the wonderful what-if. \u201cI would\u2019ve gone to the pharmacy, no matter what time it was, and I would\u2019ve bought one of those home pregnancy tests.</p><p>Or ten! And I would\u2019ve sat at the table with you while you drank a gallon of water so we could use every frigging one.\u201d</p><p>I chuckle tearily, because that sounds about right.</p><p>\u201cAnd when they all came back positive, I would\u2019ve lined them up and taken a picture with my phone so we could text it to your mom and my parents, Matthew, and Alexandra. And then I would\u2019ve picked you up and carried you to the bedroom, and I would\u2019ve spent the next few hours wearing us both out. But it would\u2019ve been slow, gentle, because I probably would\u2019ve been worried about hurting you. And then, after, when we were lying there . . . I would\u2019ve told you I can\u2019t wait for the next nine months to go by.\u201d his beautiful blue eyes shine with tenderness and passion. \u201cBecause I just know we\u2019ll make the best kind of babies.\u201d</p> <p>With a laugh, I brush his dark hair off his forehead. Then I lean forward and seal his sweet dream with a kiss.</p><p>And he asks me, \u201cIf I\u2019d been alone in the apartment that night, what would you have said? how would you have told me?\u201d</p><p>My eyes fill up with tears again, and I get up from the bed and take the tiny baby T-shirt from my dresser drawer. I hold it behind my back as I move to stand in front of Drew.</p><p>I say softly, \u201cI would\u2019ve sat you down and told you that when I started working at the firm, I never expected to meet someone like you. And that I never expected to fall in love with you. I really never expected you\u2019d love me every bit as much in return. And then I would\u2019ve said that the greatest things in life are the ones you never expected. And then I would\u2019ve given you this.\u201d</p><p>I place the shirt in his hands. he unfolds it slowly, and as he reads the words, his lips curve into an elated, proud smile.</p><p>his voice is rough with emotion as he says, \u201cThat\u2019s really, really good.\u201d</p><p>he sets the shirt aside. Then he pulls the covers back from the bed. he grasps the hem of my shirt and lifts it over my head.</p><p>Undressing me, baring me to him. My jeans go next, and I stand before him in my beige lace bra and underwear. I unbutton his shirt slowly. My hands skim his shoulders and chest, reacquainting myself with the body I missed so much.</p> <p>But there\u2019s nothing sexual about it. When Drew is clad only in boxers, he turns the lamp off and we climb under the covers. I\u2019m so looking forward to a good, deep sleep. Finally. I see the same weariness in Drew.</p><p>Emotional exhaustion can be more draining than any of those sixty-day insanity workout programs.</p><p>Drew lies on his back; my head rests against his chest. he kisses the top of my head as he smooths the hair down my back.</p><p>My voice is small as I ask, \u201cDo you still think I\u2019m perfect?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d he asks in a sleepy voice.</p><p>I lift my head to look at him. \u201cYou say it all the time. When we\u2019re at work, when we\u2019re making love\u2014sometimes I don\u2019t know if you even realize it. You tell me I\u2019m perfect. After everything now, do you still think that?\u201d</p><p>I know I\u2019m actually far from perfect. No one is. But I\u2019m not interested in reality\u2014I just want to know if his opinion of me has changed. If in his eyes, I\u2019m less than I was.</p><p>he touches my face, tracing my lips with his thumb. \u201cI still think you\u2019re perfect for me. Nothing\u2019s ever gonna change that.\u201d</p><p>I smile and lie back down. Then, with our limbs entwined, we fall asleep.</p><p>Chapter 17</p><p>When my eyes open the next morning, it\u2019s early. Gray light seeps through the curtains, but the sun hasn\u2019t risen yet.</p><p>And the space beside me is empty. I\u2019m alone.</p><p>For one horrible, irrational moment, I think it was all a dream.</p><p>Drew\u2019s coming here to Greenville, our reconciliation\u2014just a vivid delusion brought on by too many Lifetime television miniseries and Julie Garwood romance novels.</p><p>Then I see the note on the end table.</p><p>Don\u2019t panic. Went downstairs to get coffee and breakfast. Be back ASAP. Stay in bed.</p><p>Relieved, I turn on my back and close my eyes. I know from experience that if I get up too quickly, the nausea will hit with a vengeance. I don\u2019t mind the morning sickness so much anymore.</p><p>Sure, no one enjoys heaving their intestines out, but in a weird way it\u2019s reassuring. Like my body\u2019s way of telling me we\u2019re A-OK. All systems go.</p><p>Ten minutes later, I rise slowly and slip on my robe. Then I make my way downstairs, following the scent of fresh brewing coffee.</p><p>Outside the rear kitchen entrance, I hear Drew\u2019s voice.</p><p>Instead of going in, I peek through the crack near the door hinge.</p><p>Drew\u2019s at the counter, whisking flour in a stainless steel mixing bowl. My mother sits stiffly at the table in the corner. Looking at bills, punishingly pushing the buttons on a large calculator. her face is stern, angry\u2014hell bent on ignoring the other person in the room.</p><p>I listen and watch, catching the end of Drew\u2019s story. \u201cAnd I said \u2018Two million? I can\u2019t bring my client that offer. Come back when you\u2019re serious.\u2019\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>he glances at my mother, but there\u2019s no reaction. he goes back to whisking and says, \u201cIt\u2019s like I was telling Kate a few weeks ago\u2014 some guys need to learn when they\u2019re beaten.\u201d</p><p>My mother slaps a bill on the table and picks up the next one in the pile.</p><p>Drew sighs. Then he puts the bowl on the counter and sits down across from my mother. She doesn\u2019t acknowledge him at all.</p><p>he thinks for a moment, rubbing his knuckles against the scruff of his chin. Then he leans toward my mother and says, \u201cI love your daughter, Carol. Like . . . I\u2019d-take-a-bullet-for-her kind of love.\u201d</p> <p>My mother snorts.</p><p>Drew nods. \u201cYeah, I get it. That probably doesn\u2019t mean a whole hell of a lot to you. But . . . it\u2019s true. I can\u2019t promise that I won\u2019t screw up again. But if I do, it won\u2019t be as epic as my most recent clusterfuck. And I can promise I\u2019ll do everything I can after to make it up to Kate . . . to make it right.\u201d</p><p>My mother continues to stare at the bill in her hand like it has the cure for cancer on it.</p><p>Drew sits back, gazes toward the window, and smiles a little.</p><p>\u201cWhen I was a kid, I wanted to be my father. he always wore these awesome suits and he went to work at the top of a huge building.</p> <p>And he always had everything together, like the whole world was at his fingertips. When I met Kate . . . no . . . when I realized Kate was it for me, all I wanted to be was the guy who made her happy.</p><p>Who surprised her, made her smile.\u201d</p><p>For the first time, my mother looks at Drew. he returns her stare and tells her in a determined voice, \u201cI still want to be that guy, Carol. I still think I can be. And I hope, one day, you\u2019ll think that too.\u201d</p><p>After a moment, Drew stands and goes back to making breakfast at the counter.</p><p>I wait, watching, as my mother continues to sit at the table, silent and unmoving. Isn\u2019t that what every parent wants to hear?</p><p>That the singular goal of the person their child loves is to make them happy? I can\u2019t believe she\u2019s not moved by Drew\u2019s words.</p> <p>She says, \u201cYou\u2019re doing that wrong.\u201d</p><p>Drew stops whisking and turns to my mother. \u201cI am?\u201d</p><p>She stands and takes the bowl from his hands. \u201cYes. If you stir too much, the pancakes will be heavy. Too thick. You need to mix it just enough to blend the ingredients.\u201d She gives Drew a small smile. But it\u2019s enough. \u201cI\u2019ll help you.\u201d</p><p>Slowly, Drew smiles back. \u201cThat would be great. Thank you.\u201d</p><p>Yep\u2014cue the warm and fuzzy. My heart melts just a little.</p><p>Because every girl wants her mother to see the good in the man she loves.</p><p>I breeze into the kitchen. \u201cMorning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMorning, honey. how are you feeling?\u201d my mother asks.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m good. Really good.\u201d</p><p>I walk up to Drew, who kisses me softly and wraps an arm around my shoulder. \u201cWhat are you doing up? Didn\u2019t you get my note?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did. But I wanted to see what you were up to. how\u2019s it going?\u201d</p><p>he winks. \u201cWe\u2019re getting there.\u201d</p><p>We stay in Greenville for another day before taking a late-night flight back to New York. First thing Saturday morning, we step over the threshold together into our apartment.</p><p>I glance around the living room as Drew puts our bags in the corner. The apartment is freshly cleaned, sparkling, and smells of lemon-scented furniture polish. It looks exactly the same as when I walked out a week ago. Unchanged.</p><p>Practically reading my mind, Drew offers, \u201cI had the cleaning people come by.\u201d</p><p>I look down the hall toward the bathroom. \u201cAnd the bonfire?\u201d</p><p>We\u2019d talked about Drew\u2019s foray into pyromania. he said he\u2019d burned a few pictures, but there are copies. Nothing was lost that can\u2019t be replaced.</p><p>Kind of poetic, don\u2019t you think?</p><p>Somberly, I tell him, \u201cDrew, we need to talk.\u201d</p><p>he regards me cautiously. \u201cNo conversation in the history of the world that started with that phrase has ever ended well. Why don\u2019t we sit down.\u201d</p><p>I sit on the couch. he takes the recliner and swivels to face me.</p><p>I get right to the point. \u201cI want to move out.\u201d</p><p>he rolls my words around in his head as I brace myself for the argument that I know is coming.</p><p>But he just nods slightly. \u201cYou\u2019re right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, of course.\u201d he looks around the room. \u201cI should have thought of this before. I mean, this is where your worst nightmare came true. Like the Amityville Horror house\u2014who the hell would want to live there?\u201d</p><p>he\u2019s taking this much better than I thought. Until he continues, \u201cMy sister has a great real estate agent. I\u2019ll call her right away.</p><p>We can stay at the Waldorf if you want, until we find a new place.</p><p>In this market, it shouldn\u2019t take long.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Drew\u2014I said I want to move out. Alone. I want to get my own apartment.\u201d</p><p>his brow furrows. \u201cWhy would want to do that?\u201d</p><p>You\u2019re probably wondering the same thing. I\u2019ve been thinking about it, planning it out in my head, since I decided I wanted to keep the baby, with or without Drew. Because there are different kinds of dependence. I\u2019ve always wanted to be financially secure, and now I am. But I\u2019ve never been emotionally independent. On my own. And at this point in my life, it\u2019s something I want.</p><p>If only to prove to myself that I\u2019m capable of it.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never lived by myself. Did you know that?\u201d</p><p>Still bewildered, he says, \u201cO-kay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFirst year of undergrad, I lived in the dorms. Then Dee, Billy, and I and a bunch of other people got a place off campus. After that, it was always me and Billy or me, Dee, and Billy sharing a house or an apartment. And then, I moved in here with you.\u201d</p><p>Drew leans forward, resting his elbows on his knees. \u201cWhat\u2019s your point, Kate?\u2019 \u201cMy point is, I\u2019ve never not had someone to come home to.</p><p>I\u2019ve never decorated or bought a piece of furniture without consulting someone. I\u2019m twenty-seven years old, and I\u2019ve practically never slept alone.\u201d</p><p>he opens his mouth to argue, but I go on, \u201cAnd . . . I think you made a valid point about us rushing into things. We went from a weekend hook-up to living together overnight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd look how great that turned out! I know what I want, and I want you. There was no point in waiting, because\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut maybe there would\u2019ve been a point in waiting, Drew. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Maybe we would\u2019ve had a stronger foundation to our relationship if we had just . . . dated . . . for a while before moving in together. Maybe, if we had gone slower, none of this would\u2019ve happened.\u201d</p><p>he\u2019s annoyed. And a little panicked. he\u2019s trying to hide it, but it\u2019s there.</p><p>\u201cYou said you forgave me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have. But . . . I haven\u2019t forgotten.\u201d</p> <p>he shakes his head. \u201cThat\u2019s just chick-speak for you\u2019re going to hang this shit over my head for the rest of our lives!\u201d</p><p>he\u2019s got a point. I\u2019d be lying if I said there wasn\u2019t a small part of me that wants to drive the point home\u2014that he can\u2019t treat me any way he wants to. That there are consequences to his actions.</p><p>That if he ever screws up again, I can\u2014and will\u2014leave him.</p><p>But it\u2019s not just about that.</p><p>\u201cYou want to redecorate?\u201d he asks. \u201cBe my guest. You want to paint the walls pink and put unicorn f**king sheets on the bed? I won\u2019t say a word.\u201d</p> <p>Now I\u2019m shaking my head. \u201cI need to know I can do this, Drew. For me. And . . . when our son or daughter moves out on their own, I want to know what that feels like, so I can help them.\u201d</p><p>At this point, I expect Drew to agree to pretty much anything I want him to.</p><p>Women know when they have the upper hand. You know what I mean. The days after your husband forgot your anniversary, or your boyfriend spent one too many hours at the bar with his boys watching the game. The days following an argument, when the win is in the female\u2019s column, are peaceful. Loving. Men go out of their way to be thoughtful and considerate. They put their shoes in the closet, take out the garbage without being asked, and remember to put the seat up before they pee.</p><p>So although I realize Drew\u2019s not going to be happy with my reasoning, I imagine he\u2019ll still be understanding and helpful.</p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s f**king stupid!\u201d</p><p>Not exactly what I\u2019d imagined.</p> <p>I cross my arms over my chest. \u201cNot to me, it\u2019s not.\u201d</p><p>he jumps to his feet. \u201cThen you\u2019re insane!\u201d he pushes a hand through his hair and regains his composure.</p><p>When he speaks, his words are calm, reasonable; the levelheaded businessman making his pitch. \u201cOkay . . . let\u2019s agree the last few days have been pretty emotional. And you\u2019re pregnant\u2014you\u2019re not thinking clearly. When Alexandra was pregnant she wanted to chop all her hair off, Miley Cyrus style. The hairdresser talked her out of it, and in the end she was glad. So . . . let\u2019s put a tack in this idea . . . and revisit it later.\u201d</p><p>I sigh. \u201cThis will be good for us. We\u2019ll still see each other every day, but a little time apart, some space . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou told your mother you didn\u2019t need space. That we needed to be frigging together to work through this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was then,\u201d I say with a shrug. Then I go for the old reliable, \u201cIf you love something, let it go. If it comes back to you, it\u2019s yours.\u201d</p><p>he pinches the bridge of his nose. \u201cSo . . . you\u2019re going to prove you\u2019re never going to leave me . . . by leaving me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019m going to prove I\u2019ll never leave you . . . by coming back to you.\u201d</p> <p>Drew pulls the front of his pants away from his waist and looks down. \u201cNope\u2014still got a dick. Which explains a lot, because your reasoning would only make sense to a woman.\u201d</p><p>I roll my eyes. And Drew presses on, \u201cYou\u2019re f**king pregnant, Kate! We\u2019re having a baby. Now is not the time to take a step back and figure out if you want to be in a relationship!\u201d</p><p>I take his hand and sit him down next to me on the couch.</p><p>\u201cDo you remember everything you did, before I moved in here?</p><p>The flowers, the balloons, the Sister B pep talk, the home office overhaul\u2014they were beautiful gestures. Showing me how much you wanted me, and how willing you were to change your life for me.\u201d</p><p>I look down at our joined hands. \u201cBut they also made for an offer I couldn\u2019t refuse. No woman could. And I think part of you believes that you manipulated me into moving in with you. That if you hadn\u2019t pestered me and laid it on so thick, I never would have chosen you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee what I mean? And that\u2019s just not true. It may have taken time for me to trust you again, to believe that you were ready for a relationship, but I would have. I still would have been in love with you and wanted a life with you, because of who you are. Not because of the things you did for me. This will fix that, Drew. So you\u2019ll never doubt why I\u2019m with you.\u201d</p><p>he takes his hand back and rubs it over his face. \u201cSo . . . you want to pay for an apartment, pack up all your stuff, buy furniture, go to all the trouble of relocating . . . just to prove to me and to yourself that you can? Knowing that at some point, you\u2019re just going to move back in with me anyway?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, when you put it like that, it sounds ridiculous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes! Thank you. Take out all the psycho, emo-babble bullshit and it is ridiculous!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo\u2014it\u2019s not. Because, later, when we decide to live together again, we\u2019ll be on equal footing. It won\u2019t be you making room in your life for me\u2014it\u2019ll be us making a decision together. For all the best reasons.\u201d</p><p>he looks away toward the door, thinking. Then he turns back to me. \u201cNo. I\u2019m sorry, Kate: I want to make you happy, I do. But I can\u2019t support something that\u2019s so pointless. I won\u2019t agree with it.</p><p>I won\u2019t. Just\u2014no.\u201d</p><p>he crosses his arms and pouts. Like a two-year-old refusing to move until he gets his way.</p><p>There was a time, not so long ago, that his refusal would have swayed me. That I would\u2019ve let his opinion become my opinion. That I would\u2019ve given in for the sake of our relationship and my sanity.</p><p>But not anymore.</p><p>I stand up. \u201cI\u2019m doing this, Drew, with or without you. I really hope it can be with you.\u201d</p><p>Then I walk down the hall to the bedroom.</p><p>I stand in the middle of the room for a few minutes, remembering.</p><p>Some of the most wonderful, and romantic, moments of my life have taken place in this room.</p><p>I\u2019d be lying if I said I wasn\u2019t going to miss it.</p><p>But I\u2019m firm in my belief that my moving out will be good for us. That, at some point, it will make the difference between us crumbling under the weight of our own passion and stubbornness or becoming an even stronger pair than we were before. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I just wish Drew would see it that way.</p><p>With a sigh, I move to the closet to get my luggage. I only took one small bag with me when I left a week ago, so there are a lot of clothes to be packed. I spot the large beige leather suitcase on the top shelf.</p><p>Walk-in closet shelves really weren\u2019t designed with the petite in mind. I stretch on my tippy-toes, trying to grasp the handle. I consider getting a chair from the other room, but I try jumping for it first.</p><p>As I bend my knees for my second attempt, I hear Drew come up behind me. he reaches over my head, easily taking hold of the suitcase, and brings it down.</p> <p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t stretch your arms over your head. It\u2019s not good for you . . . for the baby.\u201d he walks out of the closet and lays the suitcase on the bed.</p><p>\u201chow do you know that?\u201d I ask as I trail behind him.</p><p>he shrugs. \u201cWhen Alexandra was pregnant, I read a lot. I wanted to be prepared in case she went into labor at a family function, or if we got stuck in a cab together during rush-hour traffic.\u201d</p><p>he unzips the bag and adds, \u201cI would\u2019ve had to gouge my f**king eyeballs out afterward, of course, but it would\u2019ve been worth it.\u201d</p><p>I smile.</p> <p>he takes me by the shoulders and sits me down on the edge of the bed. \u201cJust . . . put your feet up. Rest.\u201d</p><p>Then he turns toward the dresser and takes a stack of my T-shirts out of the drawer, placing them neatly in the suitcase. he doesn\u2019t look at me as he works.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re helping me pack?\u201d</p><p>he nods stiffly. \u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you still don\u2019t want me to move out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd . . . you still think it\u2019s a stupid idea?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. You don\u2019t have many stupid ideas\u2014but even if you did, this would be the dumbest of them all.\u201d</p><p>he takes another pile from the drawer as I ask, \u201cThen why are you helping me?\u201d</p><p>he drops the pile in the bag and makes eye contact. And his face says everything that he\u2019s feeling\u2014frustration, resignation . . .</p><p>devotion.</p><p>\u201cIn the last two years, I\u2019ve probably told you a dozen times that I would do anything for you.\u201d he shrugs. \u201cIt\u2019s time I put up or shut up.\u201d</p><p>And this . . . this is why I love him. I suspect it\u2019s why you love him too.</p><p>Because despite his faults and flaws, Drew is bold enough to give me everything he\u2019s got. To put his heart on the chopping block and hand me the ax.</p> <p>he\u2019ll do things he hates, just because I ask him to. he\u2019ll go against his instincts and better judgment, if it\u2019s what I need. he puts his well-being, his happiness, second to my own.</p><p>I stand up, wrap my arms around his neck, and press my lips to his. A moment later, my feet leave the floor and his hand buries in my hair. his mouth captures my moan as he presses me closer.</p><p>I pull back and tell him, \u201cYou\u2019re amazing.\u201d</p><p>he gives me a soft smirk. \u201cThat is the general consensus.\u201d</p><p>I smile. \u201cAnd I love you.\u201d</p><p>he sets my feet on the floor but keeps his arms around my waist. \u201cGood. Then you\u2019re going to let me put three locks on the door of whatever apartment you decide to move into. And a chain.</p><p>And a dead bolt.\u201d</p><p>I smile wider. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>Drew slowly steps forward, backing me up toward the bed.</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re not going to bitch when I have a security system installed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWouldn\u2019t dream of it.\u201d</p><p>We take another step together, almost like we\u2019re dancing.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m thinking about buying you one of those \u2018I\u2019ve fallen and I can\u2019t get up\u2019 necklaces too.\u201d</p><p>My eyes squint as I pretend to think about the idea. \u201cWe\u2019ll talk about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd . . . you\u2019re going to let me walk you home from work every night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>The back of my legs make contact with the bed frame.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m also going to come to every doctor\u2019s appointment with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t for a second imagine you wouldn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Drew cups my face in his hands. \u201cAnd one day, I\u2019m going to ask you to marry me. And you\u2019re going to know it\u2019s not because you\u2019re pregnant, or because of some misguided attempt to keep you.\u201d</p><p>Tears spring into my eyes as we gaze at each other.</p><p>In a rough voice, he continues, \u201cYou\u2019re going to know I\u2019m asking because nothing would make me prouder than to be able to say, \u201cThis is my wife, Kate.\u201d And when I do ask, you\u2019re going to say yes.\u201d</p><p>When I nod, one tear trails down my cheek. Drew wipes it away with his thumb as I promise, \u201cIt\u2019s a sure thing.\u201d</p><p>And then he\u2019s kissing me, with all the passion and desire he\u2019s held in check the last two days. Drew cradles my head as we fall on the bed together. Then I arch up, and heat spreads across my stomach and down my thighs as I rub myself against where he\u2019s already hard and ready.</p><p>Resting his elbows on the bed above my shoulders, Drew lifts his head and pants, \u201cSo . . . is this make-up sex . . . or break-up sex?</p><p>Because I have really fantastic ideas for either one.\u201d</p><p>I open my legs wider, nestling Drew between them. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely make-up sex, maybe a little bit of take-a-break sex. And a whole lot of last-day-in-the-apartment sex. That\u2019s a lot to cover\u2014so it\u2019s going to take a really, really long time.\u201d</p><p>Drew smiles. And it\u2019s his boyish, delighted smile\u2014one of my favorites\u2014that only comes out on very special occasions.</p><p>\u201cI adore the way you think.\u201d</p><p>And we don\u2019t leave the bed for the rest of the day.</p><p>Epilogue</p><p>Eight months later</p><p>So . . . I\u2019ve gone back to church. Every week. Sometimes twice a week.</p><p>Yeah\u2014it\u2019s me, Drew.</p><p>Long time no see. Miss me? Judging from the \u201cI\u2019d like to shove your dick in an automatic pencil sharpener\u201d look on your face . . .</p><p>I\u2019m guessing that\u2019s a no.</p><p>Still pissed, huh? Can\u2019t say I blame you. It was a solid three weeks before I could look at my reflection in the mirror and not want to kick my own ass. In fact, one night I was out with the guys celebrat-ing a massive deal Jack closed, and after one too many shots of J\u00e4ger, I begged Matthew to punch me in the nuts as hard as he could.</p><p>Because I couldn\u2019t stop seeing the look on Kate\u2019s face when she walked in the door that horrible night. It replayed in my head over and over, like one of those awful films on cable that\u2019s constantly on, but no one ever watches. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Lucky for me, Matthew refused. Even luckier is that fact that Delores wasn\u2019t with him, since I\u2019m sure she would\u2019ve been more than happy to oblige. Yeah\u2014the list of asses I\u2019ve had to kiss over the last few months is long. Assembly-line worthy. Kate, Delores, Carol, my father, Alexandra . . .</p><p>I stocked up on lip balm\u2014didn\u2019t want to chafe.</p><p>You\u2019ve missed a lot. I\u2019ll try and fill you in.</p><p>What do you know about rebuilding years? Every great baseball team has them. hell, the Yankees have one every other year.</p> <p>The goal of a rebuilding year isn\u2019t to win the World Series. It\u2019s to develop your strengths, recognize your weaknesses. Make your team solid . . . strong.</p><p>That\u2019s what those weeks were like for Kate and me after she moved the f**k out. It didn\u2019t take her long to find a new apartment.</p><p>One bedroom, furnished, decent part of town. It was small . . . my sister called it quaint. If I was being objective, I\u2019d say it was pretty nice.</p><p>But objectivity\u2019s not exactly my strong suit, so it was a dump.</p><p>I hated it\u2014every square inch.</p> <p>That first Monday when Kate and I returned to work wasn\u2019t pleasant. My father hauled us into his office and sat us both down for The Lecture.</p><p>It\u2019s a punishing technique he developed during my teen years, when he realized smacking me for my transgressions wasn\u2019t as effective as it used to be. The old man\u2019s a talker\u2014Wendy Davis has got nothing on him\u2014and he could go on for hours. There were times when I actually would\u2019ve preferred him to hit me; it would\u2019ve been so much easier.</p><p>The long verbal flogging he employed that particular day with me and Kate involved words like \u201cdisappointed\u201d and \u201cbad judgment,\u201d \u201cimmaturity\u201d and \u201cself-reflection.\u201d</p><p>In the end, he explained there were two great loves in his life\u2014 his family and our firm\u2014and he wouldn\u2019t allow one to cannibalize the other. So, if Kate or I ever let our personal lives affect our professional performance again, one or both of us would be looking for a different place of employment.</p><p>Overall, I thought it was pretty benevolent of him. If I\u2019d been in his shoes, I would\u2019ve fired my ass. Afterward, when we told him he was going to be a grandpa for the third time . . . Well, let\u2019s just say that news went a long way to mending our fences.</p><p>Kate and I saw each other every day, at work and after. There were no sleepovers, but there were dates\u2014dinners, shows, walks in Central Park, marathon telephone conversations that rivaled the yappiest teenaged girl\u2019s. We talked a lot. Guess that was kind of the point.</p> <p>Nothing was off limits. Everything was on the table. We talked about our insecurities\u2014self doubts are like weeds; if you don\u2019t deal with them right away, they multiply. And before you know it, your garden looks like a jungle in Vietnam.</p><p>Kate accused me of using sex as a weapon and a security blanket. And I told her she freezes me out\u2014she shuts down, so I have no way to know what she\u2019s really thinking. Between the two of us, we had enough issues to fill a whole season of Dr.</p><p>Phil.</p><p>Who knew?</p><p>Getting it all out in the open helped. I talked so much about my feelings, it\u2019s a wonder I didn\u2019t sprout tits.</p><p>You know when you\u2019re cleaning your garage? And you have to gut it\u2014dump out boxes of shit, clear the shelves\u2014before you can put it all back together again? It was a lot like that.</p><p>We talked in-depth about what we\u2019d been up to during our hiatus. And let me tell you\u2014those conversations were about as fun as getting a goddamn colonoscopy.</p><p>her tongue-tangle with Warren was dissected in the finest detail.</p> <p>Was I mad?</p><p>Is kerosene f**king flammable?</p><p>I wanted to put my hand through the wall\u2014and his face. I still wanted to draw a line in the sand and tell Kate she was never talking to that son of a bitch again. Never seeing him again.</p><p>Ever.</p><p>But I didn\u2019t. Because, as much as I hate to admit it, Douche Bag was there for her when I . . . wasn\u2019t. he picked her up after I kicked her in the ribs with a steel-tipped boot. So in a weird, screwed up, the-universe-doesn\u2019t-make-any-sense-at-all kind of way, he did me a favor. Plus, the ass**le means a lot to Kate. And even though I want to be everything for her, I can\u2019t bring myself to deny her something\u2014someone\u2014that makes her happy.</p><p>So, in light of my own behavior, I\u2019m willing to give the jerk-off a pass. This time.</p><p>Of course, the next time I see him, all bets are off. If Dickweed gets on my nerves, I\u2019ve got free rein to knock his teeth down his throat. And given his talent for annoyance, it\u2019s pretty much guaranteed.</p><p>Why are you looking at me like that? Don\u2019t tell me you actually like the guy now? Jesus Christ, that Kool-Aid must be pretty tasty\u2014everybody\u2019s drinking it these days.</p><p>Anyway . . . next topic . . . you know I didn\u2019t f**k the stripper.</p><p>But what you don\u2019t know is . . . it wasn\u2019t for lack of trying.</p><p>Before you take my head off, let\u2019s keep in mind that Kate had just ripped my heart out with her bare hands. She said she was leaving me, that we were done.</p><p>And I believed her.</p><p>Which brings me back to my opening statement. That\u2019s right\u2014church. The simple fact is, I owe God. Big time. And not for the reasons you\u2019re probably thinking.</p><p>What do you know about erectile dysfunction? Limp dick syndrome. Failure to launch. It\u2019s a condition every poor bastard with a c**k is going to have to face at some point in his life. It\u2019s horrifying. And like space rocks hitting the earth, it\u2019s bound to happen eventually.</p><p>But for me, it\u2019s only happened once. Want to guess when?</p><p>That\u2019s right\u2014that terrible night. After Kate took off, the stripper did her little show for about fifteen minutes. Then she offered to take things up a notch\u2014for us to get better acquainted on the couch, in the bedroom, from the dining-room chandelier.</p><p>But I knew it wasn\u2019t going to happen. Couldn\u2019t happen.</p><p>Because I was about as hard as a chewed wad of bubblegum.</p><p>Now, maybe I couldn\u2019t get it up because I was devastated about Kate. Maybe it was because I\u2019d consumed enough alcohol to kill a horse. But I prefer to think of it as an act of God.</p><p>A divine intervention to save me from my own stupidity.</p><p>And it worked. Because today, Kate and I are better than ever.</p><p>And I\u2019m pretty positive that wouldn\u2019t be the case if I had actually f**ked another woman. I don\u2019t know if Kate could\u2019ve forgiven me for that. I know I wouldn\u2019t have been able to forgive myself. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>After all that was out of way, we got to the good stuff. The making up. The winning her back. I was always awesome at that part, remember?</p><p>But I don\u2019t like to repeat myself; it\u2019s unimaginative. So this time there was no deluge of flowers. No balloon-filled office. No three-man bands.</p><p>There were, however, affectionate text messages. Small but meaningful gifts. Notes on her apartment door. Every time I thought of her when she wasn\u2019t there, each time I missed the feeling of her lying beside me, I let her know it. Poetry may or may not have been involved.</p><p>And Kate wasn\u2019t idle either. Despite her obvious joy over her independent living situation, she made it known she was lonely without me. She insisted we talk on the phone right before bed.</p> <p>More often than not, she\u2019d end up nodding off while I was still on the other end, and I\u2019d spend longer than I care to admit listening to her breathe.</p><p>Is that pitiful?</p><p>Screw it\u2014I\u2019m way beyond caring.</p><p>Kate also cooked dinner for us at her place three nights a week.</p><p>Then we\u2019d work together at her kitchen table, like two high school honors students cramming for finals.</p> <p>But around week eight, I felt a grand gesture was called for.</p><p>And I made my master move.</p><p>have you ever seen Say Anything? Remember when John Cusack held that boom box over his head? I took a page from his book. But instead of a CD player, I stood on Kate\u2019s sidewalk with a karaoke machine.</p><p>You remember how I feel about karaoke, don\u2019t you? There\u2019re lot of things I do well\u2014singing isn\u2019t one of them. But I sucked it up and belted out every pansy-ass love song I could come up with.</p><p>Matthew and Steven and Jack showed up and sat on the curb and heckled me, but I didn\u2019t give a shit. Because the whole time I was singing, Kate was standing on her balcony, watching me, a small smile on her perfect lips.</p><p>And public humiliation goes a long way.</p> <p>Because halfway through \u201cMirrors\u201d by Justin Timberlake, Kate came downstairs, took me by the hand, and led me inside her apartment. I flipped the guys the bird on the way in. And once we were there, Kate rode me like a warrior princess charging into battle.</p><p>What? You didn\u2019t think we weren\u2019t having sex, did you? Me, go two months without getting laid?</p><p>Why don\u2019t you just pull my brain through my nose with a pair of pliers? I\u2019m sure it would be less painful.</p><p>We\u2019d been having sex. But like I said before, there were no overnighters. Which was kind of like eating a sundae without sprinkles. It\u2019s still good, but there\u2019s definitely something missing.</p><p>That night, however, changed everything. Because when I opened my eyes, it was morning, and Kate was already awake.</p><p>Watching me. She traced my chest with her fingers and kissed me.</p><p>And then she told me she was ready\u2014she wanted us to move in together again.</p><p>That . . . was the second best day of my life.</p> <p>We found a new apartment pretty fast. I\u2019d been looking for a while and had it narrowed down to three choices.</p><p>It was important to Kate that we have a place that was \u201cours\u201d in every sense of the word. For her, it represented a new start to our relationship. A symbol of whatever female empowerment she somehow thought she was lacking before. I\u2019d always thought Kate was strong, independent\u2014I never realized she didn\u2019t think that.</p><p>The building is more than a hundred years old, with original moldings, floor-to-ceiling windows, and two balconies that overlook Central Park. Plus, Bon Jovi lives a few floors below us, which is cool. Kate is a big fan of his.</p><p>So, I think that covers it all. Did I leave anything out?</p><p>I\u2019ve learned my lesson. For good this time. Seriously. If I come home and Kate is screwing some random guy in our bed? I won\u2019t freak out\u2014I won\u2019t say a word.</p><p>I\u2019ll just pick her up, toss her over my shoulder, and carry her to the nearest DNA lab to make sure it\u2019s actually Kate, and not some evil long-lost twin hell-bent on wrecking our lives.</p><p>I\u2019ll never doubt Kate again. Or us, for that matter.</p><p>Still don\u2019t believe me?</p><p>That\u2019s okay. Time will tell. And besides\u2014Kate believes me.</p><p>And that\u2019s all that really f**king matters, isn\u2019t it?</p><p>Now that you\u2019re up to speed, I won\u2019t bore you with anymore recaps. But the story\u2019s not over yet. You can watch the rest of the action\u2014live.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t eat another bite. I think my stomach\u2019s going to rupture.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod, Matthew\u2014another slice! how can you even?\u201d Dolores asks.</p><p>Matthew rubs his protruding belly, like a grandpa on Thanksgiving day. \u201cIt\u2019s a gift.\u201d</p><p>She rolls her eyes.</p><p>The gang\u2019s all here. The guys came over to help me arrange the furniture in the nursery, and the girls tagged along to supervise. Solid cherrywood\u2014that\u2019s some heavy shit. Take my advice: go with imitation wood. It looks just as nice and is a hell of a lot easier to move.</p><p>Shamu stares at Matthew as he picks up his fifth slice of pizza.</p><p>\u201cSeriously, Matthew\u2014you need to stop.\u201d</p><p>Shamu? Oh, that\u2019s Alexandra\u2014new temporary nickname.</p><p>Matthew and I came up with it a few weeks back when she made the unfortunate choice of wearing a one-piece black-and-white maternity bathing suit to the beach.</p><p>Don\u2019t tell Steven, though. he\u2019s got zero sense of humor when it comes to us ragging on my sister these days.</p><p>With his mouth full, Matthew tells her, \u201cDon\u2019t be jealous, Sham\u2014just because you\u2019re too puffed up to enjoy this fine delicacy.\u201d</p><p>Uh-oh. Did you catch his slipup?</p><p>Alexandra sure did.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you call me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSham. You called me Sham. What the hell does Sham mean, Matthew?\u201d</p><p>I\u2019ve never seen someone lined up before a firing squad, but now I know just what they\u2019d look like. Matthew chokes down his bite like he\u2019s swallowing a brick. And his wide eyes turn to me for help.</p><p>You\u2019re on your own, man. I\u2019ve got a kid on the way. It\u2019d be nice to have four functioning limbs when he\u2019s born.</p><p>\u201cI . . . ah . . . I\u2019m coming down with Tourette\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>Delores looks confused. Alexandra\u2019s eyes narrow.</p><p>\u201cAsslickingturdballmotherfuckerbitch. See?\u201d</p><p>Shamu turns away. \u201cWhatever.\u201d</p><p>huh. That was disappointing. The pregnancy must be wearing her out. And speaking of pregnancy\u2014Kate waddles into the room.</p><p>her hair is long and shiny. It sways left to right as she moves.</p><p>her brow\u2019s wrinkled tiredly, and one hand rests on her lower back to help support the immensity that is her front. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I can\u2019t take my eyes off her. She\u2019s adorably round. Like one of those Weeble Wobbles I played with as a kid. She plops down on the couch next to me and puts her swollen Fred Flintstone\u2013like feet on the coffee table.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so huge.\u201d</p><p>I smile and put my hand on her firm mound, rubbing it like a bald head for good luck. Knowing there\u2019s a real live baby in there, seeing him or her move beneath Kate\u2019s skin, is pretty frigging amazing.</p><p>When there\u2019s a Yankee game on, I talk to it\u2014give him a playby-play, like a seeing-eye sportscaster. And at night, when Kate is asleep, I balance the TV remote on her stomach just to watch the baby kick it off from the inside. Cool, right? In a weird Aliens kind of way, but still cool.</p> <p>\u201cYou really are huge,\u201d I say. \u201cI think you\u2019ve doubled in size since breakfast.\u201d</p><p>The whole room goes eerily silent.</p><p>And Kate stares at my hand a second too long. \u201cExcuse me . . .</p><p>I have to . . . go . . .\u201d She stands up and shuffles as quickly as she can down the hall.</p><p>Probably going to piss\u2014she does that a lot lately.</p> <p>Then Delores slaps me.</p><p>Smack.</p><p>In the f**king ear. \u201cOw!\u201d I rub my stinging lobe.</p><p>Shamu lets out an exasperated sigh. \u201cCould you give him one from me, Delores? I don\u2019t think I can get up.\u201d</p><p>Smack.</p><p>\u201cJesus! What the f**k?\u201d</p> <p>Alexandra\u2019s all over me. \u201cWhat are you thinking? You don\u2019t tell a woman who\u2019s three days from her due date that she\u2019s huge!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t. She said it. I just agreed with her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDelores.\u201d</p><p>Smack.</p><p>\u201cChrist Almighty!\u201d</p><p>If the ear-ringing is any indication, there\u2019s an excellent chance I\u2019ve just gone deaf.</p><p>\u201cKate knows I didn\u2019t mean it like that.\u201d</p><p>Delores crosses her arms smugly. \u201cSure she does, Dipshit.</p> <p>That\u2019s why she\u2019s in the bathroom crying her eyes out right now.\u201d</p><p>I swallow hard and look down the hall. It\u2019s possible that Delores is just screwing with me. It\u2019s her favorite pastime these days, making me feel guilty for all the shit that Kate has already forgiven me for. Delores Warren is the Mickey Mantle of grudge holding.</p><p>Alexandra pulls herself from the couch. \u201cAnd on that note\u2014 roll me home, Steven. As fun as it is to watch my little brother grovel, I\u2019m too tired to really enjoy it at the moment.\u201d</p><p>Delores and Matthew get up to go too, so the four of them can share a cab. Though I really don\u2019t know how that\u2019s going to work\u2014 Alexandra\u2019s gonna need the entire backseat for herself.</p><p>I\u2019ll keep that little observation to myself, however.</p><p>Besides, I have more important matters to deal with. Like finding my girlfriend.</p><p>I knock softly at the bathroom door. \u201cKate?\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s shuffling behind the door. \u201cI\u2019ll be right out.\u201d</p><p>Shit. her voice is stuffy. Wet. Delores wasn\u2019t screwing with me.</p><p>I reach up and grab the key from its spot on top of the molding. I unlock the door and open it slowly, and there she is. Standing in front of the mirror, with tear tracks staining her cheeks.</p><p>Kate turns to look at me and hiccups. her tone is pitiful. Sad.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to be fat.\u201d</p><p>She covers her face with her hands and sobs into them.</p><p>I try to hold in the laugh. Really. But she looks so cute and miserable, I don\u2019t quite pull it off. I wrap my arms around her from behind. \u201cYou\u2019re not fat, Kate.\u201d</p><p>her voice is muffled by her hands. \u201cYes, I am. I couldn\u2019t put my shoes on yesterday. Dee Dee had to help me because I couldn\u2019t reach.\u201d</p><p>This time I can\u2019t help laughing out loud. I rest my chin on her shoulder and pull her hands down from her face. Our eyes meet in the mirror. \u201cYou\u2019re pregnant\u2014not fat.\u201d I think for a moment and then add matter-of-factly, \u201cAlexandra\u2019s fat.\u201d</p><p>her damp eyes squint. \u201cShe\u2019s pregnant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot in her thighs.\u201d</p><p>Kate shakes her head. \u201cYou\u2019re so mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not trying to be. I\u2019m just trying to point out the fact that you\u2019re gorgeous.\u201d I rub my hands up and down her narrow hips.</p><p>\u201cSexy as hell.\u201d</p><p>And I\u2019m not bullshitting her. The midsection might be at maximum capacity, but her legs are slim. Toned. And she\u2019s still sporting the sweetest, tightest ass this side of the hudson River.</p><p>Sure, she\u2019s hormonal and irrational half the time\u2014but the other half of the time, she\u2019s horny. hornier then I\u2019ve ever seen her.</p><p>Plus\u2014there\u2019s the boobs. Can\u2019t forget them. They\u2019re almost as big as her head. So much fun.</p><p>Not that there\u2019s anything wrong with Kate\u2019s everyday br**sts\u2014 but pregnancy tits are like India. You don\u2019t have to stay forever, but it sure is exciting to visit.</p><p>Kate doubts my sincerity. \u201cSexy? Please. Don\u2019t blow smoke up my ass, Drew.\u201d</p><p>I smirk. \u201cTrust me sweetheart\u2014if I\u2019m thinking about slipping something up your ass? It\u2019s not gonna be smoke.\u201d</p><p>She turns in my arms, unconvinced. \u201chow could you ever think this\u201d\u2014she points to her body\u2014\u201cis sexy?\u201d</p><p>I hesitate. And rub the back of my neck. \u201cIt might make you mad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRisk it.\u201d</p><p>I shrug. \u201cWell . . . I did this to you.\u201d A fact I\u2019m sure she won\u2019t let me forget, once we\u2019re in the delivery room. \u201cI made you like this\u2014left my mark. That\u2019s my kid you\u2019re incubating. It\u2019s like a big neon sign that says PROPERTY OF DREW EVANS. Call me a caveman, but that\u2019s a major frigging turn on for me.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s quiet for a minute, then looks down at our joined hands.</p><p>\u201cWhat if I can\u2019t lose the weight after the baby\u2019s born?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut what if I don\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>I shrug again. \u201cThen I\u2019ll become a chubby chaser. A little extra cushion for the pushin\u2019 isn\u2019t a bad thing.\u201d</p><p>She rolls her eyes, but then she laughs. I cup her face with both hands and bring her lips to mine. The kiss starts off sweet and tender.</p><p>And then it\u2019s . . . not.</p><p>her teeth nip at my lips. hard and urgent. Begging for more.</p><p>And my legs tremble with the need to please her.</p><p>It still amazes me\u2014the power she has. This tiny woman can bring me to my knees with a look . . . a sigh. But I wouldn\u2019t have it any other way. I\u2019ve been to the other side. I\u2019ve seen what freedom has to offer. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Misery.</p><p>Bring on the f**king chains; I\u2019ll take slavery any day.</p><p>Kate pulls back, eyes closed.

What do you need?\u201d</p> <p>her eyes open. \u201cDo you want me, Drew?\u201d</p><p>I suck on her bottom lip. And hiss, \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShow me. Make me feel it.

Like a water balloon that\u2019s been filled too much.</p><p>I\u2019ve had to make conscious effort to take it easy with her in the sex department. Slow and gentle, despite some fantastically creative positions. But now, the things she\u2019s saying\u2014her voice\u2014 Christ, it\u2019s all I can do not to bend her over the sink and f**k her till we both go blind.</p><p>\u201cI want it hard . . . please, Drew . . . like we used to . . .\u201d</p><p>Jesus, this is what a deranged gorilla must feel like, right after he\u2019s escaped the zoo.</p><p>\u201cJust . . . don\u2019t look at me, if . . .\u201d</p><p>Like a piece of dried tinder, I snap. I grab her arms tighter than I should and spin her around. My hand tangles in her hair, yanking her head back so I can assault her neck. And my raging hard-on grinds against her ass. Kate moans. My other hand slides up her stomach, gripping her br**sts roughly. They overflow in my palm. And our mouths fuse together, tongues plunging, wrestling.</p> <p>I hook an arm under her knees and sweep her up, heading straight for the bedroom.</p><p>Kate pushes against my chest. \u201cWait, Drew\u2014I\u2019m too heavy.</p><p>You\u2019ll hurt yourself.\u201d</p><p>If I wasn\u2019t so aroused, I\u2019d be pretty freaking insulted. I cut her off with another deep kiss. Then I lay her out on the bed.</p><p>I take my time opening the buttons on the front of her dress, one by one. Not to tease her\u2014but to show her. \u201c\u2018Don\u2019t look at me,\u2019 my ass! Looking at you is the best f**king part.\u201d</p><p>Okay, it\u2019s not the best part. But it\u2019s a really good part.</p><p>She wiggles impatiently and I unhook her bra. She slides it off her arms. I take a moment to admire my handiwork, caressing every inch of her bare body with my eyes. Stunning.</p><p>Then I bury my face between her tits, laving and sucking, giving each bountiful mound its due.</p> <p>Kate arches her back and pulls at my hair. Writhing. I rip my shirt over my head.</p><p>her arms wrap around my back\u2014kneading\u2014pulling me closer. I moan and nibble a trail up her throat to plant another long kiss on her mouth. I don\u2019t want her thinking about the baby right now, but I can\u2019t pass by the hump without paying it homage.</p><p>My lips press against it once, reverently.</p><p>Then I stand up. I tear at my belt and slide my pants and boxers to the floor. Kate is breathing fast. her lips are parted and swollen. And her eyes are on fire\u2014on me.</p><p>I grab her ankles and drag her to the edge of the bed, wrapping her legs around my hips.</p><p>I slide my c**k up and down between her lips, coating the head with her wetness.</p><p>Then I stop and our eyes lock. I know she wants a bumpy ride, and I aim to please, but first: \u201cIf I hurt you\u2014if you\u2019re uncomfortable at all\u2014you have to tell me.\u201d</p><p>She nods quickly. And it\u2019s the only reassurance I need before I slam into her. Fuck. We moan together, long and low. My head rolls back and I thrust again.</p><p>She\u2019s tighter now. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s the baby pressing everything together or just the fact that God is good, but her cunt grips me like a Venus f**king flytrap savoring its last meal. My hips pound against hers, crashing and rubbing, as rough as I dare.</p><p>It feels primitive. Raw. And so exquisitely intense, it could be illegal. her massive br**sts bounce with each push. She\u2019s gasping and groaning, loving every second of it. Kate reaches for my hips, but they\u2019re too far out of range. She grips the bed sheets instead and mangles them.</p><p>Keeping the pace swift and steady, I slide my hand between us and rub her clit, just the way she likes. Then I move higher, pinching those gorgeous dark ni**les. Kate\u2019s tits have always been a hot spot, but lately they\u2019ve been extra sensitive.</p><p>her mouth opens, but only small whimpers come out. And that\u2019s just unacceptable.</p><p>\u201cCome on, baby, you can do better than that.\u201d</p><p>I give each pointy peak a good, long tug. And she screams, \u201cDrew . . . Drew . . . yes . . .\u201d</p><p>So much f**king better.</p><p>I move my hands to her knees and hold on for leverage. Pulling her toward me as I push forward. Skin slapping skin. \u201cGod . . . Kate . . .\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m not going to be able to hold out much longer. At this rate I really didn\u2019t expect to. My chin drops to my chest and I reach down and grab her ass. Lifting her up\u2014plunging deeper. Moving faster.</p><p>Kate\u2019s legs tighten on me and I know she\u2019s close too. And she\u2019s moaning . . . chanting . . . it\u2019s a beautiful thing. And then she goes rigid under me. Clenching around me. Taking me down with her.</p><p>I grip her waist, holding her close as we come together.</p><p>Later, when our breaths finally return to normal, I collapse on the bed next to her. \u201cGod damn. That never gets old.\u201d</p><p>She laughs. \u201cYeah. I needed that.\u201d</p><p>Then she bites her bottom lip and looks at me sideways. Bashfully.</p><p>\u201cWant to do it again?\u201d</p><p>Like she really needs to ask.</p><p>A few hours later, I wake up from my sex-induced coma to the sound of Kate\u2019s voice.</p><p>\u201cUgh . . . goddamn pizza. Damn whoever invented it.\u201d</p><p>I rub the sleep from my eyes and glance out the window. It\u2019s still dark outside, just a couple hours after midnight. Kate is pacing across the room, rubbing her belly. Breathing hard.</p><p>\u201cKate? What\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>She stops in her tracks and looks my way. \u201cNothing. Go back to sleep.\u201d She moans softly. \u201cJust indigestion.\u201d</p><p>Just indigestion?</p><p>Famous last words.</p><p>And the next thing you know, Uncle Morty\u2019s lying on a slab in the morgue from the massive heart attack he never knew he was having. Not on my watch, buddy.</p><p>In a flash, I\u2019m out of bed\u2014sweatpants on. I stand next to Kate, my hand on her shoulder.</p><p>\u201cShould we call the doctor?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? No . . . no, I\u2019m sure it\u2019s just . . . ugh . . .\u201d She bends over, holding her midsection. \u201cOh . . . ow . . .\u201d</p><p>And a gush of water bursts from between her legs. Like ten gallons\u2019 worth.</p><p>The two of us just stand there. Stupidly. Watching as droplets fall from the edge of her nightgown onto the rug.

During the final game we were down by one, with three seconds left on the clock. Guess who they passed the ball to? Who sank the winning three-pointer?</p> <p>Yep\u2014that would be me. Because even back then, I was a rock.</p><p>Steady on the draw. I don\u2019t get stressed. Fear? Panic? They\u2019re for losers.</p><p>And I\u2019m no loser.</p><p>So why are my hands shaking like an un-medicated Parkinson\u2019s patient?</p><p>Anyone ever tell you, you ask too many frigging questions?</p><p>My knuckles are white, wrapped in a death grip around the steering wheel.</p> <p>Kate is in the passenger seat\u2014with a towel under her ass\u2014 implementing every breathing technique those wacked-out, hippie Lamaze instructors told us about.</p><p>Hee hee.</p><p>Whoo whoo.</p><p>Hee hee.</p><p>Whoo.</p><p>Then, mid-whoo, she screams. \u201cOh, no!\u201d</p><p>I almost slam the car into a goddamn telephone pole. \u201cWhat! What\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI forgot the sour apple lollipops!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe what?\u201d</p><p>her voice is heavy with disappointment. \u201cThe sour apple lollipops. Alexandra said they were the only thing that quenched her thirst when she was in labor with Mackenzie. I was going to pick some up this afternoon, but I forgot. Can we stop and get some?\u201d</p><p>Okay. It seems that Kate\u2019s common sense has gone bye-bye\u2014 so it\u2019s up to me to be the voice of reason. Which is pretty frigging frightening, considering I\u2019m hanging on by a thread over here.</p><p>\u201cNo, we can\u2019t f**king stop and get some! Are you out of your mind?\u201d</p><p>Kate\u2019s big brown eyes immediately fill with tears. And I feel like the world\u2019s biggest dick.</p><p>\u201cPlease, Drew? I just want everything to be perfect . . . and what if I want a lollipop during the delivery, and you go to get me one, and then I have the baby while you\u2019re gone? You\u2019ll miss it.\u201d</p><p>Tears course down her cheeks like two little tributaries. \u201cI couldn\u2019t bear it if you missed it.\u201d</p><p>Please don\u2019t let it be a girl. For God\u2019s sake, please don\u2019t let it be a girl. All this time, I\u2019ve been praying for a healthy baby without specifying a sex.</p><p>Until now.</p><p>Because if I have a daughter, and her tears cut me off at the knees like Kate\u2019s do? I\u2019m totally f**king screwed.</p><p>\u201cOkay, Kate. It\u2019s all right, baby. Don\u2019t cry\u2014I\u2019ll stop.\u201d</p><p>She sniffles. And smiles. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>I jerk the wheel to the right, make an illegal U-turn, and pull onto the curb in front of a 7-Eleven. Then, faster than a pit stop at the Indy 500, I\u2019m back on the road, with the coveted sour apple lollipops rolling around in the backseat.</p><p>And Kate is back to her breathing.</p><p>Hee hee.</p><p>Whoo whoo.</p><p>Hee hee.</p><p>Until she\u2019s not.</p><p>\u201cDo you think the nurses will know we had sex?\u201d</p><p>I look pointedly at her stomach. \u201cUnless you plan on claiming an immaculate conception, I think they\u2019ll have a pretty good idea.\u201d</p><p>Then I lean on the horn. \u201cThe gas is the one on the right, grandma!\u201d I swear to Christ, if your gray poufy hair is the only thing that can see over the dashboard? You\u2019ve got no business driving.</p><p>Hee hee.</p><p>Whoo whoo.</p><p>\u201cNo\u2014do you think they\u2019ll know we had sex tonight?\u201d</p><p>Kate is funny about things like this. Shy. Even with me sometimes. The other day, I happened to catch a passing glimpse of her sitting on the toilet and it was like the end of the world. Personally, I think it\u2019s ridiculous. But I\u2019m not about to argue the point with her now.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a maternity ward, Kate, not CSI. They\u2019re not gonna to be down there with a black light looking for my swimmers.\u201d</p><p>Hee Hee.</p><p>Hee Hee.</p><p>\u201cYeah, you\u2019re right. They won\u2019t be able to tell.\u201d She seems calmed by the idea. Reassured.</p><p>Whooooo.</p><p>And I\u2019m happy for her. Now if I can just keep myself from going into cardiac arrest, we\u2019ll be in pretty good shape.</p><p>An hour later, Kate is settled into a private room at New York Pres-byterian, hooked up to more beeping contraptions then a ninetyyear-old on life support. I sit down in the chair next to the bed.</p><p>\u201cCan I get you anything? Back rub? Ice chips? Narcotics?\u201d</p><p>I know I could go for a glass of whiskey at the moment. Or a whole bottle.</p><p>Kate takes my hand and holds it tight, like we\u2019re on a plane that\u2019s about to take off. \u201cNo. Just\u2014talk to me.\u201d Then her voice turns hushed. Small. \u201cI\u2019m scared, Drew.\u201d</p><p>My chest tightens painfully. And I\u2019ve never felt so helpless in my life.</p><p>But I do my damnedest to hide it. \u201chey, this whole delivery thing is a piece of cake. I mean, women have babies all the time.</p><p>I read this article once that said in the olden days, they\u2019d pop a kid out right in the middle of the fields. Then they\u2019d clean it off, put it in their backpack, and go right back to work. how hard can it be?\u201d</p><p>She snorts. \u201cEasy for you to say. Your part was fun. And over.</p><p>Females got royally screwed in this deal.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s not wrong. But women are stronger than men. No, really, I\u2019m being serious. Sure, we can outdo them in upper-body strength, but in every other way\u2014psychologically, emotionally, cardiovascu-larly, genetically\u2014women come out on top.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because God is wise. he knew if we had to go through this shit, the human race would\u2019ve died the f**k out with Adam.\u201d</p><p>She chuckles.</p><p>Then a voice comes from the doorway. \u201chow are we doing this evening?\u201d</p><p>\u201chi, Bobbie.\u201d</p><p>\u201chey, Roberta.\u201d</p><p>Yes\u2014I only use her full name. Post-traumatic stress? Possibly.</p><p>All I know is that hearing the name Bob? Pretty much makes me want to slit my wrists open with a box cutter.</p><p>Roberta checks the chart at the end of the bed. \u201cEverything looks good. You\u2019re about three centimeters dilated, Kate, so we\u2019ve still got a while to go. Do you have any questions for me?\u201d</p><p>Kate looks hopeful. \u201cEpidural?\u201d</p><p>here\u2019s some advice\u2014don\u2019t be a masochist. Get the epidural.</p><p>I\u2019ll repeat that in case you missed it: GET ThE EPIDURAL.</p><p>According to my sister, it\u2019s a miracle drug. She\u2019d gladly jerk off the guy who invented it\u2014and Steven would probably let her. Would you get a tooth pulled without novocaine? Would you get your appendix removed without anesthesia? Of course not. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>And don\u2019t give me that bullshit about having the \u201cfull experience\u201d of childbirth.

Thanks, Roberta.\u201d</p> <p>Once she\u2019s out the door, I stand up and grab my cell phone.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to go call your mom\u2014I can\u2019t get any reception in here.

Then I lean down and kiss the hump, telling it, \u201cDon\u2019t start without me.\u201d</p><p>Then I\u2019m out the door\u2014jogging to catch up with Kate\u2019s doctor down the hall. \u201chey, Roberta!\u201d</p> <p>She stops and turns. \u201chi, Drew. how are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m good\u2014good. I wanted to ask you about the baby\u2019s heart rate. Isn\u2019t one-fifty a little high?\u201d</p><p>Roberta\u2019s voice is tolerant, understanding. She\u2019s used to this by now.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s well within the normal range. It\u2019s common to see some minor fluctuations in the fetal heart rate during labor.\u201d</p><p>I nod. And go on. \u201cAnd Kate\u2019s blood pressure? Any sign of preeclampsia?\u201d</p><p>Knowledge is power. The more you know, the more control you have over a situation. At least that\u2019s what I\u2019ve been telling myself for the last eight months.</p> <p>\u201cNo, like I told you on the phone yesterday\u2014and the day before that\u2014Kate\u2019s blood pressure is perfect. It\u2019s been steady the entire pregnancy.\u201d</p><p>I rub my chin and nod. \u201chave you ever actually delivered a baby with shoulder dystocia? Because you realize you won\u2019t know it\u2019s happening until the baby\u2019s head is already\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDrew. I thought we agreed you were going to stop watching ER reruns?\u201d</p><p>ER should come with a warning label. It\u2019s disturbing. If you\u2019re a mild hypochondriac or a parent to be, expect to lose a shitload of sleep after just one episode.</p><p>\u201cI know, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>Roberta puts her hand up. \u201cLook, I know how you feel\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you?\u201d I ask sharply. \u201chave you ever taken your whole life and put it in someone else\u2019s hands and asked them to take care of it for you? To bring it back to you in one piece? \u2019Cause that\u2019s what I\u2019m doing here.\u201d I push a hand through my hair and look away.</p><p>And when I speak again, my voice is shaky. \u201cKate and this baby . . .</p> <p>if anything ever . . .\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t even finish the thought, let alone the sentence.</p><p>She puts her hand on my shoulder. \u201cDrew, you have to trust me. I know it\u2019s difficult, but try and focus on the positives. Kate is young and healthy\u2014we have every reason to believe that this delivery will progress without any complications at all.\u201d</p><p>I nod my head. And the logical part of my brain knows she\u2019s right.</p><p>\u201cGo back to Kate. Try and enjoy the time you have left. After tonight, it\u2019s not going to be just the two of you anymore\u2014not for a long time.\u201d</p><p>I force myself to nod again. \u201cOkay. Thanks.\u201d</p><p>I turn and walk back toward the room. I stop in the doorway.</p><p>Can you see her?</p><p>Surrounded by pillows\u2014buried under the puffy down comforter she insisted on bringing from home. She looks so tiny. Almost like a little girl hiding in her parents\u2019 bed during a thunderstorm.</p><p>And I need to say the words\u2014to make sure she knows.</p><p>\u201cI love you, Kate. Everything that\u2019s good in my life, anything that really matters, is only there because of you. If we hadn\u2019t met? I\u2019d be f**king miserable\u2014and probably too clueless to even realize it.\u201d</p><p>She looks at me, totally straight faced. \u201cI\u2019m having a baby, Drew\u2014I\u2019m not dying.\u201d Then her eyes widen. \u201cJesus Christ, I\u2019m not dying, am I?\u201d</p><p>And that\u2019s all it takes to snap me out of my panic.</p><p>\u201cNo, Kate. You\u2019re not dying.\u201d</p><p>She nods. \u201cOkay, then. And just for the record, I love you too.</p><p>I love that you\u2019re funding Mackenzie\u2019s future because you won\u2019t stop cursing. I love how you tease your sister unmercifully but would kill anyone who hurt her. But most of all . . . I love how you love me. I feel it every moment . . . every day.\u201d</p><p>I walk up to her and cup her cheek. Then I lean over and softly kiss her lips.</p><p>She takes my hand and gives it a squeeze. And then her jaw tightens with determination.</p><p>\u201cNow, let\u2019s do this thing.\u201d</p><p>Turns out all the worrying was for nothing. Because at 9:57 this morning, Kate gave birth to a bouncing baby boy. And I was right next to her the whole time. Sharing her pain.</p><p>Literally.</p><p>I\u2019m pretty sure she broke my hand.</p><p>But who cares? A few broken bones don\u2019t mean much\u2014not when you\u2019re holding a seven-pound, nine-ounce miracle.</p><p>And that\u2019s just what I\u2019m doing.</p><p>I know every parent thinks their child is adorable\u2014but be honest\u2014he\u2019s one good-looking kid, don\u2019t you think? A patch of black hair lays smoothly on top of his head. his hands, his nose, his lips\u2014looking at them is like looking in a mirror. But his eyes, they\u2019re all Kate.</p><p>he\u2019s exquisite. Perfection made flesh.</p><p>Granted, he didn\u2019t come out looking like this. A few hours ago, he bore a strong resemblance to a screaming featherless chicken.</p><p>But he was my screaming featherless chicken, so he was still the most beautiful f**king thing I\u2019ve ever seen.</p><p>It\u2019s unreal. The adoration. The worship that\u2019s so overwhelming, it almost hurts to look at him. I mean, I love Kate\u2014more than my own life. But that took time. I gradually fell in love with her.</p><p>This . . . was instantaneous. As soon as I laid eyes on him, I knew I\u2019d gladly jump bare-assed into a pool of battery acid for him.</p><p>Insane, right? And I can\u2019t wait to teach him things. Show him . . .everything. Like how to change a tire, and sweet talk a girl, how to hit a baseball, and throw a right hook. Not necessarily in that order.</p><p>I used to make fun of those guys at the park. The dads with their strollers and goofy smiles and man purses.</p><p>But now . . . now I get it.</p><p>Kate\u2019s voice pulls me from my baby gazing. \u201chey.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She sounds worn out. I don\u2019t blame her.</p><p>\u201chow are you feeling?\u201d</p><p>She smiles sleepily. \u201cWell . . . imagine peeing out a watermelon. \u201d</p><p>I flinch. \u201cOuch.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>her eyes fall to the pale-blue-blanketed bundle in my arms.</p><p>\u201chow\u2019s the little guy?\u201d</p><p>\u201che\u2019s good. We\u2019re just hanging out. Shooting the shit. I\u2019m telling him about all the important things in life, like chicks and cars and . . . chicks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that so?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>I look down at our son. And my voice is awed. \u201cYou did such a great job, Kate. he has your eyes. I love your eyes\u2014did I ever tell you that? They were the first thing I noticed about you.\u201d</p><p>She cocks one brow. \u201cI thought my ass was the first thing you noticed?\u201d</p><p>I laugh, remembering. \u201cOh yeah, that\u2019s right. But then you turned around and just . . . blew me away.\u201d</p><p>The baby lets out a sharp squawk, capturing our attention.</p><p>\u201cI think he\u2019s hungry.\u201d</p> <p>Kate nods and I pass him over. She undoes the clasp of her pajama top, exposing one ripe, juicy breast. She brings the baby close and he latches onto her nipple\u2014like an expert.</p><p>Did you expect anything less? This is my son, after all.</p><p>I watch them for a moment. Then I have to reach down to adjust the tent pole that\u2019s sprung up in my pants.</p><p>Sick. Yeah\u2014I know.</p><p>Kate throws me a smirk and glances toward my crotch. \u201cGot a problem down there, Mr. Evans?\u201d</p><p>I shrug. \u201cNope. No problem. Just looking forward to my turn.\u201d</p><p>See\u2014there\u2019re two kinds of women in this world: The ones who figure if they can\u2019t get any below-the-waist action for six weeks after giving birth, neither can their guy. Then there\u2019s the second group.</p><p>The ones who look forward to those hand jobs, blow jobs, and then some\u2014because they know the favor will be returned when the ban is lifted.</p> <p>Kate definitely falls into the second group. I know this, and apparently so does my cock.</p><p>\u201cAfter the massacre you witnessed in the delivery room? I didn\u2019t think you\u2019d ever want to have sex with me again.\u201d</p><p>My mouth falls open. In shock.</p><p>\u201cAre you frigging kidding me? I mean, I thought your cunt was magnificent before, but now that I\u2019ve see what it\u2019s really capable of?</p><p>It\u2019s reached superhero status in my book. In fact, I think that\u2019s what we should name it.\u201d I lift my hands, envisioning a giant billboard.</p><p>\u201cIncred-a-Pussy.\u201d</p><p>She shakes her head. And smiles down at the baby. \u201cSpeaking of naming things . . . we should probably come up with one for him, don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p><p>Kate and I decided to wait on the name game until after the baby was born\u2014to make sure it was a good fit. Names are crucial. They\u2019re the first impression the world has of you. That\u2019s why I\u2019ll never understand why people curse their kids with labels like Edmund, or Albert, or Morning Dew.</p><p>Why don\u2019t you just cut to the chase and call the kid Shit head?</p><p>I lean back in the chair. \u201cOkay\u2014you can start first.\u201d her eyes roam the baby\u2019s face. \u201cConnor.\u201d</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cConnor\u2019s not a first name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course it is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo\u2014it\u2019s a last name.\u201d In my best Terminator voice I say, \u201cSarah Connor.\u201d</p><p>Kate rolls her eyes. Then she says, \u201cI\u2019ve always liked the name Dalton.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not even going to dignify that with a response.\u201d</p><p>\u201cO-kay. Colin.\u201d</p><p>I scoff, \u201cNo way. Sounds too much like \u2018colon.\u2019 They\u2019ll be calling him Asshole the minute he steps foot on the playground.\u201d</p><p>Kate looks at me incredulously. \u201cAre you sure you went to Catholic School? It sounds like you grew up in juvie hall.\u201d</p><p>Life is one big school playground. Remember that.</p><p>Wolf-pack mentality. You need to learn early how not to be the weakest link. They\u2019re the ones who get eaten. Alive.</p><p>\u201cSince you don\u2019t approve of my choices, what do you suggest?\u201d she asks.</p><p>I look at the sleeping face of our son. his perfect little lips, his long dark lashes.</p><p>\u201cMichael.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-uh. In third grade, Michael Rollins threw up all over my penny loafers. Whenever I hear that name I think of regurgitated hot dogs.\u201d</p><p>Fair enough. I try again. \u201cJames. Not Jim or Jimmy\u2014and sure as shit not Jamie. Just James.\u201d</p><p>Kate raises her eyebrows. And tests it out. \u201cJames. James\u2014I like it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>She looks down at the baby again. \u201cYes. James it is.\u201d</p><p>I reach into my back pocket and pull out a folded piece of paper. \u201cFantastic. Now for his last name.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s confused. \u201chis last name?\u201d</p><p>We\u2019ve talked about using Brooks as the middle name. But let\u2019s be honest\u2014the only people who use a middle name are serial killers and pissed-off parents. So I came up with something much better.</p><p>I put the opened paper on Kate\u2019s lap.</p><p>Take a look.</p><p>BROOKS-EVANS</p><p>She looks up, eyes wide with surprise. \u201cYou want to hyphenate his name?\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m an old-fashioned kind of guy. I think women should take their husband\u2019s last names. Sure, it comes from the idea that a woman is property. And no, I don\u2019t agree with that. In the future, if some punk comes along and implies that he owns my niece\u2014I\u2019m gonna buy him a shovel.</p><p>So he can dig his own grave before I put him in it.</p><p>But technically speaking, Kate is the last of the Brooks. Namesakes don\u2019t mean as much anymore, but I have a feeling it means a lot to her.</p><p>\u201cWell . . . he\u2019s ours. And you did do most of the work. You should get half the credit.\u201d her eyes soften as she reminds me, \u201cYou hate to share, Drew.\u201d</p><p>I push some wayward hair behind her ear. \u201cFor you, I\u2019m willing to make an exception.\u201d</p><p>Plus, I\u2019m banking on the fact that one day soon, Kate\u2019s last name will match our son\u2019s.</p><p>Of course, Kate deserves the best proposal ever\u2014and the best takes time.</p><p>Planning.</p><p>It\u2019s in the works right now. I\u2019m taking ballooning lessons on Saturday afternoons, when she thinks I\u2019m playing ball with the guys. Because I\u2019m going to take Kate on a private hot-air balloon ride to the hudson Valley. There\u2019ll be an elegant picnic ready for us when we land. And that\u2019s where I\u2019ll pop the question That way\u2014on the outside chance Kate actually turns me down\u2014I\u2019ll have her in a totally secluded area until I can change her mind. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Genius, right?</p><p>I\u2019ll have a limo waiting nearby\u2014but not too near\u2014to drive us back home, so we can sit back and relax on the way. And have limo-sex, of course. You should never pass up the opportunity to have sex in a limo\u2014it\u2019s always fun.</p><p>Kate\u2019s eyes are shiny with tears. happy ones. \u201cI love it. James Brooks-Evans. It\u2019s perfect. Thank you.\u201d</p><p>I lean forward and kiss our son\u2019s forehead. And then I kiss his mother\u2019s lips. \u201cYou\u2019ve got it all wrong, baby. I\u2019m supposed to be thanking you.\u201d</p> <p>She looks down at James tenderly. And in that voice that could make an angel green with envy, she starts to sing.</p><p>There\u2019s a song that they sing when they take to the highway</p><p>A song that they sing when they take to the sea</p><p>A song that they sing of their home in the sky</p><p>Maybe you can believe it if it helps you to sleep</p> <p>But singing works just fine for me</p><p>So good night you moonlight ladies</p><p>Rock-a-bye sweet baby James</p><p>Deep greens and blues are the colors I choose</p><p>Won1t you let me go down in my dreams</p><p>And rock-a-bye sweet baby James</p> <p>There\u2019s only a few times in a guy\u2019s life that he\u2019s allowed to cry without looking like a total chump.</p><p>This is one of those times.</p><p>When Kate is finished, I clear my throat. And rub the wetness from my eyes. Then I climb onto the bed beside her.</p><p>I\u2019m pretty sure it\u2019s against hospital policy, and I admit, some of those male nurses look pretty f**king intimidating.</p><p>But come on\u2014they\u2019re nurses.</p><p>Kate turns toward me, so James lies between us. My arm lays over him, my hand on her hip, encircling them both.</p><p>Kate\u2019s eyes are velvety warm. \u201cDrew?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDo you think we\u2019ll always be like this?\u201d</p><p>I give her a small smile. \u201cDefinitely not.\u201d</p><p>And then I touch her face\u2014the one I plan on looking at every morning and every night, until death shows up to drag me away.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re just gonna keep getting better.\u201d</p><p>So there you have it.</p><p>how\u2019s that for a happy frigging ending, huh? Or beginning . . .</p><p>I guess . . . depending on how you look at it.</p><p>Anyway, now\u2019s about the time I start spouting off some pearls of wisdom.</p><p>Advice.</p><p>But given the events of the last year, it\u2019s become increasingly obvious that I don\u2019t know what the f**k I\u2019m talking about. I don\u2019t think you should listen to anything I\u2019ve said.</p><p>You still want me to give it a shot?</p><p>Okay. But don\u2019t say I didn\u2019t warn you.</p><p>here goes:</p><p>Number One\u2014people don\u2019t change. There\u2019s no magic bullet.</p><p>No bibbidi-fucking-boo.</p><p>What you see is what you get. Sure, certain habits can be tweaked. Reined in. Like my propensity for making snap judgments. The very idea of assuming I know everything\u2014without checking with Kate first\u2014now makes me sick to my stomach.</p><p>But other characteristics, they stick.</p><p>My possessiveness, Kate\u2019s stubbornness, our collective competitiveness\u2014they\u2019re too much a part of who we are to be totally eradicated.</p><p>It\u2019s kind of like . . . cellulite. You ladies can spend all day at the spa wrapped in mud and seaweed. You can throw a fortune away on those ridiculous creams and scrubs. But at the end of the day, that puckered, dimply skin is still gonna be there.</p><p>Sorry to be the one to break it to you; it\u2019s just the way it is.</p><p>But if you love someone, really love them, you take them as is. You don\u2019t try to change them.</p><p>You want the whole package\u2014cottage cheese ass and all.</p><p>Number Two\u2014life isn\u2019t perfect. Or predictable. Don\u2019t expect it to be.</p><p>One minute, you\u2019re swimming along in the ocean. The water\u2019s smooth and calm; you\u2019re relaxed. And then\u2014out of nowhere\u2014an undertow sucks you down.</p><p>It\u2019s what you do next that counts. Do you give it all you\u2019ve got? Kick for the surface, even though your arms and legs are aching? Or do you give up and let yourself drown?</p><p>how you react to life\u2019s twists and turns makes all the difference.</p><p>So Number Three\u2014the important thing is, if you can make it through the rough, unexpected times? That light at the end of the tunnel is worth all the shit you had to wade through to get there.</p><p>That\u2019s something I\u2019ll never forget. I\u2019m reminded of it every time I look at Kate. Every time I look at our son.</p><p>When it\u2019s all said and done? The payoff is way more than f**king worth it. </p> </body></html>"]
