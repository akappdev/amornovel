This can lead to lifelong happiness or a very confused potential mate.</p><p>\u2014Mating Rituals and Love Customs of the Were</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t do this.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cJane.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just wrong,\u201d I whimpered. \u201cIt defies the laws of nature, the thin line that separates good and evil.\u201d</p><p>Zeb rolled his eyes and snapped the bridal binder shut. \u201cIt\u2019s just a dress, Jane.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a puce dress, Zeb.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJolene\u2019s getting it in peach.\u201d He grunted, clearly at his limit in dealing with whiny undead bridal-party members. \u201cWhy are you being so difficult?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy is your fianc\u00e9e insisting that I dress like Naomi from Mama\u2019s Family?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that bad,\u201d Zeb insisted.</p><p>\u201cNot that bad?\u201d I opened the binder and pinned the offending picture with my finger. The model\u2019s defiantly blank expression could not mask her embarrassment at wearing this sateen nightmare. It was off the shoulder, with a wide ruffle of retina-burning color that gathered at the cleavage with a fabric cabbage rose. The traditional butt bow actually connected to what can only be described as a waist lapel.</p><p>Despite not having that many girlfriends, I had been a bridesmaid three times in ten years. Apparently, I was tall enough to \u201cmatch\u201d the rest of the bridal party for Marcy, my college roommate from freshman year. My sophomore roommate, Carrie, had a cousin who had the nerve to get pregnant, and I just happened to fit the cousin\u2019s abandoned bridesmaid dress. I\u2019m pretty sure my junior roommate, Lindsay, only asked me because she wanted \u201cplain\u201d bridesmaids. She said something about not wanting to be outshone on her big day.</p><p>I was thankful to get a private room my senior year.</p><p>My sister, Jenny, never even considered making me a bridesmaid. Ironically, her reason for not asking me\u2014not liking me\u2014resulted in this inadvertent and certainly unintentional kindness.</p> <p>I\u2019d suffered butt bows. I\u2019d carried those stupid matching shawls that never stayed on past the ceremony. I\u2019d worn Mint Sorbet, Periwinkle Fizz, and Passionate Pomegranate\u2014all of which translated into \u201chideous $175 dress with shoes dyed to match, neither of which you will wear again.\u201d</p><p>And now, Jolene McClaine, the betrothed of my best friend, wanted me to wear the ugliest dress of them all. Jolene and Zeb had met at the local chapter of the Friends and Family of the Undead, where Zeb had sought help after my new undead condition left him even twitchier than usual. It was your basic love story. Boy meets girl. Boy dates girl. Girl turns out to be a werewolf. Boy and girl get engaged and slowly drive me insane.</p><p>In a way, I brought the two of them together, which meant I had no one to blame for this hoop-skirted fiasco but myself. I knew the whole point of having bridesmaids was dressing them like circus folk so you would look better by comparison. But this was beyond the pale. I\u2019d be lucky if angry villagers didn\u2019t pelt me with rotten produce.</p><p>\u201cThis is why I wanted to go shopping with you!\u201d I cried, flopping back on the couch with the boneless petulance of a teenage orthodontia patient.</p><p>\u201cWell, the Bridal Barn closes at about three hours before sunset, Jane. So unless you\u2019re willing to risk bursting into flame just to exercise your control issues over a stupid dress, I think we\u2019re out of options.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmmph.\u201d</p><p>I hadn\u2019t been a vampire for very long, so sometimes I forgot about the limitations of my condition and the pains Zeb took to avoid throwing said limitations in my face. It didn\u2019t mean I was going to wear that monstrosity of a dress, but I would at least stop giving Zeb a hard time. I had developed a nasty habit of needling Zeb since he\u2019d started planning his wedding. Zeb had been my best friend since ... well, forever. I was used to having his undivided attention. Of course, he was used to me breathing and eating solid foods. We\u2019d both had to make adjustments. He was just much better at them.</p><p>It seemed doubly cruel to pick on Zeb now. While some members of Jolene\u2019s family were thrilled that she was marrying a nice guy with a stable income and his own home, there were several uncles who declared the union \u201cclan shame, \u201cthe werewolf version of a shandeh.</p> <p>Werewolves are the most highly evolved were species. They have the most regular change cycle and the most complete, dependable changes. Being natural pack animals in both forms, they also have the most stable social hierarchy. There is an alpha male mated to the female of his choice, who becomes the alpha female. While the lesser clan members have property rights and general free will, all major decisions must be filtered through the alpha couple, particularly the alpha male. Everything from mate selection to business management has to be deemed for the good of the pack.</p><p>Jolene\u2019s family was one of the first to settle in Half-Moon Hollow. Their farm was now home to the clan alpha couple, Lonnie and Mimi McClaine, their three children, eighteen aunts and uncles, and forty-nine cousins. Jolene was the last unmarried female in her generation, which is not to say she had been without proposals. She\u2019d been courted by scions of several prominent werewolf clans. Her own cousin Vance\u2014a tall fellow who reminded me of Jethro from the Beverly Hillbillies, only more broody\u2014had made several failed bids for her paw since she\u2019d turned seventeen. But it was my gangly, goofy, incurably human BFF who stole her heart away.</p><p>Lonnie had to tamp down Vance\u2019s open griping about Jolene\u2019s engagement with a visit to Vance\u2019s trailer. It was the werewolf equivalent of a trip to the woodshed. Vance responded by driving to Zeb\u2019s house and peeing in his yard. Apparently, you have to be a male or a wolf to understand what an insult this was. In a werewolf pack, you cannot interfere with the mate choice of a clan fellow. You cannot intentionally harm that werewolf\u2019s chosen mate. You are not, however, required to help that person should he find himself in a life-threatening situation. Somehow, Zeb had managed to stumble into several such situations in the few months since he\u2019d been engaged to Jolene. He\u2019d had several hunting \u201caccidents\u201d while visiting the McClaine farm, even though he didn\u2019t hunt. The brakes on his car had failed while he was driving home from the farm\u2014twice. Also, a running chainsaw mysteriously fell on him from a hayloft.</p><p>He would never get that pinkie toe back.</p><p>Jolene insisted that her relatives were just being playful. I insisted that Zeb not venture out to the McClaine farm without a vampire escort, which certainly hadn\u2019t improved his stance with the future in-laws. Despite the grudging acceptance they offered Zeb, most of the clan was distrustful of vampires. Some, in fact, wore vampire fangs around their necks, next to the gold-plated charms that spelled out their names.</p><p>On the other side of the aisle were Zeb\u2019s parents, Ginger and Floyd, and they weren\u2019t exactly thrilled about the wedding, either. Mama Ginger had been planning my wedding to her son since we were kids. Apparently, the image of Zeb coming home to my pretend kitchen carrying a briefcase made of newspaper was permanently burned into her cortex. She figured that having known me since I was six and seen multiple examples of my being firmly planted under my own mama\u2019s thumb, I was the only acceptable candidate for a potential daughter-in-law. For my last living Christmas, she\u2019d given me a Precious Moments wedding planner with my and Zeb\u2019s names already filled in.</p><p>Mama Ginger saw the world as it should be, according to Mama Ginger. And when something didn\u2019t conform to that vision, she went to drastic lengths to correct it. I didn\u2019t know what made her think she had the right. It may have had something to do with all the chemicals she inhaled at her not-quite-licensed kitchen beauty shop. Just to give you an example, Mama Ginger could not fathom that I would go to senior prom with anyone but Zeb, so she told several of the mothers at her salon that I was being treated for a suspicious rash. This fixed it so no boy at our high school would go anywhere near me with a corsage. With no other eleventh-hour options, Zeb and I ended up going together. Mama Ginger kept the pictures in a place of honor on her mantel.</p><p>As Mama Ginger couldn\u2019t have her say in choosing the bride, she\u2019d decided to make planning the wedding as unpleasant as possible. She\u2019d objected to the wedding date, saying it conflicted with her bingo night. Every plan Jolene had was dismissed as alternately \u201ctrashy\u201d or \u201ctoo highfalutin.\u201d Mama Ginger was also incredibly insulted when Jolene politely refused the Precious Moments bride-and-groom cake topper she\u2019d saved for Zeb\u2019s wedding.</p><p>Precious Moments. Gah. I could rip a man\u2019s spinal column out through his nose, and I still found those things frightening.</p><p>Zeb\u2019s father, Floyd, had expressed little interest in the wedding after he found out there wouldn\u2019t be a Velveeta fountain or a big screen showing the scheduled UK basketball game.</p><p>So, the reception was going to be fun. As much fun as one could have while dressed as Satan\u2019s tea cozy.</p><p>The Naomi Harper bridesmaids\u2019 dresses were a concession to the McClaine family tradition of renting formal wear from Jolene\u2019s aunt Vonnie\u2019s dress shop, the Bridal Barn. Vonnie made all of the dresses herself, using three patterns, all of which ended up looking like a circa 1982 pattern called \u201cRuffles and Dreams.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, Janie, I know it\u2019s ugly,\u201d Zeb said, his big doe eyes all guileless and earnest. Dang it, I always buckled under the baby browns. \u201cIt is the world\u2019s ugliest dress. Of all the dresses you will ever wear, this is the one your body may reject like a faulty organ. As soon as I get back from the honeymoon, I will help you build the bonfire to burn this dress. But I\u2019m asking you as my closest friend in the entire world, will you please just wear the stupid dress for one day? Without whining? Or describing it? Or making Jolene feel bad? Or pissing off Jolene\u2019s cousins?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAny more conditions?\u201d I grumbled.</p><p>\u201cI reserve the right to make addendums,\u201d he said, one sandy-blond brow arching its way up to curly hair of the same shade.</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of kindergarten teacher talks like that?\u201d I groused. Engagement had changed Zeb. He was more aggressive, more mature, partly from having to defend himself in life-threatening situations. Unfortunately, he was being more aggressive and mature with me, which sucked.</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of children\u2019s librarian takes a job at an occult bookstore?\u201d he countered.</p><p>\u201cVampire.\u201d I pointed to my chest. \u201cAnd I\u2019m not a librarian anymore. When they fire you, they kind of take the label, too.\u201d</p><p>Zeb\u2019s smile thinned as he blinked owlishly and pressed his fingers to his temples. He took a pill bottle out of his pocket.</p><p>\u201cYou OK?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d He sighed. \u201cI\u2019ve just been getting these headaches lately.\u201d</p><p>My pessimistic brain flashed on possibilities including clots and tumors. Batting down small flares of panic, I asked, \u201cHave you seen a doctor?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. He said they\u2019re probably stress-related.\u201d</p><p>I poked a finger at the wedding binder. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWedding planning is stressful, even when you\u2019re not marrying into a family with mouths full of fangs and guts full of burning hatred, both of which are aimed at you,\u201d Zeb muttered as he dry-swallowed two Tylenol. \u201cOn a brighter note, where\u2019s your ghostly roommate?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOut,\u201d I said of my great-aunt Jettie, who had died about six months before I was turned and had been pleasantly haunting me ever since. \u201cWith my grandpa Fred again. They\u2019re becoming quite the hot and heavy couple.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t realize ghosts roamed around so much,\u201d he said. \u201cWhere do they go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs long as it keeps me from seeing two deceased old people getting all touchy on my couch, I do not care.\u201d</p><p>He grinned. \u201cThat\u2019s so gross.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me about it.\u201d I grimaced. \u201cI\u2019m working extra shifts at the bookstore, unpaid, just to get out of the house. I keep walking into rooms and finding them ... guuuuh. And speaking of the store, we need to table the dress negotiations for now. My shift starts in about an hour. We\u2019re expecting some ancient Babylonian scrolls that Mr. Wainwright found on eBay, so he\u2019s really excited. He thinks they may have been used in a summoning rite.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, you purchased ancient Babylonian texts, which may or may not call forth Gozer the Destroyer, on eBay?\u201d Zeb asked. He cocked his head and gave a goofy grin. \u201cYou know, a year ago, I would have thought you were kidding.\u201d</p><p>I shrugged, pushing the dreaded bridesmaid\u2019s dress photo from my considerable field of vision. \u201cAnd yet ...\u201d</p><p>I scooped up the ringing phone, knowing before I pressed it to my ear that it would be my mother. I didn\u2019t use my spiffy new mind-reading powers or anything. Mama called every night before my shift to make sure I was careful on the three-step walk from my car to the bookstore. She tended to \u201cforget\u201d that I now had superstrength and could twist any prospective mugger into a pretzel.</p><p>Mama had responded to my coming out as a vampire with the traditional stages of grief. She just got stuck at denial. She had decided to ignore it completely and pretend it away. She brought two frozen pot pies over to my house each week to \u201chelp me out with meals,\u201d which was handy, because I needed something around to feed the ever-ravenous Jolene. Mama dropped by during the day, then got upset when the vampire \u201csleepy-time\u201d instinct kept me from chatting. It was as if she thought I could change my mind about being a vampire and give back my membership card.</p><p>\u201cI have some bad news, honey,\u201d Mama said as I picked up the phone. She\u2019d long since parted with the niceties of phone greetings. After a dramatic pause, she said, \u201cGrandpa Bob passed last night.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAwww,\u201d I moaned. \u201cAnother one?\u201d</p><p>This may seem like a strange, even cold, reaction. But you have to understand my grandma Ruthie\u2019s marital history. She\u2019d been widowed four times, via milk truck, anaphylactic shock, spider bite, and lightning strike (the lamented, aforementioned Grandpa Fred). I wrote a poem titled \u201cGrandpa\u2019s in an Urn\u201d in fifth grade. I had to spend a lot of time in the guidance counselor\u2019s office after that.</p><p>I loved Bob. Despite not being my actual grandpa or even a step-grandpa yet, Bob had always been nice to me. But he was engaged to Grandma Ruthie for five years and had chronic conditions of the heart, lungs, and liver. He had survived longer than expected.</p> <p>\u201cYour grandmother says there was some sort of mix-up with his medication.\u201d Mama sighed. I could practically hear the cap from her \u201cnerve pills\u201d rattling loose.</p><p>Knowing this would take a while, Zeb got out my blender to begin another batch of experimental \u201cJane shakes.\u201d He\u2019d been using a combination of condiments and dessert toppings to make the synthetic blood a little bit more like the human food I missed so much. My current favorite was Faux Type O mixed with a little bit of cherry syrup and a lot of Hershey\u2019s new Blood Additive Chocolate Syrup: \u201cThe pleasant sensation of chocolate without the unpleasant undead side effects!\u201d That was an excellent selling point considering those side effects were the vomiting and agony that came with vampires trying to digest solid foods.</p><p>Mama\u2019s voice trembled under the weight of Grandma Ruthie\u2019s expectations. \u201cI don\u2019t know what I\u2019m going to do. Grandma seems to think we should be hosting the funeral as the next of kin. Bob\u2019s children are having a fit. She\u2019s already made a scene down at Whitlow\u2019s Funeral Home over the release of the body. And now she expects me to help her plan the visitation, the buffet, the service\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe full Ruthie Early-Lange-Bodeen-Floss-Whitaker special?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cI wish you would stop calling it that,\u201d Mama huffed.</p> <p>\u201cShe\u2019s held the same funeral service for four husbands. I\u2019ll call it what I want.\u201d I snorted.</p><p>\u201cJane, I\u2019m really going to need your help with this,\u201d Mama said, the faintest wheedling tone creeping into her voice.</p><p>\u201cWhy can\u2019t Jenny help you with this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJenny\u2019s busy with the Charity League Follies, and she\u2019s serving as chairwoman of the Women\u2019s Club Winter Ball this year.\u201d Mama was in a full-blown whine now.</p><p>\u201cBut good old Jane doesn\u2019t have a life, right? Why not make her chairwoman of the funeral luncheon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t start that, Jane,\u201d Mama warned. \u201cIf you would just talk to Jenny and work out this silly business, you could both help me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI think it ceased being silly business when I was deposed,\u201d I told her.</p><p>Jenny had made good on her promise not to talk to me after I came out to my family. She had, however, sent me a lovely note through the law firm of Hapscombe and Schmidt, stating that Jenny wanted access to the family Bible. The Bible, which contained all of the Early genealogical information, had been willed to me through our great-aunt Jettie as part of the contents of our ancestral home, River Oaks. Jenny\u2019s lawyers had stated that as a vampire, I could not touch it and had no use for it. I\u2019d had the local offices of the ACLU and the World Council for the Equal Treatment of the Undead send her a cease-and-desist letter stating that such statements were inflammatory and untrue. She\u2019d responded by sending me a copy of the family tree she\u2019d painstakingly calligraphed onto parchment, with my name burned out with a soldering iron. An ugly flurry of legal correspondence followed, and I ended up drinking Thanksgiving \u201cdinner\u201d with my parents after the rest of my family went home.</p><p>\u201cNow, don\u2019t expect me to take sides,\u201d Mama said. \u201cYou girls are going to have to work this out yourselves.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMost of the funeral stuff is going to be done during daylight hours,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019m not even going to be able to attend the burial. Humans get upset when vampires burst into flames right next to them.\u201c</p><p>\u201cBut you have all the time in the world to plan Zeb\u2019s wedding,\u201d Mama grumbled. She always got a little cranky when I brought up the \u201cv word.\u201d \u201cWhere\u2019s the happy couple registered? The Dollar Store?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFirst of all ... that was really funny,\u201d I whispered, glad that Zeb had ducked into the walk-in pantry and hadn\u2019t heard it. \u201cBut it was a mean thing to say. I\u2019m the only one allowed to make mean jokes about Jolene\u2019s family, as I am the one wearing the ugliest dress in the history of bridesmaid-kind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat color is it?\u201d Mama demanded. \u201cIt\u2019s not yellow, is it? Because you know yellow makes you look sallow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMama, focus, please. I will help with the prep work for Bob\u2019s funeral as much as I can, during the evening, when I can fit it in around work hours. But I can\u2019t do much.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s all I\u2019m asking for, honey, a little effort,\u201d she said, placated.</p><p>\u201cAs little as possible,\u201d I assured her. \u201cHow is Grandma doing?\u201d I asked, trying not to let the resentment in my voice bubble through the phone line. \u201cShould I stop by her house on the way to work?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm, no,\u201d Mama said in a sad attempt to be vague. \u201cThere\u2019s going to be such a crowd there ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd it would be a shame for me to come by and make things awkward,\u201d I finished for her. The heavy silence on Mama\u2019s end said I was right, but Mama preferred not to put it into words.</p><p>I don\u2019t know why Grandma\u2019s rejection of me still stung. Elderly relatives were supposed to give you lipsticky kisses and ask intrusive questions about your love life. They were supposed to brag about your achievements to the point where nonrelatives wanted to gouge their eardrums at the mere mention of your name. They were not supposed to request at least one week\u2019s advance notice if you attended family gatherings or insist on wearing a cross the size of a hubcap whenever you walked into a room. My only consolation was that Grandma looked like Flavor Flav and usually tipped over under the weight of her bling.</p><p>Eager to get back to a subject she could control, Mama listed the dishes she expected me to prepare to perk up the usual funeral potluck offerings. Apparently, there was some sort of dessert involving Jell-O, cream cheese, and mandarin oranges in my future. While I saw it as completely unfair that someone who didn\u2019t eat should have to cook, these arguments failed to impress Mama. I promised to come by for my assigned shopping list after dark.</p><p>\u201cHow are things going with that Gabriel?\u201d Mama asked. Mama was happy I was dating someone, particularly someone who literally came from one of the oldest families in town. But she was pretending that Gabriel wasn\u2019t, either. I could only expect so much. \u201cHave you seen him lately?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot for a week or so. He had to go to Nashville for business.\u201d</p><p>On the other end of the line, Mama sighed. Dang it. I had just extended the conversation by about twenty minutes. Ever since I\u2019d established a semi-sort-of-relationship with Gabriel, Mama\u2019s favorite activity had been giving me relationship advice. I thought she saw it as a girlie bonding thing. \u201cHoney, what have I always told you?\u201d</p><p>Now, honestly, that could be any number of things, ranging from \u201cAvoid contact with any surface in a public bathroom\u201d to \u201cMen don\u2019t buy the cow when you hand them the keys to the dairy.\u201d So I took a shot in the dark.</p><p>\u201cUm, never trust a man with two first names,\u201d I guessed.</p><p>\u201cWell, yes, but not what I had in mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever trust a man with a remote-control fireplace?\u201d I suggested.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said, her patience audibly thinning.</p><p>\u201cNever trust a\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHoney.\u201d I could almost hear Mama shaking her head in dismay at my lack of man-savvy. \u201cRelationships are fifty-fifty, give and take. You have to make an effort. He\u2019s up there all by himself for a whole week. Why couldn\u2019t you go up to visit him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have to work. And isn\u2019t that kind of desperate?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing wrong with showing some interest. You could make a little more of an effort. I could have Sheila take a look at your hair\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMama, I really need to get off the phone if I\u2019m going to make it to work on time,\u201d I said. \u201cAnd Zeb\u2019s over here, and we\u2019re trying to talk about bridesmaid stuff. I\u2019ve really got to go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t let them put you in yellow. You know how washed-out you look in yellow!\u201d Mama was saying as I put the receiver in its cradle.</p><p>\u201cSomeone has to lock my grandma up. She\u2019s single-handedly taking down the Greatest Generation,\u201d I moaned.</p><p>Zeb smirked at me as I slumped down and smacked my head against the counter. In a granite-muffled voice, I told him, \u201cShut it, or I\u2019m calling your mama and telling her that your parents\u2019 names aren\u2019t on the invitations. That\u2019ll keep you tied up for months.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat seems uncalled for,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>2</p><p>From were-weasels to werewolves, weres are territorial creatures. Once a pack has established a home, they will not leave that location for generations, until the local food sources have been depleted or they\u2019re burnt out by angry farmers.</p><p>\u2014Mating Rituals and Love Customs of the Were</p><p>Half-Moon Hollow is a strange place for a vampire to spend her days. We don\u2019t have a performing-arts center or a museum, but we have had our own \u201cRowdy Rural Towns\u201d episode of COPS. The program had never before featured the arrest of a naked guy stealing anhydrous ammonia.</p><p>The chamber of commerce had a hard time fitting that into the brochure.</p><p>Living in Kentucky is a mix of the ridiculous and the sublime. The same state that is home to top-shelf research hospitals, major manufacturers, and thoroughbred horse racing is a place where you can attend a schoolbus crash-up derby. (They do take the kids off the buses before they race them.) We have Opera Houses and Opry Houses. We have cities that are home to hundreds of thousands and towns like the Hollow, where one day, if the right couple gets engaged, the entire population will be related by marriage.</p><p>News of my transformation was slowly making the rounds of the Hollow kitchen circuit thanks to my former boss, Mrs. Stubblefield, using my application for undead unemployment benefits as justification for firing me from my position as the library\u2019s director of juvenile services. Of course, she fired me hours before I was turned, but that didn\u2019t keep her from crowing, \u201cI told you so!\u201d She couldn\u2019t possibly let someone \u201clike that\u201d work around the public, much less as a children\u2019s librarian, she told anyone who would listen. Mrs. Woodley, whose five children I personally tutored in the library\u2019s Reading Remedy program, told her to shut her mouth or she\u2019d toss Mrs. Stubblefield\u2019s lumpy butt out of the Half-Moon Hollow Ladies\u2019 Garden Club. I sent Mrs. Woodley a dozen frozen pot pies as a thank you.</p><p>Mrs. Stubblefield had recently \u201cretired\u201d (was asked to retire) after a band of roving teenagers\u2014without my after-school tutoring program to keep them occupied\u2014stuck pages from nudie magazines in all of the encyclopedias. And no one on the staff noticed. For a month. Plus, there was evidence that Mrs. Stubblefield shared her morning coffee with Jack Daniel\u2019s.</p><p>Mrs. Stubblefield\u2019s retirement meant that her stepdaughter, Posey, was the most senior member of the library staff. Posey, who was brought in to replace me, couldn\u2019t understand the Dewey Decimal System without \u201cSounds like ...\u201d clues and laughed the way it was written out: \u201cHa ha ha ha ha ha.\u201d I hated her on principle. And that principle was bitterness. Through Mama, I heard about Book Club nights, trumped-up late fines, and items being checked out of the (cannot possibly be replaced, never to leave the library) Special Collections room. Grant application deadlines had been missed. Federal funding fell through for Puppet Time Theater and the Adult Literacy Program.</p><p>Slowly but surely, my favorite library patrons were making their way over to the bad part of town to seek me out for their reading needs. It started when the Wednesday Night Book Club president, Anne Woodhouse, stopped by to talk to me about a selection. Anne had lost faith in Mrs. Stubblefield\u2019s suggestions after she recommended that the club read the sequel to A Million Little Pieces. Then Sally Dortch stopped by to ask about Newbery Medal selections for little Hannah\u2019s book report, but she saw Mr. Wainwright\u2019s display of fertility idols and bolted. To be fair, giant ceramic phalluses generally send me running for the nearest exit, too. Finally, Justine Marcum and Kitty Newsome, the same library board members who helped Mrs. Stubblefield give me the boot, put on trench coats and Jackie O sunglasses to sneak into the shop and magnanimously announce that the board was willing to overlook my vampire status and welcome me back to the staff.</p><p>I\u2019m not going to say it wasn\u2019t tempting. It bothered me to see my library\u2014a place that represented everything human and familiar to me\u2014suffering, to see programs that had taken me years to cultivate crumbling. And I missed my kids. I missed their little faces, still and enraptured, during Story Time. I missed helping each one find just the right book to help spark a love of reading, introducing them to the books that I loved as a kid: Roald Dahl, Louisa May Alcott, Ann M. Martin. I missed bringing teenagers back to reading after they finally got through that horrible \u201cI\u2019m too cool to like anything\u201d phase. But I had entered a new phase in my life, and as far I was concerned, I could still do the kind of work I did at the library at Specialty Books.</p><p>I had done my best to keep in touch with the human world, be a respectable undead citizen. Andrea Byrne, my new blood-surrogate friend, was helping me find classes and other constructive activities to fill the night hours. We had started taking yoga together. Sure, I didn\u2019t technically need breathing exercises anymore, but I was finally coordinated enough to balance on one foot. I had made a few friends there, several of whom switched to a different class after they realized I was a vampire. In further personal development, I\u2019d started recycling everything in sight. Since I was going to be walking the earth a lot longer than originally forecast, I wanted it to last as long as possible. This, combined with the yoga, convinced my mother that I had joined a cult. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I was one of a few vampires in the Hollow who chose to maintain relationships with the living after being turned. Studies showed that most vampires who had turned since tax consultant/vampire Arnie Frink outed us with his right-to-work lawsuit dropped out of sight and moved to big cities such as New York or New Orleans. They became assimilated into the large populations of vampires and learned how to adjust to their new lifestyles ... or they became addicted to chemically enhanced blood, passed out in a gutter, and woke up as the rising sun fried them to a crisp. At least, that\u2019s what Mama told me when I mentioned that I might go to St. Louis for a seminar called \u201cEmerging Issues for the Postmillennial Undead.\u201d Apparently, Oprah did a whole show on \u201cVampires Led Astray.\u201d</p><p>And somehow, I\u2019d made it onto the undead junk-mail radar. I started receiving advertisements for Sans Solar sun-blocking drapes and specialized vampire \u201csleeping compartments,\u201d which were basically coffins. But at least I\u2019d stopped getting credit-card applications. After the government considers you dead, credit-card companies are less likely to extend a credit line to you. It\u2019s the one discriminatory attitude toward vampires that\u2019s fine by me.</p><p>But even the undead could appreciate the magical air in the Hollow as Christmas approached. The early December temperatures, always a crap shoot in western Kentucky, were hovering in the mid-40s. As a human, I\u2019d been a summer person. But when \u201cgetting a little color on your cheeks\u201d could leave you with third-degree burns and/or permanent death, you learn to appreciate the joys of winter. The days were getting shorter, meaning that I could get up and around earlier. The cold brought a sharpness to the scents of the living, bright splashes of scent against a misty gray.</p> <p>The chill also gave me an excuse to wear the sleek new black coat I\u2019d bought on a rather disastrous shopping trip with Andrea. She took me on a tour of these nice underground shops (not literally) on the outskirts of Memphis. And I didn\u2019t buy a damn thing but the coat. But at least I no longer looked like I was walking around in a big puffy sleeping bag.</p><p>Christmas in the Hollow means spitting snow that never amounts to anything but still sends everyone running for bread and milk. It means exchanging decorative tins of cookies with acquaintances you don\u2019t like that much. It\u2019s mall Santas who arrive in fire trucks and challenging your neighborhood to a round of competitive outdoor decorating. Because you\u2019re not really celebrating the birth of Jesus unless your house can be spotted by passing aircraft.</p><p>I stamped the whopping half-inch of snow (mostly sleet and mud) from my boots as I neared the door of Specialty Books. The familiar smell of dust and crumbling paper greeted me as I called out to Mr. Wainwright. The shop was much cleaner than it had been that fateful night when I had wandered in and narrowly missed a shelf collapsing on top of me. Well, the mess was newer. We had at least lined up the bookshelves so that customers could navigate without climbing. The soft hum of fluorescent lighting flickered over piles of browning paperbacks and splitting leather bindings. Gilt titles, rubbed away by loving fingers, glinted dully from their piles. I slid my shoulder bag behind the counter and surveyed the damage Mr. Wainwright had wrought since I had left twelve hours before.</p><p>Trying to organize the shop was an uphill battle, and I was making no progress. It wasn\u2019t that Mr. Wainwright ignored my efforts, but when he looked for something, he had this way of tearing through like a tornado. We had a system: I spent three days painstakingly arranging a subject section; he destroyed it in less than an hour. It was like working for a slightly dangerous three-year-old.</p><p>I was, however, proud of the fact that there were no longer dead spiders occupying an entire shelf in the reference section. They were now occupying a jar in Mr. Wainwright\u2019s office. He\u2019s a nice man. I try not to ask questions.</p> <p>Our evening routine consisted of two hours of cleaning and boxing the online orders. Then, with no customers to speak of, he would make tea or warm bottled blood, and we would sit at the counter. He would tell me stories of his travels across the world seeking demon artifacts, vampire horde houses, and packs of rare were-creatures. He even spent five years in Manitoba searching for Sasquatch.</p><p>\u201cHello? Mr. Wainwright?\u201d I called again. I would never get to a point where I could call him by his first name. A person who knows that there was more than one Bront\u00eb sister deserves to be addressed with respect.</p><p>\u201cBack here, Jane,\u201d came a muffled voice from the rear of the shop.</p><p>I followed his voice to the stockroom, which we had only rediscovered the night before. Mr. Wainwright had \u201cmisplaced\u201d the door behind a rack of old Tales from the Crypt comics sometime in the mid-1980s.</p><p>\u201cMr. Wainwright?\u201d I saw two brown loafers sticking out from under a carton in a horrible parody of The Wizard of Oz. Mr. Wainwright\u2019s about eighty years old and looks as if you could snap him like kindling. His being pinned under a giant box of heavy books was not going to keep my paltry part-time employment checks coming in.</p><p>\u201cAre you all right?\u201d I cried, lifting the box off him with little effort.</p> <p>\u201cOh, thank you, Jane,\u201d he said, sitting up from his spot on the floor. He seemed to have made the best of his predicament. His ever-present lumpy gray cardigan was pillowed under his head. Clutched in one hand was an old dog-eared copy of Stephen King\u2019s Nightmares and Dreamscapes. \u201cFortunately, when the box fell on me, this bounced off my head. I haven\u2019t read it in years. You must admire the universal accessibility of Mr. King. He scares the bejesus out of me every time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd he\u2019s the reason I have clown issues,\u201d I said, shuddering at the thought of It. \u201cHow long have you been down here?\u201d</p><p>He rolled his shoulders. \u201cOh, three or four hours at the most.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you hurt?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m tougher than I look,\u201d he said as I lifted him up and set him on a dusty folding chair.</p><p>\u201cI thought we agreed you weren\u2019t going to try to move things around without me here? After yesterday. When the other box fell on you,\u201d I said, struggling to keep a patient tone. I couldn\u2019t believe I was the practical one in this relationship.</p><p>\u201cWell, yes, but I wasn\u2019t trying to move anything, I was searching for the light switch, you see, and knocked the shelving unit over. I remembered a book I left in here that I thought you might be interested in,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cYou remembered a book you left in here twenty years ago?\u201d I asked him. \u201cWhat am I saying, of course you did. Why don\u2019t you tell me where it is, and I\u2019ll get it for you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, I think that would be best,\u201d he said. \u201cTop shelf. In the box marked \u2018Bell Witch.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>I spider-climbed nimbly up the wall and plucked the box from the top shelf. Mr. Wainwright was grinning like a kid with a new comic book. He always got excited when I manifested my vampire powers. I unfolded the top of the carton and then thought better of it.</p><p>\u201cIf I put my hand in this box, is there anything that will bite, sting, cut, burn, or turn me into dust?\u201d</p><p>This is one of the problems with working in an occult store. The previous week, I nearly lost a digit to a diary whose lock clapped a silver trap around keyless fingers. Vampires are allergic to silver. Touching it feels like a combination of burning, itching, and being forced to lick dry ice. If Mr. Wainwright hadn\u2019t come along with the suspicious little lock-busting gizmo he carries in his pocket, I wouldn\u2019t be able to make all those shadow puppets I like so much.</p><p>Mr. Wainwright chewed his lip. \u201cJust to be safe, I\u2019ll do the honors.\u201d</p><p>From the cobwebby, mouse-stained cardboard, Mr. Wainwright pulled a book titled The Spectrum of Vampirism. \u201cHere we are,\u201d he said, handing it to me. \u201cI thought you might find this useful. It\u2019s very good, written by a Harvard fellow named Milton Winstead in the 1920s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHarvard?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, they can\u2019t all be law scholars and presidential candidates.\u201d Mr. Wainwright shrugged.</p><p>\u201cThere are actual shades of vampirism?\u201d I asked, reading over the table of contents and flipping to a chapter.</p><p>Vampires do not produce their own blood cells, which is why they must consume blood. The ingested blood is infused with the vampire\u2019s essence when metabolized, giving the vampire the ability to turn others. A vampire\u2019s power depends on the amount of vampire blood consumed during transformation. To make a childe, a vampire will feed on a victim until he or she reaches the point of death. The sire must be careful not to leave the initiate unconscious or unable to consume the blood needed to complete the transformation, usually two to three pints. The process is literally draining for the sire, meaning that a vampire will create only two or three children in his or her considerable lifetime.</p><p>The stronger and older a vampire is at the point of creating a childe, the more likely that childe is to be a \u201chealthy\u201d vampire. A quick or careless turning can result in a sickly vampire, who may suffer from the vampire\u2019s weaknesses\u2014sensitivity to sunlight and silver\u2014but few of the strengths. Some humans seek this level of vampirism to achieve eternal youth and enhanced beauty. Several devotees of the theatrical profession have been rumored to have partaken in this ritual over the years.</p><p>\u201cHuh, I thought vampirism was pretty much a yea-or-nay proposition.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no, no,\u201d Mr. Wainwright said. \u201cThere are many subtle levels of vampirism, of power and ability. You see, there is so much for you to learn. It\u2019s so exciting for me to be here with you for the journey from bloodthirsty neophyte to sophisticated veteran vampire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHappy to oblige,\u201d I said, shrugging amiably. \u201cAlthough technically, I\u2019ve never been what you\u2019d call bloodthirsty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean to hurt your feelings, dear,\u201d he said. \u201cBut don\u2019t you see how lucky you are? Vampires are among the few beings who trace their history as they live it. You can see the past, present, and future. You know who your great-great-grandparents, great-grandparents, and grandparents are. As your children or, in your case, nephews\u2014now, don\u2019t make that face, dear\u2014as your nephews have children and grandchildren and great-grandchildren, you\u2019ll be able to watch them grow and live and die, each generation, if you take care of yourself, for eternity.\u201d</p><p>Staggered by the depressing nature of that thought, I patted his hands. \u201cBut you can do that, too, just on a smaller scale. I mean, everybody around here knows who their great-grandparents are. And you have your nephew. You\u2019ve been able to watch him grow up and have children.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy nephew moved to Guatemala for mission work nearly five years ago, and I rarely hear from him. I don\u2019t see him having children, if there is a just and loving God.\u201d Mr. Wainwright shook his head fondly at the mention of Emery, his late sister\u2019s Bible-thumping, personality-free son. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t know who my great-grandparents were, at least not any relatives in this area. My mother was from up north, upstate New York, and my father died when I was very young. I\u2019m afraid their union wasn\u2019t a very happy one, and she didn\u2019t keep many of his things. He rarely spoke to her about his family. And it seemed to upset her to talk about him. It might have been nice to have relatives, but from what I can see, it\u2019s a sort of genetic crapshoot. You\u2019re not likely to end up related to people you like.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCase in point, my grandma Ruthie. But then you have wonderful chromosomal coincidences like my aunt Jettie and my dad.\u201d He smiled. \u201cHow about I start clearing through these boxes and you can get back to the Internet orders?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWonderful,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd Jane, dear\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t throw anything away without showing it to you first,\u201d I repeated. \u201cHow was I supposed to know that was spirit writing? It looked like a bunch of doodles on a cocktail napkin.\u201d</p><p>By the time Mr. Wainwright brought me an ancient Limoges teacup filled with microwaved pig\u2019s blood, I was covered in a fine layer of dust but had cleared away most of the stock into \u201cKeep,\u201d \u201cThrow Away,\u201d and \u201cBurn on Consecrated Ground\u201d piles.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d I said, accepting the cup with a grateful nonbeating heart.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a young man asking for you up front, Jane,\u201d he said as I sipped. \u201cI think he\u2019s one of your kind. He looks vaguely familiar, but I can\u2019t quite place him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid he mention working for the council?\u201d I asked. \u201cThings tend to go badly for me when they drop by for a visit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI doubt it,\u201d Mr. Wainwright said. \u201cHe\u2019s wearing a T-shirt that says, \u2018One tequila, two tequila, three tequila, floor.\u2019 I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever seen a vampire in a novelty T-shirt before. Extraordinary, really.\u201d</p><p>That could only be one vampire.</p><p>Richard Cheney, whom I delight in calling Dick, is an old friend of Gabriel\u2019s\u2014about 150 years old. Buddies from the cradle, they split over a gambling debt in their early twenties. Dick was turned eleven years later, also over a gambling debt. Do you see a pattern here? Dick is the local center for not-quite-legitimate commerce. If you want something, just ask Dick. But don\u2019t ask where, how, or which international laws he broke while procuring it. Also, you\u2019ll want to pay in cash.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t as difficult as I\u2019d expected to blend my one living friend into my new undead circle. Dick and Zeb got along famously. As Dick put it, Zeb \u201cgrows on you, like a stray, spazzy puppy that followed you home.\u201d And Zeb and Gabriel built a friendship on the shared experience of saving my ass from Missy, Dick\u2019s murderous ex. Even better, Zeb had somehow formed a bridge between Gabriel and Dick, former childhood friends who had turned eternal life into a prolonged male pissing contest. Thanks to the time they\u2019d spent with Zeb, Gabriel and Dick had declared something of a ceasefire. And while they certainly weren\u2019t going to be getting matching tattoos anytime soon, at least Dick had stopped leaving silver shavings on Gabriel\u2019s furniture. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>If I was the best maid, then Dick could be considered Zeb\u2019s man of honor. Dick secured his spot in the wedding party after spending several bonding-filled weeks on Zeb\u2019s couch after his trailer blew up. Gabriel might have been promoted above groomsman had he been in town more often lately ... and not made fun of Zeb\u2019s extensive GI Joe collection.</p><p>Whether it\u2019s because he genuinely enjoys my company or enjoys irritating Gabriel, Dick and I had spent a lot of time together since I was turned. He became a regular visitor at River Oaks. In fact, he stayed on my couch for a few days after he wore out his welcome at Zeb\u2019s. Using his secret vampire wiles, Gabriel anonymously set Dick up at a nearby apartment because of Dick\u2019s tendency to make comments such as the following.</p><p>\u201cAh, the lovely Jane. I\u2019ve always said you were a dirty girl,\u201d he said, swiping at the dust on my cheek. Dick could be considered attractive if you considered laughing sea-green eyes, razor-sharp cheekbones, and full pouting lips permanently twisted into a mocking, yet somehow seductive smirk attractive. Combine that with the constant barrage of sassy banter, and you got a \u201cYou\u2019ll regret me in the morning\u201d charisma that had almost every female who crossed his path melting into little puddles of giggly goo at his feet. I was a rare exception and, as Dick often reminded me, his only strictly platonic friend who also happened to have breasts.</p> <p>I had a soft spot for Dick Cheney. Technically, it was my fault that his trailer had been torched by Missy in an attempt to frame me for his murder. And in between the disturbing innuendos, there was normally a nugget of likability.</p><p>Buried deep, deep down.</p><p>\u201cWow, you are truly master of the single entendre.\u201d I rolled my eyes. \u201cDo your lines work on anybody, ever?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just wanted to check on you, Stretch,\u201d he said, patting my head, a gesture that he knew I hated. \u201cHaven\u2019t seen you in a few days. I worry when I\u2019m not called to save your cute little hind end at least once a week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have a cute little hind end,\u201d I groused.</p> <p>\u201cI know, it\u2019s more medium to large, but I was trying to be kind,\u201d he replied, dodging the Pocket Guide to Poltergeist Activity I chucked at him. \u201cKeep that up, and I\u2019ll go outside, take that rusty bucket you call a car, and drive it into a quarry. It would be a mercy killing.\u201d</p><p>I squealed. \u201cShe\u2019s here?\u201d</p><p>I ran outside to find my old Ford station wagon, Big Bertha, parked in front of the store. Dick had used some of his not-quite-legal connections to barter for spare parts and repairs that I could not afford on a part-time shopgirl\u2019s salary. I just had to tutor some were-skunk mechanic\u2019s kids in English for the next semester.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s beautiful.\u201d I sighed, rubbing a loving hand over the dimpled hood.</p><p>\u201cIt looks exactly the same,\u201d Dick said. \u201cPathetic. It probably cost you as much in repairs as it would to put a down payment on a decent car that doesn\u2019t smoke when you turn the ignition.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBig Bertha was my first car, my first love. Aunt Jettie taught me how to drive in this car. I\u2019m just not ready to give her up yet.\u201d</p> <p>Dick smiled, an indulgent patriarch tolerating my whims. \u201cI figured, which is why I had Billy make some modifications.\u201d</p><p>My hands froze mid-stroke on Bertha\u2019s hood. \u201cDick, what did you do to my car?\u201d</p><p>He grinned. \u201cWell, let\u2019s just say Billy had some ideas for how to make Big Bertha a little more vamp-friendly. Tinted windows, SPF 500, thank you very much. Side-curtain sunshields you can pull down in an emergency. Emergency sun-protection packs tacked under the front seats. A little refrigerated cooler for traveling with blood\u2014it\u2019s cooled through the AC. And the pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance.\u201d He opened the back hatch. There was a coffin-sized door in the floor of the rear compartment. \u201cAn emergency hidey-hole.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is great,\u201d I said. \u201cThis is just, wow ... \u201c He shook his head. \u201cWould it be rude of me to question this sudden burst of generosity?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell.\u201d Dick stretched a companionable arm around my shoulders and offered what I\u2019m sure he thought was a guileless smile. \u201cYou could put in a good word with your friend Andrea.\u201d</p><p>This was the thousandth or so anvil-sized hint Dick had dropped on me to hook him up with my blood-surrogate friend. Most vampires are interested in Andrea Byrne\u2019s delicately flavored, extremely rare AB-negative blood. But Dick was far more interested in the fact that Andrea is also coolly, elegantly, irritatingly gorgeous. The two of them had a strange chemistry, like ammonia and bleach.</p><p>Dick and Andrea moved in very different vampire circles. Most of Andrea\u2019s undead clients had houses without wheels. In a deliciously karmic development, Andrea didn\u2019t want much to do with Dick\u2014not because she was a snob but because he reminded her so much of Mattias Northon, a vampire college professor who had seduced her, introduced her to life as a blood surrogate, and dumped her like a bad habit. Smooth, effortless charm just pissed her off. I think being turned down by a woman for the first time in his long, long life fried something in Dick\u2019s brain, because he\u2019d been obsessed since meeting her.</p><p>\u201cOh, you\u2019re pure evil.\u201d I led him back into the store. \u201cYou almost had me for a second there, pretending to be all sweet and vulnerable. Did you script this conversation out in your head before you came in here? Is your special vampire power flirty manipulation?\u201d</p> <p>Dick made a deep, distressed noise and covered it with a cough. \u201cObviously not. Why won\u2019t she go out with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe knows your type,\u201d I said. \u201cShe\u2019s painfully familiar with your type, Mr. Love \u2018Em, Bite \u2018Em, and Leave \u2018Em.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat seems ... fair,\u201d he said dejectedly. \u201cCould you talk to her\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I said, firmly enunciating each word very carefully. \u201cI\u2019m her friend, not her pimp. Put your big-boy pants on and deal with this yourself. Maybe you could ask her to Zeb and Jolene\u2019s wedding.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled. \u201cSpeaking of the Gormless Wonder, I got this in the mail today.\u201d</p><p>He took a cornflower-blue envelope out of his back pocket and slid it across the counter.</p><p>\u201cWow.\u201d I marveled at the Lavelle-McClaine wedding invitation. I\u2019d been trimmed from the invite list when Zeb and Jolene realized I was honor-bound to attend most of the wedding events anyway, so we didn\u2019t need to bring engraved stationery into the deal. \u201cI\u2019d heard about them, but ... there are no words.\u201d</p><p>Jolene and Zeb were having a Titanic-themed wedding. Personally, I think centering your nuptials around one of history\u2019s greatest maritime disasters is kind of creepy, but Jolene has a serious Kate-and-Leo complex. I guess I shouldn\u2019t judge. When I was a little girl, I dreamed I would get married in an ancient English castle and ride away in a horse-drawn carriage. And my sister would be tied up in the dungeon. Of course, I also thought I\u2019d be marrying Mark-Paul Gosselaar from Saved by the Bell, and we can all see how that turned out.</p><p>Jolene\u2019s theme was a mix of the morbidly historical and old Hollywood glamour. Her wedding ensemble consisted of a rhinestone copy of the Heart of the Ocean and a slightly-too-flattering-to-be-true-to-period costume. Zeb just barely managed to talk her out of having decorative life preservers made up with their names and wedding date. She was, however, using a model of the Titanic to serve chips and salsa. The boat was split in two, the salsa in one side and the chips in the other. She ordered this monstrosity online, along with her wedding ensemble and the invitations with an embossed iceberg on the cover and the words \u201cStruck by Love.\u201d If you looked closely enough at the crags in the pressed-relief iceberg, you could make out Jolene\u2019s and Zeb\u2019s initials.</p><p>Some people should not be allowed access to the Internet.</p><p>\u201cWhat exactly are the rules for bringing dates to werewolf weddings?\u201d I asked. \u201cI didn\u2019t get an invitation per se, so I can\u2019t exactly send back a response card with a \u2018plus one.\u2019 Then again, Gabriel is a groomsman, so I assume they know he\u2019s coming. You, on the other hand, got an invitation, but it\u2019s addressed to you alone. Are you allowed a \u2018plus one\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t been invited to a wedding in about ninety years,\u201d Dick admitted. \u201cI\u2019m still trying to figure out what those little pieces of tissue between the envelopes are for.\u201d</p><p>\u201cZeb said you guys are doing some sort of manly bowling-drinking-bonding thing this weekend. Do I have to give you the \u2018Allow my friend to be hurt by one of your less-than-reputable acquaintances, and you\u2019ll wake up with my foot lodged in your nether regions\u2019 speech?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said, grinning broadly.</p><p>\u201cGood, because the title gives away the ending.\u201d</p><p>Dick muttered, \u201cSee if I help you escape certain death again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, do you have any other homicidal ex-girlfriends who might try to frame me for murder?\u201d</p><p>He made a rude hand motion I choose not to describe here. It was enough to bring Mr. Wainwright out from the shelves to scold Dick for his lack of chivalry.</p><p>\u201cIn my day, gentlemen didn\u2019t make gestures like that at ladies,\u201d he said, drawing himself to his full height. All five feet and six inches of him. Osteoporosis had not been kind.</p><p>Dick grinned lazily, unashamed. \u201cOnce you spend more time with her, Gilbert, you\u2019ll understand.\u201d</p><p>Mr. Wainwright\u2019s eyes narrowed, staring. \u201cDo I know you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Dick said. He winked at me. \u201cSee you later, Stretch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you know him?\u201d I asked after Dick left.</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cI have no idea. I have a much better memory for books than for people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re probably better off,\u201d I assured him.</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t help but overhear you talking about Zeb\u2019s upcoming nuptials, Jane. I think I have a book that might help you.\u201d He held up a soft-cover volume titled Mating Rituals and Love Customs of the Were.</p><p>I opened to a section titled \u201cHuman-Werewolf Relations\u201d and read aloud: \u201cThe best way for a suitor to win over a female werewolf\u2019s father is to present him with a fresh carcass. The larger the game, the more impressive the suit. Deer and elk make a bold statement. Squirrels and rabbits will get you laughed out of the pack.\u201d</p><p>I kissed the top of his balding pate. \u201cA book for every problem. I love you, Mr. Wainwright.\u201d</p><p>He flushed with pleasure, squeezing my hands. \u201cThe feeling is mutual, dear.\u201d</p><p>3</p><p>Because of their natural animalistic leanings, were-creatures are more connected to their sexual instincts than the average human. Because premarital relations are frowned upon in the were community, were honeymoons generally last three or four times as long as human honeymoons.</p><p>\u2014Mating Rituals and Love Customs of the Were</p><p>Other than a new career, new hours, new diet, new friends, and a slightly unhealthy sire-childe relationship, not much had changed in the months since I\u2019d been turned.</p><p>No, wait, I was going broke. That was new.</p><p>My part-time paychecks weren\u2019t enough to fund my \u201cextravagant\u201d lifestyle. Thanks to the wonders of vampirism, I\u2019d been able to cut little extras such as food and medical insurance. But the taxes on River Oaks were coming due soon. The water heater was making weird noises, and there was a suspicious and expensive-looking sag in my roof just over Aunt Jettie\u2019s old room. I had a 200-pound dog to feed and an expensive dental regimen to maintain. And the payment people at Visa were starting to ask questions. The financial juggling was becoming a little more than I could keep up with.</p><p>Complicating matters was the delay in my \u201ctriumph settlement.\u201d Earlier that year, I\u2019d fought Missy the Evil Realtor to the death after she\u2019d framed me for a series of crimes, all in an effort to obtain River Oaks\u2014or, rather, the property River Oaks stood on. My sprawling old family farm was the keystone plot in a tacky undead condo development she had planned. Frustrated by Aunt Jettie\u2019s refusal to sell, Missy had decided to use the World Council for the Equal Treatment of the Undead\u2019s laws governing vampire behavior to yank the property out from under me. So I didn\u2019t feel too bad about running her through with one of her own realty signs.</p><p>In the vampire world, if you kill another vampire in battle, you get all of his or her stuff. And since Missy had spent years amassing property and swindling vampires out of their homes, that amounted to quite a bit of stuff. But after months of red tape and delays, I wasn\u2019t holding my breath for the council to fulfill its promise to fork over Missy\u2019s holdings anytime soon. Of course, holding my breath wouldn\u2019t really matter one way or the other, but ...</p><p>I hadn\u2019t told anyone about my financial woes, not even dearly departed Aunt Jettie. There was nothing I could do. I was stuck. I was too fond of Mr. Wainwright to leave Specialty Books. Even though I was basically an unglorified sales clerk with two advanced degrees, I\u2019d gotten the distinct impression that Mr. Wainwright had come to depend on me. He was doing less and less at the shop, opening later, going to bed earlier in his little apartment over the store, and leaving me to close. I couldn\u2019t abandon him.</p><p>If I told my parents I was having money problems, Mama would, well, I don\u2019t think she would insist I move back in with them now. But I\u2019m sure my life, liberty, and pursuit of healthy boundaries would be infringed upon in some way. And while Gabriel had made repeated offers to help me out financially, that just wasn\u2019t relationship baggage I wanted.</p><p>Most sire-childe relationships are not as complicated as ours. Gabriel is dark and intense, obsessive to the point of being just this side of creepy. Some guys bring you flowers and candy; others exact biblical revenge by pushing trees on top of the drunk hunter who fatally shot you. I\u2019m more of a crunchy-granola-pacifist vampire, so I found this rather disturbing. OK, it was a tiny bit hot but mostly disturbing. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I knew Gabriel was not evil. For that matter, neither was I. Vampires have the same capacity for good and evil that humans do. To be fair, people can lose some notions of etiquette when they\u2019re no longer answering to the moral constraints of human society ... and they thirst for human blood. The bottom line is that if you had evil leanings in life, you\u2019re probably going to embrace them wholeheartedly once you\u2019re undead. If you were a decent person, say a former librarian who loves America and puppies, you\u2019re probably going to be an upstanding, almost vegetarian vampire.</p><p>It took Gabriel and me weeks to work through the weird feelings that followed his murdering Bud Mc-Elray. As a human, I\u2019d never been in love. I\u2019d been in deep, abiding like with several of my boyfriends, but I\u2019d never had that feeling, that \u201cWow, this is a person I could spend the rest of my life with\u201d feeling. And even though Gabriel was one of the few people I could spend the rest of my long, long life with, I couldn\u2019t think of being with him as a permanent situation. He\u2019d saved me. He\u2019d killed for me. But I couldn\u2019t accept that someone like him could be interested in me.</p><p>Gabriel was everything I was not. Sophisticated and complicated and able to color-coordinate a room like you wouldn\u2019t believe. I craved him with a bone-deep lust I\u2019d once reserved exclusively for Godiva truffles. I was fixated, not just in the physical sense\u2014though that was an obvious, and occasionally distracting, bonus\u2014but with what he thought, how he saw the world, how he saw me. It was addictive to see myself reflected in his liquid silver eyes as strong, beautiful, intelligent, interesting, though slightly exasperating. Even when we were together, all I could think about was the next time we could be together.</p> <p>I needed order. I needed constancy. But being with Gabriel was like standing in the center of a swirling eddy, the dark water surrounding you, dizzying, powerful, and beautiful. But all the while, you can\u2019t help but feel those churning walls closing in, threatening to crash in on you and crush you under their weight.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t seem to find my footing in this relationship. It didn\u2019t help that Gabriel kept leaving town on business trips like this current one, the third excursion in as many months. Now that he wasn\u2019t keeping constant \u201cKeep Jane alive and out of trouble\u201d vigils, Gabriel was spending some time catching up with his various business interests. He was the proprietor of three radio stations in the Southeast, plus a hotel in Atlanta, a seafood restaurant in New Orleans, and a mini-golf course in Biloxi. And those were just the ventures in this country. I know it sounds like Tony Soprano\u2019s investment portfolio, but to be fair, he had more than 100 years to diversify. Older vampires are heavily invested in human real estate, medical research, music, publishing, and media. It\u2019s what has helped maintain our cover for two millennia. It\u2019s not a conspiracy or anything, we\u2019re just trying to keep you people from setting us on fire in our sleep. If we controlled everything, do you really think the Lifetime network would have had a vampire detective show?</p><p>So Gabriel floated in and out of my world, letting me think I could handle life without him, only to show up after a few weeks and make me crazy all over again. I was frequently left to wallow and wonder where he was and what he wasn\u2019t telling me. I excelled at wallowing and wondering. If I called, it went to his voice mail. If he called, it was always just before dawn, as I was falling asleep and didn\u2019t have the mental capacity to ask him much. This combined with a painfully active imagination led to scenarios that would have done that Lifetime show very proud.</p><p>And, of course, he had to come home from his latest trip on a Tuesday night to find me wearing my \u201chousework\u201d sweats and a dirty bandanna around my head.</p><p>\u201cHave we discussed the \u2018Call first\u2019 rule?\u201d I asked when I opened the door, suppressing a giddy smile.</p> <p>Gabriel had been impossibly beautiful even in the harsh neon lights of Shenanigans that first night I met him. And now that I had sharp vampire vision, I could fully appreciate the leonine dreaminess that was my sire. There he stood, wearing his typical Johnny Cash full black, flowing dark locks curling at his collar. His full, soft lips quirked at my rude greeting, and a flicker of warmth reflected back at me in those clear, gray eyes. Despite our general resilience, he looked tired. There was the slightest hint of shadows under his eyes. And even for a vampire, he looked pretty pale.</p><p>\u201cHello, Gabriel, it\u2019s lovely to see you?\u201d he responded in a feminine voice that, frankly, sounded nothing like me. \u201cI missed you terribly. How was Nashville?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHello, Gabriel, it\u2019s lovely to see you,\u201d I parroted in an explicitly pleasant tone. \u201cHow was Nashville? Have we discussed the \u2018Call first\u2019 rule?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I come in?\u201d he asked, hefting a foam cooler with his hip. A girl couldn\u2019t help but appreciate the way those hips looked in black denim. I paused to give them the proper reverence.</p><p>I opened the door wider, then stopped him with a hand to the chest. \u201cWait. You have that \u2018We have to talk\u2019 look on your face, which usually means I\u2019m going to be accused of something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor once, no.\u201d He advanced against my palm. I held him back. He pouted. \u201cThis is getting heavy.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou have superstrength,\u201d I pointed out, grinning despite myself. \u201cWhat\u2019s in the cooler?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA present.\u201d He opened the top and proudly displayed a dozen pint-sized plastic envelopes of blood packed in dry ice.</p><p>I cocked my head and studied him thoughtfully. \u201cThe next time you go shopping for me, take Andrea.\u201d</p><p>He carried his burden into the kitchen, where he carefully stored his repellent treasures in the empty vegetable crisper.</p><p>\u201cThis is prime Red Cross\u2013grade human donation,\u201d he said. \u201cTested, screened, and cleared through a lab in the city.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s wonderful, but why did you bring it here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t I do something nice?\u201d he asked, clearly offended.</p><p>I stared at him. \u201cYou might have started with a card and maybe worked your way up to human blood.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI worry about how you eat,\u201d he said as he sifted through the pathetic contents of my fridge. \u201cI want you to drink a pint of this every day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve told you that it makes me uncomfortable when you blur that daddy/boyfriend line, right?\u201d I said. He held up half-empty bottles of Hershey\u2019s syrup and Bailey\u2019s Irish Cream. \u201cThat\u2019s just for flavor!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid that you\u2019re becoming too accustomed to drinking synthetic blood, Jane,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s only a recent development, and production could stop with the turn of the political tide. And then where will you be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn eBay, looking for remainders?\u201d I guessed.</p><p>\u201cWhat if you\u2019re too far away from a store to get a supply? What if the supply is tainted? You need to become more comfortable drinking human blood, feeding from live subjects.\u201d He hushed me when I opened my mouth to protest. \u201cI know how you feel about feeding from humans, but I want you to have the skills you need to survive. Just in case. I want you to be able to hunt on your own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, I\u2019m like a domesticated bear, and you\u2019re working up to releasing me into the wild?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, that\u2019s the worst possible way you could have taken this gesture, thank you,\u201d he muttered, setting the cooler aside.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d I finally said. \u201cI appreciate the fact that you thought of me while you were away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEvery spare moment,\u201d he promised, moving in closer for a kiss.</p><p>I stopped him. \u201cAre you sure I\u2019m not accused of something? Feeding on senior citizens? Kicking toddlers? Stealing candy from babies?\u201d</p><p>He was darkly cute when he was indignant. \u201cIt\u2019s not a bad omen every time I come to call.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d I conceded. \u201cI\u2019m being rude. To what do I owe the pleasure?\u201d</p><p>In a very serious tone, he said, \u201cI think we should have sex again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I giggled. I couldn\u2019t help it. Gabriel and I hadn\u2019t been able to \u201cdate\u201d per se. Dating a vampire is difficult, even if you are a vampire. I mean, it\u2019s not as if we can go out to dinner like a normal couple. We don\u2019t eat. On the rare occasion that we were both at one of our houses and sitting still, Zeb and Jolene or Andrea or Dick would show up, and our twosome became a group gathering. As much as I loved having a close group of diverse friends who understand my special needs, talk about a bunch of mood killers.</p><p>\u201cI think we should have sex again,\u201d he repeated. \u201cI think we\u2019ve reestablished our rapport and friendship. I believe you\u2019re starting to trust me again. I know you want me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s kind of presumptuous,\u201d I told him. He wasn\u2019t wrong, but it was still presumptuous.</p><p>Obviously irritated by my not jumping him right then and there, he added, \u201cAlso, the first time was rather rushed, and I don\u2019t feel that I was able to demonstrate my full range of, er, technique.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, you think we should have Naked Happy Fun Time because I didn\u2019t get to see all of your moves?\u201d I said, barely able to contain a second giggle fit as he backed me against the counter. \u201cYou don\u2019t just say something like that. You have to take me out for dinner or something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere.\u201d He reached into the fridge and pulled out a packet of A-negative. \u201cDrink that.\u201d</p><p>I arched an eyebrow at him. \u201cYou really don\u2019t understand the concept of modern courtship, do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDrink it,\u201d he commanded. Humoring him, I popped the top and took a long drink of the smooth, lusciously nutty donated blood. Tasting genuine human blood after months of synthetic always left me a little woozy. Little pinpricks of sensation, nerves firing along my arms and throat, made me lean heavily against the counter to get my bearings.</p><p>Gabriel took the packet from my slightly trembling hand. \u201cNow, kiss me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not a light bulb, you can\u2019t just flip a switch and turn me\u2014\u201d</p><p>Gabriel gripped my cheeks between his palms and seized my lips, the last syllables of my sentence muffled into his mouth.</p><p>\u201cI stand corrected,\u201d I admitted as we backed into the living room.</p><p>\u201cIs your aunt here?\u201d he asked, tugging at my T-shirt.</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cHot ghost date.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think\u2014gah!\u201d Distracted by the front closure on my bra, Gabriel had tripped over a footstool and knocked over a side table.</p><p>\u201cIt might be nice to have sex without breaking anything, what do you say?\u201d I asked, peeking down at him over the edge of the table. Gabriel sat up, rubbing his forehead where my old hard-bound copy of Sense and Sensibility had conked him.</p><p>\u201cHaven\u2019t you already read this a few dozen times?\u201d he asked, flipping through the pages. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have to have a literary intervention for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Jane Austen, so I\u2019m going to pretend I didn\u2019t hear you say that,\u201d I said, settling next to him and taking the book from his hands. \u201cYou can never read Jane Austen too many times. And this is one of my favorites. She manages to pull a believable happy ending out of what could have been her saddest story. She could have left the Dashwood sisters alone, having learned their lessons from their respective traits. Marianne could have been left alone and ruined by her dramatic, impetuous behavior. Elinor could have taken her quiet dignity to a maiden\u2019s grave. But she gave them the men they wanted or, in Marianne\u2019s case, needed. Austen let both of them have a little bit more than they deserved.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love it when you talk about books,\u201d he murmured against my neck. \u201cIt gets you all excited. Quick, tell me your theories about Jane Eyre and sexual repression again.\u201d</p><p>My burst of laughter was silenced by the press of Gabriel\u2019s mouth.</p><p>It\u2019s amazing how much easier it is to be naked in front of another person when you have a little self-confidence. In order to attract prey, vampires are usually more attractive than they were in life. So I got the high-school bookworm\u2019s Golden Ticket. My skin was clearer. My hair had changed to an actually desirable color found in the brunette spectrum and did what it was supposed to on occasion. My eyes, formerly an unremarkable muddy hazel, were now a clear and compelling hazel. My teeth were whiter. And my chest was in the locked and upright position forevermore. I never had to worry about sagging. If Mama would admit to my being a vampire, even she would have to concede that it seemed to agree with me.</p><p>Mama probably wouldn\u2019t have mentioned the boob thing specifically, though.</p><p>Emboldened by my newfound confidence, I jumped over the couch and pounced on Gabriel, gleefully ripping at the buttons of his shirt. He was too busy slowly peeling off my socks to object. He grinned madly at my feet.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I asked, hoping that after all of this, I hadn\u2019t accidentally fallen for a foot fetishist.</p><p>\u201cI just never know what color your toenails are going to be,\u201d he said, stroking my instep and kissing my ankle. \u201cWill it be a prim pink? A contemplative cranberry? A playful plum?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy toes are like a mood ring. Good to know. Now, I believe you were kissing my ankle in a very pleasant manner. Feel free to continue,\u201d I commanded, wiggling my freshly painted carpals.</p><p>\u201cWhat is that?\u201d he asked, staring with horror at the virulent shade of pulpy peach on my toenails.</p><p>\u201cI had to mix three different shades to find a peach that would match Jolene\u2019s bridesmaids\u2019 dresses. I did an experimental test run to see if my body would tolerate the color.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow,\u201d Gabriel mouthed silently. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cShut it,\u201d I said, tossing the remnants of his shirt into a wastebasket. He took advantage of this lapse of concentration to pull me onto his lap, wrapping my legs around his waist. I smirked down at him, tucking his hair behind his ears. \u201cHow about we try to make it to a bed this time?\u201d</p><p>Gabriel didn\u2019t answer, as his mouth was occupied, scraping his fangs gently over the curve of my breast. I loved and hated it when he did that. Loved it because he was teasing me, toying with me, reminding me of every dark pleasure he could inflict on me. Hated it because it reduced my whole world to a square inch of responsive flesh, making me forget everything\u2014pride, sense, the ability to refrain from bizarre birdcall noises. My only defense was winding my fingers through his ink-black hair, pulling his head back, and sucking on his bottom lip.</p><p>He groaned into my mouth. \u201cUnfair.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAll\u2019s fair in\u2014ummph.\u201d I grunted as he smothered my mouth with his and pushed me to my feet.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re wearing too much.\u201d His low voice vibrated across the skin of my throat. He refused to pull his lips away from my skin as he split my old 4-H camp T-shirt down the front and tossed it into the trash with his own shirt. I glared at him.</p><p>He shrugged, pulling the bandanna from my head and shaking my hair loose. \u201cAll\u2019s fair.\u201d</p><p>We were both grinning loopily as we stripped each other, tossing clothes carelessly across the room. Gabriel continued to put my sensitive nerves to good use as he stroked the line of my back with his long fingers.</p><p>I never stopped kissing him, deep, sweet, hot kisses that left me confused about where his lips started and mine ended.</p> <p>One of the drawbacks of living in a Civil War home is knowing that no matter what you do there, it\u2019s already been done before. You\u2019re never the first. Well, I\u2019m pretty sure I\u2019m the first Early to do any of those things on the \u201cgrand staircase\u201d once featured in the Half-Moon Hollow Historical Society\u2019s Spring Tour of Homes.</p><p>On an unrelated note, I was really glad I\u2019d taken those yoga classes with Andrea.</p><p>Without them, I might not have had the strength and flexibility required to balance on the stairs with my arms while Gabriel raised my hips and sank deep inside me. I threw my head back, sighing, contented. How could I have forgotten how good that was? How complete and full he made me feel? I hardly noticed that with each thrust, I landed one step closer to the top of the stairs. I arched my back, grinding down until he nudged against that sensitive little bundle of nerves. I wrapped my arms around his neck on impulse, landing hard on my back without their support. The force knocked both of us down two steps, the impact of each bump sending shockwaves through my body. Gabriel groaned, the hum of his voice against my collarbone sending me over the edge. I clenched around him, crying out as red starbursts exploded behind my eyelids.</p><p>Seeing my face as I climaxed had some strange effect on Gabriel. Moaning softly in my ear, he begged me to open my eyes. I obeyed and found him watching me, memorizing every detail of my face. I turned my face into his cradling palm and bit down on the tender skin between his thumb and forefinger with my blunter teeth. He yowled, surprised, and grinned obscenely just before he shuddered over me. We slid down the stairs one at a time as he came.</p><p>We slithered to a stop on the third step. I sighed. \u201cI missed you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what a man likes to hear,\u201d he said, pulling me onto his chest and nuzzling the curve of my throat.</p> <p>I blew out an unnecessary breath. \u201cThis is just like our first time, without all the hitting and bleeding. I know we haven\u2019t addressed this, but I totally won that fight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI admire your competitive nature and optimism, but there\u2019s no way you would have beaten me in a fair fight.\u201d</p><p>I smirked. \u201cWould it make you feel better if I went all traditional and asked what you\u2019re thinking in some soft, hesitant voice? Because right now, all I\u2019m thinking is \u2018woo,\u2019 and if I might add, \u2018hoo.\u2019 \u201c</p><p>\u201cIt saddens me that I don\u2019t know whether this is the stunning aftereffects of my technique or that you\u2019re spending more time with Dick.</p><p>\u201cSo ... what are you thinking?\u201d he asked in that faux feminine voice again, pressing little kisses along my wrist. \u201cBecause I doubt very much that \u2018woo\u2019 and \u2018hoo\u2019 is all that\u2019s going on in that massive, teeming brain of yours.\u201d</p><p>I propped my chin on his chest. \u201cDo you really want to know? Because at any given moment, when I\u2019m with you, I have about a million questions bouncing around in my head. Stuff that, frankly, I\u2019m a little ashamed I don\u2019t know about you. For instance, why don\u2019t you have an accent? You and Dick grew up together. He has a respectable drawl. But you sound as if you\u2019re from the middle of nowhere, only with a slightly stuck-up British vernacular.\u201d</p><p>He pushed my hair back from my face. \u201cWell, you know what they say, \u2018When in Rome ...\u2019 \u201c</p><p>\u201cAttempt to sound nothing like the Romans?\u201d I countered.</p> <p>\u201cNo, I was actually in Rome, and I was saying, \u2018y\u2019all,\u2019 \u201c he said. \u201cIt was hard to blend into the crowd. While I was traveling, I did my best to get rid of my accent\u2014and the use of \u2018y\u2019all.\u2019 Happy now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, there\u2019s still stuff that I don\u2019t know about you, like what was your dog\u2019s name when you were a kid? What was the first book you can remember reading? What was your favorite food before you were turned? Did you like pancakes? What\u2019s your favorite movie made after 1970? Don\u2019t say Scarface. Please don\u2019t say Scarface.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBridges of Madison County.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine, that was a lie. I enjoyed Edward Scissorhands.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally, a loner with a dangerous condition that keeps him at arm\u2019s length from most people,\u201d I teased. \u201cDon\u2019t see that at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould it have made you happier if I said Rocky?\u201d he groused. \u201cWhat\u2019s your favorite movie, oh, protector of cinematic integrity?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever is readily available and has Gerard Butler in it,\u201d I told him. \u201cExcept for P.S. I Love You. Even I have standards. Well, the incompatible movie choices cinch it. Gabriel, as a couple, I\u2019d say we\u2019re doomed.\u201d I shook my head sadly.</p><p>\u201cI hope that\u2019s not true,\u201d he said, grinning. \u201cI have long-term plans for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d I asked, and immediately cringed at the astonishment in my voice.</p><p>\u201cOf course I do,\u201d he said, his eyes narrowed. \u201cDon\u2019t you think of me when you imagine where you\u2019ll be in the next century or so? Don\u2019t I factor into your plans?\u201d</p><p>I ducked my head and concentrated on the patterns in the rug. \u201cYeah, but it\u2019s different. I\u2019ve never been a vampire without you. But you, you\u2019ve been at this for so long. You know how vampire relationships play out. I don\u2019t. And you know how to get along without me. Sometimes I wonder ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWonder what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wonder when you\u2019re going to get tired of me,\u201d I said. \u201cI mean, this can\u2019t last forever, right? For me, nothing this good lasts forever. And we don\u2019t have any sort of ... we haven\u2019t really talked about the long term ... I\u2019m going to stop talking now.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel opened his mouth to protest, then snapped it shut. After a few moments\u2019 consideration, he blurted out, \u201cIs this because I haven\u2019t said that I love you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I said, caught off guard enough to gape at him a little. \u201cAre vampires even capable of love?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJane, that hurts me,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cIt shouldn\u2019t. I honestly have no idea. I love my parents, I love Zeb. I love Aunt Jettie. But I had those emotions before I was turned. How do I know they aren\u2019t just residual echoes of what I felt when I was human? I was never in love with a man as a human. I\u2019m not sure I would recognize the feeling. I really like you. Does that help?\u201d</p><p>He made a face.</p><p>\u201cHave you ever been close to getting married?\u201d I asked. \u201cDo you want to get married?\u201d</p><p>He grinned down at me. \u201cIs that a proposal?\u201d</p><p>I ignored him. \u201cAre we even able to get married? Legally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, not yet,\u201d he said. \u201cIf a vampire was married before being turned, and the spouse is still human, the marriage is still legal and valid. It took the council nearly two years of lobbying Congress to accomplish that. We\u2019re still working on establishing after-death rights for vampires. We are technically dead, so the hard-line conservatives insist that we don\u2019t have the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. Marriage, adoption, voting\u2014\u201d</p><p>I gasped. \u201cWe can\u2019t vote?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t notice that in November? During the election?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I did, because I vote ...\u201d I protested. \u201cOK, fine, I didn\u2019t even try to vote. I forgot. I\u2019m a horrible person.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged, patting my head. \u201cWell, you had to have flaws. You don\u2019t vote or have tact or have control over most of your gross motor functions\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOK, stop that,\u201d I said, pinching his arm. \u201cAnd stop trying to get out of talking about your marriage feelings. Have you ever been close to getting married?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he said, rubbing his eyes. \u201cHer name was Mary Louise Early. Her parents were dear friends of my parents. My father wanted access to their pasture land. It was a good match.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait, so you were engaged to one of my ancestors?\u201d I scooched away from him. \u201cEw.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is why I don\u2019t tell you about my past! I\u2019m not enigmatic and secretive. I\u2019m trying to keep you from doing\u2014ow!\u201d he cried as I pinched him again. \u201cThat. We were not officially engaged at the time of my death. We were promised, that\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you sleep with her? Because that would just be weird.\u201d</p><p>He seemed insulted that I was calling his before-death self a horndog. \u201cOf course not! We were never left unchaperoned. She was wearing twelve layers of underwear at all times. And she had a laugh that made my ears bleed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmmph.\u201d I snorted.</p><p>Awkward silence.</p><p>\u201cSo how was Nashville?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cThe new manager is an idiot,\u201d Gabriel said of the radio station employee he\u2019d traveled to Tennessee to \u201cmeet\u201d (translation: yell at in a scary vampire voice). \u201cHe\u2019s a fan of Jethro Tull and wants to change the format to soft rock. I\u2019m either going to fire him or make him believe he\u2019s a nine-year-old Girl Scout.\u201d He stroked my hair back from my face. \u201cHow\u2019s the wedding planning going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to talk about it.\u201d I groaned.</p><p>\u201cThe dress is that bad?\u201d he asked. He was trying to look sympathetic, but vampire fangs tend to give away hidden smiles. \u201cWell, if it makes you feel any better, at least you don\u2019t have to go to the bachelor party. Zeb said Dick has made arrangements for us to visit the Booby Hatch on \u2018Amateur Night.\u2019 \u201c Gabriel grimaced at using the word \u201cbooby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re telling your girlfriend that you\u2019re going to a strip club,\u201d I said, narrowing my eyes at him.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you know what happens at strip clubs?\u201d I asked.</p><p>He laughed. \u201cI\u2019m sure it will be fine. We\u2019ll have a few drinks, get him something to eat, and get him home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou honestly don\u2019t understand how strip clubs work, do you?\u201d</p><p>Gabriel snorted. \u201cSo, how is Zeb\u2019s wedding driving you into the abyss of madness?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the whole thing,\u201d I grumbled. \u201cIt\u2019s not that I don\u2019t like Jolene. In fact, I\u2019m pretty sure I like her much more than I would have liked anyone else who married Zeb. With the exception of her constantly eating in front of me, I like everything about her. She\u2019s nice and funny and obviously loves my friend. It\u2019s just that\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe drives you crazy,\u201d he offered.</p><p>\u201cA tiny bit.\u201d I sighed.</p><p>\u201cI think that you\u2019ve gotten used to being the female influence in Zeb\u2019s life,\u201d Gabriel said, squeezing me. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing wrong with it. I think the friendship between you two is a beautiful thing. But he understood when you began spending time with me, and he\u2019s made it easy for me to become a part of your life. I would be very disappointed in you if you weren\u2019t able to do the same for him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. I will take the mature route. Even if you have to check me into some sort of vampire mental institution immediately after the reception.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJane?\u201d he said, winding his arms and legs around me.</p><p>\u201cLetting it go.\u201d I nodded, playing with the curling ends of his hair. \u201cNow that I have your attention, I think we should test that vampire endurance I hear so much about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo think you were this innocent little librarian when I met you.\u201d Gabriel heaved a mock sigh. \u201cI\u2019ve created a monster.\u201d</p><p>I grinned, my fangs extending over my lips. \u201cIn more ways than one.\u201d</p><p>Well, I finally got my revenge for all those times I\u2019d walked in on Fred and Jettie. She came home to find me sprawled on the couch wearing nothing but Gabriel\u2019s shirt, sitting in a very naked man\u2019s lap.</p><p>I\u2019d always been disappointed that River Oaks doesn\u2019t have a great ghost story attached to it. Of course, now it does. Aunt Jettie. Jettie was my own personal daytime security system. She woke me up when someone, such as grabby family antique enthusiasts Grandma Ruthie and Jenny, tried to get into the house. She also chased away door-to-door salesmen, meter readers, and evangelists with vague unease and spooky noises. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Unless you have some sort of psychic ability, ghosts decide when they want you to see them. Which is good, because I don\u2019t think I\u2019d want to walk around seeing dead people on every corner. Just when Jettie had decided to let Gabriel see her, she was seeing a whole lot of him. Ever poised, he wrapped an afghan around his waist and held a perfectly civil conversation with her. The utter mortification forced me to block most of it from memory. I know she brought up the phrase \u201csteam cleaning\u201d a lot.</p><p>Gabriel promised to call and made himself scarce. There was practically a Gabriel-shaped hole in the door.</p><p>\u201cWhere have you been?\u201d I asked her, hands on bare hips. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen you for four days. And then you just waltz in without so much as a how do you do? Am I going to have to ground you to get you to spend time with me? It\u2019s that boy you\u2019ve been seeing, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to talk about it,\u201d Jettie huffed. \u201cYour grandpa Fred is becoming an ass in his post-old age. We spent the last three days fighting. Do you know how difficult it is to win a conversation with a man who no longer fears death?\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cAs a matter of fact, yes, I do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf we\u2019re going to talk about boys, can we discuss the fact that Gabriel only wears pants on every other visit here?\u201d Jettie asked.</p><p>\u201cNo. Instead, I will change the subject and announce to you that there is a new potential addition to Half-Moon Hollow\u2019s ghostly population. Grandpa Bob died on Tuesday. Grandma Ruthie said there was some sort of medication mix-up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe hell there was.\u201d Jettie cackled. \u201cFred says it\u2019s all over the golf course. Bob Jessup died because he couldn\u2019t quite make out the dosage on his \u2018little blue tablets,\u2019 and he took too many. Apparently, it was their anniversary, and Bob wanted to rise to the occasion.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh ... oh, just, oh.\u201d I shuddered, clapping my hand over my lips. \u201cI think I just threw up a little in my mouth. Is Bob still wandering around out there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no, he\u2019s moved on. He just made a quick stop at his son\u2019s house to say good-bye. He happened to run into Sago Raines, who\u2019s been haunting the place for years. They talked for a bit before he went into the light. Sago was down at the golf course spreading the news faster than you can say \u2018erectile dysfunction.\u2019 \u201c</p><p>\u201cLalalalalalala.\u201d I sang, pressing my hands over my ears, but even that couldn\u2019t keep me from hearing her.</p><p>\u201cI just wish I could get to Ruthie long enough to tell her every dead soul in the Hollow knows her dearly departed had to have pharmaceutical help to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cEnough!\u201d I cried. \u201cFirst, you and Grandpa Fred, and now\u2014just enough. I\u2019d pierce my own eardrums, but they would just grow back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgeist.\u201d Jettie sneered.</p> <p>\u201cExhibitionist,\u201d I retorted.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think you can afford to throw any naked stones here, pumpkin.\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cTouch\u00e9.\u201d</p><p>4</p><p>Because of the lifelong mating urge, werewolves do not adjust well to being widowed. In some cases, a surviving mate will die of mourning pains.</p><p>\u2014Mating Rituals and Love Customs of the Were</p><p>Perhaps sensing that Bob\u2019s could be her last grand-dame funeral, Grandma Ruthie wanted to bury Bob in style. NATO summits were less tense than the planning of this shindig. Bob\u2019s adult children claimed that Bob, an avid fisherman, wanted to be cremated with half of his ashes spread into Lake Barkley and the other half interred with his late first wife. Grandma Ruthie, incensed that she might be upstaged, insisted that Bob\u2019s intact remains be buried adjacent to her \u201ccompound\u201d of husbandly burial plots down at Oak View Cemetery. She made such a scene at the funeral home that Bob\u2019s shell-shocked offspring let her have her way, plus total control of the funeral program from the \u201cAmazing Grace\u201d opener to the \u201cIt Is Well with My Soul/Old Rugged Cross\u201d closing medley.</p><p>There was only one place to host this weird-ass parody of grief: Whitlow\u2019s Funeral Home, where Grandma Ruthie had been mourning husbands since 1957. In fact, three generations of Whitlows had helped Grandma Ruthie bury her spouses. And apparently, none of them knew anything about decorating. Honestly, who finds dark wood paneling, blue velvet upholstery, and 3-D pictures of Jesus comforting?</p> <p>With her \u201cfrequent flyer\u201d status, Grandma Ruthie was treated like a queen from the moment she walked in the door. She never settled for the rattling Coke machine and sprung couch in the sadly worn family lounge. When the stress of public mourning became too much to bear, Grandma Ruthie retreated to the senior Mr. Whitlow\u2019s private office, where he stocked her favorite brand of butter cookies and an ample supply of bottled sweet tea. Membership has its privileges.</p><p>Visitations were held on the evening before the burial, giving the community the chance to offer condolences to the bereaved and give their real opinion of the deceased outside the bereaved\u2019s earshot. Grandma Ruthie was ensconced in the front row of the chapel, sending petulant looks at Bob\u2019s children. She was still pouting over their last-minute refusal to let her take over the memorial video or the photo board. Somehow, they seemed insulted that Grandma wanted to focus on the last five years of Bob\u2019s life, omitting his first marriage to their late mother and the existence of his children and grandchildren. She did get her vengeance by making a memorial Wheel of Fortune puzzle board spelling out \u201cRuthie Loves Bob\u201d and putting it in the lid of his casket. Bob was a huge Wheel fan.</p><p>Based on the craftsmanship, I suspected my sister, Jenny, had a hand in this.</p><p>Grandma Ruthie simply did not understand why she was not being given the authority and respect due a widow. She claimed to have given Bob some of the happiest years of his life. The fact that Bob had been unconscious or hospitalized for most of that time seemed irrelevant.</p><p>Grandma Ruthie, and Jenny, for that matter, were a little miffed at Mama for her resolve that I be involved in the funeral. I would have been touched by Mama\u2019s insistence on my having the opportunity to mourn Bob, but I\u2019m pretty sure she just wanted help policing the buffet at the visitation. I didn\u2019t eat, after all, so I wouldn\u2019t mind keeping the platters full. The main problem was that Grandma insisted on using her good silver serving pieces (from Wedding No. 2), which were mixed in with stainless-steel pieces from the funeral home. You\u2019d think by now I\u2019d be able to sniff out metal that causes me to burn and itch, but every time I moved a utensil, it was like Russian roulette. So I stuck with plates.</p><p>It is an unwritten law that a person could not be decently buried in the Hollow without the presence of deviled eggs and some form of homemade pimento cheese. My cousin Junie\u2019s hot-dog bake is also usually present. It\u2019s essentially diced hot dogs, Tater Tots, processed cheese food, and cream of mushroom soup baked until crusty. Still, it\u2019s preferable to homemade pimento cheese.</p><p>Of course, for humans, nourishment is needed to sustain them through the gauntlet of social interactions. If you met anyone in the deceased\u2019s family once, you are expected to bring a casserole for the bereaved and spend at least twenty-five minutes at the visitation. This meant that if I wanted to cross the room, I was going to have to talk to every person I had ever met in my entire life. And I had no idea how many of them might be packing stakes.</p><p>Not everybody in Half-Moon Hollow knew I\u2019d been turned, but many of those who did looked at me with a combination of fear and revulsion. I\u2019ll admit that I spent much of my living time being annoyed at my human community, but being separated from them now was lonely and isolating. The only place I felt safe was at River Oaks, and then a group of high-school kids wrapped my entire porch in hanks of dried garlic. It was an incredibly lame and yet surprisingly effective way to make me afraid in my own home.</p><p>For this reason and so many more, I specifically asked Gabriel not to attend the funeral. I did not feel this was the appropriate occasion to introduce him to my family. When he asked which occasion would be appropriate and I stayed stonily silent, I think it hurt his feelings.</p><p>I could see now that I might have been better off with my sire nearby. After a few training sessions spent trying to hone my mind-reading talents, Gabriel and I determined that it only worked on humans. Most humans ... some humans. Sometimes. It was pretty inconsistent. Still, after finding out how many people secretly disliked me inside their heads, not being able to see inside my fellow vampires\u2019 was kind of a comfort.</p><p>According to the swarms of thoughts and scents pecking at my cortex, some of those attending the funeral knew I was a vampire, but they were nice enough not to mention it. Or at least to mention it quietly behind their hands in a way that was not noticed by the other mourners. Such is the delicate social web of a small Southern town. I knew that they knew. My family knew that some of them knew. They knew I knew that they knew. But none of us said anything, because that would cause unpleasantness. And we are nothing if not pleasant ... when other people are watching.</p><p>Zeb and Jolene were lurking among the crowd, earning attendance points for Zeb and his family but avoiding actual contact with anybody. Lucky bastard. Jolene did, however, bring a huge sandwich platter and a gallon of macaroni salad from her uncle\u2019s shop, the Three Little Pigs. I was ninety-nine-percent sure that meant Grandma Ruthie now liked her better than me. Mama Ginger was hovering over the mini-quiches and glowering in Jolene\u2019s general direction.</p><p>Fortunately, Mama Ginger had been \u201ctoo ill\u201d since Zeb\u2019s announcement to contribute anything to the funeral buffet\u2014everything she made tasted like blue cheese and glue. You\u2019d think she\u2019d be thrilled that her son was marrying a good girl with a local family, who wouldn\u2019t ask her son to move far from hearth and home. Plus, with her flashing lupine eyes and auburn hair, Jolene was beautiful in that fierce \u201csome people walk in the light\u201d way that just seems unfair to those of us whose genes aligned in a less spectacular fashion. Instead, Zeb said that upon hearing his engagement announcement, Mama Ginger accused him of letting \u201clittle Zeb\u201d do all of his thinking for him. Floyd had nodded in agreement, but it was in more of an envious, congratulatory way.</p><p>Much like the iceberg that doomed the \u201cunsinkable\u201d ship, the visible workings of the Lavelle-McClaine wedding plans were only the tiniest glimpse of passive-aggressive maneuverings below the surface. Being truly disliked for the first time in her life sent Jolene into some sort of prolonged panic state, where she did almost anything to try to get Mama Ginger to like her. This, of course, just irritated the hell out of Mama Ginger. She would not bond with Jolene. She simply refused to, just as she\u2019d refused to shop for mother-of-the-bride dresses with the clingy bride. She would not meet Jolene for lunch to discuss floral arrangements or seating charts. She faked a gluten allergy to get out of tasting the wedding cake.</p><p>I hadn\u2019t seen Mama Ginger since I\u2019d started keeping night hours. Henna-haired and built like a neurotic fire hydrant, Zeb\u2019s mother was wearing her \u201cburying dress\u201d of clingy black Lycra, Bedazzled with intricate patterns of tiny gold-tone studs and rhinestones. There was a matching hat, but Mama Ginger wouldn\u2019t dare cover her colored, curled, and coiled coiffure, which, as a hairdresser, she considered her own best advertisement. Mama Ginger, who never left the house without full pancake makeup and eyeliner, usually ambushed me with one of the fifteen nubbed lipsticks she kept in the bottom of her purse to \u201cgive me a little color.\u201d</p><p>Eager to avoid a scene in which I would be left with a linty coat of Risqu\u00e9 Red, I backed away. The movement caught Mama Ginger\u2019s attention, and before I knew it, I\u2019d made inadvertent eye contact. Bah!</p><p>\u201cJane!\u201d Mama Ginger squealed. \u201cOh, honey, come on over here and give me some sugar!\u201d</p><p>Across the room, Zeb\u2019s eyes widened as Mama Ginger enveloped me in a hug that would usually have left me smelling of Jean Nat\u00e9 and Virginia Slims, except this time, the scent of lady-grade tobacco was dramatically understated. Zeb shot me an apologetic look and then turned his back and busied himself with some punch.</p><p>Coward.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so skinny! You need to get over there and eat something. I worry about you, poor single girl, always on some crazy diet. You need someone to cook for, honey. That will put some meat on your bones.\u201d Mama Ginger mercilessly squeezed my cheeks with her carefully painted acrylic nails. \u201cNow, how are you, baby doll? Tell me every little thing!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine. Mama Ginger, did you quit smoking?\u201d I asked, sniffing her again.</p><p>\u201cYes, I did!\u201d she cried. \u201cHow did you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm ...\u201d Don\u2019t say smell. Don\u2019t say smell. I spotted a pack of nicotine gum in her purse and nodded to it.</p><p>Mama Ginger giggled. \u201cYou\u2019ll never believe this, but I went to that Madame Zelda over on Gaines Street.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe \u2018mesmerist/tarot reader\u2019 who offers palm readings for five dollars from her den?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the one. She does a special course of \u2018Smoke-Free Sessions.\u2019 It\u2019s five hypnosis sessions for two hundred and fifty dollars. Pricey, but it\u2019s done the trick.\u201d</p><p>Mama Ginger had left at least two packs of Revlon-stained cigarette butts in her wake every day since I\u2019d known her. In fact, she once lit up in the middle of her annual physical, right after her doctor told her that she was at risk for seven kinds of cancer. People take bad news in different ways.</p><p>I could only guess that the faint cigarette smell still lingering on Mama Ginger was nicotine that had seeped into her DNA.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m chewing this silly gum.\u201d She sighed, rolling up her sleeve to show me a nicotine patch on her arm. \u201cAnd I only smoke after meals, but really, I\u2019m feeling much better. I can walk all the way to the mailbox without a break.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I would be concerned, but honestly, the combination of occasional smoking, chewing, and, uh, patching probably equaled the amount of nicotine in Mama Ginger\u2019s system when she was smoking full-time.</p><p>\u201cI never thought I\u2019d quit, never wanted to,\u201d Mama Ginger said, ignoring common sense in her usual selective fashion. \u201cBut Mamaw Lavelle\u2019s doctor put her on an oxygen tank, and she screams that I\u2019m trying to kill her if I light up anywhere near her. Hell, if I was going to kill the woman, I would have switched her heart pills for baby aspirin ten years ago.\u201d</p><p>I goggled at her. She blushed and gave a tinkling laugh. \u201cZeb says you have a new job. How do you like it?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFine ... Not that I\u2019m not glad to see you, Mama Ginger, but I thought you were mad at me ...\u201d I looked in the direction of Hannah Jo, her favorite client and preferred daughter-in-law candidate, who was sulking in the corner with a plate of deviled eggs.</p><p>\u201cOh, Janie!\u201d She smiled indulgently at me, fluffing my hair. \u201cYou know I could never stay mad at you, even though you did hurt my feelings. You\u2019re my little angel muffin.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019d forgotten about the nicknames. How could I have forgotten the nicknames?</p><p>\u201cBesides, I don\u2019t spend much time with Hannah Jo anymore, because ... I didn\u2019t know\u201d\u2014Mama Ginger lowered her voice\u2014\u201dthat she has a shoplifting problem. Every time we went to the flea market, she walked out with packages of socks under her jacket. Besides, do you know she has cut off her mama? Doesn\u2019t even talk to her anymore. Doesn\u2019t see her at Christmas or Mother\u2019s Day or send her birthday cards. Can you imagine, someone having such a hard heart that they cut off their mama?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow.\u201d I cringed as realization dawned. \u201cSo I guess that means you don\u2019t want her to marry Zeb anymore.\u201d</p> <p>Mama Ginger sighed. \u201cNo, I only wanted Hannah Jo to get to know Zeb because she\u2019s so lonely, and I thought since Zeb\u2019s such a good friend to you, he could be a good friend to her, too. My boy is so generous and sweet and kind. He\u2019d have to be to take up with that one.\u201d Mama Ginger shot a glare in Jolene\u2019s direction.</p><p>\u201cJolene\u2019s a very nice girl,\u201d I said. \u201cShe\u2019s very good to Zeb. He loves her very much. I just said \u2018very\u2019 three times, didn\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sweet to say nice things about someone who\u2019s taken what\u2019s rightfully yours.\u201d Mama Ginger pinched my cheeks again. \u201cBut it don\u2019t matter how perky their ass is, no one\u2019s gonna take your place in Zeb\u2019s heart. You\u2019re always going to be his first.\u201d</p><p>Ignoring the ass comment, I asked, \u201cHis first?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLove, silly, you\u2019re his first love. No one forgets his first love.\u201d</p><p>I had a vague vertigo sensation as Mama Ginger\u2019s maternal crosshairs focused on me again.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll see you later, Mama Ginger. I need to get back to ... I gotta go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll talk soon, baby doll,\u201d she called as I pivoted on my heel, made a grab for an empty iced-tea pitcher, and focused on the main stage, the front pew.</p><p>Grandma was resplendent in her traditional Casual Corner Petites black dress suit, but she had stepped up her game with a black picture hat and full veil. Long ago, she had figured out a secret combination of waterproof mascara and eyeliner that gave her a full Elizabeth Taylor lash that never ran. A black lace handkerchief was clutched to her lips as she stifled a sob.</p><p>Where do you even buy a black lace handkerchief? Widows R Us?</p><p>If she was this duded up for the visitation, I deeply regretted that I wouldn\u2019t get to see her burial ensemble.</p><p>As amusing as this was, the whole funeral process had put me in a bit of a philosophical funk. Despite Jenny\u2019s \u201coffer\u201d to give me a proper burial, there was very little chance that I would ever have a funeral. If by some chance (involving sunlight, stakes, or silver) I did die, the only remains left would be a little pile of dust. Unless someone was quick with the whisk broom, there would be nothing to put in a casket or urn. There would be no buffet, no packed chapel, and, unless Reverend Neel was feeling very charitable, no one praying over me. It was far more likely that I would watch all of my friends and family die. I would watch Zeb grow old and die. I would watch his children grow old and die. Nothing would change. Nothing would surprise me.</p><p>These dark, admittedly self-indulgent and depressing thoughts were not really putting me in the best frame of mind to deal with my grandma, who at the moment was sniffling into the black hankie and looking on old friends with baleful, glittering eyes.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be fine,\u201d she whimpered. \u201cAs long as I have friends and family around me, I\u2019ll be fine.\u201d She looked up and saw me standing nearby. \u201cJane, those coffee cups need washing.\u201d</p> <p>Those were the first words she\u2019d spoken to me since she found out that I\u2019d been turned. And they were completely consistent with our BD (before death) relationship.</p><p>I thought back to the chapter in Sense and Sensibility when Mr. Dashwood has just died. Marianne and Mrs. Dashwood are overcome by grief. They gave themselves up wholly to their sorrow, seeking increase of wretchedness in every reflection that could afford it, and resolved against ever admitting consolation in the future. This leaves Elinor to deal with their grasping relatives. Elinor isn\u2019t given the chance to grieve because she\u2019s able to handle all of the grunt work.</p><p>I was definitely an Elinor, minus the quiet dignity ... or the sense. But I was dependable, overly analytical, and unable to shirk excessive responsibilities. So I gathered the coffee cups and bit my tongue.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll just take them into the kitchen,\u201d I muttered. \u201cAnd join the other scullery maids.\u201d</p><p>I hefted the tray with one hand and nearly ran smack into my high-school crush, Adam Morrow, a blond, dimpled, and ridiculously clean-cut veterinarian.</p><p>\u201cA-Adam!\u201d I stuttered. \u201cHi!\u201d</p><p>At least one thing had remained constant since my living days: I still couldn\u2019t find anything to say to Adam Morrow. While contemplating the back of his neck in sophomore English, I had daydreams where Adam suddenly realized how luminously beautiful I was, inside and out. He would finally realize that I was more than the brainy gal jocks wanted to be paired with on group projects. He\u2019d ask me where I\u2019d been all his life. There was also an imagined prom-night scenario that I won\u2019t go into. And now, all I could do was gawk at him and keep a death grip on a tray of dirty coffee cups.</p><p>\u201cHi, Jane,\u201d he said, smiling broadly. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to see you again. It\u2019s been a while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d I blurted. Woo-hoo, a full, unstuttered sentence!</p><p>Adam was carrying a carefully Tupperwared seven-layer salad, though how anything involving hard-boiled eggs, bacon, mayonnaise, and sugar could be considered salad, I have no idea. \u201cMama sent me over with this. She had dental surgery this afternoon, and she\u2019s still laid up on the pain pills. She\u2019s sorry she couldn\u2019t make it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was very thoughtful,\u201d I said, accepting the bowl with my free hand. \u201cAnd heavy. How much bacon is in this thing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust enough.\u201d He laughed, bottomless cerulean eyes twinkling. \u201cWhat about you? Are you doing something different with your hair?\u201d he asked, staring at me closely. \u201cBecause you look different. Great but different.\u201d</p><p>He was staring at me again, as if I were a puzzle he was trying to solve. Apparently, word hadn\u2019t gotten around to Adam about my undead status. So, for reasons I didn\u2019t quite fathom yet, I lied through my pointy teeth.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been working out,\u201d I told him, smiling brightly. His interest seemed to perk up even further at the display of teeth. \u201cWhat have you been up to? How\u2019s the clinic?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged those wide shoulders. \u201cOh, you know, patients who bite me and pee on themselves. It\u2019s a living. How about you?\u201d</p><p>I grimaced. \u201cWell, I\u2019m sure you heard that I\u2019m no longer working at the library.\u201d</p><p>His cheerfully blank face gave me the impression that he was too polite to acknowledge that I was being gossiped about behind my back. I continued, \u201cI\u2019m actually working at a bookstore over on Braxton Avenue now. I really like my new boss. I\u2019ve never really done retail before, but I get to work around books again, so it\u2019s great. I\u2019ve sort of moved on to another phase of my life. A phase that does not include Story Time and sock puppets.\u201d</p><p>Adam chuckled, winking his dimples at me. \u201cYou should keep your options open. You never know what might come up.\u201d</p><p>Like a bullet wound and an old guy willing to gnaw on my neck to save my life. That was a surprise. At the thought of Gabriel, I felt a little twinge of guilt. It felt very wrong to do anything even remotely resembling flirting. And even worse when Adam blurted, \u201cIt\u2019s been\u2014I\u2014I\u2019d like to\u2014would you like to meet up for coffee sometime?\u201d</p><p>Well, there went a bigger twinge.</p><p>I did a bit of a double-take, sure I\u2019d heard him wrong. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, could you repeat what you just said?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCoffee.\u201d He laughed. \u201cWould you like to have a cup of coffee sometime? Catch up, talk about old times, share embarrassing memories, that sort of thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean like when I used to follow you around at middle-school dances, trying to work up the nerve to ask you to slow dance to \u2018End of the Road\u2019? Oh, crap. That was out loud. I have to stop doing that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry.\u201d Adam laughed. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of flattering.\u201d</p><p>I laughed, too, but more as a defense mechanism than out of actual amusement.</p><p>\u201cSo, coffee?\u201d Adam asked pointedly. \u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>There it was, everything I\u2019d wanted as a human laid out on a platter before me. If you\u2019d asked me when I was a teenager, \u201cWhat would fulfill every romantic hope and dream in your obsessive adolescent heart?\u201d Adam Morrow asking me out would do it. As much as I\u2019d tried to embrace my vampire lifestyle, it was difficult to let that go. It actually pained me when I had to say, \u201cI appreciate the offer, but I\u2019m seeing someone.\u201d</p><p>Adam clearly wasn\u2019t used to being turned down. It took him just as long to process the fact that I\u2019d said no as it did for me to realize that him asking me out wasn\u2019t an auditory hallucination.</p><p>He finally said, \u201cWell, you can\u2019t blame a guy for trying. I\u2019ll see you around, Jane.\u201d</p><p>After watching a deflated Adam making his way through the funeral crowd, I busied myself gathering dirty plates and forks. I\u2019d made it halfway to the kitchen when a sharp poke to my side made me squeal and fling cutlery. Panic and my vampire reflexes had me plucking the falling pieces out of the air.</p><p>\u201cFast hands,\u201d said my uncle Junior, the one who finds sneaking up behind me and startling me the height of hilarity.</p><p>\u201cThat just gets funnier and funnier every time you do it,\u201d I retorted, poking through his paunch at his ribs.</p><p>\u201cAw, honey, he doesn\u2019t know any better,\u201d Uncle Paul said, shaking his head. \u201cMama dropped him a lot when he was baby.\u201d</p><p>Paul and Junior were Dad\u2019s brothers. I liked both of them, but when I was growing up, they were always so busy with their big, strapping sons, Dwight and Oscar. And they actually managed to move a whopping forty-five minutes away from Half-Moon Hollow, so I didn\u2019t see them except around holidays.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s my shortcake?\u201d Uncle Paul asked.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re seven feet tall, everyone\u2019s shorter than you,\u201d I said, kissing his cheek and following our usual \u201ccomedy\u201d routine. \u201cJust wait until old age catches up with you, we\u2019ll see who laughs last.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour mama told us you\u2019ve had some health problems,\u201d said Uncle Junior, who hugged me hard enough to crack mortal ribs.</p><p>\u201cI guess you could call it that,\u201d I said, suspicious thoughts beginning to churn in my brain.</p><p>\u201cThose deer ticks are everywhere,\u201d Paul said, clucking and shaking his head. \u201cThat\u2019s why I duct-tape my pants legs around my socks when I go turkey hunting.\u201d</p><p>Had I accidentally walked into a French film? It was as if they were having a totally different conversation. \u201cYeah ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut there are treatments nowadays, aren\u2019t there?\u201d Junior asked. \u201cIt\u2019s not supposed to affect your life span or anything, is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, quite the opposite,\u201d I muttered.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s great, sweetie,\u201d he said, chucking me under the chin. \u201cI\u2019d hate to think of my niece keeling over from Lyme disease.\u201d</p><p>Lyme disease?</p><p>\u201cLyme disease?\u201d I thought it bore repeating outside my head.</p><p>\u201cYou just let us know if you need anything,\u201d Uncle Junior said. \u201cIf those doctors don\u2019t treat you right, we\u2019ll kick their asses.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know, most of our conversations end that way,\u201d I noted.</p><p>\u201cAnd we always mean it,\u201d Uncle Paul assured me. \u201cNow we\u2019re going to say hi to your grandma and then give your dad a hard time.\u201d</p><p>I turned and zeroed in on a woman simultaneously serving coffee and simpering. Mama. \u201cI\u2019ll see y\u2019all later.\u201d</p><p>I stormed as quietly and subtly as possible across the room. Daddy saw \u201cthat\u201d look on my face, caught my arm, and pulled me to a quiet corner. \u201cHoney, whatever you\u2019re about to say to your mama, I\u2019m sure she deserves it, but this is a funeral. Bob\u2019s family, at least, deserves our respect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDaddy, as the only sane member of my family, I love you and respect your opinion. That\u2019s why I\u2019m going to address the situation quietly and calmly in a nice private corner, where I will not make a scene ...\u201d The eerily calm tone got Daddy to release my arm before he heard me say, \u201cWhile I slowly choke the breath from her body.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>By the time he called, \u201cJane!\u201d in a warning tone, I had already grabbed Mama from a gaggle of tutting church ladies and dragged her into an alcove. \u201cLyme disease, Mama? Really?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Mama asked, the picture of innocence.</p><p>\u201cYou told the uncles I have Lyme disease!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI told them you\u2019d had some health issues,\u201d she spluttered. \u201cThey just assumed it was Lyme disease.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one assumes you have Lyme disease,\u201d I whispered. \u201cHow do you just assume Lyme disease? I know this hasn\u2019t been easy for you, Mama. I know you\u2019re embarrassed that I\u2019m different. I know it took you months to work up the nerve to be around me without being afraid or ashamed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not ashamed of you,\u201d Mama insisted. \u201cIt\u2019s just that everyone makes these assumptions about me and your daddy. I know it\u2019s not true, but it\u2019s so difficult knowing that people are looking at me and judging and whispering.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it\u2019s not even like this makes me the most scandalous member of the family. I\u2019m bothered by the fact that Junie manages to pick up singles without using her hands while she performs at the Booby Hatch. But do I say anything? No.\u201d</p><p>It was at that moment that I realized that we were standing next to a podium. A podium with a mic on it. A mic that was on.</p> <p>Crap.</p><p>We turned to find most of the bereaved watching us, horrified. And my cousin Junie didn\u2019t look thrilled with me, either.</p><p>5</p><p>Hostility toward human males marrying into were clans is to be expected and taken seriously. Potential sons-in-law may want to carry wolfsbane or silver items in their pockets. Weres find both substances to be extremely irritating.</p><p>\u2014Mating Rituals and Love Customs of the Were</p><p>Despite Bob\u2019s being laid to rest on a cloudy day, I elected not to go to his burial. I thought it might build strange expectations for Mama. Aunt Jettie, who relished her role as my go-to daytime spy, reported that Bob\u2019s burial was much more entertaining than his visitation.</p> <p>Grandma Ruthie had gone from grieving widow to seeing herself as some sort of postmodern, postmenopausal Juliet. She wore an even bigger veiled hat to the cemetery and a black crepe dress with a full, flowing skirt and trailing sleeves. I\u2019m thinking she bought it from the Gone with the Wind Widows Collection. She wailed and screeched her way through the eulogy, screamed, \u201cWhy, Lord? Why?\u201d through the final blessing, and tried to snatch Bob\u2019s service flag away from his son when it was presented by the honor guard. Also, she demanded front-row center seats for her and her male companion, Wilbur.</p><p>That\u2019s right. My grandma brought a date to her fianc\u00e9\u2019s burial. She\u2019s all class, that lady. Apparently, she\u2019d met Wilbur at Whitlow\u2019s as he was heading into an old Army buddy\u2019s visitation. Sparks flew, time stood still, and Grandma Ruthie snagged another victim. On the upside, I think Wilbur\u2019s presence may have been the only thing that kept her from flinging herself into the grave on top of the casket.</p><p>But somehow, my outing cousin Junie as a day-shift dancer at the Booby Hatch made me an embarrassment to the family. At the burial, Grandma had declared that she wouldn\u2019t speak to me until I\u2019d apologized to Junie. I would think this odd considering that Junie was a cousin on my dad\u2019s side of the family and Ruthie was my maternal grandmother. But Grandma Ruthie liked ninety-nine percent of the general population better than me, so why not cousins on the other side of the family?</p><p>During my shift that night, Aunt Jettie came into the shop to give me all of the details of the cemetery theatrics. She was in the middle of reenacting this declaration when a little woman in a double-knit pant suit came into the shop to claim a phone order. Aunt Jettie made herself scarce.</p><p>On the phone, Esther Barnes\u2019s voice had sounded deep and accented. In person, she was squat, with dyed jet-black hair, deep wrinkles at the edges of her eyes, and a smoky topaz cocktail ring the size of a door knocker. Her voice was reedy and thin as she asked whether I had the \u201cBarnes order\u201d ready yet. I pulled her reserved copies of Mind over Matter: Maintaining Your Psychic Ability and The Search for the Inner Id from under the counter and rang them up.</p><p>There was something off about Esther Barnes. Her eyes were too bright, too sharp. Her mouth was small, thin, pinched into a coral-painted, birdlike moue. From the way her gaze was sweeping across the shop, I would guess she was calculating the value of every item in the store.</p><p>\u201cAre you new in town, Ms. Barnes?\u201d I asked, my tone light and friendly, even as I watched her weigh a brittle amethyst ceremonial blade with her even more fragile-looking hands.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She put the blade down, slapped her money on the counter, and stared at me. I would guess this stare had put many a shopgirl in her place over the years. But, well, I was bored, and she was there.</p> <p>I smiled pleasantly. \u201cHave family around here?\u201d</p><p>Her eyes narrowed as what little politeness she offered drained out of her voice. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>I held up a newly printed Specialty Books brochure. \u201cWould you like to be put on our mailing list?\u201d</p><p>OK, at this point, I was just trying to be annoying.</p><p>Ms. Barnes narrowed her eyes at me. There was a buzzing sensation, like being slapped under the forehead.</p><p>Ow.</p><p>It was as if someone let loose a hive full of bees in my head, little stings and pricks on the edge of my brain. I gripped the counter as the room spun out of focus. My head dipped as if I were just a bit tipsy, then snapped back into place as I fought for focus. Annoyed, I closed my eyes and built up a wall around my mind. I focused on the little woman in front of me and attempted to slap back, but it was like grabbing at sand. I couldn\u2019t get a grip. The edges of her consciousness kept slipping through my fingers. I did well just to maintain control of my own psychic defenses and not pass out at her feet.</p><p>Exhausted by what was really just a moment\u2019s effort, I opened my eyes to find a smug smile stretched across Ms. Barnes\u2019s face. \u201cBetter luck next time, dear.\u201d</p><p>Did I just get psychically pimp-slapped by a little old lady?</p><p>After she sauntered out of the shop, I hustled back to the stacks and grabbed a copy of Mind over Matter: Maintaining Your Psychic Ability. \u201cWhat the hell is in this book?\u201d</p><p>I checked Mr. Wainwright\u2019s \u201crecords\u201d for Ms. Barnes\u2019s contact information. And by records, I mean the stack of scrap paper he kept in the back of the cash-register drawer with scribbled customer names and addresses. She was nowhere to be found, which was not a surprise. He did, however, have the address for a man who lived in Possum Trot and called himself Nostradamus, which made a certain amount of sense.</p><p>I opened Mind over Matter and scanned a few pages, trying to find the section on how to use one\u2019s mental talents to smack people around. Nothing. Esther Barnes was clearly playing a deck stacked with a few extra cards. How do you guard against someone who can reach into your skull and scramble stuff around?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to have to make a tin-foil hat,\u201d I muttered as the phone rang.</p><p>It was then that I realized how wrong I was to think that being brain-assaulted was going to be the worst part of my day. It was my mother, calling to remind me that the annual Jameson family tree-trimming party was coming up that weekend and that I needed to wear my Frosty the Snowman sweater for the family Christmas-card picture. Mama always artfully arranged our \u201ccandid\u201d family tree-trimming picture one week after Thanksgiving, so she was able to send the Christmas cards out by December 14, one week before her arch-enemy and best friend, Carol Ann Reilly.</p><p>\u201cUm, I don\u2019t think Jenny and Grandma would be very happy about seeing me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut y\u2019all got along so well at the visitation!\u201d Mama cried.</p><p>\u201cBeing glad that someone will wash dishes and being happy that they were present are two different things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow, you\u2019re just being silly, Jane. You\u2019re just going to have to learn to kiss and make up with Grandma and Jenny for the holidays. I won\u2019t stand for this. It was one thing for you to miss Thanksgiving, but this is getting ridiculous. Where else are you going to go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, I might have plans,\u201d I lied.</p><p>Mama gasped. \u201cWhat do you mean, you have plans? It\u2019s not Christmas unless you\u2019re with family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I have some new friends this year, and they don\u2019t have family around here. I thought it would be nice to spend some time with them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNew vampire friends,\u201d Mama said, just a hint of bitterness tingeing her tone.</p><p>\u201cNo, not all of them are vampires.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, if you want to throw away years of tradition, that\u2019s your choice. If you really want to spend the first Christmas since we lost you with strangers, that\u2019s your decision to make.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean, \u2018lost me\u2019? I\u2019m right here!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t keep talking about it, Jane.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTalking about what? We don\u2019t talk about this. At all.\u201d</p><p>Mama sighed, the slightest edge of a sniffle curling at the end. \u201cWill you at least come to the tree-trimming party so we can take the family picture? Not everyone has to know that you and Jenny have had a falling out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t you just Photoshop me in or something?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t even know what that means.\u201d Mama grunted. \u201cJust show up on Saturday at six.\u201d</p><p>I hung up the phone and commenced thumping my head against the leaded-glass counter.</p><p>\u201cIf you keep doing that, it\u2019s going to leave a mark,\u201d a smooth, bemused voice said. \u201cEven your healing powers have limits.\u201d</p><p>I looked up to find Andrea Byrne standing in front of me, smirking.</p><p>\u201cYou look perturbed. Well, more perturbed than usual,\u201d she said, examining the paling bruise on my forehead.</p><p>\u201cWhat was your first clue?\u201d I asked grumpily.</p><p>Andrea reminds one of what Grace Kelly might have looked like with red hair and a twisted backstory. Broke after her split with her (fickle bastard) undead ex and disowned by a firmly antivampire family, Andrea came to the Hollow years before to get a job in a boutique downtown. But her real income came from clients who enjoyed her blood in a mutually safe environment for a small fee. Andrea was the first\u2014and last\u2014human I fed from. It made for a rather awkward beginning to our friendship, but she was the one human I knew who truly understood the bizarre aspects of my new vampire lifestyle. She was sort of like my undead blankie, keeping me connected to the living world. Mama would have done the same thing but with more guilt and sunburns.</p><p>She hefted both Mind over Matter and The Spectrum of Vampirism off the counter and winced. \u201cA little light reading?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust researching my roots,\u201d I said, flipping Spectrum to the chapter titled \u201cGlobal Origins.\u201d \u201cLike this charming theory, for example: \u2018Gypsies believed that vampires returned from the dead to seek vengeance on those who may have contributed to their death or neglected to give them a proper burial. Graves were watched carefully for signs of being disturbed. Exhumed corpses that were bloated or had turned black would be staked, beheaded, and burned.\u2019 Well, why didn\u2019t they just blast the remains out of a cannon? Humans are stupid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m standing right here,\u201d Andrea griped.</p><p>\u201cOh, you\u2019re not really human. You\u2019re like one of us, only with a pulse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Mr. Wainwright?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSame goes.\u201d I nodded. \u201cYou don\u2019t normally come in here. What\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m bored.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBored?\u201d I asked.</p><p>She nodded. \u201cEver since Dick became interested in me, all but my most loyal clients have stopped calling. I don\u2019t know if they are in doubt of my taste or frightened of Dick, but either way, it\u2019s not good for business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, thanks for thinking of me.\u201d I grinned. \u201cI\u2019m off in a couple of hours. What did you want to do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I know, why don\u2019t we go out for a nice girls\u2019 night, get into a bar fight, and then, just for kicks, one of us could end up suspected in a vampire murder. That could be fun,\u201d Andrea suggested brightly. \u201cOh, wait, we did that already.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think you\u2019re being funny, but you\u2019re not funny. When I tell the story, I don\u2019t tell people about you being knee-walking drunk, ergo unconscious, during the whole fight. I think I\u2019m going to change that policy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou actually tell people that story?\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cBut when I tell it, Walter is six-foot-three and a trained cage fighter.\u201d</p><p>Andrea chuckled.</p><p>I grinned slyly. \u201cDick has been looking for you.\u201d</p><p>She grumbled. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t know the meaning of the word \u2018restraining order,\u2019 does he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTechnically, that\u2019s two words.\u201d I giggled. \u201cDick and Andrea sitting in a tree, B-I-T-I-N-G\u2014ow!\u201d I whined as she punched my shoulder. \u201cYou\u2019re just mad because secretly, underneath that sophisticated exterior, you\u2019re hot for Dickie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am not hot for Dickie,\u201d Andrea spat.</p><p>\u201cMe and my bruised shoulder say thou dost protest too much,\u201d I said dryly.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s practically stalking me. He just won\u2019t let it go. He\u2019s just being ... he\u2019s being a jackass with a flaky jackass crust and a delicious jackass filling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo he\u2019s jackass pie?\u201d I asked, making my \u201cew\u201d face.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no reason to be crass,\u201d Andrea mewed primly.</p><p>\u201cYou know, you\u2019re starting to talk like me. I find this more than a little troubling. Maybe we should spend less time together.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI could come up with jackass pie on my own,\u201d she insisted, then mulled that statement over. \u201cNo. No, I couldn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy the way, what are your plans for Christmas?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cPretending my parents haven\u2019t disowned me, watching It\u2019s a Wonderful Life, and drinking a few bottles of merlot. How about you?\u201d</p> <p>I chewed my lip. \u201cI\u2019m thinking of throwing together a little party for us disenfranchised monsters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re using us as an excuse not to spend time with your family?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m choosing to spend time with my dearest friends,\u201d I retorted. \u201cFine, it\u2019s eighty percent spending time with you guys and twenty percent avoiding my family.\u201d</p><p>Andrea shot me her best doubtful glare.</p><p>\u201cSeventy/thirty,\u201d I said as the doorbell tinkled. I was confronted with the sight of a weeping werewolf, clutching a bear trap in one hand and a wedding planner in the other.</p> <p>There\u2019s something you don\u2019t see every day.</p><p>A curious Mr. Wainwright poked his head out of the office, illogically thrilled at the sight of a tearful werewolf in his shop. \u201cThis is the most traffic the shop has had in years,\u201d he said, smiling brightly. \u201cJane, would your friends like a cup of tea?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you put the kettle on?\u201d I suggested in a voice as calm and soothing as I could muster. \u201cAndrea Byrne, Jolene McClaine,\u201d I said, eyeing Jolene and the bear trap warily. \u201cJolene, honey, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cZeb!\u201d she wailed plaintively.</p><p>\u201cWhat about Zeb? Is he OK?\u201d I demanded, sniffing the trap but finding no scent of blood.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s fine.\u201d Her deeply backwoods accent stretched the word out into \u201cfaaaaaaahhhnnnn\u201d before she wailed, \u201cHe\u2019s called off the wedding!\u201d</p> <p>Visions of an unworn, unreturnable peach sateen bridesmaid\u2019s dress lurking in the back of my closet flashed before my eyes. I shuddered. \u201cI thought we agreed that you guys weren\u2019t going to come to me anymore with your problems.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut this time is different!\u201d Jolene wailed. \u201cThis time I need help!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOK, OK.\u201d I took the trap out of her hands and wrapped my arms around her. She sniffled into my shirt, leaving a spreading wet stain on my shoulder. \u201cAre you sure about that he called off the wedding, Jolene? Sometimes Zeb misspells stuff in e-mails, and it comes across badly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I\u2019m sure!\u201d Jolene howled, drawing a sharp wince from Andrea, who was more accustomed to the slightly more sedate antics of vampires. \u201cI\u2019m not stupid!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOK,\u201d I said, scratching behind her ears. It may sound condescending, but sometimes that calmed her down.</p><p>\u201cDo you have anythin\u2019 to eat?\u201d Jolene asked, sniffing the air. \u201cI can\u2019t talk like this on an empty stomach.\u201d</p><p>Jolene couldn\u2019t do anything on an empty stomach.</p><p>Mr. Wainwright helped me scavenge leftover pizza, canned stew, and some Chef Boyardee from his apartment and then made himself scarce. Even his fascination with were-creatures wasn\u2019t enough to keep him around a hysterical female. Note to self: Bring pot pies and bagged salad to the shop for Mr. Wainwright. This kind of diet could not be good for him.</p> <p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d I asked as she gorged herself on cold pepperoni. It was always oddly compelling to watch Jolene eat, with the stark contrast between the beautiful, trim girl and the huge amounts of food she shoveled into her face. If you didn\u2019t know about her werewolf metabolism, you\u2019d wonder where she put it all.</p><p>I tried to reach out to her mind, but the jumble of images\u2014confused, pained, and frenetic\u2014made me dizzy.</p><p>\u201cMy cousins played a little joke on Zeb, and he got so upset,\u201d she said, gnawing on reheated crust. \u201cI told him he was overreactin\u2019 and he should be glad that my cousins were tryin\u2019 to make him part of the pack. And then he said something about \u2018not wantin\u2019 to live on the farm with the Jerry Springer family\u2019 and how we were going to lose our house thanks to them. I asked what the hell he meant by that. He said he was sure I knew all about it. I told him he sounded like a paranoid jerk. He said that if I really felt that way, then he wasn\u2019t gonna to be able to marry me.\u201d Her eyes welled up again. \u201cHow could he do that? How could he just break it off without even looking upset about it? How could he just leave me?\u201d</p><p>I waited for the yowl of \u201cmeeee\u201d to end. \u201cWhat kind of joke did your cousins play on Zeb?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey put a bear trap between his usual parkin\u2019 spot by the front door to Mama and Daddy\u2019s place. It was just a joke,\u201d Jolene insisted. \u201cWe do it to each other all the time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWolves set bear traps for each other? Isn\u2019t that sort of, I don\u2019t know, culturally insensitive or something?\u201d</p><p>Jolene seemed befuddled by the question. \u201cNo, it doesn\u2019t hurt that bad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou heal ten times faster than the average human,\u201d I told her. \u201cThat bear trap could have cost Zeb a foot. He\u2019s already lost a pinkie toe to your family\u2019s little jokes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re just bein\u2019 playful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe lost an appendage, Jolene. That\u2019s not playful, that\u2019s wanton endangerment.\u201d</p><p>Jolene sniffed. \u201cDon\u2019t! Don\u2019t use the \u2018talkin\u2019 down the crazy person\u2019 voice. And don\u2019t act like you\u2019re sad this happened. You probably set this whole thing up to get out of wearing the bridesmaid dress.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is wrong with you?\u201d I asked. \u201cWhy would you say that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know!\u201d Jolene cried. \u201cHe proposed to me! I was a normal person before this. He made me go crazy! I know my family is screwed up, OK? I know it\u2019s not normal for your cousin to want to marry you or for your parents to make you move in less than a hundred yards away from them.</p><p>\u201cI know it\u2019s not normal to be so loud and in each other\u2019s business all the time. I know they\u2019re passive-aggressive and just plain aggressive and they pay no attention to boundaries. They know they could have hurt Zeb with these pranks, and that\u2019s half of the fun for them. But what am I supposed to do? This is my pack. This is thousands of years of breedin\u2019 and instinct. I can\u2019t stop that.\u201d</p><p>She sobbed and wiped at her eyes. \u201cAnd that\u2019s what I told him. Then I said he wouldn\u2019t be so tense if maybe his parents were more supportive of us instead of torpedoin\u2019 the wedding every chance they got. He asked me what I meant by that, and I said that it was obvious his mama would be a lot happier if he was marrying you instead of me. And when he told me that was crazy, I told him to take his ring and shove it where the sun don\u2019t shine, and I stormed off, and now I\u2019m sittin\u2019 here, miserable, and with no idea whether I\u2019m gettin\u2019 married.\u201d</p><p>Andrea goggled. \u201cThat was a Jane-worthy tirade. Really, very impressive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t help,\u201d I said, turning to Jolene. \u201cAnd you, you\u2019ve got to draw a line somewhere. You\u2019re marrying Zeb. His safety and happiness have to be your priority, no matter what your family does. Stand up for him, if not to show your family that you\u2019re going to be the first McClaine to break this weird-ass cycle of human abuse, then to show Zeb that you\u2019re on his side.</p><p>\u201cApologize,\u201d I said. \u201cAnd then go perform some physical favors for him that I never have to think about. And both of you have to stop coming to me when you have relationship problems. I barely have time for my own problems, and yours are, well, weird.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a really good friend, Jane,\u201d she said, shoving the remains of pizza into her mouth.</p><p>I patted her arm. \u201cI know. I was serious about that last part.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel\u2019s home on Silver Ridge Road would have been the crown jewel in any historical home tour ... if anyone in town knew about it. Gabriel had worked for years to erase the house, with its white clapboard, big wraparound porch, and Corinthian columns, from public memory. The house was cozy and way less intimidating than you would expect inside. The rooms I\u2019d seen were done in subtle, muted colors, soft fabrics, little knickknacks that spoke of Gabriel\u2019s years of travel, the kind of rooms where you wouldn\u2019t expect to find your boyfriend plying your best friend with liquor.</p><p>Poor Zeb looked absolutely miserable, splayed on the maroon leather couch with a glass in one hand and his head in the other.</p><p>When he looked up, I saw he was wearing an eye patch. This could not be good.</p><p>\u201cOK, I heard about the bear trap. Did something happen to your eye?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m considering a career as a pirate,\u201d Zeb snarked as he gingerly adjusted the patch strap. He winced when it snapped back into place over his eye. The elastic had given him a quailish cowlick in the middle of his dark blond crown. \u201cSome of the boys out at the farm were shooting off bottle rockets a few days ago. Jolene\u2019s cousin Vance wanted to show them how to use them to knock cans off the fence, and somehow one of the rockets went astray.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou got hit in the eye with a bottle rocket?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I got hit in the eye with the bottle. Vance wasn\u2019t watching where he tossed it when they were running from the bottle rocket.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, that combined with bear trap is why you\u2019re doing the full-on Dean Martin routine?\u201d I asked, looking at the bottle between them.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been evicted,\u201d Zeb said, turning away two fingers of very nice bourbon.</p><p>Gabriel huffed and slugged it back himself. Considering the average vintage in his wine cellar, I wasn\u2019t surprised he wouldn\u2019t let it go to waste.</p><p>\u201cThis has not been your day, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy landlord left me a notice today,\u201d Zeb said, making a face when Gabriel held up a bottle of vodka with a Cyrillic label. \u201cI was supposed to renew my lease next week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe can\u2019t do that! Jolene worked so hard to leave her mark on that place,\u201d I exclaimed. Gabriel gave me a cringing, questioning look. \u201cWith throw pillows and paint, I mean. Nothing gross.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI went to sign the papers with Mr. Dugger, but he\u2019s decided to rent to another family,\u201d Zeb said, his pale face stretched in tight, miserable lines. \u201cHe said Jolene\u2019s fixed the place up so nicely he can charge more than we can afford. And somehow, Jolene\u2019s uncle Deke just happened to call today to remind her that her plot of land on the pack compound is still available. He even offered us a brand-newish trailer as a wedding gift.\u201d Zeb sighed, planting his face in his hands as Gabriel stood to pour him a scotch. \u201cI don\u2019t know how they did it, but they got to Mr. Dugger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you might be giving them a little too much\u2014yeah, you\u2019re probably right,\u201d I agreed, slipping an arm around his shoulders. \u201cWhat are you going to do? Starting with, will you please pry the crying werewolf out of my shop? She\u2019s starting to disturb the customer. Emphasis on customer; we only have one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou saw Jolene?\u201d Zeb grimaced. \u201cShe was crying?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm, you kind of broke off your engagement. That can bring out the emotion in a gal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, I need to apologize,\u201d Zeb said. \u201cBut I\u2019d like to have a home to offer her when I beg and plead.\u201d He took a sip of Gabriel\u2019s liquor, blanched, and coughed. \u201cSeriously, that\u2019s what it tastes like?\u201d</p><p>\u201cZeb can only drink stuff that tastes a little like alcohol and a lot like fruit punch,\u201d I told Gabriel.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll start keeping some around,\u201d Gabriel said. \u201cUntil then, try to finish the expensive single-malt I just poured for you. Peasant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would insult you back, but you seem to own or know about all of the good rental properties around town.\u201d Zeb snorted.</p><p>Giving new meaning to the words \u201csaved by the bell,\u201d Gabriel\u2019s cell phone began singing. His face when he saw the caller ID stopped me from making a joke about voice mail, which Gabriel didn\u2019t know how to use. Without a word, he left the room and said hello quietly into the receiver as he walked out onto the back porch.</p><p>For lack of something better to say, I told Zeb, \u201cI wish I could help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAw, I appreciate that,\u201d he said, leaning his head against mine. \u201cBut you\u2019re, you know, broke.\u201d</p><p>My jaw dropped. \u201cYou know about that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m your best friend,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd you haven\u2019t had a full-time job in months. I can do math above the kindergarten level. Besides, I would never take money from you. We\u2019ve never mixed money into our friendship before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe never had money before,\u201d I pointed out.</p><p>\u201cAnd so far, that\u2019s worked out for us,\u201d he said. \u201cBesides, if we\u2019re not going to take that kind of \u2018help\u2019\u2014emphasis on the sarcastic invisible quotation marks\u2014from Jolene\u2019s family, it would be hard to justify taking help from you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have a well-thought-out and emotionally mature argument,\u201d I admitted. \u201cDang it. On an unrelated note, here\u2019s an interesting tidbit: Your mama kept trying to get me to eat at the funeral, which would have ended in my vomiting publicly. She does know that I\u2019ve been turned, right? I assumed she has just refused to mention it because it interferes with her version of reality. But you did tell her, right?\u201d</p><p>Zeb winced. \u201cEvery time I try, she repeats something stupid she hears on talk radio, like vampires should be rounded up and forced to live in communities far away from humans.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStill, you\u2019re marrying into a werewolf clan, and you\u2019re worried about telling her there\u2019s a vampire bridesmaid? If anything, you could use me to take the heat off Jolene and Company.\u201d I gasped as realization slowly dawned. \u201cShe still doesn\u2019t know you\u2019re marrying into a werewolf clan, does she?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d he admitted, covering his face with his hands. Whether it was from shame or to protect his eyes from my vampire death glare, I have no idea. \u201cYou know her. You know what she does with announcements like this. We\u2019re talking Valium and screaming, taking to her bed for weeks at a time. I knew there was no way she\u2019d accept you, much less Jolene and her family. I\u2019m just trying to get through the wedding without her making a scene. I saw what it did to Jolene when my parents threatened not to come. Can you imagine how she would handle Mama\u2019s werewolf meltdown? How much that would hurt her? Once we\u2019re married, Jolene will realize that she\u2019s better off with my family not liking her anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you think your family will notice something\u2019s off when the bride\u2019s side mows through the buffet?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cOh, my family will be too drunk to notice,\u201d he said, rolling his eyes. \u201cWhy do you think we\u2019re having the open bar?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s not\u2014actually, that\u2019s brilliant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve tried everything to get Mama to behave, to be decent to Jolene,\u201d Zeb said. \u201cShe says she\u2019ll straighten up and be nice, and then I get a phone call from Jolene, crying about whatever Mama\u2019s said now. I\u2019ve told her to ignore Mama, but she just can\u2019t. She can\u2019t stand having someone not like her. And I\u2019m exhausted. I\u2019m tired of being the go-between. Why can\u2019t she just handle this stuff herself?\u201d</p><p>I arched my brows at the angry, exasperated tone Zeb was using. He seemed to shake it off after a moment, rubbing his hands over his patch and then moving them to pinch the bridge of his nose.</p><p>\u201cIn a few months, this will all be over,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cBecause you will have succumbed to chronic stress headaches and bottle-rocket trauma?\u201d I asked, taking one of his hands and gently pushing at the pressure point between his thumb and forefinger.</p> <p>When he smiled, the skin around his visible eye crinkled. \u201cBecause in a few months, we\u2019ll be married. And we can enter the witness-protection program.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds like a plan,\u201d I said, quirking my lips as I stared at him.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>I shrugged. \u201cIt\u2019s just weird. Normally, I\u2019d be the first person you\u2019d call when something like this trailer deal comes up. But now it\u2019s Gabriel. I think you\u2019re entering into a functional adult relationship with someone besides me. I guess the wedding is the final sign that we\u2019re growing up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know how I feel about it,\u201d Zeb said absently. He was looking at me intently; his good eye seemed glazed over, unfocused. This was not the way Zeb normally looked at me. This was the way Zeb looked at mint-condition, still-in-the-package GI Joe Battle Force dolls.</p><p>Since he was dealing with a traumatic injury, I was willing to attribute this bizarre behavior to a concussion. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t suck.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt does a little bit.\u201d He cupped the back of my head in his hand, bringing my face almost uncomfortably close to his. For a weird moment, it felt as if he was going to kiss me. Which, for our relationship, was highly unusual. I leaned away, pulling his hands from my neck.</p><p>Gabriel came in and found the two of us staring at each other, Zeb\u2019s hands in mine. Zeb dropped his hands to his sides and looked vaguely guilty.</p><p>\u201cIf you weren\u2019t Jane\u2019s best friend and engaged to a beautiful and violently monogamous woman, I might find this upsetting,\u201d Gabriel commented dryly.</p><p>6</p><p>Werewolf fathers insist on preapproving proposals of marriage. In fact, it\u2019s rumored that the human tradition of \u201casking for a woman\u2019s hand\u201d came from a human who failed to ask for betrothal permission and actually lost his hand.</p><p>\u2014Mating Rituals and Love Customs of the Were</p><p>\u201cWhy did I try to make more friends?\u201d I muttered, shielding my eyes from my reflection in the Bridal Barn\u2019s fitting-room mirror. \u201cThis is what comes of having girlfriends.\u201d</p><p>If the picture of Jolene\u2019s chosen bridesmaid\u2019s dress was bad, the live version was horrifying. Basted together, the putrefied peach piecework was not just unflattering, it was insulting. My hips looked wider than my shoulders; wider than the dressing-room door, in fact. My preternaturally pale skin looked cheesy and almost blue. I actually looked dead, which was a first. At no time had I ever wished harder that vampires couldn\u2019t see themselves in mirrors.</p> <p>After much groveling on both sides, Zeb and Jolene made up, which meant I was still trapped in bridesmaid-dress hell. I took cold comfort in the fact that I wasn\u2019t alone. I would be walking down the aisle with Jolene\u2019s legion of cousins. The McClaines went with a \u201clene\u201d theme in naming this generation\u2019s females: Raylene, Lurlene, identical twins Charlene and Darlene, then triplets Arlene, Braylene, and Angelene. It was pronounced \u201cAngel-lean,\u201d by the way. That\u2019s a mistake I didn\u2019t make twice. All of them were gorgeous, redhaired, and green-eyed, with ridiculously high cheekbones. And all of them pretty much hated me. First, I was an outsider, which could have been overlooked if I was not also a vampire. Compounded by the injustice of my position as best maid despite being a relatively new friend, this created another sense of clan shame among the cousins. The fact that Zeb and Jolene chose me to avoid a blood feud among Jolene\u2019s cousins escaped them.</p><p>Despite the snubbing of her firstborn, Lurlene, from the best-maid spot, Jolene\u2019s aunt Vonnie was finally persuaded to keep her shop open after dusk so I could come in for a fitting. I\u2019m pretty sure the indignity of having to rework her schedule for a vampire is what put the burr up her butt.</p><p>Buying your first prom gown at the Bridal Barn is a rite of passage for every Half-Moon Hollow girl. Because it was the only place in town where you could buy a prom gown. Or a wedding gown. Or a bridesmaid gown. We had a formal-wear chain store called Mr. Monkeysuit in the early 1990s, but they mysteriously shut their doors after six months. Before I knew the Barn was owned by a werewolf, I figured that the lack of competition stemmed from the claustrophobic confines of Hollow commerce. Now I thought it may have been because Aunt Vonnie ate her competition.</p><p>Now that I knew how much time Aunt Vonnie spent in the nude, I found it deliciously ironic that she owned a dress shop. Werewolves don\u2019t like wearing clothes when they\u2019re in the home field. Clothing makes life awkward for werewolves, for whom the most comfortable state is to be in wolf form. In an environment where they\u2019re relaxed, sometimes they don\u2019t even realize they\u2019ve changed. There\u2019s a subtle blending of light, and suddenly there\u2019s a full-grown wolf standing next to you. It\u2019s difficult to change form while dressed. At the same time, adult werewolves become conditioned to associate clothing with being out in public among humans. It\u2019s handy as a reminder to help keep the change in check.</p><p>Jolene says that modern weres have adopted the human habit of dressing for weddings since so many of them involve human guests, and a nude officiate can be terribly offputting. The weres figure if you have to be dressed, it might as well be the most elaborate, uncomfortable clothes possible, which led Vonnie to open her shop. The problem was that Vonnie\u2019s tastes hadn\u2019t quite evolved since the days of big shoulder pads and bigger hair. The dresses in the Bridal Barn only came in colors that cannot be found in nature. Also, I don\u2019t think any of the fabrics were manufactured after 1984. We\u2019re talking a lot of large-gauge sequins.</p><p>\u201cJane, are you comin\u2019 out?\u201d Jolene called from outside the dressing room.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I whispered, transfixed by the horrific reflection before me.</p><p>Wasn\u2019t there a Greek myth that ended like this?</p><p>From just outside the privacy curtain, Jolene said quietly, \u201cZeb says you\u2019re not thrilled with the dress.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd that means I have to kill Zeb for telling you that,\u201d I said, poking my head out of the dressing room but keeping the curtain closed tight around my neck. \u201cI hate it when couples make up. It means they repeat everything other people have told them in some sort of confessional fit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt can\u2019t be that bad\u2014\u201d Jolene ripped back the curtain. \u201cWhoa.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d I deadpanned.</p><p>\u201cIt will look different,\u201d Jolene promised. \u201cAfter the rose and the ruffles and everything are put on. It\u2019ll look different.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think ruffles are going to improve the situation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Jolene whispered. \u201cI know it\u2019s horrible. I\u2019ve worn that dress in six of my cousins\u2019 weddings, including my cousin Raylene, who chose black taffeta for a July ceremony. Nobody looks good in it. That\u2019s the whole point. Parade the bridesmaids out in this dress, make them look like cows\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d I glared at her. \u201cThere\u2019s no need to agree with me quite so much.\u201d</p><p>She ignored me. \u201cSo that when you walk down the aisle, you seem gorgeous by comparison. That\u2019s the real tradition behind the dress.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re already gorgeous by comparison,\u201d I hissed.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d she said, glowing briefly. \u201cBut it\u2019s the one concession I\u2019ve made to the pack about the wedding. I\u2019m not marryin\u2019 a were. I\u2019m havin\u2019 a nighttime ceremony to accommodate the vampire guests. I\u2019m not marryin\u2019 in the boneyard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBoneyard?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cDon\u2019t ask. I went against almost every McClaine family tradition to marry Zeb. This is the one thing I agreed to.\u201d She paused when I arched an eyebrow. \u201cThat you have to wear. You can get me really, really drunk at my bachelorette party and take embarrassin\u2019 pictures,\u201d she promised.</p><p>\u201cI was going to do that anyway,\u201d I snarked.</p><p>Aunt Vonnie bustled into the room with a bolt of lime-green chiffon. My lack of enthusiasm was clearly an affront to her craft.</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t stayed open past six in thirty years of business,\u201d she reminded me.</p><p>\u201cI really appreciate it, Miss Vonnie,\u201d I said with all the cheer I could rally dressed like an extra from Footloose. \u201cAnd thank you for making the dresses. They\u2019re just ... stunning.\u201d</p><p>Aunt Vonnie easily picked up on my shifting eyes and twitchy lips. Or maybe I was pushing it with the empty double thumbs-up.</p><p>I have got to learn how to lie.</p><p>\u201cEvery McClaine bride since 1984 has chosen the \u2018Ruffles and Dreams\u2019 for her bridesmaids.\u201d She sniffed, turning back to the sewing room. \u201cIt\u2019s very popular here in town. I\u2019ve made this dress in thirty-two colors for more than one hundred weddings.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that certainly explains the Hollow\u2019s unusually high divorce rate,\u201d I muttered.</p><p>\u201cI heard that!\u201d Aunt Vonnie yelled from the back. I was going to have to watch myself around werewolves and their superhearing.</p><p>I turned to Jolene. \u201cThere will be pictures. Oh, yes, pictures and male strippers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI accept your terms,\u201d Jolene said solemnly.</p><p>\u201cGet me out of this thing.\u201d I sighed, angling the ridiculously placed zipper toward her. \u201cCan I at least see the wedding dress?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI ordered it special on the Internet!\u201d she squealed as she ran into the back room.</p><p>\u201cStill need help with the zipper!\u201d I called after her. I turned and caught a look at myself in a mirror. \u201cGah!\u201d</p><p>Seriously, how does a veteran seamstress sew a zipper so that you need Go-Go Gadget arms to reach it? I spun in circles like a dog chasing its tail. I heard shuffling and giggling as Jolene tried on her wedding dress.</p><p>She emerged from the dressing room a vision in an elaborately beaded white Edwardian gown. And despite the universal laws of wedding dress ordering, the standard size four actually fit her perfectly. The cut emphasized her tiny waist and gave her the ideal hourglass silhouette. Every move sent a burst of sparkles from the beading. Her skin seemed clearer, brighter, creamier, her eyes a truer green.</p><p>\u201cI hate you. You\u2019re completely gorgeous, and I hate you,\u201d I grumbled, feeling even more dumpy in my half-basted peach death shroud.</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d She sighed dreamily.</p><p>\u201cMeanwhile, I\u2019m still dressed like this and ...\u201d I sent a glance at my watch.</p><p>\u201cThe engagement party!\u201d she cried. \u201cI almost forgot!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s probably just your brain\u2019s protective response to the prospect of seeing Mama Ginger,\u201d I said as she dashed off.</p><p>\u201cHey, I\u2019m still in this ... thing!\u201d I yelled after her.</p><p>You know that feeling you get when you walk into a room and you\u2019re completely underdressed? That feeling would have been welcome at the Lavelle-McClaine engagement fete.</p><p>Claiming that the McClaine family was hogging all of the prewedding revelry, Mama Ginger threw together a last-minute \u201ccelebration\u201d of Zeb and Jolene\u2019s engagement. Engagement parties are a rarity in the Hollow, generally thrown by swankier families at the Half-Moon Hollow Country Club and Catfish Farm. Mama Ginger pulled a fast one when she listed the venue address on the invitations. Since few of us spent a lot of time at Eddie Mac\u2019s, where local rednecks went to find their future former spouses, we were not familiar with the exact street number. Floyd and Mama Ginger had special access to the back room there as members of the pool league.</p><p>It was a surprise party, as in \u201cSurprise! You\u2019re wearing three-inch heels, but your party\u2019s being held at a place where the table linens come from wall-mounted dispensers.\u201d</p><p>I should have suspected something when the invitations encouraged us to \u201cdress up.\u201d This may have been a counterattack following the Great Wedding Date Change. A week after the wedding invitations were sent out, Mama Ginger decided that her allotted 100 were not enough. Apparently, her open distaste for the bride didn\u2019t preclude Mama Ginger\u2019s right to invite every person she\u2019d ever met to her only son\u2019s wedding. She convinced a neighbor who sold stationery out of the back of her dad\u2019s gas station to help Mama Ginger design her own version of the invitation, featuring a Precious Moments bride and groom. Mama Ginger sent it out to another 150 distant relatives and passing acquaintances, so that instead of assuming the risk of inviting 100 carefully selected strangers to their farm, the McClaines now risked exposing their secret to 250 people even Mama Ginger might not recognize face-to-face or sober. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>When Mimi and Jolene got wind of this maneuver, their only logical defense seemed to be moving the wedding up a week without planning to tell Mama Ginger until the last minute. And it would have worked, if Misty Kilgore, whose husband was shooting the wedding photos, had kept her mouth shut in line at the Piggly Wiggly.</p><p>Mama Ginger responded with a world-class hissy fit, further exacerbated when she was told that anyone who was not on the original mailing list would be turned away at the McClaines\u2019 gate by large male cousins. This steely-spined response by Mimi McClaine forever secured my loyalty and devotion. Mama Ginger\u2019s countermove was to tell Misty Kilgore that the wedding was off, prompting Mr. Kilgore to rip up the contract and schedule another wedding that weekend. Since there were no local photographers available, it was decided that Jolene\u2019s cousin Scooter, who had a lazy eye and astigmatism, would be taking the pictures. It was safe to say at this point that Jolene had lost all control of the wedding-planning process.</p><p>So I guess I shouldn\u2019t have been surprised to be standing under a guttering neon Budweiser sign wearing a strapless black dress and hair that took an alarming amount of time and pins. Vampires don\u2019t fare well in redneck establishments. There tend to be a lot of easily breakable wooden objects and, well, rednecks. And Eddie Mac\u2019s just happened to be the county\u2019s main supplier of T-shirts showing a cartoon vampire being stomped on by the Statue of Liberty.</p> <p>\u201cOh, hello, Jane, honey!\u201d Mama Ginger cried, rushing past Jolene and the recently de-eye-patched Zeb. She wrapped her arms around me in an inescapable viselike grip and swung me around in time to the jukebox\u2019s blaring \u201cIslands in the Stream.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s my girl! How are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d I said, smiling politely, even as Jolene\u2019s face fell at this blatant display of favoritism. Behind her back, Mimi sent Mama Ginger a poisonous glare.</p><p>\u201cMr. Lavelle,\u201d I said, smiling politely at Zeb\u2019s father. Floyd Lavelle hadn\u2019t had a civil word for me since I refused to fetch him a beer at a Labor Day barbecue. I was seven, and even then, I didn\u2019t know my place. He grunted in what passed for a greeting and headed for the bar.</p><p>\u201cNow, I made my special pimento cheese balls because I remember how much you like them,\u201d Mama Ginger said, pinching my cheek. \u201cYou\u2019re so skinny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOK, that hurts,\u201d I said, prying her carmine-tipped pincers from my face. \u201cThis is Gabriel. He\u2019s a friend of mine and Zeb\u2019s, oh, and a groomsman.\u201d</p> <p>Mama Ginger caught sight of our joined hands. Her sharp brown eyes narrowed at Gabriel. She mumbled, \u201cHow nice,\u201d and turned on her heels.</p><p>Mama Ginger continued to greet her guests, most of whom were bar regulars. Jolene might as well have been furniture for all the attention she was paid. For example, the little banner Mama Ginger had hung simply said, \u201cCongratulations, Zeb,\u201d leaving room for possibilities. To add insult to gastronomical injury, the bar\u2019s \u201cspecial event package\u201d provided a crock pot of beer weenies, a grocery-store sheet cake, and lots of beer on tap. That was it. For fifty people. Fortunately, Mimi McClaine saw this coming and called in werewolf reinforcements.</p><p>Constantly thinking and talking about food is what makes werewolves some of the world\u2019s greatest chefs and restaurateurs. For example, Jolene\u2019s uncle Clay owned one of the best lunch places in town. His personal food philosophy was \u201cMeat, meat, and more meat,\u201d which might explain the shop\u2019s specialty: a sandwich piled high with two pork tenderloins, Black Forest ham, and bacon. Within a half hour, several aunties and uncles arrived with huge platters of cold cuts, barbecue, salads, cupcakes, and cookies, which the bar crowd fell on like hyenas on a fresh zebra carcass.</p><p>I sidled up to Mimi, who was watching the proceedings from a very dark corner. Her irises were constricted in a distinctly nonhuman manner. I slipped an arm around her waist, stroking a soothing hand along her spine. \u201cWill you adopt me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill it piss off Ginger?\u201d she muttered.</p><p>I nodded. \u201cProbably.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m trying to be as patient as possible, but if that witch doesn\u2019t ease up on my baby, I may not be held accountable for my actions.\u201d</p><p>We watched as the buffet was moved off Pool Table 3 so Herb Baker\u2019s Friday-night group could proceed with their usual game.</p><p>I whispered, \u201cI\u2019ll help you hide the body.\u201d</p><p>Mimi winked at me and snuffled my cheek. \u201cYou\u2019re a good girl.\u201d</p><p>It was at this point, after her third rum and Coke, that Mama Ginger decided to make a toast. Ish. She tinkled a napkin dispenser against the side of her glass to get our attention, which, given the noise level, only worked for those of us with superhearing. Finally, she asked that someone unplug the jukebox. Actually, she told Dick to \u201cunplug that damn thing before I put a foot through it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow, settle down, you all. Settle down. I have something to say.\u201d She sighed, letting loose what appeared to be a silent belch. \u201cWell, none of us thought this day would come.\u201d She put her arm around Floyd, who was propped up next to her on a bar stool, just this side of pleasantly buzzed, just south of the hostile-outburst zone. \u201cAnd if anything, we always thought, well, hoped, that Zeb would be marrying Jane.\u201d</p><p>The entire room fell silent. Hell, the world stopped spinning. Mimi shot me a mortified look. Jolene turned a sort of pale blue-gray. Zeb seemed oblivious to the fact that his future wife had just been insulted. In fact, he smiled at me and winked, which seemed to make Jolene\u2019s uncles\u2019 faces contort into sock-puppet shapes.</p><p>\u201cYou know, those two have been friends since they were in preschool. They were always together, always so close. We worried about him being best friends with a girl. I mean, his daddy nearly died when he caught them playing with Cabbage Patch dolls. And Jane never dated anybody for very long. Anybody.\u201d</p> <p>Dick snorted, earning him an elbow to the ribs from me. Mama Ginger flinched at the sudden movement and wobbled a little against the bar. \u201cWe all just assumed she\u2019d give up on other guys and come back to Zeb. Jane wore the prettiest blue dress to the prom. I still have the boutonni\u00e8re she gave Zeb, pressed in my Bible. I just always thought that Jane would give me the most beautiful grandbabies. They say sometimes it skips a generation ...\u201d</p><p>Mama Ginger warbled, \u201cWe all just love Jane so much. We\u2019ve always said she was the daughter we always wanted. She\u2019s always been a part of the family\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut now, we\u2019re just so happy to be welcoming Jolene into that family,\u201d I said in a loud, explicitly cheerful voice.</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah, Joanne,\u201d Mama Ginger said, sobering enough to glance in Jolene\u2019s direction but not, apparently, to get her name right. \u201cShe seems like a nice enough girl.\u201d</p><p>Jolene watched her future mother-in-law expectantly, waiting for some semblance of a welcome, a compliment. Instead, Mama Ginger smiled brightly and announced, \u201cWell, let\u2019s eat, everybody!\u201d</p><p>Jolene\u2019s face fell. I tried to make eye contact, tried to make some sort of connection to show her I was on her side, that being Mama Ginger\u2019s favorite was about as desirable as being the prettiest pig at the fair. But her own mother had wrapped a protective arm around her and ushered her into a quiet corner. I fought against my instincts to soothe and smooth ruffled feathers and backed out of sight toward the back door.</p><p>I slammed the door against the chatter and the smoke. I sank against the building, ignoring my natural aversion to touching whatever was growing on the peeled aluminum siding. I cringed as Gabriel poked his head out the door. His look of concern melted into an absurd smile. \u201cThis is just\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d I laughed. He wrapped his arms around me, rubbing my bare arms to ward off the chill. The brisk motion took on a slow circling pattern as I wrapped my fingers around his collar and pulled him toward me. His mouth was so cool and clean and soft on mine, reminding me that there were normal places and people in the world. Normal, at least, by my standards. It was every great kiss you\u2019d ever imagined, only we were surrounded by junker cars and leaning against a molding air-conditioning unit.</p><p>I leaned my forehead against his. \u201cI will repay you in unspeakable physical favors if you can erase any trace of this party from my memory.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am intrigued by your offer. Can we discuss a down payment?\u201d He grinned as his fingers danced along my spine, deftly manipulating the zipper. This was a matter of some concern, considering that (a) this wasn\u2019t the kind of dress that allowed foundation garments, and (b) we were sort of out in the open. Released from their chiffon prison, my breasts spilled into his waiting hands.</p><p>\u201cDo I look like the kind of girl who would do this sort of thing in a parking lot?\u201d I asked, entering the battle for control of my zipper.</p><p>\u201cDick said you\u2019ve gotten down and dirty in a parking lot.\u201d Gabriel smirked.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened to ignoring and disdaining Dick? Can we go back to that?\u201d I whispered as he pressed me against the wall, pinning me with exquisite pressure. I could hear the ping of hairpins on the pavement as his fingers slid into my carefully arranged updo. Gabriel slipped his free hand under my skirt to tug at my panties. Unable to support me and strip me at the same time, he finally ripped them off my hips.</p><p>\u201cYou owe me a pair of good black panties,\u201d I told him in mock dismay. My fangs extended, nipping at his bottom lip. He grinned at me, even as the pin drop of blood welled at his mouth. Maybe I am the kind of girl who will get down and dirty in a parking lot.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll just hold on to these, then,\u201d he said, tucking them into his jacket pocket.</p><p>\u201cWhen can we leave?\u201d I murmured against his lips. \u201cWhen can I take you home and\u2014\u201d</p><p>We both froze as the door swung open and our sensitive eyes were assaulted with light.</p><p>\u201cOh, my!\u201d We turned to see Mama Ginger framed in the doorway, eyes wide with shock. And I was pinned against the wall. And the wreckage of my panties hung from Gabriel\u2019s pocket like a frayed handkerchief.</p><p>\u201cMama Ginger!\u201d</p><p>Gabriel set me down on my feet and held out his jacket to hide my efforts to pull up my dress. I burst into helpless giggles as I lost my grip on the bodice and the dress fell\u2014no jokes about having nothing to hold it up, thank you\u2014puddling at my waist.</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t funny,\u201d Mama Ginger scolded.</p><p>\u201cMaybe if I bash my head against something enough times, it will be.\u201d I grunted as I once again secured my chest under my dress.</p><p>\u201cJane, I am ashamed of you!\u201d Mama Ginger cried, pulling me into the doorway. She turned on Gabriel. \u201cAnd you, I can\u2019t believe you! If you weren\u2019t in the wedding party, I would send you home. Now, you get in there and sit with the rest of the groomsmen.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel was truly flustered. \u201cNow see here\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to see you near Jane for the rest of the night. When I was a girl, nice young men did not paw at young ladies in dirty alleys.\u201d</p><p>When she was a young lady, Mama Ginger got cited for mooning a busload of tourists in town for the annual lace-tatting convention. But Gabriel didn\u2019t know that, so he looked appropriately chagrined.</p><p>\u201cYes, ma\u2019am,\u201d he said, slinking back into the bar.</p><p>\u201cAnd Jane, you just go on over to the bride\u2019s table and sit down. But first, fix your lipstick. You look like a tramp.\u201d My jaw dropped. \u201cYou heard me. Now, scoot!\u201d</p><p>When I emerged from the bathroom, feeling far less clean than when I went in, Jolene, Zeb, my vampire friends, and some of Jolene\u2019s uncles were doing shots at the bar. This included Uncle Zane, who sounded a lot like Boomhauer from King of the Hill. The only words you could understand were his curse words. And he cursed a lot. His twin brother, Dane, made a point not to curse, instead using elementary-grade curse substitutes. When I made my preshot toast, \u201cHere\u2019s to heavy security at the wedding,\u201d Zane said something along the lines of \u201cLike that will do any damned good.\u201d Dane told Zane to watch his effing mouth in front of the effing ladies, and I couldn\u2019t help but laugh.</p><p>\u201cOh, come on, just say the words,\u201d Jolene drawled, patting Dane on the back. \u201cWe all know what you\u2019re trying to say, just go ahead, be a man and go for the guessto.\u201d</p><p>I chuckled. \u201cEither you\u2019ve had too much punch or I think you mean gusto.\u201d</p><p>Zeb snorted as he took another drink. \u201cWell, Jolene\u2019s not exactly a rocket scientist. She also says \u2018foo pas\u2019 instead of faux pas and \u2018lie-berry\u2019 instead of library.\u201d</p><p>Jolene recoiled as if Zeb had slapped her. Zane and Dane looked at Zeb as if they were sure they\u2019d heard him wrong, then abandoned their drinks, returned to the werewolf side of the room, and glared at their nephew-to-be. Even Dick and Gabriel seemed uncomfortable.</p><p>Despite the disturbing pallor that had sapped her cheeks, Jolene gave a forced, tinkly little laugh. \u201cIt\u2019s a good thing I have smart friends. I think I\u2019ll just get some more punch.\u201d</p><p>Zeb rolled his eyes and punched Gabriel\u2019s shoulder. \u201cIt\u2019s a good thing she\u2019s got such a pretty face, because there\u2019s not much going on behind it.\u201d</p><p>I sent a significant look toward Zeb. He had that hazy, befuddled look on his face again, like someone coming out of anesthesia. He seemed to shake it off, his eyes blinking as he tried to follow Jolene\u2019s path across the room. A brief flash of remorse crossed his features. Then it was replaced by some empty macho smirk. \u201cYou might want to go apologize to her.\u201d</p><p>Zeb took another drink and crushed the cup in his hand before tossing it over his shoulder. \u201cYou\u2019re right. Otherwise, I\u2019ll be paying for it later. Am I right?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Zeb slapped me on the butt and wandered away. My jaw dropped. Gabriel\u2019s eyes narrowed, but from the look on his face, I don\u2019t think he was able to process whether Zeb had just besmirched my honor or butt-slapping was something we did when I was still human. Trust me, it was not. But I wasn\u2019t about to goad my drunk vampire boyfriend in this tense atmosphere.</p><p>\u201cWhat was that about?\u201d asked Dick, who was watching Zeb with a mix of irritation and concern. \u201cZeb\u2019s not usually such a\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAsh-hole?\u201d Gabriel slurred, and swayed slightly.</p> <p>Eager to change the direction of the conversation, I stared into Gabriel\u2019s dilated pupils. \u201cHow did you get drunk so quickly? I thought our vampire constitutions kept us from being cheap drunks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not drunk!\u201d Gabriel cried, indignant. \u201cAll I\u2019ve had to drink was this punch Jolene\u2019s cousins gave me. It\u2019s delicious. It tastes like pineapple.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were completely sober when I left you a few minutes ago.\u201d I sniffed the cup and turned to watch as the bartenders poured two gallon jugs of grain alcohol into a galvanized metal tub with Kool-Aid, sliced apples, pineapple, and pears.</p><p>Like many a college freshman before him, Gabriel had fallen into the hooch trap.</p><p>Hooch is liquid evil. It\u2019s about forty-proof, but the Kool-Aid and fruit cover the taste of the alcohol. So before you know you\u2019re drunk, you\u2019ve had about four Solo cups\u2019 worth.</p> <p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s a good thing you can\u2019t eat the fruit,\u201d I muttered.</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019m going to enjoy this.\u201d Dick chuckled, watching as Gabriel squinted at the neon bar lights. \u201cGabriel couldn\u2019t hold his liquor when we were kids, either. He ruined the last good carpet at my house sicking up my daddy\u2019s best bourbon. You should have seen how green his face got\u2014\u201d</p><p>Gabriel slapped a clumsy hand over Dick\u2019s mouth. \u201cShh. Jane shouldn\u2019t have to hear that story. It\u2019s not a nice story, you can tell by looking at her face. I love Jane\u2019s face. She makes the sweetest little face when I take her\u2014hey!\u201d He pouted when I slid his hooch out of reach.</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019d like to hear this,\u201d Dick said, his expression serious.</p><p>\u201cYou, go outside and sober up,\u201d I told Gabriel, shoving him toward the door. I turned on a smirking Dick. \u201cYou, stop thinking about my sex faces.\u201d</p><p>Dick grinned. \u201cI\u2019ll just follow Gabriel outside to see if he throws up.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWorst. Party. Ever,\u201d I grumbled as I searched for the bride-to-be.</p><p>Jolene was drowning her sorrows in beer weenies. I would tell her that she was going to eat her way out of a size 4, but she had that hypermetabolism going for her. Plus, you just don\u2019t want to interrupt someone with superstrength when they\u2019re stress-eating. So I sort of nudged a plate of chicken wings at her without making eye contact. I saw a biologist do it once on a tiger special, something about submissive gestures and keeping all of your digits intact.</p><p>Jolene tore into the wings with a sort of glum sniffle, but I could tell her heart wasn\u2019t in her munching.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry Zeb said that,\u201d I told her.</p><p>\u201cOh, he didn\u2019t mean it.\u201d She sniffed. \u201cI know he\u2019s just under a lot of stress right now, with the wedding and my family and everything. I mean, the poor thing\u2019s been getting those headaches, and they make him cranky. It would help if his mama would ease up a little bit and stop being so ...\u201d Jolene paused, tears shimmering at the corners of her eyes. \u201cWhy doesn\u2019t she like me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, honey,\u201d I said, wrapping an arm around her. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t like anybody. She doesn\u2019t even really like me. She just likes to feel she has some control over the situation. She\u2019s planned for me to marry Zeb for years, and she accepts change about as well as my mama. You just have to give her a few months. She\u2019ll come around. Maybe a few years. Give her a few years.\u201d</p><p>Jolene stuffed a nacho into her mouth and didn\u2019t respond.</p><p>\u201cZeb loves you,\u201d I offered.</p> <p>She sniffed but was not cheered.</p><p>\u201cMama Ginger just caught me in a compromising position with Gabriel out back, half-topless and fully commando. That\u2019s got to add a few points back in your column.\u201d</p><p>Jolene brightened, stuffing three meatballs in her cheek. \u201cThanks. That helps.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are friends for?\u201d</p><p>7</p><p>Humans may mistake the wooing techniques of werewolves, particularly males, as predatory. Studies show that 10 percent of human-werewolf relationships begin with the male being maced.</p><p>\u2014Mating Rituals and Love Customs of the Were</p><p>After the shipwreck that was the engagement party\u2014gah, even I\u2019m doing the Titanic thing now\u2014I had to establish some special phone rules for Jolene.</p><p>For example, calling me several times during my midday sleepy time because someone is bleeding, unconscious, or on fire is acceptable. Calling me several times during my midday sleepy time because Mama Ginger tried to persuade the county clerk that Jolene and Zeb were actually first cousins and ineligible for a marriage license? Not so much.</p><p>Mama Ginger was well on her way to the Mother of the Groom Hall of Shame. Convinced that the Invitation Debacle hadn\u2019t sent a clear enough message, she started making demands. She wanted her friend, Eula, who had never baked more than a bundt, to handle the blue-and-white nautical-themed wedding cake for 200. She wanted Jolene to announce at the reception that the wedding coincided with Uncle Ace\u2019s fifty-fourth birthday and to arrange for the DJ to play \u201cFriends in Low Places\u201d in his honor.</p><p>Mama Ginger also had very firm ideas about what she did not want for the wedding. For instance, Jolene\u2019s aunt Lola runs a florist shop and had generously offered to make the floral arrangements. Mama Ginger claimed that she was allergic to pollen and insisted on silk flowers. She even went to the local floral outlet and bought out their supplies of silk daisies in magenta and yellow, nowhere near the delicate white lily arrangements Jolene wanted.</p><p>Mama Ginger had also eschewed the tradition of hosting the rehearsal dinner after Jolene\u2019s mother declined another evening at Eddie Mac\u2019s. Instead, Mimi offered to hold the dinner at the farm, since that\u2019s where the rehearsal would be and it was rather remote. Mama Ginger said, \u201cHell, just plan the whole thing,\u201d and decided to take no part in it.</p><p>When Mama Ginger tried to change the theme of the wedding from Titanic to \u201cNorth and South,\u201d I had to turn my phone off.</p><p>I had never seen Mama Ginger this fired up. Well, there was that time Zeb got cut from the Academic Team in high school and she slipped ipecac into the team advisor\u2019s coffee. Poor Mrs. Russell was throwing up for three days and missed the state Governor\u2019s Cup meet. The scary thing, then and now, was that Mama Ginger honestly thought she was doing what was best for Zeb. Much like that cheerleader\u2019s mom in Texas.</p><p>Zeb had problems of his own with Jolene\u2019s far-too-affectionate cousin. Like most predators, Vance sensed a weakness. For all their grudged acceptance of Zeb, the pack did not appreciate Mama Ginger\u2019s lack of affection for Jolene or her clear favoritism toward me. Vance was exploiting that, grumbling here and there among the relations that Zeb\u2019s family didn\u2019t appreciate the jewel they were getting. Oh, and that I was not to be trusted, because \u201cno man can just be \u2018friends\u2019 with a woman, especially a vampire woman.\u201d</p><p>If I\u2019d had my phone on, I might have gotten a warning that Mama Ginger was planning to show up at my house early one evening \u201cfor a chat.\u201d Translation: to pick apart my relationship and zero in on my soft emotional underbelly. The woman was like Hannibal Lecter in polyester pants.</p><p>Wearing my flannel reindeer pajamas and sipping my morning cup of Chock Full o\u2019 Platelets, I was not prepared for company or the toxic apple cobbler she was carting into my house. I could only pray that Aunt Jettie didn\u2019t decide to pop in at home. The first (and only) time Mama Ginger had visited River Oaks was for Jenny\u2019s first baby shower. She lit up in the parlor and put the cigarette butt in a decorative urn that was on the mantel ... which contained my beloved Great-Grandma Early\u2019s ashes. Jettie, who was corporeal at the time, tossed Mama Ginger out on her ear and threw her straw handbag after her, telling her never to darken the door again. In retaliation, Mama Ginger started a rumor that Aunt Jettie was secretly a vegetarian. It wasn\u2019t nearly as damaging as she\u2019d anticipated.</p><p>Faced with a noxious dessert and no available escape routes, I took Mama Ginger into the kitchen and shooed Fitz out the back door. While lovable, Fitz, a pound-adopted product of indiscriminate breeding among several species, was neither handsome nor smart. Also, his proclivity for rolling around in dead things left him vulnerable to accidentally consuming Mama Ginger\u2019s cobbler. I scooped up two pungent helpings and offered Mama Ginger some coffee, which I needed myself if I were going to socialize at the vampire equivalent of five A.M.</p><p>\u201cWell, isn\u2019t this nice?\u201d Mama Ginger sighed as we pulled stools up to my island countertop. She tucked her fork into the gooey concoction. \u201cWe didn\u2019t really get a chance to talk at the engagement party. And I miss our talks, Jane. So, tell me all about this Gabriel. Tell me all about the man who stole you away from my Zeb.\u201d</p><p>I spluttered my coffee a little while I tried to come up with a palatable explanation of my relationship with Gabriel. \u201cI met him last year, right after I left the library. He\u2019s a very ... interesting man. He\u2019s good to me, very protective. He\u2019s helped me make a lot of big changes in my life ...\u201d</p><p>I have to learn to speak with fewer ellipses.</p><p>\u201cBut what\u2019s he like?\u201d Mama Ginger pressed.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s lived around here his whole life. He likes Zeb a lot, and he\u2019s comfortable with my having a male best friend. We\u2019re a great fit for each other. We practically finish each other\u2019s sentences.\u201d</p><p>Because I\u2019m usually interrupting him.</p><p>\u201cWell, if he\u2019s lived here all of his life, why haven\u2019t I ever met him?\u201d Mama Ginger demanded. \u201cWho are his people? What does he do for a living? How serious is he about the two of you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow, that\u2019s a lot of questions,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just worried about you, Jane.\u201d Mama Ginger tsked, patting my hands. \u201cI don\u2019t want you to settle for some no-good loser with a good line because you\u2019re desperate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not desperate!\u201d I exclaimed.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re thirty\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwenty-eight!\u201d I corrected.</p><p>\u201cAnd at this point, you\u2019ll grab on to anything.\u201d Mama Ginger shrugged.</p><p>I grumbled, \u201cThat is not completely accurate.\u201d</p><p>Mama Ginger demanded, \u201cThen where is Gabriel right now? Why isn\u2019t he here with you?\u201d</p><p>This was a pertinent question, but I wasn\u2019t about to admit that to Mama Ginger. The truth was, I hadn\u2019t seen Gabriel since the engagement party. He was in Lisbon this week, discussing the sale of some residential buildings he owned there. At least, I thought that was what he said in the voice mail he left me the day after the party. He hadn\u2019t picked up his cell phone when I\u2019d called, oh, twenty or so times over the last few days to try to get a better explanation. I even went so far as to call the hotel where he was supposed to be staying, but they didn\u2019t have a Gabriel Nightengale registered. I was clinging to the hope that he\u2019d either changed his plans or registered under some assumed name, such as Mr. I. M. Deceased.</p><p>\u201cGabriel spends a lot of time traveling for work,\u201d I said, choosing my words carefully. \u201cHe owns a lot of different businesses, and he has to look in on them from time to time\u2014\u201d</p><p>Mama Ginger sighed, rolling her heavily shaded eyes at my naivet\u00e9. \u201cOh, honey, my cousin Pam said the same thing about her husband, Claude, and his plumbing-supply business, and then she found out that he had another family over in Butler County. He even gave their sons the same names so he wouldn\u2019t mess up and call the wrong kids to supper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s something I need to worry about. And we don\u2019t have the kind of relationship where we have to see each other every day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, why not? Why doesn\u2019t he want to see you every day?\u201d she demanded. \u201cAren\u2019t you worth that kind of commitment? Where is he going with this? Have you two even talked about marriage?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d I laughed. \u201cWe haven\u2019t talked about getting married.\u201d</p><p>Because state law prohibits it.</p><p>\u201cWell, why not? Tick-tock, tick-tock, Jane. I can hear your biological clock ticking. You don\u2019t have time to waste on some silly little fling that\u2019s not going to go anywhere. If you want to have babies, you have to speed things along.\u201d</p><p>Dang it.</p><p>The finality of vampirism had kept me from thinking about motherhood, or my inability thereof, for a while. Realizing that little Andy and Bradley were to be her only grandchildren, Mama had stopped inquiring after my stalled uterus and devoted her energy to her \u201cgrand-dog,\u201d Fitz. And since I\u2019d been avoiding the church ladies who normally inquired after my reproductive plans, I was no longer thinking defensively. My usual list of responses to \u201cWhen are you having kids?\u201d\u2014including \u201cWhen they come with a return policy\u201d\u2014had long since vacated the tip of my tongue.</p><p>So, faced with the age-old kids question for the first time in months, all I could do was stutter, \u201cWh-Who said anything about having kids?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI always just assumed you wanted them. You were so good with the kids down at the library. They loved you. And Zeb always talked about how much his students liked it when you came in for Fairy Tale Time. I\u2019ve always thought you were built to be a mom. You know, you have those good roomy breeding hips anyway. Might as well put them to good use.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The cracking of my unhinged jaw echoed in the empty kitchen as Mama Ginger resumed munching her dessert. She shrugged and chewed. \u201cI mean, if you don\u2019t have children, what\u2019s the point of being a woman?\u201d</p><p>I think I deserve some sort of karmic reward for not using my vampire strength to pull Mama Ginger\u2019s lip over her head. Obviously, kids weren\u2019t an option. That door closed the moment I swallowed vampire blood. In general, vampires do not make great parents. Our night hours are incompatible with healthy human sleep patterns. It\u2019s hard to discipline a child when they can just run out into the daylight to escape you. And then there\u2019s the whole \u201cnever aging and outliving your children by hundreds of years\u201d thing.</p><p>Parents who have been turned while their children are still minors have to fight fang and nail to retain custody, even when there\u2019s a living parent in the home. And the last legislator who brought an undead adoption-rights bill before Congress was literally laughed out of office.</p> <p>Gripping the countertop in a way that left moon-shaped dents in the surface, I counted to ten and said, \u201cThat\u2019s just\u2014\u201d</p><p>Mama Ginger dropped her fork dramatically and cut me off, \u201cHoney, I just can\u2019t stand it. I have to tell you. A mother\u2019s heart can\u2019t bear to see her son in such pain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cZeb\u2019s in pain?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, sweetie, isn\u2019t it obvious? He only went after Jolene when you hooked up with this Gabriel character. He said he doesn\u2019t see you nearly as often since you met Gabriel, and I know it\u2019s just breaking his heart. Jolene\u2019s just his rebound girl. He\u2019s not in love with her. He\u2019s trying to get back at you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor what?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFor not loving him back!\u201d Mama Ginger cried.</p><p>\u201cZeb doesn\u2019t love me. He loves Jolene,\u201d I said in a slow, deliberate tone one might use with someone who was very dim or slightly drunk. Or both.</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019re the perfect match, you always have been. You have such a long history together. You can\u2019t just throw that away. Hot pants and hormones do not make a marriage. Believe me, honey, I should know. I married for lust, and look what happened to me: a husband who doesn\u2019t talk and in-laws who talk too damn much. What you have, friendship and companionship, that\u2019s what makes a solid, lasting marriage. That\u2019s what is going to make my boy happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease, God, let that be the last time you ever say \u2018hot pants\u2019 in front of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s always been you and Zeb, in my head.\u201d Mama Ginger paused to press her fingers to her temples, as if she were about to peer into a future where I was somehow living and bearing her lots and lots of little Lavelles. \u201cWhenever I pictured Zeb\u2019s wedding, it was always you walking down that aisle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re just not making sense right now,\u201d I told her. \u201cIf you\u2019d just get to know Jolene, you\u2019d see why Zeb loves her so much.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShe\u2019s not you! When you and Zeb are married, we\u2019ll be the perfect, big happy family. You and Zeb can come over for dinner every other night. We\u2019ll go to flea markets on the weekends. And I\u2019m sure Mamaw or Daddy Lavelle would be dead by the time you and Zeb started having babies, so you could move right into one of the trailers behind the house.\u201d</p><p>I think I might have sprained something trying to keep a straight face in response to that. \u201cBut if you really want a mother-in-law/daughter-in-law relationship like that, Jolene would be more than willing to do all of those things with you. She wants to be close to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it won\u2019t be the same. That\u2019s not the way I pictured it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it would be the way Zeb pictures it. I don\u2019t want Zeb. And he doesn\u2019t want me. He wants Jolene. Isn\u2019t it important to let him have some say in choosing his wife?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, he\u2019s a man, he doesn\u2019t know what he wants.\u201d She snorted. \u201cIf I didn\u2019t help him figure out what\u2019s best for him, what kind of mother would I be?\u201d</p><p>The kind of mother whose son doesn\u2019t dodge her calls?</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to see things my way soon enough,\u201d Mama Ginger insisted.</p><p>\u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI just want to help you and Zeb figure some things out, honey,\u201d Mama Ginger said, standing up and hitching her bag over her shoulder. \u201cWell, this was fun, but I\u2019ll just let myself out. I have to go meet with Jolene\u2019s mama over at the Bridal Barn to talk about dresses for the wedding, like I need fashion advice from that dowdy thing. Vonnie\u2019s making some big deal about keeping the shop open late.\u201d</p><p>I stared after her as she toddled toward the back door. She smiled beatifically at me. \u201cIf you ever want to talk, give me a call.\u201d</p><p>I sat at the counter, staring at the untouched oozy layers of pastry on my plate, my head spinning. Aunt Jettie appeared next to the sink, her lips quirked into a sneer.</p><p>\u201cWhat is that?\u201d she asked, pointing at the remains of Mama Ginger\u2019s cobbler. \u201cIt\u2019s like an autopsy with fruit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMama Ginger came calling, to set the alarm on my biological clock. Oh, and to remind me that there\u2019s no point to me being a woman if I never have children.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, if that\u2019s true, I wasted a hell of a lot of money on panty hose and lipstick.\u201d Jettie snorted.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know where this is coming from. Why would she say something like that? And why am I letting it bother me? It\u2019s not like I can just decide to turn my lady parts back on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, honey, don\u2019t you think I heard the same thing my whole life?\u201d she said, stroking her cold, insubstantial fingers down my back. Her voice pitched up two octaves. \u201c \u2018Don\u2019t you know you\u2019re wasting your life? You\u2019re going to end up alone with no one to take care of you when you get old. What makes you think you\u2019re too good to get married and have babies like you\u2019re supposed to?\u2019 Most of that was just your grandma Ruthie. You have to ignore them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut don\u2019t you ever regret it?\u201d I asked. \u201cNot having children of your own?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t need to have children of my own.\u201d She grinned. \u201cI had you. I cared for you, taught you, learned from you. I may not have carried you in my womb, but I always carried you in my heart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I wasn\u2019t thinking about your womb right now, that would have been such a sweet sentiment,\u201d I said, leaning my forehead against her ghostly noggin.</p><p>\u201cDo you feel better now?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cEh.\u201d I waffled my hand. \u201cI\u2019d feel better if I could eat about a gallon of Ben and Jerry\u2019s without vomiting.\u201d</p><p>When Gabriel finally called three days later to let me know he was back in town, I decided it was time for me to take some initiative. With my ever-present fear of being a needy childe, I usually waited around for him to call. But I figured a little manufactured romance was just the thing to get me out of my Mama Ginger-induced funk. I slipped into a silky red T-shirt and jeans and marched out the door to see him. Or at least I would have, had I not opened the door to find Adam Morrow standing on my porch. And because I had a bit of momentum going, I ran smack into him and, in my panic, lifted him by the armpits to move him out of my way.</p><p>\u201cAdam!\u201d I shrieked.</p><p>He made a gurgling sound as I dropped a limp pile of veterinarian onto my porch.</p><p>\u201cAdam, I\u2019m so sorry,\u201d I said, picking him up and settling him back on his feet.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s OK,\u201d he said, clutching a squashed box, which I could now smell was flowers. \u201cIt was kind of cool.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing all the way out here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wanted to see you,\u201d he said, uncrumpling the box and straightening the shiny red bow attached. \u201cAnd I see now that surprising a vampire is not a good idea.\u201d</p><p>I stared at him, my mouth open, gaping like a suffocating goldfish.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I figured out the vampire thing,\u201d he said, a sheepish blush coloring his cheeks. Oh, man, even in the dark, that just made him cuter. \u201cAt the visitation that night, I didn\u2019t see you eat anything. And, well, no one sees you during the day anymore. You don\u2019t have to worry. I won\u2019t tell anyone. I just wanted to\u2014I just wanted to see you. I\u2019ve been thinking about you a lot lately. And I\u2019ve never known a real vampire before.\u201d</p><p>I laughed. \u201cI\u2019m so glad I could be the first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThese are for you,\u201d he said, offering me the mangled box. \u201cIt\u2019s jasmine. I thought you might like it. It\u2019s night-blooming.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was thoughtful,\u201d I told him.</p><p>Adam Morrow brought me flowers. On the checklist of \u201cTeenage Daydreams That Will Probably Never Happen to Me,\u201d that was number one. Now, all I had to do was make out with one of the straight members of \u2018N Sync and star in a movie with Hugh Grant.</p><p>Unsure what to do with the box, I opened the door. A boulder of fur flew at us, giving me a full-on tongue bath. After deeming me sufficiently licked, Fitz turned his attentions to Adam, a strange man in dark clothes standing on our porch. Fitz is adorable in his own hideous way, but as a security system, he\u2019s pretty much useless.</p><p>\u201cHey, boy.\u201d Adam grinned, rubbing Fitz\u2019s muzzle as I led them into the living room. \u201cYou\u2019re just a whole bunch of breeds, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Adam was not my vet, because the idea of spazzing out in front of him every time Fitz needed a checkup was not a happy one. Fitz proved to be a fascinating Mendelian model for him. I guess Adam had never seen a dog with eyes and ears that were each a different color. Fitz leaned into the scratching and let his tongue loll out to full length, useless and prideless.</p><p>\u201cSo, you\u2019re not weirded out at all by this?\u201d I asked, drawing my lips back from my fangs.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he insisted. \u201cLike I said, it\u2019s really interesting. You\u2019ve changed a lot since high school.\u201d</p><p>I snorted. \u201cThat\u2019s an understatement.\u201d</p><p>Aunt Jettie appeared behind Adam and gave me a big thumbs-up. With Adam concentrating on Fitz, I mouthed, \u201cI know!\u201d and shooed her away. Jettie grinned and vanished.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s it like? What\u2019s it like to be a vampire?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cWeird,\u201d I said, looking at him. \u201cPowerful, exciting, and occasionally humiliating, confusing, and painful. It\u2019s sort of like going through puberty all over again. Nothing about my life is the same. But there are some good things. Awesome night vision, for one. I\u2019m still trying to balance things out. I mean, when we were taking those aptitude tests on Career Day, vampirism was not something that came up. I never could have predicted my life turning out this way, but I\u2019ll have the best story at our class reunion.\u201d</p><p>Adam looked up and blurted, \u201cI was wondering if you might want to go to dinner sometime?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t really eat,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cOh, right,\u201d he said, slapping his forehead. \u201cWell, what about coffee? Or we can stay in and watch a movie if you\u2019re more comfortable with that. I\u2019m up for anything. Just\u2014I would like to spend time with you. What are you doing tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was actually heading out to see my friend. The friend I mentioned at the funeral. The ... man friend.\u201d</p><p>Adam\u2019s face fell a little bit. \u201cYou\u2019re not making this easy for me, are you, Jane?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019m supposed to make it easy for you,\u201d I said. \u201cIn fact, when I was a teenager, my mother gave me several lectures on why I shouldn\u2019t make this easy for you.\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cWell, you can\u2019t blame me for trying. Anytime you want to hang out, even if it\u2019s just as friends. I mean, I don\u2019t want to be just friends with you, but I\u2019ll take what I can\u2014I\u2019m not saying this right.\u201d He backed away from me, negotiating the steps without even looking down. \u201cJust call me sometime, please.\u201d</p><p>Giddy little butterflies danced around my belly. I brushed my cheeks with my fingertips and found a big silly grin stretched across my face.</p><p>\u201cAdam Morrow wants to date me,\u201d I told Aunt Jettie, who stood next to me as I watched him drive away. \u201cThat\u2019s weird.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s one very sweet boy.\u201d Jettie nodded. \u201cRespectful, thoughtful, and kind. His mama raised him right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d I sighed, taking the flowers into the kitchen and putting them into one of Jettie\u2019s favorite pressed-glass vases.</p><p>Jettie nodded. \u201cNice ass, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGross.\u201d I shuddered.</p><p>She smirked. \u201cI\u2019m dead, not blind, honey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd still, I say, ew.\u201d I grabbed my purse and slipped into my coat. On a whim, I grabbed Jettie\u2019s old wicker picnic hamper out of the front closet. \u201cI don\u2019t have time for this. I need to go be confused by the man I\u2019m actually dating.\u201d</p><p>As it turned out, Gabriel was the one confused.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d he asked as he opened his front door before I could even knock.</p><p>It was more than the weary tone that had little alarm bells going off in my head. Gabriel\u2019s face was drawn and pinched. His eyes were a dull slate color and lacked the spark I\u2019d come to expect. He looked almost ill. This was more than just traveler\u2019s stress. Something was wrong. But I could tell by his guarded expression that asking would leave me without answers and alone on a perfectly good date night.</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d I said, smiling to hide my worries. \u201cAbsolutely nothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou never come to see me unless you\u2019re angry or something has gone wrong.\u201d</p><p>I gasped, feigning hurt. \u201cThat\u2019s not true.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThe first time you were here, you came storming up my front steps because I\u2019d sent Andrea over to your house. The last time you were here, it was because Zeb and Jolene were on the verge of collapse. We never spend time here. I\u2019m always at your place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know, you\u2019re right. I\u2019m so sorry. I\u2019m terrible at the relationship thing.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cYou just like to be comfortable.\u201d He sniffed slightly, then ran the tip of his nose down my hairline. I took this as a sweet, intimate gesture, until he asked, \u201cWhy do you smell like a German shepherd?\u201d</p><p>I stared at him, thinking maybe this was some sort of bizarre riddle, when I realized Adam\u2019s eau de canine had probably rubbed on me when I\u2019d plowed into him. I blew out a startled laugh. \u201cOh, I ran into an old friend from high school, Adam Morrow. He\u2019s a vet, and he must have had some leftover dog residue on him.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou ran into him on the drive over here?\u201d Gabriel asked.</p><p>\u201cNo, he dropped by the house to say hi, just as I was walking out the door,\u201d I said, the suspicion in his voice setting off my \u201cbabble\u201d response. \u201cIt\u2019s no big deal. It\u2019s really kind of funny. It\u2019s this boy I used to have this huge crush on when were kids, but he never looked twice at me. I was this gawky band geek, and he was the most popular boy in our class. But now that I\u2019ve been turned, and grown out of my braces, I guess he\u2019s interested in me. I told him I was seeing someone. And it\u2019s too little, too late, obviously. I mean, I\u2019m a grown woman, and it was just a silly schoolgirl fantasy crush thing. I\u2019m over him. Completely. Totally. Completely and totally over him.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel grimaced, his features radiating doubt and discomfort. Maybe that second \u201ccompletely and totally\u201d was overselling it.</p><p>\u201cSo, take me on the tour,\u201d I suggested, changing the subject far too enthusiastically. \u201cI\u2019ve only seen two rooms of your house. The parlor and your bedroom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat wasn\u2019t my bedroom,\u201d he said. \u201cThat was a guest room.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou left your fledgling vampire childe to rise in your guest room?\u201d</p><p>His lips twitched, and I could see him slowly coming out of his bad humor. \u201cWhere would you put a fledgling vampire childe to rise?\u201d</p><p>I paused to think about it. \u201cI don\u2019t know. So, show me your bedroom. And I mean that in a perfectly respectable home-tour kind of way.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel\u2019s bedroom was surprising. I\u2019d expected something lavish and baroque. Sort of Henry VIII meets Rudolph Valentino. But the walls were bare, a pale blue edging toward purple, the color of the sky just after dawn. The bed was wide and soft but plain, something you\u2019d order from Ikea and then immediately regret. A thick navy tapestry curtain was pulled back, revealing a broad cushioned window seat, the only seating in the room. And his bathroom featured a shower big enough for six. He specifically mentioned that, which, frankly, worried me.</p><p>I ducked my head into his closet. Black as far as the eye could see. Black T-shirts, black sweaters, black button-down shirts, black slacks, broken up only by occasional splashes of slate gray.</p><p>\u201cYou ever thought about wearing a print?\u201d I asked. \u201cMaybe even a jewel tone? One of the less intense colors. Blue. Green. How about red? We know you like that one. Wait, are you color-blind?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t wear jewel tones,\u201d Gabriel muttered, leading me back out into the bedroom. \u201cOr prints.\u201d</p><p>There were no pictures, no mirrors, nothing on the walls save for a print of Edvard Munch\u2019s Vampire, an ambiguous portrait of a seminude redheaded woman with her arms around and head bent over a dark-haired man. I stood, studying the image with a tilted head. Is he the vampire? Is she? Is he simply a lover seeking comfort at his redhead\u2019s breast? Or are they two humans cowered in the shadow of the dark form looming behind them?</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think of it?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s beautiful and sad and vague,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cYou know, the original title of the painting was Love and Pain,\u201d he said. \u201cAn art critic picked up on the underlying vampiric theme, and the name stuck. Munch experts were and are horrified, but you can\u2019t deny the subconscious imagery.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know, his ears are sort of shaped like yours,\u201d I commented, looking from the slightly pointed painted ovals to Gabriel\u2019s own lobes.</p><p>Gabriel grinned. \u201cThe artist found the back of my head to be quite compelling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, this is an altar to your vanity?\u201d I asked, teasing.</p> <p>\u201cI enjoy the irony. A man interpreting me as a vampire but being told it\u2019s impossible. What brought you rushing to my front door if it wasn\u2019t bad news?\u201d he asked as I pulled him back down the stairs toward the surprise I\u2019d brought for him. He offered more than a little resistance as I pulled him farther and farther from the bedroom.</p><p>\u201cI thought we might actually leave the house for a date. I figured we\u2019ve covered the couch date. You are master of the corner lean and the casual backrub that might lead to something. I thought you might like to up the degree of difficulty. It\u2019s time to leave the comfort of the make-out couch, Gabriel. Let\u2019s go out to see a movie.\u201d</p><p>He arched his eyebrows at me as I pulled him to the foyer.</p><p>\u201cMoving images projected onto a screen in front of a darkened room full of people.\u201d He shot me a withering look. \u201cAnd since I don\u2019t think even your broad horizons are quite ready for the Hollow Cineplex, I thought we would visit the dollar theater.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe dollar theater?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe old two-screen place downtown. They show old movies for a dollar a ticket. It\u2019s sort of a gamble. Sometimes you see the ending, sometimes the film melts. But the seats are cushy, and there\u2019s a lot of ambience.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean the Palladium?\u201d</p><p>I chewed my lip. \u201cI think that\u2019s what the sputtering neon sign says.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Palladium used to be the premier moving-picture palace in this end of the state. I saw my first film there, Casablanca.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou waited until the 1940s to see your first movie?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cI had things to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, now the Palladium is the place where you can buy a bucket of beer with some very stale popcorn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut ... all those humans.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re vampires. If someone talks during the movie, we tear their throats out. Come on, I wore my cute date shoes and everything.\u201d</p><p>He peered down at the strappy black pumps peeking out from my jeans. \u201cYou know I can\u2019t resist you when your toes are exposed,\u201d he grumped.</p><p>\u201cGood, that means wearing open-toed shoes in winter is well worth it. And since we can\u2019t exactly swing by for a pizza on our way into town, I brought you this.\u201d I pulled a very nice bottle of donated Type B-positive, which I knew Gabriel favored, from the picnic basket.</p><p>\u201cVery nice,\u201d he commented, appraising the label. \u201cYour palate is improving.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you. Now let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about drinking this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have a whole thing planned. Just relax that ramrod spine of yours and come with me.\u201d</p><p>I took Gabriel to Memorial Park, a tiny patch of grass in the middle of downtown. It was home to a gazebo flanked by blackened cement statues of famous Civil War veterans from the Hollow, including Waco Marchand, who now served on the local commission for the Council for the Equal Treatment of the Undead. High-school kids posed for pictures in their prom-night finery at the gazebo each spring. But tonight it was abandoned, empty save for the fairy lights strung from the carefully preserved gingerbread eaves. I winked at Gabriel and began unpacking the picnic basket on one of the gazebo\u2019s little wrought-iron benches.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s December,\u201d Gabriel said, staring at me and tucking his coat tighter around his body.</p><p>\u201cWe stay at room temperature,\u201d I reminded him, patting the bench. \u201cBesides, we have twinkly Christmas lights, only available at this time of year. We have a lovely bottle of oaky B-positive. We have grapes and cheese, which, I\u2019ll admit, I bought on the way over to your house strictly because I\u2019ve seen people pack them for fancy wine picnics in movies. We have romance and atmosphere out the ying-yang.\u201d</p><p>He gave me a smile that assured me that he was working hard to humor my girlie romanticism.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m wearing the date shoes,\u201d I reminded him.</p><p>\u201cCurse your sassy toes,\u201d he huffed. \u201cLet me open that. You don\u2019t want to cork it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you implying that a little old thing like me can\u2019t operate something as complicated as a corkscrew?\u201d He grinned at my indignant tone. \u201cOK, you\u2019re right. But that\u2019s not because I\u2019m a woman. It\u2019s because most of the stuff I drank when I was alive involved screw tops.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve always enjoyed your little quirks.\u201d He grunted at the faint pop of the cork coming loose. He carefully poured into the plastic wine glasses that came with the picnic set. \u201cWhat do we drink to?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWorld peace?\u201d I suggested. He grimaced. \u201cTo doing things that normal couples do?\u201d</p><p>He cleared his throat and raised his glass. \u201cTo Mrs. Mavis Stubblefield, without whom we would not be here together tonight.\u201d</p><p>I laughed. \u201cThat\u2019s kind of twisted.\u201d</p><p>He nodded while he sipped. \u201cBut true.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo Mavis Stubblefield, without whom I wouldn\u2019t have been fired, publicly drunk, mistaken for a deer, shot, and turned into a vampire by you,\u201d I conceded, and took a deep drink. Despite my pacifist leanings, I enjoyed the sizzle of human red cells as they zipped through my system. \u201cMaybe I should send her a thank-you note.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe both know that\u2019s not going to happen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlso true,\u201d I admitted, snuggling my head into the crook of his neck.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEnjoying the moment.\u201d I sighed.</p><p>\u201cYou are, without a doubt, the most interesting girl I\u2019ve ever shared a gazebo with,\u201d he murmured, kissing my forehead.</p><p>\u201cInteresting. There\u2019s your favorite word again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think we\u2019ve established how interested I am in you.\u201d He chuckled, kissing me. He sighed when he released me. \u201cI feel as if we haven\u2019t been able to spend much time together lately. I\u2019m sorry business has taken so much of my time.\u201d</p><p>My lips parted, and I could feel the rush of questions gathering. Why wasn\u2019t he answering his phone? Why was he being so uncharacteristically vague about his travels? Where had he been, really? But the evening was so perfect, so relaxed. Again, passages from Sense and Sensibility popped into my head. Elinor almost loses her Edward because she doesn\u2019t speak up and tell him how she feels. She might have ended up alone, but Lucy Steele lets Edward off the hook by eloping with his brother. Would Edward stay in love with Elinor if she pitched a tantrum when he left her at Norland without confirming his feelings? Would making demands and ultimatums confirm that Edward made the right choice in Lucy?</p><p>I was an Elinor, not a Marianne. I didn\u2019t want to waste precious, uninterrupted time together with outbursts or questions that might provoke an argument. So I feinted for a safer topic.</p><p>\u201cIt has helped that I\u2019ve been all about wedding, wedding, and more wedding lately.\u201d I sighed. \u201cTell me how it\u2019s possible that this shindig has taken complete control of my life and I\u2019m not even the one getting married? I\u2019m just a lowly bridesmaid, and yet I\u2019m the one doing cocktail-napkin comparisons and in-law interventions.\u201d</p><p>He mulled that over for a moment. \u201cOh, I saw this in one of those ladies\u2019 magazines you leave scattered around at your house. I think the term is \u2018Bridezilla\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know if I would use the word \u2018Bridezilla.\u2019 It\u2019s not that Jolene\u2019s being all that demanding or ... yeah, were-bride just about covers it,\u201d I admitted. \u201cI don\u2019t know what to do. I just keep getting pulled in. Dress fittings, engagement parties from hell, favor-making parties. It\u2019s not that I don\u2019t have the time, I\u2019m just getting worn out, you know? But I don\u2019t think any of her cousins will do any of this stuff with her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd her fianc\u00e9 has made vague yet disturbing advances toward you and is treating her badly, so you feel incredibly guilty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d I insisted. I looked down into my glass and grumbled, \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a very good friend.\u201d</p><p>I waited for the sage advice he normally dished out in these situations. And got nothing. \u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s all the platitudes I have,\u201d he said. \u201cGenerally, people don\u2019t invite vampires to their weddings, much less make them their undead bridal handmaidens. This is a situation I have never had to deal with.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn more than a century?\u201d He gave me an apologetic look. \u201cWell, that\u2019s disappointing,\u201d I said, looking down at my watch. \u201cWe\u2019d better get going, or we\u2019re going to miss the previews.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought the theater only showed movies that are at least twenty years old. That means the previews are for movies that are twenty years old.\u201d</p><p>I drained the last of my blood. \u201cThere\u2019s a principle at stake here, Gabriel.\u201d</p><p>Since we were sticking to strict dating principles, Gabriel insisted on paying the two-dollar admission. He was a little put off when he saw our options listed on the old-fashioned marquee: Pillow Talk or the 1932 version of Dracula starring Bela Lugosi.</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t that sort of obvious?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cOh, we\u2019ll go see Pillow Talk if you really want to. We\u2019re talking singing, Tony Randall, lots of pastels ...\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Gabriel shuddered. \u201cDracula it is.\u201d</p><p>It was oddly fitting that our first \u201creal date\u201d involved Dracula, considering that our first couch date featured Francis Ford Coppola\u2019s version, which Gabriel still insisted is a comedic spoof on the tale. We took two slightly sprung seats near the rear of the theater and settled in. Seeing the dilapidated state of the theater obviously bothered Gabriel. The gold leaf had worn away from the plaster angels guarding the screen long ago. The red velvet curtain was motheaten and dirty. The balcony railing was studded with generations of grayed chewing gum.</p><p>I narrowed my eyes at him as he squirmed uncomfortably in his seat. \u201cYou\u2019re going to buy this place, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m thinking about it,\u201d he confessed, wiping at a mysterious sticky substance that had transferred itself from the armrest to his hand. \u201cThis is criminal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, if it would keep you in town for a while, I\u2019m all for it. How many of us are in here?\u201d I asked as he scanned the crowd. \u201cCan you tell?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA few,\u201d he admitted. \u201cThis version of Dracula is one of the few movie adaptations that vampires find generally palatable. The main character is powerful yet somewhat sympathetic.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel looked nervous as he continued to scan the crowd.</p><p>\u201cYou OK?\u201d I asked.</p> <p>\u201cFine.\u201d He smiled. \u201cSo, what is the procedure for a movie date?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, we sit here, not touching until the lights go out. Eventually, we\u2019ll bump knees or fight for elbow-rest dominance. If we ate popcorn, we might pay an incredibly exorbitant amount of money for a bucket to keep between us so our hands could occasionally brush against each other as we reached for bites. If you were a total pervert, you\u2019d cut a hole in the bottom of the bucket ... never mind.\u201d He shot me a questioning glance. \u201cThere\u2019s also the yawn maneuver, which we\u2019ve covered in previous sessions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcuse me for a minute.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel walked out of the theater, leaving me to look over the crowd. Most of them were older couples, people who might have seen the original theater run when they were children. There were a few teenagers in goth regalia, some of whom I recognized as skateboarders I\u2019d had to chase away from the shop. If there were vampires here, I couldn\u2019t spot them. Gabriel came back carrying an obscenely large tub of popcorn.</p><p>\u201cDid you know that butter comes in a liquid chemical form?\u201d he asked, grinning over the oil-slicked kernels.</p><p>\u201cBut we can\u2019t eat it.\u201d I giggled as he set the tub between us.</p> <p>\u201cYou said this is what people do on dates. I wanted to do this right.\u201d</p><p>I grabbed his face between my palms and kissed him good. This was the Gabriel I\u2019d fallen for. I could put up with the uncertainty, the brain-wracking questions, for just a little taste of this kind of happiness.</p><p>\u201cAre we skipping the popcorn hand-brushing thing?\u201d he asked, between nips on my lips.</p><p>\u201cHey! Go get a room!\u201d bellowed a loud male voice behind us. Gabriel glared over my head at the elderly hall monitor. I giggled as he stood up and headed in the guy\u2019s direction.</p><p>\u201cSit down,\u201d I told him.</p><p>Gabriel glared at the loudmouth. \u201cBut that was very rude.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all part of the experience.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel mastered the yawn move and the knee squeeze and was well on his way to the around-the-shoulder chest grab by the time the credits rolled. As we left the theater, he talked animatedly about seeing Bela Lugosi play Dracula in the original Broadway play.</p> <p>\u201cBut I must admit that his screen performance was even more compelling. It\u2019s fascinating that they managed to film his eyes as ours appear, as if lit from within.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe had help. The cinematographer shone little pinpoint spotlights into his eyes during filming. It was the cheapest, most effective way to get the effect. Did you know that there was a Spanish-language version of the movie shot at night on the same set with different actors?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but it makes sense that you do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, what did you think of dating outside our homes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt reminded me of my youth. Being close to a beautiful woman I wanted desperately to touch and not being able to,\u201d he said, winding his arms around me as he led me to his car.</p><p>I chewed my lip and made a pouty face. \u201cWas there a good-looking woman sitting next to us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you ever going to just take a compliment and not turn it into a joke?\u201d</p><p>I considered for a moment and shook my head. \u201cNot likely, no.\u201d</p><p>We had a few blocks to walk before reaching the car. It was a beautiful night, and I was enjoying strolling down a downtown sidewalk arm in arm with a handsome man. The downtown area was an odd mix of beautifully refurbished buildings and abandoned storefronts. One of those lovingly restored buldings contained the Coffee Spot, a Hollow institution known for bad java and unbelievable pecan pie. My father and I used to make up errands on Saturday mornings, then hide out at the Coffee Spot and eat cheese fries. From across the street, I peered through the window, smiling at the memory of Mama demanding to know how Daddy had gotten melted Velveeta on his shirt during a trip to the hardware store. I was about to seize an opportunity to share a nondisturbing experience from my human years with Gabriel, when I recognized two faces in a front booth. It was Mama Ginger and my synapse-slapping senior friend, Esther Barnes.</p><p>\u201cWhat the?\u201d</p><p>I couldn\u2019t step closer to the window for fear of Mama Ginger\u2019s internal Jane-tracking device going off. Instead, I ducked behind a nearby car and squinted at them. Really hard.</p><p>\u201cJane?\u201d Gabriel grinned, staring down at me. \u201cWhat are you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShhh!\u201d I hissed, pulling at his coat and making him crouch next to me.</p><p>\u201cThis seems unnecessary,\u201d Gabriel grumbled, frowning as I shushed him again. \u201cWe will discuss the shushing later.\u201d</p><p>Framed by the coffee shop\u2019s logo in the window, Mama Ginger and Esther seemed to be arguing. Knowing Mama Ginger, this was not unexpected. She\u2019d once started a fistfight at a Relay for Life meeting over whether her card club\u2019s booth should be luau- or casino-themed.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t hear through the glass, but both Esther and Mama Ginger talked with their hands. Esther was pointing one of her long, bony fingers at Mama Ginger and then made a gesture that meant \u201cMore money\u201d or \u201cI need moisturizer.\u201d Mama Ginger was shaking her head and seemed to be saying, \u201cI need it sooner.\u201d</p><p>I tried to zero in on Mama Ginger\u2019s thoughts but heard only white noise. I looked up to Gabriel, who was sticking a finger in his ear and seemed to be trying to pop some pressure loose.</p><p>\u201cYou, too?\u201d I asked, narrowing my gaze at the septuagenarian psychic. Maybe Esther\u2019s psychic presence acted like some sort of scrambler, keeping both of us from reading the people around her. I clutched a fist and shook it at her. \u201cEsther Barnes.\u201d</p><p>I watched their conversation for a few more minutes, culminating in Esther\u2019s threatening to get up and leave. Mama Ginger made placating gestures and finally broke out her wallet. She slid some cash across the table, which Esther counted. Twice.</p><p>I waited for either of them to get up and leave. Maybe if I could get Mama Ginger alone, I could ask her a few questions about Esther. But they wouldn\u2019t budge. They both seemed determined to win some sort of impromptu pie-eating contest.</p><p>Sighing in exasperation at my own suspicious nature, I stood up, turned my back on the scene, and brushed off my coat. More than likely, all I was witnessing was some sort of illegal transaction involving unlicensed Precious Moments figurines.</p><p>\u201cCan we stop skulking now?\u201d Gabriel asked.</p><p>I nodded and quickly led him away before Mama Ginger could spot us.</p><p>\u201cIs everything OK?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. That woman that Mama Ginger\u2019s talking to, she walked into the shop the other night and ... well, she smacked my brain around in a psychic sense. I don\u2019t like that she and Mama Ginger are talking. The two of them joining forces cannot possibly be good for Zeb ... or mankind, in general.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel nodded solemnly. \u201cAgreed.\u201d</p><p>I put my arm through Gabriel\u2019s and tried to resuscitate our date night as we walked away. \u201cDid I ever tell you that my dad and I used to go to that coffee shop every weekend?\u201d</p><p>8</p><p>Werewolves look for three key components in a mate: ability to hunt, viable genes, and a sense of humor.</p><p>\u2014Mating Rituals and Love Customs of the Were</p><p>I shouldn\u2019t have told Mama to Photoshop me into the family Christmas picture. She\u2019d found some photo kiosk at the mall and cropped in a picture from three Christmases ago, taken just after I\u2019d had minor dental surgery. With eyes both red and bleary, I was wobbling near the rear of the tree attempting to hang an angel ornament in midair. Everyone else in the family is smiling and looking at the camera (with this year\u2019s hair), and I was copied and pasted into a corner as if my top half was springing out of the tree. Mama sent it to 120 of our nearest and dearest, including Zeb.</p><p>\u201cIt looks like Christmas Night of the Living Dead!\u201d he hooted.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s incredibly culturally insensitive,\u201d I muttered. \u201cSee if I invite you to my Christmas party.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAw, sweetie, you know it\u2019s not Christmas without us watching A Christmas Story until one of us passes out.\u201d</p><p>Zeb and I usually spent Christmas Eve together. He could only handle so much of his parents and used me as a reason to get away. We would hoard as much peanut-butter fudge and sausage balls as possible, then hide out at Zeb\u2019s place to watch Christmas movies. Gifts were exchanged, relatives were avoided. God bless us every one.</p><p>But this year, we were having \u201cA Holly Jolly Undead Christmas\u201d at River Oaks. Gabriel had promised to be there, which was fortunate, because I\u2019d found the perfect present for him. Zeb was bringing Jolene, as Mama Ginger had made it clear that she was not welcome at the Lavelle family Christmas. Andrea was coming, which meant Dick would be there, even though he said he had plans that night. Fred and Jettie would try to fit us into their busy holiday schedule. Of course, Mr. Wainwright would be there. He was eager to question Jolene about her family.</p><p>River Oaks hadn\u2019t been opened for a big party since the Great Depression, when Great-great-great-grandpa Early lost a good portion of the family fortune in oil speculation in Florida. It was the first adult party I\u2019d ever hosted, with real hors d\u2019oeuvres and fancy clothes. I\u2019d put up a real spruce tree and brought out all of the old glass ornaments. I hung fairy lights from every stationary object in the house. I lit a couple dozen good vanilla-scented candles and then blew half of them out. Having a lot of open flames around highly flammable guests was surely the mark of an inconsiderate hostess.</p><p>Jolene promised to handle the human food, which was fortunate, since I think my stove had atrophied from disuse. Jolene said it just didn\u2019t seem fair to make me cook stuff I couldn\u2019t eat. I asked if she could put that in writing and send it to my mama.</p><p>Jolene was also providing a crock pot full of cow\u2019s blood from her farm, for the undead guests. I thought about adding spices to make it sort of a mulled-wine thing, but Mr. Wainwright advised strongly against it. He even gave me a book titled Elegant Undead Entertaining. Based on the \u201cFoods That Vampires Can Prepare without Becoming Nauseated\u201d menu, I was providing crackers and cheese, fancy cookies, and sparkling cider and thanked the ever-patient, ever-generous officials of the Visa corporation, for providing the groceries.</p><p>With the tree, the candles, and the scent of blood warming in the crock pot, the house smelled wonderfully of home and hearth. (My standards have changed a bit.) All that was left was for me to run around like a crazy person double- and triple-checking everything.</p><p>Pretty decorations? Check. Good food? Check. Not telling Mama about it? Check. It was the recipe for the perfect party.</p><p>And what else would a vampire wear to a Christmas party but a blood-red cocktail dress?</p><p>It was perfect, fabulous even, maybe the most flattering dress I\u2019d ever worn. Cinched at the waist with a scarlet sash and a rhinestone poinsettia brooch, the luscious, floaty material fell in a perfect bell around my knees. I even broke the Curse of Bridesmaid Shoe Past, finally finding a use for those sassy pomegranate-dyed pumps.</p><p>Believe it or not, I found the dress in Aunt Jettie\u2019s closet. Jettie wasn\u2019t always a sweatsuit fanatic. She was quite the sharp dresser before she declared open rebellion against foundation garments. And fortunately, we were both tall, \u201cathletically\u201d built girls. And it smelled nothing like mothballs, so double points for me.</p><p>\u201cEverything looks wonderful, honey,\u201d Jettie said as I changed the CD in the stereo for the fourteenth time. I have no centralized music taste. I listen to an alarming amount of Sarah McLachlan, the DefTones, and the Red Hot Chili Peppers. Musically, I kind of got stuck in the 1990s. Gabriel called my CD collection \u201cpedantic.\u201d I think he forgot he was dealing with someone who knew what \u201cpedantic\u201d means.</p><p>Unfortunately, my pedantic collection did not include any Christmas music, so we had a choice between celebrating the birth of baby Christ with \u201cSuck My Kiss\u201d or a Lilith Fair concert recording. Neither felt appropriate, so I settled for the regional NPR station\u2019s broadcast of Handel\u2019s Messiah.</p><p>\u201cMaybe I should rearrange the\u2014\u201d I turned toward the candles.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t!\u201d Jettie cried. \u201cHoney, they\u2019re perfect. And it\u2019s not good for you to handle candles too much.\u201d I relented, and she stepped back, motioning for me to raise my arms. \u201cNow, let me see you. That dress never looked that good on me.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cFibber.\u201d I rolled my eyes.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know any one-word insults for false modesty, but I\u2019ll come up with one,\u201d she said. \u201cIn the meantime, sit, catch your breath, er, relax. Enjoy this quiet time when the house looks perfect and you look beautiful and no one is frazzled or complaining that they can\u2019t eat anything because of their lactose intolerance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s lovely,\u201d I said. \u201cWhich shelter magazine did you get that from?\u201d</p> <p>She grinned. \u201cOriginal material. Now, I\u2019m going to go stare at the cheese and crackers and long for days gone by.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou and me both,\u201d I muttered as someone or something battered at my kitchen door. Jolene, werewolf strength abounding, threw open the door with her hip and lugged a Coleman chest cooler into my kitchen.</p><p>\u201cEither that\u2019s a lot of food or you\u2019re planning a really cheap funeral in my backyard,\u201d I said, eyeing the mansized cooler.</p><p>Zeb hefted a tray of mini-quiches onto my counter. \u201cGiven your luck this year, do you think you should be joking about that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDuly noted,\u201d I said as Jolene unpacked a ham, mashed potatoes, stuffing, rolls, and what looked like a twenty-pound deep-fried turkey. \u201cHow many people are you planning to feed?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMe, Zeb, Mr. Wainwright, your friend Andrea ...\u201d she said, ticking off on her fingers. \u201cDo you think I brought enough?\u201d</p><p>I held up a two-gallon Tupperware container of yams. \u201cWell, if nothing else, I have some pot pies in my freezer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have more pot pies?\u201d Jolene cried, looking at the freezer with longing.</p><p>\u201cNow you went and ruined her Christmas present.\u201d Zeb grinned.</p><p>Gabriel came to the door looking almost festive. He was wearing a dark blue scarf, which may have been the only time I\u2019d ever seen him wear an actual color. He was also carrying a load of packages, several bottles, and a bright pink bakery box.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re all coiffed,\u201d he said, clearly shocked.</p> <p>\u201cI am capable of cleaning up nice,\u201d I said grumpily.</p><p>\u201cVery nice.\u201d He nodded and gave me a friendly peck.</p><p>\u201cThat was just sad,\u201d a voice behind us drawled. We turned to see Dick, radiant in a holly-green T-shirt that said, \u201cJoin me on the naughty list,\u201d carrying presents, a bottle of Boone\u2019s Farm, and a sprig of mistletoe. \u201cI\u2019ve seen old people kiss better than that. Aunt Jettie is kissing Fred better than that right now.\u201d</p><p>In honor of the occasion, Jettie and Fred had agreed to let all of the guests see them. I turned to my living room to find that Grandpa Fred had materialized and was, indeed, kissing Aunt Jettie like a character in an old World War II movie.</p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s just embarrassing,\u201d I said, pushing Gabriel\u2019s packages into Dick\u2019s hands and laying a hell of a smooch on my special vampire fella. \u201cHappy now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBlech, no.\u201d Dick grimaced. \u201cIt\u2019s like watching your parents make out.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel set his jaw and advanced on Dick.</p><p>\u201cOK, River Oaks is neutral ground, you both promised,\u201d I said, standing between the two of them. \u201cGabriel, please go inside. Help Jolene unpack her movable feast.\u201d</p> <p>I turned on Dick. \u201cI thought you had plans,\u201d I said, leaning against the door and smirking at him.</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, they fell through. I figured, why not throw you a bone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just not responding to that imagery,\u201d I said as I accepted what could only be termed wine in the strictest sense of the word. \u201cBut I\u2019m glad you\u2019re here. Merry Christmas, Dick. You have just enough time to go inside and look cool and unaffected when Andrea comes in.\u201d</p><p>Dick perked up.</p><p>\u201cBut first, a few ground rules. No \u2018ho, ho, ho\u2019 jokes. That shirt is the only \u2018naughty\u2019 reference you\u2019re allowed tonight. And keep the mistletoe where I can see it,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cWell, tie my hands, why don\u2019t you?\u201d he grumbled, then scrambled to get inside when he saw Andrea\u2019s car pull onto my drive.</p><p>Andrea had volunteered to drive Mr. Wainwright, whose night vision was not what it once was. Neither was his day vision, for that matter. It took Gabriel and me to help him up the steps, but he was determined to carry his own presents and the jar of potpourri he had brought as a hostess gift.</p><p>At least, I hoped it was potpourri.</p><p>Oddly enough, the first person he greeted when he walked into the living room was my Aunt Jettie, who was confused but flattered. \u201cHe can see me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can see her?\u201d I asked. \u201cI thought vampires were the only ones who could see you; when you decided to grace us with your presence, that is.\u201d</p><p>Mr. Wainwright chuckled. \u201cWell of course, I can see her, she\u2019s standing right there. She\u2019s a bit transparent but still visible to those who have a ... broader personal perspective.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJettie Early, meet my boss, Gilbert Wainwright,\u201d I said. \u201cMr. Wainwright, my late great-aunt Jettie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCharmed,\u201d he said. I noticed he didn\u2019t offer to shake her hand, an effort to avoid calling attention to the fact that she was noncorporeal.</p><p>\u201cJane\u2019s told me so much about you,\u201d Jettie said, smiling sweetly. \u201cI\u2019m so glad she\u2019s found such a wonderfully interesting person to work for.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, she is a pleasure to have at the store,\u201d he assured her. \u201cShe has revolutionized our filing system.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe said you didn\u2019t have a filing system before she was hired,\u201d Jettie pointed out. My gaze shifted from my aunt to my employer. Did Aunt Jettie just giggle in a coquettish manner, drawing a suspicious look from my dead step-grandpa? Mr. Wainwright chuckled again and adjusted his suspenders.</p><p>My dead aunt was flirting with my boss. My dead aunt who was practically engaged to my dead step-grandfather. And my boss appeared to be flirting back. This could go nowhere good.</p><p>They started talking and realized they\u2019d gone to high school together. They were in the last class to graduate from the original Half-Moon Hollow High before Milton \u201cFirebug\u201d Chambers burned it to the ground. They reminisced about Mr. Allan, the math teacher who spoke in the third person; the design of the first-ever Half-Moon Howler mascot costume; and Milton\u2019s multiple failed attempts at burning the school down before he got it right. Mr. Wainwright asked Aunt Jettie about her demise and how the \u201ctunnel of light\u201d appeared to her. Jettie laughed uproariously and told him it was more like a tornado. Eager to catch every detail, he asked Jettie to meet him at his office sometime, where he could interview her properly.</p><p>Grandpa Fred was not pleased. Fortunately, he couldn\u2019t solve this problem as he did when Grandma Ruthie drove him crazy during his living Christmases: drinking buttered rum until he was near comatose, forcing my dad and I to cart him, Barcalounger and all, out to the car.</p><p>It\u2019s awkward introducing two groups of friends. It\u2019s even more awkward when one of those groups decides not to like the other. While Mr. Wainwright was thrilled to be acquainted or reacquainted with the supernatural beings, Jolene had taken an instant dislike to Andrea. A few minutes after the two of them gingerly shook hands, Jolene pulled me into the kitchen to whisper at a decibel far below human hearing that she didn\u2019t trust her.</p><p>\u201cI trust Andrea,\u201d I said. \u201cShe\u2019s been a really good friend to me. You\u2019re just used to being the prettiest girl in the room, and having someone who remotely rivals your blinding hotness is throwing you off your game. And we don\u2019t have to whisper. Andrea\u2019s perfectly normal hearing is not going to pick up this conversation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just sayin\u2019 one girl to another, I think you need to watch her around Gabriel,\u201d Jolene said, grabbing a hunk of cheddar and chowing down. Around the cheese, she said, \u201cA lot of girls, especially wounded human girls, go for the whole mysterious, dark-haired guy with the full lips, piercing soulful eyes, cheekbones you could slice a ham with\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe I should watch you around Gabriel,\u201d I said, eyeing her warily. \u201cI think we should get back into the living room with your lovely canap\u00e9s before everybody else figures out that we\u2019re talking about one of them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right, I\u2019m bein\u2019 silly,\u201d Jolene said, watching Zeb try one of Mr. Wainwright\u2019s cigars, then get pounded on the back when he started to choke. \u201cI just want everybody to be as happy as Zeb and me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLovebirds on amphetamines couldn\u2019t be happier than you two,\u201d I said, linking arms with her.</p><p>She sighed, leaning her head against mine. \u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>I lingered and watched the party from the kitchen doorway. Someone, mercifully, had dug up a Nat King Cole CD. Even over the bluesy cheer, I could hear Andrea and Zeb chatting about the merits of being the only \u201cnormals\u201d in the room. They didn\u2019t consider Mr. Wainwright to be normal. Jolene swept in and marked her territory by kissing Zeb\u2019s cheek and pulling him away from Andrea. Gabriel and Mr. Wainwright discussed Gabriel\u2019s library and its shocking lack of information on freshwater sea monsters, until Dick distracted Gabriel by mentioning all of the parties they used to attend at River Oaks. Gabriel sent a furtive look my way. I think he offered Dick money not to reminisce further. Mr. Wainwright then engaged Dick in adamant conversation regarding the sales of were-pelts on the black market. Dick was smiling at him in a way I didn\u2019t normally see. It was almost tender. And it was weirding me out.</p><p>\u201cPlease, in the name of Christmas, don\u2019t let Dick try to sell him anything,\u201d I asked, looking skyward.</p><p>Fortunately, Andrea passed by in her slinky black party dress, and Dick\u2019s attention shifted gears. Mr. Wainwright grinned as Dick trailed after her. He made eye contact with Aunt Jettie, rolled his eyes, and muttered, \u201cYoung people.\u201d Aunt Jettie gave a girlish giggle, which got Grandpa Fred\u2019s back up.</p><p>Andrea heard Mr. Wainwright\u2019s side of the conversation and tapped me on the shoulder.</p><p>\u201cIs Mr. Wainwright talking to himself again?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cNope. Aunt Jettie. I think he might have a little bit of a crush going. This is going to be a big shock for Grandpa Fred. This may be the love triangle that undoes the fabric of our universe.\u201d</p><p>She cringed. Gabriel sauntered my way, offering me a punch cup of an imported dessert blood called Sangre.</p><p>\u201cYou throw a great party,\u201d Gabriel said, nodding at the happy crowd.</p><p>\u201cGod bless us everyone,\u201d I said, grinning. \u201cThis may actually be the best Christmas ever. People I love. No pressure. No drunk cousins fistfighting on the lawn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m sure that\u2019s an interesting story that I\u2019ll ask about later.\u201d He cringed before calling across the room, \u201cWhile we\u2019re on the subject of families, Zeb, can you tell me why your mother has been leaving me increasingly threatening voice-mail messages? She plans to put her foot, among other things, up several orifices.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI honestly don\u2019t know,\u201d Zeb said. \u201cIt\u2019s possible she just dialed a random number. Sometimes she leaves those messages for strangers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I know,\u201d I said, sighing. \u201cZeb\u2019s mama seems to think you\u2019re the only obstacle standing between me and Zeb, true love, and some sort of Precious Moments wedding extravaganza.\u201d</p><p>Zeb seemed stunned but not nearly as disturbed by this as I was. He smiled at me with that weird, glazed-over stare, which was becoming way too familiar. I moved closer to Gabriel, twining my fingers through his. \u201cYou might want to keep your doors locked during the day, Gabriel. Also, cover your butt, because what she has planned would sting a little.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think Mama would actually do anything,\u201d Zeb assured me, his voice low and soft.</p><p>\u201cEasy for you to say,\u201d I told Zeb. \u201cIt\u2019s not your orifices at stake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd on that lovely Yuletide note, I have something for you,\u201d Gabriel said, leading me closer to the lights of the Christmas tree before handing me a small silver-wrapped package. With visions of jewelry dancing in my head, I opened it to find a little canister with a plastic trigger. \u201cMace?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope, silver in aerosol form,\u201d he said proudly. \u201cTo prevent further parking-lot fights. Just don\u2019t stand downwind when you use it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, how thoughtful,\u201d I said, lifting it carefully from the box. With all the enthusiasm I could scrape together, I told him, \u201cIt\u2019s really, really great.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a gag gift,\u201d he said crossly. \u201cZeb said you\u2019d find this kind of thing funny. Lift up the tissue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cZeb has spent most of his adult years playing GameBoy alone on Friday nights,\u201d I said, rooting to the bottom of the box. \u201cDon\u2019t take relationship advice from Zeb.\u201d</p><p>In the bottom of the box was a tissue-wrapped bundle. It was a little silver unicorn on a fine chain.</p><p>\u201cAndrea said that paying homage to a little quirk in your personality, the closet unicorn obsession, would show that I care,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cIt really does,\u201d I told him. \u201cCan I touch it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt would be a good first step toward wearing it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it\u2019s silver,\u201d I said, hooking a tissue-protected finger around the clasp.</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s white gold,\u201d he said as he looped the chain around my neck. \u201cPerfectly safe for vampires.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll of the beauty of silver without the burning and itching,\u201d I cooed, running my fingers over the curves of the unicorn\u2019s tiny legs.</p><p>\u201cDoes that mean \u2018thank you\u2019 in your language?\u201d he asked, tilting his head.</p><p>\u201cThank you, it\u2019s very sweet,\u201d I said, kissing him. \u201cThis is a wonderful coincidence, because I have this for you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Across the room, Zeb was making a sour face. Jolene jostled his arm, attempting to tease the scowl from him, but he shook her off, stalking toward the kitchen and out of sight. She stared after him, her face twisted into confused, hurt lines. Dick saw this and asked some random question about his responsibilities as \u201cthe man of honor\u201d and how it related to cummerbund color, teasing her into a smile.</p><p>I handed Gabriel a square package. \u201cI was sorting through some old family photos with Aunt Jettie. We found this.\u201d</p><p>Jettie and I spent hours looking through old boxes of River Oaks tintypes when I was a little girl. We would study the sepia-toned photos of Earlys from the 1870s and comment on the clothes, the hairstyles, who looked like toothless Uncle Vernon. (Somehow, we always voted for Grandma Ruthie.) Jettie would tell me stories about my ancestors, such as Great-great-great-grandma Lula, who set fire to the Hollow\u2019s only cathouse after finding her husband, the Reverend James Early, \u201cproselytizing\u201d there. The fire took out the cathouse, a nearby saloon, and the general store, where the owner sold dirty French pictures from the back room. She did more good in forty-five minutes with an oil lamp than Reverend Early did in thirty-five years of preaching.</p> <p>We\u2019re a proud family.</p><p>On a recent trip down Disturbing Genealogical Memory Lane, Jettie and I found portraits from Clarissa and Stewart Early\u2019s wedding in 1877. In one smaller photo, two young Early cousins, Leah and Mariah, were shown smiling up at two strapping fellows in silk coats. I had seen this photo a hundred times before I was turned. Until now, I hadn\u2019t recognized the young men being adored by my simpering foremothers: Dick and Gabriel, grinning like mad at the camera. They were so young. And Dick actually had his arm around Gabriel\u2019s shoulders, laughing as if he had just told some raunchy joke.</p><p>I\u2019d taken the photos to a camera shop to have copies of the print made. I\u2019d framed one for Gabriel and one for Dick. It was not a manipulative Parent Trap ploy; I honestly couldn\u2019t think of anything else to get them.</p><p>\u201cI remember this day,\u201d Gabriel said, grinning. \u201cThis was right before Dick persuaded your cousins to go skinnydip\u2014\u201d He caught sight of my raised eyebrows. \u201cUm, never mind.\u201d</p><p>Dick came to peer over Gabriel\u2019s shoulder. \u201cLeah and Mariah, twins in every sense of the word.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDid you leave any of my cousins untouched?\u201d I cried, remembering Dick\u2019s \u201cfondness\u201d for my ancestor, cousin Cessie.</p><p>Dick guffawed. \u201cHey, Gabriel\u2019s the one who\u2014\u201d Gabriel narrowed his eyes at Dick. \u201cNever mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHorrifying revelations and the confirmation that some of my relatives are/were publicly nude. You know, suddenly, this has become like Christmas with my family. Thanks,\u201d I said, patting them on the back.</p><p>Gabriel\u2019s cell phone sounded. OK, so it wasn\u2019t the most mature thing to do, but I snuck a look at the caller ID. It read \u201cJeanine.\u201d I didn\u2019t know any Jeanine. Gabriel had never mentioned a Jeanine. Who the hell was Jeanine?</p><p>I practically chewed through my tongue to keep from commenting. He took the call outside. And, I\u2019m ashamed to say, I sort of lurked around the door to try to overhear. But he stepped off the porch, out of my range of hearing through the glass.</p><p>Defeated, I turned to the eating crowd. \u201cWho\u2019s ready for dinner?\u201d</p> <p>Jolene wasn\u2019t the only one who could plan a tablescape. I had clear glass bowls of various sizes filled with vanilla candles and cranberries, Great-grandma Early\u2019s wedding tablecloth, and the good china with the delicate silver ivy pattern. I was going for a Good Housekeeping look, which tends to be less angry than Martha Stewart Living. I used gloves to set out silver place settings for the humans.</p><p>\u201cYou spent six hours setting a table for food you can\u2019t eat,\u201d Zeb marveled. He took it upon himself to \u201cescort\u201d me to the table, since Gabriel was otherwise occupied.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s my first vampire Christmas,\u201d I said. \u201cI still want to enjoy dinner.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel appeared at my right, ready to seat me, and seemed a little put off when Zeb did not relinquish my hand or take the seat I\u2019d assigned him across from Jolene. He seemed intent on sitting next to me, forcing Gabriel to sit next to a confused werewolf bride-to-be.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m surprised you didn\u2019t mix eggnog in your blood,\u201d snorted Dick.</p><p>\u201cJane\u2019s firmly antinog in all its forms,\u201d Zeb told him, pulling out my chair.</p><p>Caught off-guard by Zeb\u2019s clueless move, I made a quick comment along the lines of \u201cEggs, milk, and rum should not be mixed unless it\u2019s in cake batter,\u201d and asked Mr. Wainwright to pour the blood.</p><p>Gabriel\u2019s contribution turned out to be pastry shells filled with a jiggly pink mousse. I might have suffered from dessert envy, but the filling smelled vaguely of cat food. Gabriel told Jolene he\u2019d gotten them from a bakery downtown that she was familiar with. She was clearly delighted, eating three of them before Zeb could take a tentative bite.</p> <p>Zeb made a gagging sound he hadn\u2019t uttered since his dad made him try chitterlings, then spat the pastry in his napkin.</p><p>\u201cWhat exactly is this?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cHeart mousse tarts,\u201d Jolene said, moaning the way I used to over cheesecake.</p><p>\u201cBeef heart, to be exact,\u201d Gabriel said cheerfully, watching Jolene devour her fourth.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re a real delicacy,\u201d Jolene told Zeb. \u201cWe only get these at Christmas.\u201d</p><p>Zeb wiped his tongue with his napkin and smiled wanly at Jolene. \u201cI\u2019ll finish mine later.\u201d</p><p>9</p><p>Werewolves are also territorial about holiday time. It would be unwise for a human to underestimate her werewolf mother-in-law\u2019s desire to see her son on Thanksgiving and Christmas Day.</p><p>\u2014Mating Rituals and Love Customs of the Were</p><p>I didn\u2019t invite Gabriel to Christmas with my family. Because I don\u2019t do that to people I like.</p><p>Grandma Ruthie spent every Christmas Eve neck-deep in nog, feeling at liberty to tell me exactly what she thought was wrong with my life and which of my poor choices had led me there. One particularly memorable holiday, in 2004, she offered to pay for plastic surgery, a total tune-up, including boobs, nose, teeth, and a little reconstruction to \u201csoften my mannish features.\u201d While generous, this offer kept me from coming to Christmas 2005.</p><p>And just as on Christmas 2005, Mama had not responded well to my skipping out on this year\u2019s family festivities. Thanksgiving was spent with Mama\u2019s extended family. I was allowed to skip it this year because the family preferred to eat lunch together, and an afternoon of watching other people eat just wasn\u2019t worth the risk of spontaneous combustion. Mama made some lame excuse to the uncles about my needing to get the bookstore ready for the Black Friday shopping rush, which seemed to satisfy everybody.</p><p>Christmas, however, belonged to Mama. There was the prolonged Christmas Eve gathering in which Mama, Daddy, myself, Jenny, and her spawn, plus Grandma and that year\u2019s grandpa exchanged presents. We then enjoyed the traditional Jameson meal of turkey, stuffing, and a piping-hot side dish of guilt-stuffed manipulation. Unmarried and childless (read: pathetic, with no place to go), I usually slept at my parents\u2019 house and spent Christmas morning with them. I was one step away from wearing footie pajamas.</p><p>Jenny and her boys, loaded up with sugar and obnoxiously noisy toys, usually arrived at around 6 P.M., and we were stuck together in family harmony until Mama decided to warm up leftovers for dinner and parole us until next year.</p><p>I had already violated the sanctity of Christmas Eve by spending it with people who actually liked me, so avoiding my family on Christmas night this year was not an option. I showed up at sundown and gave myself a forty-five-minute window to duck out before anyone arrived for the warmed-over feast. Mama got her usual bottle of Windsong, which she asked for every year. I gave Daddy a book on the haunted battlefields of Kentucky, which Mr. Wainwright recommended. I got slipper socks and a copy of The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People.</p><p>The house seemed even more quiet than usual, the gaps in conversation echoing just how much my estrangement from Jenny was putting a strain on my parents\u2019 holiday. Mama did, however, manage to mention how much everybody missed me on Christmas Eve and that it would be so much easier if I just stayed for dinner. About twenty times.</p><p>By easier, I\u2019m pretty sure Mama meant easier for her. It was easier for her not to have to address my issues with my sister, such as the fact that Jenny had helped Missy the psychotic real estate agent by (albeit unwittingly) feeding her information about my schedule, River Oaks, and all manner of things that helped her harass me and frame me for murder. Oh, and the lawsuit she filed against me.</p><p>That sort of discussion can put a real damper on Baby Jesus\u2019 birthday.</p><p>While Mama started preparations for re-dinner, I think I lost track of time talking to my dad about the possibility of tracing Mr. Wainwright\u2019s family. Normally, I can sense my grandma\u2019s approaching presence, like Bambi\u2019s mom sensing when Man has entered the forest. I was caught off-guard in both senses, when Grandma Ruthie arrived with her newest catch, the aforementioned Wilbur.</p><p>They say the mourning period for a relationship is at least one-half of the time that was spent in the relationship. Grandma had reduced it to her shortest time ever, one-twenty-seventh of the relationship.</p><p>I smelled Wilbur long before I saw him. This went well beyond your typical old-man aroma. This was rot, decay, mold, black stinky gingivitis, and bad cheese. On top of that, he looked like a cheap Halloween mask come to life, all papery wrinkles and saggy, yellowed eyelids.</p><p>Sadly, he was still better-looking than former grandpa Tom.</p><p>\u201cOh, Jane, I didn\u2019t know you were going to be here.\u201d Grandma Ruthie sniffed as Mama took her coat, the unspoken but clear sentiment being that she wouldn\u2019t have come if she\u2019d known I was going to be there.</p><p>Mama hustled their coats out of the room. Daddy, obviously determined not to get caught up in whatever was about to transpire, kept his eyes glued to the television and relentlessly changed the channel. Wilbur looked from me to Grandma to me again. I crossed my arms and grinned at Grandma, happy not to be the rude, socially backward one for once.</p><p>Finally, Grandma sighed and said, \u201cJane, this is my fianc\u00e9, Wilbur. Wilbur, this is my, this is Jane.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo nice to meet you,\u201d he said. \u201cYour grandma has told me so much about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI doubt that very much,\u201d I said, smiling sweetly. I didn\u2019t flash my fangs. I\u2019d leave it to Grandma to send senior men into mysterious cardiac-arrest episodes.</p><p>Wait, did she say fianc\u00e9? I zeroed in on Grandma\u2019s left hand, where a tasteful diamond engagement ring twinkled.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re engaged?\u201d I gasped. \u201cAgain?\u201d</p><p>Sensing the shift in the room, Mama poked her head into the living room. \u201cJane, honey, can I see you for a minute?\u201d</p><p>Jaw unhinged, I followed Mama into the kitchen, where a wealth of Tupperware was carefully laid out in the traditional Jameson post-Christmas smorgasbord formation on the countertop. I clamped my hand over my nose when confronted with Mama\u2019s reheated \u201cfancy\u201d cheese grits, made with gouda and bacon and an obscene amount of garlic.</p><p>\u201cIs she crazy?\u201d I demanded around my hand. \u201cIs he crazy?\u201d</p><p>Mama shrugged. \u201cWell, I will admit that the mourning period was a little short.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe brought a date to the burial,\u201d I hissed, removing my hand from my face and concentrating on talking instead of smelling. (Stupid instinctual breathing!)</p><p>\u201cAt the time, he was just a friend, trying to help her through a difficult time,\u201d Mama said in what could only be described as her \u201cdenial\u201d voice. I simply watched her, expressionless, prompting Mama to say, \u201cYour grandma isn\u2019t like you, Jane. She\u2019s from a different time. She\u2019s the kind of woman who needs a man in her life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor a brief time, before her evil curse kills them in a terribly ironic way,\u201d I said, which made Mama\u2019s face pucker. \u201cYou know, this never would have happened if you had taken my advice and put up those \u2018Warning\u2014Black Widow\u2014Do Not Marry\u2019 posters with Grandma\u2019s picture down at the senior center.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHoney, you know I don\u2019t like it when you talk that way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like having a grandma with a four-volume wedding album. We all have our burdens to bear.\u201d</p><p>The tiniest eye twinkle under the veneer of annoyance told me Mama was trying not to laugh.</p><p>\u201cWhen\u2019s the wedding?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cThey haven\u2019t set a date yet,\u201d Mama said. \u201cBut you know how she likes to get married in the fall\u2014\u201d Mama caught herself. \u201cSee? Now you have me doing it.\u201d</p><p>I pressed my lips together to suppress the smirk.</p><p>\u201cWilbur seems like a very nice man,\u201d Mama told me in her \u201cDon\u2019t argue\u201d voice. \u201cHe treats Grandma how gentlemen used to treat ladies. He opens doors for her. He carries heavy bags. He orders for her in restaurants.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo he\u2019s like a concierge,\u201d I said.</p><p>Mama was not amused.</p><p>\u201cMama, she\u2019s going to kill another one!\u201d I moaned. \u201cThis has got to stop. Hasn\u2019t she had all the husbands she needs?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShh, they\u2019re going to hear you,\u201d Mama said, sending furtive looks at the door.</p><p>\u201cOh, they can\u2019t hear anything.\u201d I rolled my eyes.</p><p>In an obvious ploy to redirect the conversation, Mama looked furtively toward the door and said, \u201cI\u2019ve been meaning to ask you, but I didn\u2019t want to in front of your daddy. How are things going with your Gabriel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d I jerked my shoulders. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cFine?\u201d she asked. \u201cJust fine?\u201d</p><p>I nodded, my lips pressed tightly together, narrowing my gaze as Mama shot me a canary-devouring feline smile. She said, \u201cYou\u2019ll never guess who was asking about you at prayer meeting the other night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right. I won\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAdam Morrow, you remember, you used to have such a big crush on him in high school. I used to find his name doodled all over your notebooks. Adam Morrow. Mrs. Adam Morrow. Jane Jameson-Morrow, Jane E. Morrow. Jane and Adam Morr\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI got it. I remember.\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cWell, he has been asking about you at church. And I thought, why not ask him over for dinner sometime? A poor single boy who works as hard as he does knows how to appreciate a good home-cooked meal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMama, please don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Mama pursed her lips, turning back to the steaming contents of her stove. She stirred. She salted. She tasted. Finally, she turned back to me with a dreamy expression of the generous mother-goddess that, frankly, scared me. She cleared her throat and used her special \u201cimparting motherly wisdom from the mountaintop\u201d voice. \u201cWhen your daddy and I were dating, he planned on going fishing with some friends over Homecoming weekend. This was back in high school. We\u2019d only been dating a little while, and I think he didn\u2019t want me to think I could plan things out for him.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cClearly, he didn\u2019t know you very well,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cMmm-hmm,\u201d she said, stirring the potatoes. \u201cI told him it was perfectly fine if he wanted to go fishing with his buddies, because Eddie Carroll had offered to take me to the dance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMr. Carroll? My math teacher? Ew.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should have seen him in high school. With a full head of hair, he was quite the man about town. If things hadn\u2019t worked out with your father\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop,\u201d I told her, laughing. \u201cI do not want to hear that I could have been a Carroll.\u201d</p><p>Mama giggled. \u201cYou know, he still tells me on occasion that I have lovely ankles.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThey are lovely. But back to the story, please,\u201d I said, shuddering at the thought of Mr. Carroll ogling my mother at Parent-Teacher Night.</p><p>\u201cWell, the moment your father heard that, he called his buddies and canceled the fishing trip,\u201d she said, preening. \u201cHe was pinning that corsage on my dress faster than you could say \u2018dog in the manger.\u2019 And every dance or party after that, your father knew that he would be going with me, because I might have other offers. Sometimes men need a little competition to realize what they have. It\u2019s healthy for a relationship.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid Mr. Carroll really ask you to the dance?\u201d I asked. A Cheshire-cat smile spread across her face. I laughed. \u201cYou know, Mama, sometimes I completely underestimate you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re probably right. So, if I ask a question, will you bite my head off?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cYou know I won\u2019t actually bite you, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know what I mean,\u201d she said, tasting the gravy. She offered me a spoonful, but I declined, as its bouquet reminded me of that smell refrigerators get after long vacations. \u201cWhy not just call Adam, honey? You were crazy about him in high school. And he\u2019s such a nice boy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019m at the point in my life where I need more than a nice boy. I need a nice man.\u201d</p><p>Mama tsked and patted my cheek. \u201cIs Gabriel a nice man?\u201d</p> <p>Recalling the unfortunate Bud McElray incident, I hesitated. \u201cNot particularly. That may be what I deserve, though.\u201d</p><p>Mama sighed and stirred. \u201cWell, I don\u2019t really follow you. I can tell you that when Eddie Carroll tried to cut in at the Homecoming Dance, Daddy broke his nose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTempting, but Gabriel might not stop at the nose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet things with Gabriel take their course,\u201d she intoned. \u201cAnd in the meantime, see where things go with Adam. In the end, knowing they have a little competition may speed things along.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpeed what things along to what?\u201d I asked.</p><p>Mama shushed me and handed me a tray of eggnog and slightly damaged leftover Santa cookies. \u201cNow, just take this out to them, and mind your manners. Behave yourself with your grandma.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will if she will,\u201d I hissed back.</p><p>When I walked back into the den, Daddy was still mindlessly changing the channels, ignoring Grandma\u2019s very presence. Wilbur and Grandma were snuggled up on the couch. Grandma was trying to tempt Wilbur with a candy cane, swiping it sensuously along his lips. Wilbur was smiling fondly at her as he reminded her about his diabetes. I guessed chronic disease precluded her need to seduce him with seasonal candy.</p><p>Repulsed, I turned on my heels and headed back to the kitchen, but Daddy called, \u201cJane?\u201d Desperate for someone to share his suffering, he demanded, \u201cIs that eggnog? With liquor?\u201d I winked at him and gave him a double helping.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s so nice to see you helping your mama for a change,\u201d Grandma said, nodding imperiously toward the tray. I ignored the bait.</p><p>\u201cWould you like some?\u201d I asked Wilbur.</p><p>Wilbur was about to answer when Grandma patted his hand fondly and simpered, \u201cOh, Wilbur is lactose-intolerant. His stomach is just so sensitive. He can\u2019t have salt because of the high blood pressure or sugar because of his diabetes. Or fats. Or nuts. Or meat. He usually sticks to Ensure or these macrobiotic shakes.\u201d</p><p>Grandma pulled a canned shake out of her enormous Aigner purse. Wilbur took it out of her hand and stuck it back into her purse before I could get a good look at the label.</p><p>\u201cSo, how did you two meet?\u201d I asked. \u201cWhen did you two meet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, it\u2019s the sweetest story.\u201d Grandma sighed. \u201cI was on my way into Whitlow\u2019s to plan Bob\u2019s service, and Wilbur was there in the hallway, waiting for a friend\u2019s visitation to start. He saw how upset I was and offered me his hankie. It was so romantic and chivalrous, I just had to invite him for a cup of coffee in Mr. Whitlow\u2019s office.\u201d</p><p>I stared at Wilbur, reaching out, trying to touch his mind. Nothing. It was like scraping my knuckles on a brick wall. Stupid inconsistent vampire powers.</p><p>\u201cMr. Goosen\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can just call me Grandpa,\u201d he said, smiling.</p><p>One would think that at this point in my life, with as many grandpas as I\u2019ve had, one more wouldn\u2019t bother me. But something, possibly step-grandparent weariness or allegiance to Bob, made me say, \u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d</p><p>Grandma sighed and sent me a wounded look. Wilbur took a deep breath and sat forward, his hands in a steepled, grandfatherly stance. \u201cNow, Janie, honey, I know it\u2019s been a rough couple of weeks. But everyone else seems to be happy for your grandma and me. Ruthie said that you don\u2019t deal with change well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know me well enough\u2014\u201d</p><p>He interrupted me again, which was not doing much to warm my heart toward him. \u201cI understand that you love your grandma and you\u2019re concerned for her well-being. I think that\u2019s admirable, Jane.\u201d</p><p>How horrible was it that I wanted to tell him he had it totally wrong?</p><p>He reached out to pat my hand. His own was clammy and damp enough to make me want to pull away. \u201cI just want you to know that I love your grandma and I\u2019m going to take care of her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not her I\u2019m worried about.\u201d</p><p>Mama popped her head into the doorway again. \u201cJane, could I see you in the kitchen for a minute?\u201d</p><p>Daddy sent me a frantic look. Clearly, the idea of more alone time with the geriatric lovebirds had him panicked. Slinking out of the room, I muttered, \u201cEverybody stops interrupting me, or I\u2019ll publish a newsletter featuring your secret thoughts of the day.\u201d</p><p>Mama had heated all of the food. She\u2019d also rolled the plastic picnic ware into paper napkins and filled all of the cups with ice. She was now organizing and reorganizing the Tupperware lids, first putting them on the containers, then tucking them under the containers. She was doing pointless busywork. Thinking back, I realized Mama rarely came out of the kitchen for the leftover Christmas dinners.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re hiding in here,\u201d I accused. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to be in there any more than I do. You\u2019ve been hiding in here for years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have not!\u201d Mama cried, not meeting my gaze.</p><p>\u201cOh, it\u2019s over now. I\u2019ve seen the man behind the curtain,\u201d I whispered. \u201cI take no holiday guff from you, from now on. Ever.\u201d</p><p>Mama ignored me while she fiddled with the defrost feature on the microwave.</p><p>\u201cLook, as much fun as it is trying to send secret warning messages to Dead Grandpa Walking, I need to go.\u201d I looked at the clock. \u201cIt\u2019s getting close to six, and I would like to avoid further awkwardness with Jenny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re already here. Why don\u2019t you just stay?\u201d Mama wheedled. \u201cThe boys haven\u2019t seen you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSince the funeral home, last week,\u201d I said. \u201cAnd they were too busy destroying the telephone-shaped \u2018Jesus Called Him Home\u2019 floral arrangement to talk to me. I don\u2019t think my absence will scar them for life.\u201d</p><p>The pounding arrival of the boys at the front door told me that I was too late.</p><p>\u201cGrandma! Grandma! We got Blood Spatter Carjacker Mayhem Four!\u201d Andrew shouted, waving the gore-soaked video game case at my mother. \u201cCan we play it now? Please?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, honey, you know Grandma doesn\u2019t have a game system\u2014\u201d Jenny said, coming into the kitchen. She skidded to a stop when she saw me.</p><p>\u201cEverything here is boring.\u201d Andrew sighed as he and Bradley slinked into the living room. If he had paid attention to the look on his mother\u2019s face, he would know that if he stuck around, it might get interesting. Or at least blood-spattery.</p><p>My brother-in-law, Kent, the chiropractor whom I\u2019ve rarely heard speak, followed at Jenny\u2019s heels. The moment he saw me, he pivoted and trailed after the boys.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know you\u2019d be here,\u201d Jenny said, sending a reproachful look Mama\u2019s way. \u201cMama, I agreed to see her at Bob\u2019s visitation, but that\u2019s it. You can\u2019t let her come over and not tell me. It upsets the boys to see her.\u201d</p><p>I rolled my eyes. \u201cThe boys didn\u2019t even notice I was in the room. And if they did and you actually told them their aunt was a vampire, they\u2019d probably think I was the coolest thing since Blood Spatter Carjacker Mayhem Four. And don\u2019t blame Mama. I didn\u2019t mean to stay so long, but I got caught up talking. I\u2019m leaving now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, but you can\u2019t go!\u201d Mama cried. \u201cThis is the first time we\u2019ve all been in the house together since you ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cDied?\u201d I finished for her. \u201cYou can say it. I died.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShh!\u201d Jenny shushed me, looking toward the den.</p><p>\u201cPlease, can\u2019t you both just put this all aside for the holiday?\u201d Mama begged. \u201cFor the family?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Jenny and I chorused.</p><p>Mama switched tactics just by dropping her voice an octave. \u201cNow, girls, this is just silly. We\u2019re family. And it\u2019s Christmas. If you can\u2019t forgive your family around the holidays, what\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop,\u201d I told her. The way she stretched the word into \u201cfaaaaaamily\u201d when she wanted something always set my teeth on edge.</p><p>\u201cThe time of year doesn\u2019t change anything. I don\u2019t want her around my family,\u201d Jenny ground out.</p><p>I shot her a look that could have dropped a more observant woman. So, it was her family. As far as she was concerned, I wasn\u2019t part of it anymore. Frankly, she was welcome to it. \u201cI\u2019m going.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow, Jenny, be a good sister,\u201d Mama told Jenny. \u201cWe have to have the whole family together for Christmas. The good Christian thing to do would be to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s dead!\u201d Jenny cried. \u201cThe good Christian thing to do would be to give her a decent burial.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow, Jenny, you know you don\u2019t mean that,\u201d Mama said through clenched teeth.</p><p>\u201cBurial talk is my cue to go,\u201d I said, grabbing my jacket. \u201cI think I\u2019ll be leaving the country for New Year\u2019s, so please don\u2019t call.\u201d</p><p>I stuck my head into the den to give Daddy a quick good-bye, which he couldn\u2019t hear over the screeching and beeping of the boys\u2019 new radio controlled-monster trucks.</p><p>From the kitchen, I heard Mama whine, \u201cTell Jane it just won\u2019t be Christmas without her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have me, Kent, the boys here, why\u2014\u201d I closed the front door on Jenny\u2019s wounded response.</p><p>I looked back through the window. Wilbur looked absolutely miserable. I was sympathetic, but when it came to the Jameson family Christmas, it was every man, woman, and vampire for themselves.</p><p>10</p><p>Adult werewolf children are expected to stay within the confines of pack territory. Those who move more than a five-minute run from pack headquarters are either disowned or hosts to frequent weekend guests.</p><p>\u2014Mating Rituals and Love Customs of the Were</p><p>From the dawn of time, women have formed friendships for one purpose only: to make sure they\u2019ll have someone to provide unpaid serf labor for their weddings. And we all just go along with it, spurred by fear that if we don\u2019t submit to the bridal demands, there will be no one to slave over our own weddings.</p><p>That\u2019s why, six months before the actual wedding, I was spending an evening measuring and cutting exactly fourteen inches of cornflower-blue ribbon over and over and over and ... over. These ribbons would be sent to a printing company to be stamped with \u201cHMS Titanic\u201d on one side and \u201cZeb and Jolene\u2014Struck by Love\u201d on the other. They would then be tied around old-fashioned hurricane lamps as part of Jolene\u2019s carefully planned tablescape. Each table was going to be named for famous (read: deceased) Titanic passengers, such as John Jacob Astor and Molly Brown, then decorated with hurricane lamps and fake ice. Of course, no one would pay attention to a seating plan, which is another Southern wedding tradition. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Jolene had the gall to call this gathering a \u201cwork party,\u201d in the style of Amish people who get together to make a quilt or build a barn. I didn\u2019t think Amish women typically had a Camel hanging from the corner of their lips while they worked, like Jolene\u2019s aunt Lulu. Also, the Amish employed more lenient leaders than Jolene, who had the tendency to become a little bossy when it came to her nuptials.</p><p>\u201cIt has to be at least fourteen inches to make sure each bow has about three inches of hanging ribbon on each side,\u201d Jolene told us. I would have questioned whether Jolene was serious, but she didn\u2019t respond well when I laughed at her \u201cAll bridesmaids must cut their hair to exactly three inches below the shoulder by March\u201d edict.</p><p>Pointing out that the printing company would have cut these ribbons for an additional $250 would have resulted in huffy eye rolls from Jolene\u2019s battalion of cranky cousins. Besides, Aunt Vonnie, who had somehow heard my full opinion of the bridesmaids\u2019 dresses, was already giving me the dagger eyes.</p> <p>The McClaine clan alpha couple\u2014known to Jolene as Mom and Dad\u2014lived in the main house on the compound, a quaint little yellow farmhouse, with white shutters and a porch swing, surrounded by a series of increasingly dilapidated trailers. Inside, the walls were decorated with Thomas Kinkade prints and silk floral arrangements saved from funeral services. Everything was neat and clean and protected by doilies. And everybody was naked. Which explained the doilies.</p><p>Jolene and her cousins whipped their clothes off the moment they got in the door, the way most people kick off their shoes.</p><p>\u201cDoes this bother you?\u201d she\u2019d asked the first time I stumbled into her mother\u2019s house.</p><p>\u201cI just don\u2019t know where to look,\u201d I said, settling for a strange orange silk-flower arrangement mounted on the wall. The truth was, as the only clothed person there, I felt weird. I felt more naked than Jolene.</p><p>The only cousin who was remotely friendly was Charlene, who had asked for my home and e-mail addresses twice in the four hours since meeting me. She wanted to be my best friend. Seriously. My best friend. You cannot be nice to people like Charlene. It\u2019s like feeding a stray cat. The cat just keeps coming back until you have to move. So I was being overtly rude to her, which wasn\u2019t really helping my standing with the rest of the family.</p> <p>Fortunately, among werewolf women, the word \u201cbitch\u201d is not offensive. I was having a lot of fun with that.</p><p>\u201cHey there, bitches!\u201d I called as I came through the door. \u201cWhat are my favorite bitches up to today?\u201d</p><p>The only response was a chorus of unenthusiastic, drawled \u201cHi\u2019s\u201d and \u201cHeys.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know what you\u2019re doin\u2019,\u201d Jolene muttered as she hugged me. \u201cAnd it\u2019s not funny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee, that\u2019s where you\u2019re wrong,\u201d I said, tucking wavy crimson hair behind her ears. She scowled at me. \u201cI\u2019ll try to keep it to a minimum.\u201d</p><p>Jolene was clearly the Golden Child in her clan. Her mother, Mimi, and all of the aunts fawned over her, telling and retelling cute stories from when she was a cub. Any accomplishment or news from the other cousins was matched with something about Jolene. Jolene was the only one of her cousins to attend community college. Jolene could skin a rabbit in two bites. Jolene was Miss Half-Moon Hollow 1998. Jolene and Zeb would be the first couple in her family to plan an actual honeymoon\u2014to Gatlinburg, Tennessee, which was where you went when you couldn\u2019t afford to go to Florida but wanted to be far enough away that your parents couldn\u2019t \u201cdrop in\u201d on the wedding night.</p> <p>\u201cJolene works at Uncle Clay\u2019s sandwich shop,\u201d Aunt Lola said, beaming beatifically at Jolene. \u201cHe says all the customers just love her. She\u2019s so helpful, so sweet. She just makes everybody she meets so happy.\u201d</p><p>Raylene, Angelene, Lurlene, and Company let loose a collective sigh and synchronized eye roll. Sensing that the mob might be turning ugly, Jolene asked, \u201cHow\u2019s the new job, Raylene?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d Raylene said, her voice flat as she concentrated on cutting the ribbon without fraying it.</p><p>\u201cJust fine?\u201d Jolene asked. \u201cI mean, it\u2019s got to be fun, right?\u201d</p><p>Raylene shrugged. \u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you seen one, you seen \u2018em all, right, Raylene?\u201d Angelene asked slyly.</p><p>\u201cAngelene,\u201d Mimi growled. (Yes, literally.)</p><p>\u201cI just started as a cake decorator at the Sweet Tooth,\u201d Raylene explained. \u201cI specialize in adult cakes.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLike Black Forest?\u201d I asked. \u201cThat always seemed pretty grown-up to me.\u201d</p><p>I really missed Black Forest cake, or any kind of cake. I missed chocolate. Bah! I still can\u2019t believe the last food I ate was potato skins.</p><p>\u201cNo, Raylene makes cakes that look like\u201d\u2014Aunt Tammy looked around as if there were spies lurking behind the lace curtains\u2014\u201dsex parts.\u201d</p><p>Raylene sighed. \u201cI make penis cakes.\u201d</p><p>Well, at least I knew what we were serving at the bachelorette party.</p><p>\u201cHow does one get into the penis-cake field?\u201d I asked. \u201cWhere do you buy the cake pans for that?\u201d</p><p>Raylene stared at me, unsure whether I was teasing her or honestly interested. Sensing a lull in the conversation, Aunt Lola\u2014Raylene\u2019s own mother\u2014changed the subject back to Jolene.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re all just so excited about Jolene\u2019s wedding.\u201d Lola sighed. \u201cWe\u2019ve all waited for this, for just years now. And Zeb\u2019s such an ... he\u2019s a sweet boy. Tell us again how he popped the question?\u201d</p><p>Arlene muttered, \u201c\u2018Cause we haven\u2019t heard this story in almost an hour now.\u201d</p><p>Jolene obviously heard her cousin but ignored her. To be fair, I had heard the story a few times myself.</p><p>\u201cZeb had this big plan with a restaurant and hidin\u2019 the ring in a souffl\u00e9,\u201d Jolene said, smiling dreamily. \u201cAnd then I stepped out my front door, he saw me all dressed up, and he blurted out \u2018Willyoumarryme?\u2019 and shoved the ring at me. It was so cute!\u201d Jolene cooed, looking down at the little diamond ring for which Zeb had plunked down two months of his teaching salary. \u201cHe almost shouted at me when he proposed. He was supposed to have the waiters at Julian\u2019s sing this cute little \u2018Will You Marry Me?\u2019 song. Most of them are in the high-school swing chorus, and when we got to the restaurant and they found out we were already engaged, they were so mad they had missed their chance to perform! After that, Zeb was afraid to order the souffl\u00e9. Who knows what they might have done to it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid he cry?\u201d Lurlene asked. \u201cI heard that human males cry at the drop of a hat.\u201d</p><p>The amazing thing about werewolves, who spend half their lives behind a human mask, is that they have terrible poker faces. It\u2019s part of that canine earnestness thing. For a brief second, a look of pure annoyance flashed over Jolene\u2019s perfect features. Lurlene smirked.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s it goin\u2019 with Roy?\u201d Jolene asked. \u201cIsn\u2019t he the one who drives the ice cream truck?\u201d</p><p>There was that annoyed flash again, only on Lurlene\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cThat was Ray,\u201d Lurlene said, glaring. \u201cRoy and I aren\u2019t dating anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait, didn\u2019t I see his name in the paper for somethin\u2019?\u201d Jolene said.</p><p>\u201cOh, he got busted for trying to sneak a brisket out of the Super Saver in his jacket,\u201d Tammy said in the most helpful tone I\u2019d heard in a while. \u201cHe would have gotten away with it if he hadn\u2019t dropped the brisket.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh! Is he the one who yelled, \u2018Who threw this meat at me?\u2019 and then tried to run out of the store?\u201d I giggled. \u201cDidn\u2019t it take three Taser shots to get him down? Knowing that he\u2019s a werewolf now, well, that makes a lot more sense ... I\u2019m not helping, am I?\u201d</p><p>I ducked my head and pretended that measuring ribbons exactly was the most important thing in the world.</p><p>\u201cSo, Jolene, tell us all about your dress,\u201d Aunt DeeDee squealed. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen it yet, but Vonnie said it\u2019s just gorgeous.\u201d</p><p>Cue another eye roll from the cousins.</p><p>\u201cIt is,\u201d I volunteered. \u201cReally gorgeous.\u201d</p><p>Cue another eye roll. Sensing the shift in the tide, Jolene generously switched subjects to Braylene\u2019s son. \u201cMama finished Jake\u2019s little captain\u2019s outfit.\u201d</p><p>At my questioning eyebrow, she said, \u201cJake\u2019s going to be our ring bearer. We found a pattern for an authentic period captain\u2019s suit. I just hope he can get down the aisle without stripping it off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you found a figurehead yet?\u201d Aunt Tammy asked.</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m thinking about having Uncle Deke carve one.\u201d Jolene pouted.</p><p>\u201cTitanic didn\u2019t have a figurehead.\u201d</p><p>Three guesses who said that. They all turned to me, the person who had dared to disagree with Jolene.</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d Jolene shrugged. \u201cBut it\u2019s just so nautical and romantic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, most figureheads on ships featured bare breasts because sailors believed that the best way to keep storms and misfortunes at bay was to have a woman sacrifice her dignity to the gods. Flash a little boob, get smooth sailing. It\u2019s not so much romantic as Clash of the Titans meets Girls Gone Wild.\u201d</p><p>And if they weren\u2019t staring before, they certainly were now. \u201cI\u2019m the only person in the room who knew that, aren\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>Jolene wrapped an arm around me. \u201cI love it when you pretend to be normal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven when I was human, I wasn\u2019t normal,\u201d I admitted. I lowered my voice as the pack returned to their handiwork. \u201cSo, what\u2019s Mama Ginger been up to lately?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothin\u2019,\u201d she muttered. \u201cThat has me worried. It\u2019s been too quiet. Zeb said she\u2019s been distracted by hatin\u2019 your boyfriend, which is kind of nice. I know it can\u2019t last long, but I\u2019m enjoying it while it lasts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think that\u2019s about as healthy as you can expect to be,\u201d I assured her.</p><p>Mollified for a moment, Jolene measured out several lengths of ribbon, rolled it back on the spool, measured it again, rolled it back. Grunting, she yanked the entire length of ribbon off the spool in a heap of blue sateen. When she picked up the scissors, I gently took the ribbon out of her hand. \u201cJolene, I may be going out on a limb here, but is something else bothering you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you noticed anything odd about Zeb?\u201d she asked. \u201cI know this wedding stuff has him all stressed out, but he\u2019s just been so distant, like he doesn\u2019t even want to talk to me. And he\u2019s been kind of mean. Some of the things he\u2019s been saying are just hurtful.\u201d</p><p>When I gave her an intentionally blank look, she said, \u201cLike that joke about me not being very smart. And I don\u2019t think he realizes how much he talks about you. We\u2019ll be out to eat, and he\u2019ll talk about what sort of food you used to like. We\u2019ll watch a movie, and he\u2019ll say, \u2018I\u2019ve already seen this with Jane.\u2019 It\u2019s just hard, you know? It\u2019s like you\u2019re an ex-girlfriend, but you never really broke up with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never really dated him, either,\u201d I told her.</p><p>\u201cI know that,\u201d she said, nudging me with her arm. \u201cIt\u2019s just hard to live up to you, Jane.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s not. You\u2019ve already got me beat hands down on looks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d she said, grinning.</p><p>\u201cAgree with me a little slower, please,\u201d I said, smacking her arm. \u201cAnd you can go out during the day, have kids, eat, tan, grow old with him. And Zeb loves you. He\u2019s just going through a weird phase. Just watch him at the wedding. He\u2019ll be the happiest groom ever.\u201d</p><p>Jolene didn\u2019t look quite convinced but mumbled, \u201cOK.\u201d</p><p>The conversations became even more awkward as my night wore on.</p><p>\u201cThis is just beyond the pale,\u201d Gabriel grumbled as I opened my door for him.</p><p>I\u2019d been halfheartedly Googling Wilbur\u2019s name, hoping I could find some relatives I could warn about Grandma Ruthie\u2019s marital record before it was too late. Unused to Google failure, I was thrilled to have a distraction, even if that distraction was my agitated sire waving what looked like a ransom note at me.</p><p>\u201cI found this in my mailbox tonight,\u201d he said, holding a slip of bright yellow paper with letters cut out of magazines and newspapers\u2014the standard font for crazies.</p><p>\u201c \u2018Your bustin\u2019 up a happy home. Brake it off with Jane or else,\u2019 \u201c I read aloud as he stormed inside. \u201cMama Ginger\u2019s spelling is atrocious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re to write harassing letters in upsetting type, you should at least have the courtesy to proofread,\u201d he muttered, stretching across my couch.</p><p>\u201cSome people,\u201d I said, rolling my eyes.</p><p>\u201cShe did, however, ruin her anonymity by enclosing this,\u201d he said, handing me a check for $352.67 from the account of Ginger and Floyd Lavelle. \u201cI think she\u2019s trying to pay me to stay away from you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat gave it away?\u201d I asked, holding up the check with a finger on the memo section, where Mama Ginger had scribbled, \u201cTo stay away from Jane.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that is a lot of money,\u201d I said. \u201cIt was good while it lasted.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel barked out a laugh. \u201cI\u2019m glad to see you,\u201d he said before leaning across the cushions and kissing me.</p><p>I gave him a bemused smile and blithely ignored the fact that it had been almost a week since he\u2019d called or visited. Or that I\u2019d been going crazy wondering where he was and what he was doing, but I didn\u2019t want to be \u201cthat girlfriend\u201d and call his cell phone constantly. Instead, I said, \u201cI\u2019m always right here.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Gabriel opened his mouth to respond but was interrupted by a knock at the door.</p><p>\u201cMaybe we shouldn\u2019t answer it,\u201d I said. \u201cIt could be Mama Ginger. She might try to throw remaindered sausage products into the deal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to hide from a middle-aged woman who cannot spell,\u201d Gabriel insisted darkly, advancing on the front door. I held him back with a hand against his chest.</p> <p>\u201cWell, let me answer the door, at least. She\u2019s much less likely to douse me in battery acid.\u201d</p><p>It was not a pleasant surprise to find Ophelia Lambert, the scary forever-adolescent head of the local panel for the World Council for Equal Treatment of the Undead, at my front door wearing a man\u2019s shirt and tie with a skirt that might have been originally marketed as a headband.</p><p>Ophelia oversaw my failed prosecution for several random killings and fires the previous year and ultimately decided that I was justified in dusting Missy the Realtor with one of her own yard signs. Despite her being reasonably civil to me and electing not to set me on fire, I still found 300 years\u2019 worth of predatory grace wrapped up in a fifteen-year-old\u2019s body to be extremely offputting. On her part, I think she found my convulsive antics charming, but she was afraid to admit it.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t do it,\u201d I blurted out after opening the door.</p><p>\u201cDo what?\u201d she asked, her brow arched.</p> <p>\u201cWhatever,\u201d I said. \u201cWhatever big suspicious badness brought you to my door.\u201d</p><p>She smirked, her carefully painted coral lips quirking into a bow. \u201cSome people believe that the best way to avoid suspicion is not to declare their innocence before they\u2019re accused of anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I played it your way last time, and we see where that got me,\u201d I said, waving her inside.</p><p>\u201cAs I understand it, it got you a very nice triumph settlement,\u201d she said, slinking into the living room and perching on the nearest settee. She nodded in cool greeting to my sire.</p><p>\u201cSo I keep hearing,\u201d I muttered. \u201cI\u2019ll believe it when I see a black balance on my bank statement.\u201d</p><p>Ophelia grinned, her fangs glinting from the low-burning firelight, and offered me a slip of paper. It was my bank statement, and the balance was black. Very, very black. Apparently, Missy\u2019s holdings had been transferred into my checking account. And her holdings were a little more extensive than I\u2019d estimated. But it made sense, considering how many vampires she duped, cheated, and murdered to get their property. Plus, she did charge a healthy commission on her sales.</p> <p>I\u2019d been raised to think of discussing money as vulgar and rude. So I\u2019ll just say that I would not have to worry about money. Ever. I could live the rest of my unnaturally long life, sitting on a sofa stuffed with twenty-dollar bills, sipping dessert blood, and avoiding any form of effort, and I would still have a little left over to make sure my alma mater named a parking lot after me.</p><p>\u201cI guess the council decided that I\u2019ve learned my lesson about being a good little vampire and staying out of trouble?\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cSomething like that,\u201d Ophelia said, smirking again.</p><p>\u201cThe council couldn\u2019t legally hold on to the money any longer without charging me with something?\u201d I suggested.</p><p>\u201cSomething exactly like that.\u201d Ophelia grinned, delighted by my grasp of the situation. \u201cWhat do you plan to do with the money?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m still in the \u2018Yay, I won\u2019t lose my house\u2019 phase of processing this information,\u201d I told her. \u201cGive me some time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s very normal,\u201d she said, shifting uncomfortably in her seat. Given the brevity of her skirt, it wasn\u2019t exactly comfortable for any of us. Out of deference to me and continued indifference to Ophelia, Gabriel made a comprehensive study of the window treatments.</p><p>\u201cWe will be getting back to a long discussion of how exactly you came by my account information, by the way,\u201d I said, avoiding eye contact with her lack of skirt. \u201cCan I ask why you brought me this news in person? This sounds like the sort of thing that should be delivered by registered mail. I thought you were supposed to be a disinterested third party.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou interest me,\u201d she said nonchalantly. \u201cYou\u2019re very entertaining.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike a dancing monkey,\u201d I muttered.</p><p>Ophelia smiled nastily, her bone-white fangs fully extended as she threw her head back and laughed. When she was done, she wiped at her eyes and smirked at Gabriel. \u201cActually, I needed to see Gabriel as well. As much as I\u2019d love to let you and your charming paramour return to ... whatever it was that you were doing, there is something I need to discuss with you.\u201d</p><p>Silence.</p><p>I looked from the ancient teenager to my sire. Gabriel stared at Ophelia, who returned his silver gaze, unmoved and unimpressed. Clearly, whatever it was, Ophelia was not going to talk about it in front of me. And neither of them seemed willing to ask me to leave. Apparently, that would be rude. Pretending I didn\u2019t exist, however, was totally OK.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll just go check on ... something,\u201d I said, scurrying into the kitchen with as much dignity as possible.</p><p>\u201cAll the way outside, Jane,\u201d Ophelia called after me.</p><p>Well, there goes that.</p><p>I would like to say that I stood on the porch and enjoyed the pleasant evening air, contemplated the fullness of the moon and my place in the universe, giving not one thought to what was being said in my own house and how it might affect me. But I crept around to the front door and used my vampire hearing to eavesdrop.</p><p>I\u2019m a deeply flawed person.</p><p>It should come as no surprise that I am not good with stealth. Ophelia and Gabriel obviously knew I was doing it because they spoke in hushed tones that I strained to hear. All I could make out were furious whispers and Ophelia saying the words \u201cunhinged,\u201d \u201cnightmare,\u201d and \u201cJeanine.\u201d</p><p>There was that name again. Who the hell was Jeanine? I stepped closer to the door, catching the wrong porch board and sending an ear-splitting creak directly into their ears. They were now more than aware that I was standing outside listening. Ophelia snickered and said in a louder voice, \u201cThis is your problem to deal with, Gabriel. But if you cannot handle the situation, the council would be happy to step in.\u201d</p><p>I could hear Gabriel\u2019s insistent, almost desperate whisper in return, but I could not understand his response. I think he was speaking Chinese. I could only speak bad high-school Spanish. Ophelia, clearly exasperated at his pretense, responded with a rather impressive tirade that I could not understand. But then again, everything sounds sort of angry in Mandarin.</p><p>Realizing that further listening was pointless, I spent the next few minutes tossing a beloved but much-abused tennis ball to Fitz. He was in hyper-doggie heaven, running at me and making playful nips at my jeans. I heard the front door open and watched with dread as the ecstatic \u201cNew person!\u201d expression flashed in Fitz\u2019s eyes. I could hear myself yelling \u201cNooooo!\u201d in slow motion as Fitz ran at Ophelia. My brain had just enough time to calculate exactly how much time I would be spending in the council clink if Fitz ruined one of Ophelia\u2019s indecently expensive outfits or, worse yet, if Ophelia would leave Fitz with all of his appendages intact.</p><p>Instead of the canine carnage I foresaw, I was shocked as Ophelia smiled warmly at my loping mutt. She held up one finger and said something soft in German. Fitz skidded to a halt directly in front of her and plopped obediently on his butt. She smiled again and gave another command. Fitz held up his paw, and she deigned to shake it, scratching him behind the ears with an expression of ... well, it was the first genuine expression I\u2019d ever seen on Ophelia\u2019s face, so I can only describe it as \u201cyoung.\u201d For a moment, the centuries fell away, and she was just a beautiful girl standing on my lawn, petting my dog.</p><p>I\u2019m pretty sure my jaw was resting on my chest, because when Ophelia looked up at me, all traces of the young human faded like smoke. Her face hardened into more familiar lines. She narrowed her eyes at me. I raised my hands in defense.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t see a thing,\u201d I promised her.</p><p>She arched her eyebrow, gave Fitz one last pat on the head, but said nothing. Gabriel came out the front door, leaning against the porch post as Ophelia made her way toward her sporty red Corvette. I\u2019m sure the act of driving that down Main Street made her an object of obsession and envy, but frankly, I found it rather obvious in terms of jail-bait appeal.</p><p>Ophelia opened the door, tilted her head, and considered me for a moment, her piercing blue eyes glowing at me through the shadows. \u201cI am very glad that Missy\u2019s money has landed in your hands. I think you\u2019re going to do far more fascinating things with it than some tawdry housing development.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, now isn\u2019t the time to tell you about the Dracula theme park I have planned for the back fifty acres?\u201d I asked brightly. Gabriel snickered but covered it by a hearty clearing of the throat.</p><p>\u201cFor both of our sakes, I\u2019m going to assume that was a joke,\u201d she muttered, climbing into her car and giving us one last flash of thighs.</p><p>Ophelia departed, leaving my head spinning with the possibilities of Missy\u2019s money. I would never have to worry about paying the property taxes. I would be able to keep the house up for centuries to come. The Early family legacy, such as it was, was secure.</p><p>I could travel. I could finally see all of the places I\u2019d dreamed of seeing all my life. Edinburgh. Tahiti. Beijing. Granted, I would see them at night, but still, I could go. I would just have to talk to Gabriel about safety precautions and passport issues for the undead.</p><p>I could adopt one of those orphans on TV who make you feel so guilty. Hell, I could adopt a whole family. I would donate a catalogue full of children\u2019s and young adult books to the library. I could secure funding for Half-Moon Hollow High School\u2019s computer lab. (The students were still using Commodores.)</p><p>I would have to do all of this anonymously. You wouldn\u2019t believe how quickly relatives come out of the woodwork when money comes into play. Lottery wins bring out kin you never knew existed, and they all have inventions to invest in, trailer payments to be made. My cousin Glory (who was, sadly, male) won a $10,000 scratch-off once, and within twelve hours, our great-uncle Stuart had moved his camper onto Glory\u2019s driveway.</p><p>Of course, if my family found out I had money, I\u2019m pretty sure I would die in a mysterious window-treatment accident, and Jenny would immediately claim it as my next of kin. And given my last couple of months, death by Venetian blinds was becoming more likely.</p><p>Note to self: Write a will. Leave everything to Zeb.</p><p>I squealed and hopped into Gabriel\u2019s arms, wrapping my legs around his waist. Fortunately, he did not drop me. \u201cYou are now dating a very well-off woman. And I know it would be against your gentlemanly principles to ask just how well off. And it\u2019s even further against my own good character to tell you. But let me put it this way, if you ever run into financial trouble, you don\u2019t have to worry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s sweet but unnecessary,\u201d he said, pulling me against him.</p><p>\u201cMaybe I\u2019ll let you be my cabana boy.\u201d I sighed.</p><p>\u201cI will not dignify that with a response.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled but held me to his chest with a sort of quiet desperation, pulling me so close that breathing would have been an issue if I needed oxygen. Obviously, his conversation with Ophelia had upset him more than he was letting on. Was this Jeanine an old girlfriend? A current girlfriend? What sort of \u201csituation\u201d would require the council to step in and interfere?</p><p>As Gabriel clung to me, I stroked his hair, knowing that no matter what I said or asked, it wouldn\u2019t make either of us feel better. So I let him hold me and pretended that everything was fine. It was the loneliest I\u2019d ever felt in his presence.</p><p>11</p><p>Over the past 100 years, female weres have embraced certain human mating rituals. Werewolf males who neglect to present their mates with meat or floral offerings on a birthday or anniversary can expect to sleep in an actual doghouse.</p><p>\u2014Mating Rituals and Love Customs of the Were</p><p>I was a little nervous about what vampires get each other for Valentine\u2019s Day, because, as far as I knew, it could involve actual hearts.</p><p>So, when I found a white box on my doorstep, tied with a huge red bow, I went into full-on spastic girlie-girlie mode. There was squealing. A lot of squealing. For just a minute, the inside of my head was like a living Lisa Frank poster.</p><p>The contents were ... unexpected. For one thing, I didn\u2019t know whether Gabriel was actually going to be in town on Valentine\u2019s Day. And second, I\u2019m usually a white cotton panties kind of girl, occasionally a black cotton panties kind of girl. But if Gabriel was game for the red satin bustier thing, I could give it a try.</p><p>Yes, giving your girlfriend naughty lingerie for Valentine\u2019s Day is tired and clich\u00e9, and I\u2019d spent years railing against the commercialism and crassness of a holiday designed by corporate America to compel men to buy their way into a lady\u2019s affections and make single women feel pathetic and alone. Of course, at the time, I was pathetic and alone, so pardon me for taking the opportunity to feel smug for a day.</p><p>Gabriel\u2019s gift was a modern twist on the classic Victorian corset, buttery soft satin in a perfect Valentine\u2019s red, stretched over whalebone. It was some sort of miracle underwear, cinching my waist into a tiny point and giving me anatomically improbable cleavage, all without cracking my ribs. The hem of the bustier just barely skirted a pair of satin briefs, which were connected to a pair of lacy black stockings with the thinnest of red silk ties. I struck a languorous pose in the mirror and\u2014despite looking pretty damned hot, if I do say so myself\u2014felt a little ridiculous. I looked like a cover model for the romance paperbacks my mother read. All I needed was a title like The Tempestuous Schoolmarm spelled out over my head in an overcurlicued font. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Still, I slinked around the house and lit the vanilla candles. I wanted to build some ambience for Gabriel to appreciate before I jumped him. My home was considerably more welcoming than it had been the last time he visited. I hadn\u2019t had disposable income in a while, so after months of scrimping and saving and buying generic market-brand blood, I went into a sort of online shopping fit. I bought blackout curtains for every window in the house, a new comfy couch, a bigger fridge. I even booked a prefab contractor to come out and attach the garage to the house with a covered walkway. It was like babyproofing for someone with fangs.</p><p>I was feeling adored and very in touch with my inner sex kitten when he showed up at my door later that night.</p><p>\u201cSomeone earned himself a very nice Valentine\u2019s Day \u2018dinner,\u2019 \u201c I purred, leaning against the door frame. \u201cIn case you didn\u2019t notice, \u2018dinner\u2019 was in special naughty secret-meaning quotation marks.\u201d</p> <p>Gabriel stared at me, his expression blank. I liked to think it was the barely there black dress I was wearing over the lingerie hindering his neurological processes, but ... no.</p><p>\u201cThe lingerie ... the red satin thing with little garters ...\u201d I watched his face go from blank to thunderous. \u201cJudging from that expression, you have no idea what I\u2019m talking about, do you?\u201d My stomach seemed to ripple as I squirmed in the suddenly icky red undergarments. \u201cOh, not good.\u201d</p><p>I started toward the stairs, then turned on him, hands on hips. \u201cWait, what did you send me for Valentine\u2019s Day?\u201d</p><p>His face was set in grimmer lines but for a totally different reason.</p><p>\u201cValentine\u2019s Day, commemorating the martyrdom of Saint Valentine, patron saint of beekeeping, epileptics, and greeting-card manufacturers?\u201d I said. There was a beat of silence where I was smacked in the head with a clue-by-four. \u201cYou didn\u2019t get me anything for Valentine\u2019s Day, did you?\u201d</p> <p>Gabriel cleared his throat. \u201cValentine\u2019s Day was not something we recognized in my day.\u201d</p><p>I poked him in the chest. \u201cFirst of all, yes, it was. Lacy cards and love tokens were widely exchanged even in Victorian times. By now, you should know better than to screw with me on historical trivia. Also, you\u2019ve had one-hundred-forty-something years to adjust. Get with the program. You didn\u2019t notice the giant hearts and paper cupids hanging off every stationary object?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never dated a modern woman before.\u201d</p><p>I poked him again. \u201cYou can only use that as an excuse so many times. And don\u2019t offer to give me \u2018awesome sex\u2019 as a present, because I think we\u2019ve established that given the right circumstances, I can hurt you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t going to\u2014\u201d I narrowed my eyes at him. Instead of finishing that ill-fated protest, he said, \u201cLet\u2019s focus on the creepy anonymous gifts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t say \u2018creepy.\u2019 Don\u2019t try to get in good with me by talking like me. I just don\u2019t understand how someone could select a pitch-perfect girlfriend Christmas gift and then completely ignore Valentine\u2019s Day.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell, what did you get me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou will never, ever know,\u201d I promised him. And he wouldn\u2019t. Because now that I\u2019d made such a big deal about it, boxer shorts with little glow-in-the-dark vampire lips and fangs all over them didn\u2019t seem that great.</p><p>\u201cLet me see the gifts you did get,\u201d he said. \u201cYou were going to show me.\u201d</p><p>I crossed my arms over my chest. \u201cNot now I\u2019m not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJane.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d I slid the straps off my shoulders and let the dress pool at my feet. Gabriel\u2019s eyes went wide as he scanned me from head to toe. \u201cGabriel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGive me a moment. All of the blood just drained out of my head.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI find this whole thing to be incredibly gross now that I know I\u2019m wearing some stranger\u2019s undies.\u201d I shuddered and shrugged out of the suddenly disturbing get-up.</p> <p>And now I was naked and embarrassed, which was a sensation I was much more familiar with. The phone rang.</p><p>\u201cSaved by the bell,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>\u201cIf we had time, I\u2019d tell you about that figure of speech\u2019s origins in connection to gravedigging, but I\u2019m not going to,\u201d I said, picking up the phone. \u201cNo gift means no trivia.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd yet somehow I think I\u2019ll survive,\u201d Gabriel groused.</p><p>I gave him a meaningful look as I barked a greeting into the phone. A sly female voice asked, \u201cDid you like the presents?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho is this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Andrea.\u201d The voice on the other end of the line sounded hurt.</p><p>\u201cHi. I don\u2019t\u2014I can\u2019t talk right now,\u201d I whispered. Gabriel\u2019s eyes narrowed at the stress in my voice, and language that, after I thought about it, sounded awfully suspicious. \u201cI\u2019ll call you later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d she asked.</p><p>I turned away from Gabriel and tried to lower my voice even further, but let\u2019s face it, my boyfriend had superhearing.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t really explain. Let\u2019s just say the words \u2018Happy Valentine\u2019s Day\u2019 are probably going to make my eye spontaneously twitch for years to come,\u201d I grumbled as Gabriel stared at me, his expression annoyed and somehow helpless.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Andrea cried.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to talk now,\u201d I told her through gritted fangs as Gabriel took a subtle but deliberate step toward me, his ear cocked toward the phone. I shot him a venomous look and started into the next room.</p><p>\u201cBut I left that package on your front porch to help things along. Seriously, that outfit was flawless, practically a foolproof recipe for the perfect first Valentine\u2019s Day as a couple. How could you screw this up?\u201d Andrea cried, using that tone my mama used when I\u2019d butchered a recipe.</p><p>\u201cThat was you?\u201d I demanded, keeping my voice low. \u201cWhat\u2014why? Wh\u2014you and I are going to have to have a serious discussion about boundaries. What the hell were you thinking?\u201d</p><p>Her voice lowered to a slightly more contrite level. \u201cWell, I\u2019ve known Gabriel for a while, and he\u2019s just not the type of guy who puts a lot of stock in relationship milestones like a first Valentine\u2019s Day. I knew you would freak out and read a lot into it if it looked as if he forgot. And I knew he wouldn\u2019t ask for help or accept advice on what to get you, so I thought I\u2019d help you out. I thought he\u2019d be so thunderstruck at the sight of you in simply stunning underwear that you wouldn\u2019t have time to talk about where it came from.\u201d</p><p>If she wasn\u2019t so depressingly right, it would really piss me off that Andrea had managed to figure out my relationship before I did. No, wait, I was pissed anyway.</p><p>\u201cWe have got to get you dating again, because you clearly have too much time on your hands,\u201d I told her. \u201cThis is not normal behavior.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s very normal behavior to want your friend to have a nice Valentine\u2019s Day. What\u2019s not normal is you somehow turning this into some Jane disaster. Hell, even your grandma Ruthie knows to buy lingerie on Valentine\u2019s Day. I saw her at Victoria\u2019s Secret the other night. She said she was getting something special for her fianc\u00e9. I thought her fianc\u00e9 died.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, my God, why are you making this worse?\u201d I cried. I didn\u2019t know whom I felt more sorry for at that point, myself or poor, unsuspecting Wilbur. \u201cI do not need that image in my head. And as much as I appreciate your intentions, don\u2019t ever do this again. It\u2019s weird. Wait, wait, if you thought we would be all naked and blissful by now, why are you calling?\u201d I asked, ignoring the way Gabriel\u2019s eyebrows shot up at that comment.</p><p>\u201cWell, even vampires have a recovery period.\u201d</p><p>I scrunched my nose. \u201cEw. That\u2019s a conversation ender. I\u2019ll call you later.\u201d I hung up the phone and turned on Gabriel. \u201cI\u2019m going to take a shower. Maybe you shouldn\u2019t be here when I get out.\u201d</p><p>Leaving a trail of discarded lingerie in my wake, I stomped toward the bathroom. I turned the water to the white-hot range, slid into the shower, and fought back tears. Oh, how was I mortified? Let me count the ways. One, I put on strange underwear collected from my doorstep without knowing whom it was from or what they could have done to it. Two, my boyfriend blew off Valentine\u2019s Day. Three, my girlfriend was so sure this might happen (and rightly so) that she provided me with a pity present to get me laid. Four, I had images of a teddy-clad Grandma Ruthie doing some sort of fan dance in my head. And five, my boyfriend blew off Valentine\u2019s Day.</p><p>I thought that bore repeating.</p><p>I soaped my hair, deliberately avoiding the almond-scented antifrizz shampoo Gabriel liked in favor of plain old Pantene. I heard the bathroom door open. Gabriel came in and sat on the bathroom counter.</p><p>\u201cJane, we\u2019ve talked about this,\u201d he said softly. \u201cI\u2019m your sire and your lover. My bond to you is very strong. I won\u2019t share you with another man, even if he does have impeccable taste in lingerie.\u201d</p><p>That was sort of a confession of love, right?</p><p>I snapped the shower curtain open, glaring at him through the soap bubbles slipping down my face. \u201cWhy is it that your first assumption is that it\u2019s another man? What about me makes you think I would cheat on you?\u201d Then I snapped the curtain closed.</p><p>Somehow, his voice lowered even further, his tone worn thin. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I can make you happy, Jane. That makes me sick inside. I see the regrets you have. I see the longing in your eyes when you talk about your life before, the things you miss. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m good for you. There are times when I wonder if you\u2019re really happy as a vampire, whether you wish I\u2019d never met you that night. If some part of you would be happier as a human.\u201d</p><p>This time, I slung the curtain so hard the rings popped off the curtain rod. \u201cWell, of course, some part of me would be happier as a human, you dumbass!\u201d I yelled. \u201cFor one thing, I wouldn\u2019t spontaneously combust when I wanted to, say, take a walk before sunset. I wouldn\u2019t have to put up with my mother\u2019s undead denial issues. I wouldn\u2019t have to worry about people shrinking away every time I walk into a room. And I\u2019d be able to eat. I haven\u2019t eaten in months, do you realize that? No carbs, no fats, no chocolate. Nothing! I mean, do you know what it\u2019s like for someone like me, not being able to get chocolate?\u201d</p><p>Gabriel was obviously unprepared for the level of anger (or volume) in this wet, naked outburst. Looking slightly dazed, he closed what was left of the curtain. He was barely audible over the sound of the shower spray. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t realize you were so miserable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not. I\u2019m not miserable. But I\u2019m not completely happy as a vampire. And it\u2019s not fair for you to expect me to be. If you want a real, honest relationship, I can\u2019t put on a happy fanged face for you. Were you thrilled with your new life after you were turned?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but my family did tie me naked to a tree to wait for the sunrise,\u201d he pointed out calmly. \u201cWe\u2019re straying from the point.\u201d</p><p>I stuck my head under the rapidly cooling spray. \u201cWhich is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat another man is sending you underwear.\u201d</p><p>I could let him keep wondering, I mused, rolling my eyes. I could let Gabriel think I had a secret admirer, make him jealous. After weeks of wondering where he was, what he was doing, whom he was with, he deserved it. But I\u2019d never been that girl, the game player, the girlfriend who played by asinine \u201crules\u201d laid out in the self-help book of the week. And even though it would probably make me feel better, I don\u2019t think Gabriel pushing a tree on top of some poor guy he suspected of being my suitor would help our relationship.</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t another man,\u201d I huffed. \u201cIt was Andrea.\u201d</p><p>There was a heavy silence on the other side of the curtain. \u201cEr ... that wasn\u2019t something I was prepared for. I thought maybe it was Zeb.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEw!\u201d I cried.</p><p>\u201cWell, he\u2019s been acting so strange lately,\u201d Gabriel protested. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t see how Andrea giving you sexy underthings is any less disturbing. I don\u2019t think anyone should be buying you sexy underthings but me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you didn\u2019t.\u201d I cut the water off and snapped the curtain open. I pushed past him and snatched a towel. He grabbed my hand and pulled me to eye level with him. \u201cAndrea felt the need to step in for you. Instead of assuming the worst, you could just talk to me, Gabriel,\u201d I said as he followed me into my bedroom. I yanked open a dresser drawer and pulled out my flannel cow pajamas.</p><p>\u201cNot the cow pajamas, Jane, please, there\u2019s no reason to let this ruin our evening,\u201d he groaned. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeg pardon?\u201d I asked, cupping my hand around my ear. \u201cWhat was that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou heard me,\u201d he grumbled. \u201cWith our hearing, it\u2019s impossible for you not to have heard me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t believe I did,\u201d I said. \u201cBecause I\u2019m sure the Master of Poise could not possibly have just apologized to little old me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSmugness is not attractive on you, Jane.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSmugness is one of my best features,\u201d I retorted, backing him against the footboard of my bed. \u201cI\u2019m really, really good at it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve noticed,\u201d he muttered, nuzzling his nose along my jawline. Laughing, he slipped his hand through my hair and kissed my temple.</p><p>I shrugged him off. \u201cHey, I\u2019m still mad at you, Valentine\u2019s Day skipper. You are going to be punished. And not in the fun way.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI acquiesce to your demands,\u201d he said solemnly. He nodded at my bovine sleepwear. \u201cNow, I think you should take this off.\u201d</p><p>I snorted. \u201cNot going to happen, my friend.\u201d</p><p>And it didn\u2019t. Instead of hot Valentine\u2019s Day sex, I made Gabriel paint my toes lavender (he has incredibly steady hands) while we watched the most dreaded of all chick flicks, Sleepless in Seattle. I would say he learned his lesson, but I caught him wiping at his eyes toward the end.</p> <p>\u201cAre you crying?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d he exclaimed. I snickered and patted his shoulder. \u201cIt\u2019s just, it was so unlikely, the two of them showing up at the Empire State Building at the same time after missing each other so often. And\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want to sleep over?\u201d I asked suddenly.</p><p>\u201cWill I have to sleep on the couch?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you can sleep in the guest room,\u201d I said sweetly as I secured the blackout curtains.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019d rather make a run for my house,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>I pulled back the comforter for him. \u201cFine.\u201d</p><p>He grinned and stripped down to his slacks. As a habit, Gabriel didn\u2019t wear underwear. I guess he wasn\u2019t feeling secure enough in my good humor to sleep in the nude. He fluffed the pillows on both sides of the bed and flopped down in giddy anticipation.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just excited,\u201d he said, grinning.</p><p>I rolled my eyes as I reached for the bedside lamp. \u201cJust for the record, this is my first coed sleepover since Zeb and I were in fifth grade. And even then, Mama made Zeb sleep on a different floor of the house. I am the spoonee, by the way. You are the spooner.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t spoon,\u201d Gabriel said.</p><p>\u201cWell, you do now,\u201d I told him, wrapping his arms around my waist. \u201cYou don\u2019t snore, do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t breathe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood point.\u201d</p><p>It was nice to know that our bodies still fit together perfectly outside the sexual arena. Gabriel rested his head on my shoulder, drawing my back against his chest and his knees under my knees. We lay in silence, and I burst out laughing.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Gabriel asked. \u201cAm I not doing the spooning right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s great.\u201d I giggled. \u201cBut sunrise is not for another four hours. We\u2019re basically going to bed at the equivalent of two P.M. We\u2019ve officially become the least interesting people we know. And considering that we drink blood and burst into flame when we tan, that\u2019s sort of sad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re saying the magic\u2019s gone,\u201d Gabriel said.</p> <p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, it was nice while it lasted.\u201d Gabriel released me and started climbing out of bed. \u201cI\u2019ll be going now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOK, well, keep in touch.\u201d I clasped his hand. \u201cIt was nice knowing you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks. You, too.\u201d</p><p>I yanked his hand, forcing him back into the bed and rolling over me. He kissed me to show me exactly how boring we were.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry I ruined your Valentine\u2019s Day,\u201d he murmured against my neck, his voice soft on my skin. \u201cI didn\u2019t know it was so important to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you do now. You\u2019ve been put on notice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad we\u2019re sleeping together,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cOf course you are,\u201d I snorted. \u201cYou have a Y chromosome.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mean sleeping, as in resting,\u201d he said, pulling me flush against him. \u201cIt\u2019s very intimate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never should have let you watch Sleepless in Seattle,\u201d I moaned. \u201cI\u2019ve ruined you.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel did not snore. Nor did he squirm around or steal covers, which made him a far more considerate bedmate than Fitz. At dusk, I could feel the sun fading as I rolled against the contours of his side. It was sweet to wake up next to him, to see his face relaxed and his mouth hanging open. Everything was still, quiet.</p><p>I slipped my hand around his back and snuggled my face into his neck. It was oddly cool. I inhaled deeply, trying to memorize the scent of sleep on his skin, soft and clean and sweet.</p><p>I closed my eyes and swallowed against the rising sensation in my chest, a mixture of happiness that I\u2019d finally arrived at this place in my life and fear that it would be over soon. I was even less experienced at long-term relationships than I was at decent sex. And what did I really know about either? Pledging your eternal love took on a whole new meaning when you actually lived forever.</p><p>What if Gabriel got bored with me? What if he woke up in both senses of the word and realized that I was really the same boring librarian under the fancy new fangs? What if Jeanine was the last vampire girl he\u2019d cast off? Or worse yet, the vampire girl he was planning to be with once he\u2019d cast me off?</p><p>These were heavy thoughts to have at vampire dawn. The noise of the gears turning in my head must have jarred Gabriel awake, because he stirred next to me, pulling on the front of my cow pajamas until I was flush against his chest.</p><p>\u201cMorning,\u201d he rumbled.</p><p>\u201cMorning,\u201d I whispered into his neck. \u201cYou sleep with your mouth open.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI learn something new from you every day,\u201d he murmured, kissing my temple and stroking my back. He pulled me under him. I felt boneless, liquid, more relaxed than I\u2019d been in weeks. I belonged here. I was wanted. I didn\u2019t even worry about morning breath when Gabriel pressed his lips to mine, because, technically, neither of us had breath at any time of day.</p><p>The remnants of my unhappy thoughts still haunting me, I took the time to run my fingertips along his long, sinewy limbs, his smooth, pale skin. I cupped my palms around his cheeks, lazily tracing the line of his bottom lip with my thumb. I was almost beyond caring when Gabriel peeled my pajama top over my head.</p><p>\u201cI hate these pajamas,\u201d he muttered, tossing them over the edge of the bed. \u201cThe pajamas must go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe pajamas stay,\u201d I told him. He arched his eyebrows, making me giggle. \u201cWell, not at the moment, obviously.\u201d</p><p>He snickered, pushing the bottoms down to my ankles with his feet. He tucked his fingers between my hips and the waistband of my panties and tugged. The cotton buckled and tore, landing in a frayed heap next to my pajamas.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you have against my panties?\u201d I moaned, mourning the loss of yet another pair.</p><p>He smirked, casting a glance to where he was brushing against my wet, willing flesh. \u201cWell, I think that should have been fairly obvious.\u201d</p><p>I was still laughing when he slipped inside me. I stretched my arms above my head, gripping the headboard as he trailed kisses down my chest, increasing his pace. The deeper he drove, the tighter I held on, until I ripped the wood spokes out of the frame. I gasped, horrified at what I\u2019d done to a family heirloom. And then I just gasped, lost in the waves of sensation that threatened to drag me under.</p><p>When I came to, I still had the hunks of wood clutched in my hands. Gabriel looked vaguely guilty.</p><p>\u201cWe made it to a bed,\u201d he offered meekly.</p><p>\u201cAnd then we destroyed it,\u201d I moaned. \u201cBut it was worth it.\u201d</p><p>He pulled me onto his chest, pushing my hair out of my face before pulling me close.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s kind of weird to see Mr. Big Bad Vampire being all cuddly.\u201d I chuckled. \u201cIt kind of destroys your mystique.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t had a lot of good, soft things in my life,\u201d he said against my forehead. \u201cNot since my family sent me away. Apart from being your sire and feeling that pull to you, it\u2019s that goodness, that softness and warmth, along with the resolve and strength in you, that I love. Being turned hasn\u2019t taken that from you. If someone were going to design the perfect mate for me, it would be you. Even when you infuriate me with your pigheaded stubbornness and your temper and incredible lack of anything resembling self-preservation\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop describing me, please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the most fascinating, maddening, adorable creature I\u2019ve ever met,\u201d he said, sighing and pushing my hair out of my eyes. \u201cSo, when I seem possessive or I\u2019m raving like a lunatic, it\u2019s just that part of me is still very afraid that I\u2019ll lose that\u2014that I\u2019ll lose you. I love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s such a normal boyfriend thing to say. I\u2019m so proud and yet a little freaked out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop joking and listen to me,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m being serious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo am I,\u201d I objected. \u201cThat was a very normal thing for a boyfriend to say.\u201d</p><p>He grinned down at me. \u201cDoes that mean I\u2019m your boyfriend?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, my Lord, this is such a juvenile conversation to have with a hundred-and-fifty-year-old man,\u201d I groaned. \u201cYes, Gabriel, I would like you to be my boyfriend. I think we should go steady. I don\u2019t want to be with any other vampire but you. I love you. Idiot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe need new nicknames for each other,\u201d he said. When I shoved at his shoulders, he grinned. \u201cI haven\u2019t loved anyone in a long time. And I\u2019m glad it\u2019s you. I\u2019m glad I met you on the worst day of your life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you certainly made it more memorable.\u201d</p><p>12</p><p>Bachelorette parties are less about celebrating the bride\u2019s acquisition of a husband and more about making the female relatives feel vindication after the wedding planning process.</p><p>\u2014Mating Rituals and Love Customs of the Were</p><p>When we were kids, Zeb and I used to spend post-sleepover mornings eating Cap\u2019n Crunch and watching the Smurfs. Somehow, I didn\u2019t think Gabriel would appreciate the same routine.</p><p>I padded into the kitchen, still clad in flannel cows, and warmed up a healthy breakfast of donated Type A. Gabriel let Fitz out to snag the evening edition of the Half-Moon Herald from the end of the driveway. Unfortunately, Gabriel overestimated Fitz\u2019s capabilities and had to get the paper himself. We climbed onto the porch swing to sip blood and read the happenings in the Herald while Fitz gamboled around the yard chasing his own tail.</p><p>It was strangely domestic, with the exception of finding another package on my doorstep. We were both relieved that it was just the genealogical information Daddy had found on Mr. Wainwright\u2019s family. Despite my library background, my strength tends toward database research, whereas Daddy excels with the dusty-old-book route. After Mr. Wainwright lamented his lack of family history, I\u2019d asked Daddy to use his mojo.</p><p>Gabriel left for some council meeting, and I ripped into the research without bothering to change out of my pajamas. Daddy had done an impressive job. He found copies of Mr. Wainwright\u2019s old school pictures from Half-Moon Hollow Public School archives and an old newspaper clipping announcing Gilbert Wainwright\u2019s engagement to Brigid Brannagan, a girl he met while traveling in County Cork. Daddy found Mr. Wainwright\u2019s parents\u2019 marriage certificate and both of their obituaries. Searching through old records kept in the courthouse basement\u2014records Daddy accessed through a school chum named Deeter who worked there as a night janitor\u2014Daddy found the origins of the Wainwright family. Gilbert Wainwright\u2019s father, Gordon Wainwright, was the son of Albert Wainwright, son of Eugenia Wainwright, a laundry woman who had worked on the Cheney family farm. She had Albert in 1879 but drowned a short time later during the town\u2019s inaugural Fourth of July picnic down at the riverfront.</p><p>Eugenia was unmarried, and there was no father listed on the birth certificate for young Albert. Albert was sent to an orphanage and raised there until he ran away at age ten. According to a book Daddy found in the library\u2019s special collections, called The Hollow Frontier, Albert worked at the railway station and eventually took a job on a barge traveling the Ohio River, before returning home to the Hollow in the 1920s. He was known for opening one of the first successful saloons in the Hollow, the one my great-grandmother burned. While water-stained and crumbling, the book contained a copy of a tintype of Albert.</p><p>\u201cOh, man,\u201d I breathed, startled by Albert\u2019s face. I flipped to Daddy\u2019s research on Eugenia, whom one of the groundskeepers at the Cheney farm described as a \u201cbig buxom piece of woman.\u201d</p><p>I flipped back to the picture of Albert, who bore a striking resemblance to Dick. The same light, laughing eyes, the same devilish smile, the same long, patrician nose. But Albert looked to be at least fifteen years older than Dick had been when he was turned. I checked the date on the photo and did some quick math in my head, then groaned. \u201cDang it.\u201d</p><p>I sat at Specialty Books\u2019 counter, drumming my fingers compulsively against the glass. Mr. Wainwright was puttering in the back, tossing his way through the reference section I\u2019d just spent the better part of two days cataloguing. Knowing that my nephew Andrew had a birthday coming up, he insisted that a tome entitled A Pop-Up Dictionary of Demons would be a perfect gift. I was inclined to agree with him, because it might make Jenny swallow her tongue.</p><p>In a rare show of discretion, I didn\u2019t mention my discovery to Mr. Wainwright. I wanted to surprise him somehow, and I didn\u2019t think blurting it out as soon as I opened the door would fit the occasion.</p><p>The front doorbell tinkled, and I turned to find Mr. Wainwright\u2019s long-lost great-granddaddy standing at the counter with a scowl on his face.</p><p>\u201cWell, Jane, you crook your little finger, and I come running,\u201d Dick said, clearly in a very grumpy mood. \u201cSeems I\u2019m always running after women who aren\u2019t interested.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAndrea turned you down again, huh?\u201d</p><p>He made a sour face. The more I stared at him, the more I saw a resemblance to Albert\u2014and, for that matter, to Mr. Wainwright. My employer had a smaller build and more delicate features but the same tilting smile, the same green, twinkling eyes. I was a little ashamed that I had missed it. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWell, we could reminisce about the girl who didn\u2019t get away,\u201d I offered. \u201cDick, do you remember a woman named Eugenia? She used to work at your house?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he said. His lips quirked at a memory I wouldn\u2019t touch with a ten-foot pole, then locked into a completely un-Dick-like grimace.</p><p>\u201cDid you know that she left your employ because she got pregnant out of wedlock? And that she drowned about six months after giving birth to the\u2014\u201d He refused to meet my gaze, looking to the left.</p> <p>\u201cYou already know, don\u2019t you?\u201d I said. \u201cYou know about the baby, about Albert. You know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you\u2014who told you\u2014how\u2014\u201d he spluttered.</p><p>\u201cWhich question do you want me to answer first?\u201d I asked, cringing.</p><p>\u201cJane, you need to stay out of this,\u201d he whispered darkly. \u201cJust forget you ever found any of this. Don\u2019t say a word to Gilbert.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut why?\u201d I asked. \u201cWhy not just tell him? I think he would be thrilled to know he had a family. I love him, but I\u2019m not related to him. He loves talking to you. I saw you together at the Christmas party.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cStop,\u201d Dick said, grabbing my shoulders and covering my mouth with his hand as he cast panicked glances at the rear of the shop. \u201cYou\u2019re meddling in something you have no part in. Whatever good deed you think you\u2019re doing here, just stop. This is none of your business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust butt out, Jane.\u201d The bell clattered to the floor as he slammed the door behind him. Mr. Wainwright, disturbing pop-up book in hand, hobbled up to the counter. \u201cWas Dick here? I thought I heard his voice.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cJust some guy who insisted that we were, in fact, the adult video store next door. He was very upset by our limited selection.\u201d</p><p>Mr. Wainwright laughed, handing me the book. \u201cMaybe we should think about getting a new sign.\u201d</p><p>Generally, it\u2019s considered a faux pas for the bride\u2019s family to host a prewedding party for her. Fortunately, on the Great Invisible Scroll of Southern Wedding Etiquette, there\u2019s a loophole stating that if most of the guests are in the bride\u2019s family, it\u2019s acceptable. And werewolf women are very into prenuptial events. Jolene\u2019s festivities alone included two showers, a pounding, a mate-fasting, and something called a bloodening. The pounding is far less violent than it sounds, a party where family and friends give the happy couple a pound of some staple\u2014sugar, flour\u2014and items to set up their household. A bloodening, on the other hand ... well, we\u2019ll talk about that later.</p> <p>Tonight\u2019s agenda included kidnapping the bride to get her sloppy drunk and treating her to a parade of half-naked man flesh, which was some sort of McClaine female tradition. But since Jolene\u2019s cousins hadn\u2019t quite taken the initiative in planning, Jolene had to take matters into her own hands. She suggested we break into her trailer with a provided key to \u201csurprise\u201d her. It just happened to be on the night Jolene had reserved a table for eight at the Meat Market, the only all-male, nearly nude revue in the tristate area. Because nothing says \u201ccelebration of connubial bliss\u201d like men who spend a suspicious amount of time at the gym thrusting their spandex-covered man parts at desperate dollar-waving soccer moms.</p><p>And because I was the best maid, I got the \u201chonor\u201d of writing Raylene a check for the genitalia-shaped cake that would be gracing our table. I was also expected to foot the bar tab and serve as designated driver. I ended up driving Mimi\u2019s twelve-passenger van, which was necessary to haul the half-lit bridesmaids and gift bags containing penis-shaped note pads, refrigerator magnets, coasters, and ice-cube trays.</p><p>When the hell am I going to want penis-shaped ice cubes?</p><p>Our party was seated in the dark, humid, but surprisingly clean club, as Marcus the Matador completed his last twirl about the stage. Jolene was sporting a veil with little foam penises sewn on the hem and a T-shirt covered in Lifesavers that offered a \u201cSuck for a Buck,\u201d both of which were provided by her cousins, along with the penile party favors. Though the cousins\u2019 attention was currently focused on the butt-cheek bacchanalia, Jolene just seemed happy they showed up.</p><p>She looked so content, sitting there in her obscene veil, oblivious to the improbably dressed fireman shaking it to \u201cHot Stuff.\u201d Her expression was dreamy, extremely out of place considering the setting. It was just like the night she and Zeb announced their engagement, happiness bordering on a coma\u2014the announcement that I responded to by questioning their brain functions for getting married after such a short time. Zeb had to cart me outside before I further hurt Jolene\u2019s feelings. And when he told me she was a werewolf, I freaked out even more and accused Zeb of losing his mind.</p><p>Dang it. Dick had a point. I was a meddler.</p><p>\u201cDo you think I\u2019m intrusive?\u201d I shouted over a remix of \u201cIt\u2019s Raining Men.\u201d</p><p>She started and turned her lazy gaze at me. \u201cHmm?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAm I intrusive?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said, nodding. \u201cBut in a good way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow can you possibly be a good kind of intrusive?\u201d</p><p>She set her drink down, barely noticing when the verdant liquid splashed onto the already sticky table. \u201cWell, you can be bossy and suspicious and quick to judge. Sometimes your mouth writes a check your butt can\u2019t cash.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve discussed that you could agree with me less emphatically, yes?\u201d</p><p>She giggled. \u201cBut you do it \u2018cause you need to protect the people you love. And that\u2019s not such a bad thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that I can be sort of\u2014\u201d I paused and then settled for \u201coverbearing, when it comes to Zeb, his happiness and safety and hygiene. But I would like to say that I\u2019m really glad that he\u2019s marrying you.\u201d</p><p>She sniffed and threw her arms around me. There\u2019s nothing quite like an armful of drunk werewolf to help you find some perspective.</p><p>\u201cI love you, Jane,\u201d Jolene slurred. \u201cI love Zeb. I really love Zeb. He\u2019s the first man to ever see me as more than a pretty face and hot body.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nice that you\u2019re so modest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe treats me special, not because of who my parents are or because I\u2019m pretty but because, just because that\u2019s his way,\u201d she rambled. \u201cHe\u2019s gentle and sweet and he loves me. And I love him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you love Zeb.\u201d She giggled, the alcohol in her having clearly convinced her that this was a revelation.</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut not in a love-love way,\u201d she said suspiciously.</p><p>\u201cNope. I have a boyfriend. A boyfriend who engages in mind-blowing sex with me and then doesn\u2019t return my calls for two days, but a boyfriend all the same.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. \u2018Cause otherwise\u201d\u2014she heaved a drunken sigh and then giggled\u2014\u201dI\u2019d have to kick your ass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m aware.\u201d</p><p>The cousins turned around to see us hugging and collectively rolled their eyes. We straightened up and focused on the show.</p><p>\u201cSpeaking of your groom-to-be, where has he been lately?\u201d I asked. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen him in almost a week. Please don\u2019t take this as a gripe against him being in a grown-up relationship, but normally he comes by the house every once in a while.\u201d</p><p>Jolene rolled her eyes and sipped her drink. \u201cMama Ginger\u2019s been runnin\u2019 him ragged doin\u2019 chores around their place. She said she\u2019s afraid that after he\u2019s married, I\u2019m goin\u2019 to run him ragged, and he\u2019s not goin\u2019 to have time to take care of \u2018his poor agin\u2019 parents\u2019 anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut Zeb has never done chores at his parents\u2019 place. They don\u2019t do chores at their place. Instead of raking their leaves, they just set fire to their whole yard every fall.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think he\u2019s just doin\u2019 it to keep her off my back, poor thing,\u201d Jolene said. \u201cThe more he does, the less she complains about him \u2018abandonin\u2019 his family.\u2019 Of course, she still complains about me, but that\u2019s different ...\u201d</p><p>A shadow seemed to pass over Jolene\u2019s face. Her lip trembled, and I was afraid the drinks had caught up with her. I reached for her hand, but she straightened and took a deep breath. She stretched a too-wide smile over her face and turned her attention back to the stage.</p><p>\u201cI wonder how much he spends on body waxin\u2019?\u201d she mused.</p><p>I smirked. \u201cIt\u2019s probably a tax deduction. It\u2019s a necessary item. I mean, it takes a little hair and a lot of confidence to dance around in that get-up.\u201d</p><p>We tapped glasses. Jolene snorted. \u201cConfidence and a couple of gym socks.\u201d</p><p>After pouring several drunken lady werewolves into bed, I drove the McClaine van to River Oaks, taking a shortcut through a sketchier part of town. It was two streets over from where the shop is located. As I passed the Silver Bullet, a bar known for less-than-savory vampire traffic, I saw my grandma Ruthie\u2019s new beau walking out of the place, carrying a case of canned drinks. I managed to stop the van, no small feat for someone unaccustomed to piloting a land yacht, and pulled into a dark corner of the adjacent parking lot.</p><p>Without enhanced night vision, I wouldn\u2019t have been able to make out the labels on the cans, which read, \u201cSilver Sun Senior Health Shakes.\u201d It was the same kind of can Grandma Ruthie was toting around for Wilbur in her purse.</p><p>\u201cMaybe it\u2019s just a coincidence that he\u2019s walking out of a vampire bar at four A.M. carrying mysterious beverages,\u201d I murmured to myself as Wilbur hefted the case into his car. He looked around to make sure that no one was looking and popped the top of one can. He drained it in a few gulps, tossed it into a nearby Dumpster, and drove off.</p><p>\u201cWell, at least he doesn\u2019t litter,\u201d I muttered.</p><p>Unfortunately, I found that Wilbur hadn\u2019t tossed the can into an easy-to-find spot in the Dumpster when I inevitably climbed in to retrieve it.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe I\u2019m doing this.\u201d I grunted, sifting through endless beer bottles and newspapers drenched in a substance I dared not consider. \u201cThis is not normal, rational behavior, sifting through three days\u2019 worth of extremely pungent bar garbage to find your future step-grandpa\u2019s recyclables. There\u2019s probably a perfectly reasonable, rational explanation for Wilbur being here. This is probably just some black-market health shake with ingredients that aren\u2019t approved by the FD\u2014oh, dear gah!\u201d I squealed as something squirmed beneath my feet. I grabbed the can, leaped out of the Dumpster, and did the freaked-out girl dance for a few beats.</p><p>There was no list of ingredients on the side of the can. I held my \u201cprize\u201d to my supersensitive nose and sniffed. I sensed herbs, vitamins, some supplements for joint health (OK, that part was touted on the label), and beneath the slightly chalky bouquet, there was blood. Cold, dead pig\u2019s blood.</p><p>\u201cOK, maybe there\u2019s not a reasonable explanation.\u201d</p><p>I drove myself crazy over the next few days making complicated but ultimately useless \u201cExplanations for Wilbur\u2019s Drinking Pig\u2019s Blood\u201d line charts on legal pads.</p><p>This near-Oliver-Stone-level conspiracy theorizing kept me absorbed right up until the process server arrived on my doorstep. Jenny\u2019s lawyers were demanding that a forensic accountant look through all of my financial records to determine whether I\u2019d sold precious Early family heirlooms to pad my personal bank accounts during the course of her lawsuit. Against my better judgment, I had told Mama about the settlement, to assure her that I was financially secure for eternity and would never, ever need to move in with her, so please stop asking. And despite my dire warnings against doing so, Mama had mentioned my windfall to Jenny. And because Jenny does not believe I\u2019m capable of improving my own situation without screwing her over, she concluded that I was up to no good in the Hollow\u2019s vast antique black market. Basically, my sister was having me audited. Lovely.</p><p>Grumpy and frustrated beyond belief, I took advantage of my night off, turned off the phone, and, despite the siren\u2019s call of Sense and Sensibility, I read a few more chapters of Mating Rituals and Love Customs of the Were. I finally found what a bloodening was. The women of the clan get naked under the new moon and track down a deer, killing it as a pack and bringing it home for a shared meal. It was supposed to be held during the week of the wedding to assure the bride symbolically that she was still part of the clan and that she would always be welcome to share its food but also reminding her that she was responsible to continue the clan\u2019s traditions. It was a warm, though blood-soaked, sentiment. It was a special privilege for an outsider to be invited to witness a bloodening, much less run with the pack\u2014which, as you might have guessed, as best maid, I was expected to do. I was going to need some sturdy running shoes and a really good sports bra.</p><p>I do not run naked.</p><p>My lolling about on the porch swing in the cold, making no effort to leave the house, seemed to disturb Aunt Jettie. \u201cIs this sudden lean toward shiftlessness linked to all the time you\u2019ve been spending with Dick?\u201d Aunt Jettie said, in a tone that sounded eerily like Grandma Ruthie.</p><p>\u201cActually, Dick hasn\u2019t wanted to spend much time with me lately, Aunt Jettie. We had an argument and he\u2019s pretty irritated with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that why he\u2019s coming up the drive?\u201d She pointed to the driveway, where a battered El Camino was cutting through the dust. Dick climbed out of the car without making eye contact. He slinked up the porch steps and took a seat beside me. I closed my book and waited.</p><p>\u201cAm I supposed to talk first?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cGive me a minute.\u201d He cut me off with a slicing gesture.</p><p>We sat in silence, with me staring into the distance, wondering what to do with my hands. Finally, he said, \u201cI\u2019ve been scared to say anything to Gilbert because I didn\u2019t want him to be afraid of me or to turn away from me. It\u2019s one thing to read about vampires and ghosts, it\u2019s another to find out that you\u2019re related to one.\u201d</p><p>He studied the creases on his jeans. Unsure of my place in this exchange, I sat and waited.</p><p>\u201cI knew Eugenia had the baby. My parents paid to keep her away while she was pregnant. When she had him, most of the town whispered about him being mine, but I didn\u2019t do anything about it. I knew my parents were sending her money every month, and I figured that was all she needed from me. Don\u2019t make that face at me, Jane. I was young and mortal ... and stupid. I was sent away to handle some contrived piece of family business, and by the time I came back, my parents had sent the baby to an orphanage over in Murphy. They wouldn\u2019t hear of bringing him to our home. The scandal, they said, the shame\u2014even though I know for a fact my Daddy had several scandals of his own growing up around town. And then my parents died, and I lost the house to the jackass\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGabriel,\u201d I corrected.</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d he said. \u201cI told myself Albert was better off living at the orphanage, in a safe place, instead of bouncing around with me, living off card games, sleeping in a fine hotel one night and a ditch the next. That was just an excuse, of course. I didn\u2019t know anything about kids. I wouldn\u2019t have known what to do with him if I\u2019d had him. I was a terrible father but a fun uncle. I\u2019d visit Albert, give him penny candy and whatever money I could scrape together. But as soon as it came to real problems, the kid getting sick, getting into trouble at school, I was out of there.\u201d</p><p>He grimaced. \u201cWhen I got turned, I realized I shouldn\u2019t be around him. It would be too confusing for him, a mysterious uncle who never aged and only visited at night. I was a piss-poor role model, anyway. And the people I did business with, they wouldn\u2019t have minded roughing up a little boy to make a point. I stopped showing up for visits, and he ran away a couple of months later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did you do?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cPart of me was almost relieved,\u201d he admitted. \u201cI didn\u2019t have to worry. I didn\u2019t have to bother. And then he came back, full-grown and the spitting image of me, especially in some of his less legal habits. And it was ... nice. It was nice to be able to watch him, to see him running his business, being a man. I couldn\u2019t always agree with some of his decisions, but at that point, I was supposed to be about sixty years old and still looked thirty something. I couldn\u2019t exactly come back to give him a spanking and fatherly advice. He married, had a son. His son married, had a son. And I watched over them, all of them, watched them live their lives, enjoy their successes, make their mistakes. And most of their mistakes were a lot like mine. It\u2019s sort of the Cheney family curse.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGood with women, bad with money?\u201d I suggested.</p><p>He shrugged and smiled. \u201cI never made contact,\u201d he said. \u201cI was still hanging around with the same type of people, and the less likely they were to connect me to the family, the better. I couldn\u2019t stand it if any of them got hurt because of me. I thought I\u2019d gotten rid of the paper trail when I set the fire in the courthouse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do you tell me these things?\u201d I huffed. \u201cYou know I have a Girl Scout complex.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never made contact with them,\u201d he said, ignoring me. \u201cNot until Gilbert.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy Gilbert?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was the first in our family who looked like he might amount to something. He was such a good boy, and in a sincere way. He honestly cared about his mother, his little sister, his classmates at school, his country. He was one of the first boys in the Hollow to sign up for the Army after Pearl Harbor. He was the first man in our family to start college, much less finish it.\u201d Dick smiled proudly. \u201cAnd his sister was a sweet girl, just a little, well, stupid. But she was the first girl born to the family in about five generations, so she was special, too.</p> <p>\u201cWhen their father died and his mother was having trouble making ends meet, I came forward. Just knocked on the door one night. I didn\u2019t tell her who I was exactly, just a distant cousin who was interested in making sure the family was well taken care of. I think she knew there was something not quite right about me, especially when I told her I didn\u2019t want to meet the kids or tell them I was helping them. But she was too happy to accept my money to say anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI always got the impression that you were lucky to take care of yourself. How\u2019d you support a family?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cI have ways of making extra money when I need it,\u201d he said, slightly offended. \u201cWhen Gilbert needed money for graduate school, I sold a kidney on the black market for tuition.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can grow those back?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t my kidney.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd now we\u2019re back to the disturbing territory I\u2019m comfortable with.\u201d I snorted. \u201cSo, you\u2019re a family man, a loving patriarch. In essence, you\u2019re a total fraud.\u201d</p><p>He looked chastened. \u201cDon\u2019t tell anybody.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you going to tell him? I think it would mean a lot to Mr. Wainwright to know he has some family left.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat am I supposed to do? Come barreling into the store and shout, \u2018Hey, pal, wanna go outside and play catch with Grandpa?\u2019 \u201c</p><p>I shrugged. \u201cWell, you might want to work your way up to catch. He does have that bad hip. You should at least think about telling him. What have you got to lose?\u201d</p><p>Dick tucked his canines over his bottom lip. All pretense, all of the smug self-assurance, fell away as he said, \u201cWhat if he\u2019s ashamed of me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a vampire. You\u2019re the coolest grandpa on the block. He\u2019ll be thrilled.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll think about it,\u201d Dick said. Suddenly, he raised his voice and poked me in the shoulder. \u201cLet me work through this. Don\u2019t try to nudge the situation along. Don\u2019t drop hints or make conversational segues or\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI got it, I got it,\u201d I told him, raising my hands in self-defense. \u201cI wasn\u2019t even thinking about it.\u201d</p><p>Dick looked down his nose at me and arched his eyebrow.</p><p>\u201cOK, I was thinking about it a little bit.\u201d</p><p>13</p><p>Humans who prove unfaithful to their were-spouses are rarely heard from again.</p><p>\u2014Mating Rituals and Love Customs of the Were</p><p>My future step-grandpa was an enigma wrapped in a riddle stored in a Rubik\u2019s Cube, which I always had to resort to rearranging the stickers to solve. I won\u2019t pretend my interest was rooted in concern for my grandmother, just a general weakness in my character that would not allow me to leave a question unanswered.</p><p>For the record, four cans of Starbucks Double Shot Dark Blend Blood and Espresso is just enough to yank a vampire out of bed before sunset. Zeb wisely armed himself with caffeine before entering my daytime lair and enlisted Jettie\u2019s help in shoving me into an ice-cold shower (in my pajamas) to complete the wake-up process.</p><p>Some older vamps can venture out in the day under controlled circumstances with no problem. I blister and smell like burnt popcorn, which stays with you for days. So I slathered myself in Solar Shield SPF 500 sunscreen and donned huge Jackie O sunglasses and a wide-brimmed hat before venturing out to my newly sun-safe car. OK, fine. Zeb had the motor running, and I dove through the open door, unbelievably exhilarated by my not bursting into flames.</p><p>As he turned the key in the ignition, Zeb asked, \u201cRemind me again why we\u2019re risking you bursting into flame to drive seventy miles to visit some old folks\u2019 home?\u201d Clearly, he didn\u2019t appreciate the Mama-caliber guilt tactics I\u2019d used to get him to accompany me on this little excursion.</p><p>\u201cBecause when I snuck a look into Wilbur\u2019s wallet, this was the address on his ID.\u201d</p><p>Zeb was aghast. \u201cYou snuck a look at his wallet? When?\u201d</p><p>\u201cChristmas,\u201d I said, looking down to avoid his glare.</p><p>\u201cWhy would you do that?\u201d he demanded.</p><p>\u201cHe left it right there in his coat pocket, come on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not allowed to hang out with Dick anymore,\u201d he told me as he turned the ignition. \u201cSo, why couldn\u2019t we do this after dark?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI called the front desk pretending to be a potential resident\u2019s daughter. The nurse said dinner was served at three-thirty. And I\u2019m guessing the people we\u2019d want to talk to will be asleep by four.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a scary woman, Jane Jameson.\u201d</p><p>I shrugged, pulling my hood over my face and leaning my seat back to a snoozing position. \u201cI do what I can.\u201d</p><p>I jolted awake when Zeb cut Big Bertha\u2019s engine outside the Sunnyside Village Retirement Community. With one eye squinched shut, I wiped the drool off my cheek and looked around. The building seemed innocuous enough. Overtly cheerful yellow siding on a cracker-box building, glowing in the orange light of the fading sun. Newly painted white shutters framing windows with the shades drawn tight.</p><p>I pulled out my sunblock for safety touch-up. I\u2019d decided against gloves, as it was a typically mild early spring day, and full-length opera gloves would probably attract attention. The thick, white SPF 500 lotion took a while to absorb into my neck, chin, and hands. I pulled the hat over my eyes.</p><p>\u201cHow do I look?\u201d I asked, turning to him.</p><p>\u201cWell, if we were going to a performance of Kabuki Mugger Theater, this look would be perfect,\u201d he snorted, gesturing to my smudged jawline. \u201cYou might want to blend some more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDang it,\u201d I grumbled, swiping at my cheeks.</p><p>After a few more minutes of sunblocking, I carefully opened the door and stepped out. I gasped, enveloped in the sun for the first time since my turning. Even though it was weak late-afternoon light, I was overwhelmed by the warmth that swirled over my skin like a caress. The colors made me want to weep. I hadn\u2019t realized how monotonous the night sky could be. I\u2019d missed the burnt golds, the blushing pinks giving way to deep purple as the sun faded over the horizon. I smiled, stretching out my hands and basking in heat like a cat. And then ow. Ow. Owowowowowow.</p><p>I\u2019d forgotten to sunscreen the delicate webs between my fingers. Ow! It felt as if I\u2019d dipped my hands in acid. I stared in horror, transfixed as the skin sizzled and smoked.</p><p>\u201cPut your hands in your pockets, Jane!\u201d Zeb cried.</p><p>\u201cOh, right!\u201d I stuck my shaking hands into my jacket and turned my back to the light, doubling over, waiting for the pain to subside. After a few moments, I felt the tissue in my fingers knit itself together again, a new and unpleasant stinging sensation unto itself. I took a deep breath and straightened, flexing my fingers gingerly. Zeb was staring at me over Big Bertha\u2019s hood.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think you want to go in there with smoking hands that smell of blackened Jiffy Pop,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019ll just stay in the car,\u201d I said meekly.</p><p>\u201cProbably for the best,\u201d Zeb said, nodding and pressing his lips together in a resigned line.</p><p>I stayed huddled behind the heavily screened windows, napping, while Zeb ventured inside. I was tired, drained, all of my being focused on my raw, healing skin. When your mortality is taken out of the equation of life, you tend to take certain things, such as paralyzing agony, for granted. Is that what it would feel like to go out during the day? I imagined it was only a fraction of the pain an unprotected vampire would suffer in full sun. And even that small portion was torture. Of the few ways vampires could die, death by suntan was definitely at the bottom of the list.</p><p>A short time later, my partner in crime startled me awake with a sharp knock on the window.</p><p>\u201cI just barely convinced them that I was the great-grandson of the oldest guy there, whose name I did not know. I had to keep calling him Pappy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did he say?\u201d I asked, rubbing my tired eyes. \u201cHad he heard of Wilbur Goosen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, he was far more interested in a rerun of Matlock than talking to me. And then some other guy heard me say Wilbur\u2019s name, and he made the weirdest, wrinkliest face I\u2019d ever seen. Then he cursed at me in Lithuanian and whacked me with his cane,\u201d Zeb said, rubbing his arm gingerly. \u201cHe then switched to English and suggested I perform various sexual acts on myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you could do that by yourself, we would never see you,\u201d I said, despite the glare Zeb sent my way. \u201cHow did you know it was Lithuanian?\u201d</p><p>He seemed offended. \u201cLike you\u2019re the only smart one around here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry I put you through all of that for nothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, on the way out\u2014while I was dodging the cane\u2014a much nicer lady stopped me. She apparently had her hearing aids turned all the way up and heard our conversation. She was an old flame of Wilbur\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSay what now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen Wilbur Goosen lived at Sunnyside, he was quite the Don Juan. Ila Faye Pogue, the lady in question, was one heart torn asunder in the swath he cut across the Shuffleboard Circuit. At one point, there was a catfight in the rec room among three of his interests. Wigs and walkers and glass eyes flying everywhere ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need to think about that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMrs. Pogue had photos in her album. The administration was on the verge of asking Wilbur to leave when he just passed away in his sleep. It was very sudden.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe died? Are we sure she had the right Wilbur Goosen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow many Wilbur Goosens could there be?\u201d he pointed out. I nodded. \u201cBesides, she had pictures of the two of them. Kissing.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He showed me a sample photo. I winced. \u201cBleh. Don\u2019t I have enough randy geriatrics in my life? And she was sure he died?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, they buried him,\u201d he said, starting the car. \u201cSo, what would that make him? A vampire? A zombie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t really my area of expertise,\u201d I said. \u201cBut it explains the health shakes.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell, have you ever seen him during the day?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t see anybody during the day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t there some vampire tests we can do? We can make him touch silver, put him under a sun lamp. Oh, we can force-feed him garlic bread.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like your enthusiasm. But why don\u2019t we just ask him?\u201d I suggested.</p><p>\u201cWell, where\u2019s the fun in that?\u201d Zeb pouted. \u201cBesides, what are you going to say, \u2018Hi, I know you want to marry my grandma, who I\u2019m not on great terms with, but I was hoping you could tell me whether you\u2019re, you know, an undead gigolo hell-bent on killing her and taking the family fortune\u2019? I\u2019m sure that would improve your relationship with Ruthie. Come on, let\u2019s sprinkle silver shavings in his pants.</p> <p>\u201cWell, what are you going to do?\u201d he said when I ignored his proposal. \u201cFind his lair? Do your best Peter Cushing imitation?\u201d</p><p>I shot him the Arched Eyebrow of Bewilderment. He responded by wrapping his fingers around a pretend stake and made stabbing motions. At least, I hoped it was a pretend stake and stabbing motions, because otherwise our relationship just took an upsetting and inappropriate turn.</p><p>\u201cWhy would I do that?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cBecause he\u2019s evil!\u201d</p><p>I gaped at him. \u201cBecause he\u2019s probably not one hundred percent human, we should assume he\u2019s an evil monster?\u201d Zeb\u2019s face sagged into \u201coops\u201d lines. \u201cYeah, how\u2019s that foot taste?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d he said. \u201cSometimes I forget that you\u2019re not one hundred percent human.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHmph.\u201d</p><p>On the drive back to town, I tried to work up the nerve to bring up Zeb\u2019s odd behavior, the unexplained absences and \u201cchores\u201d at his mama\u2019s house. Was Zeb thinking about leaving Jolene at the altar? Was that even possible when you were mated to a werewolf?</p><p>Zeb avoided the fully exposed highways in favor of the more shaded backroads, where we were treated to fantastic scenery. Weeds almost high enough to hide the junked cars and defunct riding mowers. Trailers with rotting underpinning flapping in the wind. And there was a school bus parked next to almost every house, most of which did not appear able to run. I kept telling myself I would just blurt out the first question at the next trailer we saw, and the next, and the next. But I couldn\u2019t bring myself to do it. I wasn\u2019t sure if I wanted to know if Zeb was capable of jilting Jolene. I didn\u2019t want know if he was capable of hurting someone that way, of that level of deceit. These aren\u2019t thoughts you want to have about your best friend.</p><p>We were halfway back to the Hollow when I started feeling a little dizzy. I ignored it until the sensation turned into full-on vertigo. My throat was so dry. I looked at the clock. Crap.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Zeb asked. \u201cYou look pale ... er.\u201d</p><p>I covered my mouth with my hand and shook my head as a hot iron fist closed around my belly.</p><p>\u201cRemember when we were nine and we rode the Tilt-A-Nator until you threw up cotton candy in my lap?\u201d he asked. \u201cYou looked better then.\u201d</p><p>I braced myself against the dashboard, palms against the worn, warm faux leather. \u201cIt\u2019s just that I\u2014I\u2019m getting a little, um, hungry.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI thought you had a special little fridge in here for blood. Didn\u2019t you bring anything with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t think a bag lunch would be required,\u201d I said. \u201cI ate right before we left, but being out during the day\u2014I didn\u2019t realize it would be so draining.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about a store? Can we stop somewhere?\u201d</p><p>I doubled over as another cramp clenched my belly. I wheezed, \u201cThe closest store is Bubba\u2019s Beer and Bait, and that\u2019s about ten miles away. I don\u2019t think he carries bottled blood. In fact, Bubba has a little sign on his door that says, \u2018No Shoes, No Pulse, No Service.\u2019 \u201c</p><p>Zeb mulled that over. \u201cThey used to use the milk of young coconuts for a plasma substitute because of its high iron content. I saw it on the Discovery Channel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that will be really handy to know if we\u2019re ever stranded on a desert island.\u201d I smacked him. \u201cIf I can\u2019t get blood, how the hell am I going to get a young coconut?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know! I\u2019m sorry! I\u2019m panicking!\u201d he cried.</p><p>\u201cJust keep driving.\u201d I panted. \u201cTalk to me. Keep me thinking about something else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want me to talk about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnything! Your kindergartners, wedding stuff, anything!\u201d I exclaimed, wincing at the empty churning in my stomach. \u201cYou\u2019ve been talking my ear off for years, Zeb. Don\u2019t tell me you\u2019ve run out of things to say.\u201d</p><p>After a long silent moment, Zeb\u2019s voice came deep and clear. \u201cYou could feed from me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you think that would be weird?\u201d I said, thinking about the first feeding with Andrea. I hadn\u2019t fed from a human since that cringe-inducing attempt. And it was a good while before I was completely comfortable around her again.</p><p>\u201cI love you, Jane,\u201d he said, parking the car on the shoulder. \u201cI want to help. This is our last big stupid adventure. Let\u2019s go out with a bang.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think it would be\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cJane.\u201d</p><p>I sighed. \u201cI\u2019m not biting your neck. Too intimate.\u201d I made an icked-out face at him, prompting him to offer his wrist. \u201cAre you sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo it before I change my mind!\u201d he snapped, then yowled when my fangs pierced his skin. He tensed, then forced himself to relax, leaning back in the seat, avoiding contact beyond my mouth on his wrist. I focused on the mechanics of feeding, fangs into skin, sealing the lips around the wound to gently pull the blood to the surface. I thought fondly of Funyuns and Cokes sipped through uncapped Twizzlers, the sort of cuisine we enjoyed on afternoon trips to Hickman Lake after Zeb got his driver\u2019s license.</p><p>When he stroked a hand across my back, I shrugged it away. More insistent, his hand curled around my jaw, caressing my cheek as I fed. I did not want to think about the pseudo-Freudian aspects of penetration and oral fixation. This was lunch. This was take-out. At least, that\u2019s what I told myself until Zeb moaned a little, throwing his head back against the seat. This sly, creepy voice in my head whispered, You could take it all. Snuff out his life like a sputtering candle, turn him, keep him with you. A few more sips, he\u2019s enjoying it\u2014</p><p>\u201cStop,\u201d I said, pulling away. A sleepy, almost sensual expression had settled on Zeb\u2019s features, and he leaned back in the seat and stretched. He grinned conspiratorially at me as he rubbed his wrist.</p><p>\u201cYou OK?\u201d he asked, his eyes glazed over and hazy again. He seemed barely able to focus on me.</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d I promised, shaking away the guilt-inducing voice in my head. \u201cDoes it hurt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said, massaging his wrist, where a dark purple mark was forming. The wound was already closing up, but he would have the bruise for a while.</p><p>\u201cHere.\u201d I dragged my fingertip across a fang and made a tiny cut. I squeezed it over Zeb\u2019s wrist, letting a few drops of blood fall into the closing wound. The skin immediately healed, and the bruising vanished.</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d Zeb smiled fondly at me, stroking the tendrils of hair back away from my face. His voice sounded so far away, as if he was repeating lines he\u2019d heard in a movie. But it was the eyes that were unnerving. They were so vacant; there seemed to be no trace of Zeb in them.</p><p>His lips parted, and his breath quickened as he leaned toward me. A zing of panic slipped up my spine as his mouth drew closer to my own. I struck out, popping Zeb on the nose with my half-closed fist. It was sort of a cross between a punch and a slap, right in the middle of his face. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOw!\u201d he cried, now fully undazed and clutching his bleeding nostrils. \u201cWhat did you do that for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do not kiss me, you got it?\u201d I shouted.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean, I don\u2019t kiss you?\u201d he cried, tilting his head back against my seat as I shoved a tissue at him.</p><p>\u201cI mean, you don\u2019t kiss me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t going to kiss you,\u201d he insisted.</p><p>\u201cZeb, it\u2019s been a while, but I\u2019m pretty sure I recognize the ninety-five percent lean-in when I see it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe last thing I remember is your fangs breaking my skin,\u201d he said, dabbing at his nose and checking it in the rearview mirror.</p><p>\u201cYou honestly don\u2019t remember leaning toward me with your mouth half-open?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d</p><p>I stared at Zeb for a long time, debating whether I should look inside his mind and determine whether he was lying. Ultimately, I chickened out. Looking into his head at the moment seemed so intrusive ... and scary. Honestly, I wasn\u2019t sure if I wanted to know what the hell he was thinking. Or if he was thinking. What if the reason he seemed so unsatisfied with Jolene lately was that he was having feelings for me? How could he do that to either of us? How could he change the rules of our friendship that way without even telling me? How was I going to tell him that the two of us would never, ever be more than what we were?</p><p>What if I lost my best friend?</p><p>\u201cJust take me home,\u201d I said finally, slumping against the seat. We spent the rest of the drive in silence, with me staring out the window, trying to ignore the nervous bundle of BFF at the wheel. As soon as he pulled Big Bertha into my driveway, I threw a solar blanket over my head, yelped, \u201cGood night!\u201d and dashed for the door.</p><p>\u201cJane, we need to talk!\u201d Zeb called after me.</p><p>\u201cGood night!\u201d I yelled as I struggled to fit the key into the front door and keep the protective blanket in place.</p><p>I slammed the door behind me and threw the deadbolt in place, just in time to hear Zeb say, \u201cAll right, then.\u201d</p><p>I closed my eyes, praying he wouldn\u2019t come to the door and try to talk about what just happened. I leaned my head back against the glass, listening for the sound of Zeb\u2019s car starting up and driving away. I caught sight of my reflection in the pier glass in the foyer, the oddly beautiful, pale woman in the mirror, her face flooded with relief at the sound of a Datsun\u2019s engine revving.</p><p>I glared at the image. \u201cYou are a coward.\u201d</p><p>My reflection was decidedly unhelpful.</p><p>14</p><p>Any male who marries more than two mates is ostracized from the pack. Most females would consider him a jinx at that point, anyway.</p><p>\u2014Mating Rituals and Love Customs of the Were</p><p>In order to avoid thinking about Zeb and inappropriate touching, I threw myself into ferreting out more information on my future step-grandpa. I figured of the two problems, Wilbur\u2019s past was far less likely to come back and bite me on the butt.</p><p>Gabriel found me up to my elbows in cyberspace, searching through a not-quite-legal connection to the state\u2019s vital-statistics database. The library was granted access for archive purposes, and Mrs. Stubblefield hadn\u2019t bothered to change our password since I was fired. Honestly, what was she thinking?</p><p>I had access to birth certificates, marriage licenses, and death certificates, the only problem being that they were in abstract form, giving the barest essentials of names and dates.</p><p>After I gave only a cursory grunt for a greeting, Gabriel cautiously climbed onto the couch next to me and watched as my fingers flew over the keyboard.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine, thank you, dear. How are you?\u201d he said pointedly.</p><p>I made a kissing noise in his general direction but continued my search.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean to interrupt,\u201d he grumped. When I finally looked at Gabriel, I saw that he was wearing a well-cut black suit with a blue silk tie. I\u2019d never seen him in his \u201cbusiness\u201d attire before. He would have been mouthwatering, if not for the anxious lines between his brows, the nervous glint in his eyes. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStalking my future grampy via an obscenely fast wireless connection,\u201d I said, tapping away at the keys.</p><p>He blinked at the wildly scrolling screen. \u201cIs that slang or a Jane-ism?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA little of both,\u201d I said. While the search engine compiled marriage records for Goosens between 1960 and 2007, I kissed his chin and rubbed my eyes. \u201cI\u2019m looking up old Mr. Goosen in the state archives. So far, all I\u2019ve found is his birth certificate, which is normal. And his death certificate, which is, considering that he\u2019s walking around, not normal.\u201d</p><p>He stroked a hand across my shoulders. \u201cYou know, I\u2019ve never seen this aggressively intellectual side of you before. It\u2019s rather disturbing and yet somehow a little sexy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich is pretty much how we define our relationship,\u201d I said, turning back to the screen.</p><p>I heard his delicate intake of breath beside me. \u201cWas Zeb just here? His scent seems particularly strong in this room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease stop sniffing me for evidence of other people,\u201d I groaned, cutting off my contrived, indignant response. Instead, I quietly said, \u201cI had to feed from him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy are you making that face?\u201d he asked, tucking his thumb under my chin. \u201cThere\u2019s no reason you shouldn\u2019t feed from Zeb.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI sort of vowed not to feed from humans, remember?\u201d I said. \u201cI was doing great, six months clean and passive ... and then Zeb tried to kiss me, and it all just went to hell from there.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d Gabriel shook his head, laughing. \u201cFor a minute, I thought you just said that Zeb tried to kiss you.\u201d I gave him a look that was part wince but mostly cringe. \u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d I groaned. \u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on. It\u2019s like the whole world\u2019s just gone cockeyed. And while I was feeding, I had all these weird thoughts. And they were ... dark and hungry and sly. And they kept telling me to drink more, take more, turn him, keep him with me. Does that mean this is my fault? Did I accidentally put some of my subconscious thoughts in his head because I\u2019m afraid of what\u2019s going to happen to our relationship when he and Jolene get married? Is that why he tried to kiss me? Did I do this with my evil vampire temptress powers?\u201d</p><p>Gabriel leveled me with his serious, paternal gaze. \u201cJane, do you want to have sex with Zeb?\u201d</p> <p>My eyes widened to the size of dinner plates. \u201cLord, no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, this couldn\u2019t be your fault. The voice in your head? That\u2019s just a blood thought.\u201d Gabriel laughed and cupped my face between his palms. \u201cIt\u2019s the vampire brain\u2019s response to live fresh blood, a physiological attempt to keep the vampire as well fed as possible for as long as possible. We never know when our next meal will be. So the receptors in your brain that interpret pleasure all start firing at once. You get overloaded with endorphins, and you start having thoughts ... well, thoughts I\u2019d rather you didn\u2019t describe to me. But it\u2019s perfectly natural, particularly for those who rarely feed on live blood. Your brain was just overcompensating for time lost.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I don\u2019t really have dark, hungry feelings for Zeb?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn a universe that is decent and good, no.\u201d He shook his head.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d I breathed, leaning against him. \u201cI thought I was having some sort of bizarre psychic reaction to the wedding. Or maybe an aneurysm. I was hoping for aneurysm.\u201d</p> <p>Gabriel\u2019s voice tightened. \u201cThat does, however, mean that I must have a talk with Zeb about appropriate behavior for engaged men, particularly engaged men who expect to continue to spend time with you and retain the use of their limbs.\u201d</p><p>I snorted. \u201cAnd if that doesn\u2019t work, what\u2019s next? A paid chaperone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf necessary. I\u2019m sure Dick could use some extra cash,\u201d Gabriel muttered, tensing when I shot him a warning look. \u201cI am very fond of Zeb. He\u2019s a fine young man, and I enjoy spending time with him. But if he thinks he can make advances toward you because of a misguided case of cold feet, he is sorely mistaken.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m pretty sure I got that point across when I made his nose bleed,\u201d I told him.</p><p>\u201cYou hit him?\u201d he asked, grinning. \u201cThat\u2019s my girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think he even realized he was doing it. He had this odd, glazed-over look in his eyes, and he just leaned in. We were both pretty mortified once we got his nose mopped up. Is it possible his brain was just overreacting to being bitten? I mean, Andrea\u2019s reaction when I fed from her was sort of ... happy. But she didn\u2019t try to make out with me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s possible,\u201d he conceded. When he saw the relief flood my face, he groaned. \u201cThis is one of those issues you\u2019re going to insist on handling yourself, isn\u2019t it?\u201d I nodded. \u201cIf he does it again\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf he does it again, you have my permission to break his legs and arms and make him believe he\u2019s a rodeo clown from Walla Walla,\u201d I promised. \u201cWe can make him call himself Slappy the Wonder Clown.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. On to less disturbing subjects; can I see what you\u2019ve found so far?\u201d</p><p>I turned my laptop to show Gabriel the sad little \u201cNo records found\u201d screen. \u201cI can\u2019t find him registered in the state\u2019s database of the undead. According to this, he died almost fifteen years ago, so why wouldn\u2019t he register? He\u2019s an old vampire, hardly threatening. What\u2019s he afraid of?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe he\u2019s not a vampire,\u201d Gabriel said.</p><p>\u201cBut what else could he be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI honestly don\u2019t know,\u201d he admitted.</p><p>\u201cWell, you\u2019re no help,\u201d I grumbled. \u201cI\u2019ve tried reading his thoughts, but he must be one of those people I can\u2019t get through to. Because I got nothing.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou can\u2019t just go around thumbing through people\u2019s brains when it suits you, Jane.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, you\u2019ve wiped my parents\u2019 memories like Windex, and now suddenly there\u2019s a boundary?\u201d</p><p>Gabriel gently pried the laptop out of my hands and put it on the coffee table. \u201cI can only guess that Wilbur is a lonely being, either natural or supernatural, and he genuinely enjoys your grandmother\u2019s company.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, that can\u2019t be it,\u201d I muttered, grabbing the laptop and clicking into another search engine. I typed in Wilbur\u2019s name. \u201cDoes this seem like a lot of results in the wedding license section?\u201d</p><p>I scanned the folder. The name Wilbur, Will, Bernie, or Gus Goosen showed up six times over the last fifteen years. \u201cEach wife died within a year of their marriage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you tell what they died of?\u201d he asked, intrigued.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to do something slightly illegal, so you might want to turn your head,\u201d I told him. Gabriel, unfazed, merely smirked. I gave an exaggerated sigh. \u201cYou have been warned.\u201d</p><p>I clicked on an online database that was supposed to be limited to licensed medical examiners. It said so right at the top of the screen, in big red letters. I entered a valid user name and password, prompting Gabriel\u2019s jaw to drop. I explained, \u201cJolene has a cousin working in the county coroner\u2019s office. He can be bought with summer sausage.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel sighed. \u201cWell, of course she does.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOK, first up, first wife, Dulcie, had a stroke in 1991, age seventy, nothing suspicious,\u201d I said, poring over the digitized paperwork. \u201cHere\u2019s a death certificate for Wilbur, dated 1993. Cause of death listed as natural.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNatural what?\u201d Gabriel asked.</p><p>I clicked and scanned. \u201cJust \u2018natural.\u2019 There was no autopsy. The coroner wrote that the death was unremarkable and likely connected to the deceased\u2019s chronic heart condition.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel scrunched his nose. \u201cSo, the cause of death was \u2018he was old\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAccording to this, his body was released to Aaronson\u2019s Funeral Home a day later. Next of kin listed as Jerry Goosen, Wilbur\u2019s son, a resident of Ashton, Oklahoma. I can only hope that Jerry chose the cheapest funeral home in the state because he picked the first one he saw in the yellow pages. Is it normal for vampires to get a death certificate?\u201d</p><p>Gabriel, fully vested in my little Nancy Drew investigation now, nodded. \u201cIt can happen if a just-turned fledgling is found by humans before he or she can rise. Since autopsies and embalming involve removing organs and most of the blood from the body, vampires don\u2019t tend to fare well. They turn out wrong somehow, weaker, diluted. When was his next marriage certificate dated?\u201d</p><p>I chewed my lip, switching back to the vital-statistics database. \u201cIn 1994, a Bernie Goosen married Ms. Ethel Brown. She died a year later as the result of anaphylactic shock from multiple bee stings. She\u2019d been gardening. Coroner ruled it accidental. Then in 1996, a Will Goosen to Mrs. DeeDee Wilkins-Reed. Her death certificate is dated six months later. Cause of death: blunt trauma to the head. A leg of the shower stool she was sitting on collapsed, and she was thrown to the floor, hitting her head on the tile. Coroner ruled it accidental. In 1998, Gus Goosen married Mrs. Judy Wooten. She choked on a piece of peanut brittle. Coroner ruled it, all together now\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAccidental.\u201d</p><p>I sifted through the online files. \u201cI\u2019ll grant you that the first one was natural, and maybe even the second one was an accident, but after that, I think Wilbur figured out how much fun marriage for profit could be. What are the odds that Wilbur isn\u2019t bumping his wives off Bluebeard style?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt could just be a coincidence, you know.\u201d I stared at him. He jerked his shoulders. \u201cIt\u2019s not likely, but it could be a coincidence.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think my grandma may have finally met her match,\u201d I marveled.</p><p>\u201cYou are very good at this,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cStay away from my tax records.\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo late,\u201d I told him absently. He jumped, but that was probably because I suddenly started waving my hands. \u201cWait, wait, wait.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that an \u2018I\u2019m thinking\u2019 gesture or an \u2018I have a headache\u2019 gesture?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cThinking. Weakened old vampire. Diluted. I read something like this.\u201d</p><p>I ran upstairs and snatched my copy of Spectrum of Vampirism off my nightstand. As I sprinted down the steps, I called out, \u201cNormally, it doesn\u2019t take me this long to finish a book. This thing reads like stereo assembly instructions, in Korean. But listen to this:</p><p>\u201c \u2018Of the many shades of vampirism, the most weakened and diluted state is that of so-called ghouls, vampires who have been embalmed. Because some vampire fledglings are believed to have been murdered or attacked by animals, they are embalmed and treated for burial. Despite the blood being drained, the vampire will survive the process if the heart and brain are left intact, which sometimes happens with lazy or inept embalmers.</p><p>\u201c \u2018Reports of this phenomenon can be found as early as ancient Egypt. The nightmare of cursed mummies rising from their sarcophagi was born of priests skipping steps in the mummification process on newborn vampires. Embalmed vampires rise on the third day, deprived of the vampiric blood that turned them. They are able to withstand serious injuries, though they heal more slowly than full-fledged vampires. They also lack the strength and agility of vampires. They can withstand weak sunlight and require only small amounts of blood to survive.\u2019 \u201c</p><p>I looked at him expectantly. He shrugged.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a ghoul. I knew it!\u201d I yelled.</p><p>Gabriel laughed. \u201cNo, you didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>I grunted in frustration. \u201cI know. What should I worry about first? Him hurting her as a human or biting her and trying to turn her? Because I do not want to think about an eternity with Grandma Ruthie in it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, ghouls aren\u2019t that dangerous,\u201d Gabriel said. \u201cThey\u2019re only interested in dead blood. It\u2019s the only thing they can digest. So they don\u2019t go around biting people. And they can\u2019t turn a human into a vampire. They can only create other ghouls. The question is, what do you do with this information?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I mean, I could warn her,\u201d I said. \u201cOr I could let it play out for my own personal amusement.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel tsked and lifted my chin. \u201cThe Jane I know and love wouldn\u2019t let her grandmother suffer for her own personal amusement.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, baby doll.\u201d I snickered and kissed the tip of his nose. \u201cI don\u2019t think you know me as well as you think you do. So, what are we up to this evening? You want to go see another movie? Or we could just hang out here.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel\u2019s face tensed, all of the breezy charm of the last few minutes melted away. \u201cActually, I can\u2019t stay. I should have mentioned I was just dropping by on my way to the airport. There\u2019s a quarterly staff meeting at my hotel that I can\u2019t afford to miss again. I like to put in an appearance every couple of months; it tends to keep the humans honest. I\u2019m flying out to Atlanta tonight. It\u2019s just for a few days. I\u2019m sorry I forgot to mention it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could come with you,\u201d I offered. \u201cI love Atlanta. Well, I\u2019ve never been there, but I\u2019m a big fan. You know, Gone with the Wind, the Braves, the Turner Broadcasting System.\u201d</p><p>I was really grasping with that last one.</p><p>\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be any fun for you, Jane. I\u2019ll be in meetings all night. I\u2019d hate for you to wander around alone. Who knows what sort of trouble you could get into?\u201d He meant for it to be a joke, but there was a brittle, too-bright quality to his voice.</p><p>\u201cI really don\u2019t mind,\u201d I said, acting oblivious to his hasty refusal. \u201cI\u2019d like to see the hotel. I feel I only know the Hollow version of Gabriel. I\u2019d like to see what you\u2019re doing when you\u2019re out in the world.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel seemed to grasp the double meaning. We stared at each other for a long time. I was practically daring him to make another lame excuse, another lie. I was done letting him off the hook. He could keep making up stupid stories if he wanted to, but I wasn\u2019t going to make it easy for him. Gabriel\u2019s mouth set in a thin, cool smile.</p><p>\u201cNot this time, Jane,\u201d he said, standing abruptly and kissing me on the temple. \u201cI\u2019ll see you when I get home.\u201d</p><p>He was halfway to the door when I finally worked up the nerve to say, \u201cYou know, eventually, you\u2019re going to run out of excuses. You\u2019re going to have to tell me the truth.\u201d</p><p>His smile was quick, effortless, but it didn\u2019t reach his eyes. \u201cIs that another Jane-ism? Your version of \u2018Have a nice trip\u2019?\u201d</p><p>I glared at him, refusing to be charmed.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see you soon,\u201d he said quietly, and walked out.</p><p>The click of the door closing behind him seemed to echo in my ears, a harsh, metallic scraping that bounced off the sudden emptiness of the house. Alone again, I continued to tap at the computer keys, afraid of what I might do without something to occupy my shaking hands.</p><p>15</p><p>Offspring are considered the purpose of marriage, so newlywed weres should expect heavy pressure for babies early on. Many couples receive layette sets as wedding gifts. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u2014Mating Rituals and Love Customs of the Were</p><p>When I heard the baby crying on my front porch, I thought I was having a nightmare. Still in bed, I stuck a finger in my ear and wiggled it, hoping to pop loose whatever might be causing that godawful noise. But it persisted. I sat up. There was weak sunlight peeking around the edges of my blackout curtains. Judging by the why why why? reaction radiating from my internal clock, I guessed it was around five P.M.</p><p>I\u2019d managed to race into bed before dawn the morning before. About an hour after Gabriel left my house, I Googled directions to his hotel and decided that I was going to drive down there to see what he was up to myself. I\u2019d crossed into Tennessee by the time I realized that I was behaving like a crazy person. I pulled Big Bertha off onto the shoulder just outside Union City and leaned my head against the steering wheel. What was I doing? What was my plan? Was I going to follow Gabriel around with a pair of binoculars and spy on him? Break into his hotel room and tell him I just couldn\u2019t resist surprising him? Gabriel had told me he didn\u2019t want me there. At best, I would find nothing was amiss and look like an annoying, clingy psycho who didn\u2019t respect boundaries. At worst, I would go to Atlanta and find him shacked up with some other woman or find that he wasn\u2019t in Atlanta at all. And what could I do then? I would have a meltdown in the middle of a strange city with no connections, no friends, nothing. I would probably wander the streets in a daze until the sun came up and I was a little pile of Jane ashes on the sidewalk.</p> <p>This was definitely a Marianne move, and not in the good way.</p><p>I drove back to the Hollow and pulled into the driveway just as the sun was rising over the roof of River Oaks. I dashed into the house and pulled the covers over my head, falling into a fitful sleep. Nightmares about crying babies fit right into that.</p><p>The baby\u2019s squalling was soon joined by pounding on my front door. I stumbled down the stairs, calling for Aunt Jettie in a voice that couldn\u2019t be heard by my visitor. No response. My dead aunt picked a fine time to become a social butterfly.</p><p>Careful to stay in the cool, dark recess of the foyer, I opened the door to find Mama Ginger standing on my front porch, holding a squirming bundle of pink blankets.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2014what the\u2014this had better be a hallucination,\u201d I stammered.</p> <p>\u201cJane!\u201d Mama Ginger squealed. \u201cI\u2019m so glad you\u2019re home! This is Neveah. We call her Nevie for short.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeveah?\u201d I repeated as she bustled into the house, trailing blankies and diaper bags.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s \u2018heaven\u2019 spelled backwards, isn\u2019t that clever?\u201d Mama Ginger trilled, putting the baby into some sort of collapsible bouncy thing she pulled out of her bag.</p><p>\u201cWay to sentence a kid to a lifetime spent popping out of cakes,\u201d I muttered. I felt an immediate flash of guilt when the baby opened her heavily lashed blue eyes and focused on my face. I patted her tuft of dark hair gently. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean that.\u201d</p><p>OK, I totally meant that.</p><p>Mama Ginger popped a pacifier into the baby\u2019s mouth, which temporarily stopped the ear-splitting wails. \u201cI was supposed to babysit little Nevie tonight, but poor Floyd is having an emergency down at the Goose Lodge and needs my help.\u201d</p> <p>Floyd frequently had emergencies down at the Goose Lodge, most of them involving injuries sustained while fistfighting the pinball machine.</p><p>\u201cSo I figured you wouldn\u2019t mind watching her while I just popped over to the emergency room,\u201d she said, hoisting her purse onto her shoulder.</p><p>\u201cWait, what? No!\u201d I cried. Mama Ginger was startled as I cut her off at the door, trying to comprehend how I\u2019d managed to beat her there. \u201cI don\u2019t know how to take care of a baby!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, don\u2019t be silly, she\u2019s only four months old. What\u2019s to know? Besides, you used to babysit all the time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, small children and preteens,\u201d I insisted as Nevie bubbled a yellowish goo from her nose. \u201cPeople who were potty-trained and didn\u2019t ooze weird substances.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be fine,\u201d Mama Ginger insisted, and dashed out the door into the setting sunlight, where I could not follow.</p><p>\u201cGah! Persuasian voice. Why can\u2019t I ever remember to do that damn persuasion voice?\u201d I cried, prompting a mewling cry from Neveah. \u201cOK, now,\u201d I said, scooping the baby awkwardly out of the bouncie and balancing her on my arm. \u201cLet\u2019s be reasonable. I don\u2019t know you, and you don\u2019t know me. We don\u2019t have to start the evening off by annoying each other.\u201d</p><p>The baby, who didn\u2019t know the meaning of the word \u201creasonable,\u201d wailed even louder.</p> <p>\u201cMind if I cry, too?\u201d I asked as the weight of the situation settled on my shoulder. I didn\u2019t even know who her parents were. Of course, I wasn\u2019t sure I wanted to know someone who would name their daughter Neveah. But for all I knew, Mama Ginger was trying to set me up on a kidnapping charge. My house wasn\u2019t baby-proofed. I didn\u2019t have any emergency contact numbers or a first-aid kit. I could only pray there was formula and diapers in that bag, because otherwise, this kid might have to make do with Diet Coke and paper towels.</p><p>I rocked the baby gently, making a swishing noise until she quieted. She stared at me under heavy, half-closed lids, her little rosebud mouth slack. Of course, this was just a precursor to her projectile vomiting on me.</p><p>I shrieked, swiping at the milky ick dripping from my chin. This startled Nevie, who commenced with more crying. I joined in with her again as I tried to remove the chin goo with the wipes I found in her diaper bag.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d I asked desperately. \u201cAre you sleepy? Grumpy? Just name a dwarf, and I\u2019ll do what I can. Are you hungry? I can fix hungry.\u201d</p><p>I carried the baby and the bag into the kitchen, where I fished out a bottle with a small amount of white powder. I sincerely hoped it was formula and not part of some elaborate drug-smuggling operation. The problem was, I didn\u2019t know how much water to add to the mix and ended up reenacting Goldilocks and the Three Bears. The first bottle was too thin. The next bottle was so thick Nevie couldn\u2019t get anything out. I finally aimed for middle ground and shook it into something she could tolerate.</p><p>The act of drinking apparently filled the baby with an inhuman amount of gas, because she belched like a long-haul trucker. The noise was enough to make her soil herself and then spit up again. This upset milady\u2019s delicate sensibilities, and she started screaming full-blast. At a loss about where I would even start addressing these issues, I started crying, too.</p><p>Seeing a grown woman cry seemed to have a soothing effect on the baby. She calmed down enough to let me pull off her little pink outfit and open her diaper. I don\u2019t want to go into details, but I have a hard time believing that much of such a disgusting material could come out of someone so small. I changed Nevie into a clean \u201cLittle Diva\u201d onesie and laid her in the bouncie seat long enough to take the diaper out back and bury it.</p><p>When I came back into the house, she was dozing. I crept quietly up the first stair so I could get to a non-vomit-y shirt. The baby sensed this and let out a hoarse cry. I rushed back to her, searching the couch cushions for her pacifier. This calmed her down until I tried for the stairs again. In fact, every time I tried to get near clean clothes or left the ten-foot baby perimeter, Neveah made her dissatisfaction known. And they say babies aren\u2019t aware of their surroundings.</p><p>This sleeping/crying/holding-my-clean-shirt-hostage cycle continued for an hour or so. Then a tentative knock sounded at the front door.</p><p>\u201cThank God you\u2019re back,\u201d I said as I opened it, carefully balancing the baby on my hip. \u201cDon\u2019t you ever do this again, Mama Ginger, do you under\u2014Adam?\u201d</p><p>Adam was standing on my porch, looking tousled and tanned in a blue pullover that brought out the violet undertones in his eyes. He was carrying two carry-out cups of coffee.</p><p>\u201cHey, Jane. I thought that since we haven\u2019t been able to get together for coffee, I would bring coffee to you.\u201d He smiled broadly, and I felt warm. It was like standing in sunlight, only without the spontaneous combustion. He took one look at my desperate, frazzled state and put the coffee down on the porch. \u201cWho have you got there?\u201d he asked in a typical male \u201cjabbering at babies\u201d tone.</p><p>\u201cThis is Nevie. Ginger Lavelle dropped her off a while ago, and I thought it was her at the door, ready to pick her up. She\u2019s got to come back for her soon, right?\u201d I babbled as I checked the clock. Mama Ginger had left four hours ago. Where could she be? What if Mama Ginger left her until morning, when I was basically inanimate and unable to hear the cries of a hungry, uncomfortable baby?</p><p>\u201cOh, my Lord, what if she doesn\u2019t come back?\u201d I cried. \u201cI can\u2019t take care of a baby! I\u2019m terrible at this. She\u2019s been crying off and on for hours, and no matter what I do, she won\u2019t let me put her down long enough to get a clean shirt, and I don\u2019t know what to do!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, it\u2019s OK, Jane,\u201d he said in a calm, soothing tone, which I assumed was as much for my benefit as the baby\u2019s. He took her from me, and she gurgled and cooed at him as she settled into his arms, obviously preferring him over me after just a few moments. The little traitor. \u201cWhy don\u2019t do you go upstairs and clean up? I\u2019ll look after her for a few minutes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d I asked, though I already had one foot on the bottom stair. He nodded, and without further hesitation, I raced up the stairs to de-goo myself.</p><p>Within ten minutes, Adam had Nevie fed, burped, cleaned up, and asleep on his shoulder. Wearing fresh clothes and carrying my soiled shirt at arm\u2019s length, I found him bouncing her gently in his arms, with her little head tucked under his chin. The low lights danced over the dark gold of his hair as he swayed Nevie back and forth. The sight of Adam with a baby in his arms made my silent heart do a little flip. In my best daydreams, that was what I imagined it would be like to be married and have a family\u2014a good, steady man standing in my house with a sleeping child cradled quietly against him. This was the price I had paid for dodging death. Though the previous hours had taught me that I certainly wasn\u2019t ready for a baby, and likely never would be, I couldn\u2019t help but feel a tiny pang of regret for an opportunity lost.</p><p>Seeing me standing there, staring at him, Adam winked and pressed a finger to his lips. He carefully placed Nevie in her little bouncie seat and went outside to retrieve his carry-out coffee.</p><p>\u201cHow did you do that?\u201d I whispered as we tiptoed into the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cPractice,\u201d he said, setting the coffee cup in front of me on the breakfast bar. He slid onto the stool next to me as if this were a long-held routine.</p><p>\u201cI thought you were an only child.\u201d</p><p>Adam looked sheepish. \u201cWell, taking care of a baby isn\u2019t that different from taking care of a puppy or a calf. They have the same basic needs and give the same sort of cues for hunger, discomfort, being sleepy. And they make almost the same amount of mess. So I\u2019ve picked up a lot of fathering experience down at the clinic.\u201d</p><p>I snorted.</p><p>\u201cThat came out wrong,\u201d he acknowledged, chuckling. He took a sip of his coffee and smiled that warm, crooked smile.</p><p>I waited for my nerves to kick in, to start spewing nonsense words and fidgeting. But it seemed that all of the embarrassment and shyness I\u2019d felt before in Adam\u2019s presence had melted away.</p><p>Sitting there with Adam was ... quiet, restful. There was no dire emergency looming on the horizon. I didn\u2019t have to monitor every expression, every word, carefully to keep from upsetting him. And I didn\u2019t feel tempted to look inside his head, because his feelings were pinned right on his sleeve.</p><p>\u201cIt was nice of you to drop by with this ... now lukewarm coffee.\u201d I chuckled while I sipped.</p><p>His dimples flashed. \u201cWell, I do what I can. Other than panic attacks stemming from spit-up, how have you been?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s ... complicated.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVampire stuff?\u201d he asked.</p><p>I considered. Of all of the things I was dealing with\u2014a distant and secretive boyfriend, my potentially murderous step-grandpa, the possible mental breakdown of my best friend, his mother\u2019s attempted jumpstarting of my defunct biological clock\u2014none of it had much to do with me being a vampire. \u201cNot really.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I could see how being a vampire would be, you know, complicated. I mean, where do you get your blood?\u201d he asked. \u201cAnd what time do you wake up every night? Is it difficult for you to be around people without wanting to feed on them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you writing some sort of book report?\u201d I asked, making him flash that mile-wide grin.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just curious,\u201d he said. \u201cYou never know whether what you read in the news about vampires is true. But it seems you have to make so many adjustments, just to function.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that big of a deal,\u201d I told him. \u201cOK, yeah, it is, but it\u2019s worth it, especially if it means I can stay here, in my home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you could do anything, go anywhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is where I want to be.\u201d</p><p>Nonplussed, Adam asked, \u201cHow did this start? How were you turned?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a story I tell most people,\u201d I said.</p><p>Adam seemed offended that I considered him \u201cmost people.\u201d \u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf there was a very special episode of I Love Lucy, where Lucy was turned into a vampire, she\u2019d probably use my story. Let\u2019s just say I didn\u2019t have any choice. It was either death or this. I\u2019m fortunate that my sire happened to be there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis sire, is that the guy you\u2019re seeing?\u201d he asked.</p><p>I nodded. It was so weird to discuss this with him, the touch of jealousy tainting his otherwise clear tenor. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIs it serious?\u201d he asked.</p><p>I stared down at my coffee cup, ashamed that I was unable to answer. I didn\u2019t know where I stood with Gabriel right now. Was it unfair that I didn\u2019t want to give Adam the impression that I was totally unavailable? Was I just using his unabashed interest as a convenient excuse to look for a way out of an uncomfortable, uncertain situation with my sire? Why did I feel so guilty for thinking that way when Gabriel\u2019s actions were so suspicious?</p><p>Why couldn\u2019t I be a Marianne instead of an Elinor? Just live in the moment and take what I wanted from life? Why did I have to think everything through? Elinor is a pushover. She lets everyone else act any way they please, leaving her to clean up their messes without complaint. Marianne may be misguided and silly, but at least she has some fun every once in a while.</p> <p>Adam took advantage of my silence. \u201cIf you can\u2019t answer, that probably means something.\u201d</p><p>I nodded, still unable to add anything to the exchange.</p><p>\u201cWell, if something changes or you decide that you\u2019re ... I just want you to know that if you ever need someone to talk to, I\u2019d like that person to be me. Damn it, that made no sense. I\u2019m sorry, you just make me a little nervous,\u201d he admitted. His blush brought a flood of deep, healthy pink to his cheeks.</p><p>\u201cI make you nervous?\u201d I was strangely pleased by that. After all, he\u2019d made me stutter and drool for most of my adolescence. Turnabout was fair play.</p><p>The blush that had subsided only a few seconds before rushed back into his cheeks. \u201cWell, yeah. I like spending time with you. I\u2019m grateful that I\u2019m getting to know you again. I don\u2019t want to screw this up.\u201d</p> <p>I was able to tamp down my instinct to squeal. I had some cool, flirty speech prepared about Adam playing his cards right, but he suddenly stood up, took my face in his hands, and brushed a quick kiss across my cheek, leaving a tingling path where his lips had touched my skin. He was so warm, vital, full of life. He smelled like sundried cotton and peppermint, though I imagined that last part was probably just doggie shampoo. The pattern of his hands seemed burned into my cheeks, branding me. How could I have forgotten how warm human men were? It was like sliding into a bone-softening hot bath at the end of a long, blustery day, comforting and sweet. He pulled away from me and smiled. I sat stunned, watching him cross to the kitchen door.</p><p>\u201cJust think about what I said, Jane,\u201d he said as he stepped outside. \u201cGive me a call sometime, even if it\u2019s just to talk. I want to see you again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will,\u201d I promised before I had a chance to filter my response. I seemed to be channeling the teenage Jane, who had no impulse control or loyalty to Gabriel.</p><p>Adam took care to close the door quietly, but somehow that tiny snick woke Nevie up and had her squalling.</p><p>I sighed and thumped my head against the counter.</p><p>By the time Mama Ginger saw fit to return, I\u2019d changed six more diapers and spent an hour cleaning substances I\u2019d rather not describe out of my carpet. There were suspiciously permanent-looking stains on my new couch. I was not a happy camper.</p> <p>\u201cAre you crazy?\u201d I demanded as Mama Ginger opened my door. \u201cWhat is wrong with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d she asked, peering into the bouncie, where Neveah dozed peacefully. \u201cShe\u2019s fine. I knew she would be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if she\u2019d gotten sick?\u201d I hissed. \u201cWhat if something went wrong? I didn\u2019t know how to get in touch with you. I am covered in baby spit-up. My house smells like compost!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut honey, doesn\u2019t she make you want one of your own?\u201d Mama Ginger held up the baby like a prize cut of meat on display.</p><p>\u201cIf anything, you\u2019ve confirmed for me that I don\u2019t need to have children,\u201d I said, and from the bottom of my heart, I knew it was true.</p><p>\u201cBut Janie, I only did this to show you that you need to stop playing around. Stop with this silly singles lifestyle. A different man every night. Working in some adult bookstore. You need to settle down. Stop pretending you\u2019re happy, and just tell Zeb how you feel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not pretending,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cWell, I think I need to have a talk with this Gabriel character and tell him what he\u2019s doing. He has to know he\u2019s standing in your way,\u201d Mama Ginger insisted. \u201cHe has to know he\u2019s keeping you from your one true love. If it wasn\u2019t for this boy, this Gabriel, you and Zeb would be free to be together.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut Zeb is in love with Jolene.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to hear that, Jane. I know what\u2019s best!\u201d she cried, gathering the baby\u2019s stuff and making a dash for the front steps. \u201cYou\u2019ll see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMama Ginger, stop,\u201d I said in the most powerful persuasion voice I could muster. \u201cStop it right now. You will stop this campaign against Jolene, and you will accept her into the family. You will make her feel welcome. You will never again mention the idea of Zeb and me as anything but friends.\u201d</p><p>Mama Ginger swiped at her ear as if there were annoying insects buzzing there. I guess vampire powers were nothing against the determination of an angry mother-in-law-to-be.</p><p>\u201cAnd I don\u2019t work at an adult bookstore,\u201d I shouted out the door as she bustled Nevie off the porch. \u201cI work at an occult bookstore. There just happens to be an adult video store next door.\u201d</p><p>I watched as Mama Ginger\u2019s taillights disappeared into the darkness.</p><p>\u201cThis is not good.\u201d</p><p>16</p><p>Werewolves express many emotions through physical contact\u2014joy, rage, a need for comfort. Prepare to be hugged, snuffled, snuggled, or possibly licked.</p><p>\u2014Mating Rituals and Love Customs of the Were</p><p>\u201cHello?\u201d I called, propping a delivery box against the counter long enough to get the door shut. It had been locked, which was unusual. And Mr. Wainwright never left deliveries out front. There was too much crime in the neighborhood.</p><p>\u201cMr. Wainwright?\u201d I called. Technically, it was my night off. I wasn\u2019t supposed to come by the shop, but Gabriel had called me from the Nashville airport to let me know that he\u2019d be returning to town that night and wanted to talk. I didn\u2019t want to be home waiting for him. Despite my protests to the contrary, I didn\u2019t want to have whatever conversation Gabriel had planned. As unhappy as I was with his evasiveness, I knew the truth would hurt worse. So I was using work as a defensive shield.</p><p>The shop was empty, eerily so. I cast my senses out and found nothing; no vampire presence, no humans.</p><p>Around the corner of the counter, I could see a pair of brown loafers poking out from a pile of seventeenth-century manuscripts on vampire feeding patterns.</p><p>\u201cI thought we agreed that you wouldn\u2019t try to move anything by yourself,\u201d I said to the feet as I set the box down.</p><p>The silence seemed to buzz in my ears, slowing my ability to hear, to respond.</p><p>\u201cMr. Wainwright?\u201d My boss lay prostrate on the floor, the books covering him like a crazy quilt. His eyes were closed, his face serene, as if he\u2019d just lain down for a nap on the floor.</p><p>\u201cNonononononono,\u201d I murmured, my numbed fingers searching for a pulse under his cold parchment skin. \u201cPlease, no.\u201d</p><p>I wailed, my hot tears blinding me. \u201cMr. Wainwright! Please wake up! Please!\u201d</p><p>Using what little I could remember from first-aid class in Girl Scouts, I shoved several books away and tilted Mr. Wainwright\u2019s head back. I wiped my running nose and breathed through the sobs. I blew into his mouth. I pushed down on his sternum with both hands and shrieked when I heard something snap. I\u2019d broken something, probably one of his ribs. I continued to pump his chest, praying to bring something back.</p><p>\u201cPlease!\u201d I screamed again, burying my face in his shirt.</p><p>\u201cJane, dear, it\u2019s time to stop that. As much as I appreciate it, it\u2019s too late.\u201d</p><p>I looked up and locked eyes with the former Mr. Wainwright. He was wearing the same gray cardigan and brown corduroy ensemble as the body lying on the floor, only more transparent. He smiled gently.</p><p>\u201cMr. Wainwright?\u201d I whimpered. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo a young woman of your intelligence, Jane, I would hope it would be obvious.\u201d I shook my head, still sniffling. \u201cI\u2019m a ghost, Jane, have been for, oh, six or seven hours now.\u201d</p><p>He held up his hand, examining the way the light filtered through it. \u201cLook at that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened to you?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cWell, you were right about my not moving boxes by myself. I knew there was something wrong the moment I picked it up. I had all of the classic signs\u2014shooting pains in the left arm, crushing sensation in the chest, shortness of breath. I just keeled over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry. I should have been here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d he said. \u201cDon\u2019t blame yourself. I was an old man, and I lived a good, long life. And you made me very happy during my last months. You\u2019ve become very dear to me, Jane. I hope you know that. I was never meant to have children. But I like to think that if I had a daughter, or a granddaughter, she would be like you. Good Lord, is that really what my hair looks like?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFocus, please, Mr. Wainwright. Why are you still here? Do you have unfinished business or something?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cNo, no, I\u2019m just not ready to cross over. There\u2019s too much happening in the world right now. And my friendship with you, it\u2019s so exciting. I want to see what happens next.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut don\u2019t you want to see what\u2019s, you know, on the other side?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not afraid of crossing over,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m just not ready to go. As soon as I am, I will. As a wise man once said, \u2018To the highly organized mind, death is just another adventure.\u2019 \u201c</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s from Harry Potter,\u201d I said. \u201cDumbledore said it in the first book.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrust you to know.\u201d He smiled. \u201cEverything\u2019s going to be fine, Jane. Don\u2019t you worry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut what\u2019s going to happen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho knows?\u201d He shrugged, grinning wildly. \u201cThat\u2019s the best part.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut what about\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cJane, I think you\u2019d better call nine-one-one, dear, to pick up my body,\u201d he suggested.</p><p>I nodded. \u201cI\u2019m going to miss you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot for a while yet,\u201d he promised.</p><p>I thought about calling Dick, but I knew the mix of Dick and the authorities\u2014human or otherwise\u2014was not a good thing. Even though Mr. Wainwright\u2019s death was natural, the 911 dispatcher apparently went to church with my mama and notified the responding paramedics that I was a vampire. And I guess they asked for a police escort. Also, when vampires cry, the tiniest bit of blood streaks through in their tears, so when the police arrived, my face was covered in red stains. Needless to say, questioning took a while.</p><p>\u201cHow long have you worked here, Miss Jameson?\u201d Sergeant Rusty Bardwell asked as he scribbled in his little notebook. A tall, dark-haired fellow with a no nonsense set to his jaw, Rusty did not trust me. In fact, he kept a free hand on his gun for most of his visit. Pointing out that using it on me would be useless didn\u2019t seem wise.</p><p>\u201cRusty, we\u2019ve known each other since third grade. You threw up on me on the field trip to Mammoth Cave. Just call me Jane,\u201d I said irritably as I sniffled into a tissue.</p><p>Rusty\u2019s level gaze didn\u2019t waver. \u201cHow long have you worked here, Miss Jameson?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout six months,\u201d I said, my voice flat and annoyed.</p><p>\u201cAnd how long have you known the deceased?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout six months,\u201d I said.</p><p>Mr. Wainwright watched as the paramedics loaded his mortal coil into a body bag, then waved cheerfully as he was packed into the ambulance. I shook my head at him.</p><p>\u201cAnd you were recently promoted to manager.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I frowned.</p><p>\u201cThe deceased left a note on his desk,\u201d Sergeant Rusty insisted, digging into an evidence envelope. \u201cNote to Self: Have \u2018Jane Jameson, Manager\u2019 plaque engraved for Jane.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAw, Mr. Wainwright.\u201d</p><p>Mr. Wainwright ducked his head. \u201cYou deserve it, Jane. You\u2019re going to be running the store now, anyway.\u201d</p><p>Annoyed at my lack of attention, Rusty cleared his throat. \u201cAnd you found the body?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. I told the dispatcher that when I called nine-one-one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you performed CPR?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did, but I think he\u2019d been gone for a while at that point.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought vampires couldn\u2019t breathe,\u201d he said, narrowing his eyes at me.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have to, but it doesn\u2019t mean I can\u2019t,\u201d I told him. \u201cDo I need to call a council representative? I\u2019m allowed to under the Undead Civil Rights Act of 2002.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll let you know,\u201d Rusty said. \u201cFor right now, let\u2019s just say that you\u2019ll probably be hearing from us again.\u201d</p><p>Rusty cleared out of the shop as if his polyester pants were on fire. The ambulance crew drove away with the body\u2014I couldn\u2019t think of it as Mr. Wainwright. I was alone. And it was suddenly so quiet. Numb, I sank into a chair behind the counter and stared at a ledger next to the register. I could make out Mr. Wainwright\u2019s chicken scratch, a reminder for me to reorder a book called Life on Loch Ness. I ran my fingers over his indented scrawl, leaned my head against the counter, and cried.</p><p>I\u2019m not sure how long I sat there. The next thing I remembered was Gabriel striding through the shop door, calling for me. I couldn\u2019t seem to look up, to put together the words to respond. The smallest movement took too much effort. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve been calling you all evening,\u201d he said, coming behind the counter to check me over for obvious contusions and stab wounds. \u201cNormally, there\u2019s a reason for your ignoring me. What\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMr. Wainwright\u2019s dead,\u201d I said, tongue slow and heavy. I held myself together for a total of two seconds before bursting into hysterical tears again. Gabriel wrapped his long arms around me, and I suddenly didn\u2019t care where he\u2019d been or what he\u2019d done. The important thing was that he was there, at that moment, when I needed him.</p><p>\u201cWas it one of us?\u201d he asked.</p> <p>\u201cOh, no, completely natural. It was a heart attack,\u201d I said, my eyes welling up again. \u201cHe was an old man. He said he lived a good life ...\u201d</p><p>Gabriel pressed me to his chest and let me sob there, until the front of his shirt was soaked. \u201cBetter?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I said, wiping at my nose. \u201cI must look a mess, which is really the least of my concerns right now. I\u2019m not one of those women who are beautiful when they cry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you\u2019re not,\u201d Gabriel agreed.</p><p>\u201cSo rude.\u201d I smacked him.</p> <p>\u201cSee, you feel better now that you\u2019ve hit something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know why I\u2019m crying so much.\u201d I sniffled. \u201cIt\u2019s not as if I lost him. I mean, he\u2019s happy as a clam, staring through his hands. He\u2019s thrilled that he\u2019s dead. Why do I feel this way?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I suggest a theory, will you get angry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you\u2019ve pretty much guaranteed that I will now.\u201d I blew my nose.</p><p>\u201cSo much about your life has been unstable. You lost your aunt Jettie, your job, your life as you knew it. Mr. Wainwright and his shop became a touchstone of normalcy. It was somewhere you could go and know what to expect when you walked through the door. Now you can\u2019t hold on to even the smallest shred of your former life or the shaky sense of security you\u2019ve developed.\u201d</p><p>I stared at him. Having someone inside your head is offputting.</p> <p>\u201cNo, that\u2019s not it,\u201d I said. \u201cNot it at all. I hereby revoke your license to play armchair psychologist.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat can I do to make you feel better?\u201d he asked. I shrugged. \u201cHappy Naked Fun Time?\u201d</p><p>I laughed, a rusty sound that made my throat hurt. \u201cYou know, sometimes I forget that at the heart of things, you\u2019re still a guy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, let me remind you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe need to call Dick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think we should leave Dick out of this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause\u2014oh, God, it hardly matters now. Dick is Mr. Wainwright\u2019s great-grandfather.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel sank onto the couch. \u201cDick had children?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cA son, that we know of. His name was Albert. He was Mr. Wainwright\u2019s grandfather.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDick had a child?\u201d</p><p>I stared at him. \u201cDid I break your brain?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just, I gave up the idea of being able to have children long ago, for obvious reasons. I mourned, but I made my peace with it. I\u2019d never even considered that Dick could ... though it makes sense that he did. He always sort of played fast and loose with his, er, companions. How long have you known?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA month or so. I\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t tell you. Dick asked me not to say anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJane?\u201d Dick came rushing through the door with Zeb on his heels. He skidded to a halt as he saw my tear tracked face, then whirled on Gabriel. \u201cWhy is she crying? If you made her cry, I\u2019m going to kick your\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy are you here?\u201d Gabriel asked Dick.</p><p>\u201cThe clerk at the video store next door saw an ambulance over here and called me,\u201d Dick said.</p><p>Zeb made a face. \u201cThe porn-store guy has your home number?\u201d</p><p>I ignored this disturbing tidbit and wrapped my arms around Dick\u2019s neck. \u201cDick, I\u2019m so sorry. It\u2019s Mr. Wainwright. He\u2019s gone.\u201d</p><p>Dick\u2019s bravado melted away. \u201cFrom where?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe earthly plane,\u201d I said. \u201cHe died earlier tonight.\u201d</p><p>His face contorted in pain. \u201cI\u2019ve been spending time at the shop\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no,\u201d I said, clutching Dick\u2019s hands. \u201cNobody \u2018got to him.\u2019 It was just a plain old heart attack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t get to tell him,\u201d Dick said. \u201cI didn\u2019t get to say good-bye.\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, he plans on sticking around for a while, so you could tell him right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell him what, exactly?\u201d Mr. Wainwright asked, his transparent form sliding through the door.</p><p>It\u2019s embarrassing to be surprised when you have vampire senses, particularly when the person who snuck up behind you is older than dirt. Also dead.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Mr. Wainwright asked, the gray tufts of his brows rising on his transparent forehead. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis seems like a private conversation. We should probably leave,\u201d Gabriel whispered to Zeb, though both of them stayed rooted to their spots.</p><p>\u201cOK, you two, out,\u201d I told them.</p><p>\u201cBut, but, but\u2014\u201d Zeb spluttered pitifully as I shoved the pair of them into the office and closed the door behind us.</p><p>I waited while I heard Dick quietly explaining the situation. When Mr. Wainright didn\u2019t respond, I poked my head into the room to make sure he was still there. There was an expression of relief around Dick\u2019s eyes as Mr. Wainwright stumbled forward and hugged Dick in an insubstantial manner.</p><p>This was so strange, an ancient man calling this thirty-something fellow Grandpa; in a world where logic lived, the roles would be reversed. But years melted off Mr. Wainwright\u2019s face as he studied Dick\u2019s features.</p><p>\u201cYou have my nose,\u201d Dick said sheepishly. \u201cSorry about that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a good nose,\u201d Mr. Wainwright said. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you ever say anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThought you\u2019d be better off,\u201d Dick said.</p><p>\u201cBut I wasn\u2019t,\u201d Mr. Wainwright said. \u201cIf you\u2019d been around, if I\u2019d known that vampires were real, I wouldn\u2019t have felt so lonely. It\u2019s no wonder my mother hated my interest in the paranormal. Every time I picked up a book on vampires, she was afraid I was going to turn out like you.\u201d</p><p>Dick seemed ashamed, which was something I\u2019d never seen before. \u201cI never told your mother. I think she guessed, but she never asked, and I always figured it was better left unsaid. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have so much I want to ask you. About your life, about my father, and his father, and your son.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can give you some answers,\u201d Dick said. \u201cThe rest you may not want to know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not frightened,\u201d Mr. Wainwright promised.</p><p>\u201cThis reunion is really touching,\u201d I said, backing toward the office door. \u201cBut if I see one of you cry, I may actually implode. So I\u2019m going to go elsewhere.\u201d</p><p>How did I end up going to so many funerals in one year?</p><p>There was no one else to plan Mr. Wainwright\u2019s service, which I found very sad. His nephew, Emery, sent a telegram from Guatemala saying that he wouldn\u2019t be able to make it to town for weeks. Emery advised us to proceed without him. Seriously, he used those words. Real sentimental guy.</p><p>The nighttime service was held three days later, after the police finally released the body. Mr. Wainwright had a hand in the planning, which definitely helped me cope with the grief. He was in attendance at the memorial, of course, though very few others were. It was just me, Dick, Andrea, Gabriel, Jettie, Jolene, and Zeb. Daddy came, though we neglected to tell him that we couldn\u2019t speak ill of the dead, not out of respect but because the dead was standing right there.</p><p>Mr. Wainwright didn\u2019t belong to a church, so there was no one to give a eulogy. In fact, he\u2019d left specific instructions that he did not want to be buried. He wanted his ashes spread into the Ohio River, where they would \u201cfloat downstream to the Gulf of Mexico and out into the oceans, circulating around the world.\u201d</p><p>There was no visitation, no pimento cheese, no irritating relatives circling like vultures.</p><p>In other words, it was the best funeral I\u2019d ever been to.</p><p>The riverfront in Half-Moon Hollow was a series of half-finished cement docks and inlets. The county commission had started dredging to build a channel for a riverboat in the 1970s, hedging against the chances that riverboat gambling would be legalized in Kentucky. When the state referendum failed and the outraged populace voted the commission out of their seats, the project was abandoned, leaving a gap in the Hollow\u2019s watery smile. Which, in a way, was fitting.</p><p>The one project that was completed and used was the public restrooms. I tried not to think about that.</p><p>The water, smelling of old pennies and new fish, lapped gently against the cement embankment. The moon was only half-full and half-mast, lending a soft, kind light to the proceedings. Mr. Wainwright asked that we avoid the traditional black in favor of cheerful colors, forgetting, of course, that Gabriel didn\u2019t own anything in cheerful colors. Dick\u2019s plain white T-shirt, sans sarcasm, lent an appropriate sense of solemnity to the proceedings.</p><p>The earthly remains of Gilbert Wainwright were stored in a hollowed-out copy of For Whom the Bell Tolls that Dick had purchased from a novelty store. Mr. Wainwright thought it was hilariously funny. I held the book in my hands and stood at the edge of the dock, shaking a little from the wind and the nerves.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re gathered here today to say good-bye to the mortal body of Gilbert Wainwright. He was a good man and a good friend. I didn\u2019t know him until late in his life. But he became very special to me in that time. He was a man with an endless thirst for knowledge. He asked the questions that other people are afraid of and never doubted that the answers were out there, waiting to be discovered. I\u2019m going to miss you, Mr. Wainwright. You were kind to me when you didn\u2019t have to be. You gave me a place to belong when I was adrift. Thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou will always have a place there, my dear,\u201d he said, chucking my chin with his clammy invisible hand.</p><p>I handed the book to Dick. \u201cIt\u2019s only right,\u201d I said, smiling despite the surreality of the situation. \u201cHe was your family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cQuite right,\u201d Mr. Wainwright told Dick. \u201cI\u2019d be honored.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is the weirdest funeral I\u2019ve ever been to,\u201d Zeb whispered.</p><p>\u201cShh,\u201d I said as Dick stepped forward.</p><p>Dick cleared his throat. \u201cIt\u2019s not right for a man to bury his children, so to speak. But this is the path we chose. It\u2019s a vampire\u2019s lot in life to watch those around him age and die. Gilbert, I\u2019m sorry we didn\u2019t get to know each other better.\u201d In a low voice, out of my father\u2019s earshot, he murmured, \u201cBut I hope you stick around for a while, so we can make up for that.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel was looking at Dick with a strange expression. The whole \u201cDick reproduced\u201d thing had definitely thrown him for a loop. I slipped my hand in his and gave him an encouraging nudge. Gabriel stepped beside Dick and with a stiff arm patted Dick\u2019s back as he sprinkled the ashes into the churning water.</p><p>\u201cGood-bye, cruel world,\u201d Mr. Wainwright wailed in a fading mock cry.</p><p>Everyone but Andrea, Zeb, and Daddy turned to stare at him. He grinned. \u201cToo melodramatic?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy is everyone laughing?\u201d Daddy asked.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a vampire thing. We laugh at death,\u201d I told Daddy, who nodded sagely.</p><p>Mr. Wainwright insisted on a reading of his will right after the memorial. The funeral party, without Daddy, met Mr. Wainwright\u2019s lawyer, Mr. Mayhew, the only male Hollow resident over seventy whom my grandmother had never dated, at the shop. He greeted us warmly and told us what nice things Mr. Wainwright had to say about us all.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve known Gilbert Wainwright for forty years. In that time, he spoke of two things ad nauseam: the supernatural and you. He enjoyed spending time with you, very much,\u201d he assured me. \u201cYou made the last year of his life very comfortable and happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs he here now?\u201d Mr. Mayhew asked.</p><p>I looked from Mr. Wainwright\u2019s apparition to Mr. Mayhew\u2019s wry smile. \u201cYeah. How did you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe always said he would make appearances after death. I thought it was part of his wild \u2018creatures of the night\u2019 talk. Then, after the Coming Out, we found out that creatures of the night actually exist, so my mind opened a little bit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it open enough to handle vampire wills?\u201d I asked. \u201cBecause I\u2019ve got some grabby relatives.\u201d</p><p>He handed me his card. \u201cGive me a call.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, how do we go about this?\u201d I asked. \u201cI wasn\u2019t allowed to attend any of my step-grandpas\u2019 will readings.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I need y\u2019all to sit down and have a listen. I think you should know that Gilbert changed his will quite recently. When an elderly man changes his will to include a group of recently acquainted young people, it can be of some concern for someone in my profession. But Gilbert spoke very highly of you, and he wasn\u2019t the type to gush.\u201d He cleared his throat and used an official voice. \u201cThe will goes something like this. \u2018I, Gilbert Richard Wainwright, being of sound mind and body as defined by the commonwealth of Kentucky\u2019\u2014a lot of legalese y\u2019all are more than welcome to look over later, so we can skip to the good part\u2014\u2019do bequeath the following items to my loved ones:</p><p>\u201c \u2018To Zeb Lavelle, I leave a copy of Mating Rituals and Love Customs of the Were, plus the entire stock of self-help guides related to inter-were-species marriage.\u2019 \u201c </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThat was thoughtful,\u201d Zeb said.</p><p>\u201cThat stock includes several illustrated antique marital guides which you will find in a locked box in the storeroom,\u201d Mr. Wainwright whispered to me.</p><p>\u201cOh, ew.\u201d I shuddered.</p> <p>\u201cHe just made a joke, didn\u2019t he?\u201d Mr. Mayhew asked.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you just let him see you?\u201d I asked Mr. Wainwright.</p><p>Mr. Wainwright chuckled. \u201cIt\u2019s more fun this way.\u201d</p><p>\u201c \u2018To Jolene McClaine, I leave the rosewood box in my bedroom. It contains a collection of best-loved recipes I have collected from werewolf friends all over the world.\u2019 \u201c</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s very sweet.\u201d Jolene sniffed.</p> <p>\u201cI thought you could put it to the best use,\u201d Mr. Wainwright said.</p><p>\u201c \u2018To Andrea Byrne, I leave my silver claddagh ring.\u2019 \u201c</p><p>\u201cOh, thank you,\u201d Andrea whispered.</p><p>\u201cIt should have been included in my personal effects when my remains were collected,\u201d Mr. Wainwright said.</p><p>\u201cActually\u201d\u2014I reached under the counter and grabbed the velvet pouch where I\u2019d stashed the ring\u2014\u201dI didn\u2019t think it was smart to send you to the funeral home wearing it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis belonged to a lady who was very special to me,\u201d Mr. Wainwright said as Andrea slipped it on. \u201cHer name was Brigid, and she was special and beautiful, like you. And I loved her very much.\u201d</p> <p>Knowing that Andrea couldn\u2019t hear him, I said, \u201cThat belonged to the love of his life.\u201d</p><p>Andrea smiled.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to want to be careful how you handle that around us,\u201d Dick told her. \u201cMight as well be wearing barbed wire around your finger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that has possibilities,\u201d Andrea said, wiggling her finger at him. Not the rude one.</p><p>Dick muttered something I couldn\u2019t quite make out.</p><p>\u201c \u2018To Gabriel Nightengale, the selection of his choice from my personal literary collection. To Dick Cheney, my personal spirits collection, including the wine and brandy.\u2019 \u201c</p><p>Dick and Gabriel smiled.</p><p>\u201c \u2018To Jane Jameson, I leave the Specialty Books shop located at 933 Braxton Avenue and all of its contents, including the apartment upstairs and my personal effects contained therein. I trust you to allow my nephew, Emery, to look over my personal effects and select what he would like to keep as mementos.\u2019 \u201c</p> <p>My jaw dropped. I had expected a few books. Maybe a memento or Mr. Wainwright\u2019s personal collection of Ouija boards. I had not expected him to leave me anything as important as the shop.</p><p>My eyes stung as I smiled shakily at Mr. Wainwright. I really didn\u2019t want to start crying again. I\u2019d just managed to stop. \u201cThis is too much. I didn\u2019t do anything to deserve this. And I don\u2019t know anything about running a store. Look, with your nephew coming soon, I think maybe we should consider\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one will care about the shop the way you will,\u201d Mr. Wainwright insisted. \u201cNo one will take care of the books, take care of the customers, such as they are.\u201d He turned to Dick. \u201cIf I had known about you, I would have planned differently\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot your fault,\u201d Dick interrupted. \u201cAnd you left me the booze, so it shows how well you knew me, even before you knew we were related.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd anything you want from the personal effects is yours,\u201d I told Dick. \u201cThe store stock will be available at a twenty-percent bereaved-ancestor discount.\u201d</p><p>Mr. Wainwright guffawed. \u201cSee, you\u2019ve got the makings of a brilliant entrepreneur.\u201d</p><p>I protested, \u201cI don\u2019t know anything about running a business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen sell it. Do whatever you think is best. I trust you.\u201d</p><p>Those words, combined with Mr. Wainwright\u2019s earnest, ghostly gaze, left a weird, heavy feeling in the pit of my stomach.</p><p>17</p><p>When an undesirable suitor is unwilling to accept a werewolf female\u2019s refusal, her family is likely to step in to help communicate her feelings more clearly. It can take said suitor six to eight weeks to heal up from the clan\u2019s communication skills.</p><p>\u2014Mating Rituals and Love Customs of the Were</p><p>We all adjusted to our grief in different ways.</p><p>On this particular Tuesday, Jolene and Zeb were doing a family thing with the McClaines. I think it involved wrestling Jolene\u2019s father. Andrea had a standing appointment with a client who was not afraid of Dick. Gabriel was in London. I didn\u2019t bother asking why. This left me with Dick.</p><p>No pun intended.</p><p>Dick seemed lonely, spending nights at the shop, talking to the ever-more-sprightly ghost of Mr. Wainwright, and helping me sort through boxes. We had a running bet about when Emery would show up. I had two weeks; Dick had six weeks and four days. Mr. Wainwright, who lovingly referred to his nephew as \u201ca bit mealy-mouthed and milquetoast,\u201d had twenty dollars on an even month, though how we were going to collect it from him, we had no idea.</p><p>I\u2019d dropped my investigation into Wilbur\u2019s background for the time being. I told myself that it would help me to step away, get a fresh perspective, but the truth was, I was getting nowhere. Instead, I worked from sunset to the wee hours of the morning cleaning areas that Mr. Wainwright had never let me touch: a rear storeroom, the area behind the counter, his office. For his part, Mr. Wainwright entertained himself by moving various objects around, walking through walls, and making videos float at the adult store next door, scaring several locals off porn forever.</p><p>Despite my recently developed fear of Realtors, I\u2019d had one come by and appraise the shop. He suggested burning it to the ground and going for the insurance money. While my destructive urge was just as healthy as the next girl\u2019s, I didn\u2019t consider that a viable option. I was going to have to close.</p><p>It felt like packing up Aunt Jettie\u2019s room after she died. Something important had ended, and I was left to pick up the pieces. Fortunately, Dick and Andrea seemed to pick up on this and somehow ended up at the shop every night to help me. On this particular evening, Dick was boarding over windows and putting a \u201cFor Sale by Owner\u201d sign in the window. With Andrea quietly boxing up books, I went upstairs to Mr. Wainwright\u2019s apartment, something I hadn\u2019t been able to do since the funeral.</p><p>The air was dry and smelled of cinnamon and Lipton tea. As one would expect, the place was a wreck. Good antiques were covered in Mad Hatter\u2013style stacks of books. Almost every surface not occupied by books held picture frames. There were photos of Mr. Wainwright\u2019s mother, his sister, his nephew, Emery. There was a framed photo of a beautiful redhaired woman, who I assumed was Mr. Wainwright\u2019s lost love, Brigid. There was a picture of a very young Mr. Wainwright in his Army uniform, one of him in a pith helmet exploring what looked to be an Egyptian tomb, and pictures of him bundled up against Canadian cold during his endless search for Sasquatch.</p><p>The latest addition seemed to be a picture of our Christmas party. Zeb had set up the camera timer to take a shot of the whole group. My eyes were closed, of course, but everyone looked so happy. Jolene had turned that million watt smile on Zeb. Gabriel had his arm around me. There were two little white orbs where Aunt Jettie and Grandpa Fred had stood. Andrea was wedged between Mr. Wainwright and Dick, who had his arm flung around both of them. Mr. Wainwright had placed it on the nightstand next to his low-slung single bed. It was the only photo from the last ten years in the apartment.</p><p>I felt him materialize behind me.</p><p>\u201cIt was the best time I could remember in a long time,\u201d I heard him say as I put the frame back in its place. \u201cYou were a family to me, one I sincerely wish I\u2019d had more time with.\u201d</p><p>I smiled at him, even when he asked, \u201cHow\u2019s the packing going? I saw that Dick has put up the \u2018For Sale\u2019 sign.\u201d</p><p>I felt tears bubbling up, threatening to spill. I wiped at my nose as I focused on staring at the Christmas photo.</p><p>\u201cOh, no, dear. Don\u2019t cry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t help but feel that I\u2019m failing you,\u201d I told him. \u201cYou didn\u2019t leave me the shop to close it down. But I don\u2019t know anything about running a business. I\u2019m sorry. I got fired from the only real job I\u2019ve ever had. I don\u2019t know how to do taxes or handle staff issues. I\u2019m just afraid I would screw it up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not failing, Jane,\u201d he said, his clammy hands stroking down my arms. \u201cHaving the shop, having a purpose, gave me a reason to get up every morning. I knew the shop wasn\u2019t making much money, just enough to keep me afloat. You\u2019re just making decisions I couldn\u2019t bring myself to make.\u201d Mr. Wainwright squeezed my shoulder, sending shivers down my sensitive spine. \u201cEverything has to come to an end, Jane. Except for you, of course.\u201d With that, he winked at me and faded away, leaving me to my thoughts.</p><p>I went to the stairs and stared down into the store, chewing my lip and sulking. The shop could have been something. With renovation, new stock, a new business plan, I could turn it around. If anything, the slow migration of library patrons showed that people would come to the shop if they really needed to.</p><p>Besides investment capital, the main problem was organization. Even people who knew what they were looking for couldn\u2019t find it. Hell, I worked there, and I could rarely find what I needed. If I overhauled the selections, emphasized self-help and family dynamics, aimed for people who were newly turned or whose families were newly turned, tried to help them find the resources to deal with the changes, it might work. I could even offer the Friends and Family of the Undead a place to meet, since their usual spot, a health food restaurant called the Nomad\u2019s Bowl, was on the verge of closing\u2014again. I could put a comfy meeting area in the back, especially if I bought out the adult-video store next door and expanded through the wall.</p><p>If I added a fancy coffee bar and got a license to carry blood, people would come to the store and actually stay. And then they would buy.</p><p>It would mean selling off some of Missy\u2019s properties. And hiring a cleaning crew. A very committed cleaning crew.</p><p>Maybe I could actually hire some staff. Would I hire living people or vampires? Maybe Andrea needed a night job.</p><p>Newly resolved, I marched downstairs and told Dick and Andrea to stop boxing up.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not closing,\u201d I told them. \u201cI\u2019m going to keep the store open.\u201d</p><p>Dick grinned broadly and whipped the sign out of the window. \u201cI\u2019ll just take this out to the trash.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDick\u2019s been weird all night,\u201d Andrea said as we heard the sign clang into the Dumpster in the alley. \u201cHe\u2019s barely propositioned me or anything. Is this what happens when you agree to date him? He loses interest before you even go out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI still can\u2019t believe you agreed to a date,\u201d I said. \u201cI thought you were getting some sort of sick, retaliatory pleasure from repeatedly rejecting him. I was getting sick, retaliatory pleasure out of your repeatedly rejecting him. Can\u2019t we keep playing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Andrea said, laughing. \u201cHe just kind of grows on you, like ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike fungus,\u201d I suggested.</p><p>\u201cOh, hush. You like him, you know you do. And I do, too. I guess I was just looking for an excuse to like him.\u201d She smiled to herself. \u201cBeneath all his bull and his charm, Dick\u2019s a good guy.\u201d</p><p>We turned to the door as the bell jingled. It was Adam, still wearing his soft blue scrubs from the Half-Moon Hollow Veterinary Clinic. I smiled up at him, and he responded with a dazzling grin.</p><p>\u201cWow, so this is where you work?\u201d he marveled, taking in the disheveled surroundings. \u201cThis is great, Jane. Really, really great.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, actually, it\u2019s my shop now. My boss just passed away, and he left it to me,\u201d I said, crossing to him and leaving a confused Andrea standing at the counter.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s great,\u201d he said.</p><p>I\u2019d never noticed before how much Adam used the word \u201cgreat.\u201d Instead of offering him a thesaurus, I said, \u201cThis is my friend Andrea.\u201d</p><p>Adam didn\u2019t even acknowledge her presence. He was totally focused on me, looking at me the way I\u2019m sure I looked at him all those times in math class. As if he were trying to memorize every word and gesture, so he could replay it in his head later. Now that it was turned around on me, I had to say it was unnerving.</p><p>\u201cWhat brings you down here, Adam?\u201d I asked.</p><p>He shrugged and stepped closer to me. \u201cI just wanted to see you again.\u201d</p><p>Giving me a confused look, Andrea made quietly for the office door. Whether it was emotional fatigue from Mr. Wainwright\u2019s death or his being in the store where my friends could see him, it seemed wrong for Adam to be there. I couldn\u2019t really be angry with Gabriel for sneaking around and not being honest with me when I hadn\u2019t been exactly upfront about Adam. I could lie to myself and say I didn\u2019t know what Adam was hoping for. But even I could recognize the signals he\u2019d been sending out. And I\u2019d done nothing to discourage him. Out in the open like this, the fairy-tale, adolescent-fantasy haze seemed to be stripped away, and I saw exactly how wrong I\u2019d been. Some instinct had me backing away with every step he took closer to me.</p><p>\u201cHave you recovered from your babysitting adventure?\u201d he asked, that warm, familiar smile dimpling his cheeks.</p><p>\u201cYeah. Nevie may never be the same, but every kid needs something to talk about in therapy. So I feel I\u2019ve served some purpose.\u201d I tried to keep my tone even and friendly, even as I was cornered against the counter.</p><p>He laughed, but his expression turned serious as he asked, \u201cHave you given any more thought to us spending more time together?\u201d</p><p>My heart sank a little. I\u2019d really hoped to avoid this. \u201cI\u2019m still seeing Gabriel.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Adam huffed, \u201cBut I thought we talked about that!\u201d</p><p>I chose my words deliberately, in that even voice that seemed to soothe Fitz when he was riled. I ended up sounding like a mother talking her toddler down from a tantrum. \u201cYou said if my situation ever changed, I should come talk to you. My situation hasn\u2019t changed. I\u2019m still with Gabriel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I thought you were going to change that. I thought you were going to leave him so we ... I thought we were building on something, Jane, this tension between the two of us. We\u2019re good for each other. I can make you happy. Like that kiss the other night, that meant something.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt was a kiss on the cheek, Adam,\u201d I said, alarmed by how quickly he\u2019d gone from a normal tone of voice to this angry whine.</p><p>\u201cBut it meant something to me, Jane,\u201d he insisted, wrapping his fingers around mine.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry if you got the wrong impression. I\u2019m not the kind of person who dumps one man to be with another.\u201d</p><p>Adam\u2019s blue eyes flashed. \u201cBut that\u2019s exactly why you should leave him. He\u2019s never around. I\u2019m here. I\u2019m right here. If he cared, he\u2019d never leave you alone.\u201d</p><p>Adam\u2019s words stung. And the fact that they were probably true didn\u2019t make me any happier with him for saying them. This was all wrong. It was nothing like what I\u2019d pictured. In my efforts to get away, somehow Adam had maneuvered so that I was backed up against the counter, trapped. With a feverish glint in his eyes, he plunged his hands into my hair and pulled my mouth against his. All of my emotional channels opened wide, sending a flood of images into my head. Adam kissing me in my kitchen. Adam standing in the florist, wondering what sort of flowers I would like. Adam sitting by the phone, dialing my number, and then hanging up before it rang. Adam and me talking at the funeral. But even in these fragile, human memories, I could tell that Adam didn\u2019t really see me, just an exaggerated version of me. My smiles were sharper. My eyes shone with a vicious glint. My boobs were much bigger.</p> <p>Tentatively, I flexed the invisible muscles in my mind, reaching into Adam\u2019s memory. Images raced through my head, so quickly I couldn\u2019t grab onto any of them. Like a spinner on a child\u2019s game, the muddled pictures slowed to a stop. On Adam, walking into Whitlow\u2019s Funeral Home with his mother\u2019s layered salad. He was wondering how much time he had to spend at Bob\u2019s visitation to satisfy his family\u2019s obligation to the deceased and whether he would be able to catch the final quarter of the ball game when he got home. He stopped in his tracks when he saw me standing across the room with dishes in my hands. I looked vaguely familiar and definitely hot. There was something intriguing about my smile, something sharp and slightly intimidating. He knew he\u2019d seen me around town before, but he couldn\u2019t remember my name. In the corner of my mind where I was able to feel my own emotions, this hurt. He hadn\u2019t had any clue who I was.</p><p>In Adam\u2019s memory, he spotted some church friend of his mother\u2019s at the visitation and snagged her arm politely.</p><p>\u201cHi, Mrs. Morse,\u201d he said, displaying his most winning smile. Adam offered a few platitudes about the sadness of the occasion and inquired after Mrs. Morse\u2019s health, even listening and making the appropriate sympathetic noises over her sciatica, before he finally looked in my direction and asked, \u201cThat girl over there, holding the coffee cups? Who is that?\u201d</p><p>Mrs. Morse, who was a bridge friend of my grandmother\u2019s and therefore had heard a detailed account of every stupid thing I had ever done, made a sour face. \u201cThat\u2019s Jane Jameson, Sherry\u2019s girl. I can\u2019t believe she had the nerve to show her face here. And that Ruthie is letting her mix with decent people.\u201d Mrs. Morse sniffed. \u201cSome women just have no sense when it comes to their grandchildren.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do you say that?\u201d Adam asked.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s a ...\u201d Mrs. Morse looked around to see who might be listening and lowered her voice to a stage whisper. \u201cVampire. Let herself get turned a few months ago.\u201d</p> <p>Adam\u2019s eyes zipped back across the room to my face. Jameson\u2014that name sounded familiar to him. He thought maybe he\u2019d gone to school with a Jenny Jameson, a pretty blond cheerleader who was a few years ahead of him. She\u2019d had a sister named Jane. Come to think of it, he thought, I looked a little like that klutzy egghead girl who used to stare at him in math class. God, that girl used to annoy him, always had her hand up, sometimes before the teacher asked a question. But I sure looked good now, and I was a vampire, which was even better. He\u2019d always wondered how far he could get with a vampire, without being bitten. And if I did bite, all the better.</p><p>He crossed the room while I had my back turned and deliberately bumped into me. In his mind, I saw my embarrassed smile flash, white and gleaming. \u201cA-Adam, hi!\u201d I stuttered.</p><p>Inside his head, he cringed at the sound of my voice. That much he remembered. I was definitely the know-it-all band geek. And I remembered him, as most of his former classmates did, even if he couldn\u2019t recall half of their names. That could definitely work to his advantage\u2014</p><p>I broke away from him before I could hear any more. What was worse than the direct memories were the subconscious desires I felt filtering through his brain. Adam wanted to be my pet. Well, not my pet, necessarily, but any vampire\u2019s pet. He wanted the blood play, the dangerous, possibly injurious sex, the whole dominant female package. He could live his normal life every day but explore his darker compulsions at night. He wanted what I could give him.</p><p>I felt vaguely nauseated, glaring up at Adam as he grinned expectantly. I\u2019d focused so much energy on this man. I\u2019d thought of him almost constantly for years, never really getting over my infatuation with him, even as an adult. And he couldn\u2019t even remember my name.</p><p>This was one of those defining life moments where you feel as if you\u2019re standing on the edge of a slippery cliff with barbells tied around your neck. I could do this. I could be a Marianne. I could be impetuous and adventurous, live in the moment. I had wanted Adam for years. And I could have him, even for a short while. I could throw myself headlong into a fling without thinking of the future or how it would affect the people around me. I could think about me for once. And it wouldn\u2019t be completely superficial. A part of me still hoped for something as human and seminormal as a relationship with Adam. Maybe we could make it work ...</p><p>And then the Elinor part of my brain kicked in. I would lose Gabriel. I would lose his friendship, his compassion, our conversations, everything I loved about spending time with him. Everything I\u2019d built with him in the last few months would be gone. I would be trading someone who had saved a total stranger for someone who didn\u2019t care enough to remember the name of a girl he\u2019d known since kindergarten. Adam was only interested in me now that I was dangerous. And he was kind of a tool.</p><p>Besides, Marianne ended up with Colonel Brandon, the handsome older guy with the mysterious background. And I already had one of those waiting for me. If I lost him, it would be because Gabriel left me, not because I ruined it all for my own personal Willoughby.</p> <p>\u201cYou faked it,\u201d I said, laughing bitterly. \u201cYou pretended to remember me at the funeral. All you knew was that I looked like that \u2018annoying band geek\u2019 who used to sit behind you in math. You had no idea who I was. You didn\u2019t care enough to remember my name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but then I got to know you again,\u201d Adam protested. \u201cAnd I\u2019m so glad I did, because otherwise, I might have missed out on us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is no us,\u201d I said, peeling his fingers from my arm with just a tiny bit more force than necessary. \u201cThere\u2019s me, and there\u2019s you. And you are about to leave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJane?\u201d</p><p>Dick\u2019s voice sounded to my left, from the back of the shop. He was glaring darkly at Adam, who hadn\u2019t even noticed that someone else had entered the room.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d I said quietly. Dick stepped back into the office, to be near Andrea. But he was watching over us. I didn\u2019t have to be psychic to see the protective anger he felt toward Adam.</p><p>\u201cIs this some sort of punishment?\u201d Adam demanded, flexing his bruised fingers. \u201cBecause I didn\u2019t notice you when we were kids? Well, I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t see you. But things are different now. You\u2019re different now, special. I see you. I don\u2019t see anything but you. It\u2019s crazy. I can\u2019t stop thinking about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was something special back then, Adam,\u201d I told him sternly, shoving him back.</p><p>\u201cLook, Jane, I\u2019m sorry. We can make this work.\u201d</p><p>Adam advanced on me, his intent to kiss me again burning in his eyes. In the best persuasion voice I had ever used, I growled as he scrambled back toward me. \u201cAdam, stop!\u201d</p><p>Dutifully, he froze in his tracks. And I had no idea what to tell him. It seemed to go against all of my instincts to send him away, but I didn\u2019t want him anywhere near me anymore. I couldn\u2019t be terribly angry with him. He didn\u2019t want me. As much as that hurt, it wasn\u2019t the crime of the century. Adam didn\u2019t want me. He didn\u2019t know who I was. He wanted some image of me, some imagined persona that had nothing to do with me and everything to do with Adam wanting to buck against the hometown-boy role in which he\u2019d been cast. Well, his self-image issues were not my problem.</p><p>I led him, biddable as a sacrificial lamb, to the door. I took his shoulders in my hands and forced him to meet my gaze. \u201cI want you to forget about me. Forget about me being a vampire. Forget about you being fascinated with vampires and the whole dark-side-of-the-tracks thing. You should find someone more like you. I want you to find a nice, normal girl, a girl you really like. Not just because she\u2019s sexy but because you genuinely enjoy her company. Get married, have lots of babies, and be happy.\u201d</p><p>Denial flickered across Adam\u2019s features. His eyes clenched closed, then sprang open. He shook his head slightly. In a distracted, addled tone, he said, \u201cI have to go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d I nodded and opened the door for him. With my wounded pride, I couldn\u2019t help but feel that it was better than he deserved, telling him to find someone he was compatible with. Part of me regretted not commanding him to stand on the corner of Main Street, naked, singing \u201cI\u2019m a Little Teapot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have to go,\u201d he repeated. He hesitated as he walked toward the door.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d I said, patting his shoulder, and he stumbled out.</p><p>I watched Adam stagger down the sidewalk to his SUV, struggle to pull his keys out of his pocket, and drive away. And I bid good-bye to my last mortal wish.</p><p>18</p><p>There is no information available on the inner workings of a were bachelor fete. It is assumed that the theory of mutually assured destruction prevents discussion by the participants.</p><p>\u2014Mating Rituals and Love Customs of the Were</p><p>By Adam standards, Gabriel was downright charming, even when you took the blood drinking and tree related killing into account. Now well aware of how good I really had it, I launched myself at him when he knocked on my door that night.</p><p>And he promptly untangled himself from my arms and set me on my feet.</p><p>Crap.</p><p>\u201cJane, is there anything you\u2019d like to tell me?\u201d</p><p>Gabriel had that \u201cYou\u2019ve disappointed me\u201d look on his face, which put me in an immediate confessional mode. \u201cI forgot to tell my grandmother that she\u2019s marrying a ghoul.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel shot me a withering glare. \u201cJane.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine, fine, I didn\u2019t forget. I just haven\u2019t found a way to do it yet. I\u2019ve had a lot of other stuff on my mind. Mr. Wainwright\u2019s funeral, the shop\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me rephrase. Would you like to tell me why Dick called me to recommend that I track down an Adam Morrow and, quote, \u2018put a boot up his ass\u2019 because of something he did at the shop?\u201d he demanded, fangs fully extended, eyes flashing silver. \u201cOr why you positively reek of another man?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sensing an uncalled-for tone,\u201d I warned him.</p><p>\u201cWhat do I have to do to make my feelings clear to you, Jane?\u201d he thundered. \u201cAre you deliberately trying to drive me insane? Am I going to have to follow you around town, staking my claim against your many admirers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich question do you want me to answer first?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cI would like to know what your plans are for Mr. Morrow,\u201d he spat. \u201cYou said yourself that you had fantasies about him when you were young.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSchoolgirl fantasies,\u201d I corrected him. \u201cI said \u2018schoolgirl fantasies,\u2019 emphasis on the schoolgirl. I haven\u2019t been a schoolgirl in several years.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel\u2019s voice softened, responding to my quiet, cool tone. \u201cHe was the first boy you ever loved, even if it wasn\u2019t reciprocated.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you for putting it that way, very sensitive.\u201d I glared at him.</p><p>\u201cAnd maybe some part of you is encouraging his attentions,\u201d he said, \u201cwhether it\u2019s to fulfill those fantasies or to avenge the rejected gawky girl you once were.\u201d</p><p>I stood gazing at him in shocked silence.</p><p>\u201cYou said you were gawky. Those were your words, not mine.\u201d Gabriel said, sounding slightly panicked when faced with my angry expression.</p><p>And suddenly, I was exhausted. All of the confidence in our relationship that I\u2019d felt before just evaporated. Was this ever going to end? Couldn\u2019t I just have a normal, calm conversation with my boyfriend? Would he ever stop using that disappointed-father voice on me? I took a deep breath, trying to keep my voice as calm and even as possible. \u201cI thought we\u2019d settled this. I don\u2019t want to be with anyone else, Gabriel. I only want you. Adam made an overture, and I let him know that I didn\u2019t want anything to do with him.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Without a word, he turned on his heel and stormed toward the door. I used my superhuman speed to step around him and throw myself across the doorway. \u201cNo, no. No. Just leave it alone. Trust that I took care of it. Take a leap of faith that I managed to handle a situation on my own without completely screwing it up. Besides, if anyone should be asking the pointed questions around here, it\u2019s me. You\u2019re the one disappearing every time I turn around, not answering your phone, not staying where you say you\u2019re going to be.\u201d</p><p>Oh. That was one of those things I didn\u2019t plan on saying out loud.</p><p>Gabriel\u2019s mouth was set in a tight line as his face turned an ashy gray. \u201cDon\u2019t stray from the point, Jane.\u201d</p> <p>But the door was open. And damn it, I needed answers. Even Elinor has her limits. So I took a deep breath and chose my words carefully. \u201cGabriel, please tell me the truth. Where have you been going the last few months? Who\u2019s Jeanine?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t something I can talk about right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen when?\u201d I asked. \u201cWhy can\u2019t you tell me? Why don\u2019t you call me when you\u2019re out of town? What\u2019s the big secret?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is no big secret, Jane.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook, when we started this, you were cryptic, but you didn\u2019t lie to me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not lying!\u201d he growled.</p><p>I threw up my hands. \u201cFine, editing the full truth to spare my feelings. The point is, you\u2019re keeping things from me. I don\u2019t want to be this girl, OK? I hate that I\u2019ve gone here. I\u2019m just trying to figure out why the person who says he loves me is lying to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d he said, clasping my shoulders. \u201cTrust me, it\u2019s not as bad as whatever scenario you\u2019ve come up with.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen just tell me what\u2019s going on so I can stop worrying about it!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014I can\u2019t,\u201d he said finally.</p><p>\u201cDamn it, Gabriel!\u201d I shouted, stamping my foot. Unfortunately, the impact of my shoe on the floorboards shook a heavy porcelain vase from its shelf overhead, bringing it crashing down on Gabriel\u2019s head.</p> <p>Well, everyone has a little bit of Marianne in them.</p><p>\u201cThat was an accident,\u201d I assured him, dodging just before he stomped down on the floorboards and sent a cuckoo clock crashing down on my head. \u201cOw!\u201d</p><p>I shoved him hard, sending him sprawling into the living room and over the couch. He popped up and used his inhuman speed to jump across the room and throw me to the floor. I kicked down, crushing his toes with my heel. He yowled, hopping on one foot and toppling over next to me. I rolled over him, pulling at his shirt as I called him filthy, unrepeatable names.</p><p>He caught my wrists, rolling and pinning me to the floor. He panted and broke into a wide grin. I gasped, slapping at his shoulders. I pulled my shirt back into place and struggled to untangle myself from his legs. \u201cYou\u2019re turned on right now, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d he insisted, looking all offended and righteous for a moment, until his poker face broke and he was forced to say, \u201cYes, yes, I am.\u201d</p><p>I threw my head back and growled, shaking various bric-a-brac with the sound of my frustration.</p><p>Gabriel looked only slightly ashamed. \u201cI can\u2019t help it. You know I love it when you\u2019re all spluttery and defensive and aggressive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is sick. Gabriel, we can\u2019t keep doing this. We cannot resolve all of our problems with violent, dirty sex.\u201d</p> <p>Gabriel groaned, leaning his forehead against my shoulder. \u201cOh, we\u2019re not going to go through this again, are we? Violent and dirty works for us, Jane.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s not a healthy way to work things out. We need to learn to use our words. I\u2019ll start us off. Who the hell is Jeanine?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not what you think, Jane, I promise you. When the time is right, I\u2019ll explain everything\u2014\u201d</p><p>Zeb burst through the door, his head swathed in white gauze. He looked as if he\u2019d just escaped from a scene in One Flew over the Cuckoo\u2019s Nest.</p><p>I moaned and made use of several words. Obscene words, but at least I was using some.</p><p>Zeb was clearly disturbed by the sight of the two of us all wrapped up in each other, but he didn\u2019t take a hint to turn around and leave. \u201cHey, Jolene wanted me to drop these bridal-party itineraries off, so you\u2019ll be sure to be aware of your duties every minute of our wedding day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cZeb, this isn\u2019t a good time,\u201d I told him.</p><p>Gabriel seemed grateful for an interruption, but he didn\u2019t bother getting up or pulling his shirt back on. \u201cCan we talk about the headgear?\u201d He nodded to the gauze, which I now noticed was spotted with blood around his left ear.</p><p>\u201cEverything\u2019s fine,\u201d he assured me as Gabriel and I disengaged and got to our feet. \u201cIt was just an accident.\u201d</p><p>\u201cZeb, you\u2019re wearing a sling around your head,\u201d I said, inspecting the dandy bandaging work and earning a slap on the hand from the testy groom. \u201cYou just got out of the eye patch!\u201d</p><p>He sighed. \u201cI was fishing with Jolene\u2019s family, and uncle Burt cast back\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou got a hook in the ear?\u201d I cringed. \u201cOh, gross! Was the worm still on it?\u201d</p><p>Zeb made a face. \u201cNo, but thanks for the silver lining. And news flash: the emergency room uses Super Glue instead of stitches now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe knew you were standing right behind him, and he cast back anyway?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, in fact, before he did it, he leaned over to Luke and said, \u2018Watch this,\u2019 \u201c Zeb muttered. \u201cI\u2019m getting pretty sick of this crap. Jolene\u2019s not doing anything about it. I\u2019m starting to wonder ... well, I just wish they would stop going for my head.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOut of all of this, that\u2019s what you find disturbing?\u201d</p><p>Zeb rolled his eyes at me. \u201cNo, I find it disturbing that Timothy Dalton ranks highest on your \u2018Which James Bond Would You Do?\u2019 list.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Living Daylights is highly underrated.\u201d I sulked when Gabriel gave me a surprised look.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know if I can do this,\u201d Zeb said. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I can put up with her family. It\u2019s never going to stop, and she\u2019s never going to want to move away from them. I just don\u2019t get why she wants to stay close to them.\u201d</p><p>He looked up at me, and a film of unshed tears seemed to be obscuring his normally clear brown eyes. \u201cJane, isn\u2019t there anything you want to tell me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sort of out of my element here, Zeb.\u201d I looked up to Gabriel. \u201cWill you please talk to him? Have some sort of man-to-man exchange?\u201d</p><p>Gabriel cleared his throat and placed a fatherly hand on Zeb\u2019s shoulder. \u201cLoving family members do not aim for each other\u2019s soft tissues.\u201d</p><p>I made my angry-girlfriend face at him. He sighed and dug deeper into the wisdom well. \u201cZeb, you\u2019re dealing with a lot of dominant alpha-male personalities here. You\u2019re going to have to do something to show them that you\u2019re not a beta. You have to establish dominance. The next time the cousins are gathered, walk up to the biggest, strongest one and stare him right in the eye. And tell him to go fetch something for you. Use those exact words. \u2018Fetch me a soda\u2019 or \u2018Fetch me that chair.\u2019 And if he hesitates, keep staring at him until he folds ... or he\u2019ll beat you severely. Either way, it will improve the pack\u2019s respect for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought that was what you were supposed to do the first day you go to prison,\u201d I muttered.</p><p>\u201cJolene loves you,\u201d Gabriel said. \u201cNo matter what happens with her family, you just have to focus on that.\u201d He glanced up at me. \u201cAnd remember that if she does things that don\u2019t make any sense to you, she might be trying to do what\u2019s best for you both.\u201d</p><p>I narrowed my eyes at him. He shrugged.</p><p>Zeb was placated with more generic relationship advice and the promise that Gabriel would serve as his personal vampire bodyguard during the wedding festivities. We finally shoved him out the door, and I turned on Gabriel.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not done with you,\u201d I told him.</p><p>He gave an easy grin. \u201cWell, that\u2019s nice to hear.\u201d</p><p>I glared at him, and it was if he suddenly remembered that we were in the middle of a disagreement when Zeb burst in. \u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>I threaded my fingers through his and locked eyes with him. \u201cDo you want to be in a relationship with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you, Jane. More than I\u2019ve loved anyone, I love you.\u201d</p><p>I smiled at the warm feeling that spread through my chest at those words. It was like having a heartbeat again. \u201cThen don\u2019t keep things from me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust give me a little more time,\u201d he begged. \u201cI\u2019ll explain everything when the time is right. Just wait a little while longer.\u201d</p><p>I took a deep breath, looking deep into Gabriel\u2019s eyes. If anyone had proven his devotion to me, it was Gabriel. Even if that devotion was destructive, it had a single focus, and that was me. I held his interest even when I was just my \u201cannoying\u201d human self. He didn\u2019t consider my brain or personality something to overcome. He\u2019d saved me. He\u2019d killed for me. He\u2019d loved me. And for all of that, I owed him a little bit of trust.</p><p>\u201cI love you, too,\u201d I said, cupping his face in my hands. I locked eyes with him, leveling him with my gaze. \u201cSo I\u2019ll wait. I want you to tell me what\u2019s causing you so much stress. Maybe I can help. But I want you to do it in your own time. However, you should know that if that time doesn\u2019t come soon\u2014\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cYou will threaten any number of my orifices. I understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it orifices or orifici?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m rather shocked that you don\u2019t know,\u201d he admitted.</p><p>The countdown to the wedding was two weeks. It was a slow night in the shop, and I had just given up on sorting through any old boxes after a traumatic incident in which Dick had to kill a rather large spider for me. I swear that thing chased me onto that chair.</p><p>When Dick returned, I had put the spider\u2019s box in the alley and opened up my file of notes for what Zeb had termed \u201cOperation Undead Gigolo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Dick asked, peering over my shoulder. \u201cOh, honey, this is worse than I thought. Normal, well-adjusted girls do not spend Friday nights looking through autopsy reports.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen have you ever known me to be well adjusted or normal?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cI concede.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m looking into the guy my grandma is marrying. He seems sketchy. He drinks pig\u2019s blood. According to this, he\u2019s dead.\u201d I showed him the death certificate. \u201cAnd he\u2019s been married several times to women who don\u2019t quite make it past their first anniversary. He\u2019s not registered on any of the official undead databases, but according to the chapel that handled his burial, he went to his grave intact, so it\u2019s possible he\u2019s a vampire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWouldn\u2019t it be easier just to ask him whether he\u2019s one of us?\u201d Dick asked, looking over Wilbur\u2019s coroner\u2019s report.</p><p>\u201cI would, but my grandma Ruthie seems to be actively avoiding me. She doesn\u2019t come to Mama\u2019s house if she knows I\u2019m going to be there. She screens my calls. She won\u2019t let me near Wilbur, but I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s because he\u2019s trying to hide something or she\u2019s afraid of me embarrassing her. There\u2019s no legitimate address listed for this guy, and the last three homes he shared with the corpse brides have been sold. I went to his grave to see if there was anything abnormal about it. It seemed fine. I wasn\u2019t about to try to dig him up and see if the coffin was empty, because that\u2019s how horror movies start. Dick, are you even listening to me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh,\u201d Dick said, looking over Wilbur\u2019s death report. \u201cSorry, no. This is weird.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWeird ha-ha? Or weird our territory weird?\u201d</p><p>Dick turned the paperwork to get a better look. \u201cWell, the nurse who did the CPR on him, Jay Lemuels, I know him. He\u2019s one of us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere can we find Jay?\u201d I asked.</p><p>Dick checked the grandfather clock on the wall. \u201cThis time of night, probably Club Rainn. It\u2019s a vampire bar. Good blood, bad sound system.\u201d</p><p>Dick jangled the keys out of his pocket.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going,\u201d he told me. \u201cThe night is young, and we\u2019re immortal, and there are unanswered questions afoot. If that doesn\u2019t make a case for a couple of beers and a ridiculously high cover charge, Stretch, I don\u2019t know what does.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe last time I went out on the town with you, I ended up a suspect in Walter\u2019s murder.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be there to keep an eye on you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know if that will keep me out of trouble or just get me into it more efficiently.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s Karaoke Night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOK, but you have to sing one Kenny Rogers song in a falsetto,\u201d I said, poking him in the chest.</p><p>\u201cI will sing,\u201d he said, tossing me my jacket. \u201cBut only because my version of \u2018The Gambler\u2019 is both inspirational and erotic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGross.\u201d</p><p>We climbed into Dick\u2019s beat-up transportation, which smelled suspiciously of burnt rope. There were dozens of empty blood bottles on the floor and what might have been counterfeit Gap jeans. I turned back to him. \u201cIf we get pulled over, am I going to have to tell the nice policeman that I\u2019ve never met you before and I have no idea how those stolen car stereos got into the trunk?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI make no apologies for how I make my living, so to speak,\u201d Dick said. \u201cI am simply a businessman, a servant to supply and demand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs long as someone else pays for the supply, you can meet the demand.\u201d</p><p>We continued this philosophical discussion of the entrepreneurial spirit until we pulled into the parking lot of Club Rainn. From the exterior, the club was pretty nondescript, aside from not having windows or a sign. Club Rainn offered all-the-undead-can-drink for free to attract vampires, like shooting fish in a barrel. The humans were the cash cows that kept this place going. As soon as we hit the door, the overpowering smell of blood practically knocked me to my knees. Desperation, fear, arousal. The sour, stale scent of need.</p> <p>It was the sort of place Chris Hansen was always exposing on Dateline, where sad humans offer themselves up as midnight snacks to vampires without dignity. These were basically overgrown teenagers in too much makeup, too much leather. In fact, they\u2019d look like total doofuses if the lights were on.</p><p>The DJ played only two records, Nine Inch Nails\u2019 The Downward Spiral and the Blade soundtrack. It was incongruous with the decor, which was early American bordello. Red flocked wallpaper, dark ornately carved furniture, uncomfortably stylized red velvet couches. To be honest, it looked like River Oaks before Aunt Jettie got hold of it. Besides the hurricane-lamp sconces, the only wall decorations were oil paintings of historical figures who were supposedly vampires, from Vlad the Impaler and Elizabeth Bathory to Mercy Brown.</p><p>\u201cI take it Gabriel has never brought you here?\u201d Dick asked, taking in my horrified expression. \u201cHe probably thinks it blasphemous or unpatriotic or one of those terms that basically means he\u2019s a tight-ass with no sense of humor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know that you\u2019re not going to get me to play along when you say something like that,\u201d I told him. \u201cYou say you\u2019re interested in Andrea and I\u2019m just a friend. You\u2019ve even been getting along\u2014well, tolerating Gabriel\u2019s presence. Why are you still making those comments about Gabriel?\u201d</p><p>Dick mulled that over for a moment. \u201cForce of habit. What the\u2014\u201d Dick was interrupted as a pale, lanky man with a shock of badly dyed black curly hair knelt before me and kissed my sandaled feet. Unfortunately, the sandals were pretty old, so I can only imagine how funky that must have been.</p> <p>\u201cUm, can I help you?\u201d I asked, finally resorting to kicking him slightly to get him off my foot.</p><p>He peered up at me. \u201cYou are a Lonely One, are you not? A Night Childe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not exactly burning up the social scene, but I wouldn\u2019t classify myself as lonely. It\u2019s not as if I have a bunch of cats or something.\u201d</p><p>A similarly pasty girl with stringy platinum hair and smudged kohl around her eyes joined him at my feet. Dick snickered, but covered it by taking a swig of beer. \u201cWe wish to drink at the fount of your wisdom,\u201d the blonde whispered.</p><p>\u201cShow us the way,\u201d Floppy Black Hair intoned.</p><p>\u201cJason\u2014\u201d</p> <p>Floppy Black Hair objected. \u201cMy name is Bowan Ravenswood, ancient one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour name is Jason Turner, and we went to Vacation Bible School together.\u201d I pulled my foot out of his grip once again.</p><p>\u201cLet me\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cRemove your hand, or that will be the last time you know the touch of a woman.\u201d</p><p>His smile was feverish. \u201cI would be happy to have you initiate me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJason, go home, or I\u2019ll have my mama call your mama.\u201d</p><p>I grimaced at Dick as the pasty pair slinked away.</p><p>\u201cDid you set that up?\u201d I demanded. \u201cIs that like the vampire version of the TGI Friday\u2019s wait staff singing \u2018Happy Birthday\u2019?\u201d</p> <p>Dick looked completely innocent for the first time since I\u2019d met him. \u201cNo, that was totally spontaneous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour lack of guile upsets me,\u201d I said, watching as Jason approached a more receptive-looking Lonely One. I shook my head.</p><p>As another whey-faced youth approached with beseeching eyes, I held up a hand and told him \u201cNo.\u201d I took a long sip of my drink and closed my eyes.</p><p>Sensing female distress, the bartender, a tall brunet with heavily lined brown eyes and a gold ankh stud in his ear, replaced my drink with a flourish and winked at me. \u201cSo, what brings you here tonight, besides karaoke?\u201d</p><p>Dick cleared his throat, drawing the barkeep\u2019s unsettling attention from me. \u201cWe\u2019re looking for Jay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe still owe you money?\u201d the brunet asked. \u201cI don\u2019t want any trouble, not with this crowd in here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but I gave up on collecting it a while ago,\u201d Dick said. \u201cJay\u2019s got more sob stories than an Oprah episode.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn that case, he\u2019s right behind you, warming up for his Pat Benatar medley,\u201d the bartender said, grinning at me. \u201cGet a couple of drinks in them, and every vampire thinks he\u2019s Celine Dion.\u201d</p><p>I laughed as Dick turned and spotted a tall, towheaded vampire by the karaoke machine. Jay almost smiled, then realized who he was looking at and bolted.</p><p>\u201cGo to the back exit,\u201d Dick said before dashing after him through the crowd. \u201cCut him off if he circles back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is this, Cagney and Lacey?\u201d I asked. \u201cI am not Tyne Daly.\u201d</p><p>The barkeep shrugged. \u201cJust take it outside, please.\u201d</p><p>Dick had caught up with Jay before he reached the front door, making my \u201ccircling back\u201d unnecessary.</p><p>Jay had the face of an angel but apparently no spine. Strong chin, Roman nose, full pouting lips, the deepest blue eyes I\u2019ve ever seen. And because of the parallels to Adam, I took a bit of an instant dislike to him. His eyes darted wildly as I approached. \u201cIs this is about that cash I owe you? Because I didn\u2019t know where to find you after your trailer burned down. My phone got cut off because of a mix-up with the billing. My dog got sick. Who is she? Is this your enforcer? What\u2019s she going to do? Is she going to cut off my nose? I told you, man, not necessary. I\u2019ll get the money to you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Jay, I kissed that money good-bye a long time ago,\u201d Dick said, looking up to me. \u201cJay has a fixation on someone cutting off his nose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo spite his face?\u201d I chirped. Both Jay and Dick gave me blank looks. \u201cNobody gets me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cJane, this handsome reprobate is Jay,\u201d he said, standing Jay up and dusting off his shoulders. \u201cJay, this is my friend Jane.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey there, how you doing?\u201d he said, grinning with the relief of an unexpected reprieve.</p><p>\u201cDick\u2019s told me all about you. Don\u2019t even try,\u201d I lied, my tone a little snottier than I usually used in an introduction. I would not be charmed by a pretty face, I swore. I would not be charmed by a pretty face.</p><p>\u201cJust because I\u2019m not collecting doesn\u2019t mean I won\u2019t let her kick you in the goods,\u201d Dick warned him. \u201cShe\u2019s got a lot of repressed anger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf it\u2019s not about the money, why are you after me?\u201d Jay whined.</p><p>Dick nodded to me, which apparently meant I was in charge of questioning. I guess I was Tyne Daly.</p><p>\u201cA few years ago, you were working at Sunnyside Retirement Village\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, they fired me over a few missing watches. Can you believe that?\u201d he huffed, indignant.</p><p>\u201cI really can\u2019t. In fact, I think it might have had a little more to do with you turning one of the patients into a vampire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Jay cried. \u201cWhy would I do that? They were half-dead anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you have no idea how Wilbur Goosen is still walking around?\u201d</p><p>Jay gave me an innocent look that I\u2019m sure many girls have lost their wallets and/or undergarments to. \u201cNot really, no.\u201d</p><p>Dick flicked Jay\u2019s ear. \u201cTalk to her, Jay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do you keep doing that?\u201d I asked when Jay yowled.</p><p>Dick paused flicking. \u201cBecause it bothers him. A lot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOK, OK, so I turned the old guy. Nothing wrong with that,\u201d Jay insisted. \u201cHe even paid me, a thousand dollars. He was going to rat me out, man. I needed that job. Do you know how many night-nurse positions there are for men out there? Not a lot. People seem to think that we can\u2019t be trusted around the patients or something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t imagine,\u201d I commented, my voice as dry as dust.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t even give him the full dose. Just enough to make him wake up in three days. Sort of a halfsie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you did turn him into a ghoul? Dang it, Jay,\u201d Dick growled. \u201cYou know we\u2019re not supposed to do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the big deal?\u201d Jay whined. \u201cIt\u2019s not like he would have been very strong anyway.\u201d</p><p>I flicked Jay\u2019s ear myself. \u201cYeah, no big deal. He\u2019s just been bumping off human wives for about fifteen years, but what\u2019s a few old ladies? I mean, you got a thousand dollars out of the deal, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s it to you?\u201d Jay whined. \u201cI\u2019ve heard about you. You\u2019ve had your share of run-ins with the council.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to be his step-granddaughter,\u201d I said, flicking his ear again. \u201cAss!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOw!\u201d Jay cried. \u201cStop with the ears. Look, I was supposed to get Wilbur out of the home before the coroner got there. That was part of the deal. He wasn\u2019t supposed to be declared dead or leave a paper trail. I mean, this was before the Coming Out. Nobody knew we existed. But I\u2019d never made another vampire before. I didn\u2019t know how tired it made you. I went to my trunk to lie down, and by the time I woke up, it was already daylight, and the body had been moved. So I went to the funeral home\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you were hoping he\u2019d been embalmed and wouldn\u2019t rise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow was I supposed to know his family wouldn\u2019t pay for a full funeral?\u201d He snorted. \u201cCheap bastards.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome people.\u201d Dick shook his head piteously as we departed for his car.</p><p>\u201cSo, we\u2019re square, right?\u201d Jay called. \u201cI don\u2019t owe you, and you\u2019re not going to call council? Right? Dick?\u201d</p><p>Exhausted and confused, I slumped through the front door at River Oaks and passed the living-room door only to skid to a stop and backtrack. No, the eyes don\u2019t lie. Mr. Wainwright and Aunt Jettie. Kissing.</p><p>\u201cWhat the?\u201d They jumped apart. \u201cWhat is going on? Were you two making out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Aunt Jettie cried.</p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d Mr. Wainwright admitted.</p><p>\u201cOh, come on. Dating Grandpa Fred wasn\u2019t enough, now you\u2019ve moved on to my surrogate grandpa? Wait, what about Grandpa Fred? Does he know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Aunt Jettie said, the slightest hint of color slipping into her translucent cheeks. \u201cHe was very upset about it. He and all of your other step-grandpas are refusing to speak to me. It\u2019s cut me off from almost half the dead people in town.\u201d</p><p>I glared at her. \u201cSo, you were sneaking off to be together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe didn\u2019t want to upset you or make you worry,\u201d Mr. Wainwright said.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re in love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yuck. I mean, I\u2019m happy for you, but this is just a lot to absorb. We\u2019ll deal with this later, OK? After I\u2019ve had some sleep. I love you guys, both of you. But for the love of all that\u2019s good and decent, make yourselves invisible or something when you do that.\u201d</p><p>19</p><p>While were clans place special emphasis on male leadership, it\u2019s important to remember to show proper respect to the packs\u2019 older women. They don\u2019t lose their teeth until well into their 90s.</p><p>\u2014Mating Rituals and Love Customs of the Were</p><p>I didn\u2019t know if or how I was going to approach Grandma Ruthie with Jay\u2019s information about Wilbur. Fortunately, that decision was taken out of my hands when I woke a few nights later to find her in my living room. With Wilbur. And my parents. And my sister.</p><p>I guess I shouldn\u2019t have been surprised. No matter how many times I changed the locks, Grandma Ruthie always managed to get in. River Oaks being her ancestral home, she felt she has the right to come and go whenever she wants. I considered an electric fence, but Jettie said it would ruin the aesthetics of the property.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you guys doing here?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cWell, I thought that since you haven\u2019t been able to make it to dinner lately, we would bring dinner to you. I\u2019ll just pop this into the oven to keep it warm.\u201d Mama clapped her hands in her excitement over \u201croast on the go.\u201d She does love to take her food on tour. \u201cI wanted to give you and your sister time to talk,\u201d Mama stage whispered as she hustled me into the kitchen. \u201cI think she\u2019s ready to apologize to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCouldn\u2019t have stopped her, huh?\u201d I muttered to my dad.</p><p>He shook his head sadly. \u201cI tried. I really tried.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy shouldn\u2019t I be able to come see my own granddaughter?\u201d Grandma Ruthie sniffed, stroking a china shepherdess that Jettie had loved. \u201cBesides, I grew up in this house. The doors of River Oaks are never closed to an Early.\u201d</p><p>Aunt Jettie, who appeared behind Grandma Ruthie, rolled her eyes.</p><p>\u201cThey will be if I get that electric fence,\u201d I muttered.</p><p>Grandma\u2019s watery blue eyes narrowed at me. \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing, Grandma,\u201d I said, forcing myself to sit without any petulant flopping.</p><p>\u201cWell, I think it\u2019s nice to see a big family getting together like this,\u201d Wilbur said, making himself comfortable on the couch and grabbing the remote control. \u201cDo you get the Weather Channel, Janie?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou are losing control of your own home, pumpkin,\u201d Aunt Jettie said.</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, are you going to offer us something to drink, or do you normally let guests die of thirst?\u201d Grandma Ruthie demanded in a tone that had me jumping back to my feet. Man, she was good at that.</p> <p>\u201cWould you like some iced tea?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cSweet, please,\u201d she said.</p><p>Jettie appeared at my elbow as I emptied the tea jug. To be honest, I only kept it around for Zeb and Jolene, and I had no idea when it had been brewed. \u201cLace it with Ex-Lax. It will do her some good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t start,\u201d I warned her quietly. \u201cLet\u2019s just get everybody out of here as quickly as possible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat was that, honey?\u201d Mama asked as she puttered around my cabinets looking for dishes that had been washed up to her standards.</p> <p>\u201cNothing,\u201d I said, pouring the tea into a proper glass, with lemon. No laxative enhancements. I turned to find Jenny standing behind me, arms crossed, jaw set.</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>Jenny threw up her hands. \u201cWell?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, Mama said you had something to say to me,\u201d Jenny ground out. \u201cShe said you were ready to apologize.\u201d</p><p>I shot Mama a scathing look. \u201cWell, that\u2019s funny, because Mama said you were ready to apologize to me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy would I apologize to you?\u201d Jenny demanded.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, for suing me? And by the way, I don\u2019t think my lawyer would appreciate your being here right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow, girls,\u201d Mama sighed.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m suing you to get what I deserve!\u201d Jenny cried.</p><p>\u201cTrust me, you don\u2019t want what you deserve,\u201d I shot back.</p><p>\u201cThis was obviously pointless.\u201d Jenny groaned. \u201cEnjoy your dinner, Mama.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Jenny, don\u2019t go,\u201d Mama wheedled as Jenny stomped out. \u201cYou just have to stay and talk this through.\u201d</p><p>Grandma Ruthie must have cut Jenny off at the living room, because she and Wilbur were marching my sister back into the kitchen.</p> <p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to go, Jenny. You have every right to be here,\u201d Grandma told her. \u201cYou\u2019re staying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019m sure there are way more insulting things you can say to me in my own house.\u201d I grabbed a bottle of Faux Type O out of the fridge because I knew it would bother Jenny that much more.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not your home,\u201d Grandma Ruthie sniffed. \u201cIt belongs to all Earlies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s a handy piece of information. I\u2019ll keep you guys in mind the next time I\u2019m writing out the property-tax check. Or the check for the new boiler. Or the next time I have to make roof repairs.\u201d</p><p>Jenny huffed, indignant. \u201cIf it\u2019s such a burden\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a burden. I\u2019m just tired of you and Grandma Ruthie talking as if I fell into this no-maintenance pile of clover. It takes time, hard work, and money to maintain this house. And frankly, I\u2019m better prepared to do that than either of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you\u2019re a vampire,\u201d Grandma asked snidely.</p><p>\u201cYeah, because I\u2019m a vampire. And you know, that\u2019s the first time you\u2019ve actually said the v-word. So thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to go through this business again,\u201d Grandma sighed, waving my concerns away like buzzing insects.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think we went though this business the first time,\u201d I said. \u201cYou\u2019ve mostly ignored me and any mention of my being a vampire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know, when I was a young woman, people stayed dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry. This must be a real inconvenience for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you sass me!\u201d she screeched.</p><p>Wilbur wagged his finger at me. \u201cYoung lady, you need to learn some respect for your elders.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWilbur, I don\u2019t think you want to get involved in this,\u201d I told him.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s all calm down and talk about this like rational people,\u201d Daddy said.</p><p>\u201cJane, Jenny, stop it. You\u2019re upsetting your father,\u201d Mama said, wringing one of my dishtowels into knots.</p><p>\u201cSherry, hush. Jenny and Jane have been due for this conversation for a long time. I think we need to let them have it.\u201d Daddy tried to pull Mama and Grandma out the door, toward the living room, but Grandma wouldn\u2019t budge.</p><p>\u201cNo, there are things that Jane needs to hear,\u201d Grandma Ruthie insisted. \u201cYou all have coddled her for way too long and let her get away with saying or doing whatever she wants. It\u2019s time she heard the truth about how this family feels about her letting herself get turned into a vampire. We\u2019re ashamed, Jane. We\u2019re embarrassed. What you\u2019ve let yourself become reflects badly on us all.\u201d</p><p>Daddy\u2019s face flushed, and he actually raised his voice to yell, \u201cDon\u2019t you put words into my mouth, Ruthie\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Jenny was only trying to show you what you\u2019re facing when you go out among decent people.\u201d Grandma sniffed. \u201cDecent people don\u2019t want a vampire living in their neighborhood. You\u2019re just making things harder for yourself. I really think the best thing for you to do is to deed the house over to Jenny. She can sell her house and give you some of the proceeds to start fresh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s finally lost her mind,\u201d Jettie whispered. \u201cSomebody slap her. Hell, slap her just to entertain me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow, Mama, you\u2019re not making any sense!\u201d Mama exclaimed. \u201cYou need to sit down and rest. You\u2019re not yourself right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStart fresh where, exactly?\u201d I asked Grandma Ruthie, the icy calm in my voice making the color drain from Mama\u2019s cheeks.</p><p>\u201cA big city, like New York or San Francisco, where you\u2019d find more of your kind,\u201d she said, patting my hand for about a millisecond before drawing back.</p><p>\u201cIn other words, a big city that\u2019s thousands of miles away from you or anyone you know,\u201d I said in the calmest tone I could manage.</p><p>\u201cWell, yes.\u201d She preened, pleased that I was seeing things her way at last. Wilbur smiled broadly, the slightest edge of his canines peeking out over his lips, as he wrapped an arm around my grandmother. He looked so damn smug that the following just sort of slipped out:</p><p>\u201cYou know what, I wasn\u2019t going to do this. But since you brought up the whole undead-shame thing, I think you should know that your husband-to-be is not quite fully living himself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJane, what are you talking about?\u201d Mama asked.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s just being dramatic,\u201d Grandma Ruthie huffed. \u201cYou know how she is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I just make random stuff up, like, for instance, that I saw Wilbur walking out of a vampire bar at four A.M. And also I did a little research on Wilbur\u2019s special macrobiotic health shakes that you so lovingly cart around for him, the key ingredient of which is Sus scrofa domestica. Common domestic pig. You\u2019ve been hauling around pig\u2019s blood in your precious Aigner bag.\u201d</p><p>Wilbur didn\u2019t respond. He merely stared bullet holes through me with those rheumy brown eyes. Grandma, however, turned four different shades of pissed off and seemed to be struck mute. It was too good to last.</p><p>\u201cYou may have gone too far there,\u201d Aunt Jettie murmured.</p><p>\u201cWhat a horrible thing to say! Why? Why would you say that?\u201d Grandma Ruthie cried. \u201cYou\u2019re always so sarcastic and hurtful when it comes to your step-grandfathers. So hurtful, so judgmental. You think I don\u2019t hear your little comments, but I do. Can you tell me why you don\u2019t think I deserve a little bit of happiness, a little comfort, in my last years?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been having your last years since I was in middle school!\u201d I cried. \u201cAnd I think you\u2019ve had more than your share of happiness and comfort in your last years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you like Wilbur?\u201d Grandma whined.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that I don\u2019t like Wilbur. I don\u2019t know him well enough to dislike him. No offense, Wilbur. But there are things in his background that don\u2019t add up, things I think you should know about before you launch yourself down the aisle again. For instance, do you know how many times he\u2019s been married?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust once, to his high-school sweetheart,\u201d Grandma said, dismissing me.</p><p>\u201cSix times,\u201d I corrected her, and nodded to her engagement ring. \u201cYou might want to ask yourself how many women have worn that tasteful solitaire over the years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou told me\u2014you\u2014you told me once!\u201d Grandma Ruthie exclaimed, staring at Wilbur and her left hand in alternating horror.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think you can afford to throw stones here, Ruthie,\u201d Daddy said.</p><p>\u201cJohn!\u201d Mama cried.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s all I\u2019m saying!\u201d Daddy said, throwing up his arms.</p><p>\u201cOh, Wilbur was married once, when he was still living. See, he actually kicked the bucket in 1993. But this bachelor ghoul didn\u2019t let that keep him down.\u201d</p><p>Mama tsked. \u201cNow, Jane, I know you\u2019re upset, but that\u2019s a very unkind thing to say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Jane, there\u2019s no reason to be nasty,\u201d Jenny said absently. She\u2019d paled and was sitting at the kitchen table, running her fingers over the smoothed old wood. She looked as if she was going to blow some very un-Martha-like chunks on my hand-hooked rag rug.</p><p>\u201cI mean, he\u2019s an actual ghoul. He\u2019s a half-turned vampire. He\u2019s the Splenda of vampires. I don\u2019t think he would hurt you just because of his ghoulness. I\u2019m only saying something because of his history. I\u2019m afraid that if you marry him, something\u2019s going to happen to you. I just don\u2019t want anything to happen to you,\u201d I said, realizing that was true as the words left my mouth.</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t always get along, Grandma, but I don\u2019t wish you actual harm.\u201d</p><p>Grandma sniffed. \u201cOh, Janie.\u201d</p><p>The degree of emotional openness triggered some sort of channel into Grandma Ruthie\u2019s psyche. I had brief flashes from her thoughts, like old hand-tinted photos. She was remembering me as a little girl, in a starched pink linen dress, ready to go to church. Handing her a card I\u2019d made for her birthday. And then the images turned to the time I dropped wedding ring number three down her garbage disposal. The disastrous Teeny Tea when I tripped and spilled the contents of my teacup down the front of Mrs. Neel\u2019s Sunday dress. All of the times I embarrassed her. All of the times I disappointed.</p><p>It was no wonder I\u2019d let something like this happen to me, she was thinking. It was just the capstone to a life dedicated to embarrassing my family. If my mother had listened to her, Grandma Ruthie thought, and sent me to that reform school in New Mexico, I would have married some long-distance truck driver by now and disappeared.</p><p>\u201cWell, everyone has problems, Jane,\u201d Grandma said, giving Wilbur a long appraising look.</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014but\u2014ghoul!\u201d I sputtered.</p><p>Wilbur snorted. \u201cOh, and you\u2019re all so noble. Vampires walking around all more powerful than thou. As if you don\u2019t have all the same weaknesses as us halfsies. Well, I got news for you, missy. Back in my day, vampires knew their place in the world, underground. I think it\u2019s time I dished out some tough love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you serious?\u201d I asked.</p><p>Wilbur cocked his fist like an Atlantic City pier boxer. \u201cTime to put your money where you big, fanged mouth is, Jane.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to hit you,\u201d I told him. \u201cBesides, don\u2019t you have any old-fashioned rules about not hitting girls?\u201d</p><p>Wilbur circled me, throwing practice swings. \u201cThe way I figure it, you stopped being a girl a while ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo did Grandma.\u201d I threw my hands toward my grandmother. \u201cBesides, you can\u2019t fight me, old man. You don\u2019t have vampire strength.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but I do have this,\u201d he said, pulling the handle off his cane and revealing a hidden stake.</p><p>\u201cWilbur!\u201d Grandma Ruthie cried. \u201cWhat on earth do you think you\u2019re doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, come on, who hides a stake in their cane? What\u2019s next? Are you going to make nunchakus out of your dentures?\u201d I yelled.</p><p>\u201cWilbur, don\u2019t you dare!\u201d Grandma cried.</p><p>Wilbur flew at me, a surprisingly spry ball of geriatric fury. I managed to grab the hand with the stake and turn so I wouldn\u2019t land on top of him as we fell to the floor. Both for the safety of his hip and my own mental well-being.</p><p>Unfortunately, Wilbur took advantage of this and rolled over me, his rank feta breath making my eyes water. I watched as yellowed, crooked fangs extended from Wilbur\u2019s canines, a long string of drool stretching between his jaws. I pressed my head back against the tiled floor to try to put as much distance between our faces as possible. Faintly, I heard my dad yelling, my mother crying, and the dull thud of my sister passing out and sliding to the floor.</p><p>\u201cThis is my family now, Jane,\u201d Wilbur hissed, his wiry peppercorn eyebrows furrowing as he tried to force the stake from my hand. \u201cAnd in my family, we don\u2019t tolerate sassy mouths.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet off of me, you crazy ... old ... man!\u201d I grunted. It took all of the strength in my legs to kick up and launch him into the refrigerator. Wilbur landed in a heap, his neck making a sickening crunch as his head skidded across the tile.</p><p>\u201cWilbur!\u201d Grandma screamed. \u201cJane! What did you do?\u201d</p><p>I hauled myself to my feet, cracking my own vertebrae back into place as my family stared in horror at Wilbur\u2019s lifeless body. Their silent shock was palpable. Mama was sobbing quietly as she frantically tried to revive an unconscious Jenny. Daddy moved toward Wilbur, then stumbled back on his rear when Wilbur\u2019s eyes sprang open. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThat was entirely unnecessary, young lady,\u201d Wilbur snarled, rolling to his knees and cracking his neck as the bones healed. Mama cried out and wobbled against the table legs. Wilbur pushed to his feet and sneered at me. \u201cYou have no respect for your elders.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess the respectful thing would be just standing there and letting you stake me in my own kitchen.\u201d I tossed the offending wooden dagger into the garbage. \u201cAnd by the way, one word, two syllables: Altoid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy, you little\u2014\u201d Wilbur growled. \u201cI won\u2019t stand here and be insulted like this. Ruthie, I\u2019ll call you soon.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, Wilbur, don\u2019t go!\u201d Grandma Ruthie cried as Wilbur stomped out the back door. She turned on me, lip on full tremble. \u201cJane, I want you to go apologize to Wilbur right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? No!\u201d</p><p>Grandma stomped her little foot and pointed me toward the door. \u201cThat man is going to be your grandpa, Jane. You need to make nice.\u201d</p><p>I stared at Grandma. \u201cAre you kidding me? I tell you that he might be the Half-Moon Hollow equivalent to Bluebeard, he attacks me with a stake, and you still want to marry him?\u201d</p><p>Grandma pressed her lips together. \u201cYou know, Jane, if you weren\u2019t so picky, it might be you standing at the altar.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNow, let\u2019s not say something we regret later,\u201d said Mama, who was slowly recovering from Wilbur\u2019s abrupt departure. Jenny, while conscious, still looked a little green around the gills.</p><p>With a sniff in my direction, Grandma Ruthie grabbed her raincoat. \u201cI will not set foot in this house again until you apologize to Wilbur and to me, Jane Enid Jameson.\u201d</p><p>As the door slammed behind her, I yelled, \u201cCan I get that in writing?\u201d</p><p>Jenny stood on wobbly legs and hobbled to the table, where she carefully slipped her tote bag onto her shoulder. \u201cThis is too much for me. I\u2019ll call you later, Mama.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait, Jenny. I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m really sorry. I hate this. I hate feeling this way, not being able to talk to you about anything. Look, there\u2019s been enough emotional ... stuff for one evening. Why don\u2019t you just sit down and, you know, return to a normal color, and we\u2019ll\u2014\u201d I stopped as I jostled the bag on Jenny\u2019s arm and heard a clanking noise. \u201cWhat the? What do you have in here, Jen?\u201d I laughed as Jenny\u2019s eyes grew wide. She clutched at the bag, setting off a series of jangling and clanking.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell do you have in here, Jenny?\u201d I demanded, pulling at the bag.</p> <p>\u201cNone of your business!\u201d Jenny yelled. \u201cIt\u2019s for a class I\u2019m taking.\u201d</p><p>I jerked the bag away from her and looked inside to find a set of porcelain baby cups engraved with our great-grandmother\u2019s initials, a heavy silver pie plate, a brush-and-comb set carved from ivory, and several pieces of lace tatted sometime in the late 1900s. These items had been kept carefully displayed in rooms all over the house. The brush-and-comb set was taken from my own dresser. I stared up at my sister, my chest tight and cold at the shock of her betrayal. \u201cYou\u2019re stealing from me? You went into my room and stole from me? Do you have any idea\u2014I mean, I expect Grandma Ruthie to steal from me, but you? I never thought you\u2019d actually sink that low.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI-it\u2019s not stealing,\u201d Jenny stammered. \u201cI\u2019m just taking a few things that have sentimental value for me. Some of them should be mine, anyway. Grandma Ruthie says\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cGrandma Ruthie doesn\u2019t live here. She doesn\u2019t have any say over what leaves this house and what doesn\u2019t. We just talked about this, Jenny!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI deserve part of my family heritage!\u201d Jenny yelled. \u201cYou couldn\u2019t possibly appreciate all that you have. And you don\u2019t have children to pass it on to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, for goodness sake. You\u2019re right, I can\u2019t pass it along to my children. But guess what? I\u2019m never going to die, which means I will always be around to take care of those precious antiques you\u2019re so enamored of. It also means your kids will never inherit them. And if anything ever happens to me, I\u2019m leaving everything to Zeb!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t!\u201d Jenny gasped.</p><p>\u201cOh, yes, I would.\u201d I laughed. \u201cAnd Zeb never uses coasters.\u201d</p> <p>Jenny screeched, \u201cMama!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow, girls\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop calling us girls, Mama. We\u2019re grown women, and we have real, court-documented problems,\u201d I said. \u201cWill you just suck it up and pick a side, already? Tell Jenny that it\u2019s wrong to steal from me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the one who won\u2019t share!\u201d Jenny yelled, punching my arm.</p><p>\u201cOh, please.\u201d I slapped her shoulder and sent her skidding into the table.</p><p>\u201cI will treat you like grown women when you act like grown women,\u201d Mama said, her voice edging toward hysteria. \u201cAnd I will not pick a side, because you\u2019re both being ridiculous. Now, either kiss and make up or get out of my kitchen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s actually my kitchen,\u201d I reminded her before turning on Jenny. \u201cYou, however, should feel free to get out. You\u2019re not welcome here anymore.\u201d</p><p>Mama squeezed my shoulder. \u201cNow, Jane\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I demanded. \u201cShe\u2019s lucky I\u2019m not calling the cops on her skinny ass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, go ahead and try it.\u201d Jenny pulled her now-empty bag onto her shoulder. \u201cI\u2019m sure the cops will be sympathetic to some deadbeat bloodsucker. They\u2019d probably hand me the keys to the house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJenny,\u201d Mama whispered, shocked at the use of an undead slur.</p><p>\u201cOh, stop it, Mama. stop protecting her. Why can\u2019t we all just say it? Jane\u2019s a filthy, disgusting vampire. She let herself get bitten. If I\u2019d done that, you\u2019d never speak to me again, but because it\u2019s Jane, it\u2019s OK. We all just have to accept it, act like it\u2019s normal. But it\u2019s not normal!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of glue have you been sniffing?\u201d I demanded. \u201cWhat do you mean, accept it? When have you ever\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up, Jane!\u201d Jenny barked. \u201cI don\u2019t ever want to speak to you again. I don\u2019t want you near my boys. I don\u2019t want you coming to my house. If I see you out on the street, I\u2019m going to pretend I don\u2019t know you.\u201d</p><p>Even as the words stung, I set my jaw and shoved open the back door. \u201cWell, you should have had plenty of practice at that by now.\u201d</p><p>Jenny stomped out to her sedan and fumbled with the keys.</p><p>\u201cHere, you forgot this!\u201d I yelled. With red-tinged vision, I hefted the silver pie plate off the table and slung it at the rear window of her car. She shrieked as the glass exploded, shattering with a satisfying symphony of crackles. \u201cIt\u2019s all yours!\u201d</p><p>I slammed the kitchen door, wincing as the silver burns smoked on my hands. At my parents\u2019 horrified expressions, I felt slightly ashamed. I made a halfhearted wave toward the door. \u201cShe started it.\u201d</p><p>20</p><p>Like all couples, were couples will argue. Unfortunately for the males, female weres are much better at holding out for an apology, which leads to groveling.</p><p>\u2014Mating Rituals and Love Customs of the Were</p><p>After so many tours of bridesmaid duty, I didn\u2019t feel I needed to attend wedding rehearsals anymore. I was so, so wrong.</p><p>Zeb and Jolene were marrying in a clearing a respectable distance away from the house but very near the barn. With fairy lights strung in the trees and luminaries in the nearby pond, the night took on a sort of cozy Lord of the Rings quality ... or maybe it was Lord of the Flies.</p><p>The bride\u2019s side was eager to get through the rehearsal as it put them one step closer to eating. The groom\u2019s side was sparse. Mama Ginger had apparently told most of her relatives that the wedding was canceled after Jolene was committed to a hospital for the criminally insane.</p><p>The first surprise of the evening was Dick\u2019s arrival with Andrea on his arm. She looked cool and composed in her floaty dawn-colored sundress, not giving any hint of being held hostage or blackmailed. I could only assume that Dick had finally charmed her into submission. Of course, Dick was still Dick. He wore a vintage \u201cfake tuxedo imprinted on a T-shirt\u201d shirt. But he seemed ecstatically happy as he seated Andrea on the groom\u2019s side and took his place with the gathering bridal party.</p><p>I winked at him. \u201cIt\u2019s good to know that occasionally, love\u2014or relentless, unremitting courtship bordering on harassment\u2014will win out. I take it she\u2019s coming to the wedding, too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think she\u2019s waiting to see how it goes. She said she\u2019d let me know after the dinner,\u201d Dick said. Gabriel snickered, making Dick consider his words. \u201cYou know, it sounds sad when I say it out loud like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, it\u2019s like an audition date. It\u2019s Shakespearean, sacrificing yourself on the altar of dignity,\u201d I assured him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been with hundr\u2014\u201d He shot a speculative look at me. \u201cWell, a lot of women. I like women.\u201d</p><p>\u201cObviously,\u201d Gabriel muttered.</p><p>\u201cI like them. I like the way they dress, the way they smell, the sound of their voices, their laughter. But if a woman doesn\u2019t like me, I\u2019m fine with that. Plenty of fish in the sea,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t know why this one woman\u2019s not liking me has made me crazy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think it\u2019s nice,\u201d I said. \u201cI just wish I was gorgeous with a rare blood type. Then I could make men my bitch puppets.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m no one\u2019s bitch puppet,\u201d he growled.</p><p>\u201cYes, you are.\u201d Gabriel laughed.</p><p>He groaned, scrubbing a hand over his face. \u201cYeah, I am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad Andrea\u2019s giving you a chance. I think you\u2019re just different enough to work. Do I have to give you the \u2018Hurt my friend, and you will wake up with my foot lodged in your nether regions\u2019 speech?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he promised. \u201cBut I think you need to retitle some of your speeches. They\u2019re starting to sound sort of repetitive.\u201d</p><p>I stuck my tongue out at him.</p><p>\u201cNo, thanks, I\u2019m seeing someone,\u201d he snarked.</p><p>A slightly frantic Jolene appeared and arranged us into our marching order. Zeb was calm, even happy, making Jolene laugh as he helped her work out where we would stand and how we would hold our arms. (Seriously, bouquet grip was a five-minute debate.) I hoped that his strange behavior over the last few months had been just cold feet and that now that the wedding was here, he would be the old lovable Zeb again.</p><p>Just as Uncle Creed, the oldest male in Jolene\u2019s pack, who\u2019d been ordained through a mail-order company, was about to run through the ceremony, a rust and blue minivan rolled up to the main house in a cloud of dust.</p><p>An \u201cuh-oh\u201d line formed between Jolene\u2019s brows. \u201cUm, I don\u2019t know who that is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s Eula with the cake!\u201d Mama Ginger trilled.</p><p>Between her family\u2019s open hostility toward Zeb and Mama Ginger\u2019s finding fault with everything from the nautical decorations to the fact that the outdoor wedding site had a dirt floor, Jolene\u2019s last nerve was frayed. I squeezed her shoulder, told her I would take the delivery, and negotiated the yard as best I could in three-inch heels. Smoke rolled out in a choking cloud as Eula opened the back of the van.</p><p>\u201cWhere do you want this?\u201d she asked, without bothering to remove the Marlboro Light dangling from her lip.</p><p>\u201cOh ... no.\u201d Jolene\u2019s cake was an exercise in \u201cyikes.\u201d The icing gleamed greasily, actually oozing essence of Crisco through the cardboard fruit crate Eula was using to cart it around. Jolene had planned to have twisted fondant ropes around the bottom of each tier, which looked like a toddler\u2019s Play-Doh craft. Instead of the subtle hints of navy and ice blue, everything was an electric Cookie Monster shade that must have required most of the bottle of food coloring.</p><p>The tiers were assembled at a forty-degree angle. And the whole thing reeked of cigarette smoke. Jolene crossed the yard and was at my side in a blink. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to want to\u2014\u201d I waved toward the van. Jolene\u2019s jaw dropped as she took in the sight of the cake. \u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>I made a quick exit, because my support as best maid only went so far.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d Zeb asked as he watched Jolene try to absorb the sight of her wedding cake. Mimi followed Jolene\u2019s high-pitched cries to the van, where she had a similar reaction to the cake.</p><p>\u201cShe may be a few minutes,\u201d I told Zeb.</p><p>Zeb watched as Jolene, Mimi, and Eula had a very loud \u201cdiscussion.\u201d \u201cShould I go ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cJane, honey, why don\u2019t you just stand in for her?\u201d Mama Ginger suggested, to Zeb\u2019s horror.</p><p>\u201cMama, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t do that!\u201d Uncle Creed cried.</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t have the rehearsal without the bride,\u201d I insisted.</p><p>\u201cNo, don\u2019t be silly,\u201d Mama Ginger warbled, pushing me into the spot next to Zeb. \u201cThere, that looks so much better anyway! Just like I always said, you and Jane are like two peas in a pod.\u201d</p><p>Zeb\u2019s brow furrowed. He was wearing his \u201ctrying to remember something\u201d expression, or possibly his \u201cI smell something funny\u201d expression. Either way, the way he was looking at me was disquieting. His eyes were unfocused as he stared at me, dazed. \u201cI can\u2019t marry Jolene.\u201d</p><p>Mama Ginger gave a victorious squeal as I spluttered, \u201cS-say what now?\u201d</p><p>Zeb clasped my hands in his, despite my repeated attempts to yank them loose. \u201cI can\u2019t marry Jolene. I can\u2019t live a lie, Jane. I can\u2019t be with anybody but you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>A symphony of gasps and angry growls rippled through the bride\u2019s family. My knees turned to jelly. The wedding party was silent and aghast, besides Gabriel\u2019s shocked \u201cBeg pardon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo no no no no no. You and I have never felt that way about each other,\u201d I said in my slow and deliberate voice. I turned to Gabriel as Zeb kissed the back of my hand. Dick stared at us, slackjawed, unsure whether to laugh or, well, laugh. I asked, \u201cIs it some sort of thrall or whammy? Please tell me it\u2019s a whammy.\u201d</p><p>Zeb wrapped his arms around me, looking into my eyes with a level of tenderness only seen when politicians are publicly apologizing to their wives. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I let this go so far, Jane. Jolene\u2019s a nice girl, but I wanted to get back at you for spending so much time with Gabriel, for not loving me back. We have such a long history together, Janie. Friendship and companionship, that\u2019s what\u2019s going to keep us happy for the rest of our lives. It\u2019s always been you, Janie. You were always the girl I\u2019ve wanted to spend my life with. You were always the girl I wanted waiting for me at the end of the aisle.\u201d</p> <p>This was all starting to sound horribly familiar. Mama Ginger \u201cawwwed\u201d and demanded that Floyd get up and use the disposable camera to record this beautiful moment. Jolene, who had left the Great Cake Debate to investigate why the groom was snuggling up to another woman, cried, \u201cZeb, honey, what the hell are you doing?\u201d</p><p>Lonnie got to his feet and glared at Zeb with a predator\u2019s eye. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on here?\u201d</p><p>Zeb looked pained, panicked, at the sight of his bride-to-be. He pressed his lips together, then blurted, \u201cI can\u2019t do this, Jolene. I can\u2019t. I don\u2019t want to hurt you, but I can\u2019t be with you. I can\u2019t go through with this wedding.\u201d</p><p>Jolene chuckled, looking to me to say that this was all joke. I shook my head, bewildered. \u201cZeb, this isn\u2019t funny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a joke. Jolene, I can\u2019t marry you. This whole thing, it\u2019s wrong.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d Jolene demanded. \u201cI love you!\u201d</p><p>Sweat broke out on Zeb\u2019s forehead as he vomited out the words: \u201cI don\u2019t love you.\u201d</p><p>Jolene let loose a strangled cry as she sank into a chair near her father. If looks could kill, Zeb would be hogtied at Lonnie\u2019s feet with an apple stuffed in his mouth. Mimi wrapped her arms around the distressed bride and murmured soothing sounds into her neck. Behind them, a wall of indignant, insulted werewolf relatives rose to their feet, glowering at Zeb and me with curled lips and bared teeth.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re doing the right thing, Zeb,\u201d Mama Ginger cooed. \u201cI\u2019ve told you from the beginning, this whole wedding has been a mistake.\u201d</p><p>Mimi turned on Mama Ginger and snarled. But Mama Ginger was too wrapped up in her triumph to notice.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get out of here, Jane.\u201d Zeb took my hand and tried to pull me away. Gabriel\u2019s hands clamped around my shoulders as I yanked away.</p> <p>Gabriel\u2019s voice was low and stripped of the barest hint of kindness. \u201cLeave now, Zeb. I don\u2019t think we can protect you if you say much more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure if I want to,\u201d Dick muttered. \u201cEven I have standards.\u201d</p><p>Backing toward his car, Zeb sent Jolene a last sorrowful look. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>Mama Ginger and the rest of the Lavelles were packed up and peeling away from the farm in seconds. Jolene soaked her mother\u2019s shoulder with hoarse, body-wracking sobs. I glared at the girl cousins, who were snickering behind their hands, and wrapped an arm around the bride. \u201cI don\u2019t know what to say.\u201d</p><p>From behind us, I could hear Uncle Luke demanding, \u201cWell, what does she expect?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLuke,\u201d Jolene\u2019s father growled.</p><p>\u201cNo, no, I\u2019ve held my tongue long enough,\u201d Luke said. \u201cIt\u2019s not right, the daughter of our alpha mating outside the pack, marrying herself to some filthy two-foot-walking human. And now he\u2019s done exactly what we all said he would do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, no one talks about my friend that way!\u201d I cried. \u201cHe\u2019s being a bit of a jerk right now, but he\u2019s still my friend.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIf you were a man, I\u2019d slap you until you were spitting those fangs out the left side of your mouth,\u201d Luke snarled.</p><p>\u201cIf you were a man, I\u2019d slap you right back\u2014hey!\u201d I stepped out of the way when he did try to backhand me.</p><p>Without preamble, furry bodies flew at me from all sides. Several of Jolene\u2019s aunts and cousins, wolfed out, leaped onto their uncle\u2019s back. It had nothing to do with me personally. Attacking a guest on pack property was another clan shame. (I needed to start keeping a list.) Their response brought out several uncles and cousins who secretly agreed with Luke\u2019s position and the cousins who were just itching for a good fight. I ducked around a tractor when I saw Lucy, one of the bridesmaid cousins who was still in human form, grab a bottle of Boone\u2019s Farm and clobber Vance over the head.</p><p>\u201cIs this normal?\u201d I yelled to Gabriel over the din.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not abnormal,\u201d he said. \u201cMind your head.\u201d</p><p>I dipped just in time to miss the shattering plastic bomb of Aunt Vonnie\u2019s cherished punch bowl. Vonnie, on seeing this, howled with rage, wolfed out, and went after the unfortunate uncle who had tossed it. Gabriel and I crawled under a table, where Dick had already dragged Andrea to relative safety.</p><p>\u201cWhat do we do?\u201d I asked. \u201cCall the cops? Get a bunch of rolled-up newspapers?\u201d</p><p>Gabriel covered me against the shrapnel from a thrown hurricane lamp. \u201cDo you really think introducing police to the mix will improve the situation?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood point,\u201d I said, ducking the flying tissue-paper bells.</p><p>\u201cI say we wait it out,\u201d he said, handing me a little flask.</p><p>\u201cWhat if Jolene gets a black eye for her wedding photos?\u201d Andrea asked in a slightly addled voice.</p><p>\u201cI think when the groom walks out of the wedding rehearsal, the last thing the bride has to worry about is pretty pictures,\u201d Dick said.</p><p>\u201cWow,\u201d Andrea marveled as Jolene hefted a tractor tire over her head and launched it at her uncle Tom.</p><p>\u201cWell, she\u2019s pretty worked up,\u201d I said. \u201cAnd she\u2019s got all that werewolf strength. I just can\u2019t believe Zeb did this. This isn\u2019t him. He loves Jolene. He doesn\u2019t have the kind of heart that just stops loving.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel nodded. \u201cIt\u2019s different now, stronger. It\u2019s as if his thoughts are ... filtered. Some of them are not his own. Have you noticed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI try not to look into my friends\u2019 heads. You tend to find out things that upset you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you we\u2019d have an unforgettable evening,\u201d Dick said, elbowing Andrea.</p><p>\u201cYes. I think I won\u2019t be able to forget this, no matter how much medication I\u2019m prescribed.\u201d Andrea winced as she downed a glass of room-temperature \u201cFuzzy Navel\u201d\u2013flavored wine.</p><p>\u201cFive bucks says Papa McClaine takes Vance out with a farm implement of some type,\u201d Dick offered in an effort to lighten the mood.</p><p>\u201cTen says he uses his bare fangs,\u201d Gabriel countered.</p><p>I separated their shaking hands. \u201cUh-uh, you two are just now talking again. No betting. Besides, shouldn\u2019t we go after Zeb?\u201d</p><p>After the dust (and potato salad) had been cleared, Jolene was left sitting on a broken picnic table in an empty clearing. And she was naked again. That could not be sanitary.</p><p>\u201cOh, honey.\u201d I clutched her close to me (after I\u2019d wrapped her in a stray tablecloth).</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand what happened.\u201d Jolene sniffled. \u201cEverythin\u2019 was so perfect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think Zeb could be usin\u2019 drugs?\u201d I asked. Jolene stared at me. \u201cOK, it\u2019s not exactly within the realm of his character, but I would guess \u2018hard-core crack smoker\u2019 way before \u2018idiot who dumped the love of his life at the altar.\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think I\u2019m the love of his life?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I do. Who else would it be? It sure the hell isn\u2019t me. What do you think made Zeb ... just what the heck happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cZeb hasn\u2019t been right in months. It\u2019s little things. But I never thought\u2014I never thought he would do somethin\u2019 like this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know all that stuff Zeb was saying, that was just crazy talk, right? Zeb doesn\u2019t really love me. It was as if he had some sort of dissociative episode or started channeling Mama Ginger or something. Maybe he just got cold feet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Zeb I love would not have cold feet. He was excited about getting married. How could someone just change like that? Maybe I should have married my cousin Vance, like Uncle Luke said.\u201d Jolene paled. \u201cI\u2019ve got to call everythin\u2019 off. I\u2019m goin\u2019 to have to call two hundred of my relatives and tell them the weddin\u2019s off. And all that food! And the little mints. And the iceberg! What am I goin\u2019 to do with a thirty-foot Styrofoam iceberg?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat were you going to do with it after the wedding?\u201d I asked. She glared at me through her tears. \u201cLook, let\u2019s just hold off on canceling anything. All of the food, the drinks, everything will keep for two days, right? You just sit tight for the rest of the weekend. Don\u2019t make any decisions or announcements. Give me two days. If by Sunday I do not have a willing and groveling groom kneeling at your feet, then I will help you sink that dang Styrofoam iceberg.\u201d</p><p>Jolene chewed her lip.</p><p>\u201cHe loves you, Jolene. He\u2019s never loved anybody in his whole life the way he loves you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwo days,\u201d she agreed. \u201cNow I just have to keep my family from killin\u2019 him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat would help, yes.\u201d</p><p>21</p><p>One who objects at a werewolf wedding risks serious injuries.</p><p>\u2014Mating Rituals and Love Customs of the Were</p><p>After talking a half-dozen very angry werewolf males out of hunting down my best friend like a rabid raccoon, I drove to the Lavelles\u2019 house and sat out in the driveway. I had to talk to Mama Ginger. Emboldened by her meddling success, she would be impossible to deal with. I would be lucky if I didn\u2019t end up shot with a tranquilizer dart and carted off to a Vegas wedding chapel.</p><p>I found her sitting on her sun porch, on an old musty couch, chewing her nails. Mama Ginger never chewed her nails. She said the hands were the front window of a girl\u2019s \u201cshop,\u201d and you couldn\u2019t attract a man with a messy front window. \u201cMama Ginger?\u201d</p><p>She turned, and I saw actual tear tracks on her cheek. She seemed so small and deflated, with her clean, bare face and her hair tucked into a ponytail. \u201cOh, Janie, are you here to see Zeb?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, actually, Mama Ginger, I\u2019m here to see you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, whatever for? Honey, my boy already said everything he needed to say.\u201d She sniffed and gave me a weary smile. \u201cYou two need to talk all this over, get your heads together. We have a wedding to plan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Mama Ginger, we need to talk about why Zeb said those things in the first place. Things that sounded an awful lot like the things you\u2019ve been saying. I don\u2019t know what you did to Zeb to make him do that, but you need to tell me. Because whatever you did ruined Zeb\u2019s and Jolene\u2019s lives.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not true!\u201d Mama Ginger cried, her voice cracking. I grabbed her chin and forced her to meet my gaze. I didn\u2019t want to have to use the persuasion voice on her, but I would. Finally, tears welled at the corners of her eyes, and she whispered, \u201cZeb\u2019s curled up in bed, practically in a damn coma. He refuses to say a word.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis brain\u2019s probably gone into shock, Mama Ginger. You can\u2019t mess around with someone\u2019s subconscious, make them do something that is fundamentally opposed to their heart\u2019s desire, and not expect there to be side effects.\u201d</p><p>She wailed, \u201cIt wasn\u2019t supposed to be like this. He wasn\u2019t supposed to be so\u2014a mother knows when her child is hurting, Jane. And he\u2019s just so miserable. And I did that.\u201d</p><p>In the years I\u2019d known her, Mama Ginger had never expressed remorse. A change in heart this dramatic must have been killing her. I found small comfort in that.</p><p>\u201cI never meant any harm,\u201d she whimpered. \u201cI was just trying to make sure Zeb was happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut he was happy, with Jolene. She made him very happy. And you can fix this. You just have to tell me what you did to make Zeb say all those things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut he wants you, Jane. You heard him. He wants to be with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, he doesn\u2019t. I know that you want him to want me. We both know what he really wants.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I\u2019ve spent so much time\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve spent a lot of time and energy trying to fulfill the vision you had of our future. But the future you want, marriage and babies, it\u2019s not possible. I can\u2019t have babies, Mama Ginger. I\u2019m a vampire.\u201d</p><p>Blanching a lovely shade of ecru, Mama Ginger gasped and clapped a hand over her throat. \u201cBut you\u2019re so, so\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNormal? Yes, but I\u2019m also a bloodsucking creature of the night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe this. You\u2019re just saying this to keep me from wanting you to marry Zeb!\u201d she cried, stumbling back and tripping over a lawn chair.</p><p>\u201cWell, you\u2019re not wrong, but it\u2019s still true.\u201d I reached for her hand to help her up. \u201cI\u2019m a vampire. I have been for almost a year now. And you didn\u2019t notice, because you tend not to pay attention when people evolve or change. Zeb and I are no longer the six-year-olds who played house. I\u2019m not dangerous. Not to Zeb and not to you. But the bright side is that while I can never, ever bear you grandchildren, Jolene can have all the kids she and Zeb want. In fact, there\u2019s every chance that they\u2019re going to have a huge family.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cGrandbabies?\u201d She sighed.</p><p>\u201cYeah, grandbabies\u2014beautiful, strong, most likely very athletic grandbabies. But first we have to fix Zeb so he can apologize to Jolene, profusely, and they can get married.\u201d</p><p>Mama Ginger sighed, twisting a Kleenex into complex tornado shapes. \u201cI took Zeb to Madame Zelda and told him it was for his headaches. It was stress relief, I told him. Madame Zelda could use hypnosis and suggestive imagery to put him in a better state of mind. Every time he told Jolene he was coming over here to do chores, I was taking him to Zelda. She\u2019s spent weeks planting thoughts in his head. Bad stuff about Jolene. Good stuff about you. I made her tell him that you were the only girl he could possibly marry, that you were the only one who could make him happy. That he should be more aggressive with you and let you know how he feels. Zelda fixed it so every time Zeb heard you say the word \u2018wedding,\u2019 he would do something to hurt Jolene\u2019s feelings or make a pass at you. And he wouldn\u2019t remember doing it later.\u201d</p> <p>In my head, I ran over the conversations that had preceded Zeb\u2019s bizarre behavior. In all of them, we\u2019d been talking about the wedding in some capacity. Considering that we\u2019d been planning Zeb\u2019s wedding, that was natural, inevitable. Mama Ginger had set out a minefield for us. \u201cWhat makes you think you have the right to do this stuff, Mama Ginger? Do you have any idea how crazy this is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just wanted everyone to be happy!\u201d she yelled. \u201cWe weren\u2019t even sure it was working because Zeb was being so resistant. But he kept coming back. Zelda fixed it so he wouldn\u2019t remember anything except the thoughts she put in the back of his brain. We just couldn\u2019t get him to dump her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause in his heart and his head, he loves Jolene,\u201d I told her. \u201cHe was rude to her a few times, said some really hurtful things. He slapped me on the butt in front of my vampire boyfriend, which put him in serious peril\u2014oh, yeah, Gabriel and Dick are vampires, too. But Jolene loves him so much, she forgave him for all of that. So you had to do something bigger.\u201d</p><p>Mama Ginger blushed and wiped the mascara streaks from her cheeks. \u201cZelda fixed it so as soon he heard someone say \u2018peas in a pod,\u2019 he would tell Jolene he didn\u2019t want to marry her. He\u2019d repeat all the things that we\u2019d been planting in his head.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, if there\u2019s a trigger keyword, there has to be a release keyword, right? What is it?\u201d</p> <p>Mama Ginger flushed. \u201cShe didn\u2019t tell me. I only paid half up front. She wouldn\u2019t give me the release word until I paid the rest.\u201d I stared at her. She shrugged. \u201cI wanted to make sure it worked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, pay her the rest!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI tried. Earlier tonight, I called her and told her I wanted to call it off, that my son was miserable and she had to take everything back. I may have used some words she didn\u2019t like.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuch as?\u201d</p><p>Mama Ginger sniffled. \u201cCrackpot ... crazy old coot ... buck-toothed hag.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you stop to think maybe it wasn\u2019t a great idea to use your special brand of phone manners on the person who has access to your son\u2019s subconscious?\u201d</p> <p>Mama Ginger was sobbing in earnest now, which meant she would be no further help.</p><p>\u201cSo I need to track down a psychic who specializes in hypnosis and mind-control techniques to try to wrestle information out of her?\u201d</p><p>Mama Ginger nodded pitifully.</p><p>\u201cGreat.\u201d</p><p>After persuading Mama Ginger not to move Zeb or further scramble his brain, I followed her soggy directions to Madame Zelda\u2019s \u201cparlor front\u201d shop on Gaines Street. Madame Zelda lived in a one-story \u201cshotgun\u201d-style house with peeling green paint and a giant plywood hand advertising five-dollar palm readings.</p><p>I rang the doorbell, and after some audible shuffling inside, I was greeted by a little old wrinkled lady wearing a fringed purple shawl, a long Indian-print skirt, and a smoky topaz ring the size of a door knocker. Her eyes were heavily kohled. And suddenly, my weird encounter with Esther Barnes made sense.</p><p>\u201cHi, Ms. Barnes,\u201d I said, smiling sweetly.</p><p>\u201cI am Madame Zelda,\u201d Esther said in a deep, obviously fake Transylvanian accent while she waved me into the parlor. Her house smelled of yesterday\u2019s fried chicken and overbrewed coffee. Her \u201coffice\u201d looked exactly how you would expect a five-dollar psychic to decorate: beaded curtains, stinky candles, busy fabrics, and creepy angel figurines. \u201cI do not know this Ms. Barnes of whom you speak.\u201d</p> <p>She gestured for me to sit at a tiny tea table covered in a sari, with a laughably large crystal ball in the middle. \u201cThat\u2019s funny. You look so much like a lady who came into the bookshop where I work. I must be mistaken.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIndeed,\u201d she intoned. \u201cHow may I be of service?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you\u2019ve been helping a friend of mine with some \u2018headaches.\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cI help many people,\u201d she said, her lips tightening so that I could see the carmine-colored lipstick feathering even further into the tiny lines around her mouth.</p><p>\u201cWell, this is a special case. See, he came in, thinking he was going to get your two-hundred-dollar six-session stress treatment and tarot reading. And instead, he ended up brainwashed into thinking he was in love with someone other than his bride-to-be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou!\u201d she growled, the venom in her voice killing off the fake accent, turning her voice thin and brassy once more. \u201cYou\u2019re that \u2018Jane\u2019 she just won\u2019t shut up about. If I had to hear one more time how wonderful you are, how many beautiful grandbabies you were going to make, I was going to throw up. Wait, wait!\u201d Suddenly, she burst out laughing. Carefully wiping her lined eyes, she hooted, \u201cGinger doesn\u2019t know you\u2019re a vampire, does she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot until recently.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, that\u2019s priceless!\u201d she cried. \u201cAll this time, she was plottin\u2019 to get her boy away from a perfectly nice girl and hand him over to a vampire! Oh, you\u2019ve made my day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I do what I can,\u201d I said flatly as she lit a long brown cigarillo. \u201cThe thing is, Zeb\u2019s wedding was ruined because of that crap you put in his head. Having some experience in the psychic arena, I recognize that you\u2019ve got some serious chops. I mean, whatever you did to me at the shop was impressive. My ears were ringing for hours.\u201d A faint flush of pride spread across her furrowed cheeks. \u201cNow, look, Mama Ginger still owes you a hundred dollars. I\u2019m willing to pay you five hundred so we can settle this whole thing without any hard feelings. All you have to do is hold up your end of the deal and give me the release keyword.\u201d</p><p>She pursed her lips. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean, no?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t do it for any amount of money.\u201d She sniffed. \u201cGinger Lavelle insulted me personally and professionally. And she\u2019s a giant pain in the ass. I don\u2019t want to have anything to do with her. She deserves whatever she gets.\u201d She settled her gaze on me, and in a voice that reverberated inside my skull, she said, \u201cNow, go away.\u201d</p><p>Fortunately, I was prepared for the psychic smacking, so while her efforts stung a little, they didn\u2019t do a lot of damage. I shook my head. She seemed stunned by my lack of reaction. \u201cThat was rude. I came to you in good faith. And Mama Ginger isn\u2019t suffering, her son is. Look, I know she\u2019s a pain in the ass. It\u2019s part of her charm. And if some insulted part of you feels the need to track her down and hypnotize her into thinking she\u2019s a chicken or a nudist or something, I will be more than willing to look the other way. Hell, I might pay you extra to do it. I\u2019ll consider it a wedding present for a deeply hurt daughter-in-law.\u201d</p><p>I backed her against the parlor wall and let my fangs fully extend. \u201cI don\u2019t want to hurt you. But for my friend, I will do anything it takes to get that keyword. You might reconsider\u2014ow!\u201d</p><p>She had reached into a side table and pulled out a silver cross large enough to make me break out in hives. \u201cSilly little vampire, I\u2019ve seen inside you. You don\u2019t have the stomach for killing. You can\u2019t even feed on humans without torturing yourself over it. You wouldn\u2019t hurt a little old lady like me.\u201d</p><p>Wheezing and scratching the blisters forming on my arms, I spat, \u201cLook, lady, I\u2019ve got twenty-four hours to dewhammy my best friend and get him to the altar. Otherwise, he may never leave his parents\u2019 guest room again. I wouldn\u2019t overestimate the depth of my kindness. And I brought something you didn\u2019t count on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGloves.\u201d I slipped the black Isotoners out of my pocket and slapped the cross out of her hands. \u201cAnd my big mean sire. Gabriel!\u201d</p><p>Gabriel swept into the room, followed by a slightly less sweepy Dick.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the plan?\u201d Dick asked, rubbing his hands together and checking the room for valuables. \u201cCarnage? Bedlam? Fisticuffs?\u201d</p><p>Gabriel smiled solicitously and waved a hand toward Esther. Dick rolled his eyes. \u201cDang it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I asked as Dick sidled up to the trembling old woman.</p><p>Gabriel snickered as he looked over the fading blisters on my arms. \u201cHaven\u2019t you ever wondered about the nature of Dick\u2019s vampiric gift?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI figured it was dodging collection agents or slipping out of handcuffs.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel grinned as Dick soothingly stroked a resistant Esther\u2019s papery hands and led her to a sofa. He fetched a glass of water and cooed over her as she recovered from the \u201cshock\u201d of having three strange vampires in her home. \u201cDick can reach the heart of any woman. Through a combination of pheromones, subliminal persuasion, and old-fashioned charm, he can get anything he wants from them\u2014money, favors, certain keywords that will help unlock your best friend\u2019s brain ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis special vampire power is flirty manipulation? Wait, he\u2019s not doing that to Andrea, is he? Because that\u2019s ... icky.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, he rarely uses it. He hates lowering himself to it, really. So, his doing this shows you how much he likes Zeb. Using his gift doesn\u2019t seem sporting to him. And if anything, Dick adores the chase.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know if I can watch this,\u201d I said, shaking my head in disgust as Dick clasped Esther\u2019s hands against his manly chest. She was already making cow eyes at him. \u201cKeep Dick away from my grandma.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow, Esther\u2014I can call you, Esther, can\u2019t I?\u201d Dick chuckled, giving her a saucy, intimate grin. \u201cIt seems like such a shame for you to go by any name but that of one of the most famous queens in history.\u201d</p><p>As Esther giggled coquettishly, I felt a little ill. \u201cThis is not right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut extremely effective,\u201d Gabriel conceded. \u201cAnd you don\u2019t have the guilt of assaulting a senior citizen hanging over your conscience.\u201d</p><p>Dick stroked Esther\u2019s hands as he pleaded his case, his flashing green eyes drawing her closer across the love seat. \u201cEsther, honey, I don\u2019t blame you for being mad at that awful Ginger Lavelle. She\u2019s a horrible woman, and I personally can\u2019t stand the sight of her, but her son is such a nice boy. He doesn\u2019t deserve this kind of hurt. Now, you\u2019ve got a good heart, Esther. Anyone can see that. You don\u2019t want to break up true love, do you? Why don\u2019t you go ahead and give me the keywords?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just said the exact same thing,\u201d I complained. \u201cThat\u2019s never going to\u2014oh, come on.\u201d Gabriel smirked as Esther whispered the words \u201clike peas and carrots\u201d into Dick\u2019s ear.</p><p>I snorted. \u201cWhat is your obsession with peas?\u201d</p><p>She ignored me as Dick kissed both her palms and her cheeks.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re square, right?\u201d I asked the nonresponsive geriatric psychic. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to come back in a year and use some secret word to make him divorce Jolene and join the Krishnas or something. Hello?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAw, Esther wouldn\u2019t do that, now, would you?\u201d Dick cooed.</p><p>\u201cDick, eventually, your thrall will wear out,\u201d I reminded him quietly.</p><p>\u201cI looked over her brain. There are no other words. Esther doesn\u2019t much like to put in extra work, do you, sweetheart?\u201d Dick kissed the top of her scarved head.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Esther giggled. \u201cI\u2019m sorry for the misunderstanding, Jane. Will I see you again, Dick?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe you will, maybe not.\u201d Dick smirked.</p><p>\u201cOh, please come by,\u201d she wheedled. \u201cCome back and see me.\u201d</p><p>Dick merely grinned and ushered us out the door.</p><p>\u201cWell, I learned more about you, which is always disturbing.\u201d I wrapped a purely platonic arm around him. \u201cYou are a very bad man, and I hope you\u2019re always on my side.\u201d</p><p>Zeb was not the depressive type, so it was disconcerting to see him in full Howard Hughes mode, ensconced in his mother\u2019s guest room, also known as her Precious Moments display area. The walls were lined with shelves where carefully arranged figurines stayed perfectly preserved in their plastic viewing boxes. As far as the eye could see, there were towheaded, large-pupiled children forever frozen while cavorting in adorable pastel rain slickers. Huddled under a pink chenille comforter, Zeb stared blankly at the wall.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like this place,\u201d Dick whispered after Floyd had let us into the house and flopped back into his easy chair without comment. Mama Ginger had taken to her bed. \u201cIt\u2019s like all the little eyes follow you around the room. This is a bad place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, it wasn\u2019t upsetting before, but it is now.\u201d Gabriel grimaced as he recoiled from the plush Precious Moments angel that recited the Lord\u2019s Prayer when squeezed. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cZeb,\u201d I whispered, shaking his shoulder. \u201cZeb, we\u2019re here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s going to do the honors?\u201d Dick asked. \u201cI think unscrambling the groom\u2019s brain is a man-of-honor duty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I think I should do it,\u201d Gabriel insisted. \u201cI have the most experience sifting through human brains.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt sounds gross when you say it like that,\u201d I told him. \u201cAnd none of us is going to do this. I made a call on the way over.\u201d</p><p>We heard Floyd open the front door and grunt. Jolene stepped through the bedroom door. Ignoring the sinister surroundings, her eyes welled up at the sight of her stone-silent fianc\u00e9. She curled up against his back and stroked his shoulders, nuzzling the curve of his neck with her nose. \u201cZeb, honey, it\u2019s me.\u201d</p><p>Zeb\u2019s arms trembled, but his gaze stayed fixed on the wall.</p><p>\u201cOur friends told me what happened, that what you did wasn\u2019t your fault. I love you, Zeb. And I forgive you. And I want you to snap out of it so we can have our wedding. We\u2019re like peas and carrots, Zeb. We\u2019re different, but we belong together. Did you hear me? Like peas and carrots.\u201d</p><p>Like a fairy-tale prince released from a spell, Zeb gingerly flexed his fingers and closed them around Jolene\u2019s hand. He took a deep breath and said, \u201cI\u2019m so sorry.\u201d</p> <p>Gabriel\u2019s arm slipped around me as the pair of them sat up in bed and threw their arms around each other.</p><p>\u201cJolene, I\u2019m sorry,\u201d Zeb said, his lips trembling. \u201cIt was horrible. I felt like a puppet. My lips were moving, but someone else was talking and I couldn\u2019t stop those things from coming out of my mouth. I didn\u2019t mean any of it. And afterward, I just didn\u2019t want to live without you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShhh.\u201d She chuckled, kissing his neck. \u201cYou can spend the rest of our lives making it up to me. Starting with brushing your teeth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour family,\u201d he groaned. \u201cThey\u2019re going to kill me this time, aren\u2019t they?\u201d</p><p>Jolene shook her head. \u201cMama and Daddy calmed them down for the most part. Vance still wants to kick your ass, but I don\u2019t think that will ever change. They are, however, pretty ticked off at your mama, so she should probably expect a cold shoulder tomorrow night at the reception.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou still want to marry me?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019d marry you right now in this bed surrounded by these creepy little dolls, if you asked me to,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t ask her to,\u201d Dick begged. \u201cI\u2019d like to get out of here.\u201d</p><p>Zeb smiled up at us as Jolene cuddled his neck. \u201cThanks, guys.\u201d</p><p>I grinned. \u201cWhat are the man of honor and the best maid for?\u201d</p><p>Mama Ginger appeared in the doorway, her eyes puffy and red. Tired, timid, and contrite, she was wearing her old blue housecoat, a bundle of wet Kleenex pouched in the pocket.</p><p>Jolene got to her feet and crossed to her with deliberate steps. \u201cIt\u2019s goin\u2019 to take a long, long ... really long time for me to totally forgive you for this. We\u2019re not goin\u2019 to have the kind of relationship the two of us would have wanted. You\u2019ll have to earn your way into being welcome at our house. But I love your son, and I\u2019m goin\u2019 to spend the rest of my life trying to make him happy. If that means the two of us being civil to each other, that\u2019s what we\u2019re goin\u2019 to do. Got it?\u201d</p><p>Mama Ginger nodded meekly and stepped out of Jolene\u2019s way.</p><p>Jolene blew Zeb a kiss. \u201cI\u2019ll see you tomorrow night, honey. I\u2019ll be the one up front wearin\u2019 the white dress.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCan I still come to the wedding?\u201d Mama Ginger asked in a sad, humble little voice.</p><p>Zeb stood and, for the first time in his life, talked sternly to his mother. \u201cYou can come, Mama, but you\u2019re going to be nice. You\u2019re going to be sweet as pie to Jolene and her family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut Zeb\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSweet as pie,\u201d Zeb repeated.</p><p>\u201cBut I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cGinger, just shut up!\u201d Beer in hand, Floyd stomped into the room and wagged his finger in Mama Ginger\u2019s face. \u201cYou\u2019ve talked enough for the both of us over the years. And I\u2019m going to be speaking up a little more often. You\u2019re going to be on your best behavior tomorrow. You\u2019ll tell that girl how nice her dress looks. You\u2019ll say nice things about the food, the decorations, and anything else that catches your eye. You will offer to help in any way you can, even if it means sweeping out the chicken coop. You will apologize to Jolene\u2019s family for how you\u2019ve acted so far, and you will do your damnedest to make up for it over the next couple of years.\u201d</p><p>Zeb and I gaped at his father in shock. It was the most words either of us had heard him string together since he dropped a carburetor on his foot in 1989.</p><p>\u201cFloyd Lavelle, you\u2019ve never spoken to me like this in your whole life.\u201d Mama Ginger sniffled, her lip trembling. Apparently, her guilt only went so deep.</p><p>\u201cThen it\u2019s time that I started,\u201d Floyd said. He strode out of the room after slapping Mama Ginger on the butt. \u201cNow, everybody keep quiet. I\u2019m trying to watch the damn game!\u201d</p><p>Zeb grinned. \u201cI\u2019m going to take a shower. I\u2019m getting married tomorrow!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know how to take all this,\u201d Mama Ginger said, wringing a Kleenex around her fingers.</p><p>\u201cWell, I would plan on swallowing a big slice of humble pie, Mama Ginger.\u201d I patted her arm and led Dick and Gabriel out of the room. \u201cMaybe two.\u201d</p><p>22</p><p>A traditional werewolf wedding reception does not include a receiving line. They are unnecessary as 90 percent of the guest list consists of the happy couple\u2019s immediate family members.</p><p>\u2014Mating Rituals and Love Customs of the Were</p><p>It was a traditional Southern wedding.</p><p>The bride was beautiful, of course. The ceremony was held outdoors under the full moon. The spring air was warm and soft. The bridesmaids were dressed like those crocheted dolls people use to disguise toilet-paper rolls.</p><p>Jolene had chosen \u201cNearer My God to Thee\u201d as the processional, because she\u2019d read that was what the band on the Titanic played. As I led the charge of like-dressed puffballs, I took time to look for familiar faces in the crowd.</p><p>Mama Ginger was up front, wearing a completely appropriate and demure cornflower-blue mother-of-the-groom\u2019s dress. Her slightly deflated appearance had far more to do with the fact that she\u2019d spent most of the day tying tiny bows around the chocolate anchor favors than any lack of enthusiasm on her part. After a severe dressing down from the alpha couple, most of Jolene\u2019s family were equally meek and made a grand effort to pull together and create Jolene\u2019s dream wedding. By the time the vampire wedding-party members arrived early that evening, the air had a certain \u201cLet\u2019s put on a show!\u201d quality to it. Jolene\u2019s female cousins were using their werewolf agility to hang twinkle lights and hurricane lamps from precarious branches. The uncles cleared the riot debris and set up the altar. Uncle Luke, who was quite repentant, spent the afternoon attaching an outboard motor to the mysterious Styrofoam iceberg. And of course, the aunts did what they did best: cooked a feast. There was a huge spread occupying three full-length picnic tables with every kind of roast animal you could imagine, plus casseroles, grits, and congealed salads.</p><p>And in a beautiful gesture of familial unity, Raylene managed to pull together a gorgeous ice-blue four-tier wedding cake with a little fondant Jolene and Zeb atop a fake iceberg topper. And nothing on the cake looked anything like a penis. It was Raylene\u2019s cake masterpiece.</p><p>Even over the rather maudlin processional, my vampire superhearing picked up Zeb saying to Gabriel at the altar, \u201cI feel the need to mention that, well, I love you guys. Even if you did vamp out my best friend, Gabriel, you\u2019re a really good guy. And Dick, I really appreciate you hitting on that old lady to unscramble my brain. I\u2019m sorry I\u2019ve been such a jerk lately.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel slapped Zeb on the back. \u201cI don\u2019t have many friends, Zeb. But you\u2019re certainly the best among them.\u201d</p><p>The two men smiled at each other. A moment of silence passed.</p><p>Zeb cleared his throat. \u201cAnd, uh, sorry about slapping Jane on the butt. That won\u2019t happen again.\u201d</p><p>Another silent, slightly more uncomfortable moment.</p><p>\u201cWell, this is awkward,\u201d Dick muttered.</p><p>Zeb nodded. \u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel grinned as I passed the end of the aisle and took my spot. True to his word, he was dashing in formal wear, a cutaway tux with old-fashioned four-in-hand tie. I would wonder how long he\u2019d had it, but I think the answer would upset me.</p><p>The ceremony was short and to the point, which may have had something to do with werewolves\u2019 generally short attention span and an upcoming meal. There was no mention of \u201cIf anyone here present knows of any lawful impediment,\u201d which was in no way unintentional. There were no unity candles and, mercifully, no solos.</p><p>The happy couple marched out to \u201cRaise the Titanic,\u201d which was oddly dark considering the proceedings. Zeb and Jolene boarded the iceberg while one of Jolene\u2019s teen cousins manned the tiller. They made a blessedly slow progression across the pond while Zeb stood behind Jolene, stretching out their arms and screaming, \u201cI\u2019m king of the world!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI really should have seen that coming,\u201d I told Dick as we paired up at the altar and headed down the aisle.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think anyone could have seen that coming,\u201d Dick told me. We were ushered straight to the reception tables as Zeb and Jolene de-berged.</p><p>Gabriel\u2019s smile could not be contained as he bent over my hand and kissed it. \u201cYou\u2019re a vision.\u201d</p><p>I narrowed my eyes at him. \u201cLike the kind you see after a healthy dose of peyote?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you know, it sort of looks like something some of the more promiscuous girls might have worn in my day,\u201d Gabriel said.</p><p>\u201cOn what planet is that a compliment?\u201d I demanded as Dick laughed.</p><p>After a completely unnecessary number of photos, I pulled the happy couple aside and pulled an envelope out of a pocket in my skirt. (Oh, yeah, the \u201cRuffles and Dreams\u201d came with pockets.)</p><p>\u201cI have something for you,\u201d I said. \u201cIt\u2019s not six hundred dollars\u2019 worth of pots and pans, but I think you\u2019ll like it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve already done enough, Janie,\u201d Zeb assured me.</p><p>Nonetheless, I handed Jolene an envelope. She raised an eyebrow at the paper contained within. \u201cIt\u2019s a deed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo a piece of land about halfway between Gabriel\u2019s place and mine, in the back fifty acres. There\u2019s also a check in there to cover the construction costs of a brand-new house.\u201d</p><p>And that, combined with estimated costs of renovating and restocking the shop, would still leave me with quite a bit of money, which was disconcerting. I now felt the need actually to do something for myself but had no idea what that might be. It was like being held hostage by a retirement plan.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s really sweet,\u201d Zeb said. \u201cBut we just got out of a situation where we felt obligated\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t owe me anything. It\u2019s a gift.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe would really like to make our own way,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cFine. Give me a dollar,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust give me a dollar,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t really think of putting my wallet in these pants,\u201d he said.</p><p>Dick rolled his eyes and fished out his own wallet, an exact replica of Jules Winnfield\u2019s from Pulp Fiction.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never seen you so eager to give away money,\u201d Gabriel told Dick.</p><p>\u201cI want in,\u201d Dick said. \u201cAll I got them was one of those George Foreman grills.\u201d</p><p>Dick handed the bill to Zeb, who handed it over to me. In return, I handed him the envelope. \u201cThere, you have just purchased a plot of my land for one dollar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cZeb,\u201d I said in a warning tone.</p><p>\u201cFine, but I can\u2019t take the check.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThink of it as a gift certificate, a really big gift certificate,\u201d I told him. He began the protest. \u201cThink of it as a gift certificate, or I\u2019ll kick your ass at your own wedding reception.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I can\u2019t take anything you say seriously when you\u2019re dressed like that,\u201d Zeb said.</p><p>\u201cI think we should do what she says,\u201d Jolene whispered when I gave him the burning vampire stare of doom.</p><p>\u201cThanks, Jane,\u201d Zeb said, hugging me fiercely.</p><p>\u201cI love you guys. Go, mingle,\u201d I told them after kissing Jolene\u2019s cheek.</p><p>Andrea sidled up beside me to hand me a plastic champagne flute filled with frothy pink punch. \u201cI think it\u2019s safe. They wouldn\u2019t put meat in here, would they?\u201d</p><p>I sipped cautiously. \u201cIt appears not. How\u2019s it going?\u201d I asked, nodding toward Dick.</p><p>\u201cEh.\u201d She gave the so-so hand sign. \u201cHe\u2019s starting to pressure me, and I don\u2019t appreciate it. Why do men always want the one thing they can\u2019t have?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you guys aren\u2019t ... ?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat, no, we\u2019re at it like bunnies,\u201d she said, rolling her eyes. \u201cBut I won\u2019t let him drink from me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDang it, I do not need those visuals in my head! And don\u2019t think about it when you\u2019re around me, I can tell. Why won\u2019t you let him drink from you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause it\u2019s too much like work,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cKind of like a masseuse who doesn\u2019t want to go home and give back rubs?\u201d I asked. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYes, exactly like that Seinfeld episode.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have a limited frame of reference,\u201d I admitted as my cell phone rang from my dress pocket. The caller ID said it was my mother. Andrea was not the least bit offended when I answered it, since Dick had just approached with a tray of nibbles he\u2019d managed to snag from the buffet line using his vampire wiles. I shook my head and giggled as I snapped open the phone. At this point, I was surprised that Dick wasn\u2019t feeding them to her.</p><p>\u201cI just wanted to see whether you\u2019d called your sister yet,\u201d Mama said, again dispensing with a greeting.</p> <p>\u201cNo, but I have done an extensive inventory of the household contents at River Oaks and found an alarming number of items missing. The next time you\u2019re over at Jenny\u2019s, could you look for Depression glass, a silver coffee service, and some lace fans? I need to know what to put on the search warrant.\u201d</p><p>Mama sighed on the other end of the line. \u201cYou aren\u2019t really considering going to the police, are you? Jane, that would be so embarrassing to the family.\u201d</p><p>I sighed. \u201cI\u2019m not going to call the cops, Mama. But Jenny and Grandma should consider whatever they\u2019ve taken over the years to be their inheritance. That\u2019s their share of the Early legacy. I don\u2019t want to hear anything more about it. If Jenny wants to keep the lawsuit going, she can go ahead. I can afford a much better lawyer now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWon\u2019t you please\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I will not,\u201d I said firmly as I stepped away from the circle of light and love and family. Because clearly, that was not the place for this conversation. Also, Mama was not aware that Zeb\u2019s wedding was that night, and I could only imagine the tear storm that would ensue if she found out she hadn\u2019t been invited. \u201cNow, speaking of Grandma, have you heard from her in the last twenty-four hours, or should we assume that Wilbur has married and buried another wife?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cActually, Grandma Ruthie has canceled the wedding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause of something I said?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no, of course not.\u201d Mama laughed. \u201cBut when you started talking about how many wives Wilbur had, it just turned her stomach. Then she realized that she\u2019d been married almost as many times as he has.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, she realized her reign of matrimonial terror must end?\u201d I asked as Gabriel approached with Solo cups full of what might have been Boone\u2019s Farm\u2019s version of champagne.</p><p>Mama snorted. \u201cSomething like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes this mean I should contact the authorities about Wilbur?\u201d I asked. \u201cDid he take the break-up well?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, no, she didn\u2019t break it off with him. She says she still wants to date him,\u201d Mama said.</p><p>\u201cEw!\u201d I cried. \u201cHe\u2019s a dead guy.\u201d</p><p>A hurt look flashed across Gabriel\u2019s features. I mouthed, \u201cNot you,\u201d then pointed to the phone and added, \u201cWilbur.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re dead,\u201d Mama pointed out.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a different kind of dead. I\u2019m a cool kind of dead. Wilbur is all graveyard smells and feeding on the bottom rung of the food chain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJane, just let it go. Your grandma\u2019s a grown woman. If she wants to date a dead man, she can date a dead man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not what you said when I started dating a dead man,\u201d I grumbled.</p><p>\u201cWell, I just want you to be nice to Wilbur when you see him at the Labor Day picnic.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t have to be nice to people who try to stake me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJane, it\u2019s bad enough that you aren\u2019t speaking to Jenny. Don\u2019t cause more problems with your grandmother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJenny stole knickknacks from me, and I stopped talking to her. What makes you think I\u2019ll respond any better to someone trying to stake me with a cane?\u201d</p><p>In a maneuver that would make a NASCAR driver proud, Mama switched conversational lanes on me. \u201cOh, honey, I\u2019ve been meaning to ask you, have you seen Adam Morrow lately? His mama was at the beauty shop today. She hasn\u2019t heard from Adam in the last day or so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I haven\u2019t seen him since he stopped by the shop the other night,\u201d I said. \u201cHe seemed ...\u201d Creepy. Perverse. In need of medication and negative-reinforcement therapy.</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, if you see him, tell him to call his mama,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s not right to make a mother worry like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will. Look, I\u2019ve really got to go, Mama,\u201d I said as the DJ asked the crowd to clear the floor for Jolene and Zeb to have their first dance as husband and wife. I played the only excuse that I knew would get Mama off the phone. \u201cI\u2019ve got a date tonight. With Gabriel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood night!\u201d Mama squeaked, then promptly hung up.</p><p>Gabriel and I watched with interest as Zeb led his new bride onto the dance floor and the painfully familiar flute intro lilted.</p><p>\u201cOh, please tell me she didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Gabriel asked as Celine Dion\u2019s breathy soprano warbled, \u201cEvery night in my dreams ...\u201d</p><p>I groaned. \u201cWho picks \u2018My Heart Will Go On\u2019 for their first dance song?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a nice song.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a song about people dying. Frozen people dying. Not exactly the sentiment I would want to start my married life on. Then again, why am I surprised?\u201d I shrugged. \u201cShe has a Titanic chip boat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat would you prefer?\u201d He snorted. \u201c \u2018Hungry Like the Wolf\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt would be either brilliant or brilliantly tacky,\u201d I agreed.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s very happy,\u201d Gabriel observed.</p><p>\u201cAh, don\u2019t do that,\u201d I said. \u201cDon\u2019t make me petty.\u201d</p><p>I watched as Zeb twirled his wife across the clearing with surprising grace. Jolene was happy. She had all of the things I wanted for myself. A man whose love couldn\u2019t be questioned, or, if she could question it, she didn\u2019t. A firm handle on her special condition. Professional contentment. Parents who adored and accepted her, even if other members of the family didn\u2019t.</p><p>I would watch Jolene, learn from her. I\u2019d ask myself, \u201cWhat would Jolene do?\u201d the way most people ask, \u201cWhat would Oprah do?\u201d Even if that meant not asking my boyfriend about the mysterious and apparently unhinged Jeanine until he was ready to talk about her. I would not look for trouble in my relationship and create problems where there was none. I would trust that Gabriel loved me. Even if it came back and bit me on the ass in a major way.</p><p>Turning to my undead date, I poked him in the side and asked, \u201cAre you going to dance with me or what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy can\u2019t you wait to be asked?\u201d he muttered.</p><p>\u201cHave you met me?\u201d I asked. \u201cSurely you must have figured out some of this by now. I\u2019m contrary ... and you love it.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged.</p><p>\u201cSo, really, which one of us is the sick one?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cWill the best maid, the man of honor, and their escorts please join the happy couple?\u201d the DJ asked.</p><p>\u201cNow you have no choice,\u201d I told him.</p><p>Dick yanked Andrea onto the middle of the dance floor and offered a courtly bow. Andrea looked vaguely embarrassed but laughed as he drew her into his arms. Gabriel and I made a less dramatic entrance.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a terrible dancer,\u201d I told him.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d He pulled me into a box step, which my vampire grace still didn\u2019t help me master. \u201cSo, I\u2019ve been thinking.\u201d</p><p>I smirked. \u201cThat can be dangerous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t quite used your triumph settlement the way you wanted to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot true. Look at how happy they are.\u201d I nodded toward Jolene and Zeb.</p><p>\u201cI know it took quite a bit of money to do that. And it will take quite a bit more money to get the shop going.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich is your clever way of saying that Ophelia told you exactly how much I got.\u201d I gave him a wry smile.</p><p>\u201cI cannot comment,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause Ophelia\u2019s scarier than you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot going to argue there. But I am going to have a nice healthy nest egg. You don\u2019t have to worry about me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, we both know that\u2019s not true. The point, which we rarely get to painlessly, is that I know that you wanted to spend some of your ill-gotten wealth on travel.\u201d</p><p>I eyed him suspiciously. \u201cWhat did you do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing yet, but you say the word, and we will be on a plane. I\u2019ll keep my schedule open. I figured we could start in London and work our way east. I want to be with you when you see the Biblioth\u00e8que Nationale de France, harass some poor gondolier in Venice with questions. I\u2019ll even go to the Eiffel Tower if you want to be prosaic. Anywhere you want to go we\u2019ll go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTravel?\u201d I asked. \u201cFor how long?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUntil you get tired of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen can we leave?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cFrom here, as far as I\u2019m concerned,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a little quick.\u201d I laughed. \u201cBut I would love to go. Soon. And we will go to the Eiffel Tower, thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI knew it,\u201d he said. \u201cAt heart, you\u2019re just a sentimental romantic fool.\u201d</p><p>I laughed again, watching as Jolene and Zeb circled the floor. Lord help me, I actually started misting up. \u201cSometimes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you crying?\u201d he asked, lifting my chin.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSentimental, romantic fool,\u201d he said again as I wiped at my eyes.</p><p>\u201cI really hate this song,\u201d I grumbled.</p><p>He twirled me out and dipped me. \u201cHoney, let it go.\u201d </p> </body></html>"]
