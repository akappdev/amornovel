But sitting all quiet and cozy while Luke and his new wife, Shelby, snuggled and said sweet little things to each other was a special kind of torment he could do without. Sometimes they just faked being tired so they could slip off to bed at eight o\u2019clock at night. More often than not Sean just made it easy on them\u2014he\u2019d head over to a larger town on the coast where he could enjoy the sights and do a little window-shopping, maybe meet a woman of his own.</p><p>Sean was a U-2 pilot stationed at Beale Air Force Base in Northern California, a few hours south of Virgin River. He had accumulated a ton of vacation and could only carry over ninety days to the next fiscal year, so he had a couple of months to kill. His brother had just gotten married and Sean had been his best man. After the wedding, Sean decided to stay on in Virgin River and use up some of his leave. Given the fact that Luke and Shelby had been together about a year, Sean didn\u2019t feel as if he was interfering with the honeymoon by hanging around. All that loveydovey stuff was not so much about them sealing the deal, as it was about them still being hot to trot, as if they\u2019d just met.</p><p>And there was a lot of talk about baby making, something that surprised Sean about Luke. However, Luke\u2019s willingness to step up and try to nail that egg, night after night after night, that did not surprise Sean in the slightest.</p> <p>During the daytime, Sean always had lots to do. There was plenty of upkeep on the cabins Luke and Sean had bought together as an investment and which Luke now managed and rented full-time. There was hunting and fishing\u2014it was still deer season\u2014and the salmon and trout were fat; the river ran practically outside the front door. Luke and his helper, Art, were catching so many fish that Luke had to buy a shed, run some wiring to it from the house and invest in a big freezer.</p><p>There was no denying the appeal of the Virgin River area for a guy with time on his hands. Sean was an outdoorsman at heart and the October colors in the mountains were awesome. It wouldn\u2019t be all that long before the first snowfall, and soon after that he would have to get back to Beale. So, in the meantime, all he wanted to do was find a nice bar with a fireplace to relax next to\u2014one without his brother and sister-in-law cuddling up in front of it.</p><p>\u201cReady for another drink, pal?\u201d the bartender asked him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m good, thanks. I didn\u2019t come in here to check out the architecture, but the detailed carving in this place is impressive,\u201d Sean replied.</p><p>The bartender laughed. \u201cTwo things are obvious about you. You\u2019re not from around here and you\u2019re military.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOkay, I admit the haircut is a giveaway. But the rest\u2014?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is lumber country and this bar is wall-to-wall oak. When it was built, the wood was probably cheaper than the nails. The craftsmanship? Common around here. So, what brings you to town?\u201d</p><p>Sean took a sip of his beer. \u201cBurning off some leave. Visiting my brother. I have a little over six weeks of leave left. I used to hit the bars with my brother, but his running days are over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWar injury?\u201d the bartender asked.</p><p>\u201cBattle of the sexes. He just got married.\u201d</p><p>The bartender whistled. \u201cMy condolences.\u201d</p> <p>Tonight Sean had landed in a large upscale bar and restaurant in Arcata. He occupied a spot at the end of the bar where he could get a one-hundred-and-eighty-degree view of the place. So far it appeared as if all the women were with husbands or dates, but that didn\u2019t diminish his pleasure\u2014Sean wasn\u2019t always looking for a pickup. Sometimes it was nice to simply appreciate the view. Since he was going to be spending some time in this part of the world, he wasn\u2019t opposed to the idea of getting to know a girl, take her out, maybe even get a little up close and personal.</p><p>All such thoughts were suddenly stopped and were replaced by, Ah! Looks like I just hit the jackpot.</p><p>There was a ripple of female laughter as the door swung open and a group of women, who were obviously having a good time, entered. Even across the large restaurant, he could appreciate their assets. The first one was short, dark, a little on the round side and deliciously so. She appeared lush and soft and brought a smile to Sean\u2019s lips. The second one was tall, thin, athletic looking, with straight, silky, unfussy blond hair. Obviously a gymnast or runner\u2014a fine-looking woman. Next came a medium-sized redhead with a curvaceous figure, twinkling eyes and a bright smile. A feminine smorgasbord, he thought appreciatively. Sean did not discriminate\u2014he was attracted to all kinds of women, not just one type. Next was\u2014</p><p>Franci?</p><p>Nah, couldn\u2019t be, he told himself. He was just hallucinating again. He thought he\u2019d seen her many times before but it was never her. Besides, Franci wore her hair long and straight and this woman\u2019s mahogany hair was in one of those hyper-short cuts that, on anyone else, might look butch, but on her? Oh, man, it just couldn\u2019t get any sexier. It made her dark eyes look huge. The woman shed her coat and she was thinner than Franci, but not by that much. But her eyebrows were exactly the same as Franci\u2019s\u2014a nice, thin, provocative arch over those big, heavily lashed eyes. It got him missing Franci all over again.</p><p>She slid out of her coat and revealed a filmy dress. Maybe not filmy, but certainly silky. It was dark purple and fell loosely from her shoulders and was belted at the waist, then flowed again to her knees. The dress accentuated her perfect breasts, narrow waist, slim hips and long legs. Franci had rarely worn dresses but Sean hadn\u2019t minded\u2014her long legs and tight butt in a pair of fitted slacks used to blow his mind. But this dress was good. Very good.</p><p>The four women took a table near the front of the restaurant by the window. They were carrying boxes, shopping bags and party bags\u2014a birthday dinner out? The one who looked like his old girlfriend crossed her legs and revealed a slit in the skirt of that dress that exposed a scrumptious thigh. Whoa. His eyes were glued to that shapely leg. His groin tightened.</p><p>Then she laughed. God, it was Franci. If that wasn\u2019t Franci, it was her twin. The way she tilted her head back and let go was a laugh with passion. Franci had always laughed from deep inside her. That was how she cried, too.</p> <p>Sean was suddenly infused with mixed emotions\u2014remembering the wonderful laughs they\u2019d shared in bed after their typically great sex counterbalanced with how he remembered making her cry, and he was sorry he had ever made Franci cry.</p><p>Well, hell, he might have made her cry, but hadn\u2019t she infuriated him until he wanted to punch a hole in the wall? She could be maddening. Why was that again? He\u2019d think of it, given a minute. That had been almost four years ago. What was she doing here in Arcata? After the breakup\u2014which had been ugly\u2014he\u2019d looked for her. But he had let too much time slip by before doing so and she wasn\u2019t where he expected her to be. They\u2019d met in Iraq when he was deployed in the F-16 and she was an air force flight nurse who regularly appeared to take the injured out of the theater. Later, when he\u2019d been transferred to Luke Air Force Base in Phoenix as an instructor in the same jet, she was there, assigned as a nurse in the base hospital. They had dated exclusively for two years when a big shift occurred in their individual lives\u2014her service commitment was up and she was planning to separate from the air force and return to civilian life. He was going to cross-train in the U-2 high-altitude reconnaissance aircraft\u2014the spy plane. He didn\u2019t see how either of those events should effect any change. He told her he\u2019d be relocating to Beale AFB in Northern California. He thought she could probably find work there if she was interested.</p><p>That had been the beginning of the end. After dating for two years, she, at twenty-six, was ready for a commitment. She wanted marriage and a family, and he didn\u2019t. Well, there was nothing new there\u2014she\u2019d been honest about that since the beginning of their relationship. Franci had always hoped to marry and have children. And that wasn\u2019t something he needed more time to consider\u2014he really didn\u2019t see himself settling into that sweet little domestic trap. Ever. She\u2019d been good about not pushing that too hard, but she\u2019d never backed down, either. For Sean\u2019s part, he was monogamous. He told her he loved her because he did. If he occasionally glanced at and appreciated a pretty girl, it went no further. Even though they each maintained their own home, they spent every night together unless one of them was away from the base. But when it came to marriage and children, she was in, and he, at twenty-eight, was out.</p><p>She had said something like, \u201cIt\u2019s time to take this relationship to the next level or end it completely.\u201d</p><p>You don\u2019t want to be drawing a line in the sand in front of a young fighter pilot. Jet jockeys didn\u2019t take orders from girlfriends. Of course, it was no surprise that they fought and he made her cry with senseless, stupid comments like, \u201cNot in this lifetime, babe. If I were interested in getting married, we\u2019d be married,\u201d and, \u201cLook, I\u2019m just flat-ass not doing the rug-rats thing, all right? Even with you.\u201d Oh, yeah, he was brilliant.</p><p>She had said things, also in anger, probably things she didn\u2019t mean. Well, that wasn\u2019t exactly correct, as he recalled now, looking across a crowded room at her as she laughed and talked with her girlfriends. \u201cSean, if you let me go now I\u2019ll be so gone\u2014you\u2019ll never see me again. I need a committed partner or I\u2019m taking the walk.\u201d</p><p>And Sean, being the cocky genius he was, said, \u201cOh, yeah? Don\u2019t let the door hit you in the ass.\u201d He winced at the memory.</p><p>They had gone their separate ways, bitterly. He went to Beale because it looked as if getting a promotion and command position in the U-2 was more likely than in the highly competitive F-16. He was an Air Force Academy graduate; becoming a general was in his sites if he made the right moves. Franci had exited the air force.</p><p>Sean assumed, incorrectly, that he\u2019d be able to find her at her mother\u2019s, or at least near her mother\u2019s, in Santa Rosa. A few months later, when his training in the new aircraft was complete and he was ready to talk about their situation, sanely and calmly, she was long gone. So was her mother. And there appeared to be no forwarding address.</p><p>So, flash-forward four years. Arcata, California? It really didn\u2019t make sense, but that woman across the room was definitely Franci Duncan. He could tell it was her by the way his heart pounded and he felt hot all over. And by the way he was fighting an erection just looking across the room at her.</p><p>She and her friends had all ordered frothy after-dinner drinks, and were joking with the young waitress. They leaned toward one another to whisper, sitting back to laugh\u2014they were gossiping and having fun. One member of the group pulled a silky wrap out of a colorful bag and put it around her shoulders, admiringly. The birthday girl? There weren\u2019t any men around them and he could only pick out one wedding ring in the group, and it wasn\u2019t on Franci\u2019s hand. Not that it meant anything; people didn\u2019t necessarily wear wedding rings all the time these days.</p><p>\u201cYou still okay on that drink, pal?\u201d the bartender asked to no avail.</p><p>As Sean watched the proceedings he missed her so bad he ached with it. Letting her get away was one of the great tactical errors of his adult life. He should have found a way to convince her they\u2019d be fine together without marriage, without a bunch of ankle-biters. But at twenty-eight, pumped up on his fighter-pilot prowess, he\u2019d been overconfident. He had especially not been ready for some woman to be calling the shots. Now, at thirty-two, he realized how stupid he\u2019d been at twenty-eight. In those four years there had been other women, and not one of them had come close to what he\u2019d felt for Franci. For what he\u2019d felt with Franci. And he was willing to bet she hadn\u2019t found anyone as good, either.</p><p>He was hoping that. He probably shouldn\u2019t bet on it. Franci was incredible; there had probably been a long line of able-bodied, good-looking, more-than-willing men lined up at her front door\u2014wherever that was. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou still on my planet, pal?\u201d the bartender asked.</p><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeems like something besides my skill at pouring a drink has your attention.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he said, looking back at Franci. \u201cI think maybe I know one of them,\u201d he said, tilting his head toward the table of women.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s your drink?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m good,\u201d Sean said, his eyes uncontrollably drawn to the woman across the room.</p><p>The women had a second order of frothy coffees. There was a lot more laughing, talking, rummaging through the gifts, and they were oblivious to anything else happening in that bar. They certainly weren\u2019t trolling for guys. They never even glanced toward the bar.</p><p>If she looked his way, even once, he\u2019d have to think of something clever to say. He\u2019d have to smile, walk confidently across the room to their table, say hello and get friendly. He\u2019d have to make them laugh and like him, because he couldn\u2019t let her get out of here without finding out where she lived. She might be visiting one of those women, which meant that after she left, she\u2019d be totally gone again. He couldn\u2019t let that happen. He needed to see her, talk to her. Touch her. Hold her.</p> <p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you go over there? Say hello?\u201d the bartender asked.</p><p>He looked up at his new friend. \u201cYeah...well...The last time we talked, I wasn\u2019t her favorite person.\u201d</p><p>The bartender laughed. \u201cHard to imagine,\u201d he said.</p><p>Sean had been staring at that table of women for a long time and the bartender was probably watching that, in case he turned out to be some kind of pervert. Sean turned on the charm; he cheered up real fast so he didn\u2019t look so intense. \u201cHey, I should settle up and get going, even if the scenery in here is incredible.\u201d He put some money on the bar, including a nice tip, and left without finishing his drink. He walked out with his head down, trying not to attract any attention.</p><p>It was colder than usual on the coast this October night. He wandered across the street, where he could keep an eye on the front door. He hoped they quit the bar before he froze to death. It made him sick to think she might get away from him.</p><p>He made up his mind and it took him less than fifteen seconds to decide\u2014he really needed to see if he could get things straightened out with Franci. They should be together. He just hoped she would see it that way.</p> <p>He actually said a prayer. There had to be a patron saint to ignorant, immature playboys, right? Saint Hugh? Saint Don Juan? Whomever...give me a break here and I\u2019ll change my ways. I swear. I won\u2019t be overconfident; I\u2019ll be sensitive. We\u2019ll negotiate and get back to what we had before...And then it happened. The four women came out the front door of the restaurant, one of them toting her presents. They lingered, laughed some more, hugged and then they went their separate ways. Two went left, two went right. At the end of the block, Franci and her friend went in opposite directions, and Sean, feeling as if this was the one chance in his lifetime, hotfooted it after her.</p><p>He had just about caught up to her when she was unlocking the door of a small silver sedan. \u201cFranci?\u201d he called out.</p><p>She jumped, turned and stared at him, wide-eyed.</p><p>\u201cIt is you,\u201d he said, taking a few steps nearer to her. \u201cYour hair\u2014wow. Threw me off for a minute.\u201d</p><p>She looked almost frightened at first. But then she seemed to compose herself, though she shivered from the cold and pulled her coat tighter around her. \u201cSean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he said, laughing. \u201cI can\u2019t believe I\u2019m running into you here, of all places.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d she asked, not looking thrilled to see him.</p><p>\u201cRemember Luke? Remember, I told you we bought some old cabins together a long time ago? Long before I met you. Well, he got out of the army and came up here to work on \u2019em.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHere?\u201d she asked, aghast. She pulled her coat tighter. \u201cThose cabins are here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBack in the mountains, along the Virgin River,\u201d he said. \u201cI was just burning some leave, visiting him. I came over here for dinner.\u201d</p><p>She looked around. \u201cWhere\u2019s Luke?\u201d she asked. \u201cIs he with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He laughed. \u201cMarried. Recently married. I try to get out of their hair in the evening because they...\u201d He stopped and laughed silently, shaking his head. Then he looked at her face. \u201cYou look great. How long have you been here? In Arcata?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI, ah, I don\u2019t actually live in Arcata. I was just meeting some friends for dinner. Everything all right with you? With your family?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEveryone is good,\u201d he said. He took another step toward her. \u201cFranci, let me buy you a cup of coffee. Let\u2019s catch up a little.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh...No, I don\u2019t think so, Sean,\u201d she said, shaking her head. \u201cI\u2019d better get\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI looked for you,\u201d he said impulsively. \u201cTo say it was a mistake, the way we broke up. We should talk. There might be things we can work out that we were both too stubborn to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cListen, don\u2019t even go there, Sean. It\u2019s all in the past. No hard feelings,\u201d she said. \u201cSo good luck and good\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you married or something?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She was startled. \u201cNo. But I\u2019m not looking to go back to the discussion that ended us. Maybe you were able to just blow it off, but I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t blow it off, Franci,\u201d he said. \u201cI looked for you and couldn\u2019t find you anywhere. That\u2019s why I want to talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I don\u2019t,\u201d she said. She opened her car door. \u201cI think you\u2019ve probably said enough on that subject.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFranci, what the fuck?\u201d he asked, confused and a little angry by her immediate rebuff. \u201cGod, can\u2019t we have a conversation? We were together for two years! It was good, me and you. We never had anyone else, either one of us, and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you said it wasn\u2019t going any further.\u201d She stiffened her back. \u201cIn fact, that was one of the nicer things you said. I\u2019m glad you\u2019re doing fine\u2014you look just the same, happy as can be. Say hello to your mother and brothers. And really, don\u2019t push this. We decided. We\u2019re over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on. I don\u2019t believe you mean that,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cBelieve it,\u201d she shot back. \u201cYou made a decision\u2014you didn\u2019t want a commitment to me. And here you are\u2014you don\u2019t have one. Bye. Take care.\u201d</p><p>She got in her car and slammed the door. He took two giant steps forward and heard the door locks click into place. She backed out of her parking space quickly and drove away. He memorized the license number, but the most important thing he noticed was that it was a California plate. She might not live in Arcata, but she lived close enough to drive over for dinner.</p><p>Now that he\u2019d seen her, he knew what he\u2019d long suspected. He was far from over her.</p><p>Franci\u2019s hands trembled so much, she found it hard to drive. She always knew there was a chance she would bump into him someday, though she carefully avoided the most obvious places where that could happen. But she had never, never expected him to want to talk about it, to talk about them!</p><p>And when she thought of the months she had prayed for that talk to happen, it caused her vision to blur with gathering tears. Angry tears! She pursed her lips and thought, No! She\u2019d cried enough over him; he wouldn\u2019t get the benefit of one more tear.</p><p>Franci left Phoenix after their breakup and went home to Santa Rosa to work as a civilian nurse in a hospital. She had lived with her mother. Almost a year later, she got a good job that fed her addiction to adrenaline\u2014a flight nurse position with a helicopter transport unit. Less demanding work hours, good benefits, more opportunities\u2014but it meant a move. Because she had her bachelor of science in nursing, she was able to teach a couple of courses at Humboldt U in Arcata, perhaps building a future in academia.</p><p>Her mom, a family-medicine physician\u2019s assistant, had been ready for a change. Vivian found a position in a family-medicine clinic in Eureka. An excellent position. Vivian\u2019s hours were more demanding\u2014full-time, in fact. So the two of them moved north together, closer to Vivian\u2019s job than Franci\u2019s, and twice a week, Franci drove over the mountains to Redding to pull a twenty-four-hour shift as a flight nurse. Most of her flights were routine patient transport via helicopter\u2014getting a heart or C-section patient out of a small-town hospital to a larger facility where special surgery could be performed. But occasionally she was on board for an emergency\u2014victims of a wildfire, car accidents in isolated parts of the mountain terrain, injuries requiring emergency surgery. She had loved in-flight nursing in the air force and had missed it. This new job fit the bill. She bought a cute little house on the outskirts of Eureka in the kind of quiet, lovely neighborhood she most enjoyed and, until tonight, she thought her life was nearly perfect.</p><p>Looked for her, had he? Not very hard. Once six months had passed, she thought she\u2019d come to terms with the fact that they were not meant to be. They wanted different things from life; he wanted to play and have fun till he was a grizzled old man and she wanted to put down roots and grow a family.</p><p>What wasn\u2019t fair about it was that she\u2019d been attracted to the very thing that seemed to prevent him from wanting to settle down. He was handsome and daring and reckless, as good at snow and water skiing as he was at snuggling up on the couch to watch a movie. Of course, it was one chick flick to every five action-adventures, but that was okay with Franci\u2014she liked action herself. She thought their relationship could exist within a marriage just as easily as it did outside marriage. Half the couples they had camped and traveled and played with were married with kids. Kids didn\u2019t bother Sean; he seemed to like them. But he was adamant; he didn\u2019t need any official contract to show how he felt and he wasn\u2019t interested in being tied down by the needs of children.</p><p>The fifteen-minute drive south to Eureka from Arcata hadn\u2019t been enough to settle Franci\u2019s nerves, so she drove around town another fifteen minutes before heading to her little neighborhood. She wanted to be completely composed when she got home. She should have known she had only been kidding herself about being at peace with her decision to leave him. That myth was disproved the second she saw him. God, he still made her heart race. One look at his face and she felt the blood surge through her veins; she could feel the heat on her cheeks. She couldn\u2019t have a cup of coffee with him. She\u2019d probably lunge across the table at Starbucks and tear his clothes off his body. She would have to be strong. Firm. Get herself bolstered and ready; she was weak. She might hate him, but she still loved him. And he still turned her on. All that meant he could hurt her again.</p><p>She finally parked in her little one-and-a-half-car garage, pulled down the door and walked into the house and through the kitchen. She could hear the TV in the living room and there she found her mother, sleeping while sitting up, and her daughter, Rosie, curled up on the couch beside her. The only one who looked up when she walked into the room was Harry, their blond-and-white cocker spaniel.</p><p>\u201cHi, Harry,\u201d she said.</p><p>He wagged a couple of times and rolled over on his back, just in case anyone wanted to rub his belly.</p><p>\u201cMom?\u201d she said, giving her mother a little jostle. \u201cMom? I\u2019m home.\u201d</p><p>Vivian stirred and straightened. \u201cHm, hi. I must have dozed off.\u201d She stretched. \u201cDid you have fun?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. Those girls are always fun. I\u2019ll catch you up on the gossip tomorrow after you\u2019ve had a good night\u2019s sleep.\u201d</p><p>Vivian stood. \u201cLet me put Rosie\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take her to bed, Mom,\u201d Franci said. \u201cTucking her in is the best part of the day. How long has she been asleep?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe probably stayed awake longer than I did,\u201d Vivian said with a laugh. She gave Franci a pat on one cheek and a kiss on the other. \u201cDay off tomorrow. Call when you\u2019re up. We\u2019ll have coffee or something.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSure. Thanks, Mom.\u201d Franci grabbed Vivian\u2019s coat from the back of the chair and helped her slip it on. \u201cI\u2019ll watch you walk home,\u201d Franci said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure I won\u2019t fall in the street. Or get mugged.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll watch you just the same.\u201d</p> <p>Franci, Vivian and Rosie had lived together in this little two-bedroom house for a couple of years, Franci sharing her bed with Rosie. About a year ago Vivian had purchased a similar house at the end of the block. They\u2019d always planned to have their own residences, both of them being independent, single women, but Rosie\u2019s arrival was the impetus for them to remain close enough so they could join forces to take care of her. When Franci worked those twenty-four-hour shifts, or went out on that rare late-night date, Rosie spent the night at Grandma\u2019s. If it wasn\u2019t going to be a late night or an overnight for Franci, Grandma came to Rosie\u2019s house so Rosie could fall asleep in her own bed. Now that Rosie was in preschool and day care, both her mother and grandmother could easily juggle child care and manage their jobs.</p><p>Franci watched her mom walk down the street and up the flower-lined walk that led to her own door. Once Vivian was inside, she flashed her porch light a few times to signal that she was all right, then Franci went in and closed her own front door.</p><p>Franci hung up her coat, scooped her redheaded daughter off the couch and carried her to bed. Her arms flopped; she was out cold. Her comforter was turned down and her bedside lamp glowed. Grandma had clearly been optimistic that Rosie would slip right into bed when it was time, rather than fall asleep on the couch, as she preferred. Franci tucked her daughter in, pressed the comforter around her and kissed her forehead. Rosie let out a sleepy snort.</p><p>\u201cI saw your daddy tonight,\u201d Franci whispered. \u201cThere\u2019s a reason you\u2019re so beautiful.\u201d</p><p>Two</p> <p>Sean hadn\u2019t slept real well after seeing his old flame, so he beat the morning rush in the bathroom before there was so much as a sound from the bridal suite. He was halfway through his Wheaties when Shelby came into the kitchen in her jeans and sweater, ready to head over to Arcata to school. She was studying nursing at Humboldt U.</p><p>\u201cWell, well. It\u2019s rare to see you before I get home in the afternoon,\u201d she remarked, going for the coffee. \u201cWhen you\u2019ve been out prowling till the wee hours, you usually need your beauty sleep.\u201d</p><p>Sean grunted.</p><p>\u201cI guess that was \u2018good morning,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cAnd same to you.\u201d</p><p>Luke came into the kitchen next. \u201cWell, hey there, sunshine,\u201d he said to his brother. Sean lifted his eyes but not his head. Luke laughed at the grim expression. \u201cLumpy mattress? Did we put out the scratchy toilet paper?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBed\u2019s fine.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou want to grab a couple of the general\u2019s horses and ride along the\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to be tied up. I have some errands,\u201d Sean said.</p><p>Shelby lifted a stack of thank-you notes from the table and gave her husband a glare. They\u2019d been married a couple of weeks and he was supposed to be adding his gratitude and signature to the notes she\u2019d all but completed. \u201cLuke...\u201d she began. \u201cBefore you think about riding or fishing\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, I know,\u201d he said, glancing at the notes. \u201cIt\u2019ll get done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou really think he\u2019s going to do that girlie shit, Shelby?\u201d Sean asked.</p><p>Shelby sat down at the table, confusion knitting her brow. She\u2019d known Sean for about a year; he was the playful brother\u2014the flirt and the comedian. They used to joke that Sean would have fun at a train wreck; his mood was perpetually upbeat. Luke had been the grump, but she\u2019d softened him up. This crankiness from Sean was so unexpected. \u201cAre you all right?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d he answered shortly.</p><p>Luke poured himself a coffee and sat down. \u201cFender bender? Speeding ticket? Pretty girl reject you? Food poisoning?\u201d</p> <p>Sean sat back in his chair. \u201cI ran into Franci last night,\u201d he grumbled. \u201cPure chance.\u201d</p><p>Luke merely frowned; he didn\u2019t remember her. Sean had dated prolifically.</p><p>\u201cFranci Duncan,\u201d he said in exasperation. \u201cWho I practically lived with a few years ago. Remember? We broke up when she got out of the air force and I got assigned the U-2.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I remember her now,\u201d Luke said. \u201cHaven\u2019t you seen her since then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Sean said impatiently, taking another spoonful of cereal. \u201cI tried to see her, but she was gone. I tried to reach her mother to see where she was, and her mother had moved, which made no sense because she\u2019d been in that house in Santa Rosa for at least ten years. Maybe twenty years, I don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou looked for her?\u201d Luke asked. \u201cThis is the first I\u2019ve heard about that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I didn\u2019t talk about it. And I didn\u2019t find her,\u201d Sean said. \u201cObviously.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about her friends?\u201d Shelby asked.</p><p>Sean was silent. He grimaced and finally said, \u201cI checked with a couple of them, but they didn\u2019t know anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s crazy,\u201d Shelby said. \u201cWomen don\u2019t give up women friends. Especially after they\u2019ve broken up with a guy they\u2019ve been with a while\u2014that\u2019s traumatic, even when it\u2019s for the best. Who was her best friend? Her other best friend? I mean, it was kind of different with me\u2014I was my mother\u2019s caretaker and, while I had good friends, I had very little time for them. But I was always in touch with them when I\u2014\u201d</p><p>Luke put a hand over Shelby\u2019s to stop her because Sean looked perfectly miserable.</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d she said quietly. \u201cWell, who\u2019d you ask?\u201d</p><p>Sean shrugged uncomfortably. \u201cWe used to do things all the time with some couples\u2014guys from my squadron and their wives or girls. We went four-wheeling, skiing, boating, camping, hiking...Two of them were married and one couple lived together. I asked the women. They hadn\u2019t heard from her. I asked her former boss, the colonel in her old medical unit at the base hospital. I asked her neighbor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d Shelby said again.</p><p>\u201cOkay, she had a few girlfriends and I met them, but we didn\u2019t get together with them and I couldn\u2019t remember their last names. And it had been a while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm. A while?\u201d Shelby asked.</p><p>\u201cOkay, what happened was this\u2014we had a fight. I got orders and she was going to get out of the air force, all at the same time. And she wanted to know...Thing was, I was transferring. I told her there was nothing stopping her from relocating to be closer to my next assignment and that pissed her off\u2014that I didn\u2019t exactly invite her to join me, that I didn\u2019t make plans with her. I probably said I was sorry for that\u2014I bet I did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you broke up over that?\u201d Shelby asked.</p><p>\u201cSort of. Not exactly,\u201d Sean admitted.</p><p>Luke put his elbow on the kitchen table and lazily leaned his chin into his hand, watching. Amused. And so glad some other Riordan male was taking the heat.</p><p>Sean took a breath. \u201cShe wanted to get married,\u201d he said. \u201cShe said, either we at least get engaged and plan to get married, or I walk. Those were her words.\u201d He made a slash in the air with his finger. \u201cLine in the sand. Ultimatum.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally,\u201d Shelby said with a questionable tone. \u201cAfter only two years of practically living together?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, now you\u2019re just making fun of me,\u201d Sean said in a pout. \u201cI admit, I shouldn\u2019t have let her go. But I was younger. I was cocky then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, were you?\u201d Luke asked.</p><p>Sean glowered.</p><p>\u201cSo, she said she was ready for marriage, you said you weren\u2019t, you split up\u2014is that right?\u201d Shelby asked.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s about it.\u201d He made a face. \u201cWe might\u2019ve said a few unnecessary things during the discussion. You know\u2014angry things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll bet,\u201d Luke said.</p><p>\u201cAnd you tried to track her down? Later?\u201d Shelby asked.</p><p>\u201cAfter I transitioned into the new squadron. After training in the new jet. After I thought we both had time to simmer down a little bit. You know.\u201d</p><p>Shelby looked at Luke and shook her head dismally. \u201cDoes this run in the family?\u201d she asked. She and Luke had had a similar standoff, but she hadn\u2019t let him get away with it and had pushed him hard. But Luke had been ready to be domesticated. All she knew about Sean was that he was considered a playboy by the brothers. This was the first time she\u2019d heard about a steady girl.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s possible,\u201d Luke admitted with a shrug. \u201cExcept Aiden. He wants to get married, have a family, but if he didn\u2019t have bad luck with women, he\u2019d have no luck at all. He was married once. To a lunatic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLord,\u201d Shelby said. \u201cNo wonder your mother is fed up with the lot of you. Sean, what happened when you ran into her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe said I looked good and, no, she didn\u2019t want to have coffee or anything else with me. She won\u2019t talk to me. At all. And I even said I was wrong. Sort of.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHm,\u201d Shelby said. \u201cMaybe she\u2019s moved on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, then, she has to tell me that. Explain that. Because\u2014\u201d He stopped. He couldn\u2019t think of a reason why she owed him that, but he was sure she did.</p><p>\u201cNow what?\u201d Luke asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to have to find her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? You said you were done, she said okay, you caught up a few years later and it\u2019s still done...I don\u2019t see the issue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you wouldn\u2019t,\u201d Sean said in a very impatient huff. \u201cBecause you don\u2019t know Franci.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure I do. We all knew Franci. Nice girl, Franci. Hottie.\u201d He grinned. \u201cWe kind of all thought you\u2019d marry her. But then when you didn\u2019t and went to Beale alone, we all said, \u2018There goes another Riordan.\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere\u2019s the thing\u2014I shouldn\u2019t have broken up with her. What I should have done was explain why we should stay together and why we didn\u2019t need any kind of old-fashioned contract to be okay with that. We were young, only twenty-six and twenty-eight. There was lots of time to consider big leaps like marriage. There\u2019s still lots of time, for that matter.\u201d Luke, thirty-eight and barely through a similar crisis, lifted a brow toward his twenty-five-year-old wife. \u201cWe should have gone to Beale and worked it out. But I didn\u2019t do that because she made me so frickin\u2019 mad.\u201d</p><p>It was silent in the kitchen for a moment. \u201cWell,\u201d Luke finally said with fake cheeriness, \u201cI\u2019d love to stay and chat about your pathetic love life, but I need to grab Art and get over to the hardware store before\u2014\u201d</p><p>Shelby was shaking her head dismally. \u201cSo you had a little hissy and said, \u2018Fine, just go, then.\u2019 Is that it? Kind of like, \u2018My way or the highway,\u2019 huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAw, come on, Shelby,\u201d Sean said pleadingly. \u201cYou know I\u2019m not a guy with a temper! I\u2019m a sweetheart. I\u2019m not a fighter, I\u2019m a lover. And I don\u2019t have any problem seeing myself with one woman. You know? It\u2019s just the whole marriage thing\u2014it was not for me. Marriage scared the hell out of me. A couple of my brothers tried it and it screwed them up bad. And kids?\u201d He shook his head. \u201cMaybe when I\u2019m old and worn out like Luke I\u2019ll change my mind, but at the moment I don\u2019t feel like being tied down like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh,\u201d she said. \u201cI see. So you\u2019d like to have a nice chat with Franci and explain all this to her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething like that,\u201d he said, making perfect sense to himself. \u201cIt\u2019s no crime to have a fight, but we never should\u2019ve given up what we had. We were good together.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Shelby stood. \u201cNot good enough, I guess. Too bad I have to get to class, Sean. You have such a deep hole to climb out of and I\u2019d love to talk you through it. You know I\u2019ve loved you since the moment I met you, and I\u2019d be happy to help. But school calls...\u201d</p><p>Sean stood from the table, as well. \u201cWhat do you mean, such a climb?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, the short version. You let her go because you didn\u2019t feel in charge. You didn\u2019t bother to look for her for such a long time that her trail went cold\u2014and I imagine, to her, it seemed as if you didn\u2019t care. You didn\u2019t even know the names of her best friends. Or her mother\u2019s friends. You paid no attention to the woman, except where it was useful to you. You even socialized with your friends, from your squadron, and then you were surprised that they hadn\u2019t heard from her. And now I think you\u2019re a little hurt that she won\u2019t forget all that and give you another chance to treat her like someone you might get around to later, when it\u2019s convenient. While she, at least at one time a few years ago, wanted to be thought of as someone you couldn\u2019t live without.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou don\u2019t understand,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cBut your real problem is, I do,\u201d Shelby said. \u201cYou didn\u2019t realize how much she meant to you until she was gone.\u201d</p><p>Luke drained his coffee cup. He put it on the table. \u201cWhen you have time, Sean, you should take a little course from Shelby. She\u2019s seen every chick flick ever filmed. She knows things about this you and I have never thought of.\u201d</p><p>Sean swallowed. Looking down he said, \u201cReal quick, from a girl\u2019s point of view, what do I do next?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot what you think,\u201d Shelby replied. \u201cYou better not do what you did before. Whatever it was that made you arrogantly think she\u2019d never be able to leave you? Not that. You better do whatever it was you did that worked for her, that made her think she wanted a life with you. If you can even remember that far back. Because, brother, I think maybe you\u2019re too late. And if you\u2019re too late, you\u2019re going to have to accept that and respect her space. If you turn crazy and give her trouble, I\u2019m not on your side anymore.\u201d</p> <p>When Sean was alone in the house, he began asking himself what it was that had worked on Franci. Once they\u2019d become a couple, he\u2019d had lots of tricks up his sleeve. He was remembering the many areas where they had been compatible. Suddenly, it was hard to remember that, on a few issues, they had rubbed each other the wrong way.</p><p>Getting her to go out with him in the first place had been a real challenge. She\u2019d been in the air force a while and knew her way around the jet jockeys, and she had a firm policy against dating fighter pilots. They had a reputation for being arrogant, self-absorbed idiots with short attention spans where women were concerned. Sean and Franci never discussed it, but Sean assumed she must have dated at least a couple to come up with that assessment. Which, as Sean grudgingly recalled, wasn\u2019t far off the mark.</p><p>But there had been lots of positive things, too, and right now he was becoming uncomfortable imagining every little thing he had done to make her crazy with desire, to make her purr with satisfaction, because the chemistry they had in the sack was phenomenal. Those times she wasn\u2019t in the mood, he knew what to say to change her mind. There were places he touched that would not only convince her to give it some more thought, but could turn her into a wild woman. And could she ever turn those tricks back on him, making him gasp and groan, driving him right out of his mind. None of those little things had worked on any other woman the way they had on Franci. She had a way of taking him so far beyond pleasure, he went out of his mind. He\u2019d never been to bed with a woman who could please him the way Franci had, and he\u2019d been to bed with far too many women.</p><p>What had he been thinking, letting her walk away?</p><p>Sean searched his memory for how he\u2019d convinced her to take a chance on him in the first place and his mind was a blur. He\u2019d probably been relentless in his pursuit because he did remember how he had felt when he first saw her. He\u2019d taken one look at her and thought, Oh, Mary, Jesus and Joseph! She just did something to him. He had a lot of experience with attraction, but this was animal attraction. Primal and raw. He\u2019d wanted her immediately. And he still wanted her that bad.</p><p>Sean first saw Franci when she passed through Iraq to pick up a planeload of medical evacuees. He\u2019d tried to get her coordinates so he could get in touch when he was stateside again. He\u2019d seen her a few times\u2014she was in and out, arriving on a medical air transport, hanging around until they could gather up all their patients, taking off for the States again. She wouldn\u2019t give him anything\u2014not even a name. Of course, he managed to find out her name pretty easily, but that was all.</p> <p>Then when he saw her at Luke AFB in the officers\u2019 club, he decided it must be kismet; they were meant to be. But she hadn\u2019t been any easier to convince. He remembered hoping she was as beautiful on the inside as she was sexy on the outside, because anything less would break his heart.</p><p>And she was. She was smart, strong, independent, confident, sexy and loving.</p><p>Franci was the kind of woman men looked at, but her sexiness was understated, not blatant. Franci was not cheap or flashy; she was classy and cool. She was long legged and dark haired with large, deep, dark eyes and thin, arched, expressive brows. Her mouth was a little pouty\u2014soft and full. He could remember every detail of her body. But he couldn\u2019t remember how he\u2019d caught her. Sean\u2019s typical move was to charm a woman, make her laugh, smolder her with his half-closed eyes, suggest, without being crude, that he could deliver satisfaction. He\u2019d never shown an ounce of humility; he\u2019d always been confident.</p><p>But he wasn\u2019t confident anymore. Now he was frustrated, and he didn\u2019t have the first clue about how to fix it. For once in his life, he didn\u2019t know where to start.</p><p>He went to the second upstairs bedroom where Luke kept his computer. The desk was covered with so many wedding gifts that it was hard to see the computer. He moved a bunch of things out of the way and got the thing turned on. Franci had no phone or address listing when he\u2019d called information, but after spending a couple of hours on Luke\u2019s computer, doing a real-estate property search, he found Francine Duncan had purchased a house. It wasn\u2019t unusual for women to have unlisted phone numbers, but property-title searches were public record. Still, he didn\u2019t think his best idea was turning up at her house uninvited. But what were the options?</p><p>Sean was in the kitchen having a sandwich when Luke and Art came back from the hardware store. Art was such a kick; every time he saw Sean he greeted him as if he hadn\u2019t seen him in months or even years. Art was a thirty-year-old man with highly functional Down syndrome, a kindhearted soul who worked hard to help Luke around the property. And Luke, whom Sean had just barely realized would make a great father, worked hard to be sure Art felt appreciated.</p><p>\u201cSean!\u201d Art said, beaming.</p><p>\u201cHi, Art. Go fishing this morning?\u201d Sean asked.</p> <p>\u201cNo, we had trash to haul to the dump and then we went to the hardware store for stuff. Later I might fish. Did you go fishing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSort of. I was looking up stuff on the computer.\u201d</p><p>Luke got out the bread and sandwich makings. \u201cAny luck finding contact information on Franci?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cGot an address, but no phone number,\u201d Sean said. \u201cI did a computer search\u2014and lucky for me, she bought a house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you have a new girlfriend, Sean?\u201d Art asked.</p><p>For some reason, the question embarrassed Sean. The fact that Art, who didn\u2019t really know him at all and was about as worldly as a ten-year-old, would assume that he always had a girlfriend made Sean uncomfortable. Maybe Franci was right about him; she\u2019d said he\u2019d never settle down with one woman because he was all about the chase but not the commitment. It wasn\u2019t entirely true, as he was discovering. He\u2019d settled down with Franci, just not all the way. \u201cNot really,\u201d Sean answered. \u201cI had a girlfriend a few years ago and we lost touch. I want to see her again, talk to her about that, see if we can...date again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d Art said. \u201cThat\u2019s cool.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the problem is?\u201d Luke asked.</p><p>\u201cShe took one look at me and fireworks shot out of her ears. I think she hates me. At least, she\u2019s still mad. But it could mean she still cares,\u201d he added hopefully. \u201cIf I knew where to run into her again, I could try my persuasive charm on her without crowding her. I might\u2019ve tried something like that the first time around. Like being at the officers\u2019 club every time I thought she\u2019d be there, till she got so sick of me shadowing her, she gave in.\u201d</p><p>Luke laughed. \u201cSuave,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cThink I should throw myself on her mercy? Nah,\u201d he answered for himself. \u201cFrom what I saw, she doesn\u2019t have a lot of mercy in her right now. Besides, humility really isn\u2019t my strong suit.\u201d</p><p>Luke laughed at him. \u201cAnd, God forbid, we manly Riordans always play our best cards.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know what I mean. What woman wants a man who grovels? Did you grovel? When you and Shelby\u2014?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hate to burst your bubble, pal, but I said I\u2019d do anything that would make her happy. I know\u2014it\u2019s hard for you to imagine your tough big brother caving like that, but when I got down to it, I was doomed without her. She\u2019s the breath in me.\u201d Then he grinned. \u201cBut she doesn\u2019t make me grovel anymore. She lets me pretend to be the big man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSwell,\u201d Sean said, a long way from understanding all the rules for this game. The part he did almost understand was she\u2019s the breath in me. \u201cThere you go\u2014I\u2019m just plain better at the whole short-term hookup.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, if that floats your boat, have a good time.\u201d</p><p>There was the problem. Short-term hookups just didn\u2019t do it for him anymore. Truthfully, they hadn\u2019t in a long time. In fact, he\u2019d been wondering why he\u2019d been feeling so dissatisfied, so marginally happy rather than jazzed all the time, and the second he saw Franci, he understood why.</p><p>\u201cListen, mind if I ask you something?\u201d Luke asked, while he was shuffling lunch meat, cheese and bread. \u201cYou were with her a couple of years. Seemed like it was a good couple of years but it ran its course or something. You broke up, and for four years you were okay. You managed. Why can\u2019t you just walk away now?\u201d</p><p>Hard to explain, Sean thought. \u201cYou ever get this idea in your head about how things should be, then you just stay the course, even if it doesn\u2019t feel exactly right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe?\u201d Luke asked with a facetious laugh. \u201cDid you think I was just faking being a dumb grunt who almost lost his own woman?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t ready to get married,\u201d Sean said. \u201cI didn\u2019t like getting pushed up against a wall and we both walked away mad. Six months later I was thinking, I might not be ready to get married, but I\u2019m not ready for this to be over, either. I thought I could compromise if she could. So I called her cell phone. I left a couple of messages and she never called back. A few more months and I thought, all right\u2014if it takes marriage to make her happy, I could probably work with the idea, as long as she gives me plenty of time to adjust. Maybe we could have a long engagement, just to make sure we\u2019re doing the right thing. So I called again and the cell phone was shut off. Her e-mail bounced back\u2014undeliverable. Her mother, who she\u2019s very tight with, had moved. And if you think I was teed off before, the idea she\u2019d just ignore me like that when I\u2019m fucking trying\u2014that really pissed me off.\u201d And ripped my heart out. Just like I\u2019d ripped her heart out by saying no way. What a couple of fools.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a bad word,\u201d Art said very quietly. Art wasn\u2019t one to judge or harangue, but he also wasn\u2019t one to miss anything. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSorry, Art. I\u2019m going to try harder,\u201d Sean said.</p><p>Luke said, \u201cWell, you seemed to be doing just fine to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMost days,\u201d Sean said with a shrug. \u201cI got into the plane, man. I was all caught up in the missions. I was away a lot. I got by. But every time I met a girl, all I did was compare her to Franci.\u201d And saw Franci everywhere I looked, till I thought I was losing my mind.</p> <p>\u201cDid you keep looking for her?\u201d Luke asked.</p><p>\u201cNo. I figured it would pass eventually. The second I saw her I realized it wasn\u2019t going to pass. I think, in a way, this is my fault. Well, I thought for a few years it was her fault\u2014that she was bossy and impatient and that no woman was going to tell me how the hog eats the cabbage. Now, I think there\u2019s a good chance I was an idiot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYa think?\u201d Luke asked. When Sean glowered, he chuckled and said, \u201cListen, I\u2019m not being a jerk\u2014but I just walked this road, brother. I\u2019m lucky Shelby is smarter than I am, that\u2019s all.\u201d Luke looked at Sean seriously. \u201cThe women are in charge, my brother. We don\u2019t have to like it, but it\u2019s the law. I just ask Shelby what I want and she never lets me down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have to be careful here,\u201d Sean said. \u201cShe said she doesn\u2019t want to see me, talk to me. I can\u2019t show up at her house like some stalker\u2014she might call the cops. I\u2019d call her if I had a number, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr...you can try to figure out where she\u2019ll be. She\u2019s a nurse, right? Working as a nurse, right? So call all the places she might be working as a nurse. Hospitals, doctors\u2019 offices, clinics, you know. Ask to speak to her. They\u2019ll either say they never heard of her, say it\u2019s her day off or put her on the phone.\u201d</p> <p>Sean was stunned. \u201cWow,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s brilliant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd amazing, because I\u2019ve never hunted for a woman before,\u201d Luke said. \u201cOkay. Where do women go? Women like Franci? Shopping?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe did everything together\u2014camping, quadding, diving, skiing...We traveled anytime we could. Franci alone? Gyms,\u201d Sean said. \u201cFranci likes to work out. She loves to read\u2014she spent a lot of time in bookstores. She loves movies, but she wouldn\u2019t go alone\u2014we used to rent \u2019em. Back then, between me, work, the gym and a little shopping, I can\u2019t remember what she did with her time.\u201d And Sean thought, there it is again. I wasn\u2019t paying attention because it wasn\u2019t about me. He almost wondered how she had endured him that long, but fought the thought that struggled to surface.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s always a list for groceries on the kitchen counter,\u201d Luke said, nodding in the direction of today\u2019s list. \u201cShelby usually calls to see what we need when she\u2019s on her way home from school, but knock yourself out. Shop for groceries in her neighborhood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Yeah, I\u2019ll do that.\u201d And drive around places I might bump into her, Sean thought. Just in case.</p><p>Three</p> <p>Sean promised himself he\u2019d just drive around Eureka, but his car was like a heat-seeking missile and he soon found himself in Franci\u2019s neighborhood and then on her street. He had no intention of bothering her, just a fierce need to see how she was living without him. What was the harm in driving by her house?</p><p>Franci\u2019s house looked like something that should belong to her. It was cute, small, tidy, at least forty years old and very homey. It seemed the kind of comfy place a woman who wanted a family would choose\u2014a safe, friendly neighborhood, large trees and spacious yards. She had a curving driveway lined with some kind of fluffy green ground cover, flower beds that were just going fallow in the fall weather, and right outside the front door was a scarecrow and some gourds in a horn of plenty. It was pampered. Loved. A family home.</p><p>This was nothing like a house Sean would live in\u2014he tended more toward flashy, modern, low-maintenance homes; he had a lot of toys and liked to spend his time at play, not mowing lawns and shoveling snow.</p><p>His first panicked thought upon seeing the house was: Oh God! She has a man in her life! A man to settle down with! That\u2019s why it looks so cozy and domesticated!</p><p>He didn\u2019t slow down too much as he passed by; he didn\u2019t want to raise any suspicions. Having satisfied his curiosity about where she lived, Sean decided to check out the local recreational facilities.</p><p>Finding a gym Franci might like was harder to peg. There were several in the general vicinity. One was the Y, which was small but inexpensive and functional. There was a relatively large fitness center on the edge of town near the freeway. There was a women\u2019s gym, which would be obvious for any woman but Franci; she was ex air force and therefore used to working out with men. Fairly close to her house was a community center that appeared to contain a fitness facility, judging by the people wearing sweats and carrying gym bags who came out of the building.</p><p>As he drove past the various gyms, Sean noticed there were a few used bookstores and one big bookstore in the Eureka Mall. God, how he hated malls. But this might be the price of finding his girl, so he checked out the bookstore and the mall. While he was there he bought a couple of pairs of jeans, two shirts and a down vest as the fall weather was getting very brisk in the evening. And he bought a bunch of books he knew he\u2019d never read.</p><p>Sean located the grocery stores nearby\u2014there were plenty of those. He had a list of hospitals, clinics, doctors\u2019 offices and such to call. So he got himself a coffee and used his cell phone to call from his car while he sat in a grocery-store parking lot. But after countless calls there was no Francine Duncan to be found.</p> <p>Over the next few days Sean developed a new routine. He\u2019d leave Virgin River in the morning, drive to Eureka and make the rounds. He began to think of it as driving his circuit\u2014hitting her neighborhood followed by a trip past the gyms, mall, bookstores and grocery stores. As he\u2019d done on that first day, he\u2019d park somewhere to make his phone calls to clinics and such, checking them off one by one. At least it was turning him into a slightly better houseguest as he would bring home groceries for a change, saving Shelby the trouble.</p><p>He was only on his fourth day of hanging out in Eureka when he started wondering if the whole thing was a waste of time. He was beginning to think that even if he did get a number for her she would probably hang up on him, leaving him no option but to go over to her house, anyway. Would she call the cops if he did pay her a call? Was it a crime to knock on her door and ask if they could just talk? He wasn\u2019t going to beg or threaten\u2014just ask! Avon ladies and Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses did it all the time, and Sean was far less annoying!</p><p>But that fourth day turned out to be magic. Near the end of the day he hit the grocery store to pick up a few things. As he was choosing a head of romaine, he recognized the hand in the bin next to him. She was squeezing tomatoes. Now didn\u2019t that say something? That he\u2019d recognize her hand! He turned and looked at her. \u201cDon\u2019t make \u2019em go squirt,\u201d he said.</p><p>Franci jumped a mile. She dropped her tomato and clutched her jacket tight at the throat. \u201cGod, you scared me! What are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>He held up his produce bag. \u201cI have a list of things to get for my sister-in-law. But I\u2019m really glad I ran into you, Franci, because we\u2014\u201d</p><p>Before he\u2019d even finished talking she turned away from him, quickly selecting three tomatoes, then she tossed them in a plastic bag and tried to escape. He noticed she was wearing a navy-blue jumpsuit and matching jacket with some kind of unit patches sewn on the arms.</p><p>\u201cHey, are you in the coast guard or something? Why couldn\u2019t I find you after you left the air force?\u201d</p><p>She stopped, looked over her shoulder and said, \u201cI have absolutely no idea. I went to my mother\u2019s, where I lived and worked for almost a year before moving here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI left messages on your cell,\u201d he said, tossing the lettuce in his small handheld basket, following her.</p><p>She turned toward him. \u201cHow many messages? Because I never got any.\u201d</p><p>He was shaking his head. \u201cI don\u2019t understand that...\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow many?\u201d she demanded.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. A few. A couple. I don\u2019t know\u2014but I did,\u201d he said. It was coming back to him now\u2014the way she could poke him and get him all hot under the collar.</p><p>She could push him to be honest, and he hated it because he felt exposed. She smiled with mock patience. \u201cWell, Sean, I guess we had a technological malfunction. If you had really wanted to talk to me, you\u2019d have tried leaving more than a couple of messages a few years ago. Now, really, I have to get going. I\u2019m running late.\u201d</p><p>He grabbed her upper arm. \u201cI\u2019ve been trying to think of the best way to get in touch with you. I found your address, but no phone number, and I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know where I live?\u201d</p><p>He looked around a little nervously; she made it sound as if he was some ax murderer or something. \u201cLet\u2019s not get loud here,\u201d he suggested. \u201cI needed to find you. I looked you up on the computer. You bought a house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, for God\u2019s sake,\u201d she said, rubbing her temples. She seemed to gather herself from within. \u201cAll right. What do you want?\u201d</p><p>Now this was pissing him off all over again. \u201cGee, was I confusing you? I want us to have a conversation, maybe talk about what happened to us. I wanted to tell you that it didn\u2019t take me long to wish I\u2019d been more...more...cooperative when we had the argument that broke us up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, Sean, it did actually take you too long,\u201d she said. \u201cSo there\u2014consider your mission accomplished. You told me. Now, can you please go away and leave me alone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I can\u2019t,\u201d he said. \u201cSo I get it\u2014you\u2019re still mad. We can\u2019t really deal with that without talking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I said I don\u2019t want to!\u201d she stated, raising her voice again.</p><p>\u201cFranci,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cCould we try not to make a big scene here...\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook, I told you, I\u2019m in a hurry. You still using the same cell number?\u201d she asked. He nodded. \u201cGreat, I\u2019ll call you sometime. Now, excuse me, if you\u2019d please just leave me alone, I\u2019d appreciate it very much.\u201d Polite as that might\u2019ve sounded, it was stated angrily, and people had stopped shopping and began watching them.</p><p>She turned away from him and he grabbed her arm again. \u201cFranci, I am not going away. This is important.\u201d</p><p>Suddenly there was a very large shadow over both of them, and Sean, who was a little over six feet tall and in excellent shape, was looking up at Paul Bunyan. And Paul was not happy. He was scowling.</p><p>\u201cEverything all right, ma\u2019am?\u201d he asked, looking at Franci.</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d she said. \u201cOld boyfriend. Nothing to worry about.\u201d Then she focused on Sean. \u201cGoodbye. Great seeing you again. Now scram.\u201d</p><p>In a moment of temporary insanity, Sean went after her again. \u201cNo you don\u2019t. We have to get together for that conversation,\u201d he said. \u201cSince I can\u2019t call you, how about I go over to your house and wait for\u2014\u201d</p><p>He felt himself being plucked off his feet. His basket of produce went tumbling away as he was launched into a pile of melons. But Paul Bunyan didn\u2019t let go of him. \u201cShe said it\u2019s time for you to hit the road, bud.\u201d</p><p>\u201cListen, pal, you got it all wrong,\u201d Sean said. \u201cI\u2019d never do anything to\u2014\u201d</p><p>And suddenly Franci was there. Saving him. \u201cThank you, but it\u2019s all right. He\u2019s harmless.\u201d</p><p>Sean was being held down with his back against the cantaloupe and honeydew melons and he was suddenly incensed. That statement about him being harmless made him growl and snarl dangerously.</p><p>\u201cYou gonna leave the nice lady alone, bud?\u201d the big man asked.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re gonna get your hands off me this second or you\u2019ll be sorry,\u201d Sean warned, his very masculinity threatened. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI doubt that, my friend. So, when we understand each other, I\u2019ll let you up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d Sean angrily shot back. \u201cLet go of me. Now.\u201d</p><p>The lumberjack backed away slowly as Sean eased himself off the melons, many of them rolling around on the floor as he did so. A couple of them split open as they fell, spilling their slimy, seedy guts in the aisle. Sean brushed off his jacket where he\u2019d been grabbed, trying to appear both fearless and dignified. And then he took off after Franci, his hand on her shoulder to stop her from walking away again. \u201cNow look,\u201d he said.</p> <p>He felt the back collar of his shirt and jacket clutched in an iron grip and he whirled on the giant, hitting him square in the jaw with his fist. He suspected he\u2019d broken his hand, but no way was he letting on. He did wince in pain, however, while the very large man merely turned his brick of a face to the side.</p><p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t\u2019a done that, little man,\u201d the guy said. It took him roughly one second to draw back his fist and plaster Sean in the face hard enough to send him reeling into the melons. Then to the floor. Sean saw a lot of stars and was aware of the melons as they began to bounce around the produce section. And there was blood\u2014he wasn\u2019t sure where from since his entire face felt as if it had been through a meat grinder.</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d Franci shouted. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter with you? I told you to leave it alone, he\u2019s harmless!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo good deed goes unpunished, I guess,\u201d the big man said. \u201cIt looked like you needed help. Maybe you like being grabbed like that in the grocery store, huh, babe?\u201d</p><p>Sean muttered something about not being harmless and tried to get to his feet, without success. The big man said, \u201cJust stay down where you are, buster.\u201d But Sean was intent on getting up and he\u2019d just about made it to his feet when the man took two giant steps in his direction. That was all it took for Franci to launch herself on the lumberjack with a cry of outrage. She had her arms around his neck, her legs around his waist and screamed bloody murder while pummeling him on the back.</p> <p>\u201cI. Told. You. To. Leave. Him. Alone!\u201d she shrieked.</p><p>Paul Bunyan whirled around and around, trying to shake her loose, but she was on him like a tick on a hound.</p><p>Then the scene got a lot more interesting. \u201cNo! No! No! No! No!\u201d screamed a store manager, running up to them, followed closely by another man and a couple of young bag boys. A crowd gathered and the grocery employees peeled Franci off the lumberjack, but she was kicking her heart out the whole time. \u201cThe police are coming!\u201d the store manager yelled. \u201cStop this at once! Stop!\u201d</p><p>And Sean absently thought, This really isn\u2019t going how I planned.</p><p>Right about then, Sean attempted to stand and reclaim his manhood, only to slip on some slimy melon guts and crash into the floor again. He didn\u2019t exactly pass out, but he was on the nether edges, half listening to the conversation going on above him.</p><p>\u201cHe threw the first punch,\u201d a voice said.</p> <p>\u201cYou threw him in the melons!\u201d Franci yelled.</p><p>\u201cHe was grabbing your arm after you told him to go away and leave you alone! Shoot me for trying to lend a hand!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut then the little guy did hit the big guy,\u201d someone said. And Sean thought, I am not a little guy. I\u2019m definitely six-one. I bench two-fifty with no problem.</p><p>\u201cBut the big guy plastered the little guy, knocked him out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am not little,\u201d Sean mumbled through a swollen jaw, though no one was listening to him.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t ask you to protect me!\u201d Franci shouted. \u201cI told you to leave him alone!\u201d</p><p>Yeah, Sean thought. Because I\u2019m harmless. Just how I always wanted her to see me. Harmless. And that was Sean Riordan\u2019s last coherent thought.</p><p>The next time he was conscious, a paramedic was waving some disgusting-smelling ammonia under his nose and holding an ice pack to his cheek. The ammonia made him gag and the ice pack hurt like hell. And what was worse, they were all in handcuffs. \u201cDamn,\u201d he groaned. \u201cDamn, damn, damn.\u201d</p> <p>Three hours later, Sean was being held in a windowless room with a locked door down at the Eureka police station. The paramedics had recommended that he go to the hospital to have his head examined, to which Sean replied, \u201cWell, no kidding.\u201d</p><p>But while he was in the cell with his buddy the lumberjack, the big man apologized. Sean apologized right back. And what Sean learned was, Dennis Avery was not a lumberjack but a big rig driver who was on his way home, picking up some groceries for the little woman, when he got snared into that whole domestic between Franci and Sean.</p><p>So, as Sean was known to do, he told Dennis his life story. Or at least the part that had to do with breaking up with Franci.</p><p>\u201cMan,\u201d Dennis said, running a hand over his head. \u201cAre you an idiot or what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWatch it,\u201d Sean warned, though what he was going to do about it remained a mystery.</p><p>\u201cBuddy, I\u2019m six-five in my sockies. I been loading crates into a semitrailer for almost twenty years. And you swing at me?\u201d He laughed. \u201cYou got this little gal who throws herself on Goliath to defend you, because you pitched her out without thinking about it twice? No wonder she\u2019s pissed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you,\u201d Sean said irritably. \u201cShe gave me an ultimatum. We get married or she\u2019s gone.\u201d</p><p>Dennis stood to his full height. \u201cAnd you had to think about that?\u201d</p><p>Then, mercifully, the police sergeant was at the door. \u201cAll righty, boys. You\u2019re out of here. Somebody loves you and you got cited with misdemeanor public disturbance\u2014a pure gift. Be smart and make sure I don\u2019t see your faces again for a very long time. Like ever. In fact, a smart guy would get his groceries elsewhere, if you get my drift.\u201d</p><p>Sean didn\u2019t know why he should be so blessed, but he was taking the break without back talk. The last thing he wanted to do was call Luke and ask for bail money. After collecting his wallet, keys, cell phone, et cetera, he put on his jacket and made tracks, wondering how far it was back to the grocery-store parking lot to find his car. Meanwhile, Dennis Avery was calling his wife for a ride. Sean\u2019s head was pounding and his left eye was almost closed as he left the small cop shop, disappearing into the early evening night.</p><p>And there, leaning against her car, was Francine. She had a very disgusted look on her face. \u201cCome on, get in,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m taking you home. You can get Luke to bring you back for your car tomorrow, if you don\u2019t die in your sleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said that in a way that suggested you hoped I would die in my sleep,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be silly. I\u2019d like you to die much more violently than that. Now get in\u2014I don\u2019t have all night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d he said meanly. \u201cYou\u2019re in a hurry. How could I forget that?\u201d</p><p>Once they were both in the car, she said, \u201cYou\u2019ll have to give me directions. I\u2019m not sure where I\u2019m going.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust take me to my car,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s at the grocery store.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m taking you to Luke\u2019s,\u201d she said. \u201cYou can\u2019t drive after a possible head injury. You\u2019ve been enough trouble without weighing on my conscience anymore. Where am I going?\u201d</p><p>Sean sighed audibly. He really didn\u2019t feel up to fighting with her. \u201cSouth till you get to Highway 36, then east on 36 for about twenty minutes. I\u2019ll tell you where to turn off\u2014Virgin River is about ten miles off 36, kind of hidden away in the mountains.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been out on 36. Cute, how they call it a highway\u2014it\u2019s only a two-lane,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s harrowing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, all these mountain roads take some getting used to. This is very nice of you, Francine. Or is it revenge? You\u2019re going to push me out on a sharp turn?\u201d</p><p>She ignored him. \u201cHere\u2019s what I\u2019m going to do for you, Sean. I\u2019m going to give you my cell-phone number and you can call me. When I can spare some time\u2014like a half hour\u2014I will meet you for coffee. We can have this conversation you\u2019re set on. Maybe we\u2019ll straighten a couple of things out. After that, you are going to stop hounding me. Got that? Because I\u2019m in no mood for this bullshit. You\u2019ve had plenty of time to make up your mind about me and you were very clear. No commitment. No family. Now, I\u2019ve gotten on with my life, and if you haven\u2019t, it\u2019s time to do so. Understand?\u201d</p><p>What Sean understood was he now had thirty more minutes than he\u2019d had before. He\u2019d have to figure out a way to make good use of the time. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t supposed to be like this, Franci,\u201d he said softly. He hoped he said it tenderly.</p><p>\u201cAnd yet it is,\u201d she informed him.</p><p>After dropping Sean off at Luke\u2019s house, Franci headed back down 36, the darkest highway she\u2019d ever driven. She had plenty of time to think and admit that she had received his voice mails\u2014all two of them. The first one came while she was in labor, six months after they\u2019d parted ways, and he had said, \u201cHey, Fran! How you doing, babe? Give me a call. We should stay in touch, huh?\u201d The second one came when she was at home at her mother\u2019s with a ten-day-old baby, alternately nursing, walking the floor, sleeping and crying. That one was no better than the first. \u201cSo, Franci\u2014you gonna call me back? Come on, babe\u2014no reason we can\u2019t talk, is there? I wanna tell you all about the U-2. Gimme a call.\u201d That might explain her blind rage when the big guy in the grocery store casually referred to her as babe.</p><p>Back then Franci realized she was listening to those two calls over and over, alternately planning his death and praying he would come for her. She knew she was in trouble. After several weeks there hadn\u2019t been any more contact from him so, to save herself, she had the cell shut off and got herself a new number. She changed her e-mail address. Then she started looking for a new job and a path out of Santa Rosa.</p><p>She had always known, from the time she\u2019d said goodbye to Sean four years ago, that she would have to deal with him eventually. She wasn\u2019t sure exactly when or how, but she\u2019d thought she would have a little more time.</p><p>Her daughter, Rosie, three and a half and as precocious as an only child can be, had just recently asked, \u201cWhere is our daddy?\u201d Funny she would say our daddy, but then the whole concept was new to her as she had just noticed that they didn\u2019t have one. Preschool had its share of separated families, but almost all the other kids seemed to know where both their parents were. Most were being picked up alternately by their moms and their dads.</p><p>And Rosie hadn\u2019t asked who is our daddy, but where.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s flying a very fast, very high jet in the air force,\u201d Franci answered. \u201cIt goes all over the world and he\u2019s busy doing a very important job.\u201d</p><p>Rosie had said, \u201cOh.\u201d She probably didn\u2019t understand much beyond the important fact that Franci knew where Rosie\u2019s daddy was. But what Franci knew was that in a few months, maybe a year, maybe two, as her world became larger, Rosie would ask things like, \u201cWhat\u2019s his name?\u201d \u201cWhy doesn\u2019t he come to see us?\u201d And eventually, \u201cWhy aren\u2019t you married?\u201d These would be increasingly difficult questions to answer. And those questions formed the primary reason Franci had not wanted to face this\u2014she couldn\u2019t imagine how she would tell Rosie that her daddy just didn\u2019t want anything to do with her because he absolutely, positively did not want to be a father.</p><p>Franci didn\u2019t tell her mom about Rosie\u2019s question because her mother had asked her so many times how she intended to handle her situation. From the beginning Vivian had disapproved of this approach. \u201cFine, don\u2019t marry him,\u201d she had said. \u201cDon\u2019t have expectations of him. Don\u2019t be disappointed in his behavior. But he deserves to know he has a child.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Under any other circumstances, Franci would agree. \u201cMom, he was adamant! He did not want children. He didn\u2019t want marriage, either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll that has a way of changing when there\u2019s a child actually on the way,\u201d Vivian had said.</p><p>\u201cExactly,\u201d Franci argued. \u201cThat\u2019s why I want to handle this on my own, at least for now. Because I\u2019m only interested in marrying and having a child with a man who loves me as much as I love him, who wants our child as much as I do. Don\u2019t you get that?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOf course I get it. But, like it or not, when you accidentally get pregnant, you have a responsibility to tell the other parent and let the cards fall where they may. Deal with his response however you must, but you have to at least tell him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will. Eventually,\u201d Franci had said. The problem wasn\u2019t that she found the concept of informing him so unreasonable. It had just been that when she found out she was pregnant, and then when Rosie was a new baby, she wasn\u2019t emotionally strong enough to have Sean in her life. She\u2019d thought that, in time\u2014time that so quickly stretched into four years\u2014she would be ready to confront the reality without it completely disrupting her very existence. She knew what it could mean\u2014Sean rejecting Rosie altogether, and that would hurt too much to contemplate. Or, best-case scenario, an arrangement of his visits and, too soon, of Rosie going to spend time with him. Ultimately it could be Rosie spending time with Sean\u2019s new family, because eventually he would find the woman he could commit to. Being separated from Rosie was going to be so hard, and seeing Sean regularly? Seeing Sean happy with another woman would be sheer torture.</p><p>When she\u2019d seen him in Arcata, she should have made a date for coffee; she shouldn\u2019t have shut him down like that. But she just wasn\u2019t ready to face it yet.</p><p>To her own embarrassment, she had fantasized a reconciliation. But Franci was, above all, practical and logical. And if there was going to be a reconciliation, it would have come long before now. As well, it was a horrible prospect to imagine that Sean would decide that, since they had a child, he would do the right thing and be with the child\u2019s mother. Franci didn\u2019t feel like being a consolation prize now any more than she had when she was two months pregnant.</p><p>When she ran into him again at the grocery store, her anger with him had erupted out of surprise. If she\u2019d known she was going to see him, she would have been better prepared. Sane. Reasonable. But she hadn\u2019t been ready for him a second time.</p> <p>Ever since Rosie was born, Franci had assumed that eventually she would have to go to Sean, explain as best she could why she chose to have the baby alone. For her it was such a simple decision, though not an easy one. If he didn\u2019t love her enough to make a commitment before he learned about a child, she didn\u2019t want him just because there was a child. And yet, knowing herself and how powerful her feelings were for him, she feared saying no would have been impossible. And living in a marriage that wasn\u2019t real and genuine would ultimately be too painful...for all of them.</p><p>Right now, the most important thing was Rosie\u2014more important than Franci and Sean. Franci would have to take it slow, keep Sean from going off the deep end, make sure Rosie had a safe and normal life. They\u2019d start with a couple of talks, she and Sean. She\u2019d get him used to the idea that she\u2019d moved on, that she\u2019d accepted his decision to move on.</p><p>And then, when the groundwork was laid, Rosie would meet her dad.</p><p>Later that evening when Sean walked into his brother\u2019s house, Luke, Shelby and Art were just dishing up takeout from Jack\u2019s Bar. This was, of course, because Sean had failed to bring home the groceries. In he walked with a bruised cheek, black eye and swollen nose, which the paramedic said was probably not broken. None of it enhanced his killer good looks. Not to mention his hand, which he kept in his jacket pocket because he\u2019d have so much trouble gripping a fork.</p><p>Everyone turned when he came through the door and they went completely still, staring at him with wide eyes and open mouths. Finally Art said, \u201cHey, Sean. Didn\u2019t that girl want to date with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan we not talk about this, please?\u201d Sean asked.</p> <p>So the not talking about it hung over the dinner table like a shroud. While Shelby and Art did up the dishes, Sean took a beer out of the refrigerator, put on his jacket and stepped out onto the porch. About two minutes later Luke joined him, holding his own beer. There were five boys in the Riordan family. Luke was six years older than Sean and, when they weren\u2019t fighting, they were close.</p><p>Sean explained running into Franci in the grocery. After getting the story, Luke asked, \u201cSo, if I have this right, a great big hulk, who had about six inches and a hundred pounds on you, decided to protect Franci from you, and you attacked him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s about it,\u201d Sean said.</p><p>\u201cAnd why would you jump someone who was obviously bigger and stronger than you? You can usually talk your way out of anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause, Luke,\u201d Sean said. \u201cHe was trying to keep me away from her.\u201d</p><p>Luke thought about this for a second and then said, \u201cOh, boy. There\u2019s trouble, right there. What is it with this woman? Huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Sean said miserably. \u201cI thought I could just forget about her, but there\u2019s something about her. Maybe I was more into her than I realized.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd why, just out of curiosity, didn\u2019t you know you felt this way about her four years ago?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHow the hell do I know?\u201d After some silence, Sean finally said, \u201cI thought I had it all under control.\u201d</p><p>Four</p><p>A couple of days after the fight in the grocery store, Franci kept her word and made a coffee date with Sean. She needed to get this situation handled. When Sean showed up at the coffee shop, his face looked bad and his expression still worse. His cheek was bruised, his nose slightly misshapen, one eye blackened and closed more than the other\u2014which unfortunately didn\u2019t mar his otherwise good looks quite enough. And he was scowling. His right hand was wrapped in an Ace bandage, which Franci consoled herself was better than a cast, but still not good. He walked up to the small round table she occupied and frowned down at her, his eyes glittering through mere slits. She recognized that look. She hadn\u2019t seen it often from the perpetually playful Sean, but she had seen it. He\u2019s had enough, she thought. He was done fooling around. Time to ratchet these emotions down to a manageable level if she hoped for him to actually listen to her when she found the right moment to own up to everything. She needed him reasonable. Understanding. Sympathetic to her concerns.</p><p>\u201cAre you all right?\u201d she asked him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll live. Can I get you anything?\u201d</p><p>She lifted her cardboard coffee cup. \u201cI\u2019m fine, thanks.\u201d And then she took a deep breath while he went for his own coffee. When he sat down across from her, she asked, \u201cHow bad is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have a headache,\u201d he said irritably. \u201cIt\u2019s probably just a minor skull fracture with brain damage.\u201d</p><p>She struggled not to smile. \u201cDid you have that xrayed?\u201d she asked, indicating his hand with her eyes.</p><p>\u201cSprain. It\u2019s bruised and sore, that\u2019s all. You\u2019ll probably be very disappointed to know I\u2019m going to completely recover.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHm. Good. Well...I think we should both concentrate on not letting things get out of control.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou first,\u201d he said. He took a sip of his coffee and jerked his chin up, pinched his eyes closed and moaned deep in his throat. When eyes opened both were watering; he\u2019d burned his mouth. Oh, Sean was having a rough couple of days. Franci\u2019s hand covered her mouth so there wouldn\u2019t be even the hint of a smile.</p><p>And she immediately thought, Crap. She didn\u2019t want to find him cute and funny! She wanted to be repulsed by him! Furious and bitter! Completely unaffected, except maybe with some hatred. She remembered what had hooked her in the first place\u2014he was so good-looking and he made her laugh. Then later, when they were alone, he could make her beg. He could be darling and fun; he could be passionate and powerful. And she did not want to remember that!</p><p>She gave him a moment. He was probably blaming her for his burned mouth, too. \u201cSo, Franci,\u201d he finally said. \u201cWhat\u2019s up with the uniform you were wearing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI work for an emergency medical airlift unit, assigned to their helicopter transport.\u201d His eyebrows lifted. \u201cI\u2019m a flight nurse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess that\u2019s why I couldn\u2019t find you at any clinics or hospitals,\u201d he said, blowing on his coffee.</p><p>\u201cYou were looking for me at clinics and hospitals?\u201d she asked. \u201cSince when?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSince I ran into you in Arcata and you said you\u2019d prefer to never speak to me again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t exactly say that, did I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cClose enough. I found your address right away because you bought a house, but decided I\u2019d better take it slow, since you\u2019re obviously still pissed off. I thought it might irritate you if I showed up at your front door. Back when I knew you, you had a gun\u2014you were a military officer flying into a war zone. I was willing to brave that. That\u2019s how much I wanted to see you.\u201d</p><p>She sat back in her chair. \u201cI no longer have the gun. But when did you decide you wanted to see me again?\u201d she asked. \u201cWe bump into each other after years and everything changes for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere\u2019s how it went,\u201d he said without even thinking about it. \u201cWe both walked away mad back then. I distracted myself by going to a new aircraft, a new training program, a new base and squadron, but after a few months of that, I couldn\u2019t leave it alone anymore\u2014we ended badly and I couldn\u2019t believe it was what either one of us really wanted. So I called you. You didn\u2019t call back, so I tried again\u2014the cell phone was shut off. Your e-mail bounced back\u2014undeliverable. After another few months of licking my wounds I called your mother\u2019s house to see if she\u2019d put us in touch with each other and she was gone. Phone disconnected. House sold. Moved away. None of your best girlfriends were around at Luke AFB anymore and I couldn\u2019t remember their last names, so I had no one to ask.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou couldn\u2019t remember their names?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He grimaced. \u201cLast names. Shoot me. I didn\u2019t know there\u2019d be a test. So, you didn\u2019t respond and had disappeared. I thought maybe you got married or something. I quit looking. But it never felt right\u2014the way we broke up. It shouldn\u2019t have happened like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d she asked, sipping her coffee.</p><p>\u201cWe were both too stubborn. Angry. I wanted to find you and tell you that we should talk about our situation some more. Sanely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you changed your mind about commitment? About family?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cI was committed before,\u201d he said, his voice low and gravelly, definitely annoyed. \u201cI didn\u2019t need some document to prove that. That\u2019s why we should talk.\u201d</p><p>She sat back in her chair. \u201cI can\u2019t see what there is to talk about,\u201d she said, exasperated. \u201cThat\u2019s why we went our separate ways. I want the document. I want a family\u2014you don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wanted another chance,\u201d he ground out. \u201cI wasn\u2019t happy with you forcing the idea of getting married before I felt ready, before I felt it was my idea, too. But I was a lot less happy once you were gone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why didn\u2019t you say that in your messages?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He tilted his head, gave her a hint of a smile and lifted the eyebrow over the good eye. \u201cThe messages you never got?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Oh, he was good. Great choice for a spy-plane pilot. He was quick and cagey. \u201cOkay, I got them. They were so generic, there was nothing to respond to. Not, \u2018I\u2019m sorry and I want to try again,\u2019 or \u2018I can\u2019t live without you,\u2019 but just, \u2018Shouldn\u2019t we keep in touch? Babe?\u2019\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He leaned toward her. \u201cWell, what do you want from someone who\u2019s talking into ether, not knowing what kind of mood you\u2019re in? Or wondering who else might listen to your messages? Like maybe a brand-new boyfriend or husband! I wanted to talk to you, not make life tough for you! You were pretty specific when you laid down the guidelines\u2014it was marriage or you were out. For all I knew\u2014\u201d He stopped. He took a breath. \u201cFor all I knew you found someone who liked that idea. And settled down.\u201d</p><p>It was very tempting to just blurt everything out right then, right there, but Franci held her tongue. She did have to lower her eyes over her coffee cup to keep him from seeing the tears there. It all rushed back\u2014how bad the breakup had felt, and remembering that he couldn\u2019t bear the idea of being stuck with her for life. Then came the fear that he\u2019d like another chance, but they would probably only go back to the way they were. Or, he was ready for more now and would never forgive her for what she\u2019d done. Franci\u2019s mind was churning.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d given you a lot of opportunities, Sean. A lot of time. You didn\u2019t budge\u2014you\u2019d gotten as serious as you were going to get. I didn\u2019t want to find myself in a relationship as tenuous as that for a long time, for as long as it took you to say you\u2019d had enough and didn\u2019t want me around anymore.\u201d She swallowed. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to give my best years to a man who couldn\u2019t make a decision.\u201d</p> <p>He leaned toward her and his look was earnest, though battered. \u201cWhat did I ever do or say to make you think I was just playing around? Weren\u2019t we a couple? A serious couple? Didn\u2019t we practically live together? You thought I\u2019d just do that for a few years and then dump you? You didn\u2019t trust me any more than that?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cWhy would I? We spent nights together, Sean\u2014we kept our own places and you never suggested living together! You liked things loose and uncomplicated. You thought your buddies who got married \u2018bit the dust.\u2019 You thought the ones who had kids were trapped. I wanted something solid, and back then I wanted it to be you, but if it wasn\u2019t going to be you, I had to have the courage to move on. Right? Isn\u2019t that reasonable?\u201d</p><p>Rather than answering the question, he said, \u201cMaybe I\u2019m not that guy anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d she asked with a cynical tone. \u201cAnd what guy are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThings changed, Franci. Starting with not having you in my life. I thought I\u2019d just keep having fun, but fun wasn\u2019t fun without you. I thought the Riordan men didn\u2019t settle down, until I watched the last one I ever expected bite the dust...\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThere it is again\u2014he bit the dust.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019d seen him fight it, you\u2019d have been impressed. Bottom line, I was trying like hell to make it work without you because I thought I had no choice. And when I saw you at that restaurant in Arcata, I knew I wasn\u2019t going another day without trying to see if...I just want to see if we can work this out. If we can\u2019t, if you\u2019re in a different place, I\u2019m not a fool\u2014I don\u2019t want a woman who doesn\u2019t want me. But...\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust like I didn\u2019t want a man who didn\u2019t want me,\u201d she reminded him, lifting her chin proudly. Then, as an afterthought, she added, \u201cEnough. Didn\u2019t want me enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTouch\u00e9. You can have that one. I made a mistake. But so did you. I was an idiot. You were in a big goddamn hurry.\u201d</p><p>Well, he was right about that, she thought. She had been on the nest. She leaned toward him and shook her head. \u201cI had no possible way of knowing if you would ever change. I couldn\u2019t wait around for that. My biological clock was ticking.\u201d Boy, had it been ticking!</p><p>Again, rather than responding, he asked, \u201cAre you with someone now?\u201d</p> <p>She froze. In fact, she was. It had been a long time coming, too. But Sean\u2019s reappearance had caused her to barely give the guy a thought. It occurred to her to tell Sean she had a guy, just to back him off a bit. The temptation was equally strong to tell him there was no one, which might encourage him all the more. In the end, she said, \u201cI\u2019ve been dating...trying to be social rather than a recluse. You? Are you with someone now?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cLet\u2019s try again,\u201d he said in a soft, pleading voice. As if it had all been a minor misunderstanding.</p><p>\u201cNot so fast,\u201d Franci said. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I want to try again. We have issues. Unless you\u2019ve changed a lot, we don\u2019t want the same things out of a relationship, out of life. It\u2019s too late for couples\u2019 counseling. I\u2019m willing to think about us being friends, but we have to take even something like that very slowly. The world didn\u2019t just stand still after we parted ways, Sean. I went on living.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course you did, Franci,\u201d he said, reaching for her hand. He held it on the tabletop. \u201cWe both tried to get on with things, and both ended up back here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure we\u2019re not talking about the same things,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m sure your dating was a lot different than mine,\u201d she said, meaning he\u2019d slept with a lot of women. He\u2019d been a real playboy when she met him and she had been a little surprised when he became exclusively hers. Sean going back to his old ways of making the rounds was more what she had expected of him.</p><p>\u201cI dated,\u201d he admitted. \u201cNot anything very...Nothing worked out.\u201d</p><p>She lifted her chin. \u201cAnd I became very independent. I hadn\u2019t heard from you in years. I didn\u2019t see this coming.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s coming,\u201d he said, in a low voice laced with meaning. \u201cLet me take you out to dinner tonight.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m busy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTomorrow night, then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going out\u2014I have plans. I\u2019ll have coffee with you on Sunday afternoon, if you\u2019re free. I\u2019ll talk with you, Sean. Maybe we can put some of our conflict to rest and work out friendlier terms.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to spend time with you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou better let me think about that. There have been too many changes in my life to step back into a relationship like I had with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you thinner?\u201d he asked, changing the subject. \u201cYou seem thinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI took up running after...Once I moved up here, I started running. I finished two marathons.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo kidding?\u201d he said, impressed. He grinned, then winced and touched his cheek. \u201cWell, you look fantastic. I guess running is your thing. It works for you. And the hair\u2014if you\u2019d have said you wanted it cut to the scalp, I would have had a fit, but it\u2019s...it\u2019s hot, that\u2019s what it is.\u201d</p><p>She hated that she felt warm all over when he said that. \u201cI\u2019m completely different in a lot more ways than looks,\u201d she said as a warning. \u201cI have baggage that I\u2019ve accumulated in the past few years. I have commitments. For example, my mother and I moved up here together. She was widowed, I was single\u2014it made sense.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. How is Viv?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cGreat. Working in a family practice as a physician\u2019s assistant. She\u2019s glad she made the change\u2014she likes the area and has friends here. And I have two jobs, Sean. I pull a couple of twenty-four-hour shifts with the airlift unit in Redding every week and I teach a couple of courses at Humboldt University\u2014nursing courses. It\u2019s a great schedule for me\u2014gives me the time off I need so I can balance work life and home life. It works for me. I\u2019m committed to both.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re teaching nursing?\u201d he asked, surprised.</p><p>She nodded. \u201cI\u2019ve been doing that for the past year or so. Turns out I like it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy new sister-in-law, Shelby\u2014she\u2019s a student there, in nursing. Cutest thing you\u2019ll ever see. Best thing that ever happened to Luke. Any chance you know her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat year is she in?\u201d Franci asked.</p><p>\u201cFirst year. She got married in her first semester because Paddy and Colin were done with their deployments\u2014she waited for all the Riordans to be available. She\u2019s way younger than Luke and is just starting college.\u201d</p><p>Franci tilted her head and smiled, thinking how sweet it was that cranky, womanizing old Luke ended up with a sweet young girl who was determined to get an education. \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure I haven\u2019t met Luke\u2019s wife. Most of the freshmen are stuck in liberal-arts courses the first year. I teach one medical-surgical course and one that boils down to charting ER patients. I\u2019m just one of many instructors. Mostly, I teach juniors and seniors. I share an office on campus with another nursing instructor and I only teach a couple of days a week. Except for meetings, of which there are too many.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou never did go for the meetings,\u201d he said with a smile. \u201cI\u2019ll have to tell Shelby to introduce herself. You\u2019ll love her. You\u2019ll\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne thing at a time, all right?\u201d Franci asked patiently. \u201cHow\u2019s your mom?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s great. Greater since Luke got married and they\u2019re on the baby trail. She might finally get a grandchild out of one of us, after all.\u201d</p><p>Franci flushed. Oh, God, so many people were going to be pissed when they found out about Rosie. She had no idea how she\u2019d have done it differently, however. Well, there was that one way\u2014she could have told Sean about the baby. Good Catholic boy that he was, he\u2019d have married her right off or his mother would have killed him. As she recalled, Maureen Riordan had powerful influence over her sons. \u201cGood for her,\u201d was all she could say. \u201cSean, this is going to take time. Things have probably changed too much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot as much as they\u2019ve stayed the same,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s only one way I can even think about this, and that\u2019s if we get to know each other all over again,\u201d she said. \u201cWe can\u2019t go back four years and try to untangle that mess\u2014we have to accept ourselves as the people we are today, and go from here. You said you\u2019re not that guy anymore. And you know what, Sean? I\u2019m not that woman anymore\u2014the one who cried every day after we split up. I\u2019m a lot stronger. We\u2019re both different.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe so,\u201d he agreed. \u201cMaybe better,\u201d he suggested. \u201cBut, Franci, like it or not, we have history.\u201d</p><p>She felt her heart take a fearful jump. \u201cYeah. You have no idea.\u201d</p><p>As it happened, there had been a man in Franci\u2019s life for the past few months. Meeting Dr. T. J. Brookner had been one of the great perks to that little part-time teaching job she\u2019d taken at the college. He was a terrific guy\u2014a marine biologist and professor of oceanography. The forty-year-old was a divorced father of two preteen girls. Franci was one of the few certified divers in the nursing department and was the instructor with the most \u201copen time\u201d in her schedule, so she had been recruited to teach a short first-aid course to freshman dive students. Since she loved diving she jumped at the chance, which is how she met T.J. They ended up going on a couple of dive dates, which led to a few phone calls, which led to a few getting-to-know-you dinners, and what she found was an entertaining man who enjoyed many of the same things she did.</p><p>She liked the fact that he was ten years older than she; he seemed settled and he was definitely sure of himself. He had a stable career and was happy with where he was in life. She respected his parameters for a relationship: if they were intimate, they had to be exclusive, and while he was open to the idea of a long-term relationship, it had to be understood up front\u2014he wasn\u2019t having more children. After his second daughter was born, he\u2019d had a vasectomy and he steered clear of women with ticking clocks and the expectations that went along with it. As far as what he was looking for, Franci knew he wanted to meet a fun, attractive, intelligent and mature woman to spend time with. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Franci had no trouble signing on to that deal. It was nice to have someone to dive with, to go on long runs with, even to have sex with. Up to that point, Franci hadn\u2019t done any serious dating\u2014just the occasional evening out with a work colleague, or one of the guys from her running club. For the first time in a long time, she\u2019d been feeling content\u2014she had her little girl, her mom, a job she loved and a guy. What a relief it was to feel settled and on track!</p><p>Since Franci hadn\u2019t been associated with the college for long, the gossip about T.J. didn\u2019t reach her right away. She\u2019d already been going out with T.J. for a couple of months when she learned he was known as Professor Hottie by the coeds. She was completely amused by the nickname and teased him about it, but learned fast that he didn\u2019t think it was so funny. He said the girls flirted with him shamelessly and it was the sort of thing that could lead to irresponsible talk\u2014something that could cause a lot of trouble for a man. T.J. allowed that this kind of talk might have even contributed to his bitter divorce from a jealous wife years ago.</p><p>\u201cGood grief, I hope your ex-wife didn\u2019t cave into jealousy just because freshman girls have crushes on handsome professors! We all did. I had mine and I bet you even had yours,\u201d she added with a laugh.</p> <p>\u201cTrust me\u2014I never had an older woman professor who looked like you!\u201d T.J. informed her enthusiastically.</p><p>\u201cAw. That\u2019s sweet. You should just be flattered by the attention. Professor Hottie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am, as long as no harm is done,\u201d he admitted.</p><p>In all seriousness, he came by the nickname honestly enough; T.J. was divinely handsome and had a very sexy smile. Franci had no trouble admitting that his smile was the first thing to catch her attention. She immediately dismissed the giggles and rumors as predictable and didn\u2019t give them a second thought.</p><p>But then, just as Franci thought her life had begun to resemble something close to normal, who should show up but Sean? Now that she thought about it, Sean\u2019s timing had always sucked, and she had a little three-year-old redhead to prove it.</p> <p>Now, out of the blue, Franci was conscious of a little problem: When she thought of T.J., she wondered what they\u2019d find to do next weekend\u2014movie or dinner out or maybe a dive? But when she thought of Sean, all she wanted to do was take her clothes off.</p><p>When Franci told Sean she couldn\u2019t meet him on Saturday she didn\u2019t explain fully\u2014she had a date that night with T.J. But after Sean threw her world into a spin, she really wasn\u2019t in the mood for a date with anyone. And there was no way the date with T.J. could culminate in the usual way. She was much too distracted for that and considered canceling altogether. She complained to her mother of a headache.</p><p>\u201cTake something,\u201d Vivian said. \u201cRosie and I have a big slumber party planned at my house. Go out. Try having fun. Either stay out very late or have a slumber party of your own.\u201d Then she had winked.</p><p>\u201cOh, Mother,\u201d Franci said with humor.</p><p>\u201cTake a couple of aspirin and enjoy yourself!\u201d</p><p>Franci hadn\u2019t mentioned Sean\u2019s sudden reappearance in her life because she knew Vivian would work it like a hangnail. She\u2019d start all that business about Franci\u2019s responsibility to level with him; she\u2019d want to force the paternity thing. Franci was struggling enough by herself without Vivian nagging about it. So, more to keep her mother out of her business than to spend a nice evening out, she kept her date.</p> <p>T.J. came for her at six and, when she opened the door to him, she was immediately reminded why she\u2019d agreed to that first date\u2014damn, but he was a good-looking man. It wasn\u2019t hard to understand why there was always a long list of females waiting to go on dive trips, or on research missions, with him. It hadn\u2019t been that long since Franci had been a college coed. She\u2019d had a crush of her own on her biology professor. It hadn\u2019t gone anywhere beyond a few delicious fantasies, but if he\u2019d been game, she would\u2019ve crossed the line in a second.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m taking you to a fantastic new restaurant up near the campus,\u201d T.J. told her, once they were in the car. \u201cThey specialize in salmon for obvious reasons\u2014it\u2019s our local catch. They have a salmon fettuccini that will knock you out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know I don\u2019t like salmon,\u201d she reminded him.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the only diver and fisherman I know who won\u2019t eat salmon,\u201d he said. \u201cWill you try it? We\u2019re bound to find a salmon dish you love eventually.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you order something I like so we can trade if it doesn\u2019t work out that way?\u201d she countered.</p><p>He sighed. \u201cDon\u2019t I always order the best for both of us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She laughed. \u201cYou order two meals you like. There\u2019s no point in even showing me a menu.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you get enough to eat?\u201d he asked, a little irritation in his voice slipping through.</p> <p>\u201cOh, always. You\u2019re never stingy about it\u2014and I love the appetizers and salads you pick. By the time we get to your main courses, I\u2019m usually full, anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat sounds slightly ungrateful, if you ask me,\u201d he grumbled.</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely not!\u201d And she laughed. \u201cYou order enough for four people and I\u2019m always happy to let the doggie bag go home with you so you can enjoy it all over again! Really, T.J., you should review restaurants! Now let\u2019s stop arguing over the menu before we even get to the restaurant. Tell me about the trip to Cabo.\u201d</p><p>T.J. was more than happy to do that. As they made the quick drive north to Arcata, he talked about his recent diving trip to Cabo San Lucas. He\u2019d gone with a group of instructors and students. It wasn\u2019t clear from his conversation whether they\u2019d gotten all their research done, but they\u2019d had some great dives and had eaten at some fantastic Mexican restaurants. Altogether they had taken only sixteen students, twelve of them were women, he said.</p><p>And suddenly Franci asked, \u201cAren\u2019t you ever tempted to sleep with them? The female students who worship you?\u201d</p><p>He gave her a surprised look, which was followed by a huff of laughter and a shake of his head. \u201cFranci? What the hell? I thought we went over that.\u201d He grabbed her hand and gave it a squeeze. \u201cAre you serious?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCurious,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, was that offensive?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDepends on the reason for your question. Did you hear something? Some gossip about me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing like that,\u201d she said with a laugh. \u201cBut it must be difficult sometimes,\u201d she said. \u201cTo be a single man thrown into so many situations with young women\u2014like trips out of the country and on boats where you spend days at sea or anchored offshore. Probably surrounded by beautiful, nubile, irresistible young women who are sure you just walk on water and wouldn\u2019t even have to think twice about\u2014\u201d She stopped before she really became offensive.</p><p>He frowned and gave her hand another squeeze. \u201cIt might be, if I were interested in any of them. I\u2019m much more comfortable with women I can have a conversation with. I\u2019m not interested in being with a college freshman or sophomore who\u2019d be more than willing to help me lose my tenure.\u201d He glanced at her. \u201cJust in case you\u2019re thinking of dipping into that well, it\u2019s how you get fired. Messing with the student body\u2014so to speak.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, please,\u201d she said with a laugh. \u201cNot in a million years. But men are different.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot that different. This is so strange, coming from you. You\u2019ve never even brought it up before...\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure I have,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s apparently well-known around the campus that the girls are hot for you. And you are a bachelor...\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe careful you don\u2019t start to sound like Glynnis, the ex. She was obsessed by my female students, especially after she\u2019d had children and didn\u2019t feel as comfortable in a bikini.\u201d He grinned at her. \u201cFor a woman who\u2019s had a child, you sure didn\u2019t lose your bikini body!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s exactly what brought it to mind,\u201d Franci said. \u201cThat you\u2019re out of the country with a dozen beautiful, barely dressed eighteen-year-old women who think you\u2019re nothing less than a god, and...\u201d She cleared her throat. \u201cI would imagine it has its distracting moments...\u201d</p><p>He chuckled. \u201cYou\u2019ve never once asked me a serious question about how I handle that situation. Just so you know, I have to go to a lot of trouble to keep things on the up-and-up. I have an assistant or associate professor on hand at all times. I can\u2019t visit with female students in my office behind closed doors. If the door is closed for a meeting, a teaching assistant is right outside. On trips, everyone is assigned a buddy or two\u2014I only travel in groups. Seriously, the first time I touch one of them, she\u2019ll be the one to scream foul and get me fired.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut aren\u2019t you tempted?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m actually made of flesh and bone, Franci\u2014of course I\u2019ve been tempted. Not in the past several months, however,\u201d he added with a smile. \u201cNow what brought this on? You aren\u2019t jealous, are you? Are you worried about being completely safe with me? Because not only are we careful, I told you I\u2019ve been screened and I\u2014\u201d</p><p>She laughed uncomfortably. \u201cNot at all, T.J. It just occurred to me. You\u2019re back from a week in Cabo, had a great, fun time away from all the prying eyes, and I wondered.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m aware there\u2019s gossip from time to time and there doesn\u2019t seem to be anything I can do but ignore it. Believe me, if there was any truth to the rumors about my behavior with the young women on campus, someone would have caught me with my pants down by now.\u201d He laughed again. \u201cYou give me credibility. Having a steady woman with your looks and brains has slowed a lot of that idle bullshit down to nothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy pleasure,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cParanoia about all my potential affairs kept my ex-wife up nights, but it\u2019s pretty new coming from you. I\u2019m only human. But I\u2019m smart enough to know better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBronson married his student\u2014she was nineteen to his forty,\u201d she pointed out, speaking of another one of the professors.</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, that doesn\u2019t show so well on him. I\u2019d rather not be that kind of legend.\u201d He grinned at her. \u201cBesides, that\u2019s not what I\u2019m after. If you came with us on a dive trip, the only kind of talk you\u2019d hear would be about the two professors rocking the boat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat could be fun, T.J.,\u201d she said. \u201cOne of these days you\u2019ll throw out an invitation for me to go with you on a specific trip and I\u2019ll shock you by saying yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a deal!\u201d he returned enthusiastically. \u201cThe next good one, you\u2019re coming with me. With us,\u201d he amended. \u201cMe and the students.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere are you going next?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m putting together a trip to Kino Bay, Mexico\u2014a nice little shrimp town. I\u2019m saving you for a more exotic trip, so be patient. But before Kino Bay can be accomplished, there\u2019s a coral study to finish\u2014that\u2019s about five days offshore...\u201d</p><p>Having effectively kept the subject on him, Franci was able to listen more than she talked. They got to the restaurant, were seated right away and he ordered wine for them. He was the expert at that, as well, she thought, but she didn\u2019t mind. It seemed only moments before the salads arrived and T.J. was still second-guessing whether they\u2019d made the right choice for their appetizers. She hoped he wouldn\u2019t change his mind\u2014she didn\u2019t care if he ordered for her, but she hated it when he caused a lot of trouble for the waitstaff. Plus, she was looking forward to the crab-stuffed mushrooms; that and the salad might be all she enjoyed of this dinner. She really didn\u2019t like salmon, and to night T.J. had insisted upon it. But dinner out, for T.J., was a constant negotiation, a complicated ordering process. She got a kick out of it, but he took it way too seriously. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>As they ate, she listened to more details of his work, his plans for doing a coastal coral study with one of his classes that would take an intense five days off campus, and then in winter there would be a couple of dive trips out of the country to warmer climes.

Different.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cReally? Sorry.\u201d She sighed. \u201cWell, I was this close to calling you to cancel. I have a nagging headache. I know I\u2019m probably not the best company.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not only distracted, you\u2019ve brought up a couple of things you\u2019ve never even mentioned before. Like the girls\u2014the students. This isn\u2019t a symptom of a headache.\u201d</p><p>She looked into his beautiful brown eyes for a second. He had a slight smile and it made her laugh. T.J. was too intuitive for her mood to slip by him. \u201cI do have a headache. His name is Sean Riordan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d T.J. asked. \u201cDare I hope he sells insurance?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cHe\u2019s an air force pilot. I knew him when I was an air force nurse. I ran into him the other night while I was out with some girlfriends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh,\u201d T.J. said, sitting back. \u201cAnd can\u2019t get him off your mind?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou can say that again,\u201d she said, putting down her fork. Not only did she feel like getting this whole thing off her chest, she felt she owed T.J. an explanation. After all, they were a couple...\u201cI haven\u2019t told anyone this, T.J. Not my mom, not girlfriends, certainly not Rosie...\u201d</p><p>\u201cShould I be honored?\u201d he asked, lifting his wineglass to his lips, taking a sip. \u201cOr should I panic?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe is Rosie\u2019s father,\u201d she said, staring him straight in the eye. But then she glanced away.</p><p>He put down his wineglass. \u201cYou don\u2019t say.\u201d</p><p>She looked back. \u201cI always knew the day would come when I\u2019d have to face this, but I thought I\u2019d get to choose when and where. Just by chance he saw me a couple of weeks ago, chased me down and asked to buy me a cup of coffee. He said our breakup was a big mistake that happened to a couple of stubborn people, and that we should talk about things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, direct, isn\u2019t he? Obviously you didn\u2019t agree.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told him to get lost, but that was just my anger talking. I have no right to keep him away from Rosie. I\u2019m going to have to tell him about her, T.J. And I don\u2019t look forward to it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-oh. This doesn\u2019t sound good. When you said Rosie\u2019s father didn\u2019t know her, I always assumed it had been his choice to take off, ignore his responsibilities.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot exactly,\u201d she said, shaking her head. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t like that. But it wasn\u2019t a mistake, like he says. The mistake was us getting together in the first place. He always said he\u2019d never get married or have a family. I always said that\u2019s what I ultimately wanted for my life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, hell\u2014why were you with him, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. Because I couldn\u2019t resist him? Sounds like the pining of a teenager, doesn\u2019t it? I wasn\u2019t a teenager. And I had a wonderful time with him\u2014it was just the whole marriage and children thing he couldn\u2019t do.\u201d She shook her head. \u201cI knew either one of us would have to change our minds or we\u2019d part ways. My date of separation from the air force was coming up, Sean had accepted a change of assignment and we\u2019d been together almost two years. And guess what? I got pregnant. And being a nurse, I knew immediately. So I made him talk about what was next for us. Where were we going, as a couple. He said things like, \u2018You\u2019re getting out of the air force. You can go anywhere you want. You can move to where I\u2019ll be, or not.\u2019 It went downhill from there. I said I wanted to be married, have children, and he said, \u2018Me? Not in this lifetime.\u2019\u201d</p><p>T.J. swallowed. He looked down for a moment. He picked up his fork and poked at his food but didn\u2019t eat, a clear indication he was unhappy. When he finally did look up, he said, \u201cAnd you didn\u2019t tell him.\u201d It wasn\u2019t a question.</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cThe parting standoff was I needed to take the relationship to a committed level and he wasn\u2019t interested. I said that if it was possible he\u2019d never be ready, I should move on, and he said if I needed guarantees right then, I\u2019d better start planning my move.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, the man clearly knows what he doesn\u2019t want,\u201d T.J. said with an unmistakable sneer.</p><p>\u201cWe were both angry,\u201d she said with a shrug. \u201cI told him if he wasn\u2019t serious about a commitment with me, I was going to take the walk. He told me not to let the door hit me in the ass. We both said unforgivable things. I could have told him about the baby, T.J. I could have shouted it at his back as he was leaving. He probably would have done the responsible thing.\u201d Her eyes glistened and she swallowed hard. \u201cAnd I would never have known if...\u201d Her voice trailed off. She inhaled deeply, straightened proudly. \u201cI didn\u2019t want it that way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood God, Francine,\u201d he said. \u201cYou lied to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI always intended to tell him,\u201d she said. \u201cReally, I thought I\u2019d tell him when I found out she was a girl, then I couldn\u2019t. I thought I\u2019d tell him before she was born, but I was still so angry, so lonely. I planned to tell him right afterward, but he left me a couple of messages\u2014a couple of those arrogant, cheerful, we-should-keep-in-touch-babe messages, and I couldn\u2019t do it then, either. Next thing I knew, four years had passed.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head and frowned at her. \u201cYou should have told me this before\u2014you owed me that much if we were going to be involved. And you should have told him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know what, T.J.? I owe a lot of people a lot of stuff, but at the top of the list is Rosie. I owe her my absolute protection. Not just physical but emotional and psychological protection. I know Sean\u2019s going to be angry\u2014his mother\u2019s going to be very angry and, trust me, she\u2019s a force of nature. But, in the end, you know how much I meant to Sean? He let me go at the mere idea of a child!\u201d</p><p>\u201cListen, there are men who don\u2019t want children. But we still need to know the truth,\u201d T.J. said.</p><p>\u201cWhen Rosie was a new baby, just a couple of months old, I realized that I cried every single day. On and off for hours. I cried through the second half of my pregnancy and every day after she was born. And I made a decision\u2014I couldn\u2019t do that to her. If the only way Rosie could be raised by a happy, positive mother was to forget Sean Riordan, then that\u2019s what I would have to do. Yeah, Sean might\u2019ve been willing to do the right thing, but it wasn\u2019t what he wanted. Rosie and I\u2014we deserve to be loved and wanted. We deserve to never doubt it.\u201d</p><p>They sat quietly for a moment before T.J. replied. \u201cThis explains a lot. You\u2019ve always kept a part of yourself back. Tell me, Franci, just where did you think we were headed? You and me? Because your ex and I have a few things in common...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou and I aren\u2019t headed for any kind of standoff, T.J. We seem to agree on everything. Everything except salmon,\u201d she added with a smile. \u201cI thought it was only fair to tell you why I\u2019m a little distracted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s that headache?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cActually, not a lot better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I caught it,\u201d he said. \u201cI was very optimistic about where Rosie\u2019s sleepover at Grandma\u2019s was going to leave us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI should have canceled,\u201d she said, shaking her head. \u201cI can\u2019t invite you in tonight, T.J. I\u2019m just not in the right frame of mind.\u201d</p><p>He laughed a bit loudly. He leaned toward her. \u201cBelieve me, Franci\u2014tempting as you are, I\u2019m not getting in the middle of this situation. You work this out with the man, draw your single-parent lines in the sand, refine the details and, when you\u2019re all set there, we\u2019ll pick up where we left off. There is one more thing you might tell this guy, if you\u2019re going to be completely honest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHm?\u201d she asked, frowning.</p><p>\u201cTell him you\u2019re not over him.\u201d</p><p>She let a burst of laughter fly. \u201cAfter all he\u2019s put me through?\u201d</p><p>T.J. wasn\u2019t smiling. \u201cTell him you\u2019ve had exactly one man in your life since you took that walk. One guy, in that intimate way.\u201d</p><p>Shock was etched into her features for a moment. Then she attempted a recovery. \u201cYou don\u2019t know that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I know it. You were damned hard to warm up. I couldn\u2019t figure out what was holding us up. I had myself almost convinced it was Rosie, so young and all. But there was always a part of me that wondered what the hell was missing because I knew there was more passion in you. If you\u2019ve made up your mind that he\u2019s not going to screw up your life anymore, tell him and get this behind you,\u201d he said. \u201cThen when we\u2019re together, maybe we can turn up the heat a little bit. Because I like what we have together, you and me, but I don\u2019t want to be some platonic bed buddy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d she said, pure shock keeping her from laughing out loud. \u201cPlatonic bed buddy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want more than a Friday-night girl who, when she\u2019s with me, isn\u2019t really with me. I knew something was missing when we crawled into bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said, shaking her head. \u201cNo, we\u2019ve had a very nice\u2014\u201d</p><p>When she got to very nice, he did smile. She didn\u2019t go any further. Really, what man was looking for very nice sex? For that matter, what woman? And now the truth was out\u2014he blamed her. And she realized with a guilty flush that he might be right. T.J. barely stirred a spark in her, much less a flame. She felt as if she\u2019d cheated him.</p><p>Franci looked down at her half-eaten dinner. She couldn\u2019t meet his eyes with what she was thinking\u2014Sean had barely to caress her skin with his breath and she was on fire. He knew where to touch, how to tease, what to do, and nothing brought him greater satisfaction than to torture her with orgasm after orgasm. It had been like that with them since the first touch, the first night. They had never grown tired of each other\u2014never bored, never disinterested. And absolutely never just very nice. Their sexual relationship had never been anything less than magnificent.</p><p>She was conscious of T.J. lifting his hand toward the waiter, asking for the check, instructing him to box up their leftovers. She almost smiled\u2014there wouldn\u2019t be any coffee and dessert tonight.</p><p>With his hand on her elbow, T.J. escorted her toward his car rather quickly. As they walked down the sidewalk, Franci looked up to see a familiar figure walking toward them. His hands were plunged into his pockets and his head was down. Just as they were about to pass, he lifted his eyes briefly. Franci said nothing, gave no reaction, but managed to keep walking. She listened for his footfalls behind them, but there was no sound. She knew then that Sean had stopped dead in his tracks and was probably staring after them.</p><p>Afraid to turn around Franci sighed deeply. Ah, well. Now they knew about each other. And yet they didn\u2019t know anything at all.</p><p>The drive back to her house was twenty minutes of uncomfortable silence. T.J. sulked and Franci realized she might have risked losing the best shot at a stable relationship she\u2019d had in years. But maybe not\u2014according to what he\u2019d implied, she\u2019d risked it the first time she\u2019d crawled into bed with him and had proven to be a barely adequate lover. What she hadn\u2019t quite admitted until tonight was that it wasn\u2019t all it could be for her, either. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Finally, T.J. pulled into Franci\u2019s driveway. When he walked Franci the short distance to her door, he said, \u201cRemember our agreement, Francine. We\u2019re exclusive. I have a feeling you\u2019re forgetting that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI remember our agreement...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want you to give me your word that you\u2019re going to take care of this matter. Get this guy together with his kid, if that\u2019s what he wants. And then tell him you\u2019re involved with someone.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m planning to take care of this situation the best I can,\u201d she said. \u201cI guess it\u2019s best if you just give me a little time to work out the details.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t take too long. I\u2019m not that patient.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you for the dinner, T.J. Sorry it ended on such a negative note.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me know when you get this worked out with Rosie\u2019s father. And try to be smart, Francine. You may have run into him here, but he\u2019s not hanging around. Not for you, not for Rosie. Get rid of him. When that\u2019s done, let me know. Don\u2019t make me wait too long. When he\u2019s gone, we\u2019ll have a second chance.\u201d Then he leaned toward her, gave her a platonic kiss on the cheek. \u201cYou\u2019ll be fine. Just do it.\u201d</p><p>And after looking deeply into her eyes for a long moment, he got into his car and backed away.</p> <p>Five</p><p>Tonight was the third time the completely impossible happened\u2014Sean ran into Franci on a random street in a small town. At loose ends, he\u2019d decided to go back to that bar where he\u2019d seen her the first time, just on the off chance he\u2019d meet her again, even though he knew the odds were slim. Before he even got inside the bar, he saw her walking down the sidewalk, a man guiding her along with a hand on her elbow. And he carried a take-out sack; they\u2019d already had their dinner.</p><p>He considered this sighting some kind of miracle. It was meant to be.</p><p>He watched them walk down the sidewalk and turn the corner. He stood there like an idiot for a few moments and then, knowing it was wrong on every level, he headed back to his own car to follow them.</p><p>He had no way of knowing what was next on the agenda for Franci\u2019s evening, but if that had been him walking her away from a restaurant, the night would just be getting started. He had an overpowering urge to know if Franci had moved on, if she had found love in her life...if it was time for him to disappear for good.</p><p>By the time he reached his vehicle he was too late to spot the make and model of the man\u2019s car. He couldn\u2019t follow them now, which was probably a blessing. But because he was unsuccessful in talking himself out of it, he drove to Eureka\u2014to Franci\u2019s street. When he got there he parked across the street, a couple of houses down, and killed the lights. He sat there for a moment. Well, this was just what he deserved\u2014the joke was on him. Her house was dark but for the front door light, and there was no car in the driveway, nor on the street in front of her house. If there was more to Franci\u2019s evening, it wasn\u2019t happening here.</p> <p>Just then a car slowly pulled up the street and into her driveway. Sean watched as the man got out of the car and went around to her side to open her car door. He guided her up to the door and Sean thought, If they go inside, I have to find it in me to drive away. Like she said, neither one of us stopped living. She deserves the same option to move on that I took for myself.</p><p>He told himself that, but it didn\u2019t feel right.</p><p>Then he watched as the man spoke to her, then gave her a brotherly kiss on the cheek and left. Sean\u2019s mouth hung open as Franci stood in the glow of her front door light, watching her date leave. And finally Sean\u2019s head fell forward onto the steering wheel.</p><p>Now he really had to make himself drive away! He shouldn\u2019t be here in the first place, and he definitely didn\u2019t have the right to push himself on her now! This could ruin any efforts he made at reconciling and he damn sure wasn\u2019t going to\u2014</p><p>Tap-tap-tap at the window completely interrupted his attempt at sanity. He looked up and there was Franci, smacking his car window with a key. He brought down the window.</p><p>\u201cNow you\u2019re following me?\u201d she asked, outraged.</p><p>\u201cNot exactly,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. You know I\u2019d never scare you on purpose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t scare me, Sean! I think you\u2019re an idiot!\u201d she said, turning to walk back across the street to her house. She stopped in the middle of the road and, over her shoulder, she said, \u201cYou are a truly clumsy spy! I saw you in Arcata! I saw your car when we turned onto my block! I know your car, you dope, from when we met for coffee!\u201d</p> <p>Sean jumped out and went after her. When he was right behind her, he asked, \u201cIs that why you sent your date away?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d she said. She kept walking. \u201cI said good-night, just as I\u2019d planned! And what were you going to do if I\u2019d invited him inside? Pound on the door? TP the yard?\u201d She got to her door, stuck her key in the lock and turned it.</p><p>\u201cI was going to leave,\u201d he said in his quiet voice. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t going to be easy, either. But I knew it was wrong to come here, to watch your house, to spy on you. It was bad and wrong and I\u2019m sorry\u2014and I couldn\u2019t help it. I\u2019ve never been like this before.\u201d</p><p>She turned and faced him. \u201cLike what? Nuts?\u201d</p><p>He nodded. Then he grinned that Sean grin that melted her, even though he had a black eye and a weird-looking nose.</p><p>\u201cI know good doctors,\u201d she said. \u201cWe can get you medicated for that.\u201d</p><p>His hand came up to cradle her jaw, his fingers reaching into her short hair. \u201cBefore we do that, let\u2019s just talk about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want from me, Sean?\u201d</p><p>He moved still closer, leaning down, his mouth just barely above hers. \u201cI want you, Franci. I shouldn\u2019t have let you get away.\u201d</p><p>Tears gathered in her eyes. There was a time she\u2019d have given anything to hear that! Oh, who was she kidding\u2014she still wanted to hear that! And tonight was one of those very vulnerable nights! She had just been informed by Professor Hottie that she wasn\u2019t very exciting in the sack. She had tried to be with someone who was right for her, and it obviously hadn\u2019t been working all that well. \u201cWhat if it\u2019s too late?\u201d she asked in a whisper.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t we have to know?\u201d he asked. \u201cDon\u2019t we both have to know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMost of the time I think I\u2019d be happier not knowing...\u201d</p><p>But instead of speaking, he lowered his lips to hers. He slipped an arm around her waist, pulling her against him, and kissed her. And there it was\u2014the feelings that rose up in her instantly! With a defeated moan, she melted to him and opened her lips under his.</p><p>Franci had what can only be described as a flashback, an out-of-body experience, while Sean\u2019s lips hovered close to hers. As he held her there, their mouths slightly open, breathing each other\u2019s warm breath, images from another time and place filled her mind. It usually came to her in the form of dreams that left her moody for half a day. She felt herself wrapped in his old red sweater, the one she kept at her apartment for cold nights, the thing steaming with his scent, his musk. She heard their laughter as she chased him down a ski slope and he made away; laughter as they played in the lake, splashing each other; in bed after satisfying lovemaking, still wrapped around each other. Scenes popped into her mind\u2014standing in his kitchen, fluffing up a big salad while he turned steak or fish on the grill; washing their cars in his driveway; working together to put fresh sheets on the bed; sitting by a fire in the vast Arizona desert, talking softly under a million stars in an endless black sky. She imagined herself in his arms, just like now.</p><p>Once, when they\u2019d been skiing in Colorado, her lips were so chapped and cracked, she didn\u2019t dare smile. She told him that if they made love, she couldn\u2019t use her lips in any way. He told her to lie down on the bed and close her eyes. He began to smooth healing bag balm salve across her lips in long, slow, careful strokes. Not just enough to coat her poor lips once, but over and over and over for long minutes, a lip massage, until they had become as soft and plump as a baby\u2019s butt. He didn\u2019t stop, but kept stroking the salve on her lips, putting her in a trance. Gently, sweetly, perfectly, healing her, taking care of her. Sometimes when she dreamed or remembered that, she felt hypnotized; sometimes it caused her to wake up crying out for him. Remembering all of this and more, and feeling it now, she was in a deep state of longing.</p><p>And she was utterly lost.</p><p>\u201cI am so screwed,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cNot quite yet, you\u2019re not,\u201d he whispered back.</p><p>\u201cSean, don\u2019t do this...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want you,\u201d he whispered against her opened lips. \u201cSo. Bad.\u201d</p><p>She tried to pull herself out of the dream because she knew they should be talking, but it wasn\u2019t working. This happened to her sometimes in an actual dream, her refusal to wake up because it felt so good to feel her skin against his skin. But she managed to shake her head weakly and whisper, \u201cNot a good idea.\u201d</p><p>But he just lingered there, lips to lips, bodies held comfortably close, and the irresistible memory that came was how much Sean loved pleasing her in bed, how committed he was to her pleasure. It was as if his own satisfaction was secondary. How he would tease her, tell her she took advantage of him; that just because he was accommodating didn\u2019t mean she had to be such a glutton about it. In the aftermath, in laughter, he would say things like, Oh, that\u2019s right, if I make you come twice, you\u2019ll let me have one.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t remember him ever once suggesting she was holding back, that she needed more warming up.</p><p>She felt herself growing soft and moist. And weaker by the moment.</p><p>Then he went in for the kill, covering her lips in a powerful and familiar kiss that left absolutely no doubt that he meant business. And she yielded completely. She didn\u2019t know he was going to do that, though she should have. She certainly wasn\u2019t prepared for it, for which she had no excuse, and suddenly all she had in her was acquiescence. She had needed him so much, for so long. His breath came in and out through his nose roughly and she could barely breathe at all. His big hands ran up her back while her arms slowly, cautiously, rose to circle him, join the embrace.</p><p>The kiss was long, deep, delicious, hard. Her lips opened; his opened. It was his best demanding kiss, as she remembered it; he was pushing her back against the front door and she pulled him against her harder, making small noises that did not sound like protests. She was pressed to him tightly and one of her hands crept up his neck to the back of his head, holding him against her mouth. She was actually counting the seconds, then lost count and started again. It felt like a ten minute kiss. She couldn\u2019t stop. And she couldn\u2019t take this back, couldn\u2019t pretend she wasn\u2019t in the mood or had decided it was a bad idea. This was it\u2014her statement. The truth was out. She wanted him every bit as much. Then he reluctantly pulled back.</p><p>\u201cLet me come in,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cThat guy who just left. That\u2019s the guy I\u2019ve been seeing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care. I\u2019m going to take you away from him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have issues to sort out...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, and about a lifetime to do it in. Franci, Franci, for just a little while, let\u2019s think about all the things that are right with us, and not the few things we couldn\u2019t agree on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t just a good-natured little debate,\u201d she reminded him. \u201cIt was so major it caused us to\u2014\u201d</p><p>He came down on her mouth hard, pushing her back, taking her mouth with power. She counted the seconds till she couldn\u2019t resist him and then opened her lips, letting him inside. He slipped his hands inside her coat and ran them slowly up her ribs. Her coat open, he pushed her against her own front door with the length of his body, and the press of his arousal right at the V of her legs caused her some serious amnesia. Maybe it was a disagreement, one that wouldn\u2019t be so debilitating now. Whatever it was\u2014she needed him. Needed. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>And as had happened only with Sean, acquiescence turned to throbbing hunger. He could make her crazy with desperate desire.</p><p>He turned with her in his arms, never releasing her lips, and opened the front door, allowing both of them to move right into her house. He closed the door behind them with a bang and pressed her against it on the inside.</p><p>Oh, boy, she remembered this trick. If there was anything as likely to weaken her as taking her to bed, it was pushing her up against the wall. Something most men didn\u2019t have a clue about, Sean had perfected. And she clung to him. He ground against her and she gyrated her hips against him, knowing there would be no turning back now. Sean had an unfair advantage; their sex life had been incredible.</p><p>In the distance, she heard Harry whine, then growl. It wasn\u2019t like Harry to growl...</p><p>\u201cFranci?\u201d he whispered against her lips. \u201cDo you have a dog?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh. Harry. Little guy. It\u2019s okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHm,\u201d Sean answered, going after her lips again. His hands ran smoothly over her bottom to her thighs and he lifted her up. Her legs wrapped around his waist, and he held her there, moaning his approval, slipping his hands under her purple dress to hold her perfect ass. He loved that dress; it felt as silky under his hands as it looked on her body...and he was going to get rid of it as soon as possible.</p><p>The growling intensified. Then there was an angry bark and snap just as Harry sunk his teeth into the back of Sean\u2019s leg.</p><p>\u201cArrrggghhh!\u201d Sean rumbled, pulling back sharply, jumping in surprise and shaking one leg, interrupting and disturbing some totally perfect foreplay. \u201cJesus!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d she whispered, breathless.</p><p>He looked over his shoulder at the dog. \u201cDon\u2019t do that!\u201d he yelled at Harry, causing him to back up and whimper a little. Then he turned back to Franci. \u201cWhere\u2019s the bedroom?\u201d</p><p>She tilted her head. \u201cDown the hall, first door on the left,\u201d she said weakly. He carried her like that, his big hands under her butt, her legs wrapped around him, down the short hall to her bedroom. He limped slightly. Just inside the bedroom, he kicked the door closed, locking the dog out. He peeled off her coat, dropping it to the floor, then he fell with her on the bed, still crushing her to him, still possessing her mouth. Without releasing her lips, his jacket joined her coat on the floor. In the back of her mind she knew she wasn\u2019t supposed to be doing this. But in the front of her mind, this was perfect. He felt absolutely perfect. And she was so hot that if anyone tried to stop her now, she might tear them limb from limb.</p><p>It had been a long time since she\u2019d been this person. Of course, the last time had been with Sean, which partially explained this time. As she ran her hands over his chest, shoulders, arms, back, she couldn\u2019t get enough of him, couldn\u2019t get him close enough, and she began pulling at his shirt. She tugged it out of his pants and pushed her hands underneath to caress his naked chest. His pecs were hard, his belly flat; there was a soft mat of hair. Her fingers teased his nipples and brought them into hard little bullets. She was panting, gasping, biting and tugging gently at his lips. She had become completely wild with absolutely no concept of how this was possible just minutes after she had suggested this was a bad idea. But it didn\u2019t matter\u2014she grabbed the front of his shirt and tore it open, sending the buttons flying, pinging off various surfaces around the room.</p><p>\u201cWhoa,\u201d Sean said against her lips. He let the shirt fall off his shoulders, then tugged her dress up. He sat back on his heels between her spread legs, pulled her to an upright position and worked that purple dress up and up, over her head and away. His hands went to her panties...</p><p>Her hands were on his belt buckle while his fingers tested the elastic of her very tiny panties. They came off faster than his belt buckle opened; she found herself kicking out of them crazily, frantically. Then she went after that belt again and it wasn\u2019t moving. She whimpered her need to get past that belt, that zipper.</p><p>\u201cEasy,\u201d he whispered. \u201cEasy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf it was easy, you\u2019d be naked,\u201d she returned, her breath coming unevenly.</p><p>Sean chuckled. \u201cHang on,\u201d he said, giving her a hand and getting out of his jeans. All their clothes were suddenly flung around the room and they were pressed together, naked, hot and panting. His lips went to her breast, his tongue teasing a nipple into life, while her hand immediately coiled around him and he shuddered, groaning. Mouths together again, bodies pressed tight, he slipped a hand lower. His fingers glided smoothly into her and she ground against his hand. \u201cYeah,\u201d he groaned appreciatively. \u201cOkay. Okay. I just need a second, honey. Hang on.\u201d</p><p>He rolled away from her and grabbed his jeans off the floor, shaking out his wallet, sifting through it quickly, locating a condom.</p><p>In that moment that he wasn\u2019t touching her, Franci froze. Her dark eyes were wide, her body suddenly growing cool in his absence. Temporary sanity. She noticed a picture of herself and her daughter on the bureau across the room and pinched her eyes closed, pulled her legs back together. She couldn\u2019t go through with this, no matter how much...He never forgot the condom; he didn\u2019t want children. Well, he forgot it that once...How can I let this happen?</p><p>But then he was back, against her, covering her with his large, warm, hard body. He grabbed her wrists, pulled her hands over her head to hold them there, gently parted her legs with a strategically placed knee and claimed her lips. Ah...she thought. That\u2019s what she remembered\u2014that mouth, those lips, all that feeling. Sean. Passion. Hunger. She let him kiss her, let his tongue enter. But her response had cooled; she was worried about what she was doing!</p><p>Sean left her lips and rose above her, looking into her eyes. \u201cUh-oh,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re thinking. All of a sudden, you\u2019re thinking.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThis shouldn\u2019t be happening now,\u201d she whispered weakly.</p><p>\u201cOh, it\u2019s happening,\u201d he said. \u201cBelieve me, it\u2019s happening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis will make sorting everything out even harder,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cFuck the problems for a little while. Stop thinking. Go back to that other place, where you were just wanting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure I can,\u201d she said, giving her head a little shake.</p><p>He touched her lips softly, then harder. He traced them with his tongue. \u201cSure you can,\u201d he whispered. \u201cNobody wants like you do, Franci. Work with me here.\u201d He possessed her mouth, then his fingers found her most vulnerable spot between her legs and a delicious moan escaped her as she lunged her hips toward him. Amazing, she thought, how Sean\u2019s skillful mouth, his talented hand, could completely numb her mind and quiet the chatter. He let go of her wrists; his lips found her breast and, with precision, he entered her in one long, deep thrust that made her gasp and push back against him to bring him home.</p><p>\u201cGod,\u201d she said in a breath. \u201cOh, God, oh, God.\u201d Her hands were on his back, holding him tightly against her, running up and down in slow, rough caresses. She grabbed the hard muscles of his butt and pulled him against her, into her, hearing him groan. Every nerve ending was on fire; there was a longing inside her that needed to be taken care of right away. She did exactly what she thought she couldn\u2019t\u2014she stopped thinking and let her body take over, bucking beneath him, moaning, whimpering, clinging to him, riding with him in a powerful, stormy, wild pumping that teased the deepest part of her into a hunger so strong, it robbed her of breath. She gasped, wanting and craving and needing. She wrapped her legs around him, scraped her nails down his back and felt the tension shatter inside her, bathing her in a blinding, pulsing heat that flowed from her core to every extremity.</p><p>\u201cAhhhh,\u201d he sighed. \u201cOh, honey,\u201d he whispered so softly she barely heard. \u201cOh, baby, that\u2019s the way...\u201d And then he took his\u2014thrusting into her hard, letting it go, throbbing with his own pleasure.</p><p>Then she fell limp, satisfied, a pile of stress and yearning that had gone all soft and weak beneath him. A small laugh escaped her. Something about a fabulous orgasm always made her laugh a little.</p><p>Really, she hadn\u2019t had one like that in a good four years.</p><p>\u201cFunny?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cNot even,\u201d she said. Then she laughed again, softly, lightly. \u201cI suddenly feel so good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo kidding,\u201d he said, and he rolled off her carefully, lying beside her, spent.</p><p>He dashed off to the bathroom to dispose of the condom, then was back, holding her again. They were quiet for a few moments. Then Franci turned onto her side, raised up on an elbow, looked down into his handsome green eyes and said, \u201cNow, we can\u2019t do that again. We have to sort out our issues.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Jesus,\u201d he said. \u201cWhy me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy you, what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t the best time to become completely irrational,\u201d Sean said.</p><p>\u201cWell, I don\u2019t think I\u2019m irrational at all, but why do you say that?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re naked,\u201d he answered. \u201cWe\u2019re naked after the best sex either one of us has had in a long time, and we should be cuddly. You used to want to be cuddly. What\u2019s wrong with you?\u201d</p><p>She frowned at him. \u201cHow do you know that\u2019s the best sex I\u2019ve had in a long time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou tore my clothes off. You left scars on my back.\u201d He smiled at her. \u201cJust an observation, hardly a complaint.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell...actually...Oh, never mind, it\u2019s really not your business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour dog bit me,\u201d he said. \u201cI think he severed my Achilles tendon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you,\u201d she went on, \u201cI didn\u2019t stop living when you told me to hit the road,\u201d she said, ignoring his accusation about her cocker spaniel.</p><p>\u201cFranci, Franci, that isn\u2019t what I did. You said you were leaving\u2014I said fine, if that\u2019s the way you feel. Come on, not now. Not tonight. And it doesn\u2019t matter if you had sex with someone. Or with a hundred\u2014Forget I said that. I don\u2019t want to think about this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t sleep around like you do,\u201d she said, curling against him. \u201cWe can\u2019t do this again,\u201d she said, but she made no attempt to cover herself and neither did he. They lay there, snuggled, nude, in post-coital rapture.</p><p>\u201cI think we can do it again before morning,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cNo, this isn\u2019t going to work. We\u2019re not lovers, Sean. We\u2019re ex-lovers. That\u2019s why that went so well. That\u2019s all it is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI doubt that\u2019s all,\u201d he replied.</p><p>\u201cOh, that\u2019s all. You and I had pretty much perfected it by the time we split up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWanna bet?\u201d he asked, covering her body with his. \u201cWe had it perfected the first time. I remember, and so do you.\u201d</p><p>Damned if he wasn\u2019t right. She couldn\u2019t see her way out of this mess.</p><p>\u201cWe do have one little problem. I had that one condom, just for safekeeping. I don\u2019t have another one.\u201d</p><p>She sighed in resignation that came too easily. \u201cI might have a couple.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s my girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t get your hopes up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBaby, everything is up.\u201d</p><p>Great sex not only made Franci feel good, it made her very sleepy. They made love twice more. Softer and sweeter and slower, but just as mind-bending. They spent hours making love. Then she pushed herself up against Sean in a way that was at once brand-new and very familiar. She used to sleep with him this way\u2014her back up against his front, her head on his arm while his lips bothered her neck. He used to pull her long hair aside to kiss, lick and suck on her neck, but there was no hair to get in his way now. His arm was draped over her waist, his hand capturing her breast. She felt, for the first time in such a long time, like she was in the right place at the right time. But probably with the wrong man. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Morning would be soon enough to feel guilty and stupid. So, she slept.</p><p>\u201cWere you ever lonely, Franci?\u201d he asked in a whisper against her neck. \u201cWithout me?\u201d</p><p>Her eyes popped open, but she kept her breathing even, pretending to be sleeping.</p> <p>\u201cI never thought about it, about being lonely without you,\u201d he whispered. \u201cBut I kept wondering why I was so empty.\u201d He kissed her neck. \u201cI looked for you in so many women and never understood why it didn\u2019t work. Never understood it was because I loved you.\u201d</p><p>She pinched her eyes closed against a tear.</p><p>He sighed deeply, pulling her close against him. \u201cI want to take you to the Alps to ski\u2014we used to talk about doing that. Remember? And I want to go with you to Aruba, to dive and lay on the beach. We\u2019ll get one of those huts on stilts\u2014we\u2019ll make love outside.\u201d</p><p>She heard him yawn deeply; he kissed her neck again.</p><p>\u201cI thought eventually I\u2019d get over you. I didn\u2019t know I\u2019d never get over you because I loved you.\u201d</p> <p>And then the talking stopped and she heard his light snore. Very softly she whispered, \u201cYes, I was lonely. You have no idea...\u201d</p><p>At six-thirty in the morning, amazed to have slept so well, Franci slipped out of bed. She showered, toweled her short hair, pulled on jeans and a T-shirt. She stepped out of the bathroom to see Sean lying on his stomach, one arm dangling off the bed, the sheet pulled over his head and shoulders, but one long, muscular leg and his naked butt peeking out. The shower hadn\u2019t even disturbed him; he was out cold. She shuddered. She\u2019d completely worn him out. She hadn\u2019t had sex like that in more than four years. That wasn\u2019t exactly their typical lovemaking, but then there was no typical with Sean. It could be wild. Or sweet. Daring. Luxurious. It was never the same old thing. And it had always been whatever Franci needed at the time.</p><p>He had probably the nicest butt she\u2019d ever seen, and some unattractive scratches on his back. There was also the perfect imprint of a small canine mouth right on his Achilles tendon. She shivered again. Oh, boy, she thought. I have really screwed this up. Now everything is about ten times more complicated.</p><p>She remembered a time she\u2019d been so grateful to meet a man with whom she shared that kind of powerful chemistry. Now she was pretty sure she was cursed.</p><p>She turned the picture of her with Rosie facedown on the bureau before leaving the room.</p><p>She\u2019d have to get him up, have a little talk with him before she went to fetch Rosie. Franci\u2019s nerves were getting the best of her so she tried to keep busy, first feeding Harry on the patio, then coming back indoors to brew coffee in the kitchen. When it was ready she sat with her coffee and thought, I should probably get checked for STDs. Then she thought about the talk she was about to have with Sean\u2014it would be quick and to the point. It was obvious a child lived here. If he hadn\u2019t noticed Rosie\u2019s picture in her bedroom, he would never miss the lavender bedroom right next to her own. There were toys in the dining room and right outside the French doors on the patio.</p> <p>As these thoughts raced around her brain she had to admit she was afraid of his reaction. If anything happened to hurt Rosie, she\u2019d never forgive herself, and yet she dreaded the thought of never having another night like last night again in her life. Because when he found out what she\u2019d done, he\u2019d be furious first, then he\u2019d be gone.</p><p>In Franci\u2019s bed, Sean rolled over with a moan, opening his eyes. He smelled coffee. She was up ahead of him. His very next thought was that maybe he could get her back in here. Soon. If he had the strength. He couldn\u2019t remember the last time he\u2019d experienced a night like that. At least four years ago, he thought with a smile. He sat up slowly. He found his jeans on the floor along with a lot of clothes. Stumbling to the bathroom, he took a look in the mirror; yep, it was him. Good\u2014he was afraid he\u2019d just been hallucinating again. He rinsed his mouth, peed, then pulled on his jeans.</p><p>Sean found Franci sitting at the breakfast bar behind a steaming cup of coffee, and the first thing that came to mind was that she looked like a mere girl\u2014her cheeks rosy, lips pink and swollen from hours of kissing, her face a mixture of innocence and something that seemed almost shy, but she was a demon lover. A phenomenon. There were times during the night he felt as if he\u2019d rubbed up against both death and eternity at the same time. He took a step; he intended to kiss that mouth before there was any talking.</p><p>\u201cWe have to talk,\u201d she said.</p><p>Oh, Jesus, she was thinking again. If there was one area in which they were complete opposites\u2014Franci took everything so seriously. He, on the other hand, had trouble getting serious about much of anything and it drove her crazy. He stopped where he was and just stood there, trying to get his bearings. \u201cCan I have a cup of coffee, please? Before you get started?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHelp yourself,\u201d she said, tilting her head toward the pot.</p><p>He leaned against the counter and took a few sips, trying to clear his head. She took a few sips, remaining blessedly quiet. He could tell by the expression on her face, there was going to be some drama about last night. He mentally prepared himself; she was going to warn him it didn\u2019t mean they were getting back together. She could say that all day; he wouldn\u2019t argue with her. But he wasn\u2019t leaving; he wasn\u2019t letting her walk away from him again.</p><p>Franci was thinking, too. She thought maybe the best thing would be to just blurt it out\u2014Sean, I left you because I was pregnant. I have a daughter, your daughter. I have twenty reasons why I didn\u2019t feel I could tell you before now and I\u2014</p> <p>Just then there was a sound at the front door and Franci gasped. She knew instantly what had happened. Franci and Vivian had an understanding. Vivian would go out to get the newspaper from the end of her sidewalk, look down the block at Franci\u2019s house and, if there was a car in the driveway, Rosie would not be allowed to go rushing home to her mother until after a long, leisurely breakfast at Grandma\u2019s house. And a quick phone call to clear the way.</p><p>There was no car in the driveway! Sean\u2019s car was parked across the street along the curb.</p><p>Rosie pushed the door open, all grins and bouncing red curls. \u201cMama, we watched a scary moobie and ate pizza on Grandma\u2019s good couch!\u201d She ran to Franci, her coat not even buttoned, and Franci reached for her. Rosie threw her arms around Franci\u2019s neck and Franci lifted her up, hugging her fiercely, rocking her back and forth. Once she had her daughter in her arms, she wasn\u2019t afraid anymore. It was that way with Rosie and Franci\u2014little else in the world really mattered.</p><p>\u201cMorning, cupcake,\u201d Franci said. \u201cYou didn\u2019t let Grandma sleep in, did you?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head, giggling. Then she spied Sean, leaning against the stove in the small kitchen. He held a coffee cup in one hand; his green eyes were wide and fixed, his mouth open in shock and disbelief.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s his shirt?\u201d Rosie asked.</p><p>Franci pulled Rosie onto her lap more firmly, one leg on each side of her. \u201cI think he forgot something,\u201d she said. \u201cRosie, this is Sean. Sean, this is my daughter, Rose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWide Iwish Rose,\u201d Rosie corrected her mother.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d Franci said with a smile. \u201cMy wild Irish Rose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMama, what\u2019s Iwish again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA country. A beautiful country that\u2019s green like your eyes.\u201d She glanced at Sean. He was in a state of shock. She hoped she wouldn\u2019t have to resuscitate him in front of Rosie.</p><p>Franci heard footsteps. The door squeaked open farther and the doorknob rattled. \u201cGood Lord, Franci, you left your keys in the lock! Not exactly safe! And presumably not locked, either, since Rosie\u2014\u201d</p><p>Vivian stopped dead in her tracks as she spotted Sean. She gulped.</p><p>\u201cMom, you remember Sean, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Sean recovered himself. His eyes were no longer wide, but narrowed, and his mouth was fixed in an unhappy smile. \u201cVivian,\u201d he said with a nod. Then he sipped from his mug.</p><p>\u201cSean,\u201d Vivian said, her hand rising to her cheek as she looked at the purple bruise on Sean\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s healing up nicely,\u201d Sean said. \u201cHow\u2019ve you been, Viv?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d she said a bit weakly. \u201cVery well. Thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMama, did he fall down?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, poor thing. But he\u2019ll be just fine. Will you do something for me, peanut? I\u2019d like to have a cup of coffee with Sean before he has to leave. Would you mind having breakfast at Grandma\u2019s? Then I\u2019ll come get you, and later, after we clean our rooms, I think we should take Harry to the dog park, then maybe we\u2019ll bake something and put on one of your best movies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAww,\u201d she whined.</p><p>\u201cCome on, Rosie,\u201d Vivian said authoritatively, a hint of panic in her voice. \u201cI\u2019ll let you scramble the eggs. Come on, right now.\u201d She plucked Rosie off Franci\u2019s lap and had her out the door so quickly it was almost a magic trick.</p><p>That left Franci and Sean standing in a very small kitchen in deafening silence. No one moved as the seconds ticked by. Then Sean lifted the coffeepot and filled both their cups. He pulled out a bar stool and sat down. He focused on her eyes and waited. When she didn\u2019t speak, he said, \u201cTell me you didn\u2019t\u2014?\u201d</p><p>She gave a brave nod. \u201cI was just about to tell you when she came bounding in the front door. Rosie doesn\u2019t walk anywhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were just about to tell me? A few years after the fact?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you I needed a commitment, that I wanted a child...children. You were adamant\u2014you were not interested in the same things I was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou might\u2019ve left out a couple of things\u2014like you were pregnant. That red hair and those green eyes\u2014they\u2019ve been in my family for generations.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you really think I would tell you? After the way you acted about the whole idea?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t have the facts,\u201d he said, anger seeping into his tone.</p><p>\u201cDo you even remember how it was? Do you remember that I cried and said it was the most important thing to me and you said I\u2019d have to come up with other important things because you weren\u2019t getting into all that? Do you remember telling me not to let the door hit me in the ass? Do you remember saying, \u2018Fat chance! Not in this lifetime\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd do you remember telling me I was a child, an irresponsible fuck-around who would never grow up? That if I couldn\u2019t settle down and have a wife and children, you weren\u2019t interested in wasting any more time on me? Remember, Franci? But you didn\u2019t tell me you were pregnant!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t! I was afraid to!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAw, Jesus, Mary and Joseph\u2014afraid? You\u2019ve never had any reason to be afraid of me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was afraid you\u2019d marry me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was what you wanted!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t want you to marry me because I was pregnant! I wanted you to marry me because you loved me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did love you! I just didn\u2019t want to be married!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr have children!\u201d she shouted back. She pinched her eyes closed and took a steadying breath. She spoke quietly. \u201cI didn\u2019t want you to be stuck with us. More to the point, I didn\u2019t want us to be stuck with you, regretting our accident every day of our marriage. I wanted my child. I wanted to raise her knowing she was wanted. Loved. You will never understand this, Sean, and I don\u2019t expect you to\u2014but when my period was five minutes late, I started to love her. Passionately. And it grew by the day. If I couldn\u2019t be a hundred percent sure that you\u2019d love her just as much, I wasn\u2019t willing to take a chance on you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWere you never going to tell me?\u201d he asked. \u201cIf I hadn\u2019t bumped into you, were you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I was going to tell you. I was going to have to\u2014Rosie has just started asking questions. I was dreading it, but I was going to tell you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDreading it? Because you knew how pissed I\u2019d be?\u201d</p><p>She gave a huff of laughter. Sometimes he was so dense. \u201cNo, Sean,\u201d she said patiently. \u201cI don\u2019t care if you get mad at me. I was afraid you\u2019d hurt Rosie. Reject her. Ignore her. Break her heart.\u201d</p><p>Sean got that stunned look on his face again because he hadn\u2019t even gotten that far yet with processing all that had happened. In his mind he\u2019d just found out Franci was pregnant, and it really ticked him off that he hadn\u2019t been told. But life had hit fast-forward; she was almost four years old and asking questions about her father. He had absolutely no idea what a father did with a four-year-old. He had even less idea what a single father did!</p> <p>\u201cI won\u2019t,\u201d he said, though he was afraid, through ignorance, he just might. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Franci said. \u201cIf you don\u2019t want to see much of her, I can find ways to get around that so she isn\u2019t hurt, and if you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cFranci,\u201d he nearly barked at her, stopping her. \u201cGimme a minute, huh?\u201d He took a breath. \u201cI just found out you were pregnant!\u201d He shook his head, trying to clear it. \u201cYou haven\u2019t told her yet?\u201d</p><p>Franci shook her head. \u201cNot yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, first you have to let me digest this\u2014I think I\u2019m in shock. Then we\u2019ll talk about how we\u2019ll manage things. When we\u2019ve had a little time to work things out, then we\u2019ll tell her. But first\u2014\u201d He took another deep breath. \u201cYou\u2019ve had a few years to get used to this idea. I\u2019ve had a few minutes.\u201d He lifted one brow and peered at her. \u201cAnd I haven\u2019t had much sleep.\u201d</p> <p>In spite of herself, she flushed.</p><p>\u201cNow, I\u2019m going to get dressed. I\u2019m going to leave. I need a little time to think. I need some fresh air and you made promises to your \u2018wide Iwish rose.\u2019 I\u2019m going to call you tonight.\u201d He tilted his head. \u201cAre you going to give me a phone number now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t tell her until I\u2019m ready, Franci.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want to help tell her?\u201d she asked, frankly surprised.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he said honestly. \u201cI just don\u2019t want you to tell her until I have some time to think. I want to work things out in my head, then we\u2019ll get to...\u201d He gave a half smile. \u201cRose? Why\u2019d you name her Rose.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat hair,\u201d she said, smiling. \u201cShe came with a head full of that hair. I thought I was going to name her Taylor, till I saw the hair.\u201d</p><p>He couldn\u2019t quite smile back. Then he pushed back from the breakfast bar and went into the bedroom to gather up his clothes. As he limped out of the kitchen, she saw the scratch marks she\u2019d left on his back and winced. \u201cOh, God,\u201d she whispered, mortified. When he came back into the kitchen he was fully dressed, though he couldn\u2019t button his shirt. She said, \u201cPlease, whatever you decide, let Rosie be your first consideration. Her feelings, her little heart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever I decide?\u201d Sean asked. \u201cYou mean there\u2019s some kind of choice? She\u2019s mine, right? Nothing I decide will change that, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s yours. I wouldn\u2019t be able to hide that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you don\u2019t have to worry about her heart,\u201d he said. He buttoned his leather jacket over his destroyed shirt. \u201cWrite down your number for me. When does she go to bed?\u201d</p><p>Franci scribbled down the number on a notepad. \u201cEight or so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll call you after that so we can talk,\u201d he said, grabbing the paper. And without touching, hugging, kissing or the smallest display of affection, he left her house.</p><p>Six</p> <p>It wasn\u2019t even eight on Sunday morning when Sean left Franci\u2019s, so he drove around Eureka and Arcata for a couple of hours, hoping to spy an open bar. Of course the kind of classy bar where Sean preferred to spend his time wasn\u2019t open on Sunday morning, or any early morning for that matter, but he was willing to settle for a dive if he could only find one.</p><p>Pregnant, he kept thinking. Then he would remind himself, not pregnant anymore. There was a child, a little girl. How could Franci do something like that to him? Man, he could use a stiff drink.</p><p>Right away the many things he\u2019d have to do assaulted him. He\u2019d have to step up, offer to marry Franci and somehow become a father. He\u2019d have to act like a father to a little girl who hadn\u2019t had one since birth. Even though he had plenty of friends with young children, he hadn\u2019t been paying attention; he wasn\u2019t sure how that was done. Nor was it something he felt like doing! Next he\u2019d have to tell his family and they were all going to go crazy, his mother, Maureen, at the head of the pack.</p><p>He\u2019d have to get over being angry long enough to convince Francine to move to Beale AFB as his wife, living with him full-time, and he had only five weeks of leave to do it in. Joint checking account, sharing a dirty clothes hamper, knowing each other\u2019s whereabouts at all times, working out child-care issues. Maybe he could convince her to be a housewife and take care of everything.</p><p>Sean began to feel claustrophobic.</p><p>His cell phone vibrated in his pocket and then let out a little ping. He pulled it out and looked at it\u2014a text message from Cindy. A long text message; he didn\u2019t try to read it while he drove. In fact, he might not read it at all. Ever.</p><p>Cindy had been a very brief girlfriend. He should have broken off their relationship, which wasn\u2019t much of one to start with, when he took leave to go to Luke\u2019s. Instead, Sean, being Sean, had kept the thread alive just enough to think about it a while longer because Cindy liked him a lot, and that meant regular sex. She was a civilian who worked on base, twenty-five years old, kind of cute. They had met at the officers\u2019 club one Friday night. The girl went from zero to naked in twenty seconds\u2014they were in her bed that very night. Though he knew better, he took her out a couple of times after that. He knew it wasn\u2019t going anywhere, but she didn\u2019t. She started calling him, having expectations, getting serious. He tried to slow her down, but she was very hot to trot and not easily discouraged. Sean was a gentleman most of the time and returned her calls or texts when she asked him to, and that was probably another mistake. So he told her he was going to his brother\u2019s place, would be gone a couple of months, and this would be a good time to cool it. He wasn\u2019t interested in having a steady girl.</p><p>She was interested. She left voice-mail and text messages on his phone at least once a day, sometimes the cheery how are you variety and sometimes the desperate why don\u2019t you call me I miss you so much type.</p><p>What he wanted was a message from Franci that said, \u201cCome back here, I can explain.\u201d But he wasn\u2019t likely to get that. She didn\u2019t want him if he was merely taking responsibility. She wanted him in all the way, wanting her and a baby. Was it some kind of felony to be a guy who didn\u2019t feel like having kids? He knew a lot of guys who didn\u2019t feel like breeding up big families! It didn\u2019t make him a bad guy.</p><p>Sean found himself driving back toward Luke\u2019s in Virgin River. And he was thinking that he really liked the guy he\u2019d been with Franci, before all this. And he liked the plan he\u2019d had. He wanted to travel, do fantastically adventurous things with her: see the world, ski the Alps, snorkel in coral reefs, dive in clear, warm waters, parasail, balloon, four-wheel, do a motorcycle cross country, go mountain climbing. He hadn\u2019t ruled anything out. And Franci seemed to be having a great time; they were good together. An air force pilot and a nurse pulled together a decent enough income to indulge in all the fun entertainment life had to offer.</p><p>She had no right to do what she\u2019d done. Without even telling him. She was wrong to do that. Franci was the one who was wrong, not him. He\u2019d been honest!</p><p>He pulled up to Jack\u2019s Bar, the only game in town. The open sign was lit. Sean wandered in and found the place deserted. He went up to the bar and said hello to a smiling Jack.</p><p>\u201cMorning,\u201d Jack said. \u201cBreakfast?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShot of Chivas, if that\u2019s okay.\u201d</p><p>Jack lifted his eyebrows. \u201cFine by me,\u201d he said, getting a glass and the bottle. \u201cRough night?\u201d</p><p>Beautiful night, Sean thought. Maybe that\u2019s what pissed him off the most, that he\u2019d had that old, familiar, phenomenal, mind-blowing sex with Franci and had started thinking, I\u2019m home, I\u2019m home, I\u2019m home with my woman! He\u2019d begun formulating how they\u2019d work things out; he\u2019d convince her their life was good; he\u2019d assure her she was secure with him. He loved her; he looked forward to a life with her. It was the trappings of marriage and children that made him nervous, made him feel like the confinement would suck all the fun out of him. But if that was the price of having her in his life he would compromise. He could do the marriage thing, but that whole family thing\u2014he was maybe years away from that.</p><p>Think again, idiot, his conscience chided him. It\u2019s here. Your Wide Iwish Rose.</p><p>\u201cSean?\u201d Jack asked, putting the drink in front of him.</p><p>\u201cOh. Thanks. Just a lot on my mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d Jack replied. \u201cWell, can\u2019t say I haven\u2019t resorted to Scotch before 10:00 a.m. Sunday morning to clear my head. A time or two.\u201d Then he turned away like a good bartender and busied himself behind the bar.</p><p>Sean kept his jacket closed because there were no buttons on his shirt and he didn\u2019t want his bare chest hanging out. He spent thirty minutes with a Scotch, convincing himself that all of this was the fault of Franci and he would do what he had to do, but she would have to beg his forgiveness for the deception. And that was just the beginning! She would have to explain why, after doing that, she hadn\u2019t contacted him and told him about Rosie before she was three and a half and old enough to know he hadn\u2019t been around! That was unforgivable!</p><p>He shook his head dismally and thought, Wait a minute\u2014you don\u2019t want children, and you\u2019re angry that you didn\u2019t know you had one? He was confused. So confused.</p><p>\u201cAh, Sean?\u201d Jack asked. Sean looked up. \u201cCan I freshen that for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he said, pushing the glass forward.</p><p>Jack poured a shot and said, \u201cListen, Preacher\u2019s in the kitchen if you need anything. I\u2019m going to wander next door for about an hour, then I\u2019ll be back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNext door?\u201d Sean asked.</p><p>\u201cYeah. You met the new minister, right? The guy who married Luke and Shelby? Well, we\u2019re not real churchy, but Noah\u2019s good people and he gives a passable sermon. Preacher and me\u2014we trade off Sundays. The wives like to go. We\u2019re doing our best to support the church\u2014I think we need to keep it going. Besides, he makes me laugh a lot more often than he makes me feel guilty. I\u2019ll be back in about an hour.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d Sean said. \u201cEnjoy yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re still here when I get back, maybe we can lay a little breakfast on top of that Chivas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, maybe,\u201d Sean said.</p><p>Sean sat there a good bit longer, focused on how much this was not his fault, and finally he had bored himself to death. He figured he\u2019d settle up with Jack later and decided to just slip out. He was inexplicably drawn to the church out of curiosity. He wondered, when Jack said they were doing the best they could to keep it going, what that meant. So he walked in the front doors of the church, which opened to the back of the sanctuary.</p><p>It was not nearly full. Maybe half. Most of the people were seated toward the front, but in the back pew on the left were a few grizzled old mountain boys with graying beards past their sternums and ponytails down their backs. Sean took the back pew on the opposite side of the aisle. He got a whiff of mountain living from their side.</p><p>He recognized a good many people he knew well\u2014Luke, Shelby and Art for starters. Mel, Jack and the kids; Preacher\u2019s wife, Paige, with theirs. Walt Booth sat up front beside Vanessa, Paul and the little ones. No sign of Walt\u2019s lady friend, Muriel. She was probably out of town, which was often the case. There were others\u2014people who\u2019d been at Luke\u2019s wedding. But Sean had entered quietly and no one turned to look his way. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>And there was Noah up front. He wore jeans, boots, a plaid work shirt open at the collar and rolled up at the sleeves, a powder-blue T-shirt underneath. No suit or vestments like he\u2019d worn at Luke\u2019s wedding. Beside him, patiently listening, was his border collie, Lucy. Noah was animated, talking about Simon the fisherman, the most stubborn man alive, who couldn\u2019t make a commitment to Jesus even after he\u2019d witnessed countless miracles! He clung so powerfully to his pigheadedness that he almost missed out on the most amazing, life-altering commitment of the millennium! He was a real holdout, that Simon. Noah started talking a little bit about his own years fishing the Pacific out of Seattle and he spoke about his own obstinacy, which he claimed was legendary.</p><p>And Sean\u2019s mind wandered. I could have been softer, he thought. More sensitive to her need to have a family. I could have tried to talk it out; instead, I said mean things. I said, \u201cGo, then\u2014have a blast! You\u2019ll never have it this good with anyone else!\u201d Oh man! Small surprise she didn\u2019t return his calls!</p><p>A small voice said, Try to imagine finding your father for the first time when you\u2019re only four years old!</p> <p>While Sean was daydreaming, Noah completed his sermon and then there were a few announcements before the benediction, a perfect time to scoot out before Luke saw Sean and wondered what he was doing in church.</p><p>\u201cThe Presbyterian Women\u2019s Group will have their first meeting here on Tuesday night at seven\u2014please come and bring a dessert to share. Someone suggested the need for a nursery during services so the parents of little ones can concentrate on my profound and memorable sermons.\u201d There was a chuckle. \u201cThat means volunteers\u2014anyone interested, give me a call. It\u2019s time to start thinking about Thanksgiving baskets for the needy, and Jack Sheridan has offered to head up the committee. He\u2019ll round up the volunteers and will work with them to get a list of people we\u2019d like to share with. He will need a group of men and women to help out. And, finally, one last announcement. I have bent the church secretary to my will and Ellie Baldwin has agreed to marry me.\u201d</p><p>Laughter and applause filled the church.</p><p>\u201cShe is a generous woman,\u201d he added. \u201cShe might make something out of me yet. We haven\u2019t set a date, except to say it will be as soon as possible, small, simple and\u2014\u201d</p><p>Ellie, who had been seated at the piano in front of the church, stood. \u201cBut we will invite anyone who wants to come, right, Noah? Everything else can be small and simple, as far as I\u2019m concerned. Except the guests.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAbsolutely, Ellie. Whatever makes you happy,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the reason I\u2019m making this announcement today...\u201d Noah said, turning back to his congregation. \u201cWe\u2019re looking for a house. No way we can fit two adults, Ellie\u2019s two kids and a dog in my RV. So any suggestions would be appreciated! And with that final announcement, let\u2019s bow our heads and\u2014\u201d</p><p>Sean left the church quietly before anyone could spot him. He went around the back side of the church and immediately thought how silly it was to even try to be scarce; Luke would spot his SUV and, within moments, Jack would tell Luke just what Sean drank for breakfast\u2014it was that kind of town. Still, he waited around the back of the church until it had emptied of congregants and then went around to the front doors again.</p><p>Noah had the back of his old truck loaded up with the mountain boys and stood at the open door, ready to get in, but he still had an arm around his girl\u2019s slim waist. Sean was used to priests; it threw him for a moment to see a preacher so openly affectionate with a sexy young woman. He thought it would be best if he just disappeared before he made a giant fool of himself.</p><p>\u201cSean?\u201d Noah called. He\u2019d not only spotted him but, of course, remembered his name. \u201cLooking for someone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever mind,\u201d Sean said. \u201cI can see you\u2019re tied up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfter I drop these boys back home, I have plenty of time. If you\u2019re in no hurry.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNoah, I\u2019ll take \u2019em,\u201d Ellie said. \u201cGo ahead, talk to Sean. I\u2019ll see you at Jo and Nick\u2019s a little later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sure?\u201d Noah asked Ellie. \u201cBecause I\u2019m sure Sean could just\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome back,\u201d Sean interrupted, finishing the sentence for him, because it had suddenly seemed like a really bad idea to talk to a preacher about his situation. \u201cI could just come back.\u201d</p><p>Ellie laughed lightly, gave Noah a kiss on the cheek, pulled the truck keys out of his hand and said, \u201cGo on, Noah. I\u2019m perfectly happy to drive the boys home.\u201d</p><p>Noah grinned and gave her a squeeze. \u201cYou\u2019re a flawless female.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I know.\u201d She laughed. He gave her a boost into the old truck and, while Noah watched, away they went.</p><p>Noah walked over to Sean, hand extended. \u201cHow are you?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cGot a few things on my mind,\u201d Sean admitted.</p> <p>\u201cCan I help?\u201d Noah asked.</p><p>Sean shook his head. \u201cI have no idea. First off\u2014I\u2019d never take this one to a priest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, now, I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s a compliment or not.\u201d Noah put a strong hand on Sean\u2019s shoulder. \u201cTell me where you\u2019d be most comfortable. There\u2019s the church office, the RV, Jack\u2019s. We could have coffee, breakfast or maybe even more of what you\u2019ve been having. Your call.\u201d</p><p>Sean grinned a lopsided grin. \u201cI had a little Chivas to handle the news. I just found out I\u2019m a father.\u201d</p><p>Noah\u2019s eyebrows lifted and he smiled. \u201cDepending on where you are in life, I can understand the need for a Scotch. Let\u2019s head for the RV. We\u2019re less likely to be interrupted there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood idea. Sorry I didn\u2019t make an appointment.\u201d</p><p>Noah laughed. \u201cDid the news make an appointment?\u201d he asked. \u201cWe have to be flexible in this business. Come on.\u201d</p><p>Sean soon found himself settled in a slightly messy but comfortable RV behind the church. Noah closed an open laptop, cleared away some papers and poured Sean a cup of coffee. \u201cWant to take your coat off and stay a while?\u201d Noah asked him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine like this,\u201d Sean said, though he was getting real warm. They sat at what served as Noah\u2019s table and Sean dove right in, telling the story. He started with the ending first\u2014how he\u2019d found Franci four years after their breakup and realized how foolish he\u2019d been to let her get away. Then he went back to the beginning to explain the one and only issue\u2014as far as he knew\u2014in which they weren\u2019t compatible. And finally he talked about the fight that caused them to part company.</p><p>\u201cWe both said things we shouldn\u2019t have said. It got ugly\u2014I don\u2019t know if we were mad about not changing the other one\u2019s mind, or if we were each standing by our own convictions. Honest, Noah, I don\u2019t know anymore.\u201d And while looking into his coffee cup, he went through some of the things they\u2019d said to each other before parting ways. The he-said-she-said of it all.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t help but notice, you got yourself a bruised hand and a shiner,\u201d Noah said.</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d Sean said with a laugh. \u201cOh, man, did you think\u2014? No way, Noah\u2014it wasn\u2019t a physical fight between us. I\u2019d never strike at a woman or child. And I\u2019d only hit another man in a fair fight. I got these \u2018souvenirs\u2019 when I ran into Franci in the grocery and got a little insistent that we get together to talk. I did grab her arm, at which point a man about the size of a Mack truck threw me into the melons and pummeled me. He was protecting Franci, though he didn\u2019t know her. And then Franci jumped him to defend me. And then we all got arrested.\u201d</p><p>There was silence for a moment. \u201cGee, Sean, you\u2019ve had an interesting few days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me about it. Then I spent the night with her.\u201d He boldly connected eyes with Noah, waiting to be told how many Hail Marys that would cost him, but Noah didn\u2019t even flinch. \u201cIt was like coming home, I swear. I was never so happy in my life\u2014I found my girl again. I told her how much I\u2019d missed her, how much I loved her, and when the morning coffee was perking, her daughter came bouncing in the house after spending the night at Grandma\u2019s. Franci hadn\u2019t told me yet, but there was no mistaking those bright red curls and powerful green eyes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have red hair,\u201d Noah supplied.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s on both sides of the family\u2014my mother, my dad\u2019s sister, a few cousins. Believe me\u2014it\u2019s Riordan hair. Besides, Franci would never\u2014\u201d Sean took a sip of his coffee and cleared his throat. He didn\u2019t want to even consider the idea that someone else was Rosie\u2019s dad. Noah listened and, at a point, got the coffeepot and refilled both their cups.</p><p>\u201cMind if I ask why you were so adamant about not marrying or having children?\u201d Noah asked.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t think it was right for me,\u201d Sean said with a shrug. \u201cAt the time, four years ago, I was twenty-eight. I had a whole plan for traveling the world with Franci, for having the freedom to do the things we both loved. Guys in my squadron who married their college sweethearts could only afford to go on camping vacations, and they couldn\u2019t afford regular baby-sitters so they had to take turns caring for the kids if they wanted to go out on Friday or Saturday nights. If they stayed too late at the bar, their clothes might be burning on the lawn when they got home, and they needed a kitchen pass for poker night. I didn\u2019t want that life,\u201d he said. \u201cI just flat-ass wasn\u2019t ready for that. I was young, flying fast jets, living large, had a beautiful woman\u2014there wasn\u2019t anything else I wanted. Plus,\u201d he said, taking a breath and glancing away, \u201cit would\u2019ve helped if I\u2019d had a chance to come up with the idea on my own. You know? She gave me an ultimatum! Now or never. I called her bluff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm, Sean?\u201d Noah said gently. \u201cApparently she wasn\u2019t bluffing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m better at poker,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cHopefully,\u201d Noah said.</p><p>\u201cThis is a mess. I\u2019m furious with her for not telling me sooner, but at the same time I\u2019m not sure I want to be a father.\u201d</p><p>Noah coughed into his hand. \u201cUh-huh, but it sounds like that ship has sailed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, ask me how much that pisses me off! Plus, I can\u2019t let her get away again. She asked me to please not break Rosie\u2019s heart\u2014it tears me up that she\u2019s afraid I\u2019d hurt the kid. I\u2019m sure this is my fault, but it must be hers even more. It would help a lot if it was more her fault than mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou about ready for some input?\u201d Noah asked. \u201cIt\u2019s free advice, and you\u2019re under no obligation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo for it,\u201d Sean said.</p><p>\u201cForget all that\u2014it\u2019s in the past. You\u2019ll work through it, hopefully without hurting each other. Right now? Get to know your daughter. It\u2019s the most important part of this whole drama. Get to know Rosie. Whether you want to be a father or not, you are one, so press on\u2014start a relationship with her right away. Both of you have been missing out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019m I gonna do that?!\u201d</p><p>\u201cShow up. Talk to her. Play with her. I let Ellie\u2019s daughter put ribbons and clips and stuff in my hair. It\u2019s a bonding experience for us both\u2014I get to look stupid and she gets control.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if she asks...?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell her before she asks,\u201d Noah advised. \u201cIf you know for sure you\u2019re her father, you better tell her the second you meet her. There\u2019s a period of adjustment for both of you. Get started on it. All that stuff that went before? That separated you from Franci? You don\u2019t have to work on that with Rosie. You and Franci will work that out. I\u2019m available if you need me. I can help with that.\u201d</p><p>Sean just stared at him for a long moment, silent. Finally he asked, \u201cDo you really know what you\u2019re doing here?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI do,\u201d Noah said. \u201cI actually studied and practiced counseling before the seminary. I have a degree and everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat am I going to tell Luke?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverything or nothing,\u201d Noah said. \u201cThe most important thing right now is not what you tell other people, it\u2019s what you tell Rosie. She\u2019s a little girl. Whether she knows it or not, she wants a father. She needs a father. You\u2019re that person. Good luck\u2014you\u2019re going to have to learn fast to fully understand what that means.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe next person who needs to know about this has to be my mother. In case you haven\u2019t noticed, my mother is a very strong woman with very firm ideas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not as good with mothers,\u201d Noah admitted. \u201cYou\u2019ll be fine. I bet she loves you.\u201d</p><p>Sean shook his head. \u201cIt never kept her from whacking me in the back of the head if I didn\u2019t do what she liked. Strict. My mother was strict. All five of us were altar boys. She\u2019s wanted grandchildren for a long, long time. The fact that she\u2019s had one for this long without knowing? Oh, man, I\u2019m never going to hear the end of that.\u201d</p><p>Noah chuckled. \u201cJust duck,\u201d he advised.</p><p>On Sunday mornings after church, it wasn\u2019t unusual for Paul Haggerty to set up a work station at Jack\u2019s Bar. He had an on-site construction trailer and a small office in his home, but he liked getting a little work done here. He\u2019d set up his laptop at the end of the bar, jump on Preacher\u2019s satellite for the Internet connection, kibbitz with Jack a little. It wasn\u2019t quite as dreary as the trailer and there weren\u2019t a couple of toddlers running around calling Daddy this, Daddy that. At home, he\u2019d have one, if not two, kids on his lap.</p> <p>So after church, Vanni promised to take the kids home, give them lunch and put them down for naps. Then she winked at him and said, \u201cNaps,\u201d again. Paul intended to get a few things done at the bar and then hurry home.</p><p>Jack brought him a cup of coffee. \u201cBig project?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cSmall project made big. Remember Ian Buchanan\u2019s old cabin? His sister-in-law, Erin, wants to spend some time there next summer, but she is definitely not the outhouse kind of chick. She wants it completely renovated, enlarged and furnished. She sends me pictures of her ideas and I send her pictures back of what I have available.\u201d Paul shook his head a little, looking off at nothing. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t plan to be on site even once before she arrives for the summer. Busy lawyer type.\u201d He grinned. \u201cOne tough taskmaster. Not much gets by her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have to buy her furniture?\u201d Jack asked.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Paul laughed. \u201cIt\u2019ll be shipped from Robb &amp; Stucky when the interior is done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRobb and who?\u201d Jack asked.</p> <p>\u201cTop-end furnishings, pal. Ms. Foley will be living in style out on that mountain. We\u2019re moving real fast right now to get an add-on bedroom and bath, the roofing and wiring done and a hole dug for a septic system before the first snowfall up there. I\u2019d say we have another month and then we\u2019ll be close to having the big stuff done. We\u2019ve been at it since September. And there\u2019s always spring if we get pushed. We\u2019ll do some interior work during the winter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI remember her,\u201d Jack said. \u201cKinda uppity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever met her,\u201d Paul said. \u201cHer e-mails, which are pretty frequent, are real businesslike, but I figured her being a lawyer, they\u2019d be that way. She definitely knows what she wants,\u201d he said, clicking on a picture and turning the laptop toward Jack. There on the screen was a beautifully furnished rustic living room with rich leather furniture, shining wood floors, rough wood paneling, classy window treatments and a big, stone hearth. Included were accessories from rugs to throws, from artwork to bric-a-brac.</p><p>Jack whistled. \u201cI thought Ian had himself an old wood-burning stove.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh. Stonemason\u2019s been out there for a week building the fireplace. That old place is not the same, if I do say so myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope she\u2019s paying well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe put the work out for bid,\u201d Paul said with a laugh. \u201cThe girl knows what she\u2019s doing. But this is the first time I\u2019ve ever completely rebuilt a house via e-mail.\u201d He pushed Send on something and said, \u201cThat ought to do it for today.\u201d He closed the laptop. \u201cI have to get home before I miss nap time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPretty soon you\u2019ll have cartoons. Well, they used to call \u2019em cartoons,\u201d Jack said. \u201cNow it\u2019s something else, but they still look like cartoons. Mel says they were invented so the parents could have sex.\u201d</p> <p>Paul lifted one eyebrow with interest.</p><p>\u201cThe downside is, every time I hear the cartoon music I get a woody.\u201d</p><p>After chatting with Noah, Sean went home to Luke\u2019s and found three expectant faces in the house, looking at him oddly. They were all seated in the small living room as if waiting just for him. Luke, Shelby and Art. \u201cWhat?\u201d he asked. As if he didn\u2019t know.</p><p>\u201cYour Jeep was at Jack\u2019s, but you weren\u2019t anywhere to be seen. You didn\u2019t come home last night. What\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to catch a shower, then I\u2019m going to be out of town for a couple of days. Just a couple of days. I\u2019ll be back. I\u2019ll explain everything then.\u201d</p><p>He was answered with complete silence. \u201cAll right, fine,\u201d Luke finally said. \u201cOr you could tell us now, before you leave town for whatever reason. What\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>Sean sighed heavily. \u201cIf I tell you, can you keep your big mouths shut till I square things away with Mom?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf that\u2019s what you need,\u201d Luke said with a shrug.</p><p>\u201cShelby?\u201d Sean asked, and she nodded. \u201cArt?\u201d That man just stared at him, not quite getting the gist of this. \u201cOkay, here\u2019s the deal. It turns out Franci had a reason for drawing her line in the sand\u2014marriage and family or she\u2019s gone. She was pregnant. She didn\u2019t tell me. I found out by accident this morning. She has a\u2014\u201d He cleared his throat. \u201cWe have a daughter. Rosie. Age three and a half.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhoa,\u201d Luke said with a groan, lowering his head to his hands.</p><p>\u201cHow wonderful!\u201d Shelby said, jumping to her feet. \u201cOh, how wonderful!\u201d</p><p>\u201cRosie doesn\u2019t know about me yet. I have to take care of that. And I have to tell Mom. I\u2019m going to have to go to Phoenix to tell her in person, because I have no idea what she\u2019s going to do. She\u2019s...you know...dramatic about some things. I think I\u2019d rather auger in than tell Mom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean Rosie doesn\u2019t know about you? Weren\u2019t you with Franci last night? You weren\u2019t out all night trying to drink this away, were you?\u201d Shelby wanted to know.</p><p>\u201cYes, I was with Franci, but Rosie was spending the night at her grandma\u2019s down the street. I think Franci was just about to tell me when Rosie came through the door and jumped into Franci\u2019s arms.\u201d He put his hands in his pockets and smiled contritely. \u201cRed hair, green eyes. She calls herself the Wide Iwish Rose.\u201d His shoulders shook in a soundless chuckle. \u201cAh, no question about the DNA.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d Luke said. \u201cTalk about a revelation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. So I\u2019m going to get a shower, pack some things, go back to Franci\u2019s to talk to my Wide Iwish Rose, then fly to Phoenix to tell Mom, who is going to beat me to a bloody pulp for every bad thing I\u2019ve ever done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019ll be thrilled,\u201d Shelby said.</p><p>\u201cNo, she will not,\u201d Luke and Sean said in unison.</p><p>\u201cShe will be happy to have a grandchild,\u201d Sean added, \u201cbut unhappy that she is three and a half and doesn\u2019t know her Riordan grandma. And she\u2019s going to want to kill me for not being married to Franci. If I don\u2019t take a little time to talk her off the ledge, she\u2019ll take over. She\u2019s going to be a giant pain in the ass.\u201d He looked at Art pointedly. \u201cAss is a swear word. I won\u2019t say it again and don\u2019t you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know which ones are the swear ones,\u201d Art said indignantly. \u201cSometimes when we\u2019re fixing the roof, we don\u2019t say fuck piss shit, right, Luke?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, Art. We don\u2019t say that. Good\u2014you remembered.\u201d Luke rolled his eyes. Then he swiveled his head toward Sean again. \u201cNow what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow I\u2019m going to have to get this straightened out. Franci will have to marry me. Or something.\u201d</p><p>Shelby laughed and immediately covered her mouth. Sean was glaring at her so she said, \u201cI was just thinking\u2014you\u2019re going to work on the proposal a little, right? Because, as proposals go, that one sucked.\u201d</p><p>Sean ground his teeth. This whole thing was way bigger than he was. \u201cI\u2019m going to get that shower.\u201d And then he took the stairs two at a time, hoping he could spend some time with his daughter and get to Phoenix before Luke told on him.</p><p>Seven</p><p>Dan Brady lumbered into Jack\u2019s and headed up to the bar. He took his Shady Brady off his head and sat it on the stool next to him. It was early Sunday afternoon and he was the only person in the place. It took a minute before Preacher came from the back.</p><p>\u201cYo, Brady,\u201d Preacher said, whipping a napkin onto the bar. \u201cDon\u2019t usually see you around town on Sundays. Your day off, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>Dan nodded. He worked for Paul Haggerty and had been promoted to the foreman\u2019s position, which not only brought more responsibility, but more hours. He was on the job five and a half days a week, and that half day, Saturday, usually stretched into a full day. \u201cHow about some coffee?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou got it,\u201d Preacher said, pouring. \u201cDon\u2019t you usually have a date with your girl on Sundays? Or did Cheryl finally get smart and dump you?\u201d</p><p>The normally serious Dan grinned. \u201cShe\u2019s meeting me here.\u201d He looked at his watch. \u201cIn about twenty minutes. Where\u2019s Sheridan? Taking a day off?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe switch off on light days like Sunday afternoons. Mel has a long list of honey-do\u2019s for him.\u201d Preacher leaned on the bar. \u201cIt\u2019ll be nice to see Cheryl. Don\u2019t see enough of her around here.\u201d</p><p>Dan looked up at the big man somewhat apologetically. \u201cI doubt she\u2019ll come in and visit, Preach. Since she found sobriety, she likes to stay away from the memories of her hard-drinking days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I get that. Our loss, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s planning to face a big memory today,\u201d Dan said. \u201cIf she doesn\u2019t change her mind. She\u2019s coming to town to look at her old house. She\u2019s only been inside a couple of times since she left for treatment a long time ago. She\u2019s going to have a look today and, if she likes the shape it\u2019s in, she\u2019ll be talking to a real estate agent about selling it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what\u2019ll you do for a place to hang that Shady Brady of yours?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll find another place nearby. I work around here\u2014you\u2019re not getting rid of me that easy.\u201d</p><p>They were silent a moment. Preacher was thinking. You could always tell when he was concentrating; his heavy black brows knit together, his eyes narrowed, his jaw ground a little. Then he came out with it. \u201cMaybe sometime you can tell Cheryl from me that it stands to reason she\u2019d think about those hard days a lot, but she probably thinks about it way more than anyone else does. Folks around here, we mostly think about how amazing she is, whether she comes around to visit or not. We\u2019re all real proud of her, real happy for her. She\u2019s good people. You tell her that, if you ever get the chance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do that, Preach,\u201d he said. And he thought, Preacher\u2019s one sweet dude.</p><p>Preacher put a thermos coffeepot on the bar. \u201cI\u2019ll be in the back. I\u2019m making pies.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Dan pulled out his wallet.</p><p>\u201cPah, forget about it,\u201d Preacher said. \u201cIt\u2019s just a cup of coffee between friends, man.\u201d And then he was gone.</p><p>A few minutes later the door to the bar swung open and Cheryl said, \u201cI\u2019m here, Dan. I\u2019m ready.\u201d</p> <p>He turned to look at her and smiled. She just got prettier all the time. He walked out of the bar with her, holding her hand. \u201cI walked over\u2014let\u2019s jump in your truck,\u201d he said. \u201cWant me to drive?\u201d</p><p>She handed him her keys and got in the passenger side.</p><p>\u201cStill want to do this?\u201d he asked her, when they were both in her truck.</p><p>Cheryl nodded. Cheryl had grown up in the house and it was one of many things she left behind when she moved away from Virgin River. She also left her morbid childhood, her alcoholism, her bad reputation and her perpetual failure. Her sense of hopelessness fled when she met Dan Brady. \u201cTurns out I can do a lot of things when I\u2019m with you.\u201d</p><p>For a break on the rent, Dan had been renovating and upgrading her house. She\u2019d seen it exactly one time since Dan had moved in, and that had been a mere month after she\u2019d handed him the key. It had been greatly improved from the miserable dump it was in that short month, but she hadn\u2019t been able to force herself to look at it again. Just walking through the door, even if it was changed and improved, was a fearful prospect for her. It brought back so many horrible memories. Cheryl had spent close to fifteen years mostly in a drunken stupor. And she wasn\u2019t an ordinary drunk; she had been the town drunk.</p> <p>As for Dan, he had his own ghosts. They were just different ones. He\u2019d been a grower; he\u2019d done prison time.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to do this,\u201d Dan told her, holding her hand. \u201cYou can slap a for-sale sign on it without even going inside. The Realtor can give you a good idea what it should sell for with all the improvements.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can do it,\u201d she said. \u201cI want to see it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure, Cheryl? Because I want us to go forward. There\u2019s no reason we ever have to be stuck in the past. Our pasts\u2014we beat \u2019em. We just have to keep a green memory so we don\u2019t walk back that way.\u201d</p><p>She turned and smiled tenderly at him. She squeezed his hand. \u201cI\u2019ve been sober a year and change,\u201d she said. \u201cI feel good. My worst day sober is so much better than my best day drunk. I want to see the house, sell it, make a life with you. You\u2019re the best thing that ever happened to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen let\u2019s do it,\u201d he said.</p> <p>They\u2019d been together for more than six months. They were taking it real slow, one baby step at a time. They\u2019d spent their first whole night together just a few weeks ago and now the long-term plan was to sell her house, begin building a new one on the edge of Virgin River. Since the lot they\u2019d picked out wasn\u2019t in town, Cheryl wouldn\u2019t have to go in unless she wanted to. The decision to build there had more to do with Dan\u2019s work needs than her preferences. Since going to work for Paul, his life had turned around completely. His income and benefits were excellent, but his days started early and ended late. There was also lots of overtime, which meant money in the bank. Living close to work would be an advantage for him.</p><p>They pulled up in front of the house and Dan got out and walked around the truck and opened the door for her. She put her hand in his as they walked up to the solid porch of a pretty little house. He opened the new front door and let her enter first. He had spent more than six months completely rebuilding her house so she could sell it and move on, and he was proud of his work. He couldn\u2019t wait for Cheryl to see it.</p><p>She immediately remembered what that house was like when she had lived in it. She was thirty years old before she found her way out, but the memory flooded back to her. It had smelled so bad, for one thing. She couldn\u2019t remember when it had ever been properly cleaned and her now-deceased mother had woofed down two packs a day so there had been a perpetual smoky cloud in the air. There had been so many gaps in the doors and windows that it was always cold through the winter no matter how high they turned the heat. She\u2019d gotten used to things like ripped linoleum, missing bathroom tiles, cupboards without doors, nicotine stains on the windows and walls.</p><p>But today she looked at a pristine little house. The wood floors shone, the walls were textured and painted bright colors, the lighting fixtures were new. She walked into the kitchen\u2014it was very small, but it was a masterpiece of wood, glass, granite and stainless-steel appliances.</p><p>The only furniture Dan had in the house were some bar stools pushed up to the newly constructed breakfast bar, bedroom furniture and one La-Z-Boy recliner in the bedroom\u2014his reading chair. Sometimes his sleeping chair.</p><p>\u201cIncredible,\u201d she whispered. \u201cJust amazing. You are so gifted. I can\u2019t wait to see what you do on our house.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cI had some help, you know. And I like to build. I was born into the trade.\u201d</p><p>She pushed open the bathroom door\u2014it was unrecognizable. Gone was the big sloppy shower and old pedestal sink and chain-flush toilet. In their place was a Whirlpool tub, separate glass shower, marble interior tile, sink and countertop. Dan had had to borrow one of Luke Riordan\u2019s cabins for ten days while he gutted the bathroom and rebuilt it. Paul helped him wire it, Jack helped him plumb it, Preacher helped him cart in the tub, sink and toilet and install them. The four of them together installed and finished the cabinetry in one day.</p> <p>That was the best part of the whole project\u2014Dan now had friends, when a year or two ago he\u2019d had no one.</p><p>And Cheryl\u2019s support system through AA had grown and spread beyond that tight circle. After six months as a waitress she was now working at the community college in the cafeteria. She was taking two courses with the hope of one day getting her degree. Cheryl had moved out of her group home a couple of months ago and was renting a small apartment in a big old Victorian house that had been divided into three apartments. Her newfound independence was giving her confidence she didn\u2019t know she had.</p><p>She turned full circle, looking around at the impressive remodel. While she\u2019d lived here with her parents, her bedroom was little more than a shed pushed up against the house. Dan had poured a foundation, framed and rebuilt the room, complete with large windows. The washer and dryer had occupied a spot on the back porch; now that porch was framed, enclosed and had become a sunroom with a small, separate laundry closet at the far end. The nasty, dirty, falling-down heap of a house Cheryl remembered was a charming, beautiful little home.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t ever possibly repay you for this,\u201d she said.</p><p>Dan pulled her into his arms and kissed her. It started out as an affectionate kiss that, as usual for them, deepened and became more passionate. \u201cAren\u2019t you lucky? You don\u2019t have to.\u201d</p><p>She looped her arms around his neck. \u201cNow what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe get the Realtor to put up a sign. Chances are pretty good it won\u2019t sell right away, especially this time of year. When it does, I\u2019ll find something small to rent. When you\u2019re ready\u2014if you\u2019re ready\u2014we\u2019ll start building something we can get old in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTogether,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen it\u2019s time, I\u2019ll be ready.\u201d</p><p>Dan sometimes spent the night with Cheryl if he was invited, but they had no plans to move in together anytime soon. Long-range plans included getting engaged, finishing a small but perfect house on a nice lot, eventually getting married. Slow moves worked best for Cheryl, and Dan constantly reassured her that he wasn\u2019t going anywhere.</p><p>\u201cWant to have lunch at Jack\u2019s?\u201d he asked her.</p><p>\u201cMaybe eventually,\u201d she said. \u201cOne thing at a time, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo rush, baby,\u201d he said. \u201cYou have friends here whenever you\u2019re ready.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. I don\u2019t deserve any of them, but I sure appreciate them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLucky for you,\u201d he said again. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to deserve them. Let\u2019s go find food. Seeing you happy makes me want to celebrate.\u201d</p><p>This Sunday afternoon for Vivian Duncan turned out to be a lot less relaxing than she\u2019d counted on. She had planned to give herself a home-spa day\u2014manicure, pedicure, facial, several hours lost in a good novel while she fluffed and buffed\u2014followed by a nap! But the events of Sunday morning had been wildly illuminating and relaxation went right out the window. She recalled walking into Franci\u2019s house that morning, with Rosie in tow, to come face-to-face with Rosie\u2019s father. He was as handsome as she remembered, despite the bruise on his face. He\u2019d been standing in the kitchen, shirtless, in only jeans and bare feet, looking for all the world like a Calvin Klein ad. Clearly he\u2019d spent the night.</p><p>She had rushed Rosie out of there fast, giving the kids a chance to talk, but the second the coast was clear, she went back. She and Franci had had to speak cryptically and quietly in the kitchen; Rosie was in her bedroom with Harry, putting on her play princess gown and dressing Harry in a tutu.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s back?\u201d Vivian asked in a whisper.</p><p>\u201cHe sure is,\u201d Franci said. \u201cAnd he asked me not to tell Rosie about him till he gets his bearings. He\u2019ll call tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen did he turn up?\u201d Viv asked.</p><p>\u201cActually, over a week ago, and I didn\u2019t say anything because I wanted time to think about how I was going to handle telling him about Rosie. The past couple of days have been an emotional roller coaster.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas there more than one way to handle it?\u201d Vivian asked.</p><p>\u201cOkay, Mom, let me be blunt\u2014and I\u2019m sorry if it hurts. I wanted to decide how I was going to handle it without any pressure.\u201d</p><p>Vivian was quiet for a moment. Then she gave a sharp nod. \u201cNicely done. Blunt but not painful. You get that from me.\u201d Franci grinned at her mother. Then she laughed. \u201cOh, good,\u201d Viv said. \u201cNo crying. This is all going to work out, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you hear me?\u201d Franci said. \u201cI have no idea what\u2019s ahead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just assumed your date last night was with T.J.,\u201d Viv said with a chuckle. \u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was,\u201d Franci whispered. \u201cAt dinner I told him that I\u2019d run into Sean and explained the situation. He dropped me off early and told me to handle things and let him know when we\u2019d worked out our single-parent issues. All the time he was saying good-night, I knew Sean\u2019s car was parked across the street, the engine running. He was waiting for me to get home. I have a feeling T.J. isn\u2019t going to approve of the way I worked things out. I let Sean stay the night...before I told him about Rosie...\u201d She swallowed. \u201cI don\u2019t know who\u2019s more upset with me\u2014T.J. or Sean. T.J., because there\u2019s another man in his territory, a man he didn\u2019t know existed. Or Sean, because he thought he got his girl back, and he got a lot more than he bargained for.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m sure you had your reasons...\u201d Viv said.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s just it\u2014I had no sense of reason at all! I swear, all that man has to do is...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m okay with not knowing those details,\u201d Vivian said. Then she fanned her face with her hand.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know how it\u2019s going to shake out,\u201d Franci said. \u201cI\u2019ll work with Sean the best I can. I\u2019ll give him time to think first. He made a point\u2014he just found out I was pregnant while staring into the green Riordan eyes of a three-and-a-half-year-old.\u201d</p><p>Once Vivian was caught up on all the news, she went back to her little house, leaving Franci and Rosie to their afternoon of chores and promised playtime. And when home alone, she placed a call to Carl\u2019s cell phone and left a message. Carl, her significant other, was having a home day himself, catching up on chores and fixing a nice dinner for his kids, a boy aged seventeen and girl aged nineteen.</p><p>Carl and Viv were both ensnared in rather complicated family obligations that they balanced with a work relationship and romantic relationship, all with great care. Vivian had been widowed since Franci was seven, so it wasn\u2019t considered weird or unusual for her to have dates; there\u2019d been a couple of men in the past twenty-three years she thought might find a permanent place in her life, but they had not. Since Rosie\u2019s birth, Vivian had been Franci\u2019s partner in helping to care for and raise Rosie. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Carl, on the other hand, had been widowed for two years, and his children were still essentially teenagers, still grieving the passing of a beautiful, brilliant mother who had died too young from breast cancer.</p><p>Carl was fifty; Vivian was fifty-five. Both of them were fit and attractive and there was no reason they wouldn\u2019t notice each other if the chemistry was right. He was a family practitioner in the practice that employed her; she was a family-practice physician\u2019s assistant who worked for Carl and his two partners. She\u2019d been with them for almost three years. First, Carl had been her boss and colleague, then friend, and for the past year, the man in her life.</p><p>They were a gorgeous couple, she thought. She was small and trim and blonde; he was large, solidly built and biracial. When she\u2019d moved to the small town of Eureka, finding a man like Carl was the last thing she\u2019d ever expected.</p> <p>But because of Carl\u2019s teenagers and Vivian\u2019s commitment to a single daughter and granddaughter, they could only look forward to a time when they could concentrate on each other. Carl called it a rebirth; Vivian called it the blessed empty nest.</p><p>Of course, neither of them kept the other secret, but their kids being kids\u2014even kids of thirty!\u2014they didn\u2019t think about their parents\u2019 love lives. At all.</p><p>Her cell phone finally chimed at about three in the afternoon. It was Carl. When she picked it up, before saying hello, she said, \u201cCarl! It\u2019s happening!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d he asked, his voice quiet and maybe nervous about just what was happening.</p><p>\u201cRosie\u2019s father is back in their lives! Half of me is overjoyed\u2014they could make a family if they try, I just know it. I could end up with a grown-up life of my own one day. The other half of me is already grieving. He\u2019s an air force pilot, Carl. He\u2019s going to take them away from me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI think you need someone to hold you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPossibly,\u201d she said. \u201cBut not just anyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfter I shovel pot roast into the mouths of my kids\u2014should they show up for dinner\u2014I\u2019ll step out for a while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are so lovely,\u201d she said.</p><p>When they hung up, Vivian made a beeline for the manicure, pedicure and facial stuff that had been set aside earlier in the day. If he was going to hold her for a while, she was going to be soft and perfect. And there would be a car in the driveway and the dead bolt would be thrown into place.</p><p>Sunday afternoon found Sean packing a duffel at Luke\u2019s house. Then he grabbed himself some fast food that didn\u2019t exactly go down well, and headed back to Franci\u2019s house in Eureka. Not only did he have a nervous stomach, he\u2019d had Scotch for breakfast. When she opened the door, she was completely surprised to see him. \u201cYou\u2019re back.\u201d She was wearing an old sweatshirt and pair of jeans, big fluffy slippers and had some kind of feathery dusting thing on a long handle in her hand.</p> <p>And she looked delicious. He wanted to tackle her on the spot. But...</p><p>\u201cDid I screw up your plans for the day?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cThat depends on what you want. We\u2019re cleaning our bedrooms,\u201d she said. \u201cWell, I\u2019m cleaning mine and Rosie gets a little sidetracked. But she tries.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I come in, please?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cSean, why are you here?\u201d she asked, but she stepped away from the door to allow him to enter. \u201cYou were going to call later tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have to talk to Rosie,\u201d he said. \u201cI have to tell her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShouldn\u2019t we talk about it first? As in, how it should be done?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cI\u2019ll just try to get to know her a little, tell her who I am\u2014and I have to do this because next I have to tell my mother.\u201d</p> <p>Franci put a hand on her hip and let out a breath. \u201cThis is moving a little fast,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cTell me about it. But that\u2019s what we have, Franci, so let\u2019s just go with it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you plan to say to her? Want me to help you? Tell her with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what I\u2019m going to say,\u201d he said first. \u201cNo, I want to do it alone. But could you stay kind of close in case I get in trouble?\u201d</p><p>She grabbed his upper arm. \u201cSean, are you going to tell her and then disappear on her? Because if that\u2019s your plan, I need to know so I can do some damage control. I don\u2019t want her devastated.\u201d</p><p>He looked into her large dark eyes. God, she was beautiful. He was an animal; he was preparing to tell his daughter he was her father and at that moment all he could think about was getting Franci alone. Alone and naked. \u201cMy plan is to begin a relationship with her that will last a very long time. Cut me a little slack\u2014I don\u2019t have a frickin\u2019 clue how that\u2019s done. I\u2019m going to wing it. How much does she know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing. Basically, nothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said she started asking questions,\u201d he reminded her.</p><p>\u201cJust little-girl questions. She noticed even the divorced kids had dads around from time to time. She asked where our daddy was. I told her you were in the air force. You have to learn to tell children only what they want to know\u2014she didn\u2019t even ask who you were, just where. But that\u2019s when I knew I couldn\u2019t waste much more time and would have to track you down.\u201d She shrugged. \u201cThat was pretty recent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy\u2019d you wait so long in the first place?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d she said, shaking her head. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to face it. I knew you\u2019d be angry...she\u2019d be confused\u2014things could get real complicated. And I was afraid you might not acknowledge...her...\u201d</p><p>He frowned. \u201cNot acknowledge her?\u201d he asked in confusion.</p><p>She took a deep breath and stiffened her spine. \u201cI knew you didn\u2019t want a child\u2014you were very clear. And really, I didn\u2019t want anything from you. So I thought you might say she wasn\u2019t yours and you didn\u2019t want\u2014\u201d</p><p>He grabbed her around the waist and pulled her close to him, his nose nearly touching hers. \u201cListen to me. It was only you and me. There were never any others\u2014not for either one of us. We were more married than half the married people we hung out with. If you had a baby, she was mine. You think I wouldn\u2019t own that?\u201d</p><p>She let her eyes fall closed. Not purposely, but it was a natural response. What she wanted to do was push him away and take control of the situation. Instead, she inhaled, drinking in his breath, his scent. And she whispered, \u201cI could only hope, Sean. There was a lot of anger between us.\u201d</p><p>He relaxed his hold on her waist, giving her a little space. \u201cFranci, the stuff we have to work out about all that\u2014that doesn\u2019t have anything to do with what I have to work out with Rosie. Let\u2019s try to keep those two things in separate corners. I don\u2019t want to hurt her because of our anger with each other. That wouldn\u2019t be fair.\u201d</p><p>She tilted her head to one side and looked at him quizzically. \u201cWow. It almost seems like you got some counseling or something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I just talk to her now? And will you stay around in case I need you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if she wonders why you\u2019re telling her instead of me telling her?\u201d Franci asked. \u201cHow do we handle that?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cTell her you were surprised to see me. And I\u2019ll tell her that from now on, she\u2019ll always know where I am. We can do this.\u201d</p><p>She was totally shocked. \u201cIt sounds like we can. She\u2019s in her room and I\u2019ll be right next door in my room. Good luck.\u201d</p><p>He inhaled and it was a quivering breath. \u201cThanks.\u201d And he turned and walked into his little girl\u2019s room.</p><p>Sean stood in the doorway of the lavender bedroom for a moment, watching. Rosie had a very large play-kitchen wall unit and she was busy there. She was wearing a yellow princess dress that had seen better days\u2014must be a costume she made supergood use of because she looked like a little princess vagrant. On her bare feet were some oversize plastic sparkly pumps and, stuck lopsided into her red curls, a tiara. She was talking softly to herself while she stirred nothing in a pan on one of the play stove burners.</p><p>\u201cHi, Rosie,\u201d he said quietly.</p><p>She glanced over her shoulder at him, but went immediately back to work on her cooking.</p><p>\u201cOkay if I come in your room?\u201d he asked, and she answered with a shrug. He cleared a space filled with toys, dolls, picture books and unrecognizable kiddie paraphernalia and sat on the edge of her bed. \u201cWatcha doin\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaking stuff...\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you like to cook?\u201d</p><p>She nodded and turned toward him. \u201cI like to cook on the real stobe, but only wif Mommy or Grandma.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds like a good policy,\u201d he agreed.</p><p>She walked toward him, holding the pan in one hand and a spoon in the other. She stretched the spoon toward his mouth.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cChicken,\u201d she said, pushing the spoon at his lips.</p><p>He wondered where that spoon had been and made a slight face at the possibilities.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s bery good!\u201d she insisted.</p><p>He opened his mouth a bit and let her spoon in some imaginary chicken. \u201cMmm. That is good. Are you supposed to be cleaning your room right now?\u201d</p><p>She turned back to her stove before saying, \u201cNo. I\u2019m making stuff.\u201d</p><p>And he thought, Yeah, right. \u201cWant some help in here? Putting away toys and your things?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She turned back to him again, pan and spoon in hand, and lifted the spoon to his lips.</p><p>\u201cMore chicken?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrocc\u2019li. It\u2019s bery good for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHm. And not too filling, either,\u201d he observed. \u201cListen, I was wanting to ask you a couple of things. Like about your daddy. What do you know about your daddy?\u201d</p><p>She turned back to the stove again, very busy, very intent on her imaginary project. \u201cHe has a big plane,\u201d she said without looking at him. \u201cHe\u2019s bery important with a big plane.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that so?\u201d She nodded. \u201cI have news for you, Rose. It turns out I\u2019m your daddy. How about that?\u201d</p><p>She looked over her shoulder at him. She didn\u2019t look terribly impressed. \u201cWhere\u2019s the plane?\u201d</p><p>Sean\u2019s hearing was exceptional, despite the roar of jet engines for the past ten years and the blasting of rock bands in the O Club on top of that. He heard a muffled giggle he recognized as Rosie\u2019s mother. The sneak. He leaned over to peek out the bedroom door, but he didn\u2019t see her.</p><p>\u201cAt Beale Air Force Base. That\u2019s where the plane is kept when it\u2019s not flying. Would you like to see it sometime?\u201d</p><p>Rosie nodded so vigorously her curls bounced and her tiara slid farther to one side. \u201cCan I go for a wide in it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not allowed, I\u2019m afraid. You can go inside with me while it\u2019s parked on the ground.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy mommy goes in the helifropter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean helicopter?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Again she bobbed enthusiastically. \u201cUh-huh. Helifropter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe mentioned that.\u201d And he braced himself for the difficult questions\u2014such as, Where have you been? Why are you here now? Are you moving in with us?</p><p>But she asked, \u201cDo you have a dog?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cBut you do, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHarry,\u201d she said. \u201cDo you have a grandma?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI used to,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen I was little like you, I had two grandmas. My mommy\u2019s mother and my daddy\u2019s mother.\u201d Now would surely come the tough questions.</p><p>\u201cDo you have a bike?\u201d</p><p>He grinned. \u201cAs a matter of fact, I do. Do you?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cBut I have a all-trebain-beekle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d he asked. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll show you it,\u201d she said, taking his hand and leading him out of the bedroom and through the house to the garage.

Does it run?\u201d</p><p>She made a face at him as if he was a total idiot. Then she hopped down the step into the garage, climbed into the vehicle, flipped a switch and applied her foot to the little pedal. It moved about one mile per hour forward until it hit the wall.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s awesome,\u201d he said. \u201cCome on, Rosie. Your room is a disaster.

I don\u2019t know about you, but when my mommy asked me to do something, I didn\u2019t dare say no.\u201d He took her hand. \u201cLet\u2019s clean up a little, then you can make me some more chicken and broccoli. And I\u2019ll tell you all about my plane.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I have a wide in it?\u201d</p><p>Sean rolled his eyes. Her attention span was either extraordinary or terrible, he wasn\u2019t sure which. \u201cYou can go inside when it\u2019s parked on the ground if I\u2019m with you. We can do that sometime, if you want to. Come on.\u201d</p><p>So they went back to the bedroom. Sean did more picking up of toys than Rosie did, but none of the traumatic questions he worried about came. He asked the names of stuffed animals and dolls, they read a couple of books together, made up the bed, did a little pretend cooking, got things generally shaped up and talked. He told her that his mother would be her grandma, too, and that she also had red hair and green eyes like Rosie, except she was much older. He said he had brothers who would be her uncles. She seemed to accept this news without getting excited. So he asked her about school, which was of course preschool, and the names of her friends. He found that in her closet she had several princess dresses, all of them pretty much the worse for wear, and a bunch of play high-heeled shoes.</p> <p>\u201cI taked them to school for my friends to wear\u2014Marisa and Jason.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo kidding?\u201d He laughed. \u201cJason takes to those shoes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know what, Rose? You\u2019re a kick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t kick,\u201d she said, shaking her head. \u201cDon\u2019t neber be mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, ma\u2019am,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Sean lost all track of time. The room was sort of tidied: they had a remarkable conversation about everything and nothing, and Sean began to feel the high tension roll out of him. This wasn\u2019t that bad. He hadn\u2019t wanted to do it without Franci in the next room, but he thought he was getting along pretty well, for a guy who knew nothing.</p><p>He asked her if she took a nap and she informed him she didn\u2019t want a nap. So he suggested reading a couple of books while lying on her small, child-size bed. She went for that reluctantly, but he was thrilled. He was exhausted. He hadn\u2019t slept much the night before and the morning had been filled with internal stress. So he got a couple of good-size picture books, propped himself against the headboard of the little bed so he could fit, invited her to sit beside him and began to read.</p><p>He didn\u2019t last long.</p><p>Franci was scrubbing out the shower in the master bath when she heard her cell phone twittering. She wiped off her hands, dug the cell out of her purse and looked at the number. T.J.</p><p>\u201cHi, there,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot much. Just some housecleaning. You?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWondering if that whole drama with Rosie\u2019s father has been tackled yet.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGee,\u201d she said, sitting on her bed. \u201cI have a start on it. I told him this morning. He\u2019s not happy with me\u2014he needs time to adjust to the idea, and he\u2019s with her now, playing with her, talking to her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cMe? I\u2019m cleaning my bathroom while they play and talk.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled, but there wasn\u2019t a cheerful note to it. \u201cFrancine, did you tell him he has to clarify his visiting terms with you and then hit the road? Like we agreed?\u201d</p><p>She frowned, not answering at once. \u201cIs that what we agreed to? He just found out, T.J. I don\u2019t think he even knows what he wants.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you tell him that\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrankly, I haven\u2019t talked to him since he arrived a couple of hours ago and asked if he could spend some time with Rosie, which he has done since he got here. They\u2019re on their own for now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that wise? Leaving him alone with her? You don\u2019t really know him that well.\u201d</p><p>Sudden anger rose up in her, which she put a lid on for the moment. \u201cYes, I know him very well, T.J. In fact, I know him better than I know you. Now\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you tell him you\u2019re committed elsewhere and he has no chance of resuming the old relationship?\u201d</p><p>She sighed into the phone. \u201cI told him I\u2019d been seeing someone. That isn\u2019t one of the issues we have to work out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t sound like you\u2019re making much progress on this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, but I am,\u201d she said. And she thought, When did I allow this man to think he had such control over my actions? \u201cI\u2019m working things out just fine, but apparently not quickly enough to suit you. So, I suggest you let me have a little time to work through it all and I\u2019ll let you know how it goes. Hm? How\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo I have a choice?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely!\u201d she said. \u201cYou can refuse to be patient and look for someone who enjoys having her dinner ordered for her! Maybe someone with long hair!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re being childish,\u201d he accused.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re being controlling,\u201d she countered.</p><p>\u201cTry to be intelligent in this matter,\u201d he said. \u201cJust use your head.\u201d</p><p>If there was something Franci found even more repellant than being told she was a dud in bed, it was the inference that she wasn\u2019t smart. \u201cI will absolutely try to be intelligent, T.J.,\u201d she said. \u201cIt could be a struggle for me, but I will definitely try. I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll talk to you soon.\u201d</p><p>And she clicked off.</p><p>And she thought, Wow! She hadn\u2019t had quite this much attention from T.J. since they\u2019d started dating. He must feel completely threatened.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t sure if that amused her or worried her. But she turned off her phone just in case T.J. decided he had something more to say.</p><p>Eight</p><p>Sean awoke in a darkened little girl\u2019s room. He could hear Rosie and Franci talking somewhere in the house. He sat up from his scrunched position in the short bed and thought, Dang. I passed right out in a toddler bed. He pulled a couple of big picture books out from under him.</p><p>The door had been closed, but there was life in the house. He stood and stretched, then walked into the kitchen. Memories flooded him as he saw Franci making a big green salad. He loved her salads; she put absolutely everything in them. Franci stood on one side of the small island in the center of the kitchen while Rosie, now wearing jeans, a sweater and heavy socks, knelt on a bar stool on the other side. Something simmered on the stove and Rosie held a couple of wooden spoons, stirring and tossing the salad as Franci added ingredients. Then Franci had to pick up all the leaves that bounced out onto the counter.</p><p>They both turned to look at him. Franci chuckled, but tried to cover it with her hand while Rosie beamed at him. \u201cDid you hab a good nap?\u201d she asked very happily.</p><p>\u201cI did,\u201d he said. \u201cSorry I fell asleep. Guess I was tired.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe maked cookies and watched a moobie,\u201d Rosie said.</p><p>\u201cJeez, how long was I asleep?\u201d Sean asked.</p><p>\u201cCouple of hours, I think,\u201d Franci said. \u201cI have some spaghetti going. You\u2019re invited to dinner. Then of course you have to go because I have work in the morning and Rosie has school.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was going to drive to Sacramento and catch a flight to Phoenix. My mother, you know.\u201d</p><p>Franci winced slightly at the mention of Maureen. She actually liked Maureen, even if her sons tended to both idolize her and cut her a wide berth. But she wasn\u2019t looking forward to Maureen\u2019s reaction to Rosie. \u201cYou can use my computer to check flights, but my bet is you\u2019re not going to catch anything tonight. You\u2019ll probably have to try again tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMight have to,\u201d he said. \u201cWill you ladies excuse me? I have to use the bathroom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d Franci said with a grin.</p><p>Well, he thought, my being here certainly isn\u2019t stressing Franci anymore. She thinks it\u2019s all very funny. He went into the hall bathroom that separated the two bedrooms and lifted the lid. He yawned. He scratched his head and felt foreign objects in his hair. While he continued to aim the stream into the commode, he leaned to the left to look in the small mirror over the sink and almost had heart failure. He actually might have jumped and briefly missed the pot.</p><p>Sean had little-girl \u201cthings\u201d in his short hair\u2014clips, bows, ponytail bands, jeweled bobby pins. And there was something else\u2014he scraped off some Scotch Tape. His hair was too short so some of that stuff was taped on! But that was the least of it\u2014he had a bright red Angelina Jolie mouth that went way out of the lines. Blue eyelids and pink cheeks. He looked like a clown. He zipped his pants. Then he wet a finger under the faucet and rubbed it over his eyelid. Nothing changed, except that he saw his fingernails were bright green. He washed his hands vigorously. Oh, God\u2014he\u2019d been tattooed in his sleep! He took the bar of soap to his lips; no amount of scrubbing helped.</p><p>\u201cFrannnnn-ciiiii!\u201d he yelled.</p><p>A moment later she tapped at the door and he jerked it open. She was casually drying her hands on a dish towel while he was scowling. \u201cMagic marker, I think,\u201d she said, before he could ask the question.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d he asked desperately, totally stunned.</p><p>Franci shrugged. \u201cShe\u2019s not allowed to touch my makeup. And she thinks you look wonderful.\u201d Then she grinned.</p><p>He stiffened and pursed his lips. \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure I\u2019m out of uniform.\u201d</p><p>She chuckled. \u201cWe\u2019ll think of something. Are you staying for dinner?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t go out like this!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, let\u2019s try some fingernail polish remover on your green nails, have some dinner, and then I\u2019ll see what I can do about your, ah, makeup. Really, Sean, rule number one\u2014never close your eyes on a three-year-old.\u201d</p><p>Franci managed to get the green marker off Sean\u2019s fingernails and made progress on the \u201clipstick\u201d and \u201ceye shadow,\u201d but he was still a shade or two off. It went well with the bluish-green of his fading black eye. She fixed him up with some cover stick from her makeup bag. \u201cWhy\u2019d you take it off?\u201d Rosie wanted to know.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t wear it to work,\u201d he explained.</p><p>\u201cBut are you going to work?\u201d she wanted to know. \u201cYou said you\u2019re on bacation!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe air force has rules about boys and makeup,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cAnd about girls and makeup?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, girls are allowed to wear makeup.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut why?\u201d she asked, shaking her head. Then she turned to Franci. \u201cWhy, Mommy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause makeup is a girl thing and shaving is a boy thing. And you should never color on someone\u2019s face without asking first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d she said, apparently satisfied. \u201c\u2019Kay.\u201d</p><p>And Sean said to Franci, \u201cHow do you do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPractice.\u201d And then she smiled at him.</p><p>After a dinner of spaghetti and salad, Franci supervised Rosie\u2019s nighttime rituals\u2014bath, reading time, bed. Sean cleaned up the kitchen and went to her small living room to wait patiently for Franci to join him. He heard a low, faint growl and looked toward the end of the couch to see that little blond-and-white dog baring his teeth. The little bastard was wearing a tutu. \u201cYou bite me again, we\u2019re going to have cocker spaniel soup,\u201d he said by way of warning. Harry pranced away. \u201cBy the way, you look ridiculous,\u201d Sean called after him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWho are you talking to?\u201d Franci asked as she came into the room.</p><p>\u201cHarry. He hates me. Animals usually like me\u2014what\u2019s his problem?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe he just doesn\u2019t trust you,\u201d she offered. \u201cIf you want to say good-night to Rosie before you go, now\u2019s the time. Her light is going off in...\u201d She looked at her watch. \u201cFifteen minutes.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFine,\u201d he said, standing. \u201cDid I do all right today? I mean, she didn\u2019t run screaming from the room or anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did very well, Sean. I\u2019m impressed.\u201d</p><p>He smiled a small smile, asking himself why that felt so good coming from her. And why, he wondered, did she seem so much older now. She didn\u2019t look older, but she was completely mature. Grounded. Stabilized. If he didn\u2019t have recent proof that under that veneer of serenity there was a sexual bobcat of a woman, he\u2019d think Franci had a double, and he\u2019d got the calm one tonight.</p><p>Just thinking about that other Franci got him a little riled, and he thought it was completely reasonable that since he\u2019d played good daddy all day, he might score tonight. Since he couldn\u2019t head for the airport before morning at the earliest, the plan made sense to him.</p><p>Rosie gave him a hug good-night, but was busy with her toy laptop computer, making words and pictures. She didn\u2019t look the least bit tired. He said, \u201cThank you for a fun day.\u201d</p> <p>And she just said, \u201c\u2019Kay.\u201d</p><p>Back in the living room, Franci sat in the corner of the sofa with her feet curled under her. He sat down close to her and reached for her hand. \u201cLet me stay over,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cNo. I have things to get ready for tomorrow. I teach a couple of classes on Monday and Thursday mornings and keep office hours for students in the afternoons. Then I work my twenty-four-hour shifts in Redding on Tuesday and Friday mornings. Tomorrow starts a real busy week and I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll watch TV while you get your stuff together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. You\u2019ll seduce me and I have a child in the house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGee, how do you suppose all the families with more than one child managed to do that?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThose first children were used to their mothers and fathers sleeping in the same bed, but Rosie\u2019s not. Sometimes she crawls in with me in the night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have sweatpants in my duffel. I\u2019ll sleep in those,\u201d he tried. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I have the couch?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Because I know you and you\u2019ll seduce me. I think the only thing more important to you than sex is air. Now be on your good behavior. She isn\u2019t even asleep yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe should get a few things settled,\u201d he said. He thought, And then I will spend the night! \u201cWe should make some plans.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe should get married, I suppose.\u201d</p><p>She smiled at him. \u201cOh? And why is that?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBecause we\u2019re parents?\u201d he answered as a question.</p><p>She was shaking her head. \u201cWe\u2019ll be parents either way. That\u2019s not enough of a reason. Besides, how exactly would you handle that? The details?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. Does it matter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt matters, Sean,\u201d she said. \u201cFor one thing, I live in Eureka\u2014you live at Beale Air Force Base, a few hours away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d he said, \u201cthe air force owns me. I was hoping you\u2019d consider coming to Beale. You and Rosie. That would sure make things simple.\u201d</p><p>She just did that frowning-smile thing at him. \u201cThat isn\u2019t what you want. You don\u2019t want to be married or have a family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo quote a famous minister I know\u2014that ship has sailed.\u201d</p><p>She was quiet for a moment, looking down at her crossed legs. When she lifted her eyes they were very large, but surprisingly soft. \u201cI really need you to try to hear what I\u2019m going to tell you, Sean. You\u2019ve been back in my life a week or so\u2014you\u2019ve known about Rosie less than twenty-four hours. There was a time I would have sold my mother for a commitment from you, but just like four years ago I don\u2019t want that offer simply because we made a child together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe needs a mother and a father,\u201d he stressed.</p><p>\u201cShe has them,\u201d she answered. \u201cThere\u2019s no way we can beat the stork\u2014there\u2019s no point in making a big mistake. Besides, you just want to make some plans so you can spend the night, and you can\u2019t. Not tonight.\u201d</p><p>He lifted one light brown brow. \u201cYou gonna tell me that wasn\u2019t a real good night, last night? Because if I\u2019m any judge, it worked for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTotally rocked my world,\u201d she admitted. \u201cI need some time for the rest. I just don\u2019t take something like marriage lightly. If I do it, I\u2019ll mean it, and I won\u2019t change my mind. But I think you\u2019d do it right now for all the wrong reasons.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes this have anything to do with the guy you didn\u2019t let stay last night?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cMy boyfriend?\u201d she asked, smiling. She knew it was naughty to taunt him like that; she wasn\u2019t thinking of T.J. as a boyfriend at the moment. \u201cIt would be nice of me to tell him if things change in my personal life. But until I have matters settled...\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Franci, tell him matters are settled. You won\u2019t be dating him!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the woman who keeps calling you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat woman?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cYour phone keeps picking up text messages and voice mails. That has to be a woman.\u201d</p><p>He took a deep breath. This didn\u2019t seem like a good time to lie, just as he was trying to close a deal. \u201cI dated this girl a few times back at Beale and I told her I wasn\u2019t getting into a steady thing. When I went on leave, I told her we had to cool it because it wasn\u2019t working for me, but she\u2019s deaf. I thought when I left town for a couple of months she\u2019d let it go, but she\u2019s hounding me. I\u2019m going to call her, Franci, and tell her I\u2019m off the market. That I\u2019m getting married. She won\u2019t call anymore. Now, come on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPoor thing,\u201d Franci said. \u201cShe might be as sick in love with you as I was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs you were?\u201d he asked, a little frightened of the answer.</p><p>\u201cAnd I said I\u2019m not marrying you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, let me get this right\u2014I suggested marriage and you said no?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow about that? What a shocker, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, what the hell am I supposed to do? I thought that\u2019s what I should do!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, you still don\u2019t get it. We don\u2019t want to because you\u2019re doing what you should. Listen carefully, Sean. I want you to be absolutely sure you want to commit to a life with me and Rosie, because you don\u2019t have to marry me to have time with your daughter. She\u2019s your daughter\u2014I won\u2019t get in the way of that. Though I have to admit, the way you suggested marriage really just knocked me off my feet.\u201d</p><p>He would never admit it to anyone, but her refusal gave him an instant feeling of relief. He wasn\u2019t ready to take it all on. But it would sure make things tidier if they could just do it the way it probably should be done.</p><p>He slid close to her and, before she could protest, pulled her right up against him. \u201cYou wanna get knocked off your feet, sweetheart? Because we both know we do that to each other.\u201d He put a big hand around the back of her neck and ran his thumb from her earlobe to the hollow of her throat. Then he kissed that spot. \u201cI want you with me, Franci. Tonight, and from now on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSean,\u201d she said gravely, \u201cwhen you rejected me four years ago, there were times I wondered if I\u2019d lost my mind and my heart. The things we said to each other\u2014I don\u2019t want to risk a marriage like that. After we split and I moved to Santa Rosa, sometimes I grieved so badly I worried that I was hurting the baby with endless crying, sleepless nights, loss of appetite. I just can\u2019t face something like that again.\u201d</p><p>He ran a knuckle across her soft cheek. \u201cBaby, I didn\u2019t reject you. I wanted to be with you\u2014I just had a hang-up with marriage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, now the shoe\u2019s on the other foot. Suck it up.\u201d</p><p>Life would be made a lot simpler, Sean thought, if he could deliver the news to his mother along with a plan for a quick wedding. He made a lot of blunders, but he wasn\u2019t quite stupid enough to admit that to Franci. Instead, he covered her mouth with his and moved over it with passion. He tongued open her lips, pulled her close against him, got hard. It was hell, but he broke away just long enough to say, \u201cI\u2019m gonna show you we need to be together tonight, Franci. When I\u2019m done with you, there won\u2019t be a doubt in your mind.\u201d Then he went after her mouth again.</p><p>\u201cMooommmm-eeeee! What are you dooooo-ing?\u201d</p><p>Sean broke away abruptly and turned scarlet. There, at the end of the couch, stood Rosie, her pajama bottoms and panties missing, Harry standing beside her, his tail wagging out of his tutu. Sean grabbed a throw pillow and held it over the bulge in his jeans, although there was no way Rosie would know what was going on with him.</p><p>\u201cKissing Sean,\u201d Franci said very naturally. \u201cWhere are your pants?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI pooped! I called you to check if I wiped good, but you dint come!\u201d And with that she turned her back on them, bent over at the waist to touch her toes and exposed her butt.</p><p>\u201cArrrggghhh,\u201d Sean groaned, covering his eyes and sliding lower on the couch.</p><p>Franci chuckled and stood. \u201cOkey-dokey, looks like you did a good job. I like it when you save the inspection for the bathroom, though,\u201d Franci said. \u201cLet\u2019s get your bottoms on and back to bed.\u201d</p><p>Sean collapsed against the couch and thought, I am not ready for this! How does a person get ready for this?</p><p>When Franci came back, she was laughing at him.</p><p>\u201cCome on, stop it! The learning curve is really high here!\u201d he complained.</p><p>\u201cWhen we get right down to it, marriage would be the least of your adjustments.\u201d</p><p>By the time Sean left Franci\u2019s, it was getting late enough that he didn\u2019t want to go back to Luke\u2019s. He decided to head toward Sacramento and stop for the night at a clean, friendly looking motel along the way. He had just pulled into one such motel when his cell phone chimed.</p><p>Now, he thought, is as good a time as any to deal with Cindy, and he took the call, saying hello.</p><p>\u201cCongratulations, man,\u201d his brother Aiden said. \u201cHow about that, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh, how about what, Aiden?\u201d he asked cautiously.</p><p>\u201cA little girl, I hear. Three and a half? Almost four?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho told you?! How do you know that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho do you think? Luke. He said you caught up with Franci. He told me about the reason she bolted a few years ago. Bet you were surprised, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told that son of a bitch not to say anything yet!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t talked to Mom, so relax. You in Phoenix yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Aiden, I\u2019m not even to the Sacramento airport! I just left Franci\u2019s a few hours ago and stopped for the night. I\u2019ll head there first thing in the morning. She doesn\u2019t know I\u2019m coming.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not going to warn her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope. Mom never leaves town without checking in with at least three of us, so worst case I wait around while she finishes a bridge game or round of golf. Thing is, I couldn\u2019t head for Mom\u2019s before I squared things with Rosie. I had to tell her who her father is.\u201d</p><p>Aiden whistled. \u201cHow\u2019d she take it.\u201d</p><p>Sean thought for a second. \u201cTruthfully? She wasn\u2019t that impressed. She knew her daddy had a plane and she wants a ride. She took it right in stride, like she\u2019d been expecting me to show up any second.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you?\u201d Aiden asked. \u201cYou take it in stride?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAw, hell, it wore me out so bad I fell asleep on her little bed. Slept until the sun was down. After spending about three hours with her\u2014eating her imaginary chicken and broccoli, reading books, picking up toys, talking about bikes and dogs and playmates at school\u2014I was shot. She has these high heels she wears. She took some to school so her friend Jason could wear them, too.\u201d He grumbled. \u201cWhile I was asleep, she painted my face with magic markers...\u201d</p><p>Aiden whooped with laughter.</p><p>\u201cYeah, you laugh. I\u2019ll turn her loose on you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019d love that,\u201d Aiden said. \u201cWhen can I meet her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGimme some time, Aiden. I\u2019m way behind the power curve here. I don\u2019t know anything about kids, and there is so much to know. You have no idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s just a kid, Sean. Don\u2019t overthink it. Enjoy her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you know that when a little kid poops, you have to check their little butt to make sure they wiped it clean? Did you know that?\u201d</p><p>Aiden chuckled. \u201cYes, Sean, I knew that.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhere the hell do you learn something like that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI dated a woman with a couple of little kids. Haven\u2019t you? Ever dated a single young mother?\u201d</p><p>Sean was quiet for a moment. \u201cNot really.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow can you not really date a young mother?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve gone out with women with kids before, yeah. But I\u2019ve never been around the kids. I have friends with kids, but I never paid attention to that stuff. I\u2019m in way over my head.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFranci will help you with all that. How is Franci?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCautious. I told her I thought we should get married and she told me to slow down\u2014she wants to be sure it\u2019s the right move.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBullshit. She wants to be sure you\u2019re in love with her. That you can be a lover and a family man. Don\u2019t you know anything about women?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot as much as I thought I did,\u201d Sean admitted.</p><p>\u201cMy little brother the playboy,\u201d Aiden said. \u201cTime to take life a little more seriously, huh? I want to meet her. Rosie. Let me know the minute I can. And I\u2019d love to see Franci again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know, just because Rosie took me in stride doesn\u2019t mean the entire Riordan clan won\u2019t be a little overwhelming for her,\u201d Sean said. \u201cLet\u2019s not throw her in the deep end of the pool, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRed hair and green eyes, I hear,\u201d Aiden said. \u201cLike Mom and Paddy and half our cousins. That must have been a shock.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe second I saw her, I knew. Plus, it couldn\u2019t be anyone else\u2019s kid\u2014Franci and I were tight.\u201d He paused. \u201cTill we weren\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, lucky you\u2014you get another chance. Call me after you talk to Mom. I can\u2019t wait to hear how she likes this news.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAbout Mom...I\u2019m going to tell her in person because she\u2019s going to kill me and then she\u2019s going to rush to California and throw herself on Rosie. I can\u2019t let her do that, Aiden. What am I gonna do about Mom?\u201d</p><p>\u201cReason with her,\u201d Aiden said easily. \u201cJust tell her she\u2019ll meet Rosie very soon, but you have to introduce your very large, very excited, extended family one at a time after you work things out with Rosie\u2019s mom. Be firm\u2014she\u2019ll be fine. Call me if you need me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll give you two thousand dollars to meet me in Phoenix and tell her for me.\u201d</p><p>Aiden laughed. \u201cTalk to you tomorrow, little brother. Good luck!\u201d</p><p>Sean arrived in Phoenix before noon the next day. He rented a car and headed for his mother\u2019s condo complex.</p><p>He remembered when she\u2019d bought the place, almost ten years ago. They\u2019d been born and raised in the Chicago suburbs, but after their father died twelve years ago, Maureen Riordan had had enough of harsh winters, especially when she had to face them alone. The boys were all devoted to her, but they were also all military and it wasn\u2019t easy for them to be on call to help out their mom. The oldest was Luke, who back then had been in the army flying Blackhawks, and the baby of the family, Patrick, or Paddy as they called him, had just entered the naval academy. All of them had left home and visited their mother at the pleasure of Uncle Sam.</p><p>Maureen, as she was known to do, took matters into her own hands and found a condo in Phoenix. It was in a complex much like a resort\u2014more the kind of place Sean might choose, and that had surprised him about his mom. There was a golf course, tennis courts, a community center, swimming pools and a hefty association fee. More importantly, there was no grass to cut or snow to shovel, and there were guaranteed friends. All she had to do was sign up for certain activities and she met people. Thus, Maureen had learned to play golf and tennis and had put her bridge-playing skills to the test.</p><p>On the outside, it probably seemed like the perfect life. A deeper look gave Sean the impression his mother was filling the days just to stay busy. He wondered if she had a true passion about any of the things she spent her time on.</p><p>The place had never seemed to fit her, in Sean\u2019s mind. Their da, an electrician, had been a hard worker who\u2019d earned a decent living, but they\u2019d had five sons to raise. They had lived in a smallish three-bedroom house\u2014three boys in one bedroom, two in another\u2014on a tree-lined street on the outskirts of Chicago. The house had been forty years old the year Sean was born, and his parents had been mortgaged to their chins. When his father died, between insurance, retirement plans, Social Security and the sale of their home, Maureen was finally able to do whatever she pleased. So she moved her furniture into the small two-bedroom condo that had a Whirlpool tub in the master bath and, for the first time, a dishwasher, though she only had to run it once a week.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Sean had said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t feel like you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt feels very low maintenance,\u201d she had replied.</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t have a vegetable garden.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll buy my peas and tomatoes. Besides, I don\u2019t necessarily have to stay here for life. I might find something I like better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou might find a second husband.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPah,\u201d she scoffed. \u201cIt\u2019s more likely one of you boys will find a wife and settle somewhere. And I might want to be nearby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re all in the military! If we do find wives, we\u2019ll be moving them around for twenty years!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSean, if there\u2019s one thing I\u2019ve learned, you can count on things changing more than on them staying the same.\u201d</p><p>In ten years, however, nothing had changed. And his mother\u2019s traditional, homey furniture still looked awkward in the modern digs. Maureen had gone back to work a couple of times since moving here\u2014twice for three years each\u2014but at present she was retired. She had been a crackerjack administrative assistant and worked once for the police department and once for a brokerage firm. The boys all assumed boredom drove her to work and a need to relax drove her back home. If their dad hadn\u2019t left her well-enough fixed, they\u2019d been prepared to take care of her. Aiden, a navy doctor, was the one to watch over her most closely and he kept his brothers up to speed, when he wasn\u2019t out to sea.</p><p>On the rare occasions that all five boys could visit at the same time, there were a couple of guest apartments at the complex that they could reserve\u2014his mom\u2019s place wasn\u2019t large enough for big family gatherings. The kitchen seemed too small for a woman who loved to cook but, as she quickly pointed out, her cooking skills were not exactly in demand these days.</p><p>Sean parked in the guest parking space nearest her condo and called her from the car. When she answered, he said, \u201cHi, I caught you at home. I\u2019m in your parking lot. Do you have time for some company?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSean? What in the world...?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI grabbed a break from the honeymooners\u2019 cottage. I\u2019ll be right over.\u201d He signed off, grabbed his duffel and headed for a building on the far side of the complex\u2019s largest pool. He had to admit, his mother had found one of the best locations available. But then she\u2019d bought it when the development was new and she had been one of the first tenants.</p><p>Maureen met him outside her patio door. She looked as if she was ready to go out. \u201cSweetheart,\u201d she said, opening her arms.</p><p>\u201cOh, nuts, I interrupted your plans,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cNothing important. I played tennis this morning with the women\u2019s group and this afternoon I was supposed to go to a bridal shower of all things! For a woman in her sixties! Who has a bridal shower in their sixties? I\u2019ll take my gift over there and we\u2019ll go out to lunch\u2014how\u2019s that? I had no interest in going, anyway. They\u2019re going to play games.\u201d She made a face. \u201cThat\u2019s the best reason to be a man, Sean. No shower games.\u201d</p><p>The shower games that came instantly to Sean\u2019s mind had nothing whatever to do with hen parties and everything to do with Franci. He was going to be fired as a father within thirty days, he was sure. What he felt every time he thought of Franci was not paternal and had nothing to do with little Rose. He flushed in spite of himself.</p><p>\u201cAre you all right, Sean?\u201d his mother asked.</p><p>\u201cIs it hot here?\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cIt\u2019s cooling down, finally. Come on, come in.\u201d</p><p>He threw his duffel just inside the door and she asked him if he\u2019d like something to drink. Coke? Tea? \u201cAny chance you have a cold beer on hand?\u201d He was feeling a little weak, nervous and anxious to get the worst of this over with.</p><p>When they were seated in her living room, her with an iced tea and he with a cold beer, he asked her about tennis, about her bridge club, about her volunteer work.</p><p>She smiled at him. \u201cI think you\u2019ve just about exceeded your limit for small talk, Sean. And you\u2019re fidgeting. Either you have to go to the bathroom or you have something to tell me.\u201d She squinted at him. \u201cAre you wearing makeup?\u201d</p><p>He frowned, then thought back to the day before. \u201cOh. Sort of. Some kind of cover thing for my...rash. I guess I\u2019m allergic to...must be pizza...\u201d</p><p>\u201cPizza?\u201d she asked, confused. \u201cWith your lifestyle? That would be tragic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what it was, but I broke out in a rash and it\u2019s almost gone.\u201d She had that pleased look on her face. She was expecting him to tell her something that would make her happy. He could only hope. \u201cYou remember Franci?\u201d he asked. \u201cThat steady girl of mine a few years ago? Long, pretty hair?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course, though I think I saw her four whole times while you dated her. Five at the most. I liked Franci. And I thought you did, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did, absolutely. I ran into her recently. I was out one night and, of all places, not far from Luke\u2019s, she was out to dinner with friends. We\u2019ve kind of resumed contact, you could say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow nice for you. I never met many of your girlfriends, but of the few I think I liked her best. Nice young woman. Beautiful, too, if I remember.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh. She cut off all that long hair,\u201d he said, getting momentarily distracted. \u201cShe looks fantastic.\u201d Maureen looked at him expectantly, and at that moment he really felt as if he was back in catechism, half expecting Sister Thekela to sneak up behind him and twist his ear for not paying attention.</p><p>He shook himself. \u201cListen, Mom, I never told you the whole reason we split up, me and Franci. I loved her and she loved me, but we weren\u2019t in the same canoe. She wanted a commitment, a family, and I was running from marriage. I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood Lord,\u201d Maureen interrupted him. \u201cWhat did your father and I do to turn you boys off marriage?\u201d she asked, half pleading, half annoyed. \u201cI thought we had a good marriage, your da and me. He was so wonderful to me. I tried to take good care of him and you boys! It makes me wonder where we failed that the lot of you are terrified of marriage.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t you and Da, Mom. It was the two marriages in the family and the Pope, if you get my drift. I mean, Aiden and Luke had a couple of short, train-wreck marriages that just about killed both of them, and then there was this whole Catholic thing of not recognizing their next marriages, if they were crazy enough to have them. I mean come on\u2014Luke\u2019s wife had another man\u2019s baby and Aiden\u2019s crazy Annalee was ballistic, totally certifiable. And they stuck by both those women as long as they could but, bottom line, the women left them. And still, no future marriage in the church? Come on! You know what kind of\u2014\u201d He realized he was on a rant and stopped himself. He hung his head. You didn\u2019t knock the Catholic church in front of Saint Maureen. Without looking up, he said, \u201cIf I could have been guaranteed a marriage as sweet as you had with Da, I\u2019d have jumped in. Those other things\u2014they worried me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve always overreacted, Sean. Luke and Shelby were married by a priest! His marriage most certainly counts in the church!\u201d</p><p>Sean flushed and hoped Maureen wouldn\u2019t see it. Only the boys knew that Luke never even tried to get an annulment from his former wife. He told the priest his marriage to Shelby was his first. Luke was fine with that, but that knowledge would have had Maureen praying for his soul night and day for the rest of her life.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right, Sean. Even I can admit Papa is sometimes a little behind the times,\u201d she said. Papa was an affectionate nickname for the Pontiff. \u201cHe\u2019s sometimes a little antiquated. I pray for change. My parish priest is very with it, you\u2019d like him. He\u2019d probably give you peace of mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, right. Well, back to Francine. She had an agenda I didn\u2019t know about. She kept it from me. She had her reasons, I get that. But see...Okay, here\u2019s the deal\u2014we had an ugly fight. She wanted marriage and family, and I said I thought we were good just like we were. We said mean things. We split with hard feelings. I tried to catch up with her later, but the air force kind of scattered us\u2014she got out and I got transferred. So when I saw her, it was so\u2014\u201d He stopped. He took a gulp of beer and swallowed hard.</p><p>\u201cMom,\u201d he went on. \u201cFranci was pregnant and I didn\u2019t know it. She left because I didn\u2019t want to marry her. Of course I would have if I\u2019d known, which is why she kept it from me. She didn\u2019t want it that way so she chose to do it alone.\u201d</p><p>He watched the slow transformation of his mother\u2019s face. When she was pregnant made her stiffen. Because I didn\u2019t want to marry her made her glare angrily. Now she was maintaining that scary silence he remembered from his youth.</p><p>He brazened on. \u201cMom, I have a daughter. She\u2019s three and a half. I\u2019ve only known about this for a day. I don\u2019t even know her birthday, but I made sure she knew I was her dad and that, from now on, she will always know how to find me, and I\u2019ll be nearby whenever it\u2019s possible. And yes, I asked Franci to marry me, make us a family, but she\u2019s pretty leery of me. I\u2019m going to have to convince both of them I\u2019m worth the risk, I guess.\u201d He swallowed. \u201cYou have a granddaughter, Mom. Red hair. Green eyes. Scary smart. Her name is Rosie. She calls herself the Wide Iwish Rose.\u201d</p> <p>Maureen wilted before his eyes. She got teary and, as redheads are wont to do, her nose got pink and the edges of her lips blurred as she pursed them. She sniffed back emotion to keep control. \u201cHow did you let this happen?\u201d she asked, her voice catching.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t let it, Mom. It took me completely by surprise!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did you have an intimate relationship with her for...for presumably a long time, then refuse to marry her? Is that how you were raised?\u201d</p><p>He sat forward. \u201cNo. I was raised a whole other way, which might have a lot to do with\u2014Listen, it\u2019s a different world than when you and Dad were young.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot that different,\u201d she said. \u201cTell me everything. And don\u2019t hold back because I\u2019m going to find out eventually.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom! I didn\u2019t skip school or go to a kegger! Of course I\u2019ll tell you everything. Thing is, I just found out. I spent a day with them\u2014Franci and Rosie\u2014and knew the first thing to do was tell you. Mom,\u201d he said, scooting forward in his chair, \u201cI have so much catching up to do. I don\u2019t know anything about kids. I spent one afternoon with her and it brought me to my knees. Do you have any idea how exhausting a three-year-old is? Yeah,\u201d he said, nodding at her, \u201cyou might know that, huh? Well, it\u2019s going to take me a while to get a handle on this. Thank God I\u2019m burning leave at Luke\u2019s for another...God, less than six weeks now! It\u2019s going to take me at least that long just to know how to\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTell me about her. Did you bring a picture?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cI didn\u2019t even think that far ahead. But here\u2019s what I\u2019ll do\u2014I\u2019ll take a picture and send it to your cell phone the second I get back. You remember how I showed you to send the cell-phone picture to the computer? And I\u2019ll take more digital pictures right away. But the first thing I had to do was get to know Rosie, and I have to keep getting to know her. And the second thing was tell you about her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Franci?\u201d</p><p>He locked eyes with his mother. \u201cI have to find a way to get us back together. I know she\u2019s not like Annalee or Luke\u2019s Felicia. Never a question about that, but I was still gun-shy back then. I\u2019m not now\u2014I\u2019m going to court Franci and Rosie and hope for the best. There\u2019s a lot to do. First thing\u2014I need to set up a college account and find out what Franci needs for expenses. I have to take Rosie to Beale\u2014she wants to see my plane. I have to learn how to play with her, talk to her, teach her things. I have to...\u201d</p><p>But Maureen got up and left the room, walking down the short hall to her bedroom. Sean was stunned for a moment, confused as to why she\u2019d walk out on the conversation. Was she driven to tears? Really pissed at him? He followed her, feeling panic rise inside. The door to her room was open. \u201cMom?\u201d he said.</p><p>She came out of her walk-in closet, dragging her largest suitcase. She stopped in her tracks and turned to look at him. \u201cSean, how did you let this happen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t let it\u2014I told you, I didn\u2019t know!\u201d</p><p>\u201cObviously you know what happens when you\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cStop!\u201d he said, holding up a hand. \u201cStop right there. We both know the biology of it. I\u2019m not talking about things that Franci would consider very personal, so back away from that, Mom. You know how children are conceived. We have one, Franci and me. I\u2019m doing the best I can.\u201d He stopped. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m packing. I want to meet my granddaughter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom, she\u2019s a little girl. Aiden wants to meet her, too. So does Luke. I imagine Shelby is...Okay, wait. I was afraid of this\u2014you can\u2019t just rush in on her. We have to take this slow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve already missed her first three years!\u201d Maureen said.</p><p>\u201cMe, too! Now slow down!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not in the mood to slow down! I want to meet her as soon as possible!\u201d</p><p>\u201cListen, if you want things to work out for all of us, you have to let me...Okay, hold on a second.\u201d Sean pulled his cell phone out of his pocket and dialed up Aiden.</p><p>Aiden picked up. \u201cI have a woman at eight centimeters, this better be good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m with Mom,\u201d Sean said. \u201cShe\u2019s packing. She wants to meet Rosie right this second. I\u2019m passing the phone to her. Talk her down.\u201d</p><p>Maureen took the phone.</p><p>\u201cPut it on speaker,\u201d Aiden said to his mother. Then, \u201cSean, can you hear me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. Let\u2019s keep as much of this out in the open as possible. Secrets breed trouble, as you\u2019re only too aware. Now, are you two fighting?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet,\u201d Maureen said. \u201cI want to meet my only grandchild.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you in poor health?\u201d Aiden asked.</p><p>\u201cShe played tennis this morning. She has a few more days in her, at least,\u201d Sean answered, irritation in every word.</p><p>\u201cMother, I want you to wait until you\u2019re invited. This small family has issues to sort through and a little girl who might be confused and upset by too much change.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I have rights, too, Aiden! As a grandparent!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIndeed you do, and your grandparent\u2019s rights will be respected. But the first thing to remember is that Sean and Francine are the parents and you are a relative. They are neither unfit nor negligent\u2014you are in perfect health and can be patient. This isn\u2019t a deathbed request.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut, Aiden, I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re smarter than this. Do you want your granddaughter\u2019s mother to love you? Don\u2019t alienate her. She\u2019s in charge. Let her know you accept that or, believe me, there will be trouble.\u201d</p><p>Maureen sat wearily on the edge of her bed. \u201cOf course, you\u2019re right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can go as far as Luke\u2019s house in Virgin River, Mom,\u201d Aiden said more gently. \u201cBut if you\u2019re very smart, you\u2019ll ask Luke if one of those nice little cabins is available, or it\u2019s going to be that much longer until you get the next grandchild. Do you remember what it was like when a mother-in-law visited?\u201d</p><p>Maureen made a derisive sound. She remembered. It put quite a crimp in all the conjugal privacy. \u201cWell, with five sons maybe your father\u2019s mum didn\u2019t visit often enough,\u201d she said quietly.</p><p>Aiden and Sean both laughed at that. \u201cSpace and patience, Mother,\u201d Aiden said sternly. \u201cOr you\u2019re going to muck up the whole business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just don\u2019t understand how all this could have\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cEnough of that,\u201d Aiden said. \u201cYou know as much about that end of it as you need to know. Sean, get her a glass of wine and check in with Luke. Mother, you throw too much of your mom around and I\u2019m not going to be able to save you.\u201d Just then there was a loud sound in the background.</p><p>\u201cDid someone just scream?\u201d Maureen asked.</p><p>\u201cMore of an enthusiastic grunt,\u201d Aiden replied. \u201cI\u2019m signing off. Behave yourself!\u201d</p><p>The line went dead and Sean and Maureen just looked at each other. Finally Maureen spoke. \u201cWell, I think calling in the reinforcements is a bit over the top.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor some reason, Aiden can get through to you like no one else can,\u201d Sean said. \u201cI think because he\u2019s a doctor. The big show-off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s always been the peacekeeper in the family,\u201d she said. \u201cNow, let\u2019s go out to lunch, then we\u2019ll call Luke. I bet we can get a flight out today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to wait until the timing is right to meet Rosie?\u201d Sean asked.</p><p>\u201cI give you my word, but don\u2019t test me by making it too long a wait. I\u2019m a weak old woman,\u201d she said, walking back to the living room and grabbing her purse off the table by the front door.</p><p>\u201cYeah, right,\u201d Sean replied to her back.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s eat something Italian,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019ll hold us till we get to the outback.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled and walked out the patio doors as she followed. They\u2019d only gone a few steps when she whacked him in the back of the head. \u201cMa!\u201d he yelled, a hand going to his head as he whirled on her.</p><p>\u201cHoly Mother Mary, you ought to be ashamed of yourself! Were you raised by wolves?\u201d</p><p>Nine</p><p>Forty-eight hours after receiving a phone call from Sean and his mother, Luke rode his motorcycle up to Walt Booth\u2019s stable and parked it outside, right next to Shelby\u2019s Jeep. He walked in, pulling off his gloves as he went. When he found his wife in one of the stalls with a rake, he slapped his gloves into the palm of one hand to get her attention. When she turned to look at him, she smiled and shook her head. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhere\u2019s your uncle Walt?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI think he has plans with Muriel. He called my cell phone around noon today and asked me if I could tend and feed the horses on my way home from school. His truck is gone.\u201d</p><p>Luke stuffed his gloves in his jacket pockets and pulled the rake out of her hand, leaning it up against the stall. \u201cHis truck better stay gone or he\u2019s going to see us naked.\u201d</p> <p>She laughed at him. \u201cCan\u2019t you wait for bed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could, but the house is full of people. Why\u2019d you insist my mother had to stay with us in the house? She was perfectly willing to take a cabin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFirst of all, there\u2019s only one cabin empty and it\u2019s hunting season, and second, I\u2019m not going to have your mother stay under a different roof when we have two perfectly good upstairs bedrooms. That would be rude. Besides, we\u2019re married\u2014we\u2019re allowed to have sex in our own house, in our own bed.\u201d</p><p>He grabbed her perfect behind in two large hands and pulled her against him. \u201cYou\u2019re noisy when you come.\u201d Then he swooped down on her mouth and kissed her like a starving man. When his lips were somewhat satisfied he broke away slightly and said, \u201cAnd before and after.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m not,\u201d she argued.</p> <p>\u201cUh-huh. Then you snore and talk in your sleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you missed a period.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou noticed that? It\u2019s just a little late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you pee on a stick yet?\u201d he asked her.</p><p>Shelby shook her head. \u201cI think it\u2019s too soon and I don\u2019t want to be disappointed. Besides, it might be coming\u2014I feel weepy and my breasts are a little sore.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re pregnant,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I want to do you in the hay. You can scream until the horses stampede.\u201d He grinned at her. \u201cMaybe I can get you more pregnant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLuke...I don\u2019t want to go home with hay in my hair...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can take care of that problem,\u201d he said. He picked her up and carried her out of the stall, closing the door behind him, and into the tack room. He tugged her shirt out of her jeans, deftly opened her belt and popped the snap. Before sliding them down he lifted one of her legs and grabbed a boot heel, pulling it off. Then the other. And then the jeans and panties were in a heap on the tack room floor and Shelby was left mostly naked in her shirttails and socks.</p><p>\u201cWe should do this kind of thing more often,\u201d he said. \u201cAdventure sex.\u201d He drew off his belt because of the large buckle and let it fall. Then he pulled her against him once more, kissing her deeply while his hand wandered to the V of her legs and gently, slowly, sweetly and deeply caressed her. He smiled against her lips. \u201cShelby, you\u2019re not very good at this hard-to-get game. You\u2019re ready for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d she said in an exasperated tone. \u201cAnd you\u2019re bursting,\u201d she added, her hands going to the snap on his jeans. In a second she had his jeans around his hips and him in her hand.</p><p>He laughed low in his throat. \u201cMy innocent little wife. Prepare to start screaming.\u201d He lifted her up; her legs went around his hips and he sat down on the bench with her straddling his lap. A little maneuvering was required to seat her on him just right, but the sensation took his breath away and caused her to gasp. She held him tightly and rocked on him, with him. \u201cGod,\u201d she said. \u201cLuke, Luke, Luke.\u201d All he could do was groan and pump his hips, hanging on for her. And she talked and moaned and whimpered until it happened, and it happened quickly\u2014she shattered and spasms tightened her around him. She bit his lip, then sucked it.</p><p>He enjoyed every second of her orgasm before he cashed in. It shook him, like it always did, leaving him with a loud groan, clasping her tightly to him. In a few minutes, he realized it was actually cold in the stable. He hadn\u2019t noticed that before, and neither had she.</p><p>She shivered and he tightened his embrace. \u201cFeel better?\u201d she asked him.</p> <p>\u201cYou are so good to me,\u201d he said. \u201cDo you feel better?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was faking,\u201d she teased.</p><p>\u201cYou know what, baby? As long as you keep faking that good, I\u2019m okay with it. And see? No straw in your hair.\u201d He grinned at her. \u201cYou are sooo loud.\u201d</p><p>All of a sudden her chin quivered and her eyes welled with tears. \u201cOh, Luke,\u201d she said softly. \u201cWhat if I\u2019m not a good mother?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShelby, don\u2019t be ridiculous. You\u2019re the most loving person I\u2019ve ever known. How could you not be a good mother?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m very selfish in some ways. And I like my sleep.\u201d She sniffed and hiccuped.</p><p>\u201cUm, we\u2019re still attached here and you\u2019re crying about being a mother,\u201d he said. \u201cI suggest we get dressed, finish up with the horses and go home. And while I build a nice warm fire, you better pee on a stick. Seriously.\u201d</p><p>Having his mother at Luke\u2019s, waiting so impatiently for her chance to meet Rosie, didn\u2019t exactly make for a relaxing atmosphere for Sean. Before springing a new grandma on the little tyke, Sean had some business with the first grandma. He phoned Vivian Duncan at the family practice clinic in which she worked and asked her if he could buy her lunch. She was completely surprised by the invitation. \u201cSure,\u201d she answered with some hesitation.</p><p>\u201cLet me pick you up,\u201d he offered. \u201cJust give me a time and some coordinates.\u201d</p><p>He found she was waiting outside the clinic for him at exactly twelve-thirty. He popped out of the car and held her door for her. \u201cThanks for doing this for me, Viv,\u201d he said. \u201cI haven\u2019t said anything to Franci about us having lunch together, but I thought you and I should talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI kind of thought your mother might be with you,\u201d she said. \u201cFranci told me she\u2019s at Luke\u2019s, standing by.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStanding by very impatiently,\u201d he admitted. \u201cI wanted some time alone with you first. There\u2019s a little Italian place right around the corner. Will that work for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. That\u2019s fine. Should I be dreading this conversation?\u201d she asked with some trepidation.</p><p>\u201cI hope not.\u201d He tried to sound reassuring, but wasn\u2019t sure he pulled it off. Then he laughed. \u201cI should probably be the one dreading it.\u201d He reached across the front seat for her hand. \u201cI have a few things to say, that\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>To his great relief, she let it go during their short drive, not asking any more questions. Sean settled her in the restaurant, at as quiet a table as he could find, and cajoled her into ordering something before they talked.</p><p>\u201cAll right, Sean, the suspense is killing me,\u201d Vivian said impatiently. \u201cWhat\u2019s this about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is about me apologizing to you,\u201d he said quickly. \u201cFranci told me that you weren\u2019t at all pleased with the way she handled the situation with her pregnancy. Now, I have to tell you\u2014she did the only thing she could do. Cards on the table, Vivian\u2014I didn\u2019t give her an opening to trust me with that kind of news. If she had insisted on having a baby, I would have insisted on marriage. And it would have been a terrible marriage. In short, she was right about me.\u201d</p><p>Vivian lifted a blond brow. \u201cWas?\u201d she queried.</p><p>He laughed, but his cheeks took on a pink stain. \u201cI might\u2019ve come a long way since then, but I didn\u2019t come fast and I\u2019m not all the way there. The truth is, I had to suffer without Franci for a long time before I realized I needed her in my life. And this whole business of suddenly being a father...It\u2019s going to take me some time, but I\u2019m working on it. I want you to know, I\u2019m doing my best.\u201d He took a breath. \u201cYou should have gotten in touch with me and told me. Then I could do my learning without a three-and-a-half-year-old watching.\u201d</p><p>Vivian was shocked and her expression reflected it. Was he taking her to task? She let out the breath she was holding. \u201cI thought about it,\u201d she admitted. \u201cAt the end of the day, I couldn\u2019t betray my daughter\u2019s wishes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSince we can\u2019t go back, let\u2019s let each other off the hook for any imperfections. How about that?\u201d he suggested.</p><p>Vivian was quiet for a long moment, during which time the waitress brought iced tea for both of them. She measured her words carefully before she spoke. \u201cListen to me, Sean\u2014I want my daughter to be happy, but Rosie is the beat of my heart. When Franci told me she was having a baby and having her alone, the first thing I felt was resentment\u2014I was barely fifty! I still feel I have a lot of life left to live! And I\u2019d already raised a child alone, so I knew firsthand how hard it would be for her. Franci was going to need a lot from me, and I didn\u2019t really have a lot to give. But I held that baby and, within seconds, I felt she was as much mine as my daughter\u2019s. If you think for one second I\u2019m going to be patient with you while you try to figure out if you have what it takes to be a good father, you\u2019re wrong. Dead wrong.\u201d</p><p>Sean briefly wondered if in an earlier life he had pissed off a bunch of tough old goddesses; he was surrounded by strong, opinionated women. \u201cI completely understand. I have a lot to learn about her. About Rosie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care what happens between you and Francine\u2014she\u2019s all grown up and can shoulder disappointment. But you\u2019d better not let down my granddaughter, Sean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re going to have a lot of backup in that department. My mother\u2019s on the job, beating me with the guilt stick every chance she gets, and no one does guilt like an Irish Catholic mother. Are you going to give me a chance?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said, relaxing back in her chair. \u201cEvery chance. Don\u2019t screw it up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m doing everything I can, for both of them. I\u2019m trying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d she said, taking a calming breath. \u201cAt least you\u2019re honest.\u201d</p><p>He sipped from his glass of iced tea. \u201cHm. Well, honesty didn\u2019t buy me as much sympathy as I thought it would.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re surprised about that? Listen, when the heart of a small child is at stake, there\u2019s not a lot of wiggle room. I suggest you get this right the first time.\u201d</p><p>He smiled in spite of himself. He shook his head and laughed. \u201cI think you\u2019re going to like my mother,\u201d he said.</p><p>Aiden had jarred Maureen into remembering what it was like when one\u2019s mother visited, and it didn\u2019t matter if it was the maternal or paternal mother. There was a definite lack of privacy for the newly married couple, but the upside could be domestic assistance, and Shelby needed some of that. Although Shelby and Luke had been together quite a while, they hadn\u2019t been married a whole month yet\u2014and the bedroom Maureen was using was filled with wedding gifts that had yet to be put away. Shelby was a new college student and Luke worked hard on his property, his cabins and house, all day, seven days a week. And there was Art, who was very attached to Maureen and often spent his time with her.</p><p>So Maureen busied herself by making sure she spent quality time with Art, often fishing with him, and trying to tidy the house and put away the wedding gifts. She made sure that Shelby and Luke ended their busy days to find dinner prepared, clean and folded laundry on their bed and the house polished and smelling good. That much she had learned from her own mother and mother-in-law.</p><p>As for daughters-in-law, Maureen didn\u2019t have much experience with them. Sean had been painfully accurate in describing Aiden\u2019s and Luke\u2019s attempts at marriage as train wrecks. She\u2019d go a step further and label their wives difficult, high maintenance and selfish. Shelby was none of that, and although she hadn\u2019t seen Franci in years, Maureen remembered her as good-natured and sweet. However, Shelby had been extremely moody just lately and Maureen wondered if her mere presence had become an irritant. Also, she had not yet been invited to meet Rosie; she wasn\u2019t sure if that was Sean\u2019s doing or Franci\u2019s. She suspected Sean; he\u2019d grown very protective of his newfound daughter. And Sean was unusually quiet. Something weighed on the mind of her most entertaining son. She suspected it had a lot to do with his being down to four weeks and a few days of leave left with which to get his entire future settled. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>As for Maureen, she hadn\u2019t been this lonely since her husband\u2019s death twelve years ago, when she found herself so isolated in a dark Illinois winter. That\u2019s what had motivated her to move to Phoenix where she could work, make friends, be outdoors year-round and live somewhere her boys might enjoy visiting her.</p><p>But playing the waiting game at Luke\u2019s while everyone around her was busy with work, school or chores was wearing on her last nerve. Four days had passed with no reprieve. Sean helped Luke until midafternoon when he was allowed to fetch Rosie from day care and take her home. Then he had dinner with Franci and Rosie, and then he was back at Luke\u2019s before ten. Home, without much to say, although he had kept his word and taken pictures every day.</p><p>On her fifth day in Virgin River, Maureen finally got her break. The next day was Saturday and she was invited to accompany Rosie and Sean to Beale Air Force Base. Sean would introduce Rosie to both her grandmother and his plane, at least one of which Rosie had expressed great interest in.</p> <p>\u201cWill Franci come along?\u201d Maureen asked.</p><p>\u201cFranci is pulling a twenty-four-hour shift in Redding with a medical airlift group and Rosie stays with Franci\u2019s mother. Since Franci leaves at about 5:00 a.m. to make the drive over the mountains, I\u2019ll be picking Rosie up at Vivian\u2019s first thing tomorrow morning and returning her tomorrow night. So, we have her all to ourselves.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat will I say to her?\u201d Maureen wondered out loud.</p><p>\u201cTell her you\u2019re happy to meet her. Then ask a question or two\u2014like what color her bedroom is, what she likes to wear for dress up or what she likes to cook in her play kitchen. That\u2019ll get you two talking in no time. And rest up\u2014she\u2019s exhausting!\u201d</p><p>Sean could see that the hardest thing for Maureen was trying to keep her enthusiasm in check enough so she didn\u2019t completely overwhelm Rosie. He shouldn\u2019t have worried\u2014Rosie took the edge off things right away. \u201cYou have wed hair like me!\u201d she exclaimed. From that point on, the two redheads chattered like a couple of magpies all the way to Beale\u2014more than a three-hour drive. They took along books and a couple of Rosie\u2019s favorite toys\u2014her toy computer helped her practice letters, numbers and writing. Maureen sat in the backseat with Rosie and they played and read the whole drive while Sean chauffeured. Franci called his cell twice to check on them before he even made it to Beale.</p> <p>An air force squadron is a little like a small town. The men who work and fly together get real tight, and Sean had a close working relationship with their squadron commander, Lieutenant Colonel Jacob Sorrell. That came in real handy, since Sean had to phone and tell Jake the circumstances that would bring him to Beale during his leave\u2014he wanted to give his mother and daughter a tour of the base and the airplane, the U-2. Given the high security, he had to have special permission and an escort, even though it was basically Sean\u2019s ride.</p><p>\u201cDaughter?\u201d Jake had asked during their phone conversation. \u201cOur most notorious bachelor has a daughter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d he said, and for the first time it struck him how lucky he was that little accident had happened with a woman he happened to have had a serious relationship with. Then he thought of something that struck him damn hard. What if that accident had happened with someone he hardly knew\u2014like Cindy? \u201cI\u2019ll explain more about that later, but obviously I just learned about her and the one thing she\u2019s asked of me is to see my plane. And my mother happens to be in town also.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d Jake had said. \u201cYour mother can keep an eye on your daughter while you and I steal a half hour for a conversation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn Saturday?\u201d Sean asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be in the office when you\u2019re done with your tour.\u201d</p> <p>Sean drove his mom and Rosie around the base and showed them the hangar and an airplane that happened to be in for maintenance. He laughed when Rosie put both her little hands over her cheeks and gasped at the size of the U-2. He took a picture of her in the cockpit without getting any of the instrument panel in the photo. In fact, he\u2019d have Jake download the pictures, delete them from his camera and send them to Franci\u2019s e-mail address when he was satisfied there wasn\u2019t the slightest security breach. It wasn\u2019t as though the U-2 was a secret\u2014the plane sat on static display during air shows. But this was a working plane.</p><p>He also showed her the KC-135 tankers that refueled the jets in the air, a batch of C-130s and a staggeringly huge C-5. By three o\u2019clock, Rosie was completely exhausted and Maureen was looking a little worn, as well. He took them to the squadron\u2019s waiting area\u2014not very fancy\u2014and asked them to read for twenty or thirty minutes. \u201cI won\u2019t be long. We can have dinner on the way home. I\u2019m sure Rosie will nap in the car after I fill her belly.\u201d</p><p>Jake Sorrell stood from his desk and came around to shake Sean\u2019s hand. \u201cI\u2019m glad you had an excuse to come in from leave, Sean. I thought about calling you...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d Sean asked, before sitting down.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up is four years. You only got on the waiting list for an open slot at Air Command and Staff College when you pinned on major and you\u2019ve been flying under the radar. You know you\u2019re maxed out here. It\u2019s time for you to be reassigned. Have you thought about that?\u201d</p><p>Sean looked down and shook his head. \u201cThink there\u2019s any way I can get this put off a few months? I just found my daughter, man. She and her mother live close to Beale.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d sure like to hear about that, if it\u2019s something you can talk about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can guess what people might think, but it\u2019s not sleazy at all. Franci and I were a couple.\u201d Then he proceeded to explain how he\u2019d given the woman plenty of good reasons to think she was better off going it alone. He didn\u2019t even realize how differently he was seeing the situation now. In less than a week he\u2019d gone from it\u2019s all her fault to I made her do it. \u201cI need some time to get this straightened out a little bit, Jake. Franci\u2019s not jumping into anything with me and I can\u2019t just run out on Rosie the minute I find her. It could screw the kid up for life.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAny chance you can put things together with the mother?\u201d</p><p>Sean gave him a contrite expression. \u201cThe woman I told I\u2019d never get married or have children with four years ago? She might be slightly wary.\u201d</p><p>Jake, father of four, sat back in his chair. \u201cSmooth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need time, Jake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have to look at your options,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re overdue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did look at my options, but they were all different before I knew I had a child. I figured if I didn\u2019t get Air Command and Staff the first try, I\u2019d go to Iraq or Saudi in the U-2 and earn my slot to ACSC. I\u2019m not real anxious to do it that way now.\u201d</p><p>Sean was an Air Force Academy grad, a former fighter pilot, a distinguished graduate of several training programs\u2014and all of that added up to not only a command position in the not-too-distant future but, if he hung in there, the rank of general. From the age of eighteen, that had been his plan\u2014to end his career running the world from the Pentagon. Of course, there were steps\u2014assignments, career-building training programs like Air Command and Staff College, remote tours, et cetera.</p><p>\u201cWell, I suggest you take another look at the options,\u201d Jake said. \u201cYour leave is approved through November, but if you don\u2019t put in for an assignment somewhere, orders are going to be cut without any input from you. You know what\u2019s out there\u2014U-2 overseas accompanied or remote, change of mission to U-2 in weather, a staff job somewhere, or you might get lucky and slip into an open slot at Air Command and Staff...\u201d Jake leaned forward, folding his hands on top of his desk. \u201cThe hard part about being a family man in the military\u2014we serve where we\u2019re needed. The air force gives you a chance to put together an assignment if you can, but you know what\u2019s expected of you, and the air force will take its pound of flesh.\u201d</p><p>Sean was quiet for a long moment. Finally he said, \u201cThey\u2019ve been right here all along and I didn\u2019t know it until last week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry about that but, Jesus, Sean, you do your next assignment right and you\u2019ve got stars in your pockets. But you can\u2019t sit here any longer. Get in touch with the flesh peddlers who make assignments at the Military Personnel Center and find out what they\u2019re trying to fill. Get the jump on \u2019em before they send you remote. All I can do is give you a heads-up, Sean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he said.</p><p>Jake stood. \u201cListen, be honest with the woman. Tell her the situation, ask for her input. Maybe if she feels involved in the decision...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, right,\u201d Sean said. But he was thinking, She barely got her life together the way she wants it and here I come, showing up unannounced, and before I can even get checked out on spending the night, the air force is ready to ship me out. \u201cShe\u2019ll probably think I did this on purpose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou knew this was coming, Major. No one sits in the same assignment for this long. You should have come up with a better plan.\u201d</p><p>Sean stood. \u201cUntil a week ago, I thought I had a plan. I was going to do a couple of years of hard time in the sandbox and ACSC, and then take your job right out from under you. I just wanted to fly, then take command of a flying squadron. Until now, there wasn\u2019t anything to keep me in one place.\u201d</p><p>Under any other circumstances, Sean would be really grateful for that kind of a heads-up from his boss. It was real tough to get into Air Command and Staff in a residence program; making the waiting list alone was a good showing. He had an itch to get on the phone to MPC, but no one would be at the office on a Saturday night, so instead he took his mom and Rosie to Denny\u2019s for dinner, and afterward they headed back to Eureka.</p><p>Once again the girls settled in the backseat and, while there was still light, they looked at books together. When the sun lowered in the sky and Rosie had fallen asleep, Sean called Franci\u2019s cell. \u201cReporting in,\u201d he said, when she answered. \u201cShe had mac and cheese and fish sticks for dinner and a little bit of salad. A glass of milk, too. And she loved the planes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid she have a good time?\u201d Franci asked. \u201cDid she mind her manners?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was perfect and she had a blast. She\u2019s asleep in the backseat, and yes, she has her belt on. I\u2019m not supposed to talk and drive in this state, so I\u2019m going to sign off. Want me to check in when she\u2019s home?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. And Sean? Is Maureen very angry with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNear as I can tell, she\u2019s not even mad at me anymore,\u201d he said with a laugh. \u201cAm I invited to dinner tomorrow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. I\u2019m going to need a nap to sleep off my twenty-four-hour shift. Why don\u2019t you entertain Rosie and...and why don\u2019t you cook.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe happy to,\u201d he said. \u201cAny special requests?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnything, but remember the food groups\u2014Rosie\u2019s growing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow about Stroganoff, fat noodles, peas and salad? I\u2019m good at Stroganoff. I\u2019ll make it with chicken instead of beef\u2014for Rose. She\u2019s partial to chicken.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat would be awesome,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cYou got it. And some nice snacks and a good white wine.\u201d</p><p>When they were back at Vivian\u2019s, he parked and lifted Rosie out of the backseat. He asked his mother to carry Rosie\u2019s books and toys to the house while he helped get his daughter in her pajamas.</p><p>Rosie had her own room at Viv\u2019s house, as well. This room was all little girl, too, but was yellow in color. She had her arms locked around his neck so tight, he\u2019d have to peel her off. \u201cWe\u2019re home, short-cake. Let\u2019s find your jammies.\u201d She squirmed and murmured, not letting go of his neck. He laughed at her and said, \u201cI can\u2019t help you change clothes if you don\u2019t let go.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>With her face buried in his neck, she asked, \u201cAre you still my daddy?\u201d</p><p>Sean felt his heart catch. All at once he was filled up with so much emotion he was sure he wouldn\u2019t be able to swallow if he tried. And he suddenly couldn\u2019t focus his vision. He turned his head and kissed her cheek. \u201cI\u2019ll always be your daddy, pumpkin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a silly daddy,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re a silly Wide Iwish Rose. I\u2019m so glad I found you.\u201d</p><p>Ten</p><p>While Sean was helping Rosie into her pajamas, Maureen was handing toys over to Viv. The two women had never met before today and had spent a whole ten minutes together in the entirety of their acquaintance, and that was when Maureen and Sean had picked up Rosie earlier in the day. \u201cI want to thank you,\u201d Maureen said. \u201cRosie is an incredible, brilliant, wonderful child and I bet some of that had to do with what a fantastic grandmother you are.\u201d</p><p>Viv put a hand on Maureen\u2019s forearm. \u201cI have things to tell you,\u201d she said quietly. \u201cImportant things about Rosie\u2014what she likes, what she hates, momentous moments in her little life...about her temper, her giggles, her ear infections and her love for animals. And also, I want you to know that I argued hard for Franci to find Sean and let him know about his daughter. Maureen, there is only so much we, as mothers, can do when our adult children have relationship issues. In fact, in most cases, the more we do, the worse it\u2019s bound to get.\u201d</p><p>Maureen laughed ruefully and nodded in agreement. \u201cOh, I know. I have five sons. Do you think they talk to me about the women in their lives? Even though I might be able to answer the hard questions? It\u2019s true what they say about sons and daughters\u2014your daughter is your daughter all her life, but your son...\u201d</p> <p>\u201c...is your son till he takes a wife.\u201d Viv gave a short nod. \u201cWe\u2019ve both been wives. We\u2019d probably both agree it\u2019s all right that way.\u201d</p><p>Again Maureen laughed. \u201cI want to stay on and dominate Rosie\u2019s time. Not just to get to know her, but for her to get to know me. But I\u2019ve been with Luke and Shelby for almost a week now and they need their house back. In fact, Sean needs the freedom to work things out with Franci and Rosie! I don\u2019t want to be in the way of that! No matter what\u2019s to come with them, I want my granddaughter to have a father and I want to be part of her life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou will be\u2014please don\u2019t worry about that. I have an idea. I\u2019m sure the three of them will want to spend tomorrow afternoon and evening together as they have the past week, but Sean can drop you here, with me. We can look through photo albums, go to an afternoon movie, have a nice dinner out, and I\u2019ll be happy to drive you to Virgin River tomorrow evening so Sean and Franci don\u2019t have to work their schedule around either one of us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Maureen asked. \u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d enjoy it so much. Your position right now must be tough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have no idea.\u201d Maureen laughed. Then she dropped her voice to a whisper. \u201cMy new daughter-in-law is certainly pregnant and I\u2019m not sure she even realizes it herself yet! She is moody, nauseous, cries at the drop of a hat, and they want a baby. Vivian, I have to get out of there so they can be alone together for this news. I remember when I was barely pregnant with Aiden and my mother-in-law just wouldn\u2019t leave. I thought about killing her in her sleep!\u201d</p> <p>Viv laughed. \u201cI have a spare room if you think your life\u2019s in danger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t stay much longer or it will be, though I do try to be helpful...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know\u2014and sometimes the more helpful you are, the worse it gets.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do know!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t have five, but I\u2019ve been there for Franci for thirty years. Come over tomorrow and spend the day. Maybe we can get a game plan, you and me. For example, you can always come for a visit and stay here. That way you\u2019d have lots of time to spend with Rosie and you\u2019d be able to give both those boys their space with their women. As for me? I\u2019d get a companion!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t even know me! Are you so sure I wouldn\u2019t be a burden? I could be a slovenly houseguest!\u201d</p><p>Viv tilted her head and smiled. \u201cI work full-time as a physician\u2019s assistant for a small family practice in town. More than full-time, some days. I\u2019m betting you cook like a dream.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOhhh, what are you getting yourself into?\u201d Maureen asked.</p> <p>\u201cI lived with my pregnant daughter and then Franci and a baby! Do you intend to be more trouble than that?\u201d</p><p>The two of them were laughing and holding on to each other when Sean came out of Rosie\u2019s bedroom. He stopped in his tracks, looked at them and said, \u201cUh-oh.\u201d</p><p>After hearing from Sean, Francine was kicked back in a recliner at the station on Saturday night. Also in the same room were two flight crews\u2014another nurse, a couple of paramedics, two pilots and two copilots. They shared the station with other emergency first responders\u2014two fire-engine crews, two paramedic ground crews and a staffed ambulance crew. She\u2019d been on a couple of runs during the day, routine hospital transports that were serious but not critical\u2014one cardiac patient in need of bypass surgery and one expectant mother of twins in early labor.</p><p>She was just thinking about grabbing some sleep in case the night proved busy when her cell phone chimed and she recognized the number. T.J. on a Saturday night. She jumped out of her recliner and left the rec room to take the call so as not to bother the people watching TV. \u201cHello,\u201d she said as she stepped into the next room, which was the kitchen. \u201cHow are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA little disappointed,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s been a week, Francine. I thought by now you\u2019d have something to say to me.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cSay to you? I\u2019m completely confused. I\u2019ve given you almost daily updates. Sean is trying to get to know Rosie. His mother is in town and met Rosie for the first time today. I heard from him fifteen minutes ago that Rosie had a fun day, seemed to get along fine with the new grandma, and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about him?\u201d T.J. asked.</p><p>She laughed a little. \u201cWhat about him?\u201d she countered. \u201cI don\u2019t know what you mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you do. Think, Francine. Give the guy visiting privileges that don\u2019t interfere with your personal and professional life. Tell him you\u2019re committed, that he can\u2019t be hanging around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve pretty much done that,\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019s asked if he can pick Rosie up in the afternoon from day care, bring her home for me, have dinner with her. He\u2019s doing all this because he\u2019s on leave right now, but he\u2019s not on leave forever, and it\u2019s not only good for Rosie, it helps me out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I haven\u2019t seen you at all,\u201d T.J. said.</p><p>\u201cI only see you about once a week, anyway, and that\u2019s if you\u2019re not in Cabo or Alaska or out on the research boat. We\u2019re busy people with demanding work schedules and kids. In fact, I\u2019ve never had so many calls from you during the week! Does this whole situation threaten you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt concerns me,\u201d he said. \u201cI thought a week would be enough to get things lined up with this guy so we could have our lives back as they were.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that makes you a lot more optimistic than I was,\u201d she said. \u201cGetting to know a small child you didn\u2019t even realize you had takes time and patience, and I\u2019m certainly not going to toss Rosie at him and expect him to sink or swim! She\u2019s my baby, for God\u2019s sake!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you purposely\u2014?\u201d</p><p>God bless that siren! It went off, followed by the official and somewhat mechanical voice giving the coordinates of a motor vehicle accident on Highway 5 with critical injuries, dispatching a helicopter, one paramedic ground unit and two ambulances\u2014one of which came from a different service. Must be a bad one.</p><p>T.J. would have heard the blast. \u201cGotta run!\u201d she said, signing off.</p><p>She ran for her helicopter with the rest of the crew and didn\u2019t think about him again before morning.</p><p>Sunday morning in Virgin River found Ellie Baldwin, the Presbyterian church secretary, getting herself and her kids ready for the church service.</p><p>Ellie\u2019s life had changed so much in just a few months that she barely recognized herself. To start with, she\u2019d grown up poor. Not kind of poor, dirt poor. She\u2019d lived with her grandmother in two rooms and they\u2019d shared a pull-out sofa bed her entire life. They had managed on Social Security checks and food stamps. Then she had two children without the benefit of marriage or support of any kind. Her grandmother kept them while Ellie worked day and night to keep body and soul together. She took any kind of work. After her grandmother died Ellie even held a job as a stripper for a short time. It paid the bills and put food on the table.</p><p>Now at the ripe old age of twenty-five she lived more comfortably than she ever had, and so did her kids, four-year-old Trevor and eight-year-old Danielle. Ellie rented a lovely, but tiny, room over the Fitches\u2019 garage. For the time being, her kids stayed downstairs in the big house with Jo Ellen Fitch and her husband, Nick. Ellie got the kids up in the morning and put them to bed at night. She had a wonderful friendship with Jo and Nick, and if life went on like this forever, she wouldn\u2019t dare complain. But just when she thought it couldn\u2019t get any better, she fell in love with Noah Kincaid, the local minister, an amazing and wonderful man.</p><p>Noah, now her fianc\u00e9, had been in search of a house where they could live like a real family. It was only right, she knew. As it was, he was creeping into her rented room more nights than not, and this really wasn\u2019t the best behavior for the town pastor. Noah didn\u2019t fret over that and, this being Virgin River, Ellie assumed everyone knew everything; they probably just didn\u2019t say anything in front of them.</p><p>Right before the church service this Sunday morning, Noah whispered that he had a house for her to look at. \u201cIt\u2019s not much,\u201d he said, \u201cbut it\u2019s in our budget and it might be redeemable. I just want us married and all under one roof.\u201d</p><p>Bless his little heart, Ellie thought with a flood of warmth. When a girl is looking for a passionate man, common sense would say that she doesn\u2019t go looking for him in a church. But what she had learned from Noah was that men with passion and commitment don\u2019t limit themselves to one single agenda\u2014their passion, commitment, honor and courage will permeate all the facets of their lives.</p><p>Noah loved her passionately and he made her whole; he made her life full.</p><p>Their service that morning showcased the Virgin River Presbyterian church choir\u2019s very first performance, accompanied by Ellie and her rusty piano skills, and it was just short of horrid. But in this town people were so supportive of one another, they actually stood and clapped. It made her flush, but she was just happy to be through it. Then after some coffee and cookies in the church basement, Noah spirited her away. He said it was best to send the kids home with Jo and Nick so they could view this potential house alone.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t far from the church\u2014just on the edge of town, past the established neighborhood. They were in Noah\u2019s old truck and he pulled off to the side of the road where the weeds had gotten tall and the shrubbery overgrown. He turned toward her. \u201cEllie, if this isn\u2019t right, we\u2019ll just keep looking. Be warned, it needs a lot of work. Here\u2019s what\u2019s good about it\u2014it\u2019s large, even if it is in disrepair. It has a big piece of land under it, not a small yard. It\u2019s not in the middle of town, but it\u2019s only a half mile away. It has a huge kitchen...\u201d He paused and cleared his throat. \u201cA big kitchen without a single working appliance, but that\u2019s just fix up. And\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNoah, how did you come across this house?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cOh, Buck Anderson knew someone who knew someone who\u2019d been renting the place out for years but only because he couldn\u2019t get rid of it. He said if I was clever, it could go cheap. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m clever with negotiating a price, but I\u2019m okay with a hammer. And we might not be as settled as we should be, but we get by thanks to Jo and Nick. I saw some promise in it and thought I\u2019d show you before I write it off.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cGood idea, Noah. Because I am clever with money, you lucky dog. I\u2019ve had to be.\u201d</p><p>He grinned his handsome grin. \u201cI haven\u2019t once complained about your assets, have I?\u201d</p><p>She leaned over and kissed his cheek. \u201cIn the beginning, you did nothing but complain.\u201d She patted the other cheek. \u201cYou\u2019re coming along very well, though. Now, come on\u2014the suspense is killing me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI just hope seeing it doesn\u2019t do any permanent damage to your opinion of me.\u201d He put the truck in gear and took them down a short overgrown driveway to a house that had the washed-out, gray appearance of worn paint. It was surrounded by a totally neglected yard that was dominated by weeds, out of control bushes, rotted-out flower beds, untrimmed trees, cracked sidewalk and copious litter. There was no telling the age; it could be older or younger than it looked. It was a wreck.</p><p>It was a two story and it had a porch that stretched the length of the front of the house and a front door that was probably worth as much as the whole structure. Ellie was surprised it hadn\u2019t been ripped off and stolen\u2014it was a stained and polished dark wood with a beveled-glass window. It was a breathtaking door on a nightmare of a house.</p><p>Wordlessly, Ellie got out of the truck and went to the house. She got the heel of her shoe stuck in a rotting board on the porch, but she gamely pulled it out and kept going.</p><p>The inside opened up into a very large living room that was adjoined by an equally large dining room. Both rooms had filthy fireplaces, suggesting the house was old and had been constructed before central heating. Also, it was built before the days of family rooms and foyers. She walked right into the middle of everything. It was very large and the ceilings were high. The two rooms were divided by an ornate wooden arch that had been sloppily covered with many layers of white paint. In fact, the whole house had been painted in a cheap coat of renter\u2019s white that hadn\u2019t held up well.</p><p>The staircase to the second floor was right between the two rooms inside the front door and, again, cheap paint had been used to cover a banister that was undoubtedly real wood. The staircase led up to the second floor and an open balcony that ran along a hall leading to the bedrooms. This old style had gone out of fashion many years ago\u2014it reminded Ellie of the saloon in the Gunsmoke series. She could almost see Miss Kitty poised at the top of the staircase.</p> <p>She walked through the trash-strewn rooms toward the back of the house. Behind the living room and dining room she found a large kitchen and a small bedroom. \u201cThere are three bedrooms upstairs,\u201d Noah said. \u201cOne\u2019s pretty big and two are average. There aren\u2019t any big closets and only one bathroom in the house\u2014it must have been built in the days of one-bathroom homes. But there\u2019s a back porch that\u2019s wide and deep and can be closed in. And it might even be possible to put a half bath downstairs. And the bonus is an unfinished basement. Well...a cellar. But there are so many possibilities for that.\u201d</p><p>Ellie ignored him, heading into the kitchen. It was the largest kitchen she\u2019d ever been in, and Jo Fitch had a very big kitchen. The appliances looked not only useless but maybe dangerous. However, there were many cupboards and a big bay window. She could envision a large oval table sitting right in that nook; she could imagine friends coming for dinner and children doing homework there while she cooked. Ellie had never dared have such visions before.</p><p>Through the bay window Ellie could see the side yard, deep and surrounded by trees and overgrown brush; outside the window over the kitchen sink was the porch, which, as Noah said, could be enclosed to make another room. Beyond that a long, wide backyard went right up to the forest. She spotted blackberry bushes, all gnarled and thorny. She could almost taste the jam...</p><p>She put the fingers of both hands over her mouth and her eyes welled with tears, which quickly spilled down her cheeks.</p><p>\u201cAw, baby, don\u2019t cry,\u201d Noah begged, pulling her into his arms. \u201cIt was just an idea, but we\u2019ll look at lots of houses. I just got hooked on the size of the house and lot, and my imagination might\u2019ve gotten a little\u2014\u201d</p><p>She turned in his arms. \u201cIt\u2019s the most beautiful thing I\u2019ve ever seen,\u201d she whispered. \u201cNoah, it\u2019s wonderful. I mean, it needs love, but isn\u2019t it perfect? Is it stable? Will we fall through the floor if we go upstairs?\u201d</p> <p>He was shocked silent for a moment. \u201cAre you serious?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout the second floor?\u201d she asked with a hiccup of emotion.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been upstairs,\u201d he said, shaking the confusion out of his head. \u201cYou actually like it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt would be so wonderful to fix it up and make it ours, wouldn\u2019t it? Did you see all the terrible paint in this place? I bet if I stripped the paint off the arch that divides the rooms and off the staircase and banister we\u2019d find beautiful wood. And the yard? I can make that yard look like Jo Ellen\u2019s yard! Give me a year and I can turn it around.\u201d She sniffed, took a breath and said, \u201cThank God it\u2019s almost winter\u2014I don\u2019t think I could face both house and yard at once, but by spring...\u201d</p><p>\u201cEllie?\u201d he asked, stunned. \u201cYou like it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNoah, whoever owns this house lost interest in it years ago. You can\u2019t think of renting it and fixing it at the same time\u2014that\u2019s where the owner lost control of it. My gramma and I did more with our two rooms than was done here, and we had nothing. Either we make a commitment to it or forget it. But first we have to have the plumbing and wiring and structure checked. Does it cost the moon to do that? Because we should check that before we even think of putting down good money.\u201d</p><p>Noah grabbed her suddenly and pulled her against him. \u201cEllie,\u201d he whispered, burying his face in her neck. \u201cI didn\u2019t realize how much I hoped you\u2019d see the potential in this old thing. It\u2019s a horrible mess\u2014no woman in her right mind would\u2014\u201d</p><p>She laughed and sniffed at the same time. \u201cLucky for you, you got a woman with no right mind. Noah, be honest now, are there things you like about this old house besides the price?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe same things you like,\u201d he said. \u201cThe big rooms, the big yard, the wide porches, the real wood. I can get Paul Haggerty to check it out for structural competence and the other stuff before we get emotionally moved in. We can try to sell the RV\u2014that\u2019ll give us some fix-up money.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNoah, I want to work on it. Really\u2014I\u2019m good at this stuff. It might take a while if I\u2019m needed at the church and helping the kids with all their school stuff, but I know how to make something good out of a falling down piece of\u2014\u201d She stopped herself and smiled. She\u2019d been trying to stop cursing in deference to her fianc\u00e9 the preacher. So she whispered, \u201cReally is a piece of shit, isn\u2019t she?\u201d</p><p>He laughed loudly. \u201cTotally,\u201d he agreed. \u201cBut she has so much promise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll kinds of promise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEllie, I\u2019ve been wanting to ask a question. It\u2019s not a real big issue with me, but I still should ask. You can say no and it won\u2019t make a difference, but just in case\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor God\u2019s sake, Noah! Spit it out.\u201d</p><p>He took a breath. \u201cHow do you feel about more children?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He struggled for a moment. \u201cWell...because if you wanted more...I could be talked into it...\u201d</p><p>She punched him in the stomach. \u201cNever lie to me like that. Do you want a baby of your own, Noah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m nuts about Trevor and Danielle and I want to adopt them if we can work that out, and I think we can, but, yeah\u2014if I could have one with my receding hairline and bowed legs\u2014\u201d</p><p>She laughed and ran her fingers into his overlong, curly dark hair. There was a strand or two of silver; Noah was thirty-five. \u201cOh, what I\u2019d give to have a little girl with your dark curls,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd your legs are better than mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one\u2019s legs are better than yours,\u201d he said. \u201cDid you ever think about another one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll think about that. Not right away, Noah. I have house problems and adoption problems to deal with first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot to mention a wedding. Ellie, we need to get married. I just can\u2019t keep sneaking into your room...\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfraid God disapproves?\u201d she teased.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m pretty sure God masterminded it, frankly. But I\u2019m uncomfortable with the whole subterfuge. I want us settled in, no matter where we spend our nights. We gotta get this done, baby. Let\u2019s get a move on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. Fine. But maybe I should be the one to negotiate with the seller here, huh? You lean toward the nice side.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t that a good thing?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cIn church and school and bowling,\u201d she said. She gave him a peck on the lips. \u201cNot in politics or real estate.\u201d</p><p>He smiled at her. \u201cSometimes you really turn me on.\u201d</p><p>The only thing that surprised Sean more than how easily it had been to fall into a routine with Rosie was how readily she had seemed to take to him. The other thing that shocked him was how much he looked forward to spending time with her.</p><p>On Sunday at noon he dropped Maureen at Viv\u2019s house only to find Rosie had already gone down the block to her own house. Once there, he found Franci lying on her couch. She wore a loose and comfy sweat suit and looked fresh from the shower.</p><p>\u201cLong night?\u201d he asked her.</p><p>\u201cI thought we were going to get off easy,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was real quiet. Then we had one run after another until eight this morning. I\u2019m really going to need a nap.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou got it. I\u2019ll take Rosie to the park and on some errands, and when we get back here we\u2019ll be real quiet. You want me to wake you at any special time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get myself up. Sure you don\u2019t mind making dinner?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot at all\u2014it\u2019s gotta be my turn.\u201d He smiled at her. \u201cWhere\u2019s the tyke?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCooking,\u201d she said, inclining her head toward Rosie\u2019s bedroom. \u201cMaybe she\u2019ll help with dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m sure she will,\u201d he said with a laugh.</p><p>Just then, they heard a brief shuffle down the hall, the clicking of plastic high heels, the rustle of a princess dress, a soft gasp and then Rosie ran toward him, her little feet clapping along the floor. She yelled, \u201cDaddy!\u201d and threw herself into Sean\u2019s arms.</p><p>Franci and Sean both looked at each other, shock evident on their faces. Seven days and it was done\u2014he was Daddy. He was too stunned to even allow himself the pleasure that title could bring, and he could see from Franci\u2019s face the chasm had been crossed and there was no going back. Everyone was assigned their roles and dare not shirk from them.</p><p>It was at once the most complicated yet simplest transition imaginable. The problem was that Sean and Franci had not yet negotiated their unified lifestyle or defined their positions. They were still nibbling around the edges of what kind of relationship they were going to have. Oh, Sean had suggested marriage right away, the moment he realized they had a child together, but that really wouldn\u2019t win him any points. He\u2019d done so only because of Rosie; if not for Rosie, he would have suggested he and Franci resume their old relationship, with marriage possible down the line, whereas four years ago he hadn\u2019t been willing to consider it. As progress went, it was slight.</p><p>They were right where they started, with one additional player, and he held her in his arms. He turned his gaze from Franci and buried his face in Rosie\u2019s sweet-smelling neck. \u201cWhat are you cooking, short stuff?\u201d</p><p>\u201cChicken,\u201d she said, and giggled from his tickle.</p><p>\u201cAnd broccoli?\u201d he asked with a laugh. She nodded vigorously and he looked at Franci. \u201cDon\u2019t you feed this kid anything but chicken and broccoli?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cLots of things,\u201d she said, getting up from the couch. \u201cAre you good to go? Because I should get that nap or I\u2019ll be useless tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to do stuff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow remember, always\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWear seat belts, make frequent bathroom stops, never let her out of my sight,\u201d he finished for her.</p><p>\u201cAnd never\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSend her into the ladies\u2019 room. I will take her into the men\u2019s room with me, if necessary, make sure it\u2019s clean and private and, when possible, use the handicapped facility for privacy. And plenty of vegetables and nothing that tastes fun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to be a wise a\u2014\u201d</p><p>He grinned.</p> <p>But inside he wasn\u2019t grinning. He was thinking of all the things he really had to discuss with Franci. It had been his plan to talk to her over the next several weeks about what kind of future the three of them might have, a little piece of it at a time. The meeting with his boss, Jake, upped the urgency.</p><p>His cell phone chimed with a text and he lifted it out of his pocket, glanced at it and put it back. When he looked up, Franci was staring him down. \u201cHaven\u2019t you taken care of that yet?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cI meant to, but I\u2019ve been busy,\u201d he said. \u201cBy the way, have you taken care of him yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe should talk about this later,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cWe should,\u201d he agreed. He shifted Rose onto a hip and walked toward Franci. He leaned down and kissed her forehead. \u201cGet some rest, Franci. Being tired makes you cranky.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d slug you if that weren\u2019t true.\u201d Then she went to her room. Harry ran after her, scratched at the door and was let in to nap with her.</p> <p>\u201cWell, what do you say, sport. Wanna get some warm outside clothes on so we can go play and shop?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll wear dis,\u201d she said, touching her worn-out taffeta.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t wear that to the park and the store\u2014it\u2019s getting cold out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll wear dis!\u201d</p><p>Sean furrowed his brow, narrowed his eyes and pursed his lips just the way his father had done and was surprised to find this all came quite naturally. He lowered his voice a notch. \u201cFine, then we\u2019ll stay home and read and nap.\u201d He lifted one brow.</p><p>She stared him down for a long moment. Then she said, \u201cOh-kay!\u201d But she didn\u2019t say it happily.</p><p>Sean had never spent much time alone with children. When he socialized with friends who had kids, he fit in just fine\u2014he could toss the ball, throw a little one up in the air, make goo-goo faces, tickle and tease. But he\u2019d never had any actual responsibility for a child before he met Rosie.</p><p>This was their first full-day outing alone and Sean learned something he had never before known. Women paid even more attention to him with a child in tow than they had before! He wasn\u2019t bad looking, had an adorable daughter and no wedding band. Women approached him in the mall, in Target, at the playground, remarking on his beautiful child, making small talk. They smiled hugely while they said, \u201cWell, having a daddy-daughter day?\u201d Or, \u201cIf you live around here, we could get the kids together for a play-date sometime.\u201d He was shocked and astounded.</p> <p>When he was checking out of the grocery with his dinner makings, the checker said, \u201cI\u2019m about to go on a coffee break, if you feel like a cup of coffee. Maybe your daughter would like some ice cream?\u201d</p><p>Sean immediately said, \u201cThanks, but I have to get going. My wife is waiting.\u201d</p><p>And Rosie said, \u201cWho\u2019s your wife, Daddy?\u201d</p><p>The checkout girl nearly threw the groceries into the bag as she shot daggers at him with her eyes. He felt fortunate she didn\u2019t bean him in the head with the produce. On the way to the car he said to Rosie, \u201cWe\u2019re going to have to get our story straight, kiddo. I don\u2019t know if you\u2019re helping or hurting the situation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDaddy? Daddy, I know the baby is in the mommy\u2019s tummy and the baby comes out of the mommy\u2019s tummy, but, Daddy? How do that baby get in the mommy\u2019s tummy?\u201d</p><p>He stopped dead in his tracks in the parking lot, his daughter in the rider seat of the shopping cart, his bagged groceries in the cart, and stared at her dumbly. Time stopped. He tried to channel Franci, who seemed to do all this parent stuff with such ease, but nothing came.</p><p>\u201cDaddy?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He smiled with what he hoped was confidence, pinched her little chin and said, \u201cAfter you have Stroganoff and peas tonight, would you like chocolate or vanilla ice cream?\u201d</p><p>\u201cChocolate!\u201d she yelled.</p><p>\u201cWhipped cream and a cherry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhip cream and a cherry!\u201d she yelled.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I thought. No chicken and broccoli for you tonight. No, sir. You\u2019re having fun food! Daddy\u2019s Stroganoff and ice cream!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYay!\u201d she yelled.</p><p>Later that evening, while Rosie was singing in the tub, Sean and Franci did dishes together and talked about Sean\u2019s day. \u201cHere\u2019s a shocker, Franci\u2014Rosie is a babe magnet.\u201d He grinned at her. \u201cI\u2019m a catch. You can\u2019t believe the number of women who almost propositioned me today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhile you\u2019re with my daughter?\u201d she asked, appalled.</p><p>\u201cWell, nothing racy. Just a cup of coffee or a kid\u2019s playdate. Who\u2019d guess, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat a comfort that is,\u201d she grumbled.</p><p>\u201cShould Rosie be alone in the tub?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She smiled at him, happy that he was over-protective. \u201cThe bathroom is ten steps away and as long as you can hear her singing, she\u2019s not underwater.\u201d</p><p>So Sean told her about the question Rosie had posed while they were in the parking lot of the grocery. Franci had to lean against the counter, laughing so hard she was doubled over, yet trying to keep quiet lest Rosie come running soaking wet to the kitchen to see who would dare have fun without her.</p><p>\u201cYeah, funny,\u201d Sean said. \u201cWhat would you have said?\u201d</p><p>She wiped her eyes. \u201cWell, I have a special book about all that. It\u2019s right about time to look at it together, but I didn\u2019t know how to explain you to Rosie, so I\u2019ve been putting it off. I guess I can go ahead with it now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA book? Come on!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, really. It talks about all the differences in the mommy\u2019s and daddy\u2019s bodies\u2014it\u2019s very cute. Sweet. Non-threatening.\u201d She smiled at him. \u201cIf you\u2019re very good, I\u2019ll read it to you later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re very good, I\u2019ll show you how it\u2019s done.\u201d He leered at her. \u201cBy the way,\u201d he said. \u201cHow was it done in this case? We were always very careful. Do you remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEvery detail,\u201d she said, turning away from him to put away dishes.</p><p>He turned her back. \u201cCould I have a couple of details, please?\u201d</p><p>She took a breath. \u201cRemember I used to go off the pill for a couple of months a year and your job was to be very good about the condoms? Well, there were a couple of times you got real worked up and just let it slide.\u201d She shrugged. \u201cIt was as much my doing as yours. I was also a little worked up.\u201d</p><p>Silence enveloped them for a moment. He leaned forward and kissed her brow. \u201cWe were like that,\u201d he whispered. \u201cI\u2019m not sorry about that. Big accident. Huge reward. She\u2019s awesome.\u201d</p><p>Franci hugged him. For once he managed to say the right thing. \u201cYou\u2019ve had a nice week with Rosie, haven\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s pretty amazing. Listen, there\u2019s no good way to do this, Franci. I\u2019ve been thinking all day about how to sneak up on our issues, but I\u2019m kind of up against the wall. The air force wall. After we get Rose settled in bed, can we please have a glass of wine and talk about things? Practical things.\u201d</p><p>She looked terrified. \u201cLike what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverything from insurance to...\u201d He took a breath. \u201cFranci, I\u2019ve been at Beale four years. I\u2019m going to have to call MPC tomorrow, first thing in the morning, and see if I can get the boys down there to work with me on an assignment or I\u2019m going remote. Maybe to the Middle East.\u201d</p><p>Iraq. Afghanistan. She went visibly pale. \u201cIn the U-2?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cIf there\u2019s a need for manned surveillance. But the U-2 travels to a lot of places. I don\u2019t want to go since I have you and Rosie here. That aside, they\u2019re not above changing my weapon system back to a fighter or finding me a staff job in the desert. I pinned on major\u2014I owe \u2019em three more years at least.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSean,\u201d she said weakly.</p><p>\u201cI know you\u2019d like to just roll with this awhile\u2014see where we are in getting to know each other\u2014but we\u2019re gonna have to face it. I\u2019m only on leave another four weeks and two days. I\u2019m sorry, Fran.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been at Beale four years, and you know that\u2019s a long time for an air force assignment,\u201d she said. \u201cThis can\u2019t have come as a total surprise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it didn\u2019t. You and Rose came as a surprise. I tried to get into Air Command and Staff College and I\u2019m on the waiting list as an alternate. My plan was just what you\u2019d expect out of me\u2014do whatever I have to do, go wherever I have to go, to head toward a command position. I wanted this job for life\u2014so it didn\u2019t matter where they sent me, as long as it all added up to a real good command slot down the road. I figured I\u2019d take a remote for a year and come home to a year in Air Command and Staff College, a lieutenant colonel promotion and a squadron of my own.\u201d He swallowed. \u201cNow I don\u2019t want to get too far away. I don\u2019t want Rosie to think I can\u2019t keep my word. And time\u2019s short.\u201d</p><p>Franci was quiet. \u201cShe\u2019s still singing in there,\u201d Sean said, tilting his head toward the bathroom.</p><p>\u201cBut I bet she\u2019s pruny by now.\u201d</p><p>Vivian and Maureen had a very nice day together, too. They\u2019d gone out to lunch and then did a little shopping at the local mall\u2014Maureen felt woefully behind in adding her special grandma gifts to Rosie\u2019s coffers. They went back to Viv\u2019s for the rest of the afternoon, looking through pictures of Rosie from her birth to the present.</p><p>There were, of course, many pictures of Franci. \u201cSometimes when you catch her looking at the baby, her eyes are glowing, but other times...\u201d Maureen\u2019s voice trailed off.</p><p>\u201cI know. It was a very hard time\u2014she wasn\u2019t at peace with her decision to be away from Sean. She was already three months pregnant when she came home to Santa Rosa, but she got right to work in the local hospital. She took six weeks of maternity leave and went back. It was not only a long year, but heartbreaking to watch my daughter\u2019s sadness. I kept thinking that any second he\u2019d realize what he\u2019d let slip away and come looking for her. But he didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Maureen pursed her lips so tightly they nearly disappeared. \u201cI\u2019d like to box his ears,\u201d she muttered.</p><p>\u201cRemember, he didn\u2019t know. Franci was the one to leave him. I was twenty-five when Franci was born,\u201d Vivian said. \u201cAnd thirty-two when my husband, a trucker, was killed in an accident. I went back to college almost immediately, in search of an education that would guarantee me a good income so I could raise my daughter alone. Franci at least had that much going for her\u2014she wasn\u2019t going to have any trouble supporting Rose. But, except for that, I knew how hard life was going to be for her without a partner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had a good husband while I raised my sons,\u201d Maureen said. \u201cHe was devoted, worked hard, stayed involved. But he worked long hours and, with five kids to support, he took as much overtime as he could get. I had to be able to do it alone\u2014I had to be strong and keep control of that brood. It wasn\u2019t easy, even with a good husband. It\u2019s hard to imagine how you and Franci\u2014\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWe had each other,\u201d Viv said. \u201cFranci came alive when we moved up here. Actually, I said I\u2019d come north only if I could find a good job. I only agreed to take an unpaid leave from my Santa Rosa job to give it a try. Franci flies out of Redding, so we initially went there, rented a small apartment and, on Franci\u2019s days off, I scoured the area for work. When I had a good offer in Eureka, the decision was made\u2014we bought a little house together here. Franci works a couple of twenty-four-hour shifts three weeks a month, then only one on the fourth week. It\u2019s a long commute\u2014but it\u2019s only seven or eight days a month, and my job never requires an overnight or on-call status. After two years in one little house, another just like it down the street came on the market and I bought it. We joined forces to make sure Rosie always had one of us plus the babysitter. It\u2019s been all right. It\u2019s been good. She was even starting to date again. But...\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut...?\u201d Maureen asked.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t know her after she broke up with Sean, so you wouldn\u2019t see the difference\u2014but since Sean\u2019s been in the picture, she\u2019s a different person. She loves him so much. And I believe he loves her just as much. I don\u2019t know how this is going to work out, Maureen, but those three need to be together.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSean told me he suggested marriage to Franci...\u201d Maureen said.</p><p>\u201cReally? That\u2019s the first I\u2019ve heard of it,\u201d Vivian said with some astonishment. \u201cI\u2019m surprised Franci didn\u2019t jump on that offer. There must be something not quite settled between them. Frankly, I don\u2019t care whether they get married or not as long as they follow the strength of their obvious feelings! Well, I\u2019m staying out of it. Except for one thing\u2014I\u2019m going to be sure Franci knows she doesn\u2019t have to consider me in her decision.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou?\u201d Maureen asked.</p><p>Vivian nodded. \u201cI don\u2019t want her to think I need her to take care of me\u2014not emotionally or in any other way. I have a full life and look forward to the next stage. I have a wonderful man in my life\u2014I expect he\u2019ll be around a very long time. We\u2019ve been seeing each other the past year and both of us have had commitments that have kept us from moving forward\u2014he\u2019s a fairly new widower with two teenagers, and I\u2019ve had my responsibilities to Francie and Rosie. But Carl and I have both known for quite a while that when our kids don\u2019t need us quite as much, we\u2019ll have more of each other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Maureen said, intrigued. \u201cA man?\u201d</p> <p>Vivian laughed. \u201cA wonderful man. He was one of my bosses. A year after his wife\u2019s death he invited me out to dinner, and that was all it took.\u201d</p><p>Maureen leaned toward Vivian. \u201cAn office romance? I heard that was taboo!\u201d</p><p>\u201cPah! We work together very well! I imagine we will for many years!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow amazing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll meet him sometime. In the meantime, my offer stands. If you want to stay close to Rosie, but give your boys some space, Rosie\u2019s overnight room makes a perfectly useful guest room. You\u2019re welcome to it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you obviously have a private life!\u201d</p> <p>Vivian just laughed. \u201cDon\u2019t let that get in your way! Especially in your wild imagination! Once you meet Carl, you\u2019ll be completely at ease around him. He\u2019s a physician\u2014a wonderful, warm, loving man. Besides, we don\u2019t have many pajama parties, Carl and I. As I said, he has teenagers at home!\u201d</p><p>Maureen was thoughtful for a moment. \u201cYou\u2019re very liberal in your thinking, aren\u2019t you, Vivian?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose I am,\u201d Viv said. \u201cAnd you\u2019re quite the prude, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I\u2019m told,\u201d Maureen said, somewhat grumpily.</p><p>Vivian laughed. \u201cWe should make an interesting and strange pair!\u201d</p><p>Eleven</p><p>Once Rosie was tucked in, the lights were out and it was quiet, Sean and Franci sat on the living room sofa, a couple of glasses of wine on the coffee table. They talked quietly and the side of Sean she rarely saw was illuminated. Franci had wanted him to grow up, act like a family man, show responsibility. Then when he did, she wanted the old Sean back, fanciful and full of spontaneity. Seeing Sean act like an adult was a little scary.</p><p>She had to admit, when he got down to business, he was up to the job. His list of things that had to be done immediately was impressive. First he intended to visit the air force JAG and get a new will drafted so his daughter would be taken care of. He was going to transfer money out of his investments into a college trust for Rosie, a large enough stake so that even if Franci never contributed another dime, it would probably grow into enough. He had a hundred-thousand-dollar life-insurance policy in which his mother was beneficiary\u2014all the Riordan boys did. They had not begun to help support their mother yet, but it looked as though the time was growing near. As often as these boys were involved in risky jobs, they had all agreed on individual policies so that each one would be holding up his end.</p> <p>But Sean was going to immediately apply for an additional two hundred and fifty thousand, plus sign over his military death benefit to Rosie, with Franci as the executor, so that if the worst happened she and Rosie would be cared for.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get those things taken care of right away,\u201d he told her. \u201cAnd I\u2019ll spend the morning on the phone with MPC about assignments but, as you probably remember, that can take weeks. Now I have to ask you this\u2014will you even consider going with me on assignment?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d she said wearily, uncertainly. She sipped her wine. \u201cSean, I\u2019m so enmeshed in this place. I own a house and Rosie is settled. I don\u2019t need that job at the college, but it\u2019s good for me\u2014it not only keeps me sharp, but I use their track for some running, and work out in the college weight room. And there\u2019s my mom...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d he said softly.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s my best friend. And she moved up here with me to help take care of Rosie. They\u2019re real close.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d He leaned toward her. \u201cIs there anyplace you\u2019d be willing to go with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d she returned. \u201cI don\u2019t under\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are U-2 assignments around the world, Fran. Accompanied tours. Alaska, England, Okinawa, the Philippines, the high desert in Southern California. I could probably sell my soul for a non-flying staff job in San Antonio at the Military Personnel Center or the Pentagon until Air Command and Staff materializes. It\u2019s always hard to get back in the cockpit once you do that, but I\u2019m willing to take that chance.\u201d Then he shrugged. \u201cI could skip any assignments that come with a time commitment, just get the three years I owe them out of the way, then do my best to get an airline job.\u201d</p><p>She gave a huff of laughter. \u201cSean, the airlines are in the tank. They have such a deep pilot furlough list, none of them are hiring.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could go in the cabin business with Luke,\u201d he said. He reached toward her and ran a finger through that super-short hair at her temple. \u201cYou need time to think.\u201d</p><p>She felt her eyes glisten with tears. \u201cI wanted time for us to get to know each other again. So far so good,\u201d she said. \u201cBut it\u2019s only been a little over a week.\u201d</p><p>He grabbed her hand and pulled her toward him and across his lap, holding her against him. \u201cAnd it\u2019s been good. Very good. Think as fast as you can, Franci.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe the best thing for us to concentrate on is how we can be the best co-parents. We seem to do that pretty well. We both love Rosie.\u201d</p><p>He put his lips against her neck. He licked his way up to her ear. \u201cWe\u2019ll always be more than co-parents, and you know it.\u201d</p><p>Sean and Franci made out on the couch until clothing got in the way, then by mutual consent they went to her bed. Sean was the one to close the door so Rosie wouldn\u2019t find them and be traumatized; Franci was the one to supply condoms.</p><p>\u201cI missed a condom once,\u201d he murmured against her lips. \u201cWhat a lucky break that was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t have thought so at the time,\u201d she pointed out.</p><p>\u201cYou were right about one thing, Franci\u2014we\u2019ve both changed a lot in the past few years and I\u2019m for not going back.\u201d</p><p>And then he went to work on her body in his own expert way. He kissed her ankles, sucked her toes, licked her inner thighs, worked her clitoris with his tongue. He pushed his thumb into her velvety softness while he licked at her core. He snaked the other hand up to her mouth to cover it so that her moans of ecstasy were muffled. When she claimed she couldn\u2019t bear another orgasm, he was inside her, rocking her slowly and gently\u2014excruciatingly slowly and gently. He pressed rhythmically against the deepest part of her and the build came upon her gradually, but when she tried to hurry him, to push him to move deeper, faster, he kept up that easy pace until she whimpered. Begged. \u201cPlease, Sean...Finish...\u201d She dug her heels into the mattress and pushed back hard.</p><p>His chuckle was soft and low; his thrusts grew deep and powerful, and that was all it took. She broke apart from the inside, clenching against him, grabbing him to her, bathing him in hot liquid. And he said, \u201cAhhhh, baby. I love that sweet spot.\u201d And he slammed into her, letting himself go in a low moan of pleasure.</p><p>He held her in the aftermath for a long time, the blanket drawn over them. She finally whispered, \u201cYou should go. You have a lot to do in the morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m staying tonight. Put on my T-shirt and I\u2019ll sleep in my jeans in case someone\u2019s wandering in the night. But I\u2019m staying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour mother will know you spent the night with me...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI dare her to say one word to me,\u201d he said. \u201cI want to be with you.\u201d</p><p>Franci wanted to argue, but not really. She pulled on his shirt as he told her to and enjoyed the scent of him. She was vaguely aware of Sean slipping into his jeans and she smiled to herself. She knew he liked to sleep in the nude and would be uncomfortable, but she appreciated his protection of Rosie\u2019s innocence.</p><p>And when she woke hours later in the predawn, she found Rosie curled against his chest, sleeping between them, safe and content.</p><p>Francine cut out of school a little on the early side on Monday. Her classes were finished and she didn\u2019t have any appointments, and she knew that Sean would be at the house with Rosie. Maureen would probably be there, too. She found herself anxious to hear about their day. Rosie was having a circus with a new daddy and grandma.</p><p>Franci had to hand it to Maureen; she was coming off very relaxed and accepting. If memory served, Franci knew her to be rather stiff in her morals\u2014she did not, for example, approve of unmarried people having sex. For Sean and Franci, that ship had sailed long ago. And Maureen would notice that Sean had not gone back to Luke\u2019s last night.</p><p>Franci had called Sean between her classes and asked, \u201cDid your mother say anything about you spending the night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d he said with a laugh. \u201cShe can\u2019t keep her mouth shut about anything!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did she say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe asked me if I wasn\u2019t complicating an already complicated situation. And I told her I wasn\u2019t discussing it with her, so if she wanted to enjoy her time with Rosie she\u2019d better drop it. And to my amazement, she did. Grandchildren, I discovered, provide amazing leverage.\u201d</p><p>When Franci walked in the house a few hours later, she encountered one of the biggest messes she\u2019d ever seen. Newspapers were spread over the island in the kitchen, covered with pumpkin guts. She could see the spills on the floor\u2014seeds that had gotten away\u2014and three pumpkins were in the middle of the carving process on the dining room table. One huge, one large and one small. The pumpkin family.</p><p>\u201cNuts,\u201d Sean said. \u201cYou\u2019re home early. We were going to surprise you. We\u2019ve gotta have jack-o\u2019-lanterns for Halloween!\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMama!\u201d Rosie shouted excitedly. Then pointing, she said, \u201cDaddy, Mommy, Rosie!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWere you going to surprise me with the cleanup?\u201d she asked hopefully.</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d he said. \u201cMaybe you should just go to your room and read or something until I have a chance to get things under control.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll go change and then come and help,\u201d she said. Briefcase in hand, she went to her bedroom and within five seconds she was immediately back in the dining room. \u201cThere appears to be a large duffel bag in my bedroom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m moving in for a while, unless you throw me out. My mom is at Luke\u2019s for the evening. She and I will spend tomorrow afternoon with Rosie while you\u2019re in Redding at work. I thought I\u2019d take babysitting duty while you do your twenty-four-hour shift. If that\u2019s okay with you. Wednesday morning, while Rosie\u2019s at preschool and day care, I\u2019m driving my mom to the airport. She\u2019s going home to get some things done around her condo so she can come right back. I guess the plants are dying, and the bills need to be paid. On the way over here this afternoon, after picking up my things at Luke\u2019s, I scoped out the pumpkin patch and bought new pajamas.\u201d He grinned at her. \u201cI thought you might be annoyed we didn\u2019t invite you along, so I took lots of pictures.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWeren\u2019t you going to ask?\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cAbout the pumpkin patch?\u201d he returned.</p><p>\u201cAbout the pajamas,\u201d she stressed.</p> <p>He straightened and his expression was serious. \u201cI was going to beg. I have four weeks of leave, if they don\u2019t call me in early. Can you put up with me? If I\u2019m neat?\u201d</p><p>Her heart swelled, but she was afraid to let it show. He\u2019d always been neat. In fact, he was a little on the fussy side. Things he valued had to be perfectly maintained\u2014his home, his car, his man toys. Put up with him?</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve never actually done this before, you know,\u201d she pointed out to him. \u201cWe\u2019ve never really lived together.\u201d</p><p>The look in his eyes was tender. \u201cWe should have.\u201d</p><p>Rosie was a princess for Halloween, big surprise. There was a battle about wearing the plastic high heels without socks, and Sean was relieved when Franci handled that war without getting him involved. She let Sean take Rosie around the neighborhood for candy while she stayed home to hand it out to the goblins who came to her door. And then the tussle over how much candy Rosie could eat was handled again by Franci.</p><p>Franci thought she\u2019d won the battle. Rosie was allowed two and a half pieces of candy, followed by bath and bed. The combination of the cold weather, the trek around the neighborhood and the excitement of the whole thing wore her out and Rosie crashed by seven-thirty. However, she sprang awake and was ready to party at 2:00 a.m. She was suddenly standing right beside Sean, wearing her princess dress. \u201cDaddy?\u201d she asked. \u201cAre you still on bacation?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat are you doing up? And in your fancy dress?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI dunno,\u201d she answered with a shrug. \u201cCan we twick or tweet again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s two in the morning, Rose. Everyone is in bed. Everyone but you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe candy,\u201d Franci moaned. \u201cA sugar charge, then a sugar drop-off, and then a recharge.\u201d She lifted up on an elbow and looked down at Sean. \u201cYour turn, Daddy. You\u2019re on bacation.\u201d</p><p>Franci was a little surprised by how much relief she felt when Maureen left town; she hadn\u2019t realized that Sean\u2019s mother made her tense. Once it was back to just the three of them, life seemed calmer. Simpler and easier. When Franci worked, Sean was in charge; when Franci was home, Vivian didn\u2019t interfere, but left them to what passed for family life. It wasn\u2019t as though she and Sean had made concrete plans, though they couldn\u2019t until Sean had some idea what was next for him with the air force. They were still rolling along, one day at a time. They did a lot of talking about the possibilities, but so much was up in the air until Sean had some idea what his next assignment would be.</p><p>They hadn\u2019t said the I love you\u2019s yet, at least not in the clear light of day. She\u2019d heard him whisper it in the dark of night when he thought she was asleep. But everything they talked about had them moving forward as a team as best they could under such uncertain circumstances.</p><p>Franci decided that when Maureen came back to town, which she was planning to do fairly soon, she would make the time to have a private conversation with her, make sure they were on the same page, so their relationship could be as smooth and tension free as possible\u2014for all their sakes.</p><p>One thing that she had to deal with immediately, however, was T.J. She hadn\u2019t spoken to him in more than a week\u2014ever since that last call he\u2019d made to her cell phone while she was working in Redding. She could almost feel the trouble brewing like a storm cloud\u2014he had stopped calling and she had made no effort to get in touch with him. It was a standoff. She had to put it to rest. Even if she and Sean didn\u2019t go one step further in their relationship, she\u2019d never again spend time with T.J.</p> <p>She knew he kept office hours on Thursdays when he was in town, so after teaching her two classes she went to his office. She found he was in conference with a student when she arrived, so she jotted a note on the clipboard hanging outside the closed door. Went to get a soda, she wrote. Be back in ten minutes to see you. When she returned, his door was ajar and he was seated at his desk in the small campus office. She tapped on the open door and he looked up. Then he sat back in the chair, pulled off his reading glasses and swiveled in her direction. \u201cCome in, Francine. Close the door. I\u2019ve been wondering when you\u2019d show up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI should have stopped by sooner, but life got real hectic,\u201d she said, entering and pulling the door closed. There was one chair beside his desk and she sat there.</p><p>\u201cI can imagine,\u201d he said. \u201cHow\u2019s the new guy working out?\u201d</p><p>She laughed uncomfortably. \u201cThat was direct,\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019s not new, as you already know. And he came with a mother and four brothers and lots of other complications. But we\u2019re getting along just fine, thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can see that,\u201d he said.</p><p>She tilted her head and frowned a little bit. \u201cYou can?\u201d</p><p>He leaned toward her. \u201cI used to be the one to put that shine in your eyes.\u201d Then he laughed when she took on a slight blush. \u201cSo...I guess it\u2019s all settled. You\u2019re taking the leap. You\u2019ve moved on.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t know what to say for a moment. She was frankly surprised to find he was as pleasant as that. \u201cI guess you\u2019re letting me off without any explanation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t waste your breath. No matter what you say, Francine, we both know you\u2019re making a big mistake here. And we both know you\u2019re going to do it, anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMistake? Do you have any idea what it is I\u2019m doing? Because I don\u2019t recall explaining my plans to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs if that\u2019s necessary,\u201d he said with a harsh laugh. \u201cYou\u2019re going to give up everything you\u2019ve established here\u2014the stability of your job, your friends, the option of a normal relationship with a man you can count on who will make sure your happiness comes first. And you\u2019re going to do that for some flyboy kid who wouldn\u2019t commit to you in the first place. You\u2019ll end up sorry. Unhappy and full of regrets. He let you down before and he\u2019ll let you down again.\u201d</p><p>Ah. Now that was what she expected. She almost smiled\u2014she\u2019d never seen this side of T.J. when he was ordering her meals and asking her to grow out her hair, and she wondered now how she could have been so naive. Undoubtedly he thought he had been doing her a great service. But the second Sean turned up, he\u2019d let his true colors come out. He must have thought she would defer to him forever. He thought he owned her. She leaned toward him. \u201cWhen did you turn into this person?\u201d she asked, her voice rather soft under the circumstances. \u201cWere you always like this and I just didn\u2019t realize it? When you were telling me what to eat and how to wear my hair\u2014was that just the tip of the iceberg and I was too accommodating to understand what a mistake it was to allow that behavior?\u201d</p><p>He actually sneered at her. \u201cHow like you to see the worst in a good situation. I should have known better than to get mixed up with someone like you. You\u2019re a child.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, T.J., when did you become this kind of man? What did I miss? We dated for a few months, and in fact no more often than once a week, but I don\u2019t recall that we had the kind of relationship that would invite this kind of anger from you. We didn\u2019t have future plans, you and I.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOur relationship was stable. This thing you\u2019re trading it for, it\u2019ll be a disaster because he isn\u2019t moving to Humboldt County. Even if he could, you and I both know he isn\u2019t the kind of man who will give up anything for you. Or for his daughter. You\u2019ll have to give up everything you value and go chasing him around the world if you want to be with him. Trust me, you\u2019ll be right back where you started. Abandoned.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhoa,\u201d she said, affronted. \u201cI\u2019m not even going to ask you how you came to all these conclusions. I\u2019m not going to defend Sean to you, but have you ever met him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that any man who cared about you would have made it his business to find you a long time ago. I would have. If I thought you had any feelings for me whatsoever, I\u2019d tear up the country looking for you. And he never even tried.\u201d</p><p>Well, she thought, she had told him the whole, sad story. \u201cThere are things to resolve about that, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBefore you pull up stakes, you\u2019d better try to think clearly, Franci. There\u2019s still time for you to be smart, use that little tiny brain of yours. You know how I feel about you. And you know I can keep the blush on your cheeks, too. He might seem a little dangerous and daring and have that sex appeal that goes with jets and secret missions, but that will wear thin. He\u2019s a young idiot who likes living on the edge, and that isn\u2019t father material. You\u2019re going to be very disappointed.\u201d</p><p>A huff of laughter escaped her in spite of herself. \u201cSean? Dangerous?\u201d Then she laughed outright. \u201cMy tiny brain?\u201d She stood. \u201cI guess I\u2019m a little confused, T.J. I thought you liked me, but I had no idea you took our relationship as seriously as that, nor did I realize you didn\u2019t think I was smart. I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re angry. But I can\u2019t possibly describe how positively relieved I am that I won\u2019t be spending time with you ever again.\u201d</p><p>He stood as well. \u201cIf I\u2019m angry at all, it\u2019s because you led me on. I\u2019m not a kid anymore, Francine, and I know what works and what doesn\u2019t. A lot of that I learned the hard way, through my own mistakes. Just the way you will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBest of luck, T.J.,\u201d she said, turning to leave his office.</p><p>\u201cIf you come to your senses soon, get in touch. But I won\u2019t wait around long.\u201d</p><p>Well, that\u2019s a good thing, she thought. She turned back to look at him. \u201cDon\u2019t wait for me. In fact, go ahead and delete my phone number.\u201d And then she left the building.</p><p>It hit her that something about that little confrontation was all wrong! What was this talk about being the one to put the shine in her eyes? Hadn\u2019t he complained that they needed to \u201cturn up the heat\u201d? And how in the world had she led him on? By not complaining when he wanted to order for both of them? When going along with his plans for a date, though he never once asked her what she\u2019d like to do? She hadn\u2019t questioned the relationship because it had worked for her. And it had worked for her because she hadn\u2019t been emotionally invested. But neither had he!</p><p>She left the campus. All the way home she was asking herself how she had missed who he really was. And why hadn\u2019t the relationship grated on her more? You\u2019re a child, rang in her ears. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>And then something occurred to her\u2014she\u2019d lost her father when she was only seven. She\u2019d always longed for her father, for any father. The loss had devastated her! It was one of the many reasons she was so protective of Rosie\u2014she didn\u2019t want her hurt by a loss like that! In some convoluted way it seemed safer to raise Rosie alone rather than watch her little heart break with longing for a father she couldn\u2019t have!</p><p>And maybe it was that same sense of loss that allowed her to be so cooperative with a man like Professor Hottie! He took charge; he made as many decisions for her as she would allow! And if Sean hadn\u2019t come back into her life, who knows how far she would have let him go with his controlling, manipulative behavior.</p><p>He was right; she had been a child. She had allowed the whole thing to happen; she had no one to blame but herself. She hadn\u2019t realized what was happening.</p> <p>But she had never behaved that way with Sean; she had been strong, independent and convicted. And to his credit, Sean had never tried to control or manipulate her. He didn\u2019t always bend to her desires, but neither did he act as if he owned her. It was with great relief that she realized that, even in the worst of times, they didn\u2019t have that kind of relationship.</p><p>Oh, if they could ever get everything straight, she thought they had a chance of having the right kind of relationship. She almost laughed! As hard as things had been for them, they were healthy, well-adjusted people\u2014unlike T.J.</p><p>When she got home, she found Sean in the kitchen. He was turning thick pork chops over in a marinade and Franci could hear Rosie in the bedroom playing.</p><p>Sean grinned at her. \u201cHow was your day, dear?\u201d he asked, tilting his head in the direction of Rosie\u2019s room.</p><p>\u201cSurreal,\u201d she said in a whisper. \u201cDid you by any chance deal with that girl who\u2019s been texting you night and day?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDidn\u2019t I tell you? I finally got around to that a few days ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d it go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs expected. I asked her not to text or call anymore because I was back with my old girlfriend and she told me to go to hell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s all?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. She said if she saw me again she\u2019d kill me, and if she had a chance to loosen a few bolts on my airplane she\u2019d do it. She called me some choice names and hung up. Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d she said, shaking her head, looking away.</p> <p>\u201cYou had a meeting with him,\u201d he said. \u201cLet me guess, he listed my shortcomings even though he doesn\u2019t know me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d you know?\u201d</p><p>Sean pulled her close and, on his way to whisper in her ear, he gently sucked on her lobe. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t want to give you up, because you\u2019re you. Now, let\u2019s not talk about why. It makes me want to kill him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI saw a side of him that\u2019s always been there, but I completely overlooked it. It was very disturbing,\u201d she said. \u201cGuess what I just realized? You\u2019re the devil I know...\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d he said. \u201cLet\u2019s stick with that.\u201d</p><p>Maureen had gone home to Phoenix as planned. She only stayed in her condo for a week, during which time she gave away her houseplants, stopped the paper, forwarded her mail, closed up her condo and headed back, her trunk and backseat full of her essentials.</p><p>Maureen and Vivian had worked things out; Maureen was going back to Humboldt County for a rather long visit. She would stay through Thanksgiving\u2014a good three weeks. Although she would make use of Vivian\u2019s second bedroom, usually reserved for Rosie\u2019s overnights, and having her own car would allow her to spend quality time with Rosie, and everyone else. This arrangement would also allow her to give them all their space. In fact, not being dependent on her sons or her new friend Vivian for transportation would enable her to come and go as she pleased. After all, Vivian had a man in her life and would surely appreciate time alone with him now and then.</p><p>Other than telling Luke and Sean that she\u2019d be back for a visit and that she planned to stay through Thanksgiving, they didn\u2019t know her plans. They would no doubt be secretly thrilled to learn she wouldn\u2019t be staying with them! Vivian was a remarkable woman who wanted to assist Maureen in getting better acquainted with their mutual granddaughter, a gesture generous beyond belief. But as it turned out, different as they were, the women enjoyed each other\u2019s company.</p> <p>While she was headed north, driving through the Arizona desert, she decided to check in with all her sons. Of course, she only had to call one to do so. \u201cYou\u2019re doing what?\u201d Aiden demanded.</p><p>\u201cDriving to Virgin River. So I\u2019ll have a car while I\u2019m there. And I\u2019m staying with Rosie\u2019s other grandma so I don\u2019t become an annoying mother-in-law. I like Vivian. She\u2019s too liberal, but very sincere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, God,\u201d Aiden moaned into the phone. \u201cHow many hours is the drive?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that all depends on how fast I go,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s very long. I plan on stopping off for the night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStopping off where?\u201d he asked in frustration.</p><p>\u201cOkay, I might be all done talking to you now, since you insist on treating me like I just got my learner\u2019s permit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d he said, deliberately calming his voice. \u201cWhere do you suppose you\u2019ll stay the night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I left early, so I might make it all the way to Carson City. I\u2019ve been there\u2014nice little town. And Gardnerville is nearby. So is Reno and Lake Tahoe and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow many hours of driving is that?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cMany,\u201d she said. \u201cI wish you\u2019d stop this. I\u2019m a very good, confident driver. And I\u2019ve lived alone for twelve years. I know how to be safe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you call me? I would have come to Phoenix and driven you,\u201d he said tiredly.</p><p>\u201cOh, doesn\u2019t that sound like fun,\u201d she said with a short laugh. \u201cIt would probably turn into elder abuse. Besides, it\u2019s not practical. Someone\u2014probably me\u2014would have had to drive you back to Sacramento or at least Redding to catch a flight home.\u201d</p><p>He sighed into the phone. \u201cDo Luke and Sean know your plans yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told them I\u2019d be back for a long visit, but they might be in denial,\u201d she said. She heard Aiden laugh. \u201cIt makes sense for me to stay with Vivian. I\u2019ll be very busy, running between Rosie, and Luke and Shelby, and also hanging around with Vivian when neither of us has plans. I only want to be nearby to get to know Rosie better and I don\u2019t want to be a burden to my sons.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not a burden, Mom,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cOh? Then why does my doing as I please make you yell?\u201d</p><p>Aiden took a breath. \u201cI want you to check in every few hours as long as you have a signal. I want to hear from you when you stop for the night\u2014I want to know exactly where you are. Can we please agree to that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope I live to see you at sixty-two. I\u2019d like to hear firsthand just how you handle people pushing you around as though you\u2019re some doddering old\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t do that! I\u2019m just being cautious. It\u2019s not your age, it\u2019s your...your...You\u2019re a woman out on the road alone, Mom! And if I remember my geography, from Las Vegas to Reno is a pretty lonely stretch of road.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll lock my car doors so the wild mules don\u2019t get me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean, she\u2019s too liberal? Rosie\u2019s other grandmother?\u201d Aiden asked.</p><p>\u201cOh, you know. A lovely woman, really. Very likable and with a wonderful sense of humor. Just...Her values are more on the relaxed side, if you know what I mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t dare guess,\u201d Aiden muttered into the phone.</p><p>\u201cFor example, she\u2019s not too worried about Sean and Francine making this whole event right and proper. She\u2019d be happy as a clam if they\u2019d at least get together romantically, as if that will solve their problems. Wasn\u2019t that what got them into this mess? Not that I\u2019m the least sorry about Rosie\u2014she\u2019s the most brilliant child! I\u2019m so crazy about her! She reminds me a lot of Patrick when he was little\u2014except for the princess dresses and high-heeled slippers.\u201d</p><p>Aiden chuckled into the phone. \u201cI take back everything I said, Mom. Maybe this is a good idea.\u201d</p><p>Maureen got the impression Aiden hoped staying with liberal Viv would loosen her up. \u201cDon\u2019t get your hopes up, Aiden. I\u2019m pretty firm in my convictions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Mom. Understood.\u201d He laughed a little more. \u201cCall in a few hours. Please?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll try. Now relax, Aiden. I\u2019m listening to a book on tape and enjoying the ride.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope it\u2019s not the Bible,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s James Patterson\u2014death and sex and everything.\u201d And without another word, she hung up on him.</p><p>It was less than thirty minutes before her cell phone chimed. She glanced at the phone and saw it was Luke. She let him go to voice mail. Next was Sean, then Patrick and finally Colin. She smiled to herself; it was nice having all five boys in the United States. She let them all leave messages. She would entertain herself later by listening to them.</p><p>Really, she thought with amusement, how did they think she got to be this old without knowing anything? Pups. They were just pups.</p><p>As Maureen had fully expected, her sons welcomed her a little more warmly given the fact that she was staying with Vivian and not with them. But she was very surprised when Franci walked down the block to her mother\u2019s house a couple of days after Maureen\u2019s return. It was the afternoon, before Rosie was due home from day care. \u201cHi,\u201d she said almost sheepishly, when Maureen opened the door.</p><p>\u201cFranci! I thought you were working!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was. I got off at eight this morning, had a nap and I thought I\u2019d catch you before Sean brings Rosie home. I think maybe we should have a chat. Alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Maureen said, and she braced herself to be lectured not to interfere, to be seen and not heard, to not get in the way of things. \u201cPlease,\u201d she said, holding open the door. \u201cCan I make you a cup of coffee or something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I just wanted to say I\u2019m sorry you missed so much time with Rosie. I wish it hadn\u2019t been necessary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Franci,\u201d Maureen said before she could stop herself. \u201cWas it necessary?\u201d</p><p>Franci came inside the house. \u201cI thought so, yes,\u201d she said gently. \u201cThe Sean I knew four years ago and this Sean\u2014really, they\u2019re very different men. But that aside, most of it had to do with me. I loved him so much, I just couldn\u2019t bear to have him know everything and still walk away. Even worse was the thought that he\u2019d grudgingly man up and marry me, but hate his life.\u201d She shook her head. \u201cI didn\u2019t know which way it would go, Maureen. I had to do the best I could with the facts at hand. I\u2019m terribly sorry for what that cost you.\u201d</p><p>Maureen took one of Franci\u2019s hands. She smiled softly. \u201cI wish it hadn\u2019t gone the way it did, but I don\u2019t blame you, Franci. And I\u2019m so glad that\u2019s in the past and we can all move forward now. You\u2019ve done an amazing job with Rosie. She\u2019s the most wonderful child.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you won\u2019t hold it against me?\u201d Franci asked.</p><p>\u201cOf course not, darling,\u201d she said, pulling her into an embrace. Maureen held her tightly. \u201cOf course not! That boy of mine, however...\u201d She pulled back and looked into Franci\u2019s eyes. Maureen\u2019s were dancing, laughter making little crinkle lines at the corners. \u201cIs it too late to ground him?\u201d</p><p>Franci laughed with her. \u201cI think so,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad he\u2019s different. I guess he had some growing up to do. Maybe it was his fault, maybe it was mine. Maybe I let him get by with too much when he was a kid. Whatever, it\u2019s too late for all that blaming. Right now there\u2019s a family to mend. You and Sean are doing a very good job of that. I\u2019m very proud of both of you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Luke and Shelby had met Rosie, but only briefly\u2014over the past few weeks everyone had been very focused on letting her get used to the large Riordan clan slowly. And there was more to come\u2014Shelby\u2019s whole family was in Virgin River. Luke wanted to have a big party and invited not only his family but also Walt Booth, Muriel St. Claire, Paul and Vanessa Haggerty and their two little ones. And of course there was Art, who was as much a member of his family as anyone. It was the first Riordan gathering since Luke and Shelby\u2019s wedding, and this time it would include Franci, Rosie and Vivian.</p><p>On a Saturday when Franci wasn\u2019t working, they all gathered at Luke\u2019s house, and royalty could not have been welcomed with any more enthusiasm than Franci and Rosie. It was just enough family to stuff Luke\u2019s relatively small house. All the women brought dishes to accompany a very large ham and prime rib. Furniture had to be moved around, and with the November weather growing so cold, the fire blazed in the hearth and the house throbbed with the noise of good times and the laughter of children.</p><p>The cold didn\u2019t affect Rosie\u2014she wanted to fish...and fish and fish. First, Sean took her along with Art, then Luke took her, then Franci took her and finally Maureen had a turn. She wanted to fish rather than eat; she wanted to fish rather than have a nap. She was told she could only fish with Mommy\u2019s or Daddy\u2019s permission and never without an adult along. She squealed and pitched a little fit about staying in, even though her fingers, toes and nose were bright pink. As soon as her fit ended, however, she passed out cold, exhausted.</p> <p>In the late afternoon, as everyone allowed their big meal to settle before they tackled dessert, the children napped peacefully on the sofas. The women gathered around the dining room table, Art wandered off to fish some more and the Riordan brothers, plus Walt and Paul, stood on the porch with beers and cigars.</p><p>Luke was the one to broach the subject that was on everyone\u2019s mind. \u201cWhat happens now, Sean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnyone\u2019s guess. What should happen\u2014I should go remote without a family or to a foreign base until a slot at Air Command and Staff opens up. But I\u2019ve been all over the flesh peddlers at MPC looking for a job that carries me over a year or two and has a squadron in my future. The possibilities have been interesting\u2014everything from an attach\u00e9 position in Belgium to a test-pilot job in the high desert in Southern California.\u201d He coughed. \u201cThey\u2019ve suggested plenty of open time in the sandbox.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does Franci say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe says to let her know when I have an actual question and she\u2019ll try to come up with an answer.\u201d They all laughed. \u201cListen, isn\u2019t it obvious? I don\u2019t want to be away from them, but asking her to leave her mom, her home and her job right now is asking a lot, and I don\u2019t even know that I\u2019ll go someplace I can take a family. I\u2019m trying to keep so many balls in the air, I don\u2019t know which end is up. And on the first of December I have to go back to work. To Beale. Any second now, my orders will be cut.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your dream job?\u201d Luke asked.</p><p>\u201cAir Command and Staff on my way back to Beale as squadron commander,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019d probably have to do some time at the Pentagon or MPC en route to pay my dues for my upgrade. I had it in my head I was going all the way\u2014retire as a full bull at least.\u201d He glanced at Walt, who had retired from the army with three stars. \u201cTo tell the truth, I had my eye on a star or two. Sir. Now, I\u2019m not so sure I\u2019ll make it to retirement.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s going okay with Franci?\u201d Aiden asked.</p><p>\u201cWith my mother living four doors away with Franci\u2019s mother? I\u2019d say we\u2019re doing pretty well in spite of that. One more person gets in our business and we\u2019re probably doomed.\u201d He laughed and shook his head. There was silence for a few moments and Sean finally said, \u201cI regret that I didn\u2019t know about Rosie four years ago, but it terrifies me to think how I might have reacted. I thought I was a man of the world at twenty-eight, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>Walt Booth put an arm around his shoulders. \u201cSon, I bet there\u2019s not a man on this porch who doesn\u2019t feel like looking back and changing a few things. Just do right by your family now. And if there\u2019s anything I can do to help, just say the word.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGot any favors to call in, sir?\u201d Sean asked.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll give it some thought, son, but the problem there...they\u2019d be army favors.\u201d</p><p>Sean shook his head. \u201cThat\u2019s kind of the way my luck\u2019s been going lately.\u201d</p><p>When the men walked back in the house, Rosie popped up from her sleeping position on the couch and said, \u201cDaddy? Go fishing now?\u201d</p><p>Twelve</p><p>Ellie Baldwin was very proud of herself. Although she and Noah met with the seller\u2019s Realtor together, he hardly opened his mouth. She had researched the property and hired Paul Haggerty to check the house for its structural competence. Paul took care of things immediately and provided them with a folder filled with notes that brought the price down by a quarter. The money would be spent on the extensive repairs the owner should have made on the house, she told the Realtor.</p><p>Of course their offer was accepted; the seller was anxious to unload the money pit. The closing on the property was scheduled right away, which thrilled Ellie to no end. She asked Noah why he didn\u2019t get more involved in the negotiations. \u201cYou had the situation well under control, and you\u2019re absolutely right about me\u2014I might\u2019ve backed down. Ellie, pretty soon you\u2019re going to have to accept how smart you really are.\u201d</p><p>She stayed tense about the sale until the closing on the property. It had been less than a week but, to Ellie, it had felt like a month. The seller owned the place outright and Noah had some kind of retirement trust as collateral. The mortgage approval was a banker\u2019s dream and the closing followed quickly.</p><p>When they left the title company after signing the final papers that Friday morning, and the old house was completely theirs, she flew into Noah\u2019s arms and almost knocked him down in her excitement. He laughed as he grabbed her. \u201cWhoa! You\u2019re the only woman I know who would be so grateful for that trash heap of a house!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNoah, one day that\u2019s going to be the most beautiful house in Virgin River. It\u2019s going to take a while and some hard work, but it will be. You wait and see!\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get married now. We have the license. We have to get married before we can send legal paperwork to Trevor\u2019s biological father to release him for adoption, so let\u2019s get it done. We\u2019ll put up a notice for Friday night, a week from today.\u201d He grinned. \u201cIn England they call it posting the banns. We can call Harry Shipton from Grace Valley, ask him to officiate\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNoah! What about George? Don\u2019t you think George would want to marry us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just hope he can get away on short notice so he can be my best man. Let\u2019s do it, Ellie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo fast?\u201d she asked. \u201cIs that what you want to do? It won\u2019t be much of a wedding,\u201d she said, concerned. \u201cYou\u2019re the town pastor. You should probably put more effort into it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll have a nice little ceremony and a potluck in the basement\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe basement? But we don\u2019t have tables and chairs yet. The kitchen might be ready for a potluck, but I don\u2019t feel right about rounding up volunteers to clean up for our wedding. We\u2019ve only known these people a few months. I don\u2019t want to take advantage of them. If we only have ten guests, we don\u2019t want them working for their supper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen let\u2019s ask Jack. I hear that\u2019s where most town parties happen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess we could do that,\u201d she said. \u201cDo we pay Jack for that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll talk to him about it. It works for me if it works for Jack,\u201d he said. \u201cBut how about you, Ellie? Do you want more time to plan? To make it fancier? I know you\u2019ve never had a real wedding.\u201d</p><p>Nor had she ever expected one. Oh, every young girl dreams of that special event when she\u2019s gowned in splendor and is queen for a day, but Ellie knew that in her case it was only a dream. She was a poor girl, marrying a simple minister; she had no family but her children. Her life right now was better than it had ever been; she wasn\u2019t going to get greedy. \u201cMarrying you is the best thing that could ever happen to me. I\u2019m very happy, Noah. Will you wear your wedding-funeral suit?\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cAre you going to wear a huge white dress?\u201d he asked with a grin.</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019m about the most unlikely virgin in Virgin River. Vanessa is way ahead of us\u2014she said she has a dress that\u2019s perfect for me, with just enough cleavage to make it look like I bought it for myself.\u201d</p><p>He dug in his pocket and pulled out a ring. \u201cWill you wear this?\u201d</p><p>The diamond wasn\u2019t large as diamonds go, but from Ellie\u2019s perspective it was enormous. She never in her wildest dreams expected jewelry. \u201cIs it real?\u201d she asked in a breath. When he nodded, she asked, \u201cCan we afford this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEllie, we can\u2019t afford anything!\u201d He laughed.</p><p>\u201cNoah, have you lost your mind? I don\u2019t need something like this! I\u2019d rather have a washing machine!\u201d</p><p>He took her chin in his big hand, tilted her face up and said, \u201cEllie, I love you. I want you to have something special. I wish it was more special\u2014you\u2019re a nine-carat woman.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cIt\u2019s a speck. You can hardly see it with the naked eye.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s incredible.\u201d</p><p>He gave her a kiss. \u201cI don\u2019t know how you manage to be so grateful for such simple things, but I want you to know I\u2019ll never take that for granted. It\u2019s priceless. You\u2019re the jewel!\u201d</p><p>She put her arms around his neck and held him close, kissing him back. \u201cYou\u2019re one crazy preacher,\u201d she said. And then she smiled. \u201cOkay, then. If Harry\u2019s available, I\u2019ll do it. But until we can get that lean-to in shape, we\u2019re going to be spending the night over the Fitches\u2019 garage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care where I sleep as long as it\u2019s next to you,\u201d he said.</p><p>Virgin River was especially good at things like last-minute weddings and impromptu parties at the bar. Harry Shipton didn\u2019t have enough of a social life to prevent him from performing a wedding on Friday night and was glad to do it. When Ellie asked Preacher if he could come up with some kind of a small wedding cake for them, his grin was so big she was afraid his face would crack.</p><p>Noah announced it at Sunday service, which had grown by a few people each week so that now it wasn\u2019t unusual to have as many as fifty people in church. Jack put a notice on the front door of the bar saying they\u2019d be closed Friday night to celebrate the marriage of Ellie Baldwin and Pastor Noah Kincaid, and the price of admission was a covered dish. Right next to that, Noah put up a for-sale notice for the RV.</p><p>\u201cAnd where are you two lovebirds going on your honeymoon?\u201d Jack asked.</p><p>\u201cDown the street with a hammer and bucket of nails,\u201d Noah said. \u201cFirst of all, Ellie won\u2019t even consider a honeymoon that doesn\u2019t include the kids...\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t that kind of defeat the purpose?\u201d Jack asked.</p><p>\u201cThat was my question,\u201d Noah said.</p><p>Jack clapped a strong hand on Noah\u2019s shoulder. \u201cAfter you\u2019re married, I\u2019ll explain about the reason for cartoons. There are side effects, but it\u2019s worth it.\u201d Noah\u2019s brow crinkled in confusion. \u201cYou said, \u2018first of all\u2019...Was there a second thing?\u201d Jack asked.</p><p>\u201cEllie is so excited about that old house, she can\u2019t wait to get in there and start cleaning and fixing. To tell the truth, I\u2019m a little excited about it, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHaven\u2019t you had enough fixing for a while?\u201d Jack asked. \u201cYou threw yourself into that old church.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI had a lot of help,\u201d he said, \u201cbut I\u2019m proud of it now. Doesn\u2019t she just shine? You don\u2019t have to be embarrassed to walk in that church. Not that I couldn\u2019t be every bit as profound in a dump, but that church shines!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNoah, one of the things I like best about you is your humility.\u201d Jack put a complimentary beer on the bar. \u201cLoosen up, why don\u2019t you. So, you\u2019re letting the RV go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan only support so many households, Jack,\u201d he said, lifting the beer.</p> <p>\u201cYou expect to sell it, with gas prices like they are? With this economy in the toilet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah,\u201d Noah said. \u201cNot as a travel vehicle, anyway. But the price is right for an apartment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is the price?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have any idea,\u201d Noah said. \u201cBut I\u2019ll know it when I hear it.\u201d</p><p>George Davenport hadn\u2019t been in favor of Noah\u2019s ardent pursuit of the old church in Virgin River; he was afraid the boy would waste away there. But he had to admit, that was hardly the case now. Noah was thriving. It was a three-tiered success for the young minister. First, the church had needed his attention, and once it was a functional building, the people came. Noah did what he did best\u2014he inspired them. Second, the town had embraced him, and George didn\u2019t know when he\u2019d seen a more special, nurturing small town. But third, and probably most important, Noah had found himself a good woman.</p> <p>It made George very happy to see Noah settling down with Ellie and her children. They were good together; they had great balance. Noah seemed to have the stability and commitment Ellie needed in her life, and Ellie had the spark Noah needed in his. Together they were going to parent Ellie\u2019s children well. And they\u2019d already established a fine extended family in Jo and Nick Fitch, and solid friendships at the core of the community.</p><p>In addition to all that, George found he loved visiting Virgin River. At seventy, he was putting in fewer teaching hours, traveling more, socializing often. He\u2019d retired as a Presbyterian minister at the age of fifty and had been held captive at the university ever since. He worked to stay busy, to keep from getting old, but he was beginning to think more play would keep him younger longer.</p><p>The moment Noah had called him, George turned his two classes over to his teaching assistant and packed his bags. He liked the drive to Virgin River from Washington; it was long and beautiful. He\u2019d always enjoyed solitude as much as he enjoyed people.</p><p>It was the dinner hour of a cold November day when he hit town; the sun was down and a welcoming light shone from the window of Jack\u2019s. He went there first, thinking he might run into Noah.</p><p>\u201cWell, look what the cat dragged in,\u201d Jack called from behind the bar. \u201cI heard you were coming for the wedding. Didn\u2019t waste any time, did you?\u201d</p><p>George grinned and hung his coat on the peg by the door. He glanced around quickly to see if he could spot Noah, but what he saw instead knocked the wind out of him. That stunning redhead from the wedding he\u2019d attended here about a month ago was having dinner with her family. He recognized her immediately as Luke Riordan\u2019s mother, Maureen. Before he could shake himself, he realized he was staring at her. She sat at a table by the fire with Luke, Shelby and Art.</p> <p>George had to force his eyes away and go up to the bar. He stuck out his hand and greeted Jack. \u201cI thought maybe I\u2019d find Noah here, getting dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHaven\u2019t seen him since this morning,\u201d Jack said. \u201cIf he doesn\u2019t turn up soon, I bet you\u2019ll find him down at the Fitch house. You just drive in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is my first stop after a very long day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me get you something to drink,\u201d Jack offered. \u201cWhat\u2019s your pleasure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy driving is done for the day. How about a nice Scotch? Ice and water, please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou got it, George. And if you\u2019re interested, Preacher whipped up some pork tenderloin in sauerkraut that is not sour. He simmers it in beer all day and it\u2019s out of this world. It\u2019s one of his best dishes.\u201d Jack turned away to fix a drink for George, but as it was with Jack, he just kept talking. \u201cSo, we\u2019re having a wedding. Party here afterward. Everyone\u2019s pretty excited about it. I never would\u2019ve guessed when Ellie hit town that she\u2019d snag herself our minister.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sure Noah didn\u2019t do the snagging?\u201d George asked.</p><p>\u201cNow that you mention it, I\u2019m not sure.\u201d</p> <p>George managed some small talk, but his mind was elsewhere. He remembered meeting Maureen at Luke and Shelby\u2019s wedding reception out at the general\u2019s house. His first thought was that she was a damn fine-looking fifty-year-old woman, but when he was informed she was Luke\u2019s mother, making her over sixty, he was speechless. He did his best to charm her right on the spot, but she was preoccupied with the wedding. And having all her military sons present distracted her; she\u2019d not seen them in quite a while.</p><p>George had had an immediate hope of seeing her again, but he doubted he\u2019d be so lucky. She lived in Phoenix, her sons were scattered everywhere with only Luke in Virgin River, and what were the chances he\u2019d visit Virgin River at the same time she did? With disappointment, he\u2019d given up on the idea of getting to know her better.</p><p>\u201cGeorge?\u201d Jack asked.</p><p>\u201cHm?\u201d he said, jerking to attention. \u201cSorry, Jack. My mind must have been wandering.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI said, why don\u2019t you go say hello to them. The Riordans.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you read my mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, George. I followed your eyes.\u201d Jack tilted his head toward the Riordans\u2019 table.</p><p>George just laughed; he didn\u2019t embarrass easily. \u201cGood idea. If Noah comes in, see if you can keep him busy for a while.\u201d</p><p>As George approached their table, Luke immediately stood. \u201cSir,\u201d he said, stretching out a hand. And George remembered that these Riordan boys gave the impression of being scamps but their manners toward women and their elders were impeccable. The lot of them were a long way from being boys\u2014George suspected Luke was nearly forty\u2014but clearly they\u2019d been raised with a firm hand. Probably by their parents, their priests and their military bosses.</p><p>\u201cLuke, Shelby,\u201d George said with a nod, taking Luke\u2019s hand. \u201cHow\u2019s married life?\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcellent, sir. Thanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cArt, how are you? And, Mrs. Riordan, wonderful to see you again.\u201d</p><p>Maureen looked at him with a slight frown. \u201cForgive me, I know we met, but I just can\u2019t remember\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cGeorge Davenport,\u201d he said with a slight nod of his head. \u201cA friend of Pastor Kincaid\u2019s. I was in town for Shelby and Luke\u2019s wedding as it was Noah\u2019s debut at the church. Splendid affair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGeorge, please sit down,\u201d Luke said. \u201cVisit a while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, don\u2019t mind if I do.\u201d George pulled a chair over from an empty table and sat right beside Maureen so that she was sandwiched between himself and Art. \u201cWhat brings you back to town so soon?\u201d he asked her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m, ah, visiting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFantastic,\u201d he said. \u201cA long visit, I hope.\u201d</p><p>Luke took his seat, chuckling as he did so. \u201cI have a brother here right now\u2014Sean. You might remember him as my best man. He just discovered he has a young daughter in the area. Mom is visiting us and getting to know her first granddaughter, Rosie, three and a half and smart as a whip.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow wonderful!\u201d George said enthusiastically. \u201cYou must be having the time of your life!\u201d</p><p>Maureen lifted a thin brow, wary of his reaction. \u201cI am enjoying her, yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFirst one? I suppose before too much longer the other boys will be adding to the flock.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly the married ones, I hope,\u201d Maureen said. \u201cDo you have grandchildren, Mr. Davenport?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, let\u2019s not be so formal\u2014I\u2019m George. Only step-grandchildren. I had no children of my own, in fact. Noah\u2019s the closest thing to a son I\u2019ve ever had, but I started out as his teacher. I\u2019m a professor at Seattle Pacific University. I\u2019ve known him quite a few years now. I\u2019m here to be his best man on Friday night. I hope you\u2019re all coming to the wedding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWouldn\u2019t miss it,\u201d Luke said, grabbing Shelby\u2019s hand.</p><p>\u201cAnd...Maureen?\u201d George asked pointedly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure,\u201d she said evasively.</p><p>\u201cWell, try to come,\u201d he said. \u201cThese Virgin River people know how to have a good time. In fact, I have an idea. Once I have my best-man duties out of the way, I suggest we go to dinner. I\u2019ll take you someplace nice in one of the coast towns, though it\u2019ll be hard to improve on Preacher\u2019s cooking. But we deserve some time away from all these young people, don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcuse me, George?\u201d she asked. \u201cI assume you were married?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwice, as a matter of fact. Divorced a long time ago and, more recently, widowed. My wife died a few years ago. Maybe we should pick an evening and exchange phone numbers,\u201d he suggested.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s very nice of you, but no. I don\u2019t go out with men.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d he asked, surprised by her immediate refusal. \u201cAnd why is that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a widow,\u201d she said. \u201cA single woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat a coincidence. And I\u2019m a single man. I\u2019m all for free thinking, but I wouldn\u2019t ask you to dinner were I married. Are you recently widowed?\u201d Out of the corner of his eye, George saw Luke snicker and look away.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Maureen said.</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m sorry,\u201d he said. \u201cI was under the impression it had been years. When did you lose your husband, Maureen?\u201d</p><p>She looked a bit shocked to be put on the spot like that. It was apparent she was trying to gather her wits. She put out her hand. \u201cIt was so nice to see you again, Mr....George. I\u2019m glad you sat and visited a while. Maybe I\u2019ll see you at the wedding this weekend if I\u2019m not needed for anything else. I should probably get on the road\u2014I have to drive to Eureka.\u201d</p><p>She stood and George did, as well. \u201cEureka? You\u2019re not staying here in Virgin River with your son?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m staying with a friend just down the street from my granddaughter so I\u2019m free to pick her up after preschool. We spend most afternoons together. Really, nice seeing you.\u201d She turned to Luke. \u201cI\u2019m going to head back to Viv\u2019s, Luke. Good night, Shelby. \u2019Night Art. Thanks for dinner, it was great as usual.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWonderful seeing you, too,\u201d George said. \u201cTry to come to Noah\u2019s wedding. I guarantee you\u2019ll enjoy yourself.\u201d</p><p>Luke gestured to Shelby to visit with George while he walked his mother to her car, but he had to move pretty quick to do that. Maureen was shrugging into her jacket as she exited the bar, apparently in a very big hurry to leave.</p><p>\u201cHey, hey, hey,\u201d Luke called after her with laughter in his voice. \u201cMom!\u201d Maureen stopped and turned to him. \u201cWhat was that?\u201d</p><p>She just tilted her head in a questioning way. \u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat! You aren\u2019t recently widowed! You brushed him off. Totally.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh that,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m not interested in dating anyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy, for heaven\u2019s sake? George seems like a very nice guy. And he\u2019s not exactly Stranger Danger\u2014Noah\u2019s known him for years. He was at our wedding. Maybe the two of you would enjoy yourselves.\u201d</p><p>She put a hand on his cheek. \u201cThat\u2019s very sweet, Luke,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m just not interested.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut why? Is there something about George you don\u2019t like?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really,\u201d she said, shaking her head as if disinterested. \u201cI don\u2019t want to go out with a man.\u201d She shivered. \u201cNow, I need to get going. It\u2019s a long drive and I\u2019m cold.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He just stared at her for a second. He leaned toward her and kissed her cheek. \u201cThanks for coming out, Mom. Drive carefully.\u201d</p><p>He watched as she got in her car to drive away from him and he thought, I\u2019d better get to the bottom of that! As far as Luke knew, as far as he could tell, his parents had had a good relationship. They weren\u2019t overtly physical or affectionate in front of their boys but\u2014it was a well-known fact\u2014his mother was way uptight. He assumed, since they had five sons in ten years, they were very physical in private. At his father\u2019s insistence, his mother was always treated with the utmost deference and respect; the man worshiped her. If there was anything she needed, she had only to snap her fingers and he was there for her. She called him her knight, but she called him that softly, quietly.</p><p>What the hell was wrong? If she\u2019d had a positive marriage, shouldn\u2019t she be at least amenable to the idea of dinner with a nice man? And now that he gave it some thought, his mother was a knockout for a woman in her early sixties; she looked at least a decade younger than she was. She had a good figure, a quick wit, excellent health and a positive attitude. Logically, she should have been dating, possibly remarried, years ago.</p> <p>Aiden, Luke thought. Aiden knew women inside and out. Literally. He would figure this out.</p><p>Maureen absolutely remembered George, but it just wouldn\u2019t do to let on that she had noticed him. She\u2019d be mortified if he even suspected that the very moment she met him a month ago she\u2019d found him handsome, charming and amusing. Because she was not, definitely not, interested in ever having a man in her life again. Romance was for young girls, not women her age.</p><p>She was finally where she wanted to be in life. Comfortable in her skin. Confident in her independence. She was busy all the time, felt good and didn\u2019t mind looking at herself in the mirror...provided she was fully clothed. Her sons were, if not completely settled, at least not as frivolous and immature as they\u2019d once been.</p><p>She had wanted grandchildren and now she had one, and a little girl at that. She had always wanted a little girl of her own, but just hadn\u2019t been up to a sixth child. If Shelby and Luke would ever own up, she\u2019d be informed that a second grandchild was on the way. They must be keeping the news tight until they got past the shaky first trimester; lots of couples did that.</p><p>And Vivian had literally come to her rescue so she could be near Rosie without interfering in Sean\u2019s attempts to gather up and secure his family.</p> <p>Viv had turned out to be more than just a port in a storm\u2014she was becoming a good friend. Maureen got a kick out of her, though they didn\u2019t have much in common. While Maureen had kept busy with things like golf and bridge and her church, Vivian had been working full-time, helping out with her daughter and granddaughter and seeing a man. Maureen was so much more old-fashioned than Vivian\u2014she\u2019d never have done such a great job of helping and supporting a daughter who had chosen to be a single mother. But then Maureen was about ten years older and Vivian had herself been a single mother, widowed as a young woman.</p><p>When Maureen got back to Viv\u2019s house, she found her roommate was just tucking Rosie into bed.</p><p>\u201cWell, hello,\u201d Viv said. \u201cI thought you\u2019d be out a bit later. I hope you had a good time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. I didn\u2019t know we were babysitting tonight,\u201d Maureen said. \u201cI\u2019d have stayed home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was last minute. Sean and Franci decided on a nice dinner out and I didn\u2019t have plans, so I said I\u2019d keep Rosie here. If they decide to let her stay the night, she can snuggle in with me. But I\u2019m pretty sure they\u2019ll come for her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGramma Mo-ween, you do me a story?\u201d Rosie asked.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019ve had a story already,\u201d Vivian reminded her granddaughter.</p><p>\u201cBut another won\u2019t hurt,\u201d Maureen said. \u201cJust a short one, then get some sleep. Okay?\u201d</p><p>Fifteen minutes later Maureen was back in Viv\u2019s tidy, comfy little living room. Vivian had a fire going and the TV off; she was curled into the corner of the sofa that had her imprint in it, her book in her lap. \u201cIt\u2019s getting so cold,\u201d Maureen said. \u201cThe fire is nice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow are Shelby and Luke?\u201d</p><p>Maureen smiled. \u201cThey still haven\u2019t unleashed their news. To me, anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSometimes the mothers are the last to know. Sometimes they tell us things we wish they\u2019d keep to themselves.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHm,\u201d Maureen agreed. She picked up a magazine from Viv\u2019s coffee table.</p><p>\u201cTurn on the TV if you like,\u201d Vivian said. \u201cIt won\u2019t bother my reading.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m fine. The quiet is nice,\u201d she said.</p><p>Another ten minutes passed when Vivian put aside her book and said, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, Maureen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh? Nothing! Nothing at all. Why would you think that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not doing your needlepoint. You\u2019re not looking at that magazine, which is a medicine monthly and probably of no interest to you, anyway. And you\u2019re no magpie, but you\u2019re usually lots more talkative than this.\u201d She smiled. \u201cEven when I\u2019m reading.\u201d</p><p>Maureen tossed the magazine back on the coffee table. She smiled and asked, \u201cHave I been rude?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s not an unappreciative bone in your body, rude or otherwise. So, what\u2019s wrong? Are you upset with your boys?\u201d</p><p>Maureen sighed. \u201cNot any more than usual. I did do a rude thing tonight, Viv. I told a lie and I think I got away with it, but it didn\u2019t make me feel any better. I just didn\u2019t like the spot I thought I was in.\u201d</p><p>Vivian sat forward a little bit, crossing her legs under her on the sofa. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine\u2014I thought a lie would turn to acid in your mouth!\u201d She grinned almost happily. \u201cDo tell!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s pretty silly. A gentleman I met while I was here for Luke\u2019s wedding happens to be visiting again and we ran into each other at that little Virgin River bar. I pretended I couldn\u2019t remember meeting him. I don\u2019t know why I did that. Probably because he was coming on a little strong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStrong?\u201d Viv asked. \u201cDid he make a pass?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod, no, I\u2019d have had a coronary! He hadn\u2019t even started flirting, thank goodness. But I could tell he was happy to run into me again and I thought it best to just discourage him right away rather than have to reject him later. Turned out he wasn\u2019t nearly discouraged enough and asked me out to dinner.\u201d</p><p>Viv was silent for a long moment. Her brows drew together and her eyes narrowed suspiciously. \u201cAnd the problem is?\u201d she finally asked.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to go out to dinner with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh,\u201d she said, sitting back on the couch. \u201cHe\u2019s not your type?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVivian,\u201d Maureen said with surprise. \u201cI don\u2019t have a type!\u201d</p><p>Again Viv was silent. \u201cI don\u2019t think I understand, Maureen. We all have pretty basic likes and dislikes. Are you put off by his looks?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not it\u2014he\u2019s actually handsome. Probably a little older than me, but still handsome.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBad manners?\u201d Viv asked. \u201cBad breath? Slippery dentures? What puts you off?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing, he\u2019s nice. Attractive and charming. But I don\u2019t go out to dinner with men.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy ever not?\u201d she asked, completely baffled.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a single woman. A widow of a certain age. An older woman!\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaureen, you must draw the interest of men regularly. You\u2019re a very attractive woman!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, never,\u201d she said. \u201cNot at all. But then, I\u2019m never in places where something like that might happen. I pretty much keep to church things or pastimes with women who live in the condos. Golf, tennis, bridge, the occasional potluck. If I do run into men, they\u2019re with their wives.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut don\u2019t you have friends your age who date? Friends who are divorced or widowed who have men friends or boyfriends?\u201d</p><p>Maureen made a sound of annoyance. \u201cYes, and some of them act downright ridiculous! I\u2019ve seen some of these women I play golf and tennis with, chasing men as if they\u2019re...they\u2019re...\u201d</p><p>\u201cHorny?\u201d Viv asked with a smile.</p><p>Maureen was shocked. \u201cReally, that\u2019s an awful word!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, brother,\u201d Viv said with a laugh. \u201cBe right back.\u201d</p><p>Maureen was left to wonder what Vivian was doing in the kitchen until she returned and handed Maureen a glass of wine. \u201cI\u2019ve already had a glass of wine. Earlier. Before dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have some special medical condition I should know about?\u201d Vivian asked with a raised eyebrow.</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s just that I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwo glasses of wine in one day won\u2019t kill you. In fact, if you decide on a third, I won\u2019t tell a soul. You and I need to have a talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA talk?\u201d Maureen asked.</p><p>Vivian went back to the couch with her own glass and nodded. \u201cSince your mother is no longer available, God rest her soul. You know, when you told me your sons considered you a prude, that you considered yourself a prude, I didn\u2019t take you that seriously. I should have. Maureen,\u201d she said gravely. \u201cIt\u2019s one thing to be strait-laced, but another entirely to stop living!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t say that of me, that I\u2019ve stopped living! I\u2019m very active! True, I\u2019m a little...Well, my son Aiden calls me \u2018starched.\u2019 But I like to think of it as moral fiber.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh. Maybe we should put it all out on the table here, girlfriend. Let\u2019s talk about the difference between moral fiber and uptight fears. Because\u2014\u201d</p><p>Maureen got a little red in the face. \u201cIs it an uptight fear to wish your son would marry the woman before he has a child with her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I wish that, too. Or rather, I wish my daughter had told Sean about Rosie before bolting like she did. I do understand\u2014she was terrified and her heart was breaking. Still...But that\u2019s beside the point. What we wish other people would do has nothing to do with us. That\u2019s not moral fiber, that\u2019s being judgmental and unforgiving.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never been judgmental or unforgiving a day in my life,\u201d Maureen protested.</p><p>\u201cKnow what? I absolutely believe you. You couldn\u2019t embrace my daughter and granddaughter if you were. So, it must be that what you call moral fiber for yourself is closer to heavy starch or moral constipation! Otherwise you\u2019d have dinner with that nice, handsome, charming man and see if you could become friends. And leave it open to the possibility you could become better friends. And even better friends.\u201d</p><p>Maureen shook her head dismally. \u201cYou and I come from such completely different backgrounds, Viv. I was planning to be a nun!\u201d</p><p>Viv\u2019s eyes widened in shock, but very briefly. \u201cWell, you\u2019d have been some kick-ass nun, that\u2019s for sure. I\u2019ve seen you with your boys\u2014they don\u2019t even sass. But something obviously changed your mind about the convent...\u201d</p><p>\u201cPatrick Riordan, Sr., my husband. He hounded me until I gave in and dated him, then married him. And he\u2019s been the only man in my life. The only one. I can\u2019t imagine another man...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou must have loved him very much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, of course I did, but that\u2019s got nothing to do with it. I\u2019m just far too mature to be thinking about a relationship with a man. Those days are gone. It was hard enough for me when I was young and my body was\u2014\u201d She stopped, unable to finish.</p><p>\u201cWhat? Maureen, you\u2019re beautiful! Your figure is amazing! You play sports and your mind is quick and you seem so confident.\u201d</p><p>Maureen snorted. \u201cOf course I\u2019m confident. With my clothes on!\u201d She took a drink of her wine. \u201cPatrick was and will be the only husband of my lifetime.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Vivian laughed softly, respectfully. \u201cMaureen, I wouldn\u2019t even suggest you should marry again. My interfering does have some limits.\u201d She scooted forward on the sofa, closer to her friend. \u201cI guess your dating girlfriends aren\u2019t keeping you in the loop, giving you the inside skinny\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey know I don\u2019t want to hear about their love lives,\u201d she said, a hint of sadness in her voice. \u201cI\u2019m from the old school, Vivian. The one where we don\u2019t talk about personal things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to do that now, Maureen,\u201d she said. \u201cI want to tell you some things about grown-up love. It\u2019s easier, Maureen. And better. There\u2019s more time, more tenderness, more patience. Our bodies aren\u2019t what they were and things don\u2019t always perform on schedule like they did when we were mere kids in our twenties. Sometimes a little help is called for\u2014some-thing to help with the erection, or maybe with the lubrication\u2014but it\u2019s all part of intimacy that can be wonderfully fulfilling. Maureen, no one\u2019s body is what it was forty years ago\u2014but I\u2019m here to tell you, it\u2019s probably in perfect working order.\u201d</p> <p>Maureen seemed to think about this for a moment, and it did bring a flush to her cheeks. \u201cYou must have a very nice gentleman friend,\u201d was all she said.</p><p>\u201cCarl is a lovely man and I\u2019ll save you the trouble of asking, because you won\u2019t be able to work up the courage\u2014we\u2019re intimate. He\u2019s actually a bit younger than I am\u2014I\u2019m fifty-five and he\u2019s fifty. Fifty-year-old men without medical problems are usually still quite virile. For we ladies, the symptoms of menopause hound our sex lives\u2014we get so dry. But that\u2019s completely normal and easily remedied. Carl and I don\u2019t manage a lot of alone time with our work and family obligations, but the nice thing about being this age...there\u2019s no pressure. Simple unhurried affection is so rewarding. And I wonder, do you know what the hottest erogenous area of a man\u2019s body is?\u201d</p><p>Maureen fanned her face with her hand. \u201cI imagine it\u2019s his, you know, penis...\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope,\u201d she said, shaking her head. \u201cJust like with women\u2014it\u2019s the mind. When people like each other, Maureen, the rest follows as naturally for a woman in her fifties and sixties as for a woman in her twenties.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re lucky with Carl.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t wait for you to meet him,\u201d Vivian said. \u201cBut, Maureen, I wasn\u2019t in the market for a man\u2014I had my hands full with Franci and Rosie. Besides, I was working for him during his wife\u2019s final days, God bless her. I was supporting him through his grief along with the rest of the office. It surprised me completely when he asked me out on a date a year or so after his wife died.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you knew him\u2014you must have been comfortable with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen a good man comes along, you owe it to yourself to at least have a look.\u201d</p><p>But Maureen just shook her head. \u201cI have to admit, only to you, this is the only area of life in which I feel completely vulnerable. Thankfully it hardly ever happens. But I wouldn\u2019t know where to begin...\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen let me tell you,\u201d Vivian said. \u201cWhen you go out to dinner, if he has good manners, is pleasant to both you and the waitstaff, is enjoyable company, you\u2019ve begun. That\u2019s all it is. Friendship, companionship, affection\u2014one day at a time. Women our age with our life experience don\u2019t have time for nonsense\u2014we need substance and sincerity. The minute the relationship isn\u2019t one hundred percent positive, we can always find a good book.\u201d She smiled and glanced at Maureen\u2019s needlework on the accent table beside the chair. \u201cOr sewing.\u201d</p><p>Maureen sipped her wine and saw that it was nearly gone. \u201cI think maybe you know what you\u2019re talking about.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m a physician\u2019s assistant. I see patients our age in all manner of menopausal dilemma. Some have come into a sexual rebirth and are wearing their husbands out, others miss their former libido and want help to find it again. Still others wish their husbands would just leave them alone. Because I\u2019m a female PA, they talk to me more often than the male PAs or doctors, and I\u2019ve made a lot of referrals to female gynecologists who can relate to these patients. I\u2019m not speaking from just my own dating experience, which has been relatively slim over the years.\u201d Vivian glanced at Maureen\u2019s glass. \u201cLet me give you just a half glass more since we\u2019re in for the night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood idea,\u201d Maureen said, extending the glass. \u201cBecause I have a few questions. And some of my good friends from way back call me Mo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? You don\u2019t look like a Mo at all. I can\u2019t wait to hear the questions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t we start with, how can a man of any age be attracted to a woman whose naked breasts hang down to her lap? Good God, that\u2019s a reasonable question!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s probably wondering how a woman of any age can overlook that flat butt or potbelly. But do you know what men are most self-conscious about? Their hair! They get all freaked out by thinning hair!\u201d</p><p>By the time Sean and Franci dropped by to pick up their sleeping daughter, Vivian and Maureen were sitting on the floor in front of the fire with steaming cups of hot chocolate, whipped cream piled high on top, laughing like a couple of high-school girls, looking guilty as hell.</p><p>Thirteen</p><p>Sean had been spending every night at Franci\u2019s house and Franci was comfortable with it, having been convinced Rosie wasn\u2019t going to be traumatized by the two of them sleeping in the same bed. In fact, Rosie seemed to like sleeping between the two of them.</p> <p>While Franci and Rosie were at their respective schools, Sean usually spent some time helping Luke out at the cabins, or he ran errands, or he did chores around Franci\u2019s little house. It was his mission to make sure her house was in complete repair before he went back to Beale right after Thanksgiving. If he ended up going remote, Luke would look after her.</p><p>\u201cI managed fine as a single woman,\u201d Franci told him. \u201cI know how to call a repairman if I need one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just as easy to call my brother,\u201d Sean said. \u201cNot only is Luke cheaper, he\u2019d be offended if you didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>On this particular Sunday night Franci had work to do; she had a couple of demanding classes on Monday because it was nearing end of term. So Sean took over bath and bedtime duties with Rosie while Franci sat on her bed with her laptop balanced on her knees, perfecting her lesson plan.</p><p>Once Sean had Rosie in the tub, they sang what Rosie called the soap song: \u201cIf I were a little bar of soap, I\u2019d go slippy slippy slidey over everybody\u2019s hidey...\u201d It had many verses and Sean now knew them all. Then it was off to bed to read Rosie\u2019s favorite book: Everyone Poops. When Rosie was all settled, Sean gave Luke a call.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not interrupting anything, am I?\u201d Sean asked.</p><p>\u201cAre you kidding?\u201d Luke said. \u201cShelby\u2019s already asleep. She feels like shit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgain?\u201d Sean asked. \u201cJeez, what\u2019s the deal?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t guessed? She doesn\u2019t want to tell anyone yet, but she\u2019s pregnant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLuke!\u201d came Shelby\u2019s loud, strident voice out of the background.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just Sean!\u201d Luke yelled back. \u201cI thought you were asleep!\u201d</p><p>Sean chuckled into the phone. \u201cWell, kind of seems like you two don\u2019t have to try real hard to reproduce. You might want to keep an eye on that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo kidding. Don\u2019t tell Mom yet. Shelby wants to get past a couple of months. Even though she hurls every morning and falls asleep by seven every night, she wants to be sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerfectly understandable,\u201d Sean said. \u201cI\u2019ll see you tomorrow after I drop Rosie at preschool.\u201d</p><p>Then he puttered around the house for a while, quietly, not even turning on the TV in the living room because Franci was working. He took out the trash, leafed through the newspaper again, brushed Harry\u2019s hair off the sofa, enjoyed domestic balance and tranquility. He checked on Rosie; she was sound asleep with her little bird mouth open. When he watched her sleep, he always thought, She\u2019s mine! And while a few weeks ago that idea had terrified him, now it filled him with wonder. With awe. She was a miracle he just didn\u2019t deserve.</p><p>He left Franci alone until about nine o\u2019clock, then he dished up a bowl of vanilla ice cream and took it to her. \u201cCan you take a break?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI can be all done,\u201d she said, closing the laptop. \u201cThis for me?\u201d she asked, reaching for the ice cream.</p><p>\u201cYes, ma\u2019am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re working out very well. I like having a good-looking manservant around the house.\u201d</p><p>He got a pained look on his face. \u201cI\u2019m not going to be around the house much longer, baby. But I\u2019ll call every day, and anytime I\u2019m not flying or have more than one day off in a row, I\u2019ll be here.\u201d</p><p>She touched his cheek. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about us, Sean. We\u2019ll be okay. I think of this as temporary. Once you know what the air force has in store for you next, we\u2019ll come up with some more permanent plans.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs permanent as possible, given the fact Uncle Sam owns me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t grouse. It\u2019s a good life. And I\u2019m proud of you. You have general plastered all over your personnel file, Sean. You can go all the way, and you should.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to make sure I say a few things before I have to go back to Beale. I\u2019ve done everything I can do for now, Fran. Got the college trust set up, made a new will, have a new life-insurance policy, worked my charm on the boys at the Military Personnel Center in assignments.\u201d He took a deep breath. \u201cI have to say something to Rosie about not being around all the time. Think she\u2019ll understand if I say I have to work?\u201d</p><p>Franci smiled and nodded. \u201cShe understands that I work, that grandma works. She knows you\u2019ve been on \u2018bacation.\u2019\u201d Her eyes glistened. \u201cShe\u2019s going to miss you a lot. So will I.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think Jake will work with me on time off, especially since I\u2019m short.\u201d That was the term for someone who could be reassigned without warning. The short guy doesn\u2019t get any long-term or real important projects; he might not get to finish them. \u201cFranci, it\u2019s likely I\u2019m going to go away for a while. You know how hard it is to stay in touch. Think she\u2019ll be able to understand something like that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can help her get through it,\u201d she said. \u201cYou know, you being in the air force was never a problem for me, right?\u201d she asked. \u201cI liked the military\u2014I loved my job. I just didn\u2019t want to do that kind of job with a family, and family got real important to me.\u201d She shrugged. \u201cAll of a sudden.\u201d</p><p>He laughed and rubbed her knee. \u201cYeah, I got excited, forgot the rubber and family got real important to you. Listen, I was going to rehearse this and say it right, but here\u2019s the thing. I\u2019m ashamed of the kind of guy I was, Franci. Cards on the table\u2014I was a selfish, egotistical asshole who expected you to stay with me forever, but I wasn\u2019t willing to make it worth your while. I thought I was a man of the world, but I was a stupid kid. I was mad as hell I didn\u2019t know you were pregnant, but it scares me to death to think how I might\u2019ve reacted if I had known. Franci, the truth is, I probably would have asked you to end the pregnancy, and when I think about what that would have cost us, it almost brings me to my knees. My world is so huge right now\u2014when a Wide Iwish Rose puts her arms around my neck and calls me a silly daddy, my heart almost doesn\u2019t fit in my chest. That Rosie\u2014she isn\u2019t just an idea. She\u2019s more than I could have imagined if my imagination had gone into overdrive.\u201d</p><p>Franci was quiet for a moment. Then she put a spoonful of ice cream to his lips. \u201cI know,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019ve turned yourself into a wonderful silly daddy.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He swallowed the ice cream. \u201cI need you to forgive me for the man I was...If you can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI forgave you when I saw you with our daughter. It\u2019s all different now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know I suggested marriage before, but you were on to me. I was just trying to check off the items on my to-do list. It isn\u2019t like that now. I want to marry you because you\u2019re the most important thing in my life. You\u2019re the beat of my heart, Franci\u2014the mother of my child, my best friend and my future. I love you more than anything. I love Rosie as much. I\u2019d lay down my life for either one of you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSean...\u201d she said in a whisper, tears coming to her eyes.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry I had my head up my ass when we were together before\u2014if I could do that whole time over, I\u2019d prove to you that I\u2019m not completely brainless. I love you, baby. You and Rose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d she whispered. \u201cWe love you, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you marry me?\u201d he asked. He grinned. \u201cBite the dust with me? Spend our lives as husband and wife?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will, of course. You\u2019re obviously useless on your own.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe can plan a wedding or do it quick or wait to decide when I get orders\u2014it\u2019s up to you. Anything you want. But let\u2019s get a license right away so we\u2019re ready, because I need the official contract. I want to be your legal partner as well as your lover and best friend. And let\u2019s get you a ring. Will you consider taking my name, baby? And let me give it to Rosie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh,\u201d she said, a fat tear rolling down her cheek.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just details, honey\u2014but the important part is right this minute, when we make the decision that we\u2019re a family now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re a family now,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cWhew,\u201d he said. \u201cI thought you\u2019d probably say yes, but there was a little worry in the back of my mind that maybe I had more to prove. Thank you.\u201d He leaned toward her and covered her lips with his. \u201cThank you,\u201d he said again. \u201cI love you so much. So let\u2019s get the license and ring this week\u2014what do you think?\u201d</p><p>She put her bowl on the bedside table. \u201cI think my ice cream is soup, so you should close the door and take my clothes off. What do you think?\u201d</p> <p>He grinned hugely. \u201cI think I\u2019m going to love being married to you.\u201d</p><p>Ellie Baldwin asked Jo Fitch, her landlady and friend, to be her matron of honor, and Jo said, \u201cI\u2019m thrilled to be asked, but I\u2019d rather be the mother of the bride. Ask Vanessa or Brie and let me do some special mother-of-the-bride things for your important day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike what?\u201d Ellie asked.</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019d like to get some of your friends and mine together to put some flowers in the church, dress up myself and the kids, maybe decorate the bar for the reception...\u201d</p><p>\u201cJo, I don\u2019t want you to go to a lot of trouble and expense,\u201d Elly said. \u201cYou\u2019ve already done so much for me. You saved my life and got me my kids back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut see, that\u2019s why! That\u2019s what a mother does! And you\u2019re like a daughter to me.\u201d She grabbed her hands. \u201cLet me.\u201d</p><p>So Ellie said, \u201cSure, fine, just don\u2019t go crazy.\u201d</p><p>And Jo said, \u201cYou are the bride\u2014you stay out of my business and I\u2019ll make it nice without going crazy. Just let me\u2014it\u2019s my one and only chance.\u201d</p> <p>On Friday afternoon Vanessa dressed Ellie in a cream-colored cocktail dress with a swoop neck for the big day. Vanni wore the pale green chiffon that she\u2019d married Paul in. They dressed at Jo\u2019s house; ordinarily Ellie walked to the church every day, but this day she and Vanni would drive down to keep their dresses and hairdos fresh and their shoes clean. Ellie followed instructions and went in the side door leading to the church basement, waiting until they were called upstairs, to the sanctuary foyer, when it was time. That was when she first saw what her kids were wearing.</p><p>Jo Ellen had shopped for special dress clothes for Danielle and Trevor to wear; Jo insisted they weren\u2019t expensive, but they cost more and were more beautiful than anything Ellie had ever purchased for them. In their lives! Danielle was beaming in her ruffles and Trevor stood proud in his very first suit. \u201cWhere will they wear them after the wedding?\u201d the ever-practical Ellie asked Jo.</p><p>\u201cThey can wear them to church as often as they want until they grow out of them,\u201d Jo answered. And then Jo handed Ellie and Vanni beautiful bouquets, a surprise to Ellie.</p><p>\u201cOh, Jo!\u201d Ellie gasped. Tears came to her eyes; she had checked the cost of flowers and asked Jo to just get her a long-stemmed rose. \u201cOh, how beautiful!\u201d In her hands she held a bouquet made of pale yellow roses, lacy ferns, baby\u2019s breath and white chrysanthemums.</p><p>\u201cI knew you\u2019d approve, once you saw the flowers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you weren\u2019t supposed to do too much!\u201d</p><p>Jo shook her head. \u201cI didn\u2019t do too much. I did everything just right.\u201d She smiled warmly. \u201cThis is a happy day. No tears.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey go with the flowers in the church, Mama!\u201d Danielle said.</p><p>\u201cThe flowers in the church?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s beautiful,\u201d Vanni said. \u201cWait till you see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome of your friends helped us,\u201d Jo said. \u201cBrie, Shelby, Muriel...\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, too!\u201d Danielle said. \u201cI helped a lot!\u201d</p><p>Vanni smoothed Ellie\u2019s blush with a soft finger. \u201cNervous?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cAbout marrying Noah? Oh, shoot, I won the lottery! About the kids wrecking those fancy clothes? You bet!\u201d</p><p>Jo Ellen looked absolutely stunning in a blue chiffon dress, and she was beaming\u2014so proud of the kids, so proud of her new family. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever seen a more beautiful bride,\u201d she said to Ellie. \u201cNick, are you ready? Because I think it\u2019s time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go upstairs, everyone,\u201d he said, presenting his arm to Ellie.</p><p>Once they were upstairs standing behind the closed double doors to the sanctuary, Jo said to the kids, \u201cIt\u2019s time for us to take our seats. Then right after that Vanni will go down the aisle and then Nick and your mom will follow her. Ready to go inside?\u201d</p><p>And with that, Jo and the kids slipped through the doors and into the church.</p><p>Vanni leaned toward Ellie and kissed her cheek. \u201cHave a wonderful day, sweetheart. And many happy years of married life. This couldn\u2019t be happening to two nicer people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, Vanni. I\u2019ve never had a friend like you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have lots of friends here, Ellie. This town? We\u2019re quick to notice when people are kind and generous and loving. It was our lucky day when you came to live with us.\u201d At exactly that moment the tempo of the recorded music picked up a bit and Nick reached for Ellie\u2019s hand, tucking it in the crook of his arm. \u201cI\u2019ll see you up front,\u201d Vanni said, as the double doors were opened and she began her walk down the aisle.</p><p>Ellie looked at Nick. \u201cThis was supposed to be just a little thing. I didn\u2019t expect to do the whole walking down the aisle bit. We never even practiced.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think it\u2019ll come natural,\u201d Nick said with a laugh.</p><p>\u201cThe best part is, I\u2019m not attempting to play the piano for this gig,\u201d Ellie said. And at that point the sanctuary doors were opened again by handsomely suited-up Jack and Preacher. Ellie stood there, getting her first look into the church. She gasped and clutched Nick\u2019s arm tighter. Not only was the church full of people, far more than they had for Sunday services, but it was filled with flowers and candles. November\u2019s early dusk had darkened the church, but candlelight glittered everywhere. \u201cWho did this?\u201d she whispered in shock.</p><p>\u201cMe and Jo Ellen, the kids, your husband to be, your friends,\u201d Nick said proudly.</p><p>She glanced to the right and in the very back pew sat some of the boys from the vagrants\u2019 camp, men Noah not only visited regularly but also brought to church. She smiled and felt a huff of laughter escape as she noted they weren\u2019t one bit cleaner or dressed up than usual, but she was so touched to see them there. And in addition to the Sunday regulars, she saw people she knew from town, people who didn\u2019t come to Sunday services\u2014Dr. Cameron Michaels, his wife and twin babies; Luke Riordan\u2019s brother Sean with his girlfriend, his daughter and mother; some neighbors she\u2019d met at Jack\u2019s Bar; a young man named Rick and his fianc\u00e9e, Liz; and Dan Brady with a woman she\u2019d never seen before. Hope McCrea was there\u2014that old crone had previously owned the church but had never before officially set foot in it. And right up in front was Dr. Nate Jensen, who had saved Noah\u2019s adopted dog\u2019s life, and his fianc\u00e9e, Annie.</p><p>\u201cWow,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cEllie, don\u2019t stare,\u201d Nick said. \u201cJust smile at Noah. He\u2019s waiting for you. He looks like he\u2019s been waiting forever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, he hasn\u2019t,\u201d she whispered through gathering tears.</p><p>The flowers and candles in the church had been a big surprise for Ellie, but the number of people at the wedding, and at Jack\u2019s afterward, had surprised Noah, as well. It felt as if half the town was there and, unlike typical weddings, there were people Noah and Ellie had never met before. These people brought gifts and potluck dishes, and they offered congratulations and partied as if they\u2019d known Ellie and Noah forever. The happy couple hadn\u2019t expected the large number of guests, nor the many, many wedding gifts. What Noah realized was that he might not be everyone\u2019s pastor\u2014they had individual preferences of faith and denomination\u2014but they were everyone\u2019s neighbors. That realization brought a satisfaction that was indescribable.</p><p>The bar was decorated with colorful streamers, flowers from the church, napkins embossed with Ellie\u2019s and Noah\u2019s names and the date. The centerpiece of the event was Preacher\u2019s cake\u2014a two-tiered white masterpiece that he beamed over. \u201cI\u2019m going to start doing more of this,\u201d he said proudly. \u201cI think I have a knack.\u201d</p><p>It was only a casual gathering with covered dishes and well wishes, but Preacher had rigged up his speakers from his house stereo and there was some dancing, even though there was hardly room to move. There was no garter to throw and Ellie wouldn\u2019t part with her bouquet but no one seemed to mind.</p><p>Typical of Virgin River parties, people began to leave early. Those who had a drive ahead were the first to depart, followed by the farmers, ranchers and vintners, who didn\u2019t get days off. Sean Riordan left early, taking his family back to Eureka. Noah smiled to see his friend George bow over Maureen Riordan\u2019s hand as he said goodbye, brushing his lips against it like a courtier. Nick and Jo took Ellie\u2019s kids home to bed, but a hard-core group remained at the bar\u2014the diehards who were willing to endure a lack of sleep for a good party. As the evening grew late, the men were found on the porch with brandy and cigars, Jack\u2019s space heaters lit to warm them against the chill November night. The women sat by the fire indoors and laughed together. And, finally, around eleven, everyone wended their way home.</p><p>And at three in the morning in the little apartment above the Fitches\u2019 garage\u2014tonight, the honeymoon suite\u2014no sleep had taken place at all. Noah rolled onto his back and groaned, \u201cOh my God, I love you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a maniac,\u201d Ellie said. \u201cI\u2019ve never met a man who liked sex so much.\u201d</p><p>Noah laughed. \u201cThat\u2019s nice, Ellie. I\u2019ll take comfort in that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally,\u201d she insisted. \u201cHave you finally had enough?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor now,\u201d he said. His eyes were closed, but there was a smile on his lips.</p><p>She rolled over on her belly, propped up on an elbow and looked into his beautiful eyes. \u201cSo, is married sex better than sneaky sex?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He ran his fingers through the hair at her temples. \u201cYeah. For me, it is.\u201d Then he pulled her head down and kissed her deeply, his heart completely hers. He couldn\u2019t remember ever being more content.</p><p>\u201cIt is for me, too,\u201d she whispered. \u201cCan we sleep now?\u201d</p><p>He pulled her against him, her head resting on his arm, and holding her tight they drifted off to sleep. But not for long. Ellie was up, showered and pulling on jeans and a sweatshirt first thing in the morning. The smell of fresh coffee filled the small room and she jostled Noah awake. \u201cCome on, don\u2019t be a bum\u2014I promised the kids we\u2019d start poking around the new house as soon as everyone woke up.\u201d</p> <p>He rolled over with a loud moan and put the back of his hand over his eyes. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter with you?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so excited.\u201d She laughed. \u201cThat house has been ours for a whole week and we haven\u2019t had time to do anything to it yet! You said we\u2019d get down there right away, as soon as we got married.\u201d</p><p>He moaned again and rolled over. \u201cMy right away and your right away are at least a couple of hours apart...Aren\u2019t you in the afterglow from a wedding night of magnificence?\u201d</p><p>She giggled. \u201cNot anymore. Come on, Noah. Don\u2019t be lazy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLazy, she says,\u201d he muttered, dragging himself out of bed. \u201cThere should be a warning attached to marrying an energetic younger woman...\u201d</p> <p>They went downstairs to Jo and Nick\u2019s kitchen; the kids were just rising, so they were talked into more coffee and breakfast. By the time everyone was moving at a normal pace, Ellie was jittery with anticipation. She loaded a few things in the back of Noah\u2019s truck\u2014broom, mop, rags, detergent, scrub brushes, trash bags. Jo promised she and Nick would follow behind with the kids. So, on their first official day of married life, Ellie and Noah took off down the road to their new old house.</p><p>Ellie and Noah could hear the sound of heavy equipment well before they could see it, but neither said a word because they couldn\u2019t imagine that it would have anything to do with them. The next thing they noticed was that the road to their house was difficult to navigate because it was lined with parked cars and trucks.</p><p>\u201cWhat in the world...?\u201d Ellie said. Noah edged his old truck closer, and the moment they broke through the trees they were both momentarily stunned. Their property was a beehive of activity. Someone was driving a large farm-size mower around the property. There were men on ladders propped up against the house; more men pounded hammers on the roof, and at ground level people were raking up the cuttings, hauling trash, scraping off old paint, replacing boards and sanding porch rails.</p><p>George was standing on the porch wearing a carpenter\u2019s apron, looking very much at home. Noah walked up the porch steps. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLooks like your friends have decided to give you a hand to get you started. Don\u2019t worry, Noah\u2014there\u2019s going to be plenty of work for you to do.\u201d Then he grinned.</p><p>Paul Haggerty walked up behind Noah and Ellie, balancing a dozen or so long baseboards over one shoulder. \u201cMorning, Noah, Ellie,\u201d he said as he passed.</p> <p>Inside the house they found Muriel up on a ladder, using a liquid chemical mixture to slowly remove years of white paint from a solid oak archway that separated the living room from the dining room. She had about two feet of the arch\u2019s natural wood exposed. Walt was at work doing the same thing on the banister. \u201cHi, Ellie,\u201d Muriel called from her place on the ladder. \u201cI had to take paint off the most beautiful wood at my old house and, let me tell you, it looks awesome when it\u2019s done! You\u2019re going to love this when it\u2019s stained and varnished. It won\u2019t be quick, but it\u2019s worth it. And there\u2019s nothing we can do about the beveled stairs. Each step will have to be replaced from the wear, but it\u2019s not a hard job. I can do it.\u201d</p><p>Ellie\u2019s mouth fell open. This was the woman who had been in movies and nominated for Oscars, and was most commonly seen on TV in strapless evening gowns and glittering jewels. And she was talking about replacing the wood on her steps for her? It was unreal.</p><p>Luke Riordan came out of the kitchen with his arms full of crinkling, old, rotting wallpaper he\u2019d torn off. He dumped it in the empty dining room. \u201cMorning,\u201d he said. \u201cArt,\u201d he yelled back into the kitchen. \u201cCan you get this pile of trash in the back of my truck? I\u2019ll run by the dump on the way home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow,\u201d Ellie said. \u201cWhose idea was this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Walt said. \u201cPaul, whose idea was this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot sure. Jack\u2019s maybe?\u201d</p><p>Preacher walked out of the kitchen. \u201cMine,\u201d he said indignantly. \u201cI think it was my idea. We pitch in around here when it\u2019s practical. We need to get you up and running before it gets any colder. Gotta replace all the window glass that\u2019s cracked or broken, and the fireplaces need to be cleaned. You\u2019re gonna need a new furnace I think\u2014you\u2019re on your own there. I don\u2019t know anyone who does that, but I did get a friend from Clear River who said he\u2019d come out this afternoon and get fifty years of soot out of those chimneys in the living and dining rooms. He\u2019s gonna do it as a donation, just to help out. He\u2019s probably got something he\u2019s gonna ask you for, Noah. Like a wedding or funeral or baptism or something\u2014as a rule he\u2019s usually not that generous.\u201d</p><p>Noah just laughed. \u201cHope he\u2019s not planning a funeral. That doesn\u2019t sound good.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cEllie, you should get some measurements,\u201d Muriel said. \u201cSee what size appliances will work in that kitchen and maybe measure the windows for blinds and the floors for area rugs. It\u2019s not going to take much to get this place habitable. But to get it pretty? That\u2019s going to be a six-month project. But I can help. I love doing this stuff.\u201d</p><p>Ellie walked toward Muriel\u2019s ladder and looked up at her. Muriel wore work coveralls, boots, a ratty long-sleeved sweatshirt, gloves and a ball cap. \u201cMuriel,\u201d she said in awe. \u201cYou\u2019re a movie star.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s also a crackerjack carpenter, painter and renovator. You should see what she did to her place, almost entirely alone,\u201d Walt said.</p><p>\u201cYou were a wonderful help, Walt,\u201d Muriel said. \u201cOf course, you had ulterior motives, but that wasn\u2019t a problem for me. Come see my restored house sometime, Ellie. I love showing it off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVanni wanted to be here to help, but she\u2019s tied up with the kids, and they\u2019d just be in the way,\u201d Walt said. \u201cMost of these guys have to work all week, but a few of us have time on our hands and will get back here after the weekend. Me. Muriel. George.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomeone call me?\u201d George asked, sticking his head in the door.</p><p>\u201cNo, George. Get back to work,\u201d Walt said.</p><p>Ellie turned around and leaned her face into Noah\u2019s chest. He put his arms around her and felt her shoulders shake, heard her sniff. He leaned down and kissed her cheek. \u201cDon\u2019t cry,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>She lifted her head. \u201cThey\u2019re so wonderful. How can they be this wonderful?\u201d</p><p>He smiled. \u201cI think they practice.\u201d</p><p>Fourteen</p><p>Maureen Riordan heard from her son Luke about the rally of neighbors who surprised the Kincaids with a work party over the weekend. She was completely charmed by the notion. It sounded like the way things had been in her parents\u2019 day\u2014barn raisings and such. So on Monday morning she drove out to Virgin River. She had a cup of coffee with Luke, then, following his directions, she made her way out to the old house to see what progress had been made.</p><p>There was only one beat-up old truck outside the house. Then she heard the sound of a saw inside. For a moment she thought maybe it wasn\u2019t such a great idea to poke around. Obviously a man was working the saw and she was a woman alone. But in a place where the community had pulled together to help one of their own, could there be danger? It must be just another good neighbor inside the house. The door stood open, even though it was cold outside.</p><p>Right inside the front door in what must be the living room, who should be standing at a circular saw cutting planks but George Davenport. She let out a breath. Well, avoiding him wasn\u2019t going to work. She\u2019d tried to give him a wide berth at the wedding party on Friday night, but he\u2019d singled her out, complimented her, made small talk and even kissed the back of her hand! There seemed to be only two options to deal with the man. Face him head-on or leave town.</p><p>And there he stood, his white hair, which was not terribly thick, askew and spiking, wearing jeans and a sweatshirt, covered with sawdust. His face was tan\u2014but hadn\u2019t he said he\u2019d come from Seattle? Cloudy, dreary Seattle? Despite herself, she noticed his shoulders were broad, his butt was solid and his legs were long. What was a man his age doing with broad shoulders and a solid butt? She wondered what he\u2019d look like without a shirt and was immediately appalled that she would even think that!</p><p>The thought must have caused her to make a noise because he turned toward her. The smile that split his handsome face was bright. No slippery dentures there; his teeth were white and strong. He must have been good about brushing and flossing all through the years, probably the only thing they had in common.</p><p>\u201cMrs. Riordan,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat brings you here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCuriosity,\u201d she said. \u201cMy son Luke told me about all the activity here over the weekend and I thought it was such a wonderful thing that I just wanted to see it for myself.\u201d She entered the house farther. \u201cWhat is it you\u2019re doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m cutting the boards for the new stairs. Noah will be along when he can clear some of his morning appointments. We\u2019ll install the stairs and, later today and tomorrow, Muriel will help with the sanding, staining and varnishing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMuriel?\u201d Maureen asked.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve met Muriel St. Claire, haven\u2019t you? She\u2019s an ace woodworker and she completely restored an old farmhouse on the outskirts of town. She moved in right next to Walt Booth\u2019s place, which is how they met. They\u2019ve been a hot item for the past year.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHot item?\u201d she said. \u201cFor a year?\u201d She frowned. \u201cI guess I thought they\u2019d been a couple for a long time.\u201d Even though many of her female acquaintances found romance later in life, Maureen never really got used to the idea. Viv told her it was high time she dispelled the notion that romance was strictly for the very young. Still, when she thought about couples the age of Muriel and Walt getting together, she couldn\u2019t help but think of it as more practical than passionate.</p><p>\u201cFairly recent, as I understand it,\u201d George went on. \u201cWalt was widowed several years ago. And while Muriel has never taken me into her confidence, the movie rags say she\u2019s been married and divorced a number of times.\u201d He grinned. \u201cShe must think the day she ran into Walt Booth\u2014stable old war dog that he is\u2014was one of the luckiest days of her life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGeorge, I probably owe you an apology,\u201d Maureen said. \u201cI don\u2019t think I was as friendly as I could have been when we ran into each other at Jack\u2019s a week or so ago. The fact is, I do remember meeting you at Luke\u2019s wedding. I don\u2019t know why I was acting as if I couldn\u2019t remember you. It isn\u2019t like me to play coy like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI knew that, Mrs. Riordan,\u201d he said.</p><p>She was stunned. \u201cYou knew?\u201d</p><p>He smiled gently. Kindly. \u201cI saw it in your eyes,\u201d he explained, then shifted his own back and forth, breaking eye contact, demonstrating what he saw. \u201cAnd the moment I met you I knew you were more straightforward than that. I\u2019m sorry if I made you uncomfortable.\u201d</p><p>She was a little uncomfortable now, in fact. She felt vulnerable, being found out before she even had a chance to confess. \u201cAnd I was widowed quite a while ago.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYes, I know that, too. Twelve years or so?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She put her hands on her hips. \u201cAnd you know this how?\u201d she asked, not trying too hard to keep the indignant tone from her voice.</p><p>\u201cWell, I asked,\u201d he said with a shrug. \u201cThat\u2019s what a man does when he has an interest in a woman. He asks about her.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIs that so? Well, what else did you find out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing embarrassing, I swear. Just that you\u2019ve been widowed quite a while now, all five sons are in the military, you live in Phoenix and, as far as anyone knows, you\u2019re not currently seeing anyone special.\u201d</p><p>Special? she thought. Not seeing anyone period with absolutely no intention of doing so. \u201cInteresting,\u201d she said. \u201cWell, I don\u2019t know a thing about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course you do. I\u2019m a friend of Noah\u2019s. A teacher.\u201d He chuckled. \u201cAnd obviously I have time on my hands.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not very much information,\u201d she said.</p> <p>He took a rag out of his back pocket and wiped some of the sawdust and sweat off his brow. \u201cYou\u2019re welcome to ask me anything you like. I\u2019m an open book.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long have you been a teacher?\u201d she asked, starting with a safe subject.</p><p>\u201cTwenty years now, and I\u2019m thinking of making some changes. I\u2019m seventy and I always thought retirement would turn me into an old fuddy-duddy, but I\u2019m rethinking that. I\u2019d like to have more time to do the things I enjoy most and, fortunately, I have a small pension and some savings. Besides, I\u2019m tired of keeping a rigid schedule.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou would retire?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgain.\u201d He laughed. \u201cI retired the first time at the age of fifty and, after twenty years at the university, I could retire again. There are so many young professors who\u2019d love to see a tenured old goat like me leave an opening for them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd before you were a teacher?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cA Presbyterian minister,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cOh! You\u2019re joking!\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid it\u2019s the truth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Catholic!\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cHow nice for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re making fun of me,\u201d she accused.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m making fun of your shock,\u201d he said. \u201cDon\u2019t you have any non-Catholic friends?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. Many. But\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBecause I have quite a few Catholic friends. And Jewish and Mormon and other faiths. I used to play golf with a priest friend every Thursday afternoon for years. I had to quit. He was a cheat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was not!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right, he wasn\u2019t. I just threw that in there to see if I could rile you up. No one riles quite as beautifully as a redhead. Actually, he was transferred to a new parish. I hear from him once in a while. We used to have the best time with those minister-rabbi-priest jokes. We were in search of a golfing rabbi for a long time. We never did find one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t take things very seriously, do you?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cNot as much now as I did when I was younger. I\u2019m proud of that, by the way. So, what do you say we pick a night for dinner?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you ever been married?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cYou asked that before. Twice,\u201d he said. \u201cDoes that disqualify me as a dinner companion?\u201d</p><p>Truthfully, she\u2019d been too rattled to pay attention to his answer. \u201cAre you a widower?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. My second wife died of cancer a few years ago. You\u2019d have liked her\u2014she was such a lovely, funny woman. My first wife is alive and well. She left me over thirty-five years ago. You wouldn\u2019t have liked her at all. Hardly anyone did. Does.\u201d He frowned and shook his head. \u201cReally, she was one of the most difficult women I\u2019ve ever known. Beautiful, however. Very beautiful. But very...Oh, never mind. I thought I was long past complaining about her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDivorced?\u201d she said. \u201cA divorced minister?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d be amazed at how many real-life issues priests, ministers and rabbis deal with in their own lives. Now...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know, you\u2019re a peculiar man,\u201d she said. \u201cWhy would you want to have dinner with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought it was obvious,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re a striking woman with a strong and entertaining personality. In fact, you\u2019re even more entertaining today. What a lot of funny questions and concerns you seem to have. Does the Catholic church have some sort of punishment for parishioners who date out of the faith?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be glib,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m old school. When I was growing up, one didn\u2019t even contemplate a date outside the faith. Of course, attending an all girls\u2019 Catholic school pretty much ensured that. Besides, I wasn\u2019t an ordinary Catholic. I was, for a short time, a novitiate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, now.\u201d He grinned.</p><p>\u201cWell, now, what?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cVery devout, are you? Then it turns out we have more in common than we have at odds.\u201d He grinned. \u201cI, for one, am glad that didn\u2019t work out, but it certainly explains how you can seem so sophisticated on one hand and so old-fashioned on the other. Want to think about that invitation a while longer?\u201d</p><p>She sighed deeply. \u201cI like to spend whatever afternoons and evenings I can with my newly found granddaughter. Obviously I can\u2019t spend every evening with her. That gets in the way of my son having quality time with Rosie and her mother. But\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh. But you like to keep evenings open for her. Understandable. How about a nice, leisurely lunch? How does that sound?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLunch shouldn\u2019t be out of the question,\u201d she said, surprising herself.</p><p>\u201cBravo! Tomorrow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about your work on this house?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI imagine I\u2019ll be spending plenty of time on this old house,\u201d George said. \u201cI\u2019m planning to stay through Thanksgiving. And, besides, a man has to be well-rounded. All work and no play is no good, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re very persistent, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely,\u201d he agreed. \u201cNow, may I at least call you Maureen? Or do I have to continue with this Mrs. Riordan business forever? It makes it seem like I\u2019m trying to get a date with a married woman!\u201d</p><p>She laughed in spite of herself. \u201cMy sons are going to be flabbergasted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou might as well know the truth. I haven\u2019t been out with a man since my husband died. And, in fact, I hadn\u2019t been out with many before I met him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomehow that doesn\u2019t surprise me at all, Maureen. I haven\u2019t run into a woman as difficult to get a date with as you. We\u2019re going to have a good time, you and me.\u201d And then he smiled at her.</p><p>Maureen had no idea how many people George Davenport told that they were having lunch together, but she saw no need to mention it to anyone. She told herself she wasn\u2019t keeping a secret, just not making an issue. The real truth was that she couldn\u2019t bear to answer any questions\u2014before or after the lunch. She was nervous, excited, a little frightened, afraid of disappointment...and even more afraid of not being disappointed. All morning while she tidied up Vivian\u2019s small house and got ready for George to pick her up, her stomach was in flutters and she went over possible scenarios in her mind. What if he came on too strong? Or made a pass? Or tried to kiss her? Or worse\u2014what if it turned out he was a terrible bore and she never wanted to see him again, for lunch or anything else?</p><p>All those flutters and possibilities were gone minutes after he picked her up. \u201cHave you been to Ferndale, Maureen?\u201d he asked her.</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t been much of anywhere around here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood!\u201d George boomed. \u201cActually, I didn\u2019t mean it was good you haven\u2019t seen the sights, just good that I get to show you some of them. It\u2019s a beautiful little town. The restored and renovated Victorian houses and buildings are wonderful. There are plenty of shops, and just outside of town there\u2019s an amazing cemetery built straight up a hill. It\u2019s old and interesting. One of the big old churches in town has been remodeled into a large bed-and-breakfast. I thought we\u2019d walk the town and poke into the shops. I put a picnic basket and cooler in the trunk\u2014if the weather holds and the sun stays out, we can sit at the top of the hill, above the river, and have crackers, wine, cheese and fruit. There\u2019s a blanket in the back. It\u2019ll be brisk, but not too cold.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat sounds so nice,\u201d she said. Perfect, she thought\u2014not too fancy.</p><p>\u201cWill that hold you? Not much of a lunch, but I\u2019ll take you to get dessert afterward if you like. There\u2019s a wonderful old Victorian hotel with a restaurant in town.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you\u2019ve given this a lot of thought,\u201d she said. \u201cDo you date a lot?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose you could say I do,\u201d he answered. \u201cThere are women I\u2019m friendly with and we share certain interests. There\u2019s a neighbor woman I\u2019ve known for years who is a food critic for the newspaper, and sometimes she invites me along to restaurants she\u2019s reviewing\u2014what an opportunity! She doesn\u2019t listen to a word I say about the food, but I love the whole experience. I have a colleague I can invite to those college parties I\u2019m forced to attend\u2014she\u2019s single and doesn\u2019t usually have a date, either. Mainly I have a number of friends who happen to be women, and if I\u2019m looking for something to do, I might give one of them a call.\u201d He turned and looked toward her. \u201cMaureen, I don\u2019t have anything romantic going on with anyone. Ridiculous as it might be to think a man my age could be a playboy, I promise you, I am not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean\u2014\u201d</p><p>He grinned and grabbed her hand. \u201cOf course you did, and not only am I encouraged, I\u2019m flattered!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, don\u2019t be,\u201d she said. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean that.\u201d</p><p>And then he laughed at her.</p><p>George drove toward Ferndale, but went past the exit and took a back road that wound up a hill. He pulled off the road across from a corral that held four nice-looking horses. \u201cThe first time I passed by this spot, what came to mind was that it was a perfect picnic site. I know it\u2019s a little brisk for a picnic. Will you be comfortable? I have an extra jacket in the backseat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think it\u2019s a great idea,\u201d she said. \u201cI love being outside.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood, come with me. You take the basket and blanket and I\u2019ll take the cooler. Let\u2019s go up this path a little bit, just until we can get a view.\u201d</p><p>Maureen followed him for a while, then when he stopped she turned around and sighed. The hill sloped down sharply and the river and valley spread out beneath them. \u201cThat\u2019s beautiful,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t it?\u201d he agreed. He put down the cooler, spread the blanket, got down on his knees and began to unpack the things he\u2019d brought along. He had an aged Gouda, some soft Brie, cheddar and Muenster. He put out two small boxes of crackers and, using the cooler lid as a table, spread out grapes, apples, some sliced kiwi from a Baggie and a small plastic container of melon balls.</p><p>\u201cGeorge, you went to some trouble,\u201d she said. \u201cYou very nearly cooked!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not a bad cook, either. Will you have a glass of merlot? Or a soda or a bottled water?\u201d</p><p>She chose the wine and toasted him. \u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re persistent,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is wonderful.\u201d</p><p>During the course of their leisurely picnic, they learned about each other. How it was he had never had children. \u201cI wanted them, but my first wife and I didn\u2019t have children, and my second wife had a couple from a first marriage and, given her age, wasn\u2019t keen on more. My first wife remarried and had a son, so I suspect it was my physiological problem that prevented pregnancy. God has always saved my butt in the clinches. It was a terrible relationship.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>George wanted to know what it was like raising five sons. \u201cLike war,\u201d she answered. \u201cMy husband was a good father, but he worked long hours and plenty of overtime. I learned early that I\u2019d better make sure they understood my word was law, or I was doomed. I know they called me the Enforcer behind my back. God knows what they call me now!\u201d</p><p>They talked about their friends, their hobbies, their favorite foods and books, trips they\u2019d like to take, their homes and what they liked about them. They talked about their community service\u2014he liked the soup kitchen and food drives, she moderated a grief group at church and was drafted for every fundraiser they had. Eventually they talked about their spouses and their deaths. Maureen\u2019s husband had developed congestive heart failure and, although he was being treated, he didn\u2019t live long after the diagnosis. \u201cI guess he tried to ignore his symptoms too long and, though I hounded him, he wouldn\u2019t see the doctor. Men don\u2019t, you know. And good wives don\u2019t want to aggravate them by nagging. If I had to do it over, I\u2019d have had him abducted and taken off to the doctor for a full exam.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo doubt,\u201d George said. \u201cI know what you mean.\u201d</p> <p>She asked about his wife. \u201cWell, a similar situation. Her doctor harped about a colonoscopy to be safe, to make sure there was nothing wrong. Something a person should really have done around the age of fifty. But Mary was obstinate\u2014it sounded dreadful to her and she put it off. She had no symptoms of any kind, after all. What neither of us realized, once you have symptoms, you might have waited too long. She went through surgery and chemo, which bought her a year.\u201d He gave her a small smile.</p><p>She surprised herself by covering his hand. \u201cTime eases a lot. I did the best I could back then, and so did you.\u201d</p><p>In the early afternoon they packed up their picnic and proceeded to Ferndale to stroll the neighborhoods to see the houses, dawdling and talking and laughing. They had an ice cream and looked in the shop windows and finally climbed the steep cemetery hill on the outskirts of town. Maureen was fascinated by the head-stones and read many of them. Suddenly she looked at her watch and realized she hadn\u2019t been paying attention to the time. \u201cOh, my God!\u201d she said, plucking the cell phone out of her purse. \u201cRosie!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s only three,\u201d George said.</p><p>\u201cBut I promised to pick her up today at three!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI can have you there by three-thirty. They\u2019re not going to leave her on the curb, are they?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, they\u2019re open till six for working parents, but...\u201d</p><p>He grabbed her wrist firmly to get her attention. \u201cMaureen, call the day-care center and tell them you\u2019re on your way. No harm done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSean. I should call Sean. He might be at Franci\u2019s and waiting for me to bring Rosie home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen call him,\u201d George said softly. \u201cShe\u2019s safe, Maureen. And you haven\u2019t been a bad grandmother by going on an outing with me.\u201d</p><p>She stilled immediately. Then she looked at her cell phone and called Sean. \u201cHi, Sean, it\u2019s me. I\u2019ve been out to lunch and lost track of time. I can be there to pick up Rosie by three-thirty if you\u2014All right, I\u2019ll see you at Franci\u2019s in a half hour or so. No, I\u2019m on my way.\u201d She ended the call and slipped the phone back into her purse. \u201cHe said he\u2019d run over and pick her up and I should take my time. But I\u2019d better get going.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOf course,\u201d George said. They stood on an incline in the middle of the cemetery and he stepped closer. He lifted her chin to look into her green eyes. \u201cYou lost all track of time because we were enjoying ourselves. That means the date was a success.\u201d He leaned toward her and gave her a peck on the lips. \u201cNow relax and I\u2019ll take you home.\u201d</p><p>And out of nowhere, completely unplanned and unprepared, Maureen threw her arms around George\u2019s neck and planted her lips on his. He stumbled backward a couple of steps before he came up against a large tombstone that balanced him. He was finally able to get his arms around her and hang on to her. He kissed her back, but as kisses go it wasn\u2019t much. It was the gesture that was startling.</p><p>She let him go.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d he said. \u201cYou should warn me when you\u2019re going to do that. We could have gone down the hill, then we\u2019d have to explain a couple of broken hips. That\u2019s more complicated than being a little late to day care.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what came over me,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter. Just make sure it comes over you again before long. I like it.\u201d He held out his hand. \u201cCome on. I\u2019ll walk you down. Slowly.\u201d</p><p>As the end of November approached, Franci and Sean talked to Rosie about the fact that Daddy had to go back to his flying job after Thanksgiving. It would mean that he could only visit when he had a few days off. They explained that he hoped they could spend Christmas together, but he wasn\u2019t sure he\u2019d be able to. \u201cBut I will call you and talk to you on the phone whenever I can. Sometimes every day.\u201d</p><p>To which Rosie replied, \u201c\u2019Kay.\u201d</p> <p>They avoided telling her about the larger problem\u2014that Sean would be transferred somewhere, probably soon after the new year. Perhaps someplace where he wouldn\u2019t be allowed to take a family.</p><p>They did get their marriage license and a very nice ring was being made for Franci, but their plans would have to wait until they knew more about the future.</p><p>Franci was past all the fear and anger she\u2019d felt when Sean had first reappeared in her life\u2014she no longer worried that her heart would be broken again, nor was she still angry about the way they\u2019d parted four years ago. Those thoughts were now all forgotten and she wondered how she had managed to live without him. As well, she didn\u2019t know how he\u2019d accomplished it, but he\u2019d turned into a wonderful father\u2014affectionate and devoted and completely comfortable in his role.</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t we used to fight all the time?\u201d she asked him.</p><p>\u201cIt seemed like a lot of arguing, but once we broke up all I could think about were the things we had going for us,\u201d he said. \u201cHere\u2019s what I know, babe. I think now we got it down. We might have some hurdles with the air force assignments, but from here on we\u2019re making it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t tell you about Rosie,\u201d she said to him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry I was so impossible to tell,\u201d he replied.</p><p>Every day Maureen found herself in very unfamiliar territory. Without saying a word to anyone besides Viv, she\u2019d spent several lunch hours with George Davenport over the couple of weeks before Thanksgiving. Like herself, he was heading back to Seattle after the holiday weekend. \u201cEnd of term,\u201d he said. \u201cI really need to be there. But what say we meet right back here for Christmas?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like that,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cHow attached are you to that condo in Phoenix?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s perfect for me,\u201d she said with a shrug. \u201cI don\u2019t have to cut grass or shovel snow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut do you like it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. Do you like where you\u2019re living?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been a good home for over twenty years, but I\u2019m thinking ahead. Mary\u2019s grown kids have moved away and they\u2019re really my only family besides Noah. I don\u2019t believe I\u2019m going to stay in that house in Seattle much longer. Or at the university, either. I\u2019m ready for the next step. A more portable lifestyle\u2014more freedom and travel.\u201d</p><p>She smiled and said, \u201cMaybe you\u2019ll visit Phoenix.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe I will. You\u2019ll let me have your guest room, won\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>She grinned and shook her head. \u201cThe complex has some guest apartments we can reserve for out-of-town company.\u201d</p><p>He lifted a brow and said, \u201cYou\u2019re not afraid to be alone with me, Maureen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot at all, but I won\u2019t have the gossip.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou would have made a fantastic nun,\u201d he told her. And then he laughed.</p><p>But she let him kiss her. Small, affectionate kisses\u2014that was enough. But something she was completely unprepared for was beginning to happen for her. Bringing George into her life was not simply about practicality or companionship at all, but more about the little tremors that vibrated inside her when he was near, when he touched her ever so briefly, when he brushed his lips against hers. She had no idea that a woman in her sixties could feel like a teenager.</p><p>She kept remembering what Vivian had said about mature love\u2014that it was slower, sweeter, more tender and very fulfilling. Such thoughts made her shiver.</p><p>She had yet another long lunch with George planned for today. They were making the most of their time together before Aiden appeared for Thanksgiving week and Maureen concentrated on family again. When she heard the blast of a horn in front of Vivian\u2019s house, she was astonished. She went to the window thinking that it couldn\u2019t be George honking for her. He was, above all else, a gentleman. He was debonaire.</p><p>But there, sitting in front of the house, was Noah\u2019s old RV, and George was standing outside the door. Her mouth slightly open, she wandered out of the house.</p><p>\u201cGeorge, what\u2019s this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat I really want to do is take you for another picnic, this time on the coast by the ocean, but it would be torture in this cold wind. So I volunteered to take Noah\u2019s RV for its weekly housekeeping\u2014empty the lavs, load the potable water, all the stuff that has to be done regularly. He was more than happy to put me on that job since I\u2019ve been using the RV as a hotel room. But I\u2019ll tell you the real reason I wanted to steal the RV\u2014I\u2019m going to take you to the ocean and we\u2019re going to have a picnic. But we\u2019ll sit inside, at the table next to the big window, and be nice and warm and comfy. And alone.\u201d</p><p>She grinned and knew it was a girlish smile. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I ought to get into a vehicle that private with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you can be sure the neighbors won\u2019t talk! Now get your jacket and purse, lock up the house and let\u2019s get going.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll just be a minute,\u201d she said. He was in the driver\u2019s seat by the time she got back. She climbed up and inside and sat in the seat beside him. While he drove the big vehicle down the street, she turned in her seat and craned her neck to take in the interior. \u201cThat\u2019s a cute little kitchen,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat did you make us for lunch?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTakeout,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to waste my time preparing food. How does it feel? Riding up here?\u201d</p><p>She looked out. \u201cI like it. It\u2019s wonderful being high. I\u2019ve been frustrated by all the big cars on the road. Big SUVs, trucks, vans and such. I\u2019ve always hated being behind them and blind to what\u2019s going on up the road. This is nice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot only is there a bathroom, kitchen, washer and dryer, master bedroom and living room, but a satellite for TV and radio reception, and storage underneath. And this is an old RV. I\u2019m not much of a mechanic, so I hope it runs without any problems.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, George, what would we do if it broke down?\u201d she worried.</p><p>\u201cCall Noah,\u201d he said. \u201cHe\u2019d come with his toolbox. He\u2019s been keeping this thing going for years. It\u2019s kind of nifty, don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do,\u201d she said. \u201cIs it hard to maneuver?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a bit. I could let you try it, if you like.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, thanks.\u201d She laughed. She ran a hand along the console. \u201cBut it\u2019s fun, George. I have to hand it to you\u2014you\u2019re always fun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy, thank you, Mrs. Riordan,\u201d he said. \u201cThing is, I\u2019ve decided what I\u2019m going to do next. I have to go back to the university, of course. Next semester, I\u2019m cutting back my schedule. I need more freedom. I\u2019m going to transition out, sneak up on retirement. I\u2019m going to get myself one of these!\u201d he exclaimed, smacking the steering wheel. \u201cMary\u2019s sons are married and have children\u2014they\u2019re great kids, superior stepsons. One lives in Texas, one in Florida. I\u2019m going to put my house on the market and retire by the end of school, just in time to begin traveling. I\u2019m going to see this country one state at a time, and I\u2019m going to drop in on those boys. They both have amazing wives. One has three children, one has two\u2014and even though I\u2019m a stepfather, they call me Papa instead of Grandpa. I\u2019m going to visit them occasionally while I\u2019m traveling, then move on to other sights, then check back in. What do you think of that idea?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Her smile was alive. \u201cIt sounds wonderful. You\u2019ll enjoy that. Maybe I\u2019ll even see you now and then in Virgin River.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr, you could come along,\u201d he said. \u201cYou have all those military boys all over the place. We could check on them, as well. And believe me, once a couple of them get married and have children, the others fall in line. I\u2019ve seen it a million times. As soon as I get an offer on the house\u2014which is a good house and should bring a nice price even in a depressed economy\u2014I\u2019m going to start shopping for a quality RV. I\u2019ve been looking at pictures online. Maureen, you have no idea how high tech these things have become! They now come with expandable sides, two people showers, freezers, big screens in the living room and bedroom, Whirlpool tubs\u2014you name it! How\u2019d you like to have a hot tub on wheels, Maureen?\u201d</p><p>She looked over at him. He was so excited by his idea, he was actually a little flushed, and she found herself hoping it wasn\u2019t high blood pressure. If the moment ever presented itself, she\u2019d ask about that. But after all his rambling about his future RV, all she could say was, \u201cCome along?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cA perfect solution for both of us,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019d have time together, we\u2019d have fun together. We\u2019d see the families, travel...\u201d</p><p>\u201cGeorge, that\u2019s outrageous. We\u2019ve had a few lunches\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd we\u2019ll have a few more! We\u2019ll also e-mail, talk on the phone, get together occasionally\u2014in Virgin River, but also in Phoenix and Seattle. We\u2019ll spend the next six months figuring out if we fit as well as it seems we do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLong distance? Occasional visits?\u201d she asked doubtfully.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll give you time to look over my accounts to be sure you\u2019re not getting conned out of your retirement.\u201d He laughed at his own joke, slapping his knee. \u201cOf course, with five brawny, overprotective sons you\u2019re relatively safe from a dangerous guy like me.\u201d He glanced at her and his expression was playful. \u201cWe\u2019re not young, Maureen. We should be sure we\u2019re attracted to each other and that we get along, but we shouldn\u2019t waste a lot of time. Every day is precious.\u201d He reached for her hand and squeezed it. \u201cI\u2019m very attracted to you. I\u2019d love to get you alone in a fancy RV for a few years.\u201d</p> <p>She laughed at him; she hated that she was behaving like such a girl. \u201cHave you lost your mind?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been wondering what to do next. I\u2019ve had a couple of fulfilling careers, but I can\u2019t go on preaching and teaching forever\u2014I\u2019ll get bored. At a point I should retire again. When I lost Mary, I filled my time with activities\u2014friends for dinner, going to the movies, attending a new play. I had a very nice life with Mary. I loved her deeply, as I\u2019m sure you loved your Patrick. I miss her. But I also miss having a best friend to spend time with. Maureen, this is guaranteed not to sweep you off your feet, but you\u2019re the first woman I\u2019ve met in years who could actually be that kind of friend! We have so much in common it\u2019s amazing!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve slipped a cog,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have nothing in common! I\u2019m Catholic, you\u2019re Presbyterian! I was almost a nun, you were a minister!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlmost a nun with five sons in ten years and, for your information, I\u2019m still ordained.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPhhhtttt,\u201d she emitted. \u201cI like to play tennis, golf and bridge!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI jog,\u201d he said. \u201cI could learn tennis. I\u2019ve always enjoyed golf but bridge bores the crap out of me.\u201d</p> <p>She burst out laughing. \u201cBores me, too,\u201d she said. \u201cBut the women gather for bridge and so I play with them. But, George, I\u2019m not about to commit to a man I\u2019ve known such a short time and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not, Maureen! Here\u2019s my proposal. Let\u2019s carry on! How hard is that? Let\u2019s communicate, visit, get to know each other and, even better, spend quality time together when we can. You\u2019ll want to visit that little granddaughter, and I have to keep tabs on Noah so he doesn\u2019t go astray! And six months down the road, we\u2019ll be more sure of ourselves, and of our relationship. And, believe me, six months is asking a lot of a seventy-year-old guy!\u201d</p><p>She narrowed her eyes. \u201cHow\u2019s your health?\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcellent! After what happened to Mary by avoiding the doctor, I get a good physical every six months. I\u2019m on cholesterol medicine, though. But I think it\u2019s a waste of time. My father lived to be eighty-eight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m on cholesterol and high-blood-pressure medicine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s working.\u201d She shrugged.</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t it amazing? My doctor says, as long as we can find and treat these things, we\u2019re going to be fairly hard to kill!\u201d</p> <p>Maureen shook her head and laughed. She would not let him get a foot in the door with this insane idea, but she knew, at once, she would have fun with him. Piles of fun. \u201cI would have to run this idea by my priest,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cWhatever works for you,\u201d he agreed. \u201cBut what idea are you talking about? The idea of getting to know me better, or the idea of joining me in the RV if it works out?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t answer. She chewed her bottom lip and thought about when she\u2019d gone to her parish priest as a young mother and said she could not keep having babies\u2014she just wasn\u2019t up to it! She wanted his blessing\u2014the church\u2019s blessing\u2014on birth control before she lost her mind and her body. He wasn\u2019t much help, and she\u2019d already given natural birth control\u2014timing her cycle, et cetera\u2014two fair shots. They were named Sean and Patrick, Jr. She clicked her tongue without realizing it. That was more than thirty years ago and there had been progress on these matters in the church since. But she had to admit that some of the rules had been hard to take at that time.</p><p>\u201cForget I said that,\u201d she answered. \u201cWhat did you get for take-out lunch?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWonderful, fat deli sandwiches, coleslaw, sweet tea and brownies. How does that sound?\u201d</p><p>She smiled at him. \u201cBetter than you know.\u201d</p><p>George pulled the RV off the road at a scenic outlook beside the ocean. They sat at the table and ate their sandwiches, talking about all the places in the United States they hadn\u2019t seen and would love to visit. Maureen lived in Arizona and had never been to the Grand Canyon; George wanted to extend his RV adventure into Canada and Alaska. It all began to sound like a fantasy, a dream trip.</p><p>\u201cGeorge,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat if one of us gets sick?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not going to the wilds of Africa,\u201d he said with a shrug. \u201cWe can stop at a hospital. We\u2019ll see a doctor or\u2014\u201d But then he smiled at her. \u201cBut we should, if we feel like it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShould what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo to Africa. And maybe a long cruise...\u201d</p><p>She sat back in her chair. \u201cHave you been dreaming this up for years?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cJust the opposite. I didn\u2019t know what I was going to do with myself. I\u2019m not young\u2014I have some years of travel in me, then I\u2019ll probably have to settle down a little and be happy with the occasional trip. You have longer, I suppose. But the truth, Maureen? All these fun ideas didn\u2019t even occur to me until I met you. Mary thought of stuff like this, but we were never able to act on them. You know what my late wife used to say? That it was her goal to have the grandchildren say, \u2018Anyone seen Grandma?\u2019\u201d He laughed at himself. Then he sobered. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry. It\u2019s probably such a faux pas, trying to tempt you with things my late wife said.\u201d</p><p>But Maureen loved it. It had been such a long time since she\u2019d been tempted by anything! By a man, by living, by having fun, by risk and chance and dare! She would love to sell her condo, get rid of all that precious furniture she\u2019d polished, pampered and protected for so many years\u2014furniture that never managed to look good in that fancy condo! She\u2019d love to give her sons the keepsakes she\u2019d stored for them! The old school pictures, report cards and clay handprints. And the little china and crystal bric-a-brac her mother and mother-in-law left? What was she going to do with them after she was dead? Cart them with her to heaven? The boys could have all the Christmas ornaments from their childhood, their baby pictures, their school projects; their wives could have their great-grandmother\u2019s silver and dishes. It wasn\u2019t as though she sat up on lonely nights caressing that stuff! She\u2019d much rather see the Grand Canyon!</p><p>She thought about drifting from grandchild to grandchild across the country, taking them on overnights in an RV, going on shopping trips and buying them presents from Europe, Asia, Africa!</p><p>Six months, George had said. Six months to see if they were really as compatible as they seemed. She laughed suddenly. She hadn\u2019t made Patrick, Sr., work at winning her for any longer than that!</p><p>\u201cFunny? Did I offend you?\u201d George asked.</p><p>She grabbed both his hands across the RV\u2019s table. \u201cNot at all. I think I would have loved Mary. We would have been friends. In spite of the fact that she was Presbyterian!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I think,\u201d he said. \u201cBut, Maureen, don\u2019t get the impression you\u2019re exactly like her. You didn\u2019t get my attention because you\u2019re anything like my late wife! In fact, you\u2019re very different in lots of ways. I\u2019ll tell you all about that another day. It\u2019s bad manners to discuss your wife with your girlfriend.\u201d He frowned slightly. \u201cYou have an odd look on your face. Does all this talk about her bother you? Does my suggestion about an RV upset you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, not at all,\u201d she said. She didn\u2019t intend to give him too much information too fast, but truthfully, she was looking forward to things. Fun, exciting, fantastic things that had never occurred to her before...and someone very wonderful to do them with. She suddenly realized that while she\u2019d been content the past several years, she hadn\u2019t been excited about the future in a long time. In fact, she couldn\u2019t remember when she\u2019d last felt that way.</p><p>Fifteen</p><p>The very day that George proposed the RV idea, Maureen was invited to have dinner with Vivian and Carl. In fact, the invitation was extended to George, as well, but Maureen was not quite ready for a double date\u2014things were just too new. She had offered to cook them a nice dinner, but Vivian demurred. \u201cCarl is a wonderful cook and he loves it. His kids have plans tonight and he\u2019s going to run by the grocery on his way over,\u201d she had said. \u201cFor once, just be a guest.\u201d</p><p>So after a couple of hours of playtime with Rosie, Maureen was back at Vivian\u2019s for dinner. Vivian and Carl were already in the kitchen; Carl was searing something at the stove and Viv was in charge of some slicing and dicing on the cutting board.</p><p>\u201cMo!\u201d she said happily, turning from her chore and wiping her hands on a towel. \u201cHere you are. Meet Carl. Dr. Johnson.\u201d</p><p>And as Carl turned from the stove and extended his hand, Maureen found herself face-to-face with a very tall, very handsome black man. \u201cCarl Johnson,\u201d he said, as though she hadn\u2019t heard his name.</p><p>\u201cHow do you do,\u201d she said, taking his hand and looking up at him. Her first thought was that Vivian might\u2019ve mentioned that he was black. In that kind of quandary, she blurted, \u201cJohnson? You\u2019re Swedish!\u201d</p><p>He threw back his head in a fantastic, deep, wonderful laugh. \u201cViv said I\u2019d love you! African-American, Korean, Native American and Caucasian,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a pleasure. How long have you been in Eureka?\u201d Maureen asked.</p><p>\u201cOver twenty years. My late wife was from Fort Bragg and we ended up starting the practice here. It\u2019s a good place to raise kids\u2014I have a boy and a girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo Vivian told me,\u201d she said. \u201cCan I help with dinner?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cFrom what I hear about you, it will be hard for you to sit idle for even five minutes, but just pull a stool up to the breakfast bar and visit with us. You\u2019re going to love this,\u201d he promised, turning back to the stove. \u201cHow about a glass of wine?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerfect,\u201d she accepted. \u201cSomething white and maybe dry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRed is better for you,\u201d he said. \u201cHow about a merlot?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOffice hours are over, Carl,\u201d Vivian scolded, getting out the glasses and pouring Maureen the same chardonnay that she had for herself.</p><p>When Maureen had her glass, she said, \u201cNow, I want to hear all about how the two of you met.\u201d</p><p>Carl had a rumbling laugh that Maureen instantly loved. He was truly a beautiful man; his blended background gave his complexion the color of heavily creamed coffee and his large, dark eyes had a slight, almost exotic slant. He was well over six feet, perhaps as tall as six-four, while Vivian was a small average at about five-four. She was petite and he was large; he was dark brown and she was pale blond. And yet they seemed perfect for each other. They joked and bantered and shared quick affectionate pets and pats in the kitchen while they worked together.</p><p>\u201cHow we met is pretty boring. My partner hired Vivian. The practice was getting very busy and, rather than bringing in a fourth doctor, we decided on a PA.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI worked for a women\u2019s health clinic in Santa Rosa for years before moving up here with Franci. I didn\u2019t think my chance of finding a good PA\u2019s position here was very good, given the size of the county. And it turned out I landed the best job at the best doctor\u2019s office in the entire state.\u201d</p> <p>Carl turned from the stove and grinned. \u201cShe might be just slightly prejudiced about that. We have a nice little practice. We do some good work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, your partner hired her, and then what happened?\u201d Maureen boldly asked.</p><p>Both Vivian and Carl turned and gave her their full attention for a moment, as though it was curious she asked. Then Carl answered, \u201cWe had good rapport but, at the time we started working together, my wife was very ill, and shortly after that she died. Honestly, I couldn\u2019t focus on much else at the time. It was a year after my wife\u2019s death before I asked Vivian for a bona fide date. We\u2019ve been dating since\u2014a little over a year. But my wife has only been gone two years, and my kids, still under twenty, haven\u2019t adjusted very well. My nineteen-year-old daughter, especially. She really can\u2019t imagine me with a significant other and I\u2019m giving her plenty of time.\u201d Then he smiled broadly, put his arm around Vivian and pulled her closer. \u201cPlenty of time, but not forever. She\u2019s in her second year of college and soon we\u2019re going to talk about how everyone gets a life, not just the kids.\u201d</p><p>Carl prepared an astonishingly good goulash and they sat around the dining table long past dinner, visiting and laughing. Carl was the one to clear the table and serve slices of cheesecake with coffee, extending their good time. When it was time to clean up, Vivian and Carl wouldn\u2019t let Maureen in the kitchen. She was shuffled off to the living room to watch TV, read or do her needlepoint, and they promised to join her in just a few minutes.</p><p>While she sat in the chair that had become hers, she found herself thinking that even though she\u2019d lived independently, happily, she\u2019d somehow allowed her life to become too narrow. She had quite a lot of friends, but they were acquaintances really\u2014people she\u2019d known for years, but none of them felt as close as Vivian had become in just weeks. She\u2019d been constantly busy\u2014activities day in and day out, and yet nothing really got her motor running. She never took chances, never tried anything the least bit daring. She was stunned and embarrassed by her surprise to find Vivian in love with a black man, and how narrow was that?</p><p>Or how about an almost-nun traveling the country in an RV with a minister?</p> <p>In the end it was what she heard in the kitchen that filled her with envy. When the water stopped running and she could hear the quiet sounds of conversation and soft laughter as dishes and flatware were being stored away, she longed for that in her life. A deep and romantic relationship, love and affection, laughter and adventure.</p><p>She heard Vivian giggle and Carl purr. Six months suddenly seemed like a very long time, and right then she offered up a promise to herself.</p><p>I\u2019m in my sixties; it\u2019s late to become enlightened. I hereby vow to be relentlessly happy, ridiculously daring, outrageously open-minded and passionately optimistic.</p><p>At the onset of Thanksgiving week, specifically on Sunday at noon, Jack\u2019s Bar was full of people with bags and boxes filled with nonperishable food items. Jack and Preacher had been collecting the donations for Thanksgiving baskets for a couple of weeks. Jack liked the idea of presenting the food in a classy Harry &amp; David type basket with a beautiful arrangement of food, but that was impractical for what they had in mind. Instead, he went to a shipping outlet and bought some sturdy boxes.</p><p>For the past couple of months Jack and Preacher had had a jar on the bar with a sign on it that said Donations for Thanksgiving Baskets. They had collected more than enough money to buy nonperishable canned turkey and ham and some apples and oranges. In this, the first year of their project, they estimated they would deliver fifteen boxes of food to needy individuals and families. Noah Kincaid and Mel Sheridan had managed to come up with a list of folks who could use some help. If they had surplus after arranging these boxes of food, Mel would have no trouble coming up with more names; she was the one with the most experience in outreach.</p><p>Jack was supervising the stocking of the boxes\u2014cans of vegetables, powdered milk, instant potatoes and rice, gravy mix, boxed stuffing, even canned cranberries. There were things that didn\u2019t really fit on the Thanksgiving menu that people would be happy to have if their budgets were tight\u2014fruit cocktail, canned pork and beans, chili mix, lentils, black-eyed peas, chicken soup. \u201cCocktail weenies?\u201d he asked, holding up a little can. \u201cWho gives cocktail weenies to a needy family?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mighta done that,\u201d said Hope McCrea, pushing her big black glasses up on her nose.</p><p>\u201cThe can is bulging,\u201d Jack said.</p> <p>\u201cBeen a while since I had a yen for cocktail weenies,\u201d Hope replied, unrepentant.</p><p>Jack pitched the can in the trash. \u201cSorry, Hope. Can\u2019t take a chance on killing anyone our first try at this.\u201d He pulled out a bag from the Dollar Store that was filled with little can openers. He passed them out to his wife, Noah and Ellie, Preacher and Paige, Mike and Brie. George Davenport was on hand to help, of course. \u201cMake sure one of these goes in every box. Mel, are you taking care of the boxes for families with babies? We\u2019ve got diapers, formula and baby food.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m on it,\u201d she said. \u201cThe neediest people Noah and I see are either families with small children or the elderly. Right, Noah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d he affirmed.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s more than fifteen families who need help, huh,\u201d Jack said, and it wasn\u2019t a question. \u201cWe should\u2019ve been doing this for years. Preacher, why didn\u2019t we ever do this before?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cBecause we do everything else,\u201d Preacher said. And this was true\u2014wherever help was needed, they tried to pitch in. It wasn\u2019t unusual to see Jack and Preacher under the hoods of cars and trucks, or picking up groceries for widows and young mothers while they bought their bar stock. They helped Mel and Cameron at the clinic when asked, and of course they were on hand for any kind of search and rescue around the mountains. Last winter a school bus slid off the road and down the mountainside and all the men from town were there instantly, ready to assist emergency responders. Jack was the first one on the scene and Preacher was the second.</p><p>Noah laughed at Preacher\u2019s remark. \u201cFrom all I can see, people in this town do a fine job of lending a hand wherever they can. My house is almost habitable, thanks to the neighbors. We might not be able to cook a turkey in it this year, but we\u2019ll be in there for Christmas. The kids are going to have Santa in their own house.\u201d He looked around the bar. \u201cWho\u2019s on board to deliver these boxes of food?\u201d</p><p>Every hand went up and Noah laughed again. \u201cThen I guess the job gets done fast and easy! Just don\u2019t leave anything on a doorstep\u2014you have to put it in the hands of an adult, otherwise wildlife could get into it. If there\u2019s no adult, we\u2019ll go back a second time. I know it\u2019s not Thanksgiving till Thursday, but I think it\u2019s practical to distribute now. Those who are able might try to save this for a holiday dinner they wouldn\u2019t otherwise have and those who are not able...\u201d He paused. \u201cAre not able to wait,\u201d he finally said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a little embarrassed it took some city-boy preacher to get a project like this going in our own town,\u201d Jack said. \u201cWe should\u2019ve been on this. We start for Christmas right away. And then we get going on holiday baskets for next year in July. And, Hope, don\u2019t be throwing any of your old weenies in the basket.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou never know who\u2019s in the mood for a weenie,\u201d she said with a sparkle in her eye.</p><p>\u201cI would give anything to see the inside of that mausoleum you live in,\u201d Jack muttered.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s filled to the ceiling with little cans of cocktail weenies,\u201d she said.</p><p>The door to the bar opened and Dan Brady and Cheryl Creighton came in. Dan was carrying a large box and Cheryl held on to two bags. \u201cAre we too late to add to the Thanksgiving baskets?\u201d Dan asked. \u201cWe meant to get this done sooner...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re in time, no problem. In fact, if we figured right, you might be bringing us surplus, which means we can add a couple of families to our list,\u201d Jack said. He looked in the box Dan held and pulled out a jar of dark liquid. \u201cPrune juice?\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI am not drinking that stuff. Ever,\u201d Dan said.</p><p>\u201cJack,\u201d Noah said with laughter in his voice. He put a hand on Jack\u2019s shoulder and gave a little shake. \u201cReally, you can\u2019t be judging people\u2019s contributions.\u201d But he laughed some more.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s icky, but it\u2019s nutritious,\u201d Cheryl said. \u201cLotta vitamins in it. And I stopped in at the truck stop diner I used to work in and talked the owner out of some bulk-size canned goods\u2014they\u2019re out in Dan\u2019s truck. You can probably figure out a way to use them in your food drive.\u201d</p><p>Jack was just standing still, looking at Cheryl with a smile on his face. \u201cIt\u2019s nice you\u2019re here,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t know what possessed you to hook up with that lunatic,\u201d Jack said, smiling at Dan.\u201d But it\u2019s real nice you\u2019re here. Thanks.\u201d</p><p>She threaded her fingers in Dan\u2019s, staking her claim, but she smiled at Jack. \u201cNo thanks necessary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you put that house of yours on the market?\u201d Jack asked.</p><p>\u201cI did. The Realtor seems to think it\u2019ll sell pretty easy. Dan made it beautiful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you come around sometimes after it\u2019s sold?\u201d Jack asked. \u201cMaybe let me buy you dinner?\u201d</p><p>She laughed. During her drinking days, Jack wouldn\u2019t let her in the door. \u201cYou serve food in this place?\u201d She slipped her arm around Dan\u2019s waist and he put his arm around her shoulders. \u201cYeah, I\u2019ll pop in once in a while, just to say hello.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019d like that, Cheryl,\u201d Preacher said. \u201cCome Thursday if you don\u2019t have other plans.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI work at the community college during the week.\u201d</p><p>Dan laughed and gave her a squeeze. \u201cNot this week, honey. It\u2019s Thanksgiving.\u201d</p><p>She looked momentarily startled. \u201cAnd you\u2019re open on Thanksgiving?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cA few of us like to get together,\u201d Preacher said. \u201cAnd I put on a real culinary show. You shouldn\u2019t miss it. Four o\u2019clock.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Franci had been so busy over the past few weeks that she didn\u2019t give a second thought to T. J. Brookner. Sometimes when she was at the college, she thought about their brief period of dating and the harsh words from him at their parting, and thought, What a close call! She wondered how long she might\u2019ve hung in there with T.J. ordering her dinner, telling her what to like and not like, if Sean hadn\u2019t turned up. She was just grateful it hadn\u2019t gone on any longer, especially having faced his incredible anger. That had been spooky.</p><p>And then, suddenly and accidentally, she stumbled upon a whole new dimension to the man.</p><p>After a brief workout in the college weight room and a shower before going home, a couple of female voices carried across the lockers, just as she was drying off.</p> <p>\u201cGone, I hear,\u201d one said. \u201cSuspended and likely to be fired. God bless the Internet, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas it like I heard?\u201d asked another female voice. \u201cCaught red-handed? By a nanny cam?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLiterally with his pants down,\u201d said the first. \u201cIt must have been fantastic. How about that? All these years he\u2019s been claiming that just because he\u2019s marginally handsome and the girls flirt with him, he\u2019s been victimized by gossip. Poor, poor Professor Hottie, caught on tape with two naked eighteen-year-old blondes.\u201d</p><p>Both women giggled. Franci gasped and dropped her towel to the floor.</p><p>\u201cThe story is that this particular m\u00e9nage \u00e0 trois started in Cabo on his last diving trip. I suppose he thought he was in control of the girls and it turned out they were in the driver\u2019s seat! One of them had a hidden camera and put the movie on the Internet. From the comments on the site, they were hardly the first. This has been going on forever.\u201d</p> <p>Franci wandered closer to the voices to hear better. Cabo? she thought. What about his \u201cbuddy system\u201d? Sounded as if he had a couple of buddies, all right. He was supposed to have been Franci\u2019s boyfriend on that trip to Cabo. So much for that.</p><p>\u201cI think he\u2019s scum, but what\u2019s the actual big deal? Is it against the law or something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI dunno what\u2019s against the law\u2014the word is they were all consenting, but the dean didn\u2019t appreciate him boinking the students on a field trip. There\u2019s policy about that sort of thing\u2014no diddling the students. And the gossip has been pretty damning\u2014he\u2019s been manipulating female students into sexually compromising situations for years. Old-timers around here say his wife left him because he couldn\u2019t keep his hands off the freshmen girls.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not the first guy who likes younger women...\u201d</p><p>The voices drifted off as the door to the locker room opened and the two women exited. And Franci thought dispiritedly, I believed every word he said.</p><p>Franci pulled on her jeans and sweatshirt. She was in such a hurry to get out of there, she stuffed her bra in her purse and pulled on her boots without socks. She left the gym without drying her hair and went out in the cold with a wet head. Her stomach flipped and churned as images she just couldn\u2019t block came into her mind. Fresh young women, vulnerable students, taken advantage of by a man of forty, an instructor. Did he trade sex for grades?</p> <p>You give me credibility, he had said to her. No one gossiped about him when he had a woman with looks and brains as his girlfriend.</p><p>So, there was a lot more about the whole relationship than just his controlling nature. She was nothing more than a decoy. She felt violated.</p><p>She drove home in a daze.</p><p>She drove too fast; she couldn\u2019t wait to get to Sean. It never even occurred to her not to tell him! When she walked in her house, Sean was sitting at the dining room table with the newspaper spread out in front of him. \u201cWhere\u2019s Rosie?\u201d she asked, before she even said hello.</p><p>\u201cMy mom is picking her up and they\u2019re stopping at the store. Maureen\u2019s cooking to\u2014Hey, you\u2019re white as a sheet.\u201d He stood. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter? Were you in an accident or something?\u201d</p><p>She just stared at him for a long moment. She thought about spilling the whole story right there, but instead she just walked into his arms. \u201cClose call,\u201d she said. \u201cHold me. I\u2019ll tell you all about it later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d</p><p>She nestled in closer. She realized uneasily that she hadn\u2019t really known as much as she should have about T.J., but she knew everything about Sean. She knew his strengths and weaknesses. He had never lied to her. When she first saw Sean a month ago, she thought he\u2019d reappeared to screw up her life. She\u2019d literally wanted to rearrange his face. Now, she ran into his arms for comfort and support. Her best friend. A man she knew she could trust. \u201cI\u2019ll be fine now,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Aiden arrived in Virgin River late on Tuesday, planning to stay until Sunday. He hadn\u2019t been there long before he realized the relationships in his family were changing quite a bit, and quickly. He found his scrappy older brother all soft around the edges, doting on his beautiful, sexy young wife, ever at her hand. If he saw her wrestling a full laundry basket into the bedroom, he took it from her. If she had the step stool pulled over to the cupboards to reach into the highest one for a platter, he lifted her down and got it for her. Aiden was anxious to have dinner with them to see if Luke cut Shelby\u2019s meat.</p><p>Aiden caught Shelby in a moment alone and asked, \u201cWhen do you suppose you\u2019re due?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did you guess?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never seen Luke act like this\u2014hovering, protective, sweet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnnoying, cloying and paternal. I don\u2019t have a date\u2014I haven\u2019t been to the doctor yet. But I suspect it happened on the wedding night, just as Luke planned.\u201d</p><p>Aiden laughed. \u201cYou\u2019re going to want to watch that. Unless you want six of them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I might have two, but not six.\u201d She grinned. \u201cSnip, snip.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave to admire a forward-thinking woman,\u201d Aiden said with a grin. \u201cCongratulations.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose there\u2019s no point in keeping it under wraps anymore, now that you and Sean both know. And if Sean knows, Franci knows. And if we don\u2019t tell Maureen soon, she\u2019ll feel left out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpeaking of Maureen, is she driving you crazy?\u201d Aiden asked.</p><p>Shelby shook her head. \u201cI feel so guilty that she isn\u2019t staying with us here, but she\u2019s smart. Two women under the same roof for a long period of time will eventually have a power struggle. But not Maureen and Vivian\u2014they seem to have a special bond. Luke says they\u2019re a couple of strange old broads,\u201d she said with a giggle. \u201cReally, their living situation seems to be working out just fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can give the credit to me,\u201d Aiden said.</p><p>\u201cLove your humility,\u201d Shelby said with a laugh.</p><p>\u201cSeriously\u2014my advice to her was to stay out of the way. I don\u2019t know much about mothers and daughters\u2014maybe they do all right for extended visits. I can tell you that we all worship our mom\u2014there\u2019s no woman I admire more\u2014but I don\u2019t want to live with her for more than four days, tops. I wasn\u2019t that concerned about how you\u2019d deal with her, Shelby. I was afraid Luke would strangle her after a few days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith everyone else in the world, Maureen is easygoing. She knows how to put people at ease, make them comfortable. But with her sons, she has high expectations. She\u2019s been trying really hard to keep a lid on it, but she eventually always has an opinion about how we should live our lives. Not a one of us has gone about things the way she\u2019d like.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? But that can\u2019t be right! She\u2019s totally proud of you all!\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh.\u201d Aiden laughed. \u201cExcept for a few little things. Luke avoided commitment for too long after his bad marriage. Colin has had woman trouble of one stripe or another since he was fifteen. She was completely disappointed in me for marrying someone for only three months\u2014she thinks I just didn\u2019t make an effort. Sean has a child because he refused to commit. And Patrick, her pride and joy and baby, is rumored to be thinking of marrying a girl who isn\u2019t just a non-Catholic\u2014she calls herself agnostic. Did you know my mother almost became a nun?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI heard that, yes. That might explain some things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBelieve me, I know nuns who are more liberal than Maureen...\u201d He laughed and shook his head.</p><p>\u201cYour brother is actually worried about her. He\u2019s planning to have a talk with you. Maybe you can help in some way. You seem to have the best rapport with her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt could be nothing. I didn\u2019t even really notice at the time. A nice friend of our local minister stopped to talk while we were all having dinner at Jack\u2019s and Maureen completely blew him off. He asked her out to dinner and she lied and said no, because she\u2019s recently widowed. He\u2019s a very nice man\u2014handsome, funny, just a few years older than Maureen. Luke called her on it and she said she would absolutely never date, not even just to be social. Something about all that being for young girls.\u201d</p><p>Aiden\u2019s dark brows lifted in surprise. \u201cIs that right? I never gave it much thought, but I assumed she went out occasionally and just didn\u2019t mention it to us. She\u2019s like that\u2014she can be so private she\u2019s almost secretive. I didn\u2019t want to pry, but she was always busy enough that she had to be doing something. Maybe I just hated to think she spent all that time doing volunteer work at the church or hanging out with other widows. My mother is beautiful and she can be a lot of fun. I\u2019ve always been a little surprised she didn\u2019t remarry. In the first couple of years after Da died, I admit I was relieved she didn\u2019t hook up right away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRelieved?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t want to see her make an impetuous move like that out of loneliness and have it turn out to be a mistake. But after twelve years, it\u2019s becoming harder to see my mom all alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not alone,\u201d Shelby said. \u201cShe has a million friends and lots to do, but she believes she\u2019s too old for romance.\u201d</p><p>He smiled. \u201cI had a patient last year whose eighty-three-year-old mother just got married for the second time. She wore a lacy white gown.\u201d He chuckled. \u201cAnd her orthopedic shoes. My patient said her mother was a little flushed for a month. True love. I\u2019d prefer to think my mother was open to something like that than being closed off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you try to talk to her, then? Will you be delicate?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have no choice but to be delicate. The only time my mother will discuss anything personal is if it\u2019s about one of us.\u201d He put his arm around Shelby and gave her a squeeze. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about Maureen, Shelby. I think she\u2019s happy with her life. If she\u2019s avoiding how much more fulfilling it could be, at the end of the day it\u2019s her choice.\u201d And Aiden thought to himself that if she\u2019s not even aware of how much more life could give her, maybe she\u2019s the lucky one. For Aiden\u2019s part, he was all too aware what was missing for him.</p><p>On the day before Thanksgiving, Maureen planned on baking at Luke\u2019s house. She drove to the grocery, collected all the supplies she needed and then went to Virgin River. Sean was keeping Rosie out of preschool and day care for the day so she could get acquainted with her uncle Aiden before the big dinner on Thanksgiving. Maureen would be doing what she loved most\u2014spending time with her family and making them her special holiday treats. The only thing that would have made it better was if Paddy and Colin could have joined them, but neither one had managed to get leave. It would have been delightful to share Thanksgiving Day with George, but of course he\u2019d be with Noah and his family.</p><p>When she pulled into Luke\u2019s cabin complex, Aiden was waiting on the porch, a cup of coffee in hand. She left her groceries in the car and went to him. He set his cup on the porch rail and wrapped his arms around her, laughing and hugging. \u201cYou look fantastic,\u201d he said. \u201cI think being a grandmother agrees with you!\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She leaned away from him. \u201cYou have no idea, Aiden. She\u2019s absolutely wonderful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I hear. She should be here before long. Sean called to say they were on their way. I\u2019m surprised you beat them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI got an early start,\u201d she said. \u201cI have groceries in the car. Help me bring them in?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re joking, right? Go inside and help yourself to a cup of coffee while I get them for you.\u201d</p><p>When all the supplies were unloaded onto the kitchen counters, Maureen and Aiden sat at the breakfast bar with coffee for a long overdue visit. It was just the two of them, a rare thing. Luke and Art were running an errand and Shelby was at school.</p><p>\u201cTell me about your visit so far,\u201d Aiden said. \u201cHow do things seem between Franci and Sean?\u201d</p><p>She lifted an eyebrow. \u201cYou haven\u2019t talked to your brother?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeveral times, but I was interested in hearing your take on things.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIf there\u2019s the slightest imperfection in their relationship, I can\u2019t imagine what it is, besides the fact they\u2019re not married. I take that back\u2014the one flaw is that everyone is a little on edge, wondering where the air force will send Sean next, and when. Otherwise, they seem so happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m facing transfer orders before long, too,\u201d he said. \u201cSean\u2019s overdue. Any day now he\u2019s going to get the word\u2014and he doesn\u2019t want to uproot Francine and Rosie from their home and routine when everything could shift again in a month or two.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you, too, Aiden?\u201d she asked. \u201cWhat are you expecting?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have no idea. I applied for a fellowship in high-risk pregnancy specialty, but I won\u2019t hear on that before spring,\u201d Aiden said. \u201cFor Sean\u2019s family, until they get a permanent assignment, Franci is best right where she is, in her own house with a job she likes and a mom who can help out with Rosie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRosie\u2019s going to miss Sean when he goes back to Beale,\u201d Maureen said. \u201cThey spend every day together.\u201d</p><p>Aiden chuckled, shaking his head. \u201cSo much for the man who didn\u2019t want to be tied down to a child.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe two most stubborn males in the family,\u201d she said. \u201cLuke and Sean, the great playboys of the Western world. They always did make the rest of you look like choirboys, and the two of them have been completely tamed by pretty young women. They were in no hurry about it, either\u2014I\u2019m glad I lived long enough to see it. Patrick is young and I\u2019ve heard the same woman\u2019s name mentioned more than twice, but I wonder about Colin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou might want to write that one off, Mom,\u201d Aiden said. \u201cAnother grunt in a Blackhawk\u2014it would take a real special woman to domesticate him. He\u2019s pretty rough around the edges.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore than Luke?\u201d she asked, one brow lifted.</p><p>\u201cYou must have lit a million candles for Luke to run into Shelby. She\u2019s one of a kind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you, Aiden?\u201d she asked pointedly.</p><p>He sat back in his chair and took a breath. \u201cI\u2019m facing an interesting transition myself, Mom, and it has everything to do with women. You know I\u2019m not avoiding commitment, but I\u2019m ripe for transfer and the navy needs general medical officers on shipboard and I\u2019m not inclined to spend two years on a big, gray boat, away from my specialty. And I\u2019m not likely to find the right woman at sea. If they don\u2019t come through with a fellowship, I might have to look at my options.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t retire,\u201d she pointed out.</p><p>\u201cCorrect, it\u2019s too soon. I can separate, however.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd do what?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cMedicine, obviously. Ob-gyn, of course. Maybe I\u2019ll do it as a civilian.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere, Aiden?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cI have no idea,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m just thinking about it at this stage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd there are no special ladies in your life now?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He leaned toward her. \u201cNo, Mother. Unfortunately. Now I believe we\u2019ve covered almost everyone. Almost. There\u2019s you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe?\u201d she asked, startled, a slight flush moving up her neck. She could feel the heat rising to her face and damned her redhead\u2019s complexion.</p><p>\u201cYou. Luke mentioned the oddest thing to me. You apparently gave some perfectly nice, interested man the slip by claiming to be recently widowed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, that,\u201d she said with a laugh, waving the subject off. \u201cThat was the Presbyterian minister\u2019s friend, briefly in town for a visit. I ran into him again and apologized for that. He was gracious, as I expected he would be. It\u2019s forgotten. But what concern is it of Luke\u2019s?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not just Luke\u2019s concern, Mom. I guess because you\u2019re always so busy, none of us even entertained the idea you weren\u2019t socializing with men at all, that you were deliberately avoiding them. Speaking for myself, I assumed you had a date now and then. By the time Da had been gone a few years, I prepared myself for you to find a man you wanted to marry\u2014you were so young when we lost him. But what you said to Luke stirred the pot. It sounds as though you have no interest in even the most casual friendships with the opposite sex. Tell me what that\u2019s about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be so ridiculous!\u201d she said, fuming slightly. \u201cI\u2019m not talking to my son about that!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAny why not? You pry every sliver of information about women from each one of us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you hardly throw me a bone!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because the kind of information available on that subject, until Luke and Sean were recently captured, is not intended for a mother\u2019s ears. You said it yourself\u2014at least a couple of your boys were the playboys of the Western world. Details of their dating experiences would have had you gripping your heart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI knew it was bad,\u201d she said, shaking her head. \u201cAs if they were hiding anything from me. Sometimes I wonder who raised them!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut that\u2019s all old news. How about you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you refuse to date at all? Have you made some decision you\u2019ll never again meet a man? More to the point, have you decided not to even give the idea a chance?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you hear yourself?\u201d Maureen asked. \u201cWhy in the world does that matter to you? Or to Luke, for that matter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Sean, and even Patrick. Only Colin is dense enough to have no interest in anyone\u2019s love life but his own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me you\u2019re making that up!\u201d she said, aghast. \u201cYou are not talking about my possible love life!\u201d</p><p>Aiden leaned across the breakfast bar, toward her. \u201cMother, you are a very attractive woman in your early sixties. You\u2019re sharp and energetic and, as far as I know, in excellent health. And if anyone would know, I would\u2014you pass the details of every doctor\u2019s appointment and blood test you have by me as I\u2019m your official second opinion.\u201d</p><p>She made a face. \u201cI listened to enough of your whining as you tried to pass your exams to have earned that right, haven\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never once complained,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m glad I know exactly what your cholesterol level and blood pressure are\u2014someone in the family should. I\u2019m committed to doing anything I can to support you living a full and happy life until you\u2019re extremely old. But, Mother, you\u2019re too young and vital to give up a normal heterosexual existence. You can still fully enjoy that part of life.\u201d</p><p>She blanched. \u201cYou did not just say that to your mother,\u201d she said in a whisper.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a woman\u2019s doctor. I say it to lots of women in their fifties and sixties. And seventies, just in case you\u2019re curious. In fact, in a clinical situation, I\u2019m much more direct, and I hope your doctor is, as well. Now, let\u2019s just retrench to the original question. Have you made some ridiculous and arbitrary decision that you won\u2019t even entertain the idea of dating?\u201d</p><p>Right at that critical moment, the door to Luke\u2019s house burst open and Rosie came flying in, red curls bouncing wildly. \u201cGramma,\u201d she yelled, running to Maureen and throwing herself onto her lap. \u201cWe go fishing now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have fishing on the brain,\u201d Maureen said. \u201cI thought you\u2019d like to bake pies with me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cFishing!\u201d she said, squeezing Maureen around the neck.</p><p>\u201cAll right, all right. First, I want you to meet your uncle Aiden.\u201d She turned Rosie on her lap. \u201cRosie, this is Aiden. And Aiden, this is Rose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWide Iwish Rose,\u201d she said with a grin.</p><p>Aiden laughed and stretched a hand out to her. \u201cSo I\u2019ve heard. Nice to meet you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFishing now!\u201d she said. Sean came into the house. \u201cDaddy! We go fishing now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get it over with, short stuff. It\u2019s all I\u2019ve heard since I told her we were coming to Luke\u2019s for the day. Of course, her idea of fishing is tossing bread into the river for the trout. We\u2019re years away from hooking anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll save some dough rolling for after you\u2019ve had your fishing trip, Rosie,\u201d Maureen said. She eased Rosie off her lap and rummaged in a cupboard for some of Luke\u2019s bread, handing Rosie a few slices. \u201cRemember, you only go near the river with Mommy or Daddy.\u201d</p><p>Aiden said he would go along and, while he fetched his jacket, Sean and Rosie were out the door and on their way. Aiden shrugged into his coat and said to Maureen, \u201cWe can continue this conversation later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so,\u201d she said. \u201cYou boys gossip worse than a bunch of old women and I think it\u2019s high time you mind your own bloody business.\u201d</p><p>He leaned toward her and kissed her cheek. \u201cYeah, good luck with that.\u201d</p><p>Sixteen</p><p>Thanksgiving had a special significance for John Middleton, known as Preacher to his friends. His mother passed away around this time when he was only seventeen, and for so many years after that, when the holidays approached, he just endeavored to get through them as best he could. He was always relieved when the whole season was over. But once he found Virgin River and his wife, Paige, everything in his life changed, and he looked forward to the holidays with excitement and spirit. He had a great deal to be thankful for.</p><p>Every Thanksgiving Preacher prepared a big turkey dinner and kept the bar open for anyone who wasn\u2019t otherwise occupied. It became the tradition at Jack\u2019s Bar to serve a big dinner free of charge to friends and any strangers who might wander in. Preacher could have used his new house to accommodate his Thanksgiving guests, but it just wouldn\u2019t be the same. Plus he liked the idea of being open to strangers who found themselves traveling or stranded on this very important day.</p><p>Mel Sheridan and Dr. Michaels were trading off holidays this year. Since Cameron and his wife had the new twins, they wanted to take a few days for family at Christmastime, so Mel and Jack were going to the Sheridan family home in Sacramento for Thanksgiving. But there would be no shortage of guests for Preacher\u2019s biggest dinner of the year.</p><p>He and Paige pushed the tables together in the bar into one long, wide table. Paige dressed up the table with a horn of plenty filled with gourds and colorful leaves. As well, orange candles provided soft lighting up and down the table. Each place setting had a construction-paper turkey created by her and her son, Christopher. When Preacher looked at the long table, he smiled and said, \u201cYou sure do class the place up, babe.\u201d</p><p>At four o\u2019clock the turkey came out of the oven to sit for a half hour before carving. The side dishes were ready and the hors d\u2019oeuvres were on the bar. A cabernet was breathing, a chardonnay was chilled, juice and sodas were cold for the kids and abstemious, the water glasses were all filled, coffee was ready to perk. Preacher looked around the room, puffing up a little in pride. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The first to arrive were Rick and Liz, helping Rick\u2019s grandmother, Lydie, into the bar. Next came Connie and Ron of the corner store and, for the first time, Connie\u2019s sister, Liz\u2019s mother. Joy and Bruce, good friends from down the street, arrived and, right behind them, Hope McCrea. Not long after, Cameron and Abby with babies, Julia and Justin, and enough baby gear to open a nursery. Preacher held on to his own little daughter, Dana Marie, and chuckled as he realized they basically had opened a nursery.</p><p>He beamed when the door opened again and Dan Brady and Cheryl came in. He\u2019d hoped they would come, but he had no way of knowing if Cheryl was comfortable among them. It had taken her some time after adjusting to her newfound sobriety to get used to the idea that Virgin River folks didn\u2019t look down on her at all. The fact of the matter, Preacher knew, was that everyone was real proud of her.</p><p>Paige and Preacher passed around the hors d\u2019oeuvres and drinks and, after about twenty minutes of visiting, there was a mad scurrying among the women to put out all the side dishes, settle small children in high chairs and find places for everyone to sit. Then and only then did Preacher bring out the noble bird on a large tray, surrounded by baked apples and parsley. He put it in front of his place at the head of the table and took in all the oohs and ahhs as he prepared to carve.</p> <p>Right at that moment the door to the bar opened and a man stood in the entrance. His hair was too long and he looked a little on the worn side, his jacket collar frayed. \u201cOh, sorry. I thought you were open.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome in, come in,\u201d Preacher said. \u201cYou\u2019re just in time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no,\u201d he said, shaking his head. \u201cI can see you\u2019re having a holiday dinner. And I have the family in the car. We\u2019re headed back to my in-laws in Trinity County and the car was sputtering, so we decided to stop for a while. But I\u2019ll take a look under the hood and we\u2019ll push on.\u201d</p><p>Dan Brady was on his feet. \u201cTell the family to come in, brother. Join us for a meal and then we\u2019ll have a look at the car. At least we\u2019ll send you off in good working order.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI, ah...We have some sandwiches in the car for the kids\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt would be our pleasure to have you and your family join us. Please. No one pays for a meal or drink, or even for car repair, on a special holiday like this one. This is a family day,\u201d Preacher said. \u201cCome in and meet everyone. Join us. We\u2019d be honored.\u201d</p><p>At the Riordan household, Luke had purchased a couple of long folding tables and foldable chairs for their Thanksgiving dinner. With Art\u2019s help, he rearranged the furniture to make room so the women could set up their dinner table.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not very good at this sort of thing,\u201d Shelby told her mother-in-law.</p><p>\u201cWhat nonsense! You\u2019ve stuffed the bird and he\u2019s roasting beautifully! You\u2019ve done a fantastic job so far.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy uncle Walt talked me through it\u2014he\u2019s a great cook. We don\u2019t have enough dishes, so my cousin Vanni is bringing some of her mother\u2019s, along with some table linens. It isn\u2019t going to be fancy\u2014all mismatched plates and flatware and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDarling,\u201d Maureen said, putting a hand on her arm to still her. \u201cI can\u2019t think of a thing you could do to make it more perfect.\u201d</p> <p>Shelby smiled and leaned toward her to whisper, \u201cI can think of one thing. You have to let Luke make his announcement, but I\u2019ll give you a tip. We\u2019re going to give Rosie a cousin.\u201d</p><p>Maureen pulled her into an embrace. \u201cCongratulations, sweetheart. When are you due?\u201d</p><p>Shelby shrugged. \u201cThe height of next summer, just as Luke planned.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re feeling well?\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, I feel like crap. Oops,\u201d she apologized. \u201cI mean, I\u2019m kind of tired and have some morning sickness and, according to Luke, I\u2019m not in the best mood. I might want to have a little consult with my brother-in-law after dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood idea,\u201d Maureen said. \u201cMaybe he\u2019ll have a suggestion or two. Now, let\u2019s get this house ready for the company!\u201d</p><p>The first to arrive were Sean, Franci, Rosie and Vivian. Viv jumped right into the kitchen work with Maureen, while Rosie checked with everyone present to see if anyone was going fishing!</p><p>Next came Paul and Vanni with their little ones and a couple of boxes of additional dishes, linens and flatware. Right behind them were Walt and Muriel. Walt\u2019s son, Tom Booth, and his girlfriend, Brenda, were having dinner with Brenda\u2019s family but planned to arrive for dessert. The kitchen was full of women, talking and laughing, with the general trying to edge his way into direct traffic.</p> <p>The house was full of people when Art quietly asked Luke how long it would be before dinner. When he was told it would be at least an hour\u2014right around four o\u2019clock\u2014he slipped away and walked to his little cabin next door to grab his rod and reel. Art loved people, but large crowds stuffed into a small house made him a little jittery. All those little children! Art thought himself a little clumsy sometimes; he was afraid he might step on one of them!</p><p>Recently, Luke had given him a very nice watch for his birthday, and when Luke told him a time to be somewhere or do something, Art was exactly on time. He loved his watch! He did just as the Riordan brothers did\u2014he\u2019d check his watch and mark the time in his head. He never forgot. In his fantasy life, he was a Riordan brother. Brave and handsome and courageous.</p><p>Down at the river\u2019s edge Art walked upstream to his favorite spot where the river was shallow and most narrow. There were some flat rocks he could step on to get out into the middle of the stream and, from there, he would cast. Casting was still a little new to him and learning it hadn\u2019t been easy, but Luke had been patient and never made him feel stupid. Of all the things he loved about Luke, his favorite thing was that Luke always treated him like a man.</p><p>He stepped on the flat rocks\u2014one, two, three\u2014very slowly and cautiously. If he didn\u2019t go too quickly, not a drop of water would wet the tops of his tennis shoes. He went easy and lightly so as not to slip. Luke said he might get waders for Christmas and he was so excited about that.</p><p>Art stood almost in the middle of the river and threw his fly into the deeper part, reeling in slowly. If he caught a fish, they would put it in Luke\u2019s freezer for another day. Today was turkey day.</p><p>Contentment always washed over Art while he fished. Not only did it relax him, but when he pulled in a fish and gave it to Luke and Shelby, he felt as if he was contributing to the family. They ate fish for dinner about twice a week\u2014almost always fish that Art had caught. Out of the corner of his eye Art caught a glimpse of something red. He turned and saw Rosie standing right at the water\u2019s edge. She had a fistful of bread and she was tearing off pieces, tossing them in the water, watching to see if the fish would come close to her. Her feet were wet and she didn\u2019t even have a coat on!</p><p>Just then, she threw some more bread in the water and she lost her balance!</p><p>\u201cRosie!\u201d Art yelled.</p><p>She righted herself, standing in water over her ankles.</p><p>\u201cRosie, you\u2019re not supposed to be here all by yourself!\u201d he yelled.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fishing,\u201d she said, completely ignoring Art\u2019s concern. She threw more bread and slipped again.</p><p>She was standing near a deep pool! It wasn\u2019t too deep for Art, but she was so little! If she fell in, she could drown! The current that ran near the shoreline wouldn\u2019t pull someone as big as Art downstream, but little Rosie might be helpless!</p><p>\u201cYou stay right there!\u201d he yelled.</p><p>He dropped his rod right in the water, giving no thought to it, focused only on Rosie. He took two quick, giant steps, but on the third step he slipped on a large flat rock and the sole of his shoe slid off. He teetered and fell forward. He put out his hands, but there was too much momentum\u2014he fell face-first in the shallow end of the river, hit his head on a rock and lay facedown in the river.</p><p>As the turkey came out of the oven ready for carving and Walt insisted on making the gravy, Franci went looking for Rosie\u2014it was time to clean up and get her hands washed. She\u2019d seen her just a second ago on the floor with Mattie and Hannah, Vanni\u2019s children, but right now she was nowhere in sight. She checked the bathroom and Shelby\u2019s bedroom, but she wasn\u2019t there. Franci looked up the staircase\u2014would she have gone upstairs?</p><p>Franci ran up and peeked into the two bedrooms, but no Rosie. Running back downstairs she wondered if the little imp was hiding. \u201cSean,\u201d Franci called. \u201cWhere\u2019s Rosie?\u201d</p><p>Sean looked around. \u201cBathroom?\u201d he suggested.</p><p>Franci shook her head. Then she glanced into the kitchen. There, on the countertop, was a loaf of bread. But the plastic bag was open. No adult in this house would have left it like that; it was too close to dinner to be making sandwiches. She gasped and her heart fell with a thud.</p><p>\u201cThe river!\u201d she yelled into the living room full of people. \u201cOh, God, she took bread to the river!\u201d</p><p>Sean bolted out the door, Franci on his heels, both of them frantically running for the river. Franci could hear Rosie crying and she picked up speed. The river was close; she saw her little girl standing at its edge, clutching her sliced bread. Sean got to her first. He scooped her up instantly. \u201cSean!\u201d Franci yelled, pointing at Art, facedown in the water.</p><p>There was the sound of running behind them\u2014others had followed the alarm and several people came pounding down the trail.</p><p>Sean put Rosie back on her feet at the edge of the water and ran to Art. He was barely there before Luke and Aiden waded up to their knees in the icy water, pulling Art to the bank. They rolled him over and Aiden immediately straddled Art\u2019s waist and began pressing upward on his chest. \u201cSomeone call rescue\u2014we\u2019ll need emergency transport,\u201d he said, pressing on Art\u2019s chest. A bubble of river water rolled out. \u201cAnd blankets. Lots of blankets!\u201d</p><p>There was a flurry of activity as Rosie was taken back to the house by Maureen, while others ran to use the phone and to hunt for towels and blankets. Aiden pulled himself off Art\u2019s midsection to kneel beside him and begin mouth-to-mouth.</p><p>Franci knelt on Art\u2019s other side. \u201cI can spell you,\u201d she said to Aiden.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m good,\u201d he said, pushing another breath into the big man. \u201cCome on, Art!\u201d</p><p>As if performing on command, Art coughed and spewed water into the air. He coughed again; he wheezed and gasped. Aiden and Franci together rolled him onto his side and, after a great deal of coughing and choking, he threw up a lot of river water. While Art struggled to sit up, Luke was shaking out a blanket and wrapping it around his shoulders.</p><p>\u201cThere we go,\u201d Aiden said. \u201cTake slow breaths if you can, Art. Cough it out.\u201d</p><p>Art had a terrified look on his face and a big lump on his head. He had a hard time catching his breath enough to speak and was clearly panicked. Finally, in a voice he could barely use, looking around frantically, he said, \u201cRosie? Did she fall in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, buddy. You did. But you\u2019re going to be all right, I think.\u201d</p><p>That didn\u2019t seem to satisfy him. \u201cWhere\u2019s Rosie? Where is she?\u201d</p><p>Luke knelt in front of Art and pulled the blanket around him, holding it tight. \u201cHer grandma took her up to the house where it\u2019s warm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLuke,\u201d he said, his voice raspy. \u201cI stepped too fast and didn\u2019t look.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAn accident, buddy,\u201d Luke said. \u201cWere you trying to get to Rosie?\u201d</p><p>He nodded and coughed. \u201cShe\u2019s not supposed to fish without Sean. Did she fall in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s okay. You were a close call, though. You scared me good, Art.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry, L-L-Luke,\u201d he said, teeth chattering.</p><p>The wet blanket was pulled away and a dry one wrapped around him. When he\u2019d recovered enough to be breathing somewhat better, Luke and Sean made a chair out of their arms and carried him to the house so he could sit by the fire. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI called Cameron,\u201d Walt said. \u201cOnce you had him breathing and sitting up, I canceled the helicopter transport. Cameron will be here faster, in less than five minutes. Luke, you can drive the Hummer for him so he can be in the back with Art.\u201d Then the general leaned close to Art. \u201cArt, you\u2019re going to go to the hospital so they can check you over, make sure you didn\u2019t get a concussion or get too much water in your lungs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to,\u201d Art wheezed.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go with you, buddy,\u201d Luke said. \u201cRight now I\u2019m going next door to your house to find you some dry clothes.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cO-k-k-kay,\u201d he said. Maureen came close, holding Rosie, who was still gasping with barely subsiding sobs. Art looked up at her. He frowned at her. \u201cNo f-f-fishing without Sean,\u201d he said in a bit of a scolding tone.</p><p>She turned and buried her head in Maureen\u2019s shoulder for a second, then looked back at Art and asked, \u201cDo I hab time-out?\u201d Her breath caught pitifully and tears streamed down her cheeks.</p><p>\u201cNo time-out,\u201d Art said. \u201cAnd no more fishing without Sean!\u201d</p><p>She nodded her head and clung to her grandmother.</p><p>The front door opened and Cameron stuck his head inside. \u201cDid I hear someone\u2019s been swimming in this cold weather?\u201d</p> <p>By seven that evening at Valley Hospital, Art had had a clean CT and good chest X-ray. The danger of developing pneumonia from nearly drowning was the risk, so Cameron wanted him to stay at the hospital overnight, on antibiotics for infection and breathing treatments to keep his lungs clear.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to spend the night,\u201d Art said, his voice still gruff from the strain of coughing and choking.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll stay here with you,\u201d Luke said.</p><p>\u201cBut I want Thanksgiving, Luke!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll make sure\u2014\u201d</p><p>Shelby popped her head in the room. She carried a covered tray. \u201cNow, Art, would I let you miss Thanksgiving?\u201d she asked. \u201cDon\u2019t I know you like to eat better than anything?\u201d</p> <p>He grinned at her and she came into the room. She put the tray on his bedside stand. \u201cI drove it over on a hot-water bottle, but if it\u2019s not warm enough, the nurses might let us borrow their microwave.\u201d She pulled the aluminum foil off the dishes. \u201cOh, I think you\u2019re going to like this!\u201d</p><p>He dipped a fork in the mashed potatoes first and grinned. \u201cIt\u2019s good. Are you going to spend the night, too?\u201d he asked her.</p><p>\u201cProbably not,\u201d she said with a laugh. \u201cIf Luke is here with you, I can stretch out at home and have the whole bed.\u201d She leaned forward and gave Art a kiss on the head. \u201cBe more careful,\u201d she said. \u201cI can\u2019t stand the thought you might be hurt!\u201d</p><p>Art glowed scarlet from the kiss.</p><p>\u201cKnock, knock,\u201d someone said from the door. Sean came into the room with Rosie on his hip. \u201cSome Wide Iwish Rose can\u2019t go to sleep tonight without seeing you. She\u2019s never been in a hospital before.\u201d</p><p>Right behind them Franci entered the room, saying, \u201cAnd we brought...\u201d Her voice trailed off as she saw Art with a generous Thanksgiving meal in front of him. \u201cPie.\u201d Within five minutes, Rosie was sitting on the bed beside Art, helping him eat his dinner, which he didn\u2019t seem to mind sharing with her.</p><p>Then Walt Booth\u2019s voice boomed from the hospital room doorway. \u201cAw, hell, I thought this was an original idea!\u201d He brought in his own collection of leftovers and behind him Muriel laughed, holding a large serving of pie.</p><p>Next came Paul with still more pie. \u201cVanni sent this over,\u201d he said.</p> <p>And right behind him, Preacher. \u201cHeard there was a little excitement at the Riordan Thanksgiving dinner,\u201d he said, bearing a couple of take-out cartons from the bar.</p><p>And, finally, Aiden and Maureen crowded into the small room. \u201cI guess it\u2019s a good thing we didn\u2019t bring food,\u201d she said. \u201cWe just wanted to check on you and make sure you had company, Art. But look at this\u2014you have so many friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have very many friends,\u201d Art said. \u201cVery many.\u201d</p><p>The day after Thanksgiving was bright and sunny, though very cold. Maureen told Vivian she had errands to run, but would be back in plenty of time to help with dinner at Franci\u2019s house. Tonight Shelby, Luke, Art and Aiden were all coming over for a family dinner before they scattered to the winds in a great exodus out of Virgin River and Eureka.</p><p>Maureen drove to Ferndale and back to the cemetery. She saw George\u2019s car parked by the side of the road and pulled up behind it. He was halfway up the hill, apparently reading a headstone. She walked up the winding stone stairs till she met him.</p><p>He turned and opened his arms and she walked right into his embrace. \u201cDo you think it\u2019s a bad omen to meet in a cemetery?\u201d she asked him.</p><p>\u201cI have a special fondness for this place,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is exactly where you completely lost control, threw yourself at me and passionately kissed me. I like it here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I surprised myself more than you,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cImpossible. I thought I\u2019d have to chase you for years before I got a kiss.\u201d He stroked her hair back over her ear. \u201cAre you ready to go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs ready as I\u2019ll ever be. You?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d rather not,\u201d he admitted. \u201cBut I have responsibilities. The upside is, I\u2019m going to get those things taken care of quickly so I can get the next part of my life under way. I\u2019m looking forward to this next stage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019ll be back here for Christmas?\u201d Maureen asked.</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t I promise you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose I can trust you to keep a promise,\u201d she said. Then she wrapped her arms around him and hugged him tight. \u201cAre you still planning to leave tomorrow?\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cI\u2019ll drive for a day and have Sunday to get myself organized before classes. I think I might drum up the hardest end-of-term exams in the history of the world. I want to be remembered for something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGeorge, you\u2019ll be remembered. Who could forget you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHopefully not you!\u201d He kissed her forehead. \u201cWill you please give me a call when you get home? Just so I know you\u2019re safe?\u201d They had spent one of their lunches plugging numbers into each other\u2019s iPhones. She had numbers for him on his cell phone, at the university and at home.</p><p>\u201cOf course. Once I get rid of Aiden.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be grumpy,\u201d he said, giving her a squeeze. \u201cYou\u2019ll have a very pleasant drive with him. It\u2019s nice of him to look after his mother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not being nice, George, he\u2019s being over protective and nosy. He\u2019s got this idea we have to have a heart-to-heart talk about the fact I haven\u2019t been dating! He brought it up, you know\u2014apparently, my sons have been concerned about me being alone. More to the point, they\u2019re all concerned that I\u2019m determined to be alone!\u201d</p><p>\u201cShame on you, Maureen! Tell the young man you\u2019re not going to be alone!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo! It\u2019s none of his bloody business!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re just being stubborn. If he\u2019s worried, it might put his mind at ease.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not ready to talk to Aiden about you. Besides, once you tell one of those boys, they\u2019ll all know. They\u2019re worse gossips than a bunch of girls. Nothing is sacred with them. No way I\u2019m confessing to any one of them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCould be a very long drive,\u201d George observed.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d counted on driving alone. I like to drive. And I had looked forward to being alone with my thoughts. I have a lot on my mind, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d he said with a laugh. \u201cPlus, you need time to check in with your priest, see if you can trick him into giving you a blessing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like your opinion about something,\u201d she said, smiling slyly. \u201cI mean, I do realize your education in the religious arts is spotty compared to a Catholic priest\u2019s...\u201d</p><p>\u201cIndeed?\u201d he said with laughter in his voice.</p><p>\u201cBut do you suppose, at my advanced age, God would trust me to make my own decision about you?\u201d</p><p>He threw back his head and laughed. \u201cMaureen, have you ever heard the story about the Lutheran who went to heaven?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe I have...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, let\u2019s see if I remember it correctly. As I recall he wasn\u2019t a real bad sinner, as Lutherans go, and made it to heaven based on his good works. Saint Peter was giving him a little tour. They walked through magnificent gardens, past glorious mansions, beside breathtaking waterfalls and rainbows. There was a group of people in a fabulous park and Saint Peter said, \u2018Those are the Baptists\u2014no dancing or card playing over there.\u2019 They walked farther and passed what appeared to be a big celebration, a roaring party, and Saint Peter said, \u2018Methodists. Anything goes.\u2019 And a little farther along there was a gathering of folks visiting, chatting and laughing, having a good time, and Saint Peter said, \u2018Shhh, be very quiet.\u2019 When the Lutheran asked why, Saint Peter said, \u2018Those are the Catholics. They think they\u2019re alone up here.\u2019\u201d</p><p>She laughed and gave him a playful slap on the arm.</p><p>George grew serious. \u201cMaureen, you have to follow your heart. You\u2019re a good woman and God loves you.\u201d He smiled almost shyly. \u201cAnd, I think, so do I.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s going to be a long month before I see you again,\u201d she said wistfully.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll miss Rosie, won\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDreadfully. And you\u2019ll miss Noah and Ellie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the children. Even though I\u2019m not Noah\u2019s father, I feel like one\u2014I\u2019ve never seen him happier. It\u2019s not so hard to be away from him, knowing how much he loves life right now. But it will be hard to be away from you.\u201d He kissed her deeply, lovingly. \u201cTravel carefully, sweetheart. Don\u2019t be too hard on Aiden.\u201d</p><p>During the month of December, Maureen was kept busy getting ready for a very special Christmas. While she shopped for gifts for Rosie and a new Riordan baby, gender still unknown, she kept thinking, This is what Christmas is all about\u2014children! She talked to Rosie on the telephone a couple of times a week and made plans with her, getting her all wound up and excited. \u201cWhen I come to California, we will shop together and go look at Christmas lights,\u201d she had told her granddaughter. \u201cI\u2019ll help you buy presents for your mommy and daddy, if you like. And we can bake Christmas cookies together for the whole family.\u201d</p><p>Maureen had talked to Sean; he was spending approximately four days a week\u2014just three nights\u2014at Beale. He had enough long weekends in Eureka with Franci and Rosie for it to almost seem as though he wasn\u2019t gone at all. He was scheduled to have the Christmas holidays off. And, he reported to his mother, Franci was now wearing his engagement ring, wedding plans to follow soon. She couldn\u2019t have worked that out better herself.</p><p>She heard from Colin and Paddy\u2014they were going to make it to Virgin River for at least a few days over Christmas. Colin was coming from Fort Benning, Georgia and Paddy from Virginia.</p><p>She talked to George on the phone, too, even more often than to anyone in her family, and he had new ideas for big travel plans on a daily basis. According to George, Noah and Ellie and the kids had managed to make enough progress on their new old house to move into it in time for Christmas. George, however, was planning to use the guest room over the Fitches\u2019 garage that Ellie had just vacated. \u201cI\u2019m sure I\u2019ll be spending most of my time with Noah and the family, and with you when I can wrestle you away from your granddaughter, but according to Noah his house still has a long way to go and they don\u2019t have a place to put me except on a lumpy sofa.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen will you arrive in Virgin River?\u201d she asked him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m coming early. As soon as I\u2019m done at school, I\u2019ll head down to Virgin River. Noah can probably use my help with the house. And, Maureen, I\u2019ve put my house on the market.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you!\u201d she exclaimed. \u201cYou\u2019re really doing it, then!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m really doing it. Check your e-mail\u2014I\u2019ve sent you pictures of RVs! And when we see each other, I\u2019ll show you brochures from my recent shopping trip.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut you haven\u2019t made a commitment yet, have you?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cNot until the house sells. And I want to finish up the next semester. And, of course, your opinion matters to me. After all that, anchors aweigh!\u201d</p><p>Since Christmas Eve would fall on a Friday Maureen was planning to arrive in Virgin River on the Saturday before. She had agreed to meet Aiden in Sacramento and drive with him the rest of the way. She decided that, on this visit, she would stay with Luke. Because it was a holiday week the cabins were not all full. It hadn\u2019t taken too much arguing to convince Luke that a couple of his brothers could stay with him in the house and Maureen could have her own space in one of the cabins.</p><p>When Maureen had driven home from California right after Thanksgiving with Aiden, he had returned to the subject of her refusal to date. She assured him nothing could be further from the facts\u2014that if she met someone she liked, she\u2019d most certainly keep company with him. Then she\u2019d said the subject was closed!</p><p>The trip from Sacramento back to Virgin River was going to be much more interesting.</p> <p>When she arrived in Sacramento, her son was waiting. He\u2019d gotten there first, taken care of the car rental and was waiting for her in the baggage area at the airport. Once they were under way and zooming north, traffic rather sparse, she said, \u201cI have a couple of things to tell you, Aiden.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShoot,\u201d he said, giving her a glance and a smile.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m thinking of selling my condo. I might put it on the market after Christmas. I\u2019d divvy up all the furniture and keepsakes I\u2019ve been polishing, dusting and storing for over forty years, of course. Is there anything in particular you\u2019d like to have?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait, wait, wait,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re getting rid of everything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot everything,\u201d she corrected. \u201cBut definitely the furniture that came from Illinois, the crystal and china that was left by my mother and your father\u2019s mother, and absolutely all the things from your childhoods that I\u2019ve kept safe. I think it\u2019s time you boys take charge of your own fifth-grade report cards and prom pictures.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see,\u201d he said warily. \u201cAnd what are you going to sit on? Sleep on?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s a rather long story, but the short version is that I haven\u2019t refused to date at all. In fact, I\u2019ve had quite a few dates with a gentleman friend I met in Virgin River. George Davenport\u2014that nice friend of Pastor Kincaid\u2019s who Luke accused me of brushing off.\u201d</p><p>Aiden was quiet for a moment. \u201cAre you getting married or something?\u201d he asked cautiously.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She laughed. \u201cThat would be premature. I\u2019ve only known him for a short time. Although I\u2019ve talked to him every day since before Thanksgiving, and we had several long lunches when we were both in California.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, let\u2019s back up a little bit. You didn\u2019t brush him off, after all, and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, but I did! I was rude, in fact, and I apologized, and we had lunch and began to get to know each other. And I found out I actually liked him. He\u2019s very nice. We have a lot in common, it turns out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019re thinking of selling your condo,\u201d Aiden said. \u201cWhat are you planning to do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTravel,\u201d she said. \u201cWe got to talking about how spread out our families are. He has a couple of grown, married stepsons who have children\u2014children who consider him their grandfather. And my sons are all over the country. Sean and Luke might be more or less in the same place right now, but that\u2019s temporary. And with Rosie and a baby on the way...But that\u2019s only part of it\u2014getting around to see all the grandchildren. There are so many things I\u2019ve never seen\u2014from the Grand Canyon to Yellowstone! I\u2019m not getting any younger, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re planning to travel with this George? This man I\u2019ve met once?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI plan to introduce him to everyone over the Christmas holiday,\u201d she answered calmly. \u201cHe\u2019ll be in Virgin River, visiting Noah\u2019s family, and all you boys will be around to meet him again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow nice, Mother,\u201d Aiden said sarcastically. \u201cYou\u2019re going to introduce him, and then you\u2019re going to take off with him? To see the sights? This man we don\u2019t know at all and you barely know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease, don\u2019t be ridiculous.\u201d She laughed. \u201cI thought maybe Sean or Luke might overreact, but I thought you, who lectured me about the part of my life that\u2019s not over, would remain calm and curious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right\u2014here\u2019s calm and curious. You\u2019re planning to introduce us to this man and then go traveling with him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot exactly. We\u2019ve only known each other for a little while. What I\u2019m going to do is continue to get to know him. I\u2019ll visit him in Seattle and he\u2019ll visit me in Phoenix and we\u2019ll meet in Virgin River a time or two. He\u2019s a professor, you know, and he\u2019s finishing out the term. We also e-mail and talk on the phone. If, at the end of the term in June, we haven\u2019t changed our minds, then we\u2019ll do some traveling together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see,\u201d Aiden said calmly. \u201cThen you\u2019re getting married?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t exactly know,\u201d she answered. \u201cIt\u2019s something to think about, but really, Aiden, I don\u2019t feel in a big hurry to make that kind of commitment right now. However, I do think he has a point\u2014we\u2019re getting a little too old to put off doing the things we\u2019ve always wanted to do\u2014like travel. And there are practical considerations\u2014like Social Security benefits, pensions, that sort of thing. I\u2019d have to give it a lot of serious thought.\u201d Then she shrugged. \u201cI might not have made up my mind about that by June. I might want to test the waters a bit. You know? See if our rapport is as good when we spend a great deal of time together. As good as the visits, phone calls and e-mails.\u201d</p><p>Aiden\u2019s face was getting red. \u201cSo, you\u2019re going to sell your condo, give away your furniture and go traveling? And if it doesn\u2019t work out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose I\u2019ll have to say, sorry, it didn\u2019t work out. And then I\u2019ll find an apartment or small house near one of you boys. I\u2019m trying to stay flexible. I\u2019ve gotten a little tired of being such a stick-in-the-mud.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see. You\u2019re going to spend your life savings on plane tickets? Hotel rooms?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Aiden,\u201d she said with a laugh. \u201cGeorge is buying a nice, new RV. He\u2019s been looking around, sending me pictures of the various models. He\u2019s bringing brochures to Virgin River. These new RVs? They\u2019re every bit as big and modern as the condo I\u2019m living in!\u201d</p><p>\u201cMother! Have you lost your mind?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, actually, once I started thinking about this adventure, I decided I\u2019d lost my mind by closing myself off so much. I\u2019ve just been marking time for the past twelve years. I stay very busy, you know, but there hasn\u2019t been much excitement in my life. I haven\u2019t really looked forward to much. You boys are wonderful about visiting when you can, but it hasn\u2019t exactly escaped my notice that you each have a three-day limit. I haven\u2019t been as excited as this in years!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what to say, Mother. This is sudden, it\u2019s a little crazy, and\u2014\u201d</p><p>She looked at her watch. \u201cWe have four hours for you to get right with the idea. I\u2019m not the only one who will have six months to find out everything about George I want to know\u2014so do you and your brothers. I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll be more than happy to answer any of your questions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat.\u201d Aiden sulked.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a reason I wanted to talk to you first, Aiden. You\u2019ve always been the voice of reason in our family. I think you get that from my father\u2014he was like that. So, we\u2019re about to have one of the best holidays ever! Our first with Rosie, a new baby coming in the summer, Luke married, Sean engaged, all my boys together. I\u2019m not going to have that ruined with a lot of high drama from a bunch of overprotective pups who can\u2019t be bothered to spend more than a long weekend with me, anyway. I\u2019m ready for some company! I\u2019m ready for some fun! Get to know George to your heart\u2019s content, ask anything you like, but I\u2019m hoping you can keep your brothers from going off the deep end.\u201d She reached over and touched his shoulder as he drove. \u201cI\u2019m counting on you, Aiden.\u201d</p><p>He grumbled something. And grumbled and grumbled.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that, sweetheart?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cI said, you\u2019ve gone from the nun wannabe prude who wouldn\u2019t have a date in twelve years to a crazy woman who plans to take off in a Winnebago with an old man none of us knows and live in sin, and all he has to recommend him is that he\u2019s the friend of some Presbyterian minister! And you expect me to sell this idea to my brothers?\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t help it, she burst into laughter. \u201cNun wannabe prude? I guess I\u2019ll have to live with that, though it sounds pathetic. And George isn\u2019t just a friend of a minister, Aiden. As it turns out, he\u2019s an ordained minister, as well. Presbyterian.\u201d</p><p>Aiden checked his rearview mirror, turned on his signal and pulled onto the freeway\u2019s shoulder. He put the car in Park and turned toward Maureen. He looked at her for a long moment. And then he said, \u201cWho are you and what have you done with my mother?\u201d</p><p>Sean arrived at Franci\u2019s house on December 23 at about ten in the evening. He had called at four, said he was finishing up his out-processing at Beale Air Force Base and would be on his way as soon as possible. The front door was unlocked when he arrived and he walked in, tossing his packed duffel on the floor just inside the door.</p><p>In seconds, she was in his arms. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d she asked him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m okay,\u201d he said. \u201cI got everything done. I don\u2019t have to go back to Beale at all. On January 15 I leave for Iraq out of San Francisco. But we\u2019re so lucky, Fran\u2014a six-month deployment, then a year at Air Command and Staff College. It could\u2019ve sucked way worse than this. Have you told anyone?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head.</p><p>\u201cNot even Rosie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe should do that together.\u201d</p><p>Sean got his orders a week ago and the first person he told was Franci. He would go to Iraq to fly a U-2 on a UN peacekeeping surveillance mission. He\u2019d relieve one of the aircraft commanders who had been there since July. Then, his alternate position for the Air Force Air Command and Staff College had been upgraded and he\u2019d have a year in residence in Alabama\u2014a very hard slot to get. All things considered, it was a gift. He could\u2019ve been sent to Iraq for a year; he could\u2019ve lost that ACSC slot altogether. He almost felt as if he was stealing.</p><p>\u201cThe movers came, put everything from my house in storage,\u201d Sean said. \u201cThe Realtor has instructions to try to sell it, and if after ninety days passes with no sale, the property management division of her company will rent it. There\u2019s nothing for you to do. Except, have you thought about\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said, nodding. \u201cLet\u2019s get married before you go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want it to be sad,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not sad\u2014it\u2019ll be the happiest day of my life. But if you don\u2019t have time to plan a pretty wedding...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI bought a dress,\u201d she said, smiling broadly. \u201cI bought a dress, made a list, called that minister in Virgin River and swore him to secrecy. Tomorrow at breakfast we\u2019ll tell Rosie about your orders, about our wedding.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re sure? I\u2019m not suggesting this because I\u2019m afraid something will happen. Nothing will happen\u2014I\u2019m going to be flying one of the safest, most protected aircraft in that part of the world. But if I step in front of a jeep and get myself killed, I want the air force to take care of you and Rosie.\u201d</p><p>She rubbed her fingers along the dark blond hair at his temple. \u201cI\u2019m not worried about anything happening to you. I\u2019m not afraid. I just want to be your wife.\u201d She grinned. \u201cI want the piece of paper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy mother will be ecstatic,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cYour mother is turning the family upside down,\u201d she told him. \u201cI can\u2019t wait to fill you in. All your brothers are here and she has plans that they\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I already know,\u201d he said. \u201cAiden called and filled me in. We\u2019re under strict orders not to screw up Saint Maureen\u2019s Christmas with Rosie by acting out about her new plans. Besides, I don\u2019t want to talk about my mother or my brothers tonight,\u201d he said, pulling her against him. \u201cI want to go kiss Rosie, make sure she\u2019s sound asleep and then get you alone. All alone, with the door closed.\u201d</p><p>Colin and Patrick arrived in Virgin River on the twenty-third and did a little grumbling about Maureen\u2019s proposed adventure, even suggesting once or twice that she\u2019d officially lost her mind completely. But early on the twenty-fourth George paid his first visit to Luke\u2019s house, and it didn\u2019t take them long to begin joking about this nutty idea, this idea that no one was going to take with complete seriousness until certain things happened\u2014like the sale of the condo, the purchase of an RV, the solidification of these crazy plans. The quick acceptance of George came not so much because of George\u2019s natural wit and charm, but because Maureen was so different when he was around. He gentled her; her smile was almost girlish, and the Enforcer had turned into a woman in love. After a couple of hours of general comradery, Colin shook George\u2019s hand and said, \u201cMy man, we should have hired you years ago to soften up the old girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI heard that,\u201d Maureen said from the kitchen.</p><p>The next day when everyone was milling around in Luke\u2019s house Rosie burst through the door, coat open and curls flying. She looked around at all the people, hunting for her grandmother. When she spotted her in the kitchen, she squealed and ran to her. \u201cGramma Moween! Mommy and Daddy is habbing a wedding! And then Daddy\u2019s going to Iwack! It\u2019s bery important!\u201d</p> <p>Dead silence hung in the air. The men in the living room all slowly stood.</p><p>Maureen smoothed Rosie\u2019s curls. \u201cIs that right?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cUh-huh. And before he goes to Iwack, we\u2019re getting us a cawendar and I will make a X on ebry day till he comes home. He\u2019s going in his plane\u2014\u2019member his plane? The big plane? It\u2019s a bery important job!\u201d She stopped talking for a moment and looked around at the room full of people. Softly, she asked her grandmother, \u201cIs that the uncles?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey are,\u201d Maureen said. \u201cAnd very anxious to meet you.\u201d She laughed softly. \u201cYou always enter a room with flair, Rosie, I\u2019ll give you that.\u201d</p><p>The door opened and Franci preceded Sean into the house. They took in the still, silent crowd, Rosie with her arms locked around Maureen\u2019s neck. Sean smiled. \u201cWell, I guess you got the news,\u201d he said. He hooked an arm around Franci\u2019s shoulders. \u201cHaving a daughter like Rosie is better than a town crier. If you can stick around a few extra days, there\u2019s going to be a wedding.\u201d</p><p>On December 27 there was a notice on the door of the bar that said that Jack\u2019s would be closed at 5:00 p.m. for a private party. Paige and Preacher worked all day to prepare a wonderful prime-rib dinner with all the trimmings. Preacher worked his art on a beautiful, two-tiered white wedding cake. Maureen and Shelby were at the bar promptly at five, putting out centerpieces they\u2019d made themselves\u2014pine boughs strung with holly and white roses. The Riordan brothers made a special run into the valley for wine and champagne to add to the bar stock, while Ellie and Noah Baldwin showed up with rolls of wide, silver ribbon, white paper doves and strands of small twinkling lights to decorate the bar and buffet table. The bar was transformed for a wedding reception.</p> <p>At a little before 7:00 p.m. people started to gather around outside the bar, bundled up in their finest outdoor suits, coats and capes. By the time Jack turned on the Christmas tree lights at exactly seven, there were sixty people holding small lit candles.</p><p>With precision timing, Noah took his place in front of Virgin River\u2019s very special tree\u2014decorated in red, white, blue and gold, adorned with military unit patches. He had his Bible in hand, standing before a formidable group of Riordans, friends and neighbors. George held Maureen\u2019s hand and Vivian looped her arm through Carl\u2019s. For this unusual wedding there were no chairs; the ceremony wouldn\u2019t be long and the setting was perfect. They made a wide semicircle around the tree, about five rows deep.</p><p>First out of the bar doors came Shelby and Luke; Luke wore his wedding suit while Shelby was decked out in a lovely new mauve-colored knee-length coat with black fur trim and black boots. She carried a bouquet of holly and white roses. Next came the bride and groom and flower girl. Franci wore a beautiful full-length white coat with white fur collar and cuffs and a matching fur hat that completely covered her super short hair; she carried a slightly larger bouquet of holly and roses. On her feet were white high-heeled boots. Rosie had a matching short coat and little white boots. Sean was resplendent in his air force dress blues, complete with hat.</p><p>Holding hands with Rose, the bride and groom walked down from the porch, over to the front of the magnificent tree, and stood between Shelby and Luke. They bent, one at a time, to put a little kiss on Rosie\u2019s cheeks before she was moved to the side to stand with her aunt Shelby. And that left Sean and Franci facing each other, holding each other\u2019s hands in front of a tree that was decorated to pay homage to the men and women who were in service to their country.</p><p>Right on cue, a light snow began to fall, the flakes glittering down to the ground in candlelight.</p><p>Noah said, \u201cDearly Beloved, we are gathered here together to join a very special man, woman and child in holy matrimony....\u201d </p> </body></html>"]
