His mother was brushing her hair, lovely dark ringlets spun with threads of the purest gold. She perched in front of the vanity, humming softly but excitedly, her smiling, freckled image reflected in an oval mirror. He couldn\u2019t help but watch her, fascinated.</p><p>Cornelia was one of the most beautiful creatures ever created. Everyone always said so. Her eyes were the palest violet, edged by lashes the same brown-and-gold mix as her hair. Her lips were heart-shaped, and her pale skin glowed as brightly as the sun.</p><p>With Koldo\u2019s inky hair, dark eyes and deeply bronzed skin, he looked nothing like her. The only thing they had in common was their wings, and perhaps that was why he was so proud of the glittering white feathers cushioned by plush, amber down. They were his one redeeming feature.</p> <p>Her humming suddenly ceased.</p><p>Koldo gulped.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re staring at me,\u201d she snapped, all hint of her smile gone.</p><p>He cast his gaze to the floor, as she preferred. \u201cSorry, Momma.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you not to call me that.\u201d She slammed the brush onto the marble counter. \u201cAre you so foolish that you\u2019ve already forgotten?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d he replied softly. Everyone lauded her sweetness and gentleness as much as her beauty, and they were right to do so. She was generous with her praise and kind to everyone who approached her\u2014everyone but Koldo. He\u2019d always experienced a very different side of her. No matter what he did or said, she found fault. And yet, still he loved her with all of his heart. He\u2019d only ever wanted to please her.</p><p>\u201cHideous little creature,\u201d she mumbled as she stood, the scent of jasmine and honeysuckle drifting from her. The purple fabric of her robe danced at her ankles, the jewels sewn into the hem sparkling in the light. \u201cJust like your father.\u201d</p><p>Koldo had never met his father, had only ever heard about the man.</p><p>Evil.</p><p>Disgusting.</p><p>Repulsive.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m having friends over,\u201d she said, flicking her hair over one shoulder. \u201cYou\u2019re to stay up here. Do you understand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Oh, yes. He understood. If anyone caught sight of him, she would be embarrassed by his ugliness. She would rage. He would suffer.</p><p>She peered at him for a long while. Finally she growled, \u201cI should have drowned you in the bathtub when you were too young to fight back,\u201d and stomped from the room, the door slamming shut behind her.</p><p>The rejection cut bone deep, and he wasn\u2019t sure why. She\u2019d said far worse countless times before.</p><p>Just love me, Momma. Please.</p><p>Maybe...maybe she couldn\u2019t. Not yet. Hope unfurled in his chest, and he raised his chin. Maybe he hadn\u2019t done enough to prove himself. Maybe if he did something special for her, she would finally realize he was nothing like his father. Maybe if he cleaned her room...and had a bouquet of fresh flowers waiting for her...and sang a song as she drifted to sleep... Yes! She would hug and kiss him in thanks, the way she often hugged and kissed the servants\u2019 children.</p><p>Excited, Koldo folded the blankets he used for his pallet on the floor and jumped to his feet. He darted through the room, picking up the discarded robes and sandals, then fluffed the pillows strewn around the center rug, where Cornelia liked to relax and read.</p><p>He ignored the wall of weapons\u2014the whip, the daggers and the swords\u2014and straightened the items on the vanity: the brush, the bottles of perfume, the creams for his mother\u2019s skin and the pungent-smelling liquid she liked to drink. He polished every necklace, bracelet and ring in her jewelry box.</p> <p>By the time he finished, the room and everything in it glistened as though brand-new. He grinned, pleased with his efforts. She would appreciate all that he\u2019d done\u2014he just knew it.</p><p>Now for the flowers.</p><p>Cornelia wanted him to stay here, and had he promised to obey her, he would have. But he hadn\u2019t promised. He\u2019d told her only that he understood her desires. Besides, this was for her, all for her, and no one would see him. He would make sure of it.</p><p>He strode to the balcony, pushed open the double doors. Cool night air wafted over him. The palace was situated in a far realm of the lower heavens, neighbored by thousands of stars twinkling from an infinite expanse of black velvet. The moon was bright and high, a mere sliver curved into two upward points.</p><p>The moon was smiling at him.</p><p>Encouraged, Koldo stepped to the balcony\u2019s ledge. There was no railing, allowing his toes to curl over the side. He flared his wings to their full length, the action bringing a cascade of joy. He loved flying through the sky, soaring up and zipping down, rolling through the clouds, chasing birds.</p><p>His mother knew nothing of this. \u201cYou are never to use your wings,\u201d she\u2019d announced the day they\u2019d begun to sprout from his back. He\u2019d planned to heed the command, he had, but then, one day, she\u2019d been screaming about how much she despised him, and he\u2019d climbed to the roof so that she wouldn\u2019t have to gaze upon his ugly face. His misery had distracted him and he\u2019d fallen down, down, dooown.</p><p>Just before landing, he\u2019d flared the previously unused appendages and managed to slow his momentum. He\u2019d crawled away with a shattered arm and leg, broken ribs, a punctured lung and a fractured ankle. Eventually, he\u2019d healed\u2014and he\u2019d next jumped on purpose. He\u2019d been addicted to the feel of the breeze on his skin, in his hair, and had craved more.</p><p>Now, in the present, he dived headfirst. The air slapped at him, and he had to swallow his whoop of satisfaction. The freedom...the slight edge of danger...the rush of warmth and strength... He would never get enough. Just before impact, he straightened and leveled out, his wings catching the current. He landed softly, his feet already in motion.</p><p>One step, two, three, annnd he was a mile into the forest. Not because he was fast\u2014though he was\u2014but because he could do something his mother and the other Sent Ones he\u2019d seen could not. He could move from one place to another with only a thought.</p><p>He\u2019d discovered the ability a few months ago. At first, he\u2019d only been able to whisk a yard, then two, but every day he managed to go a little farther than before. All he had to do was calm his emotions and concentrate.</p><p>At last he reached the stretch of wildflowers he\u2019d found the last time he\u2019d broken the rules and left the palace. He plucked the prettiest from the ground, the petals the perfect shade of lavender, reminding him of his mother\u2019s eyes. He brought them to his nose, sniffed. The mouthwatering aroma of coconut clung to him, and his grin returned.</p><p>If Cornelia asked where he\u2019d gotten the bouquet, well, he would tell her the truth. He refused to lie, even to save himself from a punishment. Not only because other Sent Ones could taste when another being lied\u2014unlike him\u2014but also because lies were the language of the demons, and demons were almost as evil as his father.</p><p>His mother would appreciate Koldo\u2019s honesty. Surely.</p><p>Hands full of moist green stalks, he sprinted out of the forest and leaped into the atmosphere, going higher and higher, his feathers ruffling in the wind, the muscles in his back straining in the most delightful way. Up and down his wings glided. His heart thundered in his chest as he landed on the balcony and peeked through the doorway. There was no sign of his mother.</p><p>Breathing a sigh of relief, he entered the room. He emptied Cornelia\u2019s favorite vase of old, dried flowers, then added the new and watered the stems. He returned to his place in the corner, folded his legs and waited.</p><p>Hours passed.</p><p>More hours passed.</p><p>By the time the hinges squeaked to signal the door was being opened, his eyelids were heavy, his eyes as dry and scratchy as sandpaper, but he\u2019d managed to stay awake and now jolted to eager attention.</p><p>A soft fall of footsteps. A pause.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you do?\u201d his mother gasped. She spun, taking in every inch of the bedroom.</p><p>\u201cI made it better for you.\u201d Love me. Please.</p><p>A sharp inhalation of breath before she stomped over, stopping just in front of him and glaring down with fiery hatred. \u201cHow dare you! I liked my things the way they were.\u201d</p><p>Disappointment nearly crushed him, so heavily did it settle in his chest. Once again he\u2019d failed her. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere did you get the ambrosia?\u201d Even as she spoke, her gaze jerked to the double doors leading to the balcony. \u201cYou flew, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Only a beat of hesitation before he admitted, \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>At first, she gave no reaction. Then she squared her shoulders, an action of determination. \u201cYou think you can disobey me and never suffer any consequences. Is that it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I just\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cLiar!\u201d she shouted. Her palm smacked against his cheek, the force of the impact propelling him into the wall. \u201cYou\u2019re just like your father, doing what you want, when you want, no matter how anyone else feels about the matter, and I\u2019m not going to tolerate this behavior anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he repeated, trembling.</p><p>\u201cBelieve me, you will be.\u201d She grabbed his arm and hauled him to his feet. He didn\u2019t struggle, allowing her to toss him onto the bed, on his stomach, and tie his wrists and ankles to the posts.</p><p>Another whipping, he thought, not allowing himself to beg for mercy she wouldn\u2019t show. He would hurt, but he would heal. He knew that for a fact. He\u2019d earned a thousand other punishments just like this one, but he\u2019d always recovered. Physically, at least. Inside, his heart would bleed for years to come.</p><p>His mother selected a blade from the wall, ignoring the whip she normally wielded.</p><p>She was going to...kill him?</p><p>Finally Koldo tugged and twisted, but he wasn\u2019t strong enough to fight his way free. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m really sorry. I\u2019ll never again clean your room, I promise. I\u2019ll never again leave it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think that\u2019s the problem? Oh, you foolish boy. The truth is, I can\u2019t let you loose. You\u2019re tainted by your father\u2019s vile blood.\u201d The fire in her eyes had spread to the rest of her features, creating a wild, crazed expression. \u201cI\u2019ll be doing the world a favor by limiting your ability to travel.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>No. No! \u201cDon\u2019t, Momma. Please, don\u2019t.\u201d He couldn\u2019t lose his wings. He just couldn\u2019t. He would rather die. \u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you not to call me by that wretched name!\u201d she screeched.</p><p>Panic caused little crystals of ice to form in his blood. \u201cI\u2019ll never do it again, I promise. Just...please, don\u2019t do this. Please.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI must.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can take my legs. Just take my legs!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd make you dependent on me the rest of your life? No.\u201d A slow grin lifted the corners of her lips. \u201cI should have done this a long time ago.\u201d</p><p>A second later, she struck.</p><p>Koldo screamed and screamed and screamed...until his voice broke and his strength drained. Until he saw his beautiful wings on the floor, the feathers now soaked in his blood.</p> <p>Until he could only close his eyes and pray for death.</p><p>\u201cThere, now. Hush. It\u2019s done,\u201d she said almost gently. \u201cYou lost what you did not deserve.\u201d</p><p>This was a dream, surely. His mother was not so cruel. No one could be so cruel.</p><p>Soft, warm lips pressed into his tearstained cheek, and the jasmine and honeysuckle of her scent overshadowed what remained of the coconut. \u201cI\u2019ll hate you forever, Koldo,\u201d she whispered into his ear. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing you can do to change that.\u201d</p><p>No, not a dream. Reality.</p><p>His new reality.</p> <p>His mother was far worse than cruel.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to change it,\u201d he said, his chin quivering. Not anymore.</p><p>A tinkling laugh escaped her. \u201cIs that anger I hear? Well, well. You\u2019re already more like your father than I knew. Perhaps it\u2019s time you met him.\u201d After a moment\u2019s pause, she added, \u201cYes, in the morning, I\u2019ll take you to your father\u2019s people. You\u2019ll realize just how good I\u2019ve been to you\u2014if you survive.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER ONE</p><p>In a world of darkness, the smallest light is a beacon.</p><p>Present Day</p><p>KOLDO STALKED DOWN the ICU ward of the hospital. He and the warrior with him were hidden from human eyes and protected from human touch. The doctors, nurses, visitors and patients misted through them, completely unaware of the invisible world playing out alongside theirs. A spirit world that had given birth to this natural world, the human world.</p><p>A spirit world that was the true reality for all creation.</p> <p>One day, these humans would discover just how exact that statement really was. Their bodies would die, their spirits would rise\u2014or descend\u2014and they would begin to understand the natural world was fleeting, the spiritual eternal.</p><p>Eternal. Just like Koldo\u2019s irritation seemed to be. He didn\u2019t want to be here among the humans, on yet another silly mission, and he really didn\u2019t like his companion, Axel. But his new leader, Zacharel, wanted him busy, distracted, for he suspected Koldo teetered on the verge of breaking a heavenly law.</p><p>Zacharel wasn\u2019t wrong.</p><p>After everything Koldo had endured in his father\u2019s camp...after escaping and spending centuries searching for his mother, Koldo had finally found her\u2014and locked her inside a cage in one of his many homes.</p><p>So, yes. Koldo teetered. But he wouldn\u2019t ever cause the woman irrevocable harm. He wouldn\u2019t even lower himself to break one of her nails. For now, he simply hoped to teach her the horror of being trapped by circumstance, as she had taught him. As she was still teaching him.</p><p>Later, he would... He wasn\u2019t sure. He no longer liked to consider the future.</p><p>Because of his abhorrence of Cornelia, Koldo had landed in the Army of Disgrace. It was a terrible name for such a choice defensive force, but it was one that fit nonetheless. The members were the worst of the worst, the baddest of the bad...male and female Sent Ones who were in danger of damnation.</p><p>For various reasons, all twenty soldiers had ignored prized heavenly laws. They were meant to love, but they hated. They were to help others, but they really only hurt. They were to build up, but they only ever tore down.</p><p>Three months ago, the members had been given one year to mend their wicked ways, or they would be stripped of their abilities and kicked into hell.</p><p>Koldo would do whatever was necessary to keep that from happening\u2014even deny himself true vengeance. He refused to lose the only home he\u2019d ever known.</p><p>Axel grabbed him by the arm, stopping him. \u201cDude! Did you see the meat bags on that girl?\u201d</p><p>And there was reason number one why Koldo had a problem working with Axel. \u201cCould you be any more disgusting?\u201d He jerked from the warrior\u2019s hold, contact with another not something he enjoyed.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Axel said with an irreverent grin. \u201cI could. But someone, and I won\u2019t say your name, K, my man, needs to get his mind out of the gutter. I wasn\u2019t talking about her chesticles.\u201d</p><p>Koldo ran his tongue over his teeth. \u201cWhat, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHello. Her demons. Look.\u201d</p><p>His gaze slid to the room at his right. The door had been in the process of closing and now clicked shut, blocking the occupant from view. \u201cToo late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s only too late when you\u2019re dead. Come on. You gotta see this.\u201d Axel strode forward and ghosted through the entrance.</p><p>Koldo\u2019s hands curled into fists, and he battled the urge to punch a wall. They had a mission, and distractions only extended their time in a place crawling with demons laughing at the pain the humans suffered and whispering into the ears of anyone who would listen.</p><p>Can\u2019t survive, they said. There\u2019s no hope. And these humans...so many were puppets, with clawed hands tugging at their strings. If they failed to fight back, they would become casualties in a war between good and evil, either in this life or after death. One way or another.</p><p>That\u2019s just the way things worked.</p><p>The Most High ruled the heavens. \u201cHe\u201d was actually a sacred trinity consisting of the Merciful One, the Anointed One and the Mighty One, and He was the King of kings, His word law. He had appointed several underlings throughout the skies. Germanus\u2014or Deity, as some of Koldo\u2019s kind called him, referring to a title, nothing more\u2014was one of those underlings. A king answerable to the King.</p><p>Germanus led the Elite Seven\u2014Zacharel, Lysander, Andrian, Gabek, Shalilah, Luanne, Svana\u2014and each of those seven led an army of Sent Ones. Zacharel, for instance, led the Army of Disgrace.</p><p>Sent Ones looked just like angels, but they weren\u2019t actually angels. Not in the sense the world knew, at least. Yes, Sent Ones were winged. Yes, they waged war against evil and helped humans, but in actuality, they were the adopted children of the Most High, their lives tethered to His. He was the source of their power, the essence of their very existence.</p><p>Like humans, Sent Ones battled the desires of the flesh. They experienced lust, greed, envy, rage, pride, hate, despair. Angels, in actuality, were servants and messengers of the Most High. They experienced none of those things.</p><p>Mind on the mission.</p><p>Koldo straightened his spine. Zacharel had tasked him and Axel with killing a specific demon here at the hospital. The demon had made the mistake of tormenting a patient who knew about the spiritual world around him, a male who had called upon the aid of the Most High.</p><p>The Most High was love personified, willing to help anyone who asked. Sometimes angels were dispatched, sometimes Sent Ones. Sometimes both, depending on the situation and the skills needed. This time, Koldo and Axel had been chosen. They had been nearby, headed to a training session, when Zacharel\u2019s voice had whispered through their minds, imparting instructions.</p><p>Axel peeked his head through the center of the door and said, \u201cDude! You\u2019re missing it!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe person in that room is not our\u2014\u201d</p><p>Grinning, the warrior once again disappeared.</p><p>\u201cAssignment,\u201d Koldo finished to no one but himself. His anger intensified.</p><p>Control yourself.</p><p>He could move on and fight the demon he was supposed to fight, no problem, but according to Zacharel\u2019s orders, he wasn\u2019t to proceed without his partner.</p><p>Grinding his teeth, he marched forward. He slipped through the iron obstruction without any difficulty, stopped and glanced around. The room was small, with multiple machines attached to the motionless blonde female on the bed. A redheaded female sat next to her, chatting easily.</p><p>The redhead had no idea there were two demons standing behind her, pretending not to see the Sent Ones in the room.</p><p>\u201cTwo of the guys in my office got to arguing about who could run faster,\u201d she said, \u201cand soon bets were flying.\u201d</p><p>Her voice had a whispery quality, as if filled with smoke and dreams, and it settled over Koldo like warm honey. And yet, with the soothing came a tensing. Every muscle in his body knotted up, as if preparing for war. He...wanted to fight such a delicate human? But why? Who was she?</p><p>\u201cI felt as if I was standing in the middle of a stock exchange or something.\u201d</p><p>Laughter bubbled from her, such beautiful laughter, pure, with nothing held back. The kind he\u2019d never experienced himself.</p><p>\u201cThey decided to race in the parking lot instead of have lunch, and the loser had to eat whatever\u2019s in the plastic bowl in the break room fridge. The one that\u2019s been in there for over a month and is now black. I heard the cheers as I was pulling out of the lot, but I didn\u2019t get to see who won.\u201d</p><p>Wistful now. Why?</p><p>\u201cYou would have voted for Blaine, I\u2019m sure. He\u2019s only five-nine, so he wouldn\u2019t tower over you too badly, and he has the cutest blue eyes. Not that his looks have anything to do with his speed, but I know you, and I know you would have wanted him to win regardless. You\u2019ve always been a sucker for baby blues.\u201d</p><p>He could only see the top half of her, but judging by the fragility of her bone structure, she was a tiny thing. Her features were plain, her skin as pale as porcelain, and her eyes as gray as a winter storm. Her mass of strawberry hair was pulled into a high ponytail, the ends curling all the way to her elbow.</p><p>There was an air of fatigue surrounding her, and yet, there was a sparkle in those winter eyes.</p><p>A sparkle the demons behind her would soon snuff out. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He forced his attention on the pair. One was posted at her left and one was posted at her right, and both had a proprietary hand on her shoulder. They were Koldo\u2019s size, with dark, pupilless eyes that reminded him of bottomless pits. Lefty had a single horn protruding from the center of his forehead, and crimson scales rather than flesh. Righty had two thick horns rising from his scalp, and dark, matted fur.</p><p>There were many different types of demons, and they came in all different shapes and sizes. From the first of their kind, the fallen archangel Lucifer, to the viha, the paura, the n\u00e1sil\u00ed, the slecht, the grzech, the pic\u0103 and the envexa. And sadly, many more. Each sought the destruction of mankind\u2014one man at a time, if necessary.</p><p>Amid the types of demons, there were ranks. Righty was a top-of-the-line paura, and all about fear. Lefty was a top-of-the-line grzech, and all about sickness.</p> <p>Demons liked to attach themselves to humans and, through whispers and deceit, infect them with a toxin that caused their anxiety levels to spike, in the case of the paura, and the immune system to weaken, in the case of the grzech. Then, the demons fed off the ensuing panic and upset, weakening the humans further and making them easy targets for destruction.</p><p>The girl must have been a veritable buffet.</p><p>Just how sick was she?</p><p>Lefty gave up trying to ignore Axel and glared at him as he danced around, slapping his face and saying, \u201cI\u2019m hittin\u2019 you, I\u2019m hittin\u2019 you, what\u2019re you gonna do about it, huh, huh?\u201d in the good-ole-country-boy accent he sometimes liked to use.</p><p>Koldo despised demons with every ounce of his being. No matter their type or rank, they were thieves, killers and slayers, just like his father\u2019s people. They left chaos and confusion in their wake. They ruined. And this pair wouldn\u2019t leave the girl unless forced\u2014but even then she could welcome others.</p> <p>His chest burned as he switched his focus to the girl on the bed. But...his gaze lasered through the wrinkled cover, the thin hospital gown, and even skin and muscle. What he saw astonished him.</p><p>To him, the blonde was now as transparent as glass, granting him a glance at the demon that had wormed its way inside her body. A grzech, different from the one plaguing the redhead. This one had tentacles that stretched through the blonde\u2019s mind and into her heart, draining the life from her.</p><p>The Most High often blessed Sent Ones with specific supernatural abilities during difficult situations, things like this X-ray vision, as he\u2019d heard others call it. Until now, Koldo had never experienced anything like it. Why here? Why now? Why this girl and not the other?</p><p>The questions were overshadowed a second later, when, in the blink of an eye, Koldo learned exactly how this had happened to her, the information seeming to download straight into his brain.</p><p>Born at twenty-six weeks, the blonde and her redheaded twin had struggled to survive the heart defects they\u2019d been born with. Multiple surgeries were needed, and both almost died countless times\u2014each time nullifying any progress made. Throughout the years, their parents had become fond of saying, \u201cYou have to keep yourself calm or you\u2019ll have another heart attack.\u201d</p><p>Innocent words meant to aid the pair\u2014or so it seemed.</p> <p>Words were one of the most powerful forces known\u2014or unknown\u2014to man. The Most High had created this world with His words. And humans, who had been fashioned in His image, could direct the entire course of their lives with their words, their mouths as the rudder on a ship, as the bridle on a horse. They produced with their words. They destroyed with their words.</p><p>Eventually the blonde had come to believe the slightest rise in her emotions would indeed cause another painful heart attack, and with her belief, fear had sparked to life.</p><p>Fear\u2014the beginning of doom, for heavenly law stated that what a person feared would come upon them. In the blonde\u2019s case, the fear had come upon her in the form of the grzech. She\u2019d caught his notice, and she\u2019d been such an easy target.</p><p>First, the demon breathed his toxin into her ear, whispering destructive suggestions.</p><p>Your heart could stop at any moment.</p><p>Oh, the pain...it\u2019s unbearable. You can\u2019t live through that again.</p><p>This time, the doctors may not be able to revive you.</p><p>Demons knew human eyes and ears were a doorway to the mind, and the mind was a doorway to the spirit. So, when the blonde had entertained the terrible suggestions, constantly rolling them through her mind, the fear had multiplied and become a poisoned truth, causing her defenses to crumble, allowing the demon to slink inside her, create a stronghold and destroy her from the inside out.</p> <p>She had indeed had another heart attack, and the necessary organ had weakened beyond what human medicine could repair.</p><p>Did the Most High want Koldo to help her, even though she wasn\u2019t his current mission? Was that what this unveiling was about?</p><p>Sighing, the redhead leaned back in her chair, returning Koldo\u2019s attention to her. Once again, he saw flesh and blood rather than spirit. The Most High\u2019s gift hadn\u2019t extended to her.</p><p>He didn\u2019t have time to wonder why. A waft of cinnamon and vanilla hit him, quickly followed by the sickening scent of sulfur. A scent the girl would not be able to shed, as long as the demons stayed with her.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s about time for me to go,\u201d she said, rubbing at the back of her neck as if the muscles were knotted. \u201cI\u2019ll let you know who won that race, La La.\u201d</p><p>Did she have any idea that evil weighed her down and stalked her every move?</p><p>Did she know she was full of demon toxin, just like her sister? That, if she didn\u2019t fight, she would end up in the same circumstance, the demons worming their way inside her body?</p><p>Koldo could kill Lefty and Righty, but again, other demons would sense what easy prey she was and attack her. As unknowledgeable as she clearly was, she would surrender again.</p><p>For any kind of long-term success, he would have to teach her to wage war against the toxin. But to do so, he would need her cooperation and time. Cooperation she may not give. Time she may not have. But...maybe she was the one the Most High wanted him to help. Maybe Koldo was to save the redhead from the blonde\u2019s fate.</p><p>Either way, the choice to aid her\u2014or not\u2014was Koldo\u2019s. Germanus and Zacharel might issue orders, but not the Most High. Not even when He revealed a truth. He never overrode free will.</p><p>\u201cYou want in on this, buddy?\u201d Axel asked him, continuing to slap at the now-snarling demons behind the redhead. \u201c\u2019Cause I\u2019m about to take things up a notch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA notch above annoying is merely irritating,\u201d he said, inwardly fuming because he already knew he was going to pick the mission. Survival always came first.</p><p>Why was he fuming, anyway? He liked the sound of the girl\u2019s voice\u2014so what? Who was she to him? No one. Why should he care about her and her future?</p><p>\u201cWe have a duty,\u201d he added. \u201cLet\u2019s see to it.\u201d</p><p>Immediately guilt attempted to rise. No matter who she was\u2014or wasn\u2019t\u2014he was cold and callous to leave her to such an evil end, wasn\u2019t he? His father would have made the same choice. His mother would have\u2014 He wasn\u2019t sure what she would have done. She still seemed to love everyone but Koldo.</p><p>\u201cAh, come on, hoss,\u201d Axel said. \u201cStop and play, that\u2019s my motto.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou come on,\u201d he called to Axel. \u201cNow!\u201d Before he changed his mind.</p><p>\u201cSure, sure.\u201d Axel worked his way behind the demons and kicked one in the back of the knees. The other twisted swiftly to bat the side of Axel\u2019s head with a meaty fist, sending the warrior propelling through the far wall.</p><p>Koldo stepped in front of his brethren when he returned to the room, preventing him from springing into a full-on attack. \u201cTouch him again and you\u2019ll discover my talent with the sword of fire,\u201d he told the demons.</p><p>Loyalty mattered to Koldo. Deserved or not.</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Axel didn\u2019t sound upset or even winded. He sounded happy. \u201cWhat he said.\u201d</p><p>Koldo threw him a glance, saw that he\u2019d raised his fists and was hopping from one foot to the other. He could not be thousands of years old. He just couldn\u2019t be.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the intruders here,\u201d said the demon that had pretended Axel\u2019s head was a baseball. His voice was as jagged as broken glass. \u201cThe girl is ours.\u201d</p><p>He struggled against the urge to hurt and maim the demons as he reached back, grabbed Axel by the collar of his robe and tossed him through the only door into the hall. \u201cI pray we\u2019ll see each other again,\u201d he told the fiends.</p><p>They hissed as Koldo stalked from the room.</p><p>Axel stood in the middle of the walkway, black hair shagging around a face he loved to claim women saw in their fantasies\u2014because he saw it in his own. His electric blues glared holes in Koldo. \u201cDude! You wrinkled my clothes.\u201d</p><p>They were back to \u201cdude,\u201d rather than \u201choss.\u201d Clearly the warrior had no idea just how volatile Koldo\u2019s emotions were. Every step farther away from the girl darkened his mood. \u201cWhat do you care? We\u2019re to engage in battle, not model the current fashions from the skies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDuh. But a guy\u2019s gotta look his best, no matter the occasion.\u201d An orderly walked by, wheeling a cart piled high with trays of food, snagging Axel\u2019s attention. He followed, tossing back a delighted smile. \u201cI smell pudding!\u201d</p><p>How sublime. I got stuck with the only winged warrior with ADD.</p><p>THE FUN AND GAMES ENDED the moment Koldo and Axel closed in on the targeted demon. The human the creature tormented was restrained to his bed, and drugged, too, if the drool leaking from the side of his mouth was any indication.</p><p>A slecht hovered in the air at his right, whispering vile curse after vile curse.</p><p>\u201cG-go away,\u201d the male managed to gurgle. He could see the demon, but not Axel and Koldo. \u201cLeave me alone!\u201d The more he spoke, the stronger he became...but not yet strong enough.</p><p>You couldn\u2019t slay a dragon if you had not yet learned to slay a bear.</p><p>Axel shocked Koldo by surging forward without a word, his wings shooting from his back. The demon only had time to look toward him and gasp before the warrior unsheathed two double-edged short swords from an air pocket and struck. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The swords were a gift from the Most High and something every Sent One was given. Axel\u2019s wrists crisscrossed to form a very effective scissor, chopping the demon\u2019s head from its body in a single heartbeat of time. The pieces thudded to the floor before evaporating into ash.</p><p>Deep down, Koldo had expected to carry the weight of the battle. This was... This was...</p><p>Not fair.</p> <p>The human sagged against the bed, his head lolling to the side. \u201cGone,\u201d he sighed with relief. \u201cIt\u2019s gone.\u201d He closed his eyes and sank into what was probably his first peaceful sleep in months.</p><p>Axel tossed the black-stained weapons back into the air pocket. \u201cDang, I didn\u2019t mean to do that again.\u201d</p><p>Again? \u201cYou\u2019ve killed so quickly before?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, yeah. Every time before. But once, just once, I\u2019d like to only injure my opponent and get a little thrusting and parrying in before I deliver the deathblow. Well, see ya.\u201d Axel flew through the ceiling, disappearing from view.</p><p>The man was as much a mess as Koldo. No wonder Axel had been given to Zacharel.</p> <p>Just how wildly did he teeter at the edge of falling?</p><p>As close as Koldo?</p><p>Go home.</p><p>Good advice, and miracle of miracles, it sprang from his own mind. He meant to heed it. He did. But a single thought changed his mind. The redhead. He wanted to see her. Muscles tensing all over again, Koldo whisked back to the blonde\u2019s hospital room.</p><p>Only, the redhead was already gone.</p><p>Disappointment hit him first, followed by a new tide of frustration and anger.</p> <p>He whisked to his home hidden in the cliffs along the South African coast. A flash, the action was called. He\u2019d learned a lot about himself and his abilities since being dropped in the middle of his father\u2019s camp all those centuries ago.</p><p>A man will do just about anything to survive, boy. And I\u2019ll prove it to you.</p><p>His father\u2019s words\u2014and yes, Nox had indeed proven them.</p><p>Just like that, the frustration and anger spilled over, and he roared. He beat his fists against the walls, over and over again, soaking his knuckles in crimson, cracking his bones as well as the stone. Every punch was a testament to a centuries-long rage, a soul-deep pain that had never gone away, and a festering wound he knew would never heal.</p><p>He was what he was.</p><p>He was what his parents had made him.</p><p>He\u2019d tried to be more. He\u2019d tried to be better. Each time, he\u2019d failed miserably. Darkness constantly flooded him, banging against an already unstable dam made of tainted memories and corrosive emotions. A dam he was only able to rebuild after outbursts like this one.</p><p>The punching continued until he was panting and dripping in sweat. Until skin and muscles were shredded, and the broken bones exposed. Even still, he could have taken another thousand swings, but he didn\u2019t. He forced himself to exhale with measured precision and imagine a cascade of darkness leaving him.</p> <p>The dam refortified.</p><p>Aches and pains made themselves known, but that was okay. The banging had stopped. For now, that was all that mattered.</p><p>He padded across the living room. Along the way he fisted the collar of the dirty robe and yanked the material over his head. He dropped the garment on the floor, wind and dew whipping around him without any hindrance. He had no doors to block the gales, no windows to silence the song of nature; the entire house was open to the elements. Even better, the ceiling, walls and floor had been formed by the elements, presenting a showcase of glittering dark rock.</p><p>He stopped at the ledge overlooking a magnificent rushing waterfall pounding into the jagged stone below. Heavy sheets of mist rose from a turbulent sea, enveloping his naked body.</p><p>He came here when he desired privacy and peace. The turbulence around him had a way of making his mind seem calmer than it was. The wind kicked up, rattling the beads he\u2019d woven into the length of his beard.</p><p>Once upon a time he\u2019d possessed a head of hair to match. Long, thick and black, intricate beadwork woven throughout the prized strands. Now... He scrubbed a hand over the smoothness of his scalp. Now he was bald, his precious hair sacrificed in favor of vengeance.</p><p>Now he looked like his father.</p><p>Before he could stop it, his mind took him back to one of the many times he\u2019d stood at the bottom of a deep, dark pit, thousands of hissing serp demons slithering over feet that had been flayed like fish...around a neck that had been sliced like Christmas ham.</p><p>Serps were very much like snakes, and they had continually sunk their fangs into him, all over him, dripping venom straight into his veins. But through it all he\u2019d stood utterly still, remaining strong, refusing to so much as groan. His father had promised to remove a finger for every sign of weakness he exhibited. And when he ran out of fingers, he had been told he would lose his hands, his feet...his arms and his legs.</p><p>Back then, he hadn\u2019t yet reached full maturity\u2014hence the reason his wings had not grown back\u2014and he would have been unable to regenerate the limbs. He would have suffered all of his life, and he\u2014</p><p>Beat the ugly memory to the back of his mind, where it belonged. So his father had tortured him for eleven years. So what? He\u2019d been rescued by Sent Ones, and had later become part of an army himself. Not the one he was currently in, but a different one, commanded by the now-deceased Ivar. Back then, Ivar had been the best of the Elite, and being under his command had been an honor.</p><p>Yet, in a fit of temper very much like the one he\u2019d just displayed, Koldo had thrown that opportunity away, besting Ivar in front of his men.</p><p>Regret still haunted him. Such a lack of respect for such an admirable man...</p><p>Koldo had been kicked out of the army and left on his own\u2014for a while. He\u2019d used the time to return to his father\u2019s camp and obliterate everyone and everything.</p><p>The single greatest day of his life.</p><p>He reached up and gripped the rock above him. Now I\u2019m part of this new army, led by a man once known only as Ice. Tomorrow, Zacharel would have another mission for him, one far below his skill level. Koldo knew this, because his leader had sent him out every day for the past three weeks, allowing him no time to break a heavenly law and bring judgment upon his head. At least, supposedly.</p><p>Koldo could lie.</p><p>Koldo could steal.</p><p>Koldo could kill.</p><p>He could do any number of other things their kind was not to do. But he wouldn\u2019t.</p><p>Thankfully, he wouldn\u2019t have to worry about being paired with Axel. Zacharel liked to assign him a new partner for every new mission, probably to keep him off-kilter.</p><p>Sadly, it was working.</p><p>And yet, there was one bright light, he realized. The girl from the hospital in Wichita, Kansas. The redhead. He still wanted to see her.</p><p>Surely she wasn\u2019t as tiny as he seemed to remember. For all he knew, she possessed the long, lithe legs of a dancer. Surely her hair wasn\u2019t the sweet color of strawberries. It had to be fire-engine red or an ordinary dark blond. Surely he\u2019d imagined the purity of her tone. Surely.</p><p>He straightened, anticipation overshadowing all else. He had to know, the desire a living entity inside him.</p><p>First, though, he would have to hunt her down.</p><p>CHAPTER TWO</p><p>KOLDO SPENT THE REST of the night digging through the heavenly archives kept on every human ever to live and learned several interesting tidbits about the blonde and the redhead. The comatose girl was Laila Lane, and the other one, the one he wished to observe, was Nicola Lane. They were twenty-three-year-old twins, with Nicola being older by two minutes, and unmarried.</p><p>So young. Too young.</p><p>The two were identical. The only reason Laila had blond hair was because she\u2019d bleached it, hoping to be \u201cunique.\u201d The girls had no other family, and relied only on each other. Their parents had died in a car accident five years before.</p><p>Koldo left the library and flashed to Laila\u2019s hospital room. Once again Nicola was nowhere to be seen. But he wasn\u2019t worried. According to the gossiping nurses, she came every day. He had only to wait.</p><p>He strode to the edge of the bed. This time, the Most High\u2019s gift was not in operation, so, when he looked, he saw the blonde rather than the demon hiding under her skin.</p><p>The sight was almost as bad.</p><p>Her hair was dry, thin and matted. There were bruises under her eyes, and her lips were chapped. Her skin was severely yellowed, her liver obviously shutting down.</p><p>She wouldn\u2019t last much longer.</p><p>The Water of Life was a powerful liquid capable of repairing the most damaged human flesh, and the only thing capable of saving her. It would also rid her of the demon. But her thoughts, words and actions would influence its continued success.</p><p>The grzech could return to her and try again to poison her. So, even if Koldo fed her the Water, she would have to learn to fight the forces of evil\u2014and then actually fight. Was she willing to engage in any kind of battle?</p><p>Maybe. Maybe not. Either way, Koldo wasn\u2019t willing to suffer and sacrifice, and he would have to do so to even approach the shoreline of the River of Life. First, he would be whipped. Second, he would be forced to give up something precious to him. Last time he\u2019d relinquished his hair. And there was no telling what he would be asked to give up next. His ability to flash? His captive mother?</p><p>Never!</p><p>The practice had not been created by the Most High, and wasn\u2019t even supported by Him. But Germanus refused to end \u201ca tradition that had been with their kind since the beginning,\u201d as a means of proving the depth of their determination. So, once again free will prevailed and the practice continued year by year. Koldo saw no way around it.</p><p>The room\u2019s only door opened suddenly, and Nicola stepped inside. Koldo straightened, and even tensed at the sight of her. He frowned. His body had only ever reacted this way before battle. Why was this happening with her?</p><p>At least she had no idea he was there. He was in the spiritual realm, and she in the natural, so he was blocked from her gaze.</p><p>He looked her over from bottom to top, then back down\u2014far more slowly. That fall of strawberry curls was once again in a ponytail, the thick length tumbling over one shoulder. There were dark circles under her eyes, and the color in her cheeks was high. Her lips were swollen from being chewed. Despite the heat outside, a worn pink sweater draped her shoulders, the lapels pulled tightly together. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She was a tiny fluff of nothing, just as he recalled, her frame heart-wrenchingly delicate. He towered over her, and could easily break her in half with a single twist of his wrist.</p><p>Can\u2019t ever touch her, he told himself.</p><p>For some reason, the tension inside him only increased.</p> <p>The same demons stood sentry behind her, following close at her heels. They spotted Koldo and spewed a mouthful of dark curses.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you hope to gain?\u201d</p><p>He ignored them, and they decided to do the same to him, perhaps hoping he would go away this second time, too.</p><p>\u201cHey, La La,\u201d she said softly. \u201cIt\u2019s Co Co. I\u2019m told you\u2019ve taken a turn for the worse.\u201d</p> <p>The words were encased by a thick, grim shell, yet still her voice stroked over him. A feather tickling. A brush of velvet caressing. He savored the odd sensations, even...liked them?</p><p>Nicola pushed the smallest chair next to the bed, struggling under its weight. The demons snickered at her. Angered, Koldo stepped toward her, intending to help her, but immediately forced himself to still. Now wasn\u2019t the time to reveal himself. He would frighten her.</p><p>The demons caught his aborted action and scowled at him. So much for ignoring him.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not welcome here, Koldo,\u201d Lefty said.</p><p>Responding to a demon invited conversation. Conversation invited lies. Koldo wasn\u2019t so foolish as that. But he wasn\u2019t surprised the creature knew his name. With as many demonic kills as Koldo had made throughout the centuries, the entire underworld knew of him.</p><p>\u201cWe can make you leave,\u201d Righty proclaimed.</p> <p>Fine. He was foolish. He said, \u201cYou can try.\u201d No matter what, they would fail.</p><p>Nicola reached out and gently patted her sister\u2019s hand. \u201cOh, did I tell you? Blaine won the race.\u201d</p><p>The monitors beeped steadily, the comatose girl never moving, never twitching.</p><p>Sighing, Nicola sat back in the chair and began to relay the trials of her workday.</p><p>This time, he would help her, Koldo decided. To start, he would have to do something to ensure she listened to him, and actually acted on what he said.</p><p>That was the only way she would come out of this.</p><p>And perhaps it was his only way out, too. In saving her, he might finally find some sort of atonement.</p><p>Atonement. The word echoed in his mind. It was something he sometimes craved, but not something he deserved. Sometimes, when he closed his eyes, he could still hear the agonized screams he\u2019d caused...could still feel the barb of his victims\u2019 fear.</p> <p>Clenching his fists, he resolved himself. He could do this. And so could she.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to get better, La La,\u201d she suddenly announced, as though drawing hope from his thoughts. \u201cYou have to recover. I won\u2019t allow anything else. I\u2019m the big sister, and you have to do whatever I tell you to do. Nothing else is acceptable.\u201d</p><p>Gaze locked on Koldo, Righty bent down and whispered into her ear. Spreading poison.</p><p>The color drained from her cheeks.</p><p>Lefty squeezed her shoulder, and she slumped forward, as though some of her energy had evaporated in a puff of smoke.</p><p>She stopped talking victory, and went back to discussing her day.</p><p>Koldo rubbed the back of his neck. What had just happened was a prime example of the life she had probably always led, pulling herself up only to be knocked down again.</p><p>Well, no more.</p><p>His body tensed all over again, preparing for war. But this was different than what he\u2019d felt when Nicola had first entered the room. There was no sense of anticipation, no hint of excitement. He just wanted to flat-out raze his enemy into the ground.</p><p>He held out his hand and summoned a sword of fire\u2014another gift every Sent One received from the Most High. One he always had a right to use.</p><p>Righty and Lefty jolted to attention, gnarled wings popping from their backs.</p><p>\u201cYou sure you want to do this?\u201d Righty asked with a gleeful smile. The horns on the creature\u2019s head grew...grew...becoming monstrous ivory towers. Fangs stretched between his lips, extending past his jaw. \u201cYou\u2019ll walk away, but you\u2019ll be in pieces.\u201d</p><p>The same grotesque transformation overtook Lefty, little sparks of fire flashing underneath his scales.</p><p>Koldo didn\u2019t bother with a response. He simply launched forward, blade arcing through the air. The two demons flew apart, moving out of harm\u2019s way. He expected the action and went low as he landed, twisting to the right. Flames slicked over Righty\u2019s thigh.</p><p>The demon grunted from the pain, the scent of burned hair filling the room.</p><p>Koldo jumped up, kicking a leg forward and a leg backward, nailing both of his opponents at the same time. He landed, and they recovered enough to leap at him, punching. He blocked one, but purposely took the other\u2019s abuse, grabbing on to Lefty\u2019s arm and holding tight as he used the appendage as leverage to swing up both of his legs into Righty\u2019s throat with a brutal slam slam of his booted feet. Then he flipped Lefty over and tossed him to his back to stomp on the creature\u2019s face. Bone crunched, suddenly a jigsaw puzzle that needed to be put back together.</p><p>Before the second stomp, Lefty rolled to his feet and bounded on the bed\u2014the females utterly unaware\u2014and, without pausing to consider a wiser way, slammed into Koldo\u2019s back. A long, thick tail wound around his middle, squeezing. The hook on the end sliced all the way to Koldo\u2019s intestines.</p><p>Lefty raised sharpened claws, intending to slash through his windpipe, but Koldo flashed to the other side of the bed. The moment he landed, he leaned forward and grabbed the end of the creature\u2019s tail, jerking and spinning Lefty\u2019s entire body.</p><p>As the fiend careened forward, Koldo flashed behind him and swung his sword. The demon tried to dodge, but wasn\u2019t fast enough. Fire met scales and bone, and scales and bone immediately lost. The demon\u2019s arm detached, spraying black blood over the floor.</p><p>Blood the humans would never see.</p><p>A howl of agony erupted as Lefty grabbed the appendage and flew out the window, into the afternoon sunlight. Unlike Sent Ones, demons couldn\u2019t regenerate limbs. The creature would have to have the arm reattached.</p><p>Deep down, Koldo knew this would not be their last battle.</p><p>Cursing, Righty turned in a half circle, his gnarled wings sweeping in Koldo\u2019s direction. He could have dodged, but he chose to allow the end of one wing to clip his ankles, knocking them together, sending him flying to the floor. The beads in his beard rattled as he hit, air bursting from his lungs. He pretended to lose his hold on the sword, and the weapon vanished.</p><p>Righty dived on top of him, just as he\u2019d wanted, fangs bared. Koldo punched with all of his might, and broke the demon\u2019s nose, sending fragments of cartilage into his rotting brain. Then, Koldo flashed behind him, summoning the sword of fire, swinging. The demon shot forward, staying low. But not low enough. The scent of smoke and sulfur filled the air. A loud thump sounded. One of the creature\u2019s horns was now missing.</p><p>Features contorted with rage, the demon hopped to hoofed feet, black blood leaking down his face, from his busted nose. Roaring, he lunged. Twisting left, twisting right, Koldo stepped into the battle dance. Righty knew when and where to move, sometimes managing to avoid injury. They tangoed from one side of the room to the other, up the walls, down the walls, on the floor, across the ceiling, rolling over the bed, falling through Nicola as she continued to chat with her sister, not so much as a hitch in her breath.</p><p>Koldo released the sword and grabbed a fistful of fur on the demon\u2019s chest. He launched the creature through the far wall. A second later, the fiend raced back into the room.</p><p>\u201cThe girl is mine,\u201d Righty snarled, stalking a circle around him. \u201cMine! I\u2019ll never let her go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were foolish when you decided to follow Lucifer rather than the Most High, and you\u2019re foolish now, to think you can best me. You fight from a place of defeat, and you always will.\u201d Long ago, the Most High had crushed all the forces of hell. But still the creatures struck at humans, determined to hurt those the Most High loved.</p><p>And the Most High loved all humans. He wanted to adopt them, as He\u2019d done the Sent Ones.</p><p>A hiss of rage sounded. \u201cI\u2019ll show you defeat!\u201d Rather than initiating a full-scale attack, the demon backed one step away, two...three. A slow grin lifted the corners of his lips. \u201cYes, I\u2019ll show you defeat. Very, very soon.\u201d With that, he disappeared through the wall.</p><p>Koldo waited, at the ready, but the demon never returned. No doubt, he\u2019d gone to recruit a few of his friends.</p><p>I\u2019ll be ready.</p><p>Only problem was, \u201cvery, very soon\u201d told Koldo nothing. In their realm, one day could be as long as a thousand years and a thousand years as short as one day.</p><p>\u201cWhat the heck is going on?\u201d Nicola exclaimed. \u201cIt\u2019s like two boulders have been lifted from my shoulders.\u201d As she spoke, a smile lit her entire face, transforming her from plain to exquisite. Her pale skin took on a radiant sheen, her eyes becoming the color of summer rather than winter.</p><p>The moisture in his mouth dried.</p><p>\u201cOh, La La. It\u2019s wonderful!\u201d</p><p>Wonderful, yes, but still the toxin flowed through her veins. That would have to be dealt with.</p><p>He would have to find a way to gently reveal himself to her, something he\u2019d never done with a human. He would have to garner her trust, something he\u2019d never before cared to try. But when? How? And how would she react?</p><p>Be as shrewd as a serpent yet as harmless as a dove, Germanus used to tell him.</p><p>Funny, but Koldo was far less assured of his success with the girl than he\u2019d been with the demons.</p><p>CHAPTER THREE</p><p>The next day</p><p>THE ELEVATOR DINGED, and the double doors slid open. Nicola Lane stepped inside the small enclosure, relieved to find she was alone. She was\u2014</p><p>Not alone, she realized with a jolt of surprise. Oh, wow. Okay. In the far corner, a very tall, very muscled man shifted from the shadows. How could she have missed him, even for a second?</p><p>The doors closed, sealing her inside with him. I don\u2019t judge by outward appearance. I really do not judge by outward appearance. But oh, wow, wow, wow, he had to be a time-traveling Viking sent here to abduct modern women to give to his men back home\u2014because they\u2019d killed all the women in their village. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I watch too much TV.</p><p>He certainly gave off an all-dangerous-all-the-time vibe. And now, it was too late to avoid a possible pillaging.</p><p>Her heart fluttered, the warped beat making her light-headed.</p> <p>\u201cFloor?\u201d he asked, his deep voice filled with more jagged edges than a shattered mirror.</p><p>\u201cLobby,\u201d she managed to reply, and he pressed the appropriate button.</p><p>It was a miracle the entire elevator didn\u2019t split apart from the force he used.</p><p>There was an exaggerated shake, and the cart began to descend. The scent of morning sky and\u2014this could have been mere fantasy on her part\u2014rainbows filled the small enclosure, and every waft came from the man. It was, quite possibly, the best cologne she\u2019d ever smelled, and like the ladies in the AXE commercials, she had to battle the urge to lean into him and sniff his neck.</p><p>And wouldn\u2019t he just love that? He would demand to know what the heck she was doing, she would panic and her heart would give out, just as Laila\u2019s had, and...and...she wasn\u2019t going to think about her beautiful, precious Laila right now. She wasn\u2019t going to think about losing another loved one. First her mother, father and br\u2014 No, she wasn\u2019t going to think about that, either. She would break down.</p> <p>And was that delicious heat coming from the Viking, too? For the first time in years, Nicola felt enveloped by warmth, the cold from her medications and poor circulation finally chased away.</p><p>The man turned and leaned against the wall, facing her fully. In that moment, she decided \u201cvery tall, very muscled\u201d wasn\u2019t an adequate description for him. The tallest, most muscled man she\u2019d ever seen in person or on TV worked better, but again, the description failed to capture the essence of his absolute gigantorness. He. Was. Huge.</p><p>And okay, yeah, he was also quite beautiful despite his murdering-and-pillaging aura. He had bronze skin, a gleaming bald head and a black beard tied by three crystal beads. His eyes were a surprising shade of gold, and capped by two thick brows with a prominent arch in the center. He wore a white linen shirt and white linen pants, each garment flowing as fluidly as water. On his feet was a pair of combat boots.</p><p>And she was studying him as if he were a bug under a microscope, she realized, horrified by her behavior. Nicola had often gone to school with electrodes taped to her chest and tubes sticking out of her clothing, so she knew the pain of a single wide-eyed stare. Her attention darted to the glittery pink tennies her twin had given her for their birthday last year.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m quite large, I know,\u201d he said in an accent she couldn\u2019t place. At least he hadn\u2019t sounded offended.</p><p>Still, her stomach bottomed out. He\u2019d noticed her examination of him, and now sought to...comfort her for her rudeness? How unexpected and sweet. Well, then, she would be brave.</p> <p>She raised her chin and forced herself to meet his gaze. \u201cMaybe I\u2019m just amazingly tiny,\u201d she said, trying for humor.</p><p>His eyelids narrowed menacingly, hiding all that gold, leaving only the black of his pupils. \u201cDo not lie, even through implication. Not for any reason, not even to be nice.\u201d</p><p>Her fingers went numb, and her heart once again fluttered. He was okay with staring, but joking was a killing offense. Good to know.</p><p>\u201cLies are the language of evil,\u201d he added in a gentler tone.</p><p>A gentler tone, but still intense.</p><p>The elevator stopped, the doors opened and a short, heavyset man took a step inside.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll take the next elevator,\u201d the big guy announced.</p><p>The smaller man instantly froze. He licked his lips, backed up. \u201cYou know what? You\u2019re right. I will.\u201d He spun and raced away.</p> <p>For a moment, Nicola considered following his lead. There was being polite, and there was being wise, and the two didn\u2019t always intersect. The fact that the Viking wanted to be alone with her couldn\u2019t bode well.</p><p>The doors began to draw together. Now was her chance to run.</p><p>But... she couldn\u2019t do it. \u201cYou didn\u2019t yell at him,\u201d she pointed out, unsure why she was having trouble keeping quiet\u2014and why she\u2019d stayed. \u201cYou seem like such an equal-opportunity yeller.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t yell at you, either,\u201d he said with a frown. A moment passed. He nodded as if he\u2019d just realized something important. \u201cYou\u2019re sensitive. I\u2019ll be more careful.\u201d</p><p>What, he dreaded her wrath?</p><p>He studied her as intently as she\u2019d studied him, causing her to squirm. \u201cYou are five-two, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFive two and a half, thank you.\u201d She never forgot that very important half!</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a somewhat decent height for a woman, I suppose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor an eight-year-old boy, too,\u201d she grumbled.</p><p>\u201cNot any that I know,\u201d he replied, deadpan.</p><p>Was he teasing her? Or was he just that blunt?</p><p>Finally the box stopped for good, and the doors opened to the lobby. Her companion politely waved her forward. She offered a bemused smile, said \u201cThanks\u201d and hurried out\u2014alive.</p><p>Almost alone, she thought wistfully. She would be able to sort through her thoughts and figure out what she was going to do when her sister... When Laila...</p><p>She couldn\u2019t think the word, even though she knew it would happen sooner rather than later. A mercy for Laila. Another sorrow for Nicola. She wasn\u2019t sure how many more she could bear and still survive.</p><p>Most people with their condition and underdeveloped heart died in their late teens. But she and Laila had lasted into their early twenties, a true miracle in itself, and she should be thrilled with the time they\u2019d had together. And yet, she wanted more. For both of them. Laila wasn\u2019t satisfied with her life, and a person should be satisfied before they died. Right?</p><p>Nicola just...well, she needed to decide on a plan of action today. For once, her mind wasn\u2019t shrouded by a thick veil of fear and anxiety. And why were people looking at her as if she were a hideous beast monster determined to\u2014</p><p>Not her, she realized, but the man beside her. The giant from the elevator. Nicola stopped, and so did he. He failed to maneuver around her, as if her slight presence was somehow blocking his path. She faced him fully, anchoring her hands on her hips. He stepped three feet away from her, and she found herself shivering all over again.</p><p>The heat did come from him.</p><p>He peered down at her, his golden eyes framed by the blackest, most luscious lashes of all time, so unexpected in that rough-and-tumble time-traveling-warrior face.</p><p>\u201cCan I help you?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cNo, but you can have coffee with me.\u201d</p><p>No, he\u2019d said. Meaning, she couldn\u2019t help him. He really took the honesty thing seriously. And had he just...asked her out? \u201cWhy would you want to do that?\u201d she wondered aloud. And why hadn\u2019t she just said no? She had to return to work, like, soon. Her lunch hour was almost over.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not ready to go home.\u201d</p><p>Ah. Not a date, then. He simply craved a distraction from whatever had brought him to the Palace of Tears and Death, and oh, could she sympathize. And she wasn\u2019t disappointed that he wanted nothing romantic from her. Really. Her mother had been right. Boys equaled excitement and excitement equaled another heart attack. And really, she hadn\u2019t ever missed boys and excitement all that much because she\u2019d always had Laila. But Laila was...was...</p><p>\u201cCoffee sounds great,\u201d she croaked as her chin quivered. Clearly she needed a distraction, too. The planning could wait. So could work. Pulling herself out of this pity pit was more important. \u201cThere\u2019s a little shop down the far corridor.\u201d</p><p>He stepped up beside her, and all that delicious heat returned. They kicked into gear, earning several more stares and even a little whispering. People had to be shocked by the difference in their sizes, and she couldn\u2019t really blame them. The top of Nicola\u2019s head failed to reach the man\u2019s massive shoulders.</p><p>\u201cSo, what\u2019s your name?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cKoldo.\u201d</p><p>Cold-oh. Had to be foreign. \u201cI\u2019m Nicola.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNicola. Latin, meaning \u2018a victorious people.\u2019\u201d</p><p>They turned the first corner, though the scenery didn\u2019t change. All of the hallways were the same: white and silver with signs posted along the walls. \u201cUh, did you just secretly look that up on a cell phone I can\u2019t see or did you already know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI knew.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe words we speak are important, powerful, and since names are spoken every day, directed at specific individuals, people often become what they are called. I like to know who I\u2019m dealing with.\u201d</p><p>Well, she wouldn\u2019t tell him she was the most defeated person ever and shatter his illusions. \u201cWhat does Laila mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDark beauty.\u201d</p><p>Interesting. Laila was fair, but she was lovely. \u201cWhat does Koldo mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFamous warrior.\u201d</p><p>A warrior, as she\u2019d first assumed? She wondered if he was in the army. \u201cAre you truly famous?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>No hesitation. No pride. In his mind, he must have simply stated a fact. She admired his confidence. \u201cSo, what do you do, Koldo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m in the army.\u201d</p><p>Nailed it!</p><p>Two more corners, and they reached the shop. He directed her to an empty table. \u201cWhat would you like, Nicola?\u201d</p><p>Her name on his lips...an embrace and a curse, all rolled into one. It was a little disconcerting. \u201cOh, I can\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t offer to give me money, and insult me,\u201d he said, and for once he sounded genuinely offended. \u201cNow, then. Let\u2019s try this again. What would you like? I\u2019m buying.\u201d</p><p>She smiled. No one had ever insisted on buying her something to drink. Most offers came from the coworkers who knew about her situation, and were mere tokens. The moment she mentioned taking care of her own bill, the other person immediately acquiesced. \u201cAn herbal tea, please. Something without caffeine. And thank you very much.\u201d</p><p>A nod, and he was off, leaving her chilled. She watched as he approached the counter. Watched as the punked-out cashier stared at him with utter fascination. He didn\u2019t seem to notice as he placed the order and waited for the drinks...and muffins, scones and croissants from the looks of it. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>What kind of woman would capture his attention? she wondered.</p><p>Another warrior-type probably. Strong, capable, with big-enough bones to withstand any kind of abuse\u2014uh, contact.</p><p>He returned a few minutes later and spread out a feast before her, the scent of berries, yeast and sugar wafting up and making her mouth water. She hadn\u2019t eaten in forever, it seemed, because she\u2019d been too consumed with worry for Laila, dread over paying bills she hadn\u2019t begun to make a dent in and, well, trying not to drown in a sea of despair.</p> <p>Today was different, though. Even as upset as she was, she felt better than she had in a long, long time, and her stomach rumbled.</p><p>Cheeks flushing, she claimed her tea and sipped at the burning liquid, savoring the sweetness. \u201cSeriously, Koldo. This means a lot to me. A thousand times thank you wouldn\u2019t be enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s very much my pleasure, Nicola.\u201d</p><p>So polite. She liked that.</p><p>And the likes were certainly outweighing the dislikes now, weren\u2019t they?</p> <p>\u201cThe food is for you, as well,\u201d he said, pushing a muffin in her direction.</p><p>Her eyes widened with astonishment. \u201cAll of it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>Of course, he\u2019d said. As if she was used to eating for an entire legion.</p><p>\u201cYou will keep up your strength,\u201d he added. \u201cRight now, you\u2019re too pale, too frail.\u201d</p><p>She wasn\u2019t insulted. She was pale and frail. Nicola selected one of the croissants, pinched off a warm, buttery corner. \u201cSo...were you here visiting someone?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Though she waited, attentive, he offered no more than that. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be. I\u2019m not.\u201d</p><p>Annnd...again he offered nothing more. \u201cDo you come here often?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat could be the plan, yes.\u201d</p><p>Silence.</p><p>Talkative much? But okay, no problem. They weren\u2019t really here to get to know each other, were they? They were here to forget their lives, if only for a little while. \u201cI\u2019m here a lot.\u201d Every day, in fact.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps we\u2019ll see each other again.\u201d He lifted a steaming cup of coffee to lips as plush and red as candy apples and gulped. His expression never changed, the fiery temperature somehow not melting and welding his tongue to the roof of his mouth.</p> <p>\u201cPerhaps,\u201d she offered.</p><p>Again, silence.</p><p>What were girls supposed to talk about with boys they weren\u2019t interested in romantically? Because, if she were being honest\u2014something he would definitely approve of\u2014this was kind of painful. It wasn\u2019t what she\u2019d expected or hoped for.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you do when you\u2019re not here, Nicola?\u201d he asked, at last taking up the reins of conversation.</p><p>Relieved by his efforts, she relaxed in her seat. \u201cI work. I\u2019m an accountant every weekday morning and afternoon.\u201d A job guaranteed to keep her blood pressure steady. She could crunch numbers, sort receipts and design a financial plan to get anyone out of debt. Anyone but herself, that is. She was still working through her parents\u2019 bills, and her and Laila\u2019s medical costs were still stacking up. \u201cI\u2019m a checkout girl at an organic food market every evening and on weekends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeither of those jobs sprang from a childhood dream.\u201d</p><p>No, but dreams died...and if you weren\u2019t careful, the ghosts would haunt your present. \u201cWhy do you think that?\u201d She wasn\u2019t fond of her jobs, but she\u2019d always done whatever was needed to survive.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m highly observant.\u201d</p><p>And quite modest.</p><p>\u201cSo, what did you want to do?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Why not tell him the truth? \u201cI wanted to live,\u201d she said. Really live. \u201cI wanted to travel the world, jump from airplanes, dance on top of a skyscraper, deep sea dive for treasure and pet an elephant.\u201d</p><p>He tilted his head to the side and steadily met her gaze. \u201cInteresting.\u201d</p><p>Because she\u2019d mentioned activities rather than a career? Well, there was a reason for that. She\u2019d never known how long she would live, so a career had seemed pointless. \u201cWhat about you?\u201d she asked. \u201cWhat did you want to do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m doing it.\u201d He refused to look away. \u201cYou could still do all of the things you mentioned.\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, I can\u2019t. My heart couldn\u2019t take it.\u201d Let him assume she meant her nerves would get the better of her rather than the truth.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right.\u201d</p><p>Wait. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf words are the power of life and death, you just pointed a loaded gun at your head.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about? That\u2019s absurd.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou speak what you believe, and you believe you\u2019re doomed. If there\u2019s one thing I\u2019ve learned throughout the years, it\u2019s that what you believe is the impetus for your entire life.\u201d</p><p>A spark of anger caused her heart to skip a beat. \u201cI believe in reality.\u201d</p><p>He waved a dismissive hand through the air. \u201cYour perception of reality is skewed.\u201d</p><p>Oh, really? \u201cHow so?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou believe what you see and feel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh, doesn\u2019t everyone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverything in this natural world is changeable. Temporary. But the things you cannot see or feel are eternal.\u201d</p><p>She slammed her tea on the tabletop. Liquid splashed from the hole in the lid, burning her hand. \u201cLookit. Maybe you\u2019re not getting enough oxygen up there where your head lives, but you sound like a crazy person.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not crazy. I know you can be healed.\u201d</p><p>Healed? As if she hadn\u2019t tried everything already. \u201cSome things can\u2019t be changed. Besides, you don\u2019t have any clue about the things I\u2019ve done or the future I have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know more than you think. You\u2019re so afraid to live, you\u2019re actually killing yourself.\u201d</p><p>Heavy silence descended. He\u2019d...nailed it, she thought. She\u2019d watched as fear slowly ate away at her sister\u2019s happiness, tainting every aspect of her existence. And in the days before she\u2019d landed in the hospital, that\u2019s all Laila had had. An existence.</p><p>Her stomach had always hurt, ruining her appetite. Nicola was already striding down that road.</p><p>Laila had lost weight, and even her bones had seemed to wither. Give Nicola another few months.</p><p>Laila\u2019s hair had lost its glossy sheen. Blue and black smudges had become a permanent fixture under her eyes. Yeah, another few months should take care of that for Nicola, too.</p><p>\u201cSomewhere along the way you lost hope,\u201d Koldo said, and there was a grim quality to his voice, as if he had suffered a loss of his own. \u201cBut if you\u2019ll listen to me, if you\u2019ll do what I say, your heart and body will mend and you\u2019ll at last do all the things you\u2019ve always wanted to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you a doctor?\u201d she demanded. \u201cHow do you know that? And what do you think you can do for or to me that hasn\u2019t already been tried?\u201d</p><p>Ignoring her questions, he said, \u201cSelah, Nicola.\u201d</p><p>And with that, he disappeared, there one moment, gone the next.</p><p>CHAPTER FOUR</p><p>DETERMINED TO PROVE A POINT to Nicola, Koldo flashed out of the hospital to his underground home in West India Quay. The place of his greatest shame.</p><p>The place he kept his mother.</p><p>The small, hidden cave was illuminated by a soft green glow emanating from a lake of water uncontaminated by human life. Air so fresh it literally crackled with vitality enveloped him.</p><p>Just like the home in South Africa, he kept no furniture here, no wall hangings, no decorations and no amenities of any kind. Unlike the other home, there was a cage, a bucket for food, a bucket for water and a blanket. He would have provided his mother with a bed, but then, she\u2019d never given him one.</p><p>\u201cWell, well,\u201d she said. \u201cLook who\u2019s returned.\u201d</p><p>And there she was. Cornelia. A name that meant horn. And she was certainly that. Sharp and deadly, able to puncture a man\u2019s heart and coldly walk away as his very life drained from him.</p><p>She sat in the corner of the cage, wearing a robe made by human hands and natural fabric. One Koldo had tossed her after ripping off the one made in the skies, for the robes their people wore could clean themselves and their wearers. But he hadn\u2019t wanted Cornelia cleansed in any way. He\u2019d wanted her to know the feel of dirt that could never be scrubbed away.</p><p>Her skin was pallid, her freckles a stark contrast. Her long hair had been shorn and now fell to her ears, the locks tangled and sticking out in spikes. He hadn\u2019t been the one to do this deed. A few weeks ago, she had been captured by a horde of pic\u0103 and dragged into hell in an attempt to force Koldo to betray Zacharel. He hadn\u2019t. He had rescued her instead.</p><p>He had no idea what else had been done to her, only that torture had, indeed, taken place. When he\u2019d found her, she had hovered at the edge of death, and that was the only reason she hadn\u2019t fought him as he doctored her back to health. Now, here they were.</p><p>Her, as hate-filled as ever.</p><p>Him, shockingly dissatisfied with the situation.</p><p>As a child trapped under his father\u2019s reign, he had dreamed of punishing her in the worst of ways. And he still wanted to. Oh, did he want to. The desire was always there, burning in his chest. But he hadn\u2019t. He wouldn\u2019t. He\u2019d allowed himself to do little things, like denying her the bed and proper robe, but nothing else. He was nothing like her, and every day he proved it. He would come here, pit himself against the pull to act and then leave.</p><p>Wise men knew not to even approach the door of their temptation, but Koldo hadn\u2019t yet convinced himself to stop.</p><p>\u201cHello, Mother.\u201d</p><p>She sucked in a breath. \u201cI should have cut your tongue out of your mouth when I had the chance.\u201d She tossed a pebble at him. The stone bounced off his shoulder and tumbled to the floor.</p><p>\u201cJust like you should have drowned me. I know.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes narrowed, long lashes fusing together and hiding the violet depths he so often saw in his nightmares. \u201cI hadn\u2019t the stomach for violence back then. But your father... I expected better of him. He should have done what I could not.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOh, never doubt that he tried.\u201d Many times.</p><p>Koldo thought back to the day Cornelia had flown him over his father\u2019s camp and dropped him. As weak and agonized as he\u2019d been, landing had hurt more than the brutal removal of his wings.</p><p>A huge, bald man with more muscles and scars than Koldo had ever seen stomped toward him. Cornelia called, \u201cMeet your son, Nox\u2014may you destroy each other,\u201d before flying away.</p> <p>Nox. A name that meant night.</p><p>Koldo had blacked out seconds after that, only to awaken on the floor of a spacious tent, the bald man looming over him, grinning widely, his eyes as black as his name implied.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re my son, are you? Raised by a do-gooder angel.\u201d</p><p>His mother? A do-gooder?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m betting you\u2019re filled with silly notions about right and wrong,\u201d Nox had continued. \u201cAren\u2019t you, boy?\u201d</p> <p>Concentrating on the words had proven difficult\u2014everything inside Koldo had been screaming at him to run and never look back. But he\u2019d been trapped inside a body too weak to move or flash. All he could do was watch as thin curls of smoke wafted from the male\u2019s pores, scenting the air with sulfur.</p><p>That\u2019s when realization had slammed into Koldo with collision force. A bald head, bottomless eyes and black smoke could mean only one thing. Nefas. His father hailed from the most dangerous, vile race in existence. A race that sneaked up on humans, poisoned slowly, painfully...destroying utterly. A race without a conscience.</p><p>A race just like the demons.</p><p>The Nefas were death dealers. Soul suckers.</p><p>The age of their victims never mattered. The gender of their victims never mattered. They lived to inflict pain. They killed. And they laughed while doing it.</p><p>\u201cNo worries,\u201d the man had said. \u201cYou can unlearn.\u201d</p> <p>Nox had wanted Koldo to embrace the Nefas way of life, and Koldo had resisted...at first. But every time he\u2019d tried to escape, flashing away, his father had been right on his heels, easily finding him and dragging him back\u2014punishing him. Once, Nox had tied him down and poured acid down his throat. The time after that, Nox had plucked out one of his eyes and nailed it to the bar of his cage, so that he could watch himself watching himself. Koldo had had to win the eye back\u2014and stuff it back in. By then he\u2019d been a little older and had been able to partially heal it. Still, his sight had never been the same.</p><p>Bitterness and hatred had taken root inside him. Why him? Why had no one saved him? How much more would he be forced to endure?</p><p>Finally, he\u2019d lost his will to fight. He\u2019d given in. He\u2019d raided villages. He\u2019d helped his father and the other soldiers fit their mouths over their victims\u2019 mouths and suck out innocent souls, leaving only lifeless shells.</p><p>A man will do just about anything to survive, boy.</p><p>It was the only one of his father\u2019s lessons that he\u2019d taken to heart.</p><p>Now, Koldo was certain he\u2019d passed the point of redemption. He could have fought harder. Should have fought harder. That he hadn\u2019t... Guilt would always ride him, and shame would always fill him.</p><p>He had too many memories. The dark kind that never went away. Each one made him long to pluck out his eyes, just to blank his line of sight, or cut off his ears, just to quiet the screams.</p><p>Over the years he\u2019d earned a big-enough name to draw Germanus\u2019s attention. An army of Sent Ones had swooped into his father\u2019s camp to destroy Koldo, had seen the scars on his back and mistakenly assumed he wasn\u2019t Nefas, for Nefas could not grow wings, and Koldo had obviously had them at one time. So, the soldiers had captured him instead.</p> <p>That had been the beginning of his new life.</p><p>Germanus\u2014a name meaning \u201cbrother\u201d\u2014could have and probably should have slain him despite his origins. Koldo had been feral. He had snarled and cursed and attacked anyone who neared him. After all the things he had done, after all of the people he had killed, he was supposed to forgive himself and adopt the \u201cdo-gooder\u201d approach? Impossible!</p><p>But Germanus had looked deeper than the surface, had seen the shame and guilt in Koldo\u2019s eyes. Emotions raw and intense, even back then.</p><p>The king of the Sent Ones had spent the next several years coaxing Koldo from his rages, doing his best to comfort a young male with such a damaged past, ensuring Koldo was trained to fight the right way, that he had a safe, comfortable place to sleep, that he always had a proper meal to eat.</p><p>It had been Koldo\u2019s first taste of actual caring and concern, and he\u2019d soon grown to love Germanus\u2014would still die to protect him.</p><p>\u201cWhy did you mate with Nox?\u201d he asked his mother as he stalked around the cage.</p><p>\u201cWhy not? He was a very beautiful man.\u201d</p><p>Some women would find such a dangerous male attractive, Koldo supposed. Despite the bald head and dead eyes, he\u2019d had a face far lovelier than any Koldo had ever seen. A purity of features, a radiance most beings could only ever dream about.</p><p>\u201cDid you hope to tame him? Did you think you would be the one to change him?\u201d</p><p>Cornelia pushed to her feet, always keeping her gaze on him, never permitting him to have her back, where her beautiful white-and-gold wings lay. She expected him to remove them. She was right to do so. It was one of his biggest temptations.</p><p>\u201cEvil cannot be changed,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cDid he betray you for another? One of his own kind, perhaps? A female better suited to his particular tastes? Or, perhaps he turned to many other females.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up.\u201d</p><p>But he couldn\u2019t. He was closing in on the truth. Even as sickness churned in his stomach, he said, \u201cHe used to laugh about you, you know. Said you loved him, begged him to be with you, to stay with you. Said you sobbed when he left. Said you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up, shut up, shut up!\u201d she shrieked, racing to the bars where Koldo stood. She shook with so much force he was surprised the reinforced metal held steady.</p><p>The ferocity of her reaction should have pleased him. This was what he\u2019d always wanted from her, after all. Rage, frustration. Helplessness. Mirroring what he\u2019d felt for so many years. But the sickness intensified. How could he do this to a female? Any female?</p><p>How could he hurt another of his kind?</p><p>She spit on his boots. \u201cI hate you. I hate you so much I can barely breathe past it. I hate you so much I\u2019d rather rot in this cage than pretend I love you or say I\u2019m sorry for the way I treated you. I\u2019m not! I never will be. You were an abomination then and you\u2019re an abomination now. The day you die is the day I rejoice.\u201d</p><p>Hurt and fury joined the collage of other emotions, the darkness in his mind thickening, once again banging at the dam. He stepped back, away from her, lest he lash out and end her\u2014becoming just like his father. The scent of jasmine and honeysuckle followed him.</p><p>Even here, she carried the despised fragrance with her.</p><p>What had an innocent little boy done to elicit this kind of rejection? How could she blame Koldo for his father\u2019s treatment of her?</p><p>How could Koldo still hurt, after all this time?</p><p>\u201cIf ever I die,\u201d he said, \u201cyou won\u2019t be the cause. You\u2019re too weak. You\u2019ve always been weak, and that\u2019s why Nox let you go.\u201d</p><p>Again she spit on his boots.</p><p>Hands fisted, he flashed to his home in South Africa. He had sixteen residences throughout the world, each tucked securely away from prying human eyes, but more and more this was the one he preferred, the one where he spent most of his free time.</p><p>Before he even manifested, he was beating at the walls, tearing the newly healed skin on his knuckles. Blood splattered. Bone snapped.</p><p>This time, the rage failed to drain as quickly.</p><p>Hours seemed to pass before he was shucking his clothing, ripping the material in his haste. The shirt and pants hit the floor and drew together of their own accord, the tears and halves forming a perfect robe. Cool water droplets splashed against his bare skin as he peered out at the turbulent waterfall.</p><p>That woman...</p><p>He punched the side of the wall, dust and debris ghosting through the air. Always she reduced him to this, to a man who felt as if his heart had been cleaved from his chest, stomped on, sliced, kicked around and burned to ash. He had to gain the upper hand with her.</p><p>Otherwise, he would kill her.</p><p>When Cornelia breathed her last, her spirit would leave her body. But she would not go up, would not spend the rest of eternity with the Most High in the Heavens of heavens. She couldn\u2019t. To die with hatred blazing in her heart was to go down, down, down. It was a spiritual law no one\u2014not even a Sent One\u2014could supersede.</p><p>Devilish things could not coexist with divine things.</p><p>Reason number one Koldo was in such danger himself.</p><p>Cornelia deserved such a fate, yes. She deserved to suffer for all eternity. But he wasn\u2019t going to be the one to send her to an early grave. He wasn\u2019t like her\u2014if he had to remind himself every day, he would. More than that, he wanted...what he could never have. Answers. Her love.</p><p>Absolution.</p><p>He gritted his teeth. No, he wasn\u2019t like her\u2014and he no longer wanted those things. A taste of vengeance was all he craved.</p><p>The thought hit him, and he paused. There was no way someone like him could help a female as fragile as Nicola, was there?</p><p>He should have stayed away from her, he realized. But he hadn\u2019t, and now it was too late. He\u2019d flashed away from her to prove the existence of supernatural activity, hoping to force her to accept it and take the first step toward fighting the demons. Now she knew.</p><p>Now she would ask questions.</p><p>If she asked the wrong people, they would give her the wrong answers.</p><p>He scrubbed a hand over the smoothness of his scalp. He had to stick to his plan.</p><p>And that wasn\u2019t such a bad thing, he told himself. Nicola intrigued him. Her voice, so soft, so sweet...so addictive, a caress his ears already craved again. Her wit. Her resilience. Her bravery. He\u2019d snipped at her, yet she hadn\u2019t sobbed and begged for mercy.</p><p>Throughout her very short span on earth, one disaster after another had befallen her. Perhaps the demons were responsible, or perhaps the imperfect world. Perhaps both. Whatever the reason, he wanted better for her. The better he himself had found with Germanus. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Koldo just had to teach her how to fight the toxins. And he had to do it while keeping her calm. Fear would strengthen what the paura had left behind, and tension would weaken her immune system, strengthening what the grzech had left behind. Without fear and tension, the toxins would fade. With hope and joy, the toxins would fade faster.</p><p>Bottom line, what you fed grew and what you starved died.</p><p>Would she be able to look past her negative emotions and see the light?</p> <p>A spark of anticipation beaded, somehow overshadowing the nearly overwhelming cascade of acid his mother had caused. Despite everything, he couldn\u2019t wait to see Nicola again, to learn what she\u2019d decided about his disappearance. If she\u2019d convinced herself she\u2019d imagined him, or if she\u2019d accepted he was something other than human.</p><p>\u201cSo not the view I was hoping for,\u201d a male voice said from behind him.</p><p>Still naked, Koldo spun and faced Thane, the second-in-command of Zacharel\u2019s army. Thane, meaning freeman. And the warrior certainly seemed to be everything the word implied. The male\u2019s carnal appetite was well-known. He hunted a new lover every day, discarding those he finished with as if they were dirty tissue.</p><p>And yet, even knowing that, women still flocked to him, as though he was the only male in creation with curling blond hair and big blue eyes.</p><p>\u201cWhat does Zacharel want me to do this time?\u201d Koldo demanded, reaching into the air pocket at his side to withdraw another robe. He yanked the material over his head, trying not to stare at Thane\u2019s wings. They arched over the warrior\u2019s wide shoulders, sweeping all the way to the floor. Pure white was broken up by dazzling gold. Trying\u2014and failing.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be better to show rather than explain,\u201d Thane said, an odd note in his voice.</p><p>That didn\u2019t bode well. \u201cVery well. Lead the way.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER FIVE</p><p>THE NEXT WEEK PASSED in a blur for Nicola. Every day she woke up at the butt crack of dawn, went to work, went to see her sister on her lunch hour, went back to work, went to her second job and toiled until the wee hours of the night before at last heading home, watching TV to unwind, then falling asleep for four measly hours\u2014and the cycle started all over again.</p><p>Now, she sat at her desk at Estell\u00e4 Industries, watching the clock. Come on, noon. Get here already. The only aspect of her life that had changed was her thinking. She couldn\u2019t get Koldo out of her mind. Who was he? What was he?</p><p>After his disappearance, she\u2019d asked the girl at the coffee shop whether or not she\u2019d actually spoken to a giant of a man with a bald head and beaded beard. The answer hadn\u2019t surprised her.</p> <p>\u201cAre you kidding me? I\u2019m not blind. But, uh, are you guys dating or, like, is he available? Because I already wrote my number on a napkin if you want to, like, give it to him.\u201d</p><p>Unless they\u2019d shared the same hallucination, Koldo was real and Nicola wasn\u2019t crazy. Or maybe she was, despite that. She\u2019d actually taken the napkin, curious to know what Koldo\u2019s reaction would be.</p><p>But...what was he? she wondered again. What did say-la mean, the last word he\u2019d spoken to her? She had no idea how to spell it, so she hadn\u2019t been able to look it up online. And how had he vanished in the blink of an eye? Was he some kind of ghost that more than one person could see?</p><p>With as many near-death and death-death-for-a-minute-or-two experiences as she\u2019d had, she knew there was an afterlife. Several times she\u2019d floated into it. Once, she\u2019d even talked to some kind of being.</p><p>Isn\u2019t this nice? he\u2019d said. He\u2019d had pale hair, eyes as clear as the ocean and a pair of beautiful white wings. He\u2019d been handsome in a classic movie-star kind of way, and had worn a long robe as he\u2019d tried to urge her down a long tunnel. Isn\u2019t this peaceful? Just let go of your old life and you can have this forever.</p><p>He\u2019d reminded her of the angels she\u2019d seen in picture books, but there\u2019d been something about his tone...something in those eyes...she had fought him, wanting to return to Laila, and for a second, only a second, his affable mask had fallen away and she\u2019d gotten a glimpse of bright red eyes, gnarled bones and fangs.</p><p>A monster. A monster just like she used to see as a child, before therapy and drugs had convinced her otherwise. Now she wasn\u2019t sure what to think about Koldo and the monsters and had no idea how to figure it out. There was an overload of information out there, but nothing had jelled with her.</p><p>The right answer would elicit peace; she knew that much. Peace always accompanied truth.</p> <p>Koldo would just have to tell her. If he ever showed up again.</p><p>And he had to show up! Did he really know how to heal her heart? If so, could Laila\u2019s be healed, as well?</p><p>The more she wondered, the more hope filled her. To be able to fall asleep and not wonder if she would wake up, or if Laila would still be alive...to never fear losing another sibling. To be able to walk up a hill, holding Laila\u2019s hand, without either of them passing out...to be able to skip and jog and jump...to be able to dance! Oh, to dance. To fall in love, get married and have children. To live, really live, as they\u2019d used to dream, before tragedy convinced them to deal in \u201creality\u201d rather than \u201cfantasy.\u201d</p><p>Koldo had said he would be visiting the hospital again, but hadn\u2019t mentioned when. If he waited much longer, she might strangle him when he appeared, just to release a little steam. Every day she looked for him so diligently the nurses asked her if she\u2019d like a Xanax or ten to help her relax.</p><p>When has anything good ever happened to you?</p><p>The question wafted through her mind, and she frowned.</p><p>Being optimistic will only lead to crushing disappointment.</p><p>No. No, that wasn\u2019t true.</p><p>You don\u2019t need one more thing to worry about right now.</p><p>Her hands curled into fists. Before meeting Koldo, she might have caved under the weight of those thoughts. She definitely would have battled an upset stomach, paced a thousand miles without ever leaving her chair and frayed the edges of her nerves until her limbs began to shake uncontrollably. Now...</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not listening to you.\u201d Or herself. Whatever! She had hope for the first time in years, and she wasn\u2019t letting go. She leaned back in the chair at her desk. \u201cHe\u2019ll keep his word. He\u2019ll turn up, and he\u2019ll answer all of my questions.\u201d</p><p>The depressing thoughts stopped, and she breathed a sigh of relief.</p><p>A knock sounded at the door.</p><p>\u201cAre you Nicola Lane?\u201d a hard, biting voice asked.</p><p>Nicola blinked rapidly and focused on the beautiful woman in the open doorway. She was tall, slender and black, with a fall of jet-black curls. Shadows consumed eyes the color of chocolate. Koldo\u2019s were lighter, like caramel, and\u2014 Wow, Nicola must be hungry.</p><p>The woman wore a black-and-white tailored jacket, a pencil skirt and mile-high stilettos that perfectly complemented toenails painted black-and-white. Everything about her screamed style, sophistication and cold-blooded calm. So, what was she doing here, at the middle-class stress capital of the world?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Nicola, yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, congratulations. I\u2019m now part of your department.\u201d</p><p>Sarcasm on the first day. Wonderful. \u201cAre you Jamila Engill or Sirena Kegan?\u201d</p><p>Frowning, the girl said, \u201cJamila Engill.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPretty name.\u201d She wondered what Jamila meant. No doubt Koldo would have known.</p><p>\u201cYou have two new hires?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Nicola tugged the lapels of her sweater closer together to ward off the chill blasting from Jamila\u2019s attitude. Okay, fine. It was from the overhead vent. \u201cPlease, have a seat and we\u2019ll get to know each other.\u201d</p><p>Jamila marched into the office and slammed onto the far chair. Chin high in the air, she twined her hands in her lap and kept her gaze narrowed on Nicola, her back ramrod straight.</p><p>They were gonna have fun together, she could tell.</p><p>Five days ago, her very jittery, very irritable boss told her that he\u2019d decided to hire two more accountants. Shock had nearly drilled Nicola to her knees. She\u2019d been begging for a new hire for months, and every time she had been told to \u201cmake do.\u201d</p><p>Currently, she was doing the work of five people. At first, she had managed. After Laila\u2019s hospitalization, she\u2019d begun to fall behind.</p><p>\u201cSo...what will be expected of me?\u201d Jamila asked tightly.</p><p>Nicola explained a little about the operating system, and even though she hated sharing personal information with a stranger, she added, \u201cI\u2019ll be as much a help as possible as you learn, but the truth is, my sister is...dying\u2014\u201d even voicing the word was difficult \u201c\u2014and she... Well, I\u2019m being pulled away from the office more and more.\u201d Sooner or later, Jamila would have found out anyway. Phone calls would have come in, paperwork would have blasted through, or coworkers would have mentioned it.</p><p>This way, it was out in the open from the start.</p><p>Jamila leaned back in a pose that should have relaxed her. Instead, she appeared more rigid. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>People always said that. Nicola wondered what Koldo the Honest would have said.</p><p>Just the thought of him caused her heart to flutter. She cleared her throat. \u201cSometimes we have to confront employees who haven\u2019t turned in their books. They\u2019ll make excuses, but you\u2019ll have to stay on them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat won\u2019t be a problem.\u201d</p><p>No flinching, and no paling.</p><p>\u201cGood, then you should do fine.\u201d Unless you keep glaring at me like that.</p><p>\u201cHey, y\u2019all. I\u2019m Sirena, and I\u2019m reporting for duty.\u201d</p><p>Nicola\u2019s attention shifted to the girl now standing in the doorway. She was taller than Nicola by an inch, maybe two, and wore an ill-fitting black jacket and matching pair of slacks, with a pink button-up top breaking up the darkness. Her hair was long and blond and as straight as a board. Her eyes were as wide as a doll\u2019s, a mix of brown and blue; a pair of horn-rimmed glasses perched on her nose.</p><p>\u201cOh, my,\u201d she said, shutting the door behind her. She glided to the other chair and eased down, then extended a small gift basket. \u201cThis is for you. I was just so excited to work with you, I couldn\u2019t help but show it.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>How sweet. \u201cThank you.\u201d Nicola accepted the offering with a smile. A jasmine body wash and a lotion scented with honeysuckle.</p><p>\u201cLook at this place.\u201d Sirena gazed around. \u201cIt\u2019s not big, but it\u2019s homey and wonderful, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>Homey? Wonderful? Not even close. The room boasted plain white walls and a concrete floor painted gray. The only furniture was the desk, Nicola\u2019s chair and the two chairs in front. Not one of the three had a cushion.</p> <p>Her first few months in the office, Nicola had hung pictures of her family on the walls, but every time she\u2019d looked at them, memories had flooded her.</p><p>She\u2019d heard her mother shout, \u201cWhat are you doing, laughing like that? Excitement of any kind isn\u2019t good for you. Do you want to die and send me spiraling into another depression?\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d remembered her father patting her on the head and saying, \u201cEvery night I go to sleep afraid I\u2019ll never again see my beloved girls.\u201d</p><p>Well, his fear had come true, but not for the reason he\u2019d thought. His life had been cut short by a drunk driver, and he hadn\u2019t seen them again.</p><p>Pictures of Laila only served to remind her of all she would soon lose. Her best friend, her confidante, her cheerleader. Her very heart.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be able to decorate your cubby however you like,\u201d she said, fighting a quiver in her chin.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t wait!\u201d Sirena\u2019s happy tone chimed.</p><p>Jamila stiffened, as though offended.</p><p>A knock boomed from the door. The entrance swung open before she could bid the person on the other side to enter. Dexter Turner peeked his head inside. He had a full head of dark hair and brown eyes that were puppy-dog sweet.</p><p>\u201cHey, Nicola, I was wondering\u2014\u201d His gaze landed on Jamila, widened, slid to Sirena, widened still more, before finally settling on Nicola. He gulped. \u201cI, uh, didn\u2019t know you had company.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can leave if you want,\u201d Sirena said, eager to please.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re fine,\u201d Nicola told her, not wanting the women to vacate just yet. Dex had asked Nicola out several times, and she\u2019d always told him no. In high school, she and Laila had been forbidden to date for their own good. Then, after their parents had died and they\u2019d been on their own, they\u2019d both gone a little crazy, going out with anyone who asked.</p><p>Granted, only five guys had asked Nicola. But then, she was glad there hadn\u2019t been more. She had hated every minute of every date. The nervousness had been too much for her, especially since each of the boys had expected her to be more experienced than she was, considering her age. She had stuttered, and she had squirmed in the uncomfortable silences that followed.</p><p>After vomiting before the last one, and nearly passing out during dinner, she had decided not to date until her doctors discovered a way to regulate her heartbeat once and for all.</p><p>Not Laila, though. Laila had flourished under the attention. A few months ago, she\u2019d even made a go of a serious relationship. But the two had fought and fought and fought, and all that strife had put a strain on her body. She\u2019d ended up in the hospital. Of course, when the doctors told her that she would never leave, the guy had walked away and never come back.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll just catch you later,\u201d Dex said, and shut the door.</p><p>Several beats of silence passed.</p><p>\u201cIs he yours?\u201d Jamila asked.</p><p>\u201cNope,\u201d Nicola said. \u201cI\u2019m single.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell, I think you two would make an adorable couple,\u201d Sirena said, her hand fluttering over her cheek as if she were flushing. \u201cJust adorable.\u201d</p><p>The phone rang, and Nicola picked up the receiver, grateful for the distraction. \u201cNicola Lane\u2019s office.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMiss Lane?\u201d A strong male voice. Familiar.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said, her heart suddenly pounding erratically.</p><p>\u201cThis is Dr. Carter at County General.\u201d</p><p>Dread spiked, and she experienced a rush of dizziness. \u201cWhat\u2019s happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing good, I\u2019m afraid. Your sister has taken another turn for the worse. How soon can you get here?\u201d</p><p>WHAT DID I DO to deserve this? Koldo had spent the past six days with Thane. An eternity, surely. A punishment, definitely. They had traveled to the Downfall, Thane\u2019s place of business. A palace of iniquity, to be sure. One that would have been visible to the human eye if not for the cloud surrounding it. But it had to be this way. Only the Most High, Sent Ones, angels and demons operated in the spiritual realm. Other supernatural creatures, like the ones Thane entertained, would have been unable to visit otherwise.</p><p>The entire place was in the process of a very slooow descent toward the earth, moving a mere inch a day.</p><p>Falling.</p><p>As the members of the Army of Disgrace might at any sign of misconduct. Symbolism at its best, he thought. But then, wickedness of any kind caused a separation with the Most High.</p><p>The club would eventually end up in hell.</p><p>Won\u2019t think about that.</p><p>Other than successfully completing the three demon-killing missions Zacharel had assigned the entire army, Koldo and his companions hadn\u2019t left the club.</p><p>Thane and fellow angels Xerxes and Bjorn lived there, and Koldo wasn\u2019t certain how they were allowed to maintain their status as Sent Ones. But he now knew why they had been given to Zacharel. More than using a new woman every night, they fought whoever angered them with brutal intensity\u2014and nearly everyone they encountered angered them.</p><p>Now the four of them were in the bar, sitting in a shadowed corner. Different immortal races wandered about, drinking and dancing, their hands wandering. From the trouble-happy Harpies to the scream-happy Phoenix, and everything in between. Vampires, shape-shifters, the Fae and countless others.</p><p>The snake-shifters were considered the most dangerous, with the Phoenix a close second. But the race that topped them all? The race no one ever considered, because everyone liked to pretend they were nothing more than a nightmare? The Nefas.</p><p>Koldo was very glad no one knew about his father. Gladder still no one ever would. Even the Sent Ones who had rescued him from the camp all those centuries ago had no clue about his origins.</p><p>\u201cHaving fun?\u201d Thane asked him.</p><p>\u201cWhy am I here?\u201d he demanded.</p><p>The warrior tossed back a shot of vodka. \u201cHaven\u2019t we gone over this? Because Zacharel commanded us to stick together, and I refuse to live in one of your hovels.\u201d</p><p>Koldo\u2019s frustration level spiked. He was to have a permanent babysitter now? No. Absolutely not. He refused. Something would have to be done. \u201cWhat about our mission? The one you couldn\u2019t tell me about? The one you had to show me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never said there was a mission.\u201d</p><p>Must not kill a Sent One.</p><p>\u201cBut if I had told you I wanted you to come to my place and enjoy yourself,\u201d Thane continued, \u201cyou would have said...\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Never.</p><p>\u201cAnd there\u2019s the reason I implied there was a mission.\u201d</p><p>Koldo banged his fist into the table, earning several what\u2019s-up-with-the-angry-beast glances from nearby patrons.</p><p>His gaze swung to Bjorn, who sat on Thane\u2019s right. \u201cIs he always this tricky?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you always this curious?\u201d was the irritating reply.</p><p>Bjorn had dark hair and tanned skin veined with the same gold that wove through his wings. His eyes were a rainbow of colors, from the lightest of blues to the darkest of greens, with shades of pink and purple thrown into the mix.</p><p>His name was Scandinavian for bear. Again, another perfect fit.</p><p>Jaw locked, Koldo looked to Xerxes.</p><p>Xerxes, Persian for monarch. The male had long white hair pulled back in a jeweled torque. His skin was the color of milk and lined with scar after crisscrossing scar, each in jagged patterns of three. Arresting, yes, but it was his eyes that truly held a person\u2019s attention. They were a bright ruby-red, and glowed with an endless rage matched by few.</p><p>I\u2019m one of the few.</p><p>\u201cAre they always this cryptic?\u201d Koldo asked him.</p><p>\u201cAre you always this annoying?\u201d</p><p>All three males chuckled at their own ridiculous wit.</p><p>Koldo refused to envy their friendship, or their complete ease with each other. He\u2019d heard they\u2019d met inside a demon fortress, each a prisoner\u2014each tortured. He\u2019d had no one during his own years of anguish, and perhaps that was why he preferred his solitary life. The fewer people privy to his secrets, the less likely he was to face betrayal.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve introduced you to many beautiful females, hoping one of them would entertain you\u2014and free me of the burden of you,\u201d Thane said, tossing back another vodka. \u201cYou\u2019ve refused them all. Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have no interest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you ever been with a woman?\u201d Bjorn asked.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He\u2019d had no desire. He still didn\u2019t. Except...every day since he\u2019d come here, Zacharel had granted Koldo an hour-long break from Thane. He\u2019d spent the first half of that hour with his mother, resisting the urge to hurt her, and the second half with Nicola, watching, hidden from view.</p><p>He would ensure no demons were following her. He would wonder what she\u2019d look like if she laughed with all of her heart, carefree, and his blood would heat in the strangest way. A tingling heat. Almost...electrifying. He would begin to step into the natural realm, catch himself and back off. What if his presence caused her heart undue stimulation? What if he hurt her? He had the hands of a killer, after all.</p><p>So, he would remain in the spirit realm. But the tension within him had gotten worse. The hum of anticipation had gotten stronger.</p><p>He had no idea what to do, what to think.</p><p>Even still, he was eager to speak with her, to at last discover what conclusion she\u2019d drawn about him. How was he to kick things off, though?</p><p>Your sister is going to die, but I can help you save yourself.</p><p>I\u2019m a Sent One. Heed my words.</p><p>I\u2019m a cold, hard man. I\u2019ve done terrible things. But have no fear, I won\u2019t harm you.</p><p>\u201cA virgin,\u201d Xerxes said with a tinge of...envy? Surely not. He motioned to a female. \u201cWe must change that.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Smacking bubble gum, a blonde Harpy approached the table. She wore a sequined bra and spandex shorts, her hair braided at the sides in two perfect ropes. \u201cWhat\u2019s up, guys?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe want you to give our friend a lap dance,\u201d the scarred warrior said. Then, to Koldo, \u201cI bet you can\u2019t resist that.\u201d</p><p>Her gaze slid to Koldo. She was a pretty little thing, with wide green eyes and freckles scattered across her nose. He wasn\u2019t into freckles. \u201cYou want me to cozy up to this guy?\u201d she asked, hitching her thumb in his direction.</p> <p>\u201cYes,\u201d Xerxes replied, deadpan.</p><p>\u201cHe looks like a cold-blooded killer.\u201d</p><p>In Koldo\u2019s case, looks were not deceiving. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo of course I\u2019ll give him a lap dance!\u201d</p><p>Wait. What? \u201cNo, thank you. I don\u2019t want\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhoohoo, this is gonna be fun.\u201d She fist-pumped the air. \u201cAre you prepared to soar?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re already in the skies, sweet,\u201d Thane said, clearly fighting a wave of amusement.</p><p>She rolled her eyes. \u201cWhatevs. He knew what I meant. Didn\u2019t you, Killer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would rather you not\u2014\u201d Koldo began, only to be cut off again.</p><p>\u201cMove the table,\u201d the girl said, rubbing her hands together. \u201cI want to get this party train out of the station the right way. And that\u2019s my way, in case anyone missed my meaning.\u201d</p><p>Koldo pinched the bridge of his nose as Bjorn and Xerxes stood to obey the Harpy. Before the warriors could get started, he stiffened.</p> <p>Not because of their intentions, and not because of the Harpy. Deep inside, where instinct sizzled and crackled, he experienced a sudden knowing.</p><p>Nicola was in trouble.</p><p>\u201cI have to go.\u201d He jumped to his feet, accidentally sending the table toppling the floor.</p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s one way to do it,\u201d the girl muttered.</p><p>Zacharel\u2019s orders stated that Koldo was to remain with Thane twenty-three hours a day. If he disobeyed, he risked punishment. He\u2019d already used up his hour away today. \u201cAnd you get to come with me,\u201d he told the warrior, pointing at him to show there would be consequences if he was ignored.</p><p>\u201cWait. You\u2019re leaving right now?\u201d The Harpy\u2019s pink, glittery lips fell into a seductive pout. \u201cBut I haven\u2019t even started yet, and I\u2019ve got some wicked-cool moves. Did I mention I\u2019m very bendy?\u201d</p><p>Thane\u2019s gaze narrowed on Koldo. \u201cWe\u2019re not leaving. We do, and I\u2019ll never get you back here.\u201d</p><p>The warrior had just as much to lose as he did, Koldo realized\u2014and that gave Koldo all the bargaining power he needed. \u201cWe\u2019ll return. You have my word. Until then, you had better follow.\u201d He informed Thane of where to go and flashed to the hospital, but...Nicola wasn\u2019t there. He flashed to her office. She wasn\u2019t there, either. He did, however, spot a Sent One, as well as a girl he didn\u2019t recognize but thought he should.</p> <p>There was no time to question either female. He flashed to Nicola\u2019s house, but his redhead wasn\u2019t there, either. Her second job...nope. Back to the hospital, where he materialized at an empty nurse\u2019s station and used the computer. A good decision. Laila had been moved to a new room.</p><p>Thane landed just in front of him. He tucked his wings at his sides as he looked around. \u201cWhat are we doing here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re waiting for me to conclude my business, and I\u2019m in the process of concluding my business.\u201d</p><p>Without another word, he flashed to Laila\u2019s new room. And that\u2019s when he found Nicola, sobbing over her sister\u2019s body.</p><p>CHAPTER SIX</p><p>KOLDO ASSESSED THE SITUATION quickly. Laila\u2019s heart monitor was racing. There was a sharp odor in the air\u2014the scent of impending death. There was a wheeze to her breathing, even with the machines doing all of the work\u2014the sound of impending death. Though she wasn\u2019t dead, her spirit was already halfway out of her body, about to ascend or descend whatever path she\u2019d chosen for herself.</p><p>She wouldn\u2019t last much longer. Once the spirit was all the way out, the body couldn\u2019t survive.</p><p>Nicola\u2019s forehead rested on the bed, her delicate shoulders shaking as she cried with the intense force of her despair. Despair...a mix of both fear and tension, strengthening both of the toxins. Soon, every demon in the hospital would be hungry to feed off her.</p><p>\u201cNicola,\u201d he said, stepping into the natural realm and becoming visible. His first word to her in all these many days. He shouldn\u2019t have waited until tragedy struck, he realized.</p><p>Her attention whipped up to him, and red, swollen eyes landed on his face. She gasped, \u201cKoldo,\u201d with a big dose of surprise. Her nose was stuffed, her voice no longer smoke and dreams but scratchy. Strands of hair clung to splotchy cheeks. \u201cWhat are you doing here? How did you find me?\u201d</p><p>How could he explain that he\u2019d felt her pain, when he wasn\u2019t sure how or why he\u2019d done so? Ignoring the question, he forced his gaze to move to Laila. \u201cShe\u2019s dying.\u201d</p><p>A pause. A trembling, \u201cYes. I shouldn\u2019t be crying. I knew this was coming.\u201d Nicola covered her face with her hands, wiping away the tears, perhaps even trying to rub away the tension. \u201cShe needs me to be calm. I need me to be calm.\u201d</p><p>So do I.</p><p>\u201cBut...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou hurt,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Sighing, she fell against the back of the chair. She released a breath, drew in another, and her nose wrinkled adorably. \u201cLast time you smelled wonderful. This time you smell like a brothel.\u201d</p><p>He wasn\u2019t embarrassed by the insult. Nothing had ever or would ever embarrass him. He was...overheated. Yes. That\u2019s why his cheeks suddenly felt as though they were on fire. \u201cAnd how do you know what a brothel smells like?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. You smell like what I assume a brothel smells like. Cigarettes and alcohol and conflicting perfumes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy apologies.\u201d The first part of what she\u2019d said at last penetrated. Before, she\u2019d thought he\u2019d smelled wonderful.</p><p>His body tensed, just as before. But there was no urge to inflict pain...he wanted only to touch her, to offer comfort and\u2014he wasn\u2019t sure.</p><p>The beeping from the monitor sped up.</p><p>Nicola traced her fingers over her sister\u2019s hand, then stopped, just stopped, as if the action were too much for her.</p><p>How much strength had she lost since his last visit?</p><p>No matter the amount, the answer was the same. Too much.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you, anyway?\u201d she asked almost absently.</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t figured it out on your own?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. How could I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are many ways.\u201d</p><p>\u201cName one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEasy. A sensitive spirit.\u201d</p><p>She expelled a weary breath. \u201cAll I know is you aren\u2019t human.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCorrect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo why don\u2019t you just tell me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you believe me?\u201d If he admitted he was a Sent One, she would, perhaps, have no idea what that was. If he used the word angel, she might have certain expectations he would be unable to meet. \u201cWe can discuss it later. Right now, why don\u2019t I help your sister?\u201d</p><p>Immediately he wished he could snatch the words back, but did he? No. He\u2019d said them. He would deal with the fallout.</p><p>Eyes as wild and turbulent as a winter storm widened. \u201cHow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...can buy her a little time. She\u2019ll strengthen and she\u2019ll awaken, but I don\u2019t think she\u2019ll live more than a few weeks,\u201d he rushed to add. She had to be swimming with toxins. Not only that, she would still have no internal or external barriers against the demons. Barriers she would have to learn how to erect. Barriers she might not have time to learn how to erect.</p><p>\u201cA few weeks,\u201d Nicola parroted.</p><p>\u201cNot long, I know, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take it!\u201d she shouted, as though she feared he would change his mind.</p><p>So eager for so little. \u201cBut you haven\u2019t yet heard my terms.\u201d</p><p>Her beautiful mouth edged into a frown. \u201cYou want something from me?\u201d</p><p>Many things. \u201cI\u2019ll buy your sister a few weeks, and in exchange you\u2019ll do what I tell you, when I tell you, until the day I release you from my charge.\u201d He had no idea how long it would take him to rid her of the toxins and teach her enough to survive on her own.</p><p>\u201cThat sounds like something I\u2019ve heard on the late-night news. Are you expecting me to become your sex slave?\u201d Her tone wasn\u2019t scandalized, but curious.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he replied with a frown of his own. \u201cI don\u2019t want you in that way.\u201d He didn\u2019t, did he? He hadn\u2019t lied to Thane and the others. He was a virgin. Desire wasn\u2019t something he was familiar with, and he wasn\u2019t sure he would recognize it.</p><p>He knew he admired Nicola\u2019s loyalty to her sister. He knew he wished he had someone who loved him half as much. But seeing her naked was...intriguing, he realized, the blood heating in his veins, becoming molten, scorching him. A heat that had nothing to do with rage. It bubbled up, washing away the cold man he knew himself to be.</p><p>Perhaps he did want her in that way.</p><p>The very idea nearly sent him stumbling backward. His mind reeled. But...but...but she was so dainty, so fragile. He dwarfed her. Could crush her. Why her? Why now? Desire for her was implausible. Impractical.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he croaked. He couldn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d she said, her shoulders slumping. \u201cSo, you want me to obey you when you tell me to...what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStay calm. Embrace peace. Sow joy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is an irrefutable spiritual law that states a person reaps what they sow. Therefore, if you sow joy into others, you will reap joy for yourself. Right now, you need joy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCalm, peace, joy,\u201d she echoed hollowly. As if he were insane.</p><p>Maybe he was. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do you want me to feel those things?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>If you don\u2019t, the toxins will build up, and eventually you\u2019ll die, just like your sister.

Because that I think I can do.\u201d</p><p>Silly human. For the first time in his life, he wanted to smile. \u201cNo.\u201d</p> <p>Desperate, she said, \u201cHow about the number of the coffee shop girl? I could give you that, and we could call it even.\u201d</p><p>Coffee shop girl? \u201cRemember when I told you I could help you heal?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs if I could ever forget.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is the way.\u201d</p><p>A moment passed. A moment she spent blinking at him. \u201cCalm, peace, joy,\u201d she repeated. \u201cTell me my sister will live longer than a few weeks, and it\u2019s done.\u201d</p> <p>As if he was in control of how long her sister survived. But she didn\u2019t know that, and she was trying to buy more time. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I wasn\u2019t clear. I gave you my top offer. There\u2019s nothing more I can do on your sister\u2019s behalf. Therefore, there will be no negotiating of my terms.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI figured, but I had to try.\u201d She offered the same bright smile she\u2019d given him in the elevator, and he had the foresight to capture a mental picture this time. One he would remember on the worst of nights, when the past threatened to rise up and swallow him. She was proof there was more in the world than darkness and pain.</p><p>\u201cDo we have a deal?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cWe do.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cVery well. Don\u2019t allow the doctors to take her off life support. I\u2019ll return shortly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p> <p>He left before she could finish her sentence. Right now, every moment counted.</p><p>He flashed to Thane, who paced in the hospital hallway, and told him where he was going. Then he flashed to Zacharel\u2019s cloud in the lower level of the skies. He had no wings and couldn\u2019t hover outside the entrance to await permission, which was why Zacharel had given him an open invitation to enter\u2014as long as he remained in the foyer.</p><p>\u201cZacharel,\u201d he called. Walls of swirling mist surrounded him, obscuring his vision of the rest of the home. But that\u2019s the way clouds worked. They opened only as you moved through them.</p><p>His commander stepped through the haze, his black hair askew, his robe dirty, torn and speckled with blood. Solid gold wings arched from his back, patches of the feathers missing.</p><p>Protective instincts rose. \u201cWhat happened to you?\u201d Koldo demanded. \u201cDo you require aid?\u201d</p><p>Zacharel\u2019s dark head tilted to the side, his emerald eyes glassy, as if he\u2019d...cried. \u201cNo aid is currently needed. You\u2019ll find out what happened with the rest of the Sent Ones. A meeting will be called very soon, and every army will be there. Until then...what are you doing here, Koldo?\u201d The last was said on a weary sigh.</p><p>Koldo liked and respected Zacharel. The warrior had taken responsibility of the most unruly army in the skies, and wasn\u2019t afraid to get his hands dirty to help each and every one of his men out of trouble.</p><p>\u201cI gave Annabelle a vial of the Water of Life and I need what remains.\u201d</p> <p>Zacharel stared at him for a long while before saying, \u201cWhy do you want it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs there any left?\u201d he asked, refusing to state his reason when he wasn\u2019t yet sure there was a prize to be had.</p><p>Ignoring his question, Zacharel turned and motioned for Koldo to follow.</p><p>After only a few steps, the cloud opened up, revealing a living room suited for the richest of humans, with a velvet-lined couch, one half of it backed and the other half open. It was ideal for any Sent One and human pairing. There was a matching recliner, an intricately carved coffee table made of crystals from all over the world. A tapestry hung on the far wall, the words Perfect Love Casts Out Fear scripted in Greek in the center.</p><p>Clearly Annabelle had decorated\u2014Annabelle, who sat in front of the coffee table, poring through books, furiously writing passages down in a notebook.</p><p>\u201cHey, Koldo,\u201d she said when she glanced up. She had a fall of straight, blue-black hair and rich amber eyes. Her Japanese mother and American father had certainly shared the perfect blend of DNA to create her, he thought, for there wasn\u2019t a single flaw to her exquisite features. And yet, she couldn\u2019t compare with Nicola. A fact that delighted him. Why?</p><p>He inclined his head in greeting.</p><p>Zacharel eased onto the couch behind her, enfolding her between his legs. Refusing to give precedence to the urgency inside him, Koldo claimed the recliner across from them. He had no wings, so the back of the chair offered no restriction to his movements.</p><p>A white-hot pang blistered through his chest.</p><p>\u201cYou asked if there was any left. There is,\u201d Zacharel said.</p><p>\u201cOh, what are we talking about?\u201d Annabelle asked, dropping her pen.</p><p>\u201cHow much?\u201d Koldo insisted, ignoring her.</p><p>\u201cA single drop.\u201d</p><p>Annabelle grinned with delight. \u201cThe Water of Life, then.\u201d</p><p>A drop. That was enough for what Koldo planned. \u201cI wish to purchase it from you.\u201d The words seemed to be pushed through a tunnel of broken glass. He\u2019d shed blood for this liquid. Had lost his hair for it. And now he had to give something else?</p><p>Annabelle had kept her end of the bargain, he reminded himself. She had kept Zacharel out of the heavens while Koldo searched for his mother. The Water was hers. Not his. So yes, he had to give something else.</p><p>\u201cAgain, why?\u201d Zacharel asked.</p><p>\u201cI hope to save a female.\u201d At least for a little while.</p><p>Annabelle tapped a finger against her chin. \u201cHuman?\u201d</p><p>He offered no more. That information wasn\u2019t necessary.</p><p>\u201cThe female you have locked away?\u201d Zacharel asked tightly.</p><p>He knew Koldo had a Sent One trapped somewhere because Koldo had rescued two females from hell, all those weeks ago. His mother, and one of Zacharel\u2019s soldiers. That soldier had been lost to the pain of her injuries and should not have been aware of Koldo\u2019s actions. But aware she had been. And she\u2019d told Zacharel everything she\u2019d witnessed.</p><p>Zacharel had no idea Cornelia was Koldo\u2019s mother, and he had yet to demand Koldo free her. Maybe because he knew Koldo would simply hunt her down again. Instead, he\u2019d kept him busy with all those missions and now the babysitter, hoping to restrain him from any further wrongdoing.</p><p>One day Zacharel might realize nothing could restrain Koldo.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said. \u201cNot the one I have locked away.\u201d Again, he offered nothing more.</p><p>\u201cShe is\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot up for discussion.\u201d</p><p>Zacharel popped his jaw, the very picture of a commander who\u2019d had too much lip from his subordinate. \u201cYou\u2019re supposed to be with Thane, watching him. What are you doing with a human female?\u201d</p><p>So Koldo was to keep Thane from committing a crime, not the other way around? \u201cI\u2019ll return to Thane. You have my word. Now, will you sell the Water to me or not?\u201d</p><p>Emerald eyes crackled with angry flames. \u201cNot.\u201d</p><p>Koldo looked to Annabelle.</p><p>Seemingly delicate shoulders lifted in a shrug. \u201cSorry, but I know better than to tango with Zachy when he\u2019s gone stubborn.\u201d</p><p>No, she didn\u2019t. She tangoed with \u201cZachy\u201d no matter his moods. Koldo had seen her\u2014and he\u2019d seen her win.</p><p>Teeth grinding, Koldo popped to his feet. \u201cVery well.\u201d He would try and purchase a drop of the Water from someone else. If he failed, if he had to approach the Heavenly High Council, he...would not, he thought. He could endure a whipping, no problem, but he still wasn\u2019t sure what sacrifice they would next require.</p><p>Therefore, he had to find someone willing to sell him the Water. If he failed to return and keep his part of the bargain, Nicola would never trust him. And if she never trusted him, she would never listen to him. Never find comfort with him.</p><p>Never reap the joy that she needed so badly.</p><p>He marched out of the living room.</p><p>\u201cKoldo,\u201d Zacharel called.</p><p>He stilled, his muscles knotting from strain. He\u2019s your leader. Show him respect\u2014even though you would enjoy ripping his head from his body. Slowly he turned and faced the warrior. \u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t sell it to you. I will, however, give it to you.\u201d Zacharel reached into an air pocket and withdrew a clear vial. A single bead of Water rolled and glistened at the bottom. \u201cThe very day you gave Annabelle the vial, I poured a drop into a separate container and saved it for you, waiting for the day you would need it. I only pray you use it wisely. It\u2019s a second chance...and I won\u2019t be offering you a third.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER SEVEN</p><p>NICOLA WAS LIGHT-HEADED and close to fainting. Her nerves were frayed, her heart alternating between fluttering painfully and stopping as though squeezed by an iron-hard fist. Koldo had been gone sixteen minutes and thirty-two seconds. During that time the doctor had come back expecting to turn off Laila\u2019s machines. Ending her. Forever.</p><p>How was Nicola to remain calm, embrace peace and sow joy like this?</p><p>She had asked for more time, and the doctor had tried to talk her into hurrying along.</p><p>Laila\u2019s in pain.</p><p>She\u2019s ready to go. Her body can\u2019t endure on its own, and her mind is already gone.</p><p>She\u2019ll never recover from this.</p><p>Nicola had refused him.</p><p>Finally, he had left the room. But he would be back. She knew he would be back.</p><p>If Koldo failed to return in time...</p><p>Laila will die today, she thought, and nearly vomited.</p><p>Her light-headedness increased, and she wasn\u2019t sure she had the strength to remain lucid much longer. If she passed out cold...</p><p>Again, Laila would die.</p><p>If. If. If. How she hated the word! She\u2014</p><p>Koldo stepped into view, as though he\u2019d opened a doorway she couldn\u2019t see.</p><p>Relief speared her, and she leaped to her feet. He was as big and strong as she remembered\u2014maybe bigger, maybe stronger\u2014and he was a warrior. In some kind of army, he\u2019d said. As long as he was here, Laila would be safe. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Except, his eyes held a grim taint.</p><p>Why grim?</p><p>She looked him over, searching for a clue. He wore the same flowing white shirt and pants as before, the same combat boots, looking comfortable, stylish and ready for action. There were no specks of blood to suggest he\u2019d had to fight his way here.</p> <p>All that grim was for Laila, then.</p><p>\u201cKoldo,\u201d she croaked.</p><p>He nodded in acknowledgment. \u201cStop worrying, Nicola.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFirst tell me the bargain stands.\u201d The words rushed out. And wow, had she really put her trust and hope in a stranger like this? A stranger of such dubious origins?</p><p>Yes, actually. She had. Laila\u2019s survival was too important.</p> <p>\u201cIt does,\u201d he assured her.</p><p>Good. That was good. \u201cWhere have you been?\u201d Ugh. Watch the accusation. You don\u2019t want to send him fleeing.</p><p>\u201cHere and there.\u201d</p><p>A lovely nonanswer. \u201cWell, are you sure this will work?\u201d Whatever \u201cthis\u201d was.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure she\u2019ll hurt,\u201d Koldo said, once again ignoring her question, \u201cand she\u2019ll scream, but her body will heal. What happens after that will be up to her. Do you still wish me to proceed?\u201d</p><p>Nicola had a little talent for dissecting tones and unveiling a supposition only hinted at. What had she just gotten from Koldo? He didn\u2019t think the results would be worth the effort. Well, too bad. She did. Laila was worth anything. Her sister deserved a second chance. No matter how short.</p> <p>\u201cI do,\u201d she finally replied.</p><p>\u201cVery well.\u201d Koldo stepped up to the bed and gently pried Laila\u2019s lips apart. He opened his hand to reveal an empty vial...no, not empty. A single droplet of water rolled at the bottom, glistening in the light.</p><p>He placed the vial over Laila\u2019s open mouth, paused. He inhaled sharply, as if trying to force himself to act. His hesitation caused Nicola\u2019s worry to magnify. Maybe this wasn\u2019t the best decision. Maybe she had made the deal with Koldo for her own selfish needs.</p><p>\u201cIs there another\u2014\u201d</p><p>But she was too late. Koldo had just tipped the droplet onto Laila\u2019s tongue.</p><p>Nicola waited, expecting something to happen right away. The screaming he\u2019d promised, perhaps. Or maybe, miraculously, a smile.</p><p>A minute passed, then two, and nothing changed.</p><p>Koldo released a heavy sigh. \u201cIt\u2019s done,\u201d he said, and met her hopeful stare. \u201cI must return to my duties or face\u2014never mind. I shall come to you tomorrow, and your time in my care will begin.\u201d</p> <p>For the third instance in their acquaintance, he vanished.</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>There was no time to lament or rage over his newest defection. Laila unleashed the promised scream. A scream that nearly busted Nicola\u2019s eardrums. Worried all over again, she rushed to her sister\u2019s side. \u201cLaila, darling, what\u2019s wrong? What do you need?\u201d</p><p>Her sister responded with another scream.</p><p>Two nurses burst into the room, both unwinding stethoscopes from around their necks.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d one demanded.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Nicola replied hoarsely. Koldo had fed her sister a drop of...what? Not water, that much she now knew. But she couldn\u2019t mention the warrior without sounding utterly insane.</p><p>And if they doubted her sanity, they would refuse to allow her to see Laila. Laila\u2019s fate would fall into someone else\u2019s hands, and someone else would get to decide to turn the machines off.</p><p>\u201cStep back,\u201d the other said, even giving her a little push.</p><p>They checked the monitors and wheeled a machine closer to the bed. Laila\u2019s entire body began to violently shake.</p><p>\u201cIs she going to be okay?\u201d If Koldo had actually done something to harm her sister, Nicola would... She would... There were no actions vicious enough.</p><p>Another nurse came rushing in. \u201cWhat\u2019s the problem?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet her out of here,\u201d the others commanded, motioning to Nicola.</p><p>Nicola was too weak to fight as she was dragged from the room. The nurse raced back inside, shutting the door, leaving Nicola standing in the hallway. Tears leaked from her eyes, cascading down her cheeks. She flattened her hand over her heart. The flutter was gone, but the beat was too hard, too fast. Black spots began to wink through her vision. Breath singed her lungs even as her blood chilled.</p><p>Her sister was in there, screaming and screaming and screaming, and obviously in more pain than ever. Her sister could be dying right this second, but Nicola wasn\u2019t with her. Only strangers.</p><p>How could she have done this? How could she have risked so much, without knowing more?</p><p>The black spots thickened. Her breath heated another degree, and the chill in her blood turned to ice-thickened sludge. Knowing she would pass out at any moment, Nicola tried to sit down. But her knees gave out a second later, no longer able to hold her weight, and she toppled forward.</p><p>Her face slammed into the tiled floor, and she knew nothing more.</p><p>SOMETHING PRIED NICOLA\u2019S eyelids apart, and a bright light suddenly chased away the darkness. Little details claimed her attention. There was a throb in her temples, a steady beep, beep, beep in her ears and a stream of cold in her arm.</p><p>A voice beckoned to her, but she couldn\u2019t make out the words. A brighter light was flashed over one eye, then the other. She tried to turn away, but her head was too heavy to move. She tried to reach up and push the stupid thing away, whatever it was, but her arm was even heavier.</p><p>She felt as though she\u2019d fallen asleep at the wheel of a car and woken up inside a mangled heap, her weakened body pinned in place. Help had yet to arrive.</p><p>\u201cNicola?\u201d</p><p>Scratch that. Help had arrived.</p><p>She blinked rapidly, and finally managed to focus. A man loomed over her. He had dark hair, dark eyes, and his skin was beautifully black. He wore a lab coat and had a stethoscope draped around his neck. Dr. Carter from County General, she realized. Laila\u2019s doctor.</p><p>\u201cYou fainted,\u201d he said, his tone gentle.</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2014\u201d Had fainted, yes. The memory played through her mind, and she saw herself in Laila\u2019s room. Koldo had fed her sister a droplet of something, then vanished, and her sister had begun to scream. A nurse had shoved Nicola out of the room and fear had overtaken her.</p><p>Now she was lying in a hospital bed, hooked to an IV and wearing a paper-thin gown.</p><p>\u201cYour heartbeat has been regulated,\u201d he informed her.</p><p>Don\u2019t care. \u201cLaila,\u201d she said, trying to sit up.</p><p>Dr. Carter kindly pushed her back down. \u201cYou knocked your skull pretty hard when you landed. In fact, you have a concussion, and we\u2019re going to keep you for the rest of the day and night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLaila,\u201d she repeated, her voice a mere croak.</p><p>His lips curved into a slow smile. \u201cIt\u2019s the most amazing thing. Once we got her calmed down, we noticed her vitals were actually stronger than they\u2019d been in weeks. We drew some blood, and the results astonished us. Her liver and kidneys are finally working properly, and her heartbeat is steady.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe...she...\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust might live,\u201d he confirmed.</p><p>Just like that, undiluted joy burst through Nicola, as potent as any drug. Joy Koldo had sown into her. Laila was on the mend! Koldo had told the truth. He had\u2014</p><p>Saved her twin for a little while, Nicola recalled. Only a little while. Ribbons of disappointment threaded through the joy. He\u2019d said he could buy her sister time, nothing more.</p><p>Before, that had seemed so promising. Now? She wanted more.</p><p>Time. Time. The word echoed through her mind in tune with the ticking of a clock. How much time did her sister have? Koldo had said she wouldn\u2019t live more than a few weeks, and when Nicola peeled back the top layer of those words and peeked inside, she realized Laila could drift away much sooner. In a matter of days.</p><p>Tomorrow, even.</p><p>An hour from now.</p><p>\u201cI want to see her,\u201d she rushed out.</p><p>Dr. Carter\u2019s smile widened as he turned to the side and waved his arm toward the patient in the bed beside hers. \u201cYou can.\u201d</p><p>Her gaze landed on the beautiful blonde buried under a mound of covers, and her joy returned full force. Tears flooded her eyes. Her beloved Laila was stretched out on her side, facing her, the color in her cheeks healthy for the first time in months. Her eyes were closed, her breathing even. Her chest rose and fell on its own, with no help from a machine. Her lips were curved in a grin. A soft, happy grin.</p><p>Nicola had worried for nothing, she realized. In fact, she had actually harmed herself. Had she remained calm and trusted Koldo, she could have enjoyed hearing the news of her sister\u2019s recovery while on her feet. She could have whooped and laughed and watched as Laila strengthened. I\u2019ll never make that mistake again.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a miracle,\u201d Dr. Carter said. \u201cIf she continues to recover at this rate, she should be able to go home in a few days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally. Right now she\u2019s resting, and I suggest you do the same. We\u2019ll be checking on you every few hours.\u201d He reached out, squeezed her hand. \u201cIf you need anything, let us know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will. And thank you.\u201d</p><p>He nodded and strode from the room.</p><p>Nicola stared over at her sister, marveling. How many nights had she and Laila lain awake in the same bed, snuggled up to each other, whispering and sharing secrets? Countless. And they would have that again.</p><p>Laila released a soft sigh and\u2014</p><p>Oh, wow, wow, wow.</p><p>Nicola rubbed at her eyes, but...she could still see an ugly little monkey with tentacles instead of arms perched on the side of Laila\u2019s bed. The creature was glaring at Nicola with hatred in his eyes as he stroked Laila\u2019s arm, as though trying to capture her attention.</p><p>A hallucination? Surely. She was concussed, after all. But...but...it looked so real. Just like the monsters she\u2019d seen as a child.</p><p>Koldo materialized at the side of Nicola\u2019s bed, consuming her attention and overwhelming her thoughts. Any other time, surprise would have jacked up her heartbeat. Because really, she didn\u2019t think she would ever get used to watching a man appear from thin air. But there were currently very strong drugs in her system, preventing any kind of adverse reaction. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDo you see that?\u201d she demanded.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d he replied, looking around.</p><p>The monkey was gone, she realized. \u201cNever mind.\u201d</p> <p>He peered down at her and frowned. \u201cI was granted permission to return, to leave the thorn in my side for another hour, and check on you. Apparently, I\u2019m a beast to be around. And I find you injured?\u201d There was a thread of anger in his tone. \u201cWhy are you injured?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hit my head when I passed out,\u201d she admitted.</p><p>\u201cAnd why did you pass out?\u201d He leaned over and traced calloused fingertips across her forehead, exactly where she\u2019d hit it during her fainting spell. A sharp lance of pain caused her to wince, and he drew back, a gleam of shame in his eyes.</p><p>A part of her mourned the loss of him, pain or not. He\u2019d just given her a nonmedical-related touch, and it was the first she had received since Laila\u2019s admission here. She\u2019d liked it. A lot.</p><p>He was so warm. So vibrant.</p> <p>So...necessary.</p><p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s kind of a funny story.\u201d Suddenly nervous, she twisted the sheet on her bed\u2014and maybe the drugs weren\u2019t so strong, after all, because her heart skipped a beat. \u201cYou see, you had just given my sister that drop of liquid and disappeared, and she had just started screaming\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs I told you she would do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but I wasn\u2019t exactly prepared and...\u201d</p><p>Understanding dawned, lightening those golden eyes to a bright, otherworldly amber. \u201cYou worried.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, yeah. Did I mention Laila was screaming?\u201d</p> <p>His lips pursed. With irritation? she wondered. Yeah. Definitely with irritation. He looked ready to murder her. It probably wouldn\u2019t help his mood if she told him that he suddenly reminded her of a male model flashing Blue Steel. Or Magnum. And that he was really, really, really good-looking. Like, superbeautiful.</p><p>I have to watch less TV on the nights I can\u2019t sleep.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not off to a good start,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>The apology earned her a short, curt \u201cDo better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee that you do.\u201d</p><p>So bighearted of him. \u201cSo, what did you give her?\u201d</p> <p>A pause, then, \u201cI\u2019m not ready to share that information.\u201d</p><p>Judging from the hardness of his tone, he might never be ready. \u201cWell, are you ready to tell me what you are? Besides a soldier, I mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou still have no guess?\u201d he asked, his features darkening with disappointment.</p><p>She bit her lip. \u201cI\u2019ve been busy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLesson number one,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople give priority to what\u2019s important to them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s true, but I have to work two jobs. I\u2019ve had to care for my sister. I\u2019ve had to sleep whenever possible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you couldn\u2019t spare a minute here, and a minute there? Of course you could have! Instead, you give me excuses.\u201d</p><p>And excuses weren\u2019t allowed in Mr. Koldo\u2019s classroom, obviously. He was going to be fun to hang with, wasn\u2019t he? \u201cOh, yeah, well, how am I supposed to do the peace-and-joy thing if you continue to be mean to me?\u201d</p><p>He jolted a step backward, as though shocked. \u201cI\u2019m not mean.\u201d</p><p>She peered at him, doing her best to radiate mock sincerity. \u201cKoldo, do you know the definition of the word mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2018Nasty. Unkind. Cruel.\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe for some. But the Nicola Lane definition is \u2018pain in my rear.\u2019\u201d</p><p>He rubbed the back of his neck. \u201cI will endeavor to be nicer, then.\u201d</p><p>She suddenly felt a little guilty for teasing him. He\u2019d taken her seriously. \u201cWill you at least give me a hint? Maybe tell me where you go when you vanish?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI go to the spirit realm,\u201d he said, watching her intensely.</p><p>\u201cSo...you\u2019re a ghost?\u201d As she\u2019d first suspected?</p><p>He flashed his teeth in a fearsome scowl. \u201cGhosts do not exist.\u201d</p><p>Wow. \u201cO-kay.\u201d There was a glimpse of the Viking pillager from the elevator. The one who had a major beef with lies. \u201cSo you\u2019re not a ghost. Got it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are no ghosts,\u201d he reiterated sharply. \u201cHuman spirits go up or down, but they never linger or come back. What people consider ghosts are actually familiar spirits and familiar spirits are dem\u2014\u201d Sighing, he scrubbed a hand down his face. \u201cNever mind. I have more to teach you than I realized.\u201d</p><p>A bead of worry she\u2019d told herself she wouldn\u2019t feel joined the guilt. \u201cYou won\u2019t change your mind, will you?\u201d</p><p>Annnd he flashed his teeth in yet another fearsome scowl. \u201cHow could I? A bargain was struck.\u201d</p><p>And he was always a man of his word. She\u2019d already known that about him, and had to stop inadvertently insulting his sense of honor. He might stick around no matter what, but she wanted him as happy as she was supposed to be while he was doing it. \u201cWhy do you want to teach someone like me, anyway?\u201d Nicola had nothing to offer in return. \u201cAnd what do you want to teach me? I thought you only wanted me to do the calm, peace, joy thing.\u201d</p><p>He looked away, saying, \u201cPerhaps I know what it\u2019s like to suffer one travesty after another, desperate for hope but discovering none.\u201d He studied her sister for a long while. \u201cI just pray Laila proves to be as accepting as you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould that help her? Save her for more than a few weeks?\u201d A whisper. A desperate rasp.</p><p>\u201cHonestly? Only she knows the answer to that. I can teach her what I teach you\u2014and no, I won\u2019t share the details yet. You\u2019re drugged, and will forget the most important parts. I\u2019ll do everything I possibly can to make her feel calm, at peace and joyful.\u201d A flicker of doubt in his eyes, followed by...anger? He shook his head and added, \u201cBut will she listen?\u201d</p><p>Would she? Laila, who was so stubborn, so hardheaded, she would argue until she ran out of breath. Laila, who possessed the unique ability to tune out anyone at any time. Nicola loved her, but she was highly aware of her faults.</p><p>\u201cWhat you teach us, what we feel, will help us heal?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cYes. I have seen lepers cleansed. I have seen the lame walk and the blind regain their sight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll make her listen, then.\u201d Determination mixed with a heady dose of excitement. Over the years, she had been checked out by hundreds of doctors. A thousand tests had been run. A million procedures and surgeries had been endured. The prognosis had always been the same.</p><p>We\u2019re sorry, Miss Lane, but there\u2019s nothing we can do.</p><p>Now there was hope for Laila, too.</p><p>Koldo\u2019s expression softened as he gazed at her. He actually appeared proud of her. \u201cThe only sure way to fail is to give up, Nicola Lane. You aren\u2019t a quitter, I can tell.\u201d</p><p>A compliment from so blunt a man was sweeter than words of adoration from any charmer.</p><p>\u201cNicola?\u201d</p><p>Nicola jolted at the sound of her sister\u2019s voice. A voice that was rough, the edges broken, but still unbelievably beautiful. \u201cLaila! You\u2019re awake!\u201d</p><p>Koldo stepped back, out of the way, and Nicola\u2019s gaze zipped in her sister\u2019s direction. First thing she noticed, the monkey hadn\u2019t returned. The second thing, Laila was glowing.</p><p>Though their features were identical, Laila had somehow always been the pretty one. The charismatic one. People had always gravitated to her, hanging upon her every word.</p><p>Even Nicola, the serious one, never willing to take a risk, had been enchanted by her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m thirsty,\u201d Laila mumbled. She was still on her side, with her head propped on her pillow, but now her eyelids were opening and closing slowly and repeatedly, as though she were fighting to stay awake. \u201cI\u2019d really like some water.\u201d</p><p>Nicola looked to Koldo. \u201cWill you get\u2014\u201d</p><p>But he was no longer there.</p><p>Laila frowned, her gaze finally remaining open, and said, \u201cWhere\u2019d the doctor go?\u201d</p><p>Doctor? Yeah, the title fit Koldo very well, she thought. \u201cI wish I knew.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER EIGHT</p><p>LAILA WOULD BE COMING home today, far earlier than anyone had expected!</p><p>Nicola could barely contain her excitement as she puttered around her office, gathering the files and receipts she needed. Even the fact that Jamila and Sirena were the worst coworkers of all time and Nicola was carrying just as heavy as load as before failed to dampen her good mood. She could do the most pressing tasks tonight, after she had tucked Laila into bed and finished grocery shopping. Who needed sleep, anyway?</p><p>\u201cJamila,\u201d she called.</p><p>Silence.</p><p>\u201cSirena?\u201d</p><p>Again silence.</p><p>Sighing, Nicola closed her bag. Between half-hour bathroom breaks and two-hour-long lunch sabbaticals, the girls barely had time to sit at their desks.</p><p>\u201cYour forehead is healing nicely. I\u2019m pleased.\u201d</p><p>Nicola\u2019s head snapped up, her gaze colliding with the golden brown of Koldo\u2019s. Instantly her heart sped into a frenzied beat. \u201cYou\u2019re here.\u201d</p><p>Last night she\u2019d lain in that hospital bed thinking about him, wanting so badly to hear his voice, to draw in his scent, to feel his heat, to lean on his intensity. His honesty. His strength.</p><p>Now he was standing just in front of her desk, wearing a black shirt and pants, the dark shade the perfect contrast to the bronze of his skin, making him more beautiful than any model and sexy in a way that should have been illegal. Seriously. Giant warrior man had her drooling. He was total Drogo hot.</p><p>A scar bisected the side of his forehead, adding an air of danger. His lashes were thick and black. His nose was aristocratic, regal, and she\u2019d never been one to think beards were a male must-have, but Koldo changed her mind, the dark shadow accentuating the masculine purity of his jaw.</p><p>His head tilted to the side, his study of her intensifying. \u201cYou\u2019re a strange mix of emotion and energy today. Happy yet anxious, enthusiastic yet fatigued.\u201d Expression stern, he added, \u201cYou must take better care of yourself, Nicola. That\u2019s an order.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She cleared her throat and shifted in her seat. \u201cYes, well, I\u2019m waiting for you to teach me how. Hint, hint.\u201d That was the safest response.</p><p>He remained stoic as he turned and walked to the far wall, where he traced his finger over the peeling paint.</p><p>Hands trembling, she smoothed the wrinkles from the white cotton button-up she wore. Yes, he\u2019d said he wasn\u2019t interested in her romantically, and that was fine. Really. She hadn\u2019t wanted to pout about it or anything like that\u2014or try and change his mind. Therefore, she wasn\u2019t sure why she\u2019d raced home from the hospital to shower and dress, spending a little extra time on her makeup and hair, just in case he showed up. Really.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I came to discuss with you,\u201d he said. \u201cI hoped to begin your training today, but that\u2019s proven impossible. I have just returned from a mission, and have been unable to prepare.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA mission? Oh. What kind?\u201d she asked, trying for a casual tone.</p><p>He rolled his shoulders, saying, \u201cThe kind that involves an army.\u201d</p><p>Fighting some kind of enemy? \u201cUsing guns?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDaggers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf a sort.\u201d He strode to the only window and checked the lock. \u201cBeginning tomorrow, I\u2019ll require half an hour out of your day, every day. You\u2019ll devote yourself to me, and only to me.\u201d</p><p>Just half an hour? Surely that wasn\u2019t disappointment swimming laps in her veins. \u201cIt\u2019s yours. But are you sure that\u2019s enough? I mean, don\u2019t we have a lot of ground to cover?\u201d</p><p>He stiffened, saying, \u201cWe do.\u201d He massaged the back of his neck. \u201cI\u2019ll give you forty-five minutes and\u2014\u201d He shook his head, narrowed his eyes. \u201cThat\u2019s not enough, either, is it? I\u2019ll give you...an hour.\u201d The last was gritted from him, as if granting her an hour was a hard decision to make.</p><p>Half of her was insulted. The other half of her was too excited to care. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd when we\u2019re apart,\u201d he continued, as if she hadn\u2019t spoken, \u201cyou\u2019ll not worry. You\u2019ll not stress, as you humans say. You\u2019ll do only the things that make you happy.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGreat in theory, but how do you suggest I go about that?\u201d</p><p>He faced her, his brow furrowing as he considered her words. \u201cPerhaps you should listen to jokes.\u201d</p><p>A stellar idea from Mr. Serious, she thought drily. \u201cThat\u2019s all you\u2019ve got? I thought you had all the answers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpend time with your sister. She\u2019s better, I\u2019m guessing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe is.\u201d Nicola had told her sister about Koldo and his claims, and her sister had laughed, thinking either the drugs or the concussion or both were messing with her mind. Nothing she\u2019d said had been able to convince the girl otherwise. \u201cShe might need some convincing to take you seriously, but don\u2019t worry. I\u2019ll convince her.\u201d The alternative was to watch her sister die, and she simply wasn\u2019t going to allow that to happen.</p><p>Koldo closed the distance and flattened his hands on her desk. She had to fist her slacks to stop herself from reaching out and tracing her fingertips along his jaw. Just how would he respond to something like that?</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll do everything I tell you?\u201d he asked sharply.</p><p>\u201cEverything.\u201d No hesitation. \u201cWe\u2019ve gone over this.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNever hurts to double-check.\u201d His gaze dropped to her lips and stayed. \u201cSo pink,\u201d he whispered, and frowned. \u201cSo pretty.\u201d</p><p>Her palms began to sweat. He was peering at her as if she were splayed on a buffet table, a sign that read All You Can Eat for Free flashing overhead. As if he were starving.</p><p>Had he changed his mind about wanting her in \u201cthat\u201d way?</p><p>He inhaled deeply, and blinked. His nose wrinkled as if he\u2019d just encountered something unpleasant. \u201cWhy do you smell like that?\u201d His tone was cutting.</p><p>\u201cLike what?\u201d Toxic waste?</p><p>\u201cJasmine and honeysuckle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh, it\u2019s from a new soap and lotion.\u201d The one Sirena had given her.</p><p>\u201cNever use them again. That is your first order. In fact, throw them out.\u201d</p><p>No, he hadn\u2019t changed his mind.</p><p>A knock echoed through the room, and Nicola somehow managed to tug herself from the beastly magnetism of his face to glance toward the left.</p><p>The door was open, allowing Sirena to peek inside without any prompting from her. \u201cHey, Nicola,\u201d she said with a wide, toothy grin\u2014a grin that slowly faded as her gaze swept through the office. \u201cI thought I heard you talking to someone, but never saw anyone come in.\u201d</p><p>Nicola\u2019s attention darted to Koldo. Or rather, to where Koldo had been standing. He was gone, leaving only a waft of his sunshine scent in the air. He\u2019d taken his heat with him, and Nicola shivered, suddenly cold and, well, somewhat bereft.</p><p>\u201cI thought you were on a break,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI was, until I realized you\u2019d be lost without me.\u201d Admitted unabashedly and with total conviction. \u201cOf course, I hurried to return.\u201d</p><p>Lost? Seriously? That\u2019s what the girl believed? Three times this morning Nicola had heard Sirena misdirect a caller. The other four times the phone had rung, the girl had let it roll to voice mail. \u201cWhat can I do for you, Sirena?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust wanted you to know Mr. Turner is here to see you.\u201d She cupped her hand around her mouth and whispered, \u201cAnd he\u2019s looking mighty fine. You should totally tap that.\u201d</p><p>Dex was here? Why? \u201cThanks for letting me know. Please send him in.\u201d</p><p>Sirena winked, and turned with an exaggerated sway of her hips. \u201cYou can go in now, Mr. Hot Stuff.\u201d</p><p>Annnd Nicola jotted down \u201cChat with Sirena about sexual harassment\u201d on her to-do list. She underlined, circled and starred.</p><p>A few seconds later, Dex soared inside. His dark hair was combed, not a strand out of place. His eyes were bright, despite their dark color. He wore a gray button-up shirt and black slacks. Very businessman. Very attractive. But had he been standing next to Koldo, he would have paled in comparison.</p><p>He would have also probably peed his pants in fear.</p><p>Stop that. \u201cHey, Dex,\u201d Nicola said. Now that Koldo was gone, her earlier rush to leave resurfaced. Her attention returned to her bag. Files were sticking out the top. \u201cWhat can I do for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hear your sister is all better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot all, not quite yet, but she\u2019s on the mend.\u201d</p><p>He sat down, leaned back and relaxed, fitting his hands over his middle. \u201cThat\u2019s good, right? You\u2019ll have more free time now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, I\u2019ll have less.\u201d She would be spending every spare second with Laila\u2014and an hour a day with Koldo.</p><p>What the heck was he?</p><p>She needed a sensitive spirit to discover the answer, he\u2019d said. Well, that seemed way complicated\u2014so she\u2019d given in and tried the internet. But a search for an invisible warrior who could heal with happiness had mostly yielded articles about soldiers suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder.</p><p>\u201c\u2014this weekend?\u201d</p><p>Dex\u2019s voice pulled her out of her head. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, what?\u201d</p><p>His cheeks reddened in the slightest degree. \u201cI was wondering if you had any plans this weekend?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Yes. I have paperwork,\u201d she said. Plus, there was her second job at the grocery store.</p><p>\u201cYeah, but you also have to eat.\u201d</p><p>Actually, food was optional. \u201cI\u2019ve got Laila, and that means\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019ll need a date, too. Good news is, I have a friend,\u201d he interjected. \u201cI\u2019m sure you heard that Blaine and his girlfriend broke up a few months ago, and even though he forced me to eat that crap in the fridge after our race, I still like him.\u201d</p><p>Blaine. Blaine, who Laila would find too cute to resist.</p><p>Would Laila be strong enough to leave the house, though? And if so, could Nicola actually deny her sister a little fun before she...before she... Anyway. What if that fun led to the necessary happiness?</p><p>Maybe Dex sensed that she verged on capitulation. Boasting a half grin, he leaned forward and wrote something on a piece of paper. \u201cHere\u2019s my number. Call me if you change your mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>He stood and strode to the door, only to pause and say, \u201cBy the way, you smell really nice.\u201d He kicked back into motion.</p><p>\u201cSee you later, handsome,\u201d Sirena said from the reception area.</p><p>\u201cUh, sure thing,\u201d Dex replied, clearly uneasy.</p><p>So...Koldo thought she smelled terrible, and Dex thought she smelled nice. Who was right?</p><p>Koldo the Honest, no question.</p><p>She sighed. The phone rang as she was gathering the rest of her things.</p><p>The phone was still ringing when she stepped out of the office. Sirena and Jamila were standing in the gap between their desks, their noses touching as they glared and huffed and puffed at each other. Hands were fisted; limbs were trembling.</p><p>\u201cI know what you are,\u201d Sirena snapped.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t say the same,\u201d Jamila hissed, \u201cbut I know you\u2019re bad news.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want to survive this? You\u2019ll leave and never come back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis time, I can say the same.\u201d</p><p>The two clearly had history. \u201cIs someone going to get that?\u201d Nicola asked, the weight of the files already causing her to pant.</p><p>The women jumped apart as if she\u2019d prodded them with hot pokers.</p><p>Sirena tossed her a smile, all hint of rage gone. \u201cSure thing,\u201d she said, strolling to her desk to pick up the phone. \u201cAccounting.\u201d As she eased into her chair, she twirled the cord between her fingers. \u201cWell, don\u2019t you just have the sweetest voice.\u201d A girlish giggle caused Nicola to cringe. \u201cYeah. I am. Wait. Tell me slower so I can be sure to transcribe every riveting word.\u201d</p><p>Nicola faced Jamila, who was still standing in place, still struggling to control her darker emotions. \u201cI won\u2019t ask what that was about, and I also won\u2019t be back until late tomorrow. All I want is for the two of you to refrain from eating kittens, kicking puppies and boiling rabbits just to strike at each other.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d Jamila demanded, ignoring the insult. \u201cYou\u2019re not scheduled to leave for another three hours and eight minutes.\u201d</p><p>How cute. The girl most likely to be voted Useless was questioning her ethics. \u201cNot that it\u2019s any of your business, but I\u2019m going home. And I\u2019ve already gotten permission, thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy are you leaving? And why are you taking those files?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAgain, it\u2019s none of your business.

You haven\u2019t so far.\u201d</p><p>Jamila popped her jaw. \u201cJust give them to me.\u201d She grabbed the strap of the bag before Nicola could respond. \u201cI\u2019ll make sure they\u2019re done. Properly,\u201d she spat at Sirena, who was still on the phone, giggling.</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2014\u201d Nicola pressed her lips together. Per Koldo\u2019s orders, she needed less stress in her life. \u201cFine. Just...please don\u2019t let me down.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not unreliable,\u201d the girl snapped.</p><p>Was she unaware that there were other ways to speak to people?</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Nicola said, and soared from the office.</p><p>\u201cWait. Nicola,\u201d Sirena called, stopping her. She slammed the receiver into place.</p><p>Impatient, Nicola backtracked. \u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m happy to help Jamila out.\u201d Sirena smiled sweetly at Jamila, who clicked her teeth in anger. \u201cSince you\u2019re the senior member here, I\u2019d like your permission to take half the files.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSure, that\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p><p>As Jamila sputtered in outrage, Nicola made her escape.</p><p>The building was set in a circular pattern, with winding hallways, multiple offices and very few exits. The elevators were always crammed, and she hated being squeezed inside like a pickle in a jar, conflicting perfumes battling it out for the title of Most Annoying Scent, but she couldn\u2019t take the stairs. She was twenty floors up and would pass out halfway down.</p><p>When she reached the parking garage, a quick walk took her to her old, beat-up sedan, a car out of place among the newer-model vehicles surrounding it. Bucket, she\u2019d named the rust heap better suited for scrap metal than travel. She started the engine and, after the expected blast of backfire, pressed the gas\u2014only to slam on the brake.</p><p>A monster stood just in front of the hood.</p><p>She yelped, her hand flattening over her thumping heart. He was a study of terrifying ugliness, with the body of a steroid-loving man, and a horn curling from the right side of his head. At one time, he must have had two. There was a stump on the left side. He had fur rather than flesh, and eyes as dark as the worst kind of nightmare.</p><p>His lips pulled back from his teeth in a parody of a smile, revealing long, sharp fangs. \u201cYou\u2019re mine, and I always kill what\u2019s mine,\u201d he said\u2014just before vanishing.</p><p>KOLDO SHUT HIMSELF in the luxurious bedroom Thane had given him at the Downfall, and sprawled atop the massive velvet-draped bed. Thane, Bjorn and Xerxes were in their suite of rooms with the day\u2019s chosen females, and he knew he wouldn\u2019t see them again until morning.</p> <p>That was probably for the best.</p><p>His too-short visit with Nicola had left him raw.</p><p>Her smoke-and-dreams voice still caused every muscle in his body to tense and hum. Once again he\u2019d been able to sense her underlying scent of cinnamon and vanilla, an intoxicating fragrance no longer masked by the taint of the demons. Instead, it had been overlaid by the malodors that reminded him of his mother. Jasmine and honeysuckle. Far worse than sulfur.</p><p>And yet, he\u2019d forgotten that fact when he\u2019d peered at her lips. His own had softened in preparation for...something. A kiss, perhaps. A swift pressing together, or maybe a slow melding.</p><p>And what if he\u2019d given in? He knew nothing about the art of kissing. He could have pressed too firmly, and hurt her. He could have pressed too gently, and left her wanting.</p><p>He would have made a fool of himself.</p><p>She might have laughed. And if she\u2019d laughed...</p><p>Another rejection, he thought, his hands fisting. It would have been one of thousands\u2014and thousands more to come. He was never good enough, and couldn\u2019t ever be. He was never what the people he most wanted to love him needed, and couldn\u2019t ever be.</p><p>He sucked in a breath as a portion of his words registered. I don\u2019t want Nicola to love me. He didn\u2019t need her love.</p><p>He didn\u2019t need anyone\u2019s love.</p><p>Whatever Nicola made him feel, it had to stop. The heat. The tingling. The craving for the unknown.</p><p>He jolted to a sitting position. He would exercise until he shook too badly to stand. That would stop everything.</p><p>Thane burst through the double doors. The warrior\u2019s hair stuck out in spikes and his skin was scratched and laden with bite marks, but his robe had morphed into battle armor.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s higher than usual demonic activity at a building in Kansas,\u201d the soldier said, not taking time for preliminaries. \u201cWe\u2019re being sent to investigate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKansas?\u201d Where Nicola lived. Koldo leaped to his feet, his own robe shrinking, tightening and thickening, becoming a lightweight metal that would shield him from the poisonous claws of his opponents. \u201cWe just came from there.\u201d He glanced at the clock. Three hours ago, he realized with a bead of shock. How quickly time had passed. \u201cWhere in Kansas?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDowntown Wichita. Estell\u00e4 Industries.\u201d</p><p>One of Nicola\u2019s employers, housed in the building Koldo had just visited. This couldn\u2019t be a coincidence. Had Lefty and Righty returned with their friends?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll fly you,\u201d Thane said, and motioned him over.</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d Koldo flashed. He had a sword of fire palmed and at the ready the moment his feet hit the sidewalk outside, but...</p><p>There was nothing. No evidence of a demon attack.</p><p>Frowning, he stalked around the perimeter. All around him were red buildings, white buildings, tall buildings, short buildings and even a chapel. There were multiple cars on the road, some parked, some meandering. Trees, patches of grass. Birds in the air and on the ground. The singing of insects. But no hissing, cursing, or scraping to signal demonic activity. No caresses of evil.</p><p>He inhaled sharply. No hint of sulfur.</p><p>Whoosh. Whoosh. Whoosh.</p><p>He spun, finding Thane, Bjorn and Xerxes had just landed, their wings outstretched, each male alive with anticipation over the coming kills.</p><p>Whoosh. Whoosh. Whoosh.</p><p>Again he turned. Zacharel, Axel and Malcolm had just landed. The only one missing from the \u201cinner circle,\u201d as he\u2019d heard Thane describe the warriors Zacharel relied on most, was Magnus, Malcolm\u2019s brother.</p><p>\u201cNo humans are to be harmed,\u201d Zacharel said. They were the same six words he announced before every battle. Sadly, the repetition was a necessity. Humans wouldn\u2019t be able to see Sent Ones, or feel the sting of their weapons, unless the warriors purposely manifested in the natural realm.</p><p>In the past, several warriors had manifested, caring little for collateral damage, too desperate to make a kill.</p><p>What would happen if one of the warriors harmed Nicola?</p><p>Just in case anyone thought to override Zacharel\u2019s instructions, Koldo found himself adding, \u201cIf a single female is harmed today, I will remove the head of the culprit. And I\u2019ll take my time doing it. And don\u2019t think for a moment a fear of consequences will mean anything to me.\u201d</p><p>Six sets of eyes darted to him, some wide with confusion, some narrowed with aggression. He refused to waste precious seconds explaining and stalked into the building, misting through the brick walls rather than dealing with a door. Humans of every race and size strolled through the foyer and hallways. Males, females, anywhere from eighteen to seventy it seemed.</p><p>Some were demon-oppressed, as Laila had been. The creatures had created a stronghold.</p><p>Some were demonically influenced, as Nicola had been. The creatures were trying to create a stronghold.</p><p>A smorgasbord of temptation for the warriors, he knew. Already he fought the urge to appear and strike everyone in his path. Calm. Steady.</p><p>Koldo searched every inch of the place, but found no sign of Nicola. Her office was empty. And she\u2019d left no notes on her calendar.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing, going through Nicola\u2019s things?\u201d a female demanded from behind him.</p><p>He recognized the voice and slowly turned, coming face-to-face with the woman who had been trapped in hell with his mother. The woman he had rescued and brought back from the brink of death.</p><p>The woman who had yet to thank him, and who had instead run to Zacharel, outing the fact that Koldo had locked another Sent One away.</p><p>Once a joy-bringer, she was now a warrior. One of Zacharel\u2019s warriors, to be exact. Jamila. Arabic for beautiful. And she certainly was. She was beautiful and elusive, but she was as sharp as he was. They were two blades and constantly sliced each other to ribbons.</p><p>\u201cYou know Nicola Lane? Where is she?\u201d he demanded. Fury... A dark, terrible fury was boiling inside him, threatening to spew out. If she had been harmed, he would...what? Tear this place apart? Probably. Kill everyone inside? Maybe. He still couldn\u2019t bring himself to care about the consequences.</p><p>Calm down. Get your answers first.</p><p>\u201cShe went home.\u201d Jamila\u2019s chin lifted, a show of irritation. \u201cNow it\u2019s your turn to answer my question. What are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>If she was home, she was safe. \u201cI could ask you the same,\u201d he said, relaxing.</p><p>\u201cBut it\u2019s not your turn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo.\u201d She folded her arms over her chest and glared at him. \u201cZacharel told me to report what happens to Nicola while she\u2019s at Estell\u00e4. I tried staying in the spiritual realm, watching her, but I\u2019m pretty sure she sensed me. She tensed every time I drew near.\u201d</p><p>She was always tense. But they would work on that. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI decided to give the natural realm a shot,\u201d Jamila finished.</p><p>\u201cWhy would Zacharel want you to spy on Nicola?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t offer an explanation, and I didn\u2019t care enough to ask.\u201d</p> <p>Well, Koldo cared. He would ask. He had to know. This couldn\u2019t be a coincidence.</p><p>\u201cNow,\u201d Jamila said, \u201cyou\u2019re not getting another answer from me until I get one from you.\u201d</p><p>What was he doing here? \u201cAn alarm was raised, and we were told there was an increase of demon activity.\u201d</p><p>She frowned, saying, \u201cThe alarm wasn\u2019t issued by me. The place has been crawling with evil since day one, but it hasn\u2019t increased.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why were we called?\u201d he demanded, a burst of frustration making him what the humans would call cranky. Already he could feel his knuckles preparing for contact with a wall. The more jagged the better. \u201cAnd who would have issued such a report?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLike anyone ever tells me anything,\u201d she spat bitterly. \u201cEver since my\u2014\u201d The angry sparkle dulled in her eyes, and her shoulders hunched with defeat. \u201cNever mind.\u201d</p><p>Ever since her...what? Her capture and rescue? People had treated her differently? Gently? As if afraid she would break? Probably. That\u2019s how they\u2019d been with him, and he\u2019d hated it. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to dread such treatment from me. You annoyed me before, and you annoy me now. Treating you sweetly is the last thing I want to do.\u201d</p><p>Her expression softened, but only slightly. \u201cThanks. That\u2019s kind of you to say.\u201d</p><p>Footsteps echoed behind them, clomping and hard, the culprit clearly not even trying to be stealthy. \u201cWe\u2019ve never had a false alarm before,\u201d Axel said as he snaked a corner and sauntered into the room. His hair was disheveled, three bleeding claw marks in his cheek. \u201cBut word is, this one came from a giggling female.\u201d</p><p>All females giggled\u2014all but Nicola. They would work on that, too. \u201cYou killed the demons without harming the humans, correct?\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, no killing was done on my part.\u201d A shimmer of humor danced in those electric blues. \u201cI found a date for Saturday night.\u201d His gaze slid to Jamila, and his lips quirked up at the corners. \u201cI was planning an evening for two, but say the word, princess, and I\u2019ll make it an evening for three. You, the other girl and my camera phone.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re disgusting.\u201d Jamila pushed him out of the way and stomped from the room.</p><p>\u201cIs that a yes?\u201d Axel tossed out.</p><p>\u201cArgh!\u201d was her only response.</p><p>Axel chuckled. \u201cFeisty little thing, isn\u2019t she? I think I\u2019ll tame her just for grins and bragging rights.\u201d</p><p>He hoped to have sex with her, walk away and never look back? \u201cYou won\u2019t go near her,\u201d Koldo found himself barking.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Axel asked, blinking at his vehemence. \u201cYou want her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you don\u2019t want me to have her?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cExactly.\u201d</p><p>A pause. A shrug. \u201cFair enough. But what about the girls from the hospital? Are they available?\u201d</p><p>The name Axel was Hebrew for peaceful. In the warrior\u2019s case, the name was a flat-out lie. Koldo grabbed him by the collar and tossed him through the wall.</p><p>\u201cWas it something I said?\u201d Axel grumbled, his voice drifting through the untouched wood and plaster.</p><p>Wiping his hands after a job well-done, Koldo followed in Jamila\u2019s footsteps. He knew Axel had the necessary skills to fight him, savagely and without mercy\u2014and he wasn\u2019t exactly sure who would win. So the male\u2019s easygoing attitude toward him mystified him.</p><p>He rounded the corner, only to see Thane pacing. The blond appeared harried, his usual I-want-a-little-wicked-with-my-breakfast-lunch-and-dinner facade gone. Had something happened?</p><p>As Koldo closed in, the entire building shook, and a rumble ripped through the air. Human voices rose in sudden panic. Koldo stopped, frowned. The shaking continued, intensifying. A chorus of pained shouts sounded from above, in the sky.</p><p>Then, everything stilled, quieted.</p><p>He kicked back into motion. An earthquake? Here? Now? And one that affected the skies? But...that couldn\u2019t be right.</p><p>Thane spotted him and paused. \u201cWhat was that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo clue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, it doesn\u2019t matter anyway. Zacharel\u2019s trying to find out why we were sent here, when clearly there wasn\u2019t a real threat. In the meantime, we\u2019re to go home. My home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d He would first check on Nicola, just to be sure all was well.</p><p>Because...a demon could have followed her home, he realized. There was a time Koldo would have done something like that. He would have followed his intended victim. He would have struck at the perfect time, away from the person\u2019s protection.</p><p>A demon could have harmed her. And here Koldo was, standing in a hallway, doing nothing. Punching the walls hardly seemed violent enough. He wanted to strangle himself!</p><p>The screams of the innocent...all the people he\u2019d hurt...all the people he\u2019d killed...suddenly rose in his mind.</p><p>Thane eyed him suspiciously. \u201cYou\u2019re planning an extra stop, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Koldo vanished without another word, appearing in the small, run-down house with threadbare carpet and well-used furnishings so dreadful he wouldn\u2019t have put them inside the cage with his mother.</p><p>He heard a sound\u2014other than the screams.</p><p>He stomped forward and found Nicola in the bedroom closest to the living room. She was humming under her breath, tucking her sister into bed. And she was lovely in a way that should have been impossible.</p><p>\u201cDo we have any chocolate?\u201d Laila asked, the words slightly slurred, either from exhaustion or medication.</p><p>\u201cNot yet, but we will. I\u2019m headed to the store.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the best, Co Co.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because I got all of Mom\u2019s and Dad\u2019s good DNA,\u201d Nicola teased. \u201cYou got stuck with the leftovers.\u201d</p><p>Laila laughed, even as her eyes closed. Koldo\u2019s lips twitched at the corners.</p><p>\u201cLove you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLove you, too.\u201d</p><p>He should leave. He had no right to stand here, watching, amused, while the blood of the past dripped from him and onto the floor. Splattered here, splattered there, staining every place he looked.</p><p>His fists found their way to his eyes, and he stumbled backward. He flashed to his bedroom in Thane\u2019s club, and collapsed on the floor, laboring for every inhalation. He was dirty; Nicola was pure. He was ice; Nicola was fire.</p><p>And he was in big trouble. Once again, he wanted to kiss her.</p><p>Argh! He shouldn\u2019t want anything from her. He couldn\u2019t want more from her. He wasn\u2019t good for her. Wasn\u2019t good enough.</p><p>He would help her, but he would have to be sure to keep her at a distance. He would help her\u2014and then he would cut her loose.</p><p>How he would react to that, he wasn\u2019t sure. But it wouldn\u2019t be pretty.</p><p>CHAPTER NINE</p><p>BEFORE LEAVING THE DOWNFALL, Thane had asked his lover to remain in his bed, so that she was where he wanted her when he returned. She had acquiesced. Now, upon his return, he looked her over. Hair of gold and scarlet spilled over his pillows, the strands reminding him of living flames. Thin chains forged by an immortal blacksmith encased her wrists and ankles.</p><p>They were slave bands, the metal compelling her to obey whatever commands her owner issued. He despised slavery, and had tried to remove them. He\u2019d failed.</p><p>And he was still angry over that fact.</p><p>He\u2019d had to listen, helpless, as demons had violated Xerxes. He\u2019d had to watch, helpless, as demons had hung Bjorn over him, peeled the skin from the warrior\u2019s entire body and danced around the room in the \u201cflesh coat.\u201d He\u2019d had to lie on the floor, chained, unable to fight, as those same demons had licked the warrior\u2019s blood off his chest and legs.</p><p>To scream was to make the demons laugh.</p><p>To beg for mercy was to make the demons laugh.</p><p>Laugh, laugh, laugh. That\u2019s all they\u2019d done.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t gotten to hurt the creatures as he\u2019d so desperately craved. But what was worse? They hadn\u2019t harmed him as they\u2019d harmed the others. His only pain had been mental, emotional.</p><p>He would have preferred the physical.</p><p>\u201cHurry,\u201d she beseeched, writhing atop the mattress. \u201cI\u2019ve been thinking about all the things you\u2019re going to do to me, and I need you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou need my money,\u201d he said, disrobing. Kendra had been found in the sex district and purchased by Bjorn. The warrior had intended to set her free, but she\u2019d desired a keeper\u2014and the coin that came with him. A job Thane had welcomed.</p><p>\u201cMaybe at first.\u201d She slid her fingertip along an indecent trail. \u201cBut I\u2019ve grown addicted to your touch. I need you. Only you.\u201d</p><p>That was good. Wasn\u2019t it? He might take a thousand different lovers in a week, it sometimes seemed, but he always came back to this one. She wasn\u2019t ashamed of what they did, and never looked at him with horror in her eyes afterward. So why did he feel sick to his stomach?</p><p>He settled his weight on the bed and crawled up...up. Every inch closer to her, the desire to wound intensified. The desire to be wounded intensified.</p><p>The things he\u2019d been denied inside that prison cell.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t foolish. He knew that was why he felt this way. Knew that was why he lashed out. And he would have hated himself for the desires, but the results pleased him far too well. For a moment, only a moment, he would bask in a satisfaction he couldn\u2019t find anywhere else.</p><p>It was fleeting, but it was enough. At least, that\u2019s what he told himself.</p><p>\u201cYou need me, too,\u201d she added. \u201cI\u2019m the only one who can please you.\u201d</p><p>No. That wasn\u2019t true.</p><p>He didn\u2019t want it to be true. Females were too mercurial. They loved one minute, and hated another. They smiled, and then they cried. He couldn\u2019t allow himself to depend on what he couldn\u2019t control. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She bit the end of his chin. \u201cYou\u2019ll never be satisfied with anyone else. They\u2019re too tame.\u201d</p><p>His blood heated with anger\u2014and arousal. \u201cAnyone can please me. Anytime. Any way.\u201d And he would prove it.</p><p>With intense focus, he set out to do the things normal males did to their women. Kissing tenderly, touching gently. She couldn\u2019t resist and melted into the moment, whispering encouragements, moaning, but...half an hour passed with more of the same, and while her excitement intensified, his dwindled.</p><p>Why? Why couldn\u2019t he like this?</p> <p>\u201cOh, Thane,\u201d she breathed, wiggling underneath him. \u201cI never knew you could be this way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...can\u2019t,\u201d he replied through gritted teeth. A thin sheen of sweat covered his skin. The urge to do things to her...horrible things...bombarded him. She would cry and she would beg. But he would show no mercy. Afterward, she would make him cry and beg. But she would show no mercy. He wouldn\u2019t let her. Then...then he would feel.</p><p>He should be ashamed. Bjorn and Xerxes were. They hated what they did to themselves. Hated more what they did to their women.</p><p>With a shout of frustration, Thane severed contact with Kendra and rose from the bed\u2014before either of them found satisfaction. He was shaking as he jerked his robe over his head and covered his nakedness. The material conformed to the tendons in his wings and fell softly to the floor.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you?\u201d she gasped out. \u201cThat was good.\u201d</p> <p>No. No, it wasn\u2019t.</p><p>A sharp gleam entered her eyes. \u201cAre you planning to hook up with another woman and try again?\u201d Bitterness blasted from her.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s none of your concern.\u201d She had known what she was getting with him before she\u2019d agreed to stay.</p><p>\u201cYou should be nicer to me,\u201d she huffed, punching at the comforter. \u201cI might decide to leave you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI might show you to the door.\u201d And he wouldn\u2019t mourn the loss of her. He would miss her utter lack of inhibition, yes. But the woman herself? No. He was attached to Bjorn and Xerxes, and there was no room in his life for another.</p><p>He stepped from the bedroom, and as she screeched his name, he shut the door, cutting her off. He entered the parlor he shared with his boys. They were perched in the red velvet recliners he\u2019d found in India, their feet propped on the crystal table one of the club\u2019s patrons had lost in a poker game.</p> <p>The two had already finished with their women and were drinking. Ambrosia-laced whiskey, in Bjorn\u2019s case, and...he sniffed...vodka in Xerxes\u2019.</p><p>Both were trembling and pale. Xerxes\u2019 cheeks had hollowed, and Thane knew the warrior had recently vomited. Bjorn\u2019s eyes had dulled from corrupted memories.</p><p>The touch of another always reminded the warriors of the horrifying things done to them down in that hellish dungeon. And yet still they plowed through as many females as Thane. Perhaps trying to prove they were normal, he realized now. He\u2019d always assumed they hoped to punish themselves for what they\u2019d once failed to stop.</p><p>He poured himself a shot of vodka and eased into the chair across from his friends.</p><p>\u201cKoldo is looking for you,\u201d Bjorn said after draining what remained in his glass.</p><p>A man could only deal with so much in one day, and as stubborn and intractable as Koldo was, Thane had to be at his best to emerge from an interaction unscathed. He wasn\u2019t. \u201cLet him look.\u201d</p><p>Xerxes rubbed two fingers along the scars in his jaw. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t seem like the type to give up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo bad.\u201d Zacharel suspected Koldo teetered at the brink of falling. He also suspected Thane teetered. So, he\u2019d decided to pair them up, thinking they would look after each other, provide some sort of balance. At least, that\u2019s what Thane had surmised.</p> <p>It was either the wisest thing Zacharel had ever done, or the stupidest.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s Koldo\u2019s deal, anyway?\u201d Bjorn asked.</p><p>Xerxes raised a colorless brow. \u201cIf I know Thane, and I do, he did a little digging before he ever approached Koldo.\u201d</p><p>Thane shrugged. \u201cI discovered our guest spent a little over a decade in a Nefas camp when he was younger.\u201d</p><p>Rainbow eyes glittered dangerously as Bjorn said, \u201cWhat was done to him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAccording to one of the Sent Ones who rescued him, nothing Koldo would admit to. He was filthy, feral, and had just slaughtered the inhabitants of a village. All human.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would he do such a thing?\u201d Xerxes asked.</p><p>\u201cMy guess? He was without hope.\u201d A man without hope was a dangerous weapon. The three of them knew that very well. \u201cI\u2019ve heard the Nefas lock their young in a prison with innocent humans, only allowing one of them out\u2014whoever kills the others. If no one\u2019s willing to commit murder, they all starve.\u201d</p><p>Xerxes scraped his nails against one of the scars on his arm. \u201cHe couldn\u2019t have been raised that way. I\u2019ve never heard him curse. I\u2019ve never seen him drink. And we all saw how he treats females.\u201d</p><p>But they hadn\u2019t seen what Koldo did behind the scenes. They hadn\u2019t seen the holes in his walls. Holes the size of his fists. He was as screwed up as they were.</p><p>A beep sounded from his intercom, saving him from having to try to form a reply. \u201cSir, Cario tried to sneak in again,\u201d a male voice said.</p><p>Cario. The foolish girl. This was her third attempt to reach Xerxes in the past three weeks. For some reason, she was obsessed with the male. The warrior, however, had no idea who she was or why she wanted anything to do with him. Her origins were unclear, but one thing they did know. She could read their minds and knew about their pasts.</p><p>A past they were determined to keep secret.</p><p>\u201cTell me you caught her this time,\u201d Xerxes demanded.</p><p>A crackle of air over the speaker. \u201cUh, well...\u201d</p><p>The warrior pounded his fist into the arm of his chair. \u201cThat woman needs to be put down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDouble the number of guards at each of the doors,\u201d Thane said. Then, to Xerxes, he added, \u201cWe\u2019ll get her. Don\u2019t worry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does she want with you, anyway?\u201d Bjorn padded to the bar and poured another drink. A drink he quickly downed and chased with another.</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t a clue.\u201d Falling against the back of his chair, Xerxes scrubbed a hand down his face. \u201cThe first time I met her was when she came to the club and Thane offered her my sexual services.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought I was doing you a favor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou thought wrong, my friend. And now, I have to go.\u201d Xerxes pushed to his feet, clearly uncomfortable with the topic of conversation. \u201cMcCadden has yet to be fed.\u201d</p><p>McCadden was a fallen Sent One who had attempted to murder one of Zacharel\u2019s charges\u2014and still planned to murder the man. Xerxes should have ended the male and saved himself the trouble of babysitting, but killing their former comrade wasn\u2019t an option. So, they kept him locked away.</p><p>Xerxes strode from the room without another word.</p><p>Bjorn peered into the bottom of his empty glass, his shoulders slightly hunched. \u201cI should be going, too.\u201d</p><p>No, Thane wanted to say. Stay with me. But he wasn\u2019t needy. \u201cI\u2019ll see you tomorrow, then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTomorrow.\u201d His friend\u2019s reply was empty, his back ramrod straight as he strode from the room.</p><p>Silence immediately enveloped Thane.</p><p>Silence. How he despised it. It left him alone with his thoughts, his memories. Scowling, he stood and stepped toward his bedroom, only to stop. The Phoenix was still in his bed. He could go to her, could have her and finally finish them both...but no. He was going to end their association. He wouldn\u2019t welcome her into his arms again.</p><p>He strode from his private wing in the spacious building, down the elevator and into the bar. He would find another lover here, and he would forget his concern for his friends and keep his mind off his past.</p><p>The moment the doors opened, revealing the darkened cavern with velvet-lined walls, black couches and glass tables, noise assaulted him and he was able to relax.</p><p>He prowled through the darkness, patrons in every direction. Some sat at the tables, drinking, snorting ambrosia, while some lounged on the couches in back, leaning as closely as possible into their desired playmate for the evening. Some danced in the center of the room, their hands wandering. He listened to whispered conversations.</p><p>\u201c\u2014you\u2019ll like it, I promise. Just try.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2014relationship material. Seriously. All of the gorgeously hot ones are scum.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2014really think I\u2019d go for someone like you?\u201d</p><p>His gaze scanned...scanned...until finally homing in on the little blonde Harpy Koldo had rejected.</p><p>She would do, he decided.</p><p>Thane sauntered closer to her. As pink-and-blue light spilled from the strobe and onto her, he could see that she had opted not to cover her luminous skin with makeup. Jewel tones radiated from her, a feast for his eyes.</p><p>A feast for all the other males, as well. They gathered around her table, peering at her with abject fascination as she told a story about...the hazards of car exhaust?</p><p>He stepped up behind her. \u201cGo,\u201d he told the men with a curt tone that promised severe consequences if he was disobeyed.</p><p>Most scrambled away. A few lingered, glaring at him\u2014until he turned the full force of his gaze their way. They hopped up and ran.</p><p>The girl rounded on him, frowning. \u201cWhat\u2019d you do that for? Now my experiment is ruined. Ruined, I tell you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat experiment?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo see just how boring I could be and still rock the house.\u201d</p><p>She was an amusing little thing, wasn\u2019t she? He leaned down and whispered into her ear, \u201cHow about you rock me instead, hmm?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh, that would be a no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d She\u2019d been willing to give Koldo a lap dance because he had the face of a killer. Thane had the actual instincts.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re just not what I\u2019m looking for.\u201d</p><p>A true refusal\u2014or a game? \u201cI can change your mind, female.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t take this the wrong way, but no. No, you can\u2019t.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Hmm. As he straightened, he caught tendrils of smoke wafting through the air. Smoke that didn\u2019t curl from cigarettes or cigars but from charred wood and fabric. He studied the bar, searching for evidence of a fire. He found Kendra stalking toward him, wearing nothing more than a bra, a pair of panties and the slave bands.</p><p>\u201cThane!\u201d she bellowed. \u201cI knew you\u2019d come down here.\u201d</p><p>The crowd parted to clear a path for her.</p> <p>Bright red hair stood on end, as though her fingers were hooked to an electrical outlet. Her eyes crackled with blazing jade fire, and her skin sparkled enough to rival the Harpy\u2019s appeal. Her arms were lowered, spread, her claws extended and shooting little golden flames onto the floor.</p><p>Flames that didn\u2019t die, but grew.</p><p>She bared sharp little fangs and spat, \u201cYou left me in bed to come down here to play with some dirty street skank?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d the Harpy snapped. \u201cI totally showered today.\u201d</p><p>He motioned to the head of security, and the male knew to clear out the room.</p> <p>Angry voices rose from the crowd, but the Fae he\u2019d hired was good at his job and footsteps soon pounded toward the doors. Thane despised public displays like this, and he wouldn\u2019t stand for it.</p><p>Soon, only he and the Phoenix remained.</p><p>\u201cI never promised fidelity, Kendra,\u201d he said softly. \u201cIn fact, I promised the opposite. You claimed to be happy with our arrangement.\u201d</p><p>Her chin lifted in a show of pique. \u201cI was. Things changed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>She thought for a moment. Obviously she couldn\u2019t come up with an answer that satisfied her, because she stomped her foot and said, \u201cIf you think there\u2019s another female out there who will do the disgusting things you need, you\u2019re wrong. I told you. I\u2019m the only one who will ever be able to satisfy you.\u201d</p> <p>Disgusting, she\u2019d said.</p><p>And she was right. But she\u2019d always made him think she enjoyed it.</p><p>She\u2019d lied, and he hated liars. \u201cI told you,\u201d he replied smoothly, even as rage kindled. \u201cThere are many who can satisfy me. And they have. They will. But not you. Not ever again.\u201d He closed the distance between them, grabbed her by the neck and squeezed just hard enough to make breathing difficult but not impossible.</p><p>Her eyes widened with fear.</p><p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have pricked my temper, female. I will punish you\u2014and I promise you, you\u2019ll wish I had killed you instead.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER TEN</p><p>SHE HAD SEEN a monster.</p><p>Nicola had beaten back the fear percolating inside her since speeding out of the parking garage long enough to pick up her sister from the hospital, ensure Laila was settled in at home, take a shower to wash off the lotion Koldo despised and walk the aisles at the nearest grocery. Fear she wasn\u2019t supposed to entertain. But as she turned her car into her neighborhood to return home, it finally spilled over\u2014and she couldn\u2019t stop it. Or if she could, she didn\u2019t know how. In seconds, she felt as though she\u2019d downed the most toxic of champagnes, all of the possible side effects converging: light-headedness, upset stomach and ringing in the ears.</p> <p>As her vision blurred, she parked at the nearest curb and leaned her head against the steering wheel, breathing with slow deliberation. I\u2019m still dealing with the aftereffects of a concussion. That\u2019s all. Surely.</p><p>Hopefully.</p><p>Either that, or Koldo had brought something nasty into her life.</p><p>But...no. He was a (famous) warrior to his very core. He was observant. He would have known if he\u2019d ushered in something malevolent. And if he had, he wouldn\u2019t have left her to fend for herself. He wasn\u2019t the type to run. He couldn\u2019t be.</p><p>He\u2019d helped her when he could have remained invisible. Or whatever. He\u2019d helped Laila when he could have washed his hands of her.</p><p>That left the concussion\u2014but she wasn\u2019t satisfied with that explanation. She had no peace about it. So...what if Nicola wasn\u2019t hallucinating? What if the creature she\u2019d seen had been real? After all, Koldo could arrive and leave in the blink of an eye, and he wasn\u2019t a hallucination. Why couldn\u2019t something else do the same?</p><p>So, if the warrior hadn\u2019t led the creature to her door, then...what had? And what was it, exactly?</p><p>When she was younger, she\u2019d heard little girls whispering together at school, afraid of the monsters in their closets. Until that moment, Nicola hadn\u2019t known anything about such monsters. Her parents had never allowed her and Laila to watch TV, and they had carefully chosen every book they read. She\u2019d been so wonderfully innocent in regard to the evils out there, afraid only of what her body was doing to her.</p><p>But of course, everything had changed after that overheard conversation.</p><p>She\u2019d stopped sleeping. She\u2019d looked for monsters around every corner\u2014and she\u2019d begun to see them. A furry, fanged monkey on her mother\u2019s shoulder. Two on her father\u2019s. One following Laila. One following Nicola.</p><p>The increase of fear and the constant stress had damaged her heart further. But after months of therapy and new medications, she\u2019d managed to find a small measure of peace. Fickle peace, that is, that had come and gone. But she\u2019d never seen another monster. Until recently.</p><p>The past few days, she\u2019d seen two. One with Laila, and one at her work.</p><p>Maybe she hadn\u2019t been lost to paranoia back then. Maybe the monsters had always been there, and she had simply shut her eyes. But now...now her eyes were open again.</p><p>Her stomach twisted into hundreds of little knots, the edges sharp enough to cut. And cut they did, making her cringe.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t think about this now, she realized. Worrying\u2014more than she already had\u2014would violate Koldo\u2019s rules. And besides that, she had too much to do. Laila was at home, waiting for her. Nicola had the chocolate her sister requested, as well as a few other necessities, like ice-cream sandwiches and chips, and the groceries were probably baking in the heat of her car, since Bucket had no working air-conditioning.</p><p>Deep breath in...deep breath out. She forced her mind to focus on calming thoughts. Laila, happy. Koldo, telling her those jokes he\u2019d mentioned. She could even imagine what he\u2019d say.</p><p>Why did the warrior cross the road?</p><p>That\u2019s easy. To kill the guy on the other side.</p><p>A bud of amusement had her smiling.</p><p>Knock, knock.</p><p>Who\u2019s there?</p><p>Donut.</p><p>Donut who?</p><p>Donut run from me, puny girl.</p><p>The amusement bloomed the rest of the way.</p><p>Her vision cleared. Her stomach settled. After checking the road and finding it empty, she motored forward. Her gaze snagged on the depressingly run-down area anyone with half a brain would have avoided. Most of the lawns were tall and filled with weeds\u2014to hide the evidence of recent crimes, she was sure\u2014and most of the houses had a few boarded-up windows. All of the houses had graffiti spray painted on the brick, hers included.</p><p>Police sirens could be heard throughout the night, every night, and she was pretty sure the neighbor on her left had a meth lab in his basement. But this was all she could afford, her parents\u2019 house having been sold to pay a few creditors from their atrocious stack of bills.</p><p>Enough. Nicola had one hour before she had to clock in at Y and R Organic Market. A place she couldn\u2019t afford to shop at, even with her employee discount. She planned to spend every minute with Laila.</p><p>Only, after she put away the groceries, she discovered her sister had moved from bed to the couch, empty food wrappers all around her as she slept, the TV playing an old episode of Castle. Nicola grinned. This was what she\u2019d wanted for so long. Laila, here. Laila, relaxed.</p><p>But her grin faded when she spotted two fanged monkeys perched on the top of the couch, both glaring at her, their fur raised aggressively. Like the creature in the hospital\u2014in fact, the one on the left had to be the very one she\u2019d seen\u2014they had tentacles rather than arms, the appendages slithering around them like hungry snakes ready for a meal.</p><p>As a child, Nicola would have run screaming.</p><p>Only a few hours ago, she had burned rubber in her car.</p><p>Now, she would learn the truth one way or another.</p><p>Trembling, she marched forward and reached out. One of the creatures unleashed a shriek of rage, either to scare her off or to warn her that she was about to lose her hand. The other swatted at her with one of those tentacles, and the contact burned, leaving a red welt behind.</p><p>That meant...that meant the monsters were real.</p><p>Before she could panic, both creatures jumped off the couch and disappeared beyond the wall.</p><p>Her knees gave out and she sank to the ground, trying to steady her throbbing heart. Sweet mercy. What did this mean? And what she was going to do about it?</p><p>SHORTLY AFTER MIDNIGHT, Nicola closed her register at the Y and R Organic Market, and she\u2019d never been so happy to finish a day. Not just because she was eager to return to Laila, but also because every coworker to cross her path had insulted her. For no reason! Every customer to come through her line had yelled at her. And, okay, yes, they\u2019d had good reason.</p><p>The monkeys with tentacles had followed her. Them\u2014and around twenty of their dearest friends. But at least they weren\u2019t hovering around poor Laila.</p><p>Ten minutes after her arrival, the horde had congregated inside the market, crawling up the walls, along the ceiling tiles, dropping upon the shoulder of everyone she encountered, unbeknownst to them, and laughing and pointing at her.</p><p>She had screamed.</p><p>She had stared.</p><p>She had almost passed out.</p><p>But no one else had seen them. No one else had reacted. Well, not to the demons. They had reacted to her high-pitched terror fits.</p><p>About twenty minutes ago, the creatures had left the same way they\u2019d come.</p><p>She wanted to talk to Koldo. And maybe climb him like a tree and hide up there in the upper stratosphere of Giantland where, hopefully, no one would be able to see her and she wouldn\u2019t have to deal with this kind of stuff.</p><p>\u201cNicola, I need to speak with you in my office.\u201d</p><p>The voice pulled her from her thoughts, and she turned to see her boss standing at the end of her stall. He was five-eight, with sandy-colored hair, hazel eyes and olive-toned skin. He would have been a decent-looking guy if not for his skeevy ways. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He was the type to massage the shoulders of every female he encountered, \u201cjust to help with the strain.\u201d That wouldn\u2019t have been so bad, she supposed, but he also liked to whisper, \u201cNow, doesn\u2019t this feel nice?\u201d as he did it.</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d she said, and gulped.</p><p>The instinct to run suddenly rose from deep within her. To run from this place and never look back.</p> <p>Oh, no, no, no. He was going to fire her, wasn\u2019t he?</p><p>Only six other cashiers had worked this shift, and all quickened their pace, gathering their belongings and leaving the store. The front lights had already been turned off, but the parking lot was illuminated by several streetlamps, and she watched as the men and women entered their cars and drove away, careful not to glance in her direction.</p><p>Yep. Mr. Ritter was planning to fire her, and they knew it, too.</p><p>There had to be a way to change his mind.</p><p>Palms sweating, Nicola made her way to the back of the grocery, bypassing the oranges and apples. She needed this job just as desperately as she needed the other one. One paid her house payment, utilities and car insurance, while the other paid for food and gas. In this economy, she would have a difficult time finding another job with late hours and wages above the minimum.</p> <p>Mr. Ritter\u2019s door was propped open, and she forced her feet to take her inside. Run!</p><p>He was already behind his desk, reading a file. She stayed.</p><p>\u201cShut the door,\u201d he said.</p><p>She reached back and tugged on the knob, and the thick metal swooshed closed. As always, the lock engaged automatically. The room was small, filled with metal cabinets and an oversize desk. There were two chairs. His, which was cushioned by a pillow, and hers, which wasn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cSit.\u201d</p><p>As she obeyed, she said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry about my performance today. I\u2019ll do better, I promise. And I won\u2019t make any excuses.\u201d How could she? I saw monsters no one else could see, Mr. Ritter. What could he possibly say to that? \u201cI\u2019ll just\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHow\u2019s your sister?\u201d he interjected, at last looking up at her.</p><p>A shudder nearly rocked her out of the seat. A monkey had just appeared on his shoulder. It was smaller than any of the others, and far hairier, and it glared at her with the same hate-filled eyes. And as she watched, it...it...couldn\u2019t be doing what she thought it was doing.</p><p>But it was. It was peeing.</p><p>\u201cIt\u201d was obviously a \u201che,\u201d and he was aiming at Nicola. Trying to...mark her? Like a dog with its territory?</p><p>She scooted as far back in her chair as she could, successfully avoiding any splatter. Mr. Ritter and his papers weren\u2019t so lucky.</p><p>\u201cI asked you a question, Miss Lane.\u201d</p><p>How could he not know his shirt was now soaked? How could he not see the sogginess of the papers? How could he not smell that...her nose wrinkled...disgusting aroma? \u201cShe\u2019s, uh, doing better. She\u2019s home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good.\u201d His tone lowered, and so did his gaze, landing on her breasts and staying. \u201cThat\u2019s very good.\u201d</p> <p>Nicola\u2019s hands curled into fists. \u201cWas that all you wanted to see me about?\u201d</p><p>A moment passed before he remembered she had a face. He leaned back in his seat and folded his hands over his middle, his expression stern. \u201cYour performance today was subpar, but you know that. You angered several customers by ringing up their items two or three times\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I always fixed the mistakes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNevertheless,\u201d he continued smoothly, \u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019ll soon be asking me to take some time off to spend with your sister, and as you know, we don\u2019t have anyone who can take your place. I\u2019ll need to hire someone new. And if I hire someone new, why can\u2019t that person just take all of your hours?\u201d</p><p>A tide of dread washed over her, followed quickly by an intensified urge to run. But why run? she wondered now. The threat had already been issued, and this was her chance to offer a counter. So, once again she stayed put.</p><p>\u201cI can promise that I\u2019ll never have another day like today.\u201d From now on, she would ignore the existence of the monkeys. That\u2019s what the therapists had told her to do as a child, and it had worked. Right? \u201cI won\u2019t be asking for any days off, you have my word.\u201d</p><p>The monkey began hopping up and down, screeching, and she had trouble distinguishing Mr. Ritter\u2019s next words. \u201cWhat if your sister gets sick again? What then? What if you get sick again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt won\u2019t matter. I\u2019ll work.\u201d</p><p>Lips pursed, he reached out and traced a fingertip over the photo of his wife and three children. \u201cHow badly do you want to keep this job?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBadly,\u201d she said, leaning forward. \u201cIs there something I can do? Take extra hours? You name it!\u201d</p><p>His hand fell to his side. He grinned.</p><p>The monkey went quiet\u2014and he, too, grinned.</p><p>\u201cI was hoping you\u2019d say that,\u201d Mr. Ritter said, a disgusting gleam flickering in his eyes. \u201cI want you to start by telling me how you\u2019ll use your mouth on me, and end with how you\u2019ll bend over my desk. Then I want you to do it.\u201d</p><p>A moment passed in silence as her mind processed what she had just heard. He hadn\u2019t... He couldn\u2019t have... Oh, but he could, and he had. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to fire me. I quit.\u201d She stood and marched to the door. The knob held steady when she twisted. Anger mixed with frustration as she barked, \u201cLet me out. Now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI rigged the lock. I hope you don\u2019t mind.\u201d Smiling, Mr. Ritter pushed to his feet, walked around the desk. The monkey jumped to the floor and followed him, the pitter-patter of clawed footfalls resounding. \u201cI\u2019ve wondered what you\u2019re like in bed, you know.\u201d</p><p>She tried the knob again, but again, it held. Fear squeezed the air from her lungs, expunging all other emotions. She was trapped in this small room, and no one was out there to hear her cry for help.</p><p>\u201cLet me out, Mr. Ritter.\u201d There was a tremor in her voice, one she couldn\u2019t hide. \u201cIf you try anything, I\u2019ll fight you. You\u2019ll be punished.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want you to fight. Not that it\u2019ll do you any good. But no...no, I won\u2019t be punished. That I promise you.\u201d</p><p>Heart pounding, she rounded on him. The action left her dizzy, but she managed to remain on her feet.</p><p>He was so close he had only to reach out to pinch a lock of her hair between his too-thin fingers. \u201cI told everyone I planned to fire you tonight. Tomorrow, if the cops come knocking on my door, I\u2019ll let them know you offered me your body to stay on, and of course, in a moment of weakness, I succumbed. And oh, the sick things you let me do to you. Afterward, though, you were still fired. Horrible of me? Yes. But deserving of your malicious lies about rape?\u201d He tsked under his tongue. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Rape. The word echoed hollowly in her mind. This was why her instincts had wanted her to run, she realized, not because he\u2019d planned to fire her. Why, why, why hadn\u2019t she listened?</p><p>\u201cN-no one will believe you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWon\u2019t they?\u201d He inched ever closer to her. \u201cI know what I\u2019m planning to do, but even I believe me. See, you told me you fell at the hospital and banged your head. I\u2019m guessing you have bruises from that. What\u2019s a few more? How will anyone be able to tell the difference?\u201d</p><p>The doctors would be able to tell the difference. And she was sure the authorities would be able to tell the difference...but what did that matter right now? By the time they discovered the truth, his awful deed would already have been done.</p><p>The fear magnified, opening welcoming arms to panic. Can\u2019t yield to it.</p><p>Must fight. Nicola swung out a fist, intending to punch him in the nose and buy herself a few minutes to find a weapon, but he jumped out of the way, avoiding contact. Before she could swipe out another fist, he kicked out his leg and knocked her ankles together. She jetted backward, her skull hitting the door. A sharp pain wrung a gasp from her, even as pinpricks of light dotted her vision, and she slid to the concrete floor.</p><p>Another concussion? she wondered distantly.</p><p>Grinning all the wider, Mr. Ritter bent over her. \u201cI put a camera in the women\u2019s bathroom, you know. Your panties have always been my favorite.\u201d</p><p>His image swam, blurring with that of the monkey. The creature was once again preparing to pee. Somehow, she managed to find the strength to turn her head and bite Mr. Ritter\u2019s ankle.</p><p>Howling, he ripped from her hold. Blood instantly coated her tongue. Good. She\u2019d taken a hunk of skin and muscle.</p><p>Temples throbbing, she pulled herself up and spit whatever was in her mouth at the monkey, causing him to lurch away. \u201cI won\u2019t let you do this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t be able to stop me.\u201d He leaped on her, shoving her back down, staying on his knees to straddle her waist. The monkey laughed and pointed at her, just as his friends had done earlier.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d she screamed, bucking to dislodge him. Failing. \u201cNo! Stop!\u201d She punched and punched at him, nailing him in the shoulder, the chest and the side, but weak as she was he was able to withstand the abuse and eventually catch...her...wrists....</p><p>\u201cGotcha.\u201d</p><p>And he did. He had her, and worked quickly to tie her arms over her head and latch her to the door. Though she could barely draw in a breath, though her heart was fluttering painfully and her vision was dimming, she contorted her body to kick at him. He soon had her legs corralled and her ankles tied to his desk, leaving her stretched out, open to attack.</p><p>Tears beaded in her eyes. She\u2019d lost, she realized. As easily as that, she\u2019d lost. And\u2014no, no, no\u2014she was going to pass out. Any moment now, she would fade, utterly vulnerable, even more helpless.</p><p>\u201cNow, now,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll make sure you enjoy yourself. There\u2019s no reason for you to be upset.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI said no!\u201d she gritted out.</p><p>\u201cAnd I said oh, baby, yes.\u201d He began unbuttoning his shirt.</p><p>This wasn\u2019t happening. Was it? This couldn\u2019t be happening. Could it? Her boss, a man she had known for three years, had not just threatened her, bound her with his necktie and rope. He wasn\u2019t stripping. And she wasn\u2019t fighting for every breath, holding on to her state of awareness with every fiber of her being. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThe things I\u2019m going to do to you...\u201d He discarded the cotton with a shrug of his shoulders.</p><p>\u201cPlease, don\u2019t do this,\u201d she pleaded.</p><p>He ignored her words, looking her over. \u201cI\u2019ll be very careful with your clothes, so that there\u2019s no sign of a struggle.\u201d He reached down, tugged her shirt and bra over her breasts, baring her to his view, and licked his lips. \u201cWell, well. I never expected you to be so pretty here.\u201d</p> <p>The tears cascaded down her cheeks, burning. \u201cPlease.\u201d The room was growing darker by the second.</p><p>\u201cHmmm, I do like when you beg.\u201d He unsnapped the waist of her jeans, slowly lowered the zipper.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you doing this?\u201d she whispered, fighting sobs. Darkness...so much darkness...</p><p>\u201cBecause I want to. Because I can.\u201d She heard the slide of his zipper.</p><p>A ferocious bellow suddenly ripped through the entire room, scraping at her ears. Mr. Ritter stiffened\u2014just before his weight was thrown off her.</p> <p>Boom!</p><p>Nicola blinked, light returning. She saw her boss across the room, plaster and dust forming a cloud around him.</p><p>\u201cI grant you battle rights to the demon,\u201d a familiar voice snapped, and then Koldo was leaning over her, cutting her loose, righting her clothing. His big, strong hands were gentle, comforting. \u201cBut the human is mine.\u201d</p><p>He was here.</p><p>He had saved her.</p><p>The sobs finally battled their way free, and she threw her arms around his neck, holding him as tightly as she possibly could.</p> <p>\u201cAre you all right?\u201d he asked in a soft voice.</p><p>She tried to reply, but she was choking, gasping, and couldn\u2019t work out a single word.</p><p>He lifted her against his chest, anchoring her with one hand and righting the chair she\u2019d vacated with the other. He placed her in the seat and tried to straighten, but she maintained her grip.</p><p>He knelt in front of her and cupped her cheeks, forcing her to face him. \u201cWhat was done to you, Nicola?\u201d</p><p>Somehow, she found her voice. \u201cHe...he...tried to...was going to...\u201d</p><p>A hard gleam in his eyes as he said, \u201cBut he didn\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you gave me rights, but I will bow to your desires. What would you prefer I do?\u201d an unfamiliar male asked. \u201cCapture or destroy?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDestroy,\u201d Koldo replied, and with the word, whatever tether he had on his control must have snapped. He straightened, every inch of him vibrating with aggression, and stomped over to Mr. Ritter.</p><p>One punch. Two. Three. Four. There were no pauses. No stopping to issue a taunt. Koldo simply unloaded, his fists pounding into her boss\u2019s face. Blood sprayed in every direction. The sound of breaking bone echoed.</p><p>The brutality of the act stunned her. She\u2019d never seen such focused rage.</p><p>Her gaze slid in the other, unfamiliar man\u2019s direction. He was the same size as Koldo, and sweet mercy, he was beautiful. So blond and tan and, wow, he had some big baby blues. But what truly snagged her attention were the huge, feathery wings arching over his shoulders and swooping all the way to the floor.</p><p>He was...an angel?</p><p>I grant you battle rights to the demon, Koldo had said.</p><p>Angels fought demons. Right? So...yes, he had to be an angel.</p><p>The winged male picked up speed as he chased the monkey\u2014the demon\u2014through the room, his image blurring. He swung two menacing swords, papers floating from the desk to the ground. Files scattered, and furniture was toppled over. Finally, though, his blades slicked through the monkey\u2019s fur\u2014right across his throat. The head separated from the body, and both toppled to the ground. Black mist rose from the pieces...pieces now sizzling, burning to ash.</p><p>Ash that danced through the air, curling up, up and away.</p><p>He tossed the blood-soaked swords behind him, and as they vanished, frowned at Koldo. \u201cHey, that\u2019s enough,\u201d he said.</p><p>But Koldo continued.</p><p>Mr. Ritter was too busy dying to weigh in with his opinion.</p><p>The winged male threw his arms around Koldo\u2019s middle, trapping him against his chest. Koldo jerked free and spun, his expression cold and menacing, his teeth longer and sharper than she\u2019d ever seen them. He clearly intended to bite the other man, perhaps even to rip his head off.</p><p>Somehow, he caught himself in time. Just before contact, he shut his mouth. But he was moving too quickly to stop altogether, and his cheek slammed into the other guy\u2019s chin, sending him stumbling backward. When the blond straightened, the two faced each other.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t kill him,\u201d the blond snarled. \u201cI did us both a favor.\u201d</p><p>There was something about his voice...something that caused Nicola to flinch. A purity she\u2019d never before heard. A compulsion to believe him, whatever he said.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Koldo spat. \u201cBut I can hurt him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve done that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot enough.\u201d</p><p>Otherworldly blue eyes narrowed with determined calculation. \u201cFine. You finish with the male, and risk ruining us all, and I\u2019ll take care of the female.\u201d</p><p>A second later, Koldo was standing in front of her, yet he\u2019d never taken a step. His heat quickly enveloped her, and his comforting scent followed suit. \u201cYou won\u2019t touch her.\u201d</p><p>The blond nodded as though disappointed, but he couldn\u2019t hide the twitching of his lips. Clearly, he was now amused.</p><p>He leaned down and wrapped his big hand around Mr. Ritter\u2019s neck and lifted him off the floor. Her boss was unconscious, his face nothing but blood and pulp. His eyes were swollen shut, his nose flattened against his cheek, and his lip slit in multiple places.</p><p>\u201cWhat are his crimes?\u201d the blond asked her.</p><p>Koldo reached out and placed his hand on her shoulder, offering comfort.</p><p>\u201cHe videos girls going to the bathroom,\u201d she whispered, wrapping her arms around her middle. At least she could cross concussion off the list. Her eyesight was fine, her stomach calming. \u201cHe tied me up. He touched me. He was going to... Was happy about...\u201d</p><p>A growl erupted from Koldo. Those too-sharp teeth were once again bared. His nostrils flared with his every breath, and his muscles knotted, seeming to expand. \u201cYou will give him to me and walk away, Thane.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHardly,\u201d the male\u2014Thane\u2014retorted. \u201cI told you. You\u2019ve done enough. I\u2019ll take him to the human authorities.\u201d</p><p>Nicola studied Koldo more intently. He might skirt the edge of savage right now, but his image was her lifeline to sanity. He wore a long, white robe, just like the other guy, but there were no wings stretching from his back.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t be an angel, then. So...what was he? And why wasn\u2019t he covered in Mr. Ritter\u2019s blood? There wasn\u2019t a single crimson speck on him.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t allow you to break Zacharel\u2019s golden rule,\u201d Thane added.</p><p>\u201cI will gladly break the rule,\u201d he snarled, every word edging closer to murderous.</p><p>\u201cKoldo,\u201d Nicola whispered. She didn\u2019t want him in trouble over this.</p><p>Instantly the warrior spun back to face her, flickers of concern in his golden eyes. \u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to go home. Will you...please open...the door?\u201d Her chin began another round of trembling, not from tears, not this time, but from cold. Despite the warrior\u2019s heat, ice was crystallizing in her veins, shock giving way to a heavy realization. After this, her life would never again be the same.</p><p>\u201cHe somehow locked the office from the inside,\u201d she added, \u201cand I couldn\u2019t get the door to budge.\u201d</p><p>Rage contorted his features, but his voice was tender as he said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry I wasn\u2019t here sooner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease, don\u2019t be\u2014\u201d She pressed her lips together, and her heart skipped a beat as she remembered the words she\u2019d offered to Mr. Ritter.... Please, don\u2019t do this.... Yet he had spurned her. Laughed.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take you home,\u201d Koldo replied, and she almost slumped over with a new tide of relief.</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFind the proof of the cameras,\u201d Koldo told Thane, \u201cand make sure the authorities learn of his crimes. All of his crimes. If he isn\u2019t locked up by morning, make no mistake, I\u2019ll return and finish what I started.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. By the way,\u201d the other male said, \u201cZacharel just spoke inside my head.\u201d</p><p>Koldo nodded stiffly. \u201cMine, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you know we\u2019re free of each other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd that the girl is now my charge. Yes.\u201d</p><p>She was?</p><p>\u201cMakes sense,\u201d Thane said. \u201cYou know when she\u2019s in trouble.\u201d</p><p>He did?</p><p>Koldo popped his jaw.</p><p>\u201cUntil the next battle, warrior.\u201d Thane spread his wings and catapulted through the air with Mr. Ritter clutched at his side.</p><p>CHAPTER ELEVEN</p><p>HIS CHARGE, KOLDO THOUGHT. Nicola\u2019s actions were now his. If she killed a human, he would be held accountable. If a demon killed her, it would be as if he had delivered the deathblow himself.</p><p>Their lives were now irrevocably tied together.</p><p>As Koldo\u2019s commander, Zacharel had the authority to place someone, anyone, in Koldo\u2019s care. Just as Germanus had the authority to place Koldo in Zacharel\u2019s care. But why had Zacharel done this to him? What could the Elite warrior possibly hope to gain?</p><p>Whatever the answers, Koldo would have to question Zacharel later. Right now, he wanted the shell-shocked Nicola tucked safely away. And he reeeally needed to rein in his temper.</p><p>As gently as possible, he tugged the trembling Nicola to her feet and into his arms. \u201cClose your eyes.\u201d He could flash whatever he held, and was thus able to take her home with only a thought. One moment they were in the office, the next they were in the center of her living room.</p><p>His arms fell from around her, and she stumbled backward. When she righted, her gaze caught on the familiar surroundings of her living room and her jaw dropped.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m home. But how did... We never took a step and...only a second passed!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s called a flash. It\u2019s what I\u2019ve done every time I\u2019ve arrived and left you. This time, I brought you with me.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Her hand fluttered to her neck. \u201cWhere I\u2019m from, flashing means exposing your naked body to someone.\u201d</p><p>He wouldn\u2019t touch that statement. Not after everything she\u2019d been through today. \u201cBut we aren\u2019t from the same place, are we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014I guess not.\u201d</p> <p>He\u2019d been here before, but still he looked around, taking in details he\u2019d previously ignored. The house was small and on the verge of collapse, but it was clean. The walls were yellowed with age and peeling, but scraped. Where the carpet had been ripped out, the floor was stained to blend.</p><p>The dwelling would never be worthy of her.</p><p>He should move her into one of his homes.</p><p>Yes, he thought. He\u2019d never invited anyone to one of his homes, though some of the warriors had invited themselves, yet he suddenly longed to flash Nicola to the beach house or the ranch by the volcano, to surround her with velvets, silks and luxuries of every kind.</p><p>If she protested, he could remind her of their bargain. For however long he deemed necessary, she was to do what he said, when he said it, with no argument. But...</p> <p>He wanted her agreement.</p><p>\u201cSit down. I\u2019ll make tea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re staying?\u201d she squeaked.</p><p>Was the squeak a sign of relief? Or disappointment?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m staying.\u201d Just try to get rid of me. See what happens.</p><p>She gulped, nodded.</p> <p>He didn\u2019t like how pale and shaky she was, and though he hated to walk away from her, even for a second, he did just that. In the kitchen, he searched until he found the required items. She had one pot, one pan and two of everything else. There were a few boxed dinners, a few cans of soup, but very little else. How long had she been living like this?</p><p>Too long, he decided.</p><p>He had to fix the pilot light in order to boil the water, but soon had a steaming cup of chamomile tea in her hands. She rested on the couch, her legs tucked under her and a blanket draped around her shoulders. Some of the color had already returned to her cheeks, and the more forceful of her trembles had subsided.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she said, proper and polite and so adorable his chest ached.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome. Drink while I check on Laila.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI checked on her before I sat down,\u201d she admitted.</p><p>He should have guessed. \u201cAnd how is she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell. She\u2019s sleeping.\u201d After blowing on the surface of the liquid, Nicola sipped from the cup. \u201cIn fact, that\u2019s all she\u2019s been doing lately. Is that normal?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes.\u201d Her body was playing catch-up with her spirit. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. She won\u2019t spend all of her remaining time in bed.\u201d</p><p>Nicola flinched at the reference to the ever-ticking clock. \u201cBut if she\u2019s better now, why can\u2019t she stay that way?\u201d</p><p>He heard the longing in her tone and knew this was the perfect time to introduce her to the spirit world around her.</p><p>Koldo crouched in front of her. Several curling locks of hair had escaped the confinement of her ponytail and now tumbled at her temples, framing her face. Dark bruises marred the tender flesh under her eyes, and her lips were swollen. Had she chewed them in fear? Or had she been struck?</p><p>Calm. \u201cYou\u2019ll cease working for the grocery store. Understand?\u201d It wasn\u2019t what he\u2019d planned to say, but the words escaped anyway.</p><p>\u201cWell, duh. I already quit.\u201d The waspish statement failed to hide the flood of vulnerability and humiliation suddenly consuming her features. \u201cI\u2019ll need to find another job as soon as possible, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He wanted the first fruits of her time and energy, not what was leftover.</p><p>\u201cBut, Koldo, I have to\u2014\u201d</p><p>He cut her off, saying, \u201cRecover. Yes.\u201d</p><p>Nicola\u2019s gaze lowered. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have to recover. I knew better than to go back there with him. I had a feeling I should run.\u201d</p><p>Her spirit had picked up on things the mind could not and had tried to warn her. \u201cWhy did you disregard the feeling?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI convinced myself he only meant to fire me, and I wanted a chance to talk him out of it.\u201d</p><p>A mistake so many made.</p><p>A mistake Koldo had often made.</p><p>\u201cWhy did this happen to me?\u201d she asked softly.</p><p>Because she\u2019d gotten a taste of hope and happiness, the demons had sought to squash the beautiful emotions before they could bloom into spiritual weapons. \u201cThe world is populated by beings with free will, and free will allows for absolute good...and absolute evil.\u201d</p><p>She nodded as he spoke. \u201cEvil. Yes. There was a demon in the room. The other warrior said so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Demons seek the destruction of mankind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause they despise the Most High, and He loves you. They cannot strike at Him any other way, so they destroy what He wants kept safe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d she asked again, then blushed. \u201cSorry. I sound like a four-year-old child. Who is the Most High? Why does He want me\u2014us\u2014kept safe?\u201d</p><p>Rather than answer her just yet, he said, \u201cHave you figured out what I am?\u201d</p><p>She peeked at him through the thick shield of her lashes. \u201cWell, I know your friend is an angel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut not me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have wings.\u201d</p><p>She had meant no insult. He knew that. She had merely stated a fact. He knew that, too. And yet still a razor seemed to scrape against his chest. \u201cI\u2019m going to remove the top portion of my robe. Not to harm you, or tempt you\u2014\u201d if such a thing were even possible \u201c\u2014but to prove what I am. All right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA-all right.\u201d</p><p>He stood and, suddenly trembling, tugged the robe from his shoulders, then turned to reveal the scars and tattoos on his back.</p><p>She gasped with...disgust?</p><p>\u201cOh, Koldo. You\u2019re so beautiful.\u201d</p><p>No, not disgust. Wonder.</p><p>How could that be? Wings were prized, not pale imitations. Yet still he\u2019d spent six days having the back of his body inked, all but his spine colored by images of feathers and down.</p><p>By the time he\u2019d had it done, his regenerative powers had been activated, and ambrosia had had to be added to the ink to ensure the colors remained vibrant. Ambrosia, what his mother used to add to her wine. Ambrosia, the flowers he\u2019d picked for her.</p><p>Ambrosia, a drug for immortals.</p><p>Cornelia had hated her life with her unwanted son so much she\u2019d drugged herself to endure it.</p><p>\u201cYou were injured,\u201d Nicola said, seeing the scars beneath the tattoos. \u201cHow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTorture.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Koldo. I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d</p><p>He wasn\u2019t sure how to reply. He only knew he longed for her to stand, to reach out, to ghost her fingertips over the raised tissue.</p><p>But she didn\u2019t. And that was probably for the best.</p><p>Probably? No. Definitely. He was unsure of his reaction.</p><p>She said, \u201cYou\u2019re an angel, too, then?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged back into his robe and slowly turned to face her. She\u2019d set the teacup on the table beside her, the steam rising, curling around her, creating a dreamlike haze.</p><p>Must be near her.</p><p>Any other time, he might have fought the urge. But after what she\u2019d just been through, he allowed himself to return to the couch and crouch between her legs. \u201cI\u2019m like the angels in many ways, yes, but I\u2019m not an angel. I\u2019m a Sent One.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA Sent One,\u201d she parroted. \u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll explain as best I can, but I must start from the beginning.\u201d</p><p>She nodded, eager. \u201cPlease do.\u201d</p><p>Here goes. He hoped she was ready. \u201cLong ago, the most beautiful of all the cherubim was Lucifer, and he was given charge over one-third of the Most High\u2019s angels. One day, he entertained a glimmer of pride...then another...and another and another, until he was nursing his self-importance as a babe at a mother\u2019s breast.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that word. Cherubim,\u201d she said, her brow furrowed. \u201cCherub is the singular version, right? An actual kind of angel. And the Most High is your leader, I\u2019m guessing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight on both counts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I thought cherubs were small, like toddlers. And okay, I\u2019m just going to say it\u2014don\u2019t they wear diapers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLucifer is taller than I am, but I do like the image of him in a diaper.\u201d</p><p>Her jaw dropped, but she managed to breathe out, \u201cWow. Anyone taller than you must be... I mean...uh, I like your height. It\u2019s just right.\u201d</p><p>A wonderful recovery, he thought as he continued his story. \u201cUltimately, Lucifer became so convinced of his own power that he decided to exalt his throne above the Most High\u2019s. He gathered the angels under his charge, convincing them they would have a better life under his reign. Together, they attacked. The Most High defeated and denounced the treacherous angels, tossing them out of the heavens.\u201d</p><p>She reached out, as if she meant to toy with the beads in his beard. Just before contact, she froze. Her hand dropped to her lap. \u201cWere you part of the battle, helping the Most High?\u201d</p><p>He hated that she\u2019d changed her mind about touching him\u2014and hated that he hated. \u201cNo. I wasn\u2019t yet born.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait. Angels are born?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. They were created.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut... Oh, I remember,\u201d she said with the half grin he so admired. \u201cYou aren\u2019t an angel.\u201d</p><p>She was beginning to understand.</p><p>\u201cSo, what happened after the bad guys got spanked?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBack then, the earth was different than the place you know it to be, and home to another race of beings. And no, they weren\u2019t human. Lucifer was so angry with the Most High, he infected these beings with his evil. They became so vile, the earth was destroyed\u2014but the beings survived in the core, in hell, because nothing of the spirit can die. Not in the sense you know the word, at least.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widened as he spoke.</p><p>\u201cTime passed. The Most High re-created and repopulated the world, this time with humans, and it was a veritable paradise. And to answer your earlier question, He loves your people and wants you kept safe because He created you. He created you because He longed for fellowship. You were to be His beloved children, to rule the earth as kings.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He paused, waiting for her reaction.</p><p>She nodded to encourage him to continue.</p><p>\u201cLucifer decided there was no better time for a counterattack and, through trickery and deceit, stole the reins of control of the earth.

This time, she was so distracted by his story that she failed to catch herself. Her fingertips glided over his jaw.</p><p>At the moment of contact, he sucked in a breath. It felt so right.

He leaned into her, seeking something deeper, more intimate.</p><p>How many years had he yearned for something like this? Dreamed of it? Once, as a child, he\u2019d even cried for it. And now, here it was. Offered freely.</p><p>Never stop, he thought.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry,\u201d she gasped out, and dropped her arm. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to maul you.\u201d</p> <p>That gentle caress was considered mauling? What did she think he\u2019d done to her? he wondered, a bit sick to his stomach.</p><p>\u201cI liked it.\u201d Koldo took her hand in his as tenderly as possible and brought it back to his face. Bit by bit, Nicola relaxed\u2014and so did he. Soon, she was stroking his beard of her own accord, mesmerized by her actions. He had to swallow a purr of approval.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened next?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cLucifer and his fallen angels introduced sickness, suffering, poverty and even physical death to the world. As for the beings living in the earth\u2019s core, they were disembodied, desperately seeking a host. Some came to the surface, searching. They are the creatures you know as demons.\u201d</p><p>A shudder of revulsion rocked her. \u201cThey all sound terrible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey are.\u201d More so than she realized. \u201cFor a while, the fallen angels lived among the humans, called themselves gods, stalked the land at their leisure and tormented whomever they desired. Some even mated with your females, and the offspring became known as the Nephilim. They were horrible creatures filled with hate and driven by greed. They were giants, savages, brutal and...\u201d How to explain? \u201cDifferent cultures have given them different names.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIn mythology,\u201d she said, her eyes widening.</p><p>\u201cExactly. Greek, Titan. Egyptian. Norse. Any, all. The fallen angels were punished for contaminating the human race, and chained beneath hell, where they couldn\u2019t be freed by their comrades. The Nephilim were wiped out\u2014at least for a little while.\u201d</p><p>Her arms wrapped around her middle, severing contact, and her tremors intensified again. Not to the same degree as at the grocery store, but enough to hurry him along.</p><p>As he tucked the blanket more firmly around her shoulders, he said, \u201cThere are also demons in hell, there to torment the spirits cast there. They refer to themselves as high lords and minions, but they have many different names, many different ranks. Some prefer to stay here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeeking a host, you said.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cAnd someone to torment, to feed from.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that what they want with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. They want to pump you full of their poison, weakening your defenses against them, allowing them to slip past your skin and into your body. Once there, they fight to control your thoughts, your actions, all the while feeding off your negative emotions, infecting you with sickness.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSickness,\u201d she echoed.</p><p>\u201cYes, but there is a cure. To obtain it, the Most High fought and defeated Lucifer all over again.\u201d That\u2019s when the first of Koldo\u2019s kind was created, tasked with escorting humans out of Lucifer\u2019s darkness and into the Most High\u2019s light.</p><p>Over the centuries, Sent Ones like Koldo had lost sight of their goal. But not anymore, he decided. He would help Nicola.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the cure? And why am I still sick?\u201d Nicola asked.</p><p>\u201cEvery cure comes with instructions. You have yet to follow the right ones.\u201d</p><p>A long while passed as she absorbed his words. Finally she said, \u201cWell, tell me the instructions. I\u2019m ready to follow them. Honest.\u201d</p><p>Koldo was pleased by Nicola\u2019s words. He might not wield the ring of truth as other Sent Ones, but even still, she heard the certainty of his claims. She believed. She accepted.</p><p>She wanted to act, and action was power.</p><p>\u201cI gave you some of the instructions already,\u201d he said. \u201cThe demons breathed their poison into your ear, sparking fear. You embraced that fear, and it strengthened the poison, and all too soon your emotions were feeding the demons. Calm, peace and joy cause the poison to weaken.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHence the reason you want me to feel them.\u201d She nodded as she spoke. \u201cSo...the poison is like a parasite. Or a virus. Like influenza or E. coli. It can grow, but it can also die.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. If the demons cannot feed, they\u2019ll flee. That\u2019s why guarding your thoughts and words is so important.\u201d Koldo lifted slightly and twisted, making room for his big body on the couch.</p><p>Nicola snuggled against him, surprising him\u2014thrilling him. Her cheek rested against the quickening beat of his heart. He breathed her in, all that cinnamon and vanilla and honey.</p><p>And oh, heavens above, he was hot and cold at the same time. He trembled. He...wanted more. He wasn\u2019t what she needed; he\u2019d already realized that. His past being what it was, he had no right to console a female. He\u2019d hurt too many. He deserved a whipping, a beating, not a caress. But he just couldn\u2019t bring himself to move away.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so warm,\u201d she said.</p><p>You\u2019re so soft.</p><p>She reached up, her fingers again toying with the ends of his beard. \u201cSo even my thoughts matter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. Your thoughts can create a fiery storm or a peaceful sea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I can\u2019t control\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can. If the wrong thought comes, force yourself to think of something else.\u201d That\u2019s good advice\u2014why don\u2019t you follow it, too?</p><p>She sighed. \u201cWhat about the water you gave Laila?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt healed her body and cast the demon out of her, but what will happen if she\u2019s attacked by other demons? Will she once again cave to the toxin and fear?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe had a demon inside her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Perhaps he should have broken that particular piece of news more gently.</p><p>Several moments passed in silence. \u201cI had no idea. Was so ignorant.\u201d A tremor raked her body, and warm tears soaked the fabric of his robe.</p><p>Tears? He had to see her face. Koldo palmed her waist, lifted her and parted her legs with his knee. She gasped as he settled her on his lap, and only then did he realize the sheer intimacy of the position.</p><p>He bit back a groan. Of pleasure. Of pain.</p><p>Of need. And regret.</p><p>\u201cFrightened of me?\u201d he rasped. Of this. He would rather die than cause the same reaction as her boss.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Her eyes were watery, glassed over, but the tears had stopped. \u201cI\u2019ve just... I\u2019ve never been in this position before.\u201d</p><p>Never?</p><p>A sense of possessiveness filled him, hotter than fire, more lethal than a flood. \u201cDo you have any other questions for me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do.\u201d She hooked her fingers over the collar of his robe and rubbed, as if she experienced the same compulsion to touch. Her skin brushed against his, cool where he was overheated, soft where he was calloused.</p><p>Must wrap my arms around her and urge her closer...closer still...then mesh my lips against hers...kiss her...savor her. Devour her.</p><p>He didn\u2019t. One thought stopped him. He couldn\u2019t put his filthy, ugly lips on so innocent a female.</p><p>But...what if he did it anyway? What if he gave in? What if she liked it?</p><p>Temptation had arrived, he realized, whispering so prettily.</p><p>He resisted. Her fragile heart would give out from too much stimulation in one day. And maybe, just maybe, so would his.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll answer one,\u201d he croaked. \u201cJust one. I don\u2019t want to overload you.\u201d</p><p>She thought for a moment, nodded. \u201cDo the demons look like little monkeys?\u201d</p><p>Two circuits seemed to connect in his mind, and he frowned. There was only one way she could have known what one of the lowest-ranking demons looked like. \u201cYou saw the one in the office?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHim and many others. Two have even been hanging around Laila,\u201d she admitted shakily.</p><p>Yes, he\u2019d seen those two. One had been inside her. The other was his \u201cfriend.\u201d They ran away every time Koldo neared. \u201cThey\u2019ll continue to return to her as long as she feeds them.\u201d</p><p>Tension radiated from her. \u201cAnd if we\u2019re attacked by others?\u201d</p><p>Koldo would sense it. But...what if he didn\u2019t...or what if he couldn\u2019t get to her? \u201cCall upon the Most High. He\u2019ll send whoever\u2019s closest to help you.\u201d Germanus would never be as powerful as the Most High, and wouldn\u2019t hear a human\u2019s cries. More than that, he was limited in the number of troops he could send.</p><p>\u201cHow do you know that for sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe promised to rescue every human who calls upon Him, and He always keeps His promises.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEvery human. Even me?\u201d</p><p>His brows furrowed into his hairline\u2014or what had once been his hairline. \u201cAre you human?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHar, har. You know that I am. Wait. I am, right?\u201d</p><p>Do not smile. \u201cYou are. And now, I\u2019m ending this conversation.\u201d For both their sakes. \u201cThere are chores to be done, and hopefully I\u2019m man enough to do them.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER TWELVE</p><p>NICOLA WATCHED as Koldo stalked through her entire house, fixing everything that was broken, reinforcing the locks on the windows and doors, and even flashing in and out to stock her cabinets and refrigerator with food. All the while, she reeled.</p><p>The monsters she\u2019d seen as a child were real.</p><p>Demons had poisoned her and her sister.</p><p>The guy she couldn\u2019t stop thinking about wasn\u2019t even human.</p><p>She focused on him\u2014the least complicated. Was he naturally bald or had he shaved his head? There was no hint of stubble on his scalp, which led her to believe there were no follicles. But that hardly mattered. As beautiful as he was, he had no need of hair. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>And now that she knew what his back looked like under his robe, she found him more than beautiful; she found him breathtaking. Running parallel to both sides of his spine was scar tissue about twelve inches long and four inches thick. At one point in his life, he\u2019d had wings. Something or someone\u2014a demon?\u2014had cut them out. Now, crimson ink branched from both scars, forming glorious wings. The design was so amazingly detailed, each individual feather accounted for. And the muscles underneath those tattoos...sweet mercy.</p><p>How could a man who looked as fierce as he did be so kind? Or were the man and the Sent One intertwined? Could there not be one without the other?</p><p>And what about the smoldering fire in his eyes? Did it spring from a place of danger? Or desire?</p> <p>He finished stocking her cabinets and leaned against the half wall between her kitchen and living room. He folded his arms over his chest and nodded. \u201cSo you do know how to relax.\u201d</p><p>Har-har. \u201cIf you want to pamper me, I\u2019m going to let you pamper me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, I want to question you. Why do you work so hard?\u201d</p><p>What he was really asking: Why do you work so hard, yet live in such squalor? \u201cMedical bills\u201d was all she said.</p><p>He opened his mouth, closed it, then pushed out a heavy breath. \u201cI want to pay your bills,\u201d he said hesitantly, probably expecting her to fly off the couch and attack him for daring to suggest such a thing.</p> <p>As if such a kind proposition would offend her. \u201cI wasn\u2019t hinting or anything like that,\u201d she said with a smile. \u201cAnd wait a second. You have money?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA lot of money. Sent Ones are rewarded for our work. And I would like nothing more than to do this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d planned to pay your bills one way or another. This way, I can take the past-due notices stacked in the basket you\u2019ve labeled Doom with your knowledge rather than stealing them and perhaps earning myself a punishment.\u201d</p><p>To have such a huge financial weight lifted from her shoulders...to no longer live in fear of losing her house, having her utilities turned off, to be able to afford real Hostess Twinkies rather than a dry knockoff...</p><p>\u201cOh, Koldo.\u201d She leaped from the couch and threw herself against him. At first, he was stiff. After a few seconds, however, he softened and wrapped his arms around her. \u201cYes, yes, a thousand times yes. I accept. You\u2019re welcome, by the way,\u201d she teased in an effort to mask her trembling chin. \u201cI mean, I\u2019m such a giver, unwilling to allow you to be punished.\u201d</p> <p>He snorted, and it was such a gorgeous sound. \u201cThis pleases you, then? Makes you happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt does.\u201d Her heart thundered in her chest in a boom, boom, boom rhythm. \u201cI know I should feel guilty, too, like I\u2019m using you for your money or something, but I just can\u2019t summon the emotion.\u201d</p><p>He stiffened all over again, saying, \u201cIf you feel a shred of guilt, I will rescind my offer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou heard the part about being unable to summon the emotion, right? And you\u2019re loaded, aren\u2019t you? That\u2019s what \u2018a lot\u2019 means, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I\u2019m loaded,\u201d he said, the stiffness leaving him.</p><p>Of course he was. A dreamy sigh left her. \u201cYou have to be the sexiest male I\u2019ve ever met.\u201d Beauty, brains and megabucks.</p><p>He stilled.</p><p>Her words echoed in her mind, and she almost groaned. No. No, no, no. She hadn\u2019t just said that aloud. She couldn\u2019t have said that aloud. \u201cI mean, you have to be the sweetest man I\u2019ve ever met.\u201d</p> <p>He peered down at her, silent.</p><p>\u201cYou consider me sexy?\u201d he finally asked.</p><p>She had. She really had said it aloud. Heat filled her cheeks. To hide, she buried her face in the hollow of his neck. \u201cWhat would you do if I said yes?\u201d He might have touched her today, might have held her close, but she hadn\u2019t forgotten what he\u2019d said. I don\u2019t want you in that way.</p><p>\u201cI would tell you...that you have had a very eventful evening, and that you will have to wait until tomorrow.\u201d His voice was gruff. \u201cI would show you my reaction then.\u201d</p><p>And just what, exactly, would he show her?</p><p>Her heart fluttered as he set her away from him and strode to her kitchen table, where the Basket of Doom waited. He lifted it high\u2014and it disappeared.</p><p>She blinked, saying, \u201cUh, what just happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI placed the items inside a pocket of air.\u201d</p><p>She closed the distance between them and reached up, trying to feel the spot where the basket had last been seen, but she was too short. Even when she jumped. And jumped again.</p><p>His lips twitched at the corners. \u201cIs there a problem?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo not crack a short joke, Gigantor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery well. Allow me.\u201d Koldo wrapped his big hands around her waist.</p><p>The strength of his grip wrung a startled gasp from her, though he was nothing but gentle as he lifted her off her feet. She palpated the air. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing solid,\u201d she said, amazed.</p><p>\u201cThe pocket is a small doorway between the spirit realm and the natural.\u201d Slowly he set her back down.</p><p>\u201cRealm?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne for your world, and one for mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s so cool.\u201d She turned, intending to return to the couch.</p><p>He reached out and cupped the back of her neck, forcing her to stay. No, doing more than that. Tugging her deeper into the hard line of his body. Heat rolled through her, and she gave another gasp.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be afraid. Am I strong enough to force myself on you? Yes. Will I? No.\u201d His gaze pierced all the way to her soul. \u201cI\u2019ll never hurt you, Nicola.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d she said, and shivered. He was so intense. She flattened her palms on his chest, on the softness of his robe, the hardness of his muscles.</p><p>\u201cI told myself I wouldn\u2019t do this while the memory of what happened today is so fresh. But then I got my hands on you.\u201d He leaned down, coming closer and closer, his lips soon a whisper away from hers. \u201cNow I have a desire to replace the bad with the good. It\u2019s a desire I no longer want to resist.\u201d</p><p>Can\u2019t quite catch my breath. \u201cI like...the way you think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen we should start over. Do you find me sexy?\u201d</p><p>She gulped, softly admitted, \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Just like that, his pupils expanded, black consuming gold. \u201cVery well. My reaction.\u201d He lowered his head and pressed his mouth against hers, the contact soft at first, noninvasive, and yet still her head spun. Then he lifted his head and peered into her eyes. Whatever he saw must have encouraged him because he once again lowered. This time, his tongue flicked out, tasting her, and he moaned. Eager for more, she opened for him.</p><p>He swooped in, angling his head, hesitantly rolling his tongue against hers. At the moment of contact, a cascade of heat melted her bones, and she sank into him, her body suddenly smashed against his.</p><p>The force of the kiss increased, quickened.</p><p>This was... This was...</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d he rasped, and she wasn\u2019t sure whether he was asking a question or commanding her to like it.</p><p>\u201cPerfect.\u201d But perfect hardly seemed adequate.</p><p>Magnificent. Heady. Exquisite. No, they weren\u2019t good enough, either.</p><p>Her tongue met his, thrust for thrust, her fingers sliding through his beard, locking behind his neck, kneading of their own accord.</p><p>The horror of the day faded. Mr. Ritter ceased to exist. There was only this moment and Koldo. He\u2019d been right. She\u2019d needed something good to wipe away the bad.</p><p>\u201cAm I hurting you?\u201d he asked, and there was something in his tone. Something she\u2019d never heard before. Vulnerability, perhaps.</p><p>\u201cNo. Promise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot giving you enough?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re giving me plenty.\u201d</p><p>He lifted his head. Lines of tension branched from his eyes and mouth, and a bead of sweat rolled down his temple. \u201cMy blood is heating, practically in flames already.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMine, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were pleased?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery.\u201d Was he...unsure of his performance? Was that the problem?</p><p>Back down he went, not just kissing her but consuming her. His big hands roved over her back, up and down, up and down, then rode the ridges of her spine. As strong as he was, he managed to keep the touches light.</p><p>\u201cKoldo, I want... I need...\u201d More.</p><p>\u201cNicola,\u201d Laila called, her voice cutting through the tension.</p><p>Koldo jolted, then set her away from him, looked away from her and rolled his shoulders, as if he had wings he wanted to flare.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be back,\u201d he said tightly.</p><p>Wait. What? No! \u201cWhere are you going?\u201d</p><p>He ignored her, saying, \u201cI\u2019m commanding you to take the day off tomorrow. To rest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will. But\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. No buts. There will be no arguments. Remember?\u201d</p><p>He was using their bargain against her, she realized. So, what else could she say, but, \u201cDon\u2019t worry about me. I\u2019ll remain calm, be at peace and sow joy.\u201d Her voice was trembling. \u201cAnd thank you. For everything.\u201d</p><p>He nodded, but the action was stiff. \u201cDo us both a favor and guard your thoughts, your words.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d He nodded again, glanced at her lips, stepped toward her\u2014took another step and vanished.</p><p>Her heart skipped a beat.</p><p>\u201cCo Co?\u201d</p><p>What am I going to do with that man? \u201cComing, La La.\u201d</p><p>She raced into the bedroom on unsteady legs, only to grind to a halt, everything else suddenly forgotten. The sight that greeted her brought a fresh round of tears to her eyes. Her beautiful sister was here, home, and totally lucid. She was sitting up, with blond hair tangled around her delicate shoulders. Her color was healthier than before and bright, her gray eyes sparkling.</p><p>Nicola had never thought to have this again.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s here? Because, whoever he is, I like his voice. Very rough, very intense,\u201d Laila said, rubbing the sleep from her eyes before wiggling her brows. \u201cVery hubba hubba.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Just how much should she tell her? Nicola wondered. How much could Laila take right now, when she had believed nothing else Nicola had said on the matter?</p><p>Did the answers really matter? If Koldo was going to teach Laila how to survive, and he was, the two would have to come to an arrangement.</p><p>Nicola drew in a deep breath. \u201cWhat do you know about angels and demons?\u201d she asked.</p> <p>KOLDO FLASHED TO the cave where he\u2019d stashed his mother, remaining on the outskirts of the door to the cavern. He listened. Along with a drip and flow of water, he could hear Cornelia muttering about how much she hated him.</p><p>\u201c\u2014rotten to the core, just like his father. Lives only to make me suffer.\u201d</p><p>He ground his teeth together. How could she see him that way? Not now\u2014she had every reason now\u2014but before, when he\u2019d been such an innocent little boy, so desperate for her affection. After all these centuries, he\u2019d still never figured it out.</p><p>He\u2019d made the mistake of asking her only once.</p><p>Everything about you disgusts me! You\u2019re evil. An abomination. But you know that already. I\u2019ve told you.</p> <p>A thousand times or more. But I\u2019m innocent. Blood of your blood.</p><p>You carry my shame, nothing more.</p><p>His hands curled into fists. What would Nicola think of him now, standing here as a woman suffered at his hands? Nicola, who had enjoyed touching him. Nicola, who had looked at him as if he were worthy. Nicola, who had kissed him with such passion and asked for more.</p><p>He\u2019d had her in his arms. He\u2019d had her body pressed against his and her scent in his nose. He\u2019d felt the thunderous pound of her heartbeat. Need had created a wild tempest inside him, undeniable, nearly uncontrollable.</p><p>His hands had begun to burn just as fiercely as his blood, as if coming to life for the first time. Rather than sinking into a pit of despair\u2014bloodstained hands on a woman who deserved better\u2014he\u2019d reveled in the knowledge. Sent Ones produced essentia, a fine powder that waited underneath the surface of their skin. Koldo\u2019s had never broken free.</p><p>Soon, that would change. If he continued along this path, it would soon seep through his pores, leaving a bright glow on whatever he wished, a gold only those in the spirit realm would be able to see. It would be a warning to demons. Touch what\u2019s mine, and suffer.</p> <p>Had her sister not interrupted...</p><p>Well, he wouldn\u2019t think about that now. He flashed to Nicola\u2019s home, landing in the backyard. His mother had enough food and water to last a week. He wouldn\u2019t abandon her that long, but he would give her another few days to herself. How many times had she left him in the palace, taking the servants with her? Countless. At six years old, he\u2019d had to hunt and kill his own food to survive. She deserved this abandonment and more.</p><p>And he wouldn\u2019t feel guilty for the way he was treating her. He wouldn\u2019t!</p><p>He searched the yard for any sign of thieves\u2014either human or demon\u2014and thankfully found none. As he walked past the bedroom window, a crack in the curtains allowed him a peek inside. He paused.</p><p>Nicola and Laila were sitting on the bed. Both females had their hair wound into a thick bun, and green goop covering their faces. They were talking and laughing and painting each other\u2019s toenails. They paused every few minutes to pick up a pillow and smack each other.</p><p>The males he\u2019d overhead throughout the years had been right, then. Every time two human females got together, they had a pillow fight.</p><p>Such a circumstance had never before intrigued him. Now his attention remained riveted on Nicola. She was as relaxed and happy as he needed her to be. And she was utterly enchanting. The storm had settled in her eyes, leaving a bright morning light. A perfect, cloudless sky.</p><p>He\u2019d held her tiny waist in his hands. He\u2019d come close to fisting her hair. To taking everything she was willing to give. Perhaps he would one day. How would she react, though? As eagerly as she had tonight? Or would a little time and thought convince her of the truth\u2014that she deserved someone better?</p> <p>The rattle of a snake\u2019s tail reverberated behind him, claiming his attention. A sulfur-scented waft of smoke filled his nose.</p><p>Dread pricked at Koldo as he spun and drew a sword of fire. Two serp demons had closed in on him, one at the left, one at the right, and sank their fangs into his thighs. In less than a blink, an undiluted surge of venom shot through his system, valiantly attempting to weaken him.</p><p>You\u2019ll have to do better than that.</p><p>He released his sword, causing the weapon to disappear, and latched on to the creatures.</p><p>\u201cYour father sssaysss hello,\u201d one hissed.</p><p>\u201cAnd goodbye,\u201d the other laughed.</p><p>Koldo tied the two together and tossed them to the ground. They were long and thick, like snakes, with gnarled antlers growing from their heads, glowing red eyes and fur interspaced throughout their scales. There wasn\u2019t a more hideous creature. Their bodies writhed as they fought to escape each other\u2014and thereby him.</p><p>Too late. He reclaimed his sword long enough to slice, slice, removing both of their heads. Then he stood there, dumbfounded.</p><p>His father had said hello?</p><p>His father had said goodbye?</p><p>Serp demons were his father\u2019s allies, yes, but Nox couldn\u2019t have ordered an attack. He was dead. Koldo was sure of it.</p><p>They had to have lied. Demons always lied. Perhaps they\u2019d hoped to distract him. Because...why? They had friends nearby?</p><p>And sure enough, they did. As he straightened, two other serps flew from the shadows. The two were followed by another. And another. And another. Each converged on him.</p><p>The creatures had been following him, he realized. They had known where he would come, had left no tracks and had waited for the perfect moment to act.</p><p>Koldo grabbed as many writhing bodies as possible and tossed them into the grass. Once, twice, three times. Yet all the while still more came at him, biting him, shooting more venom inside him.</p><p>He formed the sword of fire. Hisses erupted at the first flare of light, and the vile creatures backed away from him. He stepped forward, prepared to give chase...only to stop. His knees collapsed, his legs no longer able to support his weight. He watched, horrified, as the demons slithered toward the house.</p><p>They would attack Nicola and her sister, and the girls, weak as they were, would crumble.</p><p>Can\u2019t let that happen. Koldo summoned every ounce of his strength and labored to his feet. He\u2019d never used his ability to send his thoughts into the mind of one of his fellow soldiers. He hated the idea of mental contact, a link, someone able to breach the barriers in his mind, as Zacharel often did, and perhaps read his innermost musings. But, to protect Nicola...</p><p>Need...help, he projected to a specific warrior.</p><p>He expected a thousand questions. Instead, the reply was simple. Where are you?</p><p>He rattled off Nicola\u2019s address, even as he struck out, flaming two demons to ash. Others crawled up the bricks, some branching left, some branching right, others going straight up. Koldo flashed one way, then the other, then to the roof, always striking out with his weapon.</p><p>\u201cWhoohooo!\u201d a familiar voice suddenly exclaimed. \u201cDaddy\u2019s here, and it\u2019s spanking time.\u201d</p><p>Axel landed in the front yard, his wings snapping against his back. He ran forward, drew his sword of fire and hacked, hacked, hacked at the enemy. Demons darted away from him, but he followed, spinning and striking, not allowing a single enemy to escape. He moved up, he moved down, he moved all around...all around... The world was spinning, spinning, spinning so quickly, Koldo thought. Faster and faster.</p><p>Panting, weakening still, he flashed to just behind Axel and fell to his knees. He would guard the warrior\u2019s back.</p><p>\u201cDude! I thought you needed help scoring a chick,\u201d Axel said, patting him on the shoulder and nearly drilling him neck-deep into the grass. \u201cI think that was the last of \u2019em but I\u2019ll do a double check around the perimeter.\u201d</p><p>Or just wait here. He ached terribly.</p><p>He heard footsteps. Whistling.</p><p>Hours later, or perhaps minutes, Axel returned and loomed over his prone form\u2014I must have tumbled the rest of the way to the ground\u2014his electric blues glowing with a strange, otherworldly light. \u201cYou stalking Chesticles or something? \u2019Cause, dude, this is totally her house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, and don\u2019t call her that.\u201d His throat was swelling, and he could barely force out the words.</p><p>\u201cMy bad. I didn\u2019t realize you\u2019d staked an official claim.\u201d</p><p>She was his charge, but had he staked a claim, even though he had yet to cover her with essentia? Maybe. He despised the idea of another male thinking about her, looking at her, or touching her.</p><p>\u201cThank you. For coming, I mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo problem. I was just doing someone unimportant.\u201d</p><p>Someone. Nice.</p><p>Sadly, that was the last thought Koldo had before his mind went blank.</p><p>CHAPTER THIRTEEN</p><p>\u201cYOUR UGLY FACE disgusts me,\u201d his mother shouted.</p><p>\u201cYou hesitated over a kill today,\u201d his father growled. \u201cYou must be punished.\u201d</p><p>Love me. Why can\u2019t you love me?</p><p>\u201cI wish you had never been born!\u201d His mother.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll make you regret the day you were born.\u201d His father.</p><p>Be proud of me. I just want you to be proud of me. For once.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not a Sent One. You don\u2019t deserve to breathe the same air as me.\u201d Again, his mother.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll make a soldier of you yet.\u201d Again, his father.</p><p>Please...please...</p><p>Koldo came awake gradually, his head a heavy block, his muscles sore and knotted. When full light at last dawned, he blinked rapidly, then gazed around. A barren cave with jagged, bloodstained walls greeted him. The air was cold, the warmth of his breath creating a thick haze in front of his face. He lay upon a stone dais, no blanket beneath him.</p><p>This wasn\u2019t one of his homes, he thought, jerking upright. Dizziness struck him, but he pushed through it, inhaling, exhaling.</p><p>\u201cEasy now,\u201d he heard Axel say.</p><p>Axel. Familiar. He relaxed, but only slightly, his attention cutting through the gloom and finding the warrior crouched in the corner, razing a stone against a short, broad stick to create dangerous spikes at the ends. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhere am I?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Eyes of crystal blue flicked up and stayed on him for only a second before returning to the weapon. \u201cOnly the best place ever\u2014my place. I carried you here. And by the way, you\u2019ll be getting the bill for my new back brace. Anyone ever tell you that you weigh, like, ten thousand pounds?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long?\u201d he croaked.</p> <p>\u201cThe bill\u2019s only one, maybe eight, pages long, you have my word. The good doctor said\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. How long have I been here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Three days.\u201d</p><p>Three days? Nicola had been on her own for three days. After he\u2019d promised to spend at least an hour a day with her. But now he could spend far more than an hour, couldn\u2019t he? Zacharel had placed her in Koldo\u2019s constant care.</p><p>He might have failed her on day one.</p> <p>He threw his legs over the side of the dais, and despite the return of the dizziness, stood. He waited until his vision cleared, then looked down at himself. He wore a long white robe, the material as clean as he was. In fact, he was as clean as if he\u2019d just taken a couple hundred showers.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d Axel said, holding out the stick, closing one eye and zeroing in on one of the ends of the weapon. \u201cI checked on your girl. She\u2019s fine. And I mean that in every sense of the word.\u201d</p><p>He left that last part alone. \u201cThe serps stayed away from her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. They were too dead to move. But she does have two minions hanging around.\u201d</p><p>Two minions were hanging around Nicola? Had Lefty and Righty returned? If so, they would have to be dealt with\u2014permanently. \u201cAnd the other girl? The blonde?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait.\u201d Frowning, Axel set the weapon aside and peered over at him. \u201cYou mean the redhead is yours?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes. Why? Did something happen? Did she see you?\u201d Want him?</p><p>Rage blossomed...</p><p>\u201cUh, no. Nope. Not at all. She\u2019s fine, too.\u201d</p><p>...receded. \u201cYou\u2019re sure?\u201d he asked, watching for any sign of a lie. The smacking of his lips. The wrinkling of his nose. A deeper frown. Axel displayed none of those.</p><p>\u201cI am.\u201d Easily stated. Expression relaxed.</p><p>Very well. The demons were hanging around Laila, then, and he\u2019d already known that. \u201cThank you,\u201d he said, only slightly grudging.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be collecting, don\u2019t worry.\u201d</p><p>Koldo would have said the same, and couldn\u2019t blame him. \u201cCollect from me. Not her.\u201d He\u2019d promised to pay her bills, not to add to her tab.</p> <p>Axel rolled his eyes. \u201cAs if there was ever any doubt. She\u2019s got nothing I want.\u201d He wiped his hands on the towel draped over his thigh before digging a piece of melon out of the bowl beside him. \u201cHere. Eat.\u201d</p><p>Koldo caught the fruit and bit into the juicy center. Sweet flavors exploded on his tongue, and his body purred gratefully. Sent Ones could die in a number of ways, and starvation was a big one.</p><p>Thank the Most High, Koldo had had the foresight to stock Nicola\u2019s cabinets before leaving her. She had been well fed during his absence. And thank the Most High forevermore, Axel had been willing to see to her defense.</p><p>But Koldo wanted to do more than rely on another Sent One for such a thing. If anything like this ever happened again\u2014not that it would, Koldo never made the same mistake twice\u2014Axel might be too busy to check on Nicola. He might lose interest, or decide Koldo had nothing of value to offer in trade.</p><p>I\u2019ll have to mark her, Koldo thought. Not just with the essentia, but with ink. He would code her.</p><p>The Most High had made a blood-covenant promise to the Sent Ones. In exchange for obeying His laws, they were given protection. Koldo hadn\u2019t been kicked from the heavens, therefore the promise still applied to him, and the code was still etched into his heart. And because Nicola was his charge, his responsibility, the promise now extended to her. But he would have to give her an outward sign of it.</p><p>He would etch the code into her flesh, and that code would be able to create a barrier between her and any demons that dared approach her. All she would have to do was concentrate on the numbered sequences during an attack. The more she stared at her tattoos, the stronger the power of the code would become, until finally expanding, covering her entire body and shielding her.</p><p>But if a demon managed to distract her...</p><p>Not going to happen, Koldo assured himself. He would train her for that, too.</p><p>\u201cSo why were the serps after you?\u201d Axel asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to know the answer to that, as well.\u201d Was his father still out there or not?</p><p>Koldo hadn\u2019t seen Nox\u2019s body, had only watched as grenade after grenade soared toward him, the unsuspecting male not knowing to flash away. There\u2019d been multiple booms and an intense wave of heat, flames drenching the ground and bouncing into the sky.</p><p>Should have killed him up close and personal. But Koldo had had a choice. Destroy Nox face-to-face\u2014or destroy the man and everything he\u2019d worked for in one swoop. Koldo had chosen the latter.</p><p>When the fires eventually died, he\u2019d dug through the rubble and found too many bones to count.</p><p>If Nox had survived, why was he making himself known now? How had he tracked Koldo to Nicola\u2019s home?</p><p>\u201cSo, what do you plan to do with the redhead?\u201d Axel asked.</p><p>\u201cWhy do you live in a place like this?\u201d Koldo retorted. \u201cYou clearly thrive on what you probably consider adoration from your peers, and yet you seclude yourself.\u201d</p><p>A pause.</p><p>\u201cSo we agree not to question each other,\u201d the warrior finally replied.</p><p>\u201cWe do.\u201d They both had their secrets. Koldo finished off the fruit. \u201cAnd now I must go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, but uh, hey,\u201d Axel said, standing. \u201cYou might want to hunt down your girl and give her a stern talking-to. Normally I wouldn\u2019t tattle, even on a human, but if I keep quiet this could really come back to haunt me. Meaning, you\u2019ll want to punch my pretty face.\u201d</p><p>Rambling? Now? \u201cJust tell me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s planning to go on a date with another guy.\u201d</p><p>FUMING, KOLDO FLASHED to Nicola\u2019s home. He wasn\u2019t sure what he\u2019d do when the two of them were face-to-face. He only knew he had to see her. But she wasn\u2019t there, and another flash proved she wasn\u2019t in her office. Jamila and another girl, the blonde with the mysterious origins, were in her office, and the two were hurtling curses at each other\u2014while the girl had a male pinned to Nicola\u2019s desk, her fingers curled around his neck, his pants and underwear pooled at his ankles.</p><p>\u201cSleeping with every guy here?\u201d Jamila spat. \u201cReally? That\u2019s your master plan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPart of it,\u201d the blonde smirked. At least her clothing was in place. \u201cSo why don\u2019t you do me a solid and get lost? And next time knock before you enter an office.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure, I\u2019ll go. By the way, your plan is stupid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, your hair is stupid.\u201d</p><p>Females.</p><p>Jamila bared her teeth in a scowl. \u201cWhat does this accomplish?\u201d she asked, waving a hand in the male\u2019s direction. \u201cI mean, really.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen the girlfriend finds out what he\u2019s done, she\u2019ll be hurt, want to cry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t have a girlfriend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. He has a love interest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you want to hurt her, why?\u201d</p><p>The blonde grinned evilly.</p><p>The male\u2019s cheeks were bright red as he struggled to sit up, but the girl was obviously stronger and managed to hold him down without any effort.</p><p>Koldo stepped into the natural world. \u201cWhere\u2019s Nicola?\u201d he demanded.</p><p>All three gazes swung to him.</p><p>The blonde paused for a moment, momentarily rendered speechless. Then she shook her head, blinked and smiled slowly, wickedly, an invitation and a declaration. \u201cWell, hello, handsome. What can I do to help you?\u201d</p><p>The male increased the fervency of his struggles. He would have spoken, but his tie was stuffed into his mouth.</p><p>Jamila scowled at Koldo, as if her predicament was his fault. \u201cYou! Even though Little Miss Human is your responsibly, Zacharel told me to stay here.\u201d</p><p>A detail he didn\u2019t care about. \u201cI\u2019ll ask again. Where is she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHer sister showed up and they went to lunch. They mentioned a park.\u201d</p><p>\u201cForget about her,\u201d the blonde said. \u201cYou\u2019ll be better off with me. I\u2019ll take care of you in a way she never will. Just give me a chance.\u201d</p><p>A park. Very well, he would search every one nearby.</p><p>Without a word, he stomped from the office. The human had been too distracted during his arrival to notice his sudden appearance, but he certainly wouldn\u2019t miss Koldo\u2019s departure.</p><p>The blonde called out a protest, and she actually sounded angry. Not that he cared about that, either.</p><p>Once he cleared the reception area, and knew no prying eyes were locked on him, he flashed to the park closest to the office. Searched. Found no sign of her. Next, he tried the one closest to her house. Searched. And\u2014</p><p>Spotted her.</p><p>Laila was beside her, the two walking along a cobbled path, talking and laughing and eating chocolates. The pair of demons perched on Laila\u2019s shoulders spotted him, hopped to the ground and darted away.</p><p>Some of the tension faded from Koldo\u2019s shoulders. This kind of interaction was good for both of the females. They were relaxing, enjoying themselves, purging the poison. He would leave them to it, he decided. Without yelling at Nicola for making a date with another man.</p><p>He flashed to her house and began to box up her things. He wanted her installed in one of his homes by the end of the day. There would be no discussion, no debate. And this had nothing to do with her decision to turn to another man for her joy.</p><p>Nothing at all.</p><p>Nicola would probably cry because of Koldo\u2019s actions. He would have to calm her down, do something to make her happy\u2014but he would also have to harden his heart. The move was for the best. He would be able to protect her better.</p><p>But he would have to bring her back for the date, wouldn\u2019t he? Because...what if the male did indeed bring her joy? What then? She would need him. He would help her purge even more of the demon toxin. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Flickers of rage danced through Koldo, and he found himself breathing far more heavily, battling the urge to punch the walls.</p><p>If he gave in to his temper, Nicola\u2019s home would topple.</p><p>He was a little rough with the boxes in the back of her closet, the things inside clinking together. He checked to make sure he hadn\u2019t broken anything and found a box of photos. The more he flipped through the prints, the more his actions gentled. There were shots of Nicola and her sister, and the two of them with their parents, as well as a redheaded little boy. He looked just like them, had to be a relative, but...who was he? A brother? Nicola had never mentioned him, and he had never come around. In all the information Koldo had uncovered, nothing had been mentioned.</p> <p>Intrigued, Koldo dug deeper into the box. He found articles about her parents\u2019 death and learned a drunk driver had slammed into their car, killing the couple as well as their young son, Robby, and that the driver had been released from prison last year.</p><p>Nicola had lost more than Koldo had ever realized. She had lost a healthy six-year-old brother with a bright future, a boy who had most likely owned prime real estate in her heart.</p><p>She must despise the man who had ruined her life. She had to dream of his painful demise. She had to crave revenge. She just hadn\u2019t been well enough and hadn\u2019t had the time or resources to do anything about it.</p><p>Perhaps Koldo would hurt the male on her behalf. Punishment or not. Perhaps then she would like him more than this other\u2014</p><p>He shook his head violently, stopping the thought before it could fully form. Koldo wasn\u2019t interested in earning anyone\u2019s affection. He\u2019d tried that before, and he\u2019d failed miserably. He\u2019d vowed never to do it again, and it was a vow he would keep. And paying Nicola\u2019s bills wasn\u2019t an attempt to earn anything, he told himself. He needed Nicola relaxed, that was all.</p> <p>Finish this.</p><p>Yes. He would keep her in...Panama\u2019s Chiriqui Province, he decided, and flashed most of her things to one of his more opulent homes. There were lush green mountains in every direction, and a blue sky filled with puffy white clouds. The weather was springlike and constant all year round. The food was fresh, organic and homegrown, and would nourish both Nicola and her sister in the best of ways. They would thrive here\u2014whether they liked it or not.</p><p>Unpacking her belongings took very little time. She owned so little. Well, he would buy her and her sister a new wardrobe. And the clothes wouldn\u2019t be an attempt to win their affections, either, but a simple gesture of kindness. A welcome-to-your-new-home gift.</p><p>But what did he know of human fashion? Nothing.</p><p>He knew someone who did, however.</p><p>Koldo flashed into the foyer of Zacharel\u2019s home and called out a greeting. A few seconds later, the mist thinned and Annabelle stepped into view, wearing a T-shirt and jeans. Her blue-black hair was swept into a ponytail, reminding him of Nicola, and her golden-brown eyes gleamed merrily.</p> <p>She smiled when she spotted him. \u201cHey, Koldo. Zacharel\u2019s not here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not here to see him.\u201d</p><p>Her smile fell into a frown of confusion, and she glanced behind her. When she refocused on him, she tapped at her chest. \u201cMe, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. I need a favor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA favor?\u201d</p><p>Would she question everything he said?</p><p>\u201cBut we\u2019re out of Water,\u201d she added.</p><p>\u201cI know that. I need...\u201d Ugh. Was he really going to do this? he wondered, then pictured Nicola in a lacy pink top and a pair of tiny shorts he\u2019d once seen a human female wear. A strange burning ran from his nose to navel. Yes, he was really going to do this. \u201cI need to take you shopping.\u201d</p> <p>Annabelle rubbed at her ears. \u201cWait. Did you just say mopping? Is your home dirty and you want a maid? Because I know a warrior like you would never say my favorite S word.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid someone say the S word?\u201d a female called out. \u201cBecause I couldn\u2019t help but overhear your conversation as I was eavesdropping.\u201d</p><p>Excited twittering echoed. Footsteps followed. Then four of the women in Zacharel\u2019s army stepped through the mist. Charlotte, Elandra, Malak and Ronen.</p><p>He would rather have battled a horde of demons than face these women. They were trained soldiers, monsters on the battlefield, cold, callous killers, and yet they liked to twitter incessantly about nothing.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you shopping for?\u201d asked Charlotte, a lovely brunette with bold features and dusky skin. \u201cA new sword? Well, good news. I\u2019ve got one I know you\u2019ll love, and with my friends with benefits package, it\u2019ll only cost you a portion of your soul.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you guys to stay back and stay quiet,\u201d Annabelle scolded.</p><p>\u201cYou mean that wasn\u2019t just a suggestion?\u201d said Ronen, a black-haired vixen with an addiction to popcorn.</p><p>Elandra was the shy one of the group, and she looked down at the floor, where the hem of her robe swirled. She was, by far, the most beautiful female Koldo had ever seen. Or had been, until he\u2019d met Nicola. From the top of her head to the soles of her feet, Elandra reminded him of a living diamond. Her long white hair sparkled. Her silver eyes sparkled. Her pale skin sparkled.</p><p>Malak was the only one in the group with a flaw, though she hid it well. There was a large round scar in the center of her forehead, probably from an injury she\u2019d received when she had been too young to regenerate. Her hair, which had been dyed a bright green, sported thick bangs to hide it.</p><p>\u201cGive the man a chance to explain,\u201d Annabelle said.</p><p>The females stared at him, expectant.</p><p>Koldo had no idea what they\u2019d done to land in Zacharel\u2019s Army of Disgrace. Unless their irritating personalities had been the deciding factor.</p><p>He looked to Annabelle, saying, \u201cMy...woman\u2014\u201d Wait. Was that what Nicola was to him? He wasn\u2019t sure, considering she would soon be going on a date with another man. And were his teeth elongating like his father\u2019s when the man was enraged?</p><p>He would have to be more careful.</p><p>\u201cI have a friend,\u201d he added a little more harshly than he\u2019d intended, and stopped himself from going on. She wasn\u2019t that, either. \u201cI have a human, a female, and she\u2019s in need of new clothing.\u201d</p><p>The Sent Ones exclaimed excitedly. Ronen even jumped up and down and clapped. \u201cJuiciest gossip ever,\u201d she said. \u201cKoldo has a gurl-friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI bet she\u2019s ten feet tall and six hundred pounds of muscle,\u201d Charlotte exclaimed.</p><p>\u201cGet. Give us some privacy,\u201d Annabelle told them, shooing them away.</p><p>Though they frowned and pouted, they obeyed.</p><p>\u201cOkay, so let me get this straight,\u201d Annabelle said. \u201cYou want to take me, rather than your woman, friend, human, female, to pick and buy these clothes?\u201d</p><p>Yes. He would hurt her feelings right now. He might ruin her newfound happiness. \u201cI don\u2019t wish to wait,\u201d he said through gritted teeth. Truth. He wanted this done, out of the way. \u201cAnd...I don\u2019t know what females prefer.\u201d</p><p>Her hand fluttered over her heart, and she grinned. \u201cZacharel once had the same problem with me. So why don\u2019t you buy her what you would prefer to see her wear?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will buy her what I like, yes\u2014\u201d because he wouldn\u2019t be able to help himself \u201c\u2014but I would like her to have choices.\u201d He had to get this right. That way, she would have no reason to refuse the gift.</p><p>\u201cDo you even know her sizes?\u201d</p><p>He held up his hands. \u201cShe\u2019s tiny, like this. Delicate.\u201d</p><p>Annabelle laughed, the sound carefree. \u201cOh, you are in so much trouble, buddy. But yeah, okay. I\u2019ll help you.\u201d</p><p>Relief was as potent as a drug. \u201cFor a price, of course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope. Not at all. I know that\u2019s how you guys like to operate, but this one\u2019s free of charge. Just invite me to the wedding, and we\u2019ll call it good.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER FOURTEEN</p><p>\u201cYOU\u2019VE GOT TO TRY THIS.\u201d Laila shoveled a piece of chocolate into Nicola\u2019s mouth before she had time to form a reply.</p><p>Chocolate contained caffeine, so very rarely did she allow herself to indulge. But when she did... The gooey goodness delighted her, and she closed her eyes to savor. A mistake. She and her sister were in the process of strolling along the cobbled path winding through the park, and she bumped into a trash can.</p><p>The thud brought Laila\u2019s attention around, and her twin burst out laughing. \u201cKooky Co Co kicks a carton.\u201d</p><p>Empty wrappers, half-eaten sandwiches and Starbucks cups spilled onto the concrete, yet Nicola smiled as she cleaned the mess. How wonderful to hear her sister\u2019s amusement. When she finished, she dug the antibacterial gel from her purse and slathered her hands.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got chocolate on your chin,\u201d Laila said, trying to be calm but failing. The gray of her eyes glimmered gorgeously. The sun cast bright, golden rays over skin that hadn\u2019t seen the outdoors in months, illuminating her, making her radiate health and vitality.</p><p>Nicola wiped her face with the tips of her fingers. \u201cBetter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMuch. Now you\u2019re almost as pretty as me.\u201d Pretending a vanity she\u2019d never possessed, Laila studied her decimated cuticles. \u201cNotice I said almost.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomeone needs glasses. Your hair is blond but your roots are red,\u201d Nicola replied, giving her ponytail a flip. \u201cIt\u2019s quite hideous.\u201d</p><p>Laila gasped with mock outrage. \u201cI\u2019ll have you know this look is all the rage right now. Total style and sophistication.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t follow trends. I make them.\u201d</p><p>Grinning, her sister held out her hand. \u201cYou are so totally lame. Come on, walk with me.\u201d</p><p>They linked fingers and resumed their stroll. The tranquillity of the moment helped diffuse the memories of the attack\u2014something she hadn\u2019t shared with her sister. Memories kept trying to rise to the surface of her mind. While she was in the shower. While she selected today\u2019s underwear. While she cooked breakfast.</p><p>Once, she\u2019d almost broken down and cried. But then she\u2019d remembered Koldo\u2019s kiss, his sweet, sweet kiss. His uncertainty. His vulnerability. His desire to make sure she was enjoying herself. And everything had changed. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He was such a big, strong warrior. There was a time she would have bet nothing could shake his confidence. But then she had.</p><p>As if her opinion mattered to him.</p><p>\u201cI could hear you at the hospital, you know,\u201d Laila said, delving into a subject they had previously avoided.</p> <p>\u201cReally?\u201d She\u2019d always wondered. Had always hoped.</p><p>\u201cYes, and you kept me there longer than I wanted to stay. Anytime I would feel myself drifting away, you were right there to tug me back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat makes me happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut not me. I was ready to go.\u201d</p><p>The words were like a fist to the gut. \u201cWell, I\u2019ll never regret holding on to you, La La. I love you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd I love you, too.\u201d Laila\u2019s smile was sad. \u201cBut, Co Co, if we\u2019re ever again in that situation, I want you to let me go.\u201d</p><p>Nicola stopped, forcing her sister to do the same. They faced each other, right there in the middle of the path, causing the people behind them to trip to the side in an effort to avoid slamming into them.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said with a shake of her head. \u201cI won\u2019t. I\u2019ll fight for you with every bit of my strength.\u201d And Koldo would fight with her. Right?</p><p>She wanted to believe it, but he\u2019d seemed to abandon her. He\u2019d promised to give her an hour a day, to teach her, to train her, and then he\u2019d vanished for good, leaving her to believe he regretted showing her so much vulnerability.</p><p>And why shouldn\u2019t he? She had nothing to offer him. He was tough, fierce and knowledgeable. She was weak, defenseless and ignorant of the truth.</p><p>Exasperated, Laila spread her arms. \u201cBe practical about this.\u201d</p> <p>Expecting a twenty-three-year-old girl to die of heart disease was practical? \u201cKoldo says we have to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cUgh. Koldo this, and Koldo that.\u201d Laila anchored her hands on her too-tiny waist. She\u2019d gained weight since her release from the hospital, but not enough. \u201cHe\u2019s all you ever talk about anymore. Whoever he is, he\u2019s lying to you, my love. Why can\u2019t you see that? He\u2019s not an angel any more than I\u2019m the tooth fairy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right. He\u2019s not an angel. He\u2019s a\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, I know, but it doesn\u2019t matter. If he\u2019s so concerned with our health, where is he?\u201d Her sister\u2019s tone gentled as she added, \u201cWhy isn\u2019t he here, giving me this information himself?\u201d</p><p>Her shoulders drooped. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>A mother pushed a stroller around them as Laila reached out and tugged at the end of Nicola\u2019s earlobe. In the background, a dog barked. \u201cHe\u2019s not a Sent One, whatever that is. He\u2019s a con man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve seen him pop in and out of thin air.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve seen an illusion.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cJust wait until you meet him.\u201d</p><p>Laila tsked with a mix of exasperation and pity. \u201cDarling, he\u2019s only looking to sell you a miracle cure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. He\u2019s giving me a miracle cure and paying our bills.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you think.\u201d</p><p>Nicola swallowed a sigh. No matter what she\u2019d said, or what angle she\u2019d tried, her sister had rejected all things Koldo. She\u2019d called Sent Ones \u201ca romantic idea.\u201d She\u2019d scoffed at the concept of demons.</p><p>Frustration and upset had tried to take up residence inside of Nicola\u2014neither of which she welcomed, per Koldo\u2019s orders. She just... She had to get through to her sister. Laila\u2019s life was in danger. She needed saving, and Nicola would do whatever was necessary to save her.</p><p>Laila shook her head, saying, \u201cYou only believe him because you have a crush on him. Your eyes go dreamy every time you talk about him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot!\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo!\u201d</p><p>Laila dropped the empty box of candy and they began a slap fight, giggling like the girls they used to be, before sickness and fear and loss had taken such a vicious toll. But Laila sobered all too soon, too busy fighting for breath.</p><p>Nicola picked up the box and tossed it in the nearest trash can, then reclaimed her sister\u2019s arm to urge her forward. She\u2019d missed this kind of interaction. A few years ago, she\u2019d gone to the local community college and Laila had opted not to \u201cwaste what little time she had.\u201d Then Nicola had gotten a job at Estell\u00e4 and Laila had focused on her art. Then, Laila had gotten sick. Well, sicker. After that, Laila had stopped painting and had started spending every free minute inside a doctor\u2019s office or in bed.</p><p>\u201cI promise you,\u201d Laila said. \u201cThere isn\u2019t a demon following me around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot right this second, no.\u201d</p><p>Another sad smile was cast her way. \u201cYou\u2019re seeing things again, that\u2019s all. That\u2019ll stop, just like before.\u201d</p><p>No, it wouldn\u2019t. Not this time. Nicola\u2019s spiritual eyes had been opened, and she would never shut them again. But she didn\u2019t want to spend her lunch hour arguing. \u201cSo, listen. I already said yes to this, and I\u2019d love for you to join me. Just...promise you\u2019ll keep an open mind when I tell you about it, okay? Please.\u201d</p><p>Laila\u2019s brows drew together with confusion. \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA guy at work asked me out. Asked the two of us out, really. On a double date, not anything weird,\u201d she rushed to add. Some men heard the word twins and their minds went to strip clubs and tag teaming.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m intrigued so far. Go on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYesterday I called him and accepted. For me, not for you.\u201d And she\u2019d only debated three hours before picking up the phone\u2014and another hour after that. She\u2019d just gotten tired, and maybe a little resentful, of waiting for Koldo to appear, of hoping for something more than a conversation and a kiss with him, of dreaming of what might have happened if Laila hadn\u2019t interrupted them, of wondering how he would look at her the next time he saw her. Tenderly? Fiercely? Or as coldly as a teacher with his student?</p><p>And what if he wasn\u2019t allowed to date? Or, what if he was already committed to someone and forever off the market?</p><p>A fiery fog rolled through her mind, and she experienced what she suspected was a killing rage. If that sleazebag had a girlfriend...</p><p>\u201cUh, Co Co?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d she snarled.</p><p>\u201cNothing. Nothing,\u201d Laila said, holding up her hands, palms out. \u201cYou just tell me when you\u2019re ready and not a moment sooner, and I won\u2019t wonder what this little mini makeover is all about. I mean, one second I was talking to my big sis, and the next I was staring at a serial murderer.\u201d</p><p>Calm down. Just calm down. Already her heart was pounding erratically, and if she wasn\u2019t careful she would pass out. Or worse, strengthen the demon toxin. And really, this was silly. She was raging for nothing. Koldo wasn\u2019t the type to cheat. He was the type to just flat out tell you he was done with you.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s the sis I know and love,\u201d Laila said. \u201cSo...continuing our previous convo. You accepted a date with a coworker.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. And I\u2019d love to call him back and accept on your behalf. The other guy\u2019s name is Blaine and he\u2019s\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop right there. The rest of the deets don\u2019t matter. I\u2019m in!\u201d</p><p>After Laila\u2019s last disastrous relationship, Nicola had expected a little resistance. \u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally. I\u2019m not sure how much longer I\u2019ve got to live, so yeah, I\u2019ll be doing anything and everything I possibly can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat includes listening to what Koldo has to say, I hope.\u201d</p><p>Laila stuck out her tongue. \u201cWe\u2019ll see. So, what\u2019d this guy at your office have to do to get you to say yes? You\u2019ve always been oblivious to the male population.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have not. I just didn\u2019t want to have to deal with all the complications.\u201d And, okay, yes, the argument fell a little flat considering Koldo brought more complications than most.</p><p>A shirtless guy in blue shorts grinned as he jogged past Laila. \u201cHey, beautiful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d She returned the grin with one of her own, and even waved, causing him to slow and then stop, clearly determined to approach. Her sister saved him the trouble and closed the distance.</p><p>Sighing, Nicola stepped off the path to wait. Another five minutes, and she\u2019d have to head back to work.</p><p>She sidestepped a man walking his dog and\u2014</p><p>Saw a shaved Koldo?</p><p>No, not Koldo, she realized with disappointment. A few yards away stood a male with the same body type as Koldo, with a bald head and bold features almost eerie in their similarity. This male wore a black shirt and black leather pants, and both were molded to his skin. He was, perhaps, ten or twenty years older than Koldo, the skin around his eyes and mouth lined. He was handsome, but he was without a sexy, beaded beard.</p><p>They had to be related, though. There was no way two guys could look so much alike and not spring from the same family line.</p><p>She waved, only to freeze in place when he reached up to stroke...a snake. A large snake with fur sticking out from underneath sickly green scales and the long, multipoint antlers usually only seen on deer. The rest of the creature\u2019s body coiled around the man, the tail shaking and rattling. Its eyes were as red as rubies\u2014and watching her intently.</p><p>Not a snake. That thing couldn\u2019t be a snake. A...demon?</p><p>Evil wafted on the breeze, a hint of sulfur in the air. Oh, yes. A demon. And demons caused sickness, Koldo had said\u2014and probably a thousand other things she wanted no part of.</p><p>No way this man was any kind of Sent One.</p><p>\u201cLaila,\u201d she called hollowly.</p><p>\u201cJust a sec,\u201d Laila replied. \u201cI\u2019m currently memorizing a very important number.\u201d</p><p>The jogger chuckled.</p><p>The bald man grinned at Nicola, but it wasn\u2019t a nice grin. A gaze as dark as the night perused her from head to toe, reminding her of the leering Mr. Ritter. Her heart, already amped up from the chocolate, kicked into an erratic beat.</p><p>Nicola raced forward and grabbed her sister\u2019s hand, tugging her a few steps backward. \u201cCome on. We have to get out of here.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d the jogger began.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Laila said, turning her back on him to concentrate on Nicola. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you see that man over there?\u201d</p> <p>Laila glanced to the right. \u201cBaldy? Yeah. So?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about his pet snake? Do you see it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh, he doesn\u2019t have a pet snake. Or a dog or a cat or a bird. Honey, are you okay? You\u2019re pale and shaky.\u201d</p><p>Her sister still couldn\u2019t see the demon, then. \u201cCome on.\u201d She pivoted and quickened her pace, dragging Laila with her.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d her sister demanded.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll tell you later.\u201d The park was crowded with moms and their kids, dads and their dogs, as well as businessmen and women out on their lunch break like her, hoping to soak in a little sun before crawling back inside the shadows of the daily grind. She maneuvered around them, but wasn\u2019t quite at her best and ran into a few.</p><p>She heard \u201cHey!\u201d and \u201cWatch it!\u201d multiple times, and had to mutter a few hasty apologies. Her blood chilled to a dangerous level, even as her skin threatened to overheat. Sweat rolled down her spine.</p><p>\u201cSlow down,\u201d Laila huffed.</p><p>She cast a glance behind them. The man was still there, still grinning at her, and still stroking the demon. But he wasn\u2019t following her. Relieved, she slowed...slowed...and finally halted.</p><p>Panting, Laila pressed her palm over her heart. \u201cCan you tell me what that was about now?\u201d</p><p>She opened her mouth to do just that\u2014only, another demon slithered from the tree beside her, baring long, sharp fangs with dripping ends, and the words formed a jagged knot in the center of her throat, only a few gurgling sounds escaping.</p> <p>Nicola stumbled to the right, tugging Laila with her.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you\u2014\u201d</p><p>A woman stepped from around the thick trunk, and Laila closed her mouth. The newcomer was bald, just like the man. Her skin was as pale as milk, which was a striking contrast to the black mist seeping from her pores.</p><p>\u201cDo you see that?\u201d Nicola demanded of her sister. \u201cThe mist?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. But the woman...\u201d</p><p>The corners of the woman\u2019s lips lifted in a slow grin...revealing fangs of her own.</p><p>Nicola\u2019s heart skipped a beat as she once again launched into motion, heading in another direction. \u201cThey\u2019re after us,\u201d she rasped. \u201cWe have to get out of here!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho...are they?\u201d Her sister could barely get the words out. Neither one of them was used to this kind of activity. \u201cWhat...do...they...want?\u201d</p> <p>Nicola glanced back. The woman remained just under the tree, but the demon had opted to follow Nicola and was closing in fast, its scaled and furry body dragging over the ground, its antlers shaking.</p><p>What did it want with her? What would it do to her if it caught her?</p><p>Another bald man stepped in her path, grinned evilly, and she screamed. She jerked Laila to the left, heading in the only uncharted direction. A second...third...fourth demon followed this time, slithering, slithering so quickly, as if they\u2019d just scented the afternoon meal: two gimpy mice.</p><p>\u201cNicola, please,\u201d Laila pleaded. \u201cI can\u2019t...take much...more.\u201d</p><p>She wanted her sister to see what was happening around them, to finally believe, but she also didn\u2019t want her sister to see. Fear would probably consume her, and fear would do her no good right now.</p><p>No one else seemed to realize what was happening. People went on with their day, smiling and laughing and flying kites, completely unaware of that other realm currently teeming with malevolence.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t...\u201d Laila ripped from her hold and hunched over, gasping for breath. \u201cYou have to...\u201d</p><p>Nicola backtracked, leaped in front of her sister and spread her arms, expecting the demons to attack. But they surprised her. They skidded to a stop a few feet away, gravel and twigs settling around them. Vile red gazes locked on her.</p><p>She fought a wave of dizziness, her eyesight dimming. Not now. Please, not now. The creatures circled her, but she couldn\u2019t move with them and continue protecting Laila\u2019s back; there were too many of them to watch all at once.</p><p>\u201cGo away,\u201d she demanded.</p><p>One hissed at her. Another spit at her, spraying whatever dripped from its fangs. The others flashed razor-sharp teeth stained crimson, as though blood was a morning obsession.</p><p>\u201cGo away or...or...I\u2019ll ask the Most High for help.\u201d Yes. That\u2019s what Koldo had said to do.</p><p>To her utter shock, the hissing and the spitting morphed into whimpering, and the creatures began to back away from her.</p><p>Already, it was working. \u201cMost High,\u201d she shouted, hit by a sudden wave of confidence. \u201cIf you can hear me, I could really use your help right now.\u201d</p><p>The demons froze in place\u2014before slowly backing away from her.</p><p>It was working, she realized.</p><p>\u201cMost High,\u201d she repeated more loudly, and terror fell over the creatures. They quickened their pace, desperate to get away from her. But they weren\u2019t fast enough. Two warriors unfamiliar to her shot from the sky and swooped into the park. Their wings were the color of cerulean and they wore robes of the most brilliant white.</p><p>Nicola threw her arm around her trembling sister, who was still hunched over, gasping for breath. \u201cEverything will be okay now. I know it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy heart...\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust breathe in...out... Good girl.\u201d She watched, wide-eyed, as the Sent Ones\u2014angels?\u2014unsheathed double-edged swords and attacked. The demons darted in different directions, too many for the two warriors to contain. But she should have known they would find a way. They flashed to one and hacked, then to another and hacked, then to another and another, their opponents swiftly decreasing.</p><p>\u201cDo you see them?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cSee who?\u201d Laila said through gasps.</p><p>Well, that answered that.</p><p>At last the battle was over, and no one on the other team was spared.</p><p>The warriors returned their weapons to their sheaths and looked to Nicola. They inclined their heads in greeting, flared their wings and, without a word, shot back into the sky.</p><p>CHAPTER FIFTEEN</p><p>THE FRONT DOOR of Nicola\u2019s home swung open, the hinges moaning in protest. The two females marched inside.</p><p>\u201c\u2014almost killed me,\u201d Laila was saying.</p><p>\u201cNo, I was protecting you,\u201d Nicola retorted.</p><p>\u201cYes, but from what?\u201d</p><p>Finally. They had returned.</p><p>Koldo rose from the couch, the only piece of furniture he\u2019d left behind since he\u2019d had no room for it. A little while ago, he\u2019d sensed that Nicola was in trouble. But he\u2019d flashed to the park and she hadn\u2019t been there. He\u2019d flashed to all the other places she liked to visit, but had had no luck.</p><p>He\u2019d returned to her house, where he\u2019d waited. And waited.</p><p>Now, relief failed to overshadow his anger. Where had she been? What had happened to her? He needed to know. Not because she was his charge. Not because he would be penalized if something happened to her. But because. Just because.</p><p>He searched her in a single glance. Her color was higher than usual, and worry glazed those storm-darkened eyes. Her hair was a mess, tangled and sporting several pieces of grass.</p><p>Nicola ground to an abrupt halt, and Laila slammed into her from behind.</p><p>\u201cKoldo,\u201d Nicola said, exasperation giving way to nervousness. She ran a hand down the length of her ponytail. \u201cYou\u2019re here.\u201d</p><p>A moment passed in silence. He wanted to demand answers, but he held his tongue. He would shout, and she would fear him, and that would only strengthen the demon toxins.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re Koldo?\u201d Laila asked, her tone incredulous. She had zero color in her cheeks, and fatigue dulled her eyes. \u201cBut you look just like\u2014uh, never mind. There\u2019s no way I can say that and not insult you. And I\u2019m rambling. I\u2019m sorry. It\u2019s just that you\u2019re so big and...well, never mind.\u201d</p><p>He had been mentioned by name. He wondered what all had been said.</p><p>\u201cWait. Hold everything.\u201d Frowning, Nicola turned in a circle. \u201cI think I was robbed. My pictures are gone. And so are my vases and blankets and pillows. Everything but my couch.\u201d</p><p>I can have a conversation without raising my voice. I can. A tiny human female could not anger him more than his mother and his father ever had. \u201cYou weren\u2019t robbed. I moved everything to my house in Panama. Now, I want you sitting at the kitchen counter in the next two minutes. Or else.\u201d He didn\u2019t wait for her reply, just stomped into the desired room.</p><p>To his surprise, she dogged his footsteps, even caught his wrist. He could have easily tugged from her grip. Instead, he reveled in his first contact with her in three days. Far too long. He had to feel this soft, soft skin, and those hands\u2014no longer cold, but warm\u2014every day or he would not be content.</p><p>\u201cOr else, what? And what\u2019s going on?\u201d she demanded. \u201cWhy did you move my stuff to Panama?\u201d</p><p>He swung around and anchored his hands onto her waist. He lifted her up, swung back around with her as she yelped, and placed her on the nearest chair. There. He had her where he wanted her, the tattoo equipment on the counter and ready to use.</p><p>As he put the pieces of the gun together, he said, \u201cI don\u2019t want you living here any longer. It isn\u2019t safe.\u201d</p><p>She searched his face, and sighed. \u201cApparently, it isn\u2019t safe anywhere.\u201d</p><p>Not the reaction he\u2019d expected. \u201cWhy do you say that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe were at the park and several demons chased us.\u201d</p><p>His instincts had been right. She had been in danger. And he had failed to protect her. He could have lost her. Stupid, foolish, unwise, ignorant man! Yes, that\u2019s what he was. He should have searched more diligently. Should have done something. Anything. \u201cDid they hurt you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she replied, and he was able to relax. \u201cYou told me to call upon the Most High, and I did. He sent in the troops. Whoever was closest, I guess, just like you promised.\u201d</p><p>Thank You, Most High. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAlleged demons.\u201d Laila strolled into the kitchen. \u201cAll I saw were giants. And I\u2019m the twin sister, by the way. Just so you know, I\u2019m not quite as gullible as my darling Co Co. Sorry, honey,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t mean any offense.\u201d</p><p>Nicola offered a small though genuine smile. \u201cI know. I also know that you\u2019ll come to eat those words one day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDemons are very real, I assure you,\u201d Koldo said, opening the packages of ink.</p> <p>\u201cYeah, and you\u2019re a Sent One.\u201d Laila anchored her hands on her waist. \u201cListen, you\u2019re taking advantage of an innocent\u2014humph!\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d dropped the gun and grabbed her, tugging her into the hard line of his body. With a final look at Nicola, who jumped from the chair, possibly to attempt to free her mouthy sister, he flashed to the roof of a training facility in Germanus\u2019s realm of the skies.</p><p>The huge building was perched atop a mile-long cloud, the edges of that cloud dipping into an aqua sky, stars twinkling even during the day. Laila looked down, down, down at the earth so very far away, and screamed with bloodcurdling fear.</p><p>\u201cStill think I\u2019m taking advantage?\u201d He didn\u2019t wait for an answer but flashed the girl inside the building, to the room where Sent Ones were taught how to fight demons. Once there, Koldo remained in the spiritual realm, forcing Laila to open her inner eyes and finally see.</p><p>A young trainee swung a sword of fire as two envexa darted from floor to ceiling, ceiling to wall. The warrior had wings of white with thin strips of gold, an indication of his warrior status. Joy-bringers possessed wings of solid white. The Elite, like Zacharel, possessed wings of solid gold.</p> <p>Though fully grown, the demons were the size of ten-year-old boys, with thick humanoid bodies and skin as green as toxic slime. They had hooks rather than hands, and long, thin tails with barbs.</p><p>Laila trembled against Koldo, her mouth opening and closing, small gasping sounds emerging.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re real,\u201d he said, \u201cand they\u2019re evil. They roam the earth, stalking humans like you, and would love nothing more than to ruin your life and cut it short. And you have been letting them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan overcome them, yes. I\u2019m here to help you.\u201d Taking pity on her, he flashed her back to Nicola\u2019s living room and gave her a little push toward the hall. \u201cYou may go to your room now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cR-room. Yes. Thank you.\u201d With her arms wrapped around her middle, she tripped her way around the corner. A door clicked shut.</p> <p>\u201cWhat did you do to her?\u201d Nicola demanded, stomping forward and banging her fists into his chest.</p><p>As slight as those fists were, he barely registered the impact. \u201cI proved that demons do, in fact, exist.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should have eased her in. She had a tough day, and that kind of stress couldn\u2019t have been good for her toxin levels.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome people can be eased. Some must be shoved. Now we will return to the kitchen. I\u2019ll tattoo your arms and you\u2019ll tell me everything that happened at the park.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait. What? Tattoo my arms?\u201d she squeaked.</p><p>He urged her forward. \u201cFor your added protection against the demons.\u201d</p><p>A little dazed, she flopped into the chair. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you about the park,\u201d she said quietly, \u201cbut first you\u2019re going to tell me about this move. Then we\u2019ll talk about the tattooing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy home is fortified against evil.\u201d He owned a cloud of defense, and that cloud now surrounded the property, acting as a barrier against the rest of the world. \u201cYours isn\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo buts. I was attacked the last time I was here. That\u2019s why I\u2019ve been gone. I was recovering.\u201d</p><p>A gasp slipped from her. \u201cYou were hurt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Koldo. I\u2019m so sorry. I had no idea.\u201d She placed her hand over his, a gesture of remorse, kindness.</p><p>A gesture that caused his blood to flash-heat to white-hot.</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t your fault,\u201d he said, his voice rough. He was responsible for his own distraction. \u201cNow, what happened at the park?\u201d</p><p>She propped her elbows on the counter, ending the contact, and he wanted to howl.</p><p>He was that needy for her?</p><p>Pressing his tongue against the roof of his mouth, he finished with the ink. He\u2019d chosen a deep, rich red that, at first glance, would cause most people to assume she was bleeding. But he didn\u2019t exactly care what other people thought. He wanted her tattoo to match his.</p><p>She was his charge, after all. There was no more to it than that.</p><p>For the first time in his life, he thought he tasted a lie and grimaced.</p><p>\u201cThese demons...\u201d She shuddered. \u201cThey weren\u2019t like the monkeys. They were worse. They were snakes! They slithered from the trees and on the ground and chased after us, and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSnakes?\u201d he interjected, his stomach twisting.</p><p>\u201cWith antlers! And fur! They cornered us, surrounded us, and that\u2019s when I called out to the Most High, and He sent angels\u2014or maybe Sent Ones. They had large blue wings. A blue like I\u2019d never seen before, radiant and sparkling, almost like a waterfall of glitter. And their robes were the brightest white I\u2019d ever seen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReal angels.\u201d He nodded. \u201cContinue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere was a battle, and then, boom, the angels had won, the demons were gone and Laila and I were able to walk out of the park uninjured.\u201d</p><p>So. The serps had returned for Nicola the very day Koldo awoke from their poisoning. That couldn\u2019t be a coincidence.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll never regret being inked,\u201d he told her. \u201cWhat I put into your flesh will protect you, as the angels protected you today, but it will also do what they can\u2019t. It will strengthen you when you\u2019re at your weakest. Let me. Please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut...but...\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave I ever lied to you? Ever steered you wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she admitted softly.</p><p>He reached out and traced his finger along the curve of her jaw. \u201cLet me do this,\u201d he repeated. \u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>A moment passed. Finally, determination hardened her features and she removed her sweater, rolled up her shirtsleeves. \u201cVery well.\u201d</p><p>Relief and satisfaction collided, and he wanted to pound his fists into his chest. She trusted him fully, nothing held back. That was a first, and he would do everything in his power to earn what she\u2019d bestowed upon him. \u201cI wish I could tell you otherwise, but this will hurt, Nicola.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had a feeling,\u201d she said drily.</p><p>Before she could change her mind, he got to work. At first, as the needle pounded into her skin, she cringed and she gasped. Twice he almost stopped, but both times he reminded himself that this was for her good. This was necessary.</p><p>\u201cDistract me.\u201d Her voice was strained. \u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me...how you age. Or if you ever will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was a little boy once, a child to my parents.\u201d Now, he and his mother looked to be the same age. \u201cI matured normally, like a human, until reaching the age of thirty. After that, my appearance remained the same. And as long as I live, my appearance will stay this way.\u201d</p><p>That was true of most supernatural races. The Nefas, however, aged to fifty before stopping. He supposed it was because the vileness of their deeds rotted their souls, and rotted souls produced rotted flesh.</p><p>Koldo was glad the characteristics of the Sent Ones were stronger than those of the Nefas, allowing him to have hair, diffusing the black smoke.</p><p>\u201cSo...one day I\u2019ll be an old lady but you\u2019ll still look like a young, virile Viking?\u201d</p><p>A Viking? That\u2019s how she saw him?</p><p>And...she was right about the age thing, he realized. He\u2019d never given the notion any thought because he\u2019d never imagined himself with a human. But there was a way to prevent such an outcome. Zacharel had tied his life to Annabelle\u2019s, ensuring she no longer aged. But if one died, the other would immediately follow. Koldo couldn\u2019t make that same commitment to Nicola. He would have to share a piece of his tainted soul, and that he would never do.</p><p>And why should he bother sorting out his feelings on the matter now, anyway? She was interested in another male.</p><p>\u201cYes\u201d was all he said, and left it at that. \u201cIs there anything else you\u2019d like to know?\u201d</p><p>Nicola sucked in a breath as the gun glided over a sensitive tendon. \u201cWill you do this to Laila?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf she will allow me.\u201d He leaned back, studied the etchings. The scripted numbers began at her elbows and coiled all the way to her wrists.</p><p>161911213327.</p><p>219113215122231.</p><p>2209131520825418.</p><p>\u201cDone,\u201d he said, pleased.</p><p>Nicola\u2019s head tilted to the side as she looked over the red, swollen flesh. \u201cIs that some sort of code?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what does it mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat you are protected by the Most High, and His strength is yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery cool.\u201d She traced a fingertip over several of the numbers. \u201cThere\u2019s something so mesmerizing about each one, isn\u2019t there? Almost as if they\u2019re alive, holding my gaze captive.\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s because they were, on both counts. \u201cThe next time you see a demon, simply stare at the numbers as you\u2019re doing now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStare? Really? And that will...what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSave your life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, all right, then.\u201d</p><p>The cinnamon and vanilla scent of her wound around him, melding with his skin, claiming his attention. \u201cNicola?\u201d he rasped.</p><p>She glanced up at him, licked her lips. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Whatever he\u2019d meant to say, he forgot. He found himself stalking around the counter, standing just in front of her, between her legs. His hands tunneled through her hair, the strands soft, silky, tickling his skin.</p><p>She closed her eyes and leaned into his touch.</p><p>He wanted to kiss her. But he couldn\u2019t. Not again. Every time he neared her, the desire grew. He wasn\u2019t sure how he would react if it grew any more. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Throw her down and take her? Kill the man she actually wanted?</p><p>\u201cWill you move to Panama with me?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She licked her lips. \u201cYou\u2019ll be there with me?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes.\u201d He dared anyone to try and pry him away.</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019ll be happy to have me, even though I have nothing to offer you?\u201d</p><p>Nothing to offer him? She was the gentle touch he\u2019d always craved. The acceptance he\u2019d never before had. And when she looked at him, he never felt as if he was a nuisance, as if he was beneath her. He felt...empowered.</p><p>But all he said was \u201cI\u2019ll be happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I would love to,\u201d she replied without a single beat of hesitation.</p> <p>\u201cGood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn two conditions,\u201d she added, blinking open her eyes.</p><p>He stepped back, increasing the distance between them. \u201cAnd those conditions are?\u201d</p><p>She gulped and shifted uncomfortably in her seat. \u201cYou have to bring us back on Saturday. We, uh, well, we have a double date.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d known, but hearing the words from her lips caused every ounce of his earlier fury to return\u2014times ten. \u201cYou\u2019ll not be going on any date, Nicola.\u201d</p><p>Her mouth fell open, snapped closed. \u201cI already said yes.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd now you\u2019ll say no.\u201d</p><p>A moment passed in stilted silence.</p><p>\u201cIs that so?\u201d she said with a quiet fury of her own.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s so. You must do what I say, when I say. Remember?\u201d</p><p>She drummed her fingers over the counter. \u201cYou once told me to do whatever was necessary to remain calm. You once told me to do whatever was necessary to find peace and sow joy. Well, the date seemed like my best bet at the time. So which would you have me do? Please you, or save my sister and myself?\u201d</p><p>He clenched his jaw painfully. It was just as he\u2019d suspected\u2014and no matter his feelings, he couldn\u2019t take this away from her. \u201cVery well. Go on your date.\u201d The concession scraped his throat, left it raw and burning.</p><p>Perhaps, while she was out with the male, Koldo would return to the Downfall. Perhaps he would allow the Harpy to dance for him. Perhaps he would kiss and touch the Harpy, and forget everything Nicola had ever made him feel. He wouldn\u2019t ruin the Harpy, and the Harpy wouldn\u2019t blame him for her troubles.</p><p>Yes, that\u2019s what he would do, even though every cell in his body rebelled at the thought.</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the second condition?\u201d he demanded.</p><p>She exhaled with force. \u201cYou have to take me to my job at Estell\u00e4 every weekday morning, and pick me up every evening.\u201d</p><p>Yet another blow he was unprepared to deal with right now. \u201cYou won\u2019t quit?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I have to make a living.\u201d</p><p>Was that all? \u201cI\u2019ll pay you to live with me.\u201d</p><p>Again her mouth fell open. \u201cNo. You won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m paying your bills. One is the same as the other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, no, it isn\u2019t. I won\u2019t be dependent on you for my future.\u201d</p><p>Understanding took root, and it didn\u2019t sprout a pretty flower patch. It had gnarled limbs and dripped with blood. She would allow Koldo to clean up her past, but she was afraid he would muddy up her future\u2014the one she planned to share with another male.</p><p>\u201cVery well,\u201d he said stiffly. \u201cI agree to your terms.\u201d And he would do more than take the Harpy. He would take others. So many others! As many as it took to find someone who made him feel the way Nicola did. Or had. Right now, the only thing he wanted from her was distance. And, all right, an apology.</p><p>\u201cNow I know you\u2019re related to the guy in the park,\u201d she said snippily. \u201cYou look just like him when you glare like that.\u201d</p><p>Guy at the park? He didn\u2019t allow himself to leave. \u201cWhat guy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, the demons were with some very scary people. People as tall as you, with bald heads, even the girl, and fangs and a terrible black mist that rose from their bodies. And the first one I saw looked like an older version of you.\u201d</p><p>At first, he was too stunned to react. But as he breathed, his thoughts aligned and the shock gave way to dread.</p><p>His father had survived the bombing.</p><p>His father was here in Kansas.</p><p>His father, he thought, dazed\u2014the vilest male he had ever encountered.</p><p>\u201cDid any of them touch you?\u201d he demanded.</p><p>\u201cNo. They just looked at me and smiled the meanest of smiles.\u201d</p><p>He should be relieved, but his emotions were simply too volatile. His father had approached Nicola. His father could have harmed her in the worst of ways. He could have absconded with her, and Koldo wouldn\u2019t have known what had happened to her until too late. But Nox hadn\u2019t done any of that. He\u2019d wanted Koldo to know of his return.</p><p>How like the man, to deliver fear before the battle. And there was no question there would be a battle. Nox was here for revenge. After all, Koldo had destroyed the male\u2019s entire camp. His harem of lovers, both slave and free. The best of his warriors. The bulk of his allies. Now, he hoped to hit Koldo where it would hurt most. Destroying the first female Koldo had ever taken under his care.</p><p>Well, I won\u2019t let him. Koldo would have to find a way to strike first. To end this. Now. Forever.</p><p>He tugged Nicola to her feet. \u201cGet your sister. I want you installed in my home within the hour.\u201d</p><p>KOLDO FLASHED NICOLA and Laila to the living room of his ranch. \u201cLook around,\u201d he said, doing his best to mask his growing tension. Probably failing. \u201cChange whatever you want. Eat whatever you want. I\u2019ll be back.\u201d</p><p>He hated to leave them so abruptly, without any more of a welcome, but his next task couldn\u2019t wait.</p><p>As Nicola sputtered out a protest, he flashed to the cavern where his mother was stashed. This time, he didn\u2019t hang around outside but stalked inside. With a single glance, he had the details memorized. Cornelia was dirtier than before, her robe stained with mud and blood, the hem frayed. Her short hair was matted at the sides. She sat in the corner of the cage, and there was a rat perched on her hand\u2014a rat she was feeding a piece of grain.</p><p>She spotted Koldo and cursed. \u201cCan\u2019t you just leave me alone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour precious lover is stalking my woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have no lover,\u201d she spat.</p><p>\u201cOh, but you do. My father, the man you\u2019ve pined for all these years, thinks to strike at me.\u201d</p><p>Cornelia stiffened as she absorbed his words. The moment she accepted them as truth, she actually tossed the rat at him, the creature screaming along the way. Koldo caught him, set him down and watched as he scampered away.</p><p>Your first mistake was assuming she had a heart, little guy.</p><p>\u201cCruel even to your pets,\u201d Koldo said.</p><p>She trembled, visibly fighting to keep her temper under control. If he wasn\u2019t mistaken\u2014and he had to be mistaken\u2014there was a gleam of regret in her eyes.</p><p>\u201cI thought he was dead,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cAs did I. We were both wrong.\u201d</p><p>Watching him intently, Cornelia stood on unsteady legs. \u201cIf he\u2019s after you, you\u2019re doomed. He\u2019s crafty, and there\u2019s nothing you can do to stop him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can kill him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd that worked so well for you before?\u201d she mocked with a hard laugh. \u201cEspecially now that you have a woman, did you say? I\u2019m surprised one can actually stand to look at you.\u201d</p><p>His woman. That\u2019s what he\u2019d called Nicola, wasn\u2019t it? He would have to better guard his words, for the human was not his, not in that way, and now, she would never be. She had chosen another male. And Koldo couldn\u2019t really fault her\u2014even though he was still so angry he could tear this cavern apart rock by rock. She would be better off with one of her own kind.</p><p>\u201cYou should probably say goodbye to her.\u201d Cornelia traced her fingertip along the bars beside her and grinned happily. \u201cHe\u2019ll do the most horrendous things to her, and he\u2019ll force you to watch. But you share his blood\u2014maybe you\u2019ll like that, huh?\u201d</p><p>Koldo punched the cage so forcefully the reinforced steel bent backward.</p><p>Cornelia paled, backed away.</p><p>He had been forced to watch such behavior while chained inside Nox\u2019s tent, and he had vomited every time. Had even tried to behead the man the first hundred times he was allowed to walk freely through the camp\u2014and he had always been disciplined for his efforts. He would never\u2014never!\u2014enjoy watching such treatment.</p><p>\u201cI protect what\u2019s mine,\u201d he gritted out. \u201cBut you protect no one. Did you witness such events when you were with him, huh, Mother? Did the two of you discuss it while you were snuggled in his arms?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up!\u201d She changed course, stomping forward. When she reached him, she gripped the very bars he\u2019d harmed and attempted to shake them.</p><p>\u201cI bet you did. I bet you were eaten up with jealousy when he turned his attentions to another.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know nothing about me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you\u2019re exactly like him, a pretty face hiding rotten bones. And just so you know, I will kill him before he hurts the girl.\u201d He should shut up. He should leave. His temper was overtaking him. If he wasn\u2019t careful, he would erupt. But his feet felt anchored in place. \u201cYou\u2019ll help me. Not because you love me, but because you want him to suffer for abandoning you. Isn\u2019t that right?\u201d</p><p>She popped her jaw, some of the anger leaving her. \u201cI do want him to suffer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen tell me. What are his weaknesses?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou spent the most time with him. You should know.\u201d</p><p>He should, shouldn\u2019t he? But then, to him, Nox had been the pinnacle of strength, an unstoppable force. Koldo had been surprised to deliver the deathblow, especially from a distance.</p><p>Should have chosen up close and personal, as I craved.</p><p>Then, he should have taken the time to identify all of the remains. But he\u2019d assumed Nox had been burned to ash\u2014had wanted to believe it so badly.</p><p>Mistakes, he realized now. He wouldn\u2019t make another. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWill you help me or not?\u201d he demanded.</p><p>Cornelia lifted her chin, haughty despite her circumstances. \u201cI will not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot even for a human?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, I\u2019ll help a human. Any but yours,\u201d she added.</p><p>Koldo tried to calm his raging nerves. A thousand times these past few weeks, he could have killed this woman. But he\u2019d never even bruised her.</p><p>As a child, he\u2019d only ever wanted her love. Offered freely. And when it was clear he wouldn\u2019t be getting that, offered through bribes. Yet time and time again she had rejected and denied him.</p><p>In that moment, peering into her defiant, hate-filled face, his restraint vanished. His control finally snapped. He\u2019d had enough.</p><p>For once, she would know the pain he\u2019d experienced at her hands. For once, she would understand the depths of betrayal. For once, she would fear the things Koldo could do to her.</p> <p>\u201cLet\u2019s see if I can change your mind, shall we?\u201d He withdrew a razor from the air pocket at his side and flashed into the center of the cage\u2014the only way in or out. \u201cI look like my father, even though I despise him. I think it\u2019s only fair that you look like him, too, since you\u2019re clearly still in love with him.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widened, and she backed away from him, as far as she could possibly get. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t dare,\u201d she cried. \u201cMy hair has only just begun to grow back.\u201d</p><p>Her words merely proved how little she knew about him. \u201cJust like you wouldn\u2019t dare to take my wings?\u201d</p><p>She leaned toward the left, then darted to the right, trying to avoid him as he closed in. \u201cYou disobeyed me. You had to be disciplined.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot that way.\u201d Koldo flashed to just in front of her and latched on to her upper arms. It was their first contact since he\u2019d carried her out of the depths of hell and brought her here. She was thinner, practically skin and bones, reminding him of Laila. Laila, the very image of Nicola. But that didn\u2019t soften him, either, and wouldn\u2019t stop him. In fact, it made him far angrier.</p><p>\u201cYour only goal was to make me suffer,\u201d he said, shaking her. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p> <p>He shouldn\u2019t have asked. He regretted the question immediately, and knew it revealed the hurt he\u2019d never been able to shed.</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t allow you to turn out like him,\u201d she said, and all the fight vanished from her. She peered up at him with more of that hatred. \u201cI should have known it was a useless cause.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m nothing like my father! \u201cSo you despised him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she hissed.</p><p>\u201cYet you slept with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes! All right? Yes. I could tell you he tricked me. I could tell you it was a moment of weakness. What do you want to hear?\u201d</p><p>His grip tightened as he gave her another shake. \u201cThe truth.\u201d</p><p>Utterly calm, she said, \u201cYou were a mistake. That\u2019s the truth.\u201d</p> <p>With her words, she ripped a scab off his heart, and the wound bled into his soul. \u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d he said, wishing he were emotionless. Instead, he was so torn up inside he wasn\u2019t sure he would ever be able to put himself back together. \u201cI was a mistake. And now I\u2019ll show you why.\u201d</p><p>He pushed her face-first into the ground, held her down with a knee in the center of her back and, while she screamed and tried to fight her way free, removed every strand of her hair, until he scraped her scalp clean.</p><p>The sound of a woman screaming, the sight of her struggling, caused so many terrible memories to rise. But even when he closed his eyes and shook head, the images wouldn\u2019t leave him.</p><p>He\u2019d never stopped being the man his father had made him, he realized. And he never would.</p><p>CHAPTER SIXTEEN</p><p>\u201cSENT ONES, CO CO. Sent Ones,\u201d Laila whispered as Nicola tucked her into bed.</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDemons, Co Co. Demons.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, sweetheart. But we don\u2019t have to fear them, and Koldo assured me they won\u2019t be able to hurt us.\u201d And now, having witnessed what happened in the park, her confience in Team Good was untouchable.</p><p>\u201cHow did I not know they were out there? Why could I not see them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour eyes were closed. Now they\u2019re open.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...I...I\u2019m not sure I can deal with this.\u201d</p><p>Nicola remembered when they were little girls and Laila had tucked her into bed after she\u2019d seen her first monster. How gentle and patient and kind her twin had been. \u201cYou\u2019ve always been the strong one. You\u2019ll find a way.\u201d</p><p>A soft, humorless laugh left a sense of sadness behind. \u201cYou always thought that. You always thought I was strong. But, Co Co, it was you. Always you.\u201d Laila stuffed her ears with the buds from the iPod Nicola had given her for their last birthday. She\u2019d scrimped and saved for months to afford such a little piece of technology.</p><p>Sighing, Nicola kissed her sister on the cheek and left her to her rest. Not knowing what else to do, she explored Koldo\u2019s home. Awe continually struck her, and she felt as though she had entered a fairy tale rather than a third-world country. The house itself was built of pine, and smelled rich and clean, but the furniture was what really stunned her.</p><p>There were velvet couches and chairs, ornately carved tables. Glass figurines, and bowls filled with diamonds, sapphires, rubies and emeralds as big as her fist. There were tapestries on the wall, and plush carpets on the floor. And that was just the living room!</p><p>Koldo really was loaded.</p><p>The kitchen boasted gold-veined marble countertops, copper pots and pans hanging from a sterling silver rack, and a large refrigerator that blended with the cabinet woodwork. Nothing was out of place. Not a speck of dust had settled onto the surface of the hand-carved table.</p><p>There were four bedrooms. Laila had claimed the one closest to the kitchen, and Nicola picked the one at the far end of the hall. There was a huge monster-size bed in the center, the rails draped by sheer pink lace. Pink? Lace? In a warrior\u2019s home?</p><p>Had a female decorated?</p><p>Nicola bit the side of her cheek, fighting a tide of jealousy. The comforter was a lighter shade of pink, but no less brilliant. And this must have been where Koldo had wanted her to stay because the blankets her mother had sewn a few weeks before the car crash were folded and resting at the edge.</p><p>A bejeweled ceiling fan whirled slowly overhead. A mural of the heavens had been painted on all four walls, with a bright sun in the right corner, shining upon clouds of every size and shape.</p><p>At the left was a large bay window overlooking a thriving grove of orange trees. And behind the lush green leaves and plump pieces of fruit, she could see several mountains and even a volcano blowing thick smoke through the air. There were three breathtaking ponds, with fish that jumped up and cleared the surface.</p><p>Nicola stood there, amazed by the beauty, watching as the sun set on the horizon, reds and pinks forming, creating the perfect contrast to the lush greens and blues of the sloping land. Birds sang.</p><p>How long would Koldo want her to stay here? She\u2019d thought...hoped...well, it didn\u2019t matter anymore. Koldo hadn\u2019t wanted her to go on the date\u2014a wonderful sign\u2014but she\u2019d gotten so angry she\u2019d insisted. How silly. Especially considering the fact that she\u2019d only accepted the date because he\u2019d disappeared those three days.</p><p>Now he was back...but she was stuck.</p><p>What was she going to do?</p><p>A rustling of clothing behind her had her spinning. Koldo stood a few feet away from the bed, with his head down and his hands clenched. Strands of hair stuck to his face and chest, both dark and light. Dirt streaked his skin. He had bite marks on his hands. His breathing was deep and even, but he was using too much force, as if the hold he had on his calm facade was tenuous.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d All thoughts of the dating disaster left her, and she raced over to him. \u201cWere you attacked again?\u201d</p><p>Silent, he just sort of fell back into the plush chair behind him.</p><p>Worry filled her as she crouched in front of him and rested her palms on his rock-hard thighs. Heat radiated from him, enveloping her, and she shivered for a reason that had nothing to do with temperature.</p><p>\u201cTalk to me,\u201d she prompted. \u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>Golden eyes beseeched her to...what?</p><p>She\u2019d never seen him like this. So torn up. So tortured.</p><p>So broken.</p><p>\u201cKoldo.\u201d What else could she say?</p><p>He leaned back, his head thumping against the wooden arch. \u201cI...did something. Something terrible. It was deserved. I should be thrilled with the results, but...but...\u201d</p><p>What could he possibly have done to cause this kind of reaction? \u201cTell me.\u201d</p><p>He scrubbed a hand down his face. \u201cAnd watch hate fall over your features, too?\u201d Like Laila, he laughed without humor. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>The strands of hair floated from him and into the air, twirling to the ground. He likes jokes. Tease him. \u201cYou gave someone a mullet, didn\u2019t you?\u201d she asked with a small smile.</p><p>He closed his eyes, pushed out a breath and lifted his arms up and back with fierce force, punching a hole in the wall. The sharp boom jolted her.</p><p>Such a reaction... Had he actually given someone a mullet? \u201cKoldo\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he croaked, focusing on her. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have done that.\u201d</p><p>Okay, so maybe not a mullet, but his doom and gloom definitely had something to do with the hair.</p><p>\u201cMake me forget,\u201d he pleaded. \u201cJust for a little while. Tell me a story.\u201d</p><p>She would do anything to bring him peace. But what could she tell a centuries-old warrior to entertain him? Oh, I know! \u201cOne time, a girl in my class called me and Laila freakazoid Frankensteins because of the tubes coming out of our clothing\u2014and I know, I know, it\u2019s a very original name, but I digress. It made Laila cry. Notice that I said Laila. Not me, just so we\u2019re clear. I did not spend twenty minutes in the bathroom, leaning against a very unsanitary toilet, sobbing so hard snot was bubbling from my nose.\u201d</p><p>The slightest measure of pain faded from his expression, and he ghosted his hand over the line of her jaw. \u201cWhat happened next?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She shivered as she said, \u201cYou have to guess what very polite, very mannerly thing I did to pay the little wench back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGuess.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou, hard-core punk that you are, called her a very naughty name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope. I punched her in the face and broke her nose. No one calls my twin sister a freakazoid Frankenstein and gets away with it. Let that be a lesson to you. You might want to write that down and circle it.\u201d</p><p>He barked out a laugh. A very rough, very hoarse laugh, leading her to believe he hadn\u2019t laughed in years. If ever. And she had been the one to bring him to that point, pushing him past his upset, drawing him out of miry darkness and into light. And oh, he was beautiful like this.</p><p>So badly she wanted to rise up, crawl into his lap and kiss him. Just press her lips into his, taste him, relearn him and offer comfort in another way. But after their fight...</p><p>\u201cAnother story,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll give you a question instead.\u201d And probably sound needy, but she didn\u2019t care. \u201cDo Sent Ones date?\u201d Obviously they kissed, but...</p><p>His brow furrowed, as if the change of subject confused him. \u201cSome do.\u201d</p><p>Don\u2019t do this. Don\u2019t press. \u201cDo you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Oh. The very disappointment she\u2019d denied crashed through her. \u201cNever?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever.\u201d He looked at her, really looked at her, his golden gaze boring deep. His arms lowered to his sides. His hands gripped the fabric of the chair, as if he had to force himself to be still.</p> <p>To keep from punching another hole in the wall\u2014or from doing something else?</p><p>\u201cIf I told you I had tortured another Sent One,\u201d he said, \u201cwould you think I was a monster?\u201d</p><p>Would she? \u201cDid you?\u201d</p><p>Silence.</p><p>Yeah. He had. And he\u2019d felt the action, whatever it was, had been deserved. Wasn\u2019t that what he\u2019d said a moment ago? But still he regretted it, whether he realized it or not.</p><p>\u201cWhat I\u2019ve learned over the years is that people shouldn\u2019t be defined by a single mistake. Everyone messes up,\u201d she said. \u201cYou have to forgive yourself and move on.\u201d</p><p>He ran his tongue over his teeth. \u201cWhat makes you think this was my first mistake?\u201d</p><p>She sighed. \u201cYou\u2019re missing the point, Koldo.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t matter. Whatever the point, I can\u2019t forgive myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can. It\u2019s not a feeling, but a choice\u2014and then acting on that choice. And I know I\u2019m supposed to be the one seeking joy, but it\u2019s clear you need it, too. I think your unwillingness to let go of this, whatever this is, is as much a toxin as what the demons cause.\u201d</p><p>Another round of silence.</p><p>Well, wisdom hadn\u2019t worked. She would try humor again. \u201cI mean, seriously. All the best therapists on TV say that focusing on the past causes stagnation. And diarrhea.\u201d</p><p>He barked out another laugh, then quickly sobered. \u201cDid you ever do anything to hurt\u2014\u201d He pressed his lips together.</p><p>\u201cHurt who?\u201d</p><p>He cleared his throat. \u201cWhere\u2019s your sister?\u201d</p><p>Nice dodge. But as upset as he was, she allowed it. \u201cSleeping in her room.\u201d Nicola stood, held out her hand. \u201cI know what\u2019ll make you feel better. We\u2019ll go to the kitchen and I\u2019ll fix the most mediocre meal you\u2019ve ever had the pleasure of tasting, since my specialties are cereal and microwave dinners. Meanwhile, you can give me another lecture.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t lecture. I teach.\u201d He placed his hand in hers, his calloused palm causing goose bumps to rise. He paused for a moment, never allowing her to help him up. Then, he shook his head as if he\u2019d just made a decision and tugged her down.</p><p>Yelping, she tumbled into his lap and her ponytail slapped him in the face. She put her hands on his big, strong shoulders for balance\u2014and lost her breath as he meshed his lips into hers.</p><p>Oh, sweet mercy. Just like last time, her bones instantly melted. It didn\u2019t matter that he was too rough at first, then too soft; he branded her, claimed her, delighted her. And his taste, oh, his taste. It was decadence, pure and simple, like the summer and the winter, the spring and the fall, every season, every day, carrying her straight into eternity.</p><p>She wrapped her arms around him, holding him close. He groaned, and then...then, he figured out exactly how he wanted to kiss her, and the pressure evened out. He tilted his head, deepening the contact. Taking, giving. Demanding, beseeching. Owning.</p><p>It became more than a kiss, and on some level, it scared her. He was giving her something precious. And she was giving him something precious right back. But she didn\u2019t know what that thing was\u2014her trust? A piece of her heart?\u2014and wasn\u2019t sure she wanted to know.</p><p>What would happen if she fell for him? If she gave him everything?</p><p>Would he welcome her softer feelings? Or run from them?</p><p>Whatever the answers, they scared her, too. All she knew was that every point of contact reminded her that she\u2019d never experienced anything like this\u2014and probably never would again. How could she? He was the light in the darkness. The harbor in the storm. The hope she needed in the middle of the war.</p><p>There was no other man like him. He was one of a kind. And she wanted him to find as much pleasure with her as she was finding with him. She wanted to be what he needed.</p><p>To delight him, and not disappoint him.</p><p>His hands roamed the contours of her back...then lower. He caressed and he kneaded and...and...she was consumed, shaking, needy. Gasping, desperate. And he was...shaking, too, she realized, as affected as she was, his fingers rough, a little desperate, and the knowledge shattered her.</p><p>\u201cKoldo.\u201d Frantic, she tunneled her fingers under the collar of his robe. The fabric ripped away with a simple touch, granting her skin-to-skin contact, the sizzle of his flesh heating her up. And when his muscles jumped underneath her touch, as if seeking closer contact, the heat got worse\u2014and a thousand times better. He was so soft, so hard, so...exactly what she\u2019d always craved without ever knowing she craved it.</p><p>\u201cNicola,\u201d he gasped out.</p><p>\u201cMore,\u201d she demanded, the word escaping of its own volition. She continued to rip at his robe, finally baring the full breadth of his chest.</p><p>Sweet mercy. He. Was. Magnificent!</p><p>Bronzed and toned, stacked with muscle and sinew, chiseled by the hand of a master artist. His chest... That stomach rippled with iron bars... That perfectly dipped navel. A scar here, a scar there, but still, nothing about him was flawed. He\u2019d been honed on a battlefield, every mark a badge of strength.</p><p>She kissed his neck, and his head fell against the back of the couch, allowing her better access to him. She kissed his shoulder, his collarbone, reckless in her bid to show him just how deeply she accepted him, whatever he\u2019d done, whatever the future held. His grip tightened on her hips, and she lifted to once again fit their lips together. He moaned into her mouth, and took over, dominating her in the most amazing way. And she was...she was...</p><p>Struggling to breathe, she realized, trying to suck in a single gasp of oxygen but failing. Her mind fogged.</p><p>\u201cNicola?\u201d he demanded. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m...okay...will be...\u201d No, no, no. Not this. Not now. She would ruin the moment\u2014maybe even his feelings for her.</p><p>He tugged his robe together, the material somehow repairing itself. He cupped her face in his big hands. \u201cInhale slow and easy, all right? Now exhale just as slow, just as easy.\u201d His thumbs traced her cheeks, his skin so hot she could have been pressed against the sun. \u201cThat\u2019s the way. In. Out. Yes. Good girl.\u201d</p><p>A minute passed. Then two, three, before she finally regained her composure. And then she kind of wished she hadn\u2019t.</p><p>She had ruined the moment, she realized. Worse, she\u2019d revealed the depths of her weakness and proven just how worthless she was in the relationship department.</p><p>A strong man like Koldo had to despise people like her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m tired,\u201d she muttered. \u201cI should go to bed.\u201d</p><p>His gaze locked with hers, unwavering. \u201cYou\u2019re upset. Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust forget it, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t. Are you angry about something I did?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She couldn\u2019t let him think that.</p><p>\u201cThen what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust let this go. Please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t. Talk to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook, I\u2014\u201d Wanted to leave the room and his penetrating stare. Wanted to leave and hide and forget this had ever happened.</p><p>But she wouldn\u2019t be able to forget, would she? This was burned into her mind\u2014and every cell in her body.</p><p>\u201cKnock, knock, is home anyone?\u201d Laila asked, stumbling past the door and into the room, the scent of alcohol accompanying her. She giggled when she spotted them, wavered on her feet. \u201cUh-oh. Did I something interrupt? Wait. That came out wrong. I something interrupted.\u201d A nod. Another giggle. \u201cMuch better.\u201d</p><p>Nicola climbed off Koldo and stood, nearly toppling over herself. Stupid legs. \u201cI thought you were asleep,\u201d she said, happy for the reprieve. Only, she jolted backward.</p><p>The monkeys\u2014the demons\u2014were perched on Laila\u2019s shoulders.</p><p>\u201cKoldo,\u201d she whispered, and pointed. \u201cLook.\u201d</p><p>Laila spun in a full circle, nearly fell. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>Koldo pushed to his feet, the beads in his beard clanging together.</p><p>The monkeys squeaked out a protest and darted from the room.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll pretend I know what\u2019s going on,\u201d Laila said with a stern tone ruined by a goofy expression.</p><p>Why hadn\u2019t she seen the demons? Her eyes had been opened\u2014she should be able to see them now. Right?</p><p>\u201cI was in the kitchen and found this.\u201d Grinning, Laila raised a bottle of vodka.</p><p>Koldo stiffened. \u201cWhere did you find it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn the hands of one of your friends. And a good thing he brought it, because I almost died of a heart attack when I spotted him and needed a little something to calm me down.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cA friend? What friend?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe kind that will stab you in the chest just to hear you scream.\u201d</p><p>Nicola\u2019s gaze snagged on the chair Koldo had abandoned. There were two glowing palm prints on the cushions, with flecks of golden glitter the exact shade of his eyes. Prints that hadn\u2019t been there before. What...how...odd, she finished.</p> <p>Standing by her side, he reached out, settled two fingers under her chin and forced her to face him. \u201cStay here. And remember what I told you about the tattoos.\u201d With that, he stormed from the room, shutting the door behind him.</p><p>CHAPTER SEVENTEEN</p><p>KOLDO WOULD NEVER FORGET the exquisite feel of Nicola\u2019s lips against his or the softness of her body pressed against him, or the sweetness of her taste and a thousand other things that had set his blood on fire, causing him to ache, to reach the razor\u2019s edge of desperation.</p><p>The entire time he\u2019d had her in his arms, he\u2019d forgotten the horror of his earlier actions. His inner brokenness had been eased, and he\u2019d felt whole. Happy. At peace for the first time.</p><p>The future had seemed bright. Problems? What problems? There\u2019d been no anger, no dread, no sense of hopelessness. He\u2019d been...normal.</p> <p>But he\u2019d done something to upset her, no matter what she\u2019d claimed. First, she had melted. Then, after she\u2019d come out of her faint, she had stiffened, preparing to bolt.</p><p>Had she regretted what had happened?</p><p>Probably. He\u2019d mauled her, and she\u2019d been prepared to leave him. Had she succeeded, he would have chased her and...what? Demanded she still desire him?</p><p>He wouldn\u2019t be so pathetic. Would he?</p><p>Maybe her desertion was for the best. He wouldn\u2019t always have her, and so he couldn\u2019t allow himself to come to rely on her. He had himself, and only himself, and that\u2019s the way it had to be. That was safe. That\u2019s what he knew.</p><p>Stalking into the kitchen, he summoned the sword of fire. The flames crackled, light spilling in front of him. What he expected to find, he wasn\u2019t sure. Zacharel didn\u2019t know this place existed, nor did any other Sent Ones. His father didn\u2019t, either, but the male was out there, actively hunting him.</p> <p>To his astonishment, he found Axel sitting at his kitchen table, eating the food Koldo had bought for Nicola and her sister.</p><p>Anger ignited. \u201cHow did you find me?\u201d</p><p>With cheese dust on his chin, the warrior said, \u201cI can find anyone, anywhere, anytime. A little talent of mine.\u201d He lifted a bag of chips. The only source of junk food in the entire house. \u201cDo you have these in Tabasco?\u201d</p><p>The anger instantly subsided. If Axel could find anyone, he could find Koldo\u2019s father before Nox found Koldo.</p><p>The battle could be over before it ever began.</p><p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have come, and you shouldn\u2019t have brought alcohol.\u201d A single drink and Koldo\u2019s Nefas side would come rushing to the surface. His teeth would elongate. His nails would curl into claws. His temper would overtake him. Yeah. Alcohol is all that\u2019s needed for that. \u201cBut since you\u2019re here, I\u2019ll put you to work. Whatever your price, I need you to hunt down a...Nefas.\u201d He waited for a reaction. Most people shuddered at the mere mention of the race.</p><p>Axel ignored him, popping another chip in his mouth. \u201cYou should have a chat with the blonde about sharing her drinky drink with guests\u2014especially when said drinky drink belongs to the guest! It was way impolite to threaten to bash me in the head with the vodka bottle when I tried to steal it back. And by the way, did you know your hands are glowing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you\u2014\u201d Koldo\u2019s gaze locked on his palms. His glowing palms. The essentia had at last begun to seep from his pores.</p> <p>He\u2019d wanted Nicola that much, his body instinctively seeking to mark her as his exclusive property, even though she wanted someone else.</p><p>He should be ashamed, considering he\u2019d never bond with her.</p><p>But he wasn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cHow did you bypass my cloud?\u201d The warrior should have encountered a solid barrier.</p><p>\u201cIf I told you, blah, blah, blah.\u201d</p><p>He arched a brow. \u201cYou\u2019d have to kill me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be silly. I\u2019d only cut out your tongue to keep you from talking, and cut off your hands to keep you from writing or signing.\u201d Axel dusted his hands together and stood. \u201cI\u2019d love to help you with your little Nefas problem, but I\u2019m actually here because Zacharel called a meeting in the heavens. And what do you want with the Nefas, anyway? Those suckers are hard-core.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo are we.\u201d Was the meeting the one Zacharel had mentioned when Koldo had visited his cloud? When the warrior had been covered in blood and injuries? \u201cWhere does he want us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDeity\u2019s temple in the heavens.\u201d</p><p>Deity. Germanus. Koldo looked forward to seeing his mentor again. They hadn\u2019t spoken since Koldo had been told he belonged to Zacharel. And that was all Koldo\u2019s doing. He\u2019d been so irate to learn of his fate, he\u2019d kept his distance rather than yell. However, Germanus would have welcomed him at any time.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll meet you there,\u201d he said pointedly.</p><p>\u201cLike I really want to stick around and carry you again. Did I mention you weigh more than a building?\u201d Axel stood, flared his wings and leaped into the air, misting through the ceiling and disappearing.</p><p>Koldo stalked down the hall and into Nicola\u2019s room. Laila was jumping on the bed, singing off tune, losing her breath.</p><p>\u201c\u2014something, something, something, you love me. Yeah. Yeah. Something, something, together.\u201d</p><p>Nicola lounged on the couch, a blanket strewn across her legs. One of his books about heavenly battle strategies rested in her lap.</p><p>\u201cThere are nightclothes in the dresser,\u201d he said, and she glanced up. Meeting those stormy gray eyes was always a pleasure and a pain. They were always direct\u2014</p><p>Except this time.</p><p>She looked away. Her cheeks flushed.</p><p>He shifted uncomfortably and added the words Annabelle had told him would be necessary. \u201cThese garments were purchased for you and you alone. No other female has ever worn them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Nicola said stiffly.</p><p>That hadn\u2019t been the problem, then.</p><p>Laila continued to sing.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been called away,\u201d he explained.</p><p>\u201cHey, Cool-e-oh,\u201d Laila said, falling back on the mattress and bouncing. \u201cGuess what? I\u2019m going to have your house\u2019s baby. I just love it so much!\u201d</p><p>He...had no idea what to say to that.</p><p>\u201cWhen will you return?\u201d Nicola asked, toying with a loose thread on the blanket.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure, but I\u2019ll make sure someone is here to escort you to work if I can\u2019t return by morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo worries. I don\u2019t work at Estell\u00e4 over the weekend.\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s right. Tomorrow was Saturday.</p><p>\u201cBut we do have our double date,\u201d Laila said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s gonna be fun!\u201d</p><p>His hands fisted at his sides as he waited, hoping Nicola would speak up. But she remained silent, clearly still desiring to go, even after everything that had happened between them.</p><p>For the best, he reminded himself.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll make sure you get there, as promised,\u201d he gritted out.</p><p>And now, he should go. He knew he should go. Yet still he hesitated. \u201cI bought you a cell phone,\u201d he told Nicola. Annabelle had insisted. \u201cIt\u2019s in the top drawer of the nightstand. I bought one for myself, as well.\u201d It currently rested in a pocket in his robe.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your number?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cIt is already programmed into the device.\u201d And it was the only one in there. The only one he would allow her to put in there. \u201cCall me if you need me. For any reason.\u201d Or even if you don\u2019t have one.</p><p>She nodded, opened her mouth, closed it.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about anything. Stay calm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd sow joy,\u201d she said with a sigh. \u201cI know the drill.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t bother telling her to stay within the bounds of his property. The cloud would ensure that she did.</p><p>Without another word, Koldo flashed to the garden of Germanus\u2019s temple. As many times as he\u2019d been here throughout the centuries, he knew the area by heart. Two rivers flowed out of the alabaster columns in front and wound through the flowers, cascading over the sides of the cliff in the clouds to shower the stars. For the first time, however, the entire expanse was covered with Sent Ones. Hundreds of males and females surrounded him, the noise level utterly out of control.</p><p>Koldo flashed here, and he flashed there, searching for the soldiers belonging to Zacharel. He found them at the far left, in front of the alabaster steps and ivy-rich columns that led to the towering double doors of the temple.</p><p>Charlotte and Ronen winked and waved at him.</p><p>Elandra turned her back on him.</p><p>Malak was too busy staring at Bjorn to notice him.</p><p>Bjorn was too busy talking to Thane and Xerxes to notice Malak.</p><p>Jamila spotted him and frowned. She shoved her way over and said, \u201cThings are going down at Estell\u00e4. Sirena has it out for your girl. Hates her, in fact. The things she does and says when Nicola\u2019s back is turned...\u201d She shuddered.</p><p>The news surprised him. How could anyone find fault with such a gentle human? \u201cI\u2019ll deal with her.\u201d Whoever\u2014whatever\u2014she was. \u201cDo you know what Sirena is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Evil.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you aren\u2019t sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she grumbled.</p><p>Monday, when he flashed Nicola to work, he would find a way to question this Sirena. She wasn\u2019t Nefas, and she wasn\u2019t demon. But she was something. And if she hated Nicola, she could be working for his father.</p><p>At this point, Koldo had to suspect everyone.</p><p>Axel sidled up to his side and patted him on the shoulder. \u201cGlad you could leave Chesticles long enough to make an appearance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCall her that again, and I\u2019ll cut your heart from your chest and give it to her as a trophy.\u201d As he spoke, he spotted Malcolm and Magnus. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The two looked to be of Asian descent. Malcolm had dark hair dyed green at the ends, the strands sticking out in a single spike along the center of his head. He had eyes so pale they were almost white, and bones tattooed on his neck.</p><p>Magnus was as serious and clean-cut as any human businessman. Well, if \u201cany\u201d were six foot eight and three hundred pounds of muscle.</p><p>Axel waved the threat away. \u201cMay I recommend you peel my skin from my body, too?\u201d</p> <p>What could you say to a male like this?</p><p>His gaze landed on Thane. The warrior nodded a greeting.</p><p>Bjorn and Xerxes frowned as they looked up, up the steps at...Zacharel, who was walking onto the dais alongside the six other members of the Elite.</p><p>There were four males and three females, each representing one of Germanus\u2019s armies. Though they possessed the same wings of solid gold, that was their only similarity.</p><p>The blond and dark-eyed Lysander stepped forward, held up his hands, and the crowd instantly quieted. Expression serious, he said without any hint of emotion, \u201cIt pains me to be the bearer of bad news, but the time has come. You need to know the truth. You need to know that our king...our king is dead.\u201d</p> <p>KOLDO REELED. He wasn\u2019t sure how much time had passed since Lysander had made his pronouncement, he only knew that time had indeed passed. Shouts of denial and despair had resounded, and, emotions high, chaos had ensued. Fights had broken out, Sent One against maniacal Sent One. Tears had been shed and the future of their kind had been bemoaned. Eventually, things had calmed enough for the meeting to continue. To end. Then, one by one, the armies had flown away. All but Zacharel\u2019s.</p><p>Zacharel had commanded them to stay, and so they had stayed.</p><p>Koldo paced back and forth, his body moving of its own accord. His leader was...their king was...Germanus was...dead. Dead.</p><p>Gone.</p><p>He never should have allowed his anger to override his affection for the male and keep him away from the temple. And not just his anger, but regret. He\u2019d known Germanus would disapprove of his plans for his mother, and he hadn\u2019t wanted to give the male a chance to express his displeasure, to warn Koldo against his actions.</p><p>Now he would never again have the opportunity to sit with the Sent One who had fostered and nurtured him and soak in his many words of wisdom.</p> <p>After everything Koldo had endured in his childhood, Germanus had been the only one to give him hope for the future. And now his body was dust, his spirit in the heavens with the Most High.</p><p>When could this have possibly...happened? The answer slid into place before the question finished forming. The shaking of Nicola\u2019s office, he thought. At the time, he\u2019d guessed the shaking sprang from some kind of isolated earthquake. But no. A great and powerful being had died, and even the entire world had felt it.</p><p>But Koldo hadn\u2019t known, hadn\u2019t suspected. Had continued on, as if nothing was wrong.</p><p>Zacharel waved the soldiers closer. They stomped forward, and Koldo fought for calm.</p><p>\u201cWe had planned to tell the armies this news at the same time, but after such a strong reaction to our first order of business...well.\u201d Zacharel cleared his throat. \u201cI want you to know that the Most High didn\u2019t want us lost, even for a moment, and so He has placed a new king in charge of this realm. His name is Clerici, and in the coming months he will be summoning each of you individually to meet you and reassure you.\u201d</p><p>Clerici. Meaning, the clergy. Koldo had never met the male, but he had heard of him\u2014heard he was fair, just and driven to succeed.</p><p>But he wasn\u2019t Germanus.</p><p>\u201cZ just gets right down to business, doesn\u2019t he?\u201d Axel muttered in his ear. \u201cHe\u2019s a man with balls of brass.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re warriors, not babies,\u201d Koldo snapped. \u201cWe don\u2019t need any coddling.\u201d But oh, all he wanted was to return to Nicola, tug her into his lap and bury his face in her hair. He would sob like the baby he\u2019d just said he wasn\u2019t, mourn for the father figure he\u2019d turned his back on.</p><p>She would wrap her arms around him and tell him the pain of this loss would pass. And he would believe her.</p><p>\u201cSomeone\u2019s on their period, isn\u2019t he?\u201d Axel said.</p><p>A growl rose from deep in his chest. \u201cDo you not regret the loss of Germanus?\u201d Was he not torn apart inside?</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know him. Not really.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you should regret that.\u201d</p><p>Zacharel continued to talk, but not about what Koldo most wanted to know. \u201cHow was he killed?\u201d he finally interjected, able to stand it no longer.</p><p>Zacharel frowned. \u201cThat was explained during the\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cExplain again!\u201d A call from the depths of his bleeding soul.</p><p>At any other time, Zacharel would have struck him down, he was sure. Instead his jade-green eyes radiated sympathy. \u201cLucifer decided to make another power play for mankind and sent six of his best soldiers to kill our king. They didn\u2019t kill him right away, but absconded with him and tempted him to evil before delivering the deathblow. These demons are the worst of the worst, and they aren\u2019t through with their plan for destruction.\u201d</p><p>Demons.</p><p>Fury burned his chest. Fury and sorrow. Guilt and remorse.</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you summon us sooner?\u201d Thane growled, his own restraint bursting. \u201cWe could have hunted the attackers. Killed them before they delivered the final blow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd we would have liked it,\u201d Bjorn snarled.</p><p>Zacharel\u2019s expression was grim. \u201cYou know as well as I that the only way the demons were able to reach Germanus was because he allowed it. For whatever reason, he allowed it. There was nothing you could do that we weren\u2019t already doing. But we shall employ your skills now, for the demons are on earth and in hiding. We have reason to believe they\u2019re planning to build armies of possessed humans, making it impossible for us to fight effectively.\u201d</p><p>Because the humans weren\u2019t to be harmed. Because the humans couldn\u2019t be possessed unwillingly. They had to fall to the toxin or welcome the demons with open arms.</p><p>\u201cThey must be found,\u201d Zacharel continued, \u201cand they must be stopped before their evil spreads like the disease it is. And you, my soldiers, are the ones charged with this task.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER EIGHTEEN</p><p>ZACHAREL DISMISSED EVERYONE except Koldo and Axel.</p><p>Thane, Bjorn and Xerxes flew up and darted west. The females stepped from the cloud and arrowed down, toward the earth. Each person wore a similar expression: a blend of shock and horror, fury and determination.</p><p>Koldo wanted to curse. There was only one reason to keep him here\u2014an assignment that would prevent him from hunting the demons responsible for Germanus\u2019s death.</p><p>\u201cA horde of Nefas and serp demons did some damage to a park in Wichita, Kansas.\u201d Zacharel rattled off the coordinates. \u201cClerici has asked that I send the two of you to clean the mess and find the culprits, since you each have a personal stake in this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause we fought the serp scum a few days ago,\u201d Axel said, a statement rather than a question.</p><p>Zacharel\u2019s piercing green gaze locked on Koldo. \u201cThat\u2019s one of the reasons, yes.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t know. He couldn\u2019t know. Not even Germanus had known about Koldo\u2019s origins. Zacharel had to be referring to the fact that Nicola was involved. \u201cI\u2019ll take care of this. Alone.\u201d His father\u2019s people had done the damage, and so Koldo would be the one to fight the battle\u2014and finally wipe out the entire clan. \u201cAnd then I\u2019ll hunt the demons responsible for this travesty.\u201d</p><p>Zacharel arched a brow, amused rather than irritated. \u201cActually, you\u2019ll do it together. I\u2019ve decided to make your partnership permanent. And no, you won\u2019t be hunting the demons responsible for the king\u2019s demise. You\u2019re too busy guarding the human.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can do both.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you won\u2019t. You singled her out, and I allowed you to bring her into our world because I wanted to see you happy. I know how drastically love can change your\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t love her,\u201d he said in a rush. He couldn\u2019t.</p><p>Zacharel patted him on the shoulder. \u201cYou agreed to look after her, and you cannot do that if you\u2019re never with her.\u201d</p><p>Bottom line: he had to choose between helping Nicola and avenging his dearest friend. \u201cIf your men haven\u2019t found the demons by the time Nicola is healed and able to defend herself, I\u2019ll take over the hunt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake over? No. One day, however, I might allow you to join the hunt. One thing you need to learn, Koldo,\u201d Zacharel said tightly. \u201cYou can\u2019t do everything on your own. Sometimes you have to accept help. It\u2019s a lesson I had to learn, as well.\u201d With that, the Sent One flared his golden wings and shot straight into the night.</p><p>\u201cShould we get rings to seal this deal, life partner?\u201d Axel asked, stroking his chin.</p><p>\u201cOne day I\u2019ll probably remove your head,\u201d Koldo replied, and flashed to the park in Wichita.</p><p>The change in time zones brought him to a sun-drenched paradise. Humans strolled through the grass and along the cobbled walkway. Mothers pushed strollers, men walked their dogs. Trees stretched high, casting shadows. He knew this was where Nicola and Laila had spotted his father, but where was the mess Zacharel had mentioned?</p><p>He dug the phone out of his pocket and dialed Nicola\u2019s number. After three rings, she picked up.</p><p>\u201cHello?\u201d</p><p>The sound of her voice soothed the roughest edges of his emotions\u2014and the knowledge irritated him. \u201cWhere did you see the bald man?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d She described the area.</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d A pause. \u201cI\u2019ll be late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo worries.\u201d</p><p>He cleared his throat. \u201cAre you wearing the pajamas I got you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am. But, Koldo\u2014is everything okay? You sound upset.\u201d</p><p>Do you care? he wanted to ask.</p><p>Axel landed beside him, wings snapping into place at his back.</p><p>\u201cI must go,\u201d Koldo said, shifting from one booted foot to another. \u201cI\u2019ll speak to you soon.\u201d He closed the phone and stuffed it back in his pocket. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSo...no rings?\u201d Axel asked, as if their conversation had never lagged.</p><p>Koldo picked up where he\u2019d left off, as well. \u201cOne day might be today.\u201d He walked until he reached the location Nicola had described. There! Tracks. He pounded forward and crouched in front of a pair of footprints. The soles of the boots had been spiked with serp venom, leaving the grass singed. It was a pattern he knew well. His father or one of his men had stood in this very spot and\u2014</p><p>He sniffed. And infected the bark of the tree, as well. Frowning, Koldo studied the trunk. Several areas had been scraped and left jagged by sharpened claws. The sulfur-scented black smoke the Nefas projected covered the wood. There appeared to be hundreds of tiny bugs crawling from the damage.</p> <p>Already the tree bore signs of impending death. The leaves were withering. The grass around it had yellowed. Several dead birds lay in its shade. A nearby dog had attempted to mark the tree but was now hopping around next to its owner and whimpering, its paws probably burning.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the damage?\u201d Axel asked, stepping up beside him.</p><p>\u201cHave you ever been exposed to Nefas smoke?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, yeah. Who hasn\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>Almost everyone still breathing. But all right. Axel knew what to expect if he allowed himself to so much as brush against the stuff. \u201cCheck all the other trees. Any bearing the taint will have to be uprooted, the entire area cleansed.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo you plan to be the boss in our little partnership?\u201d Axel asked casually.</p><p>Koldo ignored the question. \u201cDo you have a cloud?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs this silly-question day? Of course I have a cloud.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSummon it.\u201d</p><p>Axel nodded, and a split second later, white mist enveloped them.</p><p>\u201cLet the humans see the park,\u201d Axel told the cloud, \u201cbut don\u2019t allow them to come near us.\u201d</p> <p>As the mist cleared, becoming translucent to the eye and somewhat solid to the touch, forming a bubble around them, Koldo jumped into the necessary work. The venom and smoke wouldn\u2019t kill him, but it would weaken him. Still, he wrapped his arms around the tree trunk and, using all of his strength, ripped the roots from the ground. He tossed the entire thing into an air pocket to be burned later. He also scooped up every grain of dirt bearing the sharp, telltale aroma of the smoke. He picked up every fallen leaf, even the dead birds.</p><p>\u201cThere were five others,\u201d Axel said, returning to his side.</p><p>They spent the next few hours on cleanup, Koldo leaving pieces of the cloud around each of the sites, preventing any humans from seeing what had been done. Tonight, when the people were tucked safely in their beds, Axel could remove the barrier. The humans would arrive tomorrow morning and assume what they would about this \u201ctravesty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you know about the Nefas?\u201d he asked Axel as they picked up the last of the infected leaves.</p><p>\u201cThey like to attack humans, Sent Ones, or anyone, for that matter, and they think rules, compassion and generosity are stupid. Oh, yeah, and they\u2019re as bad as demons.\u201d</p><p>Koldo nodded. \u201cThey\u2019re planners. They do little things at first, to see how their opponent will react, as well as to elicit as much fear as possible, since fear confuses, weakens and makes you do things you wouldn\u2019t normally do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour mother took your wings, but I\u2019ll take your heart and feed it to the dogs,\u201d his father said. The silver glint of a blade he held waved in the light. \u201cDo you want me to take your heart, boy?\u201d</p><p>Why not? You\u2019ve already broken it. \u201cI want you to die.\u201d He sat in the far corner of his cage, dirty and blood-caked from his many failed attempts to escape.</p> <p>A mocking laugh boomed. \u201cToo bad. I\u2019m here to stay. And I\u2019ve given you five days to do what I commanded you to do. Now, you have five seconds to do it. Kill the human or else. One.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomeday I\u2019ll make you suffer for this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThree.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomeday soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFive.\u201d Hinges squeaked as the door to a cage he could not flash in and out of was thrown open.</p><p>Koldo jumped to shaky feet, stalked over to the trembling human that had been shoved into the cell and struck.</p><p>In the present, he ground his fists into his eyes to disrupt the sickening crimson-soaked images behind them. If he could go back... He so wanted to go back.</p><p>You have to forgive yourself, Nicola had said.</p><p>He doubted she would have uttered those words if she\u2019d known even half of the things he\u2019d done. He should have died rather than cave to his father\u2019s demands. He should have\u2014</p><p>Concentrate. Distraction killed. Right. So. An old war had now been renewed. Strike one, Nox had appeared to Nicola. Strike two, the decimation of this park. The third would happen all too soon\u2014but it would be by Koldo\u2019s hand.</p><p>He would bet his father had left a man behind, someone to watch the area to report Koldo\u2019s every reaction. He gazed around, and sure enough, he spotted a tall male with a bald head and the dark eyes of a predator at the pretzel stand, buying a midday snack and peering at the right area.</p><p>Even though the contact with the smoke had left him a little shaky, Koldo stepped from the protection of the cloud, allowing the Nefas to spot him.</p><p>The male grinned a wide, toothy grin, his fangs gleaming bright white as he approached. The smoke wasn\u2019t seeping from his pores. The bodily function was something all Nefas could control; most days they simply opted not to.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re doing this, are we?\u201d Axel asked, sounding excited. \u201cWell, okay, then. Good thing I strapped on my big-boy panties today.\u201d</p><p>Anticipation buzzed through Koldo. He met his enemy in the middle, studied him anew. They\u2019d never met before. Either the male was younger than Koldo by several centuries, or his father had stolen him from another Nefas clan.</p><p>He munched on his treat, as if he hadn\u2019t a care in the world, assuming Koldo would do nothing in front of human witnesses. \u201cTook you long enough to gather your courage and show up,\u201d said the Nefas in a too-deep voice. \u201cI have a message for you, Koldo the Terrible.\u201d</p><p>Koldo had no desire to hear the rest. All Nefas could flash and he had to act quickly. In one fluid motion, he withdrew his double-edged short swords from the air pocket he used to store his weapons and struck, crossing his wrists to form a giant pair of scissors.</p><p>\u201cCloud,\u201d Axel said, as the man\u2019s head detached from his body.</p><p>The cloud was there in an instant, shielding the happenings as both pieces thudded to the ground and a pool of black blood formed.</p><p>\u201cWell, the pretzel\u2019s ruined,\u201d the warrior added conversationally. \u201cSo you weren\u2019t curious about his message?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I knew what he was going to say.\u201d A hello from Koldo\u2019s father, as well as a threat to Nicola, all in an attempt to draw out Koldo\u2019s apprehension.</p><p>\u201cMind sharing with the rest of the class?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFair enough, since I wasn\u2019t really interested. But I gotta say, I am so proud right now.\u201d Axel flattened his hand over his heart. \u201cYou borrowed my patented move, proving I\u2019m made of more than awesome. I\u2019m awesalicious. Is that a word? It\u2019s probably a girl word, but who cares! Seriously. Do you see a tear in my eye? Because I\u2019m pretty sure I feel one.\u201d</p><p>Koldo didn\u2019t understand the man\u2019s humor, and yet, he realized he was coming to like Axel despite that. He was strong, courageous and never backed down from a fight. He never allowed Koldo\u2019s moods to affect his own, and he was happy to do anything Koldo asked. Or demanded.</p><p>What was the male\u2019s history?</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re very weird,\u201d Koldo observed.</p><p>\u201cNah. I\u2019m mysterious. There\u2019s a big difference.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re definitely weird.\u201d</p><p>Koldo placed the body and the head in the air pocket with the trees and dirt, and searched for any other spiked footprints. He found none, but then, he hadn\u2019t expected to. Had only hoped his father would have left a trail behind, thinking to lead him into a trap.</p><p>A trap you knew about wasn\u2019t actually a trap\u2014but a weapon.</p><p>\u201cSo, where do you want to go from here?\u201d Axel asked.</p><p>\u201cI need to burn the air pocket and check on the females. Let\u2019s meet tomorrow night and go hunting for the Nefas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cColor me there.\u201d</p><p>MORNING ARRIVED, sunlight seeping through the crack in the curtains covering Nicola\u2019s bedroom window. She stretched muscles gone tight, and sat up. After she\u2019d tucked Laila into bed, she\u2019d reclaimed her spot on the couch and read. After a while, she\u2019d closed her eyes, thinking to recharge, and then...nothing until now.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t made it to the bed, but she was there now. She hadn\u2019t covered herself up, but she was wrapped in the comforter. There was no way Laila had carried her, so that could only mean Koldo had returned. He just hadn\u2019t woken her up.</p><p>Argh! He was too sweet for his own good. Now she couldn\u2019t avoid him forever and pretend the kiss had never happened. Now she had to face him and thank him for his kindness.</p><p>She grumbled as she lumbered out of bed, grumbled as she brushed her teeth and showered, being careful of her new tattoos, and even grumbled as she pulled on an adorable pink top and glittery jean shorts.</p><p>The moment she looked at herself in the mirror, the grumbling stopped. She had worn hand-me-downs most of her life. Her parents had shopped at thrift stores, and then, when she had been in charge of her own finances, so had she. Now...look at her. It was... It was...amazing.</p><p>A groan bubbled from her. Once again, Koldo was responsible for something wonderful in her life. And really, for a little while during the kiss, she\u2019d made him feel this same sense of awe. She\u2019d made him feel special. She knew it, would never forget the way he\u2019d trembled.</p><p>Maybe...maybe she wasn\u2019t such a bad choice for him, after all. Yes, she\u2019d passed out during their second intimate moment together. And yes, she could pass out next time, too. But cutting him from her life rather than facing the infirmity and the embarrassment that followed? How silly could she get? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She might be weak\u2014but she was stronger than that, she thought, anchoring her hair in a ponytail while the strands were still wet. It was her mother\u2019s hair, and she\u2019d almost cut it a thousand times. But every time she\u2019d grabbed the scissors, she\u2019d remembered the way her mother used to brush and braid it, the way her father used to call her Mini Kerry, after her mom, and the way her brother used to tug on the ends.</p><p>Her brother. Her beautiful Robby.</p><p>We\u2019re sorry, Miss Lane, but your brother was thrown\u2014</p> <p>Nope, not going there. Thinking about him opened wounds that had never really healed. So, she always removed him from her thoughts before they had time to form.</p><p>Raising her chin, she marched out of her room and decided to check on her sister first. But Laila\u2019s bedroom was empty, the bed unmade and clothes strewn across the floor.</p><p>She moved through the living room\u2014still no sign of her sister\u2014and into the kitchen. Nicola breathed a sigh of relief when she spotted Laila at the table, her head resting in her upraised palm. A cup of tea steamed in front of her.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t talk,\u201d her sister croaked. \u201cJust...don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHangover?\u201d</p> <p>Laila groaned. \u201cCo Co! Please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d she whispered. Nicola fixed a cup of tea for herself, and sipped at the hot, sweetened liquid.</p><p>\u201cYou should eat the fruit,\u201d a male voice said, and Laila issued another groan.</p><p>Nicola\u2019s heart sped into a faster beat as she twisted to face Koldo. He wore the same flowing white shirt and pants he\u2019d worn at the hospital. There were lines of tension branching from his eyes. A tension that matched what she\u2019d heard in his voice last night.</p><p>He paused to look her up and down, and his jaw dropped. He began a more leisurely perusal of her, his pupils expanding. \u201cYou...you...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d she asked hopefully. Are beautiful? Stunning? Worth trying to kiss again?</p> <p>\u201cAre wearing the clothing I picked for you.\u201d A croak.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d She waited. He said nothing more.</p><p>Seriously? That\u2019s all she got? The obvious? \u201cI\u2019ll eat if you eat,\u201d she grumbled.</p><p>He thought for a moment, nodded stiffly and sat at the table. Nicola eased into the chair beside him. There was a plate piled high with oranges, strawberries, bananas and melon. She selected a strawberry and bit into the center, the juice running down her throat and making her moan.</p><p>\u201cOh, that\u2019s good.\u201d Almost enough to make her forget Koldo\u2019s lack of appreciation for her makeover. Almost.</p><p>He reached out and swiped a droplet that had dribbled onto her chin. Her eyes widened as he brought the finger to his mouth, and tasted. \u201cIt is,\u201d he agreed, a husky note to his voice.</p><p>Her skin tingled where he\u2019d touched her, burning in the most delectable way. And when his gaze lowered to where his finger had been, a gleam of satisfaction glowed in his eyes.</p><p>Okay, so she finally forgot.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re in better spirits today,\u201d he said.</p><p>She liked that he was so attuned to her. \u201cI am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>Her unease with yesterday\u2019s kiss was private, something between them, not something to be shared even with her beloved twin. \u201cSo,\u201d she said, changing the subject. \u201cWho decorated your house?\u201d</p><p>There was a pause before he shrugged, and said, \u201cI did,\u201d surprising her. What, no pushing for an answer? No deep concern for what had bothered her?</p><p>You\u2019re a mess. \u201cJust so I\u2019m clear, you decorated every room?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, every room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut...there\u2019s so much pink in mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I can\u2019t like pink?\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widened. \u201cThe room is yours?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. But when I was younger and foolish, I hoped my moth\u2014\u201d He pressed his lips together. \u201cNever mind.\u201d</p><p>Hoped his...mother would stay with him? What had made him think such a hope was foolish?</p><p>\u201cSorry, guys, but I\u2019m in desperate need of a thousand profees.\u201d Laila stood, pushing back her chair. \u201cAnd maybe a total body massage, a nap, an hour-long shower and a TV marathon of How I Met Your Mother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProfees?\u201d Koldo asked.</p><p>\u201cIbuprofen,\u201d Nicola explained.</p><p>\u201cOnce they kick in, I plan to get ready for my date. By the way, I\u2019m sorry I busted into your room last night. It won\u2019t happen again. Probably.\u201d Laila shambled out of the kitchen.</p><p>Koldo held Nicola\u2019s gaze. \u201cWhy the change?\u201d he asked, pouncing the moment they were alone.</p><p>He\u2019d known why she\u2019d avoided the question. He\u2019d cared. Melting... \u201cI was embarrassed that I\u2019d passed out.\u201d</p><p>A breath gushed from him, and she thought she caught threads of relief. \u201cI never want you to be embarrassed with me, Nicola.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood, because I\u2019m over it,\u201d she said. Mostly.</p><p>\u201cSo, you didn\u2019t regret what we had done? Didn\u2019t think I was too rough?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot at all. You were amazing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why did you dress this way for your date?\u201d he asked softly. \u201cAs if you crave another man\u2019s desire.\u201d</p><p>She gulped, then answered honestly, \u201cI\u2014I didn\u2019t.\u201d I did it for you.</p><p>A pause. Then, in a strained voice, \u201cI don\u2019t want you to go. I...need you here. With me.\u201d</p><p>Nicola\u2019s stomach performed a series of flip-flops. The way he\u2019d said the word need\u2014he did care. And he\u2019d issued a request this time, rather than a demand. Her own relief was palpable, her elation hard to tamp down. But... \u201cI wish I could cancel. I really do.\u201d Just then, more than anything. \u201cBut you heard Laila. She\u2019s excited, and she won\u2019t go without me. And she\u2019s been so upset, and I\u2019ve been so worried about the toxin inside her. I need her calm, peaceful and joyous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can control your emotions, not hers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, but I have to try something.\u201d Please understand.</p><p>His hands were on the edge of the table, and his knuckles began to bleach of color. Finally, the side of the table snapped off, wood chips raining on the floor. Koldo jumped to his feet and stomped from the room.</p><p>Leaving her alone.</p><p>So heartbreakingly alone.</p><p>CHAPTER NINETEEN</p><p>THANE LANDED IN THE CENTER of Teaze, a salon and dance club on earth that catered to immortals. Eleven women of varying species bustled around the small building, each prettier and more scantily clad than the last. The only male on the premises was William of the Dark, aka the Ever Randy, aka the warrior who refused to reveal his origins, and he was currently sitting in a swivel chair with sheets of foil in his hair.</p><p>\u201cI know you\u2019re here,\u201d William said, sipping at a glass of what looked to be ambrosia-laced red wine.</p><p>Tensing, Thane stepped into the natural realm to fully reveal himself to the warrior. Immediately he smelled the sweet scent of the wine, the sharp odor of hair products, the pungent aroma of nail polish and the familiar fragrance of sex. Lots and lots of sex.</p><p>William must have bedded every single one of the stylists.</p><p>\u201cHow did you know?\u201d No one could sense him when he had no wish to be sensed.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s been saying that every two minutes for the last hour,\u201d said the girl stepping up to William to remove the foil.</p><p>Electric-blue eyes glittered as William handed his glass to a female strolling past him\u2014electric-blue eyes that reminded Thane of Axel. But then, there was a reason for that. \u201cDid you have to ruin it, Lakeysha?\u201d</p><p>The gorgeous black girl grinned widely. \u201cWell, yeah. You ruined me for other men, so I thought I\u2019d return the favor somehow.\u201d</p><p>Thane studied the building, halfway expecting their easy banter to be a trick, for an enemy to be waiting in the shadows, ready to attack him. He saw bricks and mortar, open indoor spaces with fifteen beauty chairs, or whatever they were called, and a row of round hair dryers and sinks. No menacing shadows. No swish of a weapon.</p><p>In the back was a big red door. If he were to walk through it, he knew he would enter the club, where there were small cages hanging from the ceiling, and poles stretching from individual tiers. A thump, thump of rock music shook the very foundation of the building.</p><p>\u201cI should be offended,\u201d William said, having noticed Thane\u2019s darting gaze. \u201cI\u2019ve done nothing to earn your distrust.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou live. You breathe. That\u2019s enough.\u201d</p><p>William had shacked up with the Lords of the Underworld\u2014immortal warriors fighting to free themselves from the dark urges of the demons that oppressed them. He had spent centuries locked inside the prison Tartarus, both for his philandering ways and his savage temper. He would kill anyone at any time for any reason.</p><p>Without a doubt, he wasn\u2019t the most trustworthy of males. But intel was intel, and Thane wanted to know what he knew.</p><p>Thane had asked some of his shadier connections at the Downfall what they knew about the six demons responsible for the travesty in the skies, and while he had learned several interesting things, he hadn\u2019t learned anything of value.</p><p>\u201cClearly I got your message,\u201d William said. \u201cYou wanted to meet, so here we are. What do you want?\u201d</p><p>Many things. They would start with information. \u201cYou are Lucifer\u2019s brother.\u201d</p><p>For a moment, the affable mask William sometimes wore fell away, revealing the vicious warrior at his core. \u201cHe\u2019s my adopted brother. Adopted. We\u2019re not blood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were both fostered by Hades, the keeper of Sheol.\u201d</p><p>A pop of his jaw. \u201cYeah. So?\u201d</p><p>So they both thought the same way. Surely. \u201cWhere are his minions? The six demons responsible for my king\u2019s death?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow should I know?\u201d</p><p>An evasion. One that wouldn\u2019t be tolerated. \u201cThe demons are now living among the humans. You are now living among humans. They are evil. You are evil. They came from hell. You spent many centuries in hell. You should know where they went.\u201d</p><p>Far from offended by the description, William puffed up. \u201cThey could be anywhere. Everywhere. You\u2019ll have to draw them out.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo I really need to do your job for you?\u201d William shrugged wide shoulders. \u201cFine. I will. There might be a whole pack of you guys on their tails, but that doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019ll find them. So, put a bounty on their heads. Even their mothers would turn them in\u2014if they had mothers, of course.\u201d</p><p>Every warrior instinct he possessed rebelled. \u201cAnd take the kill out of my own hands?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut the job will be done, so I don\u2019t really see the problem.\u201d</p><p>Of course William saw no problem. He thought only of the goal, not the collateral damage. \u201cThe job may be done\u2014but it may not. I wouldn\u2019t know for sure, since I had no part of it. And demons lie. They are never to be trusted.\u201d</p><p>The girl finished with the foil, and William waved her away.</p><p>\u201cIf I fail to destroy their forces,\u201d Thane added, \u201csomeone else will step into their role. Their plans must be stopped at the root.\u201d</p><p>William snickered like a teenage boy. \u201cYou said root.\u201d</p> <p>This is one of the many reasons I kill demons. This right here. No, William wasn\u2019t actually a demon. He\u2019d even fought and escaped hell, allowing light to shine in the darkness of his soul. But he\u2019d since begun to race down the road that led back into the darkness. So, he qualified.</p><p>\u201cLook. I have a feeling you\u2019ll be a little too busy shopping for bras to set a trap for the demons you want killed,\u201d William said. \u201cYou\u2019re a what? Forty-two C? Lakeysha over there will give you hers, I bet, freeing up your time and allowing you to do as I suggested.\u201d</p><p>Thane had to admire his courage. \u201cAs I said, demons lie. Demons cheat. I will never trust them to do the job for me. I or someone I trust will make the kill. What can you do to aid me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing.\u201d</p><p>Perhaps the warrior would reconsider. \u201cI know you have always desired to know who your real parents are.\u201d</p><p>William stilled, and for a moment, he appeared to stop breathing.</p> <p>\u201cI can help you with that,\u201d Thane said. \u201cAid for aid.\u201d</p><p>A sharp inhalation of breath, proving the action hadn\u2019t malfunctioned permanently. \u201cFine. I\u2019ll set a meeting with Maleah. You\u2019ve heard of her, I\u2019m guessing?\u201d</p><p>Maleah. Who hadn\u2019t heard of her?</p><p>Once a Sent One, she had been the most decorated soldier in their realm of the skies. She had been so decorated, in fact, that scheduling a meeting with her had been harder than scheduling a meeting with the king. Then, one day, she was gone, fallen, and no one had known why or what had happened.</p><p>\u201cSet the meeting,\u201d Thane said. \u201cAs for the information I owe, check with the Sent One named Axel. I think you\u2019ll discover something very interesting during your first conversation.\u201d</p><p>THANE, BJORN AND XERXES armed themselves for war.</p><p>The meeting with Maleah was scheduled to happen in half an hour. William had worked fast\u2014and the childish male would have snickered had he heard Thane\u2019s thoughts on the matter.</p><p>Thane had returned home with just enough time to bed a new female in an effort to clear his mind and ease the growing pressure to succeed. Afterward, he had alerted his boys. At least Kendra wouldn\u2019t be bothering him again. Yesterday, he\u2019d done the unthinkable.</p> <p>He\u2019d given her to her people.</p><p>The number of Phoenix had severely declined over the centuries, since very few of their women were able to conceive. That was why the males continually hunted the females. If one was ever found, she was immediately whisked to a Phoenix camp\u2014and kept there forevermore.</p><p>By now, Kendra had been wedded to a warrior. By now, she was once again a slave.</p><p>Thane should feel guilty.</p><p>He didn\u2019t feel guilty.</p><p>He probably never would.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve felt the tension in this realm of the heavens, as well as the earth, and knew it was a prelude to the coming war,\u201d Bjorn said. \u201cI knew an enemy was planning some kind of attack, but I assumed that enemy would spring from the Titans trying to overtake and rule the world.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTitans...demons...what\u2019s the difference?\u201d Xerxes said.</p><p>Not much. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be surprised to find out they\u2019re working together.\u201d</p><p>Thane finished snapping the metal on his arms, each etched with number after number to represent the Most High\u2019s promise for strength, then tugged on his gloves and smacked his friends on the shoulder. He preferred this armor over that formed by his robe. \u201cNo one comes to our territory and hurts our people. The demons wanted a war, and so we will give them a war.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo the king,\u201d Bjorn said.</p><p>\u201cHe hadn\u2019t yet finished his course,\u201d Xerxes said, \u201cbut he\u2019s now at peace, his spirit in the Most High\u2019s realm of the heavens. A far better place.\u201d</p><p>They shared a moment of silence, each remembering the good the king had done them over the years.</p><p>Together, they stalked out of their suite and to the roof of the club. Thane flared his wings. A darkened sky stretched all around him, stars glittering prettily.</p><p>\u201cAnd now we will finish our course.\u201d Thane dived into the night, heading down, down, down, and angling west. Air whipped against his skin, tangled his hair, becoming warmer the closer he got to the ground, even when the snowcapped Sierra Nevada came into view. There was a wealth of pine trees, and a lake as clear as crystal. Human ski huts. Humans trudging through the snow.</p><p>And there was Maleah\u2019s place. A cabin comprised of stone and ice, hidden in a cliff. Sent Ones liked to dwell in the elements, and the fallen female must have clung to the habit.</p><p>Thane misted through the walls and found himself inside a room lacking any sort of comfort. There were computers, TV screens, radios and all kinds of other equipment, but no couches, cushions or blankets. No photos.</p><p>A female he\u2019d heard about but never seen manned everything with a sharp eye and a constant tapping on a keyboard. She looked like a Goth princess, with her white skin, long white hair, multiple tattoos and piercings. A thick sweep of bangs hid her forehead and framed her big blue eyes.</p><p>Bjorn and Xerxes landed beside him.</p><p>\u201cPretty,\u201d Bjorn said, looking her over. \u201cI hadn\u2019t heard that fact.\u201d</p><p>If she cooperated, perhaps he would take her to the Downfall for a few days of fun. If not...</p><p>He couldn\u2019t kill her. That would be against the rules. But he could do other unpleasant things.</p><p>\u201cI expected you sooner,\u201d she said suddenly. Her chair swiveled around, and she pinged Thane with an unwavering stare.</p><p>She shouldn\u2019t have been able to sense him. Just then, she was human.</p><p>And pretty failed to do her justice, he realized. Her features were bold, sensual. She had a thick fan of white lashes, and heavy-lidded eyes. A strong nose, with a piercing curling from both nostrils. Well-defined cheekbones. Lush lips, with two barbells beneath the lower. A stubborn chin.</p><p>He stepped into the natural realm. \u201cImpossible,\u201d he said. \u201cYou knew exactly when I would come.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI knew when you were scheduled to come. I thought you\u2019d be in a bit more of a hurry.\u201d Her gaze swept over him, taking him in. Whether or not she liked what she saw, he couldn\u2019t be sure. Her hardened expression never changed. \u201cWilliam said you were a cocky one.\u201d</p><p>She hadn\u2019t heard of him while she\u2019d lived in the skies. He was somewhat offended. \u201cAre you his lover?\u201d</p><p>She chuckled with genuine amusement\u2014but she never confirmed or denied.</p><p>Bjorn and Xerxes joined him in the natural, and she gave the warriors the same once-over. Again, her expression remained blank, unreadable.</p><p>\u201cArmed for war, I see,\u201d she said. \u201cAgainst me?\u201d There was no fear in her tone. Only acceptance.</p><p>\u201cWhy did you fall?\u201d Thane asked.</p><p>Another chuckle bubbled from her. \u201cYeah. Watch me as I don\u2019t talk about that.\u201d</p><p>Very well. He would find out later. \u201cWhat do you know of the six demons\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow hiding here on earth?\u201d she asked, one brow arched.</p><p>He stepped toward her, hands fisting. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll show you.\u201d She turned back to her monitors, began typing. \u201cNew York is a high crime area, right, but it ebbs and flows, and there\u2019s very rarely a huge and sudden spike. Things usually build. Well, last night there was a spike unlike any I\u2019ve before seen. Murders, rapes, thefts, beatings, but most happened in the privacy of human homes and have gone unreported. And it wasn\u2019t just in a select area, but widespread.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat proves nothing,\u201d he said.</p><p>She snorted. \u201cAs you know, the mere presence of a demon causes the very atmosphere and energy of a place to change.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue, but that doesn\u2019t mean the spike was caused by demons.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhoever killed your king would now be weak. Germanus would have fought, and fought hard. The demons would have known you guys would soon be on their heels, and so they would have wanted to rebuild their strength quickly. As they fed on evil, they would have sent their minions to do the most damage possible.\u201d</p><p>Stunning and smart. Yes, he wanted her. \u201cSo they have spread out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDefinitely.\u201d She pointed to a map of the world on a separate screen, tapping her finger against the reddened areas. \u201cEach of these places had a similar spike.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are twelve places,\u201d Xerxes said, \u201cyet only six demons.\u201d</p><p>She rolled her eyes, saying, \u201cYou know as well as I that we aren\u2019t unwise to the schemes of the enemy. They would have known we could track them this way, and they would have wanted a way to circumvent that. Hence the minions I mentioned.\u201d</p><p>We, she\u2019d said, as if she were still part of an army. \u201cYou think they\u2019re commanding their forces to attack other areas, away from them, to divide our efforts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly.\u201d</p><p>He, Bjorn and Xerxes shared a look. She was probably right\u2014and they should have figured that out on their own.</p><p>So where do we start? Xerxes asked, his voice whispering through Thane\u2019s mind. They could communicate with every member of Zacharel\u2019s army this way\u2014if they so chose\u2014but they preferred to speak only with each other. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I don\u2019t think it matters, Bjorn said. No matter where we go, we\u2019ll be destroying part of a demon army.</p><p>True. But the six leaders will be concentrating their efforts on gaining control of the humans. The more humans they recruit, the less we can do to fight back.</p><p>So again, where do you want to start? Xerxes asked.</p> <p>\u201cHasn\u2019t anyone ever told you that it\u2019s rude to mind-talk in front of a girl?\u201d Maleah muttered.</p><p>Thane ignored her. He thought for a moment. We\u2019ll split up, each take an area. If one of the six is discovered, the finder will alert the others and we\u2019ll go in together.</p><p>Bjorn nodded.</p><p>Xerxes stiffened. Very well.</p><p>Since their rescue from that demon dungeon, they had spent no more than a single night apart. They had always had each other\u2019s backs. But to stay together now was to slow their search, and they owed the former king more than that.</p> <p>I\u2019ll take New York, Bjorn said.</p><p>I\u2019ll take the Highlands, Xerxes said.</p><p>Las Vegas was the second-biggest red dot, but...</p><p>I\u2019ll take Auckland. I have a house there. Thane protected what was his.</p><p>He clasped Bjorn\u2019s hand and pulled him in for something the humans called a chest bump. Then, Bjorn flared his wings and was off. He did the same with Xerxes, and he, too, darted away.</p><p>\u201cThank you so much, Maleah,\u201d the girl muttered with a shake of her head. \u201cYou helped us tremendously, Maleah, and we couldn\u2019t have done this without you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat has yet to be proven,\u201d Thane told her.</p><p>She tossed him a scowl. \u201cYou better learn some manners before you approach me again. Otherwise, I won\u2019t give you any new information.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA promise?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA threat.\u201d</p><p>He fought a grin. He had yet to meet a female who could resist him for long. And that wasn\u2019t pride talking, but truth. Too many ladies had a weakness for a pretty face, and he had a face prettier than most. He would have been saddened by the fact that so few cared to look beyond the surface at the man inside if he\u2019d ever actually wanted a female to see the man inside.</p><p>\u201cWhy do you do this, anyway?\u201d he asked Maleah. \u201cYou cannot buy your way back.\u201d No one could. Some Sent Ones had returned to the heavens after falling, but actions had had nothing to do with it. They\u2019d had to approach the Most High and ask.</p><p>\u201cI know I can\u2019t,\u201d she said softly.</p><p>\u201cThen why do you do this?\u201d he asked again.</p> <p>She didn\u2019t face him, but he could see that her smile was sad. \u201cYou\u2019re probably intimately acquainted with my answer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd that is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRegret.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER TWENTY</p><p>NICOLA WANTED TO BE anywhere other than a fancy steak house with two men she barely knew. But she was determined to have a good time for her sister\u2019s sake. And so far, everyone at the table believed she was.</p><p>\u201c\u2014and so, about two years in, I realized she\u2019d been cheating on me with my brother for most of our relationship. And you know what? That wasn\u2019t even the worst thing she did!\u201d Blaine, Laila\u2019s date, told another story about the woman who\u2019d broken his heart, ruined his life and left him tangled in all kinds of emotional wreckage, only stopping long enough to gulp the rest of his fifth beer.</p><p>Laila placed her hand over her heart, her eyes watery as she listened raptly and tried to offer comfort.</p><p>Dex rubbed the back of his neck.</p><p>Nicola forced a smile and shifted in her seat. She\u2019d ditched the comfortable, pretty clothes Koldo had given her in favor of the black dress she\u2019d worn to the triple funeral for her mom, her dad and her brother. It had seemed like a good idea when she\u2019d pulled it out of the closet. After all, it was probably better to look outdated than to wear what one man had bought her while spending the evening with another. But she\u2019d put on a little weight, and the material was constricting, making it difficult to breathe.</p><p>Koldo had taken one look at her and scowled. \u201cThat\u2019s how you want the human to see you?\u201d</p><p>How could she have responded to that?</p><p>After that, he\u2019d lectured her about safety, ending with, \u201cDo you have your phone? You had better have your phone. Call me if he does anything you don\u2019t like. Or if he doesn\u2019t like something you do. And don\u2019t forget you have the tattoos on your arm. And don\u2019t forget you can call upon the Most High.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t. Daddy.\u201d</p><p>His scowl had darkened before he\u2019d flashed her and Laila to her house. Then, he\u2019d commanded her to stand still while he ran his burning-hot hands all over her face, her arms, even her legs\u2014smearing every inch of exposed skin with some kind of glittery lotion. Then, without an explanation, he\u2019d vanished. She hadn\u2019t seen him since. But at least he hadn\u2019t taken his warmth with him. For the first time in her life, she wasn\u2019t wearing a sweater, wasn\u2019t pressed up against the living furnace known as Koldo, yet her body temperature was properly regulated. She wasn\u2019t shivering.</p><p>Dex and Blaine had arrived soon after that, and here they were, at Kodiak. They sat at a small table illuminated by candlelight, the thrum of a harp playing softly in the background.</p><p>Laila looked gorgeous in a red satin sheath dress Koldo had purchased, with her pale hair tumbling down her shoulders. Blaine wore a dark suit and tie, both of which were askew. Dex also wore a dark suit and tie, the perfect complement to his lean build. He\u2019d been nothing but solicitous, eager to please, and had hung on her every word. Every woman needed to date a man like him at least once. But, despite all that...she still wanted Koldo. Only Koldo.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d Dex said, tracing her knuckles to pull her into a private conversation probably meant to tune out Blaine.</p><p>There was no heat in their touch, no tingles. \u201cSo,\u201d she said.</p><p>He frowned, even paled, and drew back his hand. He looked down, studying his fingers in the light.</p><p>\u201cIs something wrong?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cNo. No. I just... I thought I felt a terrible... Uh, never mind.\u201d He forced a laugh. \u201cSo you got tattoos, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never would have guessed.\u201d</p><p>Her, either.</p><p>\u201cWhy numbers?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d she said, because she had no other believable response.</p><p>He shrugged, saying, \u201cFair enough. So did I tell you that I haven\u2019t been on a date in months?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut why?\u201d The moment the words left her mouth, she realized her mistake and blushed. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry. That was such a rude question. And I have no room to judge. I haven\u2019t been on a date in years.\u201d</p><p>He sipped at his wine, studying her over the rim of the glass. \u201cThat\u2019s impossible. Every man at the office is halfway in love with you. And if you had ever shown the slightest bit of interest, they would have been fully in love with you.\u201d</p><p>In love with her? There was just no way. \u201cWhy would they want...\u201d Another rude question, and one she wouldn\u2019t finish.</p><p>\u201cWhy would they want you?\u201d Dex asked, completing the sentence for her. He gave another laugh, this one relaxed. \u201cYou\u2019re so composed, so quiet, and you\u2019ve been so sad lately. It\u2019s become a compulsion to make you smile. You\u2019re more beautiful every time I look at you, yet you have no idea. And I could go on and on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she replied softly. If she didn\u2019t change the subject she would burst into flames. \u201cSo...have you spent any time with Jamila and Sirena?\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d been in the process of swallowing another sip of wine and choked. He coughed, beat at his chest.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine, fine,\u201d he wheezed. \u201cUh, what makes you ask about those two?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was just wondering how they seem to be doing to the rest of the office.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, uh, great I think. I...haven\u2019t really cared to find out about them.\u201d</p><p>The waiter arrived with the food, set the plates on the table, and Dex released a relieved breath. The sharp scent of the spices hit her, and her stomach twisted with hunger, a voracious appetite demanding attention. Just then, she wished she\u2019d ordered a juicy rib eye rather than a bowl of fettuccine.</p><p>\u201cTell me more about your recovery process,\u201d Laila said\u2014and Blaine did just that.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re sure getting along,\u201d Dex said, again reaching out to pat Nicola\u2019s hand.</p><p>The table never shook, and yet his wineglass suddenly tipped over, the dark red liquid quickly spilling over his jacket and pants. Yelping, he jumped up.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me,\u201d he gritted out before hurrying to the men\u2019s room.</p><p>\u201cYOU\u2019RE ACTING like a child,\u201d Axel said.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s funny, coming from you,\u201d Koldo replied through clenched teeth.</p><p>\u201cYou threw alcohol at a puny human male.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s lucky to still be alive. I could have thrown daggers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait. Did you think I was complaining? I was actually cheering.\u201d</p><p>They\u2019d stood beside the foursome\u2019s table for the past twenty minutes, watching the couples interact.</p><p>Koldo had arrived in a bad mood, and that mood had only grown worse. He\u2019d tracked his father, and it\u2019d been easy to do. Every flash left an imprint in the air that was vacated, and Nox had done a lot of flashing. But the trail had led to Nicola\u2019s house and grown cold, a fact that had enraged Koldo. A rage he wouldn\u2019t allow himself to express. He had a woman under his care now. No longer could he give his temper free rein. What if he scared Nicola? Or inadvertently hurt her?</p><p>Axel, who could find anyone, anywhere, had had no luck with the Nefas. So, they\u2019d given up for the time being and come here.</p><p>Koldo had nearly dialed her number a thousand times. He wanted to tell her how beautiful she looked\u2014so beautiful he hadn\u2019t wanted the other male to see her. He wanted to tell her that he was sorry for snapping at her.</p><p>He wanted to tell her that her date was a liar and a sex fiend.</p><p>Dex was the one Koldo had seen having sex with Sirena right on top of Nicola\u2019s desk, that time he\u2019d visited her office. And now the male was pretending not to know the girl. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>With every second that passed, one fact had become stunningly clear. Koldo should have gathered Nicola in his arms and staked a real claim. Another kiss. Only longer. Deeper.</p><p>She belongs to me.</p><p>And it was time he proved it.</p> <p>A moment passed. He nodded. Yes, it was indeed time he proved it. Poor Nicola.</p><p>He was half-Nefas. He was dangerous. He was disgusting. He was evil. Already his past had risen up to threaten her. He had no wings. He\u2019d never been with a woman, wasn\u2019t sure how to please her in that way and wasn\u2019t sure how he would feel afterward.</p><p>She\u2019d had so little joy in her too-short life. Everything she\u2019d ever loved had been stolen from her. If Koldo kept her, romantically speaking, she would be no better off. His time would be divided between her, his mother, his father and ultimately his duties. And what would happen to Nicola if ever he fell from the skies?</p><p>Still, that hadn\u2019t stopped him from spreading his essentia all over her little body today, marking her and warning all other males away.</p><p>Now there was a radiant, golden sheen to her skin.</p> <p>Koldo could see it, and he knew Axel could see it. But not Dex. And yet, the human had felt the heat of it when he\u2019d dared to reach out and touch what belonged to Koldo. An action that had nearly gotten him killed. Koldo had snarled and launched forward, determined to remove the human\u2019s head from his body\u2014and would have, if Axel hadn\u2019t tackled him to the ground.</p><p>She deserved better than Dex. Better than Koldo. But...she wasn\u2019t going to get it, and that was that. She was getting Koldo. All the other details could be worked out later.</p><p>Blood might stain his hands, but he would only ever treat her with tenderness. And she wasn\u2019t like Cornelia and Nox; he\u2019d already realized that. She would never treat him with hatred and cruelty.</p><p>She\u2019d made him laugh while he was at his worst. He loved having her in his arms. He loved having her in his lap. He loved talking to her, teaching her, listening to her wit and her observations, simply breathing her in. He loved tasting her, and now wanted all of her.</p><p>Why try to find another woman, an imitation, when he had the real thing already? Nicola was the most beautiful creature he\u2019d ever beheld, and he wanted...everything from her. He wanted to hold her. He wanted to see her with her hair flowing down her back. He wanted to hear more stories about her childhood. He wanted to avenge the wrongs done to her.</p><p>He just...wanted.</p> <p>And he would have those things\u2014and more.</p><p>One day you\u2019ll want a woman, Nox had said in one of his \u201cteaching\u201d moments. You\u2019ll do anything to have her.</p><p>At the time, he\u2019d scoffed. Now? He realized the truth of those words.</p><p>But once you have her, you\u2019ll be done with her. Your curiosity will be assuaged, the obsession will fade, and you can turn your eye to the next conquest.</p><p>Is that what happened with my mother? Koldo had asked. You wanted, you had, and you no longer desired.</p><p>Nox had belted out a deep, rumbling chuckle. Exactly. But oh, I did enjoy her in the meantime.</p><p>Maybe Koldo would lose interest in Nicola, too, but maybe he wouldn\u2019t. His father\u2019s word wasn\u2019t exactly trustworthy, though Koldo had seen evidence to support his claim. Thane, Bjorn and Xerxes certainly seemed to think females were disposable.</p><p>But that didn\u2019t matter. Koldo would fight the attraction no longer. He wouldn\u2019t worry about what could go wrong, what Nicola might want or what might happen in the future. He\u2019d told her not to fret about her illness or anything else, that it would only harm her, and now he was going to take his own advice.</p> <p>He just had to figure out how to proceed.</p><p>\u201cYou look like you\u2019re ready to have the redhead for dinner,\u201d Axel said, as though reading his thoughts. \u201cJust reveal yourself, flash her home and do your business. That way we can get back to tracking the Nefas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd if she fights me in public?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s only a 49 percent chance she\u2019ll actually win, so you should be safe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you not be serious?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen it comes to math, I\u2019m always serious. Just do something or leave,\u201d Axel said, buffing his nails. \u201cI\u2019m bored. Bad things happen when I\u2019m bored.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Nefas trail went cold,\u201d he reminded the warrior. \u201cAll we can do is ask around, and try to find their nest. And if that fails, all we can do is wait for their next attack. You have nothing better to do.\u201d</p><p>He looked at Nicola, who was now picking at her food, watching her sister. Before Dex had raced away, she\u2019d peered at the pasta with a hunger Koldo had wanted directed at him.</p><p>He looked at Laila, who had pushed her food away without taking a single bite and propped her elbows on the table. While Blaine shoveled in his pork chop and told her another story about his former lover, she dabbed at her watery eyes, sympathetic to his pain.</p><p>Dex came around the far corner, his jacket hanging over his arm. His plain white shirt bore a few splatters of red, and there was a damp spot on the left side of his pants. He was sullen as he reclaimed his seat.</p><p>\u201cWe can leave,\u201d Nicola offered.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s all right,\u201d Dex replied stiffly. \u201cMy vanity took a hard knock, that\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, maybe there\u2019s something I can do to help.\u201d Nibbling on her lower lip, Nicola grabbed her water glass, drew in a deep breath and poured half the contents into her lap.</p><p>Dex\u2019s jaw dropped as she gasped and grinned\u2014and Koldo hated that another male was seeing her so relaxed, so happy, and that she was striving so diligently to entertain, to please.</p><p>\u201cNow we both look like we peed our pants,\u201d she said.</p><p>A bark of laughter boomed from the male.</p><p>Laughter that should have been Koldo\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cOkay, I might have to fight you for her,\u201d Axel said. \u201cThat was seriously cool.\u201d</p><p>Koldo flashed to outside the restaurant, mentally commanded his robe to become a black shirt and black pants, and marched back inside, this time in the natural realm, where everyone could see him.</p><p>The hostesses spied him, and could only gape. Several groups were waiting for a table, and they gave him a wide berth. Gasps sounded. Murmurs arose. He didn\u2019t bother speaking to any of the humans, and marched straight to Nicola\u2019s table. Conversations ceased. He could imagine Axel laughing, but thankfully couldn\u2019t see or hear him.</p><p>Dex spotted him, and his fork paused midair. His eyes widened. \u201cYou!\u201d</p><p>Blaine caught sight of him and straightened in his seat with a snap.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2014\u201d Laila began, only to look up and groan. \u201cOh, no.\u201d</p><p>Nicola glanced up, and performed a double take. \u201cKoldo. What are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know him?\u201d Dex asked with a wheeze.</p><p>Koldo peered down at the table\u2019s occupants. He should have thought this through a little more, he realized. He had no idea what to say. \u201cNicola,\u201d he began.</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d She tossed her napkin on the table and stood. The bottom half of her dress was soaked, water droplets trickling down her bare legs.</p><p>He towered over her, and that should have dissuaded him. He could hurt her without ever realizing it, and could damage her badly enough to kill her. But their eyes met, and his blood heated, and he knew he couldn\u2019t go another night without having her in his arms.</p><p>\u201cYour sister has had her fun, yes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh, not really,\u201d Nicola said, looking at Laila\u2019s tear-streaked face. \u201cIf anything, she\u2019s sadder than ever. Sorry, Blaine, but it\u2019s true.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat can be fixed.\u201d To Axel, who he still couldn\u2019t see, he commanded, \u201cTake care of the sister. Make her happy.\u201d He took Nicola\u2019s hand and tugged her toward the exit.</p><p>\u201cKoldo,\u201d she gasped, though she offered no resistance. \u201cSeriously. What\u2019s going on? Has something happened?\u201d</p><p>In the background, he thought he heard someone ask if she wanted the police notified.</p><p>He tossed her a glance over his shoulder. \u201cYou\u2019re mine. And I\u2019m keeping you.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE</p><p>THE MOMENT THEY CLEARED the doors, the night air enveloping them, Koldo wrapped Nicola in his arms and peered down at her. The rest of the world faded from her awareness. He was all that she saw as her mind churned with possibilities and problems. He was keeping her? They were innocent words, yet his tone had been intense, as if he was making a life-altering vow in front of a judge.</p><p>Was he trying to say they were an official couple now?</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d she asked, really liking the thought. Except...</p><p>What if she wasn\u2019t enough for him? What if her heart never recovered, and she could never satisfy him physically?</p><p>Threads of yesterday\u2019s panic returned, weaving into new threads of fear, forming a noose around her neck and squeezing. Come on, girl. You hopped off this road already. Don\u2019t jump back on.</p><p>\u201cYour circumstances have changed,\u201d Koldo said.</p><p>\u201cI know, but...\u201d But? No buts!</p><p>A sizzling pause as he searched her face. \u201cBreathe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m trying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTry harder.\u201d</p><p>In. Out. Innn. Ouuut. There. Getting better, evening out. Whatever happened to her, they would get through it together. She knew that. Could count on that\u2014on him.</p><p>\u201cAre you frightened?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cNot of you,\u201d she replied truthfully.</p><p>\u201cOf you, then. But I can fix that.\u201d He looked at her with the same intensity she heard in his voice, and with such heat. \u201cClose your eyes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? Are you flashing me\u2014\u201d</p><p>He did. He flashed her. She blinked, and found herself standing in her bedroom in Panama. He released her...only to back her against the nearest wall.</p><p>Nicola gulped. \u201cLaila\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs being taken care of.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I have to apologize to Dex.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can. Tomorrow. You can mail him a card.\u201d He braced his hands at her temples, his heady scent wrapping around her as certainly as his arms had done. She breathed in deeply, her heartbeat careening out of control. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou can\u2019t be with another man,\u201d he growled. \u201cNot ever again. For any reason.\u201d</p><p>Despite the too-fast rhythm of her heart, the rest of the panic faded, both old and new. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be with another man,\u201d she admitted.</p><p>He nodded with conviction. \u201cYou belong with me. Only ever me.\u201d Again, he sounded as though he was making a vow.</p> <p>They had to be a couple.</p><p>\u201cDo you understand the kind of girl you\u2019re getting?\u201d She flattened her hands on his chest, the heat of him seeping through his shirt and brushing against her skin. \u201cI\u2019m just me, and I come with a few challenges.\u201d</p><p>He smiled, pleased. \u201cI know that. What I don\u2019t know is how to be in a relationship, but I\u2019m going to learn. Along the way, I\u2019m bound to make mistakes. You\u2019ll simply tell me when I mess up, and I\u2019ll fix it. Agreed?\u201d</p><p>Melting faster... \u201cAgreed.\u201d</p><p>He said no more. He simply pressed his lips into hers.</p> <p>It wasn\u2019t the brutal kiss she expected from so determined a man, or the sweet and tender kiss they\u2019d first shared. It was heat and electricity, need and want and obsession. Addiction and desire. A taking and a giving. An unwavering claim.</p><p>She moaned at the pleasure of it, and he lifted his head. He peered into her eyes, searching.</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t complaining,\u201d she said. \u201cPromise.\u201d</p><p>Back in he went, kissing...kissing so deeply, surrounding her with the fever-heat of his skin. She could hardly believe this was happening. It was surreal. It was wondrous. He belonged to her\u2014and there was no one here to stop him prematurely. They were alone.</p><p>Her heartbeat fluttered. Her limbs shook.</p><p>\u201cAll is well?\u201d he rasped.</p> <p>\u201cMmm-hmm.\u201d</p><p>He cupped her cheeks, his palms searing brands as he angled her however he desired. His pupils were blown, his lips red, swollen and moist. \u201cYou\u2019ll tell me if that changes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. But don\u2019t be surprised if I\u2019m embarrassed by it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you. I never want you embarrassed with me. What happens happens, and we\u2019ll deal with it. We\u2019re in this together.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d taken the words from her mind\u2014words of hope, now confirmed. I\u2019m more than melting. I\u2019m falling for him. Hard.</p><p>Back in he went, taking, giving. Her hands slid along his spine, her nails scraping over the fabric of his shirt.</p><p>\u201cUnder the clothing,\u201d he rasped. \u201cI want your skin on mine.\u201d</p><p>A low growl rumbled from him as she obeyed, reaching under the hem of his shirt. Her fingertips stroked over his hard-won strength, and she marveled all over again. He was velvet over iron, perfection over perfection, and he smelled so good, all that sunshine reminding her of summer. Summer reminded her of blooming flowers and blooming flowers reminded her of colors, so many colors, and life, such vibrant life.</p> <p>Life. Yes. That\u2019s what Koldo was. Around him, she was stronger, happier...freer. Like the flowers, she bloomed. He\u2019d become the peace she\u2019d never had.</p><p>\u201cMore,\u201d he said, and released her long enough to rip the garment over his head.</p><p>She reached for him. He grabbed her by the waist and lifted her off her feet. She wound her legs around his waist, and white lightning zinged through her veins.</p><p>\u201cDid I tell you that you\u2019re mine?\u201d he demanded.</p><p>A thrill stole through her. \u201cYou did. And you\u2019re mine.\u201d He was a gift, created with her every secret desire in mind, and she wanted so badly to be perfect for him. To be everything he needed. She had to remain aware, couldn\u2019t allow the infirmity to win. Not this time, and embarrassment had nothing to do with it. Only Koldo mattered.</p><p>His hands glided up, up, and kneaded her softly, then more tightly, wringing another moan out of her.</p><p>\u201cThis is good,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>\u201cBeyond.\u201d</p><p>Their breath mingled, short panting rasps. He kissed the corner of her mouth, along the side of her jaw, sometimes nibbling. Lower still, he licked at her neck, at her hammering pulse, her collarbone. Always he treated her as if he couldn\u2019t get enough of her, as if he wanted to taste every inch of her at once.</p><p>\u201cBut it\u2019s not enough,\u201d he said, coming back up to kiss her mouth.</p><p>She wrenched away with a moan. \u201cI thought you just said\u2014\u201d</p><p>He pulled the top of her dress down, revealing more and more skin to explore. The protest died as he pressed her against the wall. He hadn\u2019t been insulting her. He\u2019d been demanding more of her.</p><p>More she would happily give.</p><p>He slid his magnificent hands down...down, until finally reaching the bottom of her dress. He raised the hem higher and higher, until the material pooled around her waist. Cool air brushed against her, and sensation after carnal sensation shot through her.</p><p>He dragged his fingertips back down her thigh, eliciting one shiver after another. Then...he dragged those fingertips back up, leaving a trail of fire in his wake, and oh, this was...this was...so good, too good, too much after the stress of the evening, and...the fog formed in her head, just like before.</p><p>\u201cKoldo,\u201d she tried to say, but his name was nothing more than a breath. He kissed her again, stealing what little she had left, and all the while those decadent fingers continued to give her the softest of caresses, taking her body to heights it wasn\u2019t ready to reach.</p><p>Her world tilted, and darkness descended.</p><p>Time ceased to exist. Noise faded. Sensation left her....</p><p>Suddenly, something patted at her cheek. Something cold swiped over her brow.</p><p>Frowning, Nicola tugged herself from the darkness and blinked open her eyes. Koldo loomed over her, and she\u2014she was lying on the bed, her head resting on a plush, soft pillow. Her dress was in place, smoothed down her legs.</p><p>Oh, no. \u201cIt happened again, didn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. You passed out.\u201d His self-castigation was palpable. \u201cI carried you to bed.\u201d</p><p>Even though she\u2019d come to the realization that he would want her anyway, despite something like this, embarrassment still heated her cheeks, just as she\u2019d suspected. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry, Koldo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be. I pushed you for too much, too fast.\u201d His shirt once again covered his magnificent chest, and that was, perhaps, the greatest tragedy right now. \u201cNext time, I\u2019ll go slower.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNext time,\u201d she said, and wanted to purr with satisfaction.</p><p>He frowned. \u201cYou don\u2019t want a next time?\u201d</p><p>More than anything. \u201cWhat makes you think that I don\u2019t? Unless you don\u2019t want me to want a next time,\u201d she added in a rush. \u201cAre you trying to hint that you want to go back to being just friends?\u201d</p><p>He flattened his hand against her jawline, his thumb caressing her cheek. \u201cDid you hit your head? Of course I don\u2019t want to just be your friend. And you should know me well enough to know I\u2019ve never hinted at anything.\u201d</p><p>So true. She smiled at him. \u201cCould you be any sweeter?\u201d</p><p>His lips twitched at the corners. \u201cFirst, I don\u2019t care if you pass out every time we do this. You are worth any effort. Second, I make you happy. Therefore, I\u2019m aiding your healing.\u201d</p><p>Not just happy, she thought. Delirious.</p><p>\u201cDo you wish to remain just friends?\u201d he asked, and this time his tone was so sharp it could have cut her. His expression, however, was tortured. \u201cI\u2019m not a man willing to buy your affections, but perhaps I could do other things. Is there something you want that I haven\u2019t given you?\u201d</p><p>Her heart lurched. \u201cNo,\u201d she admitted. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be just friends. And you\u2019ve given me everything.\u201d He was the man she\u2019d thought about all evening. The man she\u2019d wanted to be with. The man she\u2019d craved.</p><p>He relaxed, nodded and moved his touch to her neck, where her pulse hammered wildly. \u201cI like the kisses we share.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like them, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like the taste of you, the feel of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want the toxin out of you.\u201d His tone was layered with determination. \u201cForever.\u201d</p><p>Her, too. More than ever. And they had to change the subject before she pushed for too much too fast. \u201cSay something to distract me. Please.\u201d</p><p>He peered at her for a long while before nodding, decided. Rolling to his side, he said, \u201cThe first time I saw you wasn\u2019t in the elevator.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. The day before I was sent to the hospital to help a human male, and I stumbled into your sister\u2019s room. The Most High showed me that she was in the condition she was in because she\u2019d entertained a demon of fear for so long, the demon was able to worm its way inside her body. He showed me because He wanted me to help her. Her, yes, but also you I think. You were in danger of succumbing the same way.\u201d</p><p>Nicola rested against him, finding comfort, companionship and acceptance, all wrapped into one tantalizing position, despite the topic. Or maybe because of it. Knowledge was power. \u201cI was entertaining a demon? I mean, I know I had the toxin, but I just thought... I don\u2019t know what I thought.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere were two of them hanging around you.\u201d</p><p>A gasp lodged in her throat. \u201cBut I never knew. Never saw them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I have my way, you never will.\u201d He draped his arm over her neck in a gentle choke hold\u2014gentle, but a choke hold nonetheless. He was as new to this kind of thing as she was, and she was suddenly fighting a smile.</p><p>\u201cTell me something about you,\u201d she said. \u201cSomething you\u2019ve never told anyone else.\u201d</p><p>A long pause. He gulped. \u201cWhen I was a child, I lived in constant fear. My mother hated me, and my father...abused me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Koldo. I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d Had his father caused the scars?</p><p>\u201cI never knew what horrors I would have to face next, only that I would, in fact, have to face them.\u201d</p><p>No wonder he was so fierce, so standoffish\u2014so vulnerable and unsure. He had built a shell around himself, desperate to protect a fragile heart that had been trampled by the people who should have loved him most. People who instead had rejected him with their abuse. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She traced her fingers along the ridges of his stomach, wishing the shirt would disappear, then chiding herself for wishing.</p><p>\u201cAsk me a question,\u201d he said. \u201cAny question. I like sharing with you.\u201d</p><p>She thought for a moment. \u201cWhy were you so upset when we spoke on the phone after yesterday\u2019s meeting?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI had just found out a man I loved was killed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Koldo,\u201d she repeated. He had endured one blow after another, and the knowledge saddened her.</p><p>He took her hand, brought her knuckles to his lips and kissed. He next rubbed her hand over his cheeks, his jaw, his beard tickling her skin, before once again kissing her knuckles. \u201cIt\u2019s a punishment I deserved.\u201d The same guilt and shame she sometimes saw in his eyes now dripped from his tone.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to say something, and I don\u2019t want you to be offended, all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d he said reluctantly.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s the most ridiculous thing I\u2019ve ever heard! You did not deserve to lose a friend.\u201d</p><p>He relaxed the tiniest bit. \u201cI haven\u2019t always been the man you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I haven\u2019t always been the girl you know.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cYou\u2019ve always been sweet, kind and caring, and that\u2019s that.\u201d</p><p>No. He didn\u2019t know the full truth\u2014that she and Laila had once planned to murder the man responsible for the deaths of their parents and brother. And she would be forever grateful the plan had failed. A moment of rage would have changed the entire course of their lives, and not for the better.</p><p>But all she said to Koldo was, \u201cYou\u2019re making a mistake,\u201d and kissed his chest. There was no reason to spoil the moment. \u201cAnd notice how wonderful I am, pointing it out just like you asked.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWonderful. Yes.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019d been no sarcasm in his voice. Darling man. \u201cSay-la,\u201d she interjected, recalling the way he\u2019d once used the word with her.</p><p>He fell silent.</p><p>She traced an X over the heavy beat of his heart. \u201cWhat does the word mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo pause and think about what was said.\u201d</p><p>Well, well. From now on, she might be using the word after everything she said. \u201cSo now that we\u2019ve bared our souls, and I\u2019ve blown your mind with my intelligence, what do you want to do for the rest of our date?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRest. For what I have planned tomorrow, you\u2019re going to need it.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER TWENTY-TWO</p> <p>FOR THE FIRST TIME in his entire life, Koldo spent the night in bed with a woman. His woman. Something he\u2019d wanted. Only, what he\u2019d truly wanted was to strip Nicola, strip himself, kiss her, have her, have her again\u2014and maybe again\u2014and fall into a deep sleep. Then wake up and have her again. Physically, however, she wasn\u2019t ready for that.</p><p>Maybe he wasn\u2019t, either.</p><p>Next time, he needed to slow down, get them both ready. He\u2019d loved the sensations coursing through him so much he\u2019d verged on losing control. If that had happened, he could have taken her too forcefully. Hurt her the way he\u2019d always feared.</p><p>A sobering thought.</p><p>A horrifying thought.</p><p>What a man feared came upon him. He knew that. So it was time to stop giving in and start fighting these worries the moment they came. To practice what he taught.</p><p>As they\u2019d talked, and she\u2019d snuggled into his side, he expected the rest of his arousal to fade. But it hadn\u2019t.</p><p>It had only gotten worse.</p><p>As she slept, her warm breath fanned over his neck in a decadent caress. Her heart beat in sync with his, connecting them in the subtlest of ways. Their scents blended, male musk with feminine sweetness, and all he\u2019d wanted to do was pick up where they\u2019d left off.</p><p>Can\u2019t. Won\u2019t.</p><p>Everything had to be perfect for her. He never wanted her to look back and wish or regret. He would rather die. He wouldn\u2019t be another tragedy in her life. He would be something else.</p><p>I have to be something special.</p><p>All of his strength was needed to remain still, ignoring the achiness of his body.</p><p>By the time the sun rose, he was trembling\u2014and sweating and panting and far more desperate. He untangled from Nicola, and even though she was the source of his torment, he hated leaving her. She muttered a soft sigh and rolled to her stomach, strawberry hair still in a ponytail and spilling all over the pillows.</p><p>Can\u2019t dive on her. Really can\u2019t. He didn\u2019t bother with a shower before he flashed to a nearby lumberyard and gathered what he would need to build a second, smaller home in the backyard of the ranch. His clothing cleaning him inside and out.</p><p>Next, he got to work. He\u2019d decided to move his mother to Panama.</p><p>She was a part of his life. A part he no longer wanted to hide from Nicola. Last night, telling her about his past, he\u2019d discovered a peace unlike any other. He\u2019d liked it. Now, he wanted her to know everything. He wanted to be completely honest with her. He wouldn\u2019t just tell her, though. He would show her.</p><p>One hour sped into another as he worked that morning, sawing and hammering. Eventually he removed his shirt. Sweat rolled down his chest and back, and the sun beat against his skin. His muscles welcomed the strain.</p><p>\u201cWould you like something to drink?\u201d Nicola called from the kitchen doorway. \u201cI made lemonade.\u201d</p><p>He glanced up\u2014and wished he hadn\u2019t. The arousal returned full force, as if he\u2019d never moved away from her. She\u2019d taken a shower and pulled her damp hair into another ponytail. Those storm eyes were bright, her cheeks rosy. Her lips were still plumped from his kisses. She wore a tight white T-shirt and jeans with rhinestones around the waist. So young. So fresh.</p><p>So his.</p><p>\u201cNo, thank you,\u201d he replied. If she came out here, he would grab her and never let go.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d She held up a glass filled to the rim. \u201cYou look really, really hot. And I mean that in every way.\u201d</p><p>He paused, the hammer raised midair.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing out there, anyway?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cBuilding a cage.\u201d</p><p>He expected her to throw another question at him.</p><p>She didn\u2019t. She said, \u201cI bet you\u2019re working up quite a thirst.\u201d</p><p>I am. For you. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll bet I do....\u201d</p><p>Oh, no, you don\u2019t. \u201cAre you flirting with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am.\u201d</p><p>Confirmation. Killing him. \u201cGo back inside, Nicola. Now.\u201d</p><p>A dreamy sigh left her. \u201cSo commanding. I never thought I\u2019d have a snarly handyman fantasy, especially after I got mad at you for snarling just the other day.\u201d</p><p>He almost ditched the tools and stomped after her. Almost.</p><p>She walked away. A few seconds later, Axel strolled out the door, his dark hair disheveled, his blue eyes glittering as he drank the lemonade that had been meant for Koldo. His wings were tucked into his back, and he wore the customary angel robe, the white gleaming in the sunlight.</p><p>\u201cHey, you know anything about an immortal named William of the Dark? He also goes by the alias Ever Randy. Because all of a sudden, for no reason, he\u2019s decided to track me down,\u201d Axel said between sips. \u201cIt\u2019s really getting to be annoying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d The moment the warrior reached Koldo\u2019s side, Koldo snatched the glass and drained the contents. \u201cMine,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cSo not cool. Someone needs to learn the meaning of hospitality. And sharing. And kindness. And brotherhood. And friendship. And selflessness.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be sure to look the words up later.\u201d Koldo handed him the empty glass. \u201cThank you for taking care of Laila last night.\u201d</p><p>Axel tossed the glass into the bushes behind him. \u201cDude, that girl\u2019s got problems.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI probably shouldn\u2019t have slept with her.\u201d</p><p>Koldo was in the process of hammering another nail and on his next downward swing, hit so hard the end of the board snapped. Surely he hadn\u2019t just heard what he thought he\u2019d heard. \u201cYou slept with her?\u201d</p><p>Blink, blink. \u201cWhat? I\u2019m not a he-slut or anything. She was only my third lay of the day. And you told me to make her happy, right?\u201d</p><p>Three. Three women. In one day? Koldo wanted Nicola and only Nicola, and couldn\u2019t imagine sharing his bed with anyone else. Yes, he\u2019d entertained the idea of returning to Thane\u2019s club and taking the Harpy, and others, but he never would have been able to go through with it. He knew that now.</p><p>No other woman would be able to assuage the ache. No other woman would taste the same\u2014sweetness and light. No other woman would be as soft. No other woman\u2019s moans would be as intoxicating. Oh, yes, only Nicola would do.</p><p>\u201cWhy is that vein throbbing in your temple?\u201d Axel asked. \u201cLaila\u2019s not your woman, right? Or is she? I\u2019ve asked before but you\u2019ve never said. Are you thinking about doing a sister-wife thing? Because it\u2019s totally not the party in the box you think it will be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he gritted. \u201cLaila isn\u2019t mine.\u201d But he wasn\u2019t sure how Nicola would feel about her sister being with a Sent One that wouldn\u2019t keep her. \u201cIf you hurt her...\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d the warrior said, palms up. \u201cI deprived her of Blainey Boo Bear, or whatever lame nickname humans like to give each other, and I owed her big fun\u2014and no, that\u2019s not the name of my penis, even though it fits. They\u2019d swapped so many stories about their exes they were both depressed. I did her a favor, and she kicked me out afterward, not the other way around. She just used me and ditched me, and made me feel all dirty inside. So of course I\u2019m hoping we can do it again.\u201d</p><p>Koldo wiped his brow with the back of his hand. \u201cAnd she didn\u2019t pass out?\u201d he found himself asking.</p><p>\u201cWell, yeah. Yours did, too, eh?\u201d</p><p>He shouted, \u201cAnd you took her anyway?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHello. I woke her up first.\u201d</p><p>Koldo shook his head. The male had no shame.</p><p>\u201cSo we\u2019re building a cage?\u201d Axel asked, as he claimed a hammer of his own. \u201cThat\u2019s what you told Nicola, right?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo more questions,\u201d he said, looking away. His gaze landed on Nicola, perched next to her sister in front of the kitchen window, gazing out. She waved, unabashed at being caught staring. He swallowed a curse.</p><p>Desire wasn\u2019t supposed to hurt. Was it?</p><p>THOUGH THE TIME ZONES were off, Koldo knew when Monday morning dawned in Kansas, and flashed Nicola and Laila to the rear of the Estell\u00e4 building. The girls hadn\u2019t wanted to be parted, and he\u2019d liked the idea of having them both in the same location.</p> <p>He materialized in the natural realm and walked the pair from the alley to the front door.</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t grant my request and quit?\u201d he asked Nicola. \u201cEven though it\u2019s dangerous here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Frustrating woman. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause she won\u2019t always have you, but she\u2019ll always need the job,\u201d Laila answered.</p> <p>He...had no protest, he realized. He planned to keep Nicola, but he was as uncertain about his future as any human. Actually, his was more uncertain than most.</p><p>\u201cVery well,\u201d he replied, because really, there was nothing else to say. He stomped inside and into the confines of the elevator.</p><p>There were two other males in the tiny cart, and they pressed themselves against the far wall, getting as far away from him as they could. He forced his scowl to ease before the pair began screaming for aid.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t look at the women, and you\u2019ll be fine,\u201d he said.</p><p>Instantly they averted their gazes.</p><p>Nicola\u2019s sweet perfume wafted around him, and his anger with her was lost to another punch of arousal. At what point would his body just shut down, the desire for this woman too much to endure? How was he supposed to ease her into making love without killing himself?</p> <p>She leaned into him and whispered, \u201cThe last time we were in an elevator together, I wanted to sniff your neck.\u201d</p><p>He sucked in a breath. She really was going to kill him.</p><p>\u201cI wonder how you would have reacted.\u201d</p><p>Laila gagged. \u201cIf you guys get any more lovey-dovey, I\u2019m going to puke.\u201d</p><p>Nicola slapped her on the arm. Laila slapped her back, and the two erupted into a childish fight and a fit of giggles.</p><p>The elevator dinged, and the doors slid open. The men raced out, and the girls ceased their antics, acting as if they\u2019d never attacked each other. Silly humans. But their play lightened his mood. Oh, to have a playmate.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t sure whether or not Axel had slept with Laila again last night, but either way, her color was better, and there was a bounce to her step.</p><p>Koldo wanted to put that same bounce in Nicola\u2019s step.</p> <p>He took her hand\u2014soft, delicate\u2014and ushered her to her office. Jamila sat at one of the desks out front, dressed in a tight black dress, her dark hair piled on top of her head. Sirena was nowhere to be found.</p><p>Guard her, he projected into the Sent One\u2019s mind. An ability he was more and more comfortable using, he realized. Anything for Nicola\u2019s safety. With your life.</p><p>Jamila blinked in surprise, but nodded.</p><p>He yearned to kiss Nicola goodbye, but couldn\u2019t allow himself the luxury. At the moment of contact, he would convince himself it would be okay to take things further. Already his muscles were knotted. His blood was fever-hot. His palms itched.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be back,\u201d he growled, and didn\u2019t wait for Nicola\u2019s reply. Her expression was one of confusion, but now wasn\u2019t the time to explain his thoughts\u2014and if he tried, he would only make things worse.</p><p>The moment he cleared the doorway, he entered the spirit realm. He stalked through the entire building, searching for unattached demons and lurking Nefas. He found neither.</p><p>He should have forced Nicola to quit, but...he couldn\u2019t bring himself to argue with her. He didn\u2019t want her mind on his stubbornness, didn\u2019t want her to think he was mean. How ridiculous was that? He was mean.</p><p>He just, he wanted her focused on her healing.</p><p>And that wasn\u2019t an attempt to buy her affection, he told himself. Even though, every time she looked at him with those big stormy eyes, he experienced a desperate urge to hand her the world.</p><p>He materialized in the natural before pushing through the door to the accounting offices. Jamila was exactly where he\u2019d left her, but now, Sirena was also in place. Sirena, meaning temptress. And she was certainly that\u2014for other men. She was the girl who had slept with Dex. The girl of questionable origins.</p><p>It was time to talk to her, and find out what she had planned.</p><p>When he loomed in front of her desk, she glanced up from polishing her nails. \u201cWell, hello there, gorgeous.\u201d Her bold gaze perused him from head to toe, lingering on his chest, between his legs, making him feel like a piece of meat. \u201cYou decided to return. I\u2019m glad.\u201d</p><p>He flattened his hands beside her keyboard and leaned forward. \u201cWhat are you?\u201d</p><p>A sultry grin revealed a mouthful of pearly whites. \u201cWhat do you want me to be?\u201d</p><p>The pale haired, blue-eyed vixen failed to tempt him in any way, even though she would have been a more appropriate choice for his mate. Though she was small, she was stronger than a human, with a greater muscle tone hidden underneath her bulky clothes. He wouldn\u2019t break her, and her health wouldn\u2019t fail.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you?\u201d he repeated.</p><p>\u201cWhy, I\u2019m Nicola Lane\u2019s coworker. What else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know what I mean.\u201d</p><p>She bopped the tip of his nose with a fingernail. \u201cDo I?\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d always resented the fact that he couldn\u2019t taste another\u2019s lies. \u201cYou do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe I do.\u201d A pause as she returned the lid to the polish. \u201cYou\u2019re Koldo, aren\u2019t you? The Sent One with a will of steel and a fist as hard as iron. I\u2019ve been hoping to meet you for a very long time.\u201d</p><p>She was here for him, then, not Nicola. Sent by his father? he wondered again. To...what? \u201cI\u2019m a Sent One, yes, but I\u2019m also Nicola\u2019s protector, and I\u2019ll destroy anyone who thinks to hurt her to get to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you\u2019re not doing a very good job with your protecting duties,\u201d she announced, and tsked. \u201cI could have killed her at any time. And I wanted to, I admit it. Resisting has proven difficult.\u201d</p><p>A flicker of rage practically burned a hole in his chest. He could feel his teeth and nails elongating. Control. \u201cYou\u2019ve done something to strike at her, haven\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>She flicked her tongue over one overlong canine. \u201cI have, but before I start bragging, you should know I\u2019m the one who raised the false alarm about the demons. I knew you\u2019d return again and again to investigate. And guess what? You have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you wanted to see me...because?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause we\u2019re destined to be together.\u201d She leaned back and traced a finger between her breasts. \u201cAs for what I did to Nicola... I stole her petty cash and doctored a few of her accounts. And she would have been arrested if your precious Jamila hadn\u2019t found out and fixed everything. But don\u2019t worry. I\u2019ll get her next time.\u201d</p><p>Destined to be together? He reached out and grabbed the girl by the neck, jerking her into the air. As she yelped, he flashed her to the cavern where he\u2019d kept his mother. Cornelia was now in the other cage he\u2019d built for her, though he hadn\u2019t yet explained things to Nicola.</p><p>He\u2019d tried, but had stopped himself. What if she was unable to understand?</p><p>He dropped Sirena in the center of the cage and flashed out, behind the bars. She whirled around to face him, her eyes narrowing. \u201cWhat do you think you\u2019re doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThink? No. Know? Yes. You\u2019ll stay here for a few days. On your own, with nothing to do but ponder how best to appease me. I\u2019ll return and you\u2019ll tell me everything I want to know and probably a thousand things I don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>She raced toward him, trying to reach through the bars and grab him.</p><p>Grinning coldly, he flashed back to the office.</p><p>But he wasn\u2019t given a chance to speak with Nicola. Axel was there with Jamila, and the two were arguing.</p><p>\u201cWhatever you\u2019re planning to do needs to wait,\u201d the warrior said when he spotted Koldo. \u201cI\u2019ve found Nefas tracks just outside this building.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER TWENTY-THREE</p><p>THE LIGHTS IN NICOLA\u2019S OFFICE flicked off\u2014yet no one stood at the switch.</p><p>Laila stopped dancing. \u201cPower go out?\u201d she asked, her voice louder than it should have been as she listened to her iPod.</p><p>\u201cNo. My computer\u2019s running.\u201d</p><p>The lights flipped back on.</p><p>\u201cA momentary short in the wires, maybe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re probably right.\u201d Laila started dancing again.</p><p>Nicola returned to the work piled up in front of her. Jamila and Sirena had only done half of what they\u2019d promised, and nothing that had come in since. So utterly useless, she thought.</p><p>An instant message popped up on her screen.</p><p>Dex Turner:</p><p>What happened Sat? Who was that guy?</p><p>Her palms grew damp as she typed:</p><p>I\u2019m sorry! Koldo is a guy I met a few weeks ago. We had never dated, but we had\u2014never mind. It\u2019s complicated, and I know that sounds clich\u00e9, but it\u2019s true nonetheless. I\u2019m sorry, though. I really am. But now I\u2019m together with him. For sure.</p><p>Even though he\u2019d acted like a jerk today, snipping and snapping at her before marching off without any explanation.</p><p>The lights flicked back off. On. Off.</p><p>Sighing, she propped her elbows on her desk and rested her head in her upraised hands.</p><p>On. Off. On. Off.</p><p>\u201cSeriously, this is annoying,\u201d Laila said with a tremble to her voice. \u201cAnd okay, fine, a little scary.\u201d</p><p>Nicola never moved, but her phone was suddenly thrown across the room. The device slammed into the wall and shattered, little pieces raining to the floor. Laila yelped and darted in her direction.</p><p>Demons, Nicola realized. Dread slithered through her.</p><p>\u201cGet underneath the desk,\u201d she commanded. \u201cAnd stay calm.\u201d</p><p>Her sister obeyed, gasping out, \u201cWhat about you?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The sound of hissing and giggling filled her ears. Dark shadows crept along the walls. Definitely demons. Her heart skipped a beat, the first sign of oncoming fear, but she resisted.</p><p>I\u2019m not helpless. I\u2019m protected.</p><p>That\u2019s right. She was. She leaped up. In the corner, a shadow thickened, solidified into a hazy blob and scurried across the desk, reaching out to brush her hair. A light breeze dusted her skin, the scent of rotten eggs clinging to her nose.</p> <p>On went the lights.</p><p>Off.</p><p>On\u2014and as brightness flooded the room once again, five demons came into view, and they resembled the snakes from the park. Their scales were the same shade as blood, and their temples were flared. They had glowing green eyes, and jaws open wide, revealing fangs sharper than any knife, with a yellowed substance drip, drip, dripping onto the floor and burning, causing the carpet to sizzle and steam to rise.</p><p>Forked tongues slithered out, waving in her direction.</p><p>I\u2019m not helpless. I\u2019m really not. I\u2019m protected. I really am.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll enjoy having you for breakfassst,\u201d one taunted.</p><p>\u201cYour sssister will be desssert,\u201d another added.</p><p>More giggles.</p><p>She opened her mouth to shout for the Most High, but the door burst open, silencing her. Sirena raced inside, pale hair flying behind her. She brandished a long, thin sword, and the snakes jolted backward, cursing at her.</p><p>\u201cGet out of here, fiends! Now,\u201d she shouted. Metal whistled through air, and the creatures darted left and right, desperate to get out of her way.</p><p>One of the creatures disappeared in a puff of black smoke. Another soon followed.</p> <p>There was a wild light in Sirena\u2019s blue eyes, one that said she was just crazy enough to fight the demons with her bare hands if necessary. Those remaining must have sensed her determination, because they tossed one last hiss in Nicola\u2019s direction and vanished.</p><p>Panting, Sirena dropped the sword on the floor. \u201cYou\u2019re safe.\u201d</p><p>Laila peeked out from underneath the desk as Nicola raced over to her. \u201cAre you all right, Sirena?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d The girl brushed her fall of pale hair over one shoulder. \u201cPromise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did you do that?\u201d Inside, Nicola\u2019s instincts were churning. Something wasn\u2019t right. \u201cHow did you know we needed help?\u201d</p><p>She flashed a quick smile. \u201cI\u2019m like Koldo. He asked me to look after you.\u201d</p><p>Koldo! He hadn\u2019t abandoned her, after all.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just glad I got here in time,\u201d Sirena added a little tightly. \u201cThose things are dangerous. They\u2019re the foul offspring of serp demons and Nefas.\u201d</p> <p>Nicola placed her hand on her stomach to ward off the oncoming ache. \u201cThank you. Thank you for helping us.\u201d</p><p>Laila stood, swaying. Her skin had taken on a sickly cast, and her eyes had glassed over. \u201cAre you okay, Co Co?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am. You?\u201d</p><p>\u201cF-fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you both want to stay that way, we have to get out of here,\u201d Sirena announced. \u201cKoldo wants you with him. Come on. I\u2019ll take you to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI DON\u2019T LIKE THIS,\u201d Koldo said. It was too easy. The Nefas had never been this obvious with their tracks.</p><p>He and Axel had gone from point A to B to C and now D, without ever having to search for a clue. The breadcrumbs had just been here and there, obvious to any Sent One. A trail from the flashes. A glaze of venom on a door. A spiked footprint. A hint of sulfur-scented smoke. A scattering of serp demon scales.</p><p>\u201cWant to get a mani-pedi and discuss our options?\u201d Axel asked.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d They were aware of the fact that this could be a trap, and so they could turn the plan against the Nefas.</p><p>Koldo darted through the back alley, Axel a few paces behind him, each hidden in the spirit realm, their swords of fire at the ready. But the further he followed the newest trail, the clearer Koldo remembered the times he\u2019d helped his father provide false tracks for others, even though they\u2019d known the searcher would suspect it was a trap. Nox had never cared about that\u2014had only wanted the males distracted.</p><p>Distracted, so that Nox could steal something of value without any opposition.</p><p>Koldo stopped, and Axel slammed into his back. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a trap, it\u2019s a distraction. He just wants us away from Estell\u00e4.\u201d</p><p>Teeth grinding, Koldo released the sword of fire and flashed to the building, into Nicola\u2019s office. He found the phone shattered on the floor. He found a discarded weapon\u2014one he recognized. Long, thin, the metal stretching from a hilt that appeared to be the wide jaw of a snake.</p><p>His father\u2019s.</p><p>The first spark of rage hit him. Nicola\u2019s perfume created a soft sweetness in the air, but that sweetness couldn\u2019t cover the taint of sulfur. Serp demons had been here. And Nicola was...was...</p><p>No! He punched the wall. She was alive, he told himself. He wouldn\u2019t believe anything else. His father wouldn\u2019t kill his only ace.</p><p>But still the rage magnified, such dark, dark rage. His teeth elongated; his nails sharpened.</p><p>Control. He needed answers. What had happened here? Where was Jamila? How had the demons gotten Nicola out of the building?</p><p>They would have had to trick her or take her by force. With the destruction in this office, he had to go with force. So...why hadn\u2019t she asked the Most High for help? Why hadn\u2019t she peered at her tattoos?</p><p>Or had she?</p><p>Had she acted too late?</p><p>Had both force and trickery been used?</p><p>This time, the rage grew like a tree, sprouting branches, budding leaves, until he couldn\u2019t see past the thickness of the foliage. Koldo swiped the papers and files from the desk and onto the floor. The computer was next, the screen cracking. He picked up the desk and slammed it down, the wood splitting. He ripped the chair into pieces. Punched another hole in the wall. Then another and another.</p><p>Stop. You have to stop. This isn\u2019t you. Not anymore.</p><p>He paused, panting, sweating\u2014wasting time, he realized.</p><p>He breathed in and out, forcing himself to become the calm, rational man his woman needed. Nicola couldn\u2019t have been gone long\u2014Koldo had seen her an hour ago. But then, he knew how much damage could be done in that amount of time.</p><p>Steady.</p><p>Axel landed beside him, took one look around the room and understood what had happened without having to be told. \u201cOur new plan?\u201d</p><p>The human authorities might decide to delve into Nicola\u2019s disappearance, and he didn\u2019t need their interference\u2014they would only slow him down. \u201cClean this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh, that would be a no. I have people for that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCall them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlready done. They\u2019ll be here in five.\u201d</p><p>Koldo nodded stiffly, the only kind of thanks he could manage.</p><p>\u201cSo what do you want to do?\u201d Axel asked.</p><p>He scrubbed a hand down his face. Where would Nox have taken her? His father was a braggart, a showman and big on vengeance. Every misdeed was punished. Koldo\u2019s most recent crime was the killing of the messenger in the park\u2014</p><p>Yes. The park. The scene of the crime.</p><p>\u201cThe park,\u201d he said, and flashed to the very spot where he\u2019d decapitated his father\u2019s man. Too late, Koldo realized he should have demanded Axel stay behind. The warrior could find out about Koldo\u2019s past, his lineage, and tell the others in their army.</p><p>No. It didn\u2019t matter. Koldo wanted Nicola safe, whatever the cost.</p><p>He cataloged the area\u2014and when his gaze landed on a male who should have been dead, his breath caught in his chest.</p><p>Nox. His father. Alive, all this time. There was no question about that now.</p><p>Koldo stumbled backward with the force of his shock. Yes, he\u2019d suspected. But seeing the evidence was a blow he\u2019d been unprepared to take. This should have been impossible.</p><p>Nox stood in the center of a dirt pile, where a tree had once been, buffing his nails, allowing Koldo to study him. The male responsible for so many years of torment. Nox was everything Koldo remembered. Tall and strong, with dark, evil eyes.</p><p>He was tattooed from the neck down, with gruesome images that told stories of pain and suffering. They were marks of victory. Some for those against enemies. Some for his female conquests. Some for acts of revenge. Blood appeared to drip. Heads seemed to roll. He also had several piercings in his eyebrows, two in his lip, one in his chin.</p><p>Koldo stepped from the spirit realm to face his worst nightmare and save the sweetest woman he\u2019d known. \u201cWhere is she?\u201d</p><p>His father looked him over, triumph twisting his features and revealing the ugliness of his core. \u201cAren\u2019t you a pretty thing?\u201d His voice was deep. Husky.</p><p>Hated.</p><p>The only reason Nox had never forcibly shaved Koldo\u2019s head, pierced Koldo\u2019s face or tattooed Koldo\u2019s body was because the traits were considered admirable among the Nefas and Koldo hadn\u2019t yet earned the right.</p><p>\u201cYou should be dead,\u201d Koldo said.</p><p>A smug smirk, one of thousands Koldo had received over the years. \u201cOh, you mean that pathetic attempt you made to kill me all those years ago? I saw you coming and flashed away. Your rain of fire failed to singe a single part of me.\u201d</p><p>He raised his chin. \u201cYour people can\u2019t say the same. You abandoned them, choosing to save yourself rather than to stay and issue a warning.\u201d</p><p>In a snap, the smugness gave way to fury. \u201cYou are responsible for their deaths, not me. You\u2019re the reason I\u2019ve had to spend all this time rebuilding. Planning. Waiting. I knew I couldn\u2019t hurt a man who had nothing to lose.\u201d</p><p>Having Nox\u2019s intentions stated so plainly\u2014to hurt Nicola in an effort to hurt Koldo\u2014doused his rage with fear. Nox never made an empty threat. He only made promises.</p><p>\u201cWhere are the girls?\u201d Koldo demanded.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll get to that,\u201d Nox replied smoothly.</p><p>A whoosh of air, and then Axel was beside him, wings tucked into his back.</p><p>Nox grinned slowly. \u201cYou made a friend. How nice. But all that means is that more blood will spill today.\u201d</p><p>Humans walked past, spotted them and picked up the pace. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAw. The ugly Nefas thinks he\u2019s going to win.\u201d Axel placed a hand over his heart. \u201cIt\u2019d be cute if it wasn\u2019t so stupid. I bet you\u2019re a crier, aren\u2019t you? Yeah, you\u2019ll cry when you\u2019re spanked. I can tell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe girls,\u201d Koldo insisted.</p><p>\u201cHere.\u201d</p> <p>The new speaker had him turning to the left. He watched as Sirena stepped from a puff of black smoke, dragging Nicola and Laila behind her.</p><p>The girls were bound, pale and shaking. Sirena gave a vicious tug of her wrists, yanking at their ties, and they tripped forward, falling to the ground. Nicola had a split lip and a bruised jaw, but Laila was otherwise unharmed. There was a clear strip of tape covering both their mouths, and tears had stained red tracks down Laila\u2019s cheeks. Nicola radiated anger and determination.</p><p>She would fight. Till her dying breath, she would fight.</p><p>Koldo\u2019s rage returned full force, guilt fast on its heels. He should have protected her. But he hadn\u2019t. He had failed. And he would punish himself for it, he vowed. No one would have to do it for him. He would make sure he suffered for this.</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d he demanded.</p> <p>Sirena preened, fluffing her hair. \u201cLike you, I can flash. I\u2019m surprised you didn\u2019t realize. But I do appreciate the suggested stay at Chez Caveman.\u201d</p><p>She could flash. She wasn\u2019t bald, but she could produce black smoke when she flashed. She was definitely Nefas, though she must be of mixed race, like him. Her other half wasn\u2019t Sent One, that was for sure. She had no wings, hidden or otherwise. No sword of fire.</p><p>\u201cLook at that,\u201d his father said. \u201cMy only children are getting along so well. How delightful.\u201d</p><p>Axel, who had moved, but had remained at Koldo\u2019s side, stiffened.</p><p>But then, so did Koldo. Nox\u2019s only...children? Koldo\u2019s study of Sirena intensified. She was short. He was tall. She was blonde, her eyes blue. He was dark-headed, his eyes amber. But...their features were somewhat similar, he realized. They had the same strong cheekbones, the same proud nose and stubborn chin.</p><p>He...he had a sister.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll give you one chance,\u201d Nox said. As he spoke, five serp demons rose from the dirt and slithered to his sides. \u201cJust one to make things right between us. Bind yourself to Sirena and continue my bloodline, or die here with your woman\u2014after I play with her a little.\u201d</p><p>A trick, surely. \u201cYou expect me to wed a blood relation?\u201d</p><p>\u201cExpect? No.\u201d Nox laughed with evil intent, the sound chilling. \u201cDemand? Yes.\u201d</p><p>Koldo popped his jaw, not allowing himself to so much as glance at Nicola and catch her reaction to this.</p><p>\u201cSirena\u2019s a tasty little treat,\u201d his father added, reaching out to pat her bottom. \u201cYou\u2019ll quite enjoy her. I did.\u201d</p><p>Disgusting male. And I sprang from his loins. \u201cAre you agreeable to this?\u201d he barked at Sirena.</p><p>\u201cI am,\u201d she said, and bent over Nicola. She placed a kiss against the tape covering her mouth as the girl tried to turn her head away. Sirena\u2019s intentions were clear: she wanted Nicola\u2019s soul. All the while her gaze remained on Koldo. \u201cYou\u2019ve been promised to me since my birth, and I will have you. One way or another. What happens to the human depends on you.\u201d</p><p>Four other Nefas strolled over to their group, one eating from a bag of popcorn, another biting into a caramel apple and another drinking a cup of coffee. But he could see the guns and knives stashed at their wrists, waist and ankles. They were warriors.</p> <p>Worse, there were two demons with them. Lefty and Righty. Lefty\u2019s arm had been reattached, though it hung limply at his side, but Righty\u2019s horn was still missing. Both males were grinning.</p><p>I\u2019ll flash to the girls and throw them at you, he projected into Axel\u2019s mind. Catch them and fly them to safety. I\u2019ll stay behind to fight.</p><p>He expected resistance. After all, a Sent One had just found out that Koldo was half-Nefas, the vilest race to walk the earth.</p><p>Instead, Axel said, Dude, you better keep yourself alive. There\u2019s no way I can deal with those two ladies for long...without throwing a shagging party.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s it to be?\u201d Nox demanded.</p><p>The serps slithered to the girls, mouths hovering near their ears, ready to breathe their toxin all over them. The girls would experience intense waves of fear, and that fear would open their minds to harsher attack. Were they strong enough to resist? To overcome?</p><p>Sirena gave Nicola\u2019s taped mouth another kiss, and grinned.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have her,\u201d he said\u2014though he failed to specify which one. And the word have had many different meanings, didn\u2019t it?</p><p>Nicola flinched. Laila sobbed into the ground.</p><p>Sirena straightened.</p><p>Nox nodded with satisfaction, but said, \u201cI don\u2019t actually believe you. But that\u2019s okay. You won\u2019t leave this spot until it\u2019s done. Then, you\u2019ll have to be punished for killing my people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. That\u2019s not how this will go down.\u201d He flashed to the girls, dislodging Sirena as he covered both humans with his own body. The serps immediately bounded into action, exhaling their toxin before sinking fangs into his arms.</p><p>A burning in his veins, a release of the venom.</p><p>The moment the creatures pulled back, intending to make another play, he tossed both females at Axel, as planned. The angel\u2019s wings whipped out, and he darted into the air, leaving Koldo alone with a horde of enraged Nefas.</p><p>CHAPTER TWENTY-FOUR</p><p>\u201cYOU SHOULDN\u2019T HAVE done that,\u201d Nox said, reaching up to grab the hilt of a sword he\u2019d strapped to his back. \u201cI was willing to be nice. Now, not so much.\u201d</p><p>Sirena withdrew two short swords.</p><p>The four Nefas warriors dropped their food and withdrew guns.</p><p>Lefty and Righty unsheathed their claws.</p><p>\u201cWe should take this somewhere private,\u201d Koldo said.</p><p>One word from his father. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Very well, then. Koldo extended his arm and summoned the sword of fire. The flames burst forth, a mix of yellow and blue, crackling. He would be battling his enemies in both the natural and the spiritual realms. It wasn\u2019t ideal, but it also wasn\u2019t impossible.</p><p>Most of the humans in the park gasped at the display of aggression and weaponry. Some ran. Some sat down as if they were about to be entertained with an after-dinner theater performance.</p><p>The Nefas flashed to Koldo\u2019s sides as the demons converged. He swung the sword left and right in quick succession, going for his father first, but the male flashed a few feet away to avoid being hit. At the same time, the others lashed out at him. He dodged one, two, three, but not the rest, and took the impact in his arm, side and leg.</p><p>A bullet grazed his shoulder. A sharp sting caused him to hiss. Bleeding, he flashed behind Nox, and swung his sword. But his father sensed him and also flashed, leaving three of his men vulnerable. The sword slicked through their bodies. Two of the Nefas went down face-first, dead. The other whipped around as he fell and squeezed off another shot. This time, Koldo flashed before the bullets could nail him.</p><p>Lefty realized he was close enough to strike and swung, his wing slicing out, reaching...missing. Koldo flashed to the other side, struck\u2014decapitating a Nefas. But Lefty and Righty were familiar with his brand of fighting and anticipated his landing.</p><p>The moment he was busy swinging his sword at someone else, they flew up and over, kicking him in the face. He stumbled backward. A chorus of \u201cooh\u201d and \u201caah\u201d erupted from the growing crowd.</p><p>Sirena flashed behind him, catching him before he could straighten, but rather than stab him, as he expected, she pressed her body against his, and dug her nails into his neck. Nails that seemed to leak a boiling liquid straight into his veins. Her grip was strong. Impossibly strong.</p><p>Hot breath fanned over his skin as she said, \u201cI\u2019m going to relish cutting your female to ribbons and sucking out her soul.\u201d She jumped up to lick his cheek with a long, hot stroke. \u201cYou\u2019re mine, and don\u2019t you ever forget it.\u201d</p><p>As she spoke, the serps wrapped their tails around his ankles and jerked. He slammed his elbow backward, drilling Sirena in the stomach as he fell. They both went down. As breath exploded from her in a pained rush, he tried to turn, determined to end her. But the demons still locked around his ankles gave a vicious tug, and he skidded away.</p><p>Lefty and Righty were there, kicking and punching at him. All the while, the remaining Nefas flashed in and out, punching and vanishing, punching and vanishing. Sharp stings erupted over every inch of him. He rolled over, and the demons clawed at him as he tried to sit up. He let them, wanting them close enough for contact\u2014with his weapon. They scratched and bit at him, lost to their need for revenge, unaware he was raising his sword of fire.</p><p>He killed three before Sirena regained her composure and approached him alongside Nox. But when Sirena raised her arm, as if to strike him, putting herself in harm\u2019s way, Nox shoved his daughter out of the way. She slammed into the two demons approaching his other side, the three tumbling to the ground, away from the strike of Koldo\u2019s sword. Still Koldo carved through the demons at his feet. Fetid steam rose, and black blood spilled. The grass sizzled.</p><p>A booted foot propelled into his side. Nox\u2019s.</p><p>He rolled to avoid another kick, and saw a glint of metal in the corner of his eye. One of the Nefas was lifting a sword, preparing to behead him. Again, Koldo rolled, the tip of the weapon slamming into the dirt, dark grains flying in every direction. He flashed to a stand a few feet away, just behind his father. He swung, and the fiery tip slicked just above Nox\u2019s shoulder, headed for his heart, before the male flashed away.</p><p>A whoosh of wings penetrated his ears, followed by another. Malcolm and Magnus landed a few feet away from him, Jamila behind them. Grunts began to split the air. Metal slammed against burning metal, clanging. Koldo spun, and saw that the Sent Ones were engaged in a fierce battle. Malcolm and a Nefas. Magnus and a Nefas. Jamila and Sirena. The Nefas could have flashed away for good, but Koldo knew their mind-set. Knew they liked to remain in a battle as long as possible, inflicting as much damage as they could, only leaving at the threat of death. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The serps were in the process of slithering away as quickly as possible.</p><p>Nox hadn\u2019t returned.</p><p>Malcolm attacked with hands gloved in spiked metal. The Nefas warrior he fought had leaking holes all over his body. The male staggered backward, and Malcolm eagerly chased. But Magnus beat his brother to the prize and used a whip to decapitate the creature before he could flash away.</p> <p>The two nodded at each other in a job well done.</p><p>Jamila was obviously weaker than Sirena, and was tripping more than she was swinging. Koldo pulled a dagger from an air pocket and flashed behind his sister\u2014his sister!\u2014and grabbed her just as she had grabbed him.</p><p>He lifted the weapon, determined to plunge it deep. He wouldn\u2019t waste time with threats. Growling with frustration and rage, Sirena performed her final flash before he could strike. The only other remaining Nefas disappeared a second later.</p><p>The sound of police sirens caught Koldo\u2019s attention.</p><p>The crowd looked around, their smiles giving way to frowns. The clapping tapered off as the onlookers realized the authorities wouldn\u2019t have come for a performance.</p> <p>Acting quickly, Koldo and the other Sent Ones picked up the pieces of the deceased and tossed them into air pockets, then stepped into the spiritual realm. As policemen rushed into the area, the crowd bolted with confusion, and the Sent Ones faced each other.</p><p>\u201cHow did you know where I was and what I needed?\u201d Koldo asked.</p><p>\u201cAxel told us,\u201d Malcolm said, rubbing the spikes in his hands together.</p><p>And what else had Axel mentioned? He waited, but no one informed him of anything more.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d he said. He wouldn\u2019t tell them he\u2019d had no need of them, that he would have pulled through on his own, because he still couldn\u2019t bring himself to lie. And they would have tasted it, anyway.</p><p>To Jamila, he stiffly said, \u201cWhy weren\u2019t you at Estell\u00e4?\u201d</p> <p>Her chin lifted. \u201cThat little witch Sirena flashed me to a cage in a cave and locked me inside. I can\u2019t flash and couldn\u2019t leave. I had to summon help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI needed you with Nicola,\u201d he said, even though he knew he couldn\u2019t fault her for how things had gone down. They\u2019d both been taken by surprise. But he wasn\u2019t exactly rational at the moment.</p><p>\u201cWell, too bad,\u201d she snapped. \u201cNicola Lane is your responsibility, not mine.\u201d</p><p>She was, wasn\u2019t she? \u201cShe will never again set foot in Estell\u00e4 Industries.\u201d He would make sure of it. And if she protested, she protested. He would deal with the fallout, as he should have done before this happened. \u201cI\u2019ll take things from here.\u201d</p><p>Koldo flashed to the house in Panama\u2014or rather, tried to. He remained in place. He frowned, and once again tried to flash. But once again he remained where he was.</p><p>What was wrong? He\u2019d been bitten by the serps. He\u2019d been stabbed, shot and scratched by the Nefas. But he\u2019d endured all of that before\u2014and worse\u2014with no such consequences. Only difference was...Sirena, he realized with sickening dread. She had leaked something into his veins.</p><p>If he\u2019d forever lost his ability to flash\u2014</p><p>He couldn\u2019t finish that thought without howling. No. Her poison would fade. He would recover.</p> <p>He had to recover.</p><p>But he\u2019d wanted to be punished, and this certainly fit.</p><p>At least now he knew Nox\u2019s game plan. He knew Sirena\u2019s purpose. He knew the Nefas and demons were working together. And he knew Lefty and Righty were back in the picture, more determined than ever to reclaim Nicola.</p><p>\u201cFly me to Panama,\u201d he told Malcolm, his cheeks heating with embarrassment. He hated that he had to rely on another being for his transportation.</p><p>\u201cWow. Aren\u2019t you a big bag of polite,\u201d Malcolm muttered, but still the warrior strode over to him and wrapped him in his arms. \u201cYou\u2019ll owe me for this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d That was the way of the world. He only wondered if Nicola found him as aggravating as he now found Malcolm.</p><p>White wings laced with gold flared, and a twinge of envy lit a fire in Koldo\u2019s chest. Then they were airborne, the wind whipping against his skin, and he found himself closing his eyes and pretending he was soaring on his own. That he was healthy and whole.</p><p>That he had an untainted future.</p><p>KOLDO ARRIVED AT the ranch cradled in the arms of another man. A beautiful Asian man with a green fauxhawk, weird silvery eyes and tattoos of bones on his neck. Just...wow, he was beautiful, but he was also seriously scary.</p><p>Desperate to figure out a way to return to the park and help Koldo, Nicola had been pacing in front of the couch, where Axel and Laila sat. If anyone could win with ten-against-one odds, it was Koldo.</p><p>Koldo, who had promised to marry Sirena. His horrible troll of a sister.</p><p>Koldo, who never lied.</p><p>\u201cHe lost consciousness halfway here,\u201d the newcomer said.</p><p>\u201cPut him\u2014\u201d Axel began, standing.</p><p>Nicola cut him off. \u201cPut him in my bed.\u201d She rushed forward to show the new guy the way, surprised her heart wasn\u2019t pounding more forcefully and that she wasn\u2019t light-headed.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t leave me here, Co Co!\u201d Laila shouted.</p><p>She glanced back to watch Laila shrink to the edge of the couch in an effort to get as far away from Axel as she could.</p><p>\u201cAnd don\u2019t you dare touch me!\u201d Laila yelled at him. \u201cI don\u2019t want anything else to do with any of your kind!\u201d</p><p>Axel shrugged and strolled to the kitchen. \u201cYou want something to do with a muffin? I\u2019m starved.\u201d</p><p>Nicola was torn between rushing back to her sister to offer comfort and staying with Koldo. In the end, she shouted, \u201cNo one\u2019s going to hurt you, La La, I promise,\u201d and raced to the bed to jerk the comforter and sheets out of the way. Then she moved so that the newcomer could easily place Koldo in the center.</p><p>\u201cWhat was done to him?\u201d she asked, heading into the bathroom to gather a washrag drenched in hot water and all the creams and cleansers Koldo had brought from her house.</p><p>\u201cWar.\u201d</p><p>Well, duh. She would ask Koldo, then. When he awoke. And he would. She wouldn\u2019t believe otherwise. \u201cGive me a knife,\u201d she said when she next stood beside the bed.</p><p>Fauxhawk frowned. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I can cut away his robe and doctor him. Why else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you can kill him,\u201d he stated simply.</p><p>\u201cI would never hurt him!\u201d She placed all of the supplies on the mattress. \u201cWe\u2019re dating.\u201d Or rather, they had been, BS. Before Sirena.</p><p>\u201cGood for you, but that doesn\u2019t help your case. Just so you know, I\u2019ll hurt you worse than you\u2019ve ever been hurt if you injure him further.\u201d That said, he handed her a blade. Rather than leave the room, he rocked back on his heels and crossed his arms over his massive chest, as though waiting for her to mess up.</p><p>Nicola worked the tip down the center of the fabric, careful not to nick Koldo\u2019s skin. By the time she got to the hem of the robe, the top part had already woven itself back together.</p><p>\u201cHelp me,\u201d she commanded.</p><p>The warrior pursed his lips, as if he wasn\u2019t fond of being told what to do. \u201cYour male will owe me another favor, I think.\u201d</p><p>Another? \u201cI\u2019ll pay for your favor. How\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have nothing I desire.\u201d He bent down and ripped the robe in two, then yanked the material out from under Koldo.</p><p>\u201cSo why did you just help me?\u201d She dropped the blade and grabbed the robe before the man could discard it, then draped the fabric over Koldo\u2019s naked waist. He was littered with bite marks, cuts, bruises and scratches. At his neck, four tiny wounds in the shape of half-moons had turned black and now festered.</p><p>\u201cI told you. Your male will owe me another favor.\u201d</p><p>He was a great listener, wasn\u2019t he? \u201cSo what\u2019s your name, anyway?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMalcolm.\u201d</p><p>Nicola cleaned each of the injuries, taking extra care with the ones on his neck. Even still, the skin broke open and pus oozed out. Couldn\u2019t be an infection, she thought. Not enough time had passed. Had to be...poison?</p><p>She reached for the blade.</p><p>Malcolm latched on to her wrist, stopping her. \u201cI knew you would make a play.\u201d</p><p>Then why hadn\u2019t he stashed the weapon away from her? To test her motives? \u201cLook, I\u2019m going to slice the wounds open the rest of the way and\u2014\u201d</p><p>His grip tightened painfully, nearly cracking bone.</p><p>A cry parted her lips.</p><p>Footsteps pounded, and then Axel was there, ripping Malcolm away from her.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think you\u2019re doing, my man?\u201d the warrior demanded.</p><p>\u201cShe wants to cut into his neck!\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor a good cause,\u201d Nicola said with a sigh. \u201cI want to drain the wounds, and to do that, I need to widen them. I\u2019ll be careful with him.\u201d More careful than she\u2019d ever been. This man had come to mean a lot to her. More than he probably realized.</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t seen him panting after the female,\u201d Axel told Malcolm, pushing him toward the door. \u201cIf you had, you\u2019d know he wants her hands all over him\u2014whatever she wants to do.\u201d</p><p>Panting after her? I wish. \u201cWill you guys just get out of here? You\u2019re distracting me, and I need to concentrate. I may not be a doctor, but I\u2019ve watched every episode of House. I\u2019m pretty sure I know what I\u2019m doing.\u201d</p><p>Whether they obeyed or not, she wasn\u2019t sure. She settled beside Koldo\u2019s waist, leaned forward and raised the knife.</p><p>CHAPTER TWENTY-FIVE</p><p>KOLDO TUGGED HIMSELF from the darkness and into the light. Though he was paralyzed, his mind blank, he wasn\u2019t unaware. He felt gentle hands stroking over him, easing the stings that plagued him. The moment the stroking stopped, a wave of anger stormed through him, giving him the strength he needed to jolt into mobility.</p><p>He opened his eyes, but his vision was hazed. Blink, blink. Bit by bit, things began to clear. Blink, blink. He saw the glint of a knife. Saw a female stretch that knife toward him, aiming for his neck. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>His mother. His mother had escaped, was here, was determined to kill him while he was too vulnerable to fight back.</p><p>Growling from the depths of his being, he lashed out, hitting the knife and the arm that held it. A feminine moan of pain filled his ears.</p><p>A moan he recognized. Not his mother\u2019s.</p> <p>Nicola?</p><p>He tried to sit up, the gentle hands suddenly replaced by strong calloused ones, applying more pressure to push him down.</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t mean to hurt me,\u201d the woman said.</p><p>Yes, Nicola. His Nicola.</p><p>Had she been speaking to him? Or was someone else in the room?</p> <p>Of course someone else was in the room. The hands that restrained him belonged to a male. He recalled his father\u2019s threats against Nicola....</p><p>Koldo fought against the one keeping him in place. He managed to get his fingers wrapped around hard steel bands\u2014arms? He tossed with all of his strength. There was a crash, a cloud of plaster in the air.</p><p>\u201cEasy now,\u201d a male said.</p><p>Another voice he recognized. Not his father. But it wasn\u2019t Nicola, so he didn\u2019t care. Koldo wanted to get to her, and would do anything to succeed. He punched and punched and punched, until finally the male stopped trying to subdue him and started fighting back. But Koldo quickly got hold of something soft\u2014feathers\u2014and ripped.</p><p>A howl rent the air.</p><p>A soft weight landed on Koldo. He reached up to dislodge it, but caught Nicola\u2019s sweet scent.</p> <p>\u201cCalm down,\u201d she said, fingers brushing over his jawline. \u201cYou have to calm down now. All right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSafe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re safe. I\u2019m safe. We\u2019re at your home in Panama.\u201d</p><p>Trusting her, he relaxed against the mattress, wound his arms around her and held her close, breathing her in, savoring the scent of cinnamon and vanilla.</p><p>\u201cI have a bald patch now,\u201d one of the males said. Axel. \u201cDo you know how bad that sucks?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have a broken spine,\u201d the other growled. Malcolm.</p><p>\u201cLike you\u2019ve really got it worse. You might never walk again, but at least you look pretty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think I\u2019m pretty?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI think you\u2019re about to get a dagger in your gut.\u201d</p><p>Footsteps. Two sets, receding from the room. Malcolm must not have lost the ability to walk, after all.</p><p>\u201cStay,\u201d Koldo said to Nicola.</p><p>\u201cI will,\u201d she whispered. \u201cRest now.\u201d</p><p>Unable to deny her anything, he sank back into the darkness.</p><p>SHARDS OF LIGHT penetrated his consciousness. Koldo was glad, even though the light was accompanied by pain. He was used to pain. But the moment he worked his way to full consciousness, where Nicola\u2019s voice soothed and delighted, he was tugged back into the waiting darkness.</p><p>How much time passed, he wasn\u2019t sure.</p><p>The light tried again, lifting him up, higher and higher.</p><p>\u201c\u2014you\u2019re sure he\u2019s not marrying her?\u201d Nicola asked.</p><p>\u201cPositive,\u201d Axel replied.</p><p>\u201cBut he doesn\u2019t lie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe wasn\u2019t lying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cArgh! How can that be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAsk him.\u201d</p><p>Darkness.</p><p>Light.</p><p>\u201c\u2014and all of these Sent Ones have been showing up to check on you. I\u2019ve been cooking for them, and I\u2019m getting better.\u201d A soft chuckle caressed his ears. \u201cThere\u2019s never a crumb left, and I...\u201d</p><p>The volume was cranked down before she could finish, the darkness returning.</p><p>No! No, he wanted to hear her words...everything she had to say....</p><p>The next time the light made an appearance, he heard, \u201cI\u2019m learning the most interesting things about you. You used to have hair, but then, one day, fairly recently, in fact, you didn\u2019t. You used to not talk very much at all. Magnus said the words had to be yanked out of you with pliers, but now you talk more than is wise. Their words, not mine. Elandra says you\u2019re fond of shopping for bras and panties. I\u2019m pretty sure she was joking.\u201d</p><p>He gritted his teeth and, with an internal roar, tore the rope binding him to all that darkness.</p><p>His eyelids flipped open.</p><p>Unlike the first time, there was no haze. He saw Nicola sitting beside him, her features smooth rather than bathed in worry as she looked down, her hair caught up and gleaming, her clothes neat and tidy. And she utterly took his breath away.</p><p>He smacked his lips together, tasting mint. She must have brushed his teeth for him. Though his arm was weak, shaky, he managed to reach up and pinch the ends of her hair. She gasped in surprise and met his gaze. He lost his breath all over again. Those eyes...a summer storm, heat rising, steaming up the flower gardens.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re awake.\u201d She leaned over him to flatten her palm against his brow. \u201cAnd your fever is gone.\u201d</p><p>The position pressed her body against his, delighting him. Then she settled back into place, ending the contact, annoying him.</p><p>\u201cHow long have I been out?\u201d he asked, a rough quality to his voice. He took stock. He was naked, a sheet draped over his middle.</p><p>\u201cThree days.\u201d</p><p>Once again, he\u2019d lost three days to his father. He remembered...fighting the Nefas and the demons, winning when the Sent Ones arrived, but not being able to flash away. Had the ability returned? He wanted to try, but didn\u2019t want to leave Nicola. More than that, he knew it would be better to wait until he was stronger. If he failed right now, just because he was weak and hadn\u2019t fully fought off the poison, he would waste precious time and energy fretting.</p><p>\u201cOh, and before I forget, Axel told me to tell you he\u2019s been taking care of your dirty little secret in the backyard.\u201d</p><p>His mother, he realized, his tension increasing.</p><p>\u201cI wanted to stay as close to your side as possible and haven\u2019t yet investigated the yard\u2014which I totally plan to do, I won\u2019t lie about that. So you might as well fess up and tell me what your dirty little secret is,\u201d she said.</p><p>He\u2019d wanted her to know. Just...not right now. He\u2019d tell her when he was stronger. \u201cNothing that concerns you,\u201d he croaked.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t trust me?\u201d A wealth of hurt in her tone.</p><p>\u201cI trust you more than I\u2019ve ever trusted another, but one has nothing to do with the other.\u201d To distract her, he said, \u201cWhat have you been doing all this time?\u201d</p><p>A moment passed. She sighed and said, \u201cI\u2019ve been taking care of you, entertaining your friends. Staying calm, happy. And guess what? Deep down, I knew you would heal. Just like me! I\u2019ve been getting stronger, too. Isn\u2019t that wonderful?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWonderful,\u201d he parroted. If she was better...</p><p>She set his hand back at his side, reached toward the nightstand and lifted a cup of water. \u201cYou talked in your sleep, you know.\u201d</p><p>He tensed, saying, \u201cAbout what?\u201d</p><p>A gleam of sadness in her eyes as she quietly said, \u201cAbout a mother who ripped out your wings and a father who tossed you into a pit of snakes. You\u2019d told me they were awful to you, but I hadn\u2019t imagined how bad.\u201d She placed the straw at his lips. \u201cDrink.\u201d</p><p>He obeyed. He didn\u2019t know what else to do. His stomach twisted, nearly rejecting the cool, sweet liquid trickling down his throat. Perhaps now was the time to tell her about his mother, after all.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t I tell you something about my past?\u201d she suggested. \u201cThat way, we\u2019ll be even.\u201d</p><p>Perhaps not. He nodded, intrigued, hungry for more information about her. Any information.</p><p>\u201cWell...several years ago, my mother, father and little brother were killed by a drunk driver.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d known that, but hearing the pain in her smoke-and-dreams voice affected him deeply.</p><p>\u201cRobby wasn\u2019t supposed to be with them that day. He was supposed to stay with me and Laila.\u201d Guilt joined the pain. \u201cBut she wanted to go out with friends, and I wanted to tag along to make sure she didn\u2019t get sick, so we convinced our parents to take him on their dinner date.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou couldn\u2019t have known.\u201d But she blamed herself, he thought, and it was a heavy burden to carry. One he wished he could lift from her shoulders. But he couldn\u2019t. Only she could. And if she didn\u2019t, if she failed, the weight would eventually crush her.</p><p>That, he knew firsthand.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s just it. I did. Deep down, like with you, I had a feeling. I knew I should keep him with me. And I think Laila knew it, too. That\u2019s why she\u2019s like she is, so determined to live in the now and not look back. She doesn\u2019t want to remember our part in Robby\u2019s death.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd neither do you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. For years we tried to pretend he never existed. It was easier, I think. But it was also a disservice to him, and he deserves better. I know that now.\u201d</p><p>That might be why Koldo had found no record of Robby in the heavenly archives. What you denied down here, you lost up there.</p><p>\u201cYou must forgive yourself. Isn\u2019t that what you told me?\u201d Koldo reached up, the actions easier now, his strength returning bit by bit, and cupped the back of her neck. He applied pressure, tugging her toward him, but for the first time in their relationship, she resisted.</p><p>\u201cI know you didn\u2019t marry that girl,\u201d she said. \u201cAxel told me. But you told tattoo guy you\u2019d have her, and you never lie.\u201d</p><p>Was she jealous? He kind of hoped so. He actually liked the idea. \u201cYou\u2019re right about my words. I said I would have her. He assumed the one I was talking about was Sirena\u2014but I was talking about you.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widened. \u201cYou want to...marry me?\u201d</p><p>Did he? No. No, he couldn\u2019t. He was tainted, he reminded himself. \u201cHaving a woman isn\u2019t the same as marrying one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d she said, her shoulders drooping.</p><p>He pulled her the rest of the way against him. She settled atop his chest, her head finding the hollow of his neck, just the way she liked. \u201cYou\u2019re disappointed?\u201d Why? And why was he happy about her reaction? Did he want her to want more from him?</p><p>\u201cMe? I\u2019m glad things worked out.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBecause I\u2019m better than your other date?\u201d</p><p>\u201cImmensely.\u201d She toyed with the end of his beard. \u201cI wish I could ask you about a last date.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo I\u2019d know how I rank.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need experience to tell you that. Simple observation proves you are the only one for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd just what have you observed?\u201d At least her tone was lighter now.</p><p>\u201cOver the centuries I\u2019ve heard many a woman tell her friends that a man has to accept her just as she is or he doesn\u2019t deserve her. But if she\u2019s a lying, cheating gossipmonger, cruel to those around her, often angry, often hateful, of course he cannot accept her. He\u2019s better off without her.\u201d</p><p>A choking little laugh left her. \u201cThat\u2019s a good point, but the same is true for men.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo...how do you know I\u2019m none of those things?\u201d</p><p>Was she serious? \u201cI\u2019ve watched you interact with your sister, always placing her needs above your own. You\u2019ve spent time with Axel, but haven\u2019t killed him\u2014a feat for anyone. And the way you are with me...kind, caring, sweet, thoughtful, helpful, considerate, compassionate, loving\u2014\u201d</p><p>She gave another laugh, saying, \u201cBasically, all of those words mean the same thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeautiful, exquisite, stunning, gorgeous, lovely, stunning, striking\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you want me, huh?\u201d she asked huskily.</p> <p>\u201cI do.\u201d So badly.</p><p>\u201cGood, because you\u2019ve got me. All of me.\u201d She lifted her head, met his gaze directly. \u201cI quit my job, and you\u2019re now my official keeper.\u201d</p><p>He liked that, too.</p><p>A lot.</p><p>\u201cWell, then, I had better start keeping you properly.\u201d He cupped her cheeks and angled her head back, his hands heating up. A shiver rocked her as he pressed a soft kiss into her lips.</p><p>Immediately she opened, welcoming him.</p><p>He kept the pressure light, relearning her, reacquainting himself with her sweetness, going slowly, trying to fortify himself against the burning flood of desire rushing through him.</p><p>This was Nicola. Every moment had to be perfect.</p> <p>But then she moaned, a heady, titillating sound, and her hands returned to his beard, and he lost the battle of gentleness versus need\u2014not that he\u2019d fought all that staunchly. He kicked the sheet away from him and rolled, half pinning her slight weight to the mattress. Her legs parted, allowing him to sink against her. Hardness to softness. Need to need.</p><p>He reached up, tore the elastic from her hair and watched as strawberry curls tumbled over the pillow, spilling around her. All he could do was stare at her. He\u2019d wanted to see her like this for so long, and now, here she was, far more beautiful than he ever could have imagined.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d she asked, shifting underneath him.</p><p>\u201cYou are...\u201d There was only one word that fit. \u201cMine. You\u2019re mine.\u201d With the claim ringing in his ears, he fed her another kiss.</p><p>She met his intensity all the way. Her hands explored his chest, his shoulders, his back, her nails scraping. \u201cSorry. Sorry,\u201d she gasped out. \u201cYou\u2019re hurt, and I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t stop.\u201d</p><p>She kissed the length of his neck. \u201c\u2019Kay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you have a special attachment to your shirt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>He ripped the material down the middle, revealing a white lace bra and soft, flat belly of the most luscious cream. A smattering of freckles dotted her skin.</p><p>He\u2019d always hated freckles. These? He thought he...loved. On Nicola, they were a road map he longed to follow, to lick his way from one to another.</p><p>\u201cThe bra?\u201d he rasped.</p><p>\u201cYou have a thing for destroying clothing, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe bra?\u201d he insisted.</p><p>\u201cGet rid of it.\u201d</p><p>He did just that, baring her to his view. And oh, the newest flood of desire to wash through him nearly undid him. His muscles shook. His bones vibrated. His soul shouted, Yes. Yes, this is the woman I was created to enjoy. The one who would lift him up, never tear him down.</p><p>He could only drink her in, every one of his senses humming a lullaby he\u2019d never heard. The intoxicating song surrounded him, caressed him, owned him. He was lured, not to a place of slumber but to a place of shattering change.</p><p>He would never be the same.</p><p>The cinnamon and vanilla that was so much a part of Nicola clung to him, embedding in his pores. She branded him with her very own essentia\u2014he was hers. A half to a whole.</p><p>Those stormy eyes watched him, glassed with a hunger-charged yearning. Light trickled over her, complementing pleasure-flushed skin.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re staring at me,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d Then, \u201cNo. I\u2019m not sorry. I like doing it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, then, I\u2019m glad.\u201d</p><p>He couldn\u2019t hold in his next words. \u201cI want to be with you, Nicola.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want that, too.\u201d</p><p>He moved the back of his hand along the length of her neck, soft, light. \u201cI\u2019ll be careful.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head, all that fiery hair dancing over the pillow. \u201cI don\u2019t want careful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut that\u2019s what you\u2019ll get.\u201d And he would make sure she liked it. Whatever he had to do.</p><p>He explored her, and every new point of contact sent him deeper and deeper into a pool of need, until he was drowning, desperate. But he knew, in the depths of his core, that his every action was a declaration of his feelings for her. She was someone of value. She was someone worth saving. She was the woman he wanted at his side. Everything he\u2019d needed, nothing he\u2019d known.</p><p>He stripped her of the rest of her clothes, marveling at every new revelation of this woman who had so captivated him, and spread his essentia all over her, leaving no inch untouched, causing all that flushed skin to glow so much more brightly.</p><p>\u201cKoldo,\u201d she breathed. \u201cI feel so hot...burning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the essentia, sweet Nicola.\u201d</p><p>She looked him over, saying, \u201cFlawless,\u201d before closing her eyes and moaning. \u201cEssentia?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA powder my body produces just for you.\u201d The tension inside him expanded...and he no longer wanted, he realized\u2014he needed. Every muscle he possessed was clenching on bone. His blood was molten in his veins.</p><p>\u201cOh. That\u2019s nice.\u201d</p><p>Nice?</p><p>But then she was gasping, writhing atop the mattress, and he was gasping out word after word of approval and praise, a deluge he\u2019d kept trapped inside far too long. They clutched at each other and they kneaded at each other and he could feel the fast beat of her heart as they kissed each other desperately. A beat that was faster and faster with every moment that passed, as if she neared the edge of a ledge.</p><p>\u201cKoldo,\u201d she said on a moan.</p><p>Such a heady entreaty. Nearly more than he could bear. \u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need, too.\u201d But his concern for her well-being suddenly overshadowed everything else. He wouldn\u2019t take her, no matter what she said and no matter what he felt. Not until she was ready for him.</p><p>No matter how desperate he was, her health was more important, and nothing would change that. Because he didn\u2019t want to take from her, he realized. He wanted to share with her. And it would be difficult to stay this course, he knew. All his life, he\u2019d been denied the things so many others took for granted. Acceptance, softness. Affection. He finally had them. And now he had to wait for them, when they were so freely offered?</p><p>\u201cNicola,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cKoldo,\u201d she moaned.</p><p>\u201cOne day we\u2019ll be together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Today. Now. We already said so.\u201d</p><p>Sweet mercy. \u201cNo. There\u2019s been a change of plans.\u201d</p><p>Her hands tightened on him, her nails digging into his back. \u201cI can take it. I can!\u201d</p><p>Maybe. Maybe not. But he couldn\u2019t. The thought of hurting her, even in so small a way, destroyed him. If ever he gave her reason to look back and think of him with disappointment, regret or anger, he would willingly fall on his own sword.</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t...continue like...this,\u201d she said. \u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>Never beg, he wanted to say. But he liked it too much to stop her from doing it again.</p><p>\u201cPleeease.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll help you with these feelings.\u201d Somehow. Someway. Though he lacked experience, he touched her here, there, seemingly everywhere at once, but it was never enough, not for him, yet she began crying out, gasping so hard, straining against him, begging, begging, begging for more.</p><p>The pressure inside him increased. It reminded him of the times he\u2019d gone to his cave and exploded, the rage too much for his body to contain. But this wasn\u2019t rage. This was raw, animal hunger. She was just so exquisite to watch, her eyes closed, her lashes casting spiky shadows over her cheeks, her lips red and plump, her scent intensifying, the fragrance of her honey eclipsing all that cinnamon and vanilla, and his mouth watered, and his insides...his insides...shattered.</p><p>And then she was shouting his name. And he was roaring at an exquisite agony that consumed him, utterly stunned, gasping, sweating, perhaps even babbling.</p><p>Yes, babbling.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened? That was... I can\u2019t describe... I\u2019ve never... What we just did... Did you feel that... How could...\u201d The realization left a film of embarrassment and a desire to flee, but he remained in place.</p><p>Nicola was hugging him.</p><p>He collapsed on the mattress. He was shaking, and...smiling despite his emotions. \u201cDid you experience what I experienced?\u201d Finally. A coherent sentence.</p><p>\u201cYes, and I didn\u2019t pass out,\u201d she said with a smile of her own.</p><p>\u201cNeither did I.\u201d He hadn\u2019t lost control, hadn\u2019t taken what he shouldn\u2019t. Had stayed the course and taken another step on the path to claiming her. He had given her pleasure, and had, apparently, taken his own.</p><p>Soon, he told himself. Very soon, he would take the next step\u2014take her fully. And they would fall off the ledge together. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>CHAPTER TWENTY-SIX</p><p>AS THE DEMON SCREAMED in pain, Thane removed the horns on its head.</p><p>As the demon cried and sobbed, Thane plucked out its eyes.</p> <p>As the demon mewled, Thane peeled away huge hunks of the creature\u2019s flesh.</p><p>Black blood ran down his arms in tiny rivulets, stinging, leaving welts. The scent of sulfur coated the air. At his sides, the walls to the cavern dripped with bodily fluids from the other victims. At his feet was a pile of organs he\u2019d removed.</p><p>\u201cIf you refuse to talk,\u201d he said, \u201cI\u2019ll remove your tongue before I kill you.\u201d</p><p>The creature babbled, but all Thane heard was, \u201cBlah, blah, blah, please. Blah, blah, blah, better than me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think you\u2019re better than me?\u201d he lashed out. \u201cOr that I\u2019m not any better than you?\u201d Either way...</p> <p>Giving in to the rage, Thane sawed at the demon\u2019s tongue, as promised. But that wasn\u2019t violent enough, and he ended up sawing through the creature\u2019s throat. The body slumped against the chains binding it.</p><p>Perhaps the next one would be\u2014 There was no next one, he realized. He\u2019d killed them all.</p><p>He scrubbed a blood-soaked hand through his hair.</p><p>He had arrived in Auckland two days ago, tracked a path of evil to the slums and found a group of homeless men and women that had turned on each other. They\u2019d fought over the rights to a trash can, killed each other by sheer physical brutality, and the only survivor had then turned on the patrons of a nearby coffee shop, slaying three innocents before the cops arrived and gunned him down.</p><p>Thane had shown up as the remaining patrons were being questioned. Two had displayed tempers that hadn\u2019t fit the situation, and he\u2019d ended up following the worst offender to an office building. The male had yelled at everyone he encountered, and the employees had huddled around the watercooler to discuss how odd his behavior was.</p><p>That was when Thane realized the truth. Demons of strife were here, infecting humans. Probably obeying their leader\u2014one of the six that had killed Germanus.</p> <p>So, Thane had gone out, hunting the minions. Within half an hour, he\u2019d found eleven, roaming the streets like hungry lions searching for gimpy prey. He\u2019d initiated battle and immediately killed two. One had gotten away. The other three he\u2019d managed to injure so severely that they weren\u2019t able to run. He\u2019d scooped them up and brought them back here, to his cave.</p><p>He\u2019d spent the past few hours doing things that had once been done to his friends. Terrible things. Horrendous things. The only things that brought Thane any measure of peace. But no matter what he\u2019d done, he\u2019d gotten no answers.</p><p>Where was the leader?</p><p>Frustrated, he flew up, up, up to the opening of the cavern, then flattened out to dart through the narrow passage. Light spilled inside, chasing away the darkness and showing the way to the surrounding forest. Within minutes, he was outside, in the air, soaring above the rushing river, the tall, lush trees and the snowcapped mountains.</p><p>The scent of sulfur dissipated and the crimson stain of blood vanished from him, his robe cleaning itself as well as his body. The heat dropped off him like a winter cloak, cool air slapping against him. But nothing could wash away the feel of defeat.</p><p>A rustle sounded behind him.</p><p>He summoned his sword of fire as he turned\u2014but there was no one there. The sun was in the process of setting, casting rays of pink and purple, the sky a darkening blue. The clouds were thick and white, the stars just becoming visible. He hovered in the sky, wings lifting and falling slowly, gracefully, his gaze tracking the surrounding area. But...again, he found no one.</p><p>\u201cCome out, coward,\u201d he commanded. \u201cFight me.\u201d</p> <p>Silence.</p><p>Irritated, he darted higher at top speed. Then, he leveled out and searched the clouds for any sign of movement. To his right he heard a whoosh.... He frowned. What was that? Whatever it was, the sound of laughter quickly followed. He changed course, only to find four winged warriors playing ball in the clouds. One threw the ball, while another tried to stop him. One caught the ball, while another tried to stop him.</p><p>Football. In the skies. Who would ever have thought? But...how happy they appeared. How content.</p><p>They weren\u2019t part of Zacharel\u2019s army, but Lysander\u2019s. Thane recognized one of the males. Brendon was his name, and he had frequented Thane\u2019s club on many occasions.</p><p>Thane stopped, hovering in the air some yards away. Perhaps they had heard something about the highly ranked demon that he had not. He called out a greeting.</p><p>The game paused, and all four looked over at him. At first, they smiled. But those smiles quickly faded as his identity was discerned.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re part of the Army of Disgrace,\u201d one said.</p><p>Thane was beginning to despise that name. \u201cI am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d another snapped. \u201cThis is our territory.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour kind isn\u2019t wanted,\u201d Brendon said, peering down at his feet.</p><p>The fourth remained silent, but his glare spoke volumes.</p><p>Judgment and disdain, from his own kind, when they had no idea what had shaped him into the man he was. They had no idea what he\u2019d had to do to survive. They had no idea the pain and guilt and shame that constantly stalked his every step\u2014even though he told himself he enjoyed his life, that he liked what he was. And he did.</p><p>He did. Because he had to.</p><p>The four closed in around him, forming a circle, blocking him in. He could have mentioned Brendon\u2019s own proclivities and called him a hypocrite, and the others would have believed him. Like all Sent Ones, his voice possessed the ring of truth. But he remained silent. He had many, many faults, but he would never ruin another man\u2019s standing with his friends.</p><p>He knew how important those friends could be.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t want to fight me,\u201d he stated calmly.</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah?\u201d The leader raised his chin, all aggression and assurance of success. \u201cAnd why\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have no honor, and you won\u2019t like what I do to you.\u201d To prove it, he kicked out his leg, nailing the leader in the stomach and making him hunch over for breath. At the same time, he twisted his upper body and, grabbing a sword from the air pocket at his right, swung out. He clipped the bottom of one of Brendon\u2019s wings.</p><p>The warrior dropped from the sky, forcing the others to dart after him to prevent him from ultimately going splat. Thane wanted to laugh, but couldn\u2019t force a rise of amusement. He hated that he only received respect inside his club. He hated that everyone outside it mocked him, and drove him to such violent behavior.</p><p>As if he needed to be driven.</p><p>They\u2019re better than you. They can do whatever they want. He couldn\u2019t even remember what it was like to be untainted by the evils of life.</p><p>Whatever. He sped back into motion.</p><p>Any luck? he projected into Bjorn\u2019s head. They were bonded so surely, so solidly, distance never mattered.</p><p>None. You?</p><p>None.</p><p>Any luck? he projected into Xerxes\u2019 head.</p><p>Yes. Bad. You?</p><p>The same.</p><p>He had to find and stop Strife before any other human lives were ruined. Unlike some of his brethren, he understood the humans. He sympathized with their weaknesses. He wanted to protect them from the very pain he had endured.</p><p>Thane increased his speed. He needed to figure out his next plan of action. To clear his head. To think. Sex was his usual method, but he was used to finding his women in the club. They knew a little about him, what he expected, and he knew they were already on the road to ruination. He didn\u2019t have to worry about destroying their innocence.</p><p>But he didn\u2019t have time to fly to the club and fly back here. He would have to risk going to a human club, then. Yes, he decided. He would go to a human club. He would find a woman, the wildest one, have her and figure this out. Surely.</p><p>CHAPTER TWENTY-SEVEN</p><p>\u201c\u2014CAN\u2019T FLASH,\u201d Nicola heard Koldo say, his voice dripping with all kinds of rage. \u201cYou have to continue the hunt on your own.\u201d</p><p>He couldn\u2019t flash? She\u2019d just turned the corner into the kitchen, where the men were located, but hearing him say that, she froze in the doorway.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t mind doing that,\u201d Axel replied. \u201cBut I gotta tell you. I\u2019m getting nowhere. Your father leaves zero tracks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s been planning this a long time. Before approaching us, he would have come up with a way to avoid detection.\u201d</p><p>Neither man noticed her. They sat at the table. And how odd they looked. Two primal warriors, seated so domestically at a hand-carved table, white-and-black-checkered curtains covering the bay window behind them.</p><p>\u201cBut he\u2019s not smarter than me,\u201d Axel said. \u201cOr is it \u2018than I\u2019? I always forget. Anyway. I\u2019ll find a way to draw him out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHungry?\u201d she asked, finally earning their notice.</p><p>Axel squared his shoulders, at attention. Koldo raked a hand over his scalp, as if he were embarrassed. How adorable.</p><p>They were wearing identical white tops and pants, the material loose, and they both looked adorable. Like best friends who had made a pact to always do everything together\u2014even dress.</p><p>Say that aloud. I dare you. \u201cWell?\u201d she prompted.</p><p>\u201cWe can feed ourselves,\u201d Koldo said at the same time Axel said, \u201cI\u2019m ravenous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, my answer matches Axel\u2019s,\u201d she said. \u201cTherefore, I\u2019ll make something.\u201d These past few days she\u2019d spent a lot of time puttering around in the kitchen, trying new recipes brought to her by Koldo\u2019s friends, and it had been wonderful. She\u2019d discovered a blooming talent she hadn\u2019t expected. Lack of time and money had never allowed her the luxury of even trying.</p><p>Axel smirked. Koldo scowled. She gathered dishes and cutlery and the appropriate ingredients for an avocado-and-strawberry salad, and all the while she could feel Koldo\u2019s gaze on her, two white-hot pings drilling into her back.</p><p>Was he thinking about last night?</p><p>She was. With every glance, every touch, she\u2019d felt the depths of their connection. Something deep, inexorable.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to hire you at my place, Miz Nicola,\u201d Axel said. \u201cI have a benefits package I know you\u2019ll love.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>A shuffle of clothing, the squeak of a chair. The pound of bone against bone.</p><p>Nicola turned and watched as the two men slammed together and propelled to the ground.</p><p>A growl from Koldo. \u201cShe\u2019s mine!\u201d</p> <p>A laugh from Axel. \u201cAnd I can\u2019t tease you about her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChildren! Enough,\u201d Nicola said, clapping to claim their attention.</p><p>They broke apart, Koldo huffing and puffing, Axel grinning.</p><p>\u201cYour jealousy is so cute,\u201d Axel said.</p> <p>\u201cJust try to leave me,\u201d Koldo threw at Nicola.</p><p>I won\u2019t roll my eyes. \u201cSit.\u201d</p><p>Instantly the men obeyed, reclaiming their chairs at the table.</p><p>She tossed all of the ingredients in a large bowl, then set smaller bowls in front of the guys. When she attempted to ease into the seat between them, Koldo took her by the arm and tugged her onto his lap. The warmth of his body and the sunshine scent of his skin instantly enveloped her, holding her captive.</p><p>He glared at Axel.</p><p>Axel grinned.</p> <p>\u201cSo...you can\u2019t flash,\u201d she said to Koldo.</p><p>He stiffened. \u201cNo. I tried again this morning. I failed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething was done to me during that last fight.\u201d Koldo finished his meal in a hurry, stood, moved aside and urged her back into the chair. \u201cStay here. Eat.\u201d He gave her a swift, hard kiss and tugged Axel from the room.</p><p>\u201cBut I\u2019m not done with my food,\u201d she heard the black-haired warrior whine.</p><p>\u201cYou are now.\u201d</p><p>The back door slammed behind them, cutting off any reply.</p><p>What am I going to do with that man?</p> <p>She padded to the window and watched as he led Axel inside the small building they\u2019d erected last week. Was Koldo\u2019s dirty little secret in there? If so...what could it be? Another woman?</p><p>No, he wasn\u2019t the type to cheat. He had far too much honor.</p><p>Refusing to dwell, she fixed Laila a bowl, rinsed the rest of the dishes and placed them in the washer, then strode to her sister\u2019s bedroom. Her twin was pacing in front of the bed, her hands wringing together.</p><p>\u201cI made brunch,\u201d Nicola told her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not hungry.\u201d Laila\u2019s skin was pale, her motions stiff.</p><p>\u201cWell, you need to eat.\u201d</p><p>There was a tinge of desperation to her sister\u2019s tone as she said, \u201cWe were almost killed, Co Co.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut we weren\u2019t. We survived.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if we\u2019re attacked again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if we\u2019re not? You shouldn\u2019t worry about what\u2019s going to happen, La La, but you should expect to be protected when something does.\u201d So far, her sister had wanted nothing to do with Koldo, the tattoos or anything he\u2019d said\u2014despite knowing he was right!</p><p>\u201cYou really believe that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I want to be like you. I do. I just... I have trouble trusting it all. I mean, staring at a bunch of number tattoos is going to help me? Please!\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrust is a decision, not a feeling.\u201d Just like forgiveness. \u201cGive it a shot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just... I\u2019m sorry. No. I can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Nicola could have curled into a ball and cried. But instead, she rallied, determined. \u201cYou\u2019ll continue to worry and that worry will kill you. Is that what you want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Her sister\u2019s shoulders drooped.</p><p>Nicola reached out, squeezed her hand. \u201cLet\u2019s do something to distract you.\u201d Something to improve her frame of mind. Books wouldn\u2019t cut it, and TV might exacerbate the problem. All that left was... Ugh. Something that sounded like torture. \u201cWe can, I don\u2019t know, work out or something. Get our bodies in shape.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease. For me.\u201d</p><p>Laila massaged the back of her neck. \u201cI\u2019m not in the mood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeither am I, but we could both use the exercise.\u201d Before her sister could issue another refusal, she added, \u201cI\u2019ll be in the workout room. Join me, okay?\u201d</p><p>A pause, a sigh, then, \u201cOkay. Maybe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDefinitely.\u201d Nicola clomped into her bedroom and changed into a sports bra, tiny skintight shorts and running shoes. Her first pair. Well, the first pair she would actually put to use.</p><p>She entered the workout room and looked around. Machine after machine greeted her. All large. All intimidating. The only piece of equipment she recognized was the treadmill.</p><p>That would have to do.</p><p>Nicola set a slow pace\u2014at first. But the sweat began to roll, and her heart began to pound, her muscles to burn, and she liked it, so she raised the incline and kicked up the speed. Soon she was jogging. And jogging and jogging! Shock filled her, but the exercise felt so good, too good to stop, invigorating her, and she thought she could go on forever, and that if she were outside, she could run across the entire world. There was so much oxygen in her brain, her thoughts were actually fizzing, her blood popping and crackling and her ponytail swinging back and forth, slapping her in the face, and oh, even that felt good, because she was free and she was healthy and nothing could stop her, and\u2014</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m pleased.\u201d</p><p>Her attention jerked to the left. Koldo stood in the doorway, his expression satisfied, his hands fisted on his hips. The action jolted her, and she missed her next step. The treadmill was unforgiving, and she stumbled, flying backward and slamming\u2014</p><p>Into Koldo.</p><p>His body was big and hard, and she lost her breath\u2014breath that had already gone thin and raspy. Suddenly light-headed, she hunched over. Or would have. Koldo\u2019s arms banded around her, holding her upright.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he said. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to startle you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it,\u201d she wheezed. And okay, wow, the workout had affected her more than she\u2019d realized. \u201cYou should probably let me go. I\u2019m sweaty.\u201d</p><p>His pupils expanded, gobbling up the golden color of his irises. \u201cI like you that way.\u201d</p><p>The huskiness of his tone... \u201cAre you flirting with me?\u201d</p><p>He blinked with surprise. \u201cI think that I am.\u201d</p><p>The world spun\u2014but not because she was feeling faint. Koldo had taken her by the waist and maneuvered her around to face him. She teetered forward, and had to balance her palms on his chest. His heart beat as hard and fast as hers.</p><p>\u201cIs it working?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProve it.\u201d</p><p>He hoisted her up. Her legs wrapped around him as he lowered his head. Their mouths met in an explosive kiss that offered no preliminary exploration, only passion.</p><p>Just like that, she was a study of movement, her hands on his face, no, on his neck, no, kneading his shoulders, her nails digging into his skin. It was such a beautiful moment, so charged, two pieces of a puzzle being fit together.</p><p>Desire burned through her, and need, so much need. Want, so much want. As if she hadn\u2019t found satisfaction last night. The two drives were intertwined, indistinguishable, as tangible as Koldo\u2019s body.</p><p>\u201cI have to have you,\u201d he said. \u201cAll of you. If you\u2019re well enough to run the treadmill, you\u2019re well enough to be with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere. Now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYessss.\u201d This was happening. Finally. They would be together, and they would belong to each other, and they would stop worrying about what could go wrong\u2014even though they weren\u2019t supposed to be worrying about anything.</p><p>\u201cUh, that\u2019s going to be a bit of a problem,\u201d another male said.</p><p>Growling, Koldo swung his head toward the door. Nicola followed his lead. A grinning Axel stood next to another male of equal strength. This one had black hair and blazing green eyes that utterly contrasted with his lips, which were set in an ice-cold line.</p><p>\u201cZacharel,\u201d Koldo said, nodding his head in stiff deference. To Nicola, he added quietly, \u201cHe always looks that way. Fear not.\u201d</p><p>Nicola\u2019s legs dropped to the floor. Her heart was hammering, but the beat was now steady, strong. Her clothes were in place, nothing disheveled, and yet she felt as though she were a teenager caught with her pants down.</p><p>The new guy looked her over. \u201cYou\u2019re thriving. That\u2019s good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know me?\u201d she asked, surprised and confused. She\u2019d never met this man. He wasn\u2019t the type of guy a girl would ever forget. No, he was the type of guy a girl dreamed about for the rest of her life\u2014either sighing dreamily or sobbing with fear.</p><p>\u201cI noticed a certain warrior\u2019s interest in you, and made it my business to learn everything possible.\u201d That glorious jade gaze slid to Koldo before she could comment. Not that she knew what to say. \u201cYour presence has been requested in the heavens.\u201d</p><p>A tense pause slid into a long, uncomfortable silence before Koldo gave another nod.</p><p>Axel and Zacharel walked away, leaving her alone with her warrior.</p><p>\u201cI must go,\u201d he said.</p><p>She reached up and cupped his cheeks, the soft hair on his jaw tickling her skin. \u201cI understand. Just make sure you hurry home. I\u2019ll still be here, and we can pick up where we left off.\u201d</p><p>He leaned down, placed a soft kiss against her lips. \u201cYou\u2019ve just guaranteed I\u2019ll return at the soonest possible moment. And don\u2019t worry about evil invaders. Axel ensured other Sent Ones can come and go, but no one else can get through my cloud.\u201d</p><p>A second later, he vanished, startling Nicola. Then he reappeared, a look of wonder on his face.</p><p>\u201cI flashed,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI know. I just watched you.\u201d He hadn\u2019t lost the ability, after all.</p><p>\u201cBut I did it twice. Not just now, but before, to catch you when you fell off the treadmill. I was too consumed with what we were doing to realize I had done it until I appeared in the heavens.\u201d</p><p>His lips lifted in a slow, sensual smile, revealing perfect white teeth, lighting his entire face. She could only stare in amazement, her head practically spinning, her limbs definitely shaking. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI can protect you,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI knew that, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not helpless.\u201d</p> <p>Hoping to tease him, she said, \u201cAre we playing the Obvious Game? If so, guess what. I can run on a treadmill. I can wear my hair in a ponytail. I\u2019m a girl.\u201d</p><p>Laughing, he placed another kiss on her mouth. And then, for the second time that day, he flashed away. This time, she reeled. That laugh...it had been rusty, but hearty. Ragged, but gorgeous.</p><p>Would she ever get used to his magnetism?</p><p>Nicola snagged a glass of water before heading into her sister\u2019s bedroom, where she found Laila pacing. Still.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t come to the workout room,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cSorry, sorry,\u201d Laila replied. \u201cI lost track of time.\u201d</p><p>Nicola opened her mouth to respond\u2014but caught sight of two little monkey faces peeking over Laila\u2019s shoulders. They spotted Nicola and grinned smugly.</p><p>She strode forward, but they ducked down. Laila seemed to have no idea. Nicola walked a circle around her, searching, but there was no longer any sign of the creatures.</p><p>A sense of urgency hit her. \u201cPick something to do, La La. Anything at all. I\u2019ll do it with you. The constant anxiety has to end now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just... I need to think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout what?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cEverything! We\u2019re so weak, Nicola. Both of us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m stronger every day, and you could be, too. I mean, we\u2019re on the winning team. We have warriors fighting for us. We have the power and protection of the Most High.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou say that, but....\u201d Laila scrubbed at her face. \u201cWhat if He doesn\u2019t respond next time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow can you be so sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just know it, deep inside.\u201d Somehow, Nicola maneuvered her sister into the bed and tucked the covers around her. \u201cIf you won\u2019t do something with me, I want you to rest and give your mind a break. And if you insist on thinking about anything, think about everything I\u2019ve said. It\u2019s the truth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPromise?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPromise.\u201d Laila closed her eyes, and Nicola stroked her face the way their mother used to do to them. At first, her sister\u2019s expression was pinched, her body restless, unable to settle. But as one minute drifted into another, she settled down. When her breathing finally evened out, Nicola stood and strode to her own room.</p><p>She showered and dressed in a pink tee and jeans, wanting to look her best when Koldo returned\u2014and give him a few new pieces of clothing to rip off her. But she waited...and waited...and he never showed up.</p><p>After a while, the rays of sunlight seeping from the windows lulled her into the backyard. The air was warm, perfect and scented with wildflowers, citrus and pine. She breathed deeply, savoring.</p><p>Bang. Bang.</p><p>A muffled female voice rang out. Frowning, Nicola hurried to the little shack Koldo and Axel had built. There were no windows, and seemed to be no doorway.</p><p>\u201cHelp me. Please.\u201d</p><p>There was the voice again, clearer this time\u2014coming from inside the shack. Her tone was...pure. Strong. Enough to give Nicola chills. It was a purity she recognized, since both Axel and the one named Zacharel possessed it.</p><p>Was this female a Sent One? The lover Nicola had been so certain Koldo didn\u2019t have?</p><p>\u201cWho are you?\u201d she called, palpating the walls for any kind of seam.</p><p>\u201cHelp me. Please! Let me out.\u201d</p><p>Why had Koldo placed the woman in the shack? He wasn\u2019t a cruel man. Was he?</p><p>Nicola stilled, her mind whirling. He was a man who had never hurt her\u2014had even beat the man who had. He was a man who had despaired over the fact that he might not be able to protect her. He was a man who made her feel safe in his arms.</p><p>He was a man she trusted.</p><p>But she didn\u2019t know or trust the woman.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Once again the woman ignored her question, saying, \u201cJust let me out. All right? Yes?\u201d</p><p>The desperation was warranted. The evasion was not. Could she be a serial killer? Or working with the demons?</p><p>\u201cLet me out!\u201d Fists banged into the wall. \u201cNow!\u201d</p><p>Nicola nibbled on her bottom lip...and backed away.</p><p>CHAPTER TWENTY-EIGHT</p><p>KOLDO WATCHED as Zacharel landed at the edge of Germanus\u2019s cloud\u2014no, Clerici was the owner now.</p><p>Golden wings tucked into the warrior\u2019s back, and an unexpected pang of envy hit Koldo\u2014as always. He had to stop feeling this way, but oh, what could have been. He wasn\u2019t someone who believed everything happened for a reason. Bad things happened because people had free will.</p><p>Of course, he did believe something bad could be worked to a person\u2019s good. The loss of his wings, however? He couldn\u2019t imagine anything good ever coming from that.</p><p>And the loss of his ability to flash? No. Nothing good could have come from that, either. How would he have traveled? How would he have survived? He was grateful he had healed.</p><p>Either Sirena\u2019s poison had faded on its own, or his joy at being with Nicola had helped him overcome it. Probably the latter. Every day he was tied a little more firmly to the delicate human. Needed her a little more fiercely.</p><p>Zacharel flowed into motion, saying, \u201cClerici wishes to meet you.\u201d</p><p>Koldo kept pace with him, boots thudding against the cobbles that formed a path through the cloud to the temple\u2019s dais. Flowers bloomed at each side, rivers as clear as crystals winding throughout. The sky was a bright blue, the sun throwing rays of gold and orange and twining them like ribbons.</p><p>\u201cYou knew I wanted Nicola before you assigned me to guard her,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cYes. But you\u2019ve known that for a while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have. What I haven\u2019t been able to figure out is how you knew.\u201d</p><p>Never one to reveal a sense of being uncomfortable, Zacharel shrugged as if he hadn\u2019t a care. \u201cThe Most High opened my mind to a vision. I watched you return to the hospital. I listened to you speak to the girl in the elevator.\u201d</p><p>Koldo didn\u2019t mind having visions about others. But others having visions about him?</p><p>\u201cHe wants you happy,\u201d Zacharel added.</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d But did he really believe it? After everything Koldo had done... \u201cIs that why you placed Jamila at her office?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. I wanted her well guarded while you were away. You were so unstable, Koldo. You know you were. You were a bomb too close to detonation, and everyone in your path would have felt the sting of your explosion. The girl has calmed you, and I\u2019m glad for it.\u201d Zacharel patted his shoulder.</p><p>Blue-winged angels pushed open the double doors.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll leave you to your meeting now,\u201d Zacharel said.</p><p>\u201cVery well. And thank you.\u201d Koldo stalked inside the building, his footsteps echoing. The corridor was empty. Before, it had been lined with antique furniture, and always burst at the seams with Sent Ones, movement and chatter. The demons must have defiled the furniture, and the Sent Ones must be waiting for a summons.</p><p>A summons Germanus should have been the one to make.</p><p>Hands fisting, Koldo stalked down the hall. The doors to the throne room were guarded by another set of angels and were already pushed open. Koldo passed, silent, and entered, noting that the walls were now bare, the murals of the Most High\u2019s realm of the heavens painted over.</p><p>Had they been defaced?</p><p>He should be out there, hunting the culprits. Instead, he was playing naughty cat and recovering mouse with his father.</p><p>\u201cAt last I meet the famous Koldo.\u201d</p><p>The deep voice came from the right, and Koldo turned. Clerici perched on the middle step of the dais, polishing a sword. He wore a flowing white T-shirt and pants, just as Koldo preferred. There was dirt on his hands, as well as his middle and calves.</p><p>Where Germanus had appeared aged, Clerici appeared young, even for their kind. He looked to be a mere twenty years old, with brown hair, brown eyes and an unassuming face. Plain, to be honest. But there was something about him that arrested Koldo\u2019s attention. A magnetism. A gleam of...love, perhaps, shining brightly in those dark depths.</p><p>And like Koldo, he was without wings.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not what you expected, I know,\u201d Clerici said, running a rag over the length of a weapon.</p><p>\u201cI hadn\u2019t given you any thought.\u201d</p><p>A nod of that dark head. \u201cBrutal honesty. I like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou receive that from all of us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, but you aren\u2019t bound by the ring of truth. You offer it willingly.\u201d</p><p>A defect all Sent Ones could sense in him. \u201cYou have an assignment for me?\u201d</p><p>Clerici set the blade aside and looked up. \u201cNot currently, no.\u201d</p><p>Confused, he said, \u201cWhy not?\u201d He\u2019d thought that was why he was here.</p><p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t ready.\u201d</p><p>A lie, surely! \u201cHow do you know that?\u201d he gritted out. He was a first-round pick, and that was that.</p><p>The new king of the Sent Ones offered a half smile and tapped the center of his chest. His heart. \u201cI just do.\u201d</p><p>And I\u2019m now brewing a rage just for you. \u201cI\u2019m strong, capable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. You\u2019re enslaved by your emotions.\u201d</p><p>He popped his jaw. He wouldn\u2019t discuss his mother. Not with this stranger. And he knew that\u2019s where the male was headed. \u201cWhy did you summon me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps I wished to welcome you to my fold.\u201d Clerici\u2019s head tilted to the side, and he perused Koldo with the same intensity he\u2019d received. \u201cPerhaps I wished to ask you if you miss your wings.\u201d</p><p>More than anything else in the world, but all he said was, \u201cDo you miss yours?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho says I ever had a pair?\u201d Clerici stood and closed the distance between them, and it was then that Koldo felt the power crackling from his skin, lightning strikes against his own, burning him from the outside in.</p><p>\u201cDid you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, but that information isn\u2019t yours to collect, is it?\u201d</p><p>Privacy. That, Koldo understood and respected. He shook his head. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAnd now, on to our business,\u201d Clerici said. \u201cI offered each of the Elite Seven a reward for their dedicated service to Germanus. I expected requests for riches, clouds and other tangible items. But every warrior astonished me, I must say. And your Zacharel most of all.\u201d</p><p>There was no time to reply.</p><p>\u201cI have a gift for you,\u201d Clerici added. He lightly placed his hands on Koldo\u2019s shoulders, but then, strength wasn\u2019t needed. At the moment of contact, a warm cascade of honey began to wash over Koldo, bathing him, empowering him. \u201cNot because you deserve it. You don\u2019t. Unlike the Merciful One, the Anointed One and the Mighty One, I cannot see into your heart and know the good you are capable of. Unless the Most High informs me otherwise, I can see only your actions. But Zacharel named you as the recipient of his reward, and I promised to deliver it.\u201d</p> <p>But...why would Zacharel do such a thing?</p><p>Dark eyes pierced deep. \u201cRight now, Koldo, you are filled with so much hate there\u2019s no room for love. I can feel it. And without love...well, you\u2019ll fall, and Zacharel has no desire to see you fall.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSilence.\u201d</p><p>A simple command from the king, but one Koldo could not refute. His lips felt glued together as he nodded.</p> <p>\u201cThe mouth can be a snare,\u201d Clerici added more gently. \u201cSometimes it\u2019s better not to say anything at all.\u201d</p><p>He knew that very well. He gave another nod.</p><p>\u201cDo you know what Zacharel asked me to give you?\u201d Clerici asked.</p><p>Before Koldo could guess at the answer, pain shot through his entire body. Pain like he had not endured even in his father\u2019s camp, when he was hung from the ceiling by hooks embedded in the muscles in his chest, each of the Nefas warriors allowed to strike him once, with the weapon of their choice.</p><p>His knees buckled, and he hit the ground with a hard thump. The shirt was ripped from his body, though no one touched him, the material floating to the floor. A sharp, agonizing lance bowed his back, and he fell the rest of the way forward. His chin slammed against the marble, the taste of copper coating his tongue.</p><p>A shout pounded against his teeth, split his lips apart. What had Clerici done to him? There was no way he could survive this. It was too much...it was...fading? Yes. Yes, it was, the pain ending as abruptly as it had begun. Panting and sweating, Koldo lumbered to his feet. Clerici was nowhere to be seen, and there was a heavy weight at his back, as if two warriors had jumped on him and refused to let go.</p> <p>He reached back\u2014and encountered the soft graze of feathers.</p><p>Heart slamming against his ribs, he jerked whatever he held forward. White feathers veined in gold greeted his eyes, the tendons thick, strong and unscarred. He lost his breath, again fell to his knees. He gave another tug, but the appendage remained attached to him, pulling tight, creating the most wondrous pain.</p><p>Wings. He had wings.</p><p>His mind reeled as he pushed to his feet. \u201cThank you. Thank you!\u201d</p><p>He walked toward the door, dazed, but the moment he cleared the entrance he picked up speed. Soon he was running, bypassing the second set of doors, outside, racing along the cobbled pathway, hitting the edge of the cloud\u2014</p><p>Falling.</p><p>Koldo spread the wings and they caught in a current, evening out his glide. He threw back his head and laughed with undiluted joy. He was flying! Up, down, up, down, flapped the wings. No, not \u201cthe\u201d wings. His wings. His. They belonged to him. And no one would be able to take them away from him.</p><p>The wind whipped against his skin, his feathers. He shot as high as he could go, the air growing colder. He dived low to the ground, the air heating, before twisting his body and shooting back up. Clouds dusted over him, cool and moist, and birds flew beside him. He performed flips, laughing all the while.</p> <p>Never had he been so carefree.</p><p>What would Nicola think when she saw him? He imagined her at home, in their room, on the bed, waiting for him. She would smile, and she would gasp. She would exalt over the beauty of his wings. And why not? His feathers were the purest shade of white and threaded by the most beautiful rivers of molten gold.</p><p>She would be the first person to touch them.</p><p>He flew until the forgotten muscles in his back burned from the strain, unable to take much more. Until his wings seized, refusing to move another inch, and he began to plummet. Just before landing, he flashed to the front yard of his ranch. He hit with more force than he was used to, and had to roll with the impact. Dirt and grass tangled in his beard, clothing and feathers.</p><p>The moment he stilled, he popped up and ran inside. There was no sign of Zacharel, no sign of Axel. Laila was asleep in her room. He burst through the door of Nicola\u2019s bedroom. She sat at the edge of the bed, and jumped up when she spotted him. She was...upset.</p><p>He lost his grin, his excitement. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? Did something happen?\u201d</p><p>She blinked, her gaze zeroing in on his wings. \u201cWe\u2019ll get to that. First, how...?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re not hurt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot physically, no.\u201d</p><p>The excitement returned and he spun. \u201cThe wings were a gift.\u201d Pleasure filled him as he clasped the ends of the wings and stretched them to their full length. \u201cTouch them. They\u2019re real.\u201d</p><p>She reached out, her fingertips brushing the arch, flowing down the center. He closed his eyes and savored. Even as a child, no one other than his mother had ever touched his wings, and never this way. Never so gently, so tenderly.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re wonderful,\u201d she said. \u201cBut it\u2019s kind of hard to enjoy them when I know you have a woman locked in the shack out back, and I don\u2019t know why she\u2019s there.\u201d</p><p>He whipped around, his elation draining. She knew. He\u2019d wanted this, he reminded himself. He\u2019d wanted her to learn about this side of him. To know him, all of him. To want to be with him anyway.</p><p>\u201cShe demanded that I set her free.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you didn\u2019t,\u201d he confirmed. She couldn\u2019t. There was no door.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t.\u201d Her hand fluttered to her neck, rubbing. \u201cWho is she?\u201d</p><p>He watched a feather float through the air and land on the ground, and fought a wave of fear. What if Nicola considered him a monster? What if she decided she was better off without him?</p><p>Find out now, before you come to depend on her any more than you already have.</p><p>\u201cMy...mother.\u201d</p><p>Nicola\u2019s jaw dropped. \u201cWhat? Why?\u201d she demanded, closing the distance and flattening her palms over his bare chest. \u201cBecause she removed your first pair of wings?\u201d</p><p>His mouth went dry. \u201cAmong other things, yes.\u201d Understand. Please. \u201cAfterward, she threw me into a nest of vipers. I was so weakened, I couldn\u2019t escape, and for years I was forced to do terrible things to survive.\u201d</p><p>Sympathy cloaked her features. \u201cI\u2019m sorry about that. I really am, but this isn\u2019t the way to make her pay. You need to take her to the judge of your people. There is a judge, isn\u2019t there?\u201d</p><p>He nodded stiffly. \u201cI don\u2019t know what her sentence will be, if it will be harsh enough.\u201d</p><p>Her brows knitted together. \u201cThat\u2019s not your call.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe hates me. For no reason, she hates me. She isn\u2019t sorry for what she did. She\u2019s proud.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you, what? Want to inflict upon her every pain that was inflicted upon you?\u201d she asked, clearly dazed. \u201cYes. You do. It was her hair that you cut that day, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>A pause before he nodded.</p><p>\u201cAnd you were so angry with yourself, so torn up. Koldo, don\u2019t you see? The longer you keep her, the more likely you are to harm her irrevocably. And if you do, you\u2019ll never be able to forgive yourself.\u201d</p><p>He breathed in...out. \u201cShe deserves to suffer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe so, but hatred makes you just as much a prisoner as she is. You can\u2019t even see past it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I do. Take her to your judge.\u201d</p><p>Stubborn female, just as he\u2019d known she was.</p><p>Anger beaded in his chest. \u201cYou\u2019ve been hurt by someone, too. Hurt horribly, and yet you had no means of fighting back. Well, what would you do if the opportunity to gain revenge finally presented itself?\u201d</p><p>Before she could respond, he flashed to the apartment of the man who had killed her parents and brother. Oh, yes. He\u2019d memorized the address. The male sat on his couch, watching TV and drinking beer. Scowling, Koldo materialized. The man spotted him, cursed and scrambled backward. Koldo grabbed him by the scruff of his neck and flashed back to the bedroom in Panama.</p><p>Nicola was pacing in front of the bed, and now stilled.</p><p>Koldo shoved the male to the floor face-first. \u201cWhat do you have to say to the one who murdered your family?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWh-what\u2019s going on?\u201d the man in question cried. His eyes were wide, glassy, as they darted between Koldo and Nicola.</p><p>Finally, his attention remained on Nicola and he gasped. \u201cYou.\u201d</p><p>So. He recognized her, despite the years that had passed.</p><p>Nicola\u2019s hands formed a tent over her mouth.</p><p>\u201cDo you truly have the strength to pardon him?\u201d Koldo demanded.</p><p>She said not a word. Her gaze remained locked on the one responsible for her loss.</p><p>Tears rolled down the human\u2019s reddened cheeks. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he cried. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. But please, let me go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sorry because you were caught,\u201d Koldo yelled down at him.</p><p>The male squeezed his eyelids together, his tears falling with more force.</p><p>Koldo looked to Nicola. \u201cRemember your brother in his casket and then tell me what you want me to do to this man.\u201d</p><p>As the man tried to crawl away, Koldo pressed a foot into his lower back and held him down. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. So sorry,\u201d he repeated.</p><p>\u201cWell?\u201d Koldo insisted. Stop. You have to stop this. But he didn\u2019t. He\u2019d started it. He would see it through to the end.</p><p>Nicola raised her chin and finally met Koldo\u2019s stare. Her eyes were cold, hard. \u201cAfter the accident, Laila and I went to his house, intending to kill him while he was out on bail. Yes. That\u2019s right. We actually plotted a cold-blooded murder. We were so angry, so hurt. We figured we were dying anyway, and at that point, we wanted to die. So why not, you know?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Koldo listened, dread replacing the anger.</p><p>She continued softly, \u201cHis wife answered the door.

He had to make her understand his position. \u201cI assure you. No one will be hurt by what I do to my mother.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou will. You\u2019ll have to live with whatever you do, and we both know you can\u2019t do that.\u201d</p><p>This time, he had no response.</p><p>She laughed without humor. \u201cAll along we thought I was the one in need of healing, but it\u2019s you.

You\u2019re filled with a toxin of your own making,\u201d she said, and then she walked out of the room.</p><p>CHAPTER TWENTY-NINE</p><p>KOLDO HAD MADE a grievous mistake. He never should have wanted Nicola to learn about his mother. He should have kept the two women separated now and forever. If he had, he could have continued on with his life, just the way it was.</p> <p>His mother...his to torment, to feed his need for vengeance.</p><p>Nicola, his to taste and touch, to feed his yearning for affection.</p><p>Now, he had his mother, but not Nicola. She avoided his gaze. Anytime he entered a room, she vacated it.</p><p>While he couldn\u2019t fix the problem he\u2019d created, he could certainly burn the reminder of it. Two days after their argument, he moved his mother to the home he kept in South Africa, and torched the cage in Panama. He couldn\u2019t take her back to West India Quay. Sirena, and now Jamila, knew its location.</p><p>When he finished, he returned to the cavern above the waterfall.</p><p>He\u2019d chained Cornelia to the wall. Her hair was growing back, her scalp covered by stubble. She spit curses at him, and tried to reach for his wings.</p> <p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have spoken to the female.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAw,\u201d she sneered. \u201cHas she wised up and decided you\u2019re too repulsive for her?\u201d</p><p>His blood boiled, but he flashed away before doing something he would forever regret. As Nicola had said.</p><p>He spent the afternoon with Axel, hunting his father. They found several sets of tracks but each proved to be a dead end, the Nefas nowhere to be seen. As weak as the Sent Ones had left them, they had to be hiding, licking their wounds. But where?</p><p>He wanted this war over with, done.</p><p>He wanted to concentrate on Nicola. Nicola, whose heart amazed him. She had been dealt the worst, and yet light still shone inside her. He had been dealt the worst, and had allowed darkness to consume him.</p><p>She was right. He was wounded. But he had no idea what to do or how to heal himself.</p><p>He just knew he had to make things right with his woman.</p> <p>\u201cGet your head in the game,\u201d Axel muttered.</p><p>Koldo blinked into focus\u2014and realized he was about to slam into Charlotte and her girls, who stood atop a cloud, discussing...Nicola.</p><p>\u201c\u2014need the redhead to make me another omelet. So good!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know! Think Koldo would let me borrow her for a few years?\u201d</p><p>He angled up and over, avoiding contact. Heard a shouted, \u201cHey!\u201d</p><p>As the wind whipped against him, he looked to Axel. \u201cI must go. I\u2019ll see you tomorrow and we\u2019ll continue this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-oh. I recognize that look. Papa Bear\u2019s gonna do some groveling, isn\u2019t he?\u201d The warrior laughed with smirking amusement. \u201cMuch as I\u2019d like to see that, I\u2019ve got some people to do. See ya.\u201d</p><p>They branched off in opposite directions. Koldo flashed as he flew, traveling from state to state and across an ocean in the blink of an eye, until finally arriving at the ranch.</p><p>The sight that greeted him nearly stopped his heart.</p><p>A dark cloud surrounded the entire ranch, rather than the white one he\u2019d left behind.</p><p>Through the darkness, he saw multiple demons crawling over the walls. And that\u2019s when he knew. His cloud had been pumped full of demon toxin, sickening it. He\u2019d heard of this happening only once, and had thought it a rumor. False.</p><p>He palmed his sword of fire and flashed to the top of the cloud, where he hacked through the gloom. The edges curled backward, sizzling, creating an opening. He jumped through and landed on the home\u2019s roof, keeping his wings tucked as close to his sides as possible. He\u2019d never fought with them, and wasn\u2019t trained to do so. But that wouldn\u2019t stop him from fighting now.</p><p>The demons scrambled to move away from him, but he turned and swung the sword, turned and swung, slicing one after the other in half. Black blood sprayed in every direction. Bodies thumped against the grass.</p><p>Finally the roof was cleansed and he was able to drop into the house. Demons, demons, all around, each one bigger and stronger than the last, and all the more determined to wreak havoc.</p><p>Two leaped on him from behind, ripping handfuls of feathers from his wings. Koldo gritted his teeth and released his sword, then pulled the creatures off, broke their necks and threw them down like the garbage they were.</p><p>Where was Nicola? Laila?</p><p>He palmed his sword and worked his way down the hall, his wrist in constant motion. Demons dropped like flies. There were more inside Laila\u2019s room, but no sign of the girl herself. There was no sign of human injury, either, though the furniture was overturned, clothes strewn across the floor. If she\u2019d been taken...</p><p>A demon spotted him and attacked, diving low, locking on to Koldo\u2019s ankles, tripping him. His balance was off, and he couldn\u2019t catch himself. The sword of fire disappeared as he crashed. He lost his breath, and the rest of the demons attacked, swarming him.</p><p>More feathers were pulled. His skin was bitten, scratched. Someone was attempting to chew through his Achilles tendon. Koldo grabbed the two creatures hanging on to his leg, ripped their spines from their throats and tossed them into the far wall. He grabbed two more and did the same, then two more, until he was able to jump up. The rest of the demons fell to the floor. He kicked them, the razor in his boot neatly slicing through intestines.</p><p>When he finished, he stomped down the hall. Nicola\u2019s door was shut. He burst inside, wood shards spraying in every direction. In the center he found Lefty and Righty grating their claws against a puff of white fog.</p><p>Nicola was inside that fog, kneeling, her body draping Laila\u2019s. She was staring at the tattoos on her arm. Tattoos that had come to life, forming a protective barrier around her.</p><p>The girls were here. They were alive. They were safe.</p><p>A potent flood of relief sent him marching forward. Lefty spotted him and backed away, dragging Righty with him. The pair picked up speed and careened through the wall, disappearing.</p><p>Koldo followed them, determined to end them once and for all, but they proved wily and slipped into the skies, hiding in the clouds.</p><p>Resigned, he returned to Nicola\u2019s side and dropped to his knees. He patted, felt the hard shell around her, and knew it was thinning, softening. Finally, nothing was left but air.</p><p>\u201cNicola,\u201d he said.</p><p>The sound of his voice jolted her, and she straightened in a snap. Wide, stormy eyes found him, and a mewl escaped her lips.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry.\u201d</p><p>She threw her arms around him and hugged him tight. Her little body was trembling.</p><p>Laila remained curled in a ball, her eyes closed, her breathing even. She\u2019d passed out, he realized.</p><p>He leaned back, palmed Nicola\u2019s tearstained cheeks. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI convinced Laila to come into my room so that I could read to her. All was well one second, and demons were swarming the next. I don\u2019t think Laila could see them, but she could feel them, and she screamed. They wanted to kill us, not just infect us with more toxin. They wanted you to find our bloody bodies. All I could do was throw myself at Laila, skid us both across the room and look at the tattoos, just like you told me.\u201d</p><p>A new flood of relief had him shaking. \u201cYou did the exact right thing.\u201d</p><p>She sagged against him. \u201cI was so scared.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you cast that fear aside and acted.\u201d He ran his hands over her back, the ridges of her spine. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I yelled at you. Sorry I wanted you to hurt another living being. Sorry I tried to bring you down to my level, my pain. Sorry I left you. Sorry I wasn\u2019t here to help.\u201d</p><p>Warm tears wet his skin. \u201cI forgive you.\u201d</p><p>That easily, he thought. Just that easily, and the knowledge caused tears to bead in his eyes. She could have thrown his words in his face. She could have sought some sort of revenge, and he would have deserved it. Yet, she embraced him.</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019m sorry I ignored you these past few days,\u201d she said. \u201cI was trying to give you time to work through your problems without any pressure from me, when all I really wanted to do was kiss you. Or strangle you. I wasn\u2019t sure which.\u201d</p><p>And now she apologized to him.</p><p>He loved this woman, he realized. He loved her with all of his heart, all of his soul.</p><p>The knowledge hit him with the force of a jackhammer, leaving a big hole that finally allowed light to flood inside him, revealing thousands of creepy crawlers, evil things he\u2019d stored. The crawlers hissed and scrambled to avoid contact with the brightness and warmth.</p><p>He loved Nicola Lane.</p><p>But he wasn\u2019t yet worthy of her.</p><p>Her heart was pure, unsullied. His was tainted. Her hopes and dreams were so sweet. His had always been dark, violent. She had seen a way past similar urges.</p><p>She wanted to travel the world, she\u2019d once told him. Wanted to jump from an airplane, pet an elephant and dance on a skyscraper. And he could give her those things. Right now, that was his one saving grace. A saving grace he would take. He would earn her love\u2014deserve it\u2014one way or another.</p><p>And then, when he was worthy, he would wed her in the way of his people and permanently join her life to his, twining their life spans. He couldn\u2019t bear to be without her.</p><p>I have to let my mother go.</p><p>Every muscle he possessed tensed, and his mind instantly rebelled. No, no. He couldn\u2019t. He couldn\u2019t abandon his need for vengeance. But it was either the vengeance, or Nicola. He couldn\u2019t have both. His mother would always stand between them, a wall he could never hope to breach. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>So, yes, he had to let his mother go. He couldn\u2019t look back anymore. He could only look forward.</p><p>As the thoughts formed, the hole widened, widened still more, allowing the light to brighten and spread, eliminating the darkness altogether.</p><p>Koldo kissed Nicola softly, gently, and she welcomed him. But he knew now wasn\u2019t the time to reveal his plans. Their emotions were too high. And he hadn\u2019t yet romanced her as was proper.</p> <p>\u201cLet\u2019s get out of here,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>He helped her to her feet before crouching beside Laila and scooping her into his arms. Her slight weight barely registered. \u201cTuck yourself into my side,\u201d he told Nicola, \u201cand wrap your arms around me.\u201d</p><p>She obeyed, and he flashed to Zacharel\u2019s home in the heavens. The mist swirled at their sides as he called, \u201cZacharel? Annabelle?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m back here,\u201d Annabelle replied.</p> <p>The mist parted, creating a dreamlike walkway as he surged forward.</p><p>Nicola gasped, reached out. \u201cWhat is this place?\u201d Several tendrils of mist twined around her fingers, but he knew she also encountered a solid wall.</p><p>\u201cThe usual home for a Sent One,\u201d he said.</p><p>Annabelle was in the living room, once again perched in front of the coffee table, with books covering the entire surface. She glanced up, golden eyes soon catching and staying on Nicola.</p><p>\u201cAnd who do we have here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy female,\u201d he said, with a bloom of pride in his chest. \u201cThe one in my arms is her sister. They need a place to stay for a bit.\u201d</p> <p>A grinning Annabelle spread her arms. \u201cWell, welcome to the home of Zachy the Delightful.\u201d</p><p>He breathed a sigh of relief. No questions. No scrambling for answers.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not interrupting anything, I hope,\u201d Nicola said hesitantly.</p><p>\u201cNot at all. I\u2019m studying the ways of the Sent Ones, and could use someone to bounce around a few ideas. I mean, I\u2019m the wife of an army leader, and I need to know their laws, their strengths and weaknesses.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been studying, too,\u201d Nicola said, and eased beside the Asian beauty. Her gaze remained on her sister. \u201cI\u2019m Nicola, by the way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would say nice to meet you, but that would fail to convey my happiness. You\u2019re the first human female to enter this cloud in...ever. I\u2019ve been starved for decent conversation. And besides that, anyone who can take on Koldo and live, well, I like her already.\u201d</p><p>Koldo placed Laila on the couch. A slight moan parted her lips, and she shifted to her side, but other than that, she remained in her sleeping state. He straightened.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019ll be all right, yes?\u201d Nicola asked.</p> <p>Rather than answer, and spoil her mood, he said, \u201cThere\u2019s something I must do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be safe here,\u201d he said, sidestepping this question, as well. \u201cAnnabelle is just as much a warrior as Zacharel.\u201d</p><p>With that, he flashed to the cavern in South Africa. Though Cornelia was chained to the far wall, the thick sheet of moisture in the air had left her drenched. The dirty, human-made robe was plastered to her skin.</p><p>Her head lolled to the side in an attempt to rest on her shoulder. There were bruises under her eyes, her cheeks were gaunt and her skin wrinkled. Her lips were chapped.</p><p>He stepped in front of her. Despite the still-churning anger he had for her, he suddenly felt sympathy for her state\u2014and remorse for being the one who put her in it.</p><p>She blinked open her eyes. The moment his presence registered, she spit at him.</p><p>He wiped the spittle from his cheek.</p><p>\u201cAll my hard work destroyed,\u201d she said, still fuming about his wings. \u201cYou\u2019ve been given a gift you\u2019ll never deserve.\u201d</p><p>How right she was, though they weren\u2019t talking about the same thing. \u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll pray every day that someone takes them from you.\u201d</p><p>And I\u2019ll pray every day you find a way to forgive me for whatever wrong you think I\u2019ve committed. \u201cI\u2019m going to start a new life, Mother.\u201d</p><p>Her nostrils flared as she drew in a sharp breath. \u201cOh, well, good for you. I hope it kills you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not included in that life.\u201d</p><p>Her lips curved into a vile grin. \u201cFinally decided to end me, have you? Well, well. It\u2019s about time. You\u2019ll be kicked from the heavens. You\u2019ll be disgraced, humiliated, forgotten. You\u2019ll be hunted by demons the rest of your life, but you\u2019ll be powerless to stop them. You\u2019ll suffer, and eventually, you\u2019ll die. You\u2019ll spend eternity in hell\u2014where you belong.\u201d</p><p>All that hate, he thought. It lived inside her. Traveled with her, ate with her. Probably conversed with her. She was never without the faithless companion. And she never would be, as long as she nursed it at her breast. It hurt her, not him, just as his hatred had hurt him and not her.</p><p>Nicola was right. He\u2019d been a prisoner.</p><p>But now he would be free.</p><p>He drew a dagger from the air pocket beside him and reached out. She raised her chin, stoic, waiting, ready. Rather than slicing her neck, as she expected, he slammed the tip into one of the cuffs at her wrists.</p><p>\u201cWh-what are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeeing to your liberation. I threw the key to your chains in the farthest ocean.\u201d He had to work at the metal, grinding the dagger through the cylinder, but finally the two sides split. He did the same to the other wrist, then her ankles.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you doing this?\u201d she demanded.</p><p>\u201cDoes it matter?\u201d</p><p>A tense pause, her confusion saturating the air as surely as the water. \u201cThis doesn\u2019t change anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that, too,\u201d he said.</p><p>The moment the metal fell away from her, she shoved him. She was too weak to put much power behind the move, so he stepped back on his own. Her gaze locked on him, as though she expected this to be a trick, and she hobbled to the ledge of the cave. She spread her wings.</p><p>The action must have pained her, because she grimaced. \u201cWhen I\u2019m stronger, I\u2019ll come for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be ready. But if you try to hurt me by hurting the girl, I will end you. I won\u2019t give you another opportunity to strike at her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs if I would hurt an innocent.\u201d With that, she leaped from the cave, falling down, down, down. He wasn\u2019t sure she would have the strength to pull herself up, until, a second later, he caught a glimpse of her rising. Her glide was stiff, slow, but still she managed to stay in the air.</p><p>It was done, then. Over.</p><p>He waited for regret to overwhelm him. He experienced only...peace. Such sweet peace. He\u2019d done the right thing. He\u2019d taken the matter out of his hands. He\u2019d turned away from the temptation.</p><p>Now, for his reward.</p><p>CHAPTER THIRTY</p><p>THE CHANGE IN KOLDO confused, delighted and electrified Nicola.</p><p>Only half an hour ago, he\u2019d arrived at Annabelle\u2019s to pick up Nicola for \u201ca date.\u201d He\u2019d given her a pink angel robe and waited for her to change.</p><p>Before they left, Nicola had gone to check on Laila, who had awoken from her faint, thrown herself at Nicola and sobbed. Eventually she\u2019d calmed and promised to listen to everything Nicola had to say about good and evil, joy and fear\u2014in the morning. She\u2019d wanted a night to herself, to relax. To forget, if only for a little while.</p><p>Grateful for the change, Nicola had agreed and allowed Koldo to gather her in his arms and take her away.</p><p>And so here she was, out on her date. Part one? Flying. Koldo held her as they soared through the sky, the wind in her hair, caressing her skin. The scent of the clouds, morning dew and sunshine inundated her very being.</p><p>He was behind her, holding her tightly. The air pressure kept her legs glued to his, rather than dangling below. And the world... The world was lush and alive and glorious. Vibrant greens and blues melded earth and sea. Mountains rose, and valleys dipped. Winter here, summer there. A veritable feast for her senses.</p><p>\u201cEverything is so beautiful,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cThere was a time I saw only the ugliness.\u201d He kissed the back of her neck, and she shivered. \u201cBut not today. Today is a new day, a fresh start. I...I freed my mother.\u201d</p><p>She tried to twist around and look at him, but couldn\u2019t quite manage it. \u201cOh, Koldo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were right. I could keep her and worsen, or let her go and heal.\u201d</p><p>She wished she could hug him. \u201cIt was difficult, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe most difficult thing I\u2019ve ever done, and yet, somehow the easiest.\u201d</p><p>She patted his hands, joined as they were over her middle. \u201cI\u2019m pleased,\u201d she said, as he\u2019d often said to her.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re about to be more so.\u201d He angled their bodies, and began to descend.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you taking me?\u201d she asked, breathless.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll see.\u201d</p><p>Already she could make out...a jungle safari? A river wound through lush trees and patches of dirt. A lioness chased a pack of gazelles. Birds of every color scattered in the wind. Elephants drank at a pond.</p><p>He straightened just before landing and placed her feet gently on the ground. Familiar scents layered the air. Scents she\u2019d encountered at the zoo, the few times her parents had taken her, but also things she hadn\u2019t encountered. Exotic flowers and flourishing ivy. Damp vegetation, and a startling purity.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re in the spirit realm with me. They can\u2019t see you,\u201d Koldo said. \u201cGo on. Get close.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>In answer, he gave her the gentlest of pushes.</p><p>Nicola moved forward hesitantly. Despite what Koldo had said, she expected the magnificent creatures to bolt. Instead, they continued to suck water through their trunks and spray drops into their mouths. They even bathed themselves and splashed each other.</p><p>A laugh bubbled from her, but still the elephants remained in place.</p><p>Koldo stood off on the side, watching.</p><p>Finally she moved beside one of the few babies, an adorable thing that weighed more than she and Laila combined. His gaze lifted, seemed to lock on her. But...he couldn\u2019t see her. Could he? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cTouch him,\u201d Koldo said. \u201cHe won\u2019t hurt you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill he feel me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis spirit will, yes.\u201d</p> <p>So...some animals could sense what happened in the spirit realm just as some humans could. She reached out. Her hand met warm, soft flesh, and ghosted through. From behind, a trunk brushed over her arm. Startled, she turned. And found herself face-to-face with the momma.</p><p>Apparently, Nicola\u2019s spirit could feel things, too!</p><p>The female wasn\u2019t scared of her, but intrigued. Momma touched her and sniffed her, and then attempted to play with her hair. Nicola laughed, carefree and overjoyed.</p><p>After a while, the creatures wandered off, bored with her.</p><p>Koldo approached and gathered her in his arms, tension and warmth radiating from him.</p> <p>\u201cWait. I\u2019m dirty. You don\u2019t want to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not dirty.\u201d</p><p>She looked down. Of course she was\u2014not. The dirt and stains the elephants had left behind had completely faded.</p><p>\u201cWearing the robe is like walking around in a shower.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn that case, I might never take it off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s see if I can change your mind about that,\u201d he said huskily.</p> <p>Her blood began to fizz with the same charged need this man always ignited.</p><p>He flashed her to the top of a building. A reeeally tall building, with a flat roof. The sun had set, and the moon was high. The wind offered a gentle caress. There was a patch of grass, with jewel-toned flowers planted all around. In the distance, she could see multicolored, twinkling lights. Soft music played in the background.</p><p>Koldo turned her around, only to tug her closer to him. \u201cNow we dance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would you\u2014\u201d He was giving her all the things she\u2019d said she wanted, she realized suddenly. To travel the world, to pet an elephant. To dance on a skyscraper. What a sweet, sweet man. Tears burned the backs of her eyes and she rested her forehead against his chest. His heart hammered against her temple.</p><p>They swayed together, and though it was obvious neither of them knew what they were doing, the moment was perfect. His hands roved over her back, caressing. He played with the fabric of her robe. He combed his fingers through her hair. Every action seduced her, intoxicated her, leaving her trembling, aching.</p><p>\u201cKoldo,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cNicola,\u201d he said, the sweetness of his breath fanning over her cheek. \u201cI want you to know...have to tell you...I...love you.\u201d</p><p>She stopped, certain she\u2019d misheard, and looked up at him. He peered down at her with hope and need and fierce possessiveness in his eyes.</p> <p>\u201cI want to marry you in the way of my people.\u201d He dropped to one knee, in the way of her people. \u201cI want to protect you with my name, my status, my fortune and my future.\u201d</p><p>He...really did. He loved her. Her. Plain Nicola Lane, who\u2019d spent her life in one hospital or another and endured one tragedy after another. And he wanted to marry her. By the world\u2019s standards, she was unexciting, not worth a second glance. And yet, this man loved her enough to give her the desires of her heart. He loved her enough to let go of his past. To want to build a future with her.</p><p>\u201cBut I\u2019ll age,\u201d she said, wanting to save him heartache later. \u201cYou won\u2019t. And\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Your life will be bound to mine, and as long as I live, you will live. As long as you live, I will live.\u201d</p><p>How...how...perfect. He was offering her a life she\u2019d only begun to dream about.</p><p>\u201cI love you, too, Koldo,\u201d she said, voice trembling. She did. She loved him. Loved the man he was, the man he was becoming. The man he would one day be. She loved his strengths and recognized his weaknesses. He was good for her, and she was good for him. \u201cAnd yes. Yes, I will marry you.\u201d</p><p>His lips lifted in a slow grin. \u201cYou will?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will.\u201d He was the other part of her, a necessary part.</p><p>He was on his feet a second later, flashing her to a bedroom she\u2019d never before seen. He flashed her again, and this time she landed on the large bed, Koldo poised over her, a lacy canopy over him.</p><p>\u201cSo confident I would say yes?\u201d she asked with a chuckle, sliding her hands up his chest.</p><p>\u201cSo hopeful.\u201d</p><p>Her gaze moved over the room. She saw dark velvets and light silks, Victorian furniture and an old-world aura. The scent of roses drifted on a soft breeze. \u201cWhere are we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne of my favorite homes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow many do you have?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have sixteen. I\u2019ll give you a tour of each one. Later.\u201d</p><p>He lowered his head, pressed their lips together, and...sweet heaven. The need they had for each other once again exploded. They were frenzied, eager for more. For all.</p><p>\u201cWe won\u2019t stop this time,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cNot for a second.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot for any reason.\u201d</p><p>If they did, her heart would finally give out. Not from sickness but from frustration. They\u2019d just admitted their love for each other. Now she wanted to show him.</p><p>She tugged at the collar of his shirt, saying, \u201cI want your skin against mine.\u201d Need it.</p><p>He helped her out, jerking the material over his head. Her robe was the next to go, leaving her in a bra and panties. A growl rose from him.</p><p>\u201cYou are more dazzling every time I see you.\u201d</p><p>He made her feel that way. As if it didn\u2019t matter how she fixed her hair or whether or not she wore makeup. As if he would like her no matter how much she weighed. \u201cI feel the same about you.\u201d</p><p>He lifted to his knees, hastily worked at the waist of his pants. But he had trouble and ended up yanking hard enough to send the fabric flying to the floor in pieces. Any other time, that would have made her laugh. Whenever they were in bed, clothes were destroyed. But one look at him, and she lost her breath. He was intense, determined.</p><p>\u201cYou make me happy, Koldo,\u201d she said truthfully.</p><p>His weight returned to her, pressing into her, thrilling her. \u201cHopefully as happy as you make me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s see if I can make you happier. Stay just as you are. Don\u2019t move.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d he asked, even as he obeyed.</p><p>\u201cI want to learn everything I can about the man I love. Everything you like. Everything you want.\u201d They\u2019d done things before, but this was different. This was a commitment, body and soul. She would give him all that she was, and he would know a satisfaction like no other. She would make sure of it.</p><p>Her hands roved over the muscles of his chest, even tunneled underneath his arms to the tattoos and the softness of his wings. Then she brought them to the front again, moved lower...lower still. The ripples of his stomach. The hairless calves. The smooth bottoms of his feet. Other than the feathers, there wasn\u2019t a yielding spot on him. He was rock solid, the strength she\u2019d always craved for herself.</p><p>And he was silken heat, a smooth whiskey that intoxicated, melting away inhibitions. He was everything. He was light in the darkness. He was...hope.</p><p>\u201cNicola,\u201d he gritted out. \u201cI don\u2019t want to stay just as I am. I want to move.\u201d</p><p>The jaggedness of his tone caused her to shiver. \u201cSo you like what I\u2019m doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love.\u201d A trickle of sweat slid down his temple. \u201cI hate.\u201d</p><p>A breathless chuckle left her. \u201cThen I\u2019m doing something right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery right,\u201d he said on a groan. \u201cAnd very wrong.\u201d His features were strained, his lips compressed. His desperation was growing, just like her own.</p><p>How could she not love this man? He never tried to play it cool, never tried to hide the depths of his feelings or his pleasure or his need. And oh, the smell of sunshine he emitted, a smell her body had begun to associate with pleasure. Now was no different, and stunning need became incomparable hunger.</p><p>\u201cNicola. I can\u2019t... I must...\u201d One second she was poised over him, the next he was poised over her. \u201cThis is all right, yes?\u201d</p><p>With his weight pressing into her, forcing her to revel in her own vulnerability? \u201cYesss.\u201d</p><p>He was a flurry of movement, smoothing his hands over her, preparing her for what came next, singeing her with the intensity of his heat, wringing gasp after gasp out of her as he gave her what her body so desperately wanted.</p><p>\u201cThere won\u2019t be anyone else for you,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cNor you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever. I\u2019m so glad I found you, sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>Sweetheart. An endearment sweeter even than his touch. \u201cMe, too.\u201d</p><p>A masculine purr of satisfaction. \u201cYou\u2019re so soft. So warm. So mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo desperate for you.\u201d For all that he was. Rough or gentle, rushed or slow.</p><p>But he stilled and peered down at her, intense and determined. \u201cI want to be man and wife before we come together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere?\u201d she squeaked. \u201cNow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis very second.\u201d</p><p>Melting all over again.... He was so eager to claim her legally, he was willing to put sex on hold. How many men would do that? \u201cOkay,\u201d she breathed. \u201cAll right. But hurrrry. Please.\u201d</p><p>He kissed her before saying, \u201cI belong to you, Nicola. I pledge my life to yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad. Now, if you would just\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSay the words back to me.\u201d</p><p>Oh. \u201cI belong to you, Koldo.\u201d She rubbed her knees against his waist, squeezing. \u201cI pledge my life to yours. Now, do you need me to tell you what to do next or\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow and forever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow and forever. So can we just\u2014\u201d</p><p>Suddenly, though Koldo hadn\u2019t moved, she felt split in two, her back bowing off the bed. She hurt. She burned. And the terrible heat spread like wildfire, liquefying her bones, torching her organs. She was no longer one being, but two, and both parts of her were agonized. But as quickly as the sensations had arrived, they were gone, and she sagged on the mattress, panting.</p><p>\u201cWhat was that?\u201d she gasped out.</p><p>Koldo braced himself on his elbows. \u201cWe are wed now.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cJust like that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust like.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOur souls bonded.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean we\u2019re...one?\u201d Even saying the words filled her with a wild, bone-deep satisfaction.</p><p>\u201cIn that way, yes. Now, for the other way.\u201d He kissed her again\u2014a kiss that affected every inch of her, making her forget the pain of before and remember the pleasure to come. \u201cI\u2019m glad we waited for this moment. Now you\u2019ll be mine in every way that matters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019ll be mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNicola,\u201d he said and finally\u2014finally\u2014claimed her.</p> <p>She screamed. He stopped, staring down at her. Concern and horror radiated from him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m okay,\u201d she panted. \u201cI am. I\u2019m sorry. I just didn\u2019t know what to expect, and then it was happening, and now I\u2019m babbling, and you\u2019re not moving, and I\u2019m really sorry. Please continue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow badly did I hurt you?\u201d he asked, the strain of holding back evident.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t. Promise. Well, not much.\u201d</p><p>He wasn\u2019t convinced. \u201cYou\u2019ll tell me if I do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will.\u201d</p> <p>Hesitantly, he leaned down and kissed her again. Softly, gently. It didn\u2019t take long to renew their passions, and then, oh, then, they wed in body, as well. She yielded to him without reservation, accepting him, burning for him, loving him, enfolding him in her arms, crying his name, begging for more, nipping at his lips.</p><p>\u201cNever get enough,\u201d he rasped.</p><p>\u201cGlad.\u201d It was the only word she could manage.</p><p>He kept a slow pace. Her gaze found his, and locked on. He could have looked away, but he didn\u2019t. He peered down at her as if there was no one else he\u2019d rather see, as if he were utterly mesmerized by her.</p><p>No one had ever looked at her that way before.</p><p>And I get to keep him. Forever.</p><p>In that moment, something profound happened. The connection between them deepened, and her soul sang the most beautiful song.</p><p>He\u2019s mine. He\u2019ll always be mine.</p> <p>Thank you. Oh, thank you.</p><p>This love will never die.</p><p>Her heart actually felt like it expanded, welcoming even more love for him. Love and joy and peace\u2014everything he\u2019d ever wanted her to feel, in the sweetest degree.</p><p>She gave him all that she was, all that she would ever be, her breath emerging choppily. He gave her all that he was, all that he would ever be, his muscles knotting underneath her hands.</p><p>\u201cLove you, Nicola.\u201d</p><p>He felt the intensity, too, she thought. He must. \u201cLove. Yes.\u201d Oh, sweet heat... More, more, please more... Her heart was pounding...her body seeming to expand, just like her heart, unable to contain her innermost being. \u201cFaster,\u201d she begged.</p><p>He obeyed, his motions sharp and sure.</p><p>\u201cYes. Yes! Koldo, I\u2019m going to...\u201d Burst apart at the seams and fly away.</p><p>And that\u2019s exactly what happened.</p><p>She burst. She flew. And wherever she ended up, utter satisfaction slammed through her, at last assuaging the ache that had plagued her since their first kiss. She was suddenly complete, a woman who had survived the worst and found the best.</p><p>In the distance, she heard Koldo\u2019s loud roar echo, masculine contentment at its finest, drawing her back.</p><p>He collapsed on top of her, his heavy weight nearly smashing her lungs. But it was far more glorious than before. She was shaking and clutching at him, this man, her husband.</p><p>\u201cHow are you... You feel...\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cAmazing,\u201d she sighed.</p><p>\u201cYes. That was... That was... I don\u2019t have words.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do.\u201d She kissed his neck, his hammering pulse. \u201cThat was worth doing again.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER THIRTY-ONE</p><p>AS THE MORNING SUN crested in the sky, casting rays into the room, Koldo\u2019s mind whirled. Nicola was draped over him, her chin resting on his sternum, her fingers petting through his beard, then along the planes of his chest. He had his hand flattened on her lower back, a possessive hold to be sure.</p><p>He opened his mouth to say thank-you\u2014again\u2014but he sang instead. He hadn\u2019t sung since his childhood, days before his mother removed his wings. He\u2019d never thought to sing again. He\u2019d never had reason. And yet, his low baritone emerged, filling the room, giving Nicola this final piece of himself.</p><p>I\u2019m yours. I surrender all.</p><p>When he finished, she sat up to peer down at him. He\u2019d once again covered her with his essentia, causing her skin to glow the most luscious shade of gold\u2014and his heart to constrict.</p><p>\u201cThat was so beautiful.\u201d Her eyes were heavy with slumber, wet with tears, her lips swollen and red from his kisses. Beautiful strawberry curls fell in tangles, shielding her breasts. She was the picture of a well-loved woman\u2014one he wanted to love again. \u201cSuch a serious expression, my famous warrior. What are you thinking about?\u201d</p><p>He twirled one of her curls around his finger. Sex wasn\u2019t what he had imagined. Oh, he\u2019d known naked bodies would strain together. And because of the kisses and caresses he and Nicola had already shared, he\u2019d expected the pleasure. But he hadn\u2019t expected to have every bit of his sense of self shredded by her. Had he, he would have thought he\u2019d hate it. Instead, he\u2019d loved every second.</p><p>\u201cI would tell you, but I\u2019ve satisfied you too intently for you to have a working brain. You wouldn\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><p>A pause. A gasp. \u201cDid Koldo the Serious just crack a joke?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe hopes not,\u201d he said, trying not to grin.</p><p>She tsked. \u201cI\u2019m thinking someone needs assurance that he did a good job.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe does.\u201d And he wasn\u2019t ashamed to admit it. Her feelings mattered to him.</p><p>\u201cHow very human of him,\u201d she said with a grin of her own.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fitting. After all, he has a human in his heart now.\u201d He\u2019d expected to go slowly with her, to savor every moment, help her gradually reach a climax so that her body wouldn\u2019t shut down. Instead, his own had urged him to go faster, to do more, to do everything she would allow him to do. He\u2019d been lost in a world of carnality\u2014committed carnality, that is. He wouldn\u2019t have liked doing this with anyone else. He\u2019d suspected before, but he knew beyond a doubt now. He\u2019d been too vulnerable during the act, all of his defenses down.</p><p>\u201cIf I had to describe our night together with a single word, I would say...hmm.\u201d She nibbled on her bottom lip. \u201cPleasant, I guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPleasant. You guess?\u201d</p><p>A little giggle bubbled from her\u2014the kind he\u2019d wanted her to have. \u201cYeah. You need practice. Selah.\u201d</p><p>A mock growl rumbled in him. \u201cI\u2019m not pausing and thinking. I\u2019m starting now.\u201d He rolled her over, poised above her with a dark scowl. \u201cBut before I teach you the meaning of ecstasy\u2014again\u2014you will tell me how you feel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerfect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo weakness?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019m healed.\u201d Her eyes widened. \u201cI am. Koldo, I\u2019m really healed! My heart didn\u2019t act up once.\u201d</p><p>She was...right. Not once had she displayed any symptoms of a defective heart. Her stamina had even surpassed his own. \u201cThe toxin is gone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes! But it\u2019s more than that, I think. I feel so clean. So...strong.\u201d</p><p>Yes, that did sound like more had happened. As if a spring from the Water of Life had formed inside of her, creating a well of health and vitality. But that would mean she was a Sent One.</p><p>He\u2019d heard of that happening. But...was she?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so glad,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2014\u201d Suddenly she frowned, rubbed at her chest. \u201cSomething\u2019s wrong. I need to check on Laila.\u201d</p><p>As many times as he\u2019d sensed the danger Nicola was in, he knew not to discount her instinctual feelings. \u201cOf course.\u201d He stood and dressed in the robe he\u2019d torn. While the garment was once again in pristine condition, it was different than what he was used to. It opened in back and when he shoved his arms through the holes, the material had to fit itself around his wings and weave the seams together around them.</p><p>He tugged Nicola to her feet and pushed her own robe over her head, covering her beautiful curves\u2014a certain travesty. He kissed her temple, and said, \u201cWhatever happens, we\u2019ll get through it together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d She was steady, her color high\u2014welcome signs of her newfound well-being.</p><p>Koldo flashed her to Zacharel\u2019s cloud, the romance of his home giving way to the functionality of his leader\u2019s. \u201cZacharel,\u201d he called out.</p><p>\u201cBack here. Hurry. I was just about to summon you.\u201d</p><p>Nicola burst into motion, dragging Koldo with her. In the living room, Zacharel and Annabelle crouched in front of the couch, where Laila still sprawled. Her skin had taken on a yellowish hue, and she was thrashing, moaning, her teeth coated with blood. She must have bitten her tongue.</p><p>Nicola rushed forward, pushed the couple out of the way and knelt beside her sister. \u201cOh, my love. No.\u201d</p><p>Zacharel met Koldo\u2019s gaze, stood and closed the distance. \u201cHer heart stopped, but I was able to revive her,\u201d the warrior said quietly. \u201cShe won\u2019t last long.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you dare say that,\u201d Nicola threw at Zacharel, clearly fighting sobs.</p><p>Something in Koldo\u2019s chest constricted. He studied his wife\u2019s twin. To his surprise, the Most High once again allowed him to see past skin and bone and into her spirit.</p><p>There were now two demons inside her.</p><p>They\u2019d managed to slip past her defenses, Koldo realized, his heart sinking. Or rather, her lack of defenses. How would Nicola react when her sister died? And Laila would die. She hadn\u2019t fought the toxin, but had welcomed more.</p><p>\u201cThe demons plaguing her...\u201d Koldo began.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re gone,\u201d Nicola interjected. \u201cI know that, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Koldo said, torn up inside. \u201cThey\u2019re inside her, love.\u201d</p><p>Nicola stiffened. \u201cNo. No!\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>Violently she shook her head, saying, \u201cFeed her more of the Water.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI cannot help her if she will not help herself.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll talk to her. I\u2019ll make her understand.\u201d She shook her sister, trying to wake her up. \u201cListen to me, Laila, okay? You have to listen to me.\u201d Nicola shook her harder, her desperation evident.</p><p>Though an agonized moan was Laila\u2019s only response, Nicola began to talk, telling her sister everything she\u2019d learned about spiritual warfare and overcoming demons. She talked and she talked and she talked, but Laila\u2019s condition never improved.</p><p>Eventually Nicola\u2019s voice cracked. Big, fat tears rolled down her cheeks. She twisted, looked to Koldo. \u201cTell me what to do,\u201d she croaked. \u201cPlease, just tell me what to do to help her, and I\u2019ll do it.\u201d</p><p>Spiritually, Laila was no stronger than she\u2019d been the day he\u2019d found her in the hospital. \u201cNicola\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Don\u2019t say it. Don\u2019t say there\u2019s nothing you can do.\u201d She swiped at her cheeks with the back of her hand. \u201cThere has to be something.\u201d</p> <p>He hated seeing her like this, so broken, so sad. Losing hope. He couldn\u2019t bear it.</p><p>And he hadn\u2019t tried everything within his power to force Laila to listen, had he? He\u2019d concentrated his efforts on Nicola. He had allowed life to distract him, every spare moment spent with his mother or chasing after his father\u2014even when he\u2019d known the peril Laila faced.</p><p>If he didn\u2019t try one last time, a wall could be built between Nicola and him. Oh, she would forgive him for any wrong she thought he\u2019d done. If she even blamed him at all. But every time she thought of this moment, he would be cast in the role of failure.</p><p>He would have given up too soon.</p><p>He wouldn\u2019t have done all that he could.</p><p>And she would be right to think so.</p> <p>Dread filled him, but still he looked to Zacharel. \u201cI must go. Guard the females.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you\u2014\u201d The answer must have come to his leader, because the male nodded. \u201cAre you sure you want to do this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am.\u201d</p><p>A nod of that dark head. \u201cWill you come here afterward?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly to give you the vial. If I stay, she\u2019ll try and take care of me.\u201d And that would only negate what he was about to do.</p><p>Again, Zacharel understood. \u201cI see your essentia all over her. You have claimed Nicola.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have.\u201d</p><p>He gave Koldo another sage nod. \u201cI\u2019ll keep the females safe.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThank you. And...thank you for the gift,\u201d he said, flaring his wings. He turned to Nicola. \u201cI must go, but I\u2019ll return with the Water of Life. It will buy her another few weeks, and we can try again to teach her the truths she needs to fight and win.\u201d</p><p>Hope sprang in her eyes and he gave her a quick kiss before flashing to the realm of the Council. There was no time to waste.</p><p>An opulent palace made from silver stone appeared just in front of him, the tiered structure rising from a steep cliff, each layer topped by a dark red steeple. Snowcapped mountains were spread out behind it, mist falling from each of the peaks.</p><p>Last time he was here, he\u2019d lost the hair on his head and the skin off his back.</p><p>Today, he would probably lose his wings.</p><p>Koldo pounded up the steps leading to the double doors in front, his boots thumping against the cobbles. Inside, the walls were painted with scenes of the victories the Most High had won. Battles against demons, human lives saved. Battles of good against evil, right against wrong, love against hate. For once, Koldo understood why the Most High had fought so valiantly to save the humans. There was nothing more precious than a devoted human heart.</p><p>Two guards were posted at the entrance to the tribunal chamber, their wings a rich cerulean. Angels aided Sent Ones and humans alike. Both males held a sword across the door, the lines of metal crossing in the center.</p><p>Koldo paused in front of them and offered his name, as was custom.</p><p>\u201cGrata,\u201d they called, and clanged the swords together before flicking their wrists and twirling the metal behind them, creating an opening.</p><p>Koldo soared forward, pushing open the doors. An azure carpet stretched to the center of the spacious room. Above him arched a domed ceiling, angels and clouds visible through the crystal. The walls were draped with white velvet, and the floor polished ebony. The only furniture was a half-moon desk, and seven chairs. Seven council members peered at him expectantly, each wearing a decorative robe of a different color. Red, blue, green, yellow, cyan, magenta and violet. A rainbow of luxury. The Most High blessed His people with abundant wealth.</p><p>Four males, three females, and each appeared to be at the end of a human life\u2014and Koldo wasn\u2019t sure why. No one was, though they were certain it had nothing to do with rot, as with the Nefas. As with Germanus, these beings had silver hair and heavily wrinkled skin.</p><p>Even still, they were powerful in ways Koldo could not fathom.</p><p>He inclined his head in greeting.</p><p>\u201cSo soon you return to us,\u201d Dominicus said.</p><p>\u201cThis surprises me,\u201d Isabella said.</p><p>\u201cI have need of the Water of Life,\u201d Koldo announced.</p><p>Adeodatus tilted his head to the side, pondering him. \u201cAnd you wish to give it to a human, rather than a comrade.\u201d</p><p>He wasn\u2019t startled by the fact that they knew his purpose. They always knew. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Christa asked.</p><p>Koldo gave them the entire story. How he\u2019d met Nicola, what had happened with her, what had happened with her sister.</p><p>\u201cOne listened, and one did not,\u201d Benedictus said. \u201cInteresting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy should Laila Lane receive another chance?\u201d Katherina asked.</p><p>\u201cBecause she deserves it? No,\u201d Koldo said. \u201cBecause she desires it for herself? No. But because I, a servant of the Most High, am asking.\u201d</p><p>A slow smile lit Dominicus\u2019s entire face. \u201cYou have gained confidence since last you were here. I approve.\u201d</p><p>Last time, he\u2019d come for Zacharel and Annabelle. Last time, he\u2019d come with anger and hate in his chest, determined to do whatever was necessary to capture his mother. He had kept his head bowed, his voice low, too afraid of being turned down.</p><p>Today, he knew he would not be turned down. He knew his rights. Knew he was in good stead with the Most High, his anger released, his past wiped away. There were no obstacles in his path. What he wanted, he wanted out of love. And it was always the Most High\u2019s will to heal. Never did He want a person to suffer, not even to learn a lesson.</p><p>\u201cWe have no need to convene and discuss. You are approved,\u201d Christa said with a nod.</p><p>As he\u2019d known he would be. Now, to hammer out the details. \u201cWhat must I sacrifice? I will give whatever you ask, but I wish to remind you that this is not the Most High\u2019s way. He doesn\u2019t require anything but the respect of His laws.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut we require this, wanting our traditions to stand,\u201d Benedictus said sternly. \u201cDo you still wish to proceed?\u201d</p><p>No need to think about his answer. \u201cI do.\u201d</p><p>A pause as the members looked to each other. In unison, they nodded.</p><p>\u201cWe could ask you to stay away from the human, Nicola,\u201d Katherina said.</p><p>His stomach twisted. No. Not that. Anything but that.</p><p>\u201cBut we will not,\u201d she added, and he breathed a sigh of relief. \u201cWe will take your wings. Leave them here. Then, you may go to Clerici\u2019s temple, where you will be whipped. Afterward, he will escort you to the river gate. Do you agree?\u201d</p><p>Nicola\u2019s tearstained face flashed before Koldo\u2019s eyes. \u201cI do,\u201d he said.</p><p>CHAPTER THIRTY-TWO</p><p>KAFZIEL STOOD BEHIND HIM, holding a dagger.</p><p>Koldo sat on a backless chair, leaned forward and gripped the edge of the table.</p><p>\u201cYou are a brave man, Koldo,\u201d the council member said. And then, as Koldo\u2019s mother had done all those centuries ago, he began the agonizing process of separating wing from muscle.</p><p>Metal pierced flesh. Warm blood trickled. Pain arced through Koldo\u2019s entire body. He gnashed his teeth and endured stoically. He\u2019d gotten by without wings for a lifetime. He would get by again. But he mourned the fact that he would never again fly Nicola through the air. He would never again fly beside a fellow soldier. Once again he would be an oddity among his kind.</p><p>Better an oddity with love, than \u201cnormal\u201d without it.</p><p>From the corner of his eye, he watched as one wing was placed on the floor, the beautiful feathers soaked in crimson, the muscles and tendons nothing more than raw meat.</p><p>\u201cAnd now, the other,\u201d Kafziel said.</p><p>Koldo kept his mind on Nicola. Her beautiful, smiling face. Her storm eyes, twinkling. She hugged him, overjoyed. She kissed him, thankful.</p><p>Worth it.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t long before the second wing joined the first, and Koldo was helped to his feet. His legs shook, and what was left of his back pulled and stretched and ached and stung\u2014a back that would next be whipped.</p><p>\u201cThe human could spurn this gift,\u201d Isabella said sadly. \u201cShe could refuse the Water, fight its effects.\u201d</p><p>He knew that, but he couldn\u2019t regret his choice. He would give Laila a chance. That was all he could do. He would never have to look back and wonder what would have happened if only he\u2019d tried.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t stop now,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cTo Clerici you go, then,\u201d Adeodatus said with a nod.</p><p>\u201cMany blessings upon you, Koldo,\u201d the members announced in unison.</p><p>With what little strength he possessed, Koldo flashed to the river gate at Clerici\u2019s temple. Already his eyesight was hazing. He knew the area by heart, however. There was no grass, only dirt. No trees, no flowers. Only more dirt and a fat stump that acted as the whipping post. In front of him stretched an iron gate he would soon bypass\u2014if he could walk.</p><p>He expected a guard to be there, whip in hand, but it was Clerici who stepped forward to greet him.</p><p>\u201cHello, Koldo.\u201d</p><p>His knees buckled just in front of the whipping post, and he hit the ground hard. His breathing was choppy, but he could make out the scents of cinnamon and vanilla\u2014a combination that sprang from his own skin. As much as he\u2019d marked Nicola, she had marked him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m pleased with you, Koldo. You have placed another\u2019s well-being before your own.\u201d Clerici closed the distance. \u201cYou have no idea of the outcome, and yet still you do this.\u201d</p><p>Koldo closed his eyes and said not a word, asked not a single question.</p><p>\u201cWhat you\u2019re doing is a true expression of love,\u201d Clerici said, \u201cand I commend you.\u201d</p> <p>Stop talking!</p><p>\u201cThis is your last chance to walk away.\u201d</p><p>A muscle ticked below his eye.</p><p>\u201cVery well,\u201d Clerici said.</p><p>A pause...and then the first blow fell.</p> <p>Leather against decimated flesh, and leather won, sending bits of skin, muscle and blood flying. Koldo locked his jaw. The second blow fell. The third. The fourth. His jaw hurt so badly from trying to contain his screams he was certain he\u2019d popped the bones out of place.</p><p>This time, he imagined Laila rising from Zacharel\u2019s couch and shedding the sickness as if it were an unwanted winter coat. He imagined the two sisters hugging, laughing, then discussing spiritual laws, learning and growing and putting demons in their place\u2014beneath their feet.</p><p>The fifth blow. The sixth.</p><p>He had no flesh left, he was sure. Every muscle in his body was tight, shaking, burning. Black spots winked through his vision.</p><p>The seventh. Eighth. Ninth.</p><p>Tenth. Eleventh. Twelfth.</p> <p>Finally Koldo could hold back no longer. A cry of agony burst from him.</p><p>Thirteenth. Fourteenth. Fifteenth.</p><p>He breathed in through his nostrils, short, gasping pants, and breathed out through his mouth. The whip continued to fall. He couldn\u2019t pass out. He had to be able to get himself through that gate on his own. Had to get to the Water and back through the gate. Otherwise, all of this would have been for nothing.</p><p>After thirty blows, the whip at last stopped.</p><p>\u201cDone. It\u2019s done.\u201d</p><p>Koldo\u2019s head lolled forward, his cheek resting on the stump.</p><p>\u201cNever forget the Most High has girded you with strength,\u201d Clerici told him before stalking away.</p><p>The gate in front of him opened with a whine. Girded him with strength? Yes, that was true. The code was in his heart, burning as hotly as his back.</p> <p>He could do this.</p><p>He crawled forward, black still winking through his line of sight. Once he passed the iron, dirt gave way to grass, cushioning his hands and knees. Yes, he could do this.</p><p>The sound of rushing water greeted his ears, and he forced himself to keep moving. Ruined skin pulled taut. Mutilated muscle tore further. One yard, two...he plodded along, flashing several feet when he could. Mist soon saturated the air.</p><p>There were two rivers. The River of Life and the River of Death. Everyone who entered the gates had a choice. Life or Death. Blessing or Cursing. One soothed with a cool breeze, the other smoldered with a stinging wind. One was clear and pure, the other dark and murky. There were those who had actually chosen death, deciding to sever their connection to the Most High. Willingly falling, wanting no part of the heavenly laws.</p><p>At the edge of the River of Life, Koldo withdrew a small vial from an air pocket and filled it to the brim, his hand shaking. Can\u2019t drop it. If he tried to take more than the allotted vial, even if he spilled the contents before leaving this area and sought only to replenish, the Council would know and he would lose everything he\u2019d already sacrificed, plus the Water\u2014and he would never again be allowed to this point.</p><p>He fit the cork in the center. The moment it was secure, he placed the vial in an air pocket and breathed a sigh of relief.</p><p>Now, to get the vial to Zacharel\u2019s cloud.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t manage great distances, would have to take this a little at a time. First, he crawled to the gate. Then, he flashed to the edge of the cloud. Then, he flashed to the next cloud over, then the next, hopping along, getting closer and closer to Zacharel\u2019s.</p><p>No, he realized a short while later. He wasn\u2019t. He was going in circles around Clerici\u2019s temple, ending up only where his gaze led him. Frustration joined a cornucopia of other emotions.</p><p>He pictured Zacharel\u2019s cloud. I can do this. Flashed\u2014</p><p>And appeared in the middle of the sky, nothing to anchor him. He plummeted toward the earth, wind beating at him, and oh, did that hurt. If he landed at this speed, he would burst into too many pieces to put back together.</p><p>He pictured Nicola\u2019s home. It was closer, more manageable. If he could just get there, he could summon Zacharel. Not to help him, but to claim the Water and take it to Laila. Before it was too late.</p><p>Come on. One more time. He flashed\u2014</p><p>Was still in the sky, only lower.</p><p>Flashed again\u2014</p><p>This time, he appeared in Nicola\u2019s living room and landed on his stomach with a heavy thump. He raised his gaze. There was the couch he\u2019d left behind, the dark brown carpet with frayed and tattered edges. Oh, thank the Most High. Struggling to breathe, he reached up with a quaking hand and removed the vial from the air pocket.</p><p>Zacharel, he tried to project. As weak as he was, he couldn\u2019t quite manage it.</p><p>A shadow fell over him. \u201cI wondered how long it would take you to fight off my poison and find us,\u201d a voice said\u2014a voice he recognized. \u201cI just didn\u2019t know you\u2019d already be in the condition I wanted you.\u201d</p><p>Dread shot through him. Not her. Anyone but her. He tried to hide the vial, but he wasn\u2019t fast enough. Sirena stepped on his wrist, holding him immobile.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m part Fae, and as you know, some Fae possess special abilities. I can block the power of others for short periods of time. That\u2019s why you couldn\u2019t flash\u2014and why you couldn\u2019t find us.\u201d The container was ripped from his hand, and a stiletto was dug into the wounds in his back, making him hiss. \u201cWhat do we have here?\u201d A moment passed. She laughed heartily. \u201cThe Water of Life. How wonderful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me see that,\u201d another voice commanded.</p><p>No. No, no, no. Not anyone but Sirena, he corrected. Not his father.</p><p>Another shadow. Another laugh, this one deep, rumbling. \u201cIt certainly is. His woman must be sick. He must be trying to save her.\u201d</p><p>Pop. The cork fell to the floor and rolled just in front of him.</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d Koldo said, willing to beg.</p><p>Sirena\u2019s stiletto dug ever deeper.</p><p>\u201cOh, how I like that word on your lips,\u201d Nox said\u2014just before pouring the precious liquid on the floor.</p><p>No. No! After everything he\u2019d suffered\u2014everything he would soon suffer at his father\u2019s hand\u2014Laila\u2019s chance was wasted. He squeezed his eyes closed. He could do this again, and he would, but it might be too late.</p><p>The Water splashed over Koldo\u2019s face, cool and soothing, but he pressed his lips tightly together, not allowing a single drop into his mouth. He wasn\u2019t to partake of the Water until his back was totally healed. To do so now was to suffer, unhealed, for all eternity.</p><p>Nox dropped to his knees, anchored his hand under Koldo\u2019s chin and forced him to look up. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have fun, you and I.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER THIRTY-THREE</p><p>THANE LEFT THE HUMAN he\u2019d just pleasured slumped on the floor of the bathroom stall and entered the nightclub. The things he\u2019d just done to her...the things she\u2019d asked him to do... She was his third female that night. His eighth in the past three days. Usually he could control his desires. But here, this week, the more females he\u2019d bedded, the more he\u2019d wanted, even needed. Sex had become all he could think about.</p><p>He\u2019d stopped hunting the demons entirely.</p><p>Something was wrong with him\u2014and yet still he wanted another female. He wasn\u2019t sure his body could take it, however. His head was fogged, his limbs trembling.</p><p>A strobe light cast colorful rays over the dance floor. Loud, pounding rock music blasted from speakers, and bodies writhed all around, blurring together. Multiple perfumes and colognes scented the air, creating a sickening collage. He stalked from the building and the heat and into the cool of the night.</p><p>Pebbles along the sidewalk caused him to trip. The moon was a mere sliver, the sky dark, and only a few stars were visible. There were streetlamps, but the beams were weak, highlighting only small circles.</p><p>Currently, his wings were hidden in an air pocket. His robe conformed to his body in the shape of a T-shirt and pants, both black. A wave of dizziness hit him as he continued to surge forward, and he had to lean against the side of a building to remain upright.</p><p>Bjorn, Xerxes, he projected. He hadn\u2019t spoken to them since...his first few days in Auckland, he realized with a frown. That wasn\u2019t like him. That wasn\u2019t like them. Why hadn\u2019t they at least tried to converse with him?</p><p>They would come here and they would pull him out of this spiral. The three of them would track the demons together. Fight together. Win together.</p><p>Silence.</p><p>His frown deepened. They would never ignore him. They loved him.</p><p>Something had to be wrong with them, too.</p><p>\u201cHey, you,\u201d a female voice called.</p><p>He stopped at the entrance of a back alley and turned only because he recognized the voice. It was the woman he\u2019d left in the bathroom. She looked different vertical. Her clothes were mussed, wrinkled, and her dark hair in the same condition. Brown eyes sparkled with excitement. Color was bright in her cheeks.</p><p>A sense of foreboding hit him as he struggled to concentrate on her.</p><p>\u201cYou left something behind,\u201d she said, almost within reach. She held out her arm, her fist closed.</p><p>A feather? \u201cShow me.\u201d</p><p>Slowly her fingers uncurled. But...nothing rested on her palm.</p><p>\u201cAnd that is?\u201d</p><p>A smile curved the corners of her lips. \u201cYour pride.\u201d</p><p>Anger slammed through him. He had been judged one too many times lately. \u201cWhat of yours? I spoke only five words to you before you went to that bathroom stall with me.\u201d</p><p>Her amusement only increased. \u201cWant to know a closely guarded secret of the Phoenix, Sent One? We can become anyone.\u201d As she spoke, her countenance morphed. Dark hair became gold and scarlet. Brown eyes became green. Rounded ears developed points at the end. Human teeth grew fangs.</p><p>The Phoenix.</p><p>His Phoenix. Kendra. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>A second later, her image changed again. To the female he\u2019d bedded earlier today. A second later, her image changed again. To the female he\u2019d bedded before that. Another change. The female he\u2019d bedded last night. On and on she morphed her appearance, until he saw all eight of the supposedly human females he\u2019d taken.</p><p>He swallowed a mouthful of dark curses. \u201cHow did you know where I\u2019d go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t. I followed you.\u201d She flicked her hair over her shoulder. \u201cBut you didn\u2019t know, did you, and didn\u2019t have any idea. That\u2019s not very soldierly of you, now, is it?\u201d</p> <p>Stealthily he reached behind him, into the air pocket he kept tied to his waist. His fingers closed around the hilt of a dagger.</p><p>\u201cYou took me back to my people, and they forced me to wed a warrior. But I ran away the morning after the ceremony and used the cash I\u2019d stashed away to have my slave bands removed. There are people who specialize in that, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour husband will come for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. He\u2019ll come for you, too.\u201d A tinkling laugh. \u201cWant to know another well-guarded secret of the Phoenix? When we aren\u2019t slaves, we can enslave. Every time you slept with me these past few days, your need for me increased. Didn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>The anger budded into sharp, jagged rage. She wanted him addicted to her body. He\u2019d been a prisoner before, and he\u2019d vowed never to endure such a hell again. Had vowed to destroy anyone who even tried.</p> <p>He always kept his vows.</p><p>He didn\u2019t give himself time to think about his actions and how low he was about to sink\u2014or the punishment he might face. He didn\u2019t waste time threatening the girl. Threats obviously wouldn\u2019t work with her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m no one\u2019s slave,\u201d he said.</p><p>And he struck.</p><p>In seconds, the tip of his dagger was embedded in her chest. Her eyes widened with...not confusion and pain, as he\u2019d expected, but with glee.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she gasped out. \u201cThat was easier than I thought.\u201d</p> <p>Her knees gave out, and she collapsed to the ground. She lay there, panting for breath, red blood spilling from her, her heartbeat no longer saving her, but killing her, pumping and pumping and pumping the life from her body.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll catch fire, turn to ash and re-form... I\u2019ll be stronger...and you\u2019ll be forever mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he growled. No. He wouldn\u2019t believe it.</p><p>A laugh sounded in the distance.</p><p>He swung around, fighting another wave of dizziness and watching as a shadow slunk from the roof of the building next to him and down the wall. Red eyes glowed from the center of the darkness. Another shadow followed, and then another. Then shadows began to slink from the roof of the other building.</p><p>Demons.</p><p>So many, more than he could count. Perhaps more than he could fight on his own, but he relished the challenge. To leave was to invite them to hurt the humans nearby.</p><p>\u201cThe pretty boy has been searching for me, I hear,\u201d an evil voice proclaimed. \u201cHe wants to punish me for helping to slay his precious king.\u201d</p> <p>A chorus of chuckles echoed.</p><p>Thane stepped into the spirit realm and grabbed his sword of fire, the flames producing a crackling yellow-and-blue light far hotter than the ones found in hell, for it was pure. The creatures looked like motor oil that had been mixed with blood and congealed. They were blobs\u2014and they were dangerous.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll kill you,\u201d he vowed through clenched teeth. The dizziness had magnified rather than faded, and he was having trouble staying on his feet. Falling...falling...no, catching himself, once again leaning against the building.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s find out,\u201d the evil voice cackled. \u201cLast one standing wins.\u201d</p><p>Each shadow slithered from the buildings, soaring through the air, and aiming for Thane.</p><p>He twirled his sword to his left, his right, and arced through the center, slicing several creatures through the stomach. The shadows sizzled and hissed, but none fell from the air. They continued to come at him. He palmed a dagger with his other hand, but the metal did no damage, whisking through and causing the creatures to laugh more heartily.</p><p>A breeze blew behind him, and he knew something was trying to sneak up on him.</p><p>He flared his wings, knocking several shadows away from him, and hurtled into the air, flipping over the creatures that had thought to take him from behind. More shadows converged. He struck, taking what constituted heads. Rather than fall, however, they vanished.</p><p>Thane knew it would be better to remain in perpetual motion, never allowing anyone to get a lock on him. He darted to the side of a building, then to the other side, then to the ground, then to the roof, sword constantly swinging. They followed him. Three times he almost fell. Once he hit his knees, but he managed to bounce back up.</p><p>Suddenly Bjorn flew into view, followed by Xerxes. Both men landed at his sides, flanking him. He was so overcome with relief he willingly dropped to his knees.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t call, you don\u2019t write,\u201d Bjorn said, leaping into motion, his sword of fire already drawn and swinging.</p><p>\u201cTried,\u201d he gritted. \u201cCouldn\u2019t get through.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfter what we had to give up to get here, after what we had to do to find you, you owe us,\u201d Xerxes said, swiping at the shadows with short swords.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll gladly pay the toll.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe minions of strife,\u201d Bjorn said. \u201cAlways picking fights. Let\u2019s give them a spanking.\u201d</p><p>They split up, dividing the attention of the creatures, leaping, diving, flying this way and that, flipping, kicking, punching, but only the sword of fire caused any damage. One of the creatures finally managed to wrap itself around his head like a dark blanket, suffocating him.</p><p>Screams, screams, so many screams. They scraped at his ears, assaulted his mind. He thought he heard his friends shouting in the background, but...but...the screams, so loud, so loud, and they were his own, he realized, coming from him, from his past, from his present, blending together, bleeding so much, soaking him.</p><p>All too soon, scenes from his past sprang up and joined the party. The women he\u2019d bedded and left. The humans he\u2019d killed simply to get to demons. The warriors he\u2019d betrayed after his return from the demon dungeon. The times he\u2019d laughed when he\u2019d wanted to cry.</p><p>Then suddenly, a blaze of light erupted and the darkness left.</p><p>Thane fell forward, landing on his face. He blinked rapidly, the haze around him slowly thinning, even as blood dripped into his eyes. He saw Xerxes and Bjorn, still fighting the shadow creatures, going low, straightening, taking out ankles and knees to hobble. The two warriors stayed close, shielding Thane as best they could.</p><p>Must have landed on the Phoenix, he thought. That had to be her still-warm skin cushioning him\u2014no, not warm, but hot. Too hot. Somehow, in death, she was heating up, about to catch fire, all on her own.</p><p>Just as she\u2019d promised.</p><p>One of the shadows slunk over, staying low, darting out of the way anytime Bjorn or Xerxes struck, and managed to latch on to Kendra\u2019s bare leg. The creature laughed manically\u2014just before Xerxes beheaded it.</p><p>The shadow vanished, and Thane saw that a flame had finally sparked at the end of Kendra\u2019s toe. That flame intensified, spread. Soon, her entire foot was engulfed. Her ankle. Her calf.</p><p>The enemy thinned and the remaining few realized they couldn\u2019t win and backed up. They attached themselves to building walls and slithered up, up and over the roof.</p><p>Cowards!</p><p>Thane scrambled away from Kendra\u2019s body. Her thighs were the next to catch flame, then her torso, her arms, her chest. Her face. Her hair. Every inch of her was doused, crackling\u2014and then she was gone, ash floating through the air.</p><p>She would re-form. She\u2019d promised that, too. She would be stronger.</p><p>He would be her slave.</p><p>Every ounce of his being rejected the notion.</p><p>Xerxes stomped to Thane\u2019s side. \u201cYou all right, my man?\u201d</p><p>His voice sounded far away. Thane tried to open his mouth to speak but he didn\u2019t have the strength.</p><p>Bjorn took a step toward him, stopped and frowned. He looked down at his wrist, where there was a black scratch, then back to Thane. Confusion gleamed in his rainbow eyes. His frown deepened. His knees collapsed.</p><p>Xerxes popped up to race to him, but\u2014</p><p>Bjorn vanished.</p><p>Vanished as if he\u2019d flashed\u2014an ability he didn\u2019t possess. Or, as if someone or something had flashed him.</p><p>\u201cWhat just happened?\u201d Xerxes shouted. \u201cBjorn. Bjorn!\u201d</p><p>Thane struggled to sit up. His friends. He had to help his friends. They were the world to him. Meant everything. He was nothing without them. But the dizziness returned, flooding his head, and weakness spilled into his limbs, and he could only lie there, panting\u2014until he blacked out.</p><p>CHAPTER THIRTY-FOUR</p><p>NICOLA SAT BESIDE her sister\u2019s hospital bed. So much had changed since the last time they\u2019d done this terrible dance, and yet, Laila still hurtled toward death.</p><p>If we\u2019re ever again in that situation, and I have a feeling we will be, I want you to let me go.</p><p>No, Nicola had said then.</p><p>Never, she said now.</p><p>Before, she had been without hope. Now, she was different. Stronger. Smarter. She knew there was a better way. But her sister didn\u2019t, and changing her mind was what mattered right now.</p><p>Her precious Laila, she thought, tears beading in her eyes. There were tubes in her sister\u2019s chest and arms. Her skin had already yellowed. She had slipped into a coma the doctors said she would never wake from. She was drugged but not without pain, her features pinched and her muscles tensed.</p><p>Every time Nicola repeated what she\u2019d learned from Koldo, Laila\u2019s vitals strengthened\u2014but the moment she stopped talking, those vitals plummeted. Sleep had become Nicola\u2019s enemy.</p><p>Zacharel had done what he could to keep Laila alive, but in the end, he\u2019d needed help. So, he\u2019d flown Laila to the hospital. He\u2019d stationed two Sent Ones at Nicola\u2019s sides, and they were now standing in the hallway, giving her some time with her sister. To say goodbye.</p><p>Where are you, Koldo? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He\u2019d been missing for two days. Zacharel was out looking for him.</p><p>Zacharel, who had told her that Koldo had gone to procure more Water, just because Nicola had asked, and that he should have returned by the end of the first day. That wasn\u2019t all he\u2019d told her, of course. Even remembering the rest, Nicola shuddered.</p><p>Your man was whipped. Before that, he was commanded to give up something precious to him. His mind has to be a mess. I have asked our leader for the details, but they are not his to share.</p> <p>So badly she had wanted to go back to those few minutes inside Zacharel\u2019s cloud and stop Koldo from leaving. But that\u2019s why he\u2019d flashed without telling her where he was going. So that she couldn\u2019t. He was doing this for her. Suffering for her.</p><p>I have to find him. Yet, she couldn\u2019t leave her sister to...to... She just couldn\u2019t leave her sister alone.</p><p>And what if Koldo had been asked to give up Nicola?</p><p>Her stomach twisted into a thousand little knots, and she had to swallow back a moan of grief.</p><p>\u201cThis is it for me, Co Co.\u201d</p> <p>Laila\u2019s voice pierced the silence of the room, and Nicola jolted with shock. Clear gray eyes watched her, no hint of pain evident.</p><p>Inside her, hope and confusion collided with the shock, creating a heady mixture that left her dizzy. \u201cYou\u2019re awake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust for a moment.\u201d Chapped lips curved in a soft smile. \u201cYou have to let me go, my love. It\u2019s time.\u201d</p><p>No. Absolutely not! \u201cI told you before. I can\u2019t. I won\u2019t.\u201d Nicola vehemently shook her head. \u201cYou can beat this.\u201d</p><p>A weak chuckle reverberated between them. \u201cAlways the strong one...as well as the sensitive one. I don\u2019t want you looking back on this and blaming yourself. You did everything you could. I refused to listen. And I don\u2019t want you afraid. I\u2019m not. Not any longer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not afraid, either.\u201d I\u2019m just devastated. \u201cYou\u2019ll get better. Koldo went to get you special Water. It helped you before, and\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, my love, I\u2019m ready now. I\u2019ve been hovering between the natural and the spiritual for a while, and I got some things worked out with the Most High. He really is wonderful, you know. I asked for a chance to say goodbye, and He granted it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot goodbye. I want you to stay,\u201d she whispered brokenly.</p><p>\u201cI know you do, but the fear... It was ugly and I let it ruin me. At least now I\u2019m going to a better place, and one day we\u2019ll be together again. For now, you have a life to live. The things you\u2019re going to teach people... Look at what you\u2019ve done for Koldo already.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLaila\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you, Co Co.\u201d So softly spoken.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t do this. Please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s already done.\u201d</p><p>There would be no changing her sister\u2019s path, she realized. The tears escaped, flowing down Nicola\u2019s cheeks, one after the other, burning her skin. She reached out, took her sister\u2019s fragile hand and linked their fingers.</p> <p>\u201cI love you, too, La La.\u201d</p><p>Laila smiled again\u2014and breathed her last.</p><p>NICOLA WALKED THE STREETS of her childhood neighborhood in a numbed daze. At her request, her guards had flown her here and now followed discreetly behind her. She couldn\u2019t stop picturing the way her sister\u2019s head had lolled to the side, the spark fading from her eyes, leaving them glassy, dull. Machines had beeped like crazy, and nurses had rushed inside. But that time, they hadn\u2019t tried to save the girl. They\u2019d known they couldn\u2019t.</p><p>They\u2019d turned off the machines, patted Nicola on the shoulder and left her alone.</p><p>Silence had surrounded her. Such heavy, oppressive silence. She had only been able to sit there, tears continuing to slide down her cheeks.</p><p>How was she supposed to go on from here?</p><p>She was shaking by the time she reached the house they\u2019d grown up in. The house where they\u2019d laughed and talked and played. The house where they\u2019d read storybooks to Robby.</p><p>Located in historic midtown, the house had yellow stucco and exposed red brick. There were bushes and flowers and bright green grass, plus a cement pathway leading to the steps of a wraparound porch.</p><p>The hospital faded from her mind, replaced by a vision of Laila peering out from the window, watching for Nicola to return from the doctor. The moment she had emerged from the car, her sister had smiled at her through the glass, relieved to be together again.</p><p>Together again. Something they wouldn\u2019t have while Nicola was down here.</p><p>Nicola\u2019s knees collapsed. Grief was suddenly razor sharp inside her, cutting her up, ruining the numbness. For so long, Laila had been her only companion. Laila was the only one who had ever shared the many travesties of their lives. Laila had cried with her and mourned with her and hurt with her and helped rally her when she was at her lowest.</p><p>And now...now...</p><p>\u201cGive me time alone,\u201d Nicola choked out to her guards. \u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>A moment passed as they debated, but in the end they walked away and rounded the corner at the end of the street.</p><p>A fresh round of tears welled in her eyes and spilled onto her cheeks, one after the other, faster and faster, until she was sobbing, shaking uncontrollably, sorrow and despair rising up, consuming her. Sunlight beat down on her, but she couldn\u2019t feel the sting. She was cold inside. So cold.</p><p>Her sister was a part of her. There\u2019d never been a Nicola without a Laila.</p><p>Her sobs increased until she was hunched over and heaving. Had she eaten, she would have thrown up all over the driveway. But she hadn\u2019t, and she could only gag and choke and remember and despair. The new owners and their neighbors must have been at work, because no one came out to check on her. She was glad.</p><p>Eventually, though, she calmed. She stayed there, crouched on the cement, her forehead pressing into her hands, her eyes swollen and nose stuffed. Death wasn\u2019t the end, she reminded herself. The grave couldn\u2019t win. She would see her sister again. She would.</p><p>But one thought arose, and refused to leave her. Things hadn\u2019t had to end this way. Demons had poisoned her sister, yes, but then, Laila hadn\u2019t fought back.</p><p>How many families had been affected by a similar situation, but just hadn\u2019t known it? How many had accepted what they thought was natural and inevitable, never knowing there was another way?</p><p>Too many.</p><p>She had to change that. She couldn\u2019t let another sister end up where she was, on all fours wetting the ground with a stream of fat tears. Or a mother. A father. A friend. Koldo had taught her how to fight, and she would teach others.</p><p>Out of her pain would come her purpose.</p><p>Yes. This was war.</p><p>The first stirring of hope hit her, and she straightened. The brightness of the light had her blinking. And then...then her heart began to pound in a wild, warped rhythm, as if the organ had just been strained beyond repair. Pain radiated down her left arm, as though she were having another heart attack.</p><p>Dying? she thought.</p><p>This is it. The end. Your sister is gone and you can\u2019t survive without her.</p><p>No. No, that couldn\u2019t be right.</p><p>But fear gobbled up every ounce of her hope, and the pain increased.</p><p>All alone. No one to help you.</p><p>No! Those thoughts couldn\u2019t be springing from her mind. They contradicted everything she\u2019d just realized. So where could\u2014</p><p>Demons, she realized. She couldn\u2019t see them, but demons must have sensed her despair and come running, hoping to poison her and feed. Well, she wasn\u2019t going to let them.</p><p>\u201cI know you\u2019re lying to me. I know I\u2019m well.\u201d As she spoke, her heart returned to its normal beat. \u201cI\u2019ll never cave to your kind again.\u201d</p><p>Two scowling demons appeared in front of her and tucked their gnarled wings into their backs. She had seen them before\u2014one had showed up at her office and then again with Koldo\u2019s father. One had a horn rising from his scalp and fur all over his body. The other had a horn in the center of his forehead and scales rather than skin. Their eyes were black, bottomless and pure evil, a match to their pungent scents.</p><p>She stood, saying, \u201cYou don\u2019t scare me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe should. We\u2019ve been waiting for this day. For this moment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere are your friends, huh?\u201d the other asked. \u201cThey seem to have abandoned you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen this moment isn\u2019t as it seems.\u201d She lifted her chin. \u201cI always have help. And besides that, with or without them, you can\u2019t hurt me.\u201d</p><p>They grinned in unison, revealing sharpened fangs.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve been with you a very long time, Nicola. We know your weak spots.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou need us.\u201d Uttered in a husky, seductive whisper. \u201cIf for no other reason than to keep other demons away.\u201d</p><p>One step, two, they approached her. She held her ground. At any other time she might have experienced horror. But not now. They\u2019d been waiting for this moment, they\u2019d said. Waiting for her sister to die, when Nicola\u2019s emotions would be wrecked. They\u2019d planned this attack. Had probably strategized for days, weeks, laughing about what an easy target she would be. Well, they would get no satisfaction from her.</p><p>What do I do now? she wondered.</p><p>Now, I fight.</p><p>The thought rose from deep inside her, where instinct swirled. Yes. She\u2019d decided to fight, and so she would.</p><p>They liked fear and despair\u2014and so she would give them joy and hope.</p><p>She closed her eyes and thought about Koldo. Her husband. Her beautiful husband. He loved her, and she loved him. No matter what. She would hunt him down, and they would be together again. If he\u2019d been asked to give her up, so what? She hadn\u2019t agreed to those terms. She hadn\u2019t promised to give him up.</p><p>They would fight this war together.</p><p>Her hand began to burn.</p><p>She glanced down\u2014and watched as a sword of fire appeared in her grip. She yelped and almost dropped the weapon, so great was her surprise. But she somehow maintained her grip. The hilt was warm and light as she danced the crackling flames through the air.</p><p>Now the demons backed away from her, their big bodies trembling. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhere did you get that?\u201d one gasped.</p><p>\u201cThis can\u2019t be happening,\u201d the other cried.</p><p>They flared their wings, intending to fly away.</p> <p>If I\u2019m going to act, I have to act now.</p><p>\u201cYou picked the wrong target,\u201d she said. With a single swing of her arm, Nicola decapitated both of the creatures. Their heads rolled, and their bodies fell. Black blood pooled at her feet\u2014and satisfaction pooled in her heart.</p><p>The battle had begun.</p><p>Magnus and Malcolm flew around the corner, both clutching their own swords of fire.</p><p>Hers was bigger.</p> <p>They stopped when they spotted her.</p><p>\u201cYou...you...\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re as shocked as I am, so let\u2019s discuss it later, all right? Do you know where Koldo is?\u201d she demanded.</p><p>It was time to begin her hunt.</p><p>CHAPTER THIRTY-FIVE</p> <p>KOLDO WAS CARTED to his father\u2019s underground nest\u2014which had been moved to Koldo\u2019s home in West India Quay. The walls were comprised of dark, jagged rock, the once-pure pool of water now dark in color. There were around thirty Nefas soldiers dressed in loincloths, standing around flesh-colored tents, waiting to praise Nox for Koldo\u2019s capture.</p><p>\u201cStrip him,\u201d Nox commanded coldly, never one to delay the business of torture.</p><p>Eight females rushed to obey. Koldo was already shirtless, so only the bottom half of his robe had to be torn from him. Sharp nails sliced at his wounds, and humiliation burned deep in his soul.</p><p>Once again, he was reduced to a puppet, under his father\u2019s control, helpless.</p><p>\u201cTie him to the boulder and whip the rest of him.\u201d</p><p>Another command the females were happy to obey.</p><p>\u201cBut you better not like it,\u201d Sirena snapped, her possessive streak showing.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t go down like this. He couldn\u2019t. His life couldn\u2019t end in defeat.</p> <p>But Koldo was too weak to fight as he was dragged to a large silver boulder and strapped down. A second later, each of the females seemed to unfold a whip and strike at him, over and over again. His arms, his legs, and yes, even his decimated back. He gritted his teeth and bore it without a word, without a gasp, even when his skin was nothing more than tattered ribbons. He knew the rules of the Nefas.</p><p>A moment of frailty would be forever exploited.</p><p>He tried to flash, and failed. But even if he\u2019d been at his strongest, he knew he wouldn\u2019t have been capable of the deed. During the journey, Sirena had dug her claws into many of his wounds and poisoned him, stealing his ability. \u201cI\u2019ll have you yet,\u201d she\u2019d whispered. He\u2019d tried to project his voice into Zacharel\u2019s mind, but he wasn\u2019t sure he\u2019d gotten through. There\u2019d been no response.</p><p>At last the females finished with him. More of his strength waned, but he was determined to live. He had to live. He had to obtain more Water. Had to help save Laila. Had to see Nicola again. Had to be with her, hold her.</p><p>He\u2019d often sensed when she was in danger, but just then, he thought he sensed...determination from her. And if that were the case, Laila had to be alive. Nicola had to be wondering where he was. Nothing else would elicit that much resolve from her.</p><p>\u201cHow do you feel, boy?\u201d Nox asked with a laugh. \u201cWell, I hope. But if not, no matter. Tonight, Sirena will claim you as her very own.\u201d</p><p>Cheers erupted.</p><p>\u201cTake him to the cage.\u201d</p><p>Koldo was untied and carried to the very cage he\u2019d locked his mother in. Only, now it was covered by a tarp. He was flashed inside and dropped. He remained on the floor and rolled to his stomach, every inch of him aching. He looked around, but his vision was too hazed to make out more than a dark blob in the corner. A human?</p><p>His father approached, saying, \u201cHave you learned yet, boy? You cannot vanquish me.\u201d</p><p>Koldo pressed his lips together. He could rage, but what good would that do him? He could threaten\u2014and amuse his father. He would rather wallow in the humiliation.</p><p>\u201cI hear you let your mother go,\u201d Nox said. \u201cDid I ever tell you the story of your conception? No, probably not. I liked that you thought she loved me and still wanted me. But you see, your mother was helping defend an impoverished tribe of humans I wanted as my slaves. I captured her, too. Oh, how she fought me.\u201d</p><p>Sickness suddenly churned in his stomach.</p><p>\u201cI soon put her in her place, of course. Underneath me.\u201d</p><p>Rape, Koldo thought, his stomach now heaving.</p><p>His mother had been raped. Koldo had been the result. He should have guessed, even when she\u2019d claimed to want the man, probably too ashamed to admit the truth. Instead, he\u2019d been so blinded by his hatred and his need to make her suffer, he\u2019d taunted her about obsessing over Nox. No wonder she had spat at him.</p><p>Guilt and shame joined Koldo\u2019s humiliation, the same toxic mix he\u2019d dealt with most of his life. He wasn\u2019t excusing his mother\u2019s behavior. But she had hurt, and so she had lashed out. Koldo had hurt, and so he had lashed out. He should have broken the cycle.</p><p>\u201cI enjoyed her over and over again, and decided to keep her,\u201d Nox continued. \u201cThe day she gave birth I made the mistake of freeing her bonds. She escaped, taking you with her. I looked for her, but she hid very well.\u201d</p><p>And that was probably one of the reasons she had never wanted her friends to see him, Koldo thought, not because she was ashamed of his ugliness. She hadn\u2019t wanted word to travel and reach Nox.</p><p>\u201cWill...destroy...you.\u201d The words left him, unstoppable.</p><p>He would. Whatever he had to do.</p><p>He would strengthen. He would come out of this.</p><p>Nox snorted, and even that was smug. \u201cYou can\u2019t even protect yourself, and you think you\u2019ll take me down? No, Koldo, that isn\u2019t how this is going to work. You\u2019re going to heal, and you\u2019re going to marry Sirena. You will get her with child if I have to steal your seed myself. Once she has a son, I\u2019ll have no more use for you.\u201d</p><p>And he would be killed.</p><p>\u201cUntil then, meet your cell mate.\u201d Nox gestured to the shadow Koldo had seen in the corner of the cage. \u201cI believe you know him. His name is Axel. He\u2019s a Sent One, just like you, and you\u2019re going to kill him if you want your Nicola to survive what I have planned for her.\u201d</p><p>Footsteps pounded...became fainter....</p><p>\u201cLiar,\u201d Koldo tried to shout, but only managed to whisper. Nicola was safe. Axel was safe. He wouldn\u2019t believe otherwise.</p><p>\u201cNot this time, he\u2019s not,\u201d he heard Axel say calmly.</p><p>What? Koldo tried to sit up. No...no! Have to get Axel to safety. Can\u2019t allow him to suffer. \u201cYou must escape. Now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, none of that now.\u201d Warm hands stroked over his scalp. \u201cI\u2019m exactly where I want to be.\u201d</p><p>Koldo relaxed, but only slightly. \u201cHow were...you caught?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know, the uze. I was strolling down an abandoned alley, pretending to be helpless, and boom, someone grabbed me.\u201d</p><p>So...he was here on purpose?</p><p>\u201cThe Nefas had been following me for days. I just let them catch me.\u201d</p><p>Koldo was astonished. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike I really want to break in a new partner.\u201d</p><p>No. No, that wasn\u2019t it. Axel cared about him. Axel had placed Koldo\u2019s well-being above his own. And now, Koldo was supposed to harm him to save Nicola? \u201cShouldn\u2019t...be here. I want you gone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo way. I told you. I\u2019m exactly where I want to be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo bad. You\u2019re not allowed to help me. The Water...you\u2019ll suffer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho said anything about helping you?\u201d</p><p>Then what? What was the plan? What was the purpose of this?</p><p>\u201cJust sit back and enjoy the show, bro,\u201d Axel said, and Koldo heard the amusement in his tone. \u201cI have a feeling you\u2019re going to like this one. Your day is about to be saved, and by the most unlikely person.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho? How?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo way I\u2019ll ruin the surprise.\u201d</p><p>Koldo couldn\u2019t help himself. He pulled himself into a sitting position and draped his arm around Axel. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot afraid of a man hug, I see,\u201d the warrior said, clearly uncomfortable.</p><p>Koldo gripped him tighter.</p><p>\u201cReally? This is happening?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you, male.\u201d</p><p>Axel cleared his throat and wrapped an arm around him, too. \u201cI love you, too. But I\u2019m going to pretend that\u2019s the pain talking\u2014for both of us. And if you ever tell anyone you heard any kind of trembling in my voice, I\u2019ll kill you.\u201d</p><p>A few hours earlier</p><p>NICOLA STOOD in the center of the spacious room located in a palace high in the heavens. A lifetime seemed to have passed since she\u2019d been brought here, but in reality, only a half hour had. Malcolm and Magnus had summoned Zacharel, told him what they\u2019d witnessed, and the dark-haired warrior had gathered her close and flown her here.</p><p>He had yet to speak a word.</p><p>She was still raw over her sister\u2019s death, still wondering where Koldo was\u2014and growing more determined to find him by the second. She needed to be out there, right now, searching for him.</p><p>He was hurt. She sensed it deep, deep inside, a knowledge her concern for Laila had shadowed. But it wasn\u2019t hidden anymore, and urgency was riding her hard. Whether he\u2019d been hurt from the whipping or something more, she didn\u2019t know. But she would. Soon.</p><p>\u201cI have to leave,\u201d she said.</p><p>Zacharel shook his head.</p><p>Frustrating man! \u201cJust as soon as I figure out how to land on the earth without going splat, you won\u2019t be able to stop me.\u201d</p><p>She gazed around the room, looking for a window without a thirty-thousand-foot\u2014or more\u2014fall. She saw alabaster columns, with ivy twined from base to ceiling. The floor was ebony, the walls ivory, with gorgeous tapestries hanging throughout. But no windows. The only exit was the door, now guarded by two winged warriors with metal swords.</p><p>She breathed deeply. The air smelled clean and fresh, and pure. As if it had never been tainted by evil. She looked up. The ceiling was domed, with Sent Ones painted throughout\u2014no, not painted, she realized. Not painted at all. The dome was made of crystal and peered into a higher realm of the heavens. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>There she saw...no way...but there her precious Laila was, standing beside a handsome young man with red...hair...</p><p>Robby? Was that Robby, all grown-up? Nicola\u2019s eyes widened. The two were hugging and grinning and laughing, so happy it made Nicola\u2019s chest hurt.</p><p>They were together again.</p> <p>Joy was deposited directly into her heart, filling her up, overflowing. One day, Nicola and Koldo would join them. She\u2019d had knowledge of that before, but just then, it sank deep into her spirit, coming alive. Yes, one day.</p><p>But not today.</p><p>\u201cKoldo needs me,\u201d she said. \u201cI have to\u2014\u201d</p><p>An unassuming-looking man suddenly paced in front of her, claiming her attention. He had dark hair and kind, dark eyes. He wore a white robe, his hands anchored behind his back.</p><p>Oh, good. Someone else to pester about this. \u201cSir,\u201d she said. \u201cMy name is Nicola, I\u2019m human, and I need\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMy name is Clerici.\u201d</p><p>\u201cClerici. Hi. Nice to meet you. I have a problem and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSent Ones are not angels, you know,\u201d he said, interrupting her again. \u201cWe\u2019re often called angels, and sometimes we refer to ourselves that way, but if we break down the pieces, we aren\u2019t angels. Really, we are humans with special abilities. And yes, we have longer life spans and wings. We also fight evil.\u201d</p><p>O-kay. Trying again. \u201cSir. I know all that. It\u2019s been explained to me. But I really need to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOur people serve the Most High, who is a Holy Trinity,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Merciful One, the Anointed One and the Mighty One. We\u2014and you\u2014were created in His image. We are spirits, we have a soul, and we live in a body. Your spirit is your power source, what lives forever, and your soul is your mind, will and emotions. I\u2019m sure you\u2019re well acquainted with your body.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am. Now. I\u2019d like to leave and\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe Most High gave each of us a sword of fire. A sword you wielded,\u201d he said, and stopped. Just stopped and stared over at her with an enigmatic expression.</p><p>\u201cHey, you can\u2019t be any more surprised than I was. But there\u2019s no time to ponder the reasons. Koldo is out there, and he needs me, and I\u2019m going to find\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t wield the sword because you married Koldo, although that plays a part, I think.\u201d</p><p>Argh! Would he never allow her to finish a sentence?</p><p>\u201cYou wielded it because you were adopted into the Most High\u2019s family. That adoption is the true origin of a Sent One. Perhaps one day you\u2019ll even grow wings. Now, however, you will fight for us.\u201d</p><p>Wait, wait, wait. She was now a supernatural being, meant to join this warrior\u2019s army? Head...spinning... \u201cI\u2019m happy to help you. I am. But I\u2019m going after Koldo first,\u201d she said in a rush before the male could stop her. She would do whatever was necessary to succeed. \u201cWe\u2019ll talk about all this other stuff when he\u2019s safe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know where he is,\u201d Zacharel said. His first words since this had started.</p><p>Nicola spun to face him. \u201cWhat! Why didn\u2019t you tell me? Where is he? What\u2019s happened?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThere was nothing you could do to aid him. You would only have harmed him. And my attention was and is needed elsewhere, where I can do some good. Another of my warriors is missing, and his friends are near the breaking point.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d Nicola began.</p><p>\u201cThe part about Koldo is true,\u201d Clerici said, cutting her off. Again. \u201cAny Sent One who has been whipped for the Water of Life cannot be aided until their wounds have healed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s insane!\u201d she gasped.</p><p>\u201cI agree. I have attempted to convince the Council to abolish the tradition, but they insist on continuing it the way Germanus did. I will continue to work on them, though. But until I succeed, to aid Koldo is to condemn one\u2019s self to the same pain he now suffers.\u201d He turned to Zacharel. \u201cFor all but her. She can aid Koldo. She\u2019s his other half, an extension of his being. Whatever she does to aid him will be as if he\u2019s doing it himself.\u201d</p><p>A muscle ticked in Zacharel\u2019s jaw. \u201cTo escort her to him is to die myself, for I cannot fight the Nefas. I\u2019m not bound to the warrior, thus anything I do on his behalf before he is healed will be considered aid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. But you can aid and protect her.\u201d</p><p>Zacharel\u2019s shoulders straightened, and he jolted, as if he\u2019d just experienced a startling revelation. \u201cThat\u2019s true.\u201d</p><p>So...he and his men couldn\u2019t hurt the bad guys unless they threatened her? Otherwise they\u2019d be helping Koldo. And they could help her, even though she was Koldo\u2019s other half, because she was also half...well, Nicola. Had anything ever been more confusing?</p><p>Clerici\u2019s head tilted to the side, returning to his study of her. \u201cAre you ready for battle, Nicola?\u201d</p><p>For the man she loved? \u201cI am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKoldo will be upset if she\u2019s injured,\u201d Zacharel said.</p><p>\u201cHe can\u2019t be upset if he\u2019s dead,\u201d she said\u2014and guess what? No one interrupted her.</p><p>Clerici brushed his knuckles across her cheek in the gentlest of caresses. \u201cI like the way your mind works, female. Now, go get your husband.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER THIRTY-SIX</p><p>Even the smallest light can grow until there\u2019s no darkness left.</p><p>NICOLA HAD NEVER been to war. Well, not in the natural realm, fighting with her physical body. But even if she had, she knew it wouldn\u2019t have prepared her for this.</p><p>Zacharel flew her toward the side of a building in\u2014she wasn\u2019t sure where she was anymore. There were multiple structures, a bridge, water, black birds in every direction, and the air was supercold, even damp. There were about fifteen soldiers with him, flying beside him, and oh, they were a majestic sight.</p><p>The sky was dark, the moon high, stars twinkling from their perches. The Sent Ones had somehow colored their wings black with tiny diamond sparks throughout the feathers, and the long appendages blended perfectly into the night.</p><p>To the left, she could just make out Jamila\u2019s beautiful face. There was fear in her eyes, but also a little excitement. My coworker is a Sent One, and I had no idea. And what was that sound? The...rattle of snake tails? The rustle of unmowed grass? The hiss of an animal being threatened?</p><p>\u201cSerp demons,\u201d Zacharel said. \u201cAs I\u2019m sure you know, they are almost as evil as the Nefas, and they are poisonous to all life. They feed upon destruction.\u201d</p><p>The Nefas were worse, and Koldo was related to one. But look at everything he\u2019d done to overcome his heritage and his past. He might have been born to vileness, but he\u2019d crawled out of it, was no longer a part of it.</p><p>Jade-green eyes locked on her. \u201cThese creatures wish to hurt Koldo. Can you kill them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d No hesitation. Evil wasn\u2019t to be tolerated.</p><p>\u201cGood. Because they\u2019ve sensed us, which means the starting bell has rung.\u201d To the others, he shouted, Only kill those who approach the girl.</p><p>Somehow, the words reverberated through her mind rather than her ears.</p><p>There was no time to question him, no time to marvel. He swooped down and dropped her on the street. She landed with a thud, dust pluming around her. Demons shot out of the shadows, headed straight for her\u2014but Zacharel\u2019s men were there, their swords of fire lighting up the night and striking the demons before they could reach her. Grunts and groans sounded. Heads soon rolled.</p><p>So close...</p><p>Thankfully, there were no other humans around. It was too late, she supposed.</p><p>Before she had time to unfreeze from petrifaction\u2014thought I was prepared...thought wrong\u2014Zacharel scooped her up and resumed his breakneck pace toward the building, which was looming closer and closer. Closer still. He never slowed.</p><p>She squeezed her eyes closed, expecting to crash. But then he dived down. Farther and farther. Surely they would reach the ground any moment...now! Impact never came. The air chilled another degree, and she looked on. They were now underground and\u2014going farther dooown. She swallowed a yelp of panic.</p><p>When they landed at the bottom of a cave, Zacharel set her on her feet and released her. Then, he and his men lined up behind her, making her a big fat target. Gasps of shock resounded through a now-active campsite, followed by growls of rage. Footsteps scrambled. Bald-headed warriors raced toward her. Just before they reached her, Zacharel broke formation and attacked, swinging his sword of fire. Shouts of pain and panic rang out. The gasps and growls were replaced by grunts and groans.</p><p>Baldies kept coming, and the rest of the warriors broke from behind her, as well, stepping beside her to save her from being run down...or decapitated. Their swords danced through the air, cutting, slicing. Flesh burned. Screams joined the chorus. The winged soldiers darted up, flipped in the air, plunged low, moving so quickly she had trouble tracking their progress. Some of the Nefas ran away. Some ran toward the action. But Zacharel and the others couldn\u2019t chase them.</p><p>\u201cNicola,\u201d Zacharel said from beside her. \u201cDo something to draw attention to yourself. Get the rest of them to attack you.\u201d</p><p>Yes. Of course.</p><p>No, she thought a moment later. She was here to fight, not to watch the action from afar. Not to watch others be struck down defending her. She could do something. And she would.</p><p>She held out her arm and peered down at her hand. Her empty hand. What had she done to summon the sword before? She thought back. Laila had just died. Oh, my darling Laila. The demons had just threatened Nicola. She had imagined her life with Koldo.</p><p>Joy had filled her.</p><p>Joy, then.</p><p>Nothing delighted her more than the thought of rescuing Koldo, of living her life with him, the way she\u2019d been born to do. And she would.</p><p>Flames sparked to sudden life.</p><p>\u201cYou and your men gather as many of the enemy as you can,\u201d she said to Zacharel, \u201cand I\u2019ll deliver the deathblows. Don\u2019t do this to help Koldo, but to save me from their wrath. You know they\u2019ll come after me if I survive.\u201d Hopefully, that would save everyone from any kind of penalty. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Zacharel gaped at her, but he asked no questions. He leaped into motion.</p><p>He quickly caught one of the Nefas and threw him in Nicola\u2019s direction. She acted immediately, swinging her sword. The tip slashed through the being\u2019s middle. He collapsed on the cave floor, writhing. She struck a second time, taking his head.</p><p>One down.</p> <p>Zacharel sped back into motion. Determined, she marched forward. A male swooped in from the left, morphing from human to black smoke in seconds\u2014before reappearing just in front of her, reaching for her. Again she swung the sword. He ducked and straightened. His hands fit around her neck. But at the moment of contact, he flew backward, as though she\u2019d pushed him.</p><p>Was she...shielded again? By her tattoos? Even though she wasn\u2019t staring at them? Maybe. Maybe she had memorized the numbers, and they were now a part of her. Maybe there was another reason. Either way...this rocked.</p><p>He hit the ground, hard, losing his breath, allowing her to simply drag her sword up his middle as she walked past.</p><p>Two down.</p><p>Nope. Three...four...five down. Zacharel and the others constantly threw the Nefas at her and she easily ended their lives, never missing a step.</p> <p>Six, seven, eight.</p><p>After that, she lost count.</p><p>She saw that tents had been erected at the far end of the cavern, a little river winding through the center. The man from the park, Koldo\u2019s father, rushed out of the biggest one, with another male and Sirena at his sides. Their eyes widened when they spotted Nicola and her sword.</p><p>Axel and Koldo stumbled from another tent. Both were covered in blood and bruises, their faces swollen, and they had to lean on each other to remain upright. Rage and concern nearly dropped her where she stood, but Nicola pushed the emotions back. Now wasn\u2019t the time to indulge.</p><p>The group of Nefas paused a few feet away from her, just out of striking distance.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re outnumbered, Nox,\u201d Zacharel called.</p> <p>Sirena opened her mouth to speak. Nicola leaped forward and struck without issuing a warning.</p><p>The girl\u2019s head fell to the ground, and her body followed.</p><p>Twenty-six, maybe?</p><p>Unlike the girls in the late-night movies, Nicola wasn\u2019t interested in taking time to discuss what was about to happen, what problems they had with each other or anything like that. She was simply doing what needed doing to save her man.</p><p>Koldo\u2019s father peered down at the blonde\u2019s motionless body and shouted with fury. His gaze jerked up, landing on Nicola, and he pounded toward her\u2014only to hit the same wall the other male had. He didn\u2019t fall, but stumbled back a few steps before catching himself.</p><p>As the remaining guard gaped, Nicola was able to strike at him.</p><p>Twenty-seven.</p><p>Koldo\u2019s father hurtled a mouthful of vile curses at her. \u201cI\u2019m going to remove my son\u2019s intestines through his mouth and force you to watch as he dies.\u201d</p> <p>She laughed. \u201cYou\u2019ll do no such thing. You\u2019re surrounded. Your army is defeated.\u201d</p><p>He launched at her again, but again, he flew backward. When he straightened, he shook his head, as if to orient his thoughts. \u201cHow are you doing that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAw, is the evil man confused? Does he not understand he picked the wrong side?\u201d One step, two, she approached him.</p><p>Paling, he backed up until he could go no farther, the jagged walls of the cave stopping him. \u201cStay away, or I\u2019ll find a way to rip out your throat.\u201d</p><p>Hardly. \u201cI bet you wish you\u2019d stayed in hiding,\u201d she said, continuing her forward march. \u201cAll your scheming and fighting, and you have to die knowing the good guys came out of this far stronger than when it started.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m unarmed,\u201d he said, raising his palms. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to do this.\u201d</p><p>A lie. He was always armed with evil. And she really wanted to do this.</p><p>She struck, but he bent low, avoiding contact. The momentum spun her, leaving her back to him. He charged her, but hit that invisible wall for a third time and stumbled backward.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019ll never get old,\u201d she said, and spun back around, facing him.</p><p>He tried to dart right, but Zacharel stopped him.</p><p>He tried to dart left, but another soldier stopped him.</p><p>\u201cYou did this to yourself,\u201d she said, and struck.</p><p>This time, he had nowhere to go. Her sword sliced through his stomach. Blood and intestines spilled out.</p><p>His knees collapsed, and he hit the ground. His mouth opened on a pained moan.</p><p>\u201cFinish him,\u201d Zacharel commanded.</p><p>\u201cWith pleasure.\u201d Another slash of her arms, and his head was rolling toward her feet, minus his body.</p><p>Twenty-eight?</p><p>The Sent Ones erupted into cheers. Someone patted her on the shoulder, nearly drilling her into the ground. She let go of the sword, and it vanished.</p><p>\u201cKoldo,\u201d she said, and raced toward him.</p><p>KOLDO BLINKED OPEN his eyes. His pain was gone, his strength having returned. He frowned. How was that possible? He was no longer in the cave. Instead, the white walls of his ranch surrounded him.</p><p>And what was that warm thing pressed up against him? He looked down, and saw the spread of Nicola\u2019s strawberry curls over his chest. Her beautiful face was tilted up, toward his, and her eyes were closed. Her breathing was even. The confusion magnified. He\u2019d been trapped in that cage with Axel.</p><p>Axel! That\u2019s right. The warrior had been beaten, as broken as Koldo, and yet, after hearing the sounds of battle, he and Koldo had somehow found the strength to tear the cage apart. Together, they had walked out of the slave tent. That\u2019s when he\u2019d seen what he\u2019d assumed was merely a hallucination: Nicola, holding a sword of fire, forcing his father to back down.</p><p>Then nothing. He must have passed out.</p><p>Then cheers had rung out, waking him, and he\u2019d heard little bits of conversation.</p><p>\u201c\u2014never expected a former human to fight like that,\u201d someone had said. \u201cAnd the fact that you have the tattoos, creating the force field, is even better. You better believe I\u2019ll be getting an outward sign of the Most High\u2019s promise, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can be my battle partner anytime.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKoldo\u2019s a lucky man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNicola,\u201d Koldo said now, his voice rougher than he\u2019d intended.</p><p>Like him, she blinked open her eyes. Then, she jolted upright and faced him. \u201cYou\u2019re finally awake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s your sister?\u201d</p><p>Sadness caused her features to fall. \u201cShe didn\u2019t make it.\u201d</p><p>No. He had failed her, then. Had failed the love of his life. And Laila, too. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry, Nicola. I tried\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you did.\u201d She offered him a soft smile. \u201cI\u2019ll never be able to thank you enough for all you endured on her behalf.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI should have... I wish...\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Don\u2019t do that to yourself. We don\u2019t even know if she would have accepted the gift. And she\u2019s happy now. She\u2019s with Robby, and they\u2019re both so happy.\u201d</p><p>Koldo reached up with a hand shaky from disuse and caressed her cheek. Soft, warm. \u201cI love you,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI love you, too. So much.\u201d</p><p>He breathed her in, savoring what he\u2019d thought to never have again. \u201cTell me what happened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, for starters, the two demons you warned me about attacked me, trying to infect me with more toxin, and I killed them with a sword of fire. Then, the Most High adopted me. Or maybe He did before, and I just didn\u2019t know it. Then, I managed to kill your father and save the day. In a nutshell, I totally rocked it!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou...are a Sent One?\u201d He\u2019d had that one moment of suspicion, and yet, he was still shocked to his soul.</p><p>She nodded, pleased. \u201cI am.\u201d</p><p>He could barely process the knowledge. It was just too amazing.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d he said, to the Most High, to Nicola. Like the sword of fire, she was a gift from above, and he would be forever grateful for her. He kissed the line of her jaw. \u201cWe\u2019re in Panama, aren\u2019t we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d She angled her head, ensuring the next kiss was on her lips.</p><p>\u201cHow long was I out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwo weeks, and a lot of things have happened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can imagine. But wait. You helped me, and you shouldn\u2019t have helped me, love. It\u2019s against the\u2014\u201d</p><p>She placed a finger over his mouth, silencing him. \u201cIt\u2019s okay. I\u2019m a part of you, and you\u2019re a part of me. It was like you were helping yourself. Clerici said so. And guess what? Your hair is growing back.\u201d</p><p>He frowned as he moved his hand to his scalp, and sure enough, there was stubble on his scalp, tickling his palm. \u201cThat\u2019s impossible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope. Clerici isn\u2019t fond of some of the rules the Council came up with. Rules that go against the Most High\u2019s desires. So, he\u2019s cut a few. He even ruled that all sacrifices for the Water be returned.\u201d</p><p>As Koldo moved, something dug into his back. He reached around, felt\u2014</p><p>\u201cWing buds,\u201d he said, his shock deepening. His wings were growing back, too. He would no longer be bald like his father. He would once again be able to soar through the skies, taking his woman wherever she wished to go. \u201cWhat could be better?\u201d</p><p>A slow grin lifted the corners of her lips, but her amusement didn\u2019t last long. \u201cI hate to be the bearer of bad news, but you have to be told. Bjorn is missing. Thane and Xerxes are going crazy as they search for him. Zacharel and the others are helping. And some guy named Kane was spotted in New York, but then he vanished again, and it\u2019s got everyone in a tizzy.\u201d</p><p>Kane. One of the Lords of the Underworld, and the keeper of the demon of disaster. He\u2019d been lost in hell for weeks, though rumors of his torture had surfaced. The warrior\u2019s friends had come to the Army of Disgrace, asking for help locating him. A promise had been issued, but no one had had any luck, until now.</p><p>\u201cI must help my people,\u201d Koldo said. \u201cWith Kane, and with Bjorn.\u201d And the six demons responsible for Germanus\u2019s death were still out there. Finding and dealing with them, before they could infect all of humanity, had to be a top priority. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body>  <p>\u201cI had a feeling you\u2019d say that.
